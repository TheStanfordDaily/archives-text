## Another day of mourning 
### 
MOURNING HAS broken, like the
first mourning . ..
So it's the day after the ASSU
elections and yes, I'm grief-stricken —
and it ain't 'cause I wasn't around to vote.
All around us the world is changing
for what appears to be the better, but
alas some things stay the same.
Sure, the Cold War has been put out
to thaw, Czechoslovakia has a playwright
for a president, our own George Bush
has taken a stand on an issue of vital
importance to broccoli growers and small
children, James Brown is freer than he
has been in a while and Iraq — while
pissed as usual — now has chemical weap
ons. Whoops, didn't mean to include that.
And yet despite these largely pleasing
developments we here at Stanford still
insist on torturing ourselves each spring
in the annual rite known as ASSU elec
tions.
This is the general reason I am in
mourning, I could easily go into par
ticulars. Oh, why not ... I mourn a good
deal for the deaths of thousands of trees
who gave their lives in the service of
failed ASSU hopefuls.
I don't think that the trees could have
known, when felled, that they'd be giving
their lives to resume-packing law school
contestants any more than the ASSU
candidates could have known whether or
not they'd win, but I still lament their
loss.
On the other hand, maybe I'm wrong
about what those trees knew; somewhere
on campus there may in fact be a flier
made of a tree that, when alive, was more
intelligent than the candidate it now ad

vertises. It seems plausible to me, anyway
I'd bet that the vast majority of
People's Platform and Students First can
didates are concerned about deforesta
tion.
I also bet that most of them never
gave a second thought to their fliers'
contribution to our own country's
deforestation. Sure, sure, "please recycle
this flier" is a nice gesture, but a little
after the fact, isn't it?
All in all, it's pretty sad to greet Earth
Day with a deluge of pointless paper
waste. Admittedly, I'm just as low for
writing a column for a daily paper —
but I did ask the editors if I could leave
this space entirely blank as a form of
silent protest. They said no.
I mourn because the "Universal
Laminated Student ID" promise once
again appeared on campaign fliers. You
might as well promise world peace and
free beer as long as you're at it ...
I mourn because of the ASSU's "Beat
the Bookstore" program — not because
I disapprove of free-market capitalism
but because I think there is something
fundamentally wrong with our student
leaders laying siege to the campus text
vendors.
Personally, I'd prefer a good old
fashioned pitched battle — I can see it
now: the corpses of senators and stock
boys littering the Bookstore steps; fallen
COP members and book buyers floating
face down in Tanner fountain; freshmen
scurrying in White Plaza picking the
pockets of the mortally wounded for extra
textbook receipts for which to stuff their

rebate envelopes; and, as the smoke
clears, University President Donald Ken
nedy stepping to the fore, surveying the
carnage and saying, "I hope we've all
learned a valuable lesson from this day
n
I mourn because two separate slates
for Senior Class Presidents called them
selves "Just Do It." So much for crea
tivity. Ever since Nike uttered those three
fateful words, everybody in the frigging
universe has been telling everybody else
to "Just Do It."
Frankly, I'm still wondering what "It"
is that we're all supposed to "Do;" is "It"
the same "It"from the "Take It Easy"
or "I Found It" bumperstickers I used
to see on the backs of cars? What does
one "Do" with "It" anyway?
And what does one "Do" with "It"
when one is done doing "It?" Is "It"
something we can recycle?
There is one thing we can be thankful
for, though, and that is that the ASSU,
like the United States government, is
mostly a bunch of benign dough-heads
and not an oppressive totalitarian regime.
But on second thought, if it were an
oppressive totalitarian regime we could
have a revolution — and that would be
fun.
