Department should re-examine its commitment to teaching

AS FORMER undergraduate teach
ing assistants in the Vertebrate
Biology course (Bio 110), and as
close friends of Ellen Porzig, we wish
to bring to light the circumstances
surrounding her recent decision to
resign from the Department of Biologi
cal Sciences.
Our aim here is both to emphasize
what a terrible loss Porzig's departure
represents to undergraduate education
at Stanford, and to question the de
partment's priorities with respect to
teaching and research.
Since being hired initially to a lec
turer position 10 years ago, Porzig has
proved herself to be one of the best
loved and most-dedicated teachers in
the department. Her tireless, behind
the-scenes efforts in the Vertebrate
Biology course helped make that class
the most popular course taught within
the department.
Year after year, evidence of Porzig's
successful efforts can be seen by the
overwhelming number of Vertebrate

Biology students seeking to become
future TAs.
With her role within the department
becoming ever more significant, Porzig
decided this past fall quarter to re
quest consideration for a faculty ap
pointment. In a closed meeting, the
biological sciences faculty voted unani
mously to promote Porzig to a faculty
position.
Upon being informed of this decision
by department chair Robert Simoni and
Prof. Pat Jones, Porzig was under
standably oveijoyed. What Simoni and
Jones neglected to tell Porzig at the
time was that her new appointment
came with a five-year, non-negotiable
termination clause. When Porzig finally
discovered this "additional" feature,
her shock and dismay prompted her to
file an immediate resignation from the
department.
We find the Biological Sciences De
partment's policy on faculty appoint
ments to be unrealistic and coun
terproductive to the goal of undergrad

uate teaching excellence. In Simoni's
own words, "First, we (the department)
feel that the (teaching) line should not
become a permanent faculty line and
second, we feel that at a research
university teaching should be done by
the research faculty."
Judging from courses we took at
Stanford, successful research is not a
measure of teaching ability. Moreover,
Simoni overlooks the fact that effective
teaching sustains effective research.
While a top-notch researcher may
exicte a student's fancy by detailing his
or her cutting-edge theories or experi
ments, the student must first receive a
strong foundation in basic principles, a
task often best accomplished by a truly
dedicated teacher such as Porzig.
The department's inappropriate and
inadequate course offerings reflect its
lack of dedication to undergraduate
teaching. At present a biology student
majoring in Biological Sciences cannot
attain a strong background in biology
by choosing courses solely from the

department.
In fact, most majors as a rule take
electives from other departments. One
reason behind this necessity to take
out-of-department courses is that the
department caters excessively to the
individual tastes of its high-profile
researchers, resulting in a curriculum
replete with more esoteric courses and
lacking in intermediate-level foundation
courses.
The implementation of non-tenure
line faculty as teachers for selected
basic and intermediate-level courses
would help correct this present
deficiency. However, the department's
adherence to a policy of inflexible,
limited-term appointments for lecturers
clearly undermines the integrity of the
current curriculum.
Though the department may state as
its rationale for replacing lecturers
every three to five years that changing
personnel brings fresh prespectives on
teaching, the end result tends to be
courses lacking in consistency from

year to year and teachers lacking in
loyalty to the department. Simoni's
"desire to maintain high levels of
teaching achievement" is contradicted
by the department's refusal to appoint
top-notch lecturers such as Porzig to
long-term faculty appointments.
Speaking on behalf of the hundreds
of present and former Stanford stu
dents who came to know her as a
teacher, adviser and friend, we wish to
thank Porzig once again for all her
tireless efforts.
We also wish to implore the Biologi
cal Sciences Department faculty and
administration and the University to
realize that policies that reject excellent
teachers are not compatible with the
goal of excellence in undergraduate
teaching.
