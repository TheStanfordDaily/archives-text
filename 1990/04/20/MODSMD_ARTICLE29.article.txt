# Remembering 1906
## 8.3 destroys Memorial Church, kills two

The Simplified Spelling Board,
calling for the advancement of
simple and logical spelling of Eng
lish words, sent out two circulars
explaining the need for reform.
The circulars argued in favor
of simplified spelling and con
tained a list of words spelled in
two or more ways. Students were
encouraged to sign an agreement
to use the simple spelling of
words.
Founded by Andrew Carnegie,
the board was composed of Uni
versity President David Starr Jor
dan, German Prof. George Hempl
and Acting Philosophy Prof.
William James.
De Inglich language iz de end
product of human evolution. Their
iz no reason y it should be tainted

ings. Eye hear 4th promise two

logical spelling of annie wyrd eye
right. Eye will alsew try two my

monosylabic language dat is the

At 5:07 A. M., an earthquake
measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale
shook the campus, killing two
people — a student and a fireman
in the boiler house. The quake
lasted 20 seconds and destroyed
Memorial Church, the new libra
ry, the new gymnasium and most
of San Francisco.
Damages at Stanford were es
timated at $2.8 million. $100,000
was allocated for restoring the
badly damaged Quad.
University President David
Starr Jordan canceled classes for
the rest of the quarter. He in
structed professors to give their
students grades as if they had
completed the quarter.
Happy Earthquake Fest 1990! In
celebration of the six-month anni
versary of the October 17, 1989
quake and the 84th anniversary

of the 1906 quake, there were 75
earthquakes Wednesday morning.
Events were sponsored by God's
No Fault Earthworks and Earth
Day 1990. When put into perspec
tive the damage caused to Stan
ford by the 1906 quake doesn't
seem so bad if you compare it to
the what student groups are ask
ing for on the ASSU ballot.

University President Ray
Lyman Wilbur met with the Stan
ford National Board to put into
definite form his proposal to do
away with the freshman and soph
more years. According to his plan,
the University would institute a
progressive system of elimination
of the Lower Division, to be com
pleted in 1934.
The plan was designed to keep
pace with the increasing number
of applicants to junior colleges.
Wilbur estimated that Stanford's
lower-level college work would be
absorbed by other institutions of
fering such courses, therefore
eliminating any obligation of
Stanford to accept freshmen and
sophomores.
I would like to suggest cutting the
freshman class as a budget move.
Wilbur must have really hated
freshmen, sophomores and The
Band if he was willing to change
Stanford into Leland Stanford
Junior Senior University. Wilbur
Hall and Western Culture are
probably Wilbur's last laugh at
the "lower divisions." And you
thought the university couldn't
live without you.
