# Many fee requests squeak by
## 
### Janine De Fao Editorial staff 
After losing its special fee re
quest last year, even after a special
second vote was called, the Stan
ford Axe/Big Game Bonfire Com
mittee squeezed by in last night's
vote to receive its $29,000 fee re
quest â€” by a margin of only .61
percent.
"It was prettty close. I would
have felt better if it was a bigger
margin," said Tim Sullivan, assis
tant chair of the committee. Sul
livan said he was unsure if the
committee ran a good campaign
because it rebounded from having
lost the assessment last year, or
a bad campaign because it "just
barely got it."
Throughout last night, tallies
of many other fee requests were
close and concerned group mem
bers hovered around the ASSU
office, waiting for the latest up
dates that would greatly influence
the existence of their groups next
year.
MEChA's request was the most
threatened, with the "yes" vote
only being up 50 to 49 percent at
one point in the evening. The
group did pull ahead and had a
53 percent "yes" vote as of 2:15
a.m.
"We thought we'd be ahead by
more. It has to do with a lot of
negative things that came out this
year which aren't true. People
don't realize that we do a lot of
programming and educating,"
said MEChA member Lore Bar
ron.
Similarly, the Black Student
Union fee request was also a close
call for much of the night. The
request received a final 56 percent
of the vote, increasing from an
early estimate of only 53 percent
of the student body voting favor
ably.
Nelda Brown, a BSU officer,
said she was "disturbed as a black
student and as an officer of the
BSU that it had to come down to

almost an equal vote." This ques
tions the legitimacy of the BSU,
she said.
"I don't really know why, but
I can speculate," Brown said.
"The BSU is always portrayed as
being more radical, more political,
and that scares people. Of course
we are political, but there is a lot
to the BSU that the general public
doesn't see."
Other groups were not as for
tunate.
The Chaparral, which has not
received its request in recent
years, got support from only 42
percent of the voters.
"We are going to move the
Chaparral to Berkeley," said
editor Victor Payan, quickly add
ing that he was only jesting.
On a more serious note, Payan
said, "We seemed to get positive
feedback from people. . . . We
asked for suggested improvements
and changes on that basis. It
looked as if people were happy
with what we were doing. As far
as we knew, people liked the
stuff."
The Stanford Symphony Or
chestra Members Committee lost
its first bid for a fee by a 53 to
47 percent vote.
"We'll have to look into more

sales-type events or increase the
number of paid gigs we do or we
can .. . find a corporate sponsor,
which is not easy to do," said
Scott Starrett, the committee's
ASSU liason.
Starrett added that the sym
phony's plans to play in Europe
next spring break are now jeopar
dized.
By far the biggest loser in the
quest for student fees was the
Party Source, which garnered
only 912 votes, 16 percent, in its
favor. Members of the group could
not be reached or did not wish to
comment, although one member
said they "weren't too happy"
with the negative endorsement of
The Daily's editorial board.
Paratransit Cart Service was
yet another group to fall short of
a majority of student votes. The
new service received only 47 per
cent of the 50 percent necessary.
