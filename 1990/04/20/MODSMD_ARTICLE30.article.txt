# What happens to professors who have overdue books?

Don't forget this Sunday is Earth Day
1990. In observance of Earth Day I
decided to recycle my roomate's car. It
took me 14 hours to fill eight green recy
cling bins
Dear Bug,
Which professors have the most overdue
books and what is the largest fine ever
issued by the library ?
— Karen the Librarian
There are a lot of professors out there
and only one Bug, but nevertheless I
took on this formidable task with not so
much as a grimace or whimper. I started
with the Meyer Library Circulation/Loan
desk. The response was: "I better get my
supervisor." As a matter of fact, everybody
told me that when I called.
Anyway, the person at the circulation
desk told me that that information was
confidential and referred me to the ref
erence desk. The lady at the reference
desk told me she had to get her supervisor
who "probably wouldn't answer the first
question but might answer the second."
Then she referred me to the person at
the information desk, who told me to call
Privileges. Privileges referred me to the
Religious Studies Department where I
was told to light incense thrice daily and
chant the question with outstretched
arms.

I did eventually find somebody who
would tell me about outstanding library
fines. The way the library works, accord
ing to Rob who a) works at one of the
above-mentioned desks, b) works at all
of the above-mentioned desks or c) is the
Dean of the Religious Studies Depart
ment, is like this: Student X checks out
a book. Student X forgets to turn in the
book at the due date and is thus assessed
a $3 late fee. After the first two weeks
another $5 fee is assessed and the student
is sent a bill listing the fees and the
replacement cost of the book, which is
generally $73 unless you buy in bulk, at
which point the replacement fees are
modestly discounted at 10 percent.
One student has $3,327 in library fines
for 44 books. He stopped out one-and-a
half years ago to open a bookstore and
is "unlikely to re-enroll." According to
the ASSU he is also ineligible for a fee
refund.
One woman left a stack of books for
a friend to return before going to an
overseas campus only to have a hold
placed on her registration. Her parents
had to drive all the way down from
Sacramento to pay the $1,000 fine. Her
friend was later caught trying to sell the
books back to the Bookstore.
In any case, the way they nail you is
to put a hold on your registration and
condemn you to Stern Hall food until
amends are made. If you hold an alumni
card, the library allows you to steal one

book for every $5,000 in donations to
the University. If you don't donate, how
ever, they limit you to one six-pack of
beer and make you sit in the backless
seats at all football games.
The other question — which professors
have the most overdue books — is "con
fidential information." I called most of
the libraries until I realized that getting
an answer was about as futile as trying
to rush Sigma Chi if you don't own any
button-down Oxfoids.
I did get an anonymous hint, and I
managed to discreetly obtain a list of
questionable professors. I called all of
the professors to verify the information
— of course none returned my call. Pro
fessors aren't required to pay overdue
fines, which I'd imagine might eliminate
the motivation to return the books at
all. At the Law library, for instance, the
professors don't even have to return the
books, people just go to their office and
borrow the books as needed ... hmm,
maybe I'll borrow that jade figurine on
the desk as well.
I did actually get a hold of one political
science professor — let's call him Profes
sor X (His real name is David Abernethy).
He told me that professors read slowly
so they are given a full year to return
the books. According to Prof. X there
was a discussion at a Faculty Senate
meeting about two years ago concerning
how bad the professors were at returning
books, after which they voted not to pay
fines. He also told me that if he had any

overdue books it was because of graduate
students he'd loaned materials to, and
that he'd sue me if I bad-mouthed him.
I mistakenly called University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy while trying to con
tact History Prof. David Kennedy.
President Kennedy was clean, of course,
but I thought I'd do some snooping any
way. I waited until he left the office and
then posed as David Packard making a
social visit. While waiting I took a look
about and sure enough there was a copy
of "Democracy is in the Streets" and
"Young Radicals" wedged between his
desk and the wall. Due date: Nov. 22,
1989.
Prof. Kennedy is the hands-down win
ner with 128 overdue books on Marxist
theory and one Better Homes and Gar
dens book on backyard vegetables. Polit
ical Science Prof. John Manley has had
the entire William F. Buckley collection
checked out for four years. And lastly,
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Mark Cut
kosky has checked out every book that
has the word robot, robotics or Romulan
in the title plus the only library copy of
the Robo Cop picture book.
Dear Bug,
1 don't know if this is a Bug or Science
Bug question but here goes: Why doesn't
the Pepsi machine in front of the Daily
office take dollar bills?
— A passerby
Sure enough, the Pepsi machine does
not take dollar bills. I called Campus

Vending Services and they didn't know.
So, I asked the news editor and former
science editor:
"The reason is . . . um ... I don't
know."
I asked the machine, which didn't re
spond of course. I even offered it a five
instead of a one. Next I asked the editor
in chief if he knew:
"No"
I even asked another passerby, who
looked at me like I was an idiot. Finally
I asked Kris, who sits closest to the Pepsi
machine.
"Because there are no nickels to give
change, or else your dollar bill is chewed
up. I asked the Pepsi guy last time he
was here." She didn't even stop typing.
