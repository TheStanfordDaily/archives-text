## Stanford tennis juggernaut faces strong streak test 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford rivalry with a cer
tain pair of schools situated in
Los Angeles is nearly as great as
the one with those folks in
Berkeley. In many sports, though,
USC and UCLA tend to get the
better of that rivalry a little too
often for Cardinal fans.
Fortunately, when the Bruins
and Trojans visit this weekend,
the action will be in women's ten
nis — an athletic endeavor in
which the Cardinal has a back-to
back-to-back-to-back national
championship streak.
On top of that, Stanford's
women have won 59 straight dual
matches. If they keep it up, they
could eventually surpass the 88
consecutive wins of John
Wooden's UCLA basketball teams.
Not, of course, if the Bruins
have any say in the matter. Two
years and five days ago, UCLA
visited the Cardinal at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium and walked
off with a 6-3 victory. The Car
dinal has avenged that defeat on
five separate occasions since then
— including last year's NCAA
championship final — but it has
not always been easy.
Just two weeks ago at the
UCLA Tennis Center, the Bruins

pushed the Cardinal to the limit
before Stanford escaped with a
5-4 victory. It was one of the
closest matches since the streak
began.
USC has threatened the Cardi
nal along the way as well, and
historically is the more significant
rival. Since 1977, Stanford has
won seven national champion
ships. The Trojans have won five.
A look at some of the highlights
of action between the two schools
in recent years:

April 15, 1988: UCLA at Stanford
An ordinary match between the
two schools. Teri Whitlinger is
double-bageled by UCLA fresh
man Kirsten Dreyer. Lisa Green
is hammered by another Bruin
frosh, Jessica Emmons. The
teams are tied 3-3 after singles.
In doubles, though, its all
UCLA. The Bruins sweep all three
matches to record the victory.
Stanford would not lose again un

Meredith McGrath hopes that is only a freshman, but as the No. 2 singles player for the Cardinal
she knows how tough UCLA and (JSC are for Stanford traditionally. UCLA, the last team to beat the
streaking Cardinal, will visit Stanford Tennis Stadium today.
