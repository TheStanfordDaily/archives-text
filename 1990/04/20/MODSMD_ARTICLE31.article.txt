## Stanford tennis juggernaut faces strong streak test 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford rivalry with a cer
tain pair of schools situated in
Los Angeles is nearly as great as
the one with those folks in
Berkeley. In many sports, though,
USC and UCLA tend to get the
better of that rivalry a little too
often for Cardinal fans.
Fortunately, when the Bruins
and Trojans visit this weekend,
the action will be in women's ten
nis — an athletic endeavor in
which the Cardinal has a back-to
back-to-back-to-back national
championship streak.
On top of that, Stanford's
women have won 59 straight dual
matches. If they keep it up, they
could eventually surpass the 88
consecutive wins of John
Wooden's UCLA basketball teams.
Not, of course, if the Bruins
have any say in the matter. Two
years and five days ago, UCLA
visited the Cardinal at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium and walked
off with a 6-3 victory. The Car
dinal has avenged that defeat on
five separate occasions since then
— including last year's NCAA
championship final — but it has
not always been easy.
Just two weeks ago at the
UCLA Tennis Center, the Bruins

pushed the Cardinal to the limit
before Stanford escaped with a
5-4 victory. It was one of the
closest matches since the streak
began.
USC has threatened the Cardi
nal along the way as well, and
historically is the more significant
rival. Since 1977, Stanford has
won seven national champion
ships. The Trojans have won five.
A look at some of the highlights
of action between the two schools
in recent years:

April 15, 1988: UCLA at Stanford
An ordinary match between the
two schools. Teri Whitlinger is
double-bageled by UCLA fresh
man Kirsten Dreyer. Lisa Green
is hammered by another Bruin
frosh, Jessica Emmons. The
teams are tied 3-3 after singles.
In doubles, though, its all
UCLA. The Bruins sweep all three
matches to record the victory.
Stanford would not lose again un
til ...


Tracy Allen — Dally file
Meredith McGrath hopes that is only a freshman, but as the No. 2 singles player for the Cardinal
she knows how tough UCLA and (JSC are for Stanford traditionally. UCLA, the last team to beat the
streaking Cardinal, will visit Stanford Tennis Stadium today.
April 8, 1989: Stanford at USC
The Cardinal is ahead 3-2 in
the match and Tami Whitlinger
is in big trouble at No. 1 singles.
The Trojans' Trisha Laux holds
a 5-1 lead in the third set.
If the nation's top player calls
it a day, the match will be tied
at 3-3 and Stanford vail need to
win two of the three doubles con
tests without its No. 1 doubles
team of Tami and Teri Whitlinger.
Whitlinger thought to herself:
"I have to start whaling. I have
to put away as many balls as I
can." She knew she had to end
the points quickly and win them
as well. Suddenly it was 5-2. Then

5-3. 5-4. 5-5. 6-5, Whitlinger
leading. Laux tied it at 6-6, but
Whitlinger triumphed in the tie
breaker. The Cardinal went on to
win the match 6-3.
April 23, 1989: USC at Stanford
Two weeks after Whitlinger
turned the lights out on Laux,
the excitement is at the other end
of the lineup in the No. 6 singles
match.
For the Trojans, the combatant
is Caroline Kuhlman. Once the
top player in all collegiate tennis,
Kuhlman needed surgery to
repair both knees and had to sit
out a year.
Now a first-year business stu
dent, she is trying to resume her
tennis career. For Stanford, steady
freshman Kylie Johnson is in
there.

After a two-hour rain delay
before the match, play begins only
to be suspended for another 75
minutes. When the action
resumes, Kuhlman closes out the
first set. But Johnson rebounds
quickly to move up 5-2 in the
second set.
"Then I did a nice little choke
job," she said. She was referring
to the fact she allowed Kuhlman
to seize the lead and serve for the
match at 6-5. But Johnson wasn't
finished yet. She breaks
Kuhlman's serve and wins the tie
breaker 7-3.
Coming up with dazzling
serves, Johnson jumps ahead 5-1
in the third set. Kuhlman saves
two match points at 5-2 and draws
to within 5-3. In the next game,
Johnson breaks Kuhlman and
gets the victory.
