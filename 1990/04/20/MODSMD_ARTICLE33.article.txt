# Crew hosts top Eastern teams
## Defending champ Radcliffe will challenge Stanford 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Crew is one of the most under
rated spectator sports in this
country.
Everybody's spring fantasy
seems to be lounging around and
catching some sun. This thought
becomes even better when that
lounging is accomplished beside
some body of water. The Redwood
Shores Crew Classic can give you
that fantasy, and in the process
expose some of the best collegiate
competition this side of the
NCAAs.
"I don't know what is going to
happen out there," said Princeton
women's Coach Curtis Jorden.
This comes from a man whose
team is ranked No. 1 in the East,
a position in the world of crew
that more often than not ends up
being No. 1 in the country.
Jorden has reason to be scared.
Cornell, last year's national cham
pion will be there, as will Yale,
ranked No. 3 in the East this
year. UCLA, who won the San
Diego Crew Classic two weeks ago,
will be looking to continue its
strong early season showing.
The team that Stanford has to
most worry about, though, is the
team it will meet first. Radcliffe
won at Redwood Shores last year
by barely beating out the Cardi
nal. They went on to win the East

ern Sprints (beating Cornell), but
opted to go to England instead of
the NCAAs.
Stanford coach John Davis says
his crew rows well against
Radcliffe, and is looking forward
to the chance to face them.
"It's an intense rivalry," said
Davis. "They won't take us lightly
and we won't take them lightly.
We have a good chance of beating
them, but they probably think the
same thing about us."
The Redwood Shores racing for
mat highlights head-to-head com
petition. Every crew is guaranteed
three races. The first round has
randomly-selected pairings, the
second round has winners bat
tling winners and losers battling
losers, and the final "shirt race"
round has teams matched accord
ing to record. The crew with the
best record wins.
Stanford hopes to challenge for

that position again this year. In
an effort to get there, Davis has
been working on his team's ag
gression and starting ability.
"We are rowing more aggres
sively now," Davis said. "You need
to be aggressive and assertive, you
can't be tentative. Our starts are
improved, we want to make sure
we nail it right away."
The men's team hopes they can
do the same. After a disappointing
showing at San Diego, the men's
varsity has changed both its
make-up and its tactics.
"We have the same people in
the boat, (we have just) shaken
up our line-up," captain Andy
Winden said.
The Cardinal faces Yale in the
first round on Saturday, a team
that is having "a good year" ac
cording to Stanford Coach Ken
Dreyfuss. In hopes of overcoming
this eastern power, Dreyfuss has
changed the team's race plan.
"We have never performed
really well in the beginning (of a
race)," Winden said. "We are used
to coming back gradually. Coach
has us now sprinting very early
in the race."
"I think we are faster than we
were two weeks ago," Dreyfuss
said. "We are trying to get better
every week and get better at the
end of the year. We are ready for
a test, ready to find out where
we are."
