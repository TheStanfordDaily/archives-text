How important is home
cooking? It seems to depend on
who you ask.
For the men's golf team, com
petition on the Stanford Golf
Course in its fall event cul
minated with a tournament title
last October.
As play commences in today's
opening round of the Cardinal
Invitational, the squad seeks to
translate its knowledge of the
intricacies of its home Stanford
course into its first team victory
of 1990.
While its seems logical that a
home team would enjoy an ad
vantage competing in familiar
surroundings, Coach Wally
Goodwin discounted the
benefits provided by playing
host to a tourney.
"I think that the home course
advantage is often exaggerated.
There is added pressure that
comes from playing in front of
your family and friends," he
said.
Sophomore Christian Cevaer
echoed Goodwin's appraisal,
feeling that if the Cardinal
linksters are victorious this
weekend, it will have little to
do with playing at home.
"Playing here is not as im
portant a factor as many people

believe. Like all the other teams,
we don't know where the pins
are going to be placed. We really
don't gain that much by playing
at home," he said.
Perhaps more important than
where this event takes place is
the format of the tournament.
Today's 36-hole round will chal
lenge the team's physical
stamina, which came under
scrutiny after its performance
last week in the Fresno Classic.
The Cardinal seemed sluggish
in the afternoon round of a 36-
hole day, leading Goodwin to
question his squad's con
ditioning. Nevertheless, the vet
eran coach was confidently op
timistic about how his players
will respond to today's full slate
of golf.
"We had a 36-hole qualifying
round and everybody played
well on the final 18," Goodwin
said. "1 think we're prepared
physically, and since we an

win the tournament, we'll be
especially motivated."
From the qualifying process,
Cevaer, junior Johan Rem
melgas, and a trio of seniors
emerged to represent Stanford.
Don Christiansen, Marc Fun
seth and Brad Greer will seek to
guide the team to its fourth title
of the season and its ninth con
secutive top-ten finish.
The event marks the return
of Cevaer from the Cardinal
line-up after a one-tournament
hiatus from the Fresno tourney,
for which he failed to qualify
The sophomore, who has con
sistently been the team's best
performer over the past two
years, expressed enthusiasm for
today's opening round. "My
confidence in my game has re
turned and I've been swinging
well lately," he said. "I'm
looking forward to playing again
competitively this weekend."
