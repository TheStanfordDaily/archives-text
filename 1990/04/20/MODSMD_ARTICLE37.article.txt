# Standing tall for Stanford nine
## Sophomore catcher Troy Tallman puts frosh woes behind him, directs Cardinal into Six-Pac lead 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
" Imagine you're one of the best high
school catchers in the U.S. of A. Scouts
are going crazy over you. You 're on the
all-state team not once, but twice. Base
ball America says you 're the seventh-best
prospect in the land.
You decide to put the pros off for a
while and head to college. Where? Where
else but the school that just won its
second straight national title — a school
whose starting catcher just graduated.
Just imagine: It's so perfect. You're
going to play for one of the best teams
in the country, at one of the best schools
around. Imagine how lucky you are.
Imagine how good you 're going to be.
Imagine spending a year in hell.
Sometimes, even the most painful ex
periences can lead to something good.
Nineteen eighty-nine, which was the
worst season in years for the Stanford
baseball team, was also the worst season
of Troy Tallman's life.
Tallman, who came to Stanford in
the fall of 1988 as one of the most
highly-touted players in the country,
never dreamed that last season would
turn out the way it did, for either him
or his team. The Cardinal struggled all
year long, could never get any momen
tum until the final weeks of the season,
and eventually would have to write the
campaign off as a learning experience.
And Tallman, who ended up platoon
ing throughout the season with junior
Eric Cox, had an absolutely miserable
year — especially at the plate. After
hitting .390 in nigh school, Tallman
went 14-for-93 in his first collegiate
season. That's .151.
A nightmare? Yes. A year to be for
gotten? No way.
"1 think it was good," Tallman says.

"I think it was real good. I'm like most
guys who come in here: All through
high school and up to that point they'd
never struggled in baseball, and last
year was by far the worst year I'd ever
had.
"It gave me the chance to evaluate
what I wanted to do in the game and
how much it meant to me," Tallman
says. "As bad as last season was, I
learned to try and pick out the positives.
There aren't too many positives in hit
ting a buck eighty, but what there were
I tried to pick out. I think that's helped
me this year, to not dwell on the nega
tives so much."
Of course, it's easy to be rational
about bad things that happened long
ago, and Tallman admits that at the
time he wasn't too thrilled about the
whole situation. "I have a tendency of
getting down on myself," he says,"and
that makes everything worse because

baseball's so mental. Mentally I was a
mess last year. I've been trying to keep
that from carrying over to this year,
and I think I've been pretty successful
at it."
To say the least. After struggling
through the first part of this season —
Tall man was batting .183 on March 24
— the sophomore catcher has exploded
in the last four weeks: In his last 11
games, Tallman has hit .421 (16-for-38)
to raise his average 83 points.
And, headed into this weekend's series
at Arizona, Tallman is riding a career
high seven-game hitting streak, during
which he's hitting .400 with two homers
— raising his season total to five —
and 10 RBI, giving him 17 on the year.
Last weekend, he hit home runs in two
straight games.
What gives? "I don't know,"says Tall-

Troy Tattman came to Stanford last season as the seventh-best prospect in the
nation, but struggled in his rookie year. The Cardinal backstop has turned It around
this year, hitting .421 in his last 11 games.
