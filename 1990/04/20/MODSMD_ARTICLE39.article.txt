# Hombrecher wrecks the competition for Cardinal netters
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Seeing freshman Alexis Hombrecher
serve is kind of like watching a 6-foot-5
slinky explode.
In the beginning, the serve seems like
any other. The ball toss is normal. The
way Hombrecher slowly slides up his
right leg to meet his left is standard.
But all of the sudden, the slinky in
Hombrecher takes over. He coils, ben
ding his knees so far down that they
nearly scrape the court's surface. Then
he springs, putting every ounce of his
towering 6-5 frame into pounding the
tiny ball into the service court.
The result is a 120-mile per hour
rocket that represents one of the biggest
— albeit most unusual — serves in the
world of tennis.
"I couldn't believe it when I saw it
on video camera," Hombrecher said. "I
couldn't believe how far down I got."
His opponents believe it, though, as
Hombrecher has used his serve time
and time again to escape from tight
situations. "When I'm serving well, I'm
playing well. It's the shot I call on in
the crunch," he said.
According to Hombrecher, the serve
just sort of "came about." "No one
taught me to serve that way," Hombrec
her said. "It was my own invention."
But, as Hombrecher will tell you, the
serve is not perfect.
"I used to serve mainly a big first
[serve] and then kick the second one
into the court. Lately, I've been trying
to mix it up more. I'll slice it sometimes.
Maybe I'll kick a hard [first serve] in
there. It's kind of like pitching .. .you
try to keep your opponent off balance."
Hombrecher came to Stanford with
tennis creditials almost as impressive
as his serve. In 1989, he won the United
States Tennis Association's 18-and
under Hard Court singles championship
and was ranked in the top five in the
18-and-under junior division. In addi
tion, Hombrecher was the top-ranked
men's player in Northern California.
Two weekends ago Hombrecher
reached the semifinals of the Securities
Classic, a professional tournament in
Orlando, Fla. He admits that sometimes

it is hard to return from a professional
tournament and mentally prepare to
play No. 6 singles for the best college
team in the country.
"At a professional tournament, it's
easy to get psyched," Hombrecher said.
"When you play No. 6 singles, a lot of
times you are playing a guy who is not
quite as good as you are used to. You
don't want to lose. The team is counting
on you. But it's still hard to always get
into it."
Hombrecher said he definitely won't
have that problem this weekend when
the team travels to Los Angeles to play
USC today and UCLA on Saturday. "I
am going to be really up for those match
es. I always like a good challenge," he
said.
It will be a good challenge, indeed, as
two of the Cardinal's top three singles
players, No. 1-ranked Jonathan Stark
and No. 3-ranked Jared Palmer, are
injured.
Despite the injuries, Hombrecher still
thinks Stanford should win. "I think
the most important thing is that every
one concentrates on their own match
and not worry about what is happening
on the other courts," he said. "We aren't
like a lot of other teams where the No.
1 guy is way better than the No. 6 guy.
We are solid all the way through, and
we are extremely deep. I think, if we
concentrate, we should beat those guys."
Hombrecher spent the first 12 years
of his life in Germany. Both his parents

are German. But, according to
Hombrecher, his success in tennis took
place after he moved to Suisun, Ca. at
age 12.
Hombrecher always has been a serve
and-volleyer. "I was always pretty big,
and big guys are supposed to serve and
volley."
Since coming to Stanford, Hombrec
her has spent most of his time refining
two weaknesses: his return of serve and
his baseline game. According to Coach
Dick Gould, Hombrecher also is working
on the mental side of his game.
"He's one of the best big-man athletes
I have ever had," Gould said. "He is
very well coached in the fundamentals.
His biggest challenge right now is learn
ing how to sustain pressure on his op
ponent. He has unlimited potential.
Hombrecher said he loves playing for
Stanford. "There are so many great ath
letes and great guys on our team. It's
really inspiring to be on the court with
a team that is so good. Every practice
is challenging," Hombrecher said.
Hombrecher is sure that his future
will include professional tennis. "I
definitely will play professionally, but
I'm not sure when. When the time is
right, I guess," Hombrecher said.
"For some reason, Coach [Gould] put
us together, and it worked out really
well. Against Utah, we were both down
[after losing our singles matches]. But
we got ourselves going. So far, he's the
guy I've played best with."
