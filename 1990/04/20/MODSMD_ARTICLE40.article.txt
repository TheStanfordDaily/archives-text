SATURDAY - 1 p m. at UCLA
RECORD - Stanford (19 1, 8-1 in Pac-10 Southern Division play, ranked No. 1 by the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings).
INJURIES — Stanford's No. 1-ranked singles player, freshman Jonathan Stark, has a
stress fracture in his left foot and will not play. Freshman Jared Palmer is still
recovering from knee surgery. He will not play singles but may play doubles
BARRY'S BACK — Team captain Barry Richards will play No. 6 singles for the Cardinal
on this weekend's road trip. The senior compiled a 14-3 record playing at No. 6 last
year.
PREVIOUS DUALS - Stanford clobbered UCLA 5-1 and USC 5-1 April 6-7. The only
loss in the UCLA match came at No 3 singles when Palmer was forced to default
because of knee problems.
NOTES — According to Stanford Coach Dick Gould, if the Cardinal wins both of these
weekend matches, he "will be the happiest man alive," Stanford lost to both USC
and UCLA last year when the team traveled to Los Angeles.
