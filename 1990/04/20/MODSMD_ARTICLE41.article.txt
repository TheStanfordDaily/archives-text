# Cardinal prepares to qualify
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
You might think that with Big
Meet at California just a week
away, the Cardinal track and field
team would be standing on their
toes in eager anticipation, looking
right over this weekend's Stanford
Collegiate Open. But they're not
exactly pigeonholing tomorrow's
meet at Stanford Stadium, either.
Before last week's Stanford
Classic, Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
spoke of a team goal to qualify
about 30 athletes for the Pacific
10 Conference meet. After a few
qualified at that meet, the Car
dinal now has 19 qualified for
Pac-lOs — nine men and 10 wom
en.
"These two weeks are our main
qualifying period of the year," said
Chisam yesterday, referring to the
meets of last weekend and this
weekend. "We're hoping for eight
to 10 to qualify this week."
He added that a few will be
looking to qualify for NCAAs.
Many Cardinal athletes are al
ready very close to qualifying and

will be going all-out tomorrow in
an effort to trim that fraction of
a second or add those few inches
to ensure themselves a spot at
the Pac-10 or — in a few cases
— the NCAA Championships.
However, as a precautionary
measure against injuries before
the all-important California meet,
some team members may run off
events. "We certainly won't double
or triple events," Chisam noted.
"Especially sprinters. At Cal some
people will be competing in three,
four events; we can't afford inju
ries at this time."
Two keys for Stanford's Big
Meet and postseason success will
be back on the track tomorrow
— seniors Peter Kolotouros and

Tim Collins, both sprinter/
hurdlers. After sitting out most
of the season with injuries, the
two rejoin the Cardinal just in
time for the big time.
Stanford's hurdlers have been
a weak point for the team so far
this year, after a series of injuries
ravaged the squad. Redshirt
freshman Kyle Coachman has
been forced to bear all of the hur
dling duties since early in the
season, and he has been strug
gling to regain his form after sit
ting out last season with a foot
injury.
Kolotouros, who has had ham
string problems, qualified for Pac
10s in the 110-meter hurdles early
in the season and may run that
event and the 400-meter hurdles
tomorrow.
Collins, on the other hand, has
not competed yet this year, and
the team is oveijoyed to have him
back. "Tim is the backbone of our
sprint and hurdle crew," said
Chisam.
Tomorrow's meet will be the
last chance to see the Cardinal in
action on their own oval.
