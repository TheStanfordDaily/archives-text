# Amoroso vaults into NCAAs
## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
The season ended two weeks
ago for the rest of the Stanford
women's gymnastics team, but
senior co-captain Dina Amoroso,
for the third year in a row, has
prolonged her season.
Amoroso qualified for the
NCAA Championships in the
all-around and will be compet
ing tonight and possibly
tomorrow in Corvalis, Ore.
Stanford Coach Breck Green
wood expressed mixed feelings
about traveling to the champi
onships with an individual in
stead of a team. "I would rather
be going with the entire team
because that's what the cham
pionships are all about, but it's
more relaxing to go with an in
dividual."
Because she was the fifth

highest individual all-around
qualifier, she will rotate with
Nebraska, the No. 5 team in
the meet. She will perform after
all of the Cornhuskers on each
event.
Performing last on the events,
combined with the fact that she
will be competing in the late
session today, will improve her
chances of earning higher marks
from the judges. This is due to
the tendency of the judges to
save the highest marks for last.
Amoroso has only made a few
changes in her routines from
regular-season competition, but
one of those changes is quite
noticeable. After performing a
layout Tsukahara for most of
the season, she may unveil a
new vault for her final compe
tition.
The Tsukahara consists of a
half-twist before blocking the

horse, then a backwards sumer
sault and a half before landing.
The new vault, which is worth
three-tenths of a point more,
adds a half- twist to the som
ersault.
"We had to change something
for her to make All-American,"
Greenwood explained.
If all goes well today, Amoroso
has a chance to make the vault
ing finals tomorrow. In addi
tion, her consistency on balance
beam, combined with the jitters
that other less-experienced gym
nasts may feel, could land her
a spot in the beam finals. In
order to make the event finals,
she must be one of the top eight
scorers on the apparatus.
Amoroso is not putting exces
sive pressure on herself, how
ever. "I just want to go to the
meet and have fun. I don't have
any big expectations."
