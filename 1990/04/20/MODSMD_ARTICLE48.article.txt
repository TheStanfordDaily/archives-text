# Committee on the Professoriate:
## Lift 10 percent cap on non-tenure-line faculty 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Amid substantial opposition
and mild confusion, the Commit
tee on the Professoriate presented
its recommendations for the role
of non-tenure-line faculty at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Non-tenure-line faculty include
those professors who either re
search or teach — but not both
— and as a result are not eligible
for tenure.
The committee has been
deliberating for two years on the
structure and responsibility of
faculty. It intended its recommen
dations to clarify the role of
non-tenure-line faculty and
elucidate their prospects for
career development, a common
source of misunderstanding and
discontent, according to commit
tee chair Philip Hanawalt, profes
sor of biological sciences.
However, a number of faculty
expressed distress over the direc
tion of the proposals, fearing they
blurred the lines between tenure
track and non-tenure track pro

feasors.
The committee's recommenda
tion to lift the current stipulation
that only 10 percent of faculty
appointments made be for non
tenure-line positions met opposi
tion from several faculty,
including Philosophy Prof. Mi
chael Bratman.
"When we have a percentage
cap it's a way of making it clear
that we are committing ourselves
to a researcher-teacher para
digm," he said.
Hanawalt rebutted by saying
that 10 percent was an arbitrary
figure, and establishing control at
the provost level was a more ef
fective way of limiting the number
of non-tenure-line people hired
into the faculty.
In an unofficial voice vote, the
senate split on the issue.
The faculty also split in its sup
port of the committee's recom
mendation to create the new
position of research assistant pro
fessor, which would, in effect, give
principal investigator status to
non-tenure-line faculty.
A principal investigator over

sees faculty research projects.
The committee also recom
mended dropping the research and
teaching designations in everyday
usage.
Currently, non-tenure-line fac
ulty have official titles such as
professor (research) or professor
(teaching).
The committee further recom
mended phasing out the rank of
associate professor (research) and
standardizing search procedures
for finding non-tenure-line and
tenure-line faculty.
These two recommendations re
ceived unanimous support in the
unofficial vote.
The senate heard only the first
five of the committee's 12 recom
mendations and postponed taking
formal action until all the recom
mendations have been discussed.
The senate is scheduled to dis
cuss the committee's remaining
recommendations at its May 3
meeting.
In a follow-up to his April 5
annual address to the Academic
Council, University President
Donald Kennedy said he plans to

hold discussions with department
chairs about fulfilling the respon
sibilities of undergraduate teach
ing.
He also urged the faculty to
begin thinking about how teach
ing can be more accurately as
sessed and rewarded, just as good
research is.
In other business, Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley called at
tention to the Webb Ranch
workers and their continuing bout
with poverty, despite a recent col
lective bargaining agreement.
He suggested the University
take a portion of the rent it col
lects from the Webbs and turn it
over to the workers to be used
for their children's education, a
health plan or housing improve
ments.
Kennedy responded that al
locating rental profits was prema
ture since lease negotiations
between Stanford and the Webbs
have not yet begun.
"We don't know what the rent
will be," he said, "or whether
there's even going to be a lease."
