# Aftershocks serve as haunting reminder of quake damage
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Six months after one of the worst seis
mic jolts in U.S. history, campus concern
over earthquakes has been shaken to life
as people realize the effects of the Loma
Prieta quake are not yet ready for the
history books.
A sense of normalcy took hold of the
campus as news accounts of the Oct. 17
quake became less frequent. The campus'
quake damage was slowly assessed, and
after a few weeks the sight of prefabri
cated modulars, wooden support braces
and cyclone fences became commonplace.
But fading memories of the 7.1 quake,

which took more than 60 lives and shook
scores of buildings from their founda
tions, were resurrected this week.
Reports of earthquakes in Southern
California, Indiana and China on Tues
day — the six-month anniversary of the
Loma Prieta temblor — served as eerie
precursors to the string of jolts that rolled
through the Bay Area on Wednesday —
the anniversary of the catastrophic San
Francisco earthquake of 1906.
Geologists said Wednesday that the
early-morning quakes were aftershocks
of the October tremor. The scores of slip
ping fault lines around the world and in
the Bay Area have once again cast the
spotlight on earthquakes.

As many members of
the University commu
nity deal with memories
and fears revived this
week, the most recent
temblors serve as a re
minder that certain sec
tors of the Stanford
community are still
dealing with the effects
of October's earthquke.

One of the hardest hit parts of the
University, besides its buildings, was its
budget. University administrators have
kept busy over the past, months pushing
to get outside funding to heal Stanford's
structural wounds.

The Provost's Office
and Facilities Project
Management are eagerly
eyeing money from the
Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency to help
the University reach its
goal of $140 million in
quake relief funds.
Curt Williams, director
of Facilities Project Man-

agement, said the federal relief agency
gives approval of funds on a project-by
project basis.
Stanford has already received $1.5 mil
lion to go ahead with work on the Grad
uate School of Business. But the

University is still lobbying for another
$50 million to cover the costs of
reconstruction in the Quad and
strengthening of several Row Houses, he
said.
Williams said the Wilbur, Galvez and
Roble modulars that serve as classrooms
and office space will be up for at least
two years. He added that there has been
"not a lot of actual construction" on
campus because of the need to secure
funding and to draw up plans for the
work that each site requires.
That means the Quad will continue to
lean on its wooden braces and be sec-

tioned off by fences for an un
determined amount of time.
Meanwhile, Stanford is finding
and using other sources for
money. The University is dipping
into some general facilities funds
and is also relying on some limited
fund raising, Williams said.
Provost James Rosse, who two
months ago announced major
budget cuts, finds himself trying
to simultaneously fix up campus
and present a balanced budget.
He said the budget for next year
was drawn up in anticipation of
some money from the federal
relief agency. Without those funds
Stanford would have to dip even
further into its already lean
budget, he said.
According to Asst. Provost John
Hughes, inspectors recruited by
the federal relief agency were
working in the Quad this week.
The agency does not follow any
specific schedule in its funding,
but it will decide on a figure in
the next few weeks, said Rosse.
Mental health officials on
campus said the Oct. 17 earth
quake displaced students both
physically and mentally.

Immediately after the October
quake students reported feeling
"wired" and "angry." Six months
later it is hard to determine ex
actly how much the Loma Prieta
quake or this week's quakes are
responsible for students' con
cerns.
Doug Daher, acting director of
Counseling and Psychological
Services, said he does not know
to what degree the earthquakes
are still on people's minds. But,
he added, the quakes are perhaps
contributing to some students
feeling greater stress than normal
because they have to contend with
the disruptive effects of the
quakes.
Daher said CAPS' goal when
counseling students is to let them
know that "feeling atypical is nor
mal" some days or weeks after a
quake.
For the more than 200 students
whose houses were damaged in
the October quake, Wednesday's
tremors were not a welcome
event. Interviews with a number
of the quake "refugees" showed
that their thoughts about the past
six months are varied.

Some students said their mem
ory of the quake does not fade.
Third-year graduate student
Zander Brietzke said, "I still think
about the quake all the time."
Brietzke said from his off
campus apartment that he is
reminded of the quake because
he does not regularly see his
friends from Phi Psi House, closed
after the earthquake.
"The most devastating thing
about a quake is that you can't
prepare for it," Brietzke said.
Some students, however, said
they had put memories of the
shaking behind them. Senior Jen
nifer Morrison said her maxim of
"just eryoy yourself' helped her
deal with the post-quake effects.
Morrison, who had to move out
of quake-damaged Roth House,
said for her the outcome of the
quake turned out for the best be
cause she ergoys having a single
room.
For some, the quakes have
raised awareness of tragedies in
other parts of the world. Junior
Rob Robbins, who had to leave
the battered Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity house, said his experience

made him realize that "Stanford
can be a bubble," protecting
people from realizing or caring
about events on the outside.
Both on-campus and off
campus students expressed con
cern that the big jolt in October
might eliminate some of the spots
in this year's Draw next month.
But Housing Center officials said
that despite the destruction of
hundreds of spaces around
campus, the quake will have no
effect on housing for undergrad
uate students.
Rodger Whitney, director of the
Housing Center, said that by
searching for new possible living
spaces and placing a higher num
ber of undergraduates in rooms
than originally planned, Stanford
will have the same number of
housing spots as last year.
Single graduate students are
not as lucky, however. Depending
on the demand for housing among
that group, there could be up to
150 fewer spaces on campus for
them because some undergradu
ate students will be moving into
traditional graduate student
spots, said Whitney.
