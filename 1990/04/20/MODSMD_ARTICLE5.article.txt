# Aftershocks serve as haunting reminder of quake damage
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Six months after one of the worst seis
mic jolts in U.S. history, campus concern
over earthquakes has been shaken to life
as people realize the effects of the Loma
Prieta quake are not yet ready for the
history books.
A sense of normalcy took hold of the
campus as news accounts of the Oct. 17
quake became less frequent. The campus'
quake damage was slowly assessed, and
after a few weeks the sight of prefabri
cated modulars, wooden support braces
and cyclone fences became commonplace.
But fading memories of the 7.1 quake,

which took more than 60 lives and shook
scores of buildings from their founda
tions, were resurrected this week.
Reports of earthquakes in Southern
California, Indiana and China on Tues
day — the six-month anniversary of the
Loma Prieta temblor — served as eerie
precursors to the string of jolts that rolled
through the Bay Area on Wednesday —
the anniversary of the catastrophic San
Francisco earthquake of 1906.
Geologists said Wednesday that the
early-morning quakes were aftershocks
of the October tremor. The scores of slip
ping fault lines around the world and in
the Bay Area have once again cast the
spotlight on earthquakes.

As many members of
the University commu
nity deal with memories
and fears revived this
week, the most recent
temblors serve as a re
minder that certain sec
tors of the Stanford
community are still
dealing with the effects
of October's earthquke.

One of the hardest hit parts of the
University, besides its buildings, was its
budget. University administrators have
kept busy over the past, months pushing
to get outside funding to heal Stanford's
structural wounds.

The Provost's Office
and Facilities Project
Management are eagerly
eyeing money from the
Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency to help
the University reach its
goal of $140 million in
quake relief funds.
Curt Williams, director
of Facilities Project Man-

agement, said the federal relief agency
gives approval of funds on a project-by
project basis.
Stanford has already received $1.5 mil
lion to go ahead with work on the Grad
uate School of Business. But the

University is still lobbying for another
$50 million to cover the costs of
reconstruction in the Quad and
strengthening of several Row Houses, he
said.
Williams said the Wilbur, Galvez and
Roble modulars that serve as classrooms
and office space will be up for at least
two years. He added that there has been
"not a lot of actual construction" on
campus because of the need to secure
funding and to draw up plans for the
work that each site requires.
That means the Quad will continue to
lean on its wooden braces and be sec-
