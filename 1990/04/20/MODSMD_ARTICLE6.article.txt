# Research hampers teaching emphasis
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Because the University fundamen
tally favors achievement in research
during tenure evaluations, the current
faculty review process may interfere
with the renewed commitment to teach
ing recently espoused by University
President Donald Kennedy.
Scholarship — which includes re
search and publication — and teaching
are the two most important considera
tions during reviews of faculty for
promotion to tenured positions,
according to Kathryn Gillam, assistant
dean of academic affairs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
However, the established criteria for
tenure promotions, which include let

ters of evaluation from students, faculty
and world exports in the field, place at
least slightly more emphasis on schol
arly research than on teaching skills.
According to stated policy, faculty
promoted to tenured positions must be
"excellent scholars," while they must be
only "very good to excellent teachers,"
Gillam explained.
Kennedy agrees research is weighted
"perhaps somewhat more than it ought
to be" compared with teaching during

reviews for tenure, primarily because
research evaluations can be more ob
jective than teaching evaluations.
Naturally, faculty members are well
aware of this bias toward research in
the tenure reviews. According to Assoc.
Biological Sciences Prof. Sharon Long,
"When you come down to tenure posi
tions, research is the final and most
difficult measure of a person's scholarly
aptitude."
Further, a recently tenured faculty
member, who wished to remain name
less, went so far as to claim that teach
ing does not matter at all in the tenure
selection process.
Altogether, the tenure evaluation
process itself seems to offer few direct
incentives to achieve excellence in
teaching — especially if research
were to suffer as a consequence.
"I don't think students would
want us to sacrifice research in
science and cutting-edge technol
ogy for an incremental improve
ment in teaching quality," said
Steven Gorelick, associate profes
sor of applied earth sciences.
Even if promotions to tenure
reflect more concern for research
achievement than for teaching
abilities, professors believe quality
of instruction remains first-class.
For example, the faculty mem
ber who discounted the influence
of teaching in tenure promotions
also said Stanford professors are
undeniably committed to superb
instruction for students.
One reason for such high
calib; instruction, according to
Long, is that "people care tremen
dously about teaching; it is taken
so seriously now."
And, as Assoc. English Prof.
Barbara Gelpi explained, out
standing research and
outstanding teaching should not
be considered mutually exclusive.
She said, "This is not an either/or
situation."
Instead, research and teaching
are frequently viewed as comple

mentary activities, each benefiting
both professor and student. "Stu
dents are best served by profes
sors actively engaged in pursuit
of knowledge themselves," said
Asst. Provost for Faculty Affairs
Noel Kolak.
In addition, a strong research
background in a given field may
be essential for effective instruc
tion of advanced topics. According
to Assoc. Biological Sciences Prof.
Richard Scheller, "If one is not a
world-class researcher, it is im
possible to teach the type of
course students at Stanford ex
pect."
Because Scheller considers
teaching and research to be "two
phases of one job," he said he
sees little reason to change the
tenure evaluation system. In his
view, excellence in one area
usually correlates with excellence
in the other, since "teaching and
research go hand in hand."
Nevertheless, Kennedy said he
hopes to give teaching abilities a
greater role in the tenure evalu
ation process "by finding better
ways of reflecting significant
teaching accomplishments."
In the meantime, said Long,
"Inspirational speeches like the
one Kennedy gave are important,
because even if we can't get it (an
actual plan for improving under
graduate education) down on
paper, the encouragement gets
everyone trying."
