# Kennedy, panelists explore models of multiculturalism

"Multiculturalism" may have been
stripped of its original meaning by
repeated use, University President
Donald Kennedy said at a forum last
night.
A true multicultural Stanford com
munity, Kennedy said, should not be a
melting pot — a "smoothly blended
sauce in which no ingredient could be
successfully recognized." Instead, it
should be a gumbo stew in which the
ingredients are mixed "artistically, pleas

ingly, and yet can be identified," he told
an audience of about 60 in Terman Au
ditorium
"If we cannot succeed here" at Stan
ford with pluralism, Kennedy said, "we
cannot succeed anywhere."
In addition, Kennedy emphasized the
University's commitment to pluralism
and said current budget cuts will not
"unwrap all the progress we have al
ready made."
The University's pluralistic commit
ment has not changed, he said in his
welcome address for the panel dis
cussion and question-and-answer
session. He added that the "first
priority over the next few months
will be to place displaced employ
ees and monitor the overall staff
reduction process so it is fair and
mindful of our existing diversity."
Office of Residential Affairs
multicultural programmer Greg
Ricks pointed out that every
Council of Presidents slate in the
ASSU elections put multicul
turalism as its top agenda item
and that there is "a lot of excite
ment about multicultural educa
tion."

He said a backlash against
pluralism has arisen because
white students feel they cannot
question multicultural ideals
without being labelled racist,
sexist or homophobic. Therefore,
most remain silent, Ricks said.
He said future orientation pro
grams such as "The Fire Within"
must also be inclusive of the
majority ethnic experience — Eu
ropean heritage — and should of
fer a dialogue between all ethnic
groups.
Faye McNair-Knox, vice chair
and director of research for the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues, said its purpose was
to "catalyze" responses from the
community and not to "cover the
range of problematic aspects."
McNair-Knox, who is assistant

director of the African and Afro-
American Studies Program, also
said that curriculum must be the
primary means of bringing forth
multiculturalism.
The University needs to make
more of an effort to retain mi
nority faculty to whom "students
can relate" before these faculty
decide to take tenured positions
at other universities, said Frances
Morales, director of El Centro Chi
cano.
