# Possibility of COP runoff looms after weekend protest
## 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
At 1 o'clock this morning, after a
weekend of protests from Students First
party members, the ASSU Elections
Commission was still deliberating over
whether last week's Council of Presi
dents election results are valid.
Steve Krauss, ASSU elections com
missioner, decided Friday to disqualify
275 write-in ballots from the vote, thus
giving the victory to "Four Our Future,"
sponsored by the People's Platform, and
preventing a runoff.
The ruling immediately sparked an
uproar among the Students First mem
bers, who said after the election that
the ASSU Bylaws guarantee a runoff if
no slate receives a "majority of the votes
cast" in the COP race.
Krauss submitted a letter to The

Daily explaining the ruling but with
drew it late last night after Students
First members protested the ruling.
Krauss met late into the evening with
representatives of both slates, but
reached no decision.
Members of the COP slate "A Clean
Slate," sponsored by Students First, said
they are prepared to appeal to Univer
sity administrators if a runoff will not
occur. "If Krauss doesn't abide to what
he is supposed to, I don't think the
[People's Platform-dominated] senate
will hold him to the Bylaws," said Stu
dent First member Tim Marklein. "In
that case, our only recourse is through
the University administration."
If the write-in votes were reinstated,
the "Four Our Future" slate's share
would drop from 51 to 48 percent, and
a runoff would be required.
Krauss ruled Friday that the write-in

votes cannot count toward the election
because many of the written-in slates
were composed of fictional characters.
Krauss said it became impossible to
verify which students represented the
write-in slates receiving votes.
For example, a slate named the
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" gath
ered 28 votes but did not file a decla
ration of intent prior to the election.
"What is to prevent me, Jay (Tucker),
Ingrid (Nava) and Jamie (Green) from
saying we are the 'Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles'?" asked Goodwin Liu, a
member of the People's Platform slate,
referring to his running-mates.
The People's Platform slate agreed
with Krauss' initial ruling, saying that
votes for ineligible slates should not be
counted. The Students First slate is
