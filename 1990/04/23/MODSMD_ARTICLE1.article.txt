# Possibility of COP runoff looms after weekend protest
## 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
At 1 o'clock this morning, after a
weekend of protests from Students First
party members, the ASSU Elections
Commission was still deliberating over
whether last week's Council of Presi
dents election results are valid.
Steve Krauss, ASSU elections com
missioner, decided Friday to disqualify
275 write-in ballots from the vote, thus
giving the victory to "Four Our Future,"
sponsored by the People's Platform, and
preventing a runoff.
The ruling immediately sparked an
uproar among the Students First mem
bers, who said after the election that
the ASSU Bylaws guarantee a runoff if
no slate receives a "majority of the votes
cast" in the COP race.
Krauss submitted a letter to The

Daily explaining the ruling but with
drew it late last night after Students
First members protested the ruling.
Krauss met late into the evening with
representatives of both slates, but
reached no decision.
Members of the COP slate "A Clean
Slate," sponsored by Students First, said
they are prepared to appeal to Univer
sity administrators if a runoff will not
occur. "If Krauss doesn't abide to what
he is supposed to, I don't think the
[People's Platform-dominated] senate
will hold him to the Bylaws," said Stu
dent First member Tim Marklein. "In
that case, our only recourse is through
the University administration."
If the write-in votes were reinstated,
the "Four Our Future" slate's share
would drop from 51 to 48 percent, and
a runoff would be required.
Krauss ruled Friday that the write-in

votes cannot count toward the election
because many of the written-in slates
were composed of fictional characters.
Krauss said it became impossible to
verify which students represented the
write-in slates receiving votes.
For example, a slate named the
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" gath
ered 28 votes but did not file a decla
ration of intent prior to the election.
"What is to prevent me, Jay (Tucker),
Ingrid (Nava) and Jamie (Green) from
saying we are the 'Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles'?" asked Goodwin Liu, a
member of the People's Platform slate,
referring to his running-mates.
The People's Platform slate agreed
with Krauss' initial ruling, saying that
votes for ineligible slates should not be
counted. The Students First slate is
trying to "subvert" the election
through technicalities, Liu said.
"It's just a perversion of democ
racy for Students First to reverse
the election based on these tech
nicalities."
The COP race, in which the
People's Platform garnered 89
votes more than Students First,
was the closest in recent years.
The final tally was 2,616 to 2,539,
with 282 write-in votes and
several hundred abstentions.
The controversy erupted over
the interpretation of the Bylaws,
which do not explicitly say
whether ineligible write-in votes
should count in the final tally to
determine the number of votes
needed for a majority. But the
Students First slate points out
that the Bylaws yield to the
Robert's Rules of Order, in in
stances where the Bylaws are not
explicit. Robert's Rules states that
illegal votes by legal voters must
be counted to determine a
majority.
"Robert's Rules is suppose to
apply to deliberations, not general
elections," Liu countered.
But Krauss said that Robert's

Rules supports the position set
forth by the Students First slate
and that "the question that re
mains is whether or not the
Bylaws supersede Robert's Rules
of Order." If any discrepancy is
found between the two sets of
rules, the Bylaws take precedence.
"It is not our prerogative to
judge how serious students' votes
are," Krauss said. "They may
have seriously wanted four car
toon characters to rule over the
ASSU. Our concern was, we left
open the possibility of any four
students saying, 'We're the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.' "
Students First's Marklein
protested the decision, arguing
that a write-in vote, whether cast
for an existing candidate or not,
registers some opinion, even an
"opinion of dissatisfaction," and
therefore should be counted.
Lora Abe, a Students First slate
member, also argued that the
write-in ballots were a vote
against both major slates and
therefore should be counted.
Ed Sasaki, ASSU Senate chair,
pointed out that votes for in
eligible slates should not be
counted, as they represent "a cre
ative way of abstaining."
The Bylaws are not clear with
regard to write-in ballots. It is

simply stated: "The slate obtain
ing a mtgority of the votes cast
shall be certified as having been
elected as the Council of Presi
dents."
The Bylaws also state: "No can
didate or slate shall be elected to
office ... unless the appropriate
candidate, slate or sponsor has
filed an approved declaration of
intent with the Commission."
The Students First slate argued
that this does not prevent a write
in from participating in an elec
tion and having its vote counted.
Write-in slates included the
"Nurk Twins," "Hammer & Cof
fin," "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" and "Chaparral." These
four slates garnered 106 votes al
together. A few write-in ballots
did refer to actual students, but
since these students did not file
a declaration of intent before the
Friday deadline, the ballots were
also disqualified.
"If it were reasonable to run a
runoff election, we would do it,
regardless of the cost," said
Krauss.
However, Liu said, "We find it
difficult to swallow that a slate"
running on a platform of saving
money at the ASSU "would like
to force a runoff election that will
cost the student body $5,000."

referring to his running-mates.
The People's Platform slate agreed
with Krauss' initial ruling, saying that
votes for ineligible slates should not be
counted. The Students First slate is
trying to "subvert" the election
through technicalities, Liu said.
"It's just a perversion of democ
racy for Students First to reverse
the election based on these tech
nicalities."
The COP race, in which the
People's Platform garnered 89
votes more than Students First,
was the closest in recent years.
The final tally was 2,616 to 2,539,
with 282 write-in votes and
several hundred abstentions.
The controversy erupted over
the interpretation of the Bylaws,
which do not explicitly say
whether ineligible write-in votes
should count in the final tally to
determine the number of votes
needed for a majority. But the
Students First slate points out
that the Bylaws yield to the
Robert's Rules of Order, in in
stances where the Bylaws are not
explicit. Robert's Rules states that
illegal votes by legal voters must
be counted to determine a
majority.
"Robert's Rules is suppose to
apply to deliberations, not general
elections," Liu countered.
But Krauss said that Robert's

Rules supports the position set
forth by the Students First slate
and that "the question that re
mains is whether or not the
Bylaws supersede Robert's Rules
of Order." If any discrepancy is
found between the two sets of
rules, the Bylaws take precedence.
"It is not our prerogative to
judge how serious students' votes
are," Krauss said. "They may
have seriously wanted four car
toon characters to rule over the
ASSU. Our concern was, we left
open the possibility of any four
students saying, 'We're the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.' "
Students First's Marklein
protested the decision, arguing
that a write-in vote, whether cast
for an existing candidate or not,
registers some opinion, even an
"opinion of dissatisfaction," and
therefore should be counted.
Lora Abe, a Students First slate
member, also argued that the
write-in ballots were a vote
against both major slates and
therefore should be counted.
Ed Sasaki, ASSU Senate chair,
pointed out that votes for in
eligible slates should not be
counted, as they represent "a cre
ative way of abstaining."
The Bylaws are not clear with
regard to write-in ballots. It is

simply stated: "The slate obtain
ing a mtgority of the votes cast
shall be certified as having been
elected as the Council of Presi
dents."
The Bylaws also state: "No can
didate or slate shall be elected to
office ... unless the appropriate
candidate, slate or sponsor has
filed an approved declaration of
intent with the Commission."
The Students First slate argued
that this does not prevent a write
in from participating in an elec
tion and having its vote counted.
Write-in slates included the
"Nurk Twins," "Hammer & Cof
fin," "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" and "Chaparral." These
four slates garnered 106 votes al
together. A few write-in ballots
did refer to actual students, but
since these students did not file
a declaration of intent before the
Friday deadline, the ballots were
also disqualified.
"If it were reasonable to run a
runoff election, we would do it,
regardless of the cost," said
Krauss.
However, Liu said, "We find it
difficult to swallow that a slate"
running on a platform of saving
money at the ASSU "would like
to force a runoff election that will
cost the student body $5,000."
At 1 o'clock this morning, after a
weekend of protests from Students First
party members, the ASSU Elections
Commission was still deliberating over
whether last week's Council of Presi
dents election results are valid.
Steve Krauss, ASSU elections com
missioner, decided Friday to disqualify
275 write-in ballots from the vote, thus
giving the victory to "Four Our Future,"
sponsored by the People's Platform, and
preventing a runoff.
The ruling immediately sparked an
uproar among the Students First mem
bers, who said after the election that
the ASSU Bylaws guarantee a runoff if
no slate receives a "majority of the votes
cast" in the COP race.
Krauss submitted a letter to The

Daily explaining the ruling but with
drew it late last night after Students
First members protested the ruling.
Krauss met late into the evening with
representatives of both slates, but
reached no decision.
Members of the COP slate "A Clean
Slate," sponsored by Students First, said
they are prepared to appeal to Univer
sity administrators if a runoff will not
occur. "If Krauss doesn't abide to what
he is supposed to, I don't think the
[People's Platform-dominated] senate
will hold him to the Bylaws," said Stu
dent First member Tim Marklein. "In
that case, our only recourse is through
the University administration."
If the write-in votes were reinstated,
the "Four Our Future" slate's share
would drop from 51 to 48 percent, and
a runoff would be required.
Krauss ruled Friday that the write-in

votes cannot count toward the election
because many of the written-in slates
were composed of fictional characters.
Krauss said it became impossible to
verify which students represented the
write-in slates receiving votes.
For example, a slate named the
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" gath
ered 28 votes but did not file a decla
ration of intent prior to the election.
"What is to prevent me, Jay (Tucker),
Ingrid (Nava) and Jamie (Green) from
saying we are the 'Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles'?" asked Goodwin Liu, a
member of the People's Platform slate,
referring to his running-mates.
The People's Platform slate agreed
with Krauss' initial ruling, saying that
votes for ineligible slates should not be
counted. The Students First slate is
