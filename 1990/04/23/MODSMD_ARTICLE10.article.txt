MBA charity run set
In an effort to raise money
for the Special Olympics, Stan
ford business students are
teaming up with local commu
nity members to host the MBA
Challenge for Charity Run.
The event is scheduled to
begin at 8 a.m. April 28 at
Stanford Stadium. Registra

tion starts at 6:30 a.m. and
costs $15.
Last year an estimated 1,100
participants of all ages ran the
scenic loop through the Stan
ford campus.
Dead rise again
The Dead apparently refuse
to be banished to the
graveyard. In protest of the
University's decision to ban the
Grateful Dead from playing at
Stanford this year, fans of the
Grateful Dead will be rallying
in White Plaza at noon tomor
row.
The Dead concert is a spring
quarter tradition. The Univer
sity cited problems with heavy
drug use at the concerts when
announcing its decision.
Census help needed
The U.S. Census Bureau has
targeted Stanford as a place to
recruit more enumerators who
can help count the country's
240 million citizens.
The Census Bureau is cur
rently in "desperate need" of
people who can count those
who have not submitted a
census form, according to Paul
Lufkin of the Census Bureau.
Those interested should call
(408) 748-2804 and ask for the
recruiting office.
