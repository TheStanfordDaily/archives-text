# Calculated friendliness
## Dean Seldomridge serves up electronics with a smile at the Bookstore 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Her role is primarily that of a
salesclerk, but she keeps more
than camera and electronic sup
plies handy — she has a limitless
supply of contagious warmth and
friendliness.
If you don't shop at the Book
store, then you may recall her as
one of the audience favorites at
Gaieties. But most students know
and greet Dean Seldomridge by
first name, because she always
shares her smile.
A typical exchange at the supply
counter begins with, "Hi, Dean,
can I get some diskettes from
you?"
"Sure, Dan," she replies, whisk
ing out a plethora of sizes and
hues.
The student fusses about the
color and finally settles on blue,
while the other waiting customers
shift their weight and tap angry
staccato melodies on the glass
counter.
Despite the chaos of an annoy
ing telephone ring rising over the
din of a crowd of crabby custom
ers and picky purchasers, Dean
maintains her good nature that
provokes smiles from even the
ultra-impatient.
As an 18-year employee of the
Bookstore, Dean performs a vari
ety of tasks, such as buying mer
chandise, answering phones,
stocking supplies and keeping
track of inventory. Dean is one of
two full-time employees at the
supply counter.
The secret of her constant good
nature?
"Oh, that's easy," says Dean,
resting her chin in her hands. "I
what I'm doing. It's as easy
as that. And people give friendli
ness back to me."
She continues, "People are
hungry for somebody to be nice,
and it's so much easier for people
to be nice than it is to be diffi
cult."
The implementation of this the
ory changed her life. She learned
how to become good-natured the
hard way.
"I used to be mean," Dean says,
matter-of-factly. "I was miserable.
But I got tired of being nasty.
The friends I had didn't last long,

The secret of her con
stant good nature?
'Oh, that's easy. I en
joy what I'm doing.
It's as easy as that.
And people give
friendliness back to
me.'
— Dean Seldomridge

because I always dumped on
them. Finally, I realized that I
was tired of being miserable."
Following this realization, Dean
began attending group counseling
sessions at a center in Mountain
View.
It took four years of counseling
for her to change, but throughout
the process, Dean discovered
something most people will never
realize.
"Everyone has at least one
problem in common," she says.
"I learned that it's not weird to
have a problem, and no matter
what, you can always find some
body to reach out to . .. always."
Dean enjoys working with Stan
ford students. "Everyone says
'thank you' and acts open and
friendly. It's very nice. It's almost
like Never-Never Land."
Before coming to Stanford in
1972, Dean held primarily secre
tarial positions. Most of her jobs
lasted from three to six months.
However, working for the Book
store gave her the opportunity to
deal with the public, "which I ab
solutely love," says Dean.
"I didn't expect to hold my pres
ent job for as long as I have, since
I left my other jobs after about
six months, but one year seemed
to meld into another, and before
I knew it, 18 years had passed.
It's incredible."
Born in Los Angeles and raised
in the Bay Area, Dean expects to
spend the rest of her life on the
West Coast. "I suppose when I
retire, in 20 or 30 years, I'll go
to Oregon or Washington —
where everyone else moves when
they retire. Until then, I'm not
planning to move."
Dean writes poetry for special

occasions and enjoys singing easy
rock. She is also planning to work
for Respite Care, a program of
Catholic Charities in Santa Clara
which provides volunteer service
for the elderly.
Dean observes that Stanford's
current student body is more con
servative than in previous
decades. Dean comments that the

number of peaceful student
protests has dwindled, which she
regrets, as "it seems that the col
lege students are the ones that
can change things in this country.
I hope I don't offend anybody, but
it seems that people become more
apathetic as they get older, and
that it's only the college students
who get things done."

because I always dumped on
them. Finally, I realized that I
was tired of being miserable."
Following this realization, Dean
began attending group counseling
sessions at a center in Mountain
View.
It took four years of counseling
for her to change, but throughout
the process, Dean discovered
something most people will never
realize.
"Everyone has at least one
problem in common," she says.
"I learned that it's not weird to
have a problem, and no matter
what, you can always find some
body to reach out to . .. always."
Dean enjoys working with Stan
ford students. "Everyone says
'thank you' and acts open and
friendly. It's very nice. It's almost
like Never-Never Land."
Before coming to Stanford in
1972, Dean held primarily secre
tarial positions. Most of her jobs
lasted from three to six months.
However, working for the Book
store gave her the opportunity to
deal with the public, "which I ab
solutely love," says Dean.
"I didn't expect to hold my pres
ent job for as long as I have, since
I left my other jobs after about
six months, but one year seemed
to meld into another, and before
I knew it, 18 years had passed.
It's incredible."
Born in Los Angeles and raised
in the Bay Area, Dean expects to
spend the rest of her life on the
West Coast. "I suppose when I
retire, in 20 or 30 years, I'll go
to Oregon or Washington —
where everyone else moves when
they retire. Until then, I'm not
planning to move."
Dean writes poetry for special

occasions and enjoys singing easy
rock. She is also planning to work
for Respite Care, a program of
Catholic Charities in Santa Clara
which provides volunteer service
for the elderly.
Dean observes that Stanford's
current student body is more con
servative than in previous
decades. Dean comments that the

number of peaceful student
protests has dwindled, which she
regrets, as "it seems that the col
lege students are the ones that
can change things in this country.
I hope I don't offend anybody, but
it seems that people become more
apathetic as they get older, and
that it's only the college students
who get things done."

A smiling face
Dean Seldomridge, a salesclerk at the Bookstore, wins fans by pro
viding friendly service. Her philosophy is: "People are hungry for
somebody to be nice, and it's so much easier for people to be nice
than it is to be difficult."
