DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) - Pro-
Iranian kidnappers freed a "happy and
grateful" Robert Polhill in Beirut yes
terday after almost 39 months of cap
tivity. He was the first American
hostage to be released in nearly 3 Vfe
years.
A U.S. military plane flew to
Damascus, Syria to take Polhill to West
Germany for debriefing and a medical
exam before he returns to the United
States, U.S. officials said.
President Bush thanked Syria and
Iran for their roles in freeing Polhill,
and called for the release of all the
hostages.
Seventeen Western hostages remain
missing in Lebanon, including seven
Americans. Polhill and two other U.S.
educators, Jesse Turner and Alann
Steen, were held by the Islamic Jihad
for the Liberation of Palestine.
"I'm very happy and grateful to all
the people who spent time on my case,"
Polhill said in a Syrian TV interview.
But he added: "I'm still deeply con
cerned about my two friends and
others who are still held in the con
ditions I was held in."
Polhill, 55, of New York was freed
near the seaside Summerland Hotel
in Moslem west Beirut at 5:15 p.m.
(8:15 a.m. PDT) and driven immedi
ately to Damascus where he was
turned over to U.S. Ambassador Ed
ward Djerejian, Syrian sources said.
The terms of the release, which fol
lowed a series of communiques from
the Shiite Moslem kidnappers, were
not known.
Polhill's mother, Ruth Polhill of
Fishkill, N.Y., was overjoyed at news
of the release and the prospect of
seeing her son.
"Maybe I'll have control of myself
by that time," she told CNN.
Guards outside the Summerland
who witnessed the release said Polhill
stepped out of a car that screeched to
a halt about 50 yards from the hotel.
He was immediately picked up by a
three-car Syrian convoy and driven off
at high speed.
At a news conference later in
Damascus with Polhill, Syria's foreign
minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, said he
hoped Polhill's release "will be just the
beginning of the release of the rest of
the hostages."
Standing beside Polhill at the news
conference, U.S. Ambassador Edward
Djerjian said: "We will keep commu
nication lines open to all parties that
have influence with the hostage takers.

We are going to continue doing every
thing we can, we are going to continue
talking, to continue trying."
Polhill, a professor of business
studies and accounting at Beirut Uni
versity College, joked to reporters: 'I'm
sorry I kept you waiting so long."
Polhill, gaunt, tired and pale, said
he was too tired to answer any ques
tions about seven other American
hostages or his captivity by the pro-
Iranian Islamic Jihad for the Libera
tion of Palestine since Jan. 24, 1987.
Polhill and Djerejian left in the am

bassador's limousine for a reunion
with Polhill's Lebanese wife, Feryal,
at the ambassador's residence.
In the Syrian TV interview, Polhill
said he played cards with other
hostages during his captivity and tried
to keep his mind off the possibility of
freedom.
"I strived to continue to be angry,
knowing at all times that if I began
to lose that anger I would just sort of
become a vegetable and I didn't want
that to happen," he said in the inter
view.

The last American hostage to be
freed was David Jacobsen, former di
rector of the American University
Hospital in Beirut. He was kidnapped
in Beirut on May 28, 1985, was re
leased Nov. 2, 1986.
He had been held by another Shiite
faction, Islamic Jihad, or Isamic Holy
War.
In Islamorada, Fla., where Bush is
vacationing, he said he "can't rejoice
or say all is well until every single
one of those hostages is released."
