NEW YORK (AP) - Michael
Milken will be questioned by the gov
ernment under his landmark securi
ties fraud settlement but will not
have to provide information designed
to lead to other prosecutions, a source

said yesterday.

"too disappointed" with his upcoming

Medfly problem spreads
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Night
after night of aerial pesticide spray
ing hasn't halted the 50-mile spread
of the destructive Medfly from sub
urban back yards to orange and
grapefruit groves in some of the
region's richest farmland.
New outbreaks this month and the
approach of summer weather have
some scientists and growers in the
nation's No. 1 agricultural state
fearing the worst â€” costly farm
quarantines, or even more serious,
foreign embargoes of California
produce.
The newest focus of concern is 10
fresh outbreaks of the Medfly plague

this month, all but two of them out
side previously treated infestations.
"This is nothing short of a major
crisis," said entomologist James R.
Carey, a member of the state's fruit
fly scientific advisory panel.
