## Earth Day's legacy 
### 
One day's effort is
not enough to combat
environmental woes

EARTH DAY 1990 has come
and gone.
For one day, millions of
politicians, educators, celebrities
and ordinary citizens in 122 coun
tries paused to think about what
we are doing to our planet.
For one day, we planted trees.
For one day, we turned out the
lights when leaving a room.
For one day, we recycled.
For one day, we conserved water.
For one day, we rode our bikes
instead of driving our cars.
But one day is not enough.
While Earth Day may have
ended last night, we cannot afford
to let our attention and concern
for environmental issues end with
Earth Day.
The destruction of the rain
forests, the hole in the ozone layer,
the greenhouse effect, toxics in our
food and water, the slaughtering
of elephants for ivory, the killing
of dolphins for tuna. In the past
year these issues and more have
been on everyone's lips and televi
sion screens, in everyone's news
papers and magazines.
And attention to the issues has
led to some impressive results.
Within the last year, 102 member
countries of the Convention on In
ternational Trade in Endangered
Species voted to ban the sale of
ivory, leading to plummeting ivory
prices in world markets.
Recently, the U.S. Senate ap
proved the first major air pollution
legislation in 13 years. And, less
than two weeks ago, three major
U.S. tuna manufacturers promised
to stop buying tuna caught with
driftnets that kill dolphins and

other marine animals.
Although it may seem that the
ban of ivory trade or driftnet fish
ing was a rapid response to world
wide pressure, we must remember
that these actions address issues
which a small, dedicated group of
people has been discussing for
years. The environment has be
come a "trendy" concern in recent
months, but the problems have ex
isted for decades and will continue
to plague us for decades to come.
After devoting time and energy
working toward a m£yor, one-day
event such as yesterday's rallies at
Frost Amphitheatre at Stanford or
Crissy Field in San Francisco, it
is easy to lose interest or move on
to other concerns.
A msgor goal of Earth Day 1990
was to foster global awareness of
the environmental crises we are
facing today. This awareness must
lead to action — by everyone.
The efforts of Students for En
vironmental Action at Stanford,
and all members of the Stanford
community, who put in countless
hours educating people on the is
sues and preparing for Earth Day
are to be commended. Their dedi
cation demonstrates the power of
college students to effect change in
the world.
"College activists could be
counted on to step in and keep the
pressure on for needed change,"
Earth Day 1990 Chair Dennis
Hayes has written. Twenty years
ago, Hayes was part of the first
Earth Day, which spawned public
awareness of environmental issues
in the United States.
Since then, the word "environ
mentalist" has developed negative
connotations, causing some people
to hesitate before labeling them
selves as such. But "environmen
talist" should simply describe
anyone who is interested in
preserving and protecting the
world for the future — it should
describe us all.
