Ethnic theme houses are a valuable option for all

NOW THAT DRAW time is upon
us, we want to remind students
about a valuable residence
option: ethnic theme houses.
While their value is readily apparent
to many people in this community, we
are writing to emphasize again the
commitment of the Office of Residen
tial Affairs to support and promote
these vital and important houses.
Ethnic theme houses originated in
the late 1960s as the University was
increasing its commitment to support
students of color, whose enrollment
here was growing for the first time in
Stanford's history.
In response to these students' ex
pressed needs, the University estab
lished ethnic theme houses, which,
over the years, have come to include
Ujamaa, the black/African-American
theme house; Casa Zapata, the Chi
cano/Mexican American theme house;
Okada, the Asian-American theme
house; and Lathrop (soon to be
renamed Mawekma-Tah-Ruk), the
Native American theme house.
Priority for assignment to an ethnic
theme house is given to members of
the particular ethnic group for up to
half of the spaces in the house. Histor
ically, 40 to 50 percent of residents in
any given ethnic theme house are
members of the ethnic theme group
that is the focus of the house.
Ethnic theme houses represent one
variation of the diverse Stanford resi
dential experience. They share the
goals of other dorms and houses: to
provide both comfortable homes and
intellectually stimulating living environ
ments.
Their uniqueness, however, derives
from what they strive to do in addition
to, not instead of, what goes on in
non-theme houses. They provide a
home in which the exploration and
study of racial and cultural identity
and the celebration of pluralism are

promoted. This is accomplished in
three ways:
First, the houses provide an environ
ment in which significant numbers of
students of the same racial and cul
tural background may live together.
Elsewhere on campus, residences may
have as few as three to five students
of shared background; this may lead to
a sense of isolation. The ethnic theme
houses enable students of color to live
in a supportive setting.
Second, the houses provide an oppor
tunity for all students in the house to
study, in a systematic way, some
aspects of a racial and cultural group
that is represented in the student body.
Hence, social, cultural, educational and
recreational programs with an empha
sis on the group that is the focus of
the house are part of the house's
activities.
Students come to Stanford with
different degrees of exposure to this
kind of learning about their own or
other cultural groups. Consequently,
the educational opportunities offered in
an ethnic theme house are valuable, in
varying ways, to all residents of the
house.
Third, the houses provide an oppor
tunity for students of different back
grounds to learn from and about each
other. This goal is accomplished in part
simply by living in the same residence
with others of different backgrounds,
and in part by having programs that
address both the theme of the house
and more general issues as well.
Two expressed opinions about theme
houses — that they emphasize racial
differences over human similarities and
that they are separatist enclaves —
invite comment.
First, it is the case that people are
conscious of racial and ethnic differ
ences whether or not these differences
are publicly acknowledged and dis
cussed. Not naming them does not

make the differences go away. Directly
acknowledging the differences and
seeking to understand them and find
ing ways of talking about them can
improve the residential experience.
Seeing differences for what they are
does not mean that differences are
necessarily divisive. Some think that
the ethnic theme houses' focus on
racial identity and celebration of ethnic
history and culture serve to divide
students in the houses.
While obviously a part of the life in
a theme house will be the recognition
that some share the background of the
theme and others do not, it is expected
that there are many other ways stu
dents relate in the house that cut
across racial lines: by year in school,
by gender, by playing on IM teams, by
involvement in community service, by
being in the same advising group, by
being on the house social committee,
etc.
It is hoped that students who
develop acquaintances and friendships
will want to learn more about one
another. It is hoped that students of
the background of the theme appreci
ate the interest and involvement of
students of other backgrounds. Similar
ly, it is hoped that students of other
backgrounds will be active participants
in learning about the theme. This
means that the theme will be meaning
ful for all residents, not only for those
whose background is a focus of the
house.
It should also be remembered that
students within a racial group are very
different from one another. Some
students have already learned a great
deal about their racial and ethnic
heritage, others have not. There is a
great deal of diversity within ethnic
communities as well as within the
wider Stanford community.
Part of the learning that should be
taking place in all residences is the

recognition that each of us has a
distinctive identity drawn from our
family, regional, religious, racial, socio
economic and ethnic background.
Awareness of racial heritage on the
part of one group in the house can
promote a sharing of backgrounds of
all residents. The fact that some pro
grams in the house focus on race
identity should not in itself be experi
enced as emphasizing differences over
similarities. The promotion of cultural
awareness in one group — in an at
mosphere of inclusion, freedom to
participate and mutual belonging —
can be an invitation to all to share
valued aspects of people's personal
histories.
On the issue of perceived self
segregation, some people have ques
tioned whether distributing the stu
dents who live in theme houses among
other houses would not better advance
the goals of pluralism than the ethnic
theme houses do. That view ignores
the essential role the theme houses
have in building bonds and supporting
members of the group who are the
focus of the theme.
It is also the case that were the
students of color now living in theme
houses to distribute themselves
throughout the residence system, the
racial makeup of individual houses
would be largely unchanged. Until the
total number of students of color at
the University changes significantly, it
will still be true that the theme houses
serve as an important community
within a community for students of
color.

have in building bonds and supporting
members of the group who are the
focus of the theme.
It is also the case that were the
students of color now living in theme
houses to distribute themselves
throughout the residence system, the
racial makeup of individual houses
would be largely unchanged. Until the
total number of students of color at
the University changes significantly, it
will still be true that the theme houses
serve as an important community
within a community for students of
color.

Ethnic theme houses are a valuable option for all

NOW THAT DRAW time is upon
us, we want to remind students
about a valuable residence
option: ethnic theme houses.
While their value is readily apparent
to many people in this community, we
are writing to emphasize again the
commitment of the Office of Residen
tial Affairs to support and promote
these vital and important houses.
Ethnic theme houses originated in
the late 1960s as the University was
increasing its commitment to support
students of color, whose enrollment
here was growing for the first time in
Stanford's history.
In response to these students' ex
pressed needs, the University estab
lished ethnic theme houses, which,
over the years, have come to include
Ujamaa, the black/African-American
theme house; Casa Zapata, the Chi
cano/Mexican American theme house;
Okada, the Asian-American theme
house; and Lathrop (soon to be
renamed Mawekma-Tah-Ruk), the
Native American theme house.
Priority for assignment to an ethnic
theme house is given to members of
the particular ethnic group for up to
half of the spaces in the house. Histor
ically, 40 to 50 percent of residents in
any given ethnic theme house are
members of the ethnic theme group
that is the focus of the house.
Ethnic theme houses represent one
variation of the diverse Stanford resi
dential experience. They share the
goals of other dorms and houses: to
provide both comfortable homes and
intellectually stimulating living environ
ments.
Their uniqueness, however, derives
from what they strive to do in addition
to, not instead of, what goes on in
non-theme houses. They provide a
home in which the exploration and
study of racial and cultural identity
and the celebration of pluralism are

promoted. This is accomplished in
three ways:
First, the houses provide an environ
ment in which significant numbers of
students of the same racial and cul
tural background may live together.
Elsewhere on campus, residences may
have as few as three to five students
of shared background; this may lead to
a sense of isolation. The ethnic theme
houses enable students of color to live
in a supportive setting.
Second, the houses provide an oppor
tunity for all students in the house to
study, in a systematic way, some
aspects of a racial and cultural group
that is represented in the student body.
Hence, social, cultural, educational and
recreational programs with an empha
sis on the group that is the focus of
the house are part of the house's
activities.
Students come to Stanford with
different degrees of exposure to this
kind of learning about their own or
other cultural groups. Consequently,
the educational opportunities offered in
an ethnic theme house are valuable, in
varying ways, to all residents of the
house.
Third, the houses provide an oppor
tunity for students of different back
grounds to learn from and about each
other. This goal is accomplished in part
simply by living in the same residence
with others of different backgrounds,
and in part by having programs that
address both the theme of the house
and more general issues as well.
Two expressed opinions about theme
houses — that they emphasize racial
differences over human similarities and
that they are separatist enclaves —
invite comment.
First, it is the case that people are
conscious of racial and ethnic differ
ences whether or not these differences
are publicly acknowledged and dis
cussed. Not naming them does not

make the differences go away. Directly
acknowledging the differences and
seeking to understand them and find
ing ways of talking about them can
improve the residential experience.
Seeing differences for what they are
does not mean that differences are
necessarily divisive. Some think that
the ethnic theme houses' focus on
racial identity and celebration of ethnic
history and culture serve to divide
students in the houses.
While obviously a part of the life in
a theme house will be the recognition
that some share the background of the
theme and others do not, it is expected
that there are many other ways stu
dents relate in the house that cut
across racial lines: by year in school,
by gender, by playing on IM teams, by
involvement in community service, by
being in the same advising group, by
being on the house social committee,
etc.
It is hoped that students who
develop acquaintances and friendships
will want to learn more about one
another. It is hoped that students of
the background of the theme appreci
ate the interest and involvement of
students of other backgrounds. Similar
ly, it is hoped that students of other
backgrounds will be active participants
in learning about the theme. This
means that the theme will be meaning
ful for all residents, not only for those
whose background is a focus of the
house.
It should also be remembered that
students within a racial group are very
different from one another. Some
students have already learned a great
deal about their racial and ethnic
heritage, others have not. There is a
great deal of diversity within ethnic
communities as well as within the
wider Stanford community.
Part of the learning that should be
taking place in all residences is the

recognition that each of us has a
distinctive identity drawn from our
family, regional, religious, racial, socio
economic and ethnic background.
Awareness of racial heritage on the
part of one group in the house can
promote a sharing of backgrounds of
all residents. The fact that some pro
grams in the house focus on race
identity should not in itself be experi
enced as emphasizing differences over
similarities. The promotion of cultural
awareness in one group — in an at
mosphere of inclusion, freedom to
participate and mutual belonging —
can be an invitation to all to share
valued aspects of people's personal
histories.
On the issue of perceived self
segregation, some people have ques
tioned whether distributing the stu
dents who live in theme houses among
other houses would not better advance
the goals of pluralism than the ethnic
theme houses do. That view ignores
the essential role the theme houses
have in building bonds and supporting
members of the group who are the
focus of the theme.
It is also the case that were the
students of color now living in theme
houses to distribute themselves

racial makeup of individual houses
would be largely unchanged. Until the
total number of students of color at
the University changes significantly, it
