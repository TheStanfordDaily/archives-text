counted as of yesterday afternoon. In the
tally of on-campus votes, as well as those
of the Oxford, Tours and Berlin campuses,
"Carpe Diem" led "Slate of the Century"
by 93 votes.

juniors vote by ranking their top five

preferred slates. The slates are compared

round cannot be executed.
Jackie Yau and Cory Booker of the
"Carpe Diem" slate said they felt "very
excited and euphoric," but confessed they
were exhausted by the rigor of election

would be to put together a "Senior Coun
cil," composed of losing candidates and
