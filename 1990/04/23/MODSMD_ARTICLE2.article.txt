# 'Carpe Diem' seizes Senior Class race
## 
### Ruben Garcia 
With five overseas campuses yet to report
their votes, ASSU Elections Commissioner
Steve Krauss said yesterday he was "fairly
sure" that "Carpe Diem" would win over
top contender "Slate of the Century" in
the race for Senior Class Presidents.
A total of 50 to 60 votes from the San
tiago, Kyoto, Florence, Krakow and Wash
ington, D.C. campuses had yet to be
counted as of yesterday afternoon. In the
tally of on-campus votes, as well as those
of the Oxford, Tours and Berlin campuses,
"Carpe Diem" led "Slate of the Century"
by 93 votes.
In the Senior Class Presidents election,
juniors vote by ranking their top five

preferred slates. The slates are compared
in a series of rounds, and one slate is
eliminated in each round until a winner is
declared. Without all the votes in, the final
round cannot be executed.
Jackie Yau and Cory Booker of the
"Carpe Diem" slate said they felt "very
excited and euphoric," but confessed they
were exhausted by the rigor of election
week. They said they were glad that they
didn't have to face any runoff elections
because of the successive-elimination sys
tem and its "mini-runoffs."
In the event they win, their first job
would be to put together a "Senior Coun
cil," composed of losing candidates and
others, to assist the slate in its
activities. Booker also mentioned
the possibility of creating more
activities to include juniors, such
as junior pub nights.
Nader Boulous, a candidate on
the second-place "Slate of the Cen
tury," said the successive
elimination system provided his
only complaint about the elec
tions. Boulous said that under a
system in which voters choose
only one slate, they tend to feel
more strongly about one set of
candidates.
Yau said overseas balloting
could have been tallied more ef
ficiently, but that overall the com
puter voting system has "made

the whole process more pleasant."
Krauss said he will field other
suggestions and complaints about
the election in the coming weeks.
Asked about the possibility of
campaign violations, Krauss said
"anything's possible."
He said once all the slates sub
mit their financial disclosure
statements today, he'll be able to
make sure no election rules were
broken. However, he said that as
long as the winning slate did not
violate any campaign rules, the
point of investigating dis
crepancies with other slates is
"moot."
ASSU rules allow Senior Class
Presidents candidates to spend
$100 on campaign advertising.
This is $150 less than the limit
on Council of Presidents' election
spending.
Campaign material for the

Senior Class election was espe
cially elaborate this year. For ex
ample, "Slate of the Century"
advertising consisted of five large
wooden signs with detailed
artwork and lettering displayed
around campus.
Boulous said "Slate of the Cen
tury" spending was approximately
$75. The wood for the signs was
gathered from a trash heap near
the Wilbur earthquake modulars,
and the artwork was performed
by Slate members Joanne Kim
and Jeff Maggioncalda. Yau esti
mated the "Carpe Diem" election
bill at about $95.
Asked about the possibility of
students who were not juniors
voting in the Senior Class Presi
dents election, Krauss said the
task of assuring that only third
year students could vote was left
to the poll watchers at each site.
