## Journalistic responsibility 
### 
CAMERON MACKY was right.
The journalists who concen
trated solely on pitcher Brad
Brown's April 13 comments about racism
on the Stanford baseball team as the
reason for Brown's leaving Stanford blew
it.
Although Brown, who wants to study
architecture — and you can't do that at
Stanford — repeatedly stressed academic
and financial reasons for his transfer to
UC-Berkeley, some members of the media
kept going back to his comments that
raised the specter of racism. Brown had
said that one player called him "nigger"
too often and that one coach told him he
was going to be a crack dealer.
"Too late," the journalists told Brown
when he realized the implications of his
statements. For these journalists, Brad
Brown was no longer a pitcher at Cal, a
college student. He was a STORY.
Ever since I was little, I wanted to be
a journalist so that I could delve into
other people's lives. Like a lot of would
be-journalists, I saw people caught up in
lives that seemed so much more inter
esting than my own.
It was only after I was in college that
I began to question journalists' license
to delve into other people's lives, a
proposition I often found to be in stark
contrast to my desire to keep my own
life undelved.
As soon as Brown spoke, he must have
realized that his assertion that academic
and financial considerations motivated
his transfer paled beside his references
to racism.
In the pursuit of a story, journalists
sometimes forget that those we interview

are human beings whose lives may be
altered by what appears in print about
them. Some journalists dismiss such ef
fects as something we can't be concerned
about. If it's news, we print it.
We can't pick and choose whose com
ments — even whose names — we will
be careful about printing because of the
impact they might have on the speaker.
Nonsense.
In the preparation of that presentation
and perspective, journalists can and
should make judgments about how that
presentation and perspective will affect
those whose words we are printing. The
role of journalist doesn't excuse one from
making these judgments.
Racism is a serious problem, and one
the media ought to address sensitively
and responsibly. But Brown has to deal
with the problem of racism every day,
and members of the media must ask
themselves about the extent to which
their stories will add to his burden and
whether they can ask him, via the news
paper, to carry that burden.
Does that mean the media were wrong
to print Brown's comments about racism,
or even to focus on them, as long as they
accurately report their context and
Brown's insistence that the racist com
ments were not the specific reasons he
left Stanford?
No. One player calling Brown a nigger
and one coach telling him he will be a
crack dealer do reflect a problem with
racism on the baseball team. Regardless
of the intent of the speaker, the comments
invoked direct insults and negative
stereotypes that are tough to hear on a

daily basis without internalizing some of
the pain.
Does that mean the Stanford baseball
team uses its home uniforms on weekends
for Ku Klux Klan rallies and burns its
bats in the shape of crosses?
Of course not. For one thing, the last
time I was at a college baseball game the
bats were aluminum. But Brown's ac
count of racist comments directed toward
him by only two members of the baseball
team means that the whole team must
share some responsibility for the atmos
phere that tolerated those comments.
I would hope that if there is another
player who calls art African-American
player a nigger that the rest of the team
would condemn that player's words.
I would hope that if there is another
coach who says an African-American
player is going to be a crack dealer that
the rest of the team would tell the coach
what that image tells the world — and
the player — about people of color. It
shouldn't be up to Brad Brown, or any
man or woman of color alone, to combat
racism.
We all have that responsibility. Even
the journalists.
