## Wildcats latest victim of streaking Card nine 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
TUCSON — One streak came to an
end for the Stanford baseball team this
weekend, but the one that really counts
is alive and well.
Cardinal center fielder Jeff Hammonds
picked up three hits in Friday night's
opener with the Arizona Wildcats to ex
tend his school-record hitting streak to
37 games, but was shut down the next
night by a pair of Arizona pitchers, going
hitless for the first time since the Car
dinal's Feb. 5 game against Sacramento
State.
More importantly, however, the Cardi
nal was able to win all three games at
Frank Sancet Field (for the first time
ever) to run its win streak to 12 games.
And, thanks to a lot of help from UCLA,
Stanford now has a three-game lead in
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Di
vision.
The sweep, Stanford's fourth straight
in Six-Pac play, gives the team a school
record 14-game winning streak against
division opponents. Stanford is now 38-7,
17-3 in the Six-Pac, and has won 26 of
its last 28.
The Cardinal is also up three games

Baseball

Cardinal sweeps three-

game series with Wildcats

on Arizona State, which had a streak of
their own — 23 consecutive wins —
snapped Saturday at UCLA. The Sun
Devils lost again yesterday to drop to
15-7 in the league, and will play a makeup
game at USC today. Stanford travels to
ASU this weekend.
Hammonds' hitting was just about the
only thing that went Stanford's way for
most of Friday's 5-3 win. Wildcat pitcher
Troy Bradford had the Cardinal com
pletely shut down in the first six innings,
giving up only two singles to Hammonds
and striking out seven.
"Bradford just pitched an excellent
game," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "He had a good, dominating fast
ball."
That fastball was helped a little by a
strike zone that was nebulous at best
throughout the game — for both teams.
But still, Bradford was pitching out of
his mind.
"You're living in a dream world out
there!" yelled one member of the Stan

ford bench after Bradford got Paul Carey
to fly out to the warning track in the
sixth.
The dream became a nightmare an in
ning later. With Arizona leading 3-0
thanks to a two-run triple by Steve Gill
and a subsequent sacrifice fly, the Car
dinal finally got to Bradford. David
Holbrook led off with a double to left,
and Ryan Turner followed up by barely
beating out a check-swing bouncer that
third baseman Brian Eldridge couldn't
field in time.
An out later, catcher Todd French came
to the plate. French, who normally plays
in non-league games, had come in after
starter Troy Tallman was hit on the
forearm by a pitch in the fifth (nothing
serious, just a bruise), and had had a
little trouble getting into the flow of
things.
"It was tough (getting adjusted) in the
first inning or so because it kind of hap
pened all at once, but then I was fine,"
French said. "I try to always be ready
to go in."
French actually had a slight advantage
as he stepped in against Bradford because
he hasn't seen a lot of playing time this
year. "I was comfortable because I ha
ven't played much and I figured they

didn't have much on me," French said.
"I was just looking for a fastball, and
that's what I got."
When he got it, he crushed it off the
wall in right — 360 feet away — for a
run-scoring double, and Hammonds tied
it up a minute later with a double just
inside the third base line.
That was it for Bradford, who gave
way to Barry Johnson. David McCarty
greeted him with a single to left to score
Hammonds, and Paul Carey, after hitting
a foul ball to Mexico ("I've never hit a
ball that far," said Carey, who crushed
it at least 500 feet), capped off the scoring
with a double to left-center.
The seventh inning was lucky for Stan
ford again the next night. After the Car
dinal picked up only three hits in the
first six innings, two Arizona errors in
the seventh turned a tie game into a 9-3
blowout.
"We gave it away," Arizona Coach Jerry
Kindall said of his team, which committed
five errors overall. "You can't beat a team
like Stanford when you play like that."
Actually, you can't beat anybody when
you play like that: The Cardinal had ex
actly one earned run and eight gifts on
the evening. A throwing error by short
stop J.J. Northam led to three runs in

the third, and a goof by Bradford (who
was at first) led to another in the seventh
when he forgot to catch the ball on a
pickoff play.
After a monstrous home run to center
by David Holbrook made the score 7-3,
Arizona's Eldridge one-hopped a throw
wide of first for another run, and reliever
Jason Hisey joined the flub-fest by giving
up the final run of the game on a wild
pitch.
The story of the game, though, was
the line "Hmmds cf 5 1 0 0" that appeared
in the box score, as Hammonds saw his
school-record streak come to an end.
Starting pitcher Lance Dickson sat
Hammonds down three times on a
grounder to short, a strikeout and a
fielder's choice before walking him to
start the seventh, and Jim Richardson
got Hammonds twice more on a pop to
short and, in the ninth, on a fly ball to
center for the Cardinal's final out.
"I expected it," Hammonds said. "It
doesn't hurt that bad. If we'd lost then
it would've hurt. I can't blame anyone
but myself."
Hammonds goes into the Pac-10 record
book with the longest hitting streak in
conference history. "It'll be a
number of years before it's bro
ken," Marquess said. "He still got
the inning going in the seventh
with the walk, and the main thing
is to win. We don't win if he
doesn't get us going. . . Hey, he'll
probably start another one tomor
row."
No dice: Hammonds, in fact,
was the only Cardinal not to get
a hit in Sunday afternoon's 13-5
laugher. The game was actually
close (the Cardinal was up 3-1
after five innings) before the
Wildcats' less-than-deep bullpen
came on to get slaughtered.
The slugfest was led by
McCarty and Turner, who both
had career days (and then some).
McCarty had two two-run
homers, one that he blasted to
right (against the wind) and an
other that literally got a boost
from Arizona's Damon Mashore.
In the eighth, with the score
7-2, McCarty came up with Tail
man at second and sent a shot
deep to center. Mashore drifted
back, back, jumped, watched the
ball land in his glove and then
hit the fence (while still in the
air) and dropped the ball over the
top.
The help was nice, but the Car
dinal hardly needed it. Turner
picked up his second career home
run on his way to a four-for-four
day, Steve Solomon (who made a
spectacular running catch in the
eighth) and Tim Griffin each
added a homer, and Hammonds
contributed two sacrifice flies to
complete the sweep.
Card notes
The Chicken showed up at Satur
day's game and proceeded to lift his
leg on the Cardinal dugout in the
fourth. The Wildcats proceeded to get
shut out the rest of the way.
