# Netters conclude perfect dual season
## No. 1 women down weakened L.A. foes, head into Pac-10s with 25-0 record 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The question is no longer when,
but if.
As the women's tennis team has
knocked off opponent after oppon
ent en route to a 61-match win
ning streak, it has been fashion
able to ask, "When will they lose?"
After No. 2 UCLA and No. 4
UCLA got hammered this past
weekend at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, everyone has to wonder
if the Cardinal's remarkable
string of victories will end anytime
soon.
The two wins pushed Stanford's
season mark to 25-0, 9-0 in Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
play.
UCLA probably would have
been better off visiting the Cowell
Student Health Center instead of
the Cardinal's den. When they are
healthy, the Bruins have a singles
lineup that can go toe-to-toe with
Stanford's.
Currently, UCLA is anything
but healthy. Jessica Emmons, who
plays No. 1 for the Bruins, has a
stress fracture in her leg. Mamie
Ceniza, UCLA's second singles
player, injured her shoulder in a
match against Meredith McGrath
two weeks ago. Finally, Kim Po,
fell on her elbow nealy two
months ago. Normally, she would
play No. 3.
It's bad enough to lose half the

Cardinal 8, Bruins 0

Cardinal 7, Trojans 2

singles lineup. It's worse still
when it is the entire top half and
everyone has to move up three
notches against the four-time
defending national champions.
The results were easy to predict
going in and few surprises were
provided. McGrath opened the
flogging with a 6-1, 6-1 defeat of
Iwalani McCalla.
Fellow freshman sensation
Heather Willens trounced Debbie
LaFranchi 6-1, 6-1; senior captain
Lisa Green hammered Allegra
Milholland 6-1, 6-4; Teri Whit
linger overwhelmed Stella
Sampras by the same score; and
Debbie Graham thumped Cammie
Foley 6-3, 6-3.
Only Sandra Birch had even a
remotely difficult time. She
dropped the first set to the hard
hitting Kirsten Dreyer before
rebounding to record a 3-6, 6-4,
6-2 victory.
"That was a good team we
defeated today, with or without
the injured players," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "It
was a good match all the way
around for us. I was especially
pleased with the fact that Sandra
found some reserves and came

back to win after being down a
set. She learned from that
match."
The doubles provided the day's
biggest excitement, but not before
the injury bug bit the Bruins
again. Ceniza tried to test her
shoulder in doubles. But after she
and Sampras had dropped the
first set to McGrath and Whit
linger 6-4, the pair had to default.
At No. 2, Dreyer and McCalla
split sets with Birch and Graham
and moved ahead 5-2, 30-0 in the
third. Somehow, Birch and
Graham came back to record the
6-2, 6-7, 7-5 victory and complete
the 8-0 shutout.
Saturday, the Trojans tried an
interesting strategic ploy and
came up empty. When the teams
met two weeks ago, Julie Tullberg
provided little challenge for Grqen
and Linda Allred was no match
for Willens. So Coach Cheryl
Jones flip-flopped the two in the
lineup. The result? A 6-1, 6-1 mas
sacre of Allred by Green, who was
playing her final home match, and
a 6-1, 6-2 beating of Tullberg by
the red-hot Willens.
At Nos. 3 and 4, Lupita Novelo
and Anya Kochoff had battled
Graham and Whitlinger to tough
three-set decisions two weeks ago.
While both Trojans were defeated,
they seemed to provide good
matchups for USC. But Jones flip

flopped them as well. The result?
Graham buried Kochoff 6-2, 6-2
and Whitlinger sliced up Novelo
6-2, 6-4.
McGrath beat Stephanie Lon
don in a pair of tiebreakers at
No. 2 singles. Birch was locked
up with Trisha Laux, who is only
5-foot-2 but hits the ball with the
pace of a giant. Stanford's No. 1
player dropped a 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 de
cision, her fourth loss in just over
three weeks.
Asked if she could explain her
struggles this month, Birch
replied: "I have no idea why. I'm
working very, very hard. The hard
work is not seeming to pay off
right now.
"I definitely overanalyze every
thing. I'm way too rational on the
court. I respect everyone's play.
Yoti've got tq be a little cocky
somefcrmes, and 1 don't lilce that."
I IT? BJOI I V I •
Of her match against Laux, she
said, "I felt very good in the first
set. I was very determined having
lost to her twice. I was winning
a lot of points playing up the
middle."
Since Laux likes to pound the
ball, Birch said she was "trying
to take the pace off." The tech
nique worked early, but Birch said
it played a role in her downfall.
Eventually, she was just putting
the ball in play and Laux was
able to come up with winners.

split sets with Birch and Graham
and moved ahead 5-2, 30-0 in the
third. Somehow, Birch and
Graham came back to record the
6-2, 6-7, 7-5 victory and complete
the 8-0 shutout.
Saturday, the Trojans tried an
interesting strategic ploy and
came up empty. When the teams
met two weeks ago, Julie Tullberg
provided little challenge for Grqen
and Linda Allred was no match
for Willens. So Coach Cheryl
Jones flip-flopped the two in the
lineup. The result? A 6-1, 6-1 mas
sacre of Allred by Green, who was
playing her final home match, and
a 6-1, 6-2 beating of Tullberg by
the red-hot Willens.
At Nos. 3 and 4, Lupita Novelo
and Anya Kochoff had battled
Graham and Whitlinger to tough
three-set decisions two weeks ago.
While both Trojans were defeated,
they seemed to provide good
matchups for USC. But Jones flip

flopped them as well. The result?
Graham buried Kochoff 6-2, 6-2
and Whitlinger sliced up Novelo
6-2, 6-4.
McGrath beat Stephanie Lon
don in a pair of tiebreakers at
No. 2 singles. Birch was locked
up with Trisha Laux, who is only
5-foot-2 but hits the ball with the
pace of a giant. Stanford's No. 1
player dropped a 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 de
cision, her fourth loss in just over
three weeks.
Asked if she could explain her
struggles this month, Birch
replied: "I have no idea why. I'm
working very, very hard. The hard
work is not seeming to pay off
right now.
"I definitely overanalyze every
thing. I'm way too rational on the
court. I respect everyone's play.
Yoti've got tq be a little cocky
somefcrmes, and 1 don't lilce that."
I IT? BJOI I V I •
Of her match against Laux, she
said, "I felt very good in the first
set. I was very determined having
lost to her twice. I was winning
a lot of points playing up the
middle."
Since Laux likes to pound the
ball, Birch said she was "trying
to take the pace off." The tech
nique worked early, but Birch said
it played a role in her downfall.
Eventually, she was just putting
the ball in play and Laux was
able to come up with winners.

Lisa Green epitomized the Cardinal's weekend, annihilating both
her USC and UCLA foes in straight sets.
The question is no longer when,
but if.
As the women's tennis team has
knocked off opponent after oppon
ent en route to a 61-match win
ning streak, it has been fashion
able to ask, "When will they lose?"
After No. 2 UCLA and No. 4
UCLA got hammered this past
weekend at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, everyone has to wonder
if the Cardinal's remarkable
string of victories will end anytime
soon.
The two wins pushed Stanford's
season mark to 25-0, 9-0 in Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
play.
UCLA probably would have
been better off visiting the Cowell
Student Health Center instead of
the Cardinal's den. When they are
healthy, the Bruins have a singles
lineup that can go toe-to-toe with
Stanford's.
Currently, UCLA is anything
but healthy. Jessica Emmons, who
plays No. 1 for the Bruins, has a
stress fracture in her leg. Mamie
Ceniza, UCLA's second singles
player, injured her shoulder in a
match against Meredith McGrath
two weeks ago. Finally, Kim Po,
fell on her elbow nealy two
months ago. Normally, she would
play No. 3.
It's bad enough to lose half the

singles lineup. It's worse still
when it is the entire top half and
everyone has to move up three
notches against the four-time
defending national champions.
The results were easy to predict
going in and few surprises were
provided. McGrath opened the
flogging with a 6-1, 6-1 defeat of
Iwalani McCalla.
Fellow freshman sensation
Heather Willens trounced Debbie
LaFranchi 6-1, 6-1; senior captain
Lisa Green hammered Allegra
Milholland 6-1, 6-4; Teri Whit
linger overwhelmed Stella
Sampras by the same score; and
Debbie Graham thumped Cammie
Foley 6-3, 6-3.
Only Sandra Birch had even a
remotely difficult time. She
dropped the first set to the hard
hitting Kirsten Dreyer before
rebounding to record a 3-6, 6-4,
6-2 victory.
"That was a good team we
defeated today, with or without
the injured players," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "It
was a good match all the way
around for us. I was especially
pleased with the fact that Sandra
found some reserves and came

back to win after being down a
set. She learned from that
match."
The doubles provided the day's
biggest excitement, but not before
the injury bug bit the Bruins
again. Ceniza tried to test her
shoulder in doubles. But after she
and Sampras had dropped the
first set to McGrath and Whit
linger 6-4, the pair had to default.
At No. 2, Dreyer and McCalla
split sets with Birch and Graham
and moved ahead 5-2, 30-0 in the
third. Somehow, Birch and
Graham came back to record the
6-2, 6-7, 7-5 victory and complete
