# Golfers take advantage of home course
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
It's fair to say that the men's
golf team had a pretty good week
end. After all, by winning the
Stanford Cardinal Intercollegiate
Golf Invitational this weekend,

they did something that no men's
golf team had ever done before.
What is so special and notable
about this victory is that it is the
team's fourth tournament win of
the year —the most titles a Car
dinal men's golf team has ever
captured in one season.

And what is even better news
for the team is that the win came
when it did. "We had been strug
gling a bit since the Fresno State
Tournament (the team's last out
ing)," senior Brad Geer said, "And
this win really came at a good
time for us."
Someone who hasn't been
struggling lately is senior Mark
Funseth. Playing exceptionally
well, Funseth shot a three-round
total of 209 (four-under-par)
which was good enough to earn
the individual title by a stroke
over USC's Bryan Pemberton.
Funseth beat Pemberton on the
last hole of the 54-hole tourna
ment, as he parred the hole while
his foe could only manage a bogey.
"I couldn't be more pleased
than I am for Mark Funseth,"
Coach Wally Goodwin said. "It's
great seeing him play like I knew
he could. The last two weeks have
been glorious for him."
Geer added, "For the last couple
of weeks, Mark's been playing the
best golf I've ever seen him play
during his career at Stanford. It
didn't surprise anyone that he
shot the way he did this weekend.
When he gets hot like this he can
really shoot low rounds."
But Funseth wasn't the only
Cardinal who was on his game,
as the team finished with a com
bined score of 865, which is only
thirteen- over-par. Second place
USC finished eight shots back at
873.
Indeed, three Cardinal finished
in the top five individually, as Don
Christensen and Christian Cevaer
joined Funseth. Christensen had
a last round of 70 which was good
enough to vault him into sole pos
session of fourth place, with a
score of 216. Cevaer, uncharac
teristically, didn't have that great
a last round, as he shot a 73, but
that was still good enough to place
in him in a tie for fifth place, one
shot behind Christensen.
Despite the fact that the Car
dinal has won an unprecedented

four tournaments this year, the
team had been having a hard time
lately, and going into next week
end's PAC-10 Championship's, this
victory is sure to help the team's
confidence.
"If we can keep playing the way
we played this weekend, then we
have a real shot at doing well in
the Pac-10's," Geer said.
In fact, added Geer, "This is by
far the best the team has played
in quite a while."
Goodwin echoed this thought.
"We seem to be coming together
as a team, but I still think we
can be better."
In addition to being the team's
fourth tournament title of the
year, the Invitational was special
since it was the last home tour
nament ever for seniors Funseth,
Christensen, and Geer. Christen
sen was clearly pleased with his
final effort. "My score was the
best of my career here at Stan
ford, so it's a nice way to go out."
Goodwin was also excited for
Funseth, who has consistently
been at the top of the leader's
board throughout the season.
"Since Mark is a senior, I was
glad to see him win his last tour
nament here. It was great seeing
him win it."
According to Goodwin, the team
has now assured themselves ot a
spot in the NCAA Regionals which
will be held at the end of May in
Las Cruces, N.M.
It was a good weekend after all.
