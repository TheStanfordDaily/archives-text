# Gymnasts fare well on individual level
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Another men's gymnastics
season culminated in the
NCAA Championships over the
weekend. Stanford's three rep
resentatives, Charles Loop,
Conrad Voorsanger, and Jair
Lynch, each fared well individ
ually despite the frustration of
having to be spectators to the
team competition.
Freshman phenom Lynch
finished the first round of op
tional all-around competition
in 7th place. Saturday's com
pulsory routines proved more
challenging for him, and he
emerged in the 13th spot over
all. Senior Loop followed closely
at 15th, improving upon his
first-day standing of 23rd.
"I think the main thing that
hurt me in compulsories was
inexperience," Lynch said.
"This was only the second time
I have done them (the first
being in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships)."
In the individual events, both
Lynch and Loop were among
the top eight gymnasts selected
to compete in the high bar
finals. Lynch's 9.8 earned him
a sixth place finish. The fresh
man also qualified for the pom
mel horse finals and came away
with a seventh place standing
in that event.
"High bar was incredible,"
senior Voorsanger said. "The
guy who came in second (with
a 9.9) did a triple back
(dismount) and stuck it. The
guy who won (with a 9.975)
had three release moves and
stuck a double (tuck) double
(twist)."
Lynch agreed that the mar
gin for error was slim. "The

top six places in high bar were
only separated by a tenth and
a half. The competition was
very, very tight because every
body hit their sets. It all came
down to the luck of the draw:
whoever competed last or sec
ond to last, stuck his routine,
and didn't move on the dis
mount had a chance to win."
The competition was equally
fierce on the parallel bars,
where Voorsanger finished an
impressive third with a 9.625.
"In the preliminaries, I had to
do an easy dismount because
of my ankle injury, and then I
took one step," he said. "I
wasn't even sure I would make
it to the finals, so it was ex
citing to be there in the first
place."
Although the Cardinal was
not among the squads vying
for the national title, the three
Stanford gymnasts were able
to witness one of the closest
team competitions in history.
Nebraska eventually came
away with the victory with
287.4 points after being chal
lenged by the Minnesota home
team all evening. In fact, Min
nesota finished with a 287.3,
making Nebraska's margin of
victory one of the slimmest in
history. UCLA managed to
finish a distant third.
"It was the best final team
competition I've ever seen,"
Loop said. "The three teams
combined only had around ten
falls; it was great to be a spec
tator."
Now that the season is over,
the three gymnasts will rejoin
the rest of the team and con
tinue training for the U.S.
Championships
