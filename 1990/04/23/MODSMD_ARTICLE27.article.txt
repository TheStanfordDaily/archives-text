# Two Card stars taken in draft
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer With AP wire reports 
While a lot of people may feel that spending
a Sunday afternoon sitting around the house,
watching television and talking on the phone
is hardly a good use of time, it paid off for
two Stanford seniors yesterday. Both Rob
Hinckley and Alan Grant were selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft yesterday, by
the Detroit Lions and the Indianapolis Colts,
respectively.
The first five rounds of the draft were com
pleted yesterday. Rounds six through 12 will
be held today.
Hinckley, an outside linebacker, was selected
by the Lions as the 91st choice. He was the
17th linebacker chosen in a draft that was
considered to be very rich in players at that
position.
"I'm excited," he said from his home in
Walnut Creek, Calif. "I'm going out there to
morrow."
Grant, who plays defensive back and returns
kicks, was the 103 rd pick overall and the 13th
defensive back taken.
"I'm glad this part is over," he said last
night from his home in Pasadena, Calif. "Not
just today — the last four months. I'm relieved.
I watched the first round, just to see where
people were going to go. Then I went and
worked out. I guess they called while I was
gone. I got back and they called to confirm."
Neither player knows much about his new
team but both are ready to begin professional
careers. "I don't know that much about them,"
Hinckley said of the Lions. "They have some
good young players. All I know is they're an
up-and-coming team.... Hopefully I can be
part of something good."
"I'm happy to go there," Grant said of In
dianapolis. "I was hoping I'd go to an AFC
team. They throw the ball
more. ... I don't know much
about the Colts except they gave
up a lot of yards in the air last
year, I guess. ... You've got to
play against Marino, Kelly and
that bunch in that division (the
AFC East)."
Hinckley missed much of last
season with a lower back injury,
but isn't sure how much that af
fected his draft position. "You
can't really tell about that," he
said. "The fact that I came back
put to rest any questions I
think. . . . You can't tell how
healthy a guy is by watching him
on film. They could only see what
I did on the field.
"I feel bad I didn't help the
team (Stanford) more. But they
picked me based upon what they
think I can do for them."
Grant feels his stock continued
to rise. Last season he became
the school's career leader in both
punt returns and punt return yar
dage.
"I'm sure that's part of it,"he
said of returning kicks. "I'd want
to do that. I think I can help the
team that way. I think that really
helped me in the draft — the fact
that I can do that."
Both players said they already
have agents and won't be too spe
cific as to what type of contract
they want.
The big overall story of the
draft was that this is the year of
the junior. League Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue opened the draft
unconditionally to juniors this
year and the result was that five
of the top seven players selected
had collegiate eligibility remain
ing.
Illnois quarterback Jeff George

went to the Indianapolis Colts as
the No. 1 pick, and after seniors
Blair Thomas and Cortez Ken
nedy were chosen by the New York
Jets and the Seattle Seahawks,
respectively, four more juniors
heard their names called.
Alabama linebacker Keith
McCants went to the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, USC linebacker
Junior Seau was taken by the San
Diego Chargers, his Trojan team
mate, safety Mark Carrier, was a
surprise selection by the Chicago
Bears, and Houston quarterback
Andre Ware was drafted seventh
by the Detroit Lions.
The draft leaned hevily towards
defense in the early going as 13
of the first 18 picks play on that
side of the ball. Seven of those
were linebackers, including
juniors McCants, Seau and Lamar
Lathon, who is going from the
University of Houston to the
Houston Oilers.
Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins
took somewhat of a risk in both
the first and second rounds, draft
ing McCants and Tennessee run
ning back Reggie Cobb. McCants
was a certain top choice when the
junior declared for the draft but
his stock fell after a poor showing
at a scouting combine.
He might have fallen even fur
ther after a story circulated Sat
urday that a knee injury would
likely cause him to miss the entire
1990-91 season. McCants denied
that, however, and Perkins, the
coach who recruited McCants to
Alabama, feels his rookie will only
need arthroscopic surgery on the
knee.
Cobb, meanwhile, rushed for
more than 600 yards in the five
games he played last season. But
he was then kicked off the team
after allegedly failing several drug
tests. He has been to a rehabilita
tion clinic and said he has been
clear for months.

position.
"I'm excited," he said from his home in
Walnut Creek, Calif. "I'm going out there to
morrow."
Grant, who plays defensive back and returns
kicks, was the 103 rd pick overall and the 13th
defensive back taken.
"I'm glad this part is over," he said last
night from his home in Pasadena, Calif. "Not
just today — the last four months. I'm relieved.
I watched the first round, just to see where
people were going to go. Then I went and
worked out. I guess they called while I was
gone. I got back and they called to confirm."
Neither player knows much about his new
team but both are ready to begin professional
careers. "I don't know that much about them,"
Hinckley said of the Lions. "They have some
good young players. All I know is they're an
up-and-coming team.... Hopefully I can be
part of something good."
"I'm happy to go there," Grant said of In
dianapolis. "I was hoping I'd go to an AFC
team. They throw the ball
more. ... I don't know much
about the Colts except they gave
up a lot of yards in the air last
year, I guess. ... You've got to
play against Marino, Kelly and
that bunch in that division (the
AFC East)."
Hinckley missed much of last
season with a lower back injury,
but isn't sure how much that af
fected his draft position. "You
can't really tell about that," he
said. "The fact that I came back
put to rest any questions I
think. . . . You can't tell how
healthy a guy is by watching him
on film. They could only see what
I did on the field.
"I feel bad I didn't help the
team (Stanford) more. But they
picked me based upon what they
think I can do for them."
Grant feels his stock continued
to rise. Last season he became
the school's career leader in both
punt returns and punt return yar
dage.
"I'm sure that's part of it,"he
said of returning kicks. "I'd want
to do that. I think I can help the
team that way. I think that really
helped me in the draft — the fact
that I can do that."
Both players said they already
have agents and won't be too spe
cific as to what type of contract
they want.
The big overall story of the
draft was that this is the year of
the junior. League Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue opened the draft
unconditionally to juniors this
year and the result was that five
of the top seven players selected
had collegiate eligibility remain
ing.
Illnois quarterback Jeff George

went to the Indianapolis Colts as
the No. 1 pick, and after seniors
Blair Thomas and Cortez Ken
nedy were chosen by the New York
Jets and the Seattle Seahawks,
respectively, four more juniors
heard their names called.
Alabama linebacker Keith
McCants went to the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, USC linebacker
Junior Seau was taken by the San
Diego Chargers, his Trojan team
mate, safety Mark Carrier, was a
surprise selection by the Chicago
Bears, and Houston quarterback
Andre Ware was drafted seventh
by the Detroit Lions.
The draft leaned hevily towards
defense in the early going as 13
of the first 18 picks play on that
side of the ball. Seven of those
were linebackers, including
juniors McCants, Seau and Lamar
Lathon, who is going from the
University of Houston to the
Houston Oilers.
Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins
took somewhat of a risk in both
the first and second rounds, draft
ing McCants and Tennessee run
ning back Reggie Cobb. McCants
was a certain top choice when the
junior declared for the draft but
his stock fell after a poor showing
at a scouting combine.
He might have fallen even fur
ther after a story circulated Sat
urday that a knee injury would
likely cause him to miss the entire
1990-91 season. McCants denied
that, however, and Perkins, the
coach who recruited McCants to
Alabama, feels his rookie will only
need arthroscopic surgery on the
knee.
Cobb, meanwhile, rushed for
more than 600 yards in the five
games he played last season. But
he was then kicked off the team
after allegedly failing several drug
tests. He has been to a rehabilita
tion clinic and said he has been
clear for months.
