# Track teams realize postseason goals
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
After competing in the rela
tively non-strenuous Stanford
Collegiate Open Saturday, the
Cardinal track and field teams
find themselves healthy and
loaded with yet more weapons
with which to battle their Pacific
10 Conference foes.
The meet saw six more Pac-10-
qualifying marks for the Cardinal,
as overall, most of the team's
marks improved. For the Pac-10
meet, the team now has 10 men
competing in 13 events and as
many women qualified for 15
events.
The first Stanford athlete to
catch foe's eyes was sophomore
Jackie Edwards. She jumped a
season-best 19-7 in the long jump
to make her the second woman
to represent the Cardinal at Pac
10's in that event. She had already
qualified in the triple jump.
Soon after, it was the men's
turn to add to the postseason list.
In one of Stanford's strongest
events, the 1500-meters, junior
Dave Strang and senior Mark
Mastalir went one-two, placing
both runners in the Pac-10 meet
alongside teammate Bill Crowley,
who beat the NCAA mark last
week.
Minutes later, the women did
it again. Specifically, Peggy Odita
did it again. Having already qual
ified for the heptathlon at the
Texas Relays, the senior leapt the
Pac-10-qualifying threshold — 5-8
3/4 — in the high jump before
she injured her back. The iryury

is reported to be minor.
The men were not to be out
done, however, as later in the day
Crowley doubled his Pac-10 value
by qualifying in the 800-meters
with a 1:51.03 time.
But the women were not
finished yet. In the 200-meters,
freshman Rhonda Oliver, the 1989
Texas State Champion in that
event, extended her season with
a 24.4-second run. She finished
just behind the 1988 Texas State
Champion in the same event,
sophomore Chryste Gaines, who
improved her previous season
best by about .3 seconds. It was
Oliver's first 200-meter competi
tion of the year, but she had al
ready guaranteed herself a spot
in the Pac-10 400-meter race ear
lier this season.
In addition to the numerous
qualifications, the meet's biggest
news was the return to action of
Peter Kolotouros and Tim Collins.
The senior hurdlers have been in
jured for most of the season, but
were impressive in their appear
ances Saturday.
Coming back from a hamstring
problem, Kolotouros won the 110-
meter high hurdles in 14.3
seconds, a Pac-10 qualifying mark.
However, in his first race early
in the year, he recorded a even
better time. If he returns to form
as rapidly as his performance in
dicates, he should be a threat at
Pac-lOs.
Collins, meanwhile, placed sec
ond in the 400-meter hurdles, his
specialty, and is already only
about 3.5 seconds away from qual
ifying for Pac-lOs.
