# Loss of freshman stars leaves netters groping in L.A.
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
With freshmen Jonathan Stark and
Jared Palmer sidelined because of inju
ries, a black-and-blue Cardinal men's ten
nis team traveled to USC and UCLA,
hoping to find some inspiration in the
City of Angels.
What it found instead were missed op
portunities and two monsters in the
Trojan 9 and the Bruins. Stanford lost
5-2 to USC Friday and 7-2 to UCLA
Saturday. With the defeats, the No. 1-
ranked Cardinal fell to 19-3 on the season
and to 6-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
With Stark in the lineup earlier this
month, Stanford trounced USC 5-1 and
UCLA 5-1. But this weekend Stark, the
No. 1-ranked Cardinal and the No. 2-
ranked player in the country, was forced
out of the lineup because of a stress
fracture in his left foot. The team obvi
ously missed his presence.
Palmer, formerly the No. 3-ranked Car
dinal, is still recovering from knee sur
gery but should be back shortly. Palmer
and Stark compose Stanford's strongest
doubles combination and are ranked third

Men's Tennis

Trojans 5, Cardinal 2
Bruins 7, Cardinal 2

in doubles by the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings.
Even without the two freshmen, the
Stanford players still felt they had a good
shot at beating both USC and UCLA.
"I think we have the talent even with
out [Palmer and Stark] to win it all this
year. But this past weekend we didn't
play well together as a team," junior
Glenn Solomon said. "Last year, we had
a lot of close matches, but the guys who
needed to win would always rise to the
occasion. We had a lot of chances (this
weekend) but the guys who needed to
win didn't put it together, myself in
cluded."
The 5-2 loss to USC was especially full
of opportunities. "I thought against USC
we had a real chance to win it. We put
ourselves in a position to do it," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "It was a match
that could have gone either way."

Indeed, three of the Cardinal's five
losses came in tight third sets.
At No. 1 singles, Alex O'Brien, the No.
14-ranked player in the country, fell to
Byron Black, the No. 5-ranked player in
the nation, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3.
Jeff Cathrall met a similar fate at No.
2, losing in a tight duel to Andras Lanyi
1-6, 7-5, 7-5.
Solomon squeaked out a 1-6, 6-4, 7-5
victory over Mehdi Benyebka at No. 3.
At No. 4 singles, Alexis Hombrecher
never got rolling as he lost 6-1, 6-3 to
Donni Isaak.
Jason Yee continued his inspired play
at No. 5, downing Kent Seton 6-1, 7-5.
Team captain Barry Richards, playing
in his first singles match of the year,
won the first set but could not hold on,
falling 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 to Martin Dionne at
No. 6.
Stanford still had a chance to come
back, however, entering the doubles com
petition down 4-2. Hombrecher and Cath
rall, who were teamed at No. 1, were
actually serving for the second set, after
losing the first to Black and Seton.
But the previously unbeaten team of
Yee and O'Brien fell 6-3, 6-2 to Lanyi

1 think we have the tal
ent even without [Palmer
and Stark] to win it all this
year. But this past week
end we didn't play well
together as a team/

and Isaak, giving the Trojans the 5-2
win. After the loss, the rest of the doubles
matches were cancelled.
At UCLA Saturday, Stanford met a
Bruin team on top of its game and bent
on avenging its earlier loss to the Car
dinal.
"UCLA played outstanding," Gould
said. "They never let us in it."
Jason Netter looked much different
than he had when he lost 7-5, 6-1 to
Stark in Stanford Tennis Stadium April
6. Netter crushed O'Brien 6-1, 6-0 at No.
1 singles.
"The difference was that Alex was hit
ting short and Netter was taking advan

tage of it," Gould said. "Unless you have
a big serve to get you [into the net], you
have got to find other ways to take con
trol of the points."
Cathrall fell in a similar fashion, losing
to Mark Knowles 6-0, 6-3 at No. 2.
Solomon could not work the magic he
had a day earlier, falling 7-6, 6-4 to Fritz
Bissell at No. 3.
Hombrecher provided the Cardinal
with its only highlight on the afternoon
as the freshman downed Bill Barber 7-5,
7-3 at No. 4.
To put more icing on an already sour
cake, Yee lost only his second dual meet
singles match of the year. Bill Behrens
pounded the Cardinal junior 6-3, 6-2.
To make matters worse, Richards lost
another close duel, this time to Robbie
Wendell 6-3, 6-7, 6-3. "It's hard to have
the confidence to close out a match when
you haven't been playing," Gould said.
Cathrall and Hombrecher remained
undefeated as a doubles team, downing
Knowles and Bissell 7-5, 6-1. O'Brien and
Yee, however, fell again, losing to Barber
and Mark Quinney 2-6, 6-2, 6-3.
At No. 3 doubles, Richards and Turbow
lost 6-3, 7-6 to Behrens and Wendell.
