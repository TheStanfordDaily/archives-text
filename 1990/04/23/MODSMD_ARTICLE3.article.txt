# Up for the count
## ASSU elections technical crew tallies votes through the night 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Listening for the Clock Tower
to chime eight, the ASSU elections
technical crew stood outside the
Tresidder Union poll site last
Thursday night.
Eight strikes, and the polling
site shuts down.
But the end of voting signals
just the beginning for members
of the team headed by Steve
Krauss, ASSU elections commis
sioner. They still have six hours
of vote counting ahead of them.
"Disks?" Mike Conte asks
Krauss, and Krauss hands him a
stack. "You'll have to sort through
these," says Krauss.
All of the data from each of the
seven pollsites is stored on 12
computer disks, six for each day.
That makes a total of 84 disks to
go through.
Krausa explains the disks' func
tions. "One is for voter I.D. and
name. A second is for votes. A
third is for a tallier." For security
reasons, each of the disks has a
backup. In addition, there is a
paper printout for every vote. The
printouts form a stack the size of
three good-sized chemistry
textbooks.
As Conte starts counting votes,
Steve Bush explains the process.
"Think of it like a post office.
Each computer is like a P.O. box.
The tallier goes in and takes out
the 'mail' from each box and adds
it up."
After this explanation, Bush
starts taking the 'mail' from each
of the computers at Tresidder.
There are 32 machines from
which he has to collect data. The
votes are recorded in a standard
text file, and each document is
about seven kilobytes large.
Bush muses about time saving
and efficiency as he trudges from
computer to computer while com
pleting his tedious task. "It'd be

kind of nice to
network these
somehow so
that all the
votes are collec
ted in one
area," he says.
But for now,

Bush resigns himself to complet
ing the circle. When he finally
finishes, he turns to Raul Lopez
and says, "Nuke 'em."
While Lopez sets about erasing
the vote data from the hard
drives, Bush gives the disks to
Mike Schwartz, who starts tally
ing the votes from Tresidder.
Schwartz has been doing this
all night. First the Law School,
then the Medical School, now
Tresidder, and soon Meyer and
Green Libraries. It's a time
consuming, monotonous job. He
has to go from disk to disk, pulling
out data from different files, 32
times in all for Tresidder alone.
Schwartz says that the pro
grammer could have written an
application to do all of his job
automatically, but the Elections
Commission wanted to have a
human check in each step of the
process.
Schwartz finishes and gives the
results to Conte and Krauss. They
verbally transfer the results from
this pollsite to a spreadsheet.
Conte reads out numbers, and
Krauss inputs them into a
predesigned template on the
spreadsheet.
Krauss is interrupted continu
ously as he works. Four of his
staff surround him at once and
fire questions and comments at
him: "You need three of those
columns," says one. "I'm going to
Meyer," says another. A third
asks, "You want me to do any
thing here?" The fourth says, "If
you need me, just yell."
Finally, the four leave, and

Krauss can work in peace again.
While tranferring the data,
Krauss takes a peek at the race
for the Council of Presidents.
Only 14 votes separate the two
slates.
When he finishes with Tresid
der, 85 percent of the votes are
counted, and Krauss prints out
results and posts them for the
mob gathered in the ASSU office.
While Krauss is away, Bush takes
his place.
Bush wants to "massage" the
data by calculating voting percent
ages so as to give candidates more
information about their relative
status. But as Bush works, the
strain of two days of hard work
without sleep begin to take their
toll.
"Come on, Steve, think. Think,
think. O.K. That divided by that
equals that. No ... 0.K.," he says
to himself, and in the end the
percentages work out right.
The votes from Stanford in
Washington arrive. They are
delivered in an envelope after
having been telephoned in a few

minutes earlier. Krauss, back
from the ASSU office, opens the
envelope with dramatic flair. "And
the winner is ... Daniel Day-
Lewis for 'My Left Foot.' "
Of course, it's not the Oscars,
but a little humor does help. As
Krauss looks over the numbers,
he discovers that the voting for
Senior Class Presidents is "all
screwed up." The information
from Washington will have to be
redone.
At 10:55 p.m., Krauss learns
that the Green Library pollsite is
still open. Polling was to shut
down at 10 p.m.
Krauss, unaware of the this,
flares up. "No. They've got to shut
down now! I'm going down there."
He storms out of Tresidder with
a member of the crew.
As the night wears on, votes
from Meyer and overseas cam
puses start coming in. The tech
nical crew looks at some of the
write-ins for undergraduate sen
ate. They are mostly trivial.
Latecomer Mr. Frog and popular
cartoon character Bart Simpson
take an early lead among them.
Someone includes Saturday Night
Live's Church Lady and a myste
rious candidate called "Comment,

No." '
Krauss comes back at 11:45
p.m. He takes over his old position
for a bit, and then, eyes tired from
a scant hour and a half of sleep
in the past two days, he gives his
seat to Bush and walks out of
Tresidder to take a break.
By then, the normally good
humor of the technical help begins
to wear thin. Schwartz turns td
a person loudly munching on
potato chips. "Can you not eat
those around here? I'm going to
puke on this computer if you con
tinue to do so," he says.
A friend of Krauss' tells the
staff that Krauss is asleep on art
office floor in the ASSU. The staff
understands his exhaustion, nods
and goes on working.
The crew does not see him again
until 1:50 a.m., when 97 percent
of the votes have been counted;
The remainder won't be in until
Friday, when the rest of the over
seas votes arrive and the paper
ballots are tallied.
By then, the crowd in the ASSU
office has dispersed, and the tech
nical crew prepares to go home.
For Steve Krauss and his crew,
there's not much more to do
tonight but sleep.

his place.
Bush wants to "massage" the
data by calculating voting percent
ages so as to give candidates more
information about their relative
status. But as Bush works, the
strain of two days of hard work
without sleep begin to take their
toll.
"Come on, Steve, think. Think,
think. O.K. That divided by that
equals that. No ... 0.K.," he says
to himself, and in the end the
percentages work out right.
The votes from Stanford in
Washington arrive. They are
delivered in an envelope after
having been telephoned in a few

minutes earlier. Krauss, back
from the ASSU office, opens the
envelope with dramatic flair. "And
the winner is ... Daniel Day-
Lewis for 'My Left Foot.' "
Of course, it's not the Oscars,
but a little humor does help. As
Krauss looks over the numbers,
he discovers that the voting for
Senior Class Presidents is "all
screwed up." The information
from Washington will have to be
redone.
At 10:55 p.m., Krauss learns
that the Green Library pollsite is
still open. Polling was to shut
down at 10 p.m.
Krauss, unaware of the this,
flares up. "No. They've got to shut
down now! I'm going down there."
He storms out of Tresidder with
a member of the crew.
As the night wears on, votes
from Meyer and overseas cam
puses start coming in. The tech
nical crew looks at some of the
write-ins for undergraduate sen
ate. They are mostly trivial.
Latecomer Mr. Frog and popular
cartoon character Bart Simpson
take an early lead among them.
Someone includes Saturday Night
Live's Church Lady and a myste
rious candidate called "Comment,

No." '
Krauss comes back at 11:45
p.m. He takes over his old position
for a bit, and then, eyes tired from
a scant hour and a half of sleep
in the past two days, he gives his
seat to Bush and walks out of
Tresidder to take a break.
By then, the normally good
humor of the technical help begins
to wear thin. Schwartz turns td
a person loudly munching on
potato chips. "Can you not eat
those around here? I'm going to
puke on this computer if you con
tinue to do so," he says.
A friend of Krauss' tells the
staff that Krauss is asleep on art
office floor in the ASSU. The staff
understands his exhaustion, nods
and goes on working.
The crew does not see him again
until 1:50 a.m., when 97 percent
of the votes have been counted;
The remainder won't be in until
Friday, when the rest of the over
seas votes arrive and the paper
ballots are tallied.
By then, the crowd in the ASSU
office has dispersed, and the tech
nical crew prepares to go home.
For Steve Krauss and his crew,
there's not much more to do
tonight but sleep.
Listening for the Clock Tower
to chime eight, the ASSU elections
technical crew stood outside the
Tresidder Union poll site last
Thursday night.
Eight strikes, and the polling
site shuts down.
But the end of voting signals
just the beginning for members
of the team headed by Steve
Krauss, ASSU elections commis
sioner. They still have six hours
of vote counting ahead of them.
"Disks?" Mike Conte asks
Krauss, and Krauss hands him a
stack. "You'll have to sort through
these," says Krauss.
All of the data from each of the
seven pollsites is stored on 12
computer disks, six for each day.
That makes a total of 84 disks to
go through.
Krausa explains the disks' func
tions. "One is for voter I.D. and
name. A second is for votes. A
third is for a tallier." For security
reasons, each of the disks has a
backup. In addition, there is a
paper printout for every vote. The
printouts form a stack the size of
three good-sized chemistry
textbooks.
As Conte starts counting votes,
Steve Bush explains the process.
"Think of it like a post office.
Each computer is like a P.O. box.
The tallier goes in and takes out
the 'mail' from each box and adds
it up."
After this explanation, Bush
starts taking the 'mail' from each
of the computers at Tresidder.
There are 32 machines from
which he has to collect data. The
votes are recorded in a standard
text file, and each document is
about seven kilobytes large.
Bush muses about time saving
and efficiency as he trudges from
computer to computer while com
pleting his tedious task. "It'd be

kind of nice to
network these
somehow so
that all the
votes are collec
ted in one
area," he says.
But for now,

Bush resigns himself to complet
ing the circle. When he finally
finishes, he turns to Raul Lopez
and says, "Nuke 'em."
While Lopez sets about erasing
the vote data from the hard
drives, Bush gives the disks to
Mike Schwartz, who starts tally
ing the votes from Tresidder.
Schwartz has been doing this
all night. First the Law School,
then the Medical School, now
Tresidder, and soon Meyer and
Green Libraries. It's a time
consuming, monotonous job. He
has to go from disk to disk, pulling
out data from different files, 32
times in all for Tresidder alone.
Schwartz says that the pro
grammer could have written an
application to do all of his job
automatically, but the Elections
Commission wanted to have a
human check in each step of the
process.
Schwartz finishes and gives the
results to Conte and Krauss. They
verbally transfer the results from
this pollsite to a spreadsheet.
Conte reads out numbers, and
Krauss inputs them into a
predesigned template on the
spreadsheet.
Krauss is interrupted continu
ously as he works. Four of his
staff surround him at once and
fire questions and comments at
him: "You need three of those
columns," says one. "I'm going to
Meyer," says another. A third
asks, "You want me to do any
thing here?" The fourth says, "If
you need me, just yell."
Finally, the four leave, and

Krauss can work in peace again.
While tranferring the data,
Krauss takes a peek at the race
for the Council of Presidents.
Only 14 votes separate the two
slates.
When he finishes with Tresid
der, 85 percent of the votes are
counted, and Krauss prints out
results and posts them for the
mob gathered in the ASSU office.
While Krauss is away, Bush takes
his place.
