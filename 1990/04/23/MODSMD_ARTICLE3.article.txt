## ASSU elections technical crew tallies votes through the night 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Listening for the Clock Tower
to chime eight, the ASSU elections
technical crew stood outside the
Tresidder Union poll site last
Thursday night.
Eight strikes, and the polling
site shuts down.
But the end of voting signals
just the beginning for members
of the team headed by Steve
Krauss, ASSU elections commis
sioner. They still have six hours
of vote counting ahead of them.
"Disks?" Mike Conte asks
Krauss, and Krauss hands him a
stack. "You'll have to sort through
these," says Krauss.
All of the data from each of the
seven pollsites is stored on 12
computer disks, six for each day.
That makes a total of 84 disks to
go through.
Krausa explains the disks' func
tions. "One is for voter I.D. and
name. A second is for votes. A
third is for a tallier." For security
reasons, each of the disks has a
backup. In addition, there is a
paper printout for every vote. The
printouts form a stack the size of
three good-sized chemistry
textbooks.
As Conte starts counting votes,
Steve Bush explains the process.
"Think of it like a post office.
Each computer is like a P.O. box.
The tallier goes in and takes out
the 'mail' from each box and adds
it up."
After this explanation, Bush
starts taking the 'mail' from each
of the computers at Tresidder.
There are 32 machines from
which he has to collect data. The
votes are recorded in a standard
text file, and each document is
about seven kilobytes large.
Bush muses about time saving
and efficiency as he trudges from
computer to computer while com
pleting his tedious task. "It'd be

kind of nice to
network these
somehow so
that all the
votes are collec
ted in one
area," he says.
But for now,

Bush resigns himself to complet
ing the circle. When he finally
finishes, he turns to Raul Lopez
and says, "Nuke 'em."
While Lopez sets about erasing
the vote data from the hard
drives, Bush gives the disks to
Mike Schwartz, who starts tally
ing the votes from Tresidder.
Schwartz has been doing this
all night. First the Law School,
then the Medical School, now
Tresidder, and soon Meyer and
Green Libraries. It's a time
consuming, monotonous job. He
has to go from disk to disk, pulling
out data from different files, 32
times in all for Tresidder alone.
Schwartz says that the pro
grammer could have written an
application to do all of his job
automatically, but the Elections
Commission wanted to have a
human check in each step of the
process.
Schwartz finishes and gives the
results to Conte and Krauss. They
verbally transfer the results from
this pollsite to a spreadsheet.
Conte reads out numbers, and
Krauss inputs them into a
predesigned template on the
spreadsheet.
Krauss is interrupted continu
ously as he works. Four of his
staff surround him at once and
fire questions and comments at
him: "You need three of those
columns," says one. "I'm going to
Meyer," says another. A third
asks, "You want me to do any
thing here?" The fourth says, "If
you need me, just yell."
Finally, the four leave, and
