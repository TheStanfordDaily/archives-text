# Crew teams settle for sixth
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Maybe for a few of the Ivy League schol
ars that traveled to California for this
weekend's Redwood Shores/Stanford
Rowing Classic the weather provided a tem
porary reprieve from the blustery East
Coast, but for Stanford's squads the un
predictable winds just added one more un
wanted obstacle.
"A head wind does not favor us," Coach
Ken Dreyfuss said. "We're not a big crew
and, usually over two days, you get at least
one absolutely flat day to see how fast you
can go."
Under these conditions and with the
unique Classic format, which matches
crews one-on-one to compete round-robin,
the Cardinal'B men's and the women's var
sity crews both found themselves in the
loser's bracket after the first race. After
completing competition on Sunday, both
varsity crews settled into sixth-place
finishes.
The warmest breeze of the weekend blew
on the youngest Cardinal rowers. The Stan
ford men's novice and freshman crews se
cured top awards in their divisions, not
losing one race the entire regatta.
"That has never happened before,"
Dreyfuss said. "We have some great hopes
for the future."
On Saturday morning, the Stanford
women found themselves on the water
against a strong Radcliffe squad. Coming

off a week of less-than-spectacular practices
and hampered by a few key injuries, the
Cardinal opened with its worst race of the
weekend.
"It's evident when we watch others that
we look good but we're just not as effective
as we need to be," Women's Crew Coach
John Davis said. "In those windy condi
tions, we just got overpowered by some of
the bigger crews.
"After that race, we rowed more solidly
and made progress throughout the week
end."
Later that afternoon, the Cardinal
women stroked past Wisconsin, but, on the
Sunday morning in the consolation final,
Cornell skimmed across the finish line just
ahead of the Cardinal.
"Athletes have slumps, low periods, from
which they must really bounce back," Davis
said. "This team has the maturity to get
back on its feet, dust off, and be ready for
Pac-lOs in a few weeks."
The men's varsity also performed below
their capacity in an opening round loss to
Yale on Saturday morning.
"We still need to transfer our varsity
speed in practice onto the race course,"
Dreyfuss said. "In good conditions, we have
really rowed well, but we haven't yet trans
fered that to the course."
In their afternoon race the Cardinal men
dominated Oregon State, beating the Bea
ver boat to the finish by nearly seven
seconds, but, in its final race of the regatta,
Stanford fell to cross-bay rival California.

Windy conditions and stiff competition dashed the varsity men's crew team's hopes for a strong placing at Its own
Redwood Shores Classic last weekend. The squad finished sixth, as did the women's varsity. The novice boats,
however, both recorded victories on their home waters.
