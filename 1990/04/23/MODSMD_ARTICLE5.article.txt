# Water rationing decision due tomorrow
## Commission likely to rule Stanford must begin cutting back on May 1 
### Michelle Lin 
With the Northern California
drought stretching into its fourth
year, a public utilities commission
will decide tomorrow whether
Stanford will have to ration its
water.
A rationing plan suggested by
the San Francisco Water Depart
ment would force a 25 percent
cutback in water drawr< from the
Hetch Hetchy reservoir, which

serves 2.2 million people, includ
ing the Stanford community.
Those who surpass the usage
limits set would be charged
penalty rates for the extra water
consumed.
"The proposal . . . will most
likely be passed," according to
Debra Katz, energy services coor
dinator for Palo Alto. If the pro
posal does pass, rationing will be
implemented May 1 and penalty
rates will take effect July 1.

Stanford would probably
reinstitute the rationing plan it
used in 1988, according to Cheryl
Jensen, manager of mechanical
utilities at Operations and Main
tenance.
That plan called for the shut
ting off of fountains and
sprinklers, a reduction of water
used for irrigation and voluntary
rationing by members of the Stan
ford community.
"I hope everyone will

cooperate," said Jensen.
If reinstituted, rationing would
last for an indefinite period of
time, according to Katz.
Studies of tree rings reveal
many long-term droughts in Cal
ifornia's history. "It all depends
on whether the snow melts in the
Sierra. We'll have to see," said
Katz.
"Not to be a pessimist, but the
drought might even last for 10 to
20 years," she added.
