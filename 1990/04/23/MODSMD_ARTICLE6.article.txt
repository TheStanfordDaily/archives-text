# Affirmative action post to be filled soon
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
To extend multiculturalism and pluralism
to staff hiring, Stanford has expanded the
role of the affirmative action officer — and
officials hope to name a new one by the end
of the school year.
Advertisements for the position, placed in
journals across the nation, drew a total of
109 applicants. None of the applicants came
from within the University.
The list has now been whittled to nine.
According to Vice Provost Ray Bacchetti,
chair of the search committee, the University
Committee on Minority Issues staff report
released in December revealed several prob
lems concerning minority staff hiring.
The key problem concerns what Bacchetti
called a "glass ceiling" in the hiring of mi
nority staff.
"Most institutions have [minority stafF) in
the lower ranks," Bacchetti said. He added
that "not many people of color" hold positions
of "great authority, power or clout. We really
need to change that."
In the past, the affirmative action officer

worked to solve problems on an individual
basis. Bacchetti likened the differences be
tween the old and new role of the officer to
that of "the difference between a general prac
titioner versus a public health officer."
While the old role meant the officer dealt
with "particular cases of illness," Bacchetti
said the officer will now act more like a public
health officer and "make everybody healthy."
Bacchetti said the officer must be able "to
take a complex place like Stanford and develop
strategies and tactics to make Stanford a bet
ter place for everyone of all colors."
According to Aishya Earls, assistant to Bac
chetti and a member of the search committee,
the committee is looking for someone with a

multicultural perspective and leadership skills
who is able to "communicate with diverse
groups."
Earls said the committee itself has "a mul
ticultural face." Comprised of eight people of
various University offices from the Hoover
Institution to Human Resources Services, the
committee includes members of Chi
cano/Latino, Native American and Asian des
cent.
After Santiago Rodriguez left the affirma
tive action officer position last year, a search
committee found a new officer, but she later
declined the position to pursue another offer.
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean of Graduate
Studies, agreed to serve as the acting affirm
ative action officer until a permanent replace
ment was hired.
Nancy Ware, another assistant to Bacchetti
who served on last year's committee, said the
failure to find a permanent replacement led
the committee "to rethink what they were
looking for" and redefine the position.
Bacchetti said he is very pleased with the
nine remaining applicants and plans to further
reduce the list and interview candidates next
month.
