# Dialing for dollars
## Annual fund-raising drive begins 
### Kaarin Michaelsen 
Move over, Jerry Lewis. With
dozens of phones and cow bells
in tow, the eighth annual Stan
ford Student Telethon is in the
final stages of preparing for its
weeklong drive to solicit funds
from alumni.
The Office of Development
sponsors the yearly event,
which will take place May 12-
19. This year's goal is to raise
about $iOO,OOO, which will
eventually be allocated for
scholarships or placed in the
University's general fund.
"This year the telethon will
be mainly targeting alumni
who are neither recent gradu
ates nor typically big givers.
We're trying to encourage
people who have never donated

to the University before to give
this year," said telethon
recruitment chair Adam Gran
cell.
This year's telethon will
retain the same basic format
as in past years, although there
will be several changes. "This
year marks the largest volun
teer recruitment effort that
we've ever made. We have
recruiting representatives in
every dorm on campus, and
they'll begin an onslaught of
dorm presentations and pro
grams, which we hope will
bring in more people than the
500 that we need," Grancell
said.
Vital to this recruitment ef
fort is a telephone incentive
program that will be making its
debut this year.
"The staff of the Office of De
velopment is trying to raise
$50,000 from faculty and staff
contributions, and this money will
then be split up among the callers.
Each caller will receive $100,
which he or she can then desig
nate to a campus organization of
his or her choice," he said. "We're
hoping that this type of program

will encourage members of
campus groups to come in en
masse and volunteer because now
they really have something to gain
by participating."
Volunteers will be provided
with a list of approximately 25
organizations from whom they
can choose when allocating their
money. "We tried to pick groups
and organizations that don't nor
mally get special (ASSU) fees, like
the Bridge and El Centro Chicano,
so that it would be a simpler proc
ess," he said.
Although the new money
allocation program is expected to

bring in more volunteers this year,
Grancell hopes that the main rea
son people will participate in the
telethon is because it's a lot of
fun. "We'll be dragging out the
cow bells for people to ring when
they convince someone to donate,
and we'll be giving out all kinds
of random prizes. Just about
anyone who calls will walk away
with something.
"In addition to the prizes, I'd
like to see people come out and
have a good time talking to
alumni. They're a resource a lot
of people don't know about."
