Move over, Jerry Lewis. With
dozens of phones and cow bells
in tow, the eighth annual Stan
ford Student Telethon is in the
final stages of preparing for its
weeklong drive to solicit funds
from alumni.
The Office of Development
sponsors the yearly event,
which will take place May 12-
19. This year's goal is to raise
about $iOO,OOO, which will
eventually be allocated for
scholarships or placed in the
University's general fund.
"This year the telethon will
be mainly targeting alumni
who are neither recent gradu
ates nor typically big givers.
We're trying to encourage
people who have never donated

to the University before to give
this year," said telethon
recruitment chair Adam Gran
cell.
This year's telethon will
retain the same basic format
as in past years, although there
will be several changes. "This
year marks the largest volun
teer recruitment effort that
we've ever made. We have
recruiting representatives in
every dorm on campus, and
they'll begin an onslaught of
dorm presentations and pro
grams, which we hope will
bring in more people than the
500 that we need," Grancell
said.
Vital to this recruitment ef
fort is a telephone incentive
