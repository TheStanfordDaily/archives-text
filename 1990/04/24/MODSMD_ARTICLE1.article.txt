# Soviets arrive on the Farm
## Exchange students from Siberia experience Stanford life 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Undeterred by the Exotic
Erotic Ball and recent earth
quakes, 14 Soviet students and
a dean from Novosibirsk Uni
versity are visiting Stanford on
a two-week tour of the United
States.
Before they leave, the Soviets
will have:
• Watched the California
State Legislature in action,
• Shopped for jeans at the
Stanford Shopping Center,
• Taken a ferry tour and spent
a day at the beach,
• Toured both the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and
Silicon Valley computer plants,
• Gone to Disneyland as part
of a three-day excursion to Los
Angeles.
"We don't waste a minute
here," says Tania Kletskova, a
senior at Novosibirsk. "I wonder
how your students managed to
arrange all the activities. There
is so much to do."
Soviet students are not com
plaining about being busy,
though.
"Almost everything is impor
tant," Kletskova continues. "We
want to see everything — how

you eat, where you sleep."
The Soviet students are on
campus as part of the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Project, a
student-run program that
coordinates the Soviets' visit to
Stanford and a reciprocal visit
by Stanford students to
Novosibirsk State University in
Siberia.
The arrival of the Soviet stu
dents completes the second year
of exchanges under the pro
gram. Originally, their visit had
been scheduled for October but
had to be canceled when they
could not arrange for airplane
tickets.
The exchange project was es
tablished three years ago as part
of a group of exchanges initiated
in the wake of the Reykjavik
summit. At the time, some stu
dents were concerned about po
tential discord between the
United States and the Soviet
Union.
The organizers of the pro
gram thought that "if our
leaders cannot get together on
a higher level, we should pursue
citizen diplomacy at a lower
level," says Rob Eno, a Stanford
graduate who was director of
the exchange program last year.
The program now "is not so

much to bridge the gap between
East and West," says Joanna
Sosinska, one of this year's co
ordinators. "It's more to know
what's going on there, and to
make a difference for them and
for us."
Eno affirms the change in
rationale, saying "The Soviet
Union is at a point now where
it needs Western contact, and
the United States needs more
contact with the rest of the
world."
For both Stanford students
and Soviet students, the visit
has meant discovering unex
pected similarities.
Soviets and Americans are
very much alike in having lots
of activities, publications they
put out themselves and clubs
they join, Kletskova says.
Stanford senior Jorge Velaz
quez, who hosted Sergei
Mironosetski, comments that
the Soviets are very similar to
American students. "They laugh
like us, they have the same in
terests, they care about their
education."
"But Stanford students spend
a lot more time in the library
and in front of the computer,"

Soviet students speak about life in their country and their impressions of America. The students
are participants in an exchange program between Stanford and Novosibirsk University in Siberia.
Kletskova says. She adds that
compared to Stanford students,
Soviet students spend more time
attending class.
Dormitory life was also a switch
for the Soviets. At Novosibirsk
students are housed by their de
partments. Married students with
children live in the same dormi
tories.
At Stanford, the Soviet students
are staying in Madera, American
Studies House, Toyon Hall, Casa
Zapata, Soto, Florence Moore Hall
and Slavianski Dom.
Students on both sides of the
exchange were pleasantly sur
prised by the warmth they en
countered. "People here are
always say 'hi, hi' all the time.
Immediately, my mood got better.
I understand now why Americans
are happy all the time," says Ar
tur Kravchenko, a senior in
physics at Novosibirsk.
"The most surprising thing for
us," Kletskova says, "was visiting
the Senate in Sacramento. We had
dinner there and we found out
there is no big difference between
the food from the kitchens here
and the Senate's food."
American students involved in
the exchange point to the degree
of administrative control as one
of the msyor differences between
the Soviet and the American sides
of the exchange.
"In the Soviet Union, the ad
ministration picks everybody.
Here it is totally student-run,"
Eno says.
Even though organizers of the
exchange describe it as primarily
cultural, the Soviets have encoun

tered much curiosity about the
course of reforms within the So
viet Union. A press conference last
night gave them an opportunity
to answer many of the questions
Americans have.
Velazquez said he was im

pressed by the Soviets' "candor
about political issues. Some of
them are opposed to Gorbachev,
some of them aren't. There's a
real diversity of opinions."
For Stanford students who want
to get involved in next year's ex

change, there will be an applica
tion available in the next month.
Students selected will make ar
rangements for the Soviets' visit
next spring, and visit Novosibirsk
themselves in early September
1991.
