# Soviets arrive on the Farm
## Exchange students from Siberia experience Stanford life 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Undeterred by the Exotic
Erotic Ball and recent earth
quakes, 14 Soviet students and
a dean from Novosibirsk Uni
versity are visiting Stanford on
a two-week tour of the United
States.
Before they leave, the Soviets
will have:
• Watched the California
State Legislature in action,
• Shopped for jeans at the
Stanford Shopping Center,
• Taken a ferry tour and spent
a day at the beach,
• Toured both the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and
Silicon Valley computer plants,
• Gone to Disneyland as part
of a three-day excursion to Los
Angeles.
"We don't waste a minute
here," says Tania Kletskova, a
senior at Novosibirsk. "I wonder
how your students managed to
arrange all the activities. There
is so much to do."
Soviet students are not com
plaining about being busy,
though.
"Almost everything is impor
tant," Kletskova continues. "We
want to see everything — how

you eat, where you sleep."
The Soviet students are on
campus as part of the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Project, a
student-run program that
coordinates the Soviets' visit to
Stanford and a reciprocal visit
by Stanford students to
Novosibirsk State University in
Siberia.
The arrival of the Soviet stu
dents completes the second year
of exchanges under the pro
gram. Originally, their visit had
been scheduled for October but
had to be canceled when they
could not arrange for airplane
tickets.
The exchange project was es
tablished three years ago as part
of a group of exchanges initiated
in the wake of the Reykjavik
summit. At the time, some stu
dents were concerned about po
tential discord between the
United States and the Soviet
Union.
The organizers of the pro
gram thought that "if our
leaders cannot get together on
a higher level, we should pursue
citizen diplomacy at a lower
level," says Rob Eno, a Stanford
graduate who was director of
the exchange program last year.
The program now "is not so

much to bridge the gap between
East and West," says Joanna
Sosinska, one of this year's co
ordinators. "It's more to know
what's going on there, and to
make a difference for them and
for us."
Eno affirms the change in
rationale, saying "The Soviet
Union is at a point now where
it needs Western contact, and
the United States needs more
contact with the rest of the
world."
For both Stanford students
and Soviet students, the visit
has meant discovering unex
pected similarities.
Soviets and Americans are
very much alike in having lots
of activities, publications they
put out themselves and clubs
they join, Kletskova says.
Stanford senior Jorge Velaz
quez, who hosted Sergei
Mironosetski, comments that
the Soviets are very similar to
American students. "They laugh
like us, they have the same in
terests, they care about their
education."
"But Stanford students spend
a lot more time in the library
and in front of the computer,"

Soviet students speak about life in their country and their impressions of America. The students
are participants in an exchange program between Stanford and Novosibirsk University in Siberia.
