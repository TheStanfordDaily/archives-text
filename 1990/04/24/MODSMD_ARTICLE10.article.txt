# Students' voices from a changing Soviet Union
## 
### 
The following are Soviet stu
dents' comments on current is
sues during a press conference
last night at Kresge Auditorium,
translated from Russian.
About the United States:
For a long time, it was con
sidered good political behavior
to have a bad cpinion of the
United States. Over the past
four or five years the pendulum
has swung back the other way
— from an automatic negative
reaction to an automatic posi
tive reaction. It's almost to the
point where people believe that
no bad things happen in the
United States, that no one in
the United States is poor.
— Slava Koriagin
About perestroika:
So far we haven't been able
to find a direct path to where
we want to go. Over the past
five years we have been stepping
first to the left, then to the
right, trying to grope our way
to the future.
— Sergei Mironosetski
So far the only thing the So
viet Union has been able to dem
onstrate is how not to do things.
— Tania Kletskova
While we sit here and talk
about the flaws of perestroika,

just the fact that we are sitting
up here and can say what we
want is in itself an achievement
of perestroika.
— Timofei Kuzminou
Perestroika has made it pos
sible for me not to hide the fact
I go to church.
— Elena Tihomirova
About Gorbachev:
Gorbachev's political con
science and his conscience as a
person are beyond doubt. His
politics have shown his concern
with human rights. But as a
private individual, I would have
to say he is very unfortunate
to have to take over a country
with so many problems. We all
have to ask ourselves what we
would do if we were president
of the Soviet Union. I think if
I were president I would hang
myself. The only thing we can
do is to support Gorbachev and
help him out in these difficult
times.
— Slava Koriagin
About Lithuania:
It seems to me that the dec
laration of the Lithuanian Par
liament concerning
independence is with a great
deal of foundation. The problem
is that Moscow looks at the

republics as a certain kind of
vassal territory — that's why
the reaction was so strong and
so cruel. The best solution
would be a round table discus
sion.
— Victor Savinyh
About feminist issues in the So
viet Union:
Women have a tendency to get
married much earlier in the So
viet Union. [For a single wom
an] it's almost impossible to get
a job or an apartment to live in
by herself, so she is forced to
get married quickly
— Svetlana Miltseva
About the rise of anti-scmitism:
I would have to say it's un
fortunate that this dirty wave
is rising. At the moment it is
confined to a small group of
ideologues, but it is hard to say
what will happen further. This
has always been the case in Rus
sia during times of strain and
stress. .. t
- Timofei Kuzminov
There have been rumors that
there will be pogroms against
the Jews in Novosibirsk. Al
though it has not happened, the
fact that there are rumors says
something.
— Olga Kolesova
