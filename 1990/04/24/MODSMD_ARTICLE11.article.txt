Li visits Moscow
MOSCOW (AP) — Premier Li Peng yester
day began the first visit in 26 years to Moscow
by a Chinese head of government by emphasiz
ing that his country and the Soviet Union
have the right to tailor reforms to their own
needs.
Li's four-day trip is aimed at improving re
lations and easing border tensions as both
countries grapple with domestic problems.
At a Kremlin dinner in his honor, the 61-
year-old premier noted that the Soviet Union
and China share a 4,300-mile border.
"Both are socialist countries and conduct
reform and perestroika in accordance with the
realities of their countries," Li was quoted by
the official Soviet news agency Tass.
Li went on to tell the dignitaries in the
Grand Kremlin Palace that his country was
committed to developing friendly ties with the
Soviet Union despite differences.
Li did not identify the areas of disagreement,
but Western diplomats in Beying said that
China has stressed it will never be a docile
Soviet ally as it was in the 19505. They also
noted that China's inherent suspicions of So
viet aims have grown with Gorbachev's reform
policies.
Yugoslavian elections held
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) — A center-right
coalition claimed victory yesterday in multi
party parliamentary elections in Croatia, while
a reform Communist won the run-off presi
dential election in neighboring Slovenia.
The elections in the two republics were con
sidered crucial for the future of Yugoslavia, a
loose federation of six republics and two
provinces. There were fears that voting could
further divide the country.
Slovenia and Croatia have taken the lead in
holding the first free multiparty elections in
Yugoslavia in almost 50 years. Nearly four
million voters went to the polls in the two
northern republics on Sunday.
But Serbia, the largest republic and only
one of two still led by hard-line Communists,
has accused some Slovene and Croatian leaders
of advocating secession from the Balkan nation
of 23 million.
In Slovenia, with nearly all the 1.2 million
ballots counted, Communist reformer Milan
Kucan had 58.39 percent of the vote after
Sunday's second-round presidential balloting.
Kucan thus will become Eastern Europe's
first freely elected Communist head of state
since a democratic upheaval swept the region
last year.
In Croatia, the second largest republic, a
leader of the Croatian Democratic Union, a
center-right coalition, claimed victory in the
republic's parliamentary elections.
Neven Jurica, a coalition leader, said the
Union had won an "impressive victory" and
was expected to take an outright majority of
seats in the election's first-round.
Bush to penalize Moscow
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush is
ready to announce a series of economic
penalties against the Soviet Union in response
to Moscow's crackdown on Lithuania, U.S.
officials said yesterday.
Bush was expected to outline his strategy
at a meeting today with congressional leaders,
said officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
Among the steps will be postponment and
withholding of a variety of trade and economic
concessions that the Soviet Union is seeking
from the L T nited States, officials said.
However, the administration's measures are
not intended to interfere with U.S.-Soviet arms
negotiations or to postpone the May 30-June
3 superpower summit, officials said.
Although exact details of the administra
tion's package were not clear, the general
thrust will be to slow down U.S.-Soviet trade
liberalization talks, which had been scheduled
to resume in Paris tomorrow, officials said.
Financial districts attacked
NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds of environ
mentalists demonstrated yesterday in the fi
nancial districts of New York and San Fran
cisco, where post-Earth Day demonstrators
shattered windows at the Bank of America.
Authorities said 249 people were arrested.
Also in California, hand-delivered messages
claimed responsibility yesterday for vandalism
that cut power to some 92,000 Pacific Gas &
Electric customers in Santa Cruz and Watson
ville.
In New York, police arrested about 185 of
an estimated 700 demonstrators.
"The major corporations have committed a
lot of crimes against nature," said Marc Cher
noff, 30, a member of New York's Coalition
for a Nuclear Free Harbor. "It's long overdue
to place the blame where it directly belongs.
If the products that pollute were not made
available, people would not buy them."
Trade on the New York Stock Exchange
went on as scheduled and none of the protest
ers got inside.
Shareholders consider reforms
HOUSTON (AP) — Thirteen months and
3,200 miles away, the Valdez spill again will
wash over America's largest oil company to
morrow as shareholders consider six proposals
seeking to make Exxon Corp. more ecologically
responsive.
Management opposes all six proposals, which
range from requiring Exxon to report annually
on its environmental performance to promising
to eliminate or reduce carbon dioxide or toxic
chemical emissions.
"Generally, I would like them to be respon
sible for their actions and to know there are
shareholders who care more about integrity
and responsibility than total profit," said
shareholder Anne Chapman of Denver.

party parliamentary elections in Croatia, while
a reform Communist won the run-off presi
dential election in neighboring Slovenia.
The elections in the two republics were con
sidered crucial for the future of Yugoslavia, a
loose federation of six republics and two
provinces. There were fears that voting could
further divide the country.
Slovenia and Croatia have taken the lead in
holding the first free multiparty elections in
Yugoslavia in almost 50 years. Nearly four
million voters went to the polls in the two
northern republics on Sunday.
But Serbia, the largest republic and only
one of two still led by hard-line Communists,
has accused some Slovene and Croatian leaders
of advocating secession from the Balkan nation
of 23 million.
In Slovenia, with nearly all the 1.2 million
ballots counted, Communist reformer Milan
Kucan had 58.39 percent of the vote after
Sunday's second-round presidential balloting.
Kucan thus will become Eastern Europe's
first freely elected Communist head of state
since a democratic upheaval swept the region
last year.
In Croatia, the second largest republic, a
leader of the Croatian Democratic Union, a
center-right coalition, claimed victory in the
republic's parliamentary elections.
Neven Jurica, a coalition leader, said the
Union had won an "impressive victory" and
was expected to take an outright majority of
seats in the election's first-round.
Bush to penalize Moscow
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush is
ready to announce a series of economic
penalties against the Soviet Union in response
to Moscow's crackdown on Lithuania, U.S.
officials said yesterday.
Bush was expected to outline his strategy
at a meeting today with congressional leaders,
said officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
Among the steps will be postponment and
withholding of a variety of trade and economic
concessions that the Soviet Union is seeking
from the L T nited States, officials said.
However, the administration's measures are
not intended to interfere with U.S.-Soviet arms
negotiations or to postpone the May 30-June
3 superpower summit, officials said.
Although exact details of the administra
tion's package were not clear, the general
thrust will be to slow down U.S.-Soviet trade
liberalization talks, which had been scheduled
to resume in Paris tomorrow, officials said.
Financial districts attacked
NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds of environ
mentalists demonstrated yesterday in the fi
nancial districts of New York and San Fran
cisco, where post-Earth Day demonstrators
shattered windows at the Bank of America.
Authorities said 249 people were arrested.
Also in California, hand-delivered messages
claimed responsibility yesterday for vandalism
that cut power to some 92,000 Pacific Gas &
Electric customers in Santa Cruz and Watson
ville.
In New York, police arrested about 185 of
an estimated 700 demonstrators.
"The major corporations have committed a
lot of crimes against nature," said Marc Cher
noff, 30, a member of New York's Coalition
for a Nuclear Free Harbor. "It's long overdue
to place the blame where it directly belongs.
If the products that pollute were not made
available, people would not buy them."
Trade on the New York Stock Exchange
went on as scheduled and none of the protest
ers got inside.
Shareholders consider reforms
HOUSTON (AP) — Thirteen months and
3,200 miles away, the Valdez spill again will
wash over America's largest oil company to
morrow as shareholders consider six proposals
seeking to make Exxon Corp. more ecologically
responsive.
Management opposes all six proposals, which
range from requiring Exxon to report annually
on its environmental performance to promising
to eliminate or reduce carbon dioxide or toxic
chemical emissions.
"Generally, I would like them to be respon
sible for their actions and to know there are
shareholders who care more about integrity
and responsibility than total profit," said
shareholder Anne Chapman of Denver.
