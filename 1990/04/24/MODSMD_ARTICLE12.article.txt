# Bonn agrees to one-one exchange rate
## 
### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - West Ger
many agreed yesterday to give East
Germans a bigger share of Western
wealth as their struggling nation is
merged with its rich neighbor.
In a surprising concession, West
Germany said it would exchange each
virtually worthless East German mark
paid to workers and pensioners for
one strong West German mark.
The 1-1 rate would apply to wages
and pensions and to savings accounts
of up to 4,000 marks ($2,300), said
Dieter Vogel, spokesman for West Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The East German government had
demanded the 1-1 rate to protect
workers from higher living costs in a
unified Germany and the loss of huge
subsidies that existed in the former
socialist system.
East German political factions ap
plauded the wage concession but crit
icized the limit on savings accounts.
Kohl made the proposal the day
before he was to meet with East Ger
man Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere in Bonn to discuss their dif
ferences over reunification.
It came amid reports that the num
ber of East Germans flaeing their
crumbling economy for West Germany
is continuing at a rate of more than
4,000 a week.
Under the West German economic
proposal, announced after Kohl met
with his Cabinet, personal savings of
more than 4,000 marks would be
traded at a 2-1 rate.
East German private and corporate
debts also would be converted at a 2-1
rate, Vogel said.
The West German government's pro
posal is an "important contribution"
to ending the disagreements between
the nations, East German government
spokesman Mathias Gehler said.
But Wolfgang Ullmann, vice presi
dent of Parliament, said: "If this is
the final decision, there should be
sharp protest because a large part of
savings will not be considered here."
Both governments say they will
merge their economies completely on
July 1 as a prelude to full unification,
which expected next year.

The East German mark is officially
valued at 3-1 against the West German
mark but is worth almost nothing out
side East Germany.
West Germany's central bank had
proposed a 2-1 swap, saying a 1-1 ex
change would dilute the value of the
West German mark and possibly cause
high inflation and rising interest rates.
But Vogel said the government-run
Bundesbank "has fully accepted that
this is a decision made by the federal
government."
"The Bundesbank has also accepted
that the economically prettiest solu

tion cannot always be taken," he said.
But prices on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange plunged 2.5 percent after
the announcement, their steepest
decline since January.
Many West Germans, who vote in
national elections on Dec. 2, are
worried they will bear the brunt of
absorbing the crumbling East German
economy.
Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine,
Kohl's likely opponent, yesterday ac
cused the chancellor of caving in to
pressure from the East Germans.
But the left-leaning East German

Social Democrats, who are allied with
their Western namesakes, called the
wage exchange "a step in the right
direction."
The currency exchange is a key part
of a broader proposal for unification
being put together by the Kohl gov
ernment. De Maiziere's government
came up with its own proposals two
weeks ago.
Both sides have embraced quick uni
fication, but differ on how much bur
den each nation should carry.
Talks on the strategic future of a
united Germany also are expected soon.
