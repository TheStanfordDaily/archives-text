# Lithuania runs out of oil, situation desperate
## 
### 
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Lit
huania's only refinery closed yesterday
when the Kremlin's economic blockade
dried up oil supplies, and the prime
minister said the defiant republic
might try to sell gold to import fuel.
With the Soviet sanctions pressuring
Lithuanians to ease their quest for
independence, a Lithuanian parliamen
tary delegation arrived in Moscow in
hope of meeting with President Mik
hail Gorbachev's advisers.
The refinery at Mazheikiai operated
until yesterday on reserves, dispatcher
Lidiya Cheblakova said in a telephone
interview from the refinery.
Cheblakova said that with produc
tion stopped, the refinery's 2,000
workers are now idle. "The mood is
tense, worrisome," she said.
Soviet officials shut off the oil
pipeline feeding the plant from the
Russian city of Polotsk on Wednesday
and later curtailed natural gas supplies
and shipments of other products.
It was one of the toughest actions
taken in Gorbachev's effort to make

the republic of 3.8 million people res
cind laws resulting from its March 11
declaration of independence from the
Soviet Union.
The refinery in the northwestern
town of Mazheikiai produced gasoline
for the republic as well as for Estonia,
Latvia and Byelorussia. It processed
about 12 million tons of petroleum
products a year and Lithuania used a
quarter of it.
Lithuania has virtually no foreign
currency to buy oil, but Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene said yesterday
that the republic might cash in gold
reserves it has in France. But she told
reporters in Moscow that the idea has
not been approved yet, according to
Interfax, a news service of Radio Mos
cow.
Lithuania needs about $55 million
worth of oil a month.
The Bank of France said last month
that it would return the gold in its
vaults to Lithuania i r the French gov
ernment recognizes the independent
state. Lithuania transferred gold now

worth about $28 million to France as
a precaution in the years before World
War 11.
Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters in
Sweden yesterday that she opened an
account at a Swedish bank to deposit
foreign donations for Lithuania.
In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital,
some bus routes were cut and the
main thoroughfare, Gedimina Street,
was practically devoid of vehicles as
Lithuanians struggled with gasoline
rationing that limits them to about
eight gallons a month for private cars.
The Lithuanian government has
urged all citizens to begin conserving
everything.
On the political front, a five-member
delegation from Lithuania's parlia
ment, the Supreme Council, arrived
in Moscow hoping to meeting with
members of the Presidential Council,
Gorbachev's advisory board.
Elgenius Petrov, one of the
delegates, said in a telephone interview
that the officials wanted to discuss
the blockade. He said it was not vet

clear whether the Presidential Council
would agree to the meeting.
Gorbachev and his advisers have re
peatedly rebuffed earlier Lithuanian
attempts to discuss the situation.
Arkady Maslennikov, Gorbachev's
press secretary, said he did not know
if any Soviet leaders would meet with
the Lithuanian delegation. "It depends
on what they've come with," he said
in a briefing.
Maslennikov said the Kremlin might
negotiate with Lithuania if it froze its
declaration of independence for two
years.
Lithuanian leaders repeatedly have
refused to do that, because they say
their country was forcibly annexed by
the Soviet Union in 1940 and they
consider it to be still illegally occupied.
Over the weekend, President
Vytautis Landsbergis denied reports
that the declaration of independence
would be frozen for two years in hope
of reaching a compromise with Mos
cow. But Petrov said his delegation
would consider such a proposal.
