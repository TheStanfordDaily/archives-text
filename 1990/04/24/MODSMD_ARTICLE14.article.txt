BAT AVI A, lowa (AP) — A 15-car
Amtrak passenger train derailed yes
terday, injuring more than 30 of the
400 people aboard, authorities said.
Nine cars of the eastbound Califor
nia Zephyr derailed about 1:25 p.m.
on Burlington Northern tracks, au
thorities said.
"It made a hell of a noise and then
all kind of dust started flying," said
Robert Franklin of Batavia.
"It was just one big, loud bang. Kind
of like a clankety, clang," said his wife,
Patricia.
The train was carrying 394 pas
sengers and about 20 crew members,
said Debbie Hare, an Amtrak spokes
woman in Chicago.
Thirty-three people sustained inju

ries serious enough to be taken to
hospitals, said lowa State Patrol Lt.
Ronald Moon. He said there were no
known fatalities.
"There could be other minor inju
ries; we're not aware of that," Moon
said.
Ottumwa Regional Health Center
had been told to expect 70 to 80
patients from the derailment, said
Janice Simpson, a hospital spokes
woman.
The cars began to run off the track
just before it reached a crossing on
the southern edge of this town of 525
residents, 90 miles southeast of Des
Moines. The cause of the derailment
was under investigation.
The train had 12 passenger cars and

three locomotives, Hare said. Four cars
were left on their side.
Among the passengers was Wiscon
sin State Rep. Marlin Schneider, who
was returning from the National Con
ference of State Legislatures in Boise,
Idaho, and suffered a bruise to his leg.
"We were having lunch and suddenly
the train came apart," said Schneider,
who was traveling with his two young
daughters.
"It started to buckle. Cars are off
the tracks everywhere. . . . We didn't
get hurt very badly but a number of
people did."
Schneider said it was fortunate he
and his daughters were in the dining
car and not in their sleeping car, which
tipped over.

Uninjured passengers were taken to
a community center about two blocks
away from the crash.
"The train just started shaking,"
Jasonna Gibson of Schenectady, N.Y.
said. She said she was holding her
baby, Tamu, when the train derailed.
"The baby fell. 1 tried to get him
and a lady fell on me," Ms. Gibson said.
Sections of the California Zephyr
originate in Seattle, Los Angeles and
Oakland, Calif., and are linked in Salt
Lake City for the trip to Chicago, Hare
said.
