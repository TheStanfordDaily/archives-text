Challenge rejected
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday rejected a
chemical company's challenge to
federal standards for clean water.
The court, without comment, left
intact rules that govern more than
1,000 factories producing organic
chemicals, plastics and synthetic
fibers.
The Environmental Protection
Agency adopted the guidelines in
1987 to limit pollutants dumped into
the nation's waterways.
The limits were challenged by PPG
Industries Inc. of Pittsburgh, which
said the guidelines are too stringent
and that some violations are un
avoidable.

The sth U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals rejected the company's argu
ments last year.
Ruling: to stand
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday refused to
reinstate the California murder con
viction of a Black Panther Party
member who was shackled during
his 17-month trial.
The court, without comment, let
stand a ruling that the shackling at
Johnny Spain's trial violated his
rights.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals said Spain is entitled to a new
trial or to go free because he was
forced to wear 25 pounds of chain
more than 10 hours a day while on

trial for allegedly murdering two San
Quentin prison guards.
In a 2-1 ruling last August, the
appeals court said the shackles
prejudiced the jury against Spain by
making him appear guilty. The ap
peals court said the shackles caused
him so much physical and emotional
pain it was difficult for him to assist
in his own defense.
Hank may lose millions
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday agreed to
review a ruling that, if upheld, could
cost a bank holding company over
$13 million in damages.
The court said it will decide
whether First American Bankshares
Inc. (FABI) violated federal securities

law prior to a 1987 merger of its
subsidiary Virginia Bankshares Inc.
and the First American Bank of Vir
ginia.
Woman loses appeal
WASHINGTON (AP) - An
Oregon woman who does not want
to share parenting rights with the
California man who donated his
sperm for her artificial insemination
lost a Supreme Court appenl yester
day.
The court, without comment, let
stand a ruling that Kevin Mclntyre
is entitled to a trial in seeking to
prove he donated sperm only after
Linden Crouch said she would let
him help raise the child.
