Election results suggest
that neither slate
can run the ASSU alone

THERE IS NO mandate.
Last week's ASSU elec
tions did not provide any of
the competing parties with any
sort of mEQority in the 1990-91 stu
dent government. The new senate
is a balanced mix of People's Plat
form and Students First represen
tatives, with a few independents
and Unity Party members claiming
a handful of seats.
The Council of Presidents race
was so close and so inconclusive
that the results were still up in
the air after a weekend of debate
between the slates and the ASSU
Elections Commission.
Taken together, the senate and
COP results suggest that neither
Students First nor the People's
Platform has sufficient backing to
run the student government alone.
While both parties offer much, nei
ther party is believed to be all
things to all people.
Realizing this, one must hope
that the newly elected senators and
COP will make a real effort to
work together in support of the
student body, rather than remain
at loggerheads. Since neither can
claim to represent even 50 percent
of the voters, an extra degree of

inter-party cooperation will be nec
essary to keep the ASSU from con
tinually turning against itself.
To this end, the new senators
should make their first act a com
bined effort to elect an energetic
and completely non-partisan sen
ate chair. As the person most often
saddled with the day-to-day duties
of the senate, this year's chair must
be someone open-minded and pru
dent enough to not pick sides in
the partisan battles that might
loom ahead of the new senate.
If the People's Platform and Stu
dents First instead decide to pit
"their" people against each other
in this internal election, they'll be
taking the first steps toward a self
destructive and ineffective ASSU.
One final concern brought about
by the election results is the pic
ture they paint of the campus com
munity. The even split between the
often-antithetical parties suggests
a very polarized student body, one
which the new COP and senate
will be hard-pressed to unify or
appeal to.
More disturbing is the fact that
no black or Chicano/Latino student
was elected to a voting senator po
sition. Whether this is a result of
conscious omission by voters or a
mere statistical quirk, many stu
dents of color may feel themselves
without an adequate voice in the
new student government.
We wish the new representatives
the best of luck. They're going to
need it.
