Multicultural theme house proposal needs revising

AS THE UNITED Graduate Stu
dent Alliance, we are writing this
letter in response to the April 5
letter and April 10 article on the grad
uate multicultural theme house. We
would like to clarify the nature of the
original UGSA proposal for the theme
house and make clear the reasons why
we cannot endorse the plan created by
Jean Kim, director of graduate residen
ces, and Rodger Whitney, director of
housing.
Our proposal calls for a theme house
in the Rains complex, with a 50 per
cent population of non-minority stu
dents and the other 50 percent ethnic
minority students. Furthermore, we
propose a change in the lottery system
vis-a-vis the theme house.
In other words, we indicate that
both non-minority and ethnic minority
grads should be required to submit a
project proposal to demonstrate com
mitment to the programming and goals
of the theme house. Priority should be
given to graduate students from the

Chicano/Latino, African-American,
Native American/Native Alaskan and
Asian-American communities who are
most able to benefit from such an
environment and whose proposals
reveal dedication to the theme house.
(The priority precedent has already
been established for all types of under
grad theme houses.)
Certainly the same proposal criteria
would apply to non-minority graduate
students who wish to reside in the
graduate multicultural theme house.
In the Kim/Whitney plan, based on
the lottery alone, graduate students
would be given access to either what
they call the "focal place for multira
cial living" in Rains, or to what they
call "multicultural clusters" in other
grad housing. The quality of multicul
tural programming and support in
such clusters will be inferior to that in
Rains because the multicultural theme
will compete with several other pro
grams. We believe this dilution of
purpose will seriously undermine the

objective of retaining ethnic minority
grad students by offering an inade
quate environment of support.
UGSA cannot endorse any plan that
puts a lottery before the needs of
students from our communities. Since
the draw is run entirely by chance, the
most vulnerable students may be shut
out from the most supportive environ
ment — the Rains multicultural theme
house.
Recall, the UCMI report strongly
committed this University to recruiting
and retaining ethnic minority students.
In fact, granting these students first
consideration for a theme house would
greatly enhance their retention and
academic success. It will not add to the
cost of existing resources and services
for graduate students.
At this point, we would like to em
phasize that the concept of the theme
house originated with UGSA and was
first proposed in a document presented
to University President Donald Ken
nedy, Provost James Rosse, Dean of

Graduate Studies Elizabeth Traugott
and Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons on May 24, 1988. More recently,
the March 27, 1990 letter to UGSA
from Asst. Dean Kim stated, "The
UGSA housing committee has put in
much time and energy in developing
the proposal and the (theme house)
survey... if it were not for (UGSA)
efforts we would not be implementing
the (Kim/Whitney) plan for next year."
Tragically, the Kim/Whitney plan
fails to address the philosophy of the
UGSA proposal by insisting upon the
sanctity of the draw. Unfortunately,
since no other option is available,
ethnic minority graduate students will
be forced to rely upon the roulette
wheel of multicultural housing.
