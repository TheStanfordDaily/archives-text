# Salamanca program is integral to study of humanities
## 
### 
In light of the April 16 Daily article
announcing the threat to the continua
tion of the Stanford Overseas Program
in Salamanca, the Department of
Spanish and Portuguese would like to
respond.
The Salamanca progiam is a vital
resource to this department for both
our undergraduate and graduate
studies.
Because it has shown itself over the
past 10 years to be a program of high
academic quality and of proven linguis

tic and cultural value, it has consis
tently attracted students from many
other departments and programs at
Stanford.
It enjoys the unanimous support of
the faculty, the enthusiastic support
and appreciation of the participating
students and the respect and support
of the humanities community on
campus.
Indeed, it offers one of the most
successful examples of foreign study
and experience in the entire Overseas
Studies Program.
It is also one of the most cost
effective. The base budget of the
Salamanca program in $73,800, which
represents less than one-fourth of the
costs of several of the other European
programs.
When the Action Plans for Change

Committee was formed last year, its
work was clearly not intended to cut
into academic programs, particularly
those that are central to the mission of
core disciplines in the humanities.
We call upon those responsible to
respect the spirit and policy of this
process.
