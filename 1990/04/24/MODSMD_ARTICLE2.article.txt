A Stanford School of Medicine employee
allegedly stole several hundred thousand
dollars from the Medical School, filing false
overtime reports for hours not worked and
taking unauthorized foreign vacations over
a 12-year period, according to University
investigators.
The Palo Alto police issued a warrant
this weekend for the arrest of Rose Meller,
a 55-year-old Mountain View resident and
former administrative assistant in the
Neurosurgery Department. Meller has until
Thursday to turn herself in to authorities.
An 18-month internal audit, concluded
last March, alleges that Meller bilked the
University out of an estimated $285,000
between 1976 and 1988. In current dollars,
University officials say they lost close to
$440,000 total.
According to Spyros Andreopolous, di
rector of Medical School communications,
the University has "taken the matter
seriously" and has filed a civil complaint
for financial redress.
The Santa Clara District Attorney's office
has levied a felony criminal charge of grand
theft against Meller. If found guilty, she
could spend a maximum of three years in
jail.
Meller, fired last April, could not be
reached for comment yesterday. But in a
statement appearing in Saturday's Penin-

sula Times Tribune, she denied both the
criminal and civil charges.
However, a letter sent to the Palo Alto
police by William Perron of the University
audit staff said Meller was increasing her
salary through the misappropriation and
pilfering of funds.
University officials said Meller, a 25-year
employee, "occupied a position of trust,"
and was responsible for coordinating petty
cash reimbursements to employees as well
as handling the expense report and travel
account for the entire Neurosurgery divi
sion.
Perron's letter revealed that Meller ap
parently received reimbursements for
lunches that never took place, logged over
time hours when she did not work, accessed
petty cash with altered or forged receipts
totaling over $132,000 and took excursions
to Europe which were written off as
"University-related expenses."
