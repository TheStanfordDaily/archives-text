# Group of students faked an attack to scare student
## 
### 
On April 14, I was walking home

from Tresidder Union at 11:30 p.m.
when a group of approximately 15
black men came running quickly
toward me, apparently heading toward
a black fraternity party located at
Tresidder.
When they saw me, they called out,
"Look, there's one, let's get him!"
As they ran past, three Qr four of
them lunged at me, not touching me
but intending (I believe) to intimidate
or frighten me. They continued run
ning past me, laughing aloud at this
amusement they had discovered.
I don't think such behavior is appro
priate for this campus, or indeed,
anywhere. I ask those responsible to
explain themselves.
