## Time to speak your mind

IN A COUNTRY where response to
most foreign policy issues is rooted
in unfettered emotional concern, the
muted U.S. reaction to the Lithuanian
crisis has so far been punctuated by a
cool, detached non-partisanship.
Indeed, Lithuania's declaration of in
dependence seems to some to be an in
exorable confrontation between two
parties with similarly legitimate inter
ests. Even a few pundits have admonished
Lithuania and have represented it as an
impatient, imprudent renegade that has
unnecessarily stirred up trouble for the
embattled Gorbachev.
Others have supported Lithuania's
goals but have disagreed with how it has
chosen to achieve independence. Similarly,
when the Soviets have tried to put the
best face on this conflict, they have sim
ply objected to the fact that Lithuania
is not following constitutional proce
dures.
However, both the criticism of Lit
huania's ends and means is unwarranted.
Questioning Lithuania's right to seces
sion would appear to be a very shaky
endeavor, considering that Soviet control
over this republic came about through
an unseemly agreement between Hitler's
Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union.
In fact, Gorbachev has admitted that the
Ribbentrop-Molotov accords were an ab
rogation of the Baltic states' rights and
interests.
Finally, the declaration of independence
was the work of the first democratically
elected Lithuanian legislature since
World War 11.
The legalistic posturing by Gorbachev

is equally disingenuous. These objections
over the illegality of secession — in a
country where the rule of law is a cruel
joke on its citizenry — are a complete
smokescreen which obscure the real issue.
The real issue is secession itself.
The constitutional procedures which
we are hearing so much about do not
even exist. Actually, Gorbachev is plan
ning on introducing amendments to the
constitution concerning secession at the
next legislative session of the Supreme
Soviet. This legislation is designed to
postpone independence for at least five
years. Justice delayed and denied, to put
it mildly.
The real aim is to prevent indepen
dence, not to mitigate the circumstances
surrounding it. Of course, this is under
standable because the Soviet empire will
completely come apart if any republic
manages to secede — under any circum
stances.
It seems that our mild reception to
Lithuanian independence and Bush's
refusal to recognize the republic are
motivated by our belief that "helping
Gorbachev" is the ultimate expression of
U.S. national interest. If we are prepared
to sacrifice Lithuania in the name of not
upsetting the U.S.-Soviet relationship, we
will betray not only our ideal of self
determination, but we will also lose sight
of true American interests.
"Helping Gorbachev" is not in itself
the goal of U.S. foreign policy. It is simply
the means of advancing our values and
interests. Our countenance to Soviet re
pression in Lithuania could seriously
damage our standing in the world

The real aim is to prevent
independence, not to
mitigate the circum
stances surrounding it.

community and undermine the relations
with our long-time allies.
Moreover, the breakup of the Soviet
empire should be welcomed: it will reduce
Soviet power and allow for the proper
expression of national aspirations that
have long been brutally repressed.
A sensible and positive step in our
policy toward Lithuania need not be out
right recognition, but it can't be contin
ued silence. Instead, the administration
should make a statement that the United
States considers the legitimately elected
Landsbergis government the representa
tive of the independent republic that has
existed without interruption since 1918.
Such a strategy would significantly
support the courageous Lithuanians'
struggle for independence without being
unduly provocative and intrusive. The
time has come to speak up.
