In the genre of epic fantasy,
authors are free to fully exploit
their creative talents. In fact, it
is in the very act of pushing the
bounds of the imagination that
the true strength and appeal of
epic fantasy originates.
Even so, it is a rare treat to
find a fantasy tale that takes place
in a truly original world. One fine
example of this rarity is the new
series by epic storytellers Mar
garet Weis and Tracy Hickman.
Their latest endeavor in the won
derful world of dragons and magic
is "The Death Gate Cycle," an
unprecedented series of seven
stand-alone novels that take
world-building to a new level of
artistry and complexity. To date,
only the first installment of this
grand order, "Dragon Wing," has
been delivered. For those familiar
with Weis and Hickman's 15-part
series, "Dragonlance," "The
Darksword Trilogy" or the "Rose
of the Prophet" trilogy, "Dragon
Wing" offers more of their
trademark style of writing, ever
rich. characters and an even more
intriguing story line.
"Dragon Wing" is set in the
ingenious airy world of Arianus
— a world composed of islands
floating freely in the sky. The is
lands are made of coralite, an
excrement of the coral grubbs.
The grubbs also give off gases
that support the floating islands.
Arianus is divided roughly into
three realms: the high, mid and
low. The high realm is the home
of the mysteriarchs — powerful,
dragon-riding human magicians
who have abandoned their weaker
brethren in the mid realm.
Sharing the mid realm with the
less fortunate and politically
splintered human groups are the
dominant Elves with their magi
cal dragonships. The Elf-human

war is in a brief period of remis
sion while the Elves deal with an
internal uprising.
Inhabiting the lower realm are
the dwarves, or Gegs, as they are
known on Arianus. The Gegs are
enslaved by the Elves and are
forced to deliver to them the most
precious of commodities in
Arianus, water.
With such a rich world, it comes
as no surprise to find political
intrigue as the driving force be
hind the developments in "Dragon
Wing." So, the wondrous tale
begins with King Stephen of
Volkaran enlisting the services of
the assassin Hugh the Hand to
kill his son, Prince Bane.
As if this were not thought
provoking enough, Weis and Hick
man throw in the added twist that
Bane is actually the son of
Sinistrad, the most powerful magi
of the Seven Houses and ruler of
the mysteriarchs in the high
realm. To make matters worse,
or rather more intriguing,
Sinistrad has his eye on returning
to the mid realm with his fellow
magicians and taking control of
all of Arianus.
The majority of "Dragon Wing"
follows the trail of Hugh the Hand
as he searches for the opportunity
to fulfill his contract. Along with
prince Bane, Hugh is joined by
the prince's chambermaid, Alfred.
During their time together, Hugh
begins to question his assignment
and finally comes to realize that
there is much more at stake than
just the life of one child.
Meanwhile in the lower realm,

the beginnings of a Geg uprising
against their Elfin oppressors on
the island of Drevlin are occur
ring. Led by the idealistic Kim
beck Bolttightener and the more
radical Jarre, the uprising gets an
added bonus when Kimbeck
returns from exile with an injured
god, who claims not to be a god.
This self-denying god is actually
Halpo, a Patryn.
These two groups meet up when
Hugh's dragonship wrecks on
Drevlin. They join forces with a
rebellious Elven water ship and
proceed to the high realm in order
to uncover the mystery of prince
Bane and Alfred.
Although Weis and Hickman
have set about to fill a very tall
order, "Dragon Wing" provides a
wonderful first step in the next
great series of epic fantasy.
The next volume promises to
reveal the secrets of the the realm
of fire. Volumes three and four
will reveal the realms of stone
and sea. The final three volumes
will take the characters to other
worlds beyond the Death Gate.
