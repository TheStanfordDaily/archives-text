After five years of waiting, the
millions who read Terry Brooks'
Shannara series have something
to cheer about again. "The Scions
of Shannara" is Brooks' first book
in a new series entitled "The Her
itage of Shannara."
As only he can, Brooks contin
ues to recount the ever-unfolding
history of the Four Lands and
the tale of the House of Shannara,
which is as much a part of that
history as the Four Lands them
selves. As he did with the first
Shannara trilogy, as well as his
Magic Kingdom trilogy, Brooks
creates an engrossing and enter
taining example of epic fantasy.
Brooks picks up the story 300
years after Alannon's death in
"Wishsong." Since then, much has
changed in the Four Lands. The
Elves are no longer. The Federa
tion controls the Southlands, and
it has enslaved the Dwarves.
Magic is also strictly forbidden
by the Federation. And to make
matters worse (but more interest
ing), spirit-like creatures of dark
ness roam the Four Lands in the
form of Shadowen who consume
people's souls and possess their
bodies. After all, this is epic fan
tasy.
All of this spells trouble for
Brooks' latest hero, the young Par
Ohmsford. Par has inherited the
wondrous powers of the wishsong
through the ages from his ances
tor Jair.
Par is not the only descendent
of the House of Shannara to be
affected by the times. Along with
Par, his cousin Wren from the
Westlands and uncle Walker Boh
from the Eastlands are sum
moned by Alannon's shade to visit
the Hadeshorn to learn what they
must do in order to restore bal

ance in the Four Lands.
On the dark mist-covered edges
of the Hadeshorn, Alannon be
stows upon each a quest. Par is
charged with recovering the lost
Sword of Shannara, which has not
been seen in the past hundred
years. Wren is charged with find
ing the Elves, who are also absent
for a hundred years, and restoring
them to the human world. And
finally, Walker Boh is charged
with returning the Druid stron
ghold, Paranor, to the world and
restoring the Druids.
Unfortunately, each of these
quests is grand enough to fill a
volume by itself, and that is gen
erally what Brooks has done with
them. The bulk of "Scions" fol
lows Par and his brother Coll in
their adventures after fleeing the
Federation because of Par's use
of the wishsong.
Brooks draws heavily on his
earlier Shannara epics in creating
the brothers Ohmsford's acquain
tances. Soon after fleeing
Varfleet, they meet up with Mor
gan Leah, descendent of the Rone
Leah, who protected Brin
Ohmsford in "Wishsong." Morgan
also wields the Sword of Leah
which has been handed down the
Leah family line since Rone's
time.
Although "Scions" follows the
brothers to the mysterious
Eastlands, where they meet up
with the resistance against the
Federation, it does not rely on
dramatic encounters to keep the
flow going as did the first series.
