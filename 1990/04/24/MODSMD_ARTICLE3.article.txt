# COP election validated

After nearly two hours of tense
debate, the ASSU Senate last
night validated last week's hotly
contested ASSU elections.
In the meeting, senators argued
fiercely over a Friday ruling by
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Steve Krauss, a junior, which dis
qualified 275 write-in votes for
the Council of Presidents race.
The inclusion of these votes would
have necessitated a runoff be
tween the COP slates "Four Our
Future" and "A Clean Slate."
In a 13-7 roll call vote, however,
the senate implicitly upheld
Krauss' ruling, giving victory to
"Four Our Future," the slate
sponsored by the People's Plat
form.
During the weekend, members
from Students First's "A Clean
Slate" began vigorously protest
ing Krauss' ruling, saying the dis
qualified votes should have been
counted even though they were
for ineligible slates.
The ruling centered around
whether votes for such slates as
the "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" and the "Nurk Twins"
should count toward the election

results. Krauss said Friday that
in some cases it became impossi
ble to verify which students rep
resented the write-in slates
receiving votes.
On Sunday, Krauss suspended
his ruling after meeting with Stu
dents First members. But yester
day afternoon, before the senate
meeting, he reaffirmed the deci
sion.
Chaparral editor Victor Payan,
a junior, disagreed with the
ruling. Payan said "the 'Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles' ran under
the 'Hammer and Coffin' auspi
ces." He added that people who
voted for the "Turtles" fully
realized who they were supporting
and had a valid opinion that
should be counted.
Last night the Chaparral's Da
vid Hyatt, a junior, issued a writ
ten statement to The Daily stating
that "what the senate has done
to our slate is a blatant slap in
the face of our voters. . .. These
votes are relevant, and we intend
to occupy the ASSU office until
they are recognized."
Hyatt's statement said "Ham
mer and Coffin" slate members
and their supporters would oc
cupy the ASSU office beginning
at 6:30 p.m. tonight. Perry Fried
man of the Chaparral said the

occupation would not interfere
with ASSU business.
Krauss characterized his ruling
on the write-in votes as "well
within the spirit of the
Bylaws. .. . Runoffs are an ex
treme circumstance, not some
thing we should toss around."
The "Nurk Twins" — sopho
mores Forrest Gottshalk and Rob
Wheeler — and Chaparral repre
sentatives backed the position of
"A Clean Slate" at the meeting.
"Four Our Future" member In
grid Nava, a senior, pleased with
the results of the meeting, said,
"I believe it is a fair decision. At
this point we should try to forge
unity by more productive means
(than a runoff)."
However, junior Tim Marklein,
a member of the losing Students
First slate, was disappointed after
the intense debate.
"I don't think the decision was
a fair one. It basically came down
to a partisan argument, and we
had several points that we had
not been able to make yet,"
Marklein said.
Marklein said he had no specific
plans for a next step, but he in
dicated he would "wait and see
what students say" about the
ruling.
