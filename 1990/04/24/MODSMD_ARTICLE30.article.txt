## Griffin's slam slays Warriors 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Sometime soon, pitchers are
going to learn you can't throw
around Paul Carey without get
ting into a lot of trouble.
When Carey came to the plate
in the bottom of the eighth inning
yesterday at Sunken Diamond,
the Cardinal had the bases loaded
and a one-run lead. Stanislaus
State pitcher Joe Caram, who saw
no need to have Carey take him
deep, promptly walked the Cardi
nal slugger on five pitches.

Smart move. Good strategy.
Don't get hurt by Stanford's aJl
time home run king, who earlier
in the game had broken school
career records for hits and RBI.
Pitch around him.
Pitch to someone who has more
homers than Carey this season.
That would be Tim Griffin, who
took Caram's strategy and sent it
several hundred feet south, over
the left field wall, the scoreboard,
the chain fence and several soccer
players to put the game out of
reach.
The homer, which gave Stan
ford its school-record 13th
straight victory, was Griffin's
18th of the year and his third

grand slam. For the game, Griffin
had four hits (two dongs) and five
RBI, which isn't bad for someone
who struck out nine times in last
weekend's series at Arizona.
"I felt a lot better (today)," Grif
fin said. "I'd been trying to work
on some things over the weekend:
I hadn't been swinging the bat
well before last weekend, and then
[at Arizona] I wasn't seeing the
ball too well."
Griffin'B shot took the spotlight
away from Carey, who broke the
school records for career hits and
RBI with one swing of the bat.
His single in the third inning,
which scored David McCarty and
gave the Cardinal a 3-1 lead, tied
Carey with Tom Guardino in RBI
(203) and Larry Reynolds in hits
(300).
In the fifth, after Stanislaus
had taken a 5-3 lead (thanks to
three gopher balls served up by
starter Jamie Sepeda), Carey
came up with McCarty at first.
After looking at two balls, Carey
gave the next pitch a half-hearted
swing, paused, and watched it fly

well over the scoreboard for his
52nd career home run. Five-all.
Griffin followed up with a line
drive just over the fence in left,
and center fielder Steve Solomon
made it 7-5 when he singled in
David Holbrook an out later.
Solomon was in center because
Jeff Hammonds, who was 0-for-9
in Arizona after losing his 37-
game hitting streak, was given the
day off. The reason? "Well, we're
not happy with his hitting," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess
quipped. Needless to say.
The offensive fireworks
(McCarty hit his 12th homer of
the season to start the scoring)
almost overshadowed the per
formance of freshman pitcher
Greg Mix, who came into the
middle of a huge mess in the top
of the eighth — bases loaded and
no one out — and got out of the
jam, giving up only one run to
preserve the Cardinal's lead.
Mix, who had pitched all of an
inning and a third this year, also
tossed a 1-2-3 ninth (thanks in
part to a called third strike that
was about a yard outside) for his
first career save.
"I tell you what, we get home
at 11:30 (from Arizona) and I
think to myself 'What the hell did
I schedule this for?' " Marquess
said. "And that's why: We were
able to get Mix a little experience.
He came on in a tough spot and


Stanford second baseman Troy Paulsen, who played shortstop yesterday In the Cardinal's 14-8 victory
over Stanislaus State, had two hits.
