# Hoops or hockey? NBA fouls out with fans
## 
### 
Is it just me or has an amazing transition
taken place in sports?
The NBA sucks.
Now I've always liked basketball. I was a
big fan of pro hoops for some time, and that's
saying something because the Warriors are
my favorite team. I guess if I can like them
I must really like the sport.
But somewhere between two years ago and
now the NBA's popularity rating among 22-
year-old Daily sports columnists with the in
itials CC took a big downturn. How bad is it?
Well, with the playoff races coming to a
head the past two weeks I found myself sitting
at home, changing the channel from NBA
games to pro hockey.
I hesitate to admit it but I guess I like
hockey. I mean I haven't heard of more than
about eight guys, I can hardly pronounce the
names of the guys I have heard of (Yzerman?
What the heck kind of name is that? And
how did he get a regular first name like
Steve?), and, as has been well documented by
the press, it's really tough to see the puck on
television.
But despite all this, and despite the fact
that my cable system has hoops on ESPN,
TBS, TNT and plenty of Warrior games on
PSN, I frequently look for that sport with the
ice, the skates, and the guys clubbing each
other every few minutes.
The reason is simple: The NBFA (the
National Basketball and Fouling Asso
ciation, as my Wednesday cohort Mark
Rogowsky has taken to calling it) is just not
fun to watch.
The last time I watched an NBFA game in
its entirety was a contest between Golden State
and Utah about three weeks ago. Now, this
was a high-scoring, run-and-gun affair that
the Warriors ended up winning in the last
few seconds, 125-123 or something, but it was
nowhere near entertaining.
For starters, there were about 10 technicals

called. I think Karl Malone got one, Coach
Don Nelson got one, some other guy got one
and the Warriors were called for eight illegal
defenses.
Now, rules prohibit ~zone defense.
The Warriors play more zone than WNLV.
Thus, they get called for it every now and then.
Against the Jazz they played mostly a 2-3
with a little bit of a trapping 1-3-1 thrown in
for good measure. I'm not really sure which
they were better able to conceal from the
referees, but judging from the eight illegal
defense whistles, neither was very effective.
The only other way the Warriors know how
to play defense — if you're near the guy with
the ball, run toward him; if he passes, run
toward the guy he passed to — didn't work
so well either, though.
Perhaps that's why they gave up more than
119 points a game this year.
But despite all this, Golden State managed
to win the contest. They did it because they
shot 65 free throws in the game, sinking 55.
That means that every 44 seconds, on the
average, the action stopped and a Warrior
walked to the free throw line, threw up a
swish, and play started again.
Now I don't know about you, but I don't
think that two hours of free throw shooting
is great to watch on television. Even Home
Run Derby has more action than that.
The game took about 17 hours to play be
cause of all the foul shooting, and that's just
not my cup of tea.

It could, however, be worse. I could be a
Los Angeles Lakers fan.
I don't mean to criticize the Lakers
because I think they're probably the best team
in basketball right now. But they aren't very
exciting to watch.
Here is the Lakers' offense, in a nutshell:
They give the ball to Earvin Johnson. He
dribbles upcourt. He gets inside the three
point arc and stands with his back to the
basket, about 20 feet from it.
And he just stands there and dribbles while
the guy guarding him stands between him
and the hoop. Sooner or later, and usually
well before the 24-second clock expires, some
one on the defensive team runs.over to double
team Magic.
As soon as that happens, Earvin wheels and
throws the ball to guy who is now open and
he dunks it or makes an open jump-shot. If
someone quickly switches over to this guy, he
makes one more pass to another guy who
really is open. Then that guy either dunks it
or makes an open jumper.
The reason it works is because if the guy
doesn't double-team, Magic can totally school
his dude and dunk on him.
I didn't realize that at the time because
they always did double-team, but I asked a
friend I was watching the game with why
they double-teamed him every time. He said
that if they didn't, Magic would totally school
his dude and dunk on him.
So I guess it's a pretty successful offense.
For excitement, however, it rates somewhere
between having box seats at a Wayne Newton
concert and staring at a test pattern on tele
vision.
It's a shame the game has ended up that
way. But I guess that's the only way
players that talented can play the game.
It would seem that more talented players

would be able to play a game even
more exciting than the college
game. But the guys are so good
that they can score on anyone
one-on-one because no defender
(except Joe Dumars) has the abil
ity, or perhaps the desire, to stop
anyone.

Then if they double to prevent
the drive, the open player always
makes the 22-foot jumper.. So
what do you do?
Well, the Stanley Cup playoffs
are heating up.
