# Amoroso goes out in style at NCAAs
## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
While fans of the more well
known sports were watching
the women's tennis team's win
ning streak continue and Jeff
Hammonds' hitting streak end,
a standout performer in an
other sport was making her
final entry in the Cardinal an
nals.
Senior Dina Amoroso, one of
the best female gymnasts to
ever compete for Stanford, ap
peared in her last meet for the
Cardinal at the NCAA Cham
pionships last weekend in Cor
valis, Ore.
"It was a funny feeling,"
Amoroso said, "because at
every event, I was thinking
This is my last routine.' "
Buoyed by strong perform
ances on the vault and balance
beam, Amoroso earned a total
of 37.65 points to place 32nd
in the all-around competition.
It was her third consecutive
appearance at the champion
ships, and her performances
improved each year.
Two years ago, Amoroso was
knocked out of the competition
after one event when she
sprained her ankle on the floor
exercise. Last year, although
she competed in all of the
events, she was not happy with

her performance.
"I was really happy to have
a good meet this year," she
said. "My goal was to hit my
routines, and I hit all of them."
Amoroso expressed feelings
about the conclusion of her
Stanford career. "In a way, it's
good to be done, but it's sad
because it's been such a big
part of my life."
The loss of Amoroso, as well
as Susan Banta and Becky Ash
ton, to graduation, will leave
some large spots in the lineup
to be filled next season.
In addition to the returning
all-around performers, junior
Jennifer Bloom and freshman
Erin McCann, Stanford will
have some new faces who
should make an immediate im
pact.
Canadian Kerri Kanuka
from Toronto will bring inter
national experience to the
squad. She competed for the
Canadian national team at the
1989 World Championships
and should challenge for a spot
in the lineup.
Kerrie Kelley, who hails from
Blue Springs, Mo., has com
peted at the elite level, the
highest level of gymnastic in
the United States. She will be
joined by Fremont's Laurie
West, who is well-known to Bay
Area judges.
