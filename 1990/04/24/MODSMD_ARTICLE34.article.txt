# Archambeau to Packers, joins teammates in NFL
## 
### Chris Grader Senior staff writer With AP wire reports 
While an all-expense-paid trip
to Green Bay, Wis., may not
impress your average game show
contestant, it will suit Lester Ar
chambeau just fine.
Archambeau, a senior defensive
tackle on the Cardinal football
team, was selected by the Green
Bay Packers in the seventh round
of the NFL draft yesterday Ar
chambeau was the 186 th player
taken overall and the 49th selec
tion on the second day of the
draft, which began with the sixth
round.
Teammates Rob Hinckley and
Alan Grant were selected in the
fourth round Sunday.
"I'm really happy about it," Ar
chambeau said. "They flew me out
there for a workout and I saw
the facility and met the defensive
line coach.. .. I'm pleased about
it. I really am. I've always said
I'd rather be cold than hot."
Archambeau said he watched
most of the first two rounds of
the draft on television Sunday al
though he didn't expect to be se
lected in either of those rounds.
His name was called fairly quickly
after the second day of the draft
began yesterday.
"It relieved a lot of pressure
and stress that I went early," he
said.

Archambeau would have likely
gone earlier following his junior
year but he missed much of his
senior campaign with injuries. Ar
chambeau's lack of size also
worried some scouts but his
weight is currently up to 268
pounds, about 18 more than the
weight he played at this past
season.
"I thought it was about right,"
Archambeau said of going in the
seventh round. "I thought I had
really good workouts after the
season. People were wondering
about my size and I've gained
some weight. ... I feel as good as
I've ever felt. I've gained 18
pounds and I feel like I'm just as
quick and fast as I was at 250.
"My whole philosophy is, 'Give
me an opportunity to play' —
that's all I can ask for. I'm just
happy the Packers are giving me
that opportunity."
Archambeau will attend a mini
camp in Green Bay beginning this
Sunday.
While Archambeau was pleased
with yesterday's events, a lot of
underclassmen weren't given
much in the way of good news.
After Sunday began with juniors
going as five of the first seven
choices, the number of juniors
taken dropped off rather quickly.
Only 16 of the 38 juniors who
declared for the draft were selec
ted, with only three of them being
tabbed yesterday. The other 22
had to forfeit their remaining col
legiate eligibility when they
declared and thus will not be able
to return to their college teams.
One surprise was that West Vir
ginia junior quarterback Major
Harris lasted until the middle of
the 12th and final round when
the (insert your favorite city here)
Raiders chose him. Harris had
said earlier in the day that he
was turned off by the league's
lack of interest in him and that
he was going to sign a deal with
the British Columbia Lions of the
Canadian Football League.
In another surprise, Notre
Dame quarterback Tony Rice, like
Harris a top Heisman Trophy can
didate last year, was not selected
at all. Rice was considered to be
a good runner but scouts felt he
does not have the passing ability
required of a pro.

One other running quarter
back/Heisman candidate, Air
Force's Dee Dowis, was also
passed up. In addition to being
considered too small at 5-foot-7
and not a good enough passer, he
has a five-year commitment to the
military he would have to fulfill
before being able to play profes
sionally.
One more quarterback who was
passed up Sunday went as the
first pick yesterday. Idaho Vandal
John Friesz was selcted by the
San Diego Chargers to open the
sixth round.
Friesz was expected to go
higher, perhaps even in the first
round, because of his outstanding
size and strong arm. But the
three-time Big Sky Conference
Player of the Year was hurt by a
perceived lack of mobility and was
only the ninth quarterback selec
ted overall.
"It actually doesn't surprise me
that much. I've never been the
first person chosen," said Friesz,
who was called at 6:30 a.m. to be
told the Chargers were taking

him.
"What bothers me the most is
that nobody seems to understand
why I wasn't picked on Sunday.
I don't understand. My agent
doesn't understand. I don't know
what there could be."
Many other players who ex
pected to be long gone were still
available yesterday.
Johnny Bailey, the running
back from Texas A&I who broke
Tony Dorsett's career collegiate
rushing record by gaining 6,320
yards in his career, wasn't selec
ted until the ninth round, when
Chicago took him with the 228 th
pick of the draft. Going against
him were his size — he is only
5-7, 178 pounds — and the fact
that his rushing totals declined
each year after he gained 2,011
yards as a freshman.
Terance Mathis of New Mexico,
who set NCAA records for career
catches and receiving yardage
went earlier — to the Jets on the
sixth round.
Clarkston Hines, the 164-pound
receiver from Duke who set an

NCAA record for touchdown re
ceptions, went to Buffalo ninth
round.
Meanwhile, Atlanta continued
to draft players who fit coach
Jerry Glanville's black-hat image
and the new black uniforms the
Falcons will wear. In the sixth
round, they picked running back
Mike Pringle of Cal State-
Fullerton, the nation's leader in
all-purpose yardage last season
with 2,690.
Pringle has been arrested twice
in the last month following al
tercations in barrooms, the first
of which also involved former
Washington State running back
Steve Broussard, the Falcons'
first-round pick. They join At
lanta's second-rounder, Jackson
State linebacker Darion Conner,
whom Glanville described as "like
a borderline trained killer."
The last player taken was
Demetrius Davis of Nevada-Reno,
taken by the Raiders. He will be
honored in Newport Beach, Calif,
during Irrelevant Week, the an
nual celebration for the final pick.

receiver from Duke who set an

NCAA record for touchdown re
ceptions, went to Buffalo ninth
round.
Meanwhile, Atlanta continued
to draft players who fit coach
Jerry Glanville's black-hat image
and the new black uniforms the
Falcons will wear. In the sixth
round, they picked running back
Mike Pringle of Cal State-
Fullerton, the nation's leader in
all-purpose yardage last season
with 2,690.
Pringle has been arrested twice
in the last month following al
tercations in barrooms, the first
of which also involved former
Washington State running back
Steve Broussard, the Falcons'
first-round pick. They join At
lanta's second-rounder, Jackson
State linebacker Darion Conner,
whom Glanville described as "like
a borderline trained killer."
The last player taken was
Demetrius Davis of Nevada-Reno,
taken by the Raiders. He will be
honored in Newport Beach, Calif,
during Irrelevant Week, the an
nual celebration for the final pick.
While an all-expense-paid trip
to Green Bay, Wis., may not
impress your average game show
contestant, it will suit Lester Ar
chambeau just fine.
Archambeau, a senior defensive
tackle on the Cardinal football
team, was selected by the Green
Bay Packers in the seventh round
of the NFL draft yesterday Ar
chambeau was the 186 th player
taken overall and the 49th selec
tion on the second day of the
draft, which began with the sixth
round.
Teammates Rob Hinckley and
Alan Grant were selected in the
fourth round Sunday.
"I'm really happy about it," Ar
chambeau said. "They flew me out
there for a workout and I saw
the facility and met the defensive
line coach.. .. I'm pleased about
it. I really am. I've always said
I'd rather be cold than hot."
Archambeau said he watched
most of the first two rounds of
the draft on television Sunday al
though he didn't expect to be se
lected in either of those rounds.
His name was called fairly quickly
after the second day of the draft
began yesterday.
"It relieved a lot of pressure
and stress that I went early," he
said.

Archambeau would have likely
gone earlier following his junior
year but he missed much of his
senior campaign with injuries. Ar
chambeau's lack of size also
worried some scouts but his
weight is currently up to 268
pounds, about 18 more than the
weight he played at this past
season.
"I thought it was about right,"
Archambeau said of going in the
seventh round. "I thought I had
really good workouts after the
season. People were wondering
about my size and I've gained
some weight. ... I feel as good as
I've ever felt. I've gained 18
pounds and I feel like I'm just as
quick and fast as I was at 250.
"My whole philosophy is, 'Give
me an opportunity to play' —
that's all I can ask for. I'm just
happy the Packers are giving me
that opportunity."
Archambeau will attend a mini
camp in Green Bay beginning this
Sunday.
While Archambeau was pleased
with yesterday's events, a lot of
underclassmen weren't given
much in the way of good news.
After Sunday began with juniors
going as five of the first seven
choices, the number of juniors
taken dropped off rather quickly.
Only 16 of the 38 juniors who
declared for the draft were selec
ted, with only three of them being
tabbed yesterday. The other 22
had to forfeit their remaining col
legiate eligibility when they
declared and thus will not be able
to return to their college teams.
One surprise was that West Vir
ginia junior quarterback Major
Harris lasted until the middle of
the 12th and final round when
the (insert your favorite city here)
Raiders chose him. Harris had
said earlier in the day that he
was turned off by the league's
lack of interest in him and that
he was going to sign a deal with
the British Columbia Lions of the
Canadian Football League.
In another surprise, Notre
Dame quarterback Tony Rice, like
Harris a top Heisman Trophy can
didate last year, was not selected
at all. Rice was considered to be
a good runner but scouts felt he
does not have the passing ability
required of a pro.

One other running quarter
back/Heisman candidate, Air
Force's Dee Dowis, was also
passed up. In addition to being
considered too small at 5-foot-7
and not a good enough passer, he
has a five-year commitment to the
military he would have to fulfill
before being able to play profes
sionally.
One more quarterback who was
passed up Sunday went as the
first pick yesterday. Idaho Vandal
John Friesz was selcted by the
San Diego Chargers to open the
sixth round.
Friesz was expected to go
higher, perhaps even in the first
round, because of his outstanding
size and strong arm. But the
three-time Big Sky Conference
Player of the Year was hurt by a
perceived lack of mobility and was
only the ninth quarterback selec
ted overall.
"It actually doesn't surprise me
that much. I've never been the
first person chosen," said Friesz,
who was called at 6:30 a.m. to be
told the Chargers were taking

him.
"What bothers me the most is
that nobody seems to understand
why I wasn't picked on Sunday.
I don't understand. My agent
doesn't understand. I don't know
what there could be."
Many other players who ex
pected to be long gone were still
available yesterday.
Johnny Bailey, the running
back from Texas A&I who broke
Tony Dorsett's career collegiate
rushing record by gaining 6,320
yards in his career, wasn't selec
ted until the ninth round, when
Chicago took him with the 228 th
pick of the draft. Going against
him were his size — he is only
5-7, 178 pounds — and the fact
that his rushing totals declined
each year after he gained 2,011
yards as a freshman.
Terance Mathis of New Mexico,
who set NCAA records for career
catches and receiving yardage
went earlier — to the Jets on the
sixth round.
Clarkston Hines, the 164-pound
receiver from Duke who set an

NCAA record for touchdown re
ceptions, went to Buffalo ninth
round.
Meanwhile, Atlanta continued
to draft players who fit coach
