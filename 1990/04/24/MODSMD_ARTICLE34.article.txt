While an all-expense-paid trip
to Green Bay, Wis., may not
impress your average game show
contestant, it will suit Lester Ar
chambeau just fine.
Archambeau, a senior defensive
tackle on the Cardinal football
team, was selected by the Green
Bay Packers in the seventh round
of the NFL draft yesterday Ar
chambeau was the 186 th player
taken overall and the 49th selec
tion on the second day of the
draft, which began with the sixth
round.
Teammates Rob Hinckley and
Alan Grant were selected in the
fourth round Sunday.
"I'm really happy about it," Ar
chambeau said. "They flew me out
there for a workout and I saw
the facility and met the defensive
line coach.. .. I'm pleased about
it. I really am. I've always said
I'd rather be cold than hot."
Archambeau said he watched
most of the first two rounds of
the draft on television Sunday al
though he didn't expect to be se
lected in either of those rounds.
His name was called fairly quickly
after the second day of the draft
began yesterday.
"It relieved a lot of pressure
and stress that I went early," he
said.

Archambeau would have likely
gone earlier following his junior
year but he missed much of his
senior campaign with injuries. Ar
chambeau's lack of size also
worried some scouts but his
weight is currently up to 268
pounds, about 18 more than the
weight he played at this past
season.
"I thought it was about right,"
Archambeau said of going in the
seventh round. "I thought I had
really good workouts after the
season. People were wondering
about my size and I've gained
some weight. ... I feel as good as
I've ever felt. I've gained 18
pounds and I feel like I'm just as
quick and fast as I was at 250.
"My whole philosophy is, 'Give
me an opportunity to play' â€”
that's all I can ask for. I'm just
happy the Packers are giving me
that opportunity."
Archambeau will attend a mini
camp in Green Bay beginning this
Sunday.
While Archambeau was pleased
with yesterday's events, a lot of
underclassmen weren't given
much in the way of good news.
After Sunday began with juniors
going as five of the first seven
choices, the number of juniors
taken dropped off rather quickly.
Only 16 of the 38 juniors who
declared for the draft were selec
