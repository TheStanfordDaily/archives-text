# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Sometimes it just comes down to the num
bers.
Two Cardinal seniors who have been
around long enough to know posted some
big (or, where appropriate, small) numbers
over the weekend, and led their respective
Stanford squads to impressive victories. For
all they do, this week's Daily Athletes of
the Week awards go to Lisa Green and
Mark Funseth.
Green, a senior from San Jose and captain
of the women's tennis team, played the final
home match of her illustrious career Sat
urday. She went out in style, pasting Linda

Allred of USC 6-1, 6-1 at No. 5 singles. On
Friday, Green made similarly short work of
UCLA's Allegra Milholland 6-1, 6-4.
Green, has performed at the highest level
of women's collegiate tennis for four years,
despite being denied the spotlight on talent
laden Cardinal teams. As evidence of her
outstanding ability, witness Green's per
formance at the NCAA singles tournament:
three appearances, three semifinal berths.
Don't be surprised if the best No. 5 singles
player in the country makes it four-for-four
this May. Green, Stanford's only senior
starter, is 22-2 in singles this season.
More importantly, the Cardinal has put
up incredible team numbers while Green
has been on the Farm. Stanford is working
on a 61-match win streak, and has won four
consecutive NCAA crowns. Green has been
a big part of the last three of those, and is
a good bet to lead the charge to a fourth a
month from now.

Funseth, who hails from Napa, Calif., has
not put up the numbers of a Lisa Green.
On the contrary, Funseth has been making
himself known by posting exceptionally low
scores for the streaking Cardinal men's golf
team.
Funseth won last weekend's Cardinal In
tercollegiate Invitational by shooting two
low rounds on Friday, giving him a lead
that carried him to the individual title. His
69 and 67 led to a four-under-par 209 and
helped the Cardinal to their fourth win of
the season.
Funseth's win was not without dramatics,
however. USC's Bryan Pemberton came
back to tie the score going into the final

hole of the 54-hole tournament. But while
Funseth came away with a par four on the
18th, Pemberton bogeyed to lose by one
stroke.
Like Green, Funseth won in his final home
appearance of his career. He will represent
the Cardinal at NCAA regionaJs in late May
in Las Cruces, N.M,
