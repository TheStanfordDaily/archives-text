# Heptathlon doesn't bore Odita

### J.B. Barr 
Peggy Odita doesn't like to be bored.
Considering this personality trait, it's
not surprising the senior competes in
the heptathlon for Stanford track team,
perhaps the most demanding of all wom
en's track and field events.
"I can't sit and do one thing — 1 get
bored," Odita explains. "I have to do
new things and add a little twist every
once in a while."
She added a big twist to her track
and field career when she began com
peting in the heptathlon the summer
after her senior year in high school.
Odita's high school coach urged her to
enter the event at a junior national
meet, which she promptly won. It was
only the second heptathlon she had ever
entered.
In high school, Odita concentrated on
the high jump and had managed to clear
a very promising 6-foot-l 1 height. But
she haa such great overall athletic abil
ity that the switch to heptathlon (which
is comprised of the 100-meter hurdles,
high jump, shotput, 200-meter sprint,
long jump, javelin, and 800-meter race)
was a natural one.
"I never planned it that way," she
says."I was just a high jumper who
happened to do other events, too."
She didn't just "do" the other events
when she came to Stanford. She com
peted in them well enough to qualify
for the NCAA meet in the heptathlon
her freshman year.
"You spread yourself really thin (in
the heptathlon)," Odita says, which ex
plains why she enters only three per
year. "To move up levels you have to
work at it a long time."
Nevertheless, Odita prefers to do the
heptathlon rather than focusing on the
high jump because of her competitive
ness. "It's easier to concentrate solely
on one event, but I'd be bored."
"Peggy is a jack of all trades, a master
of men. She's a great all-around ath
lete," fellow heptathlete Jen Jauquet
says. "She's great to train with because
she's always one step ahead of me."
Unfortunately, Odita fell a few steps
behind during her freshman year when
she suffered a stress fracture in her left

'The injury changed my way of thinking. I
almost put all my eggs in one basket. But, I
realized something like this could happen at
any time. Now I have school to fall back on.'

leg. The injury required surgical remove
of a cyst that had formed around the
fracture. As a result, she sat out her
sophomore year to let the leg recover.
"[The injury] set her back eighteen
months," Cardinal Coach Brooks
Johnson says. "She's had to come back
a long way to compete."
The iryury was hard for Odita to deal
with mentally. The hardest part was
that she had to "sit still for a year,"
something that is definitely not at the
top of her list of favorite things to do.
The injury was perhaps a blessing in
disguise, however, as it forced Odita to
look at her career a little differently.
She became more involved with school,
and is now double-meyoring in design
and product design.
"The injury changed my way of think
ing. I almost put all my eggs in one
basket. But, I realized something like
this could happen at any time. Now I
have school to fall back on."
With renewed enthusiasm for the
sport, Odita came back healthy last year
for her junior season and set a personal
best and school record with 5,439 points
at the Texas Relays. She went on to
place third in a tough field at the Pacific
10 Championships and then finished
14th at NCAAs.
"I was so ready for nationals (last
year)," she says.
Only a mishap in the hurdles cost
her a personal best and possible All-
American (top eight) finish. She re
corded personal bests in the javelin (133
feet), the 200 (25.7 seconds), and the
800 (2:20) at the meet, but bashed into
the seventh hurdle and stumbled before
finishing two seconds behind her best
time.

"There's no doubt in my mind I would
have been All-American,' she says.
Odita will have another shot at Ail-
American at this year's NCAA meet May
30-June 2. She qualified for the meet
at the Texas Relays at the beginning of
April.
Although she hasn't equaled her
school-record heptathlon score of last
year, Odita says her increased focus on
NCAAs gives her a good chance to
record a personal best there.
"I know I'm stronger," she says."I
just need my confidence to come
around."
At college meets, all seven events are
completed in a grueling two-day format.
To be successful, the athlete must be
focused and perform consistently both
days. Despite the physical rigors, "the
heptathlon is a mental event," according
to Odita.
Placing more mental focus on her
weaker events, Odita says that she has
become a better all-around heptathlete
this year. In particular, two of the field
events that were once weak spots are
now her most consistent. "I've improved
technique-wise in the shot put and
javelin," she said.
Due to her injury, Odita has another
year of eligibility after this season. She
is excited to come back next year, believ
ing that another year of development
will bring her closer to reaching her
potential.
"I've got some things I still want to
do in track," she says."I know the
potential is there. Some day things will
come together and it will be really
awesome."
Hopefully that day will come before
she decides the heptathlon is a little
too boring.

plains why she enters only three per
year. "To move up levels you have to
work at it a long time."
Nevertheless, Odita prefers to do the
heptathlon rather than focusing on the
high jump because of her competitive
ness. "It's easier to concentrate solely
on one event, but I'd be bored."
"Peggy is a jack of all trades, a master
of men. She's a great all-around ath
lete," fellow heptathlete Jen Jauquet
says. "She's great to train with because
she's always one step ahead of me."
Unfortunately, Odita fell a few steps
behind during her freshman year when
she suffered a stress fracture in her left

'The injury changed my way of thinking. I
almost put all my eggs in one basket. But, I
realized something like this could happen at
any time. Now I have school to fall back on.'

leg. The injury required surgical remove
of a cyst that had formed around the
fracture. As a result, she sat out her
sophomore year to let the leg recover.
"[The injury] set her back eighteen
months," Cardinal Coach Brooks
Johnson says. "She's had to come back
a long way to compete."
The iryury was hard for Odita to deal
with mentally. The hardest part was
that she had to "sit still for a year,"
something that is definitely not at the
top of her list of favorite things to do.
The injury was perhaps a blessing in
disguise, however, as it forced Odita to
look at her career a little differently.
She became more involved with school,
and is now double-meyoring in design
and product design.
"The injury changed my way of think
ing. I almost put all my eggs in one
basket. But, I realized something like
this could happen at any time. Now I
have school to fall back on."
With renewed enthusiasm for the
sport, Odita came back healthy last year
for her junior season and set a personal
best and school record with 5,439 points
at the Texas Relays. She went on to
place third in a tough field at the Pacific
10 Championships and then finished
14th at NCAAs.
"I was so ready for nationals (last
year)," she says.
Only a mishap in the hurdles cost
her a personal best and possible All-
American (top eight) finish. She re
corded personal bests in the javelin (133
feet), the 200 (25.7 seconds), and the
800 (2:20) at the meet, but bashed into
the seventh hurdle and stumbled before
finishing two seconds behind her best
time.

"There's no doubt in my mind I would
have been All-American,' she says.
Odita will have another shot at Ail-
American at this year's NCAA meet May
30-June 2. She qualified for the meet
at the Texas Relays at the beginning of
April.
Although she hasn't equaled her
school-record heptathlon score of last
year, Odita says her increased focus on
NCAAs gives her a good chance to
record a personal best there.
"I know I'm stronger," she says."I
just need my confidence to come
around."
At college meets, all seven events are
completed in a grueling two-day format.
To be successful, the athlete must be
focused and perform consistently both
days. Despite the physical rigors, "the
heptathlon is a mental event," according
to Odita.
Placing more mental focus on her
weaker events, Odita says that she has
become a better all-around heptathlete
this year. In particular, two of the field
events that were once weak spots are
now her most consistent. "I've improved
technique-wise in the shot put and
javelin," she said.
Due to her injury, Odita has another
year of eligibility after this season. She
is excited to come back next year, believ
ing that another year of development
will bring her closer to reaching her
potential.
"I've got some things I still want to
do in track," she says."I know the
potential is there. Some day things will
come together and it will be really
awesome."
Hopefully that day will come before
she decides the heptathlon is a little
too boring.

Because of her great athletic abilities, Peggy Odlta switched to the heptathlon after
high jumping in high school.
Peggy Odita doesn't like to be bored.
Considering this personality trait, it's
not surprising the senior competes in
the heptathlon for Stanford track team,
perhaps the most demanding of all wom
en's track and field events.
"I can't sit and do one thing — 1 get
bored," Odita explains. "I have to do
new things and add a little twist every
once in a while."
She added a big twist to her track
and field career when she began com
peting in the heptathlon the summer
after her senior year in high school.
Odita's high school coach urged her to
enter the event at a junior national
meet, which she promptly won. It was
only the second heptathlon she had ever
entered.
In high school, Odita concentrated on
the high jump and had managed to clear
a very promising 6-foot-l 1 height. But
she haa such great overall athletic abil
ity that the switch to heptathlon (which
is comprised of the 100-meter hurdles,
high jump, shotput, 200-meter sprint,
long jump, javelin, and 800-meter race)
was a natural one.
"I never planned it that way," she
says."I was just a high jumper who
happened to do other events, too."
She didn't just "do" the other events
when she came to Stanford. She com
peted in them well enough to qualify
for the NCAA meet in the heptathlon
her freshman year.
"You spread yourself really thin (in
the heptathlon)," Odita says, which ex
plains why she enters only three per
year. "To move up levels you have to
work at it a long time."
