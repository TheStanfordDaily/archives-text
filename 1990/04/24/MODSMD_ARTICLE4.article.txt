# Search for professors over
## Two offered positions in Asian-American Studies 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
The highly publicized and con
troversial search for Stanford's
first scholar in Asian-American
studies could culminate in the ad
dition of not just one, but two,
new faculty members.
Both Georgetown University
English Prof. David Palumbo-Liu
and UC-Irvine History Prof. Gor
don Chang have been offered
tenure-track assistant professor
ships based on the "enthusiastic"
recommendation of the search
committee, according to chair Syl
via Yanagisako, an assistant
professor of anthropology.
Both Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas and the
departments that the professors
will enter concurred with the
search committee's recommenda
tion to hire Palumbo-Liu and
Chang, she said.
Palumbo-Liu has accepted the
position and will be teaching in
the Comparative Literature De
partment starting fall quarter
1990.

Chang has been
offered a position
in the History
Department, but
has not yet ac
cepted the posi
tion. "Negotia
tions are still
goi n g on,"
Yanagisako said.
The search for

Stanford's first Asian-American
scholar is the culmination of many
years' efforts by the Asian-
American community to get the
University to commit to Asian-
American Studies.
When the University did not
offer Chang a tenure-track assis
tant professorship in 1989 when
he was still a history lecturer,
Chang left for UC-Irvine, leaving
Stanford without any courses
focusing on Asian-American
studies.
The decision not to promote
Chang to a tenure-track position
was one of the catalysts for the
May 15 takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice.

Afterward, a
tenure-track posi
tion for an
Asian-American
studies professor
was established,
and an interdis
ciplinary search
committee
comprised of fac
ulty, community

members and students was
formed.
The search committee faced
controversy in February when one
of its three finalists for the posi
tion, Cornell University Sociology
Prof. Victor Nee, withdrew his
candidacy during a final interview
presentation and then described
ethnic studies as "moving back
wards."
Despite everything that has
happened, Yanagisako said she is
"incredibly happy" with the out
come. "The search was as success
ful as we could have hoped," she
said.
