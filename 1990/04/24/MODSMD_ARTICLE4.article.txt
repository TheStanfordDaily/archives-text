# Search for professors over
## Two offered positions in Asian-American Studies 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
The highly publicized and con
troversial search for Stanford's
first scholar in Asian-American
studies could culminate in the ad
dition of not just one, but two,
new faculty members.
Both Georgetown University
English Prof. David Palumbo-Liu
and UC-Irvine History Prof. Gor
don Chang have been offered
tenure-track assistant professor
ships based on the "enthusiastic"
recommendation of the search
committee, according to chair Syl
via Yanagisako, an assistant
professor of anthropology.
Both Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas and the
departments that the professors
will enter concurred with the
search committee's recommenda
tion to hire Palumbo-Liu and
Chang, she said.
Palumbo-Liu has accepted the
position and will be teaching in
the Comparative Literature De
partment starting fall quarter
1990.

Chang has been
offered a position
in the History
Department, but
has not yet ac
cepted the posi
tion. "Negotia
tions are still
goi n g on,"
Yanagisako said.
The search for

Stanford's first Asian-American
scholar is the culmination of many
years' efforts by the Asian-
American community to get the
University to commit to Asian-
American Studies.
When the University did not
offer Chang a tenure-track assis
tant professorship in 1989 when
he was still a history lecturer,
Chang left for UC-Irvine, leaving
Stanford without any courses
focusing on Asian-American
studies.
The decision not to promote
Chang to a tenure-track position
was one of the catalysts for the
May 15 takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice.

Afterward, a
tenure-track posi
tion for an
Asian-American
studies professor
was established,
and an interdis
ciplinary search
committee
comprised of fac
ulty, community

members and students was
formed.
The search committee faced
controversy in February when one
of its three finalists for the posi
tion, Cornell University Sociology
Prof. Victor Nee, withdrew his
candidacy during a final interview
presentation and then described
ethnic studies as "moving back
wards."
Despite everything that has
happened, Yanagisako said she is
"incredibly happy" with the out
come. "The search was as success
ful as we could have hoped," she
said.
Yanagisako pointed to the fact

that interdisciplinary searches
have the potential of being rather
complicated and difficult "because
you have got to match your needs
with the individual departmental
needs." It is common in searches
of this kind to end in no positions
being offered, she said.
However, "the potential for two
Asian-American scholars makes a
great difference for fulfilling the
need of Asian-American studies,"
she said.
By offering two positions rather
than the originally intended one,
the University "would make a

strong gesture of support for
Asian-American studies,"
Yanagisako said.
"It is more preferable than
hiring one person because the load
doesn't fall on one professor," she
said. "Since the requirement is
that only half of the courses the
professor will teach will be in
Asian-American studies, then one
professor could only teach two
courses on Asian-American
studies."
The contract stipulates that a
professor will teach four courses
a year from his department, two
focused on Asian-American
studies and two based on his other
scholarly interests.
Ron Nakao, a graduate student

in Education and one of two stu
dent members on the search com
mittee, said "there will be greater
effectiveness with two scholars.
History and Comparative Litera
ture will work well together."
He added that "the two schol
ars, if they both come, can serve
as catalysts and work with the
Asian-American professors here
now."
Although he believes it is too
early to talk about the possibility
of an Asian-American Studies pro
gram, Nakao said that two new
Asian-American scholars at Stan
ford would "allow for more inter
action" among all Asian
mericans at Stanford, and conse
quently would serve as a "good
basis for a program to eventually
emerge from that process."
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of
student affairs and the director
of the Asian American Activities
Center, agreed with Nakao, saying
that the possibility for a program

must be taken "one step at a
time."
Yuen added that in the past,
the Activities Center and entities
such as Stanford Workshops On
Political and Social Issues courses
were the only sources of informa
tion one could get on Asian-
American studies.
The addition of the two profes
sors "institutionalizes Asian
American studies," he said. "It's
an exciting time, a remarkable
step for Stanford in terms of its
commitment to multicul
turalism."
Palumbo-Liu is already slated
to teach "Readings in Asian-
American Novels" in the fall and
"Readings in Asian-American
Short Fiction" in the spring. Both
classes are offered through the
Comparative Literature Depart
ment.
Yanagisako said she encourages
all Stanford students to seek out
these courses.
