# Applying to be a resident assistant is as tough as the job itself
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
If being a resident assistant is difficult,
some say the application process gives
prospective RAs a good idea of what's in
store for them.
Several of this year's applicants say
the process, which for them runs from
the beginning of March to the middle of
May, causes a great deal of stress and
can hamper academic work.
But potential RAs are not the only
ones who find themselves overburdened.
Staff at the Office of Residential Educa
tion must channel hundreds of applica
tions to the appropriate resident fellows,
who in turn spend a month reviewing
applications and interviewing candidates.
The RA application process began the
first week of March when interested stu
dents attended informational meetings
and discussions with current RAs. The
first week of spring break, applicants
could attend large-group meetings with
RFs of various houses before submitting
their applications by April 6.
Now, RFs and current RAs are in the
process of interviewing selected candi
dates. After reviewing applications, indi
vidual RFs and current RAs reduce the
pool and select some students for first
round interviews, which usually ran from
20 to 40 minutes.

The RFs and RAs then further reduce
the pool and hold second-round inter
views before making the final selections.
Each house announces its final decisions
on May 14.
For applicants, RFs, current RAs and
Res Ed staff alike, this process amounts
to a complicated, frustrating and time
consuming experience.
"I've resigned myself to the fact that
it's going to take the entire quarter to
do this," sophomore Merrill Langfitt said
of the application process. She added that
her decision to apply was "definitely a
factor" in her decision to take only 14
units this quarter.
"My RAs warned me it's a very frus
trating, arbitrary and kind of silly proc
ess," said one applicant who wished to
remain anonymous. "The process takes
such a long time, and it interrupts your
academic life because interviews are
scheduled during midterms."
Donner RA James Assey, a senior,
called the application process "incredibly
stressful," from the time spent complet
ing the application to interviewing with
RFs and RAs. In the interviews, the RFs
like to test "how well you think on your
feet," which can put pressure on the ap
plicant, Assey said.
According to Rinconada RA John
Reimers, a fifth-year coterminal student,
"you read so many applications [that]

surface impressions and recommenda
tions" are more important.
In addition, applicants and RAs have
criticized Res Ed's method of notifying
candidates whether they have been se
lected for an interview. Because each
house or dorm has a specific call-in date,
applicants must phone Res Ed during a
two-hour time slot for each date over a
three-week period, depending on how
many houses the candidates have applied
to.
"It's a pain because you have to wait
for someone to pick the phone up, most
of the time it's busy, and you only have
two hours in which to call," the anony
mous applicant said. She added that be
cause there is only one number with
three lines "that everybody and their
mother is using," applicants may find it
very hard to get through.
The applicant also pointed out that
because "most people apply to several
houses, they must call in several times.
I think it's inconvenient," she said.
While Langfitt said the call-in process
"isn't as bad as some have made it out
to be," she did add that on one day she
"had to use the redial button 20 times"
before getting through to Res Ed.
Sometimes the call-in process does not
always provide applicants with the cor
rect information. Assey said when he
called in last year, he was told he had

not been selected for any interviews. "But
two days later, they called back and said
I had five," Assey said. As a result, he
had two days left in which to schedule
the interviews.
According to Clare Dolan, coordinator
of residential staff selection, Res Ed hopes
to streamline the process next year by
replacing the call-in system with a com
puter system in which applicants can log
on with a secret code, find out where
they have been selected to interview and
sign up for an interview slot.
Aside from Res Ed's role in the call-in
process, Dolan said the RA application
system "is very decentralized."
Ann Porteus, Roble Hall resident fellow
and assistant director of Residential Ed
ucation, said that for RFs, the application
reviewing and interviewing process
"takes an incredible amount of time."
Yet despite the amount of time RFs
put into the selection process, some ap
plicants say they still don't have the
chance to meet and talk with the RFs.
Although RFs hold large informational
meetings with applicants the first week
of spring quarter, Assey said, "In very
rare exceptions do they give you a sense
of what the RF is about." Because they
are "extremely limited in what they can
show you," Assey said the meetings are
often reduced to merely "putting the RF
on a stage for five minutes."

Langfitt agreed, saying that while one
can ask questions of the RFs at large
group meetings, "you really don't meet
them."
Porteus said that in some cases, the
burden of learning more about the RFs
and various houses falls "on the appli
cant's shoulders."
Portpus added, "I wish we had a chance
to get to know the people better," but
the large volume of applicants, amount
of work to be done and time limit prevent
that. Last year, she and her husband
Evan read 150 to 200 applications be
tween the two of them, spending about
half an hour reviewing each one.
This does not even count the time spent
interviewing candidates and further re
viewing applications to make additional
cuts. Porteus described the month-long
process as "grueling," especially since she
and her husband both hold full-time jobs.
As one applicant said, through the proc
ess of applying to be an RA, "already
you've learned that you have to deal with
a lot of Res Ed red tape."
Overall, though, Assey said the "gains
are so fantastic" from being an RA. As
a result, he said he is especially "sad
when the number [of applicants] goes
down. A lot of qualified people may get
scared away" by the time commitment
and responsibility.

process as "grueling," especially since she
and her husband both hold full-time jobs.
As one applicant said, through the proc
ess of applying to be an RA, "already
you've learned that you have to deal with
a lot of Res Ed red tape."
Overall, though, Assey said the "gains
are so fantastic" from being an RA. As
a result, he said he is especially "sad
when the number [of applicants] goes
down. A lot of qualified people may get
scared away" by the time commitment
and responsibility.
If being a resident assistant is difficult,
some say the application process gives
prospective RAs a good idea of what's in
store for them.
Several of this year's applicants say
the process, which for them runs from
the beginning of March to the middle of
May, causes a great deal of stress and
can hamper academic work.
But potential RAs are not the only
ones who find themselves overburdened.
Staff at the Office of Residential Educa
tion must channel hundreds of applica
tions to the appropriate resident fellows,
who in turn spend a month reviewing
applications and interviewing candidates.
The RA application process began the
first week of March when interested stu
dents attended informational meetings
and discussions with current RAs. The
first week of spring break, applicants
could attend large-group meetings with
RFs of various houses before submitting
their applications by April 6.
Now, RFs and current RAs are in the
process of interviewing selected candi
dates. After reviewing applications, indi
vidual RFs and current RAs reduce the
pool and select some students for first
round interviews, which usually ran from
20 to 40 minutes.

The RFs and RAs then further reduce
the pool and hold second-round inter
views before making the final selections.
Each house announces its final decisions
on May 14.
For applicants, RFs, current RAs and
Res Ed staff alike, this process amounts
to a complicated, frustrating and time
consuming experience.
"I've resigned myself to the fact that
it's going to take the entire quarter to
do this," sophomore Merrill Langfitt said
of the application process. She added that
her decision to apply was "definitely a
factor" in her decision to take only 14
units this quarter.
"My RAs warned me it's a very frus
trating, arbitrary and kind of silly proc
ess," said one applicant who wished to
remain anonymous. "The process takes
such a long time, and it interrupts your
academic life because interviews are
scheduled during midterms."
Donner RA James Assey, a senior,
called the application process "incredibly
stressful," from the time spent complet
ing the application to interviewing with
RFs and RAs. In the interviews, the RFs
like to test "how well you think on your
feet," which can put pressure on the ap
plicant, Assey said.
According to Rinconada RA John
Reimers, a fifth-year coterminal student,
"you read so many applications [that]

surface impressions and recommenda
tions" are more important.
In addition, applicants and RAs have
criticized Res Ed's method of notifying
candidates whether they have been se
lected for an interview. Because each
house or dorm has a specific call-in date,
applicants must phone Res Ed during a
two-hour time slot for each date over a
three-week period, depending on how
many houses the candidates have applied
to.
"It's a pain because you have to wait
for someone to pick the phone up, most
of the time it's busy, and you only have
two hours in which to call," the anony
mous applicant said. She added that be
cause there is only one number with
three lines "that everybody and their
mother is using," applicants may find it
very hard to get through.
The applicant also pointed out that
because "most people apply to several
houses, they must call in several times.
I think it's inconvenient," she said.
While Langfitt said the call-in process
"isn't as bad as some have made it out
to be," she did add that on one day she
"had to use the redial button 20 times"
before getting through to Res Ed.
Sometimes the call-in process does not
always provide applicants with the cor
rect information. Assey said when he
called in last year, he was told he had

not been selected for any interviews. "But
two days later, they called back and said
I had five," Assey said. As a result, he
had two days left in which to schedule
the interviews.
According to Clare Dolan, coordinator
of residential staff selection, Res Ed hopes
to streamline the process next year by
replacing the call-in system with a com
puter system in which applicants can log
on with a secret code, find out where
they have been selected to interview and
sign up for an interview slot.
Aside from Res Ed's role in the call-in
process, Dolan said the RA application
system "is very decentralized."
Ann Porteus, Roble Hall resident fellow
and assistant director of Residential Ed
ucation, said that for RFs, the application
reviewing and interviewing process
"takes an incredible amount of time."
Yet despite the amount of time RFs
put into the selection process, some ap
plicants say they still don't have the
chance to meet and talk with the RFs.
Although RFs hold large informational
meetings with applicants the first week
of spring quarter, Assey said, "In very
rare exceptions do they give you a sense
of what the RF is about." Because they
are "extremely limited in what they can
show you," Assey said the meetings are
often reduced to merely "putting the RF
on a stage for five minutes."

Langfitt agreed, saying that while one
can ask questions of the RFs at large
group meetings, "you really don't meet
them."
Porteus said that in some cases, the
burden of learning more about the RFs
and various houses falls "on the appli
cant's shoulders."
Portpus added, "I wish we had a chance
to get to know the people better," but
the large volume of applicants, amount
of work to be done and time limit prevent
that. Last year, she and her husband
Evan read 150 to 200 applications be
tween the two of them, spending about
half an hour reviewing each one.
This does not even count the time spent
interviewing candidates and further re
viewing applications to make additional
cuts. Porteus described the month-long
process as "grueling," especially since she
and her husband both hold full-time jobs.

ess of applying to be an RA, "already
