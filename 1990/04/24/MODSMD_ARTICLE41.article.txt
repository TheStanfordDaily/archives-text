# For women, ROTC involves physical training, leadership and sexism
## 
### Leina Johansson 
Senior Jennifer Curtis says
people have to rethink their per
ception of her when they learn
she is training to be an officer in
the Navy.
"I don't have an M-16 in my
room," she jokes.
Performing in spite of
stereotypes is part of the experi
ence for the 16 Stanford women
who have enrolled in the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps.
The program has three main
components: physical training,
leadership lab and military sci
ence classes. Participants spend
approximately five hours a week
in ROTC-related activities, in ad
dition to their regular classes.
Sophomore Vanessa Perry, an
Army ROTC participant, calls
ROTC "a process of accepting
what's been given to me, to handle
challenge."
In areas such as the infantry,
where women have traditionally
been excluded, Perry thinks that
"some prejudices have formed."
In other areas, "it's not a big
deal," she says."The new guys
are accepting," even though that
hasn't always been the case.
Other women in the program
have noticed that sexism is still
not a thing of the past.
"We carry just as much, as fast,
as long," says Dawn McGuinness,
also in the Army ROTC. "There's
just as much sexism as in regular
life, [butl more in certain con
texts, because of the fact that the
Army has been all-male for so
long."
Junior Trina Finley says she
definitely noticed some forms of
sexism in her basic training with
the Army last summer. The
recruits were of both sexes, but

the drill sergeants were all men
and were accustomed to working
with men full-time.
"They don't know how to han
dle you," she says. "Sometimes
they're even nervous around you.
Then the other men get mad, be
cause [the drill sergeants] don't
talk to you the same."
Finley says some of the
cadences they sing while marching
are sexist, but other women see
her as overly sensitive.
"Not everyone is as sensitive to
racism and sexism" as members
of the Stanford community, Fin
ley says. "It's difficult to explain
why you're offended when other
women don't mind."
Kristen Johnson, vice
commander of the Air Force
ROTC unit says,"The male
dominated environment [of the
Air Force] is challenging. I had to
prove to myself that I could ac
complish the tasks in that envi
ronment and hold a leadership
position in that environment.
"For me, it's a challenge to be
able to command and maintain
my femininity, not be just one of
the guys," Johnson continues.
Leaders are required to "project
a strong image, an image that
says 'I'm in command.' It might
not come as naturally for women."
Curtis says she feels that wom
en's roles in the Navy are "very
limited." When officers address
her class, they spend their time
speaking about opportunities for
men, she says. "Information is
more readily available to the
men," Curtis says."I had to do
some looking on my own."
Training is "geared to men,"
Curtis says. During the summer,
each Navy ROTC participant
must complete a week of work
within the submarine, aviation,

Marine Corp or surface "com
munities."
But both submarine and avia
tion duty are very difficult for
women to obtain, if not impossi
ble, Curtis explains. Surface work
is extremely competitive for wom
en, since, by default, it is the most
common choice.
In general, the men also have
more flexibility about scheduling.
"Like my freshman year," Curtis
says,"I had to go on ship during
finals week."
There is a lot of networking
among the women, Curtis adds.
"We have to look out for each
other in a way the men don't have
to."
When members of ROTC move
into the regular armed service
duty, they start out as officers.
To prepare them for the leader
ship positions, the cadets receive
specialized training.
Senior Gina Kim says that she
becomes more disciplined when
attending ROTC programs.
Everything she wears must be
pressed, and she can't show up
in sweats or shorts. "It's some
thing to be proud of, to be an
officer of the United States," Kim
says.
Perry says she would refuse to
be an enlisted soldier because the
Army has much more respect for
officers. "It's like you have a mind
if you're an officer," she explains.
"I can't really be a follower."
Curtis, Finley and Johnson say
that family history of military
service partly influenced their de
cisions to join ROTC.
Finley also says that in high
school she always had something
to be involved in and committed
to. ROTC filled that gap for her
at Stanford. "It's more physical
than a sorority," says Finley, who

was a member of the Delta
Gamma sorority. Curtis, McGuin
ness and Perry are also involved
in sororities on campus.
Johnson joined ROTC because
she was motivated to serve the
United States. The military "is
not the way everybody should
serve their country, [but] there's
a price to pay for freedom," she
says.
These women pay that price
through the commitment they
make to the program, which
begins at college and continues
for several years after graduation.

Military scholarships help them
pay for tuition at Stanford, but
to be eligible, recipients must
serve for eight years in either ac
tive or reserve duty.
"I had to sign my name like 20
or 30 times," Perry says."It was
like, 'Oh God, I'm signing my life
away.' "
Although Stanford does not
have its own ROTC program,
about 100 students attend classes
taught by staff from Santa Clara
University.
Perry continues, "You have to
make decisions about your life

after graduation when I don't
even know what classes I'm taking
next quarter."
Leaving the ROTC program
after the first year is very diffi
cult, and as Kim explains, it would
appear as a breach of contract.
However, the women inter
viewed did not suggest that they
were looking for a way out of the
program. Finley has even joined
a regular Army reserve unit, and
says she follows the officers
around like a "puppy dog." She
has decided to stay in the reserves
for a full 20 years.

Gamma sorority. Curtis, McGuin
ness and Perry are also involved
in sororities on campus.
Johnson joined ROTC because
she was motivated to serve the
United States. The military "is
not the way everybody should
serve their country, [but] there's
a price to pay for freedom," she
says.
These women pay that price
through the commitment they
make to the program, which
begins at college and continues
for several years after graduation.

Military scholarships help them
pay for tuition at Stanford, but
to be eligible, recipients must
serve for eight years in either ac
tive or reserve duty.
"I had to sign my name like 20
or 30 times," Perry says."It was
like, 'Oh God, I'm signing my life
away.' "
Although Stanford does not
have its own ROTC program,
about 100 students attend classes
taught by staff from Santa Clara
University.
Perry continues, "You have to
make decisions about your life

after graduation when I don't
even know what classes I'm taking
next quarter."
Leaving the ROTC program
after the first year is very diffi
cult, and as Kim explains, it would
appear as a breach of contract.
However, the women inter
viewed did not suggest that they
were looking for a way out of the
program. Finley has even joined
a regular Army reserve unit, and
says she follows the officers
around like a "puppy dog." She
has decided to stay in the reserves
for a full 20 years.

Glna Kim, Vanessa Perry and Krlsten Johnson are three of the 16 Stanford women enrolled In the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps.
Senior Jennifer Curtis says
people have to rethink their per
ception of her when they learn
she is training to be an officer in
the Navy.
"I don't have an M-16 in my
room," she jokes.
Performing in spite of
stereotypes is part of the experi
ence for the 16 Stanford women
who have enrolled in the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps.
The program has three main
components: physical training,
leadership lab and military sci
ence classes. Participants spend
approximately five hours a week
in ROTC-related activities, in ad
dition to their regular classes.
Sophomore Vanessa Perry, an
Army ROTC participant, calls
ROTC "a process of accepting
what's been given to me, to handle
challenge."
In areas such as the infantry,
where women have traditionally
been excluded, Perry thinks that
"some prejudices have formed."
In other areas, "it's not a big
deal," she says."The new guys
are accepting," even though that
hasn't always been the case.
Other women in the program
have noticed that sexism is still
not a thing of the past.
"We carry just as much, as fast,
as long," says Dawn McGuinness,
also in the Army ROTC. "There's
just as much sexism as in regular
life, [butl more in certain con
texts, because of the fact that the
Army has been all-male for so
long."
Junior Trina Finley says she
definitely noticed some forms of
sexism in her basic training with
the Army last summer. The
recruits were of both sexes, but

the drill sergeants were all men
and were accustomed to working
with men full-time.
"They don't know how to han
dle you," she says. "Sometimes
they're even nervous around you.
Then the other men get mad, be
cause [the drill sergeants] don't
talk to you the same."
Finley says some of the
cadences they sing while marching
are sexist, but other women see
her as overly sensitive.
"Not everyone is as sensitive to
racism and sexism" as members
of the Stanford community, Fin
ley says. "It's difficult to explain
why you're offended when other
women don't mind."
Kristen Johnson, vice
commander of the Air Force
ROTC unit says,"The male
dominated environment [of the
Air Force] is challenging. I had to
prove to myself that I could ac
complish the tasks in that envi
ronment and hold a leadership
position in that environment.
"For me, it's a challenge to be
able to command and maintain
my femininity, not be just one of
the guys," Johnson continues.
Leaders are required to "project
a strong image, an image that
says 'I'm in command.' It might
not come as naturally for women."
Curtis says she feels that wom
en's roles in the Navy are "very
limited." When officers address
her class, they spend their time
speaking about opportunities for
men, she says. "Information is
more readily available to the
men," Curtis says."I had to do
some looking on my own."
Training is "geared to men,"
Curtis says. During the summer,
each Navy ROTC participant
must complete a week of work
within the submarine, aviation,

Marine Corp or surface "com
munities."
But both submarine and avia
tion duty are very difficult for
women to obtain, if not impossi
ble, Curtis explains. Surface work
is extremely competitive for wom
en, since, by default, it is the most
common choice.
In general, the men also have
more flexibility about scheduling.
"Like my freshman year," Curtis
says,"I had to go on ship during
finals week."
There is a lot of networking
among the women, Curtis adds.
"We have to look out for each
other in a way the men don't have
to."
When members of ROTC move
into the regular armed service
duty, they start out as officers.
To prepare them for the leader
ship positions, the cadets receive
specialized training.
Senior Gina Kim says that she
becomes more disciplined when
attending ROTC programs.
Everything she wears must be
pressed, and she can't show up
in sweats or shorts. "It's some
thing to be proud of, to be an
officer of the United States," Kim
says.
Perry says she would refuse to
be an enlisted soldier because the
Army has much more respect for
officers. "It's like you have a mind
if you're an officer," she explains.
"I can't really be a follower."
Curtis, Finley and Johnson say
that family history of military
service partly influenced their de
cisions to join ROTC.
Finley also says that in high
school she always had something
to be involved in and committed
to. ROTC filled that gap for her
at Stanford. "It's more physical
than a sorority," says Finley, who

was a member of the Delta
Gamma sorority. Curtis, McGuin
ness and Perry are also involved
in sororities on campus.
