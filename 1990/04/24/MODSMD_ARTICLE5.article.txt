## New People's Platform senator is GOP member 
### Jeannie Heltzel 
Some students would say there are few things
more antithetical to the People's Platform than the
Republican party. But sophomore Bill Candeleria,
a Republican ASSU senator-elect and People's Plat
form party member, is eager to show campus closet
Republicans that Stanford student government isn't
so far left that moderate voices cannot be heard.
"It's definitely hard to tell people at Stanford my
national party affiliation, especially because of the
assumptions they make when I tell them I'm part
of the People's Platform," Candeleria said.
When the Chaparral called Candeleria to interview
him for their ASSU election issue, he debated re
vealing that he is a Republican, not because his
ties to the party are weak, but because he is sensitive
to the negative ideas many students have about the
party.
"The Chappie was a little shocked when I told
them I'm a Republican, since they knew the People's
Platform had endorsed me. Out of all of the can
didates (for ASSU Senate), I was the only one who
listed myself as Republican," Candeleria explained.
"If all of the candidates were being honest, it's
unfortunate that Republicans do not feel that they
will be treated as legitimate candidates."
It also irritates Candeleria that many students
associate the extremely conservative ideas of The
Stanford Review and the College Republicans with

Sophomore Bill Candelerla, a member of People's Platform
Party, says people at Stanford make certain assumptions when
he tells them he's a Republican.
the National Republican Party.
"The GOP is far more inclusive
and moderate than the Stanford
Republicans, and the Stanford
Review is not officially associated
with the College Republicans,"
Candeleria explained.
Similar to the extreme political
ideas many students associate
with the Republican Party, the
People's Platform has been

misperceived by many students as
"revolutionary" and closed to stu
dent input, Candeleria said.
"The People's Platform is far
more inclusive than the image
many students have of it. It's not
as if anyone (in the People's Plat
form) persecutes me for being a
Republican," Candeleria said.
"They recognize that though I am
associated with a different na
tional party, my opinions on
campus issues such as multicul
turalism are very similar to
theirs."

Since the beginning of the year
Candeleria, a member of MEChA,
has worked closely with the Office
of Residential Education in plan
ning two new theme houses, one
for Latin American Studies and
another for African Studies. He
sees these houses as filling gaps
in ethnic studies at Stanford.
But how does Candeleria's af
filiation with the Republican
Party mesh with multicul
turalism, which is seen by many
as a "liberal" goal? "I strongly
believe that multiculturalism is

going to have to be a bipartisan
issue on the national level if it is
to see any progress," Candeleria
explained.
"I don't see any reason for me
to switch (national) parties be
cause of my interest in these is
sues," he said. "Stanford is on
the cutting edge in the advance
of multiculturalism, and I see the
National Republican Party slowly
adapting to the changing national
demographics which call for
recognition of different eth
nicities."
