## New People's Platform senator is GOP member 
### Jeannie Heltzel 
Some students would say there are few things
more antithetical to the People's Platform than the
Republican party. But sophomore Bill Candeleria,
a Republican ASSU senator-elect and People's Plat
form party member, is eager to show campus closet
Republicans that Stanford student government isn't
so far left that moderate voices cannot be heard.
"It's definitely hard to tell people at Stanford my
national party affiliation, especially because of the
assumptions they make when I tell them I'm part
of the People's Platform," Candeleria said.
When the Chaparral called Candeleria to interview
him for their ASSU election issue, he debated re
vealing that he is a Republican, not because his
ties to the party are weak, but because he is sensitive
to the negative ideas many students have about the
party.
"The Chappie was a little shocked when I told
them I'm a Republican, since they knew the People's
Platform had endorsed me. Out of all of the can
didates (for ASSU Senate), I was the only one who
listed myself as Republican," Candeleria explained.
"If all of the candidates were being honest, it's
unfortunate that Republicans do not feel that they
will be treated as legitimate candidates."
It also irritates Candeleria that many students
associate the extremely conservative ideas of The
Stanford Review and the College Republicans with
