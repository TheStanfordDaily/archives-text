A "viable alternative" to Roman
Catholicism is how Father George
Stallings described his breakaway
church to a standing-room-only
crowd last night in the Branner
Hall lounge.
Stallings, the senior pastor and
founder of the African-American
Catholic Congregation, explained
the reasons behind his break with
the Roman Catholic Church and
the philosophy of the new order.
"As Afro-Americans, we could
no longer afford to worship white
gods in black houses," said the
flamboyant speaker. Stallings ex
plained the stifling structure of
the traditional Roman Catholic
Church, an institution that he
said has been "formed and shaped
by a Eurocentric world view" and
does not "minister holistically" to
the needs of African-Americans.
Last July, the African-American
Catholic Congregation declared its
autonomy and independence and
since then, the priest has been a
focus of controversy. Although the
pope has not excommunicated

'We could no longer
afford to worship
white gods.'

him, Stallings said that in Febru
ary "we excommunicated our
selves from the Roman Church."
Stallings compared his own
movement with Martin Luther
King Jr. 's struggle for civil rights.
He explained that, like white in
stitutions in the '60s, the Roman
Catholic Church has attempted to
steer minorities away from action
and lull them into a "Rip Van
Winkle sleep" of inaction and ap
athy.
"The Roman Catholic Church
has essentially told me 'we agree
with your message but not your
method,' " Stallings said. "They
have told us to back off and wait,
but waiting is counterproductive
and only makes people more com
placent and apathetic."
Stallings recalled the history of
Catholicism, noting that the faith

actually had its foundations in
Northern Africa and was later
adopted by Europeans. "The
Roman Catholic Church does not
have a monopoly, patent or
trademark on the word 'Cat
holic,' " he said.
Unlike the Roman Catholic
Church, in the African-American
Catholic Congregation, birth con
trol is accepted, women can be
ordained priests and gays and les
bians are "welcomed and
embraced" by the church, Stall
ings said. While his congregation
does not advocate abortion, "we
have no right to interfere with
conscience. Ultimately, individ
uals must be accountable for their
own actions," Stallings said.
He described the masses he
holds at Washington, D.C.'s Imani
Temple as "all the way live and
electric" and said that people of
all races are welcomed to join the
church's celebration.
"When you find a religious ex
perience that makes you feel bet
ter when you leave than when you
came in, hang on to it and never
let it go," he said.
