Woman punched
outside trailer
A man assaulted a 20-year
old female student at 3 a.m.
yesterday when she walked out
of her trailer in Manzanita
Park.
The assailant, described only
as a 6-foot white male with
shoulder-length hair, grabbed
the woman, spun her around
and punched her, said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
According to Niemeyer, the
woman then ran off screaming
through the bushes and con
tacted police, who took her to
the Medical Center, where she
was treated for a swollen cheek
and scratches. The police have
no leads, said Niemeyer.

New magazine shows
Stanford as Hell
The first issue of "Actual
Malice," a new humor maga
zine, will be distributed today
in dorms and other typical
drop-off points.
Contributing editor David
Hornik said the magazine fol
lows the "Spy model of ironic

oriented magazine than, say,
the Chaparral."
The theme of the 24-page
issue is "Stanford as Hell" and
includes "cynical humor about
Stanford and its relationship
to Hell," Hornik said. Four
thousand copies will be distrib
uted.
Meyer entrance
closed indefinitely
The Meyer Library entrance
facing the sculpture of the
Thinker was closed indefinitely
last night when an elbow
shaped steel rod fell from a
sign hanging outside the fourth
floor of Meyer.
The sign was hung last week
in honor of Earth Day.
Library officials decided to
close the entrance for safety
reasons because they feared an

other rod supporting the sign
could fall in the wind.
"Someone was clever enough
to to get it up there; we just
want them to take it down,"
said Sandy Ward, a reference
librarian.
However, she added, "I
thought it was a nice sign, and
I was glad to have it there all
week."
