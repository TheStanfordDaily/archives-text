# 100 stage protest to keep Dead alive
## Ralliers hope Lyons will reverse decision to prohibit concert 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
The Dead were alive yesterday — at least
in the hearts of more than 100 students
who gathered in White Plaza to protest the
University's banning of the traditional
Grateful Dead concerts at Frost Amphithea
ter.
At the noon rally, protesters — bedecked
in tie-dyed T-shirts and other traditional
Dead regalia — listened to music and a few
speeches protesting Stanford's decision to
discontinue the annual concerts, usually
scheduled for two days in May.
Freshman James Reichmuth, one of the
rally's organizers, said yesterday's protest
was an attempt to draw attention to the
concert issue. He called the rally a
"wholesome and generic show of our sup
port" of the Dead.
Organizers said they collected more than
300 signatures for a petition yesterday. They
intend to present the petition to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons when they
meet with him today.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, last year's Grateful Dead con
certs were a severe security problem, with
40 arrests for drug and other violations.
He said his officers would have made "two
to three times the number" of arrests had
more officers been present during the con
certs. Herrington cited widespread, open
drug sales as indicative of the problems last
year.
One problem Herrington pointed to was
the so-called "camping and vending" that
has taken place in past years. Camping and
vending refers to the activities of Dead fol
lowers who camp out near the concert site
and sell T-shirts, posters, crafts and other
paraphernalia.
But organizers of yesterday's rally said

the camping and vending would not be a
problem if the Dead plays this year.
Sophomore Steve Gunn said the Dead had
stopped selling vending permits and that
future Stanford concerts would not involve
the widespread camping and vending prob
lems they have in the past.
Several protesters emphasized that Stan
ford is an important part of Grateful Dead
history.
Several of the Dead's early shows took

place on campus — in the Arroyo House
lounge, as well as in the Oak Lounge of
Tresidder Union.
One protester also objected to the "double
standard" he claims the University has by
"passive approval" of drug abuse at frater
nity parties and sports events but prohibi
tion of Dead concerts for the same
motivations.
Plainclothed police officers were also in
attendance at the rally.
