# Survey says . . .
## Seniors give high marks to Stanford 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Seven hundred eighty seniors
surveyed. Top 10 answers are
on the board. Here's the ques
tion. ... What do you think of
Stanford?
The seniors of 1990 gave the
University high ratings in the
annual Senior Survey, but they
also expressed a mix of bit
tersweet observations about
the Farm.
Fifty-two percent of Stan
ford's 1,498 seniors responded
to a series of questions about
dorm life, course quality, fac
ulty teaching, overseas study,
teaching assistants and finan
cial aid. The Registrar's Office
and a University research com
mittee prepared the report.
This year's response rate was
higher than in 1987 and 1988,
when 31 and 38 percent re
sponse rates were recorded,
respectively. The survey was
not conducted last year.
Although 81 percent of the
respondents rated the general
quality of undergraduate edu
cation as "very good" or "ex
cellent," others expressed
reservations about faculty ac
cessibility outside of class. Ac
cording to the report, 42
percent said such opportunities
"were at best fair."
The seniors had mixed reac
tions about the University's
emphasis on cultural
pluralism. "I think it's great —
the rest of the country should
catch up," one student wrote.
Another said there has not
been enough concrete action:
"Lots of talk, still not very
many of my professors are
women and people of color."
But another said there has
been "too much emphasis. I
think Stanford is dangerously
heading toward multi
separatism, not pluralism."
Between 31 and 43 percent
of the respondents said finan
cial constraints and school-year
employment adversely affected

Faculty acces
sibility was 'fair at
best' for 42 percent.

various parts of their Stanford
career, such as overseas study,
volunteer service and research.
"Working blocked off a lot of
my time, and I wasn't able to
handle all the academics," one
senior wrote.
In response to the same
question, another student indi
cated a desire to take courses
beyond the 12th quarter, when
financial aid runs out. "Do you
realize in four years I only took
one course that was not a
[distribution requirement! or
major requirement?" the senior
wrote.
To pay for their Stanford ed
ucation, the biggest single
source of funds for seniors was
parental contribution from
earnings, savings and assets,
which constituted 51 percent
of the total paid.
The seniors of 1990 related
a wide spectrum of good and
bad experiences. Some positive
events were "coming to terms
with my ethnic identity," "en
lightenment" and "dorm life,
friends and programming,
going overseas and dancing on
the Berlin Wall."
But one student did not like
the pre-professional atmos
phere. "Do you take [a] class
to glorify your transcript? Do
you volunteer for your resume?
Unfortunately, here in the
early '90s, I think the answer
is yes."
One senior wrote about
"closed-minded residents I had
to live with," while another
wrote that because he is a
white male in a fraternity "it
is assumed that 1 am fascist
and insensitive."
One senior had a problem on
a smaller social scale, writing,
"I hit a walker while riding mv
bike."
