"Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, One Stu
dent, One Vote" read the sign held
aloft by students who peacefully
occupied the ASSU offices in
Tresidder Union last night.
Strumming a guitar, listening
to music and reading biology
notes, more than 20 students pro
testing Monday's ASSU election
validation made themselves com
fortable and prepared for a long
stay.
The protest began at a 6:30 p.m.
and will continue "indefinitely"
until the validation is recon
sidered, said graduate student
Perry Friedman, spokesperson for
the group which calls itself Stu
dents United for Fair Elections.
The sit-in follows a 13-7 ASSU
Senate vote Monday evening
which upheld Elections Commis
sioner Steve Krauss' decision to
disqualify 275 write-in ballots for
the Council of Presidents race.
Were they not disqualified, these
votes would have forced a runoff
between "Four Our Future" and
"A Clean Slate," the two COP
contenders.
On Monday morning Krauss
ruled that these votes were not
eligible and should not be counted,
a move which gave victory to
"Four Our Future," the People's
Platform slate. Krauss' interpre
tation of the ASSU Bylaws dis
qualified the write-in votes
because they were for fictional
characters or incomplete slates.
Among the protesters was one
of the "Nurk Twins," several stu
dents who claimed after the elec
tion to be members of the
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"

slate and a number of students
who believed the senate decision
was unjust. The "Nurk Twins,"
"Chaparral" and "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles" all re
ceived votes in the COP election.
Participants in the sit-in em
phasized that the protest came
about not because the Students
First-sponsored "A Clean Slate"
lost but because their votes, which
they say registered some opinion,
were not counted.
Several Chaparral members dis
tributed a flier yesterday claiming
that the People's Platform
dominated senate had dis
enfranchised students who voted
for write-in slates. The Chaparral
members called for a reversal of
the senate decision, intervention
by University administrators or a
discussion of the ruling in front
of an independent, unbiased body.
Although the Chaparral's Fried
man planned the protest and
several Chaparral members were
in attendance, he stressed that
"this is not a Chaparral function
â€” this is an independent func
tion."
Friedman plans to circulate a
petition around dormitories today.
As of last night, 60 signatures
had been gathered on the petition.
He also encouraged others to show
support for the protest by wearing
black armbands.
Graduate student Joe Brenner,
one of the protesters, indicated
his dissatisfaction with the sen
ate's procedures in general.
"I'm here because it seems like
every year there's some kind of
sleazy maneuver by the people in
power to manipulate the results
of the election," Brenner said.
