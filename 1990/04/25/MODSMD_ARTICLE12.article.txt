Jihad targets Americans
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — A group calling
itself Islamic Jihad Movement-Jerusalem said
yesterday it would launch attacks against
Americans unless the U.S. Senate reverses a
motion endorsing a united Jerusalem as Isra
el's capital.
The group made the threat in an Arabic
language typewritten statement delivered to
Beirut's An-Nahar newspaper.
"The American Senate should reverse its
decision in 10 days, or else every American
inside and outside Moslem countries will be
a target of terrorism and revenge," said the
statement.
Train wreck investigated
BATAVIA, lowa (AP) — Crews worked to
clear overturned Amtrak cars from twisted
train tracks yesterday and federal investigators
began looking for clues to the cause of the
derailment that injured 91 people.
Investigators said the 16-car train appar
ently was traveling within the speed limit when
eight cars left the tracks Monday afternoon.
Only about a dozen people remained hospi
talized yesterday. There were no deaths.
National Transportation Safety Board offi
cials said preliminary findings of the investi
gation would not be released.
Train robber shot
MARBELLA, Spain (AP) — A member of
the gang that carried out Britain's great train
robbery of 1963 was shot to death by a young
assailant who fled on a bicycle, police in this
seaside resort said yesterday.
Investigators believe the slaying of Charles
Wilson, 58, may have been drug-related, said
a Marbella police spokesman who asked not
to be identified.
Wilson and 14 other members of a gang
took part in what has been called the "great
train robbery" on Aug. 8, 1963, when they
held up the Glasgow to London mail train
near Aylesbury, 40 miles northwest of London.
They stole 2.6 million pounds, then worth
$7.2 million. At the time, it was the biggest
robbery in Britain.
Coup leaders executed
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) — Sudan's mil
itary government yesterday executed more
than half of the participants in an alleged
coup attempt less than 24 hours after their
coup was crushed.
A statement broadcast by official Radio Om
durman said 28 officers, including three
retired generals and a brigadier, were executed
by firing squad after a summary court-martial.
Military tribunals continued to work. A
colonel was acquitted but the trial of other
officers alleged to be involved in the coup was
still going on.
Zaire allows opposition
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Bowing to weeks
of pressure, President Mobutu Sese Seko said
yesterday he had lifted a 20-year ban on op
position parties and would let a multiparty
government replace his in a year.
Thousands of Zaireans chanting, singing and
waving branches poured into downtown Kin
shasa, the capital, and blocked the streets to
cheer the president's decision.
Mobutu, absolute ruler since taking power
Nov. 24, 1965, announced in a nationally
broadcast speech that he was setting up a
transitional government to rule until free elec
tions could be held. No election date was set.
Unification date set
BONN, West Germany (AP) — Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere yesterday named July 2
as the day for economic and social union of
the two Germanys, a West German spokesman
said.
Union in those areas will bring the divided
nation a long way toward full unification after
more than four decades of separation following
the horror of the Nazi dictatorship and defeat
in World War 11.
The issue of political union, or holding an
election to form a single government, remains
to be worked out.
Spy flights cancelled
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The United States
curtailed spy flights focused on Colombian
drug traffickers after allegations that a U.S.
aircraft nearly collided with two Colombian
planes, a newspaper reported yesterday.
The Defense Department scaled back the
program under pressure from the Colombian
government, which had approved the missions
on condition they be kept secret, the Los An
geles Times reported, citing unidentified
sources.
Information from the spy flights has been
used in a Colombian manhunt for Pablo Es
cobar, the reputed head of the Medellin cocaine
cartel, the Times said.
Air Force scraps missiles
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Preferring its
bombers to missiles, the Air Force has pro
posed canceling deployment of MX missiles on
rail cars and slowing Midgetman missile pro
duction to meet budget limits, a newspaper
reported yesterday.
The Air Force also recommended producing
65 B-2 stealth bomber 3, rather than the 132
radar-evading planes originally sought, the Los
Angeles Times said.
In so doing, the Air Force is urging Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney to shift the bulk of
the U.S. nuclear deterrent force from land
based missiles to bombers and submarine
launched missiles, unidentified Pentagon
sources told the Times.
