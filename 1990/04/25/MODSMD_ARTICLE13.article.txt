# Milken agrees to pay $600 million penalty

### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Michael Milken,
the billionaire financier who reshaped
Wall Street in the 1980s but fell in
its biggest scandal, tearfully pleaded
guilty yesterday to breaking federal
securities and tax laws. He agreed to
pay a record $600 million in penalties.
Milken, 43, broke down before the
packed Manhattan courtroom as he
finished a lengthy statement outlining
his crimes, which included illegal
trading with stock speculator Ivan
Boesky and others from 1984-86.
"I realize by my acts I have hurt
those who are closest to me. I am
truly sorry," Milken said. He had to
be supported by his attorney and his
voice cracked when he pleaded,
"Guilty, your honor."
Milken faces a maximum 28 years
in prison at his scheduled Oct. 1 sen
tencing before U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood, although legal experts
expect a term of around five years.
The plea marked a stunning victory
in the government's crackdown on Wall
Street crime that already included
more than 30 convictions and targeted
Milken and his former employer,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., from
its outset in 1986.
Milken was widely regarded as the
most important American financier
since J.P. Morgan Jr. in the early
1900s. His personal fortune is said to
exceed $1 billion, and he came to sym
bolize the bounty and excesses of a
booming Wall Street.
Milken pioneered the use of high
yield, high-risk debt securities known
as junk bonds that gave small com
panies access to billions of dollars and
made possible the wave of hostile cor
porate takeovers that characterized
the dog-eat-dog 1980s.
His downfall began after he was
linked to an insider trading network
by Boesky, who received a three-year
prison term and was fined $100 million
in 1986 to settle his own case.
Milken was indicted on 98 counts
of fraud and racketeering in March
1989, but vigorously maintained his
innocence. He reversed course last
week and agreed to the plea bargain,
avoiding a long, costly trial and the
prospect of a much stiffer prison term.

Richard Breeden, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission,
said in Washington that Milken's ad
missions "demonstrate that he stood
at the center of a network of manip
ulation, fraud and deceit."
Milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy,
securities fraud, mail fraud, helping
others violate federal securities regu
lations and assisting in the filing of a

false tax return.
Far less severe than the original
indictment, the counts do not involve
racketeering or unlawful securities
trading based on inside information.
The racketeering charge carried a min
imum 20-year prison term and possible
forfeiture of Milken's wealth.
"The charges are a far cry from the
lurid, irresponsible and prejudicial ac

cusations against Michael that have
been made by anonymous sources to
the press for the past three and a half
years," Milken attorney Arthur Liman
said after the plea.
Under the settlement, Milken agreed
to pay $200 million in fines to the
Justice Department and $400 million
for a civil fund for reimbursing inves
tors defrauded by his actions.


Michael Milken and his wife emerge from U.S. District Court in New York yesterday after earlier pleading e aullty
to six criminal charges and agreeing to pay a $600 million fine.
