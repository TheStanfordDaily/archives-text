CAPE CANAVERAL, Tla. (AP) - Seven
years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is
where it belongs: out of this world and in
search of others so distant that they may
have been formed at the beginning of time.
Less than five hours after it rode into
space aboard the shuttle Discovery yester
day, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first
test radio signal. At the sign of life, ap
plause and cheers erupted at the Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland where
astronomers monitored their spacecraft.
"As near as we can tell, everything looks
perfect," said astronaut Steve Hawley from
the shuttle. Hawley's job today will be to
drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year
stay in space.
Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke
into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver
colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles
above Earth â€” higher by 70 miles than

any previous shuttle. There, the Hubble
will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders
of creation with instruments that can look
14 billion years backward in time.
Each trip around the Earth was taking
the Discovery crew 97.3 minutes, longer
than on any previous shuttle flight because
of the altitude. The view was different, too.
"Our window on the universe!" NASA
launch commentator George Diller exulted
as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch
pad.
"It's a beautiful day to have Hubble
Space Telescope in orbit instead of here
on Earth like it's been for so many years,"
said NASA administrator Richard Truly.
"Hubble's in its element, and I'm
delighted."
The telescope was supposed to be
launched in 1983.
