ATLANTA (AP) - A smiling
gunman in a business suit
opened fire in the food court
of a shopping mall yesterday,
killing one man and wounding
four other people before calmly
walking out and surrendering.
The man surrendered to
DeKalb County police outside
the mall just after the 8:35 a.m.
shootings, said police spokes
man Chuck Johnson.
The gunman, who gave his
name as James Calvin Brady,
31, of Atlanta, would be
charged with one count of mur
der and four counts of ag
gravated assault, Johnson said.
"He looked like a business

man with his left hand in his
pants pocket," said Carol Grav
dahl, a store manager at
Perimeter Mall. "His right arm
was straight out with a pistol,
shooting it off randomly. He
was coming around with it un
til I guess he emptied it...
"He just walked in and
started shooting," she said.
"He was very casual."
After emptying his .38-
caliber snub-nose revolver, the
gunman walked to a table, un
loaded the empty shells and
was about to reload when an
unidentified person standing
nearby talked him out of it,
Johnson said.
