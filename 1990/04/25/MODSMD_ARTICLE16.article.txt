WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush held off yesterday on sanctions
against the Soviet Union for its crack
down on Lithuania, saying he wanted
to avoid any steps that would "set
back the progress that has been made
in Eastern Europe."
Bush said any actions that might
be token would most likely be "on the
economic side" but would not include
a grain embargo.
"I'm concerned that we not inad
vertently do something that compels
the Soviet Union to take action that
would set back the whole case of free
dom around the world," Bush said
after a meeting with congressional
leaders.

Later, he told members of the As
sociated General Contractors at a
White House meeting, "1 don't want
to do something that would inadver
tently set back the progress that has
been made in Eastern Europe."
Shortly after Bush's spoke, Presi
dent Vytautas Landsbergis of Lit
huania issued an angry statement say
ing, "Can the freedom of one group
of people be .sold for the freedom of
another? What then is the idea of free
dom itself?"
"This is another Munich,"
Landsbergis declared, referring to the
1938 pact in which France and Britain
allowed Germany to take control of
Czechoslovakia.

Administration officials had said
earlier that Bush was near a decision
on a package of economic penalties.
But participants in his meeting with
congressional leaders said he voiced
repeated concern over possible Soviet
retaliation against Lithuania should
the United States take action.
The congressional leaders generally
supported him, though there was at
least one suggestion that he postpone
next month's superpower summit.
"1 think the president is proceeding
carefully, and think that is the appro
priate course," said Speaker of the
House Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.1., chair
man of the Senate Foreign Relations

Committee, said there was "a general
feeling of support for the president."
However, Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said he told Bush that a
better response would be to postpone
the May 30-June 3 summit in order
to "send a message all around the
world."
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater declined to rule out such a
possibility, saying that "everything
was subject to consideration" except
for a grain embargo.
He also said Bush indicated in his
meetings with congressional leaders
that he does not plan any interruption
of East-West arms control talks.
