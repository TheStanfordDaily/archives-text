From the bench
WASHINGTON (AP) - Con
demned murderers who waive their
right to appeal and say they want to
die may be executed even if no ap
peals court reviews their cases, the
Supreme Court ruled yesterday.
The Court ruled 6-3 in case that
could affect millions of dollars in
movie industry profits that distrib
utors of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller
"Rear Window" must share with a
literary agent earnings from the 1954
film's re-release.
The Court also ruled 6-2 that the
U.S. territory of Guam and its offi
cials may not be sued for allegedly
violating a much-used federal civil
rights law.
Exxon faces accusations
WASHINGTON (AP) - Exxon has
balked at providing additional money
to assess the long-term damage from

the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska,
federal officials said yesterday.
"The trustees have requested that
Exxon fund the remaining $20 mil
lion |of 1989 costs], but so far Exxon
has declined to respond to that re
quest," Alan Raul told the House
subcommittee on water, power and
offshore energy resources.
Haul, general counsel of the
Agriculture Department, is a member
of the inter-agency trustee council
trying to determine the environmen
tal damages caused by the massive
spill. Trustees said the first year of
studies has cost $35.4 million, more
than twice the amount provided by
Exxon.
Oil drilling expands
WASHINGTON CAP) - The Inte
rior Department said yesterday it will
shift its offshore oil development pol
icies in an effort to open more areas
for development and ease congres
sional opposition that has blocked

lease sales.
"We need to do things differently,"
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said
in an interview after being asked
about the new policy at a House ap
propriations subcommittee hearing.
If the policy is not changed, Lujan
said the offshore leasing program
would continue to be hampered by
congressional roadblocks.
Collider in jeopardy
WASHINGTON (AP) - Deals with
Japan and other foreign partners to
absorb cost overruns of the $8 billion
superconducting super collider could
kill the project, the chairman of the
Senate Energy Committee warned
yesterday.
"The way to get this thing in po
litical trouble is to give away the
cream of the technology," Sen. Ben
nett Johnston, D-La., said of the
high-energy physics particle ac
celerator that President Bush wants
to build near Dallas.

Johnston made the remarks as
House leaders postponed until next
week action on a hill that would cap
federal spending on what would be
the world's largest and most powerful
accelerator at $5 billion and require
foreign partners, Texas or private
money to cover any cost above that
level.
Call for reinstatement
WASHINGTON (AP) - Eleven
lawmakers asked the Pentagon yes
terday to reinstate Craig Fields as
head of the Defense Department's
high-technology research and devel
opment agency.
"Firing and silencing such a key
player in the U.S. competitiveness
debate is at best short-sighted, at
worst a mtyor breach of our future
economic security," the bipartisan
group said in a letter to Deputy De
fense Secretary Donald Atwood.
Fields had been head of the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency.
