## Keeping promises 
### 
Beginning this summer,
between 150 and 200 Uni
versity employees will
receive notice that their jobs are
being eliminated.
And if those people don't find
other jobs in the University, they
face being laid off as soon as Sep
tember.
While there is little doubt that
Stanford needs to tighten its belt,
the process outlined by Provost
James Rosse raises several con
cerns about Stanford's commit
ment to building a multicultural
University.
In a letter to faculty and staff
announcing budget-reduction
plans, Rosse wrote that "when
Stanford finishes with this
repositioning process, we will be
able to return our full attention to
our goals for affirmative action and
pluralism as contained in the
[University Committee on Minor
ity Issues] report."
His statement is disturbing. The
time to pay full attention to goals
of pluralism is now — during the
budget-cutting process — as well
as after.

Many employees fear that the
brunt of cuts will come from the
lower levels of the administrative
staff, which contain a much higher
pecentage of people of color.
Those who hold the budget
cutting cleaver must resist the
temptation to cut primarily from
the bottom. Much of the Univer
sity's fat resides in higher levels
of the administration.
Those making cuts must also
avoid the easy way out of first
firing those last hired. Given the
University is building a multicul
tural community, many people of
color lack seniority in administra
tive positions.
Furthermore, the University has
announced a virtual freeze on
hiring, which is already in effect.
Affirmative action goals cannot be
addressed when hirings are not
being made.
Trimming $22 million from the
University's operating budget
presents a difficult challenge, but
the need to do so does not justify
an abandonment — even a tempo
rary abandonment — of goals for
affirmative action and pluralism.
