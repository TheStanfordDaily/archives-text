# Committee revises plan for DR revision
## 
### Sarah Kling 
While students were at the
ASSU elections voting by a 2-1
margin for a new distribution re
quirements proposal, a University
committee was making significant
revisions to the plan.
Although the student body at
large supported the proposal, the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies heard harsh criticism of
the idea from the few students
and faculty who attended public
meetings on the proposal.

The new proposal, while in
creasing the number of required
classes from 10 to 11, would
merge two existing requirements
to allow for the addition of two
new requirements, American Cul
tures and World Cultures. It
would also expand the number of
ethnic groups to be studied.
The committee will propose the
new plan to the Faculty Senate
on May 17.
In a two-hour meeting April 19,
the committee revised its first DR
proposal, which would have in

eluded an ethnic studies require
ment and an option that would
allow students to fulfill seven DRs
with four courses by completing
two requirements with one class.
Critics, such as English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, called this dou
bling option a "bastardization of
courses," and the latest proposal
suggests scrapping it.
Under the latest plan, the con
troversial ethnic studies require
ment is eliminated in favor of an
American Cultures DR that in
cludes a specific focus on race is

sues. This change came in
response to the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues' study,
which found a significant lack of
cross-cultural understanding
among ethnic groups on campus.
The proposal also contains a
recommendation for a World Cul
tures requirement, which would
turn the current non-Western
course requirement into a full DR.
According to History Prof.
Peter Duus, chair of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies,
strong criticism of the double
counting proposal led to the revi
sions.
"This would distort the pattern
of course choices of the students,"
said Duus.
Critics have also argued that
professors would be forced to in
corporate new material into their
classes in order to gain DR ap

proval.
The revisions also came in re
sponse to a fear of many that a
single ethnic studies requirement
would be too narrow in focus.
Duus explained that because of
the difficulty in defining the num
ber of ethnic groups included, the
effect would be "very divisive"
among students.
In the new system, the Human
Development, Behavior and Lan
guage DR would be combined with
Social Processes and Institutions
in order to make room for the
new DRs.
