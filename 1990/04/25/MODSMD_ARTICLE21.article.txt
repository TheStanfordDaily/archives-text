Elections marred by politically motivated decisions

IT IS BOTH dismaying and amus
ing to find the ASSU once again
faced with "technical difficulties"
involving the ASSU elections and to
hear that those in control are planning
to resolve the problem in a manner
which seems both unprofessional and
politically motivated.
* The "problem" is that if votes for
certain write-in candidates for Council
of Presidents were to be included
(notably those for the "Bart Simpson"
slate), neither of the two leading plat
forms would have a majority of the
votes cast for the COP.
A further "problem," considered less
troublesome, is that the ASSU Bylaws,
which supposedly govern the elections,
specify that a COP slate must gain a

majority of the votes cast. They do not
specify this majority as the majority of
those voting for COP slates.
Over the weekend, 1 talked to ASSU
Elections Commissioner Steve Krauss,
who told me that the decision had
been made not to count any of the
"Bart Simpson" write-in votes despite
the fact that a "Bart Simpson" slate
registered with the ASSU on Friday
before the established deadline.
He explained that this was because
there was no way of knowing whether
those write-ins were meant for that
slate. I asked him why the Bylaws
were not more specific about the
majority requirements, and he replied
that it was because they were terribly
written.

I did not ask Krauss what motivated
the authors of this portion of the
Bylaws to word this crucial passage in
such a vague way, but I would like to
address that question to my fellow
Stanford students. Further, I would
like to ask what would have happened
if the vote totals had been reversed,
and whether these two questions are
entirely unrelated.
The impetus behind the principle of
a government of men and not of laws
is to protect the citizenry from the
whims of those in power. A tradition
of strict interpretation of ASSU Bylaws
might deter future groups from writing
ambiguous bylaws in hopes of inter
preting them to their own advantage,
thus sparing future generations the

kind of partisan administration of the
ASSU which brought us the Oxford
miracle.
The impetus for requiring a majority
vote is to ensure that the elected slate
does not win because the opposition
vote is split. That the vote could be
split by Bart Simpson may be a sad
(and/or hilarious) comment on both of
the slates and the ASSU in general.
However, the possibility remains
(and seems likely to me) that most of
the people who voted might have
preferred the slate which finished
second to the one which finished first.
Both the spirit and the letter of the
law seem to impel a runoff.
