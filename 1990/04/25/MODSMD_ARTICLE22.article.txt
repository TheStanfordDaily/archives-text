# Despite contract, workers will live in poor conditions
## 
### 
Webb Ranch workers have signed an
agreement with the Webbs. But even
when the contract is fully implemented,
the workers will live and work in
poverty, and Stanford will profit from
their labor.
The agreement provides no health
plan, no pension plan and no paid
holidays (not even Labor Day). Hourly
wages for seasonal field workers go
from $4.25 to $5; top pay for tractor
drivers is $6 per hour.
The Webbs will provide money to
help bring existing housing up to mini
mal standards of decency, but money
for new barracks has to be raised by
the workers themselves.
As president of a university with its
own migrant farm, Donald Kennedy
was asked at the last meeting of the

Faculty Senate if he would explore and
report back on ways Stanford might
return half the yearly rent paid by the
Webbs to the workers.
Kennedy noted that the Webbs have
not yet signed the labor contract and
that Stanford has not yet negotiated a
new lease with the Webbs, but he
agreed to consider and report on the
idea.
Stanford has no legal obligation to
return part of its rental profits to the
workers. They are employees of the
Webbs, not the University.
But Stanford is a university and has
a moral obligation to help the men,
women and children of Webb Ranch lift
themselves out of poverty. The money
could be used to help the workers edu
cate their children, to buy health in
surance, upgrade the housing or for
other purposes decided by the workers.
Stanford currently faces budget cut
backs. But half the yearly rent from
the ranch is a small amount to help
restore the University's honor. Even if
the rent goes up under the new lease,
half the amount will probably not be

more than the cost for one student to
attend Stanford for a year. (During the
last year of the expired lease the
Webbs paid Stanford about $46,000.)
Half the yearly rent, though a small
amount to us, when added up over the
term of the lease will have a major
effect on the quality of life of the men,
women and children at Webb Ranch.
Having profited from the labor of
Webb Ranch workers for decades, is
such payment too high a price for
Stanford to pay?
