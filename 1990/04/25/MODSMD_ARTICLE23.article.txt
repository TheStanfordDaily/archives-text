# Columnist offers original, creative look at Stanford
## 
### 
I would like to express my outrage
at Friday's columnist Jon Sherman.
Just who does he think he is? Imag
ine writing column after column on

non-sensitive issues that Stanford and
America haven't discussed to death!
Imagine introducing consistent original
ity and genuine humor to the Opinions
page column!
Any columnist who fails to inspire a
single furious letter from an offended
reader cannot be doing his job.
Traditionally the page-four column
serves as a site for crusading liberals
to fight it out with a token conserva
tive on wearisome pseudo-political is
sues â€” a place where dead horses are
beaten until they groan.
This remains unclear, however, to
Sherman, who has yet to conform and
contribute an assertion on multicul
turalism, abortion or even capital pun
ishment.
This is, of course, inexcusable. We
must not allow boat-rockers who keep
switching photos to transform the
column space into a forum for im
aginative and entertaining, uninflam
matory yet thought-provoking creativi
ty
