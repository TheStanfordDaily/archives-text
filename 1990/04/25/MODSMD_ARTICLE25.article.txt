## Diversifying friendships 
### 
THE OTHER DAY I was asking one
of my black frosh where he was
going to live next year. I was ask
ing, just to be asking, because I had
assumed he was going to live in Ujamaa
again.
Then he laid a serious line on me: "I
think I should branch out and experience
what it's like to live with different people.
Make new friends. That's why I came to
Stanford."
As soon as I picked my tongue up off
the floor, I said, "You mean with white
people?"
"Yes," he said.
Then it hit me. I don't have any really
close white friends at Stanford. (Well,
there's Steve. But Steve's an honorary
brother, so he doesn't count.)
To thiqk, I've gone through yenrs. s
of school ancf haven't developed a close
relationship with a white person. Have
I missed out on something? I know there
ain't no law that says we gotta have a
white friend, but I keep thinking I missed
out on something.
Living in Ujamaa, it's easy to forget
that the world isn't all black. In Ujamaa
we get the wonderful opportunity to eat,
sleep and drink black. The feeling gets
so good to ya\ For me Ujamaa was an
important stop on a personal and cultural
journey.
As a kid, I used to kick it tough with
Mack and James, the two rowdiest
"negroes" at Findley Elementary School.
But that was before Honors English.
Somehow Honors English made me
"different." I was no longer seen as black,
but as something "better." Mack and

James were replaced by Tom and Larry,
and my social circle became more and
more white with each year and each
"honors" class I took. For a time, I
thought that being black and being smart
was an exception and certainly not the
rule.
I was both a victim and a victor as a
result of the honor system. I was
separated from other black kids, and as
the only black in my classes, I felt dis
connected from the black community.
Yet I was exposed to new and exciting
knowledge which allowed me to dream
and fulfill those dreams.
When I came to Stanford, I thought I
was in Heaven. Here I was surrounded
by a group of black students whose ex
perience mirrored mine. Despite the di
versity in interests of black students at
Stanford, most of us come from a middle
class to upper-middle-class socio
economic background. Most of us
attended predominantly white schools.
Most of us have gone through the honor
system. And most of us had white best
friends.
At Ujamaa I was so happy to be around
black folks, where I could talk and act
the way I wanted, and I could assert my
blackness without being made to feel self
conscious. At my new "home," I could
be both black and smart and not feel
disconnected from the black community.
For a time I was leading a double life:
black political activist at Stanford, non
descript, apolitical passivist at home. It
wasn't until recently that I was able to
fuse my Stanford life with my home life.
I did it by requiring my white friends to

acknowledge who I am as a black person,
and then inviting them to celebrate in
my culture.
Although my future social circle will
probably be predominantly black, my
frosh reminded me how important it was
to make new friends. It is the process of
making new friends that convinces me
that Ujamaa should not be all black.
Certainly, Ujamaa is foremost a home
and center for the black community, and
its top priority should be black students.
At the same time, Ujamaa is and should
be a place where non-black students can
experience and feel a part of the black
community.
I like to think of Ujamaa as an African
market. In Africa, the marketplace is a
central institution in the lives of Africans.
It is a place where people come together
to sell and exchange goods, hold religious
and secular ceremonies and gossip with
old friends.
The marketplace is also a place to make
new friends with a variety of people from
different regions.
I view Ujamaa as a marketplace where
black students, and non-black students,
will come together to exchange ideas and
thoughts and, most importantly, have a
damn good time!
