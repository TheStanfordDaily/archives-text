## Pro fros confused about decision-making process 
### 
It was 11 p.m. I was standing in
front of Toyon Hall pondering a stupid
campaign flier. Two young people
walked up to me and asked how to get
to Sesame Street. Actually, it was
Roble (mispronounced) Hall. It oc
curred to me that perhaps they were
not from around here. Their sheepish
grins confirmed my worst fears. They
were prospective freshmen.
For the past four years, hundreds of
"pro fros" have descended upon Stan
ford for one last look at the campus
before making their final decisions. So
being an inquisitive reporter, I have
pursued these neophytes for their
thoughts on Stanford. What I discov
ered was that they had no real knowl
edge of Stanford or strong feelings
about being here.
Though pro fros are looking at an
investment of nearly $90,000 of their
parents' money, few of the ones I
spoke with have strong reasons for
why they are picking Stanford. "I

didn't have very concrete reasons for
choosing which schools I applied to,"
said Homay King of Sunnyvale.
When asked they gave the obvious
responses: "The school has a good rep
utation," said Andrew Malk of La Jol
la.
"My brother goes here, and my
father went here," reasoned Mimi Kuo
of Tucson, Ariz. Karen Witzel of San
Mateo claimed she drew a line across
the nation and only picked schools
south of the line because she did not
want to have to deal with snow. "The
weather's a lot better," corroborates
Doug Cipkala of Columbus, Ohio.
Concerning the recent history of
Stanford, only one student I talked to
had heard of the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Kennedy's
office. None had heard of the free
speech or Western Culture debates.
Michelle Dicks of Los Angeles said she
visited "because I wanted to know if it
was some yuppie, elitist school."

Luckily for Dicks, the trip reassured
her that she wanted to matriculate.
Darcy Thompson of Tucson, Ariz, said
her friends' parents would say they
"knew a kid who had a stress prob
lem" at Stanford.
Concern over earthquakes seemed
non-existent among the pro fros. "I
couldn't care less," said Yon Park of
San Diego. "It's natural." Shelagh
Sandstedt of Bellevue, Neb. said she
slept through last Wednesday's series
of tremors. It's nice to know that that
the class of 1994 is not worried about
being left homeless for 11 days.
What were the pro fros' impressions
of Stanford now that they had visited
the campus? "Palm trees are definitely
a highlight," said Sandstedt.
Most pro fros would only discuss the
positives. "What I really like about
Stanford," said Adam Zurofsky of Fort
Lee, N.J., "is its diversity."
Arriving during the week of ASSU
elections, the pro fros were able to see

Stanford at its best and worst. Melind
John of San Carlos said, "It's good to
know at least people take an interest
and have opinions and do something
about it."
On the other hand, Chris Otto of
Tucson, Ariz., said of campus politics:
"I've heard it's a joke." Dicks saw the
waste of paper and the emphasis on
recycling as contradictory: "There's a
flier every step you take!"
To many prospective freshmen, the
greatest drawback is the vast differ
ences in quality of housing at Stanford.
"The rooms in Lagunita were appall
ing," said Hilario Ramos of Mexico
City. "The ones at Flo Mo were
utilitarian." John said that "being in
Roble had an influence on me liking
Stanford." Andrea Sullivan of San
Mateo noted that the high cost of
Stanford influenced her expectations of
housing: "If I pay $20,000, I want to
live someplace nice."

The frustrating fact about my con
versations with pro fros was their lack
of a clear vision of why they were here
and of what Stanford meant to them.
Then again, I decided to come to Stan
ford because I had never been to
northern California.
Maybe Otto was right when he said,
"The other thing I had heard is that a
lot of people come out of Stanford and
don't know what they're doing or
where they're going."
