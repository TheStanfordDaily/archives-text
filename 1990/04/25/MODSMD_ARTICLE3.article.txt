Both staff and administrators are con
cerned about the effects that University
budget cuts will have on affirmative action
and ethnic diversity in Stanford's work
force.
Although the University has made no
layoffs yet, some staff members fear that
the layoffs predicted by the Repositioning
Steering Committee will eliminate the
gains already made in hiring minority
workers. In addition, the cuts could hinder
achieving the recommendations of the Uni

report.
Worker fears were exacerbated by
Provost James Rosse's latest budget cut
memo, which says, "We will be able to

support group, agreed that affirmative ac
tion issues will remain important.
The University is "strongly committed
to the UCMI goals," he said. Although
there is "no way that you can cut the
budget without cutting staff, this does not
mean that the UCMI goals are not impor
tant," he added.
However, some minority staff have a less
optimistic view of the future of minority
positions at Stanford.
"People are concerned that the budget
cuts may have an adverse impact on mi
norities," said Hector Cuevas, a member
of La Raza, an organization of Chi
cano/Latino staff members.
Cuevas said he is worried that Stanford's
