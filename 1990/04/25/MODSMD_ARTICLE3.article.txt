# Many fear effect budget cuts will have on minority hirings
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Both staff and administrators are con
cerned about the effects that University
budget cuts will have on affirmative action
and ethnic diversity in Stanford's work
force.
Although the University has made no
layoffs yet, some staff members fear that
the layoffs predicted by the Repositioning
Steering Committee will eliminate the
gains already made in hiring minority
workers. In addition, the cuts could hinder
achieving the recommendations of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues' final
report.
Worker fears were exacerbated by
Provost James Rosse's latest budget cut
memo, which says, "We will be able to
return our full attention to our goals for
affirmative action and pluralism" after cuts
are made. Rosse has since clarified his
position, emphasizing that maintaining
ethnic diversity will be a high priority dur
ing the layoff process.
According to Cecilia Burciaga, acting af
firmative action officer, until a few months
ago her office's goal was to increase the
number of minority workers. Now, the
number of minority positions is not going
to grow, she explained.
"We want to maintain what we have,
and we are not going to set any new goals"
for the immediate future, Burciaga said.
However, the University is committed to

'We want to maintain what
we have, and we are not
going to set any new goals'
for the immediate future.

having an ethnically diverse staff, she said.
The staff cuts will be made by looking at
the functions of various staff positions, not
just by seniority.
Frederick Biedenweg, assistant vice pres
ident for information resources and a mem
ber of the budget steering committee's
support group, agreed that affirmative ac
tion issues will remain important.
The University is "strongly committed
to the UCMI goals," he said. Although
there is "no way that you can cut the
budget without cutting staff, this does not
mean that the UCMI goals are not impor
tant," he added.
However, some minority staff have a less
optimistic view of the future of minority
positions at Stanford.
"People are concerned that the budget
cuts may have an adverse impact on mi
norities," said Hector Cuevas, a member
of La Raza, an organization of Chi
cano/Latino staff members.
Cuevas said he is worried that Stanford's
gains in minority staff employ
ment could be lost. While "there
is some expectation that the
UCMI will be kept in mind," we
want to be sure that the Univer
sity lives up to this expectation,
he said.
To help in this process, a group
of minority staff organizations, in
cluding La Raza, formed a coali
tion for cultural diversity.

Members of this coalition say they
intend to discuss their concerns
with Rosse and other administra
tors.
One member of the coalition,
who wished to remain anony
mous, said staff members are
"very nervous" about the layoffs.
He said he fears that the budget
cuts might have a dispropor
tionate effect on minority staff.
It has taken a long time for the
University to build up its number
of minority staff members, but
the layoffs and cuts "will be very
fast," the coalition member said.

"Rebuilding the level of minority
staff will be difficult after signif
icant cuts."
The budget cuts and layoffs are
"going to slow down the process"
of increasing the ethnic diversity
of the work force, if not stop it,
he said.
Burciaga, however, said she sees
the budget cuts as a chance to
decentralize the accountability for
minority hiring. Through budget
repositioning, the individual de
partments of the University
should become responsible for mi
nority hiring in their own staff

rather than relying on her office,
she said.
The Affirmative Action Office
would then act as a consultant
for the other departments, not as
the instigator of change, she
added. The individual vice presi
dents would be responsible for
meeting the UCMI goals.
However, Burciaga noted that
this process will only be produc
tive if "the right cuts are made."
She said she felt that the steering
committee is being very thought
ful about these structural
changes.
