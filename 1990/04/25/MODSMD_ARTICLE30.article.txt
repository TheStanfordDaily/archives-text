## White specks are flies 
### David Ehrhardt Brian White 
. What are those white things float
ing in the air? How can I keep
them from landing in my eyes?
A # The Bug staff decided to attack
• this by finding some clear plastic
containers and going on safari for the
mystery specks. After giving the con
struction crew at the new Biology build
ing site a good laugh, we managed to
capture one. It crawled, so the next step
was easy — talk to an entomologist.
Carol Boggs, acting assistant professor
of biological sciences, informed us that
the small white flies were in fact "White
Flies." They are plant-sucking insects
of the suborder Homoptera, which in
cludes such favorites as the spittlebugs.
(Although the classification of the Sci
ence Bug is in some doubt, it is thought
to belong to the order Hemiptera, which
includes the stink bugs and the bed
bugs.)
Although the flies are generally more
abundant here during the spring, Boggs
said she is not certain what the cause
of the current outbreak is. She suggested
that if this were southern California,
massive Malathion spraying and the sub
sequent destruction of the bug's
predators might explain the outbreak.
Unfortunately, we don't have a great
suggestion for how to keep them out of
your eyes, except to stay indoors and
watch more television. If you must ven
ture out on your bicycle, please floss
afterward.
• Why are you supposed to drive a
new car slowly for the first few
thousand miles?
A. According to our automotive
• source, this break-in period is a
hold-over from the earlier days of car
manufacturing. Back then, you were
supposed to keep the engine revolutions
per minute down for the first 1,000
miles.
This gentle treatment was to prevent
damage to the piston rings, piston and
cylinder walls. The most sensitive com
ponent, the piston rings, are made of a
springy metal and form an O-ring-like
seal between the piston and cylinder
wall. This seal prevents gas and exhaust
from leaking past the pisfon, fouling the
oil and reducing power.
In the old days, "machining techniques
were not as precise as they are today,

so the piston rings and cylinder walls
wouldn't fit exactly. During the break-in
period, both would wear each other,
forming a tight seal.
This wearing is the biggest source of
friction in any new engine, and it
produces a lot of heat. The faster the
engine runs while this wear occurs, the
hotter the rings, piston and cylinder wall
get. At high revolutions per minute —
and therefore high temperature — wear
is accelerated and hot spots can develop
which cause uneven wear or damage to
the engine.
This wear meant that you had to take
it easy on the engine until the wear-in
was complete, usually about 1,000 miles.
Other parts of the engine and drive train
would wear in as well but to a much
lesser extent.
Nowadays, machining is much more
precise, so there is little or no break-in
period required. However, though it is
not strictly necessary, it is still advisable
to treat your new Porsche 911 (if you
are an undergraduate) or your rebuilt
1976 Toyota Corolla (if you are a grad
uate student) gently at all times, espe
cially at first.
