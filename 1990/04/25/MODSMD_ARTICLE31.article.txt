# Apple has bright future ahead

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Visitors to Macworld Exposition in
San Francisco two weeks back may have
been disappointed by the lack of dra
matic new product announcements.
They shouldn't have been.
While nothing as revolutionary as
PageMaker or the Macintosh II was in
troduced, the wares being peddled dem
onstrated that the Mac market is alive
and well. Significantly, numerous
manufacturers restaked their claim to
the technological high ground.
Most notable among those is Apple
Computer itself. When the Macintosh
Ilfx was first introduced, it was greeted
with a universal ho-hum. "So what if
it's faster? Who cares?" Well, how about
everyone running high-powered appli
cations.
At each booth where a Ilfx was set
up, the representative of Company X
was raving about just how much faster
it truly is. The consensus is that, for a
lot of real-world applications, the Ilfx
is an order of magnitude quicker than
the Ilci.
It's an expensive machine but the cost
may well be justifiable. The Ilfx includes
a direct memory access function that
is not exploited by Apple's implementa
tion of SCSI. When the newer SCSI
becomes available, the Ilfx will perform
even faster.
Equally noteworthy is how few chips
the Ilfx uses. Despite providing more
functionality, the computer's logic board
is cleaner than the Mac llx. Apple keeps
finding ways to do more things with
fewer circuits.
The result is twofold. First, manu
facturing costs can be kept low. While
the Mac is not inexpensive, the recent
price cuts in the SE line bode well for
a future free of price increases. Second,
reliability is increased.
Macs have a pretty good track record
on repairs to begin with, and things
should get better with the new archi
tecture. Of course, even if they do not,
the new one-year warranty should cover

any defects nicely. Recent
ly, after tireless protests
from the Mac community,
Apple finally quadrupled
its woefully inadequate
90-day guarantee.
Suddenly, it sounds like
everything's coming up
roses for the kids in
Cupertino. Considering
how bad the news was just
a few months back, that

is nothing short of remarkable.
While the tangible results are not
there, one gets a strong sense that Apple
has recovered from its slight derailment
and is back on track. Sales of the Mac
intosh continue to be strong and big
products are on their way.
The timetable remains ambiguous,
but within the next three quarters Ap
ple will release two products that are
vital to the company's long-term sur
vival.
Topping the short list is System 7.
The specifications of Apple's first com
plete overhaul of the system software
since the hierarchical file system have
been available for months. Everyone
who has seen them is excited about the
possibilities.
But the technical detail is not what's
most relevant. As the Mac has matured
and grown stagnant, the IBM PC
compatible world has caught up some
on ease-of-use and user interface.
Microsoft Windows bears a strong
resemblance to the Mac desktop.
While the execution of the Mac-alikes
is nowhere near as smooth as Apple's,
they are nonetheless a real threat in
the one area where the Macintosh has
clearly proven superior. System 7 needs
to give computer users a reason to love
the Mac again.
Look for it to do just that. Once upon
a time, it was thought that OS/2 and
Presentation Manager would bring the
Mac interface to the DOS world and
kill the Mac. OS/2 is growing old in a
hurry, and its installed base is still tiny.
A recent New York Times article de
scribed OS/2 as "the operating system

some say may eventually
replace DOS." (My
italics.) The universal ac
ceptance of OS/2 is not
guaranteed ever. Period.
Windows can bring most
of its real benefits to the
DOS user without a com
plete system overhaul.
System 7 can make
Windows look like a kin
dergartener's attempt at

interface design. Apple's delivery of the
product, if bug-free and close to the
scheduled September ship date, is cri
tical.
The other item Apple must deliver to
a hungry public as soon as possible is
the low-cost Macintosh. The term is
something of a misnomer, actually, be
cause the street prices of the Plus and
SE are pretty low.
The low-cost Mac is really an inex
pensive machine with color capability
and a 68030 microprocessor capable of
running System 7 and providing enough
speed to do the little things like scroll
smoothly and launch applications quick
ly
While Apple's only official word on
this as-yet-unnanounced computer is
that a low-cost alternative is high on
the priority list, details are leaking out.
The machine will have the requisite
processor, color hookup and two
megabytes of memory.
Sounds like a sweet deal. Sort of a
slot-less Ilex. Unfortunately, the Iljr or
Illite will not be expandable.
It remains to be seen whether this is
the machine the business and education
communities are clamoring for. Apple
certainly hopes so and is pushing de
velopment along at a record pace.
When Macworld rolls around in Jan
uary 1991, Apple will probably have a
slew of brand new laser printers, a color
SE and maybe even a 68040 screamer
to show in its booth. Visitors will be
wowed. As exciting as those products
will be, though, they won't be anywhere
near as significant in determining Ap
ple's success as the next two.
