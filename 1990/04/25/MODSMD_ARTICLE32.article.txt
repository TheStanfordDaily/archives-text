Hospital is one of best
The Stanford Hospital was cited as
one of the nation's 11 best hospitals in
a survey published in the April 30 issue
of U.S. News and World Report.
The ratings were based on a nation
wide survey commissioned by the mag
azine, which asked 400 leading medical
specialists around the nation to choose
the top hospitals in the country in each
individual's specialty.
Stanford was selected by the panel as
particularly excellent in cardiology,
otolaryngology, pediatrics and the treat
ment of cancer. Of the top hospitals,
five, including Stanford, were cited for
four specialties, while the rest were cited
for more.
"Since no medical authority — or
anyone else, for that matter — had ever
devised yardsticks for rating hospitals
that are both useful and statistically
valid, U.S. News had to create its own,"
the article explained.
"Even the best hospitals do not per
form uniformly well from one depart
ment to another, so it seemed unwise
to try to rate them across the board,"
the article explained. The survey was
conducted with the assistance of the
Georgetown University Department of
Community and Family Medicine in
Washington, which selected the
physician leaders among who the survey
was conducted.

Among special features cited for Stan
ford in a thumbnail sketch was "low-cost
lodging for patients and their families,"
a result of the HOME project established
in recent years near the hospital.
The report noted that at the top hospi
tals cited, including Stanford, "typically
10 to 20 percent of patients come from
outside the region or state," and that
figure is higher for some specialties such
as neurosurgery or transplant surgery.
U.S. News said it undertook the sur
vey because, "while consumers can find
reams of data when they need to buy
a new car or toaster oven, judge a
mutual fund or choose a vacation spot,
precious little information has been
available on comparative quality or per
formance of the institutions that min
ister to the sick."
The article stresses that local com
munity hospitals often offer excellent
and convenient care. But "among the
many circumstances that should send
you to a major hospital is the need for
major surgery for a heart ailment, ex
tensive tests for a metabolic disorder or
complicated chemotherapy or radiation
treatment for cancer."
Making 'plastic' metals
Oleg Sherby is busy these days think
ing of new ways to make steel behave
more like molasses.
Sherby, professor emeritus in the De
partment of Materials Science and En

gineering, is an expert on superplastic
metals that can stretch up to 80 times
their normal size.
"You don't think of a metal as being
super-stretchable," Sherby said. "Chew
ing gum, yes, but for a metal to stretch
like that is unusual."
Sherby and Associate Prof, of Mate
rials Science and Engineering Jeffrey
Wadsworth recently gave a paper sum
marizing developments in superplastic
research at the Materials Research So
ciety.
The plasticity of the steels can elim
inate expensive machining and welding
steps in conventional steel fabrication.
"Instead of doing all that," Sherby
said, "we can form a complicated part
like a gear all at once by heating and
squeezing it (the steel) into a mold like
a tube of toothpaste."
The key to superplastic steels is an
ultrafine grain size. Such steels are
made of iron crystals interspersed with
carbon-iron molecules, called carbides.
The more carbides squeezed between
the iron crystals, the finer the grain.
Like grains of sand rolling over each
other, the finer the grains, the more
easily they'll slide.
The same idea can be applied to
ceramics, creating parts with phenome
nal wear resistance that are able to
withstand temperatures up to 1,000
degrees.
The current research in superplastic

ceramics is reviving the 25-year-old no
tion of a ceramic automobile engine.
The engine could run hotter and more
efficiently than today's engines. Tradi
tional ceramics cracked under the
strain, but superplastic ceramics may
survive.
Sherby's metals actually appear
similar to Damascus steel — invented
in 350 B.C. — which gave swords a
beautiful and sharp finish through
many battles. Sherby has attempted to
reproduce the Damascus process and
has been fairly successful. "We're
tempted not to tell the world how we
did it," Sherby said. "It's like Coca-Cola:
Don't patent it, just have it as a man
ufacturing secret."
Hearts for cancer patients
Several former cancer patients have
received heart transplants at the Med
ical Center and early results indicate
their survival rates are comparable to
those of transplant recipients who have
never had cancer.
During the past four years, 11 trans
plants have been performed in 10
patients. Six of the patients are still
living.
Until the last few years, anyone who
had had cancer was considered a high
risk and unacceptable as a candidate for
heart transplantation, said Dr. Sharon
Hunt, a member of the Stanford

transplant team. However, she ex
plained, the Stanford team was encour
aged by good results reported in cancer
patients who had kidney transplants.
"Every now and then we'd see a young
person the oncologists would tell us was
cured, with virtually zero chance of
having a recurrence of the malignancy,"
she said. "And often these people would
be dying of heart disease due to the
therapy for their cancer in the first
place.
"So in 1985 we decided we should
take a chance, based on the encouraging
experience of our colleagues in the renal
field," she said.
Hunt and other members of the Stan
ford transplant team were co-authors
of an article in The American Journal
of Cardiology that described the results
of transplants in the first seven patients.
One of the seven died of a recurrence
of his cancer, another died of respiratory
failure and a third died from infectious
complications.
The one-year post-transplant survival
rate of the discharged patients was com
parable to the survival rate for all heart
transplant patients at Stanford during
the same period.
Hunt called the results very encour
aging and said other former cancer
patients would be considered for heart
transplants.
