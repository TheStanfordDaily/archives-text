## It's 14 in a row for Card nine

SAN FRANCISCO - Benedetti
Diamond, the home of the Uni
versity of San Francisco Dons, is
a great place to watch a baseball
game. Especially if you don't hap
pen to be rooting for the home
team.
Taking advantage of a none-too
spacious outfield and just a
smidgen of shaky relief pitching
on the part of the Dons, the Stan
ford baseball team ran its win
streak to 14 games yesterday on
a field that, to be honest, could
use a little more elbow room.

Cardinal 13

Dons 0

The Cardinal, which crunched
out 12 of its 18 hits in the last
three innings, is now 40-7 and
has reached the 40-win plateau
faster than any team in school
history. The Dons, who kept the
game close until they went to the
bullpen, are a dismal (as opposed
to a cheery) 13-33.
The playing field itself wasn't
too tiny — 320 feet to left, 420
to center and 315 to right — but
the foul territory surrounding it
was, to put it mildly, minute. How
minute? Well, consider this:
The backstop was maybe eight
feet behind home plate;
The visitors' dugout, which was
covered by chicken wire to keep

players from getting killed by foul
balls, was 20 feet (at best) off the
first-base line;
The houses that hugged the
field had a two-story fence of their
own to make sure any other foul
balls wouldn't shatter a window
or six;
The visitors' on-deck circle was
a bunch of dirt behind the back
stop;
And the stands, which seat
maybe 150 people when they're
jam-packed, were an entire six
inches away from the side of the
backstop/batting cage, giving
over-eager fans a swell chance to,
among other things, debate each
and every strike call, hear every
comment made by the players and
generally just have a great view
of the action.
The fans at yesterday's game
(the official scorekeeper, who was
hallucinating at the time, gave the
total as 132) got a great view of
Cardinal pitcher John Reid, who
dazzled the Dons for eight in
nings, giving up only five hits. It
was the strongest outing of the
year for Reid, who hadn't pitched
since he was hit on his throwing
hand by a line drive against Cal
ifornia April 14.
"I threw Saturday and it hurt
a little, but today it seemed bet
ter," Reid said. "The swelling had
moved down from my hand, and
it made it hard to snap my wrist.
I just couldn't cut loose. It was
fine today, though."
"Besides," Reid said, "the in
field here is nice and slow. If you

keep giving up ground balls, with
the defense that we've got, you've
got a good shot at success."
"J.R. changed speeds really well
today," catcher Mark Skeels said.
"His curve ball was sharp, he had
good command of all three
pitches, and he just took it to
ft
em.
So did Skeels, who led the Car
dinal hitting barrage with his first
two career home runs. In the fifth,
with Stanford up 2-0, Skeels led
off the inning against lefty Derek
Dowd. First-pitch fastball.
Smack! The ball soared over
the left field fence, over the 35-
foot-high fence that supposedly
was meant to keep homers from
maiming pedestrians on the
nearby street, landed between two
parked cars and almost left a pain
ful imprint on a young fan who
was trying to make a running
catch. Three-zip.
In the ninth, with the score
12-nada thanks to the stellar
relief work of Mike (one inning
two doubles-two singles-two
dongs) Urban, Skeels followed up
Roger Burnett's two-run homer
off the 35-foot fence with another
solo shot.
You been holding back on us,
Skeels? "Hey," he said, "even a
blind squirrel finds an acorn
every now and then." Or two.

pinch hit appearance in the ninth and

picked up his first career hit, a pop
fly to left that turned into a double
when the left fielder couldn't get to
the ball in time. Detter then scored
on a double by Ryan Turner.
Urban, who goes 6-7, 245 pounds,
did manage to strike out Paul Carey
in the ninth, thanks to a strike zone
the size of Idaho. Carey had a single,
double and triple up to that point.
