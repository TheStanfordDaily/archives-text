# Why doesn't NCAA let collegiate juniors return after draft?
## 
### 
Thirty-eight juniors declared them
selves eligible for this week's NFL
draft. Sixteen of them were selec
ted. The other 22 have no job, no degree
no scholarship and, sadly, not much of a
future.
The decision to allow underclassmen
into the draft was long overdue. Profes
sional football could not justify its illegal
policy of denying these athletes an op
portunity to earn a living. Recognizing
their rules would not stand up in court,
the league granted exceptions to all the
juniors that have applied in recent years.
Opening the draft merely marked an
to thg hypocrisy It also opened the
college football establishment to yet an
other round of criticism. This June, Stan
Spencer and Mike Mussina will be high
round selections in baseball's draft.
Let's say, for argument's sake, that
Spencer is selected by the Indians. Stan
hates Cleveland. I mean, it's in the middle
of Ohio. He figures that he'll go back to
school for his senior year and try the
draft in '91.
Maybe then he'll be lucky enough to
get picked by the Cubs.
In all seriousness, Paul Carey actually
did something similar. He was selected
in the fourth round of last year's draft
by Detroit. The contract negotiations did

not go according to Carey's liking and
now he's back at Stanford smashing
school records left and right.
Those 22 junior footballers are not as
lucky. The rules for football state that
once you declare yourself eligible for the
draft, make eye contact with an agent or
so much as daydream about turning pro,
you cannot play in college anymore.
Dick Schultz, executive director of the
NCAA, would like to see a system under
which student-athletes, or in this case
athlete-students, can test the waters in
professional football and, if they find
them a bit chilly, can return to school.
No questions asked.
General managers in the NFL are not
exactly thrilled with the prospects of
having their draftees head back to State
U. Such is life. The only real problem
with the Schultz proposal is that it seems
so darned logical.
By giving prospective pros a chance to
discern their marketability, football
would merely be exiting the dark ages
and joining a host of other sports in the
modern era.
It isn't just baseball, you see, that al
lows for a trial run. Tennis and golf ath
letes have had the option all along. Let's
say for example that Debbie Graham
thinks she is ready to play pro tennis.

This summer, she joins the tour as an
amateur, beats Gabriela Sabatini and
decides school can wait.
She phones Coach Frank Brennan,
wishes him well and says so long. Or
Graham joins the tour, gets double
bageled by Angelica Gavaldon (remember,
this is just an example) and figures going
back to school makes a whole lot of sense.
Best of all, while she cannot keep any
prize money she earns (Meredith
McGrath passed up a healthy payday at
the Virginia Slims of Indian Wells),
Graham is allowed to use any theoretical
winnings £o pay for expenses.
Clearly, there is not an analogue in
football. You cannot play in the French
Football Open, tackle Andre Agassi and/or
Eric Dickerson, and decide you're ready
to play with the big boys. If the Schultz
plan is adopted, however, you could at
tend the scouting combines, find out Mel
Kiper has you rated as no better than
an eighth-round pick and head back to
school.
As far as the pro football franchises
are concerned, perhaps they can col
lusively figure out a plan to compensate
teams whose draftees return to school.
It's their fault for creating the mess in
the first place. Were it not for an inane
proposal to pay rookies according to a

wage scale, few of the juniors would have
made the jump in the first place.
Notes from the field:
Alan Grant, Rob Hinckley and
Lester Archambeau are all headed
for the NFL. As fourth-round selections,
Grant and Hinckley are almost guaran
teed to make their respective teams.
Former Coach Jack Elway recruited
that trio, along with many other talented
players and could not win. This is
noteworthy only because current Coach
Denny Green is being regarded as a savior
based on his recruiting.
No one is suggesting they won't be
winners (it says here the team finishes
over .500 in 1990), but it just goes to
show there is not a one-to-one correlation
between top-20 recruiting classes and top
-20 rankings . . .

My brother was drafting players for
his 17-member farm team as part of
rotisserie league baseball. He decided to
pick Stanford players (he's a student at
the State University of New York-Albany)
in the last three rounds. His 15th-round
choice was Mike Mussina — he remem
bered me telling him about Mussina when
he was recruited.
A round later he selected Carey — the
grand slam seemed to be far enough back
to make Carey a senior. Besides, he had
a gut feeling I told him Carey had major
league potential.
Last selection comes up and he has no
clue. He scans the Cardinal roster and
comes up with another pitcher whose
name sounds familiar. When we were on
the phone a few days ago, he was practi
cally screaming when he learned Carey
was drafted in the fourth round last year.
When he was read Spencer's stats, (11-
0, 1.94 ERA, 102 innings pitched, 98
strikeouts, 18 walks) he was screaming.
The only problem is that Spencer has to
be selected by an American League team
for him to ever play for my brother . . .
The Pacific 10 Conference tennis tour
nament begins tomorrow in Ojai, Calif.
Look for Stanford women to capture at
least three of the four semifinal berths.
