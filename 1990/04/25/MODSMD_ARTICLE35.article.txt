# Ruggers prove they've returned

Stanford rugby is back.
Once considered a recreational past-time as
little as two seasons ago, Cardinal rugby has
become a prominent threat on the national
level.
For the second year in a row, the ruggers
advanced to their regional competition for the
Pacific Coast Rugby Football Union , which
featured four of the top ten teams in the
nation — including Stanford.
Last year the Cardinal finished its season
ranked eighth in the nation. That ranking
came after it took fifth in the PCRFU
regionals, the winner of which is one of four
teams to advance to nationals.
This past weekend the Cardinal traveled to
Tri-Cities, Wash, and returned home with a
2-1 record, placing third in the PCRFU behind
California — eight-time national champion —
and Long Beach State — winner of both this
and last seasons' regionals.
Coach Franck Boivert stated that he is "very
happy with the team's achievement this year,"
adding, "It's a great way to finish off our
season." He also noted that Stanford's ability
to compete with Cal and Long Beach is, in its
own way, "remarkable since those teams
recruit foreigners to play key positions,
whereas here, at Stanford, we utilize only those
athletes who are accepted (to Stan ford 1 on
their own. Both Cal and Long Beach each
have two Australians, who play an integral
role and were specially recruited."
The regionals began Friday, when the Car
dinal faced Cal Poly San Luis Obispo — to
whom they lost in last year's regionals. The
tables were turned this year, however, and
Stanford emerged a 13-10 victor. Key plays
included Rob Englehardt's scoring of a try and
Simon Fleming-Wood's conversion of two dif
ficult drop goals.
Saturday, Stanford drew Long Beach State,
the regional representative in the 1989 na
tional tournament. A win against the 49ers
would have put the Cardinal one game away
from advancing to nationals. In
stead, Stanford was downed 23-12
by Long Beach, although the Car
dinal did put up a strong fight.
According to Boivert, the loss
of senior Matt Maniscalco to an
injury played a critical role in the
defeat since the position he played
is not only highly demanding, but
takes months to master. As a
result, the Cardinal was forced to
play two rookies at Maniscalco's

spot — freshman Matt Tripp and
sophomore Owen Williams. Al
though their inexperience showed,
Boivert characterized their per
formance as "courageous."
In their final match on Sunday,
the ruggers beat Chico State 13-8
to secure third place in the
NCRFU. The victory boded well
for the future of the team since
Boivert elected to play mostly
younger players. "These are the
members of the team who repre
sent the future of Stanford
rugby," Boivert said. "I'm very
satisfied with their level of play.
