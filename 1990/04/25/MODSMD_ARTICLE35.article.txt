# Ruggers prove they've returned

Stanford rugby is back.
Once considered a recreational past-time as
little as two seasons ago, Cardinal rugby has
become a prominent threat on the national
level.
For the second year in a row, the ruggers
advanced to their regional competition for the
Pacific Coast Rugby Football Union , which
featured four of the top ten teams in the
nation — including Stanford.
Last year the Cardinal finished its season
ranked eighth in the nation. That ranking
came after it took fifth in the PCRFU
regionals, the winner of which is one of four
teams to advance to nationals.
This past weekend the Cardinal traveled to
Tri-Cities, Wash, and returned home with a
2-1 record, placing third in the PCRFU behind
California — eight-time national champion —
and Long Beach State — winner of both this
and last seasons' regionals.
Coach Franck Boivert stated that he is "very
happy with the team's achievement this year,"
adding, "It's a great way to finish off our
season." He also noted that Stanford's ability
to compete with Cal and Long Beach is, in its
own way, "remarkable since those teams
recruit foreigners to play key positions,
whereas here, at Stanford, we utilize only those
athletes who are accepted (to Stan ford 1 on
their own. Both Cal and Long Beach each
have two Australians, who play an integral
role and were specially recruited."
The regionals began Friday, when the Car
dinal faced Cal Poly San Luis Obispo — to
whom they lost in last year's regionals. The
tables were turned this year, however, and
Stanford emerged a 13-10 victor. Key plays
included Rob Englehardt's scoring of a try and
Simon Fleming-Wood's conversion of two dif
ficult drop goals.
Saturday, Stanford drew Long Beach State,
the regional representative in the 1989 na
tional tournament. A win against the 49ers
would have put the Cardinal one game away
