## Rebounding men's volleyball squad poised to challenge for Final 4 berth 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, Coach Fred
Sturm prophecied that the must
win situation in which the Stan
ford volleyball team found itself
could ultimately work in the
squad's favor. As the Cardinal
prepares for its first-round clash
with UC-Santa Barbara tonight,
Stanford's postseason prospects
could not look any sweeter.
After streaking through three
end-of-season must-win matches,
the Cardinal is without question
the most playoff-ready team in
the Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association tournament
that begins tonight at Cal-State
Northridge.
Stanford crashed Pepperdine's
playofT hopes on the road, sal
vaged an emotional victory
against No. 1 USC and drubbed
No. 6 San Diego State during its
dramatic closing run. The Cardi
nal attackers recorded astonish
ing team hitting percentages of
.436 and .425 in the last two
matches of the year.
"From the Pepperdine match
on, we had already entered the
playoffs," senior All-American
middle blocker Dan Hanan said.
"We have already been playing
with pressure and we're used to
it. M
The Cardinal derived another,
rather unanticipated benefit from
its late-sea9on heroics. By
nudging past the highly-touted
Trojans last week, Stanford actu
ally finished the season in a tie
with USC for second-place in
WIVA, but won the tiebreaker on
the basis of a better record against
conference opponents.
The favorable final standings
enable Stanford to meet No. 10
UCSB — which enters the cham
pioship with the worst record and

lowest ranking of any of the six
contenders — in the first match
tonight at 5:30. USC, however,
must contend with much
improved Cal State-Northridge
before the Matadors' home crowd.
Further motivation will come
in the way of Stanford's next op
ponent. No. 2 UCLA, the sole
team the Cardinal has played and
not beaten this season, awaits the
winner of the Stanford-UCSB
match.
"We're definitely worried that
we haven't beaten them," Hanan
said. "But that makes it even bet
ter. We'll be on fire. Putting them
out of the Final Four would be
even sweeter."
Mounting anticipation of this
rematch of last year's NCAA
championship overshadows the
task immediately at hand for
Stanford. Although the Cardinal
has twice trounced the Gauchos
this year, Santa Barbara has
resurged of late. In their own
Clash of the Titans Tournament
held last Friday and Saturday,
UCSB shocked No. 3 Long Beach
State in the first round of the
tourney, before relenting to USC
in five drawn-out games.
Due to the set-up of the regional
championships, the two finalists
in WIVA will almost certainly
both attend the Final Four at
George Mason University next
week. The victors of the three
national regionals will each
receive automatic bids. In this
fashion, the champion of WIVA
will join the winners of the other
two regions, Rutgers-Newark and
Ball State, in Virginia. The at
large bid will be awarded almost
unquestionably to the WIVA
runner-up, as the conference
boasts all of the nations top 10
teams.

Stanford all-time kill leader Dan Hanan and the rebounding Cardinal hope to kill the
Gouchos in the first round of the WIVA playoffs tonight.
Seniors Parker Blackman,
Craig Forsyth, and Hanan will
each be playing in potentially their
last matches of their Cardinal
careers. Each started for four
years at the Farm and played an
instrumental role in transferring
Stanford from a moderate team
to one of national championship
caliber.
Blackman had what Sturm con
sidered "the best year a setter has
ever had at Stanford" last season
and has returned from a second
degree ankle sprain to spearhead
the Cardinal charge this season.
Forsyth led the nation for most

of the year in hitting percentage
and remains perhaps the most
solid blocker on the squad. Ail-
World athlete Hanan will build on
his newly acquired Stanford
career kills record, which he
seized from Olympic Captain
Scott Fortune last week.
The three are in complete con
cord with respect to their goal.
After having reached the national
championship match last year,
their unyielding purpose is to take
home the crown this season.
The health of the Cardinal may
aid the squad in its cause. Forsyth
has nearly recovered from a slight
ankle sprain and will likely play
against Santa Barbara. Blackman
is fully healed, and the remainder
of the squad is trouble-free.

sidered "the best year a setter has
ever had at Stanford" last season
and has returned from a second
degree ankle sprain to spearhead
the Cardinal charge this season.
Forsyth led the nation for most

of the year in hitting percentage
and remains perhaps the most
solid blocker on the squad. Ail-
World athlete Hanan will build on
his newly acquired Stanford
career kills record, which he
seized from Olympic Captain
Scott Fortune last week.
The three are in complete con
cord with respect to their goal.
After having reached the national
championship match last year,
their unyielding purpose is to take
home the crown this season.
The health of the Cardinal may
aid the squad in its cause. Forsyth
has nearly recovered from a slight
ankle sprain and will likely play
against Santa Barbara. Blackman
is fully healed, and the remainder
of the squad is trouble-free.
