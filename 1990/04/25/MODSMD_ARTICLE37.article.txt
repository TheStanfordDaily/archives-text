# Willens exceeds expectations
## Freshman 'reserve' overjoyed at cracking netters' starting lineup 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
When Heather Willens decided to at
tend Stanford last spring, she was re
alistic about her chances of cracking
the lineup as a freshman. "I think their
talent is the best assembled ever," she
said last May. "If I play real well, I'll
have a chance to get in there."
And if not? "I won't be crushed,"
Willens added.
Willens was emotionally prepared to
be a reserve and wait her turn. That
was fine with women's tennis Coach
Frank Brennan, who was not counting
on her to make a big splash this season.
"I knew she was capable of contributing
at some point. I didn't expect her to be
a full-time player in singles and dou
bles," Brennan says.
Given the attitude of both player and
coach, it's safe to say Heather Willens
has exceeded expectations. The fresh
man is currently 22-2 and is a fixture
at the No. 6 singles spot. She also teams
with captain Lisa Green at No. 3 dou
bles.
In part, it was a lack of high expec
tations that has made her successful.
"Before I actually came in here, I was
saying I won't be disappointed if I play
No. 7 or 8," she says. When practice
got into full swing, though, she realized
she had a chance to crack the lineup,
and the possibility was attractive to her.
"I started to realize it wouldn't be
too unrealistic to try to play in the top
six," Willens explains, adding she was
enthusiastic but cautious. "I realized
that, in fact, I wouldn't be happy if I
didn't play in the top six. At the same
time, I wouldn't think that I had failed
if I didn't make it. That took the pres
sure off."
When the challenge matches to deter
mine the lineup were finished, Brennan
let Willens know the No. 6 spot was
hers. "I was overjoyed," she says. "It's
always a great feeling to set a goal and

get it. Especially this — playing on a
national championship team as a fresh
man."
As soon as the season began, it be
came apparent that something was
wrong with Willens. She struggled in
her first few matches and, while she
only lost twice, it was apparent she was
not playing up to her ability.
While the casual observer might have
looked for some flaw in her mechanics
as the cause of her troubles, Willens
knew the problem came from within.
Last season another freshman, Kylie
Johnson, held her spot in the lineup.
All Johnson did was post a 25-2 mark
and play flawless tennis at NCAAs.
That left Willens with big shoes to
fill. Now, the expectations were for her
to win and win easily. The pressure was
on and it began to take a toll on Willens.
"At times, I thought, 'Well, do I actually
have a right to be here? Would she be
doing better?' " Willens recalls. "I had
my two losses and I was thinking,
'Would Kylie have lost?' "
Inadvertently, Brennan helped fuel
Willens' insecurity. He told her that se
lecting a No. 6 player was one of the
hardest decisions he had made as a
coach. "Comments that like were in the
back of my head," she says.
"I kept looking over my shoulder
thinking, 'I've got to play my best on
every single point and win 6-0, 6-0 or
else he's going to take me out because
Kylie won every match last year.' "
All the worrying was new for Willens,
and it wasn't doing her any good. "The
reason I've had success (in the past) is
because I've been so relaxed when I was
playing," she says."I started stressing
out, which obviously hurt me a lot as
it would hurt anyone."
She credits Brennan with helping her
turn it around. Willens says he was
perceptive enough to realize what she
was putting herself through. She re
members Brennan telling her: "You
have the spot as long as you perform."

So she began performing. When the
team headed to Southern California in
early April it was just what Willens
needed. A Los Angeles native, the trip
gave her an opportunity to play before
friends and family. She made the most
of it.
In the team's two biggest matches of
the season to that point, Willens posted
two impressive victories. First she
fended off UCLA veteran Stella
Sampras to give Stanford its first point
in the tightest match the team has
played in 1990. The next day she shut
out USC's Linda Allred 6-0, 6-0.
Since then she has steamrolled every
one in her path. When the Bruins and
Trojans visited this past weekend, each
sent a different opponent at Willens.
But the results were the same as Willens
knocked off UCLA's Debbie LaFranchi
6-0, 6-1 and USC's Julie Tullberg 6-1,
6-2.
Her recent success is more in line
with what she has experienced since
she began playing tennis at age seven.
Her mother, Jane Willens, was a na
tional college champion in 1964 and ob
viously some of her talent rubbed off
on Heather.
But the younger Willens says it has
helped her in a more subtle way as well.
"[My parents] understand what it's like
to be an athlete," she says."I don't
have that problem of parents trying to
live through their kids."
The athletic tradition in her family
goes back a generation further as well.
Willens' grandfather, Frankie Albert, is
one of the legendary figures in Stanford
football history. When one alum intro
duces her to another they often make
the connection between Albert and Wil
lens.
At first, she says, it made her "proud"
but it quickly grew tiresome, and she
found herself saying, "No, I'm Heather
Willens, not Frankie Albert's
granddaughter. Now I just tune it out
with a smile."

Frank Brennan, who was not counting
on her to make a big splash this season.
"I knew she was capable of contributing
at some point. I didn't expect her to be
a full-time player in singles and dou
bles," Brennan says.
Given the attitude of both player and
coach, it's safe to say Heather Willens
has exceeded expectations. The fresh
man is currently 22-2 and is a fixture
at the No. 6 singles spot. She also teams
with captain Lisa Green at No. 3 dou
bles.
In part, it was a lack of high expec
tations that has made her successful.
"Before I actually came in here, I was
saying I won't be disappointed if I play
No. 7 or 8," she says. When practice
got into full swing, though, she realized
she had a chance to crack the lineup,
and the possibility was attractive to her.
"I started to realize it wouldn't be
too unrealistic to try to play in the top
six," Willens explains, adding she was
enthusiastic but cautious. "I realized
that, in fact, I wouldn't be happy if I
didn't play in the top six. At the same
time, I wouldn't think that I had failed
if I didn't make it. That took the pres
sure off."
When the challenge matches to deter
mine the lineup were finished, Brennan
let Willens know the No. 6 spot was
hers. "I was overjoyed," she says. "It's
always a great feeling to set a goal and

get it. Especially this — playing on a
national championship team as a fresh
man."
As soon as the season began, it be
came apparent that something was
wrong with Willens. She struggled in
her first few matches and, while she
only lost twice, it was apparent she was
not playing up to her ability.
While the casual observer might have
looked for some flaw in her mechanics
as the cause of her troubles, Willens
knew the problem came from within.
Last season another freshman, Kylie
Johnson, held her spot in the lineup.
All Johnson did was post a 25-2 mark
and play flawless tennis at NCAAs.
That left Willens with big shoes to
fill. Now, the expectations were for her
to win and win easily. The pressure was
on and it began to take a toll on Willens.
"At times, I thought, 'Well, do I actually
have a right to be here? Would she be
doing better?' " Willens recalls. "I had
my two losses and I was thinking,
'Would Kylie have lost?' "
Inadvertently, Brennan helped fuel
Willens' insecurity. He told her that se
lecting a No. 6 player was one of the
hardest decisions he had made as a
coach. "Comments that like were in the
back of my head," she says.
"I kept looking over my shoulder
thinking, 'I've got to play my best on
every single point and win 6-0, 6-0 or
else he's going to take me out because
Kylie won every match last year.' "
All the worrying was new for Willens,
and it wasn't doing her any good. "The
reason I've had success (in the past) is
because I've been so relaxed when I was
playing," she says."I started stressing
out, which obviously hurt me a lot as
it would hurt anyone."
She credits Brennan with helping her
turn it around. Willens says he was
perceptive enough to realize what she
was putting herself through. She re
members Brennan telling her: "You
have the spot as long as you perform."

So she began performing. When the
team headed to Southern California in
early April it was just what Willens
needed. A Los Angeles native, the trip
gave her an opportunity to play before
friends and family. She made the most
of it.
In the team's two biggest matches of
the season to that point, Willens posted
two impressive victories. First she
fended off UCLA veteran Stella
Sampras to give Stanford its first point
in the tightest match the team has
played in 1990. The next day she shut
out USC's Linda Allred 6-0, 6-0.
Since then she has steamrolled every
one in her path. When the Bruins and
Trojans visited this past weekend, each
sent a different opponent at Willens.
But the results were the same as Willens
knocked off UCLA's Debbie LaFranchi
6-0, 6-1 and USC's Julie Tullberg 6-1,
6-2.
Her recent success is more in line
with what she has experienced since
she began playing tennis at age seven.
Her mother, Jane Willens, was a na
tional college champion in 1964 and ob
viously some of her talent rubbed off
on Heather.
But the younger Willens says it has
helped her in a more subtle way as well.
"[My parents] understand what it's like
to be an athlete," she says."I don't
have that problem of parents trying to
live through their kids."
The athletic tradition in her family
goes back a generation further as well.
Willens' grandfather, Frankie Albert, is
one of the legendary figures in Stanford
football history. When one alum intro
duces her to another they often make
the connection between Albert and Wil
lens.
At first, she says, it made her "proud"
but it quickly grew tiresome, and she
found herself saying, "No, I'm Heather
Willens, not Frankie Albert's
granddaughter. Now I just tune it out
with a smile."

Freshman Heather Widens has fit into the four-time defending national champion
Cardinal lineup just fine, thank you, compiling a 22-2 record in the No. 6 singles spot.
When Heather Willens decided to at
tend Stanford last spring, she was re
alistic about her chances of cracking
the lineup as a freshman. "I think their
talent is the best assembled ever," she
said last May. "If I play real well, I'll
have a chance to get in there."
And if not? "I won't be crushed,"
Willens added.
Willens was emotionally prepared to
be a reserve and wait her turn. That
was fine with women's tennis Coach
Frank Brennan, who was not counting
on her to make a big splash this season.
