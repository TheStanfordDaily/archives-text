## 
### 
As the Western Collegiate Cy
cling season drew within two
weeks of conference champion
ships, the Stanford Cycling Team
asserted itself as a top contender
with overall wins in two of the
three races at Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo last weekend.
Following a third place overall
finish in Saturday's criterium se
ries, the Cardinal rebounded to
win both the team time trial event
and the road race, putting Stan
ford is in the top five in the 25
team strong conference, behind
defending champion California.
Stanford won the team time
trial thanks to first place finishes
in two of the three categories, as
well as top-four placings in each
division.
The Women's A squad of Amy
Dawson, Erica Deese-Dobson,
Michele Sullivan, and Laura Wil
son hammered to win their
category by a huge one-minute
margin. The foursome of Deirdre
Conley, Martina Lauchengco, Liz
Moyer, and Shannon Snyder fol
lowed to take fourth.
"The women really seem to be
coming around after a tough mid
season," Captain Scott Evans
said.
In the Men's A's, Jeremy Her
mann, Lou O'Neill, Frank Scios
cia, and Jason Tavakolian raced
to fourth place, behind defending
national collegiate team time trial
champions Cal Poly SLO. Stan
ford's overall victory was clinched
in the men's B's with a first place
finish from gearmashers Don

Bergstedt, Evans, Rex Jameson,
and Dan VanDermeer.
Immediately following the team
time trial, Stanford's racers
switched gears and headed for the
road race. The 32-mile course —
which the Men's A's would com
plete twice, tbe Men's B's one and
one-half times, and the remaining
divisions once — included 600 feet
of climbing.
The first division to finish saw
Stanford rider Compton out front
in a solo breakaway to take the
victory, followed by teammates
Henchman and Bacher, who
nabbed third and fourth in the
field sprint. Compton had broken
five miles before the finish on the
last climb, holding off the pack
thanks to strong blocking from
Bacher and Henchman.
"Two other riders and myself
broke hard at the top of the hill,
but they couldn't stay on my
wheel on the flat — so I came in
alone," Compton said.
Sullivan mashed to yet another
exciting field sprint win, outdoing
seven others in her breakaway by
less than a bike-length to win the
women's event.
The Men's B race, in similar
fashion, came down to a pack
sprint. Sprint God Evans crossed
the line fourth.
A 13-man break managed to
stay ahead of the pack during the
last three miles of the men's A
race, allowing law student Scioscia
and Physics PhD candidate Brian
Sterling to sprint to fourth and
ninth place finishes.
