# Many departments face displacement
## Quake bracing to force yearlong moves 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Starting in 1991, the University
will displace many academic de
partments and other groups for
one-year periods, spending an es
timated $30 million to brace or
rebuild 44 unreinforced masonry
buildings.
To comply with a 1986 state
law, a majority of the Inner and
Outer Quad buildings will be
reconstructed, as well as the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, the 500 series of engineer
ing buildings behind the Quad,
the Press Building, the Band
Shak, Encina Gym and Athletics
Department offices.
The University has until Jan.
1, 1991 to present an acceptable
plan to Santa Clara County.
Although the Oct. 17 earth
quake has increased the sense of
urgency to complete the project,
the plans for seismic bracing and
temporary displacement of de
partments were developing before
the quake. In a report released in
1986, the University called for
reinforcement of many buildings
in a 10- to 15-year period.
"We've known since 1906 that
unreinforced masonry buildings
don't do well in earthquakes," As
soc. Provost John Hughes said.
"This is a relatively minor incon
venience, not a major hardship."
Although several buildings in
and outside the Quad were closed
following the October earthquake,
this fact simply "changes the di
mensions" of the bracing problem,
said Irene Kennedy, staff associate
in the Office of Planning and
Management.
The fact that those departments
have already been relocated
means they will not factor into
the reshuffling of departments
over the six- to eight-year period
of construction, she explained.
According to Hughes, none of
the buildings under consideration
is threatened with "collapse po
tential," unlike Roble Hall, which
was closed two years ago because
it was deemed seismically unsafe.
"It is a fact that unreinforced
masonry buildings represent a
risk higher than that associated
with other types of buildings,"
said Fouad Bendimerad, manager
of seismic risk and structural en
gineering at Stanford. "The build
ings are generally safe at present
. . . although safety is a relative
matter."

All Stanford buildings have un
dergone structural evaluations
since last year's earthquake, ac
cording to Bendimerad. The struc
tures which need to be renovated
have been placed in three
"cohorts" of priority for bracing
based on their structural
deficiencies, numbers of people
who use them and amounts of
time they are occupied.
Seven buildings in the Quad
and two in the 500 series are in
cluded in the first group, which
will undergo renovation beginning
in January 1991, Bendimerad
said.
