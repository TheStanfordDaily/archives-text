# Back to the drawing board
## With defeat of fee-refund amendment, more creative reforms still sought 
### Leland Lo 
After last week's crushing
defeat of the proposed amendment
to abolish ASSU fee refunds,
many students were left wonder
ing how to reform the current
system.
Students do support reform
measures of some kind, according
to Senate Chair Ed Sasaki, who
co-authored the amendment. He
cited a poll of ASSU dorm repre
sentatives which seemed to indi
cate a majority of undergraduate
students support abolishing fee
refunds.
Despite Sasaki's optimism, the
amendment was gunned down 57
percent to 43 percent.
Securing financial security for
student groups, eliminating "free
riders" — students who keep
using ASSU programs and serv
ices from which they have taken
back their fees — and saving the
ASSU as much as $15,000 in ad

ministrative costs combine to
make a strong case for reform,
Sasaki said.
However, according to graduate
senator Doug Bone, many gradu
ate students oppose abolishing fee
refunds because they do not ben
efit from many ASSU programs
and services, which are geared
mainly to undergraduates.
Bone maintains that only a few
campus programs, such as Tues
day Films and the Graduate Stu
dent Association, cater to the
needs of graduate students.
Bone also contested the real
location system for "conscientious
objectors" in the proposed amend
ment. He said students should
have the option of refusing to let
their fees be redirected to a
"Senate Discretionary Fund" or
"Program Board Discretionary
Fund," as the amendment pro
posed.
Nevertheless, Bone supports
the idea of reforming the present

system, which critics say has left
some student groups strapped for
funds. However, this year's
amendment was hastily composed
in order to meet the election dead
line, he said. Bone said he believes
further study of the problem is
necessary before a viable solution
can be worked out.
Cecilia Tom, a losing candidate
for the Council of Presidents on
"A Clean Slate," criticized the pro
posed amendment for failing to
distinguish between general fees
and special fees.
Since general fees go to boards
under the ASSU's immediate ad
ministration — such as the Pro
gram Board, the Publications
Board and the Community Serv
ice Fund — they should not be
refundable, she said. Tom made
an analogy between general fees
and taxes paid to the federal gov
ernment, which citizens cannot
reclaim because of their opposi
tion to government programs.

However, Tom maintains spe
cial fees should be refundable be
cause they go primarily to student
groups not immediately adminis
tered by the ASSU. Allowing stu
dents the option of taking back
their fees from these groups
would make the groups more ac
countable to students' concerns,
according to Tom.
Sasaki said he will try to include
these different ideas in a new pro
posal next year. He conceded it
may take several years to create
an amendment acceptable to two
thirds of the student body.
Asked why he voted against the
constitutional amendment, junior
Jorge Martin said, "I wanted to
be able to get the refund. But if
I had known for certain what it
meant for special fees to be
reduced by 25 percent, I may have
voted the other way. They should
have been clearer about this dur
ing the elections."
