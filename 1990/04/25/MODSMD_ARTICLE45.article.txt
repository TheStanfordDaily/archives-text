# Law students adopt non-discrimination policy
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The Stanford Law Students Association has
adopted a policy to promote an atmosphere
of nondiscrimination, diversity and tolerance
throughout the Law School community.
The policy, adopted last week, states that
the Law Students Association "fully endorses
and embraces the University's Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy." But the policy goes
a step further in advocating "that positive
measures be taken to ensure that there is
ample inclusion and participation of histori
cally underrepresented groups in the student
body and faculty."
The policy supports tolerance for diversity
of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation,
age and disability. At the same time, it "urges
that the Law School continue to maintain an
atmosphere conducive to the expression of all
views."
According to Brian Levin, principal author
of the statement and the association's vice
president of student affairs, the policy serves

to "encourage discussion of different ideas"
and to promote "an atmosphere in which
everybody can feel comfortable."
Julie Hansen, a member of the Native Amer
ican Law Students Association, said, "I think
the statement is a good thing. There are
groups that have felt marginalized."
While Levin said the Law School has not
witnessed open and hostile conflict, "you never
know if it's there until it hits you."
He added that the University's policy of
nondiscrimination has not always been en
forced. "Some gay students have told me it's
baloney," Levin said.
While Levin said the University's policy
merely states that discrimination will not be
tolerated, the Law Association's policy hopes
to promote a "moral tone" in the Law School
that "discourages incidents of intolerance" and
promotes diversity.
The broadly worded policy avoids outlining
a strategy for the Law School to follow be
cause, as Levin said, "we would be overstep
ping our bounds to suggest [to the
administration] a specific way of implementing

our plans."
The power of the policy therefore lies in its
"symbolic significance," according to Levin.
Because they have not yet read the policy,
Law School administrators declined to com
ment on it. Few law students have seen the
proposal.
Levin said the Law Association encountered
some criticism from students and faculty "who
thought this policy was a call for additional
regulation of speech and behavior."
Levin disagreed, saying the policy aims at
creating a community in which it is socially
unacceptable to engage in racist speech or
behavior. "Hopefully the tone will create an
atmosphere where calls for regulation will
become moot."
As for racist or derogatory speech, Levin
said, "If you do say it, you will not be violating
legislation; rather, you will be violating the
norms of a community."
Levin concluded, "If we want more women,
blacks, disabled people and other minorities
in major positions in the legal profession, we
should start right here at home."
