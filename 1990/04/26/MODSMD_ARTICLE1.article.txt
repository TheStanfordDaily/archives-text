# SCAAN begins new drama

"Members of the Stanford community,
it is not too late to protect yourselves!"
graduate student Ben Robinson shouted
through a megaphone in White Plaza
yesterday.
As he warned passersby against "sub
versives" on campus, students dressed
as soldiers passed out fliers displaying
mug shots of "dangerous" students and

faculty members and the slogans "She
is a subversive" and"He is a subver
sive."
Thus began Project Awareness*, the
largest and longest dramatic simulation
the Stanford Central America Action
Network has ever attempted. The press
conference staged yesterday was the first
in a series of guerrilla theater actions
that will culminate "in a dramatic

enactment on May 2 and 3," said
SCAAN member Steve Piche, a
graduate student.
During the next week 40 vol
unteers — including ASSU
senators, student organization
and fraternity members, and Eng
lish Prof. Ronald Rebholz — will
be publicly threatened by means
of fliers and visits by "death
squads."
According to a press release, the
group hopes to "increase aware
ness of death squad activities in
El Salvador and Guatemala and
their links to the United States."
During this school year alone,
Piche said, 15 Guatemalan stu
dents have disappeared. The
bodies of 11 have been found on
campuses so far.
The Stanford volunteers were
chosen on the basis of their
campus activities, which would be
dangerous to pursue in El Sal
vador and Guatemala.
Mike Roarke, a Senior Class
president, said he agreed to be
come a "victim" "because the
issue [of aid to El Salvador]
seemed so blatant, so clear to me."
He has not been told about every
thing that will be done to him,
he said, "so there is an element
of surprise to it all."
Earlier role-playing demonstra

tions by SCAAN have proved sur
prising indeed. During a
"kidnapping" in Otero House last
year, students misunderstood the
motives of their masked visitors
and came to the rescue of the
"victims," resulting in a visit by
the Stanford Police.
To prevent similar trouble with
Project Awareness, SCAAN mem
ber Steve Levitsky, a senior, said
that the group will notify the
dorm involved and the proper au
thorities ahead of time whenever
a guerrilla action is planned.
"We don't want to freak people
out, but we do want to raise the
level of consciousness about
what*B happening in El Salvador,"
Piche noted.
"We just want the United States
to cut its funding to El Salvador,"
added Josie Saldana, a graduate
student who has lived in Nicara
gua a total of three years.
The organization bases its
simulations on information it
receives from international
watchdog organizations like Am
nesty International and the per
sonal experiences of SCAAN
members, Piche said. Their fliers
are based on a poster a SCAAN
member saw in the San Salvador
Airport last November.
SCAAN points out that the
United States gives $1.4 million
a day to the Salvadoran govern
ment, stating that there are no
provable links between right-wing
death squads and the government.
