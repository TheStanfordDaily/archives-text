Chairs, anyone?
It's a simple request. All
Pedro Castaneda asks from
University President Donald
Kennedy is 25 chairs. Nothing
special. Just the folding ones
that don't cost much.
The chairs, he wrote to Ken
nedy in a letter yesterday, are
necessary for Webb Ranch
workers who must stand dur
ing their biweekly literacy
classes in the ranch's kitchen.
At Tuesday night's class, two
women with babies in their
arms stood for one and a half
hours learning English from
Stanford students and Cas
taneda. Ten other men and
women stood around the
kitchen for the session.
Castaneda, who is director of
the Stanford Literacy Improve
ment Project, wrote, "Since ed
ucation is Stanford's mission,
we have an obligation to share
our resources with Webb Ranch
workers who are affiliated with
the University. These students
are eager to learn and in im
mediate need of our assis
tance."
Man suffers seizure
An unidentified man suf
fered a seizure early last night
in the Varian Physics Labora
tory library.
Medical personnel on the
scene, who did not want to re
lease the man's name, said he
was taken to Stanford Hospital.
The man had the seizure at
about 7:30 p.m. and was a
diabetic, according to a library
staffer.
