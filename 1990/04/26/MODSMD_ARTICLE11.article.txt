Li talks to press
MOSCOW (AP) — Chinese Premier Li Peng,
whose hard-line government cracked down on
protesters clamoring for democracy one year
ago, said yesterday he is sure that this spring
will be silent.
Speaking at a news conference during the
first visit to the Soviet Union by a Chinese
head of government in 26 years, Li also ac
knowledged the fall of communism in Eastern
Europe. But he said it was "too early to say"
whether those nations would abandon
socialism.
He termed his Moscow visit a success be
cause both nations agreed to reduce military
forces along their common border and continue
"good-neighborly, friendly relations," although
there was a hint the two longtime Communist
rivals could not reach a complete agreement.
"Some believe that in April, May or June
of this year, more disturbances will affect
China, but I am sure that nothing of that
sort will happen," Li said.
"Last year, this time around, I concentrated
on handling these very delicate issues," he
said. "Now I am on an official visit to the
Soviet Union, which means that the political
situation in our country is stable."
Havel briefs Shamir, offers help
JERUSALEM (AP) — Czechoslovak Presi
dent Vaclav Havel yesterday briefed Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir on a meeting he had
with the leader of the PLO and offered his
help in mediating between Israel and the Pal
estinians.
Shamir, who opposes any dealings with the
PLO, did not appear to take Havel up on his
offer.
Havel, who on his arrival earlier yesterday
became the first Eastern European leader to
visit the Jewish state, met with PLO chief
Yasser Arafat in Prague this month.
"(Havel) said he has a great interest in this
conflict and would like to help. But he knows
it is complicated. We did not discuss any spe
cific steps that could be taken by Czechoslo
vakia in this respect," Shamir told reporters.
Violence spreads in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Artillery shells
slammed into residential districts yesterday as
rival Christian forces exchanged barrages, kil
ling 13 people and wounding 17, police said.
Police said the shells fell on both sides of
the Green Line dividing the city's Christian
and Moslem sectors.
Five people were killed and four wounded
in Moslem west Beirut. Ambulances sped
through the streets as people sought refuge
in basements and air raid shelters.
West Beirut has not been involved in the
fighting between the Lebanese Forces militia
led by Samir Geagea and the Christian troops
loyal to Gen. Michel Aoun. However, stray
shells frequently have fallen in West Beirut.
Government head named
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — President Mobutu
Sese Seko named a former professor yesterday
to head a transitioned government that will
oversee this central African country's move to
a multiparty democracy, government sources
said.
The announcement came one day after
Mobutu declared that he was lifting a 20-year
ban on opposition parties and ending his ruling
party's monopoly on power.
Mobutu has wielded nearly absolute power
since taking over in November 1965. He said
the constitution would be rewritten and a
transitional government set up to run the
country until democratic elections are held
within a year.
Angola announces talks
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Angola yester
day announced that it would begin the first
direct peace talks with the UNITA rebels in
the next few days to "find the path" to end
their 14-year-old civil war.
Angola's foreign minister, Pedro de Casto
Van Dunem Loy, told a news conference that
the talks followed mediation by Portugal, the
former colonial power in the African nation.
But he said U.S. and South African supplies
to the rebels could hinder progress.
