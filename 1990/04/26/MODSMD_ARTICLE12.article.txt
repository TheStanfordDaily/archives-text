MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) —
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took the
presidential oath yesterday, ending 11
years of leftist Sandinista rule in Cen
tral America's largest country. She im
mediately proclaimed a political am
nesty and ended the military draft.
"This blessed Nicaragua, instead of
burying its sons in a fratricidal war,
will bury its weapons forever, so the
cannon will never roar again,"
Chamorro told a crowd of 15,000 inside
a Managua baseball stadium.
The transition follows nine years of
a U.S.-backed insurgency in which
30,000 people died. Chamorro inherits
a legacy of suspicion and distrust, a
nation of 3.5 million residents that
resembles an armed camp and an econ
omy shattered by the U.S. trade em
bargo and rampant inflation.
The inauguration of Chamorro, a
conservative elected in February,
brought immediate U.S. aid and trade
assistance.
Outgoing President Daniel Ortega
lashed at the United States — which
backed the Contra rebels — for sup
porting an "uryust and cruel war." He
promised to lead a constructive oppo
sition and said if civil war broke out
again, "the elections would have been
for nothing."
Chamorro said Gen. Humberto Or
tega, former President Ortega's broth
er, will head the army but that she
would assume the post of defense min
ister to "direct personally the pro
cesses of demobilization and
demilitarization and to put an end to
the war."
She said she would order Gen. Or
tega to establish a plan to reduce the
size of the Sandinista army and got
her biggest cheer when she decreed an
end to the extremely unpopular draft.
She added that draftees already in
service would be released early.
Chamorro also said she would grant
"a wide and unconditional amnesty"
to those responsible for political
crimes.
The Ortega appointment drew ob
jections from Chamorro's allies in the
United National Opposition, a coali
tion of 14 parties, and in the Contra
movement.
Dignitaries from 83 countries and

nine international organizations atten
ded the inauguration. Also present
were members of the Sandinista
Cabinet and high-ranking officers of
the Sandinista army.
Chamorro got a boost from Vice
President Dan Quayle, who brought
symbolic gifts of flour and cooking oil,
the first installment of $24 million in
U.S. food aid.
He also brought word that President
Bush has approved $2.5 million in
medical supplies, signed a formal dec
laration saying Nicaragua is no longer
a Marxist-Leninist country, restored

its quota for sugar exports to the
United States and made businesses
wishing to invest in the country eli
gible for low-cost government loans.
Quayle called Chamorro's inaugura
tion "the miracle of Managua."
When Quayle arrived for the inau
guration, he was greeted by boos and
at least one projectile, which missed
his limousine. He waved as he emerged
from the car.
In her speech, Chamorro said she
would ask the National Assembly to
"repair injustices committed" by sei
zure of property under Sandinista rule,

but added that peasants will be guar
anteed title to property redistributed
under the Sandinista agrarian reform
program.
She also said economic controls
would be lifted in an effort to spur
economic production, a process already
begun by the Sandinistas.
The streets of Managua were largely
empty yesterday, a national holiday
and the 21,000-seat stadium was about
two-thirds full.
Chamorro was greeted by a barrage
of water balloons when she made her
entrance.
