BONN, West Germany (AP) â€” A
female assailant stabbed opposition
leader Oskar Lafontaine in the neck,
severing an artery, during a campaign
rally yesterday. Officials said the left
of-center governor of Saarland state
was in serious condition.
Doctors at University Clinic in the
Cologne suburb of Lindenthal were
trying to save the life of Lafontaine,
chosen by the opposition Social Dem
ocrat Party to challenge Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in December's national
elections, a television network re
ported.
A woman in a white dress ap
proached Lafontaine in an auditorium
at another Cologne suburb holding a

bouquet of flowers and stabbed him
in the neck with a knife, television
ZDF reported.
In a late-evening news broadcast,
another TV network, ARD, showed the
46-year-old politician lying on the floor
as blood poured from his neck. Several
people crowded around him and tried
to administer first aid.
The stabbing suspect, a middle-aged
woman, sat impassively as a throng
of policemen screamed at her, "Who
are you? Who are you? Tell us your
name! Say it!"
The woman said nothing, and the
television showed her being taken out
of the hall by a group of policemen.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said

she was arrested. There was no known
motive for the 9 p.m. attack.
"Oskar Lafontaine collapsed imme
diately, covered with blood. The at
tacker was captured," ZDF reported.
ZDF said 800 to 900 people were at
the campaign rally in suburban Muel
heim.
"Everyone in the hall was horrified.
There was mass confusion," said ZDF.
A spokesman for the Interior Min
istry said an artery was severed in
the attack, and the wound was life
threatening.
Social Democrat spokesman Eduard
Heussen said Lafontaine's condition is
"very serious."
Heussen said the attacker ap

proached Lafontaine on the dais with
a bunch of flowers and an album con
taining poetry.
The woman stabbed him in the neck
while he was looking at the album,
Heussen said.
Lafontaine was rushed by am
bulance to the University Clinic in the
Cologne suburb of Lindenthal.
On Monday, Lafontaine harshly crit
icized Kohl for the projected cost of
German reunification.
The outspoken politician, whose
party trounced Kohls Christian Dem
ocratic Union in state elections in Jan
uary, has been considered a tough op
ponent in the chancellor's bid for a
third four-year term.
