Telescope launched
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -
Discovery's astronauts overcame
balky equipment to send the Hubble
Space Telescope floating free from
the shuttle yesterday on a 15-year
quest for secrets of the universe.
The $1.5 billion telescope began
orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at
an altitude of 380 miles high above
the atmosphere.
"Discovery, go for Hubble release,"
Mission Control told the crew at 3:37
p.m. EDT. The event occurred a min

ute later as the shuttle slowly and
carefully backed away.
White House spurned
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House moved yesterday to take up a
guns-for-butter Democratic alterna
tive to President Bush's 1991 budget
as a leading Democrat gave a cold
shoulder to formal talks with the
White House.
Democratic leaders predicted pas
sage of their $1.24 trillion package,
despite widespread opposition from

the Republican minority.
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., said congressional budget
work would proceed without waiting
for formal deficit-reduction talks
with the administration.
Congressional Republicans and
White House officials have called for
such bargaining for months, saying
it's the only way to realistically craft
a way to shrink the budget shortfall.
Bush defends position
WASHINGTON (AP) - President

Bush, bitterly criticized by Lithuania,
said yesterday"I don't need any de
fense" for refusing to penalize the
Soviet Union for its economic
squeeze on the breakaway Baltic re
public.
Senate Democratic Leader George
Mitchell said Bush should take some
action "to express disapproval and to
deter further actions" against Lit
huania.
He suggested slowdowns in U.S.-
Soviet talks on the environment,
taxes, investment or trade.
