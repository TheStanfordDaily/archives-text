## More input needed 
### 
FREE SPEECH and freedom
from discrimination.
Everyone has a stake in
these two issues, and everyone has
an opinion.
However, the number of people
actively voicing their concern on
these issues to the Student Con
duct Legislative Council has been
minimal. The SCLC, faced with
the task of revising the Fundamen
tal Standard, has made significant
efforts to solicit input from the
Stanford community, but the re
sponses have totaled less than 10.
This apparent apathy toward
these important issues was re
flected in the recent ASSU elec
tions, in which only two candidates

from the same party ran for the
three open positions on the SCLC.
In the future, all parties need to
make a commitment to addressing
these concerns because this is a
concrete way for student input to
affect University policy.
The community needs to evalu
ate its position on this proposal
that will affect all students. More
specifically, upperclassmen who
have "lived through" the various
phases of the Fundamental Stand
ard need to voice their opinions
based on their past experiences.
The deadline is May 4.
The only way the Fundamental
Standard will represent student
needs is if the students respond.
