# Entering a new era
## 
### 
THE COMMITTEE on Un
dergraduate Studies' pro
posed overhaul of the
distribution requirements does an
excellent job of reorganizing the
undergraduate experience so that
it more accurately teaches students
about the world in which we live.
As technological and political
change remove the barriers which
have separated peoples and coun
tries, it is imperative that the cur
rent generation of college students
develops understanding and re
spect for the multiplicity of cul
tures which share our planet. The
new proposal is a timely and im
portant step in that direction.
By eliminating the asterisk
status of non-Western cultures and
creating a distinct DR for world
cultures, the proposal provides for
a more substantive exploration of
the cultures of the world. It never
made much sense to include the
four billion non-European people
under a single asterisk.
By distinguishing gender studies
from ethnic studies, the committee
again allots for more fair and equal

treatment of important segments
of the population. Requiring one
of the courses from the nine DR
areas to satisfy the gender require
ment forces students to give addi
tional thought to incorporating the
study of women and gender issues
into their schedule.
The integration of ethnic studies
into American studies has tremen
dous potential. People of color have
long argued that their experiences,
cultures and contributions have
been central to the development of
this country. If we can successfully
expand the definition of
"American" to include people of
color as equal and central players
in the nation, we can again lead
the education community into a
new era of multicultural progress.
The last chapter of Martin Lu
ther King Jr.'s last book is titled,
"The World House." By adopting
and implementing the current DR
proposal, we can begin to lay the
foundation for constructing an in
ternational community in which all
people are respected.
