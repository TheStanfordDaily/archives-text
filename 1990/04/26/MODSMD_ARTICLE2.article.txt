# Dispute over cartoon write-ins continues
## 
### Jeannie Heltzel Staff writer 
In a postelection week fraught with numer
ous twists unintelligible even to many ASSU
insiders, the dozen or so protesters still oc
cupying the ASSU offices have been the most
subdued actors in the entire drama.
The protesting students have spent the last
two nights peacefully camped in the ASSU
offices and playing "Risk" and "Trivial Pur
suit."
Meanwhile, ASSU Elections Commissioner

Steve Krauss revealed yesterday that Bart
Simpson, a popular cartoon character, had
received enough votes in last week's election
to capture one of the non-voting graduate
senate seats. Because he is not currently a
registered student — nor one of those admit
ted to next year's freshman class — he may
not claim the position.
Simpson, the "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" and the so-called "Nurk Twins" were
at the center of the election protest that began
Tuesday evening. Krauss ruled that votes for
these slates in the Coucil of Presidents race

would not be counted, infuriating some of
those who voted for a write-in slate.
Graduate student Perry Friedman, a spokes
person for the protesters, said he and the
various students rotating in and out of the
office between classes and meals plan to stay
"until the point is moot," meaning that either
the parties involved strike a compromise and
agree to mediation or the current election
results are solidified.
Krauss said he sympathized with the pro-
testers and others who have con
tested the validity of the COP
election results, admitting that
the ASSU lacks a judicial branch
to which they might appeal.
Nevertheless, Krauss left open
the possibility of a re-evaluation
of the election results. "If it were
agreed upon by everyone involved,
I would be as cooperative as pos
sible," he said.
The Students First party has
already paid $250 for a vote
recount, which will take place next
week. Representatives of both
Students First and the People's
Platform have been invited to ob
serve, according to Krauss.
According to Cecilia Tom, mem
ber of "A Clean Slate," the Stu
dents First COP slate, her party
plans to wait until the recount
next week before deciding what,

if any, further action to take.
"I sense the general discontent
of students on this campus," said
Tom. "The 282 votes which the
Elections Commission disquali
fied were legal votes, and Steve
Krauss was not empowered by the
ASSU Constitution to invalidate
them."
Though Krauss said he is will
ing to consider mediation by an
unbiased third party, he believes
the Elections Commission's ruling
is "perfectly consistent with the
way they do it in the state of
California."
He quoted Santa Clara County
Asst. Registrar Dan Smith as say
ing that California state laws re
quire that write-in votes for
ineligible candidates be thrown
out of the final tally.
Though Krauss conceded that
Stanford elections are not subject
to California election laws, he
argued that the Elections Com
mission's ruling is "consistent
with past interpretations of the

(ASSU) Constitution and
Bylaws."
Krauss pointed out that "stu
dents have a responsibility to vote
for an eligible candidate if they
want (their votes) to be counted."
In addition, an official Elections
Commission statement distrib
uted yesterday in dorms explained
that "the Bylaws specifically state
that 'incorrectly marked' ballots
should not be tallied, and, empir
ically, votes cast for ineligible can
didates have been treated as
incorrectly marked ballots."
The official statement by the
Elections Commission also states
that neither the Bylaws nor the
ASSU Constitution "specifies just
what constitutes a vote cast." The
Bylaws do not specify what an
"incorrectly marked" ballot is.
Of the 282 votes ruled in
eligible, 35 were for the "Nurk
Twins," 28 for the "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles" and 43 for
either the "Chaparral" or the
"Hammer and Coffin" slates.
