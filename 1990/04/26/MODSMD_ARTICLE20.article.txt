## Love, hate and semantics 
### 
«T HATE HER."
As a 7-year-old being dragged
-L off to Chinese school by my par
ents on a Friday night, I found it perfectly
reasonable to badmouth the teacher who
had assigned us to write the character
for "dog" 1,000 times.
By whining a bit, I hoped to gain sym
pathy from my parents.
What I got instead was "What do you
mean — you HATE her? ..." They pro
ceeded to berate me as if I had just said
something that exuded evil.
"But everyone uses the word hate," I
protested, utterly confused. "It doesn't
mean anything."
The same thing happened a week later
when I said that I hated asparagus. It
took me a long time to figure out that
the Chinese word for hate, hun, is
reserved for serious hating, as in mortal
enemy/I-want-him-dead hating. So it's
not possible to hun asparagus (unless
you want to stab it to death, which is
pretty silly considering that it's already
dead). I explained to my parents that
when I used the word hate, it meant the
words "intensely dislike."
Which is pretty much how the word
hate is used day to day. People hate
mosquitos. Andy Rooney just hates it
when (fill in the blank) happens.
What happens then, when you hun
someone? Having used the word hate for
stuff like asparagus and midterms, how
would you convey hatred for your mortal
enemy?
"I really, really hate him." (Ineffective.)
"I loathe her." (Melodramatic, inspires
laughter.)

"I want to stomp him to pieces." (Gets
the idea across, but uneconomical use of
words.)
Like an all-purpose pencil, the word
hate has been used to the point of dull
ness, leaving it at 10.5 percent of its
original word value.
Similarly, the word love has been bat
tered to exhaustion. We love the weather.
We love chocolate chip cookies. Organi
zations you've never heard of write to
say they love you. In the movie
"Roxanne," Steve Martin asks Daryll
Hannah, "How can I use the same word
people use for soap about you?"
A word uttered a trillion times begins
to lose that umph with which it emerged
from the first speaker. Through the sys
tematic de-umphing of language, the two
most powerful human emotions have
come to be represented by two words
more trite than the word trite itself.
What may have started out as hyper
bole has degenerated into word abuse —
a generation of ineffective catchwords.
With inefficacy comes a cloud of con
fusion that envelopes the word's meaning.
For rather than being mere clothes for
our thoughts, words live within us, curb
ing or broadening our thought. When we
abuse words, we use words to abuse,
bandying and accepting terms without
evaluation.
Abused words drift in and out of our
senses, just barely denting our conscious
ness. The words that have been thrown
into the grave of stale overuse taint the
ideals they presume to represent.
The campus catchword of the year,
"multiculturalism," lies precariously at

grave's edge, threatening to be stomped
into vagueness. Judging from the election
campaigns, everyone seems to support it,
but few can provide a definition.
Is it a celebration of cultures? Acknowl
edgment of discrimination? A push for
affirmative action and the hiring of more
minority faculty? Ethnic studies? Or just
the innocuous peripheral changes like
eating sushi or enchiladas once a week?
It is much easier to say, "I love different
cultures!" than to specify action to create
an atmosphere in which all cultures can
thrive.
Too often individuals hide behind the
umbrella of multiculturalism, touting a
trendy package whose contents are never
revealed.
Through abuse and overuse, the word
undergoes a deprivation of relevance.
I really hate it when that happens.
