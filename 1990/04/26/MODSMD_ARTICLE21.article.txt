## 'Evidence' of Armenian genocide largely fabricated 
### 
AS IS TRADITIONALLY the case,
the last week of April brings
with it intense propaganda activ
ity on the part of Armenian groups.
They chose April 24 to be the day for
them to commemorate the alleged
"Turkish genocide of Armenians."
The Armenians' claim is that in the
mid-1910s the Ottoman government
decided to exterminate the whole Ar
menian population, then numbering in
the range of 1 million to 1.5 million,
according to Western sources.
Why would a country known for
treating its minority populations very
fairly suddenly reverse its centuries-old
policies? (In the history of the Empire,
Armenians, as well as Greeks and
Jews, have held numerous high
ranking governmental positions).
The fact of the matter is that the
once-faithful Armenian population in
Eastern Anatolia had taken up arms
against the Ottoman Empire, fero
ciously fighting on the side of Britain,

France and Russia in World War I.
They were murdering their fellow
citizens, those Turks with whom they
had been peaceful and friendly neigh
bors for long years.
Under these circumstances, the
Ottoman government adopted a policy
of relocating the Armenian population
of Eastern Anatolia to the southeast
ern regions, where they would not be
able to act together with their Russian
allies.
It was during this mass relocation
that many people died due to ex
tremely harsh winter conditions,
famine and lack of supplies and re
sources. Estimates of Western sources
put the death toll around 300,000
Armenians, compared to about 3 mil
lion Turkish people who were killed in
the same time period, many in the
Eastern front at the hands of Ar
menian insurgents and Russian sol
diers. Another 700,000 Armenians
emigrated or were deported from the

region.
As for the mcgor arguments and
"pieces of evidence" presented by Ar
menians, it has been proven by schol
ars, many of whom are professors at
major American colleges, that they are
fabrications.
The telegram ordering the planned
extermination of the Armenian popula
tion has been proven to be a fake, the
Nuremberg trial transcripts demon
strate that the tribunal rejected the
version of Hitler's speech with a refer
ence to Armenians in favor of two
more offical versions found in confis
cated military records and accounts of
Turkish atrocities in Western publica
tions were ploys by Western diplomats
and missionaries to fuel the war
against the Moslem Turks by display
ing them as a barbaric people murder
ing innocent Christians.
I would be the first to acknowledge
the sensitivity of the situation, but I
am also a proponent of reason and

level-headedness.
This issue is not going to get re
solved by trying to write history on
the floor of the United States Con
gress, by doing one-sided research from
a collection of Armenian historians, by
threatening the territorial integrity of
Turkey or by murdering innocent
citizens of the Republic of Turkey
(many Turkish diplomats fell victim to
Armenian terrorists' bullets in the
1970s and 1980s). The Republic of
Turkey is a country that is fundamen
tally different from the Ottoman Em
pire in every facet of social, economic
and political life.
Let's let historians investigate the
matter in greater depth and make use
of the dusty Ottoman archives, which
are at long last being opened by
Turkey for scholars to shed some more
light on the matter.
