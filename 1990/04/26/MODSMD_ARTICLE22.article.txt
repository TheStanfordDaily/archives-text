# 'Gumbo' metaphor must be credited to proper source
## 
### 
The subject of multiculturalism is an
important one — important enough to
speak carefully and accurately about.
And in an academic community, proper
attribution is equally important. Ac
cordingly, I write to correct The Daily's
report of my introduction to last
Thursday's conference on multicul
turalism.
The conference, through a panel
discussion, explored ways in which we
might define the concept more clearly.
In introducing the panel, I pointed
out that, so far, much of the effort at

definition had been conducted through
metaphor, and as an example I cited
the one in which a multicultural soci
ety is likened to a "gumbo" — a stew
with separate ingredients — as opposed
to a smoothly blended soup. I was
careful to attribute this metaphor to
the source from whom I first heard it,
Prof. James Gibbs of the Department
of Anthropology.
This metaphor has a lot going for it,
not least a second-order metaphoric
meaning that derives from the Creole
origin of the dish itself. But alas, it is
not mine.
I went on to say that, lacking culi
nary talent but familiar with biology
from an earlier incarnation, I preferred
a different metaphor — a genetic one,
in which the offspring, rather than
being a "blend" of parental traits, is
actually a mosaic of discretely varying

characteristics.
It is no surprise that The Daily
preferred Gibbs' metaphor.
