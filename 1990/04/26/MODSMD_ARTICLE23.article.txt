# Theme house ideas are not past developmental stage
## 
### 
Your article "Real Diversity" may
have misled some readers on the sub
ject of Latin American studies and
African studies theme houses. Both
these ideas are still fresh and only
that of a Latin American studies house
has reached the sensitive early develop
ment stages.

I regret not clarifying the issue in
my interview, and I apologize to all
involved for any misunderstanding.
