## Broad interpretation of ASSU Bylaws does not allow for runoff 
### 
THIS LETTER is written to
clarify the Elections Commis
sion's position regarding the
prospect of a runoff election this
spring. The Elections Commission has
reviewed the ASSU Bylaws and Consti
tution, as well as Robert's Rules of
Order and precedents set in recent
history, and has concluded that no
runoff election should occur between
the Council of Presidents slates "A
Clean Slate" and "Four Our Future."
Article 111, Section 3 of the Constitu
tion and Article IV, Section 11, Subsec
tion B(2) of the Bylaws, each mandate
that the COP be elected from a
majority of votes cast in the election,
although neither specifies just what
specifies a vote cast.
Empirically, no-votes and votes for
ineligible candidates have not been
included in the body of "votes cast,"
although a strict interpretation of the
Constitution could imply the inclusion
of both. In fact, if no-votes were in-

cluded among votes cast each year,
then every general election in the last
four years would have been rerun,
because no COP slate in the last four
years has been elected by "a majority
of the Association voting in the elec
tions," except in cases where runoffs
have been performed.
The point of this example is that the
Constitution and the Bylaws have been
interpreted broadly in the past with
regard to determining the number of
votes needed for a COP slate to claim
a "msgority," and it is the intent of the
Elections Commission to continue to
interpret these documents broadly.
Some people have brought to our
attention Article I, Section 5, Subsec
tion C of the Bylaws, which indicated
that Robert's Rules of Order should
"govern the deliberations of a body of
the Association in all cases to which
they are applicable."
We find this bylaw confusing, since
it is not clear that general elections

fall within the boundaries of the word
"deliberations." The Bylaws, in fact,
give specific charge to the Elections
Commission to interpret ail election
rules and bylaws and to "devise and
implement the procedures for carrying
out all elections" in accordance with
those rules (Article IV, Section 2,
Subsection B(4)).
Article I, Section 5, Subsection C
specifically applies to the procedures
followed when the bodies of the Associ
ation deliberate, but it does not neces
sarily dictate what decisions bodies
should make following their delibera
tions. To this extent, Robert's Rules of
Order is not a reliable guide for deter
mining which ballots should be in
cluded in counting toward a mEyority.
This is particularly true in cases
where the Bylaws conflict with
Robert's Rules of Order, since the
Bylaws supercede Robert's Rules of
Order without exception. For instance,
many ballots that Robert's Rules of

Order specifically include in counting
toward a majority, including ballots in
which the voter has voted for too
many candidates on the issue in ques
tion, would be considered "incorrectly
marked ballots" by the ByLaws and
not tallied at all (Article IV, Section 9,
Subsections A(4), B(2) and C(2)).
The Elections Commission believes
that there are fundamental similarities
between "incorrectly marked ballots"
and ballots cast for ineligible candi
dates should be considered "incorrectly
marked" and left altogether uncounted
This is not only historically consis
tent, it is also sensibly correct: It is
simply not reasonable that ballots cast
for "non-candidates," candidates or
slates that would not even be allowed
on the ballot to begin with (e.g. car
toon characters such as The Simpsons
and The Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles) should influence the outcome
of an election between only two
legitimate candidates.

The fact that one of the contending
slates obtained a majority of the
legitimate votes cast in the election
should be enough to declare that slate
a winner in the election.
The purpose of this ruling is to
reaffirm precedents the Commission
sees as meaningful. These precedents
dictate that runoff elections, expensive
and disruptive as they are, should not
be taken lightly.
A runoff election is a serious matter
that should be reserved for occasions
in which there is serious doubt about
the student body's ability to register its
opinion fairly and decisively Last
week's election, in which some people
opted to vote for ineligible slates in a
race between two legitimate contenders,
is not such a situation. It would sim
ply be wrong to allow people's votes
for fictional characters to force a
runoff situation.
