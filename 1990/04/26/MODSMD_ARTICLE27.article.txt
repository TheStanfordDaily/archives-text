## The 						redundant things in life 
### 
In the spirit of Earth Day, I've
been thinking a little about
things that the planet could
probably do without.
Donald Trump leaps to mind.
So does deforestation. Exxon?
Take a hike. Artificial turf? Get
lost. Strip mining, Zsa Zsa and
eight o'clock classes? You're un
necessary and annoying. Beat it.
The Giants, too. Would anyone
be really crushed if the entire
team just packed up and moved
to, say, Toledo? (Well, Toledo
might be.)

Bay Area fans certainly
wouldn't mind. Oh, sure, there'd
be whining for a few days, but
then you'd hear the standard San
Francisco phrase used when the
Giants' fortunes aren't looking
great: "Hey, I'm rooting for the
A's this year!" How nice. Too bad
there isn't another NBA team
around here so the Bay Area could
be two-faced in two sports.
The Giants, though, don't top
my list of things I could do with
out — but oh boy, are they close.
What don't I need to see, hear,
or have anything to do with? What
does the planet, and the sports
world in particular, have abso
lutely no use for?
Excessive baseball statistics.
No, no, no, I'm not talking
about stuff like batting
average, ERA and slugging
percentage. Those are great.
They're relevant, handy, and
simple to understand, which is
good for us low-baseball-IQ types.
The problem with statistics is
that they can get out of hand.
The first glimmer of this as far
as baseball is concerned happened
a few years ago (blame it on USA
Today), when newspapers started
expanding on the standard "Won
Lost Pet. GB" in the standings.
Call me crazy, but that seemed
to be more than enough informa
tion. (Then again, I root for the
Pirates, which means the "GB"
is all I usually need to know.)
Anyway, when you look at most
papers today, you see the standard
set plus a team's record at home,
away (not all papers assume their
readers are intelligent enough to
just subtract the home record
from the overall record), maybe
at night and how long their cur
rent streak is.
None of that is vital, but it's
nice to know, not unlike informa
tion about how the electoral col
lege really works. Nobody cares,
but if you're unbelievably bored
it can kill a few minutes.
"Hey George! know the
Cubbies are 25-36 at home but
only 22-39 on the road?"
"Really? How 'bout that."
Wonderful.
USA Today, though, goes the
extra mile. Here you get the
standards plus how a team fares
at home, at night, on grass,
against righties, indoors, against
teams that use script letters on
their uniforms, in months that
have an "r" in them and in
stadiums that serve nachos in
stead of kielbasa.
Okay, so maybe that's not all
there, but you get the idea. Again,
it's all about as necessary as air
conditioning in Siberia.
"Hey George! Y'hear the Mets
are 0-56 in games where their
opponents score more runs than
they do?"
"Y'don't say."
And then there's The Nation
al.
I haven't had a chance to
check out the latest in sports jour
nalism since the baseball season
started (Why? Because The Na
tional, well, isn't — does this seem
just a tad presumptuous on their
part?), but rumor has it they've
tfllcAn the USA Tndav annroach
and extrapolated it to about the
millionth degree.
Team records on turf, at night,
against righties, in a particular
time zone, etc? Forget it. What
this world (along with a lot of
dead trees) really needs, The Na
tional decrees, is numbers for each
and every batter in the majors: at
home, against lefties, against guys
who had one too many beers the
night before and so on. It's
statistical minutiae ad nauseum.
"George, you see Wade Boggs
's battin' 20 points higher in
towns where he's got an ex
girlfriend?"
"Git out."

Is this really necessary? Do I
need to know that Bobby Bonilla
is batting .548 indoors against
left-handed Pisces in the third in
ning of tie games in the Central
time zone in July? What good is
knowing that Dave Winfield bats
.042 with runners in scoring po
sition on grass when it's cloudy
and 53 degrees against pitchers
who played Single A ball in Utica
after winning the College World
Series?
What am I supposed to do with
this? Suppose when Stanford's

Tim GrifTin comes to the plate
this weekend at Arizona State: Do
I turn to whoever's next to me,
say "Griffin's one-for-nine with
seven strikeouts at night against
pitchers with ERAs higher than
4.47 in the state of Arizona in
1990" and bet a buck he strikes
out again? Are any fans that hard
up for cash?
The numbers are nice, and I
suppose they're harmless (why
don't we ask the trees what they
think of all this?), but they don't
explain why the Cubs won their
division last year, they sure as
hell don't explain Kirk Gibson's
homer in the '88 World Series
(Gibson is batting 1.000 against

Bay Area teams in the ninth in
ning of World Series games when
he looks like he couldn't run the
mile in less than an hour) and
they most certainly do not explain
why I couldn't hit a curveball to
save my life.
It's a simple game, folks: The
pitcher tries to make the batter
miss, and the batter tries to hit
it where they ain't. The Giants
suck because no one in their bull
pen can get my grandmother out,
and the Reds are in first because
they've played the Braves six
times.
On turf. In the Eastern time
zone. At night.
In the spirit of Earth Day, I've
been thinking a little about
things that the planet could
probably do without.

lost. Strip mining, Zsa Zsa and
eight o'clock classes? You're un
necessary and annoying. Beat it.
The Giants, too. Would anyone
be really crushed if the entire
team just packed up and moved
to, say, Toledo? (Well, Toledo
might be.)

Bay Area fans certainly
wouldn't mind. Oh, sure, there'd
be whining for a few days, but
then you'd hear the standard San
Francisco phrase used when the
Giants' fortunes aren't looking
great: "Hey, I'm rooting for the
A's this year!" How nice. Too bad
there isn't another NBA team
around here so the Bay Area could
be two-faced in two sports.
The Giants, though, don't top
my list of things I could do with
out — but oh boy, are they close.
What don't I need to see, hear,
or have anything to do with? What
does the planet, and the sports
world in particular, have abso
lutely no use for?
Excessive baseball statistics.
No, no, no, I'm not talking
about stuff like batting
average, ERA and slugging
percentage. Those are great.
They're relevant, handy, and
simple to understand, which is
good for us low-baseball-IQ types.
The problem with statistics is
that they can get out of hand.
The first glimmer of this as far
as baseball is concerned happened
a few years ago (blame it on USA
Today), when newspapers started
expanding on the standard "Won
Lost Pet. GB" in the standings.
Call me crazy, but that seemed
to be more than enough informa
tion. (Then again, I root for the
Pirates, which means the "GB"
is all I usually need to know.)
Anyway, when you look at most
papers today, you see the standard
set plus a team's record at home,
away (not all papers assume their
readers are intelligent enough to
just subtract the home record
from the overall record), maybe
at night and how long their cur
rent streak is.
None of that is vital, but it's
nice to know, not unlike informa
tion about how the electoral col
lege really works. Nobody cares,
but if you're unbelievably bored
it can kill a few minutes.
"Hey George! know the
Cubbies are 25-36 at home but
only 22-39 on the road?"
"Really? How 'bout that."
Wonderful.
USA Today, though, goes the
extra mile. Here you get the
standards plus how a team fares
at home, at night, on grass,
against righties, indoors, against
teams that use script letters on
their uniforms, in months that
have an "r" in them and in
stadiums that serve nachos in
stead of kielbasa.
Okay, so maybe that's not all
there, but you get the idea. Again,
it's all about as necessary as air
conditioning in Siberia.
"Hey George! Y'hear the Mets
are 0-56 in games where their
opponents score more runs than
they do?"
"Y'don't say."
And then there's The Nation
al.
I haven't had a chance to
check out the latest in sports jour
nalism since the baseball season
started (Why? Because The Na
tional, well, isn't — does this seem
just a tad presumptuous on their
part?), but rumor has it they've
tfllcAn the USA Tndav annroach
and extrapolated it to about the
millionth degree.
Team records on turf, at night,
against righties, in a particular
time zone, etc? Forget it. What
this world (along with a lot of
dead trees) really needs, The Na
tional decrees, is numbers for each
and every batter in the majors: at
home, against lefties, against guys
who had one too many beers the
night before and so on. It's
statistical minutiae ad nauseum.
"George, you see Wade Boggs
's battin' 20 points higher in
towns where he's got an ex
girlfriend?"
"Git out."

Is this really necessary? Do I
need to know that Bobby Bonilla
is batting .548 indoors against
left-handed Pisces in the third in
ning of tie games in the Central
time zone in July? What good is
knowing that Dave Winfield bats
.042 with runners in scoring po
sition on grass when it's cloudy
and 53 degrees against pitchers
who played Single A ball in Utica
after winning the College World
Series?
What am I supposed to do with
this? Suppose when Stanford's

Tim GrifTin comes to the plate
this weekend at Arizona State: Do
I turn to whoever's next to me,
say "Griffin's one-for-nine with
seven strikeouts at night against
pitchers with ERAs higher than
4.47 in the state of Arizona in
1990" and bet a buck he strikes
out again? Are any fans that hard
up for cash?
The numbers are nice, and I
suppose they're harmless (why
don't we ask the trees what they
think of all this?), but they don't
explain why the Cubs won their
division last year, they sure as
hell don't explain Kirk Gibson's
homer in the '88 World Series
(Gibson is batting 1.000 against

Bay Area teams in the ninth in
ning of World Series games when
he looks like he couldn't run the
mile in less than an hour) and
they most certainly do not explain
why I couldn't hit a curveball to
save my life.
It's a simple game, folks: The
pitcher tries to make the batter
miss, and the batter tries to hit
it where they ain't. The Giants
suck because no one in their bull
pen can get my grandmother out,
and the Reds are in first because
they've played the Braves six
times.
On turf. In the Eastern time
zone. At night.
In the spirit of Earth Day, I've
been thinking a little about
things that the planet could
probably do without.
Donald Trump leaps to mind.
