## The
						redundant things in life 
### 
In the spirit of Earth Day, I've
been thinking a little about
things that the planet could
probably do without.
Donald Trump leaps to mind.
So does deforestation. Exxon?
Take a hike. Artificial turf? Get
lost. Strip mining, Zsa Zsa and
eight o'clock classes? You're un
necessary and annoying. Beat it.
The Giants, too. Would anyone
be really crushed if the entire
team just packed up and moved
to, say, Toledo? (Well, Toledo
might be.)

Bay Area fans certainly
wouldn't mind. Oh, sure, there'd
be whining for a few days, but
then you'd hear the standard San
Francisco phrase used when the
Giants' fortunes aren't looking
great: "Hey, I'm rooting for the
A's this year!" How nice. Too bad
there isn't another NBA team
around here so the Bay Area could
be two-faced in two sports.
The Giants, though, don't top
my list of things I could do with
out — but oh boy, are they close.
What don't I need to see, hear,
or have anything to do with? What
does the planet, and the sports
world in particular, have abso
lutely no use for?
Excessive baseball statistics.
No, no, no, I'm not talking
about stuff like batting
average, ERA and slugging
percentage. Those are great.
They're relevant, handy, and
simple to understand, which is
good for us low-baseball-IQ types.
The problem with statistics is
that they can get out of hand.
The first glimmer of this as far
as baseball is concerned happened
a few years ago (blame it on USA
Today), when newspapers started
expanding on the standard "Won
Lost Pet. GB" in the standings.
Call me crazy, but that seemed
to be more than enough informa
tion. (Then again, I root for the
Pirates, which means the "GB"
is all I usually need to know.)
Anyway, when you look at most
papers today, you see the standard
set plus a team's record at home,
away (not all papers assume their
readers are intelligent enough to
just subtract the home record
from the overall record), maybe
at night and how long their cur
rent streak is.
None of that is vital, but it's
nice to know, not unlike informa
tion about how the electoral col
lege really works. Nobody cares,
but if you're unbelievably bored
it can kill a few minutes.
"Hey George! know the
Cubbies are 25-36 at home but
only 22-39 on the road?"
"Really? How 'bout that."
Wonderful.
USA Today, though, goes the
extra mile. Here you get the
standards plus how a team fares
at home, at night, on grass,
against righties, indoors, against
teams that use script letters on
their uniforms, in months that
have an "r" in them and in
stadiums that serve nachos in
stead of kielbasa.
Okay, so maybe that's not all
there, but you get the idea. Again,
it's all about as necessary as air
conditioning in Siberia.
"Hey George! Y'hear the Mets
are 0-56 in games where their
opponents score more runs than
they do?"
"Y'don't say."
And then there's The Nation
al.
I haven't had a chance to
check out the latest in sports jour
nalism since the baseball season
started (Why? Because The Na
tional, well, isn't — does this seem
just a tad presumptuous on their
part?), but rumor has it they've
tfllcAn the USA Tndav annroach
and extrapolated it to about the
millionth degree.
Team records on turf, at night,
against righties, in a particular
time zone, etc? Forget it. What
this world (along with a lot of
dead trees) really needs, The Na
tional decrees, is numbers for each
and every batter in the majors: at
home, against lefties, against guys
who had one too many beers the
night before and so on. It's
statistical minutiae ad nauseum.
"George, you see Wade Boggs
's battin' 20 points higher in
towns where he's got an ex
girlfriend?"
"Git out."
