# Spikers down Gauchos
## Stanford advances in regionals with four-game win 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
NORTHRIDGE, Calif. -
UCSB just could not have been
as hopeless as their own coach
Ken Preston had suggested
before the match.
"Stanford should be one of the
favorites for the championship,"
Preston said. "We must play as
well as we can to beat them.
Duncan Blackman and Dan
Hanan — we just aren't going
to stop those guys."
Nice try, Ken.
Seventh-ranked Santa Barbara
did just that in game two while
testing the heavily favored No.
4 Cardinal in the first round of
the WIVA championships last
night. After an unemotional
start, however, Stanford
prevailed 15-13, 8-15, 15-5, 15-4.

Cardinal 3

Gauchos 1

Matched against a team that
Preston himself admitted should
not have been there in the place
of No. 5 Hawaii, the Cardinal
entered the contest without the
necessary intensity.
"We came out flat," senior set
ter Parker Blackman said. "We
thought that all we needed to do
was pick it up from where we
left off last time. That's not the
way to play in a regional."
But before an absurdly tiny
crowd and completely disinter
ested spectators, that's the way
Stanford came out and played.
After Goss pelted his first of a
career-high 28 kills on the night,
the Cardinal rushed to its first
lead 1-0. Despite ensuing side
out kills by Adam Keefe, who
started in place of the injured
Craig Forsyth, and senior Dan
Hanan, Stanford then surren
dered four unanswered points to

Preston's "nothing to lose"
Gauchos.
"We started playing not to lose
rather than to win," Goss said.
"We were a little bit shaky."
The shakiness eased off and
the Cardinal eased into a
rhythm. Sophomore swing hitter
Duncan Blackman led the resur
gent charge, contributing two
kills and a stuff block to prop
the Cardinal to a 10-7 advantage.
Santa Barbara continued to
battle and ran the quick option
plays over and over. Their efforts
kept them with Stanford all the
way to the end, but the Cardinal
salvaged the game with another
of Blackman's 16 kills.
The fact that Stanford could
survive playing less-than-par
and still win seemed to relax the
Cardinal even more. UCSB ran
off six consecutive points to start
the second game. The Cardinal
had no difficulty siding out
against the Gauchos in the run
but could not level a scoring blow
themselves, siding out 24 times
before they had even scored their
fourth point of the game. Down
4-10, Stanford Coach Fred Sturm
inserted junior John Alstrom
into the lineup, and although
Alstrom contributed a kill and
inspired defensive play, the
Gauchos would not relent. Per
sistent blocking by Santa Bar
bara's David Leath, who had five
solo stuffs on the night, held the
Cardinal at a distance.
Sophomore Robert Hillman
brought the team as close as he
could with two consecutive
blocks at 7-12. Santa Barbara
closed out the game, however,
with a stellar three point run.
"I thought we were a little
shaky," Sturm said.
As the teams switched sides
at the break, the realization that
this match could be the end of
the season immediately hit.
Blackman and his teammates
responded. After again conceding

an opening-game run to the
Gauchos, Stanford — down 4-0
— resurfaced. Duncan Blackman
had five kills and two aces as
the Cardinal outscored UCSB
15-1. "We played well and con
sistently," Parker Blackman
said. "The passing was great."
Charged by intense sideline
cheering from reserve middle
blocker John Bezmalinovic and
company, the Cardinal put on a
third-game show. Hanan had
two blocks and two kills in the
streak, as hard-hitting Goss con
tinued to swing away. Goss
scorched the hardwood three
times in the run.
Sturm would take no more
chances and sent four-year
starter Forsyth, whose ankle is
still less than 100 percent, into
the match for Game 4.
"The fact that Craig is such a
good blocker is something I
thought that we missed," Sturm
said.
Forsyth proved himself worthy
to the task and made several
spectacular plays to spark the
Cardinal on a 14-1 Game 4 run.
Hillman offered three of his 17
kills in the spurt that sent the
Gauchos reeling. After three
non-consequential points by
Santa Barbara, the Cardinal
closed out the match with a side
out kill by Forsyth.
"We're a little smoother when
Craig's out there," Parker Black
man said. "He's been with us all
year."
On the night, Dan Hanan built
on his career Stanford kills
record, adding 20 match kills
while hitting .351. Hillman's
.375 mark and Goss' .432 con
tributed to the .369 team hitting
percentage.
The emotional lull that
plagued Stanford early last night
will definitely not factor in
tonight. The Cardinal advances
to the semi-final round and will
meet arch-rival UCLA for the

third time this season. UCLA
has won both previous matches,
but the Cardinal promises a host
of changes.
"There's no problem getting
up for a match like this," Parker

Blackman said. "They'll be gun
ning for us, and we'll be gunning
for them."
UCLA is led by last year's
NCAA Player of the Year Trevor
Schirman.

salvaged the game with another
of Blackman's 16 kills.
The fact that Stanford could
survive playing less-than-par
and still win seemed to relax the
Cardinal even more. UCSB ran
off six consecutive points to start
the second game. The Cardinal
had no difficulty siding out
against the Gauchos in the run
but could not level a scoring blow
themselves, siding out 24 times
before they had even scored their
fourth point of the game. Down
4-10, Stanford Coach Fred Sturm
inserted junior John Alstrom
into the lineup, and although
Alstrom contributed a kill and
inspired defensive play, the
Gauchos would not relent. Per
sistent blocking by Santa Bar
bara's David Leath, who had five
solo stuffs on the night, held the
Cardinal at a distance.
Sophomore Robert Hillman
brought the team as close as he
could with two consecutive
blocks at 7-12. Santa Barbara
closed out the game, however,
with a stellar three point run.
"I thought we were a little
shaky," Sturm said.
As the teams switched sides
at the break, the realization that
this match could be the end of
the season immediately hit.
Blackman and his teammates
responded. After again conceding

an opening-game run to the
Gauchos, Stanford — down 4-0
— resurfaced. Duncan Blackman
had five kills and two aces as
the Cardinal outscored UCSB
15-1. "We played well and con
sistently," Parker Blackman
said. "The passing was great."
Charged by intense sideline
cheering from reserve middle
blocker John Bezmalinovic and
company, the Cardinal put on a
third-game show. Hanan had
two blocks and two kills in the
streak, as hard-hitting Goss con
tinued to swing away. Goss
scorched the hardwood three
times in the run.
Sturm would take no more
chances and sent four-year
starter Forsyth, whose ankle is
still less than 100 percent, into
the match for Game 4.
"The fact that Craig is such a
good blocker is something I
thought that we missed," Sturm
said.
Forsyth proved himself worthy
to the task and made several
spectacular plays to spark the
Cardinal on a 14-1 Game 4 run.
Hillman offered three of his 17
kills in the spurt that sent the
Gauchos reeling. After three
non-consequential points by
Santa Barbara, the Cardinal
closed out the match with a side
out kill by Forsyth.
"We're a little smoother when
Craig's out there," Parker Black
man said. "He's been with us all
year."
On the night, Dan Hanan built
on his career Stanford kills
record, adding 20 match kills
while hitting .351. Hillman's
.375 mark and Goss' .432 con
tributed to the .369 team hitting
percentage.
The emotional lull that
plagued Stanford early last night
will definitely not factor in
tonight. The Cardinal advances
to the semi-final round and will
meet arch-rival UCLA for the

third time this season. UCLA
has won both previous matches,
but the Cardinal promises a host
of changes.
"There's no problem getting
up for a match like this," Parker

Blackman said. "They'll be gun
ning for us, and we'll be gunning
for them."
UCLA is led by last year's
NCAA Player of the Year Trevor
Schirman.

Robert Hillman and the Cardinal overcame underintensity to shut
down the Gauchos in four games and advance to the WIVA semi
finals.
NORTHRIDGE, Calif. -
UCSB just could not have been
as hopeless as their own coach
Ken Preston had suggested
before the match.
"Stanford should be one of the
favorites for the championship,"
Preston said. "We must play as
well as we can to beat them.
Duncan Blackman and Dan
Hanan — we just aren't going
to stop those guys."
Nice try, Ken.
Seventh-ranked Santa Barbara
did just that in game two while
testing the heavily favored No.
4 Cardinal in the first round of
the WIVA championships last
night. After an unemotional
start, however, Stanford
prevailed 15-13, 8-15, 15-5, 15-4.

Matched against a team that
Preston himself admitted should
not have been there in the place
of No. 5 Hawaii, the Cardinal
entered the contest without the
necessary intensity.
"We came out flat," senior set
ter Parker Blackman said. "We
thought that all we needed to do
was pick it up from where we
left off last time. That's not the
way to play in a regional."
But before an absurdly tiny
crowd and completely disinter
ested spectators, that's the way
Stanford came out and played.
After Goss pelted his first of a
career-high 28 kills on the night,
the Cardinal rushed to its first
lead 1-0. Despite ensuing side
out kills by Adam Keefe, who
started in place of the injured
Craig Forsyth, and senior Dan
Hanan, Stanford then surren
dered four unanswered points to

Preston's "nothing to lose"
Gauchos.
"We started playing not to lose
rather than to win," Goss said.
"We were a little bit shaky."
The shakiness eased off and
the Cardinal eased into a
rhythm. Sophomore swing hitter
Duncan Blackman led the resur
gent charge, contributing two
kills and a stuff block to prop
the Cardinal to a 10-7 advantage.
Santa Barbara continued to
battle and ran the quick option
plays over and over. Their efforts
kept them with Stanford all the
way to the end, but the Cardinal
salvaged the game with another
of Blackman's 16 kills.
The fact that Stanford could
survive playing less-than-par
and still win seemed to relax the
Cardinal even more. UCSB ran
