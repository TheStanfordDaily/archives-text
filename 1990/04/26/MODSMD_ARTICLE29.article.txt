# Women's hoops squad rounds out recruiting class
## 
### 
Tara VanDerveer probably will never
recruit another class like her first — but
she sure is trying.
The women's basketball coach's initial
recruiting effort turned up the now
graduating Jennifer Az'zi, Katy Steding and
Stacy Parson — the backbone and heart
of the NCAA champion squad — a most
irreplacable class.
While VanDerveer cannot duplicate the
trio, she can emulate this year's success,
and the completion of this season's recruit
ing class highlights this fact. Once again,
the Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the
Year has signed a potential-laden recruiting
class, rounded out by yesterday's final sign
ing.
Christy Hedgpeth is the final member
of the women's basketball class of 1994.
The Street & Smith's All-American guard
from Thomasville, North Carolina an

nounced her intention to play for the na
tional champion Cardinal to VanDerveer
Wednesday.
The 5-foot-10 guard, a senior at
Westchester Academy in High Point, N.C.,
averaged 32 points a game this past season
and was a First Team All-State player.
"Christy is a great shooter," VanDeerver
said. "That's her strength, especially from
the three-point range. I know she'll be a
crowd favorite."
Hedgpeth led Westchester Academy to
the private school state championship this
year. In addition to her team-leading scor
ing average, she also brought down 12
rebounds a game, while dishing off 6 assists
and nabbing 5 steals a contest. Her 51
percent shooting percentage from the field
and 79 percent from the line gave her 799
points for the year, bringing her four-year
total to 3131.

"She is also a fine passer and has good
fundamental skills. 1 think she can help
us right away."
Hedgpeth joins fall signees Kelly Doug
herty, a 5-11 gu ardy for ward, and Niki Sevil
lian, a 5-foot-10 guard. Dougherty, from
Leavenworth, Ks., was named USA Today's
Kansas Player of the Year and was also
chosen as the Kansas/Missouri All Star
Game MVP.
The three will be filling the roster spots
of Naismith/Wade Trophy winner Azzi, All-
NCAA Tournament team forward Steding
and reserve guard Parsons.
In addition to her First Team All-Stote
selection, Hedgpeth was named Northwest
Player of the year in the state of North
Carolina, and was the All-County Player
of the Year in two separate counties —
Guilford County, where her school is, and

Davidson County, where she is from.
Basketball is not the only activity
Hedgpeth succeeds at. The guard has ac
cumulated a 4.0 grade point average and
was named her class salutorian. She has
also been Westchester Academy's Student
Athlete of the Year for her freshman, soph
omore and junior years.
The student-athlete also excelled at ten
nis and was a three-time USTA North
Carolina state doubles and one-time state
singles champion before she decided to con
centrate on basketball.
Hedgpeth chose Stanford over Duke,
Wake Forest and North Carolina. "Stanford
was so unique," she explained. "During my
visit, I felt the players were genuiniely
interested in what type of person I was. I
also feel the coaching staff is great. They
really treat the players with respect. I can't
wait to join the Stanford team."
