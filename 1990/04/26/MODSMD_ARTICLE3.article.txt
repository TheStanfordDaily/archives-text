# Departments influence admissions policies

Whether they want to attract
better math students or more star
players, many Stanford depart
ments with specific needs influ
ence the policies of the office of
Undergraduate Admissions.

But some say Residential Edu
cation, which has a more general
need for well-rounded students, is
underrepresented in the forma
tion of admission priorities.
Although it follows criteria set
by an independent faculty-student
committee, the Admissions Office
by and large shapes the composi
tion of the student body. Amid a
host of sometimes conflicting in
terests within the Stanford com
munity, Dean Jean Fetter and her
staff must successfully balance
the interests of the different de
partments.

"Every department wants
people to do their things 24 hours
a day, whether it be athletics,
music or math-sciences," says
John Bunnell, director of fresh
man admissions.
But Residential Education is
one department that many say
doesn't gain from current admis
sions policies. They claim Stan
ford students have become more
academically oriented, to the ex
clusion of other concerns, during
Fetter's six years as dean.
Meanwhile, the academic de
partments are urging that even
more strong students in their
fields be admitted.
Among those who feel the stu
dent body might be becoming
more academic is Ann Porteus,
resident fellow in Roble Hall and
assistant director of Residential
Education. Porteus has watched
the number of RA applicants
decrease by 20 percent in the last
two years, and she feels that stu
dents have less time for Res Ed
programs because they have been
studying more and more in the

last few years.
Partly because the Office of
Residential Education includes a
diverse set of RFs who do not
follow specific goals set by the
office, Res Ed does not directly
influence Admissions Office deci
sions on what kinds of students
are admitted. "It's not like we go

down to Admissions and tell them
we want more public service ori
ented students," says John Perry,
RF in Soto.
Nevertheless, some say that the
larger goal of Res Ed, to create a
positive learning experience for
students outside the classroom,
constitutes an interest to which
Admissions must respond.
Balancing interests
However, the Res Ed agenda is
only one of several special inter
ests to which Admissions must be
accountable. "The goals of Resi
dential Education must necessar
ily be one component of the
University's larger mission. . . .
We need to be responsible to dif
ferent groups," says Bunnell of
Admissions.
In addition to the Athletics De
partment — whose 29 varsity
teams hold 95 non-need-based
scholarships — the fine arts de
partments as well as the
Mathematics Department make
