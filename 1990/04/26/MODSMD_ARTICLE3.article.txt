# Departments influence admissions policies

Whether they want to attract
better math students or more star
players, many Stanford depart
ments with specific needs influ
ence the policies of the office of
Undergraduate Admissions.

News analysis

But some say Residential Edu
cation, which has a more general
need for well-rounded students, is
underrepresented in the forma
tion of admission priorities.
Although it follows criteria set
by an independent faculty-student
committee, the Admissions Office
by and large shapes the composi
tion of the student body. Amid a
host of sometimes conflicting in
terests within the Stanford com
munity, Dean Jean Fetter and her
staff must successfully balance
the interests of the different de
partments.

"Every department wants
people to do their things 24 hours
a day, whether it be athletics,
music or math-sciences," says
John Bunnell, director of fresh
man admissions.
But Residential Education is
one department that many say
doesn't gain from current admis
sions policies. They claim Stan
ford students have become more
academically oriented, to the ex
clusion of other concerns, during
Fetter's six years as dean.
Meanwhile, the academic de
partments are urging that even
more strong students in their
fields be admitted.
Among those who feel the stu
dent body might be becoming
more academic is Ann Porteus,
resident fellow in Roble Hall and
assistant director of Residential
Education. Porteus has watched
the number of RA applicants
decrease by 20 percent in the last
two years, and she feels that stu
dents have less time for Res Ed
programs because they have been
studying more and more in the

last few years.
Partly because the Office of
Residential Education includes a
diverse set of RFs who do not
follow specific goals set by the
office, Res Ed does not directly
influence Admissions Office deci
sions on what kinds of students
are admitted. "It's not like we go

down to Admissions and tell them
we want more public service ori
ented students," says John Perry,
RF in Soto.
Nevertheless, some say that the
larger goal of Res Ed, to create a
positive learning experience for
students outside the classroom,
constitutes an interest to which
Admissions must respond.
Balancing interests
However, the Res Ed agenda is
only one of several special inter
ests to which Admissions must be
accountable. "The goals of Resi
dential Education must necessar
ily be one component of the
University's larger mission. . . .
We need to be responsible to dif
ferent groups," says Bunnell of
Admissions.
In addition to the Athletics De
partment — whose 29 varsity
teams hold 95 non-need-based
scholarships — the fine arts de
partments as well as the
Mathematics Department make

recommendations to Admissions
about certain candidates strong
in their fields, says Fetter.
According to the guidelines for
undergraduate admission, last
revised in 1986, the "primary cri
terion" for admission to Stanford
is "academic excellence," while the
second standard involves "per
sonal achievement outside the
classroom," including academics,
the creative and performing arts,
community leadership, athletics
and other activities. In addition,
the Athletics Department "may
designate outstanding athletes for
special attention."
How Stanford differs from
other colleges, says Fetter, is that
coaches do not automatically ad
mit star athletes. Since all admis
sions are "my responsibility," she
says, those athletes must meet
certain academic qualifications
"no matter how badly the coaches
want them."
In addition, the Departments of
Art, Music, Drama and Dance
make recommendations on strong
candidates in each of their areas,
writing evaluations with a rating
on the scale of their enthusiasm,
which are "taken into considera
tion" by Admissions.
Similarly, in the last few years
the Math Department has initi

ated a talent program to attract
stronger math students, whereby
six faculty members read files and
give evaluations to Admissions.
"Ultimately what we're trying
to do is admit the best of every
thing," says Fetter. "The issue is
how to make a freshman class
that can meet all the demands of
the same community." She adds
that Stanford's admissions has a
particularly difficult task since it
is competing academically with
Harvard, Princeton, Yale and
MIT, but also athletically with the
other Pacific 10 Conference col
leges.
Res Ed's mission
According to Bunnell, each of
those competing interests cares
primarily about the needs of its
own students. The goals of Res
Ed are different: The office is re
sponsible for all students who live
in the dorms, whether they be
varsity tennis players, virtuoso
oboists or uninvolved couch
potatoes.
According to Bunnell, Res Ed's
purpose "has to be put in its
proper place. . . . The primary
mission of the University is teach
ing and research."
At the same time, Fetter denies
that students are being admitted
primarily on academic criteria.
Since the number of students ap
plying with 4.0 grade point
averages and 1,400 SAT scores
exceeds the number of spaces for
admission, it would be "very dif

ficult" to admit students simply
on those criteria, she says.
While it is true that the per
centage of admitted students with
4.0 GPAs and 1,400 SAT scores
has increased in the last six years,
Fetter insists that this is due to
changes in the applicant pool and
"not any conscious decision by the
Admissions Office" to create a
more academic student body.
"There are many ways of cre
ating a freshman class ... that
are not mutually exclusive," says
Fetter. "I believe people are mul
tiply talented. My personal prin
ciple is to try to admit the best
of everything."
Cost of being the best
Some believe this practice has
led to other changes in the student
body. John Perry, for example,
said he thinks there is a noticeable
trend away from well-rounded
students to those who are espe
cially good at one or two things.
Branner RF Kennell Jackson
said he thinks it ironic that al
though students may be becoming
more academically serious, the in
tellectual level of student life, as
measured through such organiza
tions as reading groups and
literary societies, is relatively low.
"Considering the resources
Stanford has, it is surprising that
the public value on producing in
teresting things is so low," he
said, adding, "I think it's a mis
take for Stanford to congratulate
itself so much."
