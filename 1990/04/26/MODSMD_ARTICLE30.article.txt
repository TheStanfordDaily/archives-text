# Life without Tami
## Teri Whitlinger just keeps on winning, even though twin sister is no longer around 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Ever since they were born just
minutes apart on Nov. 13, 1968,
Teri and Tami Whitlinger have
been inexorably linked. Twin

sisters. Tennis stars. Together
forever.
Or so it seemed. At the end of
last year, Tami Whitlinger decided
to leave school and join the pro
fessional tour. She is having an
excellent rookie season. Teri Whit

linger stayed behind at Stanford.
How is life for the two-time All-
American these days?
"She was wondering what life
was going to be like AT — after
Tami," Coach Frank Brennan
says. "I've never seen her more
happy, more contented, more
relaxed. All those questions: I al
ways play doubles with Tami. 1
always warm up with Tami ..."
All those questions have appar
ently been answered. Whitlinger
and Meredith McGrath, her new
doubles partner, are ranked No.
3 in the country. She is currently
ranked 10th in singles. In team
competition, the Cardinal junior
has yet to lose a match in 1990
— that includes singles and dou
bles.
Okay, everything appears fine
on the surface, but what does
Whitlinger think? "It's been very
strange without my sister, emo
tionally and socially. She was my
best friend," Whitlinger says.
"Whenever things were going on
or going wrong, I'd always have
her to talk to."
While she has not found any
one person to replace her sister,
Whitlinger explains that her
roommates, teammates and other
close friends have helped fill the
void. And, Teri Whitlinger sees
one definite positive in not having
sister Tami around to cast that
big shadow.
"It's given me a chance to be
selfish, think about myself and
put my game together," she says.
"Seeing what she's done on the
tour has been very encouraging
to me. It's made me want to work
harder and get to do the things

she's been doing."
Though her future success is
not guaranteed, her present sug
gests there are good times ahead.
Whitlinger, who plays No. 4
singles, routinely goes out and
quickly dispenses with her oppo
nents. She has lost just one match
in the past two seasons, largely
because she is simply better than
the people on the other side of
the net.
On any other team, Whitlinger
would play no lower than the sec
ond spot in the lineup. The Car
dinal, though, has four other
players about whom the same
thing could be said. Whitlinger
does not complain. She just keeps
hammering the competition. One
might think she would be a little
bored.
Not Whitlinger. "It doesn't get
tiresome," she says. "With each
win it's very gratifying. It makes
me feel like I've come a long way.
Playing No. 4 this year, I was a
little discouraged. I wanted to play
higher and play better competi
tion. But women's collegiate ten
nis this year is very strong. I'm
still playing some girls that are

giving me a pretty good run for
my money."
Brennan puts it this way: "Teri
Whitlinger stays motivated the
same way I do. You never want
to lose. You want to win as quickly
as you can, as badly as you can,
as often as you can."
Whitlinger's belief in that phi
losophy is especially true in team
competition. Since her arrival
here, the Cardinal has lost just
two dual matches. Often the other
team does not even win a set.
Again, it seems like it could get
a bit routine for her.
Wrong again. "I never get tired
of it," she says. "It's fun to win.
I don't think anyone could ever
say it's not fun to win." Freshman
Heather Willens said recently she
hoped that the matches would be
closer at the NCAA Champion
ships. Whitlinger sees things dif
ferently.
"To me, now being a junior and
experiencing what I have, I'd just
as soon win 6-0 in singles and get
the hell out of there," she says.
"It's plain exciting that we can

win 6-0," she adds with a laugh.
Of course, if the match is not
clinched after singles, the No. 1
doubles team of McGrath-
Whitlinger is like money in the
bank. After years of playing with
Tami, Teri Whitlinger got in one
set of practice with her new part
ner before their first tournament
together.
The event was the Riviera All-
American in the fall, one of the

biggest tournaments of the year.
All McGrath and Whitlinger did
was win the whole thing. Their
opponents in the finals, Georgia's
Shannan McCarthy and Stacey
Schefflin, managed to win just one
game.
Stanford's top tandem has been
rolling ever since, and Whitlinger
is enjoying it. "Rarely is there a
time when we're playing when I
feel like there's a chance we're
going to lose," she says.
But the biggest difference be
tween playing with McGrath and
Tami Whitlinger is in the volume

level on the court. If Teri does
something wrong, McGrath takes
it in stride. "It's quite different
than playing with my sister — no
one yelling at me anymore," she
says.
In the future, Teri figures she
and Tami will be together again
on the doubles court. The skill
will still be there, but the scream
ing will be left behind, she says.
For the moment, though, she
and McGrath have their sights
set on becoming Stanford's first
NCAA champions since Linda
Gates and Leigh Anne Eldridge
won the title in 1985.
