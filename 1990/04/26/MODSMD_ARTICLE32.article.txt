# Doubles court good enough for team-oriented Turbow
## 
### Uri Attia 
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger's
four-year old daughter, Claire, ap
proached Dan Turbow before
practice to ask about the
upcoming Pacific 10 Conference
Individual Championships, to be

held this weekend in Ojai, Calif.
"Are you playing this weekend,
Dan?" she asked.
"Am I playing?" The junior
thought for a minute, then picked
up the child and responded, "Not
if your father has anything to say
about it."

It is this sense of humility and
an ability to put the team's goals
ahead of his own that have made
Turbow a contributor to
the success of the Stanford team
over the past three years.
Although Turbow has been un
able to crack the top six in singles,

he has still managed to make a
considerable impact by playing
doubles in the No. 1, No. 2 and
No. 3 spots for the Cardinal this
year. Turbow has performed well,
despite having to play with several
different partners. Over the
course of the year, he has been
paired with Jonathan Stark, Eric
Peus, Alex O'Brien, Jason Yee and
Barry Richards.
Because of the variety of dou
bles partners, Turbow has been
forced to be versatile, often
switching from the ad court to
the deuce court when returning
serve. "[Having to switch from
one side of the court to the other]
certainly affects my game," Tur
bow said. "But I realize that I
have to do whatever helps the
team most."
Turbow's ability to adapt him
self to suit his teammates' games
has not gone unnoticed. "Tur
bow's compatibility is an attribute
that has been essential to the
team's success this year," Coach
Dick Gould said. "It is extremely
difficult to have to constantly ad
just to different styles of play, and
Dan has excelled in this role."
Against California, Turbow
teamed with Stark at the No. 1
doubles position and nearly upset
the tandem of Doug Eisenberg
and Matt Lucena, the No. 1-
ranked team in the country, losing
6-4 in the third set. Most recently,
Turbow has been playing in the
No. 3 spot with Richards.
Turbow believes that his game
is well-suited for doubles play. His
serve-and-volley style, which has
given him a 23-12 record in dou
bles, favors the quicker points
that are more common when
there are four people on the court.

"I'm at my best when the points
are no longer than three or four
exchanges," Turbow said. "The
shorter the points, the better."
Although Turbow acknowl
edges the relative glamour of
singles, he also enjoys playing
doubles, contending that it can be
just as exciting. "A lot of the fans
come out to see doubles," Turbow
said. "When a team opts to cancel
the doubles matches, you can
really hear the boos from the
crowd."
According to Turbow, the one
thing lacking from doubles is the
heightened sense of accomplish
ment that comes from winning a
singles match. However, Turbow
will have the opportunity to per
form in both singles and doubles
at Ojai, where he will compete in
the main draw of the doubles
tournament with his sixth differ
ent partner, freshman Jared
Palmer, as well as alone in the
open division of the singles event.
Turbow came to Stanford

doubtful that he would see any
playing time as a member of the
best collegiate tennis program
over the past three years. But,
for the past three years, his strong
serve-and-volley game and his
willingness to step out of the
limelight when needed have made
Turbow an essential component
of the Stanford tennis team.
Turbow's success is not limited
to the tennis courts. He has re
ceived Stanford's Scholar Athlete
award in each of his first two
years as a human biology msyor
with a 3.9 grade point average.
Even among his teammates, who
combine for a 3.2 gpa, he stands
out.
Perhaps Stark was not entirely
serious when he described playing
doubles with Turbow as "like a
dream come true." But on a team
laden with superstars and All-
Americans, having a player who
is willing to fill the gaps like Tur
bow really is a coach's dream.

Although he has never cracked the starting singles lineup, junior Dan Tubow has definitely contributed
to the Cardinal's victorious cause through great doubles play.
