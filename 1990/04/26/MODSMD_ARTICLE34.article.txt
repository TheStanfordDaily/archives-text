# Card increases talent-laden pool

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While Stanford women's swim
ming Coach Richard Quick has
made a habit of recruiting and
signing the nation's top swimmers
every year, diving Coach Rick
Schavone is doing him one better.
Quick has long preferred reload
ing to rebuilding, but this year
Schavone has surpassed that by
going out and getting himself a
bigger gun.
A month after the greatest diver
in Stanford history competed in
her final meet for the Cardinal,
Schavone announced that Eileen
Richetelli signed a letter of intent
to come to Stanford in the fall.
Richetelli was the 1989 age-group
World Champion in the three
meter competition.
"We are graduating the finest
diver in Stanford history, Katie
Connors, and we're bringing in
the finest recruit we've ever
touched," Schavone said. "She is
without a doubt the No. 1 recruit
in the nation. . . . We're really ex
cited."
Quick also announced a signing,
that of Mary Edwards of Menlo
Park and Menlo-Atherton High
School. Edwards is a high school

All-American in the 50-and- 100-
yard freestyle and the 100 back
stroke. She was the 1989 Olympic
Festival champion in the 50 and
100 freestyles and in the 400 free
style relay while competing on the
North team.
"She is the No. 1 prospect in
sprinting that we are bringing
into school next year," Quick said.
"1 believe she is truly one of the
top national-caliber improving
sprinters in the country. She's
really improving quickly."
Edwards joins Summer Sanders
and Pam Minthorn as members
of the swim team's 1990 freshman
class.
Richetelli, from Milford, Conn.,
also placed fifth in the 16-18 group
in the one-meter event at the age
group World Championships in
Madrid, Spain, last August. She
also won a bronze medal at the
U.S. Olympic Festival last sum
mer. That event is open to all
American divers.
She will be immediately looked
upon to replace Connors, who
finished eighth on the three
meter and fourth on the platform
at last year's NCAA meet. As a
junior Connors finaled in all three
diving events, becoming only the
second person in history to make

the top eight in each at the same
NCAA meet.
According to Schavone, Ric
hetelli is already better than Con
nors is. "Right now she beats
Katie," he said. "She just beat
her last week. . . .We feel very con
fident she'll win an NCAA title
before she graduates â€” hopefully
a few years before she graduates."
Edwards should also provide
immediate help for the Cardinal,
especially in the freestyle relays.
"I've been very impressed with
her since I saw her swim last
summer in a meet here," Quick
said. "I really think she's going
to be an asset to our team next
year."
Edwards said she chose Stan
ford over UCLA and California
"because of the combination of
academics and athletics Stanford
had to offer. The only reservation
I had about going to Stanford was
that it was so close to home. .. .
After visiting on my recruiting
trip, I saw it was like a separate
community. I talked to a lot of
people about it. That shouldn't
be a problem at all.
Edwards feels she has a chance
to help Stanford in the sprint free
style area, one where Texas has
an advantage over the Cardinal.
