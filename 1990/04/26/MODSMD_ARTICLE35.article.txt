# The
						Dead may yet rise again

### David Bianco Staff writer 
Although the Grateful Dead
will definitely not play at Stan
ford next month, some possibil
ity of a spring 1991 engagement
remains following a conciliatory
meeting yesterday between
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and concerned students.
Three of the students who or
ganized Tuesday's rally in sup
port of the Dead concerts met
with Lyons for approximately
one hour. In what Lyons called
an "open and friendly discus
sion," the students said they
hoped the University would
review and reconsider its deci
sion to prohibit the concerts.
The students also presented a
petition with more than 300
signatures.
Explaining that the decision
to nix the concerts applied to
this year and was based on spe

cific University concerns, Lyons
told the students that if the con
cerns "were addressed satisfac
torily, the University would be
open" to hosting the concerts
again in 1991.
The University was concerned
about drugs, illegal camping and
vending and other problems,
and Lyons emphasized that "the
Grateful Dead and its music was
not a factor" in the University's
decision.
Discussing particulars, Lyons
and the students discovered
they had a "significant shared
interest" in improving the an
nual concerts.
According to sophomore Colin
Hubbard, who attended the
meeting with Lyons, "We want
to change the way the Dead is
done at Stanford." Hubbard said
he felt that drug laws should
be enforced.
Hubbard noted that as the
Dead have become increasingly

well-known, they have become
"too popular" in some ways for
9,000-person Frost Amphithea
ter. He said about 3,000 people
without tickets who "had no
business being there" came to
the concert last year.
The students agreed to Lyons'
suggestion that they prepare a
proposal addressing their com
mon concerns in time for a
spring 1991 concert. Lyons
called the students' initial sug
gestions "very interesting" and
cited a shared goal of separating
"the Grateful Dead from the
drug culture and 'Deadheads'
that follow their concerts."
One early possibility dis
cussed at the meeting was a
show "organized around the
theme of a drug-free concert,"
Lyons said.
Lyons was optimistic after the
meeting, saying, "I think we're
going to work together just
fine."
