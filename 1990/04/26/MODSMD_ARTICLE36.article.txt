### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Harvard Law Prof. Frank Mic
helman warned yesterday about
"ominous" dangers to American
civil liberties from the "furious
political uproar" over the consti
tutionality of burning the Amer
ican flag.
Michelman spoke in the first
annual Leah Kaplan Lecture on
Human Rights to a noontime au
dience of 100 in the Law School.
Present were University President
Donald Kennedy and Kaplan, the
University's ombudsperson and
an advocate of civil liberties.
Following the Texas v. Johnson
decision last June 21, in which
the Supreme Court ruled it un
constitutional to ban public flag
burning, a "political rush" ensued
to either amend the Constitution
or create a statute that would cir
cumvent the court decision, ex
plained Michelman.
Describing the conflict for civil
libertarians of choosing between
two evils, he said most chose to
support the statute as the lesser
evil on the grounds that Congress
would pass the legislation but it
would be nullified by the high
court.
However, Michelman argued
that the statute is in fact uncon
stitutional, adding, "It is a really

Although he said
he didn't want to
romanticize flag
burners, Michel
man defended
their actions as 'in
voking the nation's
ideals rather than
repudiating them.'

obnoxious idea, and I oppose it."
Rejecting arguments for
"sanctification" of the flag be
cause it is either a "venerable"
object worthy of protection or a
symbol of the nation's history, he
called for the rejection of such
metaphors posing as "political
proposals."
Although he said that he didn't
want to romanticize flag-burners,
Michelman defended their actions
as "invoking the nation's ideals
rather than repudiating them."
The threat to civil liberties
"troubles me more than the im
pending prospects" of the flag
burning legislation, he concluded.
