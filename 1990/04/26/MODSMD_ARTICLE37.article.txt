# Kennedy adds endorsement to flock of support for Prop. 111

An initiative supported by big business,
child protection services, chambers of
commerce, construction workers, teach
ers and school administrators in
California is about as common as a con
dor sighting.
But University President Donald Ken
nedy this week signaled that endangered
bird season is in, adding the University's
endorsement to a growing flock of support
for Proposition 111, an initiative measure
on California's June 5 ballot.
Prop. 11l is a proposed state consti
tutional amendment that would augment
the existing state spending limit, raise
gasoline taxes to pay for highway and
other transportation projects and modify
state spending on education. The result,
according to the state's Legislative

Analysts' Office, is that California would
be allowed to spend $800 million more
next year and an undetermined amount
in the future.
"It is an incremental step forward,"
said Stanford Education Prof. Michael
Kirst, "except for transportation, which
will get a gigantic shot in the arm."
The broad-based support for Prop. 11l
is almost as interesting as the initiative
itself.
Both Republicans and Democrats have
strongly endorsed the proposition, and
only one state politician is on record as
opposing it.
"The alliance of public and private in
terests behind Prop. 11l is very unus
ual," said Kirst, who is the director of
the nonprofit organization Policy Analy
sis for California Education. "This could
signal a switch in mentality from Prop.
13." H

If approved by a msyority of California
voters, Prop. 11l would change the for
mula for the Gann spending limit, ap
proved by voters in 1978. The formula,
formerly based on cost-of-living increases,
would instead be tied to per capita in
come, with population and non
residential new construction factored in
for local governments.
"I have supported attempts to revise
the Gann initiative for years," Kennedy
said. "It is absolute folly to tie our own
hands with respect to the state's delivery
of basic human services, most particu
larly the vital needs of our successor
generations."
Supporters for Prop. 11l say the Gann
limit is preventing basic services, such as
education, transportation and welfare,
from being provided at even a constant
level.
Although opposition to Prop. 11l is

disorganized at this point, some tax
payers' associations and disciples of Paul
Gann have formed a group known as
People's Advocates, which opposes the
initiative, arguing it is bad policy.
"It's a bunch of bull-puckey that state
agencies have been hamstrung, because
the budget is increasing faster than ever,"
said Ted Costa, a spokesperson for
People's Advocate. "Once they get going
on raising taxes, who knows when they'll
stop."
In addition to changing the formula
for the spending limit, Prop. 11l would
mandate specific changes in education
and transportation.
One provision would require that at
least 40.8 percent of each year's budget
be spent on public education, while negat
ing the current law that any excess rev
enues are given to the schools.
"This will spread the money around

more," explained Kirst. "It will just be
a bigger pie. Everyone will still get their
piece."
In transportation, a five cent per gallon
tax would be added, with an additional
cent added each of the next four years.
Also, truck weight fees would increase,
and passage of Prop. 11l would allow
passage of Prop. 108, a concurrent $1
billion rail bond act. Finally, transporta
tion costs would not be counted under
the Gann limit, a critical point that has
received little publicity, Kirst said.
The measure is enthusiastically sup
ported by the University of California
system, which maintains the initiative is
needed to keep quality education at a
relatively low cost.
Kirst speculated that Stanford's en
dorsement is intended to show support
for the UC system.
