* Imagine a seaside town in which
| the street person (there's only one)
asks for "a few bucks." You say,
|§|S&**y> w jIW h c says, "Sure,
thanks." Then he sits down, opens
his backpack, and pulls out a nice
| deli sandwich which he munches
to the music blaring from his
scaled- down ghetto-blaster.
Qh, and imagine that this street
person is sitting in the shade of a
$f|sgn that says "Yacht Sales," with
a large black arrow pointing to a
parking lot.

WEEKEND
GETA WA YS
last in a weekly series

But you're not shopping for
yachts, so you walk into a well
lighted shop along the main street
that sells glass knick-knacks and
windchimes. You overhear a nat
tily dressed "sales pair" (a man
and a woman) describing the su
perior workmanship and quality of
a soldered brass kaleidoscope,
while a middle-aged married cou
ple examines the instrument.
"It's from France," the salesman
says (pronounced FRAHNCE),
"and it's truly a fine piece of work."
"I'm sure it is," says the balding
customer. "But my wife and I just
spent $750 down the street on two
of these."
"Well," the salesman smiles and
states the obvious, "you'll just have
to take them back and get one

good one."
If you've imagined wealthy
streets free of street people, and
auaint little shops that ask big,
dirty dollars for heavy dust
gathering objects, you've got only
a caricatured picture of Sausalito,
a quiet community nestled in a
nook of Marin County. Just across
the Golden Gate Bridge from San
Francisco, Sausalito boasts stun
ning views of the City, the sail
boats and the bay.
The postcard-perfect images and
panoramic perspectives of
Sausalito are some of the town's
most attractive attributes. And
what's more, they're free. I can't
think of a more relaxing way for
students with a limited budget to
spend an afternoon than to pack
a delicious picnic lunch, take the
beautiful skyline highway (Hwy.
35) up the coast, cross the stun
ning Golden Gate and stake out
a shady spot on the lush grass
beneath the huge weeping willows
growing beside the peaceful bay in
sunny Sausalito.
But if you'd rather spend a few
dollars and avoid all those sappy
adjectives, you can find some great
food at incredibly reasonable
prices, even by Palo Alto standards.
A great place to go for burgers with
true California flavor is Zack's on
Bridgeway Avenue (the main street
through the town).
The outdoor dining area at
Zack's overlooks the Sausalito
piers and the quiet waters of the
bay. The restaurant management
has posted signs, "Absolutely do
not feed the birds," which seem
to have worked. Neither the
seagulls nor the pigeons expect to

be fed, and there are no fly-over
bombing raids. Just sit back and
enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and
a delicious meal.
In addition to the standard beef
hamburger — with all the tradi
tional toppings of bacon, lettuce,
tomato, pickles, onions and mayo
— Zack's offers the Blue Cheese
Burger with crumbled blue cheese,
the Maui Burger glazed with
teriyaki sauce and topped with
grilled pineapple, the Tropic Isle
Chicken Burger (a teriyaki-chicken
sandwich), the Grilled Eggplant
Burger, and the "golden fried"
Calamari Burger.
Like most trendy Bay Area res-
Zack's serves Anchor
Steam on tap. In addition, they
offer several familiar and fantastic
imported beers, from Guiness
Stout and Dos Equis to St. Pauli
Girl and Red Tail Ale. Moreover,
the full bar serves delicious mar
garitas, and they also make a fan
tastic extra-spicy bloody mary.

But maybe you're not 21, huh?
Don't worry — you can get more
bang per calorie at the Caffe
Trieste, down the street from
Zack's. The Caffe Trieste serves
spicy, flavorful pizzas and cal
zones. The "Just Pesto" pizza —
that's right, just pesto and cheese
— is definitely a neo-Californian
concept. But the Trieste Special,
with delicious sauce, fresh mush
rooms and peppers, spicy sausage,
and an assortment of other mouth
watering toppings, is definitely a
step up from Domino's.
Even after you've enjoyed your
pizza, you still can't walk out the
door. Caffe Trieste will tempt you
to madness with an amazing as
sortment of sinfully rich torts,
cheesecakes and other chocolate
delights. Indulge! But be sure to
enjoy your dessert with a Sausalito
EANAB. Cold beverages at the
Trieste can be an adventure. Test
your bohemian factor with an Iced
Espresso or an Iced Cappuccino.
Tiry an orangina (Italy's superior
ancestor to the Orange Julius). Or
dare your palate to appreciate the
incredible taste of a New York Egg
Cream.
