last in a weekly series

But you're not shopping for
yachts, so you walk into a well
lighted shop along the main street
that sells glass knick-knacks and
windchimes. You overhear a nat
tily dressed "sales pair" (a man
and a woman) describing the su
perior workmanship and quality of
a soldered brass kaleidoscope,
while a middle-aged married cou
ple examines the instrument.
"It's from France," the salesman
says (pronounced FRAHNCE),
"and it's truly a fine piece of work."
"I'm sure it is," says the balding
customer. "But my wife and I just
spent $750 down the street on two
of these."
"Well," the salesman smiles and
states the obvious, "you'll just have
to take them back and get one

good one."
If you've imagined wealthy
streets free of street people, and
auaint little shops that ask big,
dirty dollars for heavy dust
gathering objects, you've got only
a caricatured picture of Sausalito,
a quiet community nestled in a
nook of Marin County. Just across
the Golden Gate Bridge from San
Francisco, Sausalito boasts stun

boats and the bay.
The postcard-perfect images and
panoramic perspectives of
Sausalito are some of the town's
most attractive attributes. And
what's more, they're free. I can't
think of a more relaxing way for
students with a limited budget to
spend an afternoon than to pack
a delicious picnic lunch, take the
beautiful skyline highway (Hwy.
35) up the coast, cross the stun
ning Golden Gate and stake out
a shady spot on the lush grass
beneath the huge weeping willows
growing beside the peaceful bay in
sunny Sausalito.
But if you'd rather spend a few
dollars and avoid all those sappy
adjectives, you can find some great
food at incredibly reasonable
prices, even by Palo Alto standards.
A great place to go for burgers with
true California flavor is Zack's on
Bridgeway Avenue (the main street
through the town).
The outdoor dining area at
Zack's overlooks the Sausalito
piers and the quiet waters of the
bay. The restaurant management
has posted signs, "Absolutely do
not feed the birds," which seem
to have worked. Neither the
seagulls nor the pigeons expect to
