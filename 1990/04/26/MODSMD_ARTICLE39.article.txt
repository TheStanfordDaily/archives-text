# You might as well go all the way and get your feet wet

It is midnight. Our lights aren't
on. The moon is in the clouds.
There arc no city lights to il
luminate the way ; we arc 20 feet
under and going deeper. In short,
wc are in a»black void.
Yet, in this blackness there is
life. As my dive buddy continues
downward, his motion excites
bioluminescent life in the water.
The result: a ghostlike figure drift
ing toward the bottom with a trail
of brilliant matter raining down
after him.
A dim glow comes from my
depth gauge. The needle is now at
30 feet and moving steadily on its
way to 40. Besides an emptiness
of light, there is an emptiness of
sound. All that I can hear are the
bubbles from my regulator and
from my partner's.
On the one hand, I am experi
encing sensory deprivation, on the
other, I am entering sensory over
load. I begin to feel the cold water
seep through my wctsuit. I am
acutely aware of the regulator in
my mouth, the energy it takes to
get each breath. My gauge now
reads 55 feet, I feel the kelp wrap
around my arm as I drift into a
large stalk in the kelp forest I
relax and the kelp unfolds as gently
as it entangled itself.
We continue drifting down and
I am becoming a bit concerned
that we were off on our calculation
of bottom depth and may be awash
in the middle of the Monterey Can
yon. My worries arc soon put to
rest as my fins hit the bottom.
Touchdown. I look at my depth
gauge, which reads 85 feet. Al

though diving in the dark can be
exciting, I decide that it would be
most prudent to turn on my light
From the black vastness emerges
a playground of color. Directly in
front of us is a wall of rocks about
15 feet high. It is covered with
brightly colored red and orange
anemones. Attached to the top of
the rocks are the roots to the kelp
stalks, dozens upon dozens of
them. We swim up the rock forma
tion and into the kelp forest. Ef
fortlessly we weave our way
between the kelp. I think it is this
very kelp — this underwater forest
that mimics die above water splen
dor of the surrounding Point Lobos
area — that places Monterey
among my favorite dive spots.
There is no doubt that the
crystal-clear 80-dcgrec warm water
ot the Caribbean has its advantages
over the often murky and some
times bloody well freezing water
off our coast. In the Caribbean one
is afforded the opportunity to
cruise countlcss reefs abundant
with coral and fish. Each reef is
an ccosystcm all to itself, filled
with countlcss varieties of sponges,
sea fans, small tropical fish and a
moray eel or two.
However, the ecosystem in Mon
terey, though different, is no less
alive. As we continue our journey
through the forest, we find count
less crabs, sea snails, anemones,
fish and even a little octopus. As
wc move in close on a small rock
we find a small decorator crab with
a whole host of life attached to it.
A little anemone has even grown
