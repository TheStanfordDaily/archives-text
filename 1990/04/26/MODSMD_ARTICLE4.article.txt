# Campus water rationing likely
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Empty fountains, browner lawns and
shorter showers await Stanford stu
dents beginning May 8 if the San Fran
cisco Public Utilities Commission gives
final approval to a rationing program
aimed at reducing water usage by 25
percent.
John Mullane, acting general mana
ger of the San Francisco Water Depart
ment, said the commission will most
likely vote in favor of the program,
which was given preliminary approval
Tuesday.
The rationing will affect "the vast
majority of the Peninsula," according
to Mullane. San Francisco and Penin
sula communities, such as Stanford,
that purchase their water from San
Francisco will have to comply with the
rationing or pay an excessive-use
charge.
"The water supply is terrible," Mul
lane said, adding that the water short
age "is one of the worst in 70 years."

He said the water department is ex
pecting 60,000 acre-feet of runoff this
season, while a typical rainy season
usually results in 760,000 acre-feet.
"The runoff in *87, '88, '89 and this
part of '90 totals only 536,000," Mullane
added.
Eighty-five percent of San Francisco's
water supply comes from the Hetch
Hetchy Reservoir, which is currently at
less than half its normal level.
For Stanford, the water shortage
means "we'd certainly better behave,"
said Cheryl Jensen, a manager at Op
erations and Maintenance.
The last time Stanford and major
parts of the Peninsula faced water
rationing was in 1988. Jensen said the
University did "very well" in handling
the shortage, from reducing water use
to installing more efficient irrigation
systems.
"Right now I don't think it will be a
big problem because we were successful
in 1988," she said, adding that she hopes
"people have not returned to bad
habits" since then.

"The fountains around campus will
probably be allowed to dry up since
they're more for appearance," Jensen
explained. In addition, "some of the
lawns will be allowed to go brownish"
and some grass will be replaced by
ground cover, which uses less water.
Mullane said the rationing will last
about one year, depending on rainfall
totals. "We have enough water for this
year, but we're looking for next year,"
he said.
Mullane said torrential rains in March
of last year "put us over the hump" in
terms of water supply. This year, San
Francisco has a better storage system
than in 1988, but the runoff levels are
much lower.
The introduction of the rationing
comes in the wake of a "sabotage" last
night of several sorority rush tents on
Wilbur Field, according to grounds man
ager Herb Fong.
Fong said "several fraternity boys"
cut the lock on the sprinkler system's
controller, drenching several sorority ac
tives and rushees.
