## Folksy 'MacDougal Blues' Kinney and Buck talk about their newest release 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
In an age of major record deals
and exorbitant publicity cam
paigns, is it still possible to create
a low-budget, high-quality
record?
Kevn Kinney certainly believes
so. The lead singer of Drivin'
and Cryin' enlisted the help of
Peter Buck, guitarist of R.E.M.,
to produce his new album, "Mac-
Dougal Blues." Together, the pair
has created a warm collection of
10 folk songs.
With "MacDougal Blues," Kin

ney and Buck are both operating
in unfamiliar territory. The
Dylan-like vocal and guitar style
of Kinney is a far cry from his
original band's "metal
bohemian" sound. As part of one
of college rock's most prominent
foursomes, Buck is trying to
make waves as a producer.
But Kinney's final product is
an earthy folk success. Tracks
range from the bluesy title cut
to the fast-paced "The House
Above Tina's Grocery" to the
country "Lost and Found."
Sometimes, the clear, simple
musical style reveals a wispy

weakness in Kinney's vocals. Yet
the overall strength and imagery
of "MacDougal Blues" proves
that Kinney, described by Rolling
Stone as "the most rooted
musician of his generation," is
deserving of such praise.

Intermission: How did you
originally meet?
Peter Buck: A mutual friend
of ours dragged me to a Drivin'
and Cryin' show in 1985. I
thought that Kevn sounded like
a cross between Merle Haggard,
Led Zeppelin and Neil Young,
but in a very personal way. I also
liked the songs, and so after the
show, we hung out and talked
about working together.
I: Why is "MacDougal Blues"
more of a folk record than a
Drivin' and Cryin' album?
Kevn Kinney: I have always
liked to sing folk music. It's
easier to hear yourself sing, and
it gives the lyrics a more intimate
atmosphere. Plus, I just like to
be challenged.

I: Throughout the album, you
use the imagery of working-class
America to portray feelings of
despair.
KK: I came from a blue-collar
town in the late 19705, when
lots of places closed and lots of
workers were laid off. I wanted
this album to show this element
of working class despair so that
people realize that things aren't
always going to be as good as
they are. Ronald Reagan made
the U.S. coexist side by side with
the Brady Bunch. But I just can't
stop thinking about what hap
pens when the bottom falls out.
I: What is it like on the pro
duction side of an album?
Peter Buck: All of the stuff
that we do on the side of R.E.M.
ultimately helps the band. Mike
[Mills) did a couple soundtracks
and work with KRS-One, and he
brought back some tips to our
own band. I still would rather

play than produce, though.
We may receive some criticism
because it might look like Kevn
is just trying to capitalize off of
R.E.M.'s success. But I work with
my friends, people I respect. I
think Kevn is in a category of
his own.
I: Did Peter Buck's production
have too much of an R.E.M. in
fluence on this album?
KK: Drivin' and Cryin' and
R.E.M. have always been such
close friends that we end up in
fluencing each other. There are
lots of things that we both like,
and since influence is such a
subtle thing, it shows on both
sides. I think Peter's help gave
this album integrity as well as
business sense.
I: So what's in the future for
the two of you?
PB: I don't know if there will
be a lot of time for projects like
this in the future.
