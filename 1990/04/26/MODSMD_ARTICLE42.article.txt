## Folksy 'MacDougal Blues' Kinney and Buck talk about their newest release 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
In an age of major record deals
and exorbitant publicity cam
paigns, is it still possible to create
a low-budget, high-quality
record?
Kevn Kinney certainly believes
so. The lead singer of Drivin'
and Cryin' enlisted the help of
Peter Buck, guitarist of R.E.M.,
to produce his new album, "Mac-
Dougal Blues." Together, the pair
has created a warm collection of
10 folk songs.
With "MacDougal Blues," Kin

ney and Buck are both operating
in unfamiliar territory. The
Dylan-like vocal and guitar style
of Kinney is a far cry from his
original band's "metal
bohemian" sound. As part of one
of college rock's most prominent
foursomes, Buck is trying to
make waves as a producer.
But Kinney's final product is
an earthy folk success. Tracks
range from the bluesy title cut
to the fast-paced "The House
Above Tina's Grocery" to the
country "Lost and Found."
Sometimes, the clear, simple
musical style reveals a wispy

weakness in Kinney's vocals. Yet
the overall strength and imagery
of "MacDougal Blues" proves
that Kinney, described by Rolling
Stone as "the most rooted
musician of his generation," is
deserving of such praise.
