# Nitzer Ebb will fill your ears

Aural pain.
Frenzied shouting and scream
ing. The sound of chains whipping
against metal posts, to a strangely
danceable rhythm. Heavy
machinery-sounding percussion.
And a dissonant synthesizer-on
the-fritz, spewing out the sounds
of a post-apocalyptic industrial
nightmare.

This roughly describes the music
of the British duo called Nitzer
Ebb (pronounced "night-zer ebb"),
composed of vocalist Douglas Mc-
Carthy and vocalist/percussionist
Bon Harris. Their new album,
"Showtime," is a collection of in
stantly mesmerizing songs of
urban decay and confusion.
The lyrics focus on stark images
of grime and filth, of human strife
and degeneracy — the lowest side
of city living. Appropriately
enough, McCarthy's vocals are
shouted, occasionally at the top of
his lungs. Key phrases are repeated
for effect, in tandem with the se
quenced keyboard noises. Nitzer
Ebb does not win any awards for
subtlety, but somehow the music
escapes utter insipidness, and then
some.
At least at first, the instrumental
work in the songs on "Showtime"
does not seem much more than
elaborately sequenced, rhythmic
noises, but upon repeated listen
ings, varied and interesting influ
ences become apparent. The first
song on the album, "Getting
Closer," is actually a pretty decent
dance tune.
Like the other songs, the
rhythms are industrial, but with a
hint of, yes, disco and techno-pop.
The synthesized bass line is dis

torted and rough-edged, and seems
to owe some of its atonality to
Depeche Mode. The song "Nobody
Knows" is about as musically clas
sifiable as Nitzer Ebb gets; mec
hanized rhythm and blues is
combined with a groaning syn
thesizer, and the incredible vocal
angst a la Love and Rockets makes
it all work.
The remarkable keyboard work
throughout the album is very
Kraftwerkian; this is in one sense
surprising and yet in another
elementary. Nitzer Ebb is a no
nonsense, hard core techno-band,
while Kraftwerk revels in the glory
of technology and computers. But
both use the sounds of technology

and industry in similar ways, if in
very different spirits. Fans of
Depeche Mode and Kraftwerk
would probably enjoy "Showtime."
Tne strange, hypnotic attraction
that this music holds for the lis
tener is hard to pinpoint. It would
be much easier to make a list of
reasons why this should not be
enjoyable listening. It is definitely
not musical or melodic. And it is
too rhythmically complex to be
catchy, at least not in any sense
that we are accustomed to.
But in Nitzer Ebb's favor, the
rhythms are insidiously compel
ling. At the very least, this music
is very good, highly industrial
dance music.
