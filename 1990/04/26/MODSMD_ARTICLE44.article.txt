# Jackson promises to bring some serious rhythm to Shoreline

The headlines have been touting her for
a month now: "Janet Jackson in Control,"
"Jackson Puts 'Rhythm' Into 'Nation',"
"Janet Jackson 'Alright' on First Tour." In
case you haven't heard, Michael's sister
is bringing her high-energy "Rhythm Na
tion 1814 Tour" to the Oakland Coliseum
on April 28 and 29.
For those of you lucky enough to have
tickets (scalped seats are still available for
$550), you will witness a show featuring
a spectacular array of special effects,
choreographed dance moves and, yes, even
vocal proficiency.
Jackson has garnered rave reviews this
year for her recent album, "Rhythm Na

tion 1814" (1814 is the year the national
anthem was written). The compilation is
a steady stream of social commentary,
love ballads and nonstop funk rhythms.
Jumping on the social conscience band
wagon, Jackson addresses poverty, home
lessness, drugs and inner-city violence.
However, what sets her apart from the
insipidness of her peers is her committ
ment to hopeful, if not sunny, lyrics.
While many artists address current issues
in monotonous, depressing ballads, Jack
son matches a funk-laden beat to her
ideas. Most fans will agree that Jackson
can sing about whatever she wants, as
long as they can dance to it.
Jackson rehearsed for three months
before debuting her first-ever show in
Miami four weeks ago. Critics bashed her

for being visibly frightened, weak-sounding
and preoccupied with special effects (there
are several explosions, smoke bombs and
fireworks displayed on the industrial-like
steel set).
Since then, however, the show has been
rearranged and the volume of the band
toned down to allow Jackson's voice to
be heard more clearly. The effects and
choreography are still intact, but no one
can blame her for being scared or over
powered by her surroundings any more.
The "Rhythm Nation" show begins with
a famous voiceover by Jackson: "This is
a story about control. Control of what I
say, control of what I do ... And this
time I'm gonna do it my way." Through
the smoke and flashing strobe lights, a
huge box appears, rising above the nine

piece backup band. In an instant, it bursts
open to reveal Jackson's silhouette in a
striking pose.
As the music starts, the fancy footwork
kicks in, and Jackson rarely lets up in the
16-song, 90-minute set. Aside from her
band, she is backed by The Nation, a
14-member ethnically diverse dance en
semble which is featured in almost all her
videos.
The strength of the show lies in the
crisp choreography, which remarkably has
little effect on Jackson's vocal perform
ance. The dance anthems that Jackson is
famous for are performed alongside moves
only seen in her MTV clips. The epilogue
to the "Miss You Much" video, which
features a spectacular interaction of dan
cers and chairs, is enacted in the concert

with adept precision.
Her cover of songs from the "Control"
album sound even better than the original
recordings, for she has become a better
singer since her days of meek complaining
("What Have You Done For Me Lately?").
As the show progresses to more recent
material, lackson belts out a heavy metal
wailer ("Black Cat") and then slips right
back into an emotional ballad that show
cases her range ("Come Back to Me").
What makes Jackson such a great per
former, not just a mere "singer," is that
she makes everything she does look simple
and fun. Whirling through the strenuous
set, she never lets her audience know how
tiring it all must be â€” the smile is always
there, and the energy level never lets up.
