Dance Project, will present New York post
modern dancer and choreographer Douglas
Dunn in an afternoon of solo dancing and
discussion. The presentation (free of charge)
will take place at 3 p.m. Sunday in the
Roble Gym Dance Studio.
Dunn, a Palo Alto native, danced with

possibilities in dance, and that a foreground
ing of overall performance value over dance
value makes invention easier to ac
complish."
Dunn wants each aspect of a work —
choreography, music, costume, stage space
— to relate in a "suggestive correlation,"
rather than all say the same thing. This
extends to verbal language as well, although
