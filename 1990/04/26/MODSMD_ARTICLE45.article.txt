## Dunn lives it up with dance 
### Jill Antonides Staff writer 
The Stanford Dance Division, in col
laboration with San Francisco's Talking
Dance Project, will present New York post
modern dancer and choreographer Douglas
Dunn in an afternoon of solo dancing and
discussion. The presentation (free of charge)
will take place at 3 p.m. Sunday in the
Roble Gym Dance Studio.
Dunn, a Palo Alto native, danced with
Yvonne Rainer, Merce Cunningham and the
Grand Union before forming his own com
pany, Douglas Dunn and Dancers, in 1977.
Dunn has received grants from the Creative
Arts Public Service Program, the New York
State Council on the Arts, the National
Endowment for the Arts and the Guggen
heim Memorial Foundation.
Although he credits Merce Cunningham
as an important influence on his own atti
tude toward movement, Dunn describes his
work as "goofier and more eclectic." Indeed,
many dance critics attest to the difficulty
of discerning a particular style in Dunn's
work. In recent years Dunn has become
even harder to categorize, and he attributes

I was constantly testing
myself. But in the last few
years, I've allowed allusive
material into my work.

this in part to the emphasis he places on
various aspects of a work, such as music.
"Ten years ago, I used mainly silence, or
electronic scores, which all sound the same
to many people," Dunn says."I find now
that a wider variety of music expands the
possibilities in dance, and that a foreground
ing of overall performance value over dance
value makes invention easier to ac
complish."
Dunn wants each aspect of a work —
choreography, music, costume, stage space
— to relate in a "suggestive correlation,"
rather than all say the same thing. This
extends to verbal language as well, although

Dunn admits that integrating lan
guage with dance has been a slow
process. "In the past I used dance
as an alternative to talking. Now
I'm fighting to reintegrate language
into my work."
Dunn considers invention and
originality to be vital aspects of
his artistic development, and even
his attitude toward these aspects
has developed in the process of his
career. "When I started out, I
placed a tremendous value on orig
inality in creating steps," Dunn
says.
"That was good — I was con
stantly testing myself. But in the
last few years I've allowed allusive
material into my work. I'm no
longer preoccupied with making
each step an invention, but rather

with creating an original theatrical
atmosphere. But invention is still
important — modern dance is
about inventing the unfamiliar and
giving the audience something
new."
Dunn will perform a shortened
version of his solo, "Haole." Haole
is the Hawaiian word for "non-
Hawaiian," and in the perform
ance, Dunn takes on about 20
different characters. Dunn ex
plains, " 'Haole' is about 'Not Me.'
It's about bits of characters I yearn
to be but am not."
And the form of the solo, a jux
taposition of bits, parallels the
meaning. There is a slightly
distanced, allusive quality in the
dance. For example, Dunn takes
on the character of a court dancer,
but, as he explains, "I'm not being
a court dancer, but in 1990 I'm
looking back on how it would be,
with a 'wouldn't it be nice if . .
feeling to it."
