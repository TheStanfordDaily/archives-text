## 'Miami Blues' bores 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
Movies don't have to have a
point.
Although it's generally nice for
a movie to give a viewer some
sense that it nad a purpose, most
of us can enjoy a movie with no
real message or reason for being
whatsoever.
The recently released "Miami
Blues," however, suffers from an
utter lack of plot direction that
renders it unappealing on all levels
of consciousness, from intellectual
to base violence and sex.
Straining to reach the lowest
common denominator in the
slimepits of American moviegoers'
minds, "Miami Blues" has it all:
a hooker named Pepper, played by
Jennifer Jason Leigh, who you may
remember from her role as the girl
who really wanted to lose her vir
ginity in "Fast Times at Ridgemont
High" (what continuity in her

roles!)> an overweight, toothless,
bumbling cop, played by Fred Ward
of "The Adventure of Remo Wil
liams" and "Tremors" fame; and
a psychopath named Junior who
robs from those who rob and then
keeps it, played by "Hunt for Red
October" star Alec Baldwin.
Frankly, I'm embarrassed for
Baldwin. Not only does he "star"
opposite two meaiocre-at-best ac
tors, he is cast into such a terrible
role in such a bad movie that his
acting prowess in general is
tainted. I just hope he did this film
long before "The Hunt for Red Oc
tober."
What makes this flick so bad?
Maybe it's the use of "Friday the
13th" splatter scenes, like when

Alec Baldwin gets a chance to put the moves on Jennifer Jason
Leigh.
Junior's eyebrow is nearly removed
by shattered glass and someone
stitches it back on. Or maybe it's
another scene, where Junior gett
three of his fingertips hacked ofi
by a machete.
The big problem is that this
movie does not know where it's
going. The previews depict it as
some sort of action/comedy like
"Lethal Weapon"; however, there
was usually only one person in the
whole theater laughing, and he,
unfortunately, sat right next to me.
As far as action goes, it's all
fairly predictable. Halfway into the
movie, I was just hoping that they
would find some unique way to
end it. Needless to say, there were
no enterprising plot twists to con
clude this rag of a film.
