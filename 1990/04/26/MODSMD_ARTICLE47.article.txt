# Garbo's reign continues
## 
### Chris McKenna Staff writer 
The Ancient Greeks had their gods and
goddesses; the Middle Ages had their
saints. For the modern age, particularly
during the 1920s and '30s, the equivalent
object of worship and adoration held her
divine reign on the silver screen, and her
name was Greta Garbo.
Arguably the finest screen actress that
ever lived, Greta Garbo, or "Garbo" as
she insisted on being billed after 1927,
was like no other. She alone among the
women of her time became a legend. She
lived her earthly life rather conventionally
and was recognizably human, but as a
legend she swept out of ordinary life and
into celestial immortality, loved and
adored by thousands for no reason except
that in their eyes, she deserved their love
and adoration.
Last week, Garbo died. But while many
mourned her passing, an equal multitude
could only vaguely identify the name as
belonging to a famous actress from a
time long gone. With her death, a relic
was lost, reminding us just how pern"
nently distanced our generation is
an era of fedora hats and 40-cent mo,

Garbo represented a time when there
was a star system, a time when film
celebrities were seen as royalty, thought
of as spending carefree days lounging on
yachts and attending glamorous parties.
Garbo represented a time when a theater
was a palace, not a cement bunker at
the end of the mall.
But a time portal does exist, and it lies
on University Avenue. It's called the Stan
ford Theatre, and it is a movie palace.
Redefining the phrase "movie-going," the
Stanford Theatre experience promises to
be unlike any you've had before.
With gorgeously authentic architecture
and accessories, including a Wurlitzer or
gan played before and after every feature,
the theater allows you to see, hear and
live the Golden Age of Hollywood. The
theater bridges the gap of time and space
and, depending on the week, teleports its
patrons to any time between 1920 and
1955.
Right now the theater is featuring a
six-week Greta Garbo, Marx Brothers and
early Alfred Hitchcock film festival, of
fering some of the best dramatic and
comic performances ever captured on
film
