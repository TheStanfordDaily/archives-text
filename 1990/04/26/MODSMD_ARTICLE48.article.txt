# 'Lisa' dials a wrong number and dies
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
The best thing to be said about the
new thriller "Lisa" is that it plays like
a "Fatal Attraction" for the Debbie Gib
son crowd. It's a contrived, predictable
and ultimately vapid film with two re
spectable performances and a lot of un
intentional laughs.
Lisa (Staci Keanan) is a 14-year-old
walking hormone. She's at the age when
George Michael is the best thing since
John Travolta and padded bras are the
answer to social success. Every after
noon, after attending an all-girl Catholic
school, Lisa and her best friend Wendy
rip off their pleated skirts and don high
heels and matching tight dresses. They
proceed to stalk older yuppie men and
make prank, sexy phone calls.
The makers of this film seem to think
of all this as harmless pubescent fun —
at least until Lisa inadvertently dials the
number of a cute serial killer. The prem

ise is interesting, and director Gary Sher
man sets up a frightening, if slightly
implausible, situation.
The problem is that once the film
establishes its characters and story, it
turns into a slasher movie, the kind in
which people enter dark rooms without
bothering to turn the lights on.
Part of the movie's problem is its lack
of viciousness. As a PG-13 film clearly
aimed at a junior high school audience,
it's frustratingly bland and conventional.
Had Sherman stressed the relationship
between Lisa and her mother while using
the killer subplot to propel the story, the
film would have been a very effective
coming-of-age thriller (now there's a new
genre!). Instead, the madman-on-the
loose story trods along, eventually stomp
ing out the mother/daughter bond which

makes the first half so absorbing.
Cheryl Ladd, who bears an astounding
resemblance to Kim Basinger, has some
worthy scenes as Lisa's overprotective
mother. As the title character, Keanan
is especially convincing when she is
pitted against Ladd in several of their
domestic spats.
Lisa's adolescent awakening is gently
and skillfully handled by the
scriptwriters, and it is thoroughly believ
able until her hormones tap into some
thing much darker and deadly. Then,
when answering machines begin to
upstage the actors, "Lisa" becomes laugh
ably melodramatic. The denouement is
one big whimpering fest, with mother
and daughter cowering in the dark as a
deranged lunatic hunts them down.
This watered-down version of an adult
sexual thriller is bound to appeal to the
Maybelhne-and-braces bunch. But for the
slightly more serious moviegoer, "Lisa"
will pack about as much punch as an
ABC Thursday Afterschool Special.
