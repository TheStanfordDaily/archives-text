# Few respond to SCLC proposal
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
Although the one-month comment pe
riod on Law Prof. Tom Grey's proposed
interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is nearly over, the committee
that made the proposal has received
little response.
The proposed interpretation, released
by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council, would outlaw discriminatory
"fighting words" as a violation the Fun
damental Standard.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, an
ex officio member of the council, has
received only seven letters since April
4, when the 28-day review period began.
In addition, the SCLC will consider
editorials, columns and letters to The
Daily in its review of the interpretation.
The seven letters offer a variety of
comments and criticisms on the Grey
proposal. Six of the letters state or imply
opposition to the proposal, while one
approves of it, with a few reservations.
Cole speculated that so few comments
have been received because the "pros
and cons" of the issue "are pretty well
known." She added that she feels the
"relative silence" on the part of the
student body reflects "a sort of tacit
approval" of the Grey interpretation.
Grey agreed that the lack of debate

could be due to last
year's thorough discus
sion of the issues of free
speech and protection
from harassment. He
emphasized that the
changes he included in
the new proposal were
"very minor" and that
the original proposal
had "a lot of support
last spring."

Some students said the problem of
student silence on the issue is grounded
in the proposal itself. The two newly
elected members of the SCLC, freshmen
Mark Goldman and Joe Matal, ran on
a platform of free speech and First
Amendment protection.
According to Goldman, the proposal's
length and complexity turned off many
students who otherwise may have
responded more loudly against the Grey
interpretation, which he called "a big,
long thing with a lot of fine print."
Matal agreed that the proposal has
many qualifications and reservations
that have deflected student interest.
Despite its length, Grey's proposal
could nonetheless be summed up in one
simple sentence that every student could
understand: "You can't use the basic
epithets face to face," Grey explained.
He felt the rest of the proposal's speci

fications were necessary "to make bor
derline cases clear."
Cole said the current criticism rises
from a fear of "the chilling effect." Crit
ics are afraid that a ban on certain
types of speech might freeze campus
debate, she explained.
Cole countered this notion with her
belief that a "specific set of guidelines
will have a liberating effect on speech,
rather than a chilling effect. If people
know what the rules are, then they
needn't be concerned about inadvertent
violations."
She elaborated, saying it would be
impossible for students to violate Grey's
proposal accidentally. The sort of speech
it prohibits is by its very nature
deliberate, she explained.
But many of the letters Cole received
grounded their opposition to more than
just the "chilling effect" the proposal
could bring to campus discussion.
The longest letter, written by a third
year Law School student, objected that
the proposal treats students unequally,
suggesting that it would allow black
students to call each other "nigger" but
would prohibit the same type of speech
from whites.
The letter argued facetiously that the
word "racist" should be added to the
