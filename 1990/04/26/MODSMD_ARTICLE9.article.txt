# New groups support multiracial students
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Carl Hicks is half Korean, but he has never
been looked at as an Asian-American. He is
also half black, and his African-American her
itage is most visually prominent.
"People automatically assume I'm black —
when you look at me it's hard to tell," he
explained. "I'd tell people I was half and they
didn't seem interested."
Hicks has now found a forum in which he
can discuss his dual ethnicity with other
genuinely interested students. He is attending
two new closely linked Stanford support
groups — Spectrum, a group for students of
any biracial heritage, and Asian-Americans of
Multiracial Descent.
The two groups were created to provide a
support base for students who may have had
little or no interaction with other multiracial
students before attending Stanford. Their
meetings revolve around informal discussions
concerning emotions, experiences and
opinions.
The students have had a broad range of
experiences with their dual ethnicities. Stan
ford alumna Julie Lythcott, who organized
Spectrum, has a black father and a white
mother. She said when she went out with her
mother as a young girl, the two were treated
well; when she went out with her father, they
were shunned.
By contrast, Asian-Americans of Multiracial
Descent was formed to support the special
experiences of half-Asians, said sophomore
Shari Epstein, who coordinates that group.
Though closely tied to Spectrum, the group
maintains its autonomy as a forum for the
Asian students' unique stories, she said.
The students in the two groups said they
have found that all multiracial students have
a lot in common and much to discuss.

A hint of bitterness touches Hicks' voice as
he repeats the oft-quoted line from people
who have just learned he is half Asian: "Oh,
yeah, I can kind of see it in your eyes."
Hicks' mother was born in Korea; his father
was born in the United States and later moved

to Okinawa, where the two met.
Hicks and his family do not maintain many
traditional Korean activities — in fact, he said
he's not sure what real traditional Korean
activities are — but he has noticed that
"people don't eat rice every day like I did."
He said he and his family take off their shoes
when entering the house and that he greatly
respects his father, but that is the extent of
the traditions they keep.
For many years, Hicks did not acknowledge
his Korean half, and "that was very hard for
me." At one point in his Stanford career, he
said, he even ignored his black heritage in an
effort to assimilate into the "mainstream"
University group.
Hicks finally came to grips with his ethnic
duality during resident assistant training this
summer. At one activity, RAs were placed in
their own ethnic groups. Hicks sat in the
"mixed" group and discovered a common bond
with other multiracial RAs.
Since then, Hicks has publicized his heritage
to his friends. He said, "I've grown to accept
people as who they are."

Lisa Mar laughed when she related her
complex background. Her father is Chinese,
while her mother is a mixture of English and
"Jewish from Eastern Europe along the
Polish-Russian border." Her experience at
home was a combination of Chinese and Amer
ican influences, as well as Canadian, since her
parents grew up in Canada.
She said her Chinese grandmother — who
until Mar was 12 stayed with the family six
months a year — was the one who was most
faithful to Chinese culture. "She kept many
more traditions than the rest of us — she
did it all," Mar said. "She gave us a strong
sense of family."
When she was younger, Mar didn't see any
contradiction between her two ethnicities. But
during junior high school, she realized it was
more socially acceptable to act white, and she
told herself, "I can pass for white."
One day during eighth grade, she encoun
tered a pivotal moment. She simply walked
in front of a mirror, looked at herself and
said, "You are Chinese.

"It was the first painful realization" of her
Chinese ancestry, Mar said. "I'd chosen with
out thinking to hide it."
In her California high school, which was
half composed of ethnic minorities, her dual
heritage "wasn't an issue," but it resurfaced
when she came to Stanford. "Anybody, when
going away from home, begins to realize who
they are," Mar said.
One day during her freshman year, she met
a full-blooded Chinese woman who said Mar
wasn't really Chinese. "Are they right? Am I
not Chinese enough?" Mar questioned herself.
But later that year, she realized she had
shut out part of herself and that she is
"Chinese enough." Now, she said, she couldn't
let her Chinese heritage go "even if I wanted
to."

"I always thought it was really neat,"
Epstein-said of her Chinese-Jewish heritage.
A Northern California native, she has had a
"pretty well-blended" ethnic experience at
home, where both her parents speak Chinese
as well as English.
Her father is Jewish by heritage, but the
family practices Buddhism. She said the two
sides of her family are close — they celebrate
traditional Chinese holidays but also pursue
Jewish activities, such as Friday night seders.
However, Epstein said, "There is definitely
a cultural gap."
When her family stayed in Taiwan for a
few years when she was younger, she could
picture "girl" and "boy" but could not re
member the English words. "I'd forgotten how
to speak English," she said. But after her
return to the United States, she soon forgot
much of her Chinese.
Epstein urges students of dual ethnicities
to "be a bridge between East and West."
"There's a certain way you act with both
sides of the family," she said.
"With the Caucasian side, relatives will see
each other and say 'Ooooh' and give each
other a big hug." But the Chinese side is
much more traditional, she said. When her
mother was first reunited with her aunt after
10 years, they simply said, "Hello."
