# Keep out: ASSU files, meetings kept under wraps
## 
### Eric Young Burke Smith Senior staff writers 
Next to the financial files in
the ASSU office is a memo that
reads: "Students who do not
belong to the Financial Manager's
Office staff are not permitted free
access to organization files. ... To
permit individual students or
Daily reporters free access to or
ganization files constitutes a
breach of confidentiality."
That memo, written by ASSU
Senate Chair Ed Sasaki and
posted April 12, reflects one ASSU
policy on student access to gov
ernment expenditure information.
It also reflects a wider sentiment
at the ASSU â€” that student gov
ernment does not have to provide
the full accountability to its con
stituency that is required of local,
state and federal government
agencies.
Students are not guaranteed

access to any ASSU financial or
policy records, and they can be
shut out of ASSU meetings at any
time by a two-thirds vote of the
full senate or a senate committee.
And because it does not freely
release information about spend
ing by campus organizations, the
ASSU directly violates a binding
agreement made with the Univer
sity eight years ago.
University President Donald
Kennedy wrote in 1982 that his
approval of fee assessment re
forms was with the understanding
"that there will be a full and open
accounting to students of how the
respective boards allocated the
funds (to what organizations, in
what amounts and for what pur
poses); and how the funds were
actually spent."
The ASSU Senate that year ac
cepted Kennedy's letter as being
"as binding as the text of the
amendments themselves."
"They've got to give you an ac

counting," Kennedy said last
week.
Asst. Communication Prof.
Jeremy Cohen agreed, saying, "If
we operate at all on the principle
that those in government repre
sent the constituents that elect
them, then they have no business
operating in private."
Cohen, an expert on the First
Amendment and the role of the
media as a government watchdog,
said using the University's private
status to refuse the public full
access to its records "denies every
thing that a university is sup
posed to stand for."
Denied access
Because the ASSU is a private
institution, it is not required to
abide by federal and state laws
that provide more access to infor
mation and governmental
decision-making.
