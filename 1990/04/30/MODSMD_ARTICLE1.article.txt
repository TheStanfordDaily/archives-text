# Keep out: ASSU files, meetings kept under wraps
## 
### Eric Young Burke Smith Senior staff writers 
Next to the financial files in
the ASSU office is a memo that
reads: "Students who do not
belong to the Financial Manager's
Office staff are not permitted free
access to organization files. ... To
permit individual students or
Daily reporters free access to or
ganization files constitutes a
breach of confidentiality."
That memo, written by ASSU
Senate Chair Ed Sasaki and
posted April 12, reflects one ASSU
policy on student access to gov
ernment expenditure information.
It also reflects a wider sentiment
at the ASSU — that student gov
ernment does not have to provide
the full accountability to its con
stituency that is required of local,
state and federal government
agencies.
Students are not guaranteed

access to any ASSU financial or
policy records, and they can be
shut out of ASSU meetings at any
time by a two-thirds vote of the
full senate or a senate committee.
And because it does not freely
release information about spend
ing by campus organizations, the
ASSU directly violates a binding
agreement made with the Univer
sity eight years ago.
University President Donald
Kennedy wrote in 1982 that his
approval of fee assessment re
forms was with the understanding
"that there will be a full and open
accounting to students of how the
respective boards allocated the
funds (to what organizations, in
what amounts and for what pur
poses); and how the funds were
actually spent."
The ASSU Senate that year ac
cepted Kennedy's letter as being
"as binding as the text of the
amendments themselves."
"They've got to give you an ac

counting," Kennedy said last
week.
Asst. Communication Prof.
Jeremy Cohen agreed, saying, "If
we operate at all on the principle
that those in government repre
sent the constituents that elect
them, then they have no business
operating in private."
Cohen, an expert on the First
Amendment and the role of the
media as a government watchdog,
said using the University's private
status to refuse the public full
access to its records "denies every
thing that a university is sup
posed to stand for."
Denied access
Because the ASSU is a private
institution, it is not required to
abide by federal and state laws
that provide more access to infor
mation and governmental
decision-making.
In the past few weeks, Daily
reporters and other students have
found it difficult to get — or have
been refused access to — records
dealing with government expendi
tures.
Last quarter Daryl Joseffer, a
reporter for The Stanford Review,
was looking into allegations he
learned of about irregularities on
a signature card for SALSA, a
campus Latino group. Claiming
his right to see government files,
Joseffer asked an ASSU assistant
financial manager to get a
photocopy of the signature card.
The card, which identifies who
is allowed to use the group's
funds, was altered two years ago,
so it contained a signature of
someone who was not a member
of the organization. That incident
touched off a University investi
gation into the wrongdoing, but
as yet the incident has not been
reported in the press.
Joseffer was told to come back
on two separate occasions; he said
when he finally saw a copy of the
signature card, he was not allowed
to photocopy it.
In another example, after the
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office last May
15, longtime ASSU politico
Leonard Adler found out through
an ASSU business project mana
ger that the Council of Presidents
had spent government money to
assist the Agenda for Action, the
political coalition that organized
the takeover. Adler forwarded
photocopies of some documents to
The Daily, and the subsequent ar
ticle in The Daily was a political
embarrassment for the People's
Platform COP.
David Porter, last year's senate
chair, said he and other ASSU
leaders spoke with Sally Cole, the
University's judicial affairs offi

cer, about whether it would be
possible to file Fundamental
Standard charges against Adler
for acting as a whistle-blower.
Adler was never charged. "At
that point it wasn't worth the
hassle," Porter said.
Financial manager control
The ASSU Constitution states
that the financial manager "shall
ensure that all expenditures of
funds from the Association, its
agencies or the Students' Organ
izations Fund, are duly author
ized and documented and within
the purpose, function and budget
of the specific agency or organi
zation."
According to the financial man
ager's handbook, anyone inter
ested in seeing financial files must
first obtain consent from the or
ganization whose files will be ex
amined. The files can be reviewed
with representatives of that stu
dent group, with ASSU financial
manager Sandra Leal or with a
financial office secretary.
Leal said such precautions are
necessary to guard against tam
pering with files and because her
office does not have sufficient
time or resources to make copies
of paperwork.
Sasaki acknowledged there is a
problem with concentrating so
much oversight power in the
hands of ASSU officials.
"In my opinion it seems like
you should have freer access,"
Sasaki said. He said if the issue
proves to be a problem, "then we'll
look into it."
Lost files
Even if students had direct
access to files, the ASSU might
have trouble locating the desired
paperwork.
Sasaki said ASSU papers gen
erally are not well-organized,
which "is part of the perpetual
problem of having students in the
office." He said that although he
is a stickler for organizing, he in

herited the filing problems from
previous years of neglect.
Past senate decisions can dis
appear in the confusion over
where records are kept. When
questioned about a senate policy
concerning who had access to fi
nancial files, Sasaki said, "the
papers are all over and I would
have to find it.. . . The records
are kind of a mess."
"Lost" senate decisions are
nothing new, said Porter, now a
graduate student at Harvard Uni
versity. Unfortunately, documents
dealing with non-recurring issues
can get lost, Porter said. In such
a case "the senate chair comes up
and enacts another policy." There
is "no such creature with perfect
institutional memory," he ex
plained.
Disorganized or missing files in
terfere with attempts to examine
past senate actions. Robin Peter
sen, the ASSU Senate secretary,
said the office did not have com
plete records of this year's senate
meetings.
Closed meeting
The problem of closed records
is exacerbated by the fact that
reporters and other students have
been excluded from decision
making sessions among elected of
ficials. One example involves an
emergency committee meeting
called last month to discuss con
troversial legislation involving
ASSU election violations.
Solina Kwan, ASSU senator and
chair of the Joint Student Affairs
and Administration and Rules
Committee, called the meeting
before the regularly scheduled
senate meeting on March 6.
When Daily reporter Brent
Bigler arrived, Kwan told him the
meeting was closed. Stanford
Review reporter Joe Matal said,
"All the media was thrown out of
that meeting. ... I was kicked
out."
ASSU standing rules allow for
committee meetings to be closed

direct access to files,
the ASSU might have
trouble locating the
desired paperwork.

to non-members by a two-thirds
vote. However, committee mem
bers said there was no vote taken
at the meeting because it was
raucous and disorganized.
Although ASSU senators are
aware Bigler is the ASSU beat
reporter for The Daily, Kwan said
she was not aware of any
reporters wanting to cover the
meeting.
She also said it was a closed
meeting because the session dealt
partially with personnel issues
and litigation. The Bylaws allow
for meetings dealing with these
two subjects to be closed. But
senator Vince Ricci, a member of
the committee, said he did not
recall discussion on either of those
topics.
Douglas Bone, a senator who is
not a member of the committee,
said Kwan told him to leave the
meeting. The ASSU Standing
Rules of the Senate state that
committees "may not close any
meeting to members of the sen
ate." Kwan denied telling Bone to
leave.
Although the reporters spoke
with committee members about
the meeting, they could not look
at minutes because Kwan did not
file them. The Bylaws state that
"complete records of all actions
taken by a committee of the senate
during committee meetings shall
be made available to the senate."
Asked if not filing minutes was
a violation of the Bylaws, Kwan
said, "I think this [meetingl is a
special circumstance . . . and al
though minutes were not taken
at the meeting, before our terms
are out records of our acts will
be submitted to the senate."

Sasaki said. He said if the issue
proves to be a problem, "then we'll
look into it."
Lost files
Even if students had direct
access to files, the ASSU might
have trouble locating the desired
paperwork.
Sasaki said ASSU papers gen
erally are not well-organized,
which "is part of the perpetual
problem of having students in the
office." He said that although he
is a stickler for organizing, he in

herited the filing problems from
previous years of neglect.
Past senate decisions can dis
appear in the confusion over
where records are kept. When
questioned about a senate policy
concerning who had access to fi
nancial files, Sasaki said, "the
papers are all over and I would
have to find it.. . . The records
are kind of a mess."
"Lost" senate decisions are
nothing new, said Porter, now a
graduate student at Harvard Uni
versity. Unfortunately, documents
dealing with non-recurring issues
can get lost, Porter said. In such
a case "the senate chair comes up
and enacts another policy." There
is "no such creature with perfect
institutional memory," he ex
plained.
Disorganized or missing files in
terfere with attempts to examine
past senate actions. Robin Peter
sen, the ASSU Senate secretary,
said the office did not have com
plete records of this year's senate
meetings.
Closed meeting
The problem of closed records
is exacerbated by the fact that
reporters and other students have
been excluded from decision
making sessions among elected of
ficials. One example involves an
emergency committee meeting
called last month to discuss con
troversial legislation involving
ASSU election violations.
Solina Kwan, ASSU senator and
chair of the Joint Student Affairs
and Administration and Rules
Committee, called the meeting
before the regularly scheduled
senate meeting on March 6.
When Daily reporter Brent
Bigler arrived, Kwan told him the
meeting was closed. Stanford
Review reporter Joe Matal said,
"All the media was thrown out of
that meeting. ... I was kicked
out."

to non-members by a two-thirds
vote. However, committee mem
bers said there was no vote taken
at the meeting because it was
raucous and disorganized.
Although ASSU senators are
aware Bigler is the ASSU beat
reporter for The Daily, Kwan said
she was not aware of any
reporters wanting to cover the
meeting.
She also said it was a closed
meeting because the session dealt
partially with personnel issues
and litigation. The Bylaws allow
for meetings dealing with these
two subjects to be closed. But
senator Vince Ricci, a member of
the committee, said he did not
recall discussion on either of those
topics.
Douglas Bone, a senator who is
not a member of the committee,
said Kwan told him to leave the
meeting. The ASSU Standing
Rules of the Senate state that
committees "may not close any
meeting to members of the sen
ate." Kwan denied telling Bone to
leave.
Although the reporters spoke
with committee members about
the meeting, they could not look
at minutes because Kwan did not
file them. The Bylaws state that
"complete records of all actions
taken by a committee of the senate
during committee meetings shall
be made available to the senate."
Asked if not filing minutes was
a violation of the Bylaws, Kwan
said, "I think this [meetingl is a
special circumstance . . . and al
though minutes were not taken
at the meeting, before our terms
are out records of our acts will
be submitted to the senate."
Next to the financial files in
the ASSU office is a memo that
reads: "Students who do not
belong to the Financial Manager's
Office staff are not permitted free
access to organization files. ... To
permit individual students or
Daily reporters free access to or
ganization files constitutes a
breach of confidentiality."
That memo, written by ASSU
Senate Chair Ed Sasaki and
posted April 12, reflects one ASSU
policy on student access to gov
ernment expenditure information.
It also reflects a wider sentiment
at the ASSU — that student gov
ernment does not have to provide
the full accountability to its con
stituency that is required of local,
state and federal government
agencies.
Students are not guaranteed

access to any ASSU financial or
policy records, and they can be
shut out of ASSU meetings at any
time by a two-thirds vote of the
full senate or a senate committee.
And because it does not freely
release information about spend
ing by campus organizations, the
ASSU directly violates a binding
agreement made with the Univer
sity eight years ago.
University President Donald
Kennedy wrote in 1982 that his
approval of fee assessment re
forms was with the understanding
"that there will be a full and open
accounting to students of how the
respective boards allocated the
funds (to what organizations, in
what amounts and for what pur
poses); and how the funds were
actually spent."
The ASSU Senate that year ac
cepted Kennedy's letter as being
"as binding as the text of the
amendments themselves."
"They've got to give you an ac

counting," Kennedy said last
week.
Asst. Communication Prof.
Jeremy Cohen agreed, saying, "If
we operate at all on the principle
that those in government repre
sent the constituents that elect
them, then they have no business
operating in private."
Cohen, an expert on the First
Amendment and the role of the
media as a government watchdog,
said using the University's private
status to refuse the public full
access to its records "denies every
thing that a university is sup
posed to stand for."
Denied access
Because the ASSU is a private
institution, it is not required to
abide by federal and state laws
that provide more access to infor
mation and governmental
decision-making.
In the past few weeks, Daily
reporters and other students have
found it difficult to get — or have
been refused access to — records
dealing with government expendi
tures.
Last quarter Daryl Joseffer, a
reporter for The Stanford Review,
was looking into allegations he
learned of about irregularities on
a signature card for SALSA, a
campus Latino group. Claiming
his right to see government files,
Joseffer asked an ASSU assistant
financial manager to get a
photocopy of the signature card.
The card, which identifies who
is allowed to use the group's
funds, was altered two years ago,
so it contained a signature of
someone who was not a member
of the organization. That incident
touched off a University investi
gation into the wrongdoing, but
as yet the incident has not been
reported in the press.
Joseffer was told to come back
on two separate occasions; he said
when he finally saw a copy of the
signature card, he was not allowed
to photocopy it.
In another example, after the
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office last May
15, longtime ASSU politico
Leonard Adler found out through
an ASSU business project mana
ger that the Council of Presidents
had spent government money to
assist the Agenda for Action, the
political coalition that organized
the takeover. Adler forwarded
photocopies of some documents to
The Daily, and the subsequent ar
ticle in The Daily was a political
embarrassment for the People's
Platform COP.
David Porter, last year's senate
chair, said he and other ASSU
leaders spoke with Sally Cole, the
University's judicial affairs offi

cer, about whether it would be
possible to file Fundamental
Standard charges against Adler
for acting as a whistle-blower.
Adler was never charged. "At
that point it wasn't worth the
hassle," Porter said.
Financial manager control
The ASSU Constitution states
that the financial manager "shall
ensure that all expenditures of
funds from the Association, its
agencies or the Students' Organ
izations Fund, are duly author
ized and documented and within
the purpose, function and budget
of the specific agency or organi
zation."
According to the financial man
ager's handbook, anyone inter
ested in seeing financial files must
first obtain consent from the or
ganization whose files will be ex
amined. The files can be reviewed
with representatives of that stu
dent group, with ASSU financial
manager Sandra Leal or with a
financial office secretary.
Leal said such precautions are
necessary to guard against tam
pering with files and because her
office does not have sufficient
time or resources to make copies
of paperwork.
Sasaki acknowledged there is a
problem with concentrating so
much oversight power in the
hands of ASSU officials.
"In my opinion it seems like
you should have freer access,"
Sasaki said. He said if the issue
proves to be a problem, "then we'll
look into it."
