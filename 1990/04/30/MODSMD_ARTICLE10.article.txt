# Paying the census no heed
## Students sit down and avoid being counted 
### Marybelle Ang 
As census takers combed the campus count
ing students this month, they didn't spot
"Sue," a junior, who was living in her car in
a dormitory parking lot.
The student, who asked not to be identified
for fear she would get in trouble with the
University Housing Office, has since aban
doned her car and is now living with a friend.
But she said she still has not filled out a
census form.
Sue is one of those the census enumerators
have not yet found. But hundreds of other
students who live in campus dorms also have

still not filled out their census forms. The
U.S. Census Bureau reports that as of April
27, about 10 percent of Stanford students had
not yet submitted their forms, which were
distributed earlier in April.
Failure to complete and return the census
forms can result in a heavy fine. Freshman
Nick Sredanovic's remark that he "just hasn't
gotten around to it" is a typical reason for
late returns.
The census takers, who collect student
returns on a daily basis, are encountering
problems in locating students, said Jess
Hopple, manager of the Santa Clara District
Census Bureau Office. In addition, he empha-

sized the need for more census workers.
According to a statement by Larry Bryant,
information officer of the Regional Census
Coiter, "The census is everyone's opportunity
to help determine this nation's economic, po
litical and social direction for the rest of this
century."
The results of the census will help determine
representation in the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives and the availability of social-welfare
programs and private-sector development proj
ects for this area.

teering for the Census Bureau can call (408)
