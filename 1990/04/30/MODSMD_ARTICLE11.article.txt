# Newest sorority fails to reach pledge goal
## 
### Leland Lo 
After receiving only four
pledges, the Gamma Phi Beta
sorority is extending Rush and
is working hard to try to ap
pease the national sorority in
an attempt to keep its national
standing.
During formal spring Rush,
Gamma Phi Beta received only
one pledge, while three other
women pledged informally, said
Fiona Nelson, president of the
sorority. The goal for its new
pledge class was 26 women.
According to the guidelines
of the Intersorority Council, a
sorority that does not reach its
quota by the end of formal
Rush can continue to rush
women up to a chapter size of
80. Currently, 20 women belong
to the sorority.
She said sorority members
will continue to seek pledges
through informational meet
ings said word of mouth until
they reach their quota. Nelson
hopes that Gamma Phi Beta
will be able to reach the quota
by the end of the quarter.
If there are not enough
pledges, the sorority will be
faced with two options, said
Nelson.
The first would be to "go
alumnae." By taking alumnae
standing, the chapter would
still be recognized by the na
tional organization and carry
the Greek letters but would no
longer be able to vote at the
national meeting, according to
Nelson. The women would no
longer pay dues, and there

good we'll still be

would be no paperwork be
tween the local group and the
national organization, said Nel
son.
The second option is for the
current Gamma Phi Beta chap
ter to deactivate and join an
other sorority on campus. No
decision has been made on
either option, Nelson said,
since the sorority is still
seeking new pledges at this
point.
Fraternal affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes said he thinks
Gamma Phi Beta presents a
good opportunity for women
who seek leadership roles and
who wish to create their own
new traditions in an organiza
tion.
The newest sorority on
campus, Gamma Phi Beta was
founded by a group of 15
women in 1987. "Chances are
real good we'll still be here next
year," said Nelson, who added
that the possibility is "slim"
that the group would have to
deactivate or take alumnae
status.
According to Hughes, some
sororities are looking at a
shorter pledge process so that
women can become active
members more quickly than
they do now.
