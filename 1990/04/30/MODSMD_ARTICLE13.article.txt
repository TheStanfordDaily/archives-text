Bonn sets cash limits
EAST BERLIN (AP) — West German offi
cials closed the cash box yesterday and said
they would refuse to assume a bigger financial
burden to cushion East Germany's leap into
the free market.
Higher taxes could result if the government
of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl digs
any deeper to ease East Germany's transition
from a socialist system, officials said.
"Everyone must know that our offer is the
maximum of what we could accept," West Ger
many's finance minister, Theo Waigel, said in
an interview with the West German newspaper
Welt am Sonntag.
Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann
said in an interview in Bild am Sonntag that
any more financial concessions would endanger
the West German mark.
