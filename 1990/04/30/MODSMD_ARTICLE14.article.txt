# Hostage release expected

### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — A group
calling itself the Organization of Is
lamic Dawn announced yesterday it
will free American hostage Frank Reed
within 48 hours and said he will carry
a message for the U.S. government.
In Iran, a newspaper quoted an
Iranian official as also saying Reed's
release was expected by tomorrow
night after "extensive talks" between
the kidnappers and Iran.
The announcement from the previ
ously unknown Islamic Dawn group
was delivered to the independent
Beirut newspaper An-Nahar three
hours after an earlier unsigned com
munique said the U.S. educator —
held for more than 3Vfe years — will
be freed by tomorrow.
The later statement was accompa
nied by a black-and-white picture of
a bearded, smiling Reed to prove its
authenticity. It claimed responsibility
for the earlier statement, sent with
two other pictures to the independent
newspaper and a Western news agency.
Both statements were typewritten
in Arabic. The later one contained a
denial of news reports that the first
communique promising Reed's release
was signed by the Organization of
Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar
Moukhtar Brigade, a shadowy group
that had initially claimed Reed's ab
duction on Sept. 9, 1986.
The statements, which did not say
what the message to Washington
would contain, left President Bush and
Reed's relatives hopeful but cautious.
"I just won't say anything," Bush
said while golfing at Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington. "If
that proves to be true, that's wonder
ful."
In Iran, the Tehran Times quoted
the unidentified Iranian official as say
ing "extensive talks" were going on
between the kidnappers and Iran and
a release was expected by tomorrow
night.
The statements in Beirut were ac
companied by the first two photo
graphs of Reed to be released since he
was kidnapped and contained the first
news of Reed since his abduction.
The first communique was delivered
around 6:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. PDT),
meaning that Reed would presumably
be released by that time tomorrow.
