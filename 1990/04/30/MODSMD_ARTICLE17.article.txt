MOSCOW (AP) â€” East German
Prime Minister Lothar de Maziere said
after a meeting yesterday with Mikhail
Gorbachev that he failed to allay the
Soviet leader's concerns about a united
Germany's membership in NATO.
After the two-hour meeting in the
Kremlin, the Soviet news agency Tass
said the Soviet president "maintains
a negative attitude to the one-sided
imbalanced proposal for the inclusion
of the future united German govern
ment in NATO." It said it was
paraphrasing Gorbachev's remarks.

De Maziere said membership in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
was possible "if NATO develops a new
strategy."
Still, de Maziere said the meeting
was "very constructive" and would fa
cilitate German reunification.
De Maziere, accompanied by his
ministers of defense, foreign affairs
and economics, were in Moscow for a
day of talks preceding negotiations on
German reunification May 5 in Bonn,
West Germany.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard

Shevardnadze said in an interview
published Saturday in Ireland that a
united Germany should be non-aligned
and could belong to both the Western
alliance and the Warsaw Pact.
De Maziere has said he opposes Ger
man neutrality, and also stationing
NATO soldiers on East German ter
ritory until a new all-European secu
rity system can be arranged.
German neutrality "would be con
trary to the spirit of the times, cor
responding instead to the old mentality
of blocs."
