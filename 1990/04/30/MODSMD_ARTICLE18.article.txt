U.S. attorney investigated

tice Department is conducting an in
ternal inquiry into allegations of mis
conduct by the acting U.S. attorney
in Miami, whose office is prosecuting
Manuel Noriega, according to

Haitians incite riot
MIAMI (AP) - About 1,000
Haitians massed outside an alien
detention center yesterday, tearing
down a fence and calling on immi

gration officials to release their
countrymen.
A special riot control team of 79
Immigration and Naturalization
Service officers was deployed to hold
back the protesters as they crashed
through one gate and advanced on
another, said INS District Director
Richard Smith.
The protesters heeded warnings to
stop and no injuries or arrests were
reported at the Krome Service Proc
essing Center 25 miles west of Miami.
Diversions exposed
WASHINGTON (AP) - Congres
sional Iran-Contra investigators dis
covered but kept secret a diversion
to Israeli intelligence of more than
$1 million in proceeds from the
Reagan administration's sale of arms

to Iran, The New York Times Mag
azine reports.
The magazine, in an article by in
vestigative journalist Seymour
Hersh, also reports that senators
decided before the much-publicized
Iran-Contra hearings that they would
not "go after" President Reagan.
They agreed they would avoid
seeking impeachment unless it
seemed Reagan had been fully aware
of the diversion of arms sale money
to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the
article said.
The decisions were governed by a
desire to avoid jeopardizing the re
lease of U.S. hostages held in
Lebanon and to protect the emerging
strategic-arms negotiations with the
Soviet Union, as well as Reagan's age
and immense public popularity,
Hersh writes.

Playboy twins put on trial
MILWAUKEE (AP) - The life
style of an elderly businessman will
be explored as a former Playboy
model and her twin sister stand trial
on charges they failed to pay taxes
on more than $1 million they received
for sexual favors.
The twins allegedly spent alternate
nights with the man for more than
five years.
Jury selection begins Monday in
federal court for the trial of Lynnette
Harris, 35, a former model and
actress accused of accepting more
than $700,000 from a suburban Mil
waukee man who died last year at
age 89.
Her identical twin, Leigh Ann Con
ley, is to go on trial in June.
