The ASSU's policies on public
access to information are much
more restrictive than those of
government institutions in the
public sector.
Though not binding on
private institutions, state and
federal laws regulating govern
ment officials provide insight
into generally accepted prin
ciples of government.
In the state of California, the
Ralph M. Brown Act ensures the
right of citizens to know about
deliberations of and actions
taken by public officials.
"The people, in delegating au
thority, do not give their public

servants the right to decide
what is good for the people to
know and what is not good for
them to know,"the act reads.
"People insist upon remaining
informed so that they may
retain control over the agencies
which serve them."
Public officials are allowed to
discuss the hiring and firing of
non-appointed or elected offi
cials, labor negotiations, pend
ing litigation and a few other
exceptions to the act behind
closed doors.
The ASSU Bylaws give the
government far greater power
to close itself off. According to
the Bylaws, the ASSU Senate
should be closed during "elec
tion or removal of senate offi

cers; appointment, removal or
compensation of association of
ficers or personnel (except for
routine confirmation of appoint
ments); litigation; the negotia
tion of the operating budget
allowance; or the activities of
an Association business project
or business affiliate where
proprietary information is in
volved."
Unlike the Brown Act, the
Bylaws allow the senate to be
closed when discussing issues of
compensation for elected or ap
pointed officials. The Brown Act
makes a distinction between dis
cussing an individual's perform
ance or qualifications and
