# Other governments let more sunshine in

The ASSU's policies on public
access to information are much
more restrictive than those of
government institutions in the
public sector.
Though not binding on
private institutions, state and
federal laws regulating govern
ment officials provide insight
into generally accepted prin
ciples of government.
In the state of California, the
Ralph M. Brown Act ensures the
right of citizens to know about
deliberations of and actions
taken by public officials.
"The people, in delegating au
thority, do not give their public

servants the right to decide
what is good for the people to
know and what is not good for
them to know,"the act reads.
"People insist upon remaining
informed so that they may
retain control over the agencies
which serve them."
Public officials are allowed to
discuss the hiring and firing of
non-appointed or elected offi
cials, labor negotiations, pend
ing litigation and a few other
exceptions to the act behind
closed doors.
The ASSU Bylaws give the
government far greater power
to close itself off. According to
the Bylaws, the ASSU Senate
should be closed during "elec
tion or removal of senate offi

cers; appointment, removal or
compensation of association of
ficers or personnel (except for
routine confirmation of appoint
ments); litigation; the negotia
tion of the operating budget
allowance; or the activities of
an Association business project
or business affiliate where
proprietary information is in
volved."
Unlike the Brown Act, the
Bylaws allow the senate to be
closed when discussing issues of
compensation for elected or ap
pointed officials. The Brown Act
makes a distinction between dis
cussing an individual's perform
ance or qualifications and
discussing the pay a job receives.
In addition, the Bylaws allow
the senate and senate committees
to close themselves to the public
at any time with a two-thirds
majority vote.
According to Asst. Communica
tion Prof. Jeremy Cohen, officials
who close meetings often cite the
sensitivity of issues, but "most
'sensitive issues' turn out to be
embarrassing or confusing to
those in charge."
He also said particularly sensi
tive issues should be decided in
the open precisely because of their
sensitivity, adding, "You can't
have a dialogue" without deci
sions being made in an open en
vironment.
ASSU Senate Chair Ed Sasaki
said when meetings are closed, the
justification is usually that per
sonnel matters are being dis
cussed or people are being
"disruptive."
At the federal level, the 1966
Freedom of Information Act
opened to public scrutiny a vast
number of records kept by admin
istrative agencies of the federal
government.
According to journalist David
Morrissey of The Albuquerque
Journal, who is nationally recog
nized as an expert on the Freedom
of Information Act, the act
"simply guarantees you a regular
supply of accurate information"
and gives an "alternative to the

official view of things."
No parallel commitment to free
dom of information is contained
within ASSU Bylaws or Con
stitution.
The Freedom of Information
Act stipulates nine types of infor
mation that agencies can with
hold, many of which do not apply
to local government, including:
documents classified as confiden
tial for national security reasons,
personnel documents, trade
secrets and investigatory files
compiled for law enforcement
reasons.
Personnel documents, and per
haps trade secrets of ASSU busi
ness projects, are the only
documents found in the ASSU
files that fall into these protected
categories. Yet students are not
guaranteed easy access to any doc
uments in the ASSU.
Despite the breadth of excep
tions to the rule, the Freedom of
Information Act has been respon
sible for unearthing many ques
tionable government practices.
Through documents obtained
under the act, journalists and his
torians have learned that the
Central Intelligence Agency spied
on Martin Luther King Jr. and
that the CIA helped to overthrow
the Allende government in Chile.
Morrissey, who has filed more
than 500 Freedom of Information
Act requests, made many discov
eries using the law.
Morrissey said he has uncov
ered secret biological warfare tests
that were carried out in the 1950s
and "documents that said in 1957
the Air Force accidentally dropped
a nuclear bomb on New Mexico."
