## Never again 
### 
ASSU must clarify
Bylaws to prevent
future election confusion

ONE RESULT of all the
labyrinthine arguments sur
rounding the Council of
Presidents election is quite
straightforward:
This should not happen again.
Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss's decision to throw out 275
write-in votes was nothing more
nor less than what he said it was:
a broad interpretation of the ASSU
Bylaws.
While Krauss's decision has re
ceived a great deal of criticism from
those unhappy with the election
results, as well as from those con
cerned that the democratic process
was not upheld, the decision is not
the problem. The problem is the
large expanse of grey area the
Bylaws leave for the elections com
missioner to interpret.
The efforts of all those who have
come forward recently as advocates
of democratic student government
would be best spent ensuring that
we never have to relive the past
two weeks.
Now is the time to forge agree
ments for the future and make
explicit in the Bylaws what consti
tutes a legitimate "vote cast" and
what constitutes a legitimate
write-in vote.
Two guiding principles should be
upheld:
• In order for a vote to count as
a "vote cast," it must be for an
individual or a group of individ
uals, all of whom are registered
students and eligible to hold office,
and
• Students must reserve the
right to suggest an alternative to
the candidates on the ballot by
writing in what they consider a

better choice.
A simple procedural change
would clear up much of this year's
confusion: Those writing in a
Council of Presidents slate should
be required to list the individuals
who compose the write-in slate, in
addition to identifying the name
of the slate.
Doing so would remove all am
biguity surrounding whether an in
dividual is voting for cartoon
characters or voting for candidates
whose slate is named aflter cartoon
characters.
If the vote is for individuals such
as cartoon characters, who are not
students and not eligible to hold
office, it should be thrown out. If
the vote is for actual registered
students who are eligible to hold
office, it should be counted as a
"vote cast." Period.
As things stand now, Krauss's
interpretation of the Bylaws makes
it virtually impossible for students
to cast votes for COP slates not
appearing on the ballot. He argues
that, after the election, there is no
way of determining who students
are voting for when they write in
slate names such as the "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles."
Accordingly, he argues, since
there is no way of knowing if the
votes are for eligible students, any
such votes should not count toward
the "votes cast." Thus, in order
for any write-in slate to be consid
ered legitimate, the slate has to
make its members known prior to
the election — a requirement that
perverts the essence of write-in
votes.
Requiring voters to name indi
vidual slate members will make
this discrepancy irrelevant.
As elections commissioner,
Krauss should feel obligated to lead
the way in suggesting Bylaw revi
sions. But he needs and deserves
the support of all those who care
about the integrity of the ASSU
election process.
