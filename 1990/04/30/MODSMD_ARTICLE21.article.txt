Graduate housing proposal restricts equal access

I WAS INITIALLY in favor of the
idea, as proposed by the United
Graduate Student Alliance, of
multicultural programming for gradu
ate students by way of a theme house.
I was pleased that the Housing Center
decided on such short notice to imple
ment a scheme that meets the de
mands for multicultural activities.
After reading the letter from the
UGSA in The Daily, I have come to
realize that the UGSA's proposal is
simply a disguised attempt to secure
priority for minority groups to have
the best graduate student housing on
campus, namely the Rains Houses.
The main complaint of the UGSA
about the Housing Center's scheme is
that it "insists on the sanctity of the
draw." By demanding the ethnic mi
norities be put above the draw, the
UGSA is advancing its own self
interests at the expense of other gradu
ate students.
The draw is what ensures a fair

allocation of campus housing and gives
every graduate student (except first
years who are guaranteed housing) an
equal chance of getting his or her
choice of housing.
If it is not housing in Rains that
they are after, why insist that all
multicultural programming for gradu
ate students must take place at Rains?
Why not pick Manzanita Park?
Anyway, there is more reason to
have the decentralized system that the
housing authorities have proposed.
Surely the purpose of multicultural
education is not to segregate the mi
norities from other cultures on
campus. By not concentrating the
minorities in one location, they can
have both multicultural programming
as well as the opportunity to mix with
white American and foreign students.
The argument that ethnic minorities
have special needs is inappropriate in
this case, for there is another large

group of graduate students that has
more special need for housing and
programming than ethnic minorities:
foreign students.
Most foreign students are physically
indistinguishable from American mi
norities and suffer the same discrimi
nation as the minorities. In addition,
their unfamiliarity with American life,
their lack of command of the language,
their lack of political influence and the
absence of support groups in the
broader community render them espe
cially dependent on campus life to help
them cope.
Also, many foreign students cannot
afford to return home during vacations
while at Stanford, rendering their
isolation here even more intolerable.
If there is an argument for housing
priority for ethnic minorities, there is
an even stronger one for priority for
foreign students. Maybe we should
demand international theme houses at

Stanford, which many other univer
sities have. But the result will be that
every national and ethnic group on
campus will be housed separately from
each other, indulging in their own
cultures, but learning nothing about
others in the process.
Who are these UGSA people anyway?
They certainly don't represent the
interests of foreign graduate students.
As for unity, they seem bent on divid
ing the graduate student community
with their preposterous and self
serving proposals.
The student Housing Center and
residential deans must be congratulated
for maintaining the fairness of the
housing system. They have already
bent over backwards to accommodate
the demands of a vocal and un
representative group and should do no
more, or risk damaging the interests of
other graduate students.
