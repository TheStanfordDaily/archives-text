# Pro Fro Week gave students an overview of Stanford
## 
### 
As one of the three directors of Pro
spective Freshman Week, I was pleased
to see The Daily publish an article
touching upon last week's visit of over
800 high school seniors and their diffi
culty in making an informed college
decision. However, I and my co
directors felt the article misrepresented
Pro Fro Week and would like to clarify
the purpose of the week.
The article claimed pro fros "had no
real knowledge of Stanford." Well, in
fact, this is true. They came from all
over the world to learn about Stanford.

Pro Fros were encouraged to attend
classes.
A variety of programs on everything
from financial aid to undergraduate
research opportunities was offered. We
had a Friday night celebration high
lighted by performances from a broad
range of Stanford groups. Pro Fros
learned about all aspects of Stanford's
dorm life by staying overnight with
about 1,200 volunteer student hosts.
We spent the entire year planning a
week that would enable pro fros to
learn something about Stanford and
everything it has to offer.
Our aim was for the pro fros to
leave with a little more knowledge of
Stanford than they came here with,
enough upon which to make the deci
sion of where to spend the next four
years of their lives. Although the au-

thor of the Daily article wrote that he
had decided to come to Stanford be
cause he "had never been to northern
California," we hope that because of
the events of this past week, the pro
fros who visited will be able to make a
more informed decision.
We would like to thank everyone
involved with Pro Fro Week. Without
the continual aid, encouragement and
support of the Undergraduate Admis
sions office, Pro Fro Week never would
have happened.
To the 1,200 students hosts, we ex
tend a warm thank you. To the 60
house and dorm coordinators, we ap
preciate all the time and effort you put
into making this week a success.
Finally, to our general coordinators,
Pro Fro Week could not have happened
without your countless hours of hard

work.
