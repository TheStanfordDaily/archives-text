After hearing so much about the
Athletic Department's decision to cut
funds for team after team, I am dis
mayed to see that this department is
nevertheless willing to set aside funds
to attempt yet another re
establishment of cheerleaders at Stan
ford â€” an endeavor which has failed
too many times already to deserve
such support.
