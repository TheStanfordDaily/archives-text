## Women need more choices 
### 
LAST THURSDAY NIGHT at
Kresge Auditorium, Betty Friedan
said "I'm not sure how much choice
women have today." Friedan was talking
about child care and time off for parental
leave, and she attributed women's lack
of choices to a "blind spot" in politicians'
visions of choice in our society.
I think a lot of feminists have a blind
spot when it comes to sports. Talk about
lack of choice.
Last year, Newsweek magazine profiled
the rise of women to executive positions
with network television programs. Sara
Davidson, creator of the now-defunct se
ries "Heartbeat," said in the article that
male power behind the camera still dis
torts television's portrayal of women.
"You still get men's fantasies of the
way women talk and relate. The only
place I see women playing poker or
talking in sports analogies is on televi
sion. It just isn't realistic."
Well, I talk in sports analogies.
I'm the younger sister of an older
brother. And we were the only little kids
in our neighborhood. So while he was
playing out his fantasies of throwing
touchdown passes for the Green Bay
Packers, pitching perfect games for the
St. Louis Cardinals and sinking clutch
jumpers for the Los Angeles Lakers,
someone had to be the wide receiver, the
catcher and the defender.
We did the two-minute drill back and
forth across the 10-yard-wide strip of
lawn adjacent to our driveway better than
Roger Staubach and Drew Pearson (a
minor concession from my brother; some
times we were the Dallas Cowboys in
stead of the Packers). We struck out more

batters in the ninth inning of the seventh
game of the world series than Catfish
Hunter. And we won more NBA cham
pionships than Red Auerbach ever
dreamed of.
In terms of choice in sports, that was
about the most I ever had. I'm grateful
to my parents for choosing the neighbor
hood that forced my brother to select me
as his playmate, and I'm grateful that
my mother finally gave up on ballet les
sons.
If feminism is about letting women
define themselves, about letting women
choose, there has to be a place in
feminism for women and sports.
Both feminists and women athletes,
coaches and sports administrators — few
that they are — must face pervasive and
persistent stereotypes about women's
roles and definitions of what it means
to be a woman.
They both face the challenge of ad
dressing the diverse needs and problems
of women of color and lesbians. They
both face grossly inequitable earnings
compared to their male colleagues in
similar positions. They both face mar
ginalization for doing work related to
their gender.
After all, Tara VanDerveer is just a
women's basketball coach — coach of the
national champions, a proven winner over
her 12-year career, but still just a wom
en's basketball coach.
When she suggested in an April 22 San
Jose Mercury News article not only that
she might want to coach men's basketball
(you get paid a heckuva lot more) but
also that she might want to be one of
Golden State Warriors Coach Don Nel

son's assistants, she wasn't showered
with job offers.
Instead, a lot of male basketball
coaches and administrators got a bit bent
out of shape by VanDerveer's comments.
In fact, one of the owners of the Warriors
said in a class at the Law School that
there wouldn't be a woman coach in men's
professional basketball until: (1) we've
had a few women players in the NBA,
because most of the coaches were once
players; (2) male attitudes change about
women authority figures; and (3) women
are accepted into that tight coaching fra
ternity where the guys hang out after
the game, on the road 41 games a year,
and drink beer.
Now, maybe the NFL is different from
the NBA, but I have a hard time seeing
Tom Landry hanging out after the game
for beer with the guys. Besides, it's prob
ably time to reduce the connection be
tween sports and alcohol.
But these days I'm thinking of giving
up a career in public interest law so I
can climb the corporate ladder and buy
an NBA franchise. Then I can hire my
own coach, and she can pick her own
players.
Any other feminists care to contribute?
