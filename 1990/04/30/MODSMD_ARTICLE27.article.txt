## United Stanford Workers University's budget cuts should start at managerial level 
### 
WE SERIOUSLY QUESTION
the very sudden need for
massive budget cuts at Stan
ford. Does the actual cost of earth
quake damages really justify these
massive cuts, and if so, why not open
the financial books to the community
on damages, cost and monies already
received from various funds?
We have even more serious questions
about how these cutbacks are being
made and by whom.
If the administration makes cutbacks
which maintain a well-paid, bloated
administration while pushing out the
lower-cost employees who provide the
actual day-to-day services to students
and faculty, the cost of this reduction
will be incalculable. If the cutbacks do
not reduce real inefficiency by cutting
the fat at the top instead of the
muscle below, either services to stu
dents and faculty will be seriously cut,
or student tuition and faculty indirect
costs will continue to go up.
Why do we question how the cut
backs will be made? Because over the

past 10 years, workers, faculty and
students have seen the University run
increasingly as a profit-driven business
rather than as an educational and
research institution.
Some of us call this "edubusiness."
The Stanford administration has
recruited many managers from corpo
rations who bring with them a profit
driven mode of operation.
What do corporate administrators
and executives do in a time of cut
backs?
First, they have pushed out the
lower-cost employees, who do the
productive work, while preserving their
own well-paid positions or giving them
selves million-dollar "golden para
chutes" for their mismanagement.
Tresidder workers, for example, have
watched Tresidder directors, associate
and assistant directors, managers and
supervisors push out lower-cost cus
todians, clerical and exempt employees
who maintain the building and provide
services while preserving their own
questionable positions for which they

are sometimes paid two to three times
as much as workers.
One does not have to be a financial
genius to see that this is not cost
effective.
The second approach has been to
contract out work, which studies have
shown is not cost-effective in the long
run. For a nonprofit organization, it
adds an intervening layer of profit and
often brings in corruption.
Stanford workers, for example, have
been appalled that the University
allowed a manager to award contracts
and University equipment to his
brother-in-law when Stanford workers
could do the work. Stanford also al
lowed a manager to award a $60,000
contract to an outside contractor when
workers and even the contractor knew
the wiring involved could have been
repaired by Stanford workers for little
cost.
These examples are just the tip of
the iceberg on the long-term, high cost
of contracting out.
Ominously, the vice president of

administration resources, who is on the
"Repositioning Committee" and who
was formerly vice president of sales at
United Airlines, fired the director of
operations and maintenance because he
disagreeed with her corporate approach
to budget cuts — which includes con
tracting out and shutting down two
mismanaged shops.
The solution to the problem is to get
rid of the mis-managers, not the shops
and workers, as the vice president
suggested.
All of us — Stanford staff, union
and non-union alike, students and
faculty — need to come together to let
the administration know that if cuts
are not made fairly, that if the cuts
fall mostly on minorities and women
and workers, the University will pay a
heavy price in rebellion, exodus, loss of
credibility, low morale and, in the long
run, a possible loss of its pre-eminent
status.
Together we must also ask the ad
ministration the following questions:
You have been examining the budget

on a yearly basis and continually trim
ming the workforce:
• With all of these cuts why did you
not reduce tuition to students instead
of increasing it?
• Why did you not reduce indirect
costs to faculty instead of increasing
them?
• Why did you increase Operations
and Maintenance chargeout rates to
departments, rather than decreasing
them?
• How do you justify putting the
cutbacks or control of the information
gathering on which they will be based,
in the hands of those who perhaps
themselves most need to be cut?
