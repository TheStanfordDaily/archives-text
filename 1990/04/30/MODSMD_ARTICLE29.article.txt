## Sizzling golfers take fourth Women shoot lowest round of year twice at Pacific 10s 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Sometimes being good just isn't good
enough. In fact, as the women's golf
team showed this weekend, sometimes
being really good isn't good enough
either.
Despite playing their two best rounds
of the year, the Cardinal could only
manage to finish in fourth place at the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships
which were held here on the Stanford
Golf Course.

Cardinal fourth
at Pac>los

The team finished the three-round
tournament yesterday by shooting a
season-low 298 which equalled Friday
afternoon's first round score. Unfortu
nately, UCLA played even better in the
final round, shooting a 297 (the lowest
round of the tournament), good enough
for the 1990 Pac-10 bragging rights.
UCLA finished the tournament with
a three-round total of 898, one shot
ahead of Arizona and two ahead of pre
tournament favorite Arizona State. The
Cardinal finished a close fourth, only
six shots out, with an impressive 904.
Arizona State's freshman sensation
Brandi Burton, who is the world's num
ber one ranked amateur player, won
the individual title with a five-under-par
score of 214.
Although the team would like to have
finished with a better placing, the Car
dinal was still quite happy with its per
formance. As sophomore Stephanie
Davis said, "We're all pleased with how
we played this weekend. We would have
liked to have ended up higher, but our
conference is just really tough."
Junior Jodi Figley echoed the same
thought: "I'm really happy about how
we're playing right now. We're starting
to peak at just about the right time."
Davis, who ended with a 227, — good
enough to put her in Bth place individ

'This was definitely the
best we have played all
year. All five of our
players had solid
performances, and I'm
just elated with how they
played.'

ually — explained that the team's
showing will add much confidence to
the team. "With the teams in our con
ference, finishing only six shots out of
first will be a big boost to our confi
dence. Just knowing that we can com
pete with these teams is a confidence
builder."
The Pac-10 is widely regarded as the
toughest conference in the country, so
a fourth place finish is nothing to be
ashamed of. Coming into the tourna
ment, ASU was the nation's top-ranked
squad, Arizona was No. 4, UCLA was
No. 8 and Stanford was No. 9. Just
how well the Cardinal played is shown
by the fact that Washington, which
finished one spot below the Cardinal,
shot a 933, 29 shots behind Stanford.
Indeed, according to Coach Tim
Baldwin, the team played its best golf
of the year. "This was definitely the
best we have played all year. All five
of our players had solid performances,
and I'm just elated with how they
played."
In fact, the five played so well that
all finished in the top sixteen individ
ually. Adele Moore, who had a strong
final round of 73, finished in sixth place,
while Figley and Audrey Wooding tied
for eleventh place with final scores of
228. Stephanie Parel shot a 231 to finish
in sixteenth place.
Moore's performance especially im
pressed Baldwin. "This was Adele
Moore's most solid effort of the year,"
he said.

What is even more notable is that
she carded her top-10 placing while suf
fering from an extremely painful injury
to her arm. Moore first felt the pain,
which doctors diagnosed as tendinitis
in the bicep tendon, during the opening
round, but she continued to compete
and finished with one of her best tour
naments of the year.
"I just decided that it was going to
hurt anyway, so I might as well keep
playing," Moore said. "It bothered me
a lot, but it forced me to concentrate
on my game more. Playing well also
made it feel a little better ." Moore will
see another doctor later this week to
examine her arm.
Baldwin was equally impressed with
how the team concluded the tourna
ment. "They played their hearts out
and just wouldn't give up. On the back
nine of the final round, we shot a com
bined two-under-par, and this is the
best we've ever finished a tournament.
"I really have a lot of confidence in
the team now and they have lots of
confidence in themselves also. This per
formance shows us that we don't need
to back down from anyone," Baldwin
continued.
Indeed, the team's strong outing in
the Pac-lOs will undoubtedly keep the
Cardinal in the top-10 ranking they have
held almost all year long.
Baldwin feels the success is well
deserved. "They have really been work
ing hard and giving a lot of effort all
year, and now they are starting to reap
the dividends of their work."
One of the team's hardest workers,
Davis, has already been rewarded for
her exceptionally impressive year. After
yesterday's final round, the Pac-10 all
conference teams were announced and
Davis was named to the second team.
"It [the honor] is something I wasn't
really expecting, and it's kind of a shock
that my scores have put me up there
with all these great players," she said.
But scores don't lie, and the Cardi
nal's scores in the Pac-lOs will undoubt
edly help them in their upcoming
tournaments.
