### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee highlighted
an already exceptional Pacific 10 Confer
ence Individual Championship showing
by the Stanford men's tennis team, crush
ing USC's Donnie Isaak and Andros
Lanyi 6-4, 7-6 in the doubles final yes
terday in Ojai, Calif.
O'Brien, Stanford's top player at the
tournament, also made it to the finals
in singles before falling to UCLA's Jason
Netter 6-3, 6-2.
Before the finals, O'Brien had not lost
a single set in singles. In the quarter
finals, O'Brien downed doubles partner
Yee 6-1, 7-6. He then outtoughed UCLA's
Mark Knowles 7-6, 6-4 in the semifinals.

In the doubles, O'Brien and Yee, who
normally play No. 3 for the Cardinal,

relied on speed and smarts to overwhelm
more powerful opponents. In the quar
terfinals, the Cardinal duo crushed the
No. 4-ranked team in the country, USC's
Byron Black and Kent Seton, 6-3, 6-1.
O'Brien and Yee then outlasted Arizona
State's No. 1-ranked team of Brian
Gyetko and Dave Lomicky 7-6, 2-6, 6-1.
Perhaps most impressive in the tour
nament, however, was the play of Stan
ford freshman Jared Palmer. Palmer, who
had been sidelined since April 6 because
of knee surgery, reached the semifinals
of the prestigious singles tournament
before bowing out to Netter 6-1, 1-6, 6-4.
Down 4-1 in the third set against Net
ter, Palmer came back to knot the score
at 4-4. With Netter serving at 4-4, Palmer
jumped out to a 30-15 lead. On the next
point, the freshman pounded an approach
shot past Netter, but the ball landed just

ail inch beyond the baseline.
Netter went on to win his service game
and then break Palmer for the match.
"If [Palmer] would have broken him in
that game, he would have been serving
for the match. Then who knows what
could have happened?" Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said.
Palmer did not even know if he would
be able to participate in the tournament
until Wednesday, two days before the
event began. But Palmer's doctors said
his knee would be strong enough, and
Palmer made the trip with the team.
"Jared got better with each match,"
Gould said. "He's not match tough yet,
but it is good to see him back and com
peting. It was a tremendous effort."
Palmer almost made it to the finals of
the doubles tournament as well. He and
Dan Turbow, who were playing together

for the first time, lost in the semifinals
to Isaak and Lanyi 7-6, 6-7, 6-1.
In the quarterfinals, Palmer and Tur
bow upset last year's Pac-10 doubles
champions, UCLA's Bill Barber and Mark
Quinney, 6-3, 6-2.
Palmer's normal doubles parter, Jona
than Stark, could not make the trip be
cause of a stress fracture in his left foot.
Stark, Stanford's No. 1-ranked player,
beat the tournament champion, Netter,
6-1, 7-6 when the two played at Stanford
Tennis Stadium April 6.
Glenn Solomon and Alexis Hombrecher
also played well, rounding out an impres
sive performance by the entire Cardinal
team. Solomon rallied his way into the
quarterfinals before falling to Netter 6-2,
6-4.
Hombrecher ended up winning his first
round but eventually fell to Black, the

No. 5-ranked player in the country, 6-3,
6-3.
After two tough losses to USC and
UCLA just one week earlier, Gould was
especially excited about Stanford's dom
ination at a tournament which included
both Los Angeles schools.
"After getting beaten up at USC and
UCLA, we had some guys with bruised
egos and, worse yet, with some real phys
ical injuries," Gould said. "The best thing
about this tournament was that we had
a bunch of guys play well and no one
got hurt.
"This just gives us a tremendous
amount of momentum going into the
match Thursday against a tough Univer
sity of Washington squad and, of course,
the match over the weekend against
Berkeley."
