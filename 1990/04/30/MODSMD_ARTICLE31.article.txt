# Even 'hell' can't stop the Card
##

TEMPE — The Stanford base
ball team took a trip to its own
little corner of hell this weekend
and, for the first time in four
years, came away no worse for
the visit.
The Arizona State Sun Devils,
who began the weekend two and
a half games back of the Cardinal
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, have had their
way with Stanford at Packard Sta
dium since 1987, torturing the
Cardinal with eight wins (most of
them blowouts) in the team's last
nine meetings.
There was more of the same
this time around — the Devils
took two of this weekend's games
by a combined score of 29-6 —
but, thanks to a crazy, come-from
behind win in Friday's completion
of a suspended game and a solid
offensive display on Saturday,
Stanford came away with a split.
The split means that Stanford,
now 19-5 in the Six-Pac (42-9
overall), holds on to its lead over
the Sun Devils, who are 18-9 (42-
13). And, thanks to the four-game
edge in the loss column and its
4-2 advantage in the season series
with ASU, the Cardinal can clinch
the Six-Pac title with two wins in
its final six league games.
"We're playing really well right
now, so there was no reason to
think we couldn't come in here
and win," second baseman Troy
Paulsen said. "We're happy with
the split, because it means we
didn't lose any ground."
Technically, the series goes in
the books 2-1 in ASU's favor be
cause the Cardinal's 10-9
inning shocker on Friday, which
was a completion of the March 5
suspended game, will be recorded
as a win at Sunken Diamond. No
matter the venue of record,

Cardinal splits four
games with Sun Devils

though, this one had more excite
ment and weirdness in three in
nings than most games have in
nine.
Stan Spencer and Sean Rees,
both 11-0 and their teams' respec
tive aces, started the completion
in the Friday twilight and
promptly mowed down both
lineups in the 10th and 11th in
nings. In the 12th, though, Spen
cer walked second baseman
Anthony Manahan and then
threw two straight balls to Mike
Kelly.
Kelly waited for the next pitch,
looking at Spencer and, beyond
him, at the 30-foot high green
wall in center field, 400 feet away.
In the 17-year history of Packard
Stadium, only 10 players had ever
managed to clear the wall with a
home run.
Now there are 11. Kelly
destroyed Spencer's offering, as
center fielder Jeff Hammonds ran
back to the base of the wall,
stopped and watched the ball soar
off into the evening. ASU 9-7.
In the bottom of the 12th both
Hammonds and Paulsen reached
on singles, and then David
McCarty lofted a pop to shallow
right that somehow — probably
because of the twilight — was
misplayed by both Manahan and
Jim Austin. Bases loaded, no outs,
Paul Carey up.
Carey then hit a pop of his own
to left field. Mike Scialo raced in,
shortstop Fernando Vina raced
out, Kelly raced over from cen
ter. .. and the ball fell right in
front of Scialo, who was standing
still and looking hopelessly lost.
"You just don't see that too of

ten," Paulsen said. "The twilight
made things tough. It could've
happened to us."
Hammonds scored on Carey's
gift, and Paulsen then tied the
game (tripping on the catcher's
foot and landing on his head as
he slid into home) on Tim Grif
fin's fly ball — this one was ac
tually caught — to right.
McCarty went to third on Grif
fin's sacrifice and, after another
out, Ryan Turner worked the
count full against Rees.
Fastball right over the plate.
Turner swung and sent it cruising
to the right of Vina, who dove
and missed the ball by maybe an
inch. McCarty almost threw his
arms out pumping them in the
air on his way home, Turner was
almost killed as the entire team
jumped on him, and the Cardinal
had a 10-9 win.
"It was crazy," Carey said. "A
couple bloop hits, three runs and
that's the game.
"I think ASU's true colors came
out after that," Carey said,
"because they just came back (in
the regularly-scheduled game)
and kicked our butts."
That's putting it extremely
lightly. After a 30-minute wait be
tween games, the Devils came out
swinging, touching Spencer for
five runs in the first three innings
on the way to a 16-1 laugher.
"I'm really not sure what it
was," Spencer said. "I didn't have
good stuff in either game. The
break didn't help, but it's some
thing I should've been able to deal
with. It's no excuse."
Because of the number of
pitches thrown in the early game,
Spencer was lifted after the third,
leaving freshman Greg Mix to deal
with a 5-1 mess. Mix, though,
after setting the first two batters
down quietly, spent the rest of

Although Stanford dropped two contests by the combined score of 29-7, and pitchers Stan Spencer
and Brian Sackinsky lost their first decisions of the year, the squad survived the often-deadly trip
to the desert. By winning the suspended contest and Saturday's game, Stanford retained Its 2Vfe
game lead over Arizona State for Slx-Pac bragging rights.
