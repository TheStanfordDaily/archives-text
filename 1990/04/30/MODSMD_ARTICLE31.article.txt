# Even 'hell' can't stop the Card
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
TEMPE — The Stanford base
ball team took a trip to its own
little corner of hell this weekend
and, for the first time in four
years, came away no worse for
the visit.
The Arizona State Sun Devils,
who began the weekend two and
a half games back of the Cardinal
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, have had their
way with Stanford at Packard Sta
dium since 1987, torturing the
Cardinal with eight wins (most of
them blowouts) in the team's last
nine meetings.
There was more of the same
this time around — the Devils
took two of this weekend's games
by a combined score of 29-6 —
but, thanks to a crazy, come-from
behind win in Friday's completion
of a suspended game and a solid
offensive display on Saturday,
Stanford came away with a split.
The split means that Stanford,
now 19-5 in the Six-Pac (42-9
overall), holds on to its lead over
the Sun Devils, who are 18-9 (42-
13). And, thanks to the four-game
edge in the loss column and its
4-2 advantage in the season series
with ASU, the Cardinal can clinch
the Six-Pac title with two wins in
its final six league games.
"We're playing really well right
now, so there was no reason to
think we couldn't come in here
and win," second baseman Troy
Paulsen said. "We're happy with
the split, because it means we
didn't lose any ground."
Technically, the series goes in
the books 2-1 in ASU's favor be
cause the Cardinal's 10-9
inning shocker on Friday, which
was a completion of the March 5
suspended game, will be recorded
as a win at Sunken Diamond. No
matter the venue of record,

Cardinal splits four
games with Sun Devils

though, this one had more excite
ment and weirdness in three in
nings than most games have in
nine.
Stan Spencer and Sean Rees,
both 11-0 and their teams' respec
tive aces, started the completion
in the Friday twilight and
promptly mowed down both
lineups in the 10th and 11th in
nings. In the 12th, though, Spen
cer walked second baseman
Anthony Manahan and then
threw two straight balls to Mike
Kelly.
Kelly waited for the next pitch,
looking at Spencer and, beyond
him, at the 30-foot high green
wall in center field, 400 feet away.
In the 17-year history of Packard
Stadium, only 10 players had ever
managed to clear the wall with a
home run.
Now there are 11. Kelly
destroyed Spencer's offering, as
center fielder Jeff Hammonds ran
back to the base of the wall,
stopped and watched the ball soar
off into the evening. ASU 9-7.
In the bottom of the 12th both
Hammonds and Paulsen reached
on singles, and then David
McCarty lofted a pop to shallow
right that somehow — probably
because of the twilight — was
misplayed by both Manahan and
Jim Austin. Bases loaded, no outs,
Paul Carey up.
Carey then hit a pop of his own
to left field. Mike Scialo raced in,
shortstop Fernando Vina raced
out, Kelly raced over from cen
ter. .. and the ball fell right in
front of Scialo, who was standing
still and looking hopelessly lost.
"You just don't see that too of

ten," Paulsen said. "The twilight
made things tough. It could've
happened to us."
Hammonds scored on Carey's
gift, and Paulsen then tied the
game (tripping on the catcher's
foot and landing on his head as
he slid into home) on Tim Grif
fin's fly ball — this one was ac
tually caught — to right.
McCarty went to third on Grif
fin's sacrifice and, after another
out, Ryan Turner worked the
count full against Rees.
Fastball right over the plate.
Turner swung and sent it cruising
to the right of Vina, who dove
and missed the ball by maybe an
inch. McCarty almost threw his
arms out pumping them in the
air on his way home, Turner was
almost killed as the entire team
jumped on him, and the Cardinal
had a 10-9 win.
"It was crazy," Carey said. "A
couple bloop hits, three runs and
that's the game.
"I think ASU's true colors came
out after that," Carey said,
"because they just came back (in
the regularly-scheduled game)
and kicked our butts."
That's putting it extremely
lightly. After a 30-minute wait be
tween games, the Devils came out
swinging, touching Spencer for
five runs in the first three innings
on the way to a 16-1 laugher.
"I'm really not sure what it
was," Spencer said. "I didn't have
good stuff in either game. The
break didn't help, but it's some
thing I should've been able to deal
with. It's no excuse."
Because of the number of
pitches thrown in the early game,
Spencer was lifted after the third,
leaving freshman Greg Mix to deal
with a 5-1 mess. Mix, though,
after setting the first two batters
down quietly, spent the rest of

Although Stanford dropped two contests by the combined score of 29-7, and pitchers Stan Spencer
and Brian Sackinsky lost their first decisions of the year, the squad survived the often-deadly trip
to the desert. By winning the suspended contest and Saturday's game, Stanford retained Its 2Vfe
game lead over Arizona State for Slx-Pac bragging rights.
the inning trying to hold back a
tidal wave with a broom.
When the damage was done —
five walks, six hits, one passed
ball and an error later — the Sun
Devils were up by 15, the crowd
had grown unbelievably sarcastic
("Leave him in!") and the Devils
had scored one of their traditional
Cardinal maulings.
"It was just one of those
things," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "You have to per
form, and we just weren't really
sharp. . . There's nothing to be
dejected about. I'd just as soon
lose by 15 than lose a
heartbeaker."
Which is to say that he'd rather
not lose at all, and the Cardinal
obliged him the next night. Jump
ing all over (and chasing) ASU's
Todd Douma in the first inning,
the Cardinal rebounded nicely
from Friday's disaster with a 10-7
win.
"This was the biggest game of
the year for us," said Carey, who
had three doubles and a single.
"We could've laid over and died
after getting our butts kicked. . .
We knew this was big, and we
wanted it."
The Devils managed to chip
away at the lead, but Stanford
answered each ASU run with a
couple more. After Vina's bases
loaded triple pulled ASU to within
8-6 heading into the seventh, the
Cardinal came right back with two
more.
The first came when Jeff Ham
monds singled in Turner, who had
put down a perfect bunt to lead
off the inning. The second came
on a textbook double steal, with
Hammonds taking second, ASU
catcher Eric Helfand making a
futile attempt to throw him out,
and Troy Tallman racing home
on the play.
"We don't think they're gonna
get Jeff on that," Marquess said.
"When you're ahead you can take
a few more chances than you
usually would."
The Devils got nothing in the
bottom of the inning (thanks in
part to one of Roger Burnett's

three "there's-absolutely-no-way
you-can-do-this" defensive gems),
but made things messy in the
eighth. Mike Mussina left the
game after giving up a leadoff
double, and Scott Weiss came in
to nail down the win.
And almost nailed something
else instead. After striking Todd
Steverson out, Weiss walked Vina,
got a ground-ball force at second,
and then walked the next two bat
ters, the second with the bases
loaded.
"No breaker," Weiss said. No
kidding. Jim Austin then worked
the count to 2-2 and smashed the
ball right toward Tim Griffin at
third. With everyone running like
crazy, Griffin dropped the ball —
at which point the crowd went
bonkers — picked it up and made
a throw that Burnett, Nolan Ryan
and any cannon would be proud
of to get Austin by an inch.
Nothing like making things in
teresting. "Hey, we got the W,"
Weiss said. "That's what counts."
The Devils got the W the next
day, taking advantage of free
passes galore issued from the Car
dinal pitchers for a 13-6 romp.
"I didn't think we pitched well
today," Marquess said. "We gave
up a lot of walks . . . Last night
we made the big pitch when we
needed to, and today we just
didn't do it."
Four of those walks came off
starter Brian Sackinsky, who suf
fered his first loss of the year.
The Devils made it ugly early,
taking advantage of two walks,
an error and a big pitching mis
take to Kelly (who turned it into
a three-run homer) for a six-zip
lead in the second.
The Cardinal came back for
three of their own in the next
half-inning, but the Devils struck
back after Sackinsky walked two
more in the third and gave way
to John Reid, who gave up a
routine-fly-plus-lots-of-wind
home run to Mike Scialo, making
it 9-3 and effectively putting the
game out of reach.

back out on the same day — and the
word here is that it's just about the

TEMPE — The Stanford base
ball team took a trip to its own
little corner of hell this weekend
and, for the first time in four
years, came away no worse for
the visit.
The Arizona State Sun Devils,
who began the weekend two and
a half games back of the Cardinal
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, have had their
way with Stanford at Packard Sta
dium since 1987, torturing the
Cardinal with eight wins (most of
them blowouts) in the team's last
nine meetings.
There was more of the same
this time around — the Devils
took two of this weekend's games
by a combined score of 29-6 —
but, thanks to a crazy, come-from
behind win in Friday's completion
of a suspended game and a solid
offensive display on Saturday,
Stanford came away with a split.
The split means that Stanford,
now 19-5 in the Six-Pac (42-9
overall), holds on to its lead over
the Sun Devils, who are 18-9 (42-
13). And, thanks to the four-game
edge in the loss column and its
4-2 advantage in the season series
with ASU, the Cardinal can clinch
the Six-Pac title with two wins in
its final six league games.
"We're playing really well right
now, so there was no reason to
think we couldn't come in here
and win," second baseman Troy
Paulsen said. "We're happy with
the split, because it means we
didn't lose any ground."
Technically, the series goes in
the books 2-1 in ASU's favor be
cause the Cardinal's 10-9
inning shocker on Friday, which
was a completion of the March 5
suspended game, will be recorded
as a win at Sunken Diamond. No
matter the venue of record,

Cardinal splits four
games with Sun Devils

though, this one had more excite
ment and weirdness in three in
nings than most games have in
nine.
Stan Spencer and Sean Rees,
both 11-0 and their teams' respec
tive aces, started the completion
in the Friday twilight and
promptly mowed down both
lineups in the 10th and 11th in
nings. In the 12th, though, Spen
cer walked second baseman
Anthony Manahan and then
threw two straight balls to Mike
Kelly.
Kelly waited for the next pitch,
looking at Spencer and, beyond
him, at the 30-foot high green
wall in center field, 400 feet away.
In the 17-year history of Packard
Stadium, only 10 players had ever
managed to clear the wall with a
home run.
Now there are 11. Kelly
destroyed Spencer's offering, as
center fielder Jeff Hammonds ran
back to the base of the wall,
stopped and watched the ball soar
off into the evening. ASU 9-7.
In the bottom of the 12th both
Hammonds and Paulsen reached
on singles, and then David
McCarty lofted a pop to shallow
right that somehow — probably
because of the twilight — was
misplayed by both Manahan and
Jim Austin. Bases loaded, no outs,
Paul Carey up.
Carey then hit a pop of his own
to left field. Mike Scialo raced in,
shortstop Fernando Vina raced
out, Kelly raced over from cen
ter. .. and the ball fell right in
front of Scialo, who was standing
still and looking hopelessly lost.
"You just don't see that too of

ten," Paulsen said. "The twilight
made things tough. It could've
happened to us."
Hammonds scored on Carey's
gift, and Paulsen then tied the
game (tripping on the catcher's
foot and landing on his head as
he slid into home) on Tim Grif
fin's fly ball — this one was ac
tually caught — to right.
McCarty went to third on Grif
fin's sacrifice and, after another
out, Ryan Turner worked the
count full against Rees.
Fastball right over the plate.
Turner swung and sent it cruising
to the right of Vina, who dove
and missed the ball by maybe an
inch. McCarty almost threw his
arms out pumping them in the
air on his way home, Turner was
almost killed as the entire team
jumped on him, and the Cardinal
had a 10-9 win.
"It was crazy," Carey said. "A
couple bloop hits, three runs and
that's the game.
"I think ASU's true colors came
out after that," Carey said,
"because they just came back (in
the regularly-scheduled game)
and kicked our butts."
That's putting it extremely
lightly. After a 30-minute wait be
tween games, the Devils came out
swinging, touching Spencer for
five runs in the first three innings
on the way to a 16-1 laugher.
"I'm really not sure what it
was," Spencer said. "I didn't have
good stuff in either game. The
break didn't help, but it's some
thing I should've been able to deal
with. It's no excuse."
Because of the number of
pitches thrown in the early game,
Spencer was lifted after the third,
leaving freshman Greg Mix to deal
with a 5-1 mess. Mix, though,
after setting the first two batters
down quietly, spent the rest of

Although Stanford dropped two contests by the combined score of 29-7, and pitchers Stan Spencer
and Brian Sackinsky lost their first decisions of the year, the squad survived the often-deadly trip
to the desert. By winning the suspended contest and Saturday's game, Stanford retained Its 2Vfe
game lead over Arizona State for Slx-Pac bragging rights.
the inning trying to hold back a
tidal wave with a broom.
When the damage was done —
five walks, six hits, one passed
ball and an error later — the Sun
Devils were up by 15, the crowd
had grown unbelievably sarcastic
("Leave him in!") and the Devils
had scored one of their traditional
Cardinal maulings.
"It was just one of those
things," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "You have to per
form, and we just weren't really
sharp. . . There's nothing to be
dejected about. I'd just as soon
lose by 15 than lose a
heartbeaker."
Which is to say that he'd rather
not lose at all, and the Cardinal
obliged him the next night. Jump
ing all over (and chasing) ASU's
Todd Douma in the first inning,
the Cardinal rebounded nicely
from Friday's disaster with a 10-7
win.
"This was the biggest game of
the year for us," said Carey, who
had three doubles and a single.
"We could've laid over and died
after getting our butts kicked. . .
We knew this was big, and we
wanted it."
The Devils managed to chip
away at the lead, but Stanford
answered each ASU run with a
couple more. After Vina's bases
loaded triple pulled ASU to within
8-6 heading into the seventh, the
Cardinal came right back with two
more.
The first came when Jeff Ham
monds singled in Turner, who had
put down a perfect bunt to lead
off the inning. The second came
on a textbook double steal, with
Hammonds taking second, ASU
catcher Eric Helfand making a
futile attempt to throw him out,
and Troy Tallman racing home
on the play.
"We don't think they're gonna
get Jeff on that," Marquess said.
"When you're ahead you can take
a few more chances than you
usually would."
The Devils got nothing in the
bottom of the inning (thanks in
part to one of Roger Burnett's

three "there's-absolutely-no-way
you-can-do-this" defensive gems),
but made things messy in the
eighth. Mike Mussina left the
game after giving up a leadoff
double, and Scott Weiss came in
to nail down the win.
And almost nailed something
else instead. After striking Todd
Steverson out, Weiss walked Vina,
got a ground-ball force at second,
and then walked the next two bat
ters, the second with the bases
loaded.
"No breaker," Weiss said. No
kidding. Jim Austin then worked
the count to 2-2 and smashed the
ball right toward Tim Griffin at
third. With everyone running like
crazy, Griffin dropped the ball —
at which point the crowd went
bonkers — picked it up and made
a throw that Burnett, Nolan Ryan
and any cannon would be proud
of to get Austin by an inch.
Nothing like making things in
teresting. "Hey, we got the W,"
Weiss said. "That's what counts."
The Devils got the W the next
day, taking advantage of free
passes galore issued from the Car
dinal pitchers for a 13-6 romp.
"I didn't think we pitched well
today," Marquess said. "We gave
up a lot of walks . . . Last night
we made the big pitch when we
needed to, and today we just
didn't do it."
Four of those walks came off
starter Brian Sackinsky, who suf
fered his first loss of the year.
The Devils made it ugly early,
taking advantage of two walks,
an error and a big pitching mis
take to Kelly (who turned it into
a three-run homer) for a six-zip
lead in the second.
The Cardinal came back for
three of their own in the next
half-inning, but the Devils struck
back after Sackinsky walked two
more in the third and gave way
to John Reid, who gave up a
routine-fly-plus-lots-of-wind
home run to Mike Scialo, making
it 9-3 and effectively putting the
game out of reach.
Card notes
The baseball team would like to
extend their thanks to the fine folks
at America West Airlines, who tick
eted the entire team three months
ago but neglected to give them any

Beats on their return flight.
In case you're headed to the Grand
Canyon anytime soon, it takes about
two and a half hours to make the
6.5-mile, 4750-foot-deep trek to the
Colorado River via the South Kaibab
Trail. If you want to try and climb
back out on the same day — and the
word here is that it's just about the
dumbest thing you could possibly do
— it takes about three and a half
hours, several gallons of water and
an I.Q. so low you have no conception
of pain.

and win," second baseman Troy
Paulsen said. "We're happy with
the split, because it means we
didn't lose any ground."
Technically, the series goes in

inning shocker on Friday, which
was a completion of the March 5
suspended game, will be recorded
as a win at Sunken Diamond. No
matter the venue of record,

games with Sun Devils

though, this one had more excite
ment and weirdness in three in
nings than most games have in
nine.
Stan Spencer and Sean Rees,
both 11-0 and their teams' respec
tive aces, started the completion
in the Friday twilight and
promptly mowed down both
lineups in the 10th and 11th in
nings. In the 12th, though, Spen
cer walked second baseman
Anthony Manahan and then
threw two straight balls to Mike
Kelly.
Kelly waited for the next pitch,
looking at Spencer and, beyond
him, at the 30-foot high green
wall in center field, 400 feet away.
In the 17-year history of Packard
Stadium, only 10 players had ever
managed to clear the wall with a
home run.
Now there are 11. Kelly
destroyed Spencer's offering, as
center fielder Jeff Hammonds ran
back to the base of the wall,
stopped and watched the ball soar
off into the evening. ASU 9-7.
In the bottom of the 12th both
Hammonds and Paulsen reached
on singles, and then David
McCarty lofted a pop to shallow
right that somehow — probably
because of the twilight — was
misplayed by both Manahan and
Jim Austin. Bases loaded, no outs,
Paul Carey up.
Carey then hit a pop of his own
to left field. Mike Scialo raced in,
shortstop Fernando Vina raced
out, Kelly raced over from cen
ter. .. and the ball fell right in
front of Scialo, who was standing
still and looking hopelessly lost.
"You just don't see that too of

ten," Paulsen said. "The twilight
made things tough. It could've
happened to us."
Hammonds scored on Carey's
gift, and Paulsen then tied the
game (tripping on the catcher's
foot and landing on his head as
he slid into home) on Tim Grif
fin's fly ball — this one was ac
tually caught — to right.
McCarty went to third on Grif
fin's sacrifice and, after another
out, Ryan Turner worked the
count full against Rees.
Fastball right over the plate.
Turner swung and sent it cruising
to the right of Vina, who dove
and missed the ball by maybe an
inch. McCarty almost threw his
arms out pumping them in the
air on his way home, Turner was
almost killed as the entire team
jumped on him, and the Cardinal
had a 10-9 win.
"It was crazy," Carey said. "A
couple bloop hits, three runs and
that's the game.
"I think ASU's true colors came
out after that," Carey said,
"because they just came back (in
the regularly-scheduled game)
and kicked our butts."
That's putting it extremely
lightly. After a 30-minute wait be
tween games, the Devils came out
swinging, touching Spencer for
five runs in the first three innings
on the way to a 16-1 laugher.
"I'm really not sure what it
was," Spencer said. "I didn't have
good stuff in either game. The
break didn't help, but it's some
thing I should've been able to deal
with. It's no excuse."
Because of the number of
pitches thrown in the early game,
Spencer was lifted after the third,
leaving freshman Greg Mix to deal
with a 5-1 mess. Mix, though,
after setting the first two batters
down quietly, spent the rest of

the inning trying to hold back a
tidal wave with a broom.
When the damage was done —
five walks, six hits, one passed
ball and an error later — the Sun
Devils were up by 15, the crowd
had grown unbelievably sarcastic
("Leave him in!") and the Devils
had scored one of their traditional
Cardinal maulings.
"It was just one of those
things," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "You have to per
form, and we just weren't really
sharp. . . There's nothing to be
dejected about. I'd just as soon
lose by 15 than lose a
heartbeaker."
Which is to say that he'd rather
not lose at all, and the Cardinal
obliged him the next night. Jump
ing all over (and chasing) ASU's
Todd Douma in the first inning,
the Cardinal rebounded nicely
from Friday's disaster with a 10-7
win.
"This was the biggest game of
the year for us," said Carey, who
had three doubles and a single.
"We could've laid over and died
after getting our butts kicked. . .
We knew this was big, and we
wanted it."
The Devils managed to chip
away at the lead, but Stanford
answered each ASU run with a
couple more. After Vina's bases
loaded triple pulled ASU to within
8-6 heading into the seventh, the
Cardinal came right back with two
more.
The first came when Jeff Ham
monds singled in Turner, who had
put down a perfect bunt to lead
off the inning. The second came
on a textbook double steal, with
Hammonds taking second, ASU
catcher Eric Helfand making a
futile attempt to throw him out,
and Troy Tallman racing home
on the play.
"We don't think they're gonna
get Jeff on that," Marquess said.
"When you're ahead you can take
a few more chances than you
usually would."
The Devils got nothing in the
bottom of the inning (thanks in
part to one of Roger Burnett's

three "there's-absolutely-no-way
you-can-do-this" defensive gems),
but made things messy in the
eighth. Mike Mussina left the
game after giving up a leadoff
double, and Scott Weiss came in
to nail down the win.
And almost nailed something
else instead. After striking Todd
Steverson out, Weiss walked Vina,
got a ground-ball force at second,
and then walked the next two bat
ters, the second with the bases
loaded.
"No breaker," Weiss said. No
kidding. Jim Austin then worked
the count to 2-2 and smashed the
ball right toward Tim Griffin at
third. With everyone running like
crazy, Griffin dropped the ball —
at which point the crowd went
bonkers — picked it up and made
a throw that Burnett, Nolan Ryan
and any cannon would be proud
of to get Austin by an inch.
Nothing like making things in
teresting. "Hey, we got the W,"
Weiss said. "That's what counts."
The Devils got the W the next
day, taking advantage of free
passes galore issued from the Car
dinal pitchers for a 13-6 romp.
"I didn't think we pitched well
today," Marquess said. "We gave
up a lot of walks . . . Last night
we made the big pitch when we
needed to, and today we just
didn't do it."
Four of those walks came off
starter Brian Sackinsky, who suf
fered his first loss of the year.
The Devils made it ugly early,
taking advantage of two walks,
an error and a big pitching mis
take to Kelly (who turned it into
a three-run homer) for a six-zip
lead in the second.
The Cardinal came back for
three of their own in the next
half-inning, but the Devils struck
back after Sackinsky walked two
more in the third and gave way
to John Reid, who gave up a
routine-fly-plus-lots-of-wind
home run to Mike Scialo, making
it 9-3 and effectively putting the
game out of reach.

TEMPE — The Stanford base
ball team took a trip to its own
little corner of hell this weekend
and, for the first time in four
years, came away no worse for
the visit.
The Arizona State Sun Devils,
who began the weekend two and
a half games back of the Cardinal
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, have had their
way with Stanford at Packard Sta
dium since 1987, torturing the
Cardinal with eight wins (most of
them blowouts) in the team's last
nine meetings.
There was more of the same
this time around — the Devils
took two of this weekend's games
by a combined score of 29-6 —
but, thanks to a crazy, come-from
behind win in Friday's completion
of a suspended game and a solid
offensive display on Saturday,
Stanford came away with a split.
The split means that Stanford,
now 19-5 in the Six-Pac (42-9
overall), holds on to its lead over
the Sun Devils, who are 18-9 (42-
13). And, thanks to the four-game
edge in the loss column and its
4-2 advantage in the season series
with ASU, the Cardinal can clinch
the Six-Pac title with two wins in
its final six league games.
"We're playing really well right
now, so there was no reason to
think we couldn't come in here
and win," second baseman Troy
Paulsen said. "We're happy with
the split, because it means we
didn't lose any ground."
Technically, the series goes in
the books 2-1 in ASU's favor be
cause the Cardinal's 10-9
inning shocker on Friday, which
was a completion of the March 5
suspended game, will be recorded
as a win at Sunken Diamond. No

Kelly waited for the next pitch,

him, at the 30-foot high green

In the 17-year history of Packard

TEMPE — The Stanford base
ball team took a trip to its own
little corner of hell this weekend
and, for the first time in four
years, came away no worse for
the visit.
The Arizona State Sun Devils,
who began the weekend two and
a half games back of the Cardinal
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, have had their
way with Stanford at Packard Sta
dium since 1987, torturing the
Cardinal with eight wins (most of
them blowouts) in the team's last
nine meetings.
There was more of the same
this time around — the Devils
took two of this weekend's games
by a combined score of 29-6 —
but, thanks to a crazy, come-from
behind win in Friday's completion
of a suspended game and a solid
offensive display on Saturday,
Stanford came away with a split.
The split means that Stanford,
now 19-5 in the Six-Pac (42-9
overall), holds on to its lead over
the Sun Devils, who are 18-9 (42-
13). And, thanks to the four-game
edge in the loss column and its
4-2 advantage in the season series
with ASU, the Cardinal can clinch
the Six-Pac title with two wins in
its final six league games.
"We're playing really well right
now, so there was no reason to
think we couldn't come in here
and win," second baseman Troy
Paulsen said. "We're happy with
the split, because it means we
didn't lose any ground."
Technically, the series goes in
the books 2-1 in ASU's favor be
cause the Cardinal's 10-9
inning shocker on Friday, which
was a completion of the March 5
suspended game, will be recorded
as a win at Sunken Diamond. No
matter the venue of record,

Cardinal splits four
games with Sun Devils

though, this one had more excite
ment and weirdness in three in
nings than most games have in
nine.
Stan Spencer and Sean Rees,
both 11-0 and their teams' respec
tive aces, started the completion
in the Friday twilight and
promptly mowed down both
lineups in the 10th and 11th in
nings. In the 12th, though, Spen
cer walked second baseman
Anthony Manahan and then
threw two straight balls to Mike
Kelly.
Kelly waited for the next pitch,
looking at Spencer and, beyond
him, at the 30-foot high green
wall in center field, 400 feet away.
In the 17-year history of Packard
Stadium, only 10 players had ever
managed to clear the wall with a
home run.
Now there are 11. Kelly
destroyed Spencer's offering, as
center fielder Jeff Hammonds ran
back to the base of the wall,
stopped and watched the ball soar
off into the evening. ASU 9-7.
In the bottom of the 12th both
Hammonds and Paulsen reached
on singles, and then David
McCarty lofted a pop to shallow
right that somehow — probably
because of the twilight — was
misplayed by both Manahan and
Jim Austin. Bases loaded, no outs,
Paul Carey up.
Carey then hit a pop of his own
to left field. Mike Scialo raced in,
shortstop Fernando Vina raced
out, Kelly raced over from cen
ter. .. and the ball fell right in
front of Scialo, who was standing
still and looking hopelessly lost.
"You just don't see that too of

ten," Paulsen said. "The twilight
made things tough. It could've
happened to us."
Hammonds scored on Carey's
gift, and Paulsen then tied the
game (tripping on the catcher's
foot and landing on his head as
he slid into home) on Tim Grif
fin's fly ball — this one was ac
tually caught — to right.
McCarty went to third on Grif
fin's sacrifice and, after another
out, Ryan Turner worked the
count full against Rees.
Fastball right over the plate.
Turner swung and sent it cruising
to the right of Vina, who dove
and missed the ball by maybe an
inch. McCarty almost threw his
arms out pumping them in the
air on his way home, Turner was
almost killed as the entire team
jumped on him, and the Cardinal
had a 10-9 win.
"It was crazy," Carey said. "A
couple bloop hits, three runs and
that's the game.
"I think ASU's true colors came
out after that," Carey said,
"because they just came back (in
the regularly-scheduled game)
and kicked our butts."
That's putting it extremely
lightly. After a 30-minute wait be
tween games, the Devils came out
swinging, touching Spencer for
five runs in the first three innings
on the way to a 16-1 laugher.
"I'm really not sure what it
was," Spencer said. "I didn't have
good stuff in either game. The
break didn't help, but it's some
thing I should've been able to deal
with. It's no excuse."
Because of the number of
pitches thrown in the early game,
Spencer was lifted after the third,
leaving freshman Greg Mix to deal
with a 5-1 mess. Mix, though,
after setting the first two batters
down quietly, spent the rest of

Although Stanford dropped two contests by the combined score of 29-7, and pitchers Stan Spencer
and Brian Sackinsky lost their first decisions of the year, the squad survived the often-deadly trip
to the desert. By winning the suspended contest and Saturday's game, Stanford retained Its 2Vfe
game lead over Arizona State for Slx-Pac bragging rights.
the inning trying to hold back a
tidal wave with a broom.
When the damage was done —
five walks, six hits, one passed
ball and an error later — the Sun
Devils were up by 15, the crowd
had grown unbelievably sarcastic
("Leave him in!") and the Devils
had scored one of their traditional
Cardinal maulings.
"It was just one of those
things," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "You have to per
form, and we just weren't really
sharp. . . There's nothing to be
dejected about. I'd just as soon
lose by 15 than lose a
heartbeaker."
Which is to say that he'd rather
not lose at all, and the Cardinal
obliged him the next night. Jump
ing all over (and chasing) ASU's
Todd Douma in the first inning,
the Cardinal rebounded nicely
from Friday's disaster with a 10-7
win.
"This was the biggest game of
the year for us," said Carey, who
had three doubles and a single.
"We could've laid over and died
after getting our butts kicked. . .
We knew this was big, and we
wanted it."
The Devils managed to chip
away at the lead, but Stanford
answered each ASU run with a
couple more. After Vina's bases
loaded triple pulled ASU to within
8-6 heading into the seventh, the
Cardinal came right back with two
more.
The first came when Jeff Ham
monds singled in Turner, who had
put down a perfect bunt to lead
off the inning. The second came
on a textbook double steal, with
Hammonds taking second, ASU
catcher Eric Helfand making a
futile attempt to throw him out,
and Troy Tallman racing home
on the play.
"We don't think they're gonna
get Jeff on that," Marquess said.
"When you're ahead you can take
a few more chances than you
usually would."
The Devils got nothing in the
bottom of the inning (thanks in
part to one of Roger Burnett's

three "there's-absolutely-no-way
you-can-do-this" defensive gems),
but made things messy in the
eighth. Mike Mussina left the
game after giving up a leadoff
double, and Scott Weiss came in
to nail down the win.
And almost nailed something
else instead. After striking Todd
Steverson out, Weiss walked Vina,
got a ground-ball force at second,
and then walked the next two bat
ters, the second with the bases
loaded.
"No breaker," Weiss said. No
kidding. Jim Austin then worked
the count to 2-2 and smashed the
ball right toward Tim Griffin at
third. With everyone running like
crazy, Griffin dropped the ball —
at which point the crowd went
bonkers — picked it up and made
a throw that Burnett, Nolan Ryan
and any cannon would be proud
of to get Austin by an inch.
Nothing like making things in
teresting. "Hey, we got the W,"
Weiss said. "That's what counts."
The Devils got the W the next
day, taking advantage of free
passes galore issued from the Car
dinal pitchers for a 13-6 romp.
"I didn't think we pitched well
today," Marquess said. "We gave
up a lot of walks . . . Last night
we made the big pitch when we
needed to, and today we just
didn't do it."
Four of those walks came off
starter Brian Sackinsky, who suf
fered his first loss of the year.
The Devils made it ugly early,
taking advantage of two walks,
an error and a big pitching mis
take to Kelly (who turned it into
a three-run homer) for a six-zip
lead in the second.
The Cardinal came back for
three of their own in the next
half-inning, but the Devils struck
back after Sackinsky walked two
more in the third and gave way
to John Reid, who gave up a
routine-fly-plus-lots-of-wind
home run to Mike Scialo, making
it 9-3 and effectively putting the
game out of reach.

The baseball team would like to
extend their thanks to the fine folks

Beats on their return flight.
In case you're headed to the Grand

back out on the same day — and the
word here is that it's just about the
dumbest thing you could possibly do

Hammonds and Paulsen reached
on singles, and then David
McCarty lofted a pop to shallow
right that somehow — probably
because of the twilight — was
misplayed by both Manahan and
Jim Austin. Bases loaded, no outs,
Paul Carey up.
Carey then hit a pop of his own
to left field. Mike Scialo raced in,
shortstop Fernando Vina raced
out, Kelly raced over from cen
ter. .. and the ball fell right in
front of Scialo, who was standing
still and looking hopelessly lost.
"You just don't see that too of

ten," Paulsen said. "The twilight
made things tough. It could've
happened to us."
Hammonds scored on Carey's
gift, and Paulsen then tied the
game (tripping on the catcher's
foot and landing on his head as
he slid into home) on Tim Grif
fin's fly ball — this one was ac
tually caught — to right.
McCarty went to third on Grif
fin's sacrifice and, after another
out, Ryan Turner worked the
count full against Rees.
Fastball right over the plate.
Turner swung and sent it cruising
to the right of Vina, who dove
and missed the ball by maybe an
inch. McCarty almost threw his
arms out pumping them in the
air on his way home, Turner was
almost killed as the entire team
jumped on him, and the Cardinal
had a 10-9 win.
"It was crazy," Carey said. "A
couple bloop hits, three runs and
that's the game.
"I think ASU's true colors came
out after that," Carey said,
"because they just came back (in
the regularly-scheduled game)
and kicked our butts."
That's putting it extremely
lightly. After a 30-minute wait be
tween games, the Devils came out
swinging, touching Spencer for
five runs in the first three innings
on the way to a 16-1 laugher.
"I'm really not sure what it
was," Spencer said. "I didn't have
good stuff in either game. The
break didn't help, but it's some
thing I should've been able to deal
with. It's no excuse."
Because of the number of
pitches thrown in the early game,
Spencer was lifted after the third,
leaving freshman Greg Mix to deal
with a 5-1 mess. Mix, though,
after setting the first two batters
down quietly, spent the rest of


Al Green - Dairy file
Although Stanford dropped two contests by the combined score of 29-7, and pitchers Stan Spencer
and Brian Sackinsky lost their first decisions of the year, the squad survived the often-deadly trip
to the desert. By winning the suspended contest and Saturday's game, Stanford retained Its 2Vfe
game lead over Arizona State for Slx-Pac bragging rights.
the inning trying to hold back a
tidal wave with a broom.
When the damage was done —
five walks, six hits, one passed
ball and an error later — the Sun
Devils were up by 15, the crowd
had grown unbelievably sarcastic
("Leave him in!") and the Devils
had scored one of their traditional
Cardinal maulings.
"It was just one of those
things," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "You have to per
form, and we just weren't really
sharp. . . There's nothing to be
dejected about. I'd just as soon
lose by 15 than lose a
heartbeaker."
Which is to say that he'd rather
not lose at all, and the Cardinal
obliged him the next night. Jump
ing all over (and chasing) ASU's
Todd Douma in the first inning,
the Cardinal rebounded nicely
from Friday's disaster with a 10-7
win.
"This was the biggest game of
the year for us," said Carey, who
had three doubles and a single.
"We could've laid over and died
after getting our butts kicked. . .
We knew this was big, and we
wanted it."
The Devils managed to chip
away at the lead, but Stanford
answered each ASU run with a
couple more. After Vina's bases
loaded triple pulled ASU to within
8-6 heading into the seventh, the
Cardinal came right back with two
more.
The first came when Jeff Ham
monds singled in Turner, who had
put down a perfect bunt to lead
off the inning. The second came
on a textbook double steal, with
Hammonds taking second, ASU
catcher Eric Helfand making a
futile attempt to throw him out,
and Troy Tallman racing home
on the play.
"We don't think they're gonna
get Jeff on that," Marquess said.
"When you're ahead you can take
a few more chances than you
usually would."
The Devils got nothing in the
bottom of the inning (thanks in
part to one of Roger Burnett's

three "there's-absolutely-no-way
you-can-do-this" defensive gems),
but made things messy in the
eighth. Mike Mussina left the
game after giving up a leadoff
double, and Scott Weiss came in
to nail down the win.
And almost nailed something
else instead. After striking Todd
Steverson out, Weiss walked Vina,
got a ground-ball force at second,
and then walked the next two bat
ters, the second with the bases
loaded.
"No breaker," Weiss said. No
kidding. Jim Austin then worked
the count to 2-2 and smashed the
ball right toward Tim Griffin at
third. With everyone running like
crazy, Griffin dropped the ball —
at which point the crowd went
bonkers — picked it up and made
a throw that Burnett, Nolan Ryan
and any cannon would be proud
of to get Austin by an inch.
Nothing like making things in
teresting. "Hey, we got the W,"
Weiss said. "That's what counts."
The Devils got the W the next
day, taking advantage of free
passes galore issued from the Car
dinal pitchers for a 13-6 romp.
"I didn't think we pitched well
today," Marquess said. "We gave
up a lot of walks . . . Last night
we made the big pitch when we
needed to, and today we just
didn't do it."
Four of those walks came off
starter Brian Sackinsky, who suf
fered his first loss of the year.
The Devils made it ugly early,
taking advantage of two walks,
an error and a big pitching mis
take to Kelly (who turned it into
a three-run homer) for a six-zip
lead in the second.
The Cardinal came back for
three of their own in the next
half-inning, but the Devils struck
back after Sackinsky walked two
more in the third and gave way
to John Reid, who gave up a
routine-fly-plus-lots-of-wind
home run to Mike Scialo, making
it 9-3 and effectively putting the
game out of reach.
Card notes
The baseball team would like to
extend their thanks to the fine folks
at America West Airlines, who tick

ago but neglected to give them any

Beats on their return flight.
In case you're headed to the Grand
Canyon anytime soon, it takes about
two and a half hours to make the
6.5-mile, 4750-foot-deep trek to the
Colorado River via the South Kaibab
Trail. If you want to try and climb
back out on the same day — and the
word here is that it's just about the
dumbest thing you could possibly do
— it takes about three and a half
hours, several gallons of water and
an I.Q. so low you have no conception
of pain.
