# Closest Big Meet in years comes down to the final gun
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
The fact that Stanford's track and
field teams ended up with a lower score
than California in Big Meet had little
to do with who won.
The remarks of senior hurdler Tim
Collins, who reii\jured his back during
the meet, just as he was beginning his
comeback for a last hurrah, said it all.
"This might be my last race," he said.
"My injury was acting up again on the
backstretch. But still, I'm glad I com
peted. I feel proud to have contributed,
to have been a part of this."
There was no bitterness, no "I ended
my career in a useless meet losing to
Cal, goddammit". Collins was "proud
to have been a part of' a loss.
To be sure, the final scores hurt (85-
77 for the men, 77-68 for the women),
but Collins's comments reflected the
sentiments of the entire team. Through
out the meet the team members
displayed tremendous inspirational sup
port for each other, cheering at every
opportunity, pushing each other to excel
beyond their limits.
They succeeded. A few of the Cardinal
achieved personal bests, with several
qualifying for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships. Several members of the
team echoed Coach Brooks Johnson's
comment that "We did as well as we
possibly could have. Everyone gave all
they had and more."
The first event was the women's
javelin, which the Golden Bears' Laura
Baker won by passing Peggy Odita on
the last throw of the competition. But
Odita and fellow thrower Jen Jauquet
were buoyed by the presence of the en
tire Cardinal team, which had gathered
alongside the runway to offer their sup
port.
As the meet progressed, it became
more and more obvious for both the
men and the women that each compe
tition might have to be decided by the
last event, the 1600-meter relay. The
women's score was tight all the way,
often tied. The men fell behind in the
first few events, but then took a large
lead into the last few events.
Beginning with the 3000-meter
steeplechase, Stanford's men began a
point-scoring binge. That race marked
the return of formerly injured senior
Steve Miller. He promptly won it, with
teammate Fred Carter taking second.
Then followed the most successful
event of the day for the Cardinal. Eric
Mastalir, Bill Crowley, Dave Strang and
Alex Accetta went 1-2-3-4 in the 1500-
meter run, sweeping the points and then

some. All four beat the Pac-10-qualifying
mark, Accetta and Mastalir for the first
time. Stanford will be represented by
these four plus Mark Mastalir in that
event at the conference meet.
The Cardinal men cruised in the next
several events. Marcus Hickerson
nabbed first place in the long jump with
a personal-best and NCAA provisional
qualifying distance of 25-7 1/2. "Boom!"
he exclaimed in celebration, pumping
his fists.
Then followed a somewhat surprising
sweep in the high hurdles and a 2-3
finish in the 400-meter run.
One of the brightest spots for the
Cardinal in the later events was the
800-meter run, which was swept by
Strang, Crowley and Accetta. The latter
two achieved season bests, and Accetta
will now join Strang and Crowley at
Pac-lOs in that event.
Another highlight was Jamie Marek's
first place in the pole vault at a season
best 15-foot-6 height.
Despite the too obvious fact that the
Bears had been steadily inching back
into contention, two events combined to
raise the spirits of the Cardinal squad.
First, the 200-meter race, which was
supposed to be a lock for two-time Olym
pian Bear Atlee Mahorn, generated
much jubilation for Stanford.
Mahorn, supposing that he had no
competition, slacked off his usual world
class pace. He looked back to see how
far behind his opponents were and dis
covered that he was about to be passed
by Cardinal junior James Cramton. He
managed to salvage the first place, but
Cramton was so close behind Atlee that
they were both credited with 21.3, tying
a personal best for Cramton.
Immediately following this was a
sweep of the 5000-meter run by Eric
Mastalir, Mark Mastalir and Dave
Scudamore.
Meanwhile, the women's competition
was see-sawing.
Among the many highlights for them
were first-place finishes by Chryste
Gaines in the 100- and 200-meter
dashes. Gaines also anchored the victo
rious 400-meter relay, which posted a
season-best 46-flat. The crowd began
cheering wildly at the handoff from

'We did as well as we possibly could have. Every
one gave all they had and more.'
— Brooks Johnson

third to last leg, as their team was just
barely ahead, but Gaines promptly
silenced them.
Debby Malueg and Shannon Parker
combined to go 1-2 in the shot put.
Malueg also placed in the discus.
Odita, Wendy Allen, Jauquet and
Kathy Unruh went 1-2-3-4 in the high
jump, one of the many events in which
Odita and Jauquet — both heptathletes
— participated. Odita was actually com
peting in the shot put and high jump
at the same time.
Another bright spot for the women
was the performance of the jumpers.
Up against world-class jumper Sheila
Hudson, the women jumpers garnered
a 2-3 finish in the long jump and a
third place in the triple. Alysia Hubbard
popped a personal-record 20-foot-4 in
the long jump for second place.
The jumps, however, were one area
where injuries obviously held back the
Cardinal. Jackie Edwards suffered a
slight injury in the long jump, and Hub
bard could not take as many jumps as
she might have wanted in the triple
jump due to a small injury of her own.
The Cardinal was hurt by ir\juries on
the track as well. Rhonda Oliver pulled
a hamstring in the 400-meters, not only
depriving her of a victory there, but
also a first or second in the 200-meters
later. Carol Gray competed for the first
time in a while, and it showed, as she
simply could not match her normal pace.
Finally, Jodie Bilotta, another distancer
who had been predicted to come back,
did not.
Nevertheless, the women held their
own in the distance events. Gray still
managed to garner some points for the
Cardinal, and Melanie Bloch, Jill
Schenkel, Ashley Black and Amy
McConnel all had impressive perform
ances.
In the end, both men's and women's
events came down to the last event, the
1600-meter relay. The scores at that
time were 77-76 Stanford men, and a
68-68 tie in the women's competition.
After California won the two exciting
races, Johnson mustered his troops for
an inspirational talk.
Johnson summed up their efforts per
fectly. "You have graced this place," he
told them.

Ugh
The Cardinal's Debbie Maiueg won both the shot put and discus Saturday, helping
bring the Big Meet down to the wire. Although the Golden Bears ultimately triumphed
77-68 in the women's and men's competitions, Stanford recorded a number of
personal bests and qualified athletes for post-season meets.
