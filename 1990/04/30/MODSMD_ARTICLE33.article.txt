## Graham emerges victor from all-Stanford semis 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
As a freshman last season, Debbie Graham was
known as "Miss Consolation." She earned the
moniker after emerging atop the losers bracket in
a couple of tournaments.
Now, you can simply call her Pacific 10 Conference
champion. Graham recorded a mild upset of team
mate Meredith McGrath 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 in Ojai, Calif,
yesterday to capture the Pac-10 crown.
In both 1988 and '89, the Cardinal nearly made
the semifinals an all-Stanford event, placing three
players among the final four. This time, the team
assured itself the individual champion by coloring
the semifinals nothing but red.
Graham's charge to the championship was quite
impressive. In Friday's quarterfinals, she hammered
Arizona's Danielle Scott 6-0, 6-2.
The next day she met up with Sandra Birch, who
is not only a close friend but also Graham's doubles
partner. In addition, Birch was the defending Pac-10
champion.
None of that mattered when the two squared off
Saturday as Graham handled Birch easily 6-4, 6-1.
Birch had reached the semifinals with a 6-2, 6-2
decimation of Arizona State's Laura Glitz.
On the other side of the draw, McGrath reached
the semis after slipping by Anya Kochoff of USC,
5-7, 6-2, 6-2. That earned her a date with Teri
Whitlinger, who advanced by pasting UCLA's
Iwalani McCalla 6-1, 6-3.
The McGrath-Whitlinger showdown was another
battle of the doubles partners. McGrath, the fresh
man, bested Whitlinger, the junior, by a 6-3, 7-6
tally. In both semifinals the junior was defeated by
an underclassman.
Stanford was not content with just a singles cham
pion, though. The Cardinal captured the doubles
title in the main draw and both titles in the invi
tational draw.
All four singles semifinalists found themselves in
the doubles semis as well. McGrath and Whitlinger
knocked off the Bruin tandem of McCalla and
Kirsten Dreyer 6-2, 6-0 Saturday. Meanwhile, Birch

and Graham finished off another UCLA duo, Stella
Sampras and Mamie Ceniza, 7-6, 6-4.
McGrath and Whitlinger took the doubles title
yesterday from their teammates 6-4, 6-1.
Only three of the four semifinalists in the invi
tational draw were Stanford players. Of course, only
three Cardinal representatives were entered in the
invitational event.
Semifinal action pitted Kylie Johnson against
Kyra Johnson of Arizona. The name-tag nightmare
("Just have one say K. Johnson ... Make that Ky.
Johnson ... Arrrrggghhh!'*) was decided in favor
of the Cardinal sophomore 6-2, 6-0.
On the other side, a pair of Stanford freshmen,
Heather Willens and Mario Carruth, took to the
court. Willens emerged victorious by a score of 6-1,
6-3.
Yesterday, Johnson dropped the first set to Willens
before rebounding to defeat her 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. Car
ruth, though, did not go away empty handed. She
and Johnson won the invitational doubles title Sat
urday.
Card notes
While the Cardinal's performance was nothing short of
dominant, it was tainted ever so blightly by the absence
of two of the Pac-10's best. UCLA junior Jessica Emmons
suffered a stress fracture in her leg and was not in Ojai.
Similarly, USC junior Trisha Laux pulled out of the
tournament at the last minute with an injury. Both Em
mons and Laux have beaten Birch this season, which
serves as some indication of their talent.
The NCAA Championships begin a week from Wednes
day in Gainesville, Fla. Between now and then, the Car
dinal's only action will be in the annual mixed match
exhibition with California next Sunday.
Stanford will unquestionably be seeded No. 1 in team
competition. Graham, Birch, McGrath and Whitlinger are
shoo-ins for the individual tournament. Senior Lisa Green,
a three-time NCAA singles semifinalist, should also make
the event.
McGrath-Whitlinger and Birch-Graham will both make
the NCAA doubles as well. Stanford has not had a doubles
champion since 1985 when Linda Gates and Leigh Anne
Eldredge won the title.
