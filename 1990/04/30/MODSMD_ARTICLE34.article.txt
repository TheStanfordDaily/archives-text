# Cardinal crews cruise by opponents

The Cardinal crew teams nearly
swept their competition Saturday
in a tune-up race for the upcom
ing "Big Row" and Pacific 10 Con
ference meets.
At Redwood Creek, the men's
varsity and junior varsity cap
tured two wins against UC-Irvine.
Across town at Redwood Shores,
the men's freshman and novice
boats took four out of five races,
while the four women's boats
swept UC-Davis.
Coming off a disappointing
sixth place finish in the Stanford
Rowing Classic April 21-22, the
women's varsity handily defeated
the Davis women by what one
observer characterised as "a whole
lot." The women's novice crew
also managed to cruise to victory

by finishing four lengths out in
front.
With injuries hampering the
women's squad, two spots needed
to be filled in the junior varsity
boat. Cara Larson and J.J. Jensen
moved up from the victorious
frosh boat and helped the JV glide
across the finish line seven seats
in front of the Aggies.
"We're struggling with some
key people injured, but we have
good depth, which is helping im
mensely," women's Coach John
Davis said.
The Cardinal men fared just as
well. The varsity crew easily
stroked past Irvine and gained
some confidence after placing
sixth in last week's Classic. Win
ning by eight seconds, the JV crew
also defeated their Anteater coun
terparts.

Pleased with the progress of his
men's crew program, Coach Ken
Dreyfuss said, "It's nice to win.
Over the last couple of races, the
varsity has beaten Oregon State,
lost to Cal and beaten Irvine,
while the JV has won its last two
over Columbia and Irvine."
Not to be outdone, the Stanford
freshman boat stomped on the
Anteaters, winning by an amazing
thirty seconds. Not wanting to
spoil the morning of victory, the
novice crew, also known as the
second freshman boat, beat both
Davis and Irvine's men by two
lengths.
Randal Burns, member of the
novice boat, was pleased with the
outcome of the races."It was a
banner day for the men's crew
program."
The only loss for the Cardinal

Saturday was in the form of the
third freshman boat â€” it finished
two lengths behind Santa Clara.
But, making up for their perform
ance, the crew outdistanced the
Davis lightweights by two lengths
in their next competition.
"We've never had a group with
this much experience," Dreyfuss
said. "We have a very solid group
of experienced rowers as well as
talented novices."
Coming off this tune-up meet,
the Cardinal crews hope to repeat
their performances against the
Bears at Redwood Shores May 5
in the "Big Row" and again at
the Pac-10 Championships.
"The biggest thing is that Cal
is a good crew this year," Dreyfuss
said. "Our main goal this week is
to really row our crew race and
not get intimidated."
