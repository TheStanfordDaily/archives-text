# Men's linksters struggle at conference tourney
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
Last season, the Cardinal
men's golf team surprised
everyone at the Pacific 10 Con
ference tournament. After an
up-and-down season, Stanford
finished a strong third to
qualify for Regionals, and
freshman Christian Cevaer
won the individual title.
This year, the team headed
into the Pac-lOs with a full
head of steam, having just won
its fourth tournament of the
year the weekend before
(setting a new team standard).
Another high finish was almost

Cardinal seventh
at Pac-lOs

assured, wasn't it?
It wasn't.
Neither Cevaer nor the Car
dinal measured up to their
1989 performances, although
the former admittedly made a
good run at it. The sophomore
from France shot 289 and
settled for an eighth-place tie,
while Stanford could manage
no better than seventh in the
four-round event.
"I figured somewhere between
third and seventh," Coach Wally
Goodwin said. "We've beaten
UCLA, Cal and Oregon before,
but we didn't this time."
As expected, No. 1-ranked and
host team Arizona State won the
tourney with sparkling 1418, 22
shots under par. The Sun Devils
had an individual round average
of 70.9. The second-place team,
Arizona, was 32 shots over par.
The Cardinal posted a 1507 total.
The local schools certainly had
the weather to their advantage.
Record temperatures of 97
degrees and blustery winds threw
many of the Cardinal golfers off
their games.
"The heat got to me ... it threw
my salts out of whack," said senior
Don Christensen, who shot a 306.
"It was frustrating. I wanted to
do better in my last Pac-10 tour
nament."
Cevaer, who has two more
chances at the event, started out
where he left off a year ago, shoot

ing a five-under-par 67 to tie for
third place going into Saturday s
36 holes. The format (18-36-18)
was unusual and a change from
last year's three round Pac-10
tournament. The change was not
to Stanford's liking.
"Arizona and Arizona State are
the golfing powers of the country,
and they decided to change it,"
Goodwin said. "I certainly didn't
vote for it."
Goodwin had his reasons. He
noted his team's penchant for
stumbling in the second 18 of a
double-round day, an affliction
which would rear its head once
again in Tempe. Cevaer faltered,
going 67-71-77, and seniors Mark
Funseth (73-76-79) and Christen
sen (75-72-81) met similar fates
in the round.
The exception was senior Steve
White, who had his best round
with a one-under 71. He came in
second among the Stanford gol
fers. "Steve White certainly
showed me something," Goodwin
noted.
Despite the disappointing
finish, the Cardinal is not worried
about qualifying for NCAA
Regionals. "We're definitely in,"
