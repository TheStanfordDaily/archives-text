# Recycling returns to pre-Earth Day levels
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
During the week leading up to Earth
Day, the recycling bins at Tresidder Union
were overflowing, and Stanford Recycling
Center workers were considering increasing
pick-up service from three to five days a
week.
Earth Day was celebrated last Sunday,
April 22. On Monday, April 23, the bins
at Tresidder were only half full — the level
of recycling during the middle of winter
quarter.
"It seemed like people were finally catch
ing on to the concept and aggressively recy
cling," said Barb Voss, recycling center
program coordinator.
But the 25 to 50 percent increase in
recycling of paper, glass and aluminum dur
ing Earth Woek did not last, said Voss,
who had hoped it was more than "just a
fad for the week."
The situation at Tresidder highlights
concerns over whether the mass mobiliza
tion of popular concern about the
environment during the international
celebration of Earth Day 1990 will have a
lasting effect.
During Earth Week, Voss said, people
were more conscientious about separating

their garbage. "But now that the media
pressure is off," contamination of recycling
bins with food and non-recyclable materials
has also returned to pre-Earth Week levels
at Tresidder.
"My feeling is that people put out a lot
of effort during Earth Week," Voss said.
"But people are forgetting very quickly
why it is important to recycle. . . . The
people who were recycling then didn't take
the changes to heart."
Overall, recycling at Stanford has
steadily increased over the last year. In
some areas, including the Medical Center,
recycling has continued to increase since
Earth Day. Because the pick-up trucks do
not have scales, statistics for the overall
effects of Earth Day on campus recycling
will not be available for two to three weeks.
Bob Abrams, coordinator of the Earth
Day environmental audit that is assessing
Stanford's environmental policies and
making recommendations, said he thought
local Earth Week events were quite suc
cessful.
However, he said, "You cannot expect a
large amount of information over a short
period of time to change habits people have
developed over the past 10,15, 20 years. ...
For things like a recycling program to be
successful, you need to have ongoing sup
port."
