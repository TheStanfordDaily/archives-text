# Trash removal switch arouses several critics
## Effects on environment questioned 
### Tammy Sun 
Stanford student environmen
talists claim the University is too
focused on the financial and
logistical aspects of waste disposal
and not concerned with the long
term environmental effects.
University officials deny the
charge, saying they are consider
ing all issues in their switch to a
new garbage contractor.
The University terminated its
dumping contract with Palo Alto
landfills in January due to a 68
percent cost increase. Now, the
University dumps its garbage on
a temporary basis at landfills
owned by a solid waste contractor,
Browning Ferris Industries.
Still involved in a complicated
and arduous evaluation process,
the University will soon have to
resolve the critical question of
what to do with its waste.
But sophomore Scott Veirs, a
member of Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford, said
his organization fears the Univer
sity will choose the most expedient
plan, regardless of environmental
impact. "The University is not
stressing the educational and so
cial benefits which would come
with having our own materials
recovery facility on campus,"
Veirs said.
"The real root of solid waste is
with consumer behavior, and if

we send away our wastes to be
disposed where it isn't seen, it
lessens the incentive for consum
ers to recycle," Veirs explained.
Presently, two long-term solu
tions for the fate of Stanford's
garbage face University officials.
The first option involves Waste
Management, a large waste con
tractor which offers to sort all of
Stanford's 20,000 annual tons of
garbage at its transfer and recy
cling facility — which is being
built in Sunnyvale — and dump
the remaining waste at its own
landfills in South San Jose.
The University's second option
is a proposal advanced by Penin
sula Sanitary Services, a family
owned operation which has been
involved in Stanford's waste dis
posal program for more than 30
years.
Peninsula Sanitary wants to
develop a small materials recovery
facility on campus where garbage
is sorted. Recyclable materials
could be recovered and taken to
a recycling center, while the
remaining non-recyclable garbage
would be hauled to a permanent
dump site operated by Browning
Ferris Industries.
While the University is at
tempting to incorporate as many
considerations as possible into its
decision, the main focus of its as-
sessment is centered on the finan
cial, legal and administrative
aspects of the two options.
"It's very attractive to have
Stanford's waste disposal taken
over by an outside contractor in
terms of ease and convenience, but
we lose potential flexibility and
control over potential future costs
if we do that," said Herb Fong,
a manager in Operations and
Maintenance, about Waste Man
agement's solution.
Nevertheless, the University
still finds the reliability of the
Waste Management option quite
appealing in light of the financial
risk involved in building an on
site disposal facility and the bur
den of meeting state-legislated
recycling demands.
Looming over considerations of
both proposals is the recently
passed California law mandating
a 25 percent recycling rate or
waste diversion in the overall
waste stream by 1995 and a 50
percent waste reduction by the

year 2000.
Although Waste Management's
contract promises an immediate
25 percent reduction of recyclable
waste, it has not guaranteed the
50 percent reduction required in
10 years, according to Fong. The
University is still negotiating the
details of Waste Managment's pro
posal.
"It's very important that we
consider the impact of California's
recycling legislation in our evalu
ation of these two options," Fong
said. "We are looking into whether
the 50 percent can be achieved by
Waste Management at all and
what that extra 25 percent will
cost the University."
Peninsula Sanitary is prepared
to meet the required 25 percent
recycling rate in five years, said
company vice president Louie Pel
ligrini. "I feel confident that with
Stanford's present recycling rate
of 17 percent, we can reach 25
percent within a year," said Pel
ligrini.
There is growing fear that the
University may arrive at a deci
sion based on purely business and
administrative considerations

without seriously weighing the so
cial and environmental aspects.
"The University is not thinking
ecologically, but along administra
tive lines of simply getting rid of
the waste in the quickest way pos
sible without looking to solve the
real social problems of a
throwaway mentality in our soci
ety," Veirs said.
"There needs to be more oppor
tunities for student input in the
University's decision-making
process and to ensure the Univer
sity isn't just making a business
decision about an environmental
issue," he said.
Barbara Voss, director of the
Stanford Recycling Center, also
foresees advantages with an on
campus recovery facility for recy
cling at Stanford. The Recycling
Center has been expanding by
about 35 to 40 percent each year,
and by this fall, it will reach peak
capacity if it does not receive more
equipment, Voss said.
"The Recycling Center would be
able to expand significantly with
an on-campus recovery facility be
cause we could share crucial
equipment and in effect, increase

our current recycling operations
without incurring additional cost
to the University," Voss ex
plained.
In addition, an on-site recovery
facility would allow the current
method of waste collection around
Stanford to be more cost-effective
and environmentally sound be
cause collection trucks would be
replaced less frequently and
propane trucks would be used,
which would be less damaging to
the environment, according to Pel
ligrini.
Although Voss acknowledges
the convenience of Waste Manage
ment's off-campus alternative, she
believes that, given the size of the
Stanford community and the
strength of the University's exist
ing recycling infrastructure, it
would be easy to achieve the man
dated 50 percent reduction.
The University hopes to have
an answer on the future of Stan
ford's waste management in the
next month, according to Fong.
"No one seems to want to make
the decision," Pelligrini said. "I'm
afraid the decision might be made
by indecision."

member of Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford, said
his organization fears the Univer
sity will choose the most expedient
plan, regardless of environmental
impact. "The University is not
stressing the educational and so
cial benefits which would come
with having our own materials
recovery facility on campus,"
Veirs said.
"The real root of solid waste is
with consumer behavior, and if

we send away our wastes to be
disposed where it isn't seen, it
lessens the incentive for consum
ers to recycle," Veirs explained.
Presently, two long-term solu
tions for the fate of Stanford's
garbage face University officials.
The first option involves Waste
Management, a large waste con
tractor which offers to sort all of
Stanford's 20,000 annual tons of
garbage at its transfer and recy
cling facility — which is being
built in Sunnyvale — and dump
the remaining waste at its own
landfills in South San Jose.
The University's second option
is a proposal advanced by Penin
sula Sanitary Services, a family
owned operation which has been
involved in Stanford's waste dis
posal program for more than 30
years.
Peninsula Sanitary wants to
develop a small materials recovery
facility on campus where garbage
is sorted. Recyclable materials
could be recovered and taken to
a recycling center, while the
remaining non-recyclable garbage
would be hauled to a permanent
dump site operated by Browning
Ferris Industries.
While the University is at
tempting to incorporate as many
considerations as possible into its
decision, the main focus of its as-
sessment is centered on the finan
cial, legal and administrative
aspects of the two options.
"It's very attractive to have
Stanford's waste disposal taken
over by an outside contractor in
terms of ease and convenience, but
we lose potential flexibility and
control over potential future costs
if we do that," said Herb Fong,
a manager in Operations and
Maintenance, about Waste Man
agement's solution.
Nevertheless, the University
still finds the reliability of the
Waste Management option quite
appealing in light of the financial
risk involved in building an on
site disposal facility and the bur
den of meeting state-legislated
recycling demands.
Looming over considerations of
both proposals is the recently
passed California law mandating
a 25 percent recycling rate or
waste diversion in the overall
waste stream by 1995 and a 50
percent waste reduction by the

year 2000.
Although Waste Management's
contract promises an immediate
25 percent reduction of recyclable
waste, it has not guaranteed the
50 percent reduction required in
10 years, according to Fong. The
University is still negotiating the
details of Waste Managment's pro
posal.
"It's very important that we
consider the impact of California's
recycling legislation in our evalu
ation of these two options," Fong
said. "We are looking into whether
the 50 percent can be achieved by
Waste Management at all and
what that extra 25 percent will
cost the University."
Peninsula Sanitary is prepared
to meet the required 25 percent
recycling rate in five years, said
company vice president Louie Pel
ligrini. "I feel confident that with
Stanford's present recycling rate
of 17 percent, we can reach 25
percent within a year," said Pel
ligrini.
There is growing fear that the
University may arrive at a deci
sion based on purely business and
administrative considerations

without seriously weighing the so
cial and environmental aspects.
"The University is not thinking
ecologically, but along administra
tive lines of simply getting rid of
the waste in the quickest way pos
sible without looking to solve the
real social problems of a
throwaway mentality in our soci
ety," Veirs said.
"There needs to be more oppor
tunities for student input in the
University's decision-making
process and to ensure the Univer
sity isn't just making a business
decision about an environmental
issue," he said.
Barbara Voss, director of the
Stanford Recycling Center, also
foresees advantages with an on
campus recovery facility for recy
cling at Stanford. The Recycling
Center has been expanding by
about 35 to 40 percent each year,
and by this fall, it will reach peak
capacity if it does not receive more
equipment, Voss said.
"The Recycling Center would be
able to expand significantly with
an on-campus recovery facility be
cause we could share crucial
equipment and in effect, increase

our current recycling operations
without incurring additional cost
to the University," Voss ex
plained.
In addition, an on-site recovery
facility would allow the current
method of waste collection around
Stanford to be more cost-effective
and environmentally sound be
cause collection trucks would be
replaced less frequently and
propane trucks would be used,
which would be less damaging to
the environment, according to Pel
ligrini.
Although Voss acknowledges
the convenience of Waste Manage
ment's off-campus alternative, she
believes that, given the size of the
Stanford community and the
strength of the University's exist
ing recycling infrastructure, it
would be easy to achieve the man
dated 50 percent reduction.
The University hopes to have
an answer on the future of Stan
ford's waste management in the
next month, according to Fong.
"No one seems to want to make
the decision," Pelligrini said. "I'm
afraid the decision might be made
by indecision."
Stanford student environmen
talists claim the University is too
focused on the financial and
logistical aspects of waste disposal
and not concerned with the long
term environmental effects.
University officials deny the
charge, saying they are consider
ing all issues in their switch to a
new garbage contractor.
The University terminated its
dumping contract with Palo Alto
landfills in January due to a 68
percent cost increase. Now, the
University dumps its garbage on
a temporary basis at landfills
owned by a solid waste contractor,
Browning Ferris Industries.
Still involved in a complicated
and arduous evaluation process,
the University will soon have to
resolve the critical question of
what to do with its waste.

member of Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford, said

sity will choose the most expedient
