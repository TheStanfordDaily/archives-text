# Trash removal switch arouses several critics
## Effects on environment questioned

Stanford student environmen
talists claim the University is too
focused on the financial and
logistical aspects of waste disposal
and not concerned with the long
term environmental effects.
University officials deny the
charge, saying they are consider
ing all issues in their switch to a
new garbage contractor.
The University terminated its
dumping contract with Palo Alto
landfills in January due to a 68
percent cost increase. Now, the
University dumps its garbage on
a temporary basis at landfills
owned by a solid waste contractor,
Browning Ferris Industries.
Still involved in a complicated
and arduous evaluation process,
the University will soon have to
resolve the critical question of
what to do with its waste.
But sophomore Scott Veirs, a
member of Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford, said
his organization fears the Univer
sity will choose the most expedient
plan, regardless of environmental
impact. "The University is not
stressing the educational and so
cial benefits which would come
with having our own materials
recovery facility on campus,"
Veirs said.
"The real root of solid waste is
with consumer behavior, and if

we send away our wastes to be
disposed where it isn't seen, it
lessens the incentive for consum
ers to recycle," Veirs explained.
Presently, two long-term solu
tions for the fate of Stanford's
garbage face University officials.
The first option involves Waste
Management, a large waste con
tractor which offers to sort all of
Stanford's 20,000 annual tons of
garbage at its transfer and recy
cling facility — which is being
built in Sunnyvale — and dump
the remaining waste at its own
landfills in South San Jose.
The University's second option
is a proposal advanced by Penin
sula Sanitary Services, a family
owned operation which has been
involved in Stanford's waste dis
posal program for more than 30
years.
Peninsula Sanitary wants to
develop a small materials recovery
facility on campus where garbage
is sorted. Recyclable materials
could be recovered and taken to
a recycling center, while the
remaining non-recyclable garbage
would be hauled to a permanent
dump site operated by Browning
Ferris Industries.
While the University is at
tempting to incorporate as many
considerations as possible into its
decision, the main focus of its as-
