# Shak to be sacked
## Band's 'home' facing demolition 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Besides the Chaparral office,
the Band Shak is perhaps the
only campus building that es
caped virtually unharmed and
perhaps a little cleaner as a
result of the Oct. 17 earth
quake.
Despite this, the University
declared lar.t week that the
Shak is structurally unsound
and will be replaced in the next
few years. This news has many
Stanford Band members sur
prised and upset.
The Shak has a personality
all its own, Band members say.
Junior Tammy Voss described
it as "unique." Other Band
members called it "different,"
"special," "a home away from
home" and "neo-apocalyptic."
Whatever adjective they used,
Band members interviewed
agreed that it will be difficult
adjusting to a new building.
For Band members, the Shak
is a place to be wild and crazy.
Coterminal student Greg
Louden called the Shak a place
"where you can switch per
sonae ... you can let loose and
do anything."
Senior Jon Sherman, a
former manager of the Band,
agreed that "you can treat it
any way you like and no one
will yell at you." Sophomore
Eric Selvik added that the Shak

is "a fun place to hang out
because there are no rules."
A lack of concern for neat
ness and order seems to be in
trinsic to the Shak's unique
character. Senior Mike Conte
feels that there is a certain
"niceness in having a place
where you don't have to worry
about spilling anything."
Sherman called the Shak
"really gross" but added that
"you learn to love it."
Senior Jennifer Hansen dis
closed that there are "strange
creatures crawling around."
Hansen added that about throe
feet of broken glass are collec
ted under the Shak's "bottle
target."
In addition to the feeling
that, as Hansen put it,"it will
take a while to get [a new Shak]
as dirty and cluttered as it
needs to be," there is concern
that a new building will mean
the end to old traditions.
One such tradition is
"grovel," which takes place
after Big Game. During grovel.
Band members destroy things
which they have built during
the week prior to Big Game.
Structures ranging from an
"alto hut" for alto saxophone
players to volcanoes have been
built and subsequently
destroyed.
Band members are doubtful
