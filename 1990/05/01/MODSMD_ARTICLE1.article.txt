Ending a yearlong dispute over the fate
of Ohlone Indian skeletal remains, the Uni
versity returned about 300 skeletal remains
and burial artifacts to tribe members yes
terday.
The controversial agreement to return
the remains, which was reached last June,
touched off a nationwide debate over the
use of Indian skeletal remains. The debate
has focused on whether Native American
skeletal remains should be used for aca
demic purposes or be returned to tribes
for reburial in recognition of religious prac

The transfer of the remains to Ohlone
community representatives took place at
noon at the Stanford Museum, when boxes
filled with the remains were loaded into a
University truck for delivery to the East
Bay Regional Parks District. The Parks
District will designate an official site where
the bones will be reinterred.
University archeologist Barbara Bocek
coordinated the loading of the boxes. She
and Ohlone representatives said when the
agreement was made that they were very
pleased with the University's decision to

respect the religious rights of the Ohlones.
However, not all those affected by the
University's decision to restore the Ohlone
remains to burial grounds are pleased with
the outcome.
Andrew Galvan, claiming to represent
700 Ohlones, said his group endorses the
academics who want to hold on to the
remains for further study.
Bert Gerow, an emeritus professor of
anthropology who excavated Ohlone re
mains in the Bay Area from the early 1950s
until the 19705, chastised Bocek and the
University for the "loss of an irreplaceable
collection."
Much of Gerow's collection, which he
gathered between 1959 and 1969 at Ryan
Mound in Fremont with the help of Stan
ford and San Jose State University stu
dents, is currently at San Jose State and
was not part of the remains returned to
the Ohlones yesterday.
The agreement, however, also stipulates
that the Ryan Mound collection will be
returned to Ohlone representatives on April
30, 1991.
