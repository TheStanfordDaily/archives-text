# University transfers remains to Ohlones
## 
### Jeannie Heltzel Staff writer 
Ending a yearlong dispute over the fate
of Ohlone Indian skeletal remains, the Uni
versity returned about 300 skeletal remains
and burial artifacts to tribe members yes
terday.
The controversial agreement to return
the remains, which was reached last June,
touched off a nationwide debate over the
use of Indian skeletal remains. The debate
has focused on whether Native American
skeletal remains should be used for aca
demic purposes or be returned to tribes
for reburial in recognition of religious prac
tice.
The transfer of the remains to Ohlone
community representatives took place at
noon at the Stanford Museum, when boxes
filled with the remains were loaded into a
University truck for delivery to the East
Bay Regional Parks District. The Parks
District will designate an official site where
the bones will be reinterred.
University archeologist Barbara Bocek
coordinated the loading of the boxes. She
and Ohlone representatives said when the
agreement was made that they were very
pleased with the University's decision to

respect the religious rights of the Ohlones.
However, not all those affected by the
University's decision to restore the Ohlone
remains to burial grounds are pleased with
the outcome.
Andrew Galvan, claiming to represent
700 Ohlones, said his group endorses the
academics who want to hold on to the
remains for further study.
Bert Gerow, an emeritus professor of
anthropology who excavated Ohlone re
mains in the Bay Area from the early 1950s
until the 19705, chastised Bocek and the
University for the "loss of an irreplaceable
collection."
Much of Gerow's collection, which he
gathered between 1959 and 1969 at Ryan
Mound in Fremont with the help of Stan
ford and San Jose State University stu
dents, is currently at San Jose State and
was not part of the remains returned to
the Ohlones yesterday.
The agreement, however, also stipulates
that the Ryan Mound collection will be
returned to Ohlone representatives on April
30, 1991.
Further, in a press release yesterday,
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, repre-
senting 143 members of the Stan
ford chapter of the American As
sociation of University Professors,
decried the University's "basically
flawed" decision to return the Oh
lone remains.
While Arrow acknowledged that
the University "acted in good
faith" in recognizing the conflict
between the "scientific value of
additional study and the religious

beliefs of the Ohlone" with regard
to burial, he questioned the Uni
versity's consideration of the
"serious consequences" of giving
up the remains.
Both Gerow and Arrow recog
nized the value of the Ohlone re
mains for the creation of a usable
past for the Native American com
munity.
In addition, Arrow stated that
in the University's "significant in
cursion into academic restraint,"
it has chosen to "compromise the
ability of its faculty to conduct

research without touching on es
tablished human and religious
rights."
Walter Falcon, head of the
campus archeaology committee,
representing the University;
Rosemary Cambra, Jean-Marie
Feyling, Linda Yamane, Jakki
Kehl and Jenny McLeod, repre
senting the Ohlone People; and
Larry Meyers, executive director
of the California State Native
American Heritage Association,
participated in the signing of the
