# Econ prof. to receive Japan's highest honor
## 
### Katherine Toy Staff writer 
For his contributions to the
scholarly discipline of the yen and
the dollar, Economics Prof.
Masahiko Aoki will receive
Japan's highest academic honor.
Receiving the Japan Academy
Prize, awarded each year by the
emperor to 10 outstanding schol
ars, is the pinnacle of Aoki's very
distinguished career. He is receiv
ing it for his books "The Cooper
ative Game Theory of the Firm"
and "Information, Incentives and
Bargaining in the Japanese Econ
omy."
Aoki developed many of the
ideas presented in these works
while teaching undergraduate stu
dents at Stanford. "It's nice to
receive a prize for the outcome of
these courses," he says.
The prize was established 70
years ago by the Meiji Emperor
to be awarded annually to 10
scholars. Although the Academy
recognizes achievement in all
scholarly disciplines, most prizes
are given in the natural sciences,
with only a few awarded in the
social sciences and humanities.

Aoki says he is honored by his
selection, but also is surprised.
Recipients are often "very old,
usually in their 70s or 80s," ex
plains the professor, now in hia
early 50s.
Aoki completed his bachelor's
and master's degrees in economics
at the University of Tokyo before
coming to the United States and
the University of Minnesota for
his doctorate.
Upon finishing his degree at
Minnesota in 1967, Aoki was of
fered positions at both Stanford
and Harvard. He chose Stanford
because of the opportunity to
work with Economics Prof. Ken
neth Arrow.
Ironically, Arrow accepted a po
sition with the Economics Depart
ment at Harvard the following
year, and Aoki soon followed suit.
"At the time, my allegiance was
more to Professor Arrow than to
Stanford," Aoki says.
In 1984, Stanford created an
endowed professorship for the
study of the Japanese economy,
and Aoki returned to accept the
position.
Since 1969, he has also held a
position with the University of

Kyoto. He recently returned from
a two-year stay in that city. â€¢
In addition to teaching, Aoki
worked to establish the Stanford
in Japan Center in Kyoto, which
opened this quarter.
Aoki visited more than 100 com
panies seeking financial support
for the new center. About 70 have
donated funds, including Japan's

top 10 firms.
But the public sector wes not
quite as obliging, according to
Aoki. The center needed the ap
proval of the Japanese Ministries
of Justice, Finance and Educa
tion. The number of bureaucratic
procedures involved in the center's
creation were "amazing," he says.
Fortunately, Aoki's task was
facilitated by friends in these
agencies.
The experience made him
realize "how problematic and dif
ficult it is for U.S. businesses to
penetrate the Japanese market
without contacts," he adds.
Despite his fondness for the
Kyoto program, Aoki is moving
on to new projects. He jokingly
calls himself a venture entrepre
neur. "I like creating new things,
but once it's done, I like others
to manage it."
Aoki's latest venture is to help
the Economics Department create
a graduate program in compara
tive economic systems. He says
this is an important field, espe
cially with Eastern Europe
opening up.
