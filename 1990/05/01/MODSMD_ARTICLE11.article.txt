Students discuss
defaced fliers
Concerned residents of Quil
len House in Escondido Village
met last night with a Univer
sity administrator to discuss
their reactions to the fliers
defaced last week with racial
comments.
The meeting was attended by
graduate housing director Jean
Kim, the two graduate resident
assistants and five other resi
dents of Quillen.
The fliers, which advertised
a support group for Asian-
Americans of multiracial des
cent, were defaced with com
ments about the "chaotic be
havior" that leads to children
of mixed race.
Kim said the incident shows
the need to begin a dialogue to
address the issue of interracial
couples and children of multi
racial descent.
Naomi Williams, a graduate
student who posted the fliers,
said she was frustrated and an

gered that there appeared to
be very little she could do to
respond to the comments.

Tiananmen
retrospective
Almost a year after the mas
sacre, American and Chinese
students at Stanford are
seeking to make people aware
again of what happened last
spring in China.
This Friday, an American
who has visited Beijing will
present her perspective of the
student movement there.
Valerie Samson, a teaching as
sociate at UCLA, was studying
in Beijing during the height of
last year's student protests.
Samson videotaped the activ
ities of her schoolmates, pro
viding a more personal view of
the everyday life of student
protesters. Her film will be
shown in the Meyer Library
forum room at 8 p.m.
