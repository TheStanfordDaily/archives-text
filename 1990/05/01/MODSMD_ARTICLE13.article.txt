DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) â€” Ameri
can hostage Frank Reed was freed yes
terday after being held for more than
three "lonely .. . boring" years, much
of the time blindfolded, by Shiite Mos
lem kidnappers in Lebanon. He was
the second American freed in nine
days.
"I'd like to tell my family, especially
my son Tarek, that his daddy is well.
He is a little skinny, but he will be
home very soon," the 57-year-old ed
ucator from Maiden, Mass., told state
run Syrian TV after his release.
Reed was freed in Beirut at 8:30
p.m. (11:30 p.m. PDT), Syrian officials
said, and was driven to the Syrian
capital, where U.S. Ambassador Ed
ward Djerejian was waiting to greet
him at the Foreign Ministry.
President Bush hailed Reed's release
as Bush welcomed former hostage
Robert Polhill to the White House.
Polhill, another U.S. educator, was
freed in Lebanon on April 22 after 39
months in captivity. Bush thanked
Syria and Iran for their help in secur
ing the releases and said "things seem
to be moving," but that there could
be no rest "until all hostages are free."
There are still 16 Westerners, in
cluding six Americans, held hostage in
Lebanon.
The Iranian newspaper, Tehran
Times, said today that unless Wash
ington answers the latest releases with
goodwill gestures, no more Americans
will go free.
Reed appeared pale and smoked a
cigarette after his release.
At a briefing at the ministry, he
said he could not answer some ques
tions out of concern for the other
hostages: "I do not want to say any
thing that could harm them."
The freed captive appeared in rea
sonable health. He was clean shaven,
and wore a dark suit and a blue tie.
His voice was husky.
He said he hoped "the other
hostages" will be freed soon, but would

not say if he saw any of them in
captivity. However, Reed referred to
"we" while describing the conditions
of his captivity.
"We had adequate fresh food and
the opportunity to bathe and shower
and given clean clothes," he said.
Asked earlier on TV what captivity
was like, he replied, "It was lonely. It
was boring. ... I'm very happy to be
free . . . and I hope my fellow hostages
will be freed very soon."
"No one ever said why I was taken.
The bottom line was, I was an Amer
ican."
Reed spoke haltingly at times, his
eyes downcast. "I haven't talked
much" as a hostage, he explained. "I
feel I'm well in terms of the basic
organs I have in my body."
He said he did not hold the Lebanese
people responsible for his ordeal and
that "I want to thank the Syrian gov
ernment for all their efforts in helping
me become a free man."
He said he was blindfolded 24 hours
a day during much of his captivity.
"I hope, Godspeed, that my col
leagues . . . somehow will be released
soon," he concluded.
In Beirut, Reed was handed to of
ficers of the Syrian army contingent
that controls east and north Lebanon
as well as Moslem west Beirut, where
Reed was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986,
said the Syrian officials, who refused
to be identified.
They refused to say exactly where
the release occurred. Journalists at the
Summerland Hotel in Beirut, where
previous hostages were released, said
they did not see Reed.
The English-language Tehran Times
said in an editorial yesterday, "Release
of two American hostages without any
preconditions and solely for humani
tarian and Islamic causes was an ex
treme gesture of good will and self
sacrifice by Lebanese Moslem groups."
