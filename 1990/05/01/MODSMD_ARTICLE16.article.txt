are in, and the message is

nities "at best fair." This seems
inappropriate for the institution at
which University President Donald
Kennedy recently declared his com
mitment to undergraduate teach
ing.
However, it is not simply a
shortcoming of the faculty. Many
students feel too intimidated to en
ter the offices of their professors.
Yet faculty members must begin
to communicate that they are open
to students and welcome to inter
action. The message inside the

classroom must encourage the out
side interaction that is sorely
needed.
One way in which the University,
as an institution, can elicit such
behavior is to provide more under
graduate research scholarships.
History Assoc. Prof. Kennell Jack
son has set an excellent example
of this in the African and Afro-
American Studies Department.
A small amount of money can
go a long way toward stimulating
interaction and producing quality
research.
There are many ways in which
the University can work to improve
faculty-student relations.
It is important to act now, how
ever, so that the sentiments of this
year's graduating class do not go
unheard.
