THANKS TO THE Stanford
Central America Action Net
work, the Stanford commu
nity is taking a dramatic excursion
into the realm of political repres
sion.
The power of guerrilla theater
lies in its ability to provide a bridge
for understanding different — and
perhaps disturbing — experiences
and situations by bringing them
to life.
With Project Awareness, SCAAN
is indeed bringing the tactics and
effects of fascist governments to
life. In this first stage of the dra
matic simulation, tactics can be
targeted at anyone; no one is safe.
By involving students, faculty and
staff from various sectors of the
campus community, Project
Awareness reflects the grim and
frightening reality of political re
pression.
Project Awareness will hopefully
give people a small sampling of the

political repression that is a daily
reality for many people around the
world, particularly in El Salvador.
Project Awareness is a major
dramatic and educational endeav
or. While the performance will no
doubt be compelling, SCAAN has
responsibly ensured that it will not
be terrorizing. Through a highly
publicized campaign, SCAAN is
making it clear that its dramatic
simulation is just that: a simula
tion.
Last year, some of SCAAN's
staged kidnappings were so realis
tic that they prompted students to
come to the aid of the "victims"
and call the campus police. By ex
tensively publicizing this year's ac
tivity, SCAAN avoids problems
arising from a situation where art
imitates life too closely.
Stanford students are again
showing their initiative in provid
ing a significant part of the edu
cation on campus.
