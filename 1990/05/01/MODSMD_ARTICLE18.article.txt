ASSU course contradicts commitment to awareness

AS A MEMBER of the Stanford
community and a consultant to
the Cowell Health Promotion
Program, I feel compelled to express
my concern over the ASSU-sponsored
Bartending 101 class.
I am not necessarily opposed to the
existence of courses which provide
training for Stanford students in
marketable trade skills, such as bar
tending. What I find disturbing is the
apparently cavalier attitude taken by
the instructor of the course toward
alcoholic beverages and the responsibil
ities of the server.
This person's attitude is not particu
larly surprising, given his background
involving a parent who "would come
home from work and ask his 7-year-old
kid to fix him a drink." I am therefore
particularly disappointed that the

ASSU, which has been committed to
the movement to reduce alcohol-related
problems on campus, has hired such
an irresponsible person to teach the
course and has neglected to include
professional training in responsible
hospitality as a major component.
It must be painfully obvious to
anyone who is even remotely aware of
current events, or even events just here
at Stanford, that alcohol-related ir
responsibility is the cause of much
tragedy and near tragedy. According to
the Special Services Unit of Stanford
Public Safety, 75 percent of men and
55 percent of women involved in an
acquaintance rape are under the influ
ence of alcohol.
Over half of teenage motor vehicle
deaths directly involve alcohol. Sixty
nine percent of drownings and 36

percent of all pedestrian deaths directly
involve alcohol.
Stanford has experienced these prob
lems first-hand. Several years ago, a
Stanford student left a fraternity party
highly intoxicated and, on the way
home, drowned in Lake Lagunita. Just
this year, an intoxicated freshman
barely escaped death or serious injury
when he wandered in front of a mov
ing vehicle after another campus party.
Problems related to alcohol are deadly
serious â€” and the tone apparently
taken in ASSU Bartending 101 is
completely inappropriate.
I strongly urge the ASSU special
projects director to coordinate the
inclusion of progressive server training,
such as that provided by the Responsi
ble Hospitality Council, in the course
being taught now. Techniques referred

to as "server intervention training,"
include significant attention to the
effects of alcohol on the body, how to
calculate the number of alcoholic
drinks various sized people can con
sume before reaching legal intoxication,
how to tell if a customer is intoxicated
and how to handle an intoxicated
person gracefully.
Any student who wishes to obtain
information on programs and services
related to alcohol and drug eduction
should contact Louise Miller of the
Health Promotion Program at Cowell
Student Health Center. I further sug
gest that the ASSU be more careful
when screening instructors for future
courses of this sort.
