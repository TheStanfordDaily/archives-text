# Freshman writing program is practical as well as academic
## 
### 
The Daily's thoughtful April 25 edi
torial on the Community Service Writ
ing project notes some advantages of
"real world" writing assignments; it
also raises some valid concerns about
an apparent dichotomy between "practi
cal writing" and "traditional academic
analysis and crittism."
At the heart of this issue lie the
goals of freshman writing: learning to
write clear, cogent, persuasive prose,
developing sound research methods and
critical thinking and learning to write
for a variety of audiences, in a variety
of disciplines. These are also the goals
of community service writing.
I would suggest that the above
categories, "practical" and "academic,"
are neither distinct nor mutually exclu

sive; lab notes, for example, are practi
cal and academic. As you noted, what
shifts, or expands, is the audience: The
student's instructor reads and critiques
the analysis — and so does the agency
director who needs the analysis.
Your concern about reading and
critiquing literature can be answered
in several ways. First of all, in a typi
cal two-quarter Freshman English
class, students may write some 10-15
essays. As the courses are now struc
tured, generally no more than one or
two assignments would entail commu
nity service writing.
Further, Freshman English is a writ
ing course rather than a literature
course. Literary texts are included in
many courses as a basis for writing
and discussion, however, and this con
nection — of literature and public
service — can foster an ideal learning
situation.
Consider, for example, a course of
Charles Dickens with public service,
with the community work informing,

illuminating, and providing a context
for the textual and social analyses.
Those chilling words to the homeless
Jo in Bleak House, "Move on, move
on," may touch one all the more
deeply in the context of community
work and careful reflection.
