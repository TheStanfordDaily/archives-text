# 'Four Our Future' ensures students are top priority
## 
### 
Congratulations to "Four Our Fu
ture" for winning the COP race and
running such a clean election. Even
though you did not capture a majority
of the votes, you clearly had the stu
dents' best interests in mind from the

start. The people are always number
one on your list, which is why you are
called the People's Platform.
As COP member Ingrid Nava said,
"We should try to forge unity by more
productive means (than a runoff)." The
idea of a runoff does sound a bit
riduculous. Didn't the ASSU Sen
ate/People's Platform already certify
the results of the election?
Doesn't the Students First slate
realize that a runoff election would
cost the student body $5,000? I'm glad
that "Four Our Future" is on the stu
dents' side. After all, $5,000 does seem
an awfully high price to pay for de
mocracy. Then again, who's counting?
