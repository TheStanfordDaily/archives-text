## No legitimacy, integrity 
### 
THE TOMFOOLERY that accompa
nied this year's — and every year's
— ASSU elections speaks volumes
for the legitimacy of Stanford student
government and the integrity of its in
stitutions.
In my four years at Stanford, there
have been more ASSU shenanigans than
most of us care to remember. The ques
tionable appropriation of ASSU funds is
a problem that never seems to go away.
The accessing of money from the Council
of Presidents' discretionary fund to bail
out protesters from last May's takeover
is the most recent and notorious example
of this. The bending of the ASSU Bylaws
is a common practice.
But it is the predictably screwed-up
elections which really undercut the
legitimacy of the ASSU. At a first-rate,
pluralistic university, we can do no better
than to conduct elections worthy of a
Third World country.
The widespread dissatisfaction with the
ASSU itself was manifested in the incon
clusive COP race, where the People's
Platform slate "Four Our Future"
managed to win the election without ob
taining a majority. The Elections Com
mission took care of that minor
inconvenience by throwing out the write
in ballots cast for neither mcyor slate
that would have denied a majority for
"Four Our Future."
Despite the fact that the COP slate
must obtain "a mtyority of the Associa
tion voting in the elections," the Elections
Commissioner decided that runoffs are
possible only when there is "serious doubt
about the student body's ability to reg

ister its opinion fairly and decisively."
It is clear that this election was not
decisive. While we may wish for decisive
ness, we cannot make it so through ad
ministrative fiat.
By eliminating all the votes for neither
slate, the ASSU of course obtains a
majority, but this manufactured result is
simply unsatisfactory.
Elections Commissioner Steve Krauss
justifies his ruling under the mantle of
"broad interpretation," but again, if the
commissioner reserves the right to
stretch the meaning of the Bylaws with
out definable limits, then any ruling must
necessarily fall under "broad interpreta
tion." It would seem that the commis
sioner's power is its own justification.
The commission makes a capricious
ruling in finding that votes for ineligible
candidates are equivalent to "incorrectly
marked" ballots, which are ineligible bal
lots. But in doing so, the ASSU has ef
fectively eliminated the write-in vote, as
most write-ins are for neither mqjor slate,
and hence, ineligible.
Moreover, write-in votes are most fun
damentally protest votes, voices of dis
satisfaction. In declaring such votes
illegitimate, the Elections Commission
and the ASSU err on two counts.
First of all, they fail to realize that
voting has more than one purpose, and
deciding a winner is only one of them.
The protest vote has a long tradition in
all liberal-democratic states; the voter
must have the option to reject the choices
presented him. In effect, the ASSU has
demanded and assured for itself a facade
of legitimacy by eliminating all votes of

dissatisfaction.
Secondly, it sets a dangerous precedent
by examining the motives of voters. The
main objection to the Teenage Mutant
Nipja Turtles was that the voters could
not have known for whom they were
voting. Proof of serious intent is not a
prerequisite for voting.
While we all may be sick and tired of
the ASSU follies, the unfortunate fact is
that students have a compelling
$25/ quarter reason to see that the arbi
trary use of power does not happen again.
The Bylaws must be revamped and
purged of their chronic ambiguity. Most
importantly, a judiciary branch ought to
be created to abjudicate disputes and to
apply some checks to the senate's power
to control elections.
The fundamental problem is one of
conflict of interest; the legislative branch
must decide a dispute where one of the
parties involved is the party which con
trols the senate.
It is as if we have put the fox in charge
of guarding the hen house. How can we
expect objectivity?
