In these 11 short stories, Pulitzer Prize-winner
John Hersey draws upon his tremendous breadth
of experience as a journalist and writer to produce
a diverse collection that comes across well with his
fluent, insightful style.
The title story captures the mood of the collection
in some ways. It is based on recollection, on life
once lived and this too, from a perspective of the
past.
It is set in the Kennedy era of the early '60s. At
the heart of it is Venus, wife and companion of the
wealthy socialite Philip. Hersey assumes the mantle
of the aging, mortal lady with some skill. His words
lend an appropriate feel to the setting in the south
western United States, where their last fling is
fated to be. Venus feels, "This really is Sandman's
land, but at night he doesn't sprinkle my eyes, he
grits my teeth."
In a land where "the heat waves come whispering
around like a flock of Mediterranean beggars that
won't go away," Venus and Philip draw interest to
themselves as they live in their wealthy, luxurious
past. All through the story she is moving effectively
in the other direction — toward "one last fling. I
mean, when you live with a man who lets live, it
all has a rampant feeling, headlong, estral, tropical."
But Venus' aspirations could be more than just a
creation of pure fiction — as a septuagenarian him
self, Hersey's viewpoint assumes greater signifi
cance.
Some of his other stories show a hint of vintage
Somerset Maugham. "God's Typhoon" and "Why
Were You Sent Out Here?" are set in the Southeast
Asia that Maugham thrived in, while "Peggy's Parcel
Of Shortcomings" has a plump female pastry chef
who brings to mind Maugham's "The Three Fat
Women Of Antibes" and the lady in "The Luncheon."

Hersey melts into the plot with
great deftness. His endings open
up a branch of possibilities, never
standing completely firm on any
one.

Hersey also incorporates some of the Englishman's
mastery over transient images in these stories.
Some of his stories, including "Why Were You
Sent Out Here?" and "Blouse" have Hersey treading
the circular path of destiny with subtle, gentle steps.
The characters in these stories are vastly different,
as are their surroundings, but they both rely on a
shift in their own perception, which Hersey melts
into the plot with great deftness. His endings open
up a branch of possibilities, never standing com
pletely firm on any one.
In"The Terrorist," Hersey experiments with a
new form — short story as descriptive comic strip.
He fills the story with comic strip geometry, angular
descriptions and thought bubbles that are immedi
ately identifiable. Well, not entirely. Because once
again, his creation, The Iron Guerrilla, is "living"
in a past time — this time it is the late '60s of
Nixon. Although that is a slight drawback, his
humour and rapid-fire, spunky writing leaves it
more than readable.
Hersey has used his years and maturity well in
this collection and has shown he has a wide reper
toire of knowledge outside the journalistic field. At
times his reference frame feels, if not dated, at least
something that younger readers cannot immediately
have direct experience with. But overall, the book
stands out in its merits as a work which contains
thoughtful recollection from an author who ap
proaches his stories in a thoughtful, well-balanced
manner.
