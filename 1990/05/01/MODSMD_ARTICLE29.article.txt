## Texas fireballer Sepeda brings will to win to Cardinal Freshman overcomes chest injury, gives added depth to bullpen 
### Brad Cleveringa 
The dormitory room wall of
Jamie Sepeda, freshman pitcher
for the second-ranked Stanford
Cardinal, is surprisingly void of
posters of baseball greats. Instead
it is adorned with a picture of
Albert Einstein, with a caption
that reads, "Great spirits have al
ways found violent opposition
from mediocrities."
During his last start on April
23, Sepeda's great winning spirit
met the violent mediocrity of
Stanislaus State (20-24). The
Stanislaus batsmen touched him
up for five earned runs, including
three longballs, in three and two
thirds innings. This was out of
character for Sepeda, who had
compiled a 4.73 ERA in 32Vb in
nings and, according to Coach
Mark Marquess, is one of the pre
mier young pitchers in the coun
try.
Some pitchers might have got
ten down on themselves after the
terrible outing against Stanislaus,
but Sepeda just got mad. Some
of his dormmates expressed the
fact that he is a real competitor
and absolutely hates to lose, even
at IM basketball. "Once you start
losing, it doesn't matter," Sepeda
said. "I try to win at everything
1 do. I hate losing."
The freshman from Sinton
High School (Texas) has always
possessed the great winning spirit
that coaches desire. He was
recruited by five Top-20 teams,
including No. 1-ranked Miami,
and was drafted in the eighth
round by the Chicago Cubs in the
1989 league baseball draft.
It wasn't without reason.
During his high school career
with Sinton, Sepeda compiled a
55-4 record, 800 strikeouts, 6 no
hitters, two state championships

and an ERA of 0.60 his senior
year. He racked up a list of awards
that is equally impressive. Sepeda
was named Texas Player of the
Year (twice), First Team All-State
(three times) and High School Ail-
American (only once).
Along with the rest of America,
Coach Marquess was after the
young 6-foot-2, 195-pound hard
throwing righthander. "He
throws 90 mph, and he always
wins," Marquess said. "Back-to
back state champion and a good
arm is a great combination.
Sepeda is what we were looking
for."
Sepeda is what a lot of top col
lege baseball programs are looking
for, and he probably would have
received a full scholarship at one
of the other four universities. But
like many Stanford athletes, the
pitcher with the 1380 SAT score
chose Stanford because of "the
education."
The first game of the season,
Sepeda displayed his winning at
titude for his West Coast admirers
by coming on in relief of starter
Stan Spencer and shutting out
Santa Clara for the final three
innings.
Five days after recording his
first save, the Texas native shut

'He throws 90 mph, and he always wins,'
Coach Mark Marquess said. 'Sepeda is
what we were looking for.' Sepeda is
what a lot of top college baseball pro
grams are looking for, and he probably
would have received a full scholarship
at one of four other universities. But like
many Stanford athletes, the pitcher with
the 1380 SAT score chose Stanford
because of the education.

down the University of San Fran
cisco to earn his first college win
It seemed as if he was going to
tear up the NCAA like he did the
high school leagues, but then the
dreadful happened. He pulled a
chest muscle, a freak pitcher's in
jury, in early February against
Cal-State Fullerton, and his prog
ress as a collegiate pitcher tem
porarily slowed.
"He has done well," explained
Marquess. "But he had a sore
chest, and that set him back for
two or three weeks."
After pitching six scoreless in
nings of one-hit ball against the
University of the Pacific on April
3, it seemed that Sepeda was back
on track. But then he got roughed
up by Stanislaus State last week.
"I'm just in a slump. My control
was poor," explained Sepeda. "You
have to have control in college,
whereas you didn't in high school
because the caliber of hitters was
poor."
Sepeda also felt that he was
holding back because he feared a

recurrence of his chest injury.
"Lately, I haven't been cutting
loose like I used to," he said. "I
have to put the iryury out of my
mind."
Primarily a two-pitch hurler
(fastball and curve), Sepeda has
broadened his repertoire in col
lege. With a new pitch in his bag
of tricks, Sepeda remained opti
mistic about the future.
"(Pitching Coach Tom) Dunton
taught me how to throw the
change. And once I cut loose and
regain my control, I'll be all
right."
At Arizona State on Friday
night, Sepeda was more than "all
right." With the Cardinal trapped
in an inning in which another
Cardinal freshman pitcher had al
ready surrendered 10 runs,
Sepeda came on in relief and gave
up only one run on one hit over
the next two and one-thirds in
nings in a game Stanford lost 16-1.
Getting back in the groove,
Sepeda provided one light of joy
on a dark night for the Cardinal.
