# NCAA considering reform which will limit practice time

### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
Stanford athletes and coaches are
worried that if the NCAA adopts a series
of recently proposed rules, athletes in
several sports will be severely limited in
their ability to train for competition.
Last year the NCAA President's Com
mission conducted a $1.5 million nation
wide survey of college athletes which
revealed that respondents wished they
had more "free time." As a result, the
commission met in March and drafted a
series of proposals in an effort to curb
training time and give student athletes

a fair chance at "a normal college life."
Among the commission's policy sugges
tions are that:
• All athletic-related activities be lim
ited to 20 hours per week, including prac
tice, weight training, competition,
meetings and physical rehabilitation,
• Only one practice session be con
ducted on any one day during the com
petitive season,
• Required training and competition
seasons be limited to 22 weeks,
• Off-season practice and other
athletic-related activities be limited to a
maximum of eight hours a week, and
• Three days per week during the off

season be totally free of practice and
other athletic-related activities.
Throughout this month, the NCAA
commission will hold conferences to
review the draft. June 10 is the deadline
for any suggested changes, after which
the commission will meet again to make
decisions on what legislation to advance.
If eventually adopted by the NCAA, the
new rules will go into effect in the 1991-
92 academic year.
A letter from the commission was sent
out to university and college athletic di
rectors last month, explaining that the
proposed rules would allow student
athletes more time to "integrate into the

student body and be able to access the
same collegiate experiences as any stu
dent may elect."
But the suggested reforms could
threaten individual sports such as gym

nasties and swimming. Athletes and
trainers say such sports require much
more training time than the proposed 20
hours per week, and year-round training
is essential for athletes in these sports
to maintain their conditioning.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said each sport needs to be looked at
individually. "The time demands on ath
letes vary from sport to sport," Geiger
said, "and these blanket, across-the-board
rules eliminate the athlete from his or
her level of competition."
Geiger urged University coaches to con-
