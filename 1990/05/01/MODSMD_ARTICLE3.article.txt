# NCAA considering reform which will limit practice time
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
Stanford athletes and coaches are
worried that if the NCAA adopts a series
of recently proposed rules, athletes in
several sports will be severely limited in
their ability to train for competition.
Last year the NCAA President's Com
mission conducted a $1.5 million nation
wide survey of college athletes which
revealed that respondents wished they
had more "free time." As a result, the
commission met in March and drafted a
series of proposals in an effort to curb
training time and give student athletes

a fair chance at "a normal college life."
Among the commission's policy sugges
tions are that:
• All athletic-related activities be lim
ited to 20 hours per week, including prac
tice, weight training, competition,
meetings and physical rehabilitation,
• Only one practice session be con
ducted on any one day during the com
petitive season,
• Required training and competition
seasons be limited to 22 weeks,
• Off-season practice and other
athletic-related activities be limited to a
maximum of eight hours a week, and
• Three days per week during the off

season be totally free of practice and
other athletic-related activities.
Throughout this month, the NCAA
commission will hold conferences to
review the draft. June 10 is the deadline
for any suggested changes, after which
the commission will meet again to make
decisions on what legislation to advance.
If eventually adopted by the NCAA, the
new rules will go into effect in the 1991-
92 academic year.
A letter from the commission was sent
out to university and college athletic di
rectors last month, explaining that the
proposed rules would allow student
athletes more time to "integrate into the

student body and be able to access the
same collegiate experiences as any stu
dent may elect."
But the suggested reforms could
threaten individual sports such as gym

nasties and swimming. Athletes and
trainers say such sports require much
more training time than the proposed 20
hours per week, and year-round training
is essential for athletes in these sports
to maintain their conditioning.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said each sport needs to be looked at
individually. "The time demands on ath
letes vary from sport to sport," Geiger
said, "and these blanket, across-the-board
rules eliminate the athlete from his or
her level of competition."
Geiger urged University coaches to con-

tact coaches at other schools and
to formulate alternative proposals
for each individual sport.
Freshman swimmer Janet
Evans, an Olympic triple-gold
medalist, is prepared to sue the
NCAA if the proposals are ap
proved. "Basically, it's an infringe
ment on my rights to tell me what
to do with my time," she said. "If
the proposals are passed, I would
stop out, swim through the Olym
pic year, probably retire and come

finish my education without
swimming."
Stanford gymnast Jennifer
Bloom, a junior, said she think
the changes could be dangerous.
"I think it might be a good idea
for some sports, but definitely not
for gymnasts. If we only work out
a few weeks a year, we'll be out
of shape. Our bodies wouldn't be
ready for some of the things we
do in practice."
Bloom was especially concerned
that her gymnastic skills would
not improve were such restric
tions applied to the NCAA pro
gram. "I guess I could go to a
private club and work out there,"

but this option, while legal, would
be inconvenient, Bloom said.
U.S. Swimming National Team
Director Dennis Pursley said he
is extremely concerned about the
proposal's effects on the U.S.
swim team.
"If these proposals are adopted,
our NCAA swimmers who aspire
to achieve peak performance
would be forced to abandon their
goals or drop out of the NCAA
program," he said. "This could
bring about the end of elite level
competition in the NCAA pro
gram and have a devastating ef
fect on swimming in the United
States in general."

Pursley said he challenged the
NCAA and was told that while
simple opposition to the proposals
would be ineffective, the Presi
dent's Commission is willing to
hear alternative suggestions.
"They'd much rather hear sug
gestions from the athletes than
their coaches. We have very little
say in the matter; it's the athletes
who are affected by the proposals
who can bring about change,"
Pursley said.
Most of the proposed changes
are aimed at correcting academic
problems which the NCAA has
seen in football and basketball
players. Doug Oliver, Stanford as

sistant men's basketball coach,
said the proposal will not have as
harmful an effect on his team as
it would on individual sports.
"I do think some things could
help," he said. "For us, two or
two-and-a-half hours a day is
manageable. But then you've got
the injury factor. Kids need to be
with the trainer more."
Oliver added, "My concern
would be, who monitors this? Is
taping prior to practice inclusive
in the time rule? We're opening
a new can of worms here — we
can't be regulated by the NCAA.
"Overall, the proposals are good
— everything should be standard

ized. Some standard of time in
volvement in sports would be
easier on coaches, too, personally
and professionally." Oliver was
quick to add that a blanket rule
would be unfair, since different
sports require different training
demands.
Geiger said he will be working
with all University head coaches
to structure alternative proposals
in the next few weeks. He stressed
the importance of maintaining a
balance between academics and
athletics.
"In terms of the athlete, the
years between 17 and 22 are in
credibly important," Geiger said.
