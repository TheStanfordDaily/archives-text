# Even college golf can provide spring spectating diversion
## 
### 
This time of year is basically heaven
for Stanford sports fans. For
"Starters, the Weather is finally con
vincing freshmen that turning down Har
vard was a good idea, thus making sitting
in the stands a fine way to spend some
time.
Additionally, finals are still more than
a month away, meaning most of you prob
ably won't start studying in earnest for
another three weeks or so. And with
baseball just getting started and the NBA
playoffs still not to the exciting part (it's
funny how some column topics just keep
popping up week aflter week. . . .), watch
ing the tube holds little charm.
Thus, the only way to spend a weekend
is by overdosing on your favorite Cardinal
squad. There are plenty to choose from
this time of year. The baseball team and
both tennis teams are right up at the
top of the national rankings. The track
and field squad also provides a fine op
portunity for the typical Stanford couch
potato to become a bleacher potato. And
for those willing to take a short drive,
the crew teams hosted the nation's best
a couple weeks back.
Last weekend, however, for those Stan
ford students looking to blow off studying
and vicariously live the thrill of being an
intercollegiate athlete, there was only one
option:
Women's golf.

Unless you had the means to get
off campus, the Pacific 10 Con
ference Women's Golf Champion
ships at the golf course were it. Now, I
would have to imagine the hard-core
sports fan might have a problem spending
a weekend watching golf.
1 guess the first argument would be
that golf simply isn't a sport, and golfers
are not athletes. Golf frequently gets
thrown in with stuff like professional
bowling and automobile racing as non
sports.
I'm not going to try to defend the other
two, but I happen to think golf is a sport.
Now you might not think trying to hit
a little white ball into a small cup various
and sundry yards away requires much
athleticism.
I, on the other hand, don't think it
requires much athleticism to scarf pizza
all day long, sit around most of the time
and then drag your 260 pounds out one
night in every five and throw 60-mile

an-hour fastballs.
But that's all Rick Reuschel does. I
rather imagine even golfs harshest critics
will have to admit that praticioners of
that sport are usually more athletic in
their endeavors than the No. 3 active
all-time winner in the mtyors.
Additionally, hitting a golf ball far and
straight requires the same kind of natural
aptitude and developed skill as, say, hit
ting a three-pointer with Michael Jordan
in your face, or hitting a 240-pound full
back.
When you consider that the golfers at
the Pac-10 tourney this past weekend
spent four hours walking around with a
15-pound bag of clubs slung over their
shoulder for three consecutive days, you
can appreciate that it isn't as easy as it
looks.
And they didn't use golf carts. I
think there's some sort of rule
against it, but I'm not sure. But
anyway, that means that they had to
walk the 6,190-yard course. Assuming a
reasonable number of forays from the
straight and narrow to play a ball sliced
into the tall stuff on the side of the
fairway or over in that bunker that swal
lowed your ball just like those trees al
ways used to swallow Charlie Brown's
kites, and counting the distance from a
green to the tee of the next hole, that's
more like 8,000 yards (which, by the way,

They didn't use golf
carts. I think there's
some sort of rule
against it, but I'm not
sure.

is only slightly longer than this sentence).
Now I used to be pretty good at math
(Back before the days of being graded on
a curve in a class where everyone got
800s on the math part of the SAT. And
back before I knew what partial differ
ential equations were (actually I still
don't, but I remember they were impor
tant in a class I didn't do so well in and
so maybe I should have learned about
them). And back before almost all math
teachers had these wild foreign accents
that made it so even if you knew what
they were talking about conceptually, you
had no idea what they were actually say
ing). A little figurin' tells me that these
alleged non-athletes are hiking five miles
a day.
To me that's quite a hike.
Of course there's the other criticism
that golf isn't exciting to watch.
But four of the nation's nine
best teams were at the Pac-10 Tourna

ment this weekend, and after about 900
strokes each, they all finished within six
Bhots of each other.
I'll admit that it's a hard sport to keep
track of, what with a bunch of different
people on a bunch of different holes. But
if you pick a group to follow around, you
are provided with a lot more fun and
entertainment that you get from other
sports.
If you're watching a football game, you
don't get to hear Bob Whitfield say,
"Damn, I screwed up that block," after
a play. Partially because he usually
doesn't screw up, but mostly because
you're in the stands, and he's in the
trenches.
But at a golf tournament you get con
versations like this:
"Hi, Chris. Did you see that seven I
shot on the last hole?" (It was a par
three.)
"Um, yeah."
"Pretty good, huh?"
"Uh, I guess."
In no other sport can you watch your
schoolmates compete with the nation's
best and carry on a running conversation
with them at the same time.
It's fun. It's social. And they don't bite.

option:
Women's golf.

Unless you had the means to get
off campus, the Pacific 10 Con
ference Women's Golf Champion
ships at the golf course were it. Now, I
would have to imagine the hard-core
sports fan might have a problem spending
a weekend watching golf.
1 guess the first argument would be
that golf simply isn't a sport, and golfers
are not athletes. Golf frequently gets
thrown in with stuff like professional
bowling and automobile racing as non
sports.
I'm not going to try to defend the other
two, but I happen to think golf is a sport.
Now you might not think trying to hit
a little white ball into a small cup various
and sundry yards away requires much
athleticism.
I, on the other hand, don't think it
requires much athleticism to scarf pizza
all day long, sit around most of the time
and then drag your 260 pounds out one
night in every five and throw 60-mile

an-hour fastballs.
But that's all Rick Reuschel does. I
rather imagine even golfs harshest critics
will have to admit that praticioners of
that sport are usually more athletic in
their endeavors than the No. 3 active
all-time winner in the mtyors.
Additionally, hitting a golf ball far and
straight requires the same kind of natural
aptitude and developed skill as, say, hit
ting a three-pointer with Michael Jordan
in your face, or hitting a 240-pound full
back.
When you consider that the golfers at
the Pac-10 tourney this past weekend
spent four hours walking around with a
15-pound bag of clubs slung over their
shoulder for three consecutive days, you
can appreciate that it isn't as easy as it
looks.
And they didn't use golf carts. I
think there's some sort of rule
against it, but I'm not sure. But
anyway, that means that they had to
walk the 6,190-yard course. Assuming a
reasonable number of forays from the
straight and narrow to play a ball sliced
into the tall stuff on the side of the
fairway or over in that bunker that swal
lowed your ball just like those trees al
ways used to swallow Charlie Brown's
kites, and counting the distance from a
green to the tee of the next hole, that's
more like 8,000 yards (which, by the way,

is only slightly longer than this sentence).
Now I used to be pretty good at math
(Back before the days of being graded on
a curve in a class where everyone got
800s on the math part of the SAT. And
back before I knew what partial differ
ential equations were (actually I still
don't, but I remember they were impor
tant in a class I didn't do so well in and
so maybe I should have learned about
them). And back before almost all math
teachers had these wild foreign accents
that made it so even if you knew what
they were talking about conceptually, you
had no idea what they were actually say
ing). A little figurin' tells me that these
alleged non-athletes are hiking five miles
a day.
To me that's quite a hike.
Of course there's the other criticism
that golf isn't exciting to watch.
But four of the nation's nine
best teams were at the Pac-10 Tourna

ment this weekend, and after about 900
strokes each, they all finished within six
Bhots of each other.
I'll admit that it's a hard sport to keep
track of, what with a bunch of different
people on a bunch of different holes. But
if you pick a group to follow around, you
are provided with a lot more fun and
entertainment that you get from other
sports.
If you're watching a football game, you
don't get to hear Bob Whitfield say,
"Damn, I screwed up that block," after
a play. Partially because he usually
doesn't screw up, but mostly because
you're in the stands, and he's in the
trenches.
But at a golf tournament you get con
versations like this:
"Hi, Chris. Did you see that seven I
shot on the last hole?" (It was a par
three.)
"Um, yeah."
"Pretty good, huh?"
"Uh, I guess."
In no other sport can you watch your
schoolmates compete with the nation's
best and carry on a running conversation
with them at the same time.
It's fun. It's social. And they don't bite.

This time of year is basically heaven
for Stanford sports fans. For
"Starters, the Weather is finally con
vincing freshmen that turning down Har
vard was a good idea, thus making sitting
in the stands a fine way to spend some
time.
Additionally, finals are still more than
a month away, meaning most of you prob
ably won't start studying in earnest for
another three weeks or so. And with
baseball just getting started and the NBA
playoffs still not to the exciting part (it's
funny how some column topics just keep
popping up week aflter week. . . .), watch
ing the tube holds little charm.
Thus, the only way to spend a weekend
is by overdosing on your favorite Cardinal
squad. There are plenty to choose from
this time of year. The baseball team and
both tennis teams are right up at the
top of the national rankings. The track
and field squad also provides a fine op
portunity for the typical Stanford couch
potato to become a bleacher potato. And
for those willing to take a short drive,
the crew teams hosted the nation's best
a couple weeks back.
Last weekend, however, for those Stan
ford students looking to blow off studying
and vicariously live the thrill of being an
intercollegiate athlete, there was only one
option:
Women's golf.
