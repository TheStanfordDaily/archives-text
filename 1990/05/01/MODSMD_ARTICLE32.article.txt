# Card swimmers land nation's top recruit
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
After this season's freshman
swimmers stepped out of the In
dianapolis pool and brushed the
water droplets off of their shiny,
shaved heads, they could only look
at the NCAA scoreboard and
wince at the Cardinal's disap
pointing third place finish behind
Texas and Southern California.
One month later, after the Stan
ford coaches seemed to have won
the aquatic recruiting wars, these
freshman competitors have great
motivation to wet their sprouting
hair stubble in preparation for a
more satisfying run at the NCAA
Championship next year.
According to Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp, Stanford outdueled Texas
and Tennessee for this year's best
youngsters. The Cardinal coaches
battled Longhorn Coach Eddie
Reese for six different athletes
and succeeded in pulling four of
the swimmers to the Farm.
Leading the way will be the na
tion's No. 1 recruit, Derek Weath
erford, a backstroker from Fort
Myers, Fla.
"We're getting the best fresh
man class of anybody out there
for the second year in a row,"
Knapp said. "Now we just have

to put it all together for that one
weekend in April."
Weatherford has been a focal
point for many coaches for the
past few years. After recording
the most points at the Indoor Na
tional Championships in the
spring and recording six top age
group rankings in 1989, Weather
ford was heavily recruited by each
of the top five schools at this
year's NCAAs. Last Sunday,
Weatherford made the decision to
attend Stanford.
"Derek has great versatility and
great international experience,"
Knapp said. "He should be, at
some point, the NCAA Champion
in both the 100 and 200
(backstroke)."
Along with Weatherford, five
more talented high-school swim
mers will join the Cardinal squad
â€” Tyler Mayfield from Las Vegas,
Brian Retterer from Sparks, Nev.,
Eddie Parienti from Ontario,
Canada, Trip Zedlitz from Okla
homa City and Bill Schell from
Camp Mill, Pa.
"We had a very academically
oriented group, probably as deep
academically as we have ever had,
and by far the deepest athletical
ly," Knapp said. "Our fifth recruit
[this yearl might, during other
years, be our top recruit."
