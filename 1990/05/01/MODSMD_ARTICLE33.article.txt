# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
It's safe to say that the Stanford tennis
teams own the Pacific 10 Conference, and
the Individual Championships at Ojai last
weekend belonged particularly to two Car
dinal sophomores. In collecting a pair of
titles and two second-place finishes for good
measure, Debbie Graham and Alex O'Brien
are the Daily's Athletes of the Week.
Graham, who is from Fountain Valley,
Calif., is the third player in the Cardinal

singles lineup and is ranked 13th in the
country. These numbers are impressive until
they are contrasted with the two players
ahead of her on the team — No. 1-ranked
Sandra Birch and No. 2-ranked Meredith
McGrath.
What did Graham do when she had to
face, consecutively, her two powerful team
mates at the Pac-108? Merely beat them
both and capture a Pac-10 singles crown.
Graham, who has never lost in a dual
match at Stanford, had a surprisingly easy
time with Birch, the defending Pac-10 and
NCAA singles champion. In the semifinals,
which was composed of the Cardinal's top
four players, Graham beat Birch 6-4, 6-1.
In the other semi, McGrath outlasted Ten
Whitlinger 6-3, 7-6.
On Sunday at the crack of dawn, Graham
rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and gutted
out a 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 win over McGrath.
McGrath received some consolation later in
the day, as she and partner Whitlinger
defeated Graham and Birch for the doubles
title, 6-4, 6-1.

O'Brien, a native of Amarillo, Texas, is
the usual No. 2 singles player for the Car
dinal. But due to an it\jury to Stanford's
top player, freshman Jonathan Stark, the
sophomore has temporarily assumed the No.
1 role for the two-time defending NCAA
champions. O'Brien responded to the promo
tion by reaching the singles final and win
ning the doubles championship.
O'Brien, ranked 14th in the nation in

singles, did not drop a set in reaching the
singles final. He defeated doubles partner
Jason Yee in the quarterfinals and knocked
off UCLA's Mark Knowles in the semis 7-6,
6-1.
In the finals, O'Brien fell to Jason Netter,
UCLA's No. 1 player, 6-3, 6-2.
O'Brien and Yee, the regular No. 3 doubles
team for Stanford, scored a mild upset in
winning the doubles championship.
