# Art for the environment's sake
## Painting exhibit teaches about Brazilian rain forest 
### Rob Baedeker 
The late British artist Margaret
Mee once said the most important
thing her work could do would be
to contribute to the struggle
against the destruction of the
Amazon rain forests.
With the help of a Bay Area
schoolteacher and a group of Stan
ford students, Mee's paintings will
soon be doing exactly that.
Diana Watkins, an elementary
schoolteacher in the Redwood City
school district, has organized an
exhibition of Mee's "Flowers of
Amazonia" watercolors at the
Bechtel International Center. She
has also arranged for Bay Area
schoolchildren to tour the exhibit
and learn about the Brazilian rain
forest.
On Tuesday and Friday morn
ings from May 4-18, Stanford stu
dents will lead the children
through the exhibit. Graduate
School of Business Prof. George
Shultz is scheduled to attend the
exhibit on May 11 with the
children.
The visiting students will also
examine artifacts, watch videos

and work with a multimedia Ap
ple computer demonstration. At
the end of their visit, they will
sample more than 400 gallons of
Ben and Jerry's "Rainforest
Crunch" ice cream, which con
tains Brazilian nuts, a product of
the rain forest.
According to Watkins, who is a
bilingual teacher, the goal of the
program is to offer "at risk" stu
dents of color an international
perspective on environmental and
cultural issues.
Watkins, who worked as a
diplomat in Brazil, became friends
with Mee there. She said she was
"inspired by her political activism
and intrigued by her artwork."
After Mee's death last year,
Watkins arranged for this special
showing of the 15 prints and has
gathered sponsors and volunteers
for the event. "Through this ex
hibit I hope Margaret's enthusi
asm and dedication will become
contagious," Watkins said.
Scott Veirs, a member of Stu
dents for Environmental Action
at Stanford, has helped organize
student volunteers for the pro
gram. He said he hopes the exhibit
at the I-Center will enable his

group to bring environmental ed
ucation to local schools.
"As a long-term goal, we hope
to branch out to East Palo Alto
and other schools to implement
innovative teaching techniques
and establish lasting programs,"
Veirs said.
Maria Bun, director of the I-
Center's office for international
visitors, said, "One way of increas
ing awareness about the rain for
est is just to show its beauty, and
this is what Margaret Mee's paint
ing's do." Bun has helped coor
dinate the event in coryuction
with Brazil Week, which will take
place at the I-Center from May
4-12.
The program will be formally
inaugurated this Friday at 4:30
p.m. at the I-Center. A panel dis
cussion with History Prof. John
Wirth, Political Science Prof.
Robert Packenham, Anthropology
Assoc. Prof. William Durham and
cultural anthropologist William
Balee will address issues concern
ing the tropical rain forest.
Students interested in volun
teering for the program should
contact Watkins or Bun at 723-
1984.
