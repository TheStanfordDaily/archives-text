While a crowd of 20,000 gath
ered in Vilnius, Lithuania's cap
ital, Parliamentarian Jonas
Tamulis was on his way to Stan
ford to speak to scholars about
the Lithuanian independence
movement.
In a private information ses
sion held at the Hoover Insti
tution yesterday afternoon, the
newly elected member of the
Lithuanian Parliament called on
Stanford scholars to support
Lithuania's secession from the
Soviet Union.
Lithuania was one of the So
viet Union's 15 republics.
Ssgudis, the local independence

movement that backs Tamulis'
party, defeated the Communists
in parliamentary elections held
in March.
Tamulis, who is a physicist
and a member of the Green
Party — the environmentally fo
cused political party — said he
was disappointed with the level
of support Lithuania has re
ceived from the Bush adminis
tration.
"There has been no shift in
the government's action,"
Tamulis said in an interview
with The Daily. "Each political
process has its own direction.
It's impossible to change it now.
We need sharp steps, no mild
ones, to create change."

Tamulis is scheduled to meet
with more scholars and with of
ficials in Washington, D.C. dur
ing his U.S. visit to explain the
position of the Lithuanian gov
ernment and to appeal for sup
port. "I'm not sure if there is
any use of going back to Wash
ington,"he said!.
Tamulis outlined the prob
lems facing the newly created
state. "I foresee ... problems
connected with economic and in
dustrial change. Lithuania
needs to use local resources and
not depend so much on the So
viet Union," he said. Currently,
the Soviet Union has cut off all
oil supplies and shipments of
many manufactured goods to
Lithuania.
