# Giving 'tenure' to researchers
## Proposal calls for special status for non-faculty experts 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
Even if the University gives the
status of full professorship to a
few top scholars at its policy
centers and institutes, it might
not be able to keep them from
leaving Stanford.
When world-renowned arms
controls expert and physicist Sid
ney Drell resigned as co-director
of the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control in No
vember 1988, his stated reason
for leaving was that University
rules "stymied" his attempts to

secure Stanford professorships for
several researchers at the center.
A few days later, former astro
naut Sally Ride and arms control
expert Ted Postol, who was denied
a faculty appointment in the Po
litical Science Department, fol
lowed Drell's lead in resigning
their positions as researchers at
the center.
One-and-a-half years later, and
after almost two years of studying
a broad group of issues concerning
the academic hierarchy, the Fac

ulty Senate's Committee on the
Professoriate has proposed giving
the equivalent of tenure to these
non-faculty researchers, who
would be called senior fellows.
The committee's proposal
would also give Academic Council
privileges, including principal in
vestigator status, to them. This
change would enable senior fel
lows to direct their own research
projects.
Committee members empha
sized that most researchers at the
University's numerous policy
centers and institutes hold joint
appointments in academic depart
ments, so this proposal only ap
plies to a few scholars.
Because their area of expertise
did not fit within a specific aca
demic department, these non
faculty scholars in the past could
only obtain fixed-term appoint
ments at the centers rather than
tenure. Under the new proposal,
senior fellows would be able to
stay at the centers for terms of
indefinite length.
Candidates for the position
would tjp subject to evaluation
"consistent with the rank of pro
fessor, including review by the
provost and the Advisory Board,"
according to the committee's
report.
Also, while in the past these
top researchers could only obtain
grants if they worked under fac
ulty members, senior fellows
would be able to apply for research
grants on their own.
Hopefully, this proposal will
make the position of senior fellow
attractive enough for Stanford to
retain these scholars, according to
Operations Research Prof. Gerald
Lieberman, the committee advi
sory board chair. He added, "The
word is 'recognition.' "

brain drain at the
centers.

row, who is a committee advisory
board member, Provost James
Rosse and Lieberman all said they
were confident the proposal would
be approved.
Of those interviewed, most of
ficials at policy centers and in
stitutes that would be affected by
the proposal either said they had
not read it or had no comment
on it.
Meanwhile, a few people inter
viewed, including University
President Donald Kennedy and
Postol, were skeptical that the
proposal would help plug the
brain drain at the centers.
In a brief statement to The
Daily last week, Kennedy wrote,
"In my view, (the proposal) will
only partly solve the problem of
center appointments in 'policy'
fields." He offered no further
elaboration.
In a telephone interview last
week, Postol, who is currently a
research associate at MIT, said he
felt the proposal would "probably
[be] OK for certain people" but
is "unacceptable if (the University

is) talking about building serious
academic programs."
Postol criticized the proposal
for not addressing the issue of
non-faculty scholars who want to
teach in University departments
as well.
"Why should an individual who
has intellectual achievement and
achievement in research equal or
surpassing [many faculty mem
bers] ... have to be subordinate
(to them)?" he asked.
However, Arrow said, "What
[experts in specialized fields, like
Postol] do is policy-oriented re
search and not fundamental schol
arship."
Moreover, some committee
members interviewed said senior
fellows could be called upon as
teachers, especially to graduate
students.
Richard Lyman, director of the
Institute for International
Studies, said he felt Drell would
not be "satisfied" with the pro
posal. In a telephone interview
from New York, Drell — who is
still deputy director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center —
said he had not read the proposal.
Because of the broad range of
issues addressed by the commit
tee, the Faculty Senate will be
debating its recommendations, in
cluding this proposal, for at least
three weeks before voting on
them, according Peter Gregory,
committee member and associate
dean of the School of Medicine.
