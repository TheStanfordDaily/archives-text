# Auditing Stanford's environment
## Report cites room for improvement 
### Brendan Moorehead 
The preliminary report of the
Stanford Environmental Audit in
dicates that while Stanford is
working hard in some areas to
promote conservation of its re
sources, there is much room for
improvement.
Coordinated by senior Robert
Abrams, the audit looks at
resource "inputs," ranging from
energy use to departmental
procurement policies, and waste
"outputs" such as radioactive and
hazardous waste.
The report, which covers the
1988-89 academic year, reveals
some striking statistics regarding
Stanford's use of resources and
generation of wastes:
• Stanford is one of Northern
California's largest energy con
sumers, spending $15 million dur
ing the period covered by the
report. Furthermore, the Univer
sity's energy use has been growing
at about 8 percent per year for
the past five years.
• Stanford produced 273,000

pounds of hazardous waste, cos
ting $673,000 for treatment and
disposal. Sixteen percent of this
chemical waste was recycled.
• Silver, a chemical used in pho
tography labs on campus, is re

leased into the sewage system
when it is poured down the drain,
posing a threat to the San Fran
cisco Bay, where it is eventually
released. Currently, silver is not
measured as part of the hazardous
waste, which is collected and
taken off campus.
• Stanford's radioactive waste
included 3,558 cubic feet of dry
waste, 62 cubic feet of liquid waste
and 1,494 cubic feet of radioactive
animal carcasses. The disposal
costs totalled $121,978.
• Stanford generated 19,348
tons of solid waste, which is ap
proximately 3 percent of the total
waste for Santa Clara County.
• Of this solid waste, 93.6 per
cent was disposed of at landfills,
while 6.4 percent was recycled.
The cost of landfill disposal
totalled $362,160 — approxi
mately $20 per ton.
• About 20,000 people commute
to Stanford daily, generating
greenhouse gases and air pollut
ants such as carbon dioxide,
oxides of nitrogen and carbon
monoxide. Although 21.5 percent
commute by bicycle, 60 percent
of all commuters drive their
automobiles alone.
According to Abrams, the audit
will become "a vehicle through
which we collect information
which will be vital to have in order
to ensure that Stanford meets reg
ulations." It also will help Stan
ford to reduce its use of resources
and production of wastes.
The preliminary report has too
little information at this point to
make suggestions about how ra
dioactive and hazardous wastes
can be reduced and treated for
safer disposal, according to
Abrams.
The audit does, however, out
line current projects for the re
duction of solid waste, as well as
future plans. Recycling is the
backbone of such projects.

waste, the Stanford Recycling
Center saved the University about
$37,500 last year.
In addition, this year the Recy
cling Center, in concert with Pen
insula Sanitary Services, has
dramatically increased recycling
from last year's 6.4 percent to 17
percent.
Nevertheless, Stanford has not
yet reduced its solid waste by 25
percent, a goal that a new state
law requires the University to
reach by 1995. As of the year
2000, solid waste must be reduced
by 50 percent.
This reduction can be achieved
through recycling and converting
from the use of throw-away prod
ucts to reusable ones, especially
in operations like University Food
Service and Tresidder Food Serv
ice. While both strategies work
and should be implemented, recy
cling has the most potential to
divert the solid waste stream, ac
cording to Barbara Voss, program
coordinator of the Recycling Cen
ter.
When possible, University Food
Service buys products in bulk and
in recyclable containers in order
to save on packaging materials.
Out of a total budget of approx
imately $3.5 million per year, Uni
versity Food Service also buys
about $100,000 worth of organic
produce, which is grown without
the use of chemical fertilizers or
pesticides. It claims, however, that
students avoid organic produce
because it is not "physically per
fect."
Two separate organizations
manage energy use on campus.

The Energy Management Group,
part of Operations and Mainte
nance, has implemented energy
saving strategies including
replacement of incandescent bulbs
with compact fluorescents and oc
cupancy sensors in classrooms.
These projects save an estimated
$1 million or more each year.
The Housing Energy Conserva
tion Center administers dormitory
conservation programs such as in
stalling low-flow shower heads,
which save water and energy, and
distributing energy-saving and
recycling information through
dorm representatives.
Unfortunately, students have
vandalized the new shower heads
and faucet aerators, in protest of
the reduced water pressure, ac
cording to the audit and Voss.
Repairs cost the University $30
per shower head and $17 per
aerator.
Transportation efficiency is one
of the most difficult issues facing
Stanford.
Public transportation serving
the Stanford campus is limited to
Caltrain, the Marguerite and the
Dumbarton Express — a bus to
the Union City BART station —
and is inconvenient for most Stan
ford commuters. The best cur
rently available option is
carpooling, which 8.5 percent of
Stanford's commuters use.

Stanford Environmental Audit is
a work-in-progress workshop
slated for May 30 at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge

• Of this solid waste, 93.6 per
cent was disposed of at landfills,
while 6.4 percent was recycled.
The cost of landfill disposal
totalled $362,160 — approxi
mately $20 per ton.
• About 20,000 people commute
to Stanford daily, generating
greenhouse gases and air pollut
ants such as carbon dioxide,
oxides of nitrogen and carbon
monoxide. Although 21.5 percent
commute by bicycle, 60 percent
of all commuters drive their
automobiles alone.
According to Abrams, the audit
will become "a vehicle through
which we collect information
which will be vital to have in order
to ensure that Stanford meets reg
ulations." It also will help Stan
ford to reduce its use of resources
and production of wastes.
The preliminary report has too
little information at this point to
make suggestions about how ra
dioactive and hazardous wastes
can be reduced and treated for
safer disposal, according to
Abrams.
The audit does, however, out
line current projects for the re
duction of solid waste, as well as
future plans. Recycling is the
backbone of such projects.

Center saved the University about
$37,500 last year.
In addition, this year the Recy
cling Center, in concert with Pen
insula Sanitary Services, has
dramatically increased recycling
from last year's 6.4 percent to 17
percent.
Nevertheless, Stanford has not
yet reduced its solid waste by 25
percent, a goal that a new state
law requires the University to
reach by 1995. As of the year
2000, solid waste must be reduced
by 50 percent.
This reduction can be achieved
through recycling and converting
from the use of throw-away prod
ucts to reusable ones, especially
in operations like University Food
Service and Tresidder Food Serv
ice. While both strategies work
and should be implemented, recy
cling has the most potential to
divert the solid waste stream, ac
cording to Barbara Voss, program
coordinator of the Recycling Cen
ter.
When possible, University Food
Service buys products in bulk and
in recyclable containers in order
to save on packaging materials.
Out of a total budget of approx
imately $3.5 million per year, Uni
versity Food Service also buys
about $100,000 worth of organic
produce, which is grown without
the use of chemical fertilizers or
pesticides. It claims, however, that
students avoid organic produce
because it is not "physically per
fect."
Two separate organizations
manage energy use on campus.

The Energy Management Group,
part of Operations and Mainte
nance, has implemented energy
saving strategies including
replacement of incandescent bulbs
with compact fluorescents and oc
cupancy sensors in classrooms.
These projects save an estimated
$1 million or more each year.
The Housing Energy Conserva
tion Center administers dormitory
conservation programs such as in
stalling low-flow shower heads,
which save water and energy, and
distributing energy-saving and
recycling information through
dorm representatives.
Unfortunately, students have
vandalized the new shower heads
and faucet aerators, in protest of
the reduced water pressure, ac
cording to the audit and Voss.
Repairs cost the University $30
per shower head and $17 per
aerator.
Transportation efficiency is one
of the most difficult issues facing
Stanford.
Public transportation serving
the Stanford campus is limited to
Caltrain, the Marguerite and the
Dumbarton Express — a bus to
the Union City BART station —
and is inconvenient for most Stan
ford commuters. The best cur
rently available option is
carpooling, which 8.5 percent of
Stanford's commuters use.
The next milestone for the
Stanford Environmental Audit is
a work-in-progress workshop
slated for May 30 at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge

The preliminary report of the
Stanford Environmental Audit in
dicates that while Stanford is
working hard in some areas to
promote conservation of its re
sources, there is much room for
improvement.
Coordinated by senior Robert
Abrams, the audit looks at
resource "inputs," ranging from
energy use to departmental
procurement policies, and waste
"outputs" such as radioactive and
hazardous waste.
The report, which covers the
1988-89 academic year, reveals
some striking statistics regarding
Stanford's use of resources and
generation of wastes:
• Stanford is one of Northern
California's largest energy con
sumers, spending $15 million dur
ing the period covered by the
report. Furthermore, the Univer
sity's energy use has been growing
at about 8 percent per year for
the past five years.
• Stanford produced 273,000

pounds of hazardous waste, cos
ting $673,000 for treatment and
disposal. Sixteen percent of this
chemical waste was recycled.
• Silver, a chemical used in pho
tography labs on campus, is re

leased into the sewage system
when it is poured down the drain,
posing a threat to the San Fran
cisco Bay, where it is eventually
released. Currently, silver is not
measured as part of the hazardous
waste, which is collected and
taken off campus.
• Stanford's radioactive waste
included 3,558 cubic feet of dry
waste, 62 cubic feet of liquid waste
and 1,494 cubic feet of radioactive
animal carcasses. The disposal
costs totalled $121,978.
• Stanford generated 19,348
tons of solid waste, which is ap
proximately 3 percent of the total
waste for Santa Clara County.
• Of this solid waste, 93.6 per
cent was disposed of at landfills,
while 6.4 percent was recycled.
The cost of landfill disposal
totalled $362,160 — approxi
mately $20 per ton.
• About 20,000 people commute
to Stanford daily, generating

ants such as carbon dioxide,
