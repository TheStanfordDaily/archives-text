# Flicks paper to be collected, recycled
## 
### Brendan Moorehead 
An estimated 100 pounds of
paper airplanes are lofted into
the air before the start of every
late show at the Sunday Flicks.
Now student environmen
talists want to do something
about this waste of paper. But
far from condemning the
stress-relieving ritual, the
Stanford Environmental Audit
and Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford are ar
ranging to have 10 volunteer
recyclers admitted to the movie
for free in exchange for picking
up paper after the late show.

"No moral condemnation of
a single Flicked airplane is in
tended," the preliminary audit
report reads. "With a little bit
of foresight, each paper
airplane might fly again."
After last Sunday's movie,
"Born on the Fourth of July,"
10 volunteers participated and
cleaned up both floors of
Memorial Auditorium in only
a half an hour.
Recycling the paper would
take even less time, the report
says, were Flicks viewers to
pick up an armful of paper on
their way out and dump the
paper in bags at the exits.
