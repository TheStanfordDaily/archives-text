ANNOUNCING - AN AUTOGRAPHING BY
DR. SEYMOUR MARTIN UPSET
AUTHOR OF
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE:
The Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada
A New Routledge Book
Many Americans see few fundamental differences between their country and Canada — but
only because they don't look hard enough. In his new book, Continental Divide, political sociologist
Seymour Martin Lipset demonstrates that two distinct societies emerged from the American Revo
lution.
The United States was formed as a revolutionary, anti-statist government stressing "life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness," while its northern neighbor emerged as a counterrevolutionary nation
dedicated to "peace, order and good government."
Lipset's multi-disciplinary analysis explores U.S. and Canadian ideology, identity, literature,
religion, law, deviance, economic behavior, government, class structure, ethnic populations, and
federalist systems. Professor Lipset, a master of comparative country studies, integrates his decades
of Canadian studies with his career as one of America's premier social scientists.
