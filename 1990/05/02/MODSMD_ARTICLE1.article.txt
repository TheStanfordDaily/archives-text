# UCMI goals being fulfilled
## Study reports progress, questions campus commitment 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Nearly 75 percent of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues recommendations have
either been implemented or are
underway, according to a UCMI
self-study released yesterday.
Armed with the 102-page study,
a review panel will follow-up the
130 UCMI recommendations to
determine the precise extent to
which the University has com
plied with them. The 16-member
panel, which is composed of stu
dents, faculty and staff from in
side and outside the University,
will meet this week to discuss the
study.
The study states that much has
been achieved on multicultural is
sues in the year since the full
UCMI report was released, but
financial limitations will require
cuts in other areas to achieve the
goals of multiculturalism. "Whet
her the Stanford community has
sufficient commitment to UCMI's
vision to make such cuts remains
to be seen," the report adds.
The report sharply criticizes the
faculty's "variable and, in many
cases, fairly removed" commit

ment to the UCMI.
"In pockets all over campus,
professors are aware that these
issues are somebody's problem,
not necessarily theirs," the report
states.
Although the report points to
many successes, it identifies prob
lems in implementing some UCMI
recommendations, including
recruiting more minority staff
members and establishing an
ethnic studies distribution re
quirement.
The review panel, which is
scheduled to meet every year, will
use the study's findings as a base
for discussion of the UCMI in gen
eral. In the study, various Uni
versity officials wrote progress
reports on the UCMI recommen
dations for which they were re
sponsible.
The officials responded to ques
tions concerning progress in eight
areas of "Institutional Standards
on Cultural Diversity," including:
• The University's "vision for
institutionalizing the achievement
of multiculturalism" and commit
ment to that goal,
• Planning and reviewing pro
cesses,
• Multiracial faculty hiring and

retention and the entire faculty's
role in intellectual leadership,
• A curriculum reflecting the
University's commitment to a
multicultural community,
• Minority staff recruiting,
• Student recruiting, admis
sions, financial aid and retention
and
• A University community in
corporating "the values of multi
culturalism into all aspects of
student life."
Key University officials, includ
ing University President Donald
Kennedy, Provost James Rosse,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Tom Wasow, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons and Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter chaired the subcommittees.
The review panel will conduct
a public forum, open to everyone
in the Stanford community, in An
nenberg Auditorium tomorrow
from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. In a series
of 31 meetings over the next three
days, the panel also will talk with
University officials as well as stu
dent and staff representatives to
review Stanford's multiracial ac
complishments since the publica
tion of the UCMI report last year.
