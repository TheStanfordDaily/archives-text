# Former San Antonio mayor:
## Local gov't will play major role in 1990s

Greater emphasis on the role
of local governments will
characterize our nation in the
19905, according to Henry Cis
neros, former mayor of San An
tonio, Texas.
Cisneros envisioned the new
shape of democracy and the
realities it will entail for our
society, addressing a crowd of
about 100 in Kresge Audito
rium last night.
Because the federal govern
ment is allocating fewer funds
for social issues, state and local
governments will become more
involved in these areas, he said.
Students will be affected by this
shift as more positions open up
in local leadership and public
service.
And as populations and
demographics change, Ameri
cans will see a "massive
collision" of the interests of the
aging with younger groups,
Cisneros said.
More people worldwide are
reaching their eighties and
remaining "useful citizens."
This new contingency will af
fect industries ranging from
health care to housing, as well
as election outcomes, he added.
According to Cisneros,
younger groups are changing

in makeup because of the
growing minority population in
the United States. In the year
2000, Chicano/Latinos, Asian-
Americans and blacks will com
pose 46 percent of California's
population, he estimated.
"Cultural change will be ev
ident virtually everywhere in
California," he said. Stanford
students, and people every
where, should thus learn about
the different languages and cul
tures that will play a large role
in the future.
Economic changes will
characterize the future as well.
"We're living in an increasingly
decentralized and entrepre
neurial society," Cisneros said.
As technology expands
worldwide, the U.S. educa
tional system may not be
equipped to deal with the
changes. Local governments
must take the initiative to im
prove the current system, he
added.
Another reality of the new
democracy will be the expanded
role of American citizens in a
large global setting. According
to Cisneros, minority groups
will exert a "multiplication of
influence" as a result of the
nation's new relation of mutual
respect with different nations.
