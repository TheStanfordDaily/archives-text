# May Day observed around the world
## 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) â€” Eastern
Europe ignored violence elsewhere and
quietly celebrated its freedom from
decades of stagnant Communist ritual
on May Day, substituting music fests
and picnics for the proletarian parades
of the past.
Turbulence marked May Day dem
onstrations in South Korea, West Ber
lin, Mexico, Turkey and the Philip
pines, however.
And in Moscow, a brief burst of the
popular rage that has swept hard-line
Communists from power across East
ern Europe erupted in Red Square
yesterday, where the traditional
parade was open to all for the first
time in decades.
Taunting Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and other top leaders with
cries of "Shame!" demonstrators
waved Lithuanian flags and banners
bearing fierce anti-Kremlin slogans.
With their Stalinist leaders already
overthrown, thanks in part to Gorba
chev's reforms, East Europeans
rejoiced more peacefully, marking May
Day as they wished.
In Leipzig, East Germany, however,
leftist youths brawled with young neo-
Nazis in the market square, the gov
ernment news agency ADN reported.
West Berlin suffered an annual
surge of May Day violence as bands
of mostly leftist radicals hurled
firebombs and rocks yesterday night
and police responded with tear gas and
truncheons. More than 50 people were
arrested, police said.
But the common traditions of West
em and Eastern Europe also found
symbolic expression in May Day
celebrations in West Berlin as 60,000
Germans, including thousands of East
Berliners, came through the Branden
burg Gate.
Stormy street protests broke out in
Seoul, South Korea's capital, and at
least 17 provincial cities on the labor
holiday. Tens of thousands of students
and workers at auto plants, subways,
shipyards and broadcast stations held
rallies or clashed with police.

The protests were over police raids
that crushed strikes at a state broad
cast network and South Korea's lar
gest shipyard.
Citizens in Nepal for the first time
celebrated May Day legally, in keeping
with the democratic reforms imple
mented last month by King Birendra.
Workers in Mozambique marched
through downtown Maputo demand
ing higher wages and lower prices and
celebrating their first May Day since
the ruling party dropped its Marxist
philosophy.
And in Santiago, Chile, President
Patricio Aylwin marked the nation's
first May Day in democracy in 17
years, asking workers for patience in
their economic demands and announc
ing changes in restrictive labor laws
issued by the previous military regime.
In Mexico City, riot police on horse
back and on foot charged a holiday
march of independent unions, swinging
clubs and leaving several demonstra
tors bleeding from head wounds. Rocks
and bricks were hurled at police in
reply.
The marchers reached the main
plaza as a larger demonstration by
pro-government unions was dispers
ing.
About 40,000 demonstrators atten
ded a rally in Buenos Aires, cheering
leftist leaders who denounced Peronist
President Carlos Menem's bills to
restrict the right to strike and to reg
ulate employment.
The government's economic pro
gram is "anti-people," Vicente said,
and "dictated by the International
Monetary Fund."
In China, a holiday mood prevailed.
But an armed police cordon around
the monument to revolutionary heroes
in Bering's Tiananmen Square empha
sized official determination to avoid
any repeat of the pro-democracy dem
onstrations, which spread last spring
from the monument to much of the
country before being brutally
suppressed in June.


Germans from both East and West Berlin march together in observance of
May Day. In Berlin and Leipzig violence broke out during May Day demon
strations.
