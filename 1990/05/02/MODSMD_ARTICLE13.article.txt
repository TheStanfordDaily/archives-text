Cheney announces freeze
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney raised the
ante in the Pentagon budget battle
yesterday by extending a worldwide
freeze on military construction and
ordering 207 projects — including
Navy ports in Texas, Alabama, Mis
sissippi and New York — be reviewed
for possible cancellation.
"There's serious doubt about
whether or not we will get the levels
of funding from Congress that will
allow us to go forward with these
programs," Cheney said.
Bush pressured to act
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush will meet at the White House
tomorrow with Lithuania's new

prime minister, but the U.S. policy
of not formally recognizing the
breakaway Soviet republic has not
changed, a presidential spokesman
said.
The administration's stand came
under renewed criticism on Capitol
Hill, where the Senate yesterday
passed a resolution urging a halt to
any trade agreement that would
grant the Soviet Union lower tariffs
so long as the crackdown on Lithu
ania goes on.
Reactors will reopen
WASHINGTON (AP) - The gov
ernment intends to restart in Decem
ber the first of three nuclear weapons
reactors shut down for two years over
safety concerns, Energy Secretary
James Watkins said yesterday in an

nouncing resumed production for the
nation's atomic arsenal.
Watkins said the Energy Depart
ment also is looking at resuming in
June and July the production of
atomic warheads at its Rocky Flats
plant in Colorado, where operations
were suspended last November be
cause of similar safety and environ
mental concerns.
U.S. makes small gesture
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House, pressed by Iran and Syria to
show thanks for the release of two
American hostages, said yesterday it
was making "small gestures" of ap
preciation but insisted anew that all
captives be freed.

There were hints in both
Jerusalem and Washington that a re
lease of Arab prisoners held by Israel
could be part of an arrangement to
encourage the freeing of Western
hostages in Lebanon.
President Bush said Monday at the
White House that he had "certainly
no objection" to such a release.
Nicaragua bill calculated
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush gave Congress the final report
yesterday on the now-lifted U.S.
sanctions against Nicaragua, cal
culating down to the last penny how
much it cost to wage economic war
against Managua's former leftist gov
ernment.
