## Not all right now 
### 
Athletics Department
mismanaged resources
by reviving cheerleading

THERE HAVE TO be better
ways to spur spirited cheer
ing for Stanford's sports
teams.
The Athletics Department's new
cheerleading program is a bad idea
that could not possibly have been
created at a less appropriate time.
The forming of this squad of "yell
leaders" flies in the face of logic
and fiscal decency.
Only a few months ago, the Ath
letics Department was firing
coaches and killing off varsity
sports at a terrifying pace. Field
hockey, wrestling and sailing were
all reduced to "Varsity III" status,
a potentially misleading euphe
mism for "unfunded." The cuts, of
course, were all made in an at
tempt to erase a $1 million budget
deficit that the department some
how blundered its way into.
Apparently, the department now
has sufficient financial health to
spend tens of thousands of dollars
on non-sports like cheerleading.
But implying that the Varsity 111
sports were cut to pay for the
cheerleaders is perhaps unfair â€”
the Athletics Department claims
that alumni have donated money
earmarked for a traditional cheer
leading program.
This should still be considered
alarming, as the department has
stated that the cheerleaders are
being created in response to
"alumni demand." When the Ath
letics Department exterminates
student sports and lets the alumni
dictate their spending, one has to
wonder whose interests the depart
ment serves.
This situation, when considered
alongside the existing case of "club

sports" which must be funded by
ASSU special fees, implies that
Athletic Director Andy Geiger and
company are less interested in
serving the needs of the student
body than the demands of alumni.
Aside from the funding of the
cheerleaders, a more basic question
remains: who really wants them?
Only two years ago, a student
initiated program was such a com
plete failure that the Stanford
cheerleaders were actually booed
off the court by their own crowd.
One wonders why the Athletics
Department thinks it can do so
much better only two years later.
The program has already taken
a wrong step by having a Univer
sity of Southern California repre
sentative assist with the tryout
process. If there is any Pacific 10
school whose style should be
avoided, it is USC, whose one-song
repertoire, goose-stepping band
and barely-clad cheerleaders rep
resent a kind of ersatz fascism that
makes them more odious to most
Stanford fans than our traditional
rival, UC-Berkeley.
Will the Athletics Department
soon try to replace the ever
amusing Tree with the likes of the
militaristic Tommy Trojan? Will
the cheers from the crowd really
be that much louder with another
12 people dressed in red on the
perimeter of the track at the sta
dium?
Even if this program were not
a waste, it still represents an Ath
letics Department encroachment on
the activities of existing student
groups, creating still more cause
for alarm.
Finally, even though the cheer
leaders are an awful idea, we hope
that students will refrain from
booing and throwing objects at
them when the group debuts in
the fall. Such boorish behavior will
do nothing to cheer the Cardinal
on to victory.
