Silence on SCLC proposal does not mean acceptance

I AM WRITING to respond to a
comment made by Sally Cole, the
judicial affairs officer and an ex
officio member of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council.
Cole believes that silence in response
to Law Prof. Tom Grey's interpretation
of the Fundamental Standard signifies
acceptance of his interpretation. Cole
found it significant that the Grey
proposal received far less opposition.
than did prior proposals (she appar
ently did not find it important that
almost all the comments to the SCLC
opposed the Grey proposal). I believe,
however, that Cole cannot reasonably
infer her conclusion from campus
silence.

First, issues which receive significant
initial publicity rarely receive the same
amount of publicity, or reaction, in
subsequent discussions. New issues
always divert people's attention from
issues that received publicity in the
past.
Will we hear as much now about
famine as we did when the song "We
Are The World" was released? The fact
that we do not hear many comments
about speech restrictions the third time
around does not signify acceptance of
those restrictions.
Second, it is significant to note that
Grey's proposal is not as restrictive as
prior SCLC proposals. Perhaps there is
a cost to opposing any of these pro-

posed restrictions on free speech. That
cost is the likelihood of being labeled
insensitive or racist.
People may be so upset by a very
restrictive proposal — such as the past
proposals to regulate speech — that
they are willing to bear this cost.
However, they may feel that opposing
a less restictive proposal — such as
Grey's — is not worth the cost of
having "politically correct" activists use
epithets like "racist" against them.
Nonetheless, the resulting silence
does not mean that they accept Grey's
proposal.
Finally, it is curious that Cole should
infer any significance from silence in
the context of this issue. One of the

reasons cited in favor of speech regula
tion is that offensive speech silences
certain people. Their silence does not
signify an acceptance of the offensive
speech, but, rather, a vindication of the
need to regulate that speech.
If silence does not signify acceptance
of offensive speech, why should it
signify acceptance of regulating offen
sive speech? As its next project after
categorizing the meaning of different
types of speech, perhaps the SCLC
should categorize the meaning of dif
ferent types of silence. Until it does so,
we should attribute little, if any, signif
icance to the campus silence.
