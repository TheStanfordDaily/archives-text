# New requirements will mean too many humanities classes
## 
### 
Even though I am not affected by
the proposed changes in the Distribu
tion Requirements, I feel that I should
argue for the incoming freshmen who
will be affected by them. Increasing
Llit? number of DRs is overkill, and
having three techie DR's and seven
fuzzy DR's is unbalanced and unfair.
Granted, having some required
courses is a necessity, but Stanford
cannot insist that students take every
subject, otherwise one would spend his
entire four years here fulfilling the
DR's.
Each diploma says what we majored
in, so people know what our specialty
is. Everyone has many courses they
would like to take outside their mqjor,
but they might not have time to take
them because they have to take DR's.
Perhaps there could be a require-

ment that everyone has to take a few
DR's and some unspecified courses
outside their mtyor beyond the DR's.
That way people would be getting a
broad education but still taking courses
beyond their m«yor that they want to
take and enjoy.
Making someone take a course in a
certain subject is not necessarily going
to change their opinion about that
subject. In a 1959 study by Carl Hov
land at the Yale Attitude Change Pro
gram, it was found that people who
already have an opinon that is slightly
opposite of what is being argued for
sway even further against the argu
ment. They react against the argument.
A person's opinion will not be
changed in the desired direction espe
cially if he or she dislikes a course and
is being forced to take it. Trust me; I
agree that people should learn about
feminism and non-western cultures,
but I'm not sure that making them
take a course in it is the best way.
I also don't feel that the imbalance
between techie and fuzzy DR's is fair.
It is important to know our history
and how people interact, but it is also

important to know how our world
works and the laws of nature.
It also seems that many of the
techie DR's cater to fuzzies but the
fuzzy DR's don't cater to techies.
There is a "Physics for Poets" course
but no "Poetry for Physicists" course.
A DR should be a full-fledged course,
not a watered-down version.
Obviously I do not feel that there
should be more techie DR's, but that
perhaps there should be fewer DR's
and an added requirement that every
one take three or four courses outside
their but not in some specific
other area.
This does not mean that a civil en
gineer can take an electrical engineer
ing course as an outside course. He or
she should take an art or history or
English class, but should be able to
choose which one. Also, if people can
choose their classes, they will probably
eryoy them much more and learn a lot
more.
