# Shower curtains, partitions lead to sexual inequality
## 
### 
I find it amusing that, at progres
sive, libera] Stanford University, a uni
versity committed to the ideal of
equality between the sexes, there exists
an interesting form of sexual discrimi
nation.
I am referring to the differences
between men's and women's showers in
many of the dorms on campus.
Whereas the men's showers have no
individual curtains or partitions in, for
example, Stem Hall, the women's
showers have, apparently, curtains
and/or walls dividing them into individ
ual units.
If we are truly committed to equality
of the sexes, then we should see to it
that shower facilities are constructed
accordingly.
