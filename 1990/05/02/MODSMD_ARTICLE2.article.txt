In the midst of a debate concerning disfranchise
ment of voters and candidates in the recent ASSU
elections, one previously silent graduate senator
elect has renounced his position.

Bart Simpson has spoken.
"Dear Supporter Dudes," Simp
son said in a telegram sent to the
ASSU office yesterday,"I am deeply
honored by your political efforts on
my behalf, but I must tell you I
have set my sights on higher goals.
"Bart Simpson for U.S. President
in '92, man."
The telegram, which included the

courts rem a**#â„¢ Xx)B Angeles address of Fox Studios,
Simpson arrived amid a barrage of media
inquiries into the postelection controversy.
Yesterday, USA Today ran a brief story on the
controversy in its Life section. The story touched
off national media attention, according to students
who have been sitting in at the ASSU offices for
the past week. Victor Payan, former Chaparral
editor, called USA Today on Monday and faxed the
paper several Daily articles on the sit-in.
The students are protesting a ruling made by
Elections Commissioner Steve Krauss that dis
counted write-in votes for Council of Presidents,
giving the People's Platform slate a slight majority
over the Students First slate.
USA Today contacted Stanford News Service for
further information and even quoted News Service
