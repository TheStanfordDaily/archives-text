# Simpson declines senate seat
## 
### Jeannie Heltzel Staff writer 
In the midst of a debate concerning disfranchise
ment of voters and candidates in the recent ASSU
elections, one previously silent graduate senator
elect has renounced his position.

Bart Simpson has spoken.
"Dear Supporter Dudes," Simp
son said in a telegram sent to the
ASSU office yesterday,"I am deeply
honored by your political efforts on
my behalf, but I must tell you I
have set my sights on higher goals.
"Bart Simpson for U.S. President
in '92, man."
The telegram, which included the

courts rem a**#â„¢ Xx)B Angeles address of Fox Studios,
Simpson arrived amid a barrage of media
inquiries into the postelection controversy.
Yesterday, USA Today ran a brief story on the
controversy in its Life section. The story touched
off national media attention, according to students
who have been sitting in at the ASSU offices for
the past week. Victor Payan, former Chaparral
editor, called USA Today on Monday and faxed the
paper several Daily articles on the sit-in.
The students are protesting a ruling made by
Elections Commissioner Steve Krauss that dis
counted write-in votes for Council of Presidents,
giving the People's Platform slate a slight majority
over the Students First slate.
USA Today contacted Stanford News Service for
further information and even quoted News Service

writer Joel Shurkin as saying that
only the "anal retentives" regard
the sit-in as serious.
Next, KRON-TV of San Fran
cisco ran a segment on the pro
testers and the cartoon write-in
debate on its 5:00 news last night.
The report depicted the sit-in as
a partisan statement and the stu
dent body as more interested in
organizing a "Bart Simpson float
in" in University President
Donald Kennedy's pool than in
real political action.
"Entertainment Tonight" also
ran a brief segment last night in
forming viewers of the Simpson
situation at Stanford.
Sit-in participant Forrest Got
shalk said that while the sudden
media fascination with the write
in debate is helpful, he is frus
trated that the media has
"focused too much on the cartoon
aspect" of the controversy.
Though he and fellow protest
ers have fielded inquiries from a
national assortment of newspa
pers and radio stations, including
the Chicago Tribune and CBS and
NBC radio affiliates, Gotshalk
doesn't believe that "the attention
will help directly."
"We haven't received good cov
erage of anything beyond the Bart
Simpson controversy," graduate
student Perry Friedman said.
KPIX-TV may cover the sit-in
today, but Friedman is skeptical
of the station's intentions. "I
think they're here because it's
sweeps week," he said.
