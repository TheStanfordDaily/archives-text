## Being black, Greek, gay 
### 
FOUR BLACK MEN, dressed in
military-type garb, carry lanterns
and march single file. Occasionally
you can hear little grunts from them.
Whether these grunts are sounds of
pain or some secret language, I don't
know, but I suspect it's a combination
of both. What I do know is that the black
pledging season has begun.
I imagine there are a lot of white people
who are wigged out by the black frater
nity and sorority pledge process. In my
opinion, their negative reactions point to
a lack of understanding or an unwilling
ness to understand black culture and his
tory.
My mama used to say, "White people
don't know how to have fun like black
people." Perhaps Mama was making a
value judgement, but her underlying
point is that black people and white
people are different.
Sure we have a lot in common, but
we're also different. Playwright August
Wilson said it best when he said, "We're
a different people. We decorate our houses
differently. We dress differently. We party
differently. We have different ideas of jus
tice and morality. We have different re
sponses to pleasure and pain. Blacks and
whites all do the same things, they just
do them differently."
The fact that black fraternities and
sororities proudly maintain their differ
ence — their uniqueness — despite pres
sures to assimilate is incredible. When I
see those brothers and sisters marching
around, dressed alike and carrying lan
terns or potted ivy plants, I see Black,
with a capital "B."

I see a group of people who are proud
to be Black. I see a group of people who
have a definite history that has its roots
in Africa. I see all the creativity, inno
vation and beauty that forms a black
aesthetic. (Go 'head ya'll. More power to
ya\)
I suspect a lot of non-black people see
the blaok fraternity and sorority pledge
process as ridiculous. Well, it is no more
ridiculous than running butt-naked and
drunk through White Plaza. And it is
definitely no more ridiculous or unsafe
than drinking to unconsciousness.
I'm sure there are still some people
who ask "Why do they have to express
themselves this way?" In this case, the
only appropriate and necessary answer
is "Because."
Much has been said about the perceived
separatism of the black Greek system. If
a non-black demonstrates a genuine in
terest in the black community and in
carrying out the goals of the black fra
ternities or sororities, then I suspect they
will be accepted into the fraternity or
sorority. But there aren't too many non
blacks willing to do that.
There is one bone that I have to pick
with the black fraternities and sororities.
What scares me is not their pledge proc
ess or their separation from white fra
ternities or sororities, but their
incorporation of gay people.
Believe it or not, I came this close to
pledging a black fraternity. (Yes, I did,
child.) I'm not going to tell you which
one, but if it's one thing that black fra
ternities and white fraternities do have
in common is that both groups breed

machismo, and honey, machismo is not
my cup of tea.
But I keep wondering about the other
gay men and women in these organiza
tions. Ooohh, I can just see some of the
brothers and sisters cringing now. "What
does he mean, there are 'fags' and 'dikes'
in our fraternities and sororities?"
Homosexuality within the black Greek
system is a most taboo subject, and it is
dealt with only behind closed doors. I
bet there are some black Greek members
who would swear up and down that there
are no gay people in their organization.
And I bet these are the same people who
would swear that babies are brought by
the stork, that money grows on trees and
that Diana Ross does not have a weave.
That fact is, gay people are everywhere,
even in the black Greek system. The black
fraternities and sororities should, at the
very least, clarify their position on gay
membership. If they are going to be in
stitutions of brotherhood and sisterhood,
then black fraternities and sororities have
a responsibility to recognize their gay.
members and to ensure their full partic 4 -
ipation as gay and Greek.
