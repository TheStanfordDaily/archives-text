## Treatment has fewer side effects Stanford doctors show that radiation treatment is unnecessary 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
A nationwide group of pediatric
physicians — including two Stan
ford doctors — has discovered
that children with cancer may be
treated by a shorter, less intensive
form of therapy without many of
the adverse side effects of the cur
rent treatment.
Drs. Michael Link and Sarah
Donaldson of the Medical Center,
along with physicians from 32
other centers, found that the use
of anti-cancer drugs alone — in
stead of drugs combined with ra
diation — was effective in the
treatment of localized, non-
Hodgkin , & lymphomas.
Lymphomas are cancerous
growths in the lymph nodes and
immune cells, said Link, an asso
ciate professor of pediatrics at the
Medical School. They are divided
into two kinds: Hodgkin's lym
phomas, in which a certain class
of cells in the lymph nodes grow
uncontrollably, and non-
Hodgkin's lymphomas, which in
cludes lymphomas from all other
causes.
The group discovered that
chemotherapy without radiother
apy is,, as effective as a
combination of the two. By elim
inating radiotherapy, the re
searchers avoid the side effects of
the radiation, including: infer
tility, treatment-related secondary
cancers and growth retardation.
Link said the dose amount and
location of the irradiation deter
mine the side effect. For example,
a child with cancer in the mouth
may have radiation damage in the
teeth and salivary glands. Most
radiation treatment is applied to
the head, neck and abdomen, Link
said.
The elimination of the radio
therapy significantly reduces the
cost of the treatment. Link added,

"Not only did we eliminate the
radiation, we were able to admin
ister much lighter doses of chem
otherapy and get excellent
results."
For most children with cancer,
however, chemotherapy is still the
primary treatment.
But, according to Link, physi
cians hope to phase out chemo
therapy "way off in the future."
He said researchers are trying to
understand the causes of lym
phoma at a molecular level so one
day they can "shut off" the can
cers by manipulating gene struc
tures.
The study consisted of 129
children under 21 years of age

who were treated between 1983
and 1987. Half the patients were
given chemotherapy and radia
tion, while the other half received
only chemotherapy.
After six weeks, all patients
were in complete clinical remis
sion. Link said the projected sur
vival rates after four years are
nearly 88 percent for both groups.
However, the patients who took
only the anti-cancer drugs
tolerated the treatment much bet
ter than those who received the
combined treatment.
"Our goal is to minimize treat
ment while maintaining the very
best cure rates," Donaldson said.
The study was conducted by the

Pediatric Oncology Group, made
up of physicians at 32 medical
centers in the United States,
Canada and Switzerland. The
group published an article con
cerning the study in the April 26
issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine.
Link said he and other Stanford
colleagues have been working on
a follow-up study since the prep
aration of the article, and he
hopes the survival rate may in
crease.
Due to the nationwide nature
of the collaboration, this new
treatment method is already being
implemented at pediatric cancer
centers across the country.
