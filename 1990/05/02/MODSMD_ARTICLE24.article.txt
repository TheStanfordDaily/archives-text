# Hypnosis can relieve patients' pain
##

We've all seen shows in which a hypnotist
takes a person and makes him do absolutely
ridiculous things in front of a chuckling au
dience.
Though this is very entertaining, certainly
one must wonder whether or not hypnosis
has any other uses. How, for example, is
hypnosis used in a medical sense?
According to Dr. David Spiegel, associate
professor of psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences, "One of the uses (of hypnosis)
is as a pain reliever. It is also primarily used
for controlling anxiety, habit control â€” like
smoking and during the aftermath of a
trauma."
As far as hypnosis as a pain-reliever is
concerned, Spiegel said "the risk-benefit ratio

is better for hypnosis (than it is for forms of
medication). In medication, the risk is higher,
but it works for a greater number of people."
Hypnotized patients can experience altera
tions in perception and suggestibility, an open
ness to structured input from others. These
aspects of hypnosis are often used in pain
relief.
When hypnosis is used for controlling pain,
three common principles are applied. First,
the psychiatrist performing the hypnosis tells
the patient to filter the hurt out of the pain,
in other words, to realize that the pain and
the cause of the pain are two different things.
Second, patients are told not to fight the
pain. Becoming angry only intensifies the
pain. Simply relaxing can help ease the pain
considerably.
Third, patients are encouraged to use self
hypnosis. This gives them a sense of control

over their experience.
But how exactly are these principles used
in attempting to relieve patients of the pain
they are feeling? That depends upon the in
dividual.
The effectiveness of hypnosis varies from
person to person. A term called hypnotizability
is used to measure the effectiveness of hyp
nosis on a given person.
Hypnotizability is measured by testing a
person's response to hypnosis, using a scale
such as the Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale.
Hypnosis is used in several other areas as
well. For example, it can be used to help
smokers kick the habit.
"The use of hypnosis is not effective for
everyone," Spiegel commented. "However,
(when it is effective) there is very little ex
pense."
