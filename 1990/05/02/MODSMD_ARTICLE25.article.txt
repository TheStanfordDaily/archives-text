# Why Rice Krispies snap, crackle, pop

Q. Why do Rice Krispies go
• "Snap, Crackle, Pop"?
A. First, we proposed
• several theories involving
tiny animated figures, ex
plosives, etc. which were aes
thetically satisfying but not
scientifically sound. Eventu
ally, we decided to consult a
more informed source so we
spoke to Karen MacLeod, a
spokesperson for Kellog's, who
filled us in on the details of
the Rice Krispie "chorus."
Rice is first cooked and
flavored, then passed between
steel rollers to flatten it slight
ly. The cooked rice is then
toasted in very hot air, forming
bubbles which expand the
grains to several times their
original size. This results in
dry, brittle kernels with
cratered surfaces.
The craters are the key to
your morning entertainment.
When the kernel hits the milk,
or vice-versa, some parts are
wet by the milk, while other
parts are kept dry by bubbles
formed on the craters. The wet
parts expand, stressing the dry
parts until they break "Snap!
Crackle!", and stretching the
bubbles until they "Pop!"
This just goes to show that
you don't need high tech when
low tech can be so satisfying.
Q. Why is there sometimes
• an echo of my voice dur
ing long distance phone calls
to my mother?
A. According to the Bugs'
• source in the telephone
networking industry, at least
some echo is present in every
phone call. When you make a
long distance call, your conver
sation is carried on cheaper
two-wire lines to the regional
Central Office. Here it is trans
ferred to a four-wire line and
converted to a digital signal for
long distance transmission to
another Central Office. This
process is reversed there with
the call arriving at your mom's
house on a two-wire line.
At the interface between the
four-wire and two-wire lines at
the far Central Office, most of
the signal proceeds down the
line to your mother, but some
of it is reflected. This is some
what similar to seeing a reflec
tion off of a pane of glass, even
though most of the light passes
through.
If your phones were con

nected directly with no digital
processing, this echo would not
be an issue. The speed of the
electrical signal would ensure
that the delay between your
speech and its reflection would
be less than the 20 milliseconds
or so required for your brain
to perceive an echo.
However, the digital process
ing used to transmit clean long
distance calls requires the
accumulation of the signal into
"buffers." These are where
your call waits for the right
time to be fitted together with
other calls being sent over the
phone network. It is the extra
time spent in these buffers that
allows the echo delay to be long
enough to remind you of your
every spoken inanity.
To alleviate this problem,
echo filters have been designed
which sit at the two-wire to
four-wire interface at your local
Central Office. Unfortunately
these devices are not foolproof.
Sometimes they are switched
off, sometimes they fail to rec
ognize echo if the echo is
greatly delayed, and some
times, our sources claim, they
are missing.
The best way to fix a bad
connection is to hang up and
try again. The chance of having
your call routed by the exact
same route is about the same
as The Stanford Review saying
something nice about George
McGovern, if they can remem
ber who he is.
