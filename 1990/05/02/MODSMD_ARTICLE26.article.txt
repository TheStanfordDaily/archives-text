# Eating right at dinner can help you concentrate for midterms

### June Cohen Staff writer 
It'B midterm season again.
Once again, the overworked but
eternally overachieving students
of this university will hit the
books harder than usual, staying
up to more ridiculous hours and
inventfng increasingly creative
methods to stay awake through
out the whole ordeal.
Most of us learn early in our
Stanford careers to avoid certain
situations and study locations
when it's time to really buckle
down. For instance, one does not
settle down in Green Library's
purple chairs of death to study
for any class that one is taking
for a grade. It just isn't adaptive
behavior.
However, some of the methods
we do employ to stay awake are

as counterproductive as studying
in Green Library.
The foods one eats before and
while studying play a crucial role
in one's ability to remain not only
awake, but alert and functional
through a long night of Nietzche
and Newton.
It all starts at dinner.
Have you ever noticed that after
a particularly large meal, you feel
suddenly drained, lethargic and
extremely tired, disproportionate
to the amount of energy you in
vested in shoveling down that
chocolate cake?
The reason for this lies in the
influx of food, which causes the
blood to rush to the stomach to
aid in the digestive process.
The channeling of blood to the
gut results in less being available
for use by the brain and therefore
deprives the brain of glucose and

oxygen, leaving an individual
feeling drowsy.
The extent and duration of the
drowsiness, however, is dependant
largely on both the amount of
calories and type of food con
sumed.
Blood is sent to the stomach in
proportion to the amount of
calories ingested, but the diges
tion time is stretched out accord
ing to the different nutrients to

be absorbed, extending the
energy-using process and your
nap-time.
Carbohydrates are broken down
first, and start being absorbed 15
to 20 minutes after consumption.
Protein digestion kicks in about
25 minutes to an hour later and
protein absorption peaks just as
carbohydrate uptake is slowing
down.
Fats aren't digested until
protein absorption wanes, stretch
ing the entire process for three
to five hours after eating. The
higher the meal's fat content,
therefore, the longer it sits in
one's stomach, monopolizing the
body's energy. For the college stu
dent this means several hours of
drowsiness and inefficient study
ing before the meal wears off.
It is a good idea, therefore, to
start off your study night not by

fueling up for a long night, but
perhaps by eating a lighter dinner
than usual — one that's high in
complex carbohydrates to fill you
up, but low in fat to mitigate the
energy-sapping effects of diges
tion.
At some point during a night
of studying, you are bound to get
hungry, especially when you stay
up well into the morning hours
after an early dinner at 5 p.m. or
6 p.m.
Late-night snacking is more a
rule than an exception in college,
but the type of snack chosen can
have a significant influence over
whether it helps or hinders your
studying efforts. In general, the
healthier choices tend to be more
advantageous in staying awake as
well.
The candy bars, cookies and
Ding Dongs that most of us reach

for have the unfortunate effects
of a brief sugar high. After con
sumption, an individual's blood
sugar briefly elevates — then
quickly drops below the original
level — leaving you more tired
and probably craving more sugar.
Some healthful alternatives to
satisfy midnight cravings include
fruit, cold cereal, low-fat regular
and frozen yogurt, pretzels and
popcorn.
Keep in mind, of course, that
no matter how healthfully you
snack it still isn't a good idea to
consistently keep long hours. The
right snack choices can help you
stay alert in the short run, but
in the long run, lack of sleep will
catch up with you — with the
overall effect of greatly reducing
your memory and concentration
skills.
