## Gaels' find no help from above Cardinal downs overmatched St. Mary's easily in 10-3 yawner 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
MORAGA, Calif. — All right, who
schedules these silly things?
Actually, yesterday's game between
the Stanford and St. Mary's baseball
teams had some promise to be more
than a typical Cardinal-mauls-non
conference-opponent game. After all, the
Gaels had defeated Stanford 6-5 at
Sunken Diamond back on Feb. 20.
The Cardinal, however, had gone into
that game on the tail end of a five-day
trip to Los Angeles. They'd played seven
innings on Sunday night, two complete
games the next day and then taken a
seven-hour bus ride to get home at 1:30
a.m. the morning of the Gael loss.
St. Mary's got no such help this time
around, as a revolving door-full of
pitchers got rocked yesterday by the
Cardinal, 10-3.

The win in the non-league, non
crucial, non-stressful, non-exciting
game in front of a non-crowd gives the
Cardinal a 43-9 record heading into this
weekend's series against 16-37 (3-24 in
the Six-Pac) California, a non-team.
Yesterday's game did get one impor
tant thing accomplished for the Cardi
nal: It gave freshman pitcher Greg Mix
a chance to get right back on the mound
after being sent through the wringer
last Friday at Arizona State.
Mix, who suffered through a pitcher's
nightmare in one inning against the
Sun Devils (five hits, five walks, 10
runs) last week, completely stifled the
Gaels yesterday, giving up only three
hits in the six innings he pitched.
"We wanted to get him right back
out there," Stanford Coach Mark Mar-

quess said. "[ASU] was a tough situa
tion to put him in, and he threw well
in relief for us that one time (vs. Stanis
laus State last Monday).
"His arm is good and he's had good
stuff, so we figured if we got four or
five innings out of him, that'd be a
great effort," Marquess said. "He gave
us six."
Mix, who only let one St. Mary's run
ner get as far as second base, did think
a little about last week's disaster before
taking the field. "How could you not?"
he said. "(Today) I just wanted to go
out and show I had something."
He did that just fine, and his team
mates gave him more than enough sup
port. It took the Cardinal all of seven
pitches to score against starter Mark
Chiaruuci, a sidearm slinger (Dan
Quisenberry is alive and well and get
ting shelled for the Gaels), as JefT Ham
monds led off with a patented shallow
gap double and came home on a single
by Troy Paulsen.
David Holbrook made it three-zip
when he doubled in both Paulsen and
Tim Griffin, but then Chiarucci (who
came into the game with a 3.01 ERA)
caught fire, mowing down 10 of the
next 11 batters.
The fifth inning, though, got
Chiarucci an early exit and started a
parade of pitchers. (St. Mary's would
eventually send six hurlers to their hill,
apparently trying to draw out the game
as much as possible.) Catcher Mark
Skeels started things off with a ringing
double over center fielder James
Mouton's head, and Hammonds fol-

lowed up with a towering homer to left.
That was it for Chiarucci, as lefty
Toby Foreman took over. A single,
double, another single and a walk later
the bases were loaded for Roger Bur
nett, who made it 8-0 with a ground
rule, under-the-chain-link-outfield
fence double, and the game was all over.
Except, of course, for the late-game
free-wheeling substituting, which gave
just about everyone on the bench a
chance to get in on the action. All the
subs did a solid job, but no one distin
guished themselves quite as much as
Rob Robbins.
Robbins, a native of Moraga, came in
as a pinch-runner for Jeff Light (who
had been hit by a pitch) in the ninth.
Why Robbins? "For his speed," Mar
quess said. Uh-huh.
Steve Solomon promptly sent the ball
waaay deep to left, and Robbins, whose
speed on the bases could probably be
timed with a calendar, took off. He was
almost to third base when 5-foot-4 left
fielder Tony ("You're too short for this
ride!") Dello caught the ball on the run
at the warning track. Oops.
Robbins was so hung out to dry you
could have folded him and put him in
the drawer, but he turned around and
started chugging back to first anyway.
Dello'B throw reached the cutoff man
about the time Robbins was rounding
second — and the ball scooted away
from shortstop James Mouton, past
first baseman Craig Billed, and all the
way to the foul fence.
