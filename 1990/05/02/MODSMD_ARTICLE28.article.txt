# All you ever wanted to know about upcoming Cardinal successes
## 
### 
Barring any unforseen change of for
tune, Sunken Diamond will play
host to one of the eight regionals
that determine who will play in the Col
lege World Series.
For those of you who were not here
in 1987, the last time Stanford hosted
such an event, the recommendation here
is to make sure you don't miss this one.
You'll see some of the best in collegiate
baseball and get a chance to watch the
Cardinal's charge to its third national
crown in four years.
It will also be your last chance to see
Mike Mussina, Stan Spencer, Tim Griffin
and Paul Carey in their Stanford uni
forms. In June, all four will be drafted
by mtyor league teams. By this time in
1992, two or three of them may be in
The Show . . .
In The League, a.k.a. NBA basketball,
Stanford great Todd Lichti turned in his
best game as a pro in Denver's playoff
opener. Always at his best in big games,
the 6-foot-4 guard scored 22 points,
grabbed 13 rebounds and dished out eight
assists — all team highs. The rek ounding
total matched that of the Spurs David
Robinson, who is 7-2.
New Nuggets owners Peter Bynoe and

Bertram Lee have promised a houseclean
ing in the offseason. Denver is primarily
an old team that is aging quickly. Look
for Lichti to play a major role on the
new Nuggets in 1991.
He is already a superior penetrator and,
when he becomes comfortable shooting
the 20-footer with a hand in his face
while falling backwards (all the top pros
can swish it), Lichti might be an all-star
The pink slips are being handed out
in the Athletic Department as a result
of the budget deficit. While the average
student won't notice any difference, ath
letes needing a trainer next year will.
The training room, staffed by a group
that already works round the clock, is
losing two people.
In addition, Jennifer Leathers of the
department's marketing arm is moving
on. Again, few will feel the impact. She'll
be sorely missed by those who know her,
though ...
Men's tennis fell to third in the latest
Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis Association
rankings. Regardless, the Cardinal is still
the odds-on favorite to capture its third
straight national title. Jared Palmer,
Super Frosh 11, is back from another

knee injury and played quite well
at the Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships.
Super Frosh I, Jonathan Stark, is al
most certainly going to be in the lineup
for NCAAs even though the stress frac
ture in his foot may not be completely
healed. Together, Stark and Palmer are
money at No. 1 doubles. Individually,
they are nearly as golden in singles.
That's three-fifths of the point scoring
the Cardinal needs to win each dual
match along the way. Rumor has it the
champagne is already on ice in Coach
Dick Gould's refrigerator . ..
On the women's side, senior Lisa Green
finds out Thursday if she makes the 64-
player NCAA individual singles tourna
ment. Green is ranked 75th in the recent
computer poll, but it was compiled before
she recorded a win over No. 25 Lisa
Albano of California.
If Green, a three-time semifinalist, is
left out of the draw in her final collegiate
season, they probably should cancel the
event. If she gets in — it appears likely
at this point — seeded players are advised
to watch out for her to pull up an upset
special in the early rounds.
Meredith McGrath, Sandra Birch, Teri

Whitlinger and Sandra Birch all have a
chance to pull oft an unprecedented triple
at NCAAs: winning the team, singles and
doubles titles. Birch came oh so close last
year, losing in the doubles final . . .
When football Coach Denny Green sug
gested at the end of the season that Jason
Palumbis might help at quarterback in
the coming campaign, many Cardinal
watchers quietly snickered. Palumbis was
not that successful his first time around
and was going to need surgery on his
shoulder.
The operation went well and Palumbis
is throwing the ball with much more
authority. He is likely to emerge from
spring football as the No. 1 quarterback.
Green, who wants to win very badly,
believes Palumbis can make that happen.

A redshirt sophomore, Palumbis i3

and just may be the field general that
leads Stanford to its first winning season
since 1987 . . .
Nolan Ryan has chalked up yet another
incredible milestone. Ryan's 12th one hit
ter last week was spoiled only by a check
swing single off the bat of Ron Kittle in
the second inning. Ryan also struck out
15, the 200 th time he has recorded double
figure strikeouts in a game.
Remarkably, as the Ryan Express
closes in on win 300, his shelf is devoid
of a single Cy Young Award. But Ryan
is off to his best start in 15 years and
Bret Saberhagen's even-year curse seems
not to have been lifted. Maybe 1990 is
the year for this most remarkable phys
ical specimen to bring home the trophy.
At 43, he still throws over 90 miles
per hour. He can punch his ticket to
Cooperstown five years after he retires.
Meanwhile, after two decades in the
game, he remains one of baseball's dom
inant pitchers.
Ryan will probably retire at the end of
the '91 season and the game will be much


Mark
Rogowsky
worse off without him . . .
The Rockets beat the Lakers
last night in Houston. Were it not
for a remarkable L.A. comeback
from 19 down Sunday, the Lakers
would be facing elimination — on
the road. Instead, Magic and Co.
will probably knock off the Pis
tons in the NBA Finals. Yawn ...
Apparently, the October 17
earthquake did not intimidate the
top recruits in men's swimming,
women's swimming, men's tennis
and women's tennis. They are all
coming to Stanford . . .

goes to many for this entry): Why,
in the time of budget cutting, is
the athletic department bringing
back the cheerleaders?
Two years ago, a similar at
tempt to resurrect the "pep
squad" resulted in a bunch of stu

one dollar, it's probably money
down the drain. Now, if the
money were spent on getting a

Nolan Ryan has chalked up yet another
incredible milestone. Ryan's 12th one hit
ter last week was spoiled only by a check
swing single off the bat of Ron Kittle in
the second inning. Ryan also struck out
15, the 200 th time he has recorded double
figure strikeouts in a game.
Remarkably, as the Ryan Express
closes in on win 300, his shelf is devoid
of a single Cy Young Award. But Ryan
is off to his best start in 15 years and
Bret Saberhagen's even-year curse seems
not to have been lifted. Maybe 1990 is
the year for this most remarkable phys
ical specimen to bring home the trophy.
At 43, he still throws over 90 miles
per hour. He can punch his ticket to
Cooperstown five years after he retires.
Meanwhile, after two decades in the
game, he remains one of baseball's dom
inant pitchers.
Ryan will probably retire at the end of
the '91 season and the game will be much

Rogowsky
worse off without him . . .
The Rockets beat the Lakers
last night in Houston. Were it not
for a remarkable L.A. comeback
from 19 down Sunday, the Lakers
would be facing elimination — on
the road. Instead, Magic and Co.
will probably knock off the Pis
tons in the NBA Finals. Yawn ...
Apparently, the October 17
earthquake did not intimidate the
top recruits in men's swimming,
women's swimming, men's tennis
and women's tennis. They are all
coming to Stanford . . .

It-makes-us-wonder file (credit
goes to many for this entry): Why,
in the time of budget cutting, is
the athletic department bringing
back the cheerleaders?
Two years ago, a similar at
tempt to resurrect the "pep
squad" resulted in a bunch of stu
dents being booed off the court
in Maples Pavilion. If it costs even
one dollar, it's probably money
down the drain. Now, if the
money were spent on getting a
real fight song . . .

Mark Rogowsky has been at this
for what seems like a really long
time. He actually thinks "All
Right Now" is all right most of
the time.
Barring any unforseen change of for
tune, Sunken Diamond will play
host to one of the eight regionals
that determine who will play in the Col
lege World Series.
For those of you who were not here
in 1987, the last time Stanford hosted
such an event, the recommendation here
is to make sure you don't miss this one.
You'll see some of the best in collegiate
baseball and get a chance to watch the
Cardinal's charge to its third national
crown in four years.
It will also be your last chance to see
Mike Mussina, Stan Spencer, Tim Griffin
and Paul Carey in their Stanford uni
forms. In June, all four will be drafted
by mtyor league teams. By this time in
1992, two or three of them may be in
The Show . . .
In The League, a.k.a. NBA basketball,
Stanford great Todd Lichti turned in his
best game as a pro in Denver's playoff
opener. Always at his best in big games,
the 6-foot-4 guard scored 22 points,
grabbed 13 rebounds and dished out eight
assists — all team highs. The rek ounding
total matched that of the Spurs David
Robinson, who is 7-2.
New Nuggets owners Peter Bynoe and

Bertram Lee have promised a houseclean
ing in the offseason. Denver is primarily
an old team that is aging quickly. Look
for Lichti to play a major role on the
new Nuggets in 1991.
He is already a superior penetrator and,
when he becomes comfortable shooting
the 20-footer with a hand in his face
while falling backwards (all the top pros
can swish it), Lichti might be an all-star
The pink slips are being handed out
in the Athletic Department as a result
of the budget deficit. While the average
student won't notice any difference, ath
letes needing a trainer next year will.
The training room, staffed by a group
that already works round the clock, is
losing two people.
In addition, Jennifer Leathers of the
department's marketing arm is moving
on. Again, few will feel the impact. She'll
be sorely missed by those who know her,
though ...
Men's tennis fell to third in the latest
Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis Association
rankings. Regardless, the Cardinal is still
the odds-on favorite to capture its third
straight national title. Jared Palmer,
Super Frosh 11, is back from another

knee injury and played quite well
at the Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships.
Super Frosh I, Jonathan Stark, is al
most certainly going to be in the lineup
for NCAAs even though the stress frac
ture in his foot may not be completely
healed. Together, Stark and Palmer are
money at No. 1 doubles. Individually,
they are nearly as golden in singles.
That's three-fifths of the point scoring
the Cardinal needs to win each dual
match along the way. Rumor has it the
champagne is already on ice in Coach
Dick Gould's refrigerator . ..
On the women's side, senior Lisa Green
finds out Thursday if she makes the 64-
player NCAA individual singles tourna
ment. Green is ranked 75th in the recent
computer poll, but it was compiled before
she recorded a win over No. 25 Lisa
Albano of California.
If Green, a three-time semifinalist, is
left out of the draw in her final collegiate
season, they probably should cancel the
event. If she gets in — it appears likely
at this point — seeded players are advised
to watch out for her to pull up an upset
special in the early rounds.
Meredith McGrath, Sandra Birch, Teri

Whitlinger and Sandra Birch all have a
chance to pull oft an unprecedented triple
at NCAAs: winning the team, singles and
doubles titles. Birch came oh so close last
year, losing in the doubles final . . .
When football Coach Denny Green sug
gested at the end of the season that Jason
Palumbis might help at quarterback in
the coming campaign, many Cardinal
watchers quietly snickered. Palumbis was
not that successful his first time around
and was going to need surgery on his
shoulder.
The operation went well and Palumbis
is throwing the ball with much more
authority. He is likely to emerge from
spring football as the No. 1 quarterback.
Green, who wants to win very badly,
believes Palumbis can make that happen.
