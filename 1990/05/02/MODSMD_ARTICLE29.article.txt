Dan Hanan and Parker Blackman, seniors
whose Stanford careers came to an abrupt end
last Thursday against UCLA, were named to
the All-WIVA team yesterday. Joining the pair
is sophomore Duncan Blackman, who was a
third-team selection.
"It's great to be named to the same team as
guys like Bryan Ivie, Trevor Schirman, and
Carlos [Bricono]," Hanan said. "I really look
up to them and feel honored to be placed on
their level."
Hanan joined Bricono, who attends the Uni
versity of Hawaii, Ivie of USC, and Schirman
of UCLA, as well as Mark Kerins and Brett
Winslow of Long Beach State, on the first
team. Hanan, who has made the first squad
for the second consecutive year, will go down
in the Stanford annals for breaking Olympian
Scott Fortune's career kills record earlier this
year.
Parker Blackman made All-WIVA as a
second-team selection. Starting at setter for
the Cardinal, he averaged 18 assists per game
and was among the team leaders in several
other categories.
Parker's brother Duncan, the only sopho
more to make the team, seemed happier for
his teammates than for himself. "I'm flat
tered... I didn't expect to be named at all,"
Blackman said. He then quickly added, "I'm
glad that Parker and Dan got the recognition
that they deserved."
The loss of Parker Blackman and Hanan to
graduation is a considerable blow to the Car
dinal's hopes for a national championship in
1991. However, the team has mitigated the
damage with the addition of three top recruits.
High school sensations Canyon Ceman, Rick
Osterloh and Joe Burghardt have
signed letters of intent to attend
Stanford.
Ceman, who plays setter for No.
1-ranked Mira Costa High School,
will try to fill the void left by
Blackman. Referred to as "the
best high school prospect in the
country" by coach Fred Sturm,
Ceman participated in the 1989
Olympic festival on the victorious
West team.
Osterloh, a two-sport star who

was actively recruited by many
basketball programs, will proba
bly be moved to outside hitter
from his high school position of
middle blocker. His outstanding
leaping ability was cited as the
primary reason for the switch.
Burghardt is a product of
Loyola High School, which has
proven to be somewhat of a vol
leyball factory for the Cardinal.
Several of the school's alumni
have gone on to play for Stanford.
Burghardt, who is recovering
from knee surgery, is relatively
inexperienced but has the poten
tial to develop into an outstanding
player.
