Dan Hanan and Parker Blackman, seniors
whose Stanford careers came to an abrupt end
last Thursday against UCLA, were named to
the All-WIVA team yesterday. Joining the pair
is sophomore Duncan Blackman, who was a
third-team selection.
"It's great to be named to the same team as
guys like Bryan Ivie, Trevor Schirman, and
Carlos [Bricono]," Hanan said. "I really look
up to them and feel honored to be placed on
their level."
Hanan joined Bricono, who attends the Uni
versity of Hawaii, Ivie of USC, and Schirman
of UCLA, as well as Mark Kerins and Brett
Winslow of Long Beach State, on the first
team. Hanan, who has made the first squad
for the second consecutive year, will go down
in the Stanford annals for breaking Olympian
Scott Fortune's career kills record earlier this
year.
Parker Blackman made All-WIVA as a
second-team selection. Starting at setter for
the Cardinal, he averaged 18 assists per game
and was among the team leaders in several
other categories.
Parker's brother Duncan, the only sopho
more to make the team, seemed happier for
his teammates than for himself. "I'm flat
tered... I didn't expect to be named at all,"
Blackman said. He then quickly added, "I'm
glad that Parker and Dan got the recognition
that they deserved."
The loss of Parker Blackman and Hanan to
graduation is a considerable blow to the Car
dinal's hopes for a national championship in
1991. However, the team has mitigated the
damage with the addition of three top recruits.
