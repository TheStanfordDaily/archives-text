# Election brouhaha not new
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
Even though this spring's ASSU elections
were contentious enough to merit local and
national media attention, election controver
sies are nothing new to Stanford's political
scene.
Elections for the past three years have been
plagued by a bevy of problems including ques
tionable vote tabulation, ineligible students
being placed on the ballot and, in one case,
the neglect of overseas students' votes.
Close elections over the past several years
have often necessitated runoffs. The races for
Council of Presidents and Senior Class presi
dents both had runoffs last year.
Last year's election was also marred by prob
lems concerning the tabulation of paper ballots
cast at the Law School. Although the ASSU
elections use computer voting, a small per
centage of paper ballots are still used. Election
officials forgot to count about 50 paper ballots
cast in the primary election.
Moreover, last year's Student Conduct
Legislative Council election was called into
question. One student withdrew from the race,
yet her name was not removed from the ballot.
The eligibility of another student, Leonard
Adler, was questioned because he
was a senior and was running un
der the assumption that he would
be admitted to the Law School.
Though he won a seat on the
SCLC, he had to give it up when
he was not accepted.
Spring 1988 was another ban
ner season for election controver
sies. The ASSU ordered the votes
to be counted three times before
actually announcing winners.
Also in 1988, the Black Student
Union initially lost its fee request
by a margin of 10 votes. But a
review of the election procedures
revealed that the Elections Com
mission forgot to mail ballots to

more than 200 overseas students.
Many of the initial election
results were in limbo until this
error was rectified. When the
overseas ballots were tabulated,
the BSU garnered enough votes
to gain its fee request.
Compounding these difficulties,
there were several complaints
that the use of voting machines
borrowed from Santa Clara
County caused delays and inac
curacies. There were two pages of
fee requests and senate candi
dates, but several voters were un
aware of the second page.
In 1987, before the ASSU used
computers for voting, votes were
counted by Scantron machines.
Because of problems with the
machines, the initial tabulation of
votes was not released until a
week after the elections.
