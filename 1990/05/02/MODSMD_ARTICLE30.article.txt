# Second choice?
## Sprinter Gaines adapts to the fast track at Stanford 
### J.B. Barr 
Chryste Gaines, the top female sprinter
in Stanford track and field history, didn't
want to go to Stanford.
Gaines, now a sophomore, favored Flor
ida. Her father, however, had other ideas.
When he wouldn't sign her letter of intent
to enroll there, she found herself headed
to the Farm.
The result of this change in plans has
been as beneficial to Gaines as it has been
dynamic for Stanford track.
"My father was gung-ho about Stanford,
but I wanted to go to Florida," Gaines
said. "But, I'm happy to be here now."
In making her choice of schools, Gaines
believed Florida would offer her a low
pressure academic environment and a
proven sprint program. But now, emerging
as one of the top young sprinters in the
country, and considering medical school,
Stanford is apparently the place for her.
The transition from top high school
prospect to Cardinal track star has not
been smooth, however. "It was hard to
adjust," Gaines said. "I was ready to go
back home (freshman year)."
"Every freshman has freshman-itis,"
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson added. "All
the comforts which made Chryste number
one in high school were suddenly snatched
away in a matter of months."
To cure her "illness," Johnson and
Gaines set a list of priorities for her fresh
man year. These included becoming inte
grated academically, fully recovering from
a hamstring pull suffered in high school,
and earning a spot on the junior national
team. She accomplished all three of her
goals.
"From that standpoint, she had an ex
tremely successful freshman year,"
Johnson said.

Part of her success included setting a
school record 11.44 seconds in the 100 and
a freshman 200 record of 24.0.
Her real potential, however, is beginning
to surface this year. Gaines has already
broken both the 100- and 200-meter school
records. She bettered her own 100-meter
record with an 11.31 clocking at the Texas
Relays earlier this month, and just last
weekend ran 23.84 against Cal to set a
new 200 record.
Gaines has certainly learned her
freshman-year lessons well.
Perhaps the most difficult aspect of her
adjustment included accustoming herself
to the rigors of the pre-med curriculum.
"Now I know what I have to do to get
good grades," Gaines said.
"School compo first, but track comes
right afler."
Johnson agrees. "There are plenty of fast
black athletes out there," he says. "What
we don't have is enough black doctors, and
especially black women doctors."
If medical school is Gaines' top future
goal, making the Olympics are a dose sec
ond.
Gaines hopes her experience in the 1988
Olympic Trials will help to earn her a spot
on the team in 1992. But her earlier ex
perience was anything but pleasant.
"It was horrifying," she said. "It's not
like a regular track meet."
In a "regular" meet, Gaines usually
doesn't find herself running in a heat
against Florence GrifTith-Joyner, the fast
est woman in the world.
Nevertheless, Gaines remains optimistic
about her chances of making the Olympic
team two years down the road. "You don't
know which way the ball will fall (at Olym-

greatest woman sprinter.
pic Trials)," she said. "Anybody
could take over."
In the immediate future,
Gaines has her sights set one
month down the road: the NCAA
championships.
"I want to win a national cham
pionship," she said. The lofty goal
appears to be well within reach
as Gaines currently owns the
second-best collegiate time for the
100 meters this season.
Gaines' high aspirations are
part of what makes her such a
fierce competitor. "She's taught
me some things about being com
petitive," said training partner
and teammate Jackie Edwards.
"Especially about not being afraid
of the competition."
Gaines' experience with
Griffith-Joyner in the Olympic
Trials is paying off as she has
taken a page out of Flo-Jo's book
and assumed the role of in
timidator.
"She uses her nerves to do bet
ter — she's very aggressive," Ed
wards explained.
Thanks to a little parental wis
dom, Gaines should continue to
terrorize the competition while
wearing Stanford cardinal and
white.

Gaines' high aspirations are
part of what makes her such a
fierce competitor. "She's taught
me some things about being com
petitive," said training partner
and teammate Jackie Edwards.
"Especially about not being afraid
of the competition."
Gaines' experience with
Griffith-Joyner in the Olympic
Trials is paying off as she has
taken a page out of Flo-Jo's book
and assumed the role of in
timidator.
"She uses her nerves to do bet
ter — she's very aggressive," Ed
wards explained.
Thanks to a little parental wis
dom, Gaines should continue to
terrorize the competition while
wearing Stanford cardinal and
white.
