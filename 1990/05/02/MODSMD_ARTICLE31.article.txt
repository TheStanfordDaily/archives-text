# Blazers clinch in three
## 
### 
DALLAS (AP) â€” Jerome Ker
sey and Terry Porter took com
mand after Buck Williams suf
fered an eye injury and the
Portland Blazers rolled to a 106-
92 victory over the Dallas
Mavericks and a three-game
sweep of their NBA first-round
playoff series.
Williams played only in the first
period and missed the rest of the
game after he was hit in the eye
by James Donaldson's elbow.
The Mavs rallied from a 17-
point deficit in the second half to
come within two points at 87-85
with 5:45 to play.
But Kersey, Porter, and Clyde
Drexler beat back the rally. Kersey
scored 29 points, Porter had 20
points and Drexler made 20.
Rolando Blackman led Dallas
with 20 points and Herb Williams
contributed 17 off the bench.
Dallas came from eight points
down to tie the game at 40 mid
way through the second quarter
but Portland went on an 18-3 run
to lead 58-43 at halftime.
Portland's hustling defense
shut down the Mavs, who only

scored three points on their last
12 possessions of the half and the
Trail Blazers forced them into
four turnovers.
Rockets 114, Lakers 108
HOUSTON (AP) - Sleepy
Floyd scored 23 points and set a
club playoff record with 18 assists
last night, leading Houston to a
114-108 victory over Los Angeles
that broke the Lakers' 20-game
first-round playoff winning
streak.
Houston trails the Lakers 2-1
in the best-of-5 series, which
resumes tomorrow night in The
Summit. The Lakers had not lost
a game in the opening round since
Houston beat them in 1981.
Floyd's basket with 22 seconds
to go broke a string of eight
straight points by the Lakers that
had cut Houston's lead to 111-108
with 46 seconds to play.
James Worthy led the Lakers
with 26 points, Orlando Woolridge
scored 18 and Magic Johnson
added 17. Johnson was scoreless
in the fourth quarter.
