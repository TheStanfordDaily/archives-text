UCLA student bids for governor
A UCLA undergraduate will run for governor
of California against the favored Republican can
didate, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson.
Jeff Greene, a 21-year-old political science
announced his candidacy last week. He
said he hopes the move will send a message to
the Republican Party to get back on track. Greene
said, "Pete Wilson's stance on everything is
against what we, as conservative Republicans,
are for."
Greene said he hopes his anti-abortion, pro-gun
and limited-government position will win support
with California's voters and that, as long as people
remember that a good conservative candidate
ran, he will feel as if he won, regardless of the
election's outcome.
