# Support rings in for Bell
## 200 rally for Harvard prof., diversity in law faculty 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
More than 200 students
rallied in front of the Law
School yesterday, calling for a
more diverse faculty at both
Harvard and Stanford Law
Schools.
The rally, sponsored by the
Coalition for Diversified Facul
ty, supported Derrick Bell, Har
vard Law School's first tenured
black professor, who requested
an unpaid leave of absence last
week until Harvard appoints a
tenured black woman to its fac
ulty.
As pro-Bell banners posted on
the second floor of the Law
School swayed in the wind, a
lively lunchtime crowd chanted,
"Harvard Law, go to hell. We
support Derrick Bell."
Second-year law student
Chris Chambers, a speaker at
the rally, said she is "happy Bell
has chosen to make such a
profound statement about his
dissatisfaction at Harvard. It is
a difficult and personal
sacrifice."
Rally speakers said Stanford's
track record in granting tenure
to minority faculty also needs
to be examined.
Third-vear law student Whit

ney Leigh charged at the rally
that Stanford, like Harvard, has
failed to give tenure to qualified
women and people of color.
Currently, of 43 tenured pro
fessors at Stanford Law School,
there are two tenured minority
professors — one black man and
one Latino man. The school does
not have any tenured minority
women or tenured faculty that
are openly gay or lesbian.
At Harvard, of 61 tenured fac
ulty members, there are three
black men and five white wom
en.
Stanford Law Prof. Charles
Lawrence, a tenured black pro
fessor, said at the rally the prob
lem of qualifications in the
appointment process at schools
like Harvard and Stanford
reminds him "of the evil queen
in Snow White who looks in the
mirror and asks, who is the
fairest of them all?"
"The answer is, it is [those]
who are white that are the
fairest of them all," said
Lawrence.
Lawrence said that the "old
boy network" is very much
entrenched within law schools.
Decisions for tenure tend to be
based on accolades which are
very subjective, such as whether
one was elected to the law

review or had a judicial
clerkship, he added.
Bell "has said he will no
longer be a part of this charade
of searching for excellence in the
white man's mirrors," Lawrence
said.
Bell created a stir when he
taught at Stanford as a visiting
professor of constitutional law
in 1986. Some white Stanford
faculty and students questioned
Bell's credentials because his
class stressed race and slavery
as central to the development
and formation of constitutional
law doctrine.
Students began attending
other classes and complaining
to the administration that Bell
was a poor teacher, said
Lawrence.
Lawrence blamed the exodus
of students on "unconscious and
conscious racism by students
unprepared to deal with Bell's
approach."
After Bell's experience, the
Law School said it would make
an effort to bring in more mi
nority faculty members,
Lawrence said, adding that the
Law School has violated this
promise. "This year four people
joined our faculty. Three of
them were men; all of them were
white," he said.
