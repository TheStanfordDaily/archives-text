# Opinions vary widely on 'tenure' for researchers
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
Giving "tenure" to non-teaching re
searchers has been seen as a move toward,
a move away from and a move "at right
angles" to University President Donald
Kennedy's vision of increased emphasis on
undergraduate teaching.

News analysis

To plug a brain drain at the University's
policy centers and institutes, the Faculty
Senate's Commitee on the Professoriate has
proposed giving the status of professorship
to a few top experts in specialized fields.
In November 1988, world-renowned arms
control expert Sidney Drell resigned the
directorship of the Center for International
Security and Arms Control, citing the
futililty of attempting to secure Stanford
professorships for some specialized re
searchers at the center.
If the recent recommendations are ap
proved, these scholars, who would be called
senior fellows, would be able to obtain in
definite appointments and the right to
direct and seek funding for their own re
search projects, just like full professors.
But, unlike professors, these scholars would

not necessarily be required to teach.
No one interviewed about the status of
these scholars disagrees with Peter
Gregory, associate dean of the School of
Medicine and a committee member, who
said their presence "does sort of add to
the atmosphere of the University."
And in a brief statement to The Daily
last week, Kennedy wrote that retaining
these scholars would be "somewhat help
ful" to the realization of his goal of im
proved undergraduate education, which he
stated in an April 5 speech to the Academic
Council.
However, in a statement to The Daily
yesterday, Drell, who is still the deputy
director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, wrote that the proposal does not
go far enough in integrating these research
ers into teaching programs.
"I don't think this (proposal) is the best
way to integrate the work of such inter
disciplinary centers doing serious academic
work into the teaching programs at Stan
ford at both the undergraduate and grad
uate levels," he wrote.
"If one wants the senior fellows to be
integral parts of the teaching program, then
they should be professors. That's what it
means to be a professor," wrote Drell.
Arms control expert and former center
researcher Ted Postol, who was
not granted an academic appoint
ment in the Political Science De
partment, expressed similar
sentiments. Postol left the center
shortly after Drell resigned his
position.
Lyman Van Slyke, director of
the Center for East Asian Studies,
said he had "mixed feelings"
about granting the status of pro
fessor to scholars who would not
be required to teach.
"It is important to have good
people in these institutes . . . but
[do theyl have a responsibility to
teach?" he asked.

Economics Prof. Kenneth Ar
row, a member of the committee's
advisory board, said the proposal
is "really ... at right angles" to
the thrust of Kennedy's goal,
which he summarized as an ex
hortation for tenured professors
in particular to "perform better."
Gregory emphasized that the
committee's recommendations —
the product of two years of study
of a broad group of issues con
cerning the professoriate — were
written before Kennedy gave his
speech.
The Faculty Senate was origi
nally slated to vote on the com
mittee's recommendations
tomorrow, but Gregory expects
debate to continue until at least
May 24.
