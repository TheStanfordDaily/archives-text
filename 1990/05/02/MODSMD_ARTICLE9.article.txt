# Asbestos forces move of Cowell physical therapy
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Shortly after Tim Bowman
moved into his physical therapy
office at Cowell Student Health
Center, he suspected the presence
of asbestos, a carcinogen in some
forms.
Now, seven years later, Bow
man has found out he was right.
Last week, Stanford's Environ
mental Health and Safety Depart
ment closed Bowman's office and
his therapy facilities, citing as
bestos levels that exceeded the
University's limit.
"We decided that it was wise
not to have people stay" in those
facilities located in the Cowell
basement, said Jeffrey Bramlett,
asbestos program coordinator for
Health and Safety.
The physical therapy facilites
at Cowell include specialized
equipment and occupy several
rooms. Since last week, Bowman
has been using the training quar
ters at the Athletics Department
in the mornings and an im
provised infirmary room in the
afternoons.
"I'm pleased that something is
being done and that I'm no longer
working there," Bowman said,
"but I am somewhat annoyed and
distressed at the way it was done
and the time frame involved."
Even though Bowman sus
pected an unhealthy presence of
asbestos in his office for many
years, it was only after repeated
urging from him and Harvey
Weinstein, acting director of
Cowell, that Health and Safety
began conducting thorough air

sampling of Bowman's offices.
However, as soon as Health and
Safety determined that the air
readings of asbestos in Bowman's
offices exceeded Stanford's level
for non-occupational exposure,
"they gave me five minutes to get
everything out of the office," said
Bowman.
"The measures taken by Health
and Safety were precautionary
and prudent," said Weinstein. "I
pretty much applaud what they've
been doing.
"I don't know what health risk
Tim has been exposed to . . . but
I sincerely doubt that any stu
dents have been at risk,"
Weinstein added, explaining that
risk of lung cancer from asbestos
exposure depends upon the con
centration of the substance and
the frequency of exposure.
Although the standards of the
federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration set an as
bestos exposure limit of 0.2 fibers
per cubic centimeters in an eight
hour period, Stanford follows a
much stricter 0.01 level set by the
National Institute of Occupa
tional Safety and Health.
During the next few weeks,
Health and Safety will decide how
best to remove the health risk
from the physical therapy room.
The department will also arrange
for Bowman to be tested for
health risks.
Does he feel that Stanford
would be liable for any health
complications?
"Damned right. If it comes
down to a matter of health prob
lems, the University is responsi
ble," he said.
