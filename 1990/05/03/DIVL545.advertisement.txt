ANNOUNCING - AN AUTOGRAPHING BY
DR. SEYMOUR MARTIN UPSET
AUTHOR OF
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE:
The Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada
A New Routledge Book
"Seymour Martin Lipset has been enlightening us with his analyses of the politics, society, and
culture of our great neighbor to the North for forty years. In this book, he brings together his think
ing on the remarkable contrasts which distinguish two nations which are so close to each other in so
many ways. It will contribute greatly to an understanding of Canada, which we in the United States
think of too rarely, as well as to a deeper understanding of the distinctive characteristics of our own
country." - Nathan Glazer, Harvard University
One of the finest books ever to appear on the subject, Continental Divide explores how differing
social mythologies have given rise to contrasting sets of values, and therefore to differences in lifes
tyles and institutions, in the United States and Canada. It is hard to say which is more fascinating,
the book's ongoing historical argument or the arresting facts and statistics that appear on nearly ever
page." - Northrop Frye, University of Toronto
