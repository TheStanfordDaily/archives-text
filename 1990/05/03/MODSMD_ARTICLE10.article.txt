Guerrillas mount protests
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — Left
ist guerrillas attacked targets in the capital
and dynamited power stations late Tuesday
and yesterday to protest what they called con
tinued human rights violations by the armed
forces.
The military said it suffered five dead and
six wounded and that 12 civilians were
wounded. Rebel casualties were not available.
The attacks began at about 10 p.m., hours
after about 40,000 Salvadorans took part in
a peaceful May Day parade organized by labor
unions and opposition political parties.
Guerrillas and soldiers exchanged fire near
the Sheraton Hotel in the wealthy Escalon
district, where heavy fighting took place last
November in a msyor guerrilla push.
No sign emerged that the fighting signaled
a new offensive in San Salvador, though skir
mishes were reported in Ilobasco, 40 miles to
the northeast.
Earlier, half this city of 800,000 was blacked
out and explosions and automatic weapons
fire hit several neighborhoods.
Private radio station YSKL said rebels
blasted five high-voltage utility towers on San
Salvador volcano, which overlooks the city.
A rebel message protested "the total immu
nity that exists in this country for members
of the armed forces who violate human rights."
Germanies agree on treaty
EAST BERLIN (AP) — The two German
states agreed on a treaty for merging their
economies yesterday after West Germany
agreed to give elderly East Germans more
financial protection from the throes of the
free market.
The tentative agreement, which still has to
be approved by the parliaments of both coun
tries, settles meyor differences between the two
Germanys over how to assess the high costs
of unification.
It clears the way for a full merger of their
economies by July 2, when the West German
mark will become the official currency of East
Germany.
In a compromise, West Germany said
it would allow senior citizens in East Germany
to convert more of their savings at a favorable
1-1 rate to the West German mark.
The plan comes just three days before a
meeting between the two Germanys and the
four World War II allies that divided Germany
— the Soviet Union, United States, Britain,
and France — to discuss the international
ramifications of German unity.
Reed outraged by situation
WIESBADEN, West Germany (AP) —
Former U.S. hostage Frank Reed revealed yes
terday that he was held for months with two
other American captives in Lebanon and said
he was angry and embarrassed that they have
not been freed.
Reed, who was released Monday after 42
months in captivity, said he also was held with
two British hostages. Reed was flown Tuesday
to Wiesbaden for a battery of medical exams
and questioning at the U.S. Air Force hospital.
"I have not seen Tom and Terry for a while,
and I don't know where they are," Reed said,
referring to Terry Anderson, The Associated
Press chief Middle East correspondent, and
Thomas Sutherland, an American educator.
"For God's sake, it's nearly the sixth year
for these men. I'm absolutely embarrassed I'm
out before they are."
Historic negotiations begin
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Presi
dent F.W. de Klerk and African National Con
gress leader Nelson Mandela yesterday urged
the swift abolition of apartheid and began
historic talks aimed at ending white-minority
rule.
The three days of meetings are to remove
obstacles to full-scale negotiations on a new
constitution that would give the 28-million
black majority a voice in national affairs for
the first time.
De Klerk and Mandela, standing on the lawn
of a Dutch colonial mansion where the talks
were held, said South Africans of all races
want swift change. All political parties must
work toward a peaceful solution to racial and
political divisions, they said.
Nearby, the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party walked out of a debate in Parliament
to protest the talks. The Conservative leader,
Andries Treurnicht, said the government
should not negotiate with an organization that
has carried out guerrilla attacks and still was
committed to armed struggle.
"South African law forbids all these actions,"
said Treurnicht, whose party is the main op
position in Parliament's white chamber. The
tri-cameral Parliament also has chambers for
people of mixed-race and Indian descent.
Blacks are excluded.
