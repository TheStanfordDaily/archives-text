# Lithuanians desperate, may rescind laws
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Lithuania's pres
ident said yesterday that his Baltic
republic would consider suspending
temporarily some of the pro
independence laws that drove the
Kremlin to impose an economic em
bargo two weeks ago.
President Vytautas Landsbergis
agreed to the step in a letter to French
and West German leaders who last
week proposed that such a compromise
would help start negotiations between
the republic and Moscow.
"Everything is negotiable which
does not question the matter of re
stored independence of the Lithuanian
state on March 11, 1990," Landsbergis
said in his letter to French President
Francois Mitterrand and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The letter was read to Lithuania's
parliament, the Supreme Council,
which gave its approval without a vote,
said Aidas Palubinskas, a spokesman
for the parliament.
"Putting our confidence in France
and the Federal Republic of Germany,
as well as in other Western democra
cies, and in their support of Lithua
nian democracy, we are asking you to
transmit to the Soviet authorities our
consent to consider a temporary
suspension of the effects of the deci
sions taken by the sovereign parlia
ment of the Lithuanian Republic that
could trouble the Soviet authorities,"
Landsbergis wrote.
The idea behind the proposal from
France and West Germany was that
if Lithuania temporarily suspended
those laws, the Soviet Union, in
return, might ease its pressure on the
republic and also agree to talks on
secession.
Palubinskas stressed that the pro
posal from Kohl and Mitterrand did
not ask for rescinding the declaration
itself, but urged the suspension of laws
passed to implement the independence
declaration.
Lithuania declared independence on
March 11, trying to restore the free
dom it enjoyed before 1940, when the
Soviet Union forcibly annexed it along
with Latvia and Estonia. It has since
passed laws designed to back the in

dependence drive, including ending
conscription of Lithuanians into the
Soviet army, issuing identity cards for
non-Lithuanians and seizing Commu
nist Party property.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
has declared the independence decla
ration invalid and rejected negotia
tions with the republic, saying such
talks are reserved for foreign coun
tries. He demanded that Lithuania res
cind those pro-independence laws.
Gorbachev imposed a partial eco
nomic blockade, cutting supplies of
fuel and other commodities to Lithu
ania. As of yesterday night, no re
sumption of any of the fuel supplies
has been reported.

The republic of 3.8 million people
has been struggling economically ever
since the embargo was imposed.
At least 10,000 people have been
thrown out of work due to factory
closures, Palubinskas said, with that
number expected to increase to 35,000
by the end of the week. Rationing of
gasoline and food has begun, and med
icine is in short supply in some hospi
tals.
Soviet officials have welcomed the
French-German proposal, contained in
a letter to Landsbergis and Gorbachev.
Gorbachev's spokesman, Arkady Mas
lennikov, told a briefing in Moscow on
Saturday that the letter "is not far
from the line that the Soviet leader

ship has been pursuing."
The republic's prime minister,
Kazimiera Prunskiene, is scheduled to
meet tomorrow with President Bush
in Washington. Bush has urged the
Lithuanians and Soviets to negotiate
their dispute but has refused to impose
sanctions on the Kremlin or recognize
the republic's independence.
"We hope that Mrs. Prunskiene will
more completely inform President
Bush about the situation in Lithuania
in the days of blockade," Landsbergis
told parliament yesterday.
Yesterday was the first workday in
Lithuania under the food rationing
system.
