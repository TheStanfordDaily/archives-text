# Hungary discards communism, begins new era

### 
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Par
liament made a firm departure from
its Communist past yesterday, choos
ing as Hungary's interim president a
writer jailed for his role in the 1956
anti-Soviet revolt.
Arpad Goencz, 68, replaced Matyas
Szueroes, a member of the Socialist
Party, formerly the Communist Party,
which ruled for 42 years. He received
339 of the 370 valid votes cast by
secret ballot.
Goencz's nomination was the result
of a pact between the two largest rivals
— the center-right Hungarian Demo
cratic Forum, which will most likely
form the new government, and the
liberal League of Free Democrats.
His first deputy, Gyoergy Szabad,
66, a founding member of the Demo
cratic Forum, became acting speaker
of the new, freely elected Parliament.
Goencz is officially speaker but will
act as head of state until a new pres

ident is elected.
Goencz, a trained lawyer who en
tered politics after World War II as a
member of the then-dominant Smal
lholders' Party, has headed the Hun
garian Writers' Union since last De
cember.
He spent six years in prison on a
life sentence for his role in the 1956
revolt before winning a reprieve in a
1963 general amnesty.
During yesterday's session, historic
figures from the last freely elected Par
liament — before the Communists
took power — were called to the
podium. The session also declared the
1956 uprising a revolution and a battle
for freedom.
The Democratic Forum and the Free
Democrats agreed that the permanent
president should be elected by Parlia
ment rather than in a direct popular
vote. Goencz appeared likely to get
that post, which in Hungary is largely

ceremonial.
Forum leader Jozsef Antall said the
presidential election could happen by
early June if the necessary constitu
tional amendments are passed and the
government is formed.
He said he expects the new govern
ment to be formed by mid-May.
The Forum is the largest party with
164 seats. The Smallholders and Chris
tian Democrats have 44 and 21 respec
tively.
The government of Socialist Miklos
Nemeth formally submitted its resig
nation yesterday, but will continue as
a caretaker government until the new
cabinet is formed.
In a speech, Nemeth noted Hun
gary's gradual transition to democracy,
which, unlike that of other East bloc
countries, was led by the ruling party.
"Many (think) we committed polit
ical suicide and (in return) for dis
mantling the party-state we were

pushed from power," Nemeth said, re
ferring to his Socialist Party's poor
showing at the polls.
The Socialists won only 33 seats in
the new parliament.
Goencz was expected to ask An tall
to form a new government when Par
liament resumes tomorrow.
Yesterday's session was 10 deputies
short of a full house. Eight seats set
aside for minority representatives have
yet to be filled.
Exactly one year ago, Hungary
began dismantling its borders, spark
ing an exodus of East German refugees
to the West. That exodus precipitated
the fall of communism in East Ger
many and later, the rest of the East
bloc.
"We must be proud that our country
was the pioneer in all the changes of
Eastern Europe," Szueroes said in a
farewell address.
