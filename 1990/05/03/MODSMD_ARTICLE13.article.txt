Pilots fired by airline
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A North
west Airlines supervisor testified yes
terday that he smelled alcohol on
three flight crew members just after
they had flown a Northwest pas
senger jet.
"I smelled alcohol on each of them
as I introduced myself, and it seemed
they had been drinking," Bradley
Berntson testified before U.S.
Magistrate J. Earl Cudd.
Blood tests taken about 90 minutes
after the plane landed showed the
three had blood-alcohol levels higher
than allowed by the federal govern
ment. The Federal Aviation Admin
istration then revoked their pilot
licenses, and the airline later fired
them.
Defense attorneys contend the

blood-alcohol tests were obtained un
constitutionally. Cudd is hearing
pretrial motions to suppress the test
results of the three, who face federal
charges of operating an airplane
while under the influence of alcohol.
Drug will not cure
BOSTON (AP) — An experimental
Alzheimer's disease drug fails to pro
vide lasting benefit for victims of the
devastating disorder, even though
some seem initially to respond to the
treatment, according to a study.
The research did not show "a sig
nificant clinical benefit" from the
drug, known as tetrahydromino
acridine, or THA.
Drastic action called for
WASHINGTON (AP) An interna

tional group of legislators called for
immediate action to curb "green
house" pollutants yesterday and rec
ommended a "global Marshall Plan"
to help developing countries cope
with environmental problems.
Concluding a three-day environ
ment conference, the delegates from
42 countries urged nations to commit
without delay to cutting the pollution
that causes global warming by 50
percent over the next 20 years.
Senate makes cuts
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Democratic-controlled Senate Budget
Committee yesterday made the
deepest cut yet in proposed Pentagon
spending, approving a 1991 budget
that pares President Bush's military
plans by $9.9 billion.
The panel adopted the $1.2 trillion

spending plan, which says it will
reduce next year's deficit by $43 bil
lion, on a 14-9 vote. Sen. Charles
Grassley of lowa was the only Re
publican to join the committee Dem
ocrats in voting for the package.
Committee Chairman James Sas
ser, D-Tenn., who pieced together the
proposal, called it "a clear and clarion
call to the White House to get behind
some real deficit reduction."
Bush's budget seeks $36 billion in
deficit reduction.
Sasser said his package could serve
as a benchmark should negotiations
be held this year between the White
House and congressional leaders.
Democrats are split over whether
there is a need for formal budget
talks with Bush, while Republicans
argue such bargaining is a necessity.
