ASSU's restrictions on
files, meetings violate
contract with students

Good government is
accountable government,
but unfortunately, the
ASSU doesn't seem to have gotten
the message.
As documented in a Daily story
earlier this week, Stanford stu
dents are not guaranteed access to
ASSU financial records, and any
non-senator, including reporters,
can be shut out of any ASSU meet
ing by a two-thirds vote of the full
senate or a senate committee.
These policies fly in the face of
democratic principles of govern
ment and must be changed.
Students — all of whom are
members of the ASSU — have a
right to see the financial records
of the campus organizations they
fund. Further, they have a right
to gain access to such records in
a timely manner, without jumping
multiple bureaucratic hurdles.
But in order to examine ASSU
records, students must go through
a two-step process: They must ob
tain permission from both the
ASSU financial manager and the
treasurer of the group whose files
are to be examined. The ASSU has
no policy addressing what amount
of time is reasonable for permis
sion to be granted.
Thus, students may get access
to files they request, but they are
not guaranteed access. The whole
process ultimately depends upon
the whims of student group
treasurers and of the financial
manager.
Investing so much power in one
position is disconcerting in a gov
ernment that calls itself represen

tative.
Just as disturbing is the ASSU
bylaw that allows senators to ex
clude students or reporters from
any meeting by attaining a two
thirds vote.
Even that provision was dis
regarded in a March senate com
mittee meeting. Reporters from
The Daily and The Stanford
Review were kicked out of the
meeting by the committee chair
without a vote of the committee
being called.
Though ASSU officials have
maintained that the reporters were
evicted because of disorderly con
duct in the room, The Daily's
reporter was specifically asked to
leave during a moment of calm in
the meeting. Even if disorderly
conduct did take place, it would
hardly be reasonable to evict a
reporter who is attending to record
the proceedings.
The only cases in which non
senators should be asked to leave
a meeting are when the senate or
a senate committee is discussing
personnel or litigation matters. It
would also be helpful if committee
chairs knew the limits of their
power as defined by the Bylaws
before attempting to evict a stu
dent or reporter from a meeting.
In a democratic society, the press
is expected to act as a watchdog
over the activities of the govern
ment. Denying the press this right
violates a fundamental contract be
tween the governing and the
governed.
Underlying this entire issue is
the ironic fact that public govern
ments on the local, state and
federal levels are much less restric
tive about access to files and meet
ings. One would hope that such
standards could at least be
matched in a university commu
nity that so depends upon open
discussion and mutual trust to ac
complish its goals.
