ASSU gives supervised access to files, opens meetings

I AM WRITING to correct several
inaccuracies in the April 30 Daily
article concerning access to ASSU
files.
The ASSU does permit access to
financial records, namely the funded
accounts of Stanford student groups.
However, the ASSU Constitution also
requires that the ASSU maintain the
security of those records.
Over the years, the financial mana
ger has encountered many security
problems, including the theft of docu
ments, cash and computer software.
Therefore, students may gain access
to funded ASSU files under the super
vision of the financial manager and

with the permission of the treasurer of
the student organization. Thus, access
is subject to reasonable time, place and
manner restrictions, but it can be
obtained.
Two months ago, a Daily staff mem
ber gained unsupervised access to the
financial files of Tuesday Films. Tues
day Films advisor-lecturer Eric Diesel
and 19th ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter informed me that this was a
violation of ASSU financial policy. As I
understand it, this was also a violation
of the ASSU Constitution and Bylaws,
which could leave the ASSU open to a
lawsuit for breach of confidentiality.
Regarding closed meeetings, the

ASSU Senate has held approximately
14 full meetings and nearly 50 com
mittee meetings this year. None of
these meetings was closed to the public
or to senators. There have been only
one or two five-minute periods during
the year when non-senators were asked
to leave the room while the full senate
discussed the personal qualifications of
students nominated to various ASSU
positions.
As for the March 6 meeting, there
were events that were not stated in
the story. Showing disrespect for Stu
dent Affairs Committee Chair Solina
Kwan, several students obstructed
senate business by shouting, running
about the meeting room and speaking

out of turn.
In an effort to permit orderly debate,
I asked non-senators and non-members
of the commitee to please quiet down
or leave the room. Ironically, the only
person who complied with my request
was the Daily reporter.

Editor's note: The Daily staff mem
ber examined the Tuesday Films file
with the permission of ASSU Financial
Manager Sandra Leal and supervision
of Robin Petersen, ASSU Senate secre
tary. However, he did not have permis
sion from the treasurer of Tuesday
Films.
