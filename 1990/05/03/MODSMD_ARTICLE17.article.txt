# Giving tenure to researchers does not solve problem

I have just read the recommendation
of the Committee on the Professoriate
on Academic Appointments in Policy
Centers and Institutes. This is my
reaction to their recommendations:
I hope this proves to be a useful
step. However, I'm not sure. I see two
problems with it.
First, I don't think the rank of non
faculty senior fellows solves the prob
lem of competition. Other mcyor uni
versities have organized themselves to
offer tenured professorships in those
areas of interdisciplinary studies with a
solid academic base such as, for exam
ple, national security studies.
Since this is the path taken by MIT,
Harvard and Carnegie-Mellon, among
others, Stanford is still likely to have
major difficulties recruiting leading
scholars for these new non-professsorial

positions.
Second, I don't think this is the best
way to integrate the work of such in
terdisciplinary centers doing serious
academic work into the teaching pro
grams at Stanford at both the under
graduate and graduate levels.
If one wants the senior fellows to be
integral parts of the teaching program,
then they should be professors. That's
what it means to be a professor.
