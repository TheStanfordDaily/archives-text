# Senate meeting was closed for valid reasons
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the April
30 article in The Daily entitled "Keep
out: ASSU files, meetings kept under
wraps." Despite the journalistic integ
rity that I have previously associated
with The Daily, I am highly disap-

pointed by the one-sided slant of the
article, but more so, appalled by the
distortion of facts.
What surprises me most are the
inaccuracies that remained after both a
30-minute interview and a phone con
versation (the night before the article
went to print) in which I reiterated the
facts concerning the allegedly closed
15-minute March 6 Student Affairs
Committee meeting.
First, it should be noted that this
was the only attempt, in 16 committee
meetings, to close the session.
Second, the attempt failed inasmuch
as many non-senators remained in the
room despite my request.
Further, I tried to close the meeting
only because the disorderly conduct of
persons in the room infringed upon
our ability to conduct our committee
meeting.
I find it curious that my
explanations were included only as
ellipses in the closing quote of the
piece. Thus, this attempt at document
ing the isolated events of the March 6
meeting is clearly not "one example" of
"the fact that reporters and students

have been excluded from decision
making sessions among elected offi
cials," but perhaps a signal to The
Daily that they must constantly review
their journalistic standards.
