# Closing Tours part of Overseas proposal
## 
### Andrew Tilton 
Stanford's center in Tours will close in
the fall of 1991 if the recommendations of
the Overseas Studies Program Committee
are implemented.
The committee met yesterday to form
ulate recommendations to the School of
Humanities and Sciences for meeting the
expected $170,000 budget cut for Overseas
Studies.
The meeting resulted in three main sug
gestions: "major administrative cuts both
at the home office and overseas, eliminat
ing all major field trips at all of the centers
and closing the Stanford-in-Tours Center
in June 1991," according to a memorandum
from the committee.
Thomas Heller, director of Overseas
Studies, said, "No administrator can be
happy with the budget cuts," but eliminat
ing Tours will help meet budget require
ments and free up money to bolster existing
programs.
Ewart Thomas, dean of Humanities and
Sciences, will finalize a recommendation
within the next two weeks to present to
the Board of Trustees in June.
The overseas programs' field trip budgets
involve "major trips" from the respective
centers. Examples of such trips are outings
to Rome or Venice from the center in
Florence, and to Prague or the Soviet Union
from Berlin. These opportunities will no
longer be available under yesterday's rec-

ommendation.
The program committee
received a large number of
letters and a petition with
more than 800 signatures
protesting the anticipated
closure of the Tours
campus. Although the pro
gram will most likely close,
the negative response con
tributed to the creation of

a proposal for a second program in Paris.
A second Paris program would provide
30 spaces in fall and winter quarters, still
40 fewer spots per year than with Tours
open.
Closing Tours and opening a new Paris
center would cut $110,000 of the program's
$170,000 target, according to a memoran
dum to the committee from Heller.
While the expanded program in Paris
would open in time to partially offset the
loss of Tours, several students and com
mittee members interviewed questioned
the short-term viability of the new pro
gram.
"It would take an administrative Man
hattan Project to put even a limited version
of the proposed center in place in just one
year," said senior James Mokhiber, a mem
ber of the committee.
Concerned students still have an oppor
tunity to influence the decision-making
process, according to Sophia Shing, another
committee member.
