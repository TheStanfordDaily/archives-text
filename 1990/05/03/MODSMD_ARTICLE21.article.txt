## Writing worth reading?

AH ... SPRING.
Birds, bees and butterflies sweep
down from the gorgeous blue sky,
past beautiful trees to hover near your
window, mocking you as you sit trapped
in your dungeon-of-a-dorm with a chunk
of silicon glaring at you.
So it's your sixth extension on this
paper. So it's 90 percent of your grade,
and you can't think of a paper topic. So
it's three hours until the deadline, and
all you have is a blank MicroSoft Word
screen.
Remember ... it could be worse: you
could have a 600-word column due in 30
minutes.
Out of the goodness of my heart I've
compiled a series of Last Minute Paper
Do's and Don'ts (no benefit to myself,
whatsoever, of course).
DON'T:
• Achieve complete and utter panic, pull
out your hair, use up your Dead Week
primal scream and jump out the window,
• Close your eyes, lie on your bed and
pray for an earthquake,
• Achieve absolute mellowness, i.e. listen
to Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry — Be
Happy" while you run off to lie in the
grass,
• Suddenly become philosophical, i.e.
stare blankly at the computer screen,
hum to the frequency of the computer's
drone, and ask "Why am I on this earth?",
• Take a nap and wait for "The Pulitzer
Prize-Winning Idea" to magically appear
in your dreams,
• Say heck with it and play Tetris,
• Ask for another extension.

DO:
• Start with an obscure and lengthy in
troduction, perhaps a random analogy
that shows your comparative skills and
broad vision:
"One might think that the art of waffle
making is completely estranged from that
of paper writing. Not so. Consider the
diligent preparation of the batter: Just
as one shops for eggs, flour and sugar
to create this wondrous mix, so too must
the serious paper writer shop for his
sources and information to supply the
ingredients that will coalesce to form a
well-written paper . ..
After preparing the batter of research,
one needs to turn on the waffle iron
(a.k.a Mac) and pour in the words. Just
as each tiny square of batter will solidify
to form the whole waffle, so too will each
tiny phrase or word entered through the
keyboard, thus taking up more space in
your paper.",
• Be shamelessly long-winded and exceed
ingly superfluous, using lengthy but in
sightful apositives packed with
conjunctions and prepositions, such as
the one previously mentioned and this
one too, taking advantage of every darn
punctuation sign in the English language
in order to convey a message that just
barely misses a run-on sentence by a
micron: a complex-looking sentence must
contain a complex and profound thought;
a simple sentence must be shallow.
• Know when to stop playing
with the margins because
even though you can get
maybe a whole half page

It's three hours until the
deadline, and all you have
is a blank Microsoft Word
screen.

out of Mac Stretch or fiddling
with the MicroSoft Word ruler,
it's not good to overdo it
because it kind of looks
silly,
• Qualify every cogent point you make
so as not to be too controversial or er
roneously wrong. This is not to say that
you should be wishy-washy to the point
of saying nothing. And that is not to say
that your statements should be blunt and
unadorned with clarification,
• Utilize every SAT word from your
panoply of polysyllablism with an effica
cious effrontery that exudes a Brob
dingnagian braggadocio concommitant
with the indisputable notion that you,
too, comprehend the inestimable worth
of a word such as triskaidekaphobia,
• Ram home your points with an insight
ful and original conclusion.
