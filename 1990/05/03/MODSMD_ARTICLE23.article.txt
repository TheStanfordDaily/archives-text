## Athletic Department should not give in to all alumni whims 
### 
The Athletic Department is a star
tling anomaly at Stanford. One day it's
cutting funds to successful programs
like women'B field hockey, and the next
day it's spending money on cheer
leaders.
I can't think of anything more
worthwhile than rushing the cheer
leader squad template of the universe
up here from USC to copy off some
"sweaterized" yell-leaders for our own
use. That's quick thinking on Asst.
Athletic Director of Marketing Jim
Brungard's part.
The only quicker thinking is coming
from cynics like me who think it

would be easier to just hire the USC
cheerleaders outright.
I am interested by Brungard's admis
sion that it is alumni who are com
plaining about not having cheerleaders.
Or can I assume that what com
plaining alumni really want to see is
students being led in cheers and not
doing whatever things they have come
to the game to do?
I'll assume the latter, and since it's
for students that Brungard must make
his efforts count foremost, I am disap
pointed that he is doing them to
pander to alumni whims.
The University is facing lay-offs,
program closures and exhaustive earth
quake repairs. Hats off to Brungard
for spending money to bring Stanford
what it really needs right now: a little
piece of USC.
