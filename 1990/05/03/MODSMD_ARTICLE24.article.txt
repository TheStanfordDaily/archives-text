Richard Kahn's April 24 letter is a
prime example of the psychological
racism that currently plagues America.
Although overt racism is dead, covert
racism is still alive and well in Ameri

His letter emphasizes that the men
who shouted at him were black and
that they were headed to a black frat
party. The emphasis on black is in

Proving this is the fact that if one
omits the word "black" from the letter

Certainly not remarkable enough to

write a letter to The Daily.

America who are victims of psychologi

we still need to go before we realize
the full meaning of America's creed.
