## Richards leads, guides younger Cardinal teammates 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Put yourself in Barry Richards'
sneakers.
Going into senior year, you have
started in the singles lineup for three
straight years. You have helped win two
national championships. You have been
elected team captain for the second year
in a row. Your tennis has steadily im
proved.
But, all of the sudden, the coach tells
you that you won't be playing singles
this year — or doubles, for that matter.
Incoming freshmen like Jonathan
Stark, Jared Palmer and Alexis
Hombrecher will be starting instead.
Vastly improved sophomores like Jason
Yee have jumped ahead of you on the
ladder.
So, what do you do?
You complain. You mope. You don't
practice as hard. Wait! You skip practice
altogether. You try to get your former
teammates to rally behind you. You
don't go to the matches.
You do all of it, unless you're Barry
Richards.
Listening to the Stanford tennis
coaches talk about Richards is to risk
drowning in a sea of compliments.
"A lesser person would have had trou
ble dealing with it," Coach Dick Gould
said. "Not Barry. Like everyone, he has
his ups and downs. But it's the way he
deals with them that is so impressive.
He never offers excuses, ever. He's the
kind of guy you hope your kids will
turn out to be."
"Barry's the type of guy you wish
you could have a whole team of," Asst.
Coach John Whitlinger said. "We are
definitely going to miss him."
Despite the limited playing time he
has seen this season, Richards said he
still feels a duty as team captain. "I
still feel responsible to come out and
watch the matches and to practice as
hard as I can," Richards explained.
"Even though I am not playing as much
as I did in the past three years, I still
feel like I have to go out there and try

my hardest.
"Besides it's fun being out there with
the new guys. It's fun to be around
them and to get to know them."
Richards said that one of the things
he has tried to foster as team captain
is unity. "I've tried to get the team to
do things together," he said. "A lot of
how you do at the NCAAs depends on
how well you come together as a team.
This team is too good to not be together
and to ruin its chances that way."
But not all of Richards' efforts for
the Cardinal have been from the
sidelines. During his first three years,
Richards compiled some of the best
singles records on the squad, playing
in the No. 5 and No. 6 spots.
Last year, Richards tallied a record
of 22-8, the best on the team, and came
up with several crucial wins. After
losing at No. 6 singles in the quarter
final and semifinal matches in the
NCAA tournament — the first time all
year that he had lost back-to-back
matches — Richards scored a crucial
victory in the NCAA finals against
Georgia, crunching Jack Frierson in

straight sets.
"Barry is so tough to beat on the
court," Gould said. "He's not going to
give you anything. He's a great pressure
player."
Richards agreed, saying that determi
nation is a big reason for his success.
"When I first came here, I had a good
forehand, and I knew how to play smart
points. But, at this level, a lot of people
can do that well. I've had to scrap to
win matches. I never feel like I'm out
of a match."
Today's dual match represents Stan
ford's and Richards' last home contest.
Although he is not sure whether he will
play singles or doubles or anything at
all, Richards said he couldn't help but
feel a little sentimental.
"There's probably nothing I could say
that will make 500 people come out and
watch, but it would be nice to get as
many people out there as possible. It's
the last home match, and it's always
great to see people out there."
In the meantime, Richards is trying
to enjoy his last days as a Stanford
tennis player.
