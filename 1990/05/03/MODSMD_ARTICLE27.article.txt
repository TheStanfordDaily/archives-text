## 
### 
TODAY — 1:30 at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
RECORD — Stanford (19-3, 8-3 in Pac-10 South, ranked No. 3 in the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate Rankings).
INJURIES — Stanford freshman Jonathan Stark has a stress facture in his left foot
and will not play. Freshman Jared Palmer is almost fully recovered from knee surgery
and will play both singles and doubles. Palmer reached the semifinals of both the
singles and doubles competitions at the Pacific 10 Conference Individual Championships
in Ojai, Calif, last weekend.
CARDINAL NOTES — This is Stanford's final home match. . .Without Stark and Palmer
in the lineup for the past few matches and with the two losses in Los Angeles April
20-21, Stanford fell out of its No. 1 position in the national rankings for the first time
this year. The Cardinal now sits at No. 3, behind No. 1-ranked and undefeated
Tennessee and No. 2-ranked UCLA.. Despite being injured, Stark still maintained his
No. 2 ranking in collegiate singles. Alex O'Brien fell to No. 14, while Palmer moved
down to No. 49.
HUSKY NOTES - According to Coach Dick Gould, Washington will bring to Stanford
Tennis Stadium a vastly improved squad. The main reason for the Huskies' dramatic
improvement stems from the arrival of former Texas player, Aaron Gross, and freshman
Chet Crile Gross and Crile both competed in last week's Pac-10 Individuals. Crile
has been especially impressive playing in the No. 2 spot, recording wins over No. 2
players from powerhouses such as UCLA. Gross and Crile could give Stanford's top
players trouble, especially if the Cardinal competitors are concentrating too much on
the rematch with California May 4.
