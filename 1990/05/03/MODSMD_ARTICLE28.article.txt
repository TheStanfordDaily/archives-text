# Stanford, ASU may be headed for Omaha encounter
## 
### 
Two of the three best teams in col
lege baseball took each other on
last weekend, and the series
decided absolutely nothing.
All right, that's not entirely true. The
Stanford and Arizona State baseball
teams split the four games they played,
so no one lost or gained anything in the
Six-Pac standings, but the series did
prove a few things about each team —
and also gave some insight into the up
coming NCAA playoffs.
The second-ranked Cardinal showed
it's not only a talented team, it's also got
luck on its side (which, as anyone knows,
can be almost as important in baseball).
If David McCarty and Paul Carey had
come to the plate 10 minutes later than
they did in Friday's completion game,
their two routine-pop-flies-turned-base
hits (which led to the winning runs)
would have been easy outs, meaning the
Cardinal would be holding on to a half
game lead in the division right now.
Why would 10 minutes make a differ
ence? Simple: the two popups were
misplayed because of the freakish twilight
(either that or the outfielders were play
ing "Let's see who can look really stu
pid"), and 10 minutes later the lights at

Packard Stadium would have been turned
up a little more to make sure everyone
could see what they were doing.
Timing is everything.
Besides proving they're lucky, though,
the Cardinal also showed its resilience,
which is something it hasn't had to do
much this season.
Unfortunately, ASU got to show theirs
first: After getting over their pop-shock,
the Sun Devils came out in the next
game and clawed, mauled, skewered and
slammed the Cardinal into the ground,
which is what usually happens to visitors
at Packard (last year, the Devils only
scored 34 runs in the three games against
the Cardinal in Tempe).
Stanford came right back the next
night, winning 10-7 in what Paul Carey
called "the biggest game of the year."
This is a team that hasn't had much of
a chance to show how much heart it has
this season — usually because it's win
ning games by about 15 runs or so —
and it was finally able to show how it
could bounce back from a huge loss.
Of course, ASU proved a few things
during the series as well:
How many teams can blow a

crucial game (because of the light, for
Pete's sake) and then come back 30
minutes later and knock the you-know
what out of the same team?
How many teams have a No. 3 pitcher
who can completely shut down one of
the best teams in the country, giving up
only four hits?
How many teams are able to win 23
games in a row? Granted, most of those
wins came at the expense of teams who
think the word "rank" has more to do
with the smell of their socks than with
their record, but 23 straight is nothing
to wrinkle your nose at. Just ask the
Cardinal, which had won 14 in a row
before heading for ASU.
And finally, how many teams have the
kind of home-field advantage the Sun
Devils are going to enjoy during the re
gional playoffs?
Yes, that's right, the Sun Devils will
most likely be hosting a regional (for only
the 3000 th time) when the playoffs get
under way in three weeks. Barring a
complete and total catastrophe (like, say,
the moon falling into the Bay), Stanford
will be hosting a regional as well.
Then again, with the NCAA in charge,
you never can tell.

f"P he Cardinal will be hosting one of
the eight six-team pools on the
-L strength of taking the Six-Pac title
(which it will do if it wins three of its
final six games). The Sun Devils will be
hosting theirs on the strength of guaran
teeing the NCAA a lot of money from
the gate receipts.
Hey, money talks. Packard Stadium
holds upwards of 8000 people (some of
them not obnoxious or annoying), and
the NCAA likes money almost as much
as Carey likes fastballs that are actually
near the plate. A regional at ASU gives
the NCAA a truckload of cash, it gives
the peaceful, fun-loving folks of Tempe
a chance to watch some great baseball,
. . . and it virtually guarantees the Sun

Devils a berth in the College World Series.
You see, the Sun Devils don't lose at
home. Ever. Well, okay, they lost there
three times early in the season. Since
then, six of their eight position players
have shifted spots, they've had that
stretch of 23 straight wins, and they've
won 20 of their last 21 at home. The
one loss? Last Saturday to the Cardinal.
Anyone wanna give odds on their losing
again?
Of course, the Cardinal doesn't look to
be in too much trouble at home either:
ASU is 31-4 at Packard, and Stanford is
21-2 at Sunken Diamond. The Devils have
only lost two conference games at home.
The Cardinal has lost none.
If the Devils are a pretty good bet to
make it back to Omaha, the Cardinal is
a better one. And, once there, don't be
surprised if the two teams meet up again.
Of course, there's no guarantee either
team will even get to the Series, because
there may be another twilight game in
store for one of them.
But don't bet on it.

hosting theirs on the strength of guaran
teeing the NCAA a lot of money from
the gate receipts.
Hey, money talks. Packard Stadium
holds upwards of 8000 people (some of
them not obnoxious or annoying), and
the NCAA likes money almost as much
as Carey likes fastballs that are actually
near the plate. A regional at ASU gives
the NCAA a truckload of cash, it gives
the peaceful, fun-loving folks of Tempe
a chance to watch some great baseball,
. . . and it virtually guarantees the Sun

Devils a berth in the College World Series.
You see, the Sun Devils don't lose at
home. Ever. Well, okay, they lost there
three times early in the season. Since
then, six of their eight position players
have shifted spots, they've had that
stretch of 23 straight wins, and they've
won 20 of their last 21 at home. The
one loss? Last Saturday to the Cardinal.
Anyone wanna give odds on their losing
again?
Of course, the Cardinal doesn't look to
be in too much trouble at home either:
ASU is 31-4 at Packard, and Stanford is
21-2 at Sunken Diamond. The Devils have
only lost two conference games at home.
The Cardinal has lost none.
If the Devils are a pretty good bet to
make it back to Omaha, the Cardinal is
a better one. And, once there, don't be
surprised if the two teams meet up again.
Of course, there's no guarantee either
team will even get to the Series, because
there may be another twilight game in
store for one of them.
But don't bet on it.

Two of the three best teams in col
lege baseball took each other on
last weekend, and the series
decided absolutely nothing.
All right, that's not entirely true. The
Stanford and Arizona State baseball
teams split the four games they played,
so no one lost or gained anything in the
Six-Pac standings, but the series did
prove a few things about each team —
and also gave some insight into the up
coming NCAA playoffs.
The second-ranked Cardinal showed
it's not only a talented team, it's also got
luck on its side (which, as anyone knows,
can be almost as important in baseball).
If David McCarty and Paul Carey had
come to the plate 10 minutes later than
they did in Friday's completion game,
their two routine-pop-flies-turned-base
hits (which led to the winning runs)
would have been easy outs, meaning the
Cardinal would be holding on to a half
game lead in the division right now.
Why would 10 minutes make a differ
ence? Simple: the two popups were
misplayed because of the freakish twilight
(either that or the outfielders were play
ing "Let's see who can look really stu
pid"), and 10 minutes later the lights at

Packard Stadium would have been turned
up a little more to make sure everyone
could see what they were doing.
Timing is everything.
Besides proving they're lucky, though,
the Cardinal also showed its resilience,
which is something it hasn't had to do
much this season.
Unfortunately, ASU got to show theirs
first: After getting over their pop-shock,
the Sun Devils came out in the next
game and clawed, mauled, skewered and
slammed the Cardinal into the ground,
which is what usually happens to visitors
at Packard (last year, the Devils only
scored 34 runs in the three games against
the Cardinal in Tempe).
Stanford came right back the next
night, winning 10-7 in what Paul Carey
called "the biggest game of the year."
This is a team that hasn't had much of
a chance to show how much heart it has
this season — usually because it's win
ning games by about 15 runs or so —
and it was finally able to show how it
could bounce back from a huge loss.
Of course, ASU proved a few things
during the series as well:
How many teams can blow a

crucial game (because of the light, for
Pete's sake) and then come back 30
minutes later and knock the you-know
what out of the same team?
How many teams have a No. 3 pitcher
who can completely shut down one of
the best teams in the country, giving up
only four hits?
How many teams are able to win 23
games in a row? Granted, most of those
wins came at the expense of teams who
think the word "rank" has more to do
with the smell of their socks than with
their record, but 23 straight is nothing
to wrinkle your nose at. Just ask the
Cardinal, which had won 14 in a row
before heading for ASU.
And finally, how many teams have the
kind of home-field advantage the Sun
Devils are going to enjoy during the re
gional playoffs?
Yes, that's right, the Sun Devils will
most likely be hosting a regional (for only
the 3000 th time) when the playoffs get
under way in three weeks. Barring a
complete and total catastrophe (like, say,
the moon falling into the Bay), Stanford
will be hosting a regional as well.
Then again, with the NCAA in charge,
you never can tell.

f"P he Cardinal will be hosting one of
the eight six-team pools on the
-L strength of taking the Six-Pac title
(which it will do if it wins three of its
final six games). The Sun Devils will be
hosting theirs on the strength of guaran
teeing the NCAA a lot of money from
the gate receipts.
