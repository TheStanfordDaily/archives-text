# Relief ace Weiss closes for Cardinal
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
ESPN announcer Chris Ber
man might call him Scott "Cup
a-Soup-With" Weiss. Or Scotty
"Edel" Weiss, after a lullaby of a
performance on the mound, might
suffice.
But, please, whatever you do,
don't rhyme Weiss with "Nice,"
when the Cardinal right-hander
is bearing down on you in the
ninth inning.
"I have to be a little cocky —
arrogant — when I come into the
game," said Weiss, the bullpen
closer for the Stanford nine. "I
know I'm going to come in and
stuff it to these guys. If it's a
one-run game, I have to come in
and slam the door."
For the record, Weiss doesn't
admit to a nickname, but
modestly prefers the moniker "the
bullpen guy."
But all name-slinging aside,
Weiss is the "go-to" guy for Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess in the
late innings, and he will play a
critical role if Stanford is to win
its third College World Series in
the last four years.
"We're counting on him — he's
the guy — and he knows it," said
pitching coach Tom Dunton. "He
feels good about himself, and we
feel good about him. If we have
a one-run lead in the eighth or
ninth inning he'll be the guy we
turn to."
Stanford, 43-9 overall and
ranked second nationally, has al
ready assured itself of a playoff
berth, and will most likely host a
regional by winning the Pacific

10 Conference's Southern Divi
sion. The Cardinal, 19-5 and in
first place, need to win only two
of the final six league games to
clinch the title. They start a three
game set with last-place Califor
nia tomorrow,
"Especially in the playoffs,
when we play almost every day,
my role will become even more
important," said Weiss.
"Regionals are like a new season.
The team that is on a roll will
win it. The last month I've been
pitching better and better, and the
team has continued to improve.
I'm confident that when the call
comes that the door will be shut."
Weiss, a 5-foot-11, 160-pound
junior from Palmdale, Calif.,
throws a fastball and slider, but
his bread-and-butter "out" pitch
is the curve.
"To be a reliever you need two
real nasty pitches or one really
nasty pitch," Dunton said. "Scott
has a devastating curve. But
sometimes everybody knows that.
He's getting a little more mileage
out of his fastball now — he has
better location and a little more
pop on it."
Weiss is also developing a slider.
Tuesday at St. Mary's in a 10-3
Stanford win, a prototype model
of the new slider was slammed
out of the park, which will delay
the pitch's deployment in closer
ball games.
"Hopefully that home run was
just a fluke," said Weiss.
"Sometimes in games that aren't
close I just throw strikes and
don't bear down like I should. I

Junior reliever Scott Weiss has had the tough task of replacing
Steve Chltren, the Stanford all-time save leader, in the bullpen this
season. So far, Weiss has responded with five saves to lead the
Cardinal.
