# Relief ace Weiss closes for Cardinal
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
ESPN announcer Chris Ber
man might call him Scott "Cup
a-Soup-With" Weiss. Or Scotty
"Edel" Weiss, after a lullaby of a
performance on the mound, might
suffice.
But, please, whatever you do,
don't rhyme Weiss with "Nice,"
when the Cardinal right-hander
is bearing down on you in the
ninth inning.
"I have to be a little cocky —
arrogant — when I come into the
game," said Weiss, the bullpen
closer for the Stanford nine. "I
know I'm going to come in and
stuff it to these guys. If it's a
one-run game, I have to come in
and slam the door."
For the record, Weiss doesn't
admit to a nickname, but
modestly prefers the moniker "the
bullpen guy."
But all name-slinging aside,
Weiss is the "go-to" guy for Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess in the
late innings, and he will play a
critical role if Stanford is to win
its third College World Series in
the last four years.
"We're counting on him — he's
the guy — and he knows it," said
pitching coach Tom Dunton. "He
feels good about himself, and we
feel good about him. If we have
a one-run lead in the eighth or
ninth inning he'll be the guy we
turn to."
Stanford, 43-9 overall and
ranked second nationally, has al
ready assured itself of a playoff
berth, and will most likely host a
regional by winning the Pacific

10 Conference's Southern Divi
sion. The Cardinal, 19-5 and in
first place, need to win only two
of the final six league games to
clinch the title. They start a three
game set with last-place Califor
nia tomorrow,
"Especially in the playoffs,
when we play almost every day,
my role will become even more
important," said Weiss.
"Regionals are like a new season.
The team that is on a roll will
win it. The last month I've been
pitching better and better, and the
team has continued to improve.
I'm confident that when the call
comes that the door will be shut."
Weiss, a 5-foot-11, 160-pound
junior from Palmdale, Calif.,
throws a fastball and slider, but
his bread-and-butter "out" pitch
is the curve.
"To be a reliever you need two
real nasty pitches or one really
nasty pitch," Dunton said. "Scott
has a devastating curve. But
sometimes everybody knows that.
He's getting a little more mileage
out of his fastball now — he has
better location and a little more
pop on it."
Weiss is also developing a slider.
Tuesday at St. Mary's in a 10-3
Stanford win, a prototype model
of the new slider was slammed
out of the park, which will delay
the pitch's deployment in closer
ball games.
"Hopefully that home run was
just a fluke," said Weiss.
"Sometimes in games that aren't
close I just throw strikes and
don't bear down like I should. I

Cardinal.
need to work on that."
Added Dunton, "We might not
have had him throwing that pitch
in another situation."
Although the St. Mary's outing
jolted his season ERA to 3.76, he
leads the team with five saves
and has a 4-1 record. In the Six-
Pac, Weiss has a 2-0 record with
one save and a 2.79 ERA in seven
appearances.
With starters Stan Spencer and
Mike Mussina throwing a com
bined 16 complete games, work
in the bullpen has been sporadic.
So Weiss and his bullpen mates
have tried to help out the offen
sive production with "rally pen"
voodoo — a special magic that
helps the Cardinal bats make con
tact.
"When we come from behind to
win a game, we like to take credit
down in the pen," said Weiss. "We
figure the rally pen can produce
a few runs."
Weiss, who inherited the closer
role after all-time Stanford save
leader Steve Chitren graduated,
has welcomed a full-time bullpen
enlistment and says he hopes to
stay. "Every team needs a number
one guy out of the bullpen, and
I'm happy to have that role. I
wouldn't prefer to start, and I
don't think things will be chang
ing for me," he added.
In 1989, as the Cardinal pitch
ing staff gradually unraveled,
Weiss shifted in and out of the
starting rotation. As a starter he
was a shaky 0-4 with a 10.97 ERA,
but as a reliever he went 3-2 with
three saves and a 3.65 ERA.
"They want me in the bullpen,
and I like being there. At Arizona
State we had a tight game with
7,000 fans watching. I really liked
being in there," he continued.
"Plus, I think my repertoire is
better built for relief."
But despite Weiss's stability in
the pen, his future role is not
certain. With Spencer and Mus
sina rumored to be leaving for
the pros, "We'll just wait and see
about next year," Weiss said.
Nicknames or not, Weiss will
be on the mound at the end. He
hopes the end will be the final
game of the College World Series,
and if he gets there he's not going
to be very nice about it.

of the new slider was slammed
out of the park, which will delay
the pitch's deployment in closer
ball games.
"Hopefully that home run was
just a fluke," said Weiss.
"Sometimes in games that aren't
close I just throw strikes and
don't bear down like I should. I

need to work on that."
Added Dunton, "We might not
have had him throwing that pitch
in another situation."
Although the St. Mary's outing
jolted his season ERA to 3.76, he
leads the team with five saves
and has a 4-1 record. In the Six-
Pac, Weiss has a 2-0 record with
one save and a 2.79 ERA in seven
appearances.
With starters Stan Spencer and
Mike Mussina throwing a com
bined 16 complete games, work
in the bullpen has been sporadic.
So Weiss and his bullpen mates
have tried to help out the offen
sive production with "rally pen"
voodoo — a special magic that
helps the Cardinal bats make con
tact.
"When we come from behind to
win a game, we like to take credit
down in the pen," said Weiss. "We
figure the rally pen can produce
a few runs."
Weiss, who inherited the closer
role after all-time Stanford save
leader Steve Chitren graduated,
has welcomed a full-time bullpen
enlistment and says he hopes to
stay. "Every team needs a number
one guy out of the bullpen, and
I'm happy to have that role. I
wouldn't prefer to start, and I
don't think things will be chang
ing for me," he added.
In 1989, as the Cardinal pitch
ing staff gradually unraveled,
Weiss shifted in and out of the
starting rotation. As a starter he
was a shaky 0-4 with a 10.97 ERA,
but as a reliever he went 3-2 with
three saves and a 3.65 ERA.
"They want me in the bullpen,
and I like being there. At Arizona
State we had a tight game with
7,000 fans watching. I really liked
being in there," he continued.
"Plus, I think my repertoire is
better built for relief."
But despite Weiss's stability in
the pen, his future role is not
certain. With Spencer and Mus
sina rumored to be leaving for
the pros, "We'll just wait and see
about next year," Weiss said.
Nicknames or not, Weiss will
be on the mound at the end. He
hopes the end will be the final
game of the College World Series,
and if he gets there he's not going
to be very nice about it.
ESPN announcer Chris Ber
man might call him Scott "Cup
a-Soup-With" Weiss. Or Scotty
"Edel" Weiss, after a lullaby of a
performance on the mound, might
suffice.
But, please, whatever you do,
don't rhyme Weiss with "Nice,"
when the Cardinal right-hander
is bearing down on you in the
ninth inning.
"I have to be a little cocky —
arrogant — when I come into the
game," said Weiss, the bullpen
closer for the Stanford nine. "I
know I'm going to come in and
stuff it to these guys. If it's a
one-run game, I have to come in
and slam the door."
For the record, Weiss doesn't
admit to a nickname, but
modestly prefers the moniker "the
bullpen guy."
But all name-slinging aside,
Weiss is the "go-to" guy for Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess in the
late innings, and he will play a
critical role if Stanford is to win
its third College World Series in
the last four years.
"We're counting on him — he's
the guy — and he knows it," said
pitching coach Tom Dunton. "He
feels good about himself, and we
feel good about him. If we have
a one-run lead in the eighth or
ninth inning he'll be the guy we
turn to."
Stanford, 43-9 overall and
ranked second nationally, has al
ready assured itself of a playoff
berth, and will most likely host a
regional by winning the Pacific

10 Conference's Southern Divi
sion. The Cardinal, 19-5 and in
first place, need to win only two
of the final six league games to
clinch the title. They start a three
game set with last-place Califor
nia tomorrow,
"Especially in the playoffs,
when we play almost every day,
my role will become even more
important," said Weiss.
"Regionals are like a new season.
The team that is on a roll will
win it. The last month I've been
pitching better and better, and the
team has continued to improve.
I'm confident that when the call
comes that the door will be shut."
Weiss, a 5-foot-11, 160-pound
junior from Palmdale, Calif.,
throws a fastball and slider, but
his bread-and-butter "out" pitch
is the curve.
"To be a reliever you need two
real nasty pitches or one really
nasty pitch," Dunton said. "Scott
has a devastating curve. But
sometimes everybody knows that.
He's getting a little more mileage
out of his fastball now — he has
better location and a little more
pop on it."
Weiss is also developing a slider.
