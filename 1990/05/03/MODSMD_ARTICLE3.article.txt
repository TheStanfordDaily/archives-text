# Facing huge cut, Human Resources hopes to decentralize
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
In addition to a 30 percent budget cut,
the highest of any University department,
the Office of Human Resources Services
faces organizational restructuring
over the next 18 months.
Through this process, administrators
hope to decentralize some of the functions
of Human Resources and place increased

responsibility for personnel decisions on
department managers.
However, some workers in the depart
ment are concerned about the future of
their jobs and fear that decisions are
being made without consulting them.
Human Resources is currently respon
sible for handling all of the University's
personnel relations, including employee
benefits, placement and support work for
the hiring and firing of University staff.

The rmgor issue behind the plan for
restructuring is the need for decentraliza
tion in Human Resources, according to
Marshall Smith, dean of the School of
Education and chair of the committee
planning the reorganization.
The University needs to place more
accountability for personnel issues on ad
ministration and management, including
vice presidents, department deans and
faculty, Smith said.

Ironically, the reorganization of
Human Resources staff is taking place
despite the increased role that personnel
relations will play during the layoff proc
ess.
The entire budget cutting and layoff
process places an "extra burden on many
Human Resources people," in particular,
on those workers involved in benefits and
placement, according to Smith.
"At the same time that there is a

probable cut in their staff resources"
their services are needed more, he added.
Smith said he hopes that by
decentralizing Human Resources, other
people can help "pick up the slack."
Although the exact number of staff
cuts has not yet been determined, Smith
said he hopes that some of the staff cuts
can be absorbed through attrition.
While certain functions will still
have to be done centrally, the re
organization will probably put
more people in the field, allowing
personnel functions to be handled
more efficiently, according to
Mary Moore, the former director
of Human Resources who is a
member of the committee.
In addition, sending specialists
out into the field will place more
of the burden on managers, Smith
said. Managers will have to be
trained to do these personnel
functions, he added.
Currently, most of the Human
Resources staff in the field are
"generalists" who can do a variety
of different tasks but have to call
in specialists from the central of
fice for more complicated prob
lems, Moore said. Under the new
proposal, specialists will be out in

the field to assist the generalists,
saving time and money.
Smith also said he sees the re
organization having positive long
term effects. "We want everyone
to deal with issues like affirmative
action," he said.
Smith said he feels that the
concerns of people within the de
partment are being considered,
but several workers said they feel
the administrators are not
making the right decisions.
"These guys brought the prob
lem," said one Human Resources
staff member who asked to
remain anonymous. "How can
they find the solution?" he asked.
"There is a deep distrust" of
management among workers, the
worker said. The cuts "may sig
nify the beginning of much deeper
problems" because the rank and
file workers are very distressed,
he added.
In addition to a general fear of
being laid off, workers questioned
the committee's method for reor

ganizing the department. The ad
ministrators are "trying to
reorganize the department into ef
ficiency instead of managing it
into efficiency, the worker said.
Another Human Resources
worker said she believes the ad
ministration has known for some
time that the budget problems ex
isted and has waited until now to
do something about them.
