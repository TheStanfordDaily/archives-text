# Facing huge cut, Human Resources hopes to decentralize
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
In addition to a 30 percent budget cut,
the highest of any University department,
the Office of Human Resources Services
faces organizational restructuring
over the next 18 months.
Through this process, administrators
hope to decentralize some of the functions
of Human Resources and place increased

responsibility for personnel decisions on
department managers.
However, some workers in the depart
ment are concerned about the future of
their jobs and fear that decisions are
being made without consulting them.
Human Resources is currently respon
sible for handling all of the University's
personnel relations, including employee
benefits, placement and support work for
the hiring and firing of University staff.

The rmgor issue behind the plan for
restructuring is the need for decentraliza
tion in Human Resources, according to
Marshall Smith, dean of the School of
Education and chair of the committee
planning the reorganization.
The University needs to place more
accountability for personnel issues on ad
ministration and management, including
vice presidents, department deans and
faculty, Smith said.

Ironically, the reorganization of
Human Resources staff is taking place
despite the increased role that personnel
relations will play during the layoff proc
ess.
The entire budget cutting and layoff
process places an "extra burden on many
Human Resources people," in particular,
on those workers involved in benefits and
placement, according to Smith.
"At the same time that there is a

probable cut in their staff resources"
their services are needed more, he added.
Smith said he hopes that by
decentralizing Human Resources, other
people can help "pick up the slack."
Although the exact number of staff
cuts has not yet been determined, Smith
said he hopes that some of the staff cuts
can be absorbed through attrition.
