# Sailors nipped by Cal, miss Nationals

"Next year."
Those were sailor Haley
King's parting words to her
crew, Marina Kimball, at 3:30
Monday morning after return
ing home from the Women's
Pacific Coast Championships
in San Diego.
After a weekend of intense
racing, the women's sailing
team finished two points be
hind California, leaving them
two points short of qualifying
for the United College Yacht
Racing Association Nationals.
Nine teams from the Pacific
Coast, including University of
Hawaii, competed last weekend
for the three berths to Nation
als. UC-Irvine's Rosalind
Meade and Lanee Butler left
the weekend unscathed as they
took the championship by well
over 20 points. Orange Coast
College placed second and the
Bears took third to gain the
other National berths.
King and Kimball, both
freshmen, sailed in A-Division,
while freshman Catherine Ivey
and sophomore Lisa Forssell
completed the Stanford boat in
B-Division. Although each pair
sailed several stunning races
during the weekend, their
finishes weren't quite consis

tent enough to place them
higher than fourth overall.
Although the team was tied
with UC-Santa Barbara by the
end of Saturday's racing, the
Stanford sailors increased their
concentration hard enough by
mid-Sunday to challenge Cal
for the third berth to Nation
als.
Unfortunately, King and
Kimball faced shifty winds and
an unexpected wind wall when
a steamer barged through their
final race. Ivey paired up with
Kim Grose for her final race,
yet the Cardinal team couldn't
beat Berkeley senior Margot
Sanguinetti in what would
have been the final race of her
collegiate career.
"It's disappointing," said
King, "but we have three more
years, and we're going to keep
trying our best."
The women's team qualified
for Nationals last year for the
first time in six years. Grose,
one of the skippers who qual
ified last year, commented,
"Going to women's Nationals
isn't something we can take
for granted. Even though we
didn't make it this year, Haley
and Catherine sailed some
amazing races this weekend
and have done some great
things this season."
