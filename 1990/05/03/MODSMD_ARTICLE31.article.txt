# Unbeaten and getting better
## Debbie Graham, 48-0 in dual matches, is a rising star in college tennis 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
When Debbie Graham was a freshman
last season, she was disappointed with
her position in the lineup. Coach Frank
Brennan placed her at No. 4 singles, and

she felt she should be higher.
Graham figured the easiest way to show
her coach the error in his ways was to
win. Early, often and always. Though she
suffered five defeats in individual compe
tition, Graham posted a perfect 27-0 mark
in dual-match play. This season, there's

been more of the same.
Twenty-one times Graham has stepped
onto the court in 1990 to help the Car
dinal extend it's extraordinary 61-match
winning streak, and each time she has
beaten her opponent. Of the 61 matches,
Graham has contributed to victory in 48
of them.
In Brennan's first nine years here, the
incomparable Patty Fendick was the only
player to record a perfect record in team
play over the course of a season. If
Graham wins all four matches at NCAAs
next week, she'll have already accom
plished the feat twice.
"Not bad for openers," you say, "but
what will she do for an encore?" Well,
last weekend Graham won the Pacific 10
Conference individual tournament,
beating teammates Meredith McGrath
and Sandra Birch, the Nos. 1 and 2 ranked
players in the country, along the way.
Her defeat of Birch was significant for
the sophomore in two ways. First of all,
it showed she could play her best against
one of her closest friends. In the past,
Birch was able to defeat Graham because
of the way the two approached the match.
"I would go out on the court to play
a friend of mine, and I would say, 'If I
win that would be great, and if I lose it's
no big deal,' " Graham explains. She had
trouble separating the off-the-court
friendship from the matter at hand on
the court. Birch had no such problem.
"The first couple of times I played her,
she was treating me like an opponent,"
Graham says."I was still trying to be
her friend, and she was trying to beat
_. , _ 99
me.
Brennan recognized that as well. The
night before she was to play Birch,
Graham remembers him saying: "What
tire you going to do? Roll over and die?"
Not this time. Graham not only beat
her good friend, she did so by an impres
sive 6-4, 6-1 score. Which brings up the
second reason her Pac-10 title was im
portant. Part of Graham's success last
weekend was a result of a change in her
style of play.
A baseliner all her life, Graham un
veiled the serve-and-volley style she has
been working on since her arrival here.
Already a power player, the attacking style
made her all that much more devastating.
In the past, she eschewed coming to
the net out of fear. "I kind of had this
wall in front of me," Graham says. "If I

missed a ball coming into the net, I was
so afraid." But of what? Graham is tall
and strong and seems to have the makings
of a prototypical serve-and-volleyer.
"Everyone tells me that," she says."I
didn't see that.. .until I did it last week
end. I needed that to show me what I
was capable of. Coming into the net,
you're so much more vulnerable. I'm so
used to having long points. Coming into
the net, you could just miss a ball im
mediately. It's kind of scary up there."
When she would miss, Graham would
"go back to my safety," i.e. the baseline.
From now on, though, she just might be
up at the net for good.
Now that the consistent winner has a
new offensive arsenal, it might be easy
for her to rest on her laurels. But neither
she nor Brennan seems willing to let that
happen.
Graham'B motivation comes from wan
ting to play No. 1 singles someday. Bren
nan wants Graham to harness what he
describes as "as much potential as
anybody I've ever had here at Stanford."
He says in the past her biggest problem
has been with "exotic shot selection."
Sometimes, Graham says, she will have
a big lead, and suddenly "I decide I'm
going to go for a backhand winner down
the line. Or, maybe I'll hit a ball into the
fence." Instead of making the smart play,
she would do something that left both
coach and player scratching their heads.
Graham credits her work with Asst.
Coach Lele Forood at helping her improve
that aspect of her game. And the results
have begun to become apparent. In the
past, Brennan says, "She played a
strategically perfect match against
Meredith McGrath," Brennan says.
"Debbie baffled not only Lele and myself,
but her opponent as well."
Graham has come so far that she could
probably turn professional and do quite
well. Instead, she plans on playing out
her four years at Stanford before leaving
the amateur ranks. She played on the
tour last summer and did not enjoy the
experience.
"I don't like living out of suitcases and
moving around all the time," she says.
"Last summer disillusioned me. It was
such a hard life, and it's very lonely. I
wanted to be back at school with my
friends."

Six-foot sophomore Debbie Graham took the Pac-10 Tournament by storm last
weekend, winning the singles title and reaching the doubles final. Graham has
never lost in a dual-match for the four-time defending national champion Cardinal.
When Debbie Graham was a freshman
last season, she was disappointed with
her position in the lineup. Coach Frank
Brennan placed her at No. 4 singles, and

she felt she should be higher.
Graham figured the easiest way to show
her coach the error in his ways was to
win. Early, often and always. Though she
suffered five defeats in individual compe
tition, Graham posted a perfect 27-0 mark
in dual-match play. This season, there's

been more of the same.
Twenty-one times Graham has stepped
onto the court in 1990 to help the Car
dinal extend it's extraordinary 61-match
winning streak, and each time she has
beaten her opponent. Of the 61 matches,
Graham has contributed to victory in 48
of them.
In Brennan's first nine years here, the
incomparable Patty Fendick was the only
player to record a perfect record in team
play over the course of a season. If
Graham wins all four matches at NCAAs
next week, she'll have already accom
plished the feat twice.
"Not bad for openers," you say, "but
what will she do for an encore?" Well,
last weekend Graham won the Pacific 10
Conference individual tournament,
beating teammates Meredith McGrath
and Sandra Birch, the Nos. 1 and 2 ranked
players in the country, along the way.
Her defeat of Birch was significant for
the sophomore in two ways. First of all,
it showed she could play her best against
one of her closest friends. In the past,
Birch was able to defeat Graham because
of the way the two approached the match.
"I would go out on the court to play
a friend of mine, and I would say, 'If I
win that would be great, and if I lose it's
no big deal,' " Graham explains. She had
trouble separating the off-the-court
friendship from the matter at hand on
the court. Birch had no such problem.
"The first couple of times I played her,
she was treating me like an opponent,"
Graham says."I was still trying to be
her friend, and she was trying to beat
_. , _ 99
me.
Brennan recognized that as well. The
night before she was to play Birch,
Graham remembers him saying: "What
tire you going to do? Roll over and die?"
Not this time. Graham not only beat
her good friend, she did so by an impres
sive 6-4, 6-1 score. Which brings up the
second reason her Pac-10 title was im
portant. Part of Graham's success last
weekend was a result of a change in her
style of play.
A baseliner all her life, Graham un
veiled the serve-and-volley style she has
been working on since her arrival here.
Already a power player, the attacking style
made her all that much more devastating.
In the past, she eschewed coming to
the net out of fear. "I kind of had this
wall in front of me," Graham says. "If I

missed a ball coming into the net, I was
so afraid." But of what? Graham is tall
and strong and seems to have the makings
of a prototypical serve-and-volleyer.
"Everyone tells me that," she says."I
didn't see that.. .until I did it last week
end. I needed that to show me what I
was capable of. Coming into the net,
you're so much more vulnerable. I'm so
used to having long points. Coming into
the net, you could just miss a ball im
mediately. It's kind of scary up there."
When she would miss, Graham would
"go back to my safety," i.e. the baseline.
From now on, though, she just might be
up at the net for good.
Now that the consistent winner has a
new offensive arsenal, it might be easy
for her to rest on her laurels. But neither
she nor Brennan seems willing to let that
happen.
