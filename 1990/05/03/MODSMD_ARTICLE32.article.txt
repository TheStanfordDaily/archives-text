# Panel discusses women inventors

Betty Graham, mother of Mi
chael Nesmitt of the Monkees,
invented correction fluid, com
monly known as Liquid Paper.
She took her idea to IBM and
was rejected, only to be bought
out a few years later by another
company for $50 million.
German chemist Ida Noddack
was the first to theorize the nu
clear fission process in 1934,
five years before two men —
who had scoffed at her sugges
tions — were awarded the Nobel
Prize for it.
Stanford student Laura Anne
Flax invented the "Bug Sucker,"
based on the "Dustbuster" but
shaped more like an anteater,
for a product design class in
1988. Now a large national firm
is attempting to market a prod
uct of similar design under the
same name.
These and other examples
raise issues regarding the
credibility and recognition of
women as inventors and scien
tists, the topic of a panel pre
sentation yesterday. The
discussion was part of the Jing
Lyman lecture series titled
"Lasting Impressions: The Sur

vival of Women's Ideas."
The program included a his
torical overview of women in sci
ence in the United States, a look
at a woman scientist's involve
ment in the discovery of nuclear
fission and the marketing of and
patent disputes over modern
products invented by women.
Science should be viewed as
"a socially constructed set of ar
rangements . . . which, as such,
reflects patriarchy," said Mar go
Horn, director of Innovative Ac
ademic Courses, who introduced
the panel.
"A woman scientist is an
anomaly by definition," because
she is viewed as both an oddity
among scientists and an oddity
among women, said Teri Hop
per, Women's Center coordina
tor. Hopper is writing a thesis
on Noddack's importance to the
history of science.
Working in Nazi Germany,
Noddack faced "extensive
misogyny and discrimination,"
said Hopper. "Many forces
served to marginalize Ida Nod
dack and centralize Otto Hans,"
the chemist who later won a
Nobel Prize for discovering nu
clear fission. Noddack's hus
band also received 12 Nobel

Prize nominations for work the
couple did together.
However, Hopper noted that
the scientific community's rejec
tion of Noddack's idea was in
fact a mixed blessing; had Ger
man scientists discovered fission
five years earlier, the Nazis
might have progressed further
toward creating the atomic
bomb.
Flax, the second speaker, in
cluded a slide show in her pre
sentation. A graduate student in
product design, she is engaged
in trademark litigation to
prevent Remington from using
the name "Bug Sucker." Al
though she has not accused the
company of copying her idea,
she finds the timing and cir
cumstances surrounding the
marketing of the company's
product "curious."
Flax has also invented remov
able high heels for women who
work in offices but need more
comfortable shoes for commut
ing. She said, "More products
for women should be designed
by women."
Flax is currently designing an
other product which she would
describe only as "a kitchen ap
pliance."
