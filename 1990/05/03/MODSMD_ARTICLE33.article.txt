# COP recount yields same winner

### Ken Yew Staff writer 
In a recount of the Council of
Presidents election last night, the
Students First slate, "A Clean
Slate," recovered 16 votes. While
confirming the victory of the
People's Platform slate "Four Our
Future," the recounted vote
brings the margin of victory to
only 61 votes.
According to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Steve Krauss, the
major errors causing the er
roneous original count arose in
the final tally of the votes.
Election officials entered the to
tals from each pollsite onto a
spreadsheet and may have typed

the wrong totals into the comput
er, Krauss said. Errors also arose
from the miscounting of paper ab
sentee ballots.
The only recourse left for "A
Clean Slate" to capture the elec
tion is to press the issue of count
ing write-in ballots that Krauss
deemed ineligible last week.
Tim Marklein of "A Clean
Slate" said the slate could obtain
a petition introducing a referen
dum vote that would decide the
write-in issue. However, he said
such a petition can be challenged
by the ASSU Senate, which would
probably vote the referendum
down.
"We are not planning to push
a referendum at this time,"

Marklein said.
Goodwin Liu, a "Four Our Fu
ture" slate member, said the slate
recognizes it does not have a large
rmyority of support among the
Stanford student body. Slate
members plan to study why their
victory margin was so slim and
will try to correct those problems.
Marklein said he plans to en
courage senate legislation that
will clarify the write-in issue. He
said the questions raised in the
election create doubts about the
legitimacy of next year's Council
of Presidents.
Marklein said the members of
"A Clean Slate" divided the $250
cost of the recount among the
four of them.
