On the otmnt of three we charged down
he road. Ifcvas on the right flank. As we
apjUotched the narrowest portion of the
road barrage of pellets
rained down on us. Two of our guys con
tinued running forward. Everyone else
dove for cover.
Instantly I realized my position was ex
posed on the left. Scanning the trees 15
feet away, I saw one of the enemy taking
a bead on me. He fired. I dropped against
a small embankment and watched his
pellets arc down into the dirt next to me.
With my gun in hand, I sprang up and
pulled the trigger. A loud hiss resulted as
my pellet pathetically dropped four feet in
front of me. I attempted to pull the slide
back to recock my gun. A pellet wizzed
by my head, exploding on a tree. My gun

would not cock. The CO2 cartridge was
empty.
Exposed and defenseless, I decided to
take my chances and run for the nearest
stump. I managed to reach the protection
of the stump without taking a shot. In
the confusion of the moment I had lost
track of my enemy.
Popping open tne grip of my gun, I
furiously attempted to load a new CO2
cartridge. As I did, my mind became over
whelmed with the image of the enemy
charging over the stump and gunning me
down at point-blank range. With my nand
left unsteady by adrenaline. I locked all
the parts of my weapon in place. I quickly
peered around the side of the stump.
Less than 20 feet away and closing in,
was one of the enemy. Reflexively, I nulled
the trigger My target balled up to deflect
the shot. A loud wince and tne mark of
my pellet were evidence of my latest kill.

With hands raised, he marched away mut
tering, "Dead ... Dead ... I'm dead."
Does Oliver Stone play wargames?
Would the enlightened scholars of Sun
ford University do the same?
You had better believe it.
On a recent Sunday morning, 38 stu
dents from Stanford traveled to Woodstalk,
a commerical paintball battlefield. Dressed
up like SCAAN members, we drove south
down Highway 17 until we reached Sum
mit Road. Located deep in a redwood for
est, Woodstalk was prepared for some
light-hearted combat.
In reality, what we did was more similar
to playing capture the flag than war. Each
game we played was complete with rules,
time limts and referees. The object was
to retrieve the enemy's flag while defend
ing your own. Nevertheless, with paint
pellets rocketing in every direction and
camouflaged people diving fot cover, the

sense of combat was real enough.
There were two basic types of games
which we played. Lending itself to the use
of a little strategy, the "long game" in
volved having the two teams' flags placed
far apart. On the other hand, in the "pond
game," the referees placed flags at the
opposite ends of a very small pond. This
type of game involved furious combat and
required less time.
During the course of the day we played
13 games. Three or four were draws, and
seven were victories for Tfcam Roble.
The sport is a lot like snow skiing; it
can be very expensive unless you own
your own equipment. The basic cost was
$20 per person. That included 20 paint
pellets, two COj cartridges and a gun.
For $6 more you could buy 100 paint
pellets. Most people paired up and split
the cost of the extra paint pellets. If you
wanted a long- barreled gun you haa to

come up with five more dollars. The con
sensus on the long barrel was that its
easier handling and increased accuracy
were worth the money.
"How much does it hurt when you get
shot?" You will definitely know it when
you are hit. However, the little amount
of rain you do feel quickly subsides leaving
only a small bruise. Generally, you will
come out of a day of wargames better off
than after a night of broomball.
"Is it a coed sport?" No question Both
my roommate and I scored female kills.
"Don't only warmongers play war
games?" Absolutely not. While playing is
incredible fun, it will do more to make
you think about the horror of war than
any lecture, book or film. After we had
returned from playing, we were sobered
by the realization that if the paint pellets
had been 7.62 mm bullets instead, we all
would have died.
