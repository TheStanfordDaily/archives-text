# Welcoming 'The Beautiful South'

Over the span of their hegemony
in British pop in the '80s, Johnny
Marr and Morrissey of the Smiths
made an indelible mark on the
way pop music would sound for
years to come. After "Strangeways"
in 1987, the Smiths disbanded,
leaving a sizable gap in British
popular music.

Welcome to Beautiful South

As a tribute to the Smiths' great
ness, many groups grew out of
their inspiration. Of the more
deserving heirs to the throne were
the Housemartins, who were often
compared to the Smiths in their
vocal style, pop sensibility and off
hand, casual morbidity.
Now, with the Housemartins
gone (disbanded due to changes in
artistic goals), another worthy suc
cessor has arrived: The Beautiful
South, a band whose members in
clude former Housemartins
vocalist Paul Heaton and drummer
Dave Hemmingway. In their debut
album, "Welcome to The Beautiful
South," they display once again
their uncanny knowledge of the
craft of writing pop music.
The style of the music follows
directly from the most recent
Housemartins offerings. It is a
mixture of ballads and upbeat,
catchy tunes — the usual folk-rock
and rock with some calypso and
other interesting influences.

Like the Smiths, The Beautiful
South is able to take slightly mor
bid scenarios and transform them
with charming, innocuous
sounding melodies into great pop
songs. The song "Woman In the
Wall/' for example, is an upbeat
song about a dead wife hidden in
side a wall. Heaton's vocals
throughout the album are pleasant
if a little breathy (like Morissey),

and the guest vocals by Brianna
Corrigan (from the Anthill
Runaways) are quite good.
A unique offering of The Beau
tiful South is the rarely exposed
perspective of its musicians.
Songwriters David Rotheray and
Heaton even seem comfortable dis
cussing the sources of their inspi
ration, without pretense. In "Song
for Whoever," Heaton sings of the

women whom he "loves from the
bottom of [his] pencil case," the
women whose attentions
presumably gave him song- writing
material. In fact, he begins to name
them: Jennifer, Alison. Phillipa,
Sue, Deborah, Annabel t00... You
made me so much money. I wrote
this song for you.
