# Welcoming 'The Beautiful South'

### Paul Yu Staff writer 
Over the span of their hegemony
in British pop in the '80s, Johnny
Marr and Morrissey of the Smiths
made an indelible mark on the
way pop music would sound for
years to come. After "Strangeways"
in 1987, the Smiths disbanded,
leaving a sizable gap in British
popular music.

Welcome to Beautiful South

As a tribute to the Smiths' great
ness, many groups grew out of
their inspiration. Of the more
deserving heirs to the throne were
the Housemartins, who were often
compared to the Smiths in their
vocal style, pop sensibility and off
hand, casual morbidity.
Now, with the Housemartins
gone (disbanded due to changes in
artistic goals), another worthy suc
cessor has arrived: The Beautiful
South, a band whose members in
clude former Housemartins
vocalist Paul Heaton and drummer
Dave Hemmingway. In their debut
album, "Welcome to The Beautiful
South," they display once again
their uncanny knowledge of the
craft of writing pop music.
The style of the music follows
directly from the most recent
Housemartins offerings. It is a
mixture of ballads and upbeat,
catchy tunes — the usual folk-rock
and rock with some calypso and
other interesting influences.

Like the Smiths, The Beautiful
South is able to take slightly mor
bid scenarios and transform them
with charming, innocuous
sounding melodies into great pop
songs. The song "Woman In the
Wall/' for example, is an upbeat
song about a dead wife hidden in
side a wall. Heaton's vocals
throughout the album are pleasant
if a little breathy (like Morissey),

and the guest vocals by Brianna
Corrigan (from the Anthill
Runaways) are quite good.
A unique offering of The Beau
tiful South is the rarely exposed
perspective of its musicians.
Songwriters David Rotheray and
Heaton even seem comfortable dis
cussing the sources of their inspi
ration, without pretense. In "Song
for Whoever," Heaton sings of the

women whom he "loves from the
bottom of [his] pencil case," the
women whose attentions
presumably gave him song- writing
material. In fact, he begins to name
them: Jennifer, Alison. Phillipa,
Sue, Deborah, Annabel t00... You
made me so much money. I wrote
this song for you.

The Beautiful South band members pose for a boring photo.
The melody is heartfelt and
sweet, the music a touching ballad.
Yet, contrasting this pristine
image, the singer dryly declares
that these past, interchangeable re
lationships have been a great boon
to songwriting and making money.
Most of the other songs reveal
this disarming candor. "Love Is
..questions the sincerity of a
pop star's admirers. So here's an
invitation to this caring nation/25
years from now will you come to
my cremation! .. . Will you be
there * Will you be there! The lyrics
in turn ask his lover, his friends
and even his family, if they would
be so caring if there were "no fame,
no fortune, no name in lights."

On the other hand, the same
honesty is also funny and endear
ing on some of the other tracks.
"I Love You (But You're Boring)"
is a wonderful, Robyn Hitchcock
like love ballad to a very unremark
able lover, with nonsensical lyrics.
Bake phallic cake/Carry round
sticky tape/and love those devil
dogs/Be an Indian elephant.
Overall, their honesty works in
their favor, by making the music
sincere and genuine. Their open
ness lets them cut across distances
and get the point across, and this,
in my opinion, is really the purpose
of pop music: to carry emotion
without excessive pretense.
"Welcome" accomplishes just
this. In the process, The Beautiful
South makes some beautiful music
to go along with it all.
