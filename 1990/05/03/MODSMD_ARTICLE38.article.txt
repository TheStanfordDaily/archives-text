# 'The Sundays' learn the basics
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
The clich6d educational stand
ards known as the "three R's,"
reading, writing and arithmetic, in
stantly spark memories of bonng
subjects, basic concepts and
tedious material taught to us in
our youths.
For the Sundays, the three R's
take on quite a different meaning.
The band's debut album, "Reading,
Writing and Arithmetic," blends a
serene voice and atmospheric
music to sharp-tongued songs like
"I Kicked a Boy."
The odd combination is incred
ibly deceiving; it's easy to be lulled
by lead singer Harriet Wheeler's
sweet voice. Similar to the In
nocence Mission's Karen Peris,
Wheeler adds dashes of her English
accent to her bare, intimate vocals,
creating a earthy, simple sound.
But Wheeler's vocals conceal
lyrics which range from
humorously ironic to passionately
paradoxical. "I Kicked a Boy" twists
the common "boy meets girl, boy
falls in love with girl" theme into

a bizarre antithesis of traditional
love. Instead, the girl meets the
boy, then kicks him downstairs
without a second thought. "1
kicked a boy 'til he cried/I could
have been wrong, but I don't think
I was."
Other, less-shocking songs on
"Reading, Writing and Arithmetic"
do justice to Wheeler's vocals by
coupling them with more sedate
lyrics. In "My Finest Hour," she
grasps to capture a moment of in

nocence. "I keep hoping you are
the same as me/I'll send you letters
and come to your house for tea."
"My Finest Hour" spotlights her
musical range as well as the acous
tic guitars of David Gavurin.
"Here's Where the Story Ends,"
one of the album's stronger tracks,
softens the drums and bass to
highlight the simple vocals. This
recently-released song, currently
receiving airplay on modern rock
radio stations, follows the band's
successful debut single, "Can't Be
Sure." The haunting, melodic
track, propelled by its dreamy
rnitar, reached #1 on British in
dependent charts.
The simplistic musical style of
the Sundays is well-refinea and
solid, yet, the band's intimacy and
passion often accompany simple
lyrics which seem too bizarre for
such an earthy band.
"Reading, Writing and Arith
metic" proves that the Sundays
have the basics down. In the fu
ture, the band should look toward
building upon their strong founda
tion in ways which prove musically
and lyrically compatible.
