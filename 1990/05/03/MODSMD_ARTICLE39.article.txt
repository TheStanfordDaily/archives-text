## Colin Hay returns Former 'Man at Work' goes solo 
### Tim Marklein 
Colin Hay is going through
an identity crnis.
Ever since Men at Work dis
solved, the former frontman has
been searching for his own per
sonal sound, trying to develop
his own niche in the music
business. That search actually
began when the popular
Australian band started to
crumble before him, after an
unpopular third and final al
bum.
One year later, Colin James
Hay emerged with a strong solo
album titled "Looking for Jack,"
which reminded the few who
bought it why Men at Work
received such initial acclaim.
But the album's lack of financial
success left Hay without a
record label.
Now, four years later, Hay
has dropped the middle name
and added a "Band" for his
MCA debut, "Wayfaring Sons."
(Hay apparently had little choice
about the name change, as an
other artist named Colin James
has recently appeared on record
shelves.)
Unfortunately for Hay,
"Wayfaring Sons" fails to distin
guish him like "Business As
Usual" did, and widespread
popularity will most likely not
follow from this album. It's the

0 Colin Hay
Wayfaring Sons

type of music that won't force
radio listeners to change the
dial, but won't move them
enough to light up request lines.
The album's country-rock
sound mixes heavy doses of
acoustic guitars, slide guitars,
violins and mandolins with the
usual electric guitar, bass guitar,
drums and keyboards. Hay has
also become acquainted with E
bow guitars, a unique instru
ment primarily used by Scottish
rock band Big Country.
Although the pleasant music
sounds more rock than country,
the songs share one feature of
most country music: the lack
of distinguishing characteris
tics.
Like on later Men At Work
albums and his previous solo
effort, Hay's vocals serve as the
highlight. His tremendous range
complements his ability to in
tersperse vocal hooks where
they don't exist in the music.
"Don't Drink the Water," a
rare social commentary about
pollution in New Jersey, Cher
nobyl and elsewhere, brings out
that range in Hay's most in
spired vocal performance on the
album.
