# Many women athletes receive obscene calls
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
An anonymous man has been
telephoning several varsity
women athletes with the promise
of a sexual phone fantasy, accord
ing to members of various teams.
Several women from the swim,
golf, basketball and other teams
have reported receiving a call or
calls from a man who claims to
be from a company called Fanta
sies Unlimited. Because of their
similar content and nature, the
calls are believed to have been
made by the same person.
He asks the woman if she is
"expecting a big event"and says
"a friend has sent (her) a surprise
gift," according to Susannah Mil
ler, captain of the women's swim
team, who recently received a call.
"He sounds legit at first. He
doesn't tell you it's a phone fan
tasy until well into the conversa
tion," Miller said.
She said the man then explains
that a friend has a sexual message
for him to deliver. "He says it's
provocative and that you'll er\joy
it," she added.
In addition, Miller said "it takes
a long time to get the informa
tion" from the man and that he
won't give his name or number.
Several women athletes believe
the man follows women's sports
closely or has used the media
guides produced for the various
teams to obtain the women's
names.
Junior golfer Jodi Figley, who
received a call Monday morning,
said the man "said he was from
an entertainment bureau," later
adding that he had some "phone
entertainment" for her.
Figley said he read her a mes
sage signed with the initials of a
teammate, who supposedly sent
the "gift."
"I said I wasn't interested in
receiving his services and hung

up," Figley said.
"He wasn't obscene," she noted.
"He was being very professional."
Nonetheless, Figley said of the
call, "It's really sick."
Other women receiving calls
also reported that the man seems
professional and convincing. "He
sounds like he knows what he's
talking about," sophomore golfer
Audrey Wooding said.
Wooding, who received a call
Tuesday morning, said when she
asked the man for his phone num
ber, "he said he must have the
wrong number and hung up."
"I didn't feel threatened,"
Wooding said.
The pranks began last October
when a women's basketball player
received one phone call. Miller
said she was telephoned in Janu
ary. This past week, several more
women have reported receiving
similar calls.
"Just now, people are starting
to talk about it," Wooding said.
Wooding said that when she
mentioned her call to other ath
letes in the training room, at least
five other women said they too
had been contacted by the man.
"And I'm sure there's plenty that
haven't talked about it," Wooding
said.
The problem "is probably more
widespread than we know," Miller
added.
"So many women are getting
these calls," said sophomore
swimmer Michelle David, who re
ceived a call Monday afternoon.
"I was really convinced at first,"
she added.
According to David, no woman
has yet received an obscene or
sexually explicit call. "Everyone
shut him ofT before they had a
chance to hear it," she said, add
ing that he would probably deliver
such a message "if he were given
a chance."
Several swimmers have re
ceived harassing calls in the past,
although they have not been con
nected with this recent streak of
calls.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said two women filed
reports Tuesday. One had received
a call in January, while the other
received a call Monday. "It ap

pears that somebody out there has
got a thing about women ath
letes," he said.
"It's not unusual for celebrities
to get some harassment,"
Niemeyer said. People whose
names have appeared in The Daily
on several occasions have been
known to have people follow

them, send flowers, write letters
or call, he noted.
Niemeyer added that "two or
three" other similar cases had
been filed earlier this year. At
present, he said the police depart
ment has no leads and "needs
more specific information" to nab
the caller.
