# If 'I'm not Rappaport, 'then who is?
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Herb Gardner's Tony Award
winning comedy "I'm Not Rap
paport" is a well-constructed play
that places the important but broad
social issues of loneliness, aging
and urban violence into a concrete
framework.
In this month's production of
the play at Menlo Park's Burgess
Theatre, George Ward and Lonnie
Ford star as octogenarians Nat and
Midge, who meet in New York's
Central Park to befriend and fre
quently exasperate each other.
Nat wins friends and manip
ulates enemies by fabricating wild
stories and identities; he dis
tributes fake business cards and
poses as an undercover agent, con
gressman, doctor, lawyer and
mafioso. By pretending to be
somone else while interfering in
others' lives, he avoids facing his
lack of control over his own life.
Midge's approach is less con
frontational. He'd rather acquiesce
than put up a fight, and even
thinks it's smart when he has to
pay protection money to a park
hoodlum.
Considering himself a "wise old
invisible man," Midge has kept his
job as superintendent in his apart
ment complex because he hasn't
"mentioned a raise in 15 years,
and they ain't neither." By living
a quiet life, Midge survives well
until he is told that he's no longer
needed and will be displaced.
On opening night, the perform

ances were impressive, despite
minor distractions with a faulty
lighting board. Ward has played
many character parts on the
Theatre Works' stage, and it must
be an enormous challenge for him

to invent new gestures and pat
terns of speech.
Still, in "I'm Not Rappaport,"
Ward is convincing as a retired
Jewish socialist unable to accept
ordinary life. Occasionally, though,

when he acts as Midge's attorney,
Ward drops character and falls into
old patterns that he knows will
elicit a laugh.

George Ward as Nat and Lonnie Ford as Midge laugh It up In "I'm not Rappaport."
In a strong scene with his
daughter, Clara (Vicki Willey), his
daughter threatens him with his
history of harassment and imper
sonation, and gives him the ul
timatum to either move in with
her, go to a nursing home or attend
a senior citizen's center. Ward finds
something very personal to relate
to in this scene, and his acting
becomes specific and mesmerizing.
As Midge, Ford is focused every
minute he is on stage, taking time
to listen and respond to each bit
of dialogue. His patience adds
depth and dimension to his role.
It's refreshing to see an actor so
comfortable and alive.
Gardner's script is filled with
laugh lines, but in the sensitive
hands of director Ric Prindle, the
words take on richness and mean
ing. In a riotous scene where the
men complain about their poor
eyesight and recurring glaucoma,
Nat and Midge utilize a marijuana
cigarette to relax and reminisce
about their past loves.

While Midge chastises himself
for having the "curse" of being a
womanizer, having cheated every
one of his four wives, faithful Nat
credits Midge with having "dared
and did," where he only "yearned
and regretted." The delicate yet
complex texture to this play ex
pands on the character's thoughts
to be sentimental and serious with
out preaching.
The philosophies of Nat and
Midge are often revealed through
the actions of the minor charac
ters: Danforth (Jack Davis), Laurie
(Tara Prescott), Cowboy (Louis
Landman) and Gilley (Randy
Doke). The entire supporting cast
provides color and verve to the cen
tral theme of two men helping one
another through change, gradually
accepting and finally appreciating
each other.

"I'm Not Rappaport" plays Tues
day through Saturday at 8 p.m.
and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. and 7
p.m. through May 26 at the
Burgess Theatre, 601 Laurel Street
