# If 'I'm not Rappaport, 'then who is?

winning comedy "I'm Not Rap
paport" is a well-constructed play
that places the important but broad
social issues of loneliness, aging
and urban violence into a concrete
framework.
In this month's production of
the play at Menlo Park's Burgess
Theatre, George Ward and Lonnie
Ford star as octogenarians Nat and
Midge, who meet in New York's
Central Park to befriend and fre
quently exasperate each other.
Nat wins friends and manip
ulates enemies by fabricating wild
stories and identities; he dis
tributes fake business cards and
poses as an undercover agent, con
gressman, doctor, lawyer and
mafioso. By pretending to be
somone else while interfering in
others' lives, he avoids facing his
lack of control over his own life.
Midge's approach is less con
frontational. He'd rather acquiesce
than put up a fight, and even
thinks it's smart when he has to
pay protection money to a park
hoodlum.
Considering himself a "wise old
invisible man," Midge has kept his
job as superintendent in his apart
ment complex because he hasn't
"mentioned a raise in 15 years,
and they ain't neither." By living
a quiet life, Midge survives well
until he is told that he's no longer
needed and will be displaced.
On opening night, the perform

ances were impressive, despite
minor distractions with a faulty
lighting board. Ward has played
many character parts on the
Theatre Works' stage, and it must
be an enormous challenge for him

to invent new gestures and pat
terns of speech.
Still, in "I'm Not Rappaport,"
Ward is convincing as a retired
Jewish socialist unable to accept
ordinary life. Occasionally, though,

when he acts as Midge's attorney,
Ward drops character and falls into
old patterns that he knows will
elicit a laugh.
