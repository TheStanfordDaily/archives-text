# Ex-Bronski Beater still delivers
## 
### Tim Marklein 
Keeping up with Jimmy Somerville's career is not
the easiest task in the world.
Four years ago, the former lead singer of Bronski
Beat embarked on a two-album stint with classically
trained musician Richard Coles, teaming together to
form the Communards and develop a unique style
best termed "techno-popera."
Now, Somerville's out on his own, without the
operatic influence but still with a flair for the dra
matic. The trademark high-pitch vocals dance along
with an electronic beat that is sure to find its way
into clubs this summer.
The first single, "You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real),"
will be there even sooner, as heavy horns and piano
round out the jubilant up- tempo sound.
While the single strikes the same chord as past
Somerville dance hits, like Bronski's "Hit That Perfect

Beat" and the Communards "Don't Leave Me This
Way," the rest of the album's songs play target practice
with the right formula.
"Comment Te Dire Adieu" hits it with a splendid
bass-synth hook that complements the French vocals
of Somerville and June Miles Kingston, whose duets
highlighted the Communards debut.
On the flip side, the absence of such extra elements
makes uninspiring songs like "Heaven Here On
Earth" and "Don't Know What To Do Without You"
fall short of the mark.
While most of Somerville's solo debut focuses on
the traditional themes of love
found and love lost, the songwriter
continues to remind us that there's
more to love than boy meets girl.
The fight for gay rights and
money for AIDS research comes
through loud and clear in "Read
My Lips (Enough Is Enough)":
"Finding cures is not the only so
lution/And it's not a case of
sinner's absolution/So we'll fight
for love and with pride/We'll
fight/Standing together for the right
to live and die with dignity."
Making up for his occasional
lapses in emotion, inspired and
soulful songs like the title track
make Somerville's lips worth
reading.
