# Try dining in true Eritrean style
## 
### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
Eritrea, a region in Ethopia,
has long been fighting for
recognition as a nation. The
Dahlak Eritrean restaurant in
Sunnyvale is doing its part for
the struggle: it wages a lonely
battle for quality in the middle
of the worst shopping center
you've ever seen.
If you can bear its surround
ings, Dahlak will reward you
amply. For one thing, you get to
eat with your fingers. Food is
served on a big metal circle that
provides for everyone at your

table. Injera, thin, pliable bread
with a slight lemon flavor, is
used as a utensil — tastier and
easier on the digestion than
stainless steel.
The dishes I tried ranged from
collard greens to potatoes to
lamb, but you can order just
meat or just vegetables if you
prefer. Whichever gastronomical
path you choose, Dahlak is a
great alternative to hot dogs and
pizza when you want to caress

what you consume.
The food at Dahlak is varied
in flavor and spicy, but it's not
just the exotic taste that makes
this cuisine so satisfying. Having
a meal at Dahlak is like eating
a salad after living on candy bars
for a week, for those of you who
know that feeling; you experience
a sublime synthesis of tongue
and gut.
People who still don't know
what I'm talking about will just
have to try it for themselves. (I
recommend Skor bars.) And
whether you have undertaken the
candy bar regime or not, Dahlak's
green salad with flax seed dressing
is terrific.
Prices are moderate, so don't
skip extras like the traditional
Eritrean coffee. Poured from a
gourd and drunk from tiny cups
reminiscent of shot glasses, the
coffee is strong and dark like
espresso, but not bitter.
If you like unusual food, Dahlak
is worth the pilgrimage down U.S.
101 to Sunnyvale.
