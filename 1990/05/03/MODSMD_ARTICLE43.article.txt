Intermission Recommends
Miami Blues
The problem with -Miami Blues" is not the
ieaci actors, as some narrow-minded reviewers
have written. Alec Baldwin is quite good as the
edgy ex-con Junior.
Director George Armitage's film runs aground
because it has no direction. Once Junior starts
becoming domesticated by his "princess not
so-bright" the viewer loses Interest.
Then again, maybe that is the noint h.t »
is not worth $6.50 to find out.
Usa
If you are even considering seeing this film,
you only have two excuses.
Either, you have a Cheryl Ladd fetish that
has not been satisified by "Charlie's Angels"
reruns, or you have a thing for junior high kids.
Rated PG-13, this epic suspense-thriller con
cerns a teenage girl, Lisa, who flirts with a
yuppie and finds out he is a serial killer.
Luckily, this harrowing tale tears mother
(Cheryl Ladd) and daughter apart.
Body Chemistry
Remember the hero of the TV series "V,"
Marc Singer. Well, he's back as Dr. Tom Red
ding in the film "Body Chemistry," another limp
sexual thriller. Singer plays a family man who
decides to have a brief affair with a loony
psychologist.
When Singer's character rejects her for his
family, she decides to get even. Does this
sound like a familar story, or what?
