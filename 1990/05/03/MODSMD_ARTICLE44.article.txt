# 'Q&A' takes too big a bite out of crime and chokes

Policc corruption is a hot topic in Hollywood these
days; "Internal Affairs" and "Miami Blues" are just
two of the latest films to explore the darker side of
law enforcement.

Â©Q&A
Timothy Hutton, Nick Nofte

Director Sidney Lumet has been doing such pot
boilers for years now ("Serpico," "Prince of the City")
and his latest, "Q&A," is a very grand, ambitious
and noble mess.
The story ccnters around A 1 Reilly, a young as
sistant district attorney who is called on to investigate
a case of "justifiable" homicide. Apparently, a highly
respected police officer shot and killed a Hispanic
drug dealer in self defense (the audience is shown
what really happened in the opening scene, and it
is clear that the cop murdered the victim intention
ally).
Soon, Reilly gets swept into the ruthless world of
corrupt policemen and drug kingpins, unraveling a
complex case in which racism provides fuel for the
ongoing fire.
The biggest problem with "Q6IA" is that it's too
cluttered and complicated. There are over 15 major
characters, several ongoing plots and plenty of mean
ingless, overdrawn scenes. Everyone in the film looks
and dresses alike, making it impossible to tell the
good from the bad (perhaps Lumet's intention). Char
acters disappear from the screen for 20 minutes at
a time and then reappear out of nowhere.
Timothy Hutton, as the wet-behind-the-ears as
sistant DA, has about as much charisma as a lump
of coal. His scenes are dull and lifeless, and his
Brooklyn accent comes and goes. Jenny Lumet, the
director's daughter, makes her screen debut as Hut
ton's love interest. She sobs her way through the
movie with one hand over her face at all times (I'd
be embarrassed too).
Perhaps the one outstanding feature of the film is
Nick Nolte, who plays the murderous, racist cop.
His first scene is Oscar-caliber, as he describes how
he threw an Italian junkie out a window one day.
The scene is filmed in one long take, and Nolte's
gestures, mannerisms and accent are mesmerizing.

It is the film's strongest and most memorable
scene, for he establishes such a presence that it is
easy to see how his character can get away with
murder. Not since Jack Nicholson in "Batman" has
an actor so singlehandedly snatched a film away
from the real stars, and it's a pleasure watching him
upstage his counterparts.
Director Lumet seems to be trying to make a
hybrid out of Tom Wolfe's novel "Bonfire of the
Vanities" and Spike Lee's film "Do the Right Thing."
Racial epithets fly like bullets and the New York

social commentary is forever biting. But the finger
that Lumet points at our society is all but broken
off by the much-too-intricate narrative, which de
mands our complete and unfaltering attention.
In short, Lumet outdoes himself, trying to address
issues that a month-long mini-series would have
trouble doing.
"Q&A" is a chore to watch. It's a mettled labyrinth
that is about as exciting as a crossword puzzle in a
foreign language.
