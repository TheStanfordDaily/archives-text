# 'Guardian' isn't worth guarding
## 
### Kelly Parsons Staff writer 
In 1973 William Friedkin, direc
tor of "The Exorcist," proved to
Hollywood that armed only with
a sweet, innocent newcomer
named Linda Blair and a lot of pea
soup, he could scare the collective
pants off of film audiences every
where.
Unfortunately, Friedkin's im
pressive abilities as a director of
horror are wasted on his newest
movie, "The Guardian," a tired,
uninspired and thoroughly dull tale
of human sacrifice, dark magic,
and . .. trees.
"The Guardian" relates the story
of a yuppie-ish couple who, im
mersed in their respective careers,
decide to employ a live-in
housekeeper to care for their new
born son. After the first woman
they hire dies under mysterious
circumstances, the couple takes on
another nanny named Camilla
(Jenny Seagrove), a dark, mysteri
ous woman with an English accent
and a rather disturbing penchant

OThe Guardian
Jenny Seagrove

for feeding male babies to monster
trees.
It seems that, unbeknownst to
her employers, Camilla is some
sort of evil arborial spirit. A hold
over from the days of the druids,
Camilla, accompanied by a gnarled
oak that has an insatiable appetite
for human blood, has somehow
found her way to modem-day Los
Angeles.
Will the couple discover the
chilling truth about their
seemingly innocent housekeeper in
time to save their child from her
wicked clutches?
Unfortunately, the answer to
this question is painfully obvious.
The movie's story hobbles along
aimlessly, eventually drawing to a
disappointingly predictable conclu
sion.
Along the way, the audience is
bombarded with a muddled tangle
of natural symbolism that includes

repeated references to water, trees,
forest animals and earthquakes.
Although these images vaguely al
lude to Camilla and her druidic
religion, they are disjointed and
confusing, amounting to a series
of annoying distractions that in
terfere with the pace of the action.
The acting is, for the most part,
bland and non-descript; most of
the cast seems to be sleepwalking
through their respective roles,
delivering their lines with the
automated precision of Dis
neyland's audio-animatronically
controlled Mr. Lincoln.
Still, there are moments when
Friedkin's directorial expertise
bursts through the murky haze sur
rounding the story. Friedkin fre
quently utilizes, for instance,
oblique, disturbing camera angles
that turn what would be an other
wise normal scene into a disquiet
ing montage of horror.
Furthermore, a disturbing
amount of this violence is directed
specifically against women, ulti
mately reducing the entertainment
value of "The Guardian."
