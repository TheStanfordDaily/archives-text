# Nothing ‘Wild' about 'Orchid'
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
"Wild Orchid" should have
been rated PG-13 because the
only audience that will find this
film effective is in junior high.
This is not to say that the film
lacks non-stop sex. The problem
is that it is about as subtle and
erotic as mating farm animals.
Director Zalman King's latest
attempt at a daring, mainstream
sex film has been billed as the
hottest thing since "9 1/2
Weeks." At least "9 1/2 Weeks,"
which King produced, had some
substance, and that's not saying
much.
Now, I know this type of film
is supposed to be a fantasy, but,
come on, they have got to be
kidding. If you wanted to
describe the plot of the film in
pseudo-literary terms it would be
the awakening of a young wom
an's sexual identity a la Manlyn
Chambers.

everyday beautiful, young attor
ney from Kansas — who speaks
every major language represented
in World Cup soccer competition
— goes to New York City for an
interview with a major interna
tional law firm. Within minutes
of showing up in New York, she
is off to Rio De Janerio with one
of the firm's partners, Claudia
(Jacqueline Bisset) to close a deal
to build a beachfront resort.
Something comes up concern
ing the resort which requires
Claudia to fly to Buenos Aires,
forcing the virginal Emily to go
on a blind date wearing a low-cut
evening dress. Her date is a
"mysterious" man named
Wheeler (Mickey Rourke).
After much mental foreplay,
Emily discovers that the
seemingly licentious Wheeler
has a problem. He claims to have

become so jaded that he prefers
to watch instead of participate.
For much of the film Emily ac
quiesces, allowing Wheeler and
the audience to watch her loosen
her collar.
By the climax of the film, Emi
ly, having moved out of the
sexual minor leagues, decides to
go for rookie-of-the-year by sleep
ing with Wheeler. She manages
to bring Wheeler to orgasm, but
it is hard to tell in this dullest
scene of the movie.
None of the performances is
better than mediocre. Only Jac
queline Bisset seems to enjoy
herself in one of the campiest
performance of the year.
Rourke gives his worst version
of his umpteenth performance of
the guy from the wrong side of
the tracks. He sounds like Mike
Tyson when he speaks the in
credible, laughable dialogue, and
his tan looks like a bad make-up
job.
