Nine intruders dressed in camouflage and
armed with fake weapons entered the Roble
Hall dining area yesterday evening and ab
ducted English Prof. Ronald Rebholz and
senior Sarah Fandell.
The dramatized kidnapping was part of
a series of guerrilla theater actions known
as Project Awareness. Sponsored by the

Stanford Central America Action Network,
the week-long operation aims to raise stu
dent awareness of the United States' links
to death-squad activities in El Salvador and
Guatemala.
More than 40 participants, including
ASSU senators, student activists, faculty and
staff, have volunteered this week to be
publicly threatened by means of fliers and
abductions by "death squads."
While some kidnappers pointed their

weapons at witnesses and two others lifted
Rebholz and Fandell from their chairs, the
head of the death squad engaged the wit
nesses' attention, condemning the two tar
gets as campus "subversives."
She warned the crowd of Rebholz's power
to corrupt impressionable undergraduates
by teaching "Marx instead of Macbeth" and
of Fandell's dangerous feminist activities on
