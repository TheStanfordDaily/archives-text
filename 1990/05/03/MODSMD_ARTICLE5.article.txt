# SCAAN 'abducts' English professor, senior
## 
### Brooke Hart Staff writer 
Nine intruders dressed in camouflage and
armed with fake weapons entered the Roble
Hall dining area yesterday evening and ab
ducted English Prof. Ronald Rebholz and
senior Sarah Fandell.
The dramatized kidnapping was part of
a series of guerrilla theater actions known
as Project Awareness. Sponsored by the

Stanford Central America Action Network,
the week-long operation aims to raise stu
dent awareness of the United States' links
to death-squad activities in El Salvador and
Guatemala.
More than 40 participants, including
ASSU senators, student activists, faculty and
staff, have volunteered this week to be
publicly threatened by means of fliers and
abductions by "death squads."
While some kidnappers pointed their

weapons at witnesses and two others lifted
Rebholz and Fandell from their chairs, the
head of the death squad engaged the wit
nesses' attention, condemning the two tar
gets as campus "subversives."
She warned the crowd of Rebholz's power
to corrupt impressionable undergraduates
by teaching "Marx instead of Macbeth" and
of Fandell's dangerous feminist activities on

English Prof. Ronald Rebholz Is "abducted" last night In Roble Dining Hall by members of the Stanford Central America Action Network.
The staged kidnapping was part of SCAAN's ongoing attempt to raise awareness about the political situations In El Salvador and

campus.
She explained that the squad
was defending the ideology of the
"esteemed Hoover Institution,"
which for the purposes of Project
Awareness represents the death
squad-sponsoring Salvadoran and
Guatemalan governments.
Among the 15 SCAAN abduc
tions yesterday was also that of
Nat Sheidley, a senior, who was
kidnapped from the Yost House
dining area.
"I think that what SCAAN is
doing is excellent in terms of the
impact it will have on campus
awareness regarding the disap
pearances and killings in El Sal
vador and Guatemala. Even
though I expected [to be abduc
ted], I found it a harrowing ex
perience. It made me personally
think about what it would be like
to be a victim," he said.
SCAAN will stage more than
30 mock kidnappings this week.
The student group solicited facul
ty, staff and students whose ac
tivities on campus challenge
conservatism to participate in the
abductions. The volunteers repre
sent individuals in El Salvador
and Guatemala whose beliefs op
pose those of the death-squad
sponsoring governments.

'Even though I ex
pected [to be abduc
ted], I found it a har
rowing experience.'

Last week a professor at the
University of El Salvador was ab
ducted and killed, and during this
academic year 15 Guatemalan
students have disappeared. The
bodies of 11 of these students have
been found on campuses so far,
according to graduate student
Steve Piche, the head of SCAAN.
The goal of Project Awareness,
according to Piche, is "to change
the current U.S. foreign policy, a
policy which indirectly supports
the use of death squads all in the
name of preventing communism.
"We want our congressman,
Tom Campbell, to vote to cut oft
military aid to El Salvador. We
feel that if Mr. Campbell's con
stituency is made aware of the
connection between the Salva
doran military and death squads,
he will be forced to vote to cut
off military aid," Piche said.
Since the enactments are often
graphic and realistic, SCAAN
agreed this year to notify Univer
sity authorities when and where
they plan to strike, and to
forewarn witnesses that the kid
nappings are only dramatizations
of death-squad abductions.
