A grass fire near the golf driving range yesterday
morning was contained to a half-acre of damage,
largely due to the efforts of passers-by.
Ironically, the short blaze resulted from an at
tempt to improve fire safety.
Mike Garretson of Anza Engineering Corp. was
clearing a pathway of bollards to provide easier
emergency access to Governor's Corner.
In the process, he struck a steel plate, starting
sparks which leapt to the grass, said Capt. Dale
Hopkins of the Palo Alto Fire Department.
Ronald Howard, an equipment operator with
Santa Clara County, was watering the landscape
near Junipero Serra Boulevard and was told about
the fire.
Driving his water truck to the scene, Howard
circled the perimeter and sprayed the area.
"Basically, I had the right product at the right
time," he said.
"He was a great help," said Mark Swineford of
Environmental Health and Safety.
Students from nearby golf and tennis classes also
contributed by shoveling dirt on the remnants of
the fire and pushing four cars out of its path.
"Three of us were working around the edges,
trying to push it back," said senior Steve Brada.
The fire was the third grass fire on campus this
week, Swineford said.
Citing the lack of rain, he added, "This looks like
it's going to be one bad summer."
