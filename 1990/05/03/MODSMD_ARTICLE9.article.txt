# Chicano author: 'Reunify' ties
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
With the 500 th anniversary of Columbus' "dis
covery" of the Americas looming in 1992, one na
tional Chicano leader yesterday urged all Chicanos
to rediscover and "reunify" their dual Mexican-
Indian heritage.
"'Que viva Mexicano,' 'Que viva Chicano' — it's
the same cry," said Armando Rend6n, executive
secretary of the Chicano Human Rights Council
and author of "The Chicano Manifesto."
Both ethnic groups are searching for "life, liberty
and sovereignty," he told a small group at El Centro
Chicano.
Rend6n warned against forces "eating away the
self-esteem" of Chicanos by "plastering their murals
with advertisements of the Nina, Pinta and Santa
Maria" — the three ships in which Columbus sailed
to the Americas.
He added that Chicanos must balance the "hype
and hypocrisy" of the Columbus quincentennial by
strengthening their ties with Native Americans and
Mexicans.
The Chicano Human Rights Council, he said,

Chicanos must strengthen their
ties with Native Americans and
Mexicans, a Chicano leader and
author says.

views Chicanos from a "global" scale and is trying
to improve ties between Mexicans and Chicanos.
Rend6n emphasized the importance of the Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo in Mexican-Chicano relations.
The treaty, which was signed in 1848 and ended
the Mexican War, signalled the birth of the Chicano
and reinforced the Chicano's "dual citizenship," he
said. It is essentially a human rights document, and
since its creation it has been used to help protect
the rights of Chicanos and Native Americans.
Rend6n urged Chicanos to become involved in
international law, volunteerism and human rights.
Pointing to the English Only movement as an ex
ample of a human rights violation, he said many
infringements occur because there are no laws
against them.
