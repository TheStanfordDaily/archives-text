ANNOUNCING - AN AUTOGRAPHING BY

AUTHOR OF
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE:
The Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada
A New Routledge Book
"Martin Lipset's deeply intelligent and informed Continental Divide is a fine example
of comparative studies at work, for it sheds much light on Canadian society by examining
American society and equal light on American by examining Canadian. There is no better
proof that he who only his own country knows, knows not his own country. This is proof
by example that nations are best studied in comparative contexts."
- Robin W. Winks, Yale University
"Lipset has revived the finest of the "national character" tradition in the social sci
ences. His analysis is a skillful and elegant blending of the historical, political, cultural, and
social-psychological perspective." - Neil J. Smelser, University of California,
Berkeley
