# Several hundred question cutting

### Michelle Lin 
Hundreds of letters are inun
dating the Provost's Office each
week asking for the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, dor
mitory computer clusters and the
overseas program in Tours to be
spared in the University's budget
cutting efforts.
Since the administration an
nounced which areas of the Uni
versity are subject to cuts,
students and alumni have voiced
their disapproval in letters to
Provost James Rosse. University
deans, who will make budget cut
decisions for individual depart

want people like him to have this
student input before they make
their decisions."

their programs and facilities, ac
cording to Virginia Mak, a CPPC
counselor.

current students have used the
center, Mak added.
"The services provided by the
center were quite influential in
my decision to accept my present
professional position," reads one
letter by an alumnus.
"After surveying the students,
we decided not to cut any parts
of our services, so we're going to
have to reduce fundings for each
area," Mak said. Because there
will be fewer employees, the cen

services, she said.
Another area of student and fac

placement of dorm computer
clusters by centralized, public
computer centers. Three argu
ments recurred consistently in
letters against the elimination of
