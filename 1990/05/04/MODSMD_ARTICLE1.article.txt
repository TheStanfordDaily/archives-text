# Several hundred question cutting
## 
### Michelle Lin 
Hundreds of letters are inun
dating the Provost's Office each
week asking for the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, dor
mitory computer clusters and the
overseas program in Tours to be
spared in the University's budget
cutting efforts.
Since the administration an
nounced which areas of the Uni
versity are subject to cuts,
students and alumni have voiced
their disapproval in letters to
Provost James Rosse. University
deans, who will make budget cut
decisions for individual depart
ments, also receive copies of these
letters, according to Patty Plum
ber, assistant to the provost.
"The letters that we get
definitely do carry some weight
in the decision-making process,"
said Plumber. "Dean (of Student
Affairs James) Lyon3 must get
hundreds of these letters. You'd
want people like him to have this
student input before they make
their decisions."
Proposed cuts at the CPPC —
which constitute 15 percent of its
$1.15 million budget — have been
the subject of more than 300 let
ters in a period of two weeks. The
center will have to lay off some
of its employees and rearrange
their programs and facilities, ac
cording to Virginia Mak, a CPPC
counselor.
Approximately 92 percent of
current students have used the
center, Mak added.
"The services provided by the
center were quite influential in
my decision to accept my present
professional position," reads one
letter by an alumnus.
"After surveying the students,
we decided not to cut any parts
of our services, so we're going to
have to reduce fundings for each
area," Mak said. Because there
will be fewer employees, the cen
ter will develop more self-help
services, she said.
Another area of student and fac
ulty concern is the proposed re
placement of dorm computer
clusters by centralized, public
computer centers. Three argu
ments recurred consistently in
letters against the elimination of
dorm-based clusters.
First, having distant, more
centralized computer centers dis
criminates against students who
cannot afford their own computer.
Second, closure of dorm clusters
contradicts University President
Donald Kennedy's emphasis on
undergraduate education.
And third, round-the-clock
access to nearby computers is es
sential to keeping up with work.
"Without dorm computers
many students will not work on
their papers for 'just one hour,'
but save it all for one sitting to
avoid long waiting periods in the
designated public clusters," ac
cording to one letter.
"I understand that the Univer
sity is cutting programs that they
think are not crucial to academics,
but computer accessibility is a
very important part of any aca
demic program," another letter
states.
A third area targeted for budget

cuts is the overseas program in
Tours, France. If a proposal by
Overseas Studies is accepted, the
Tours program will close in fall
1991.
"It is mind-boggling to hear
that Stanford apparently now con
siders overseas study to be 'non
academic,' and that budget cuts
in the program are therefore 'ac
ceptable,' " according to one
alumnus' letter. "News that the
University intends to cut back its
overseas studies program in gen
eral, and in particular to scrap
the program in Tours, has left me
greatly dismayed with my alma
mater."
Other letters express concern
over a proposed reduction of the
number of free graduate aerobics
classes.
Also, cutting the budgets of
campus libraries has raised much
concern.
"The very life of our humanities
at Stanford depends upon our li
braries," according to one letter.
