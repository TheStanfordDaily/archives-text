Stanford's debate on multiculturalism
has moved to a new forum — television.
On the second episode of "Voice," a
new talk show on X-TV, a panel of
representatives from various campus or
ganizations discussed issues of multi
culturalism with students in the
audience. The episode aired last night
and was taped Monday night in the
Toyon Hall lounge.
Junior Judy Wu, a member of the
Asian American Student Association,
tackled the meaning of multicul
turalism: "Multiculturalism is under
standing, appreciating and respecting
our differences through social and ed
ucational avenues and by institution
alizing it in the University to promote
the cultural activities that go on on
campus," she said.
The part of the discussion which cen
tered on the present and future pros
pects of multiculturalism at Stanford
was especially lively because students
in the audience were able to pose direct
questions at a panel of representatives
of 17 campus organizations.
Panel members included representa
tives from student of color organiza-

ing and respecting our differences through
social and educational avenues and by in
stitutionalizing it in the University to promote
the cultural activities that go on on campus.'

tions, student publications such as The
Daily and The Stanford Review, the
three political student parties, sororities
and fraternities and the Office of Res
idential Education.
One of the mqjor questions addressed
in this episode was how to promote a
more positive attitude toward multicul
turalism. Problems with multicul
turalism, audience members said,
include "that some people feel uncom
fortable with it because they do not
clearly understand its purpose" and that
it "creates feelings of alienation from
some minority group members."
"To appreciate and respect [others],
you have to be willing to be uncomfort-

able," said junior Jay Tucker, a member
of next year's Council of Presidents.
Another topic discussed was whether
the "politicization" of multiculturalism
will contribute to or detract from the
constructive goals of cultural awareness.
Members of the Gay, Lesbian and Bi
sexual Community and Hillel, a Jewish
student organization, said their "cul
tures" needed to be respected along with
other minorities.
"One of the greatest things we do
have in common is our differences,"
said James Assey, a resident assistant
at Donner House.
The episode will be repeated next
Thursday.
