## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Many people may think Independence
Day is the only patriotic holiday in the
United States.
But Chicanos across the country will
prove them wrong tomorrow on "Cinco
De Mayo," a holiday celebrating Mexican
strength and independence.
At Stanford, the Chicano community
has organized a series of activities this
weekend in conjunction with the holiday,
including:
• A concert by de Color Canela, a
Chicana singing group composed of
sophomore Rosaura Sandoval, junior
Anita de Lucio and graduate student
Julie Padilla, today at noon at Tresidder
Union;
• A concert by Dr. Loco's Rockin'
Jalapeno Band and Salsa Caliente, spon
sored by MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, this evening at Tresidder;
and
• Spanish Catholic mass, a poetry

reading, a homemade Mexican dinner,
mariachi music, pinatas and a perform
ance by Ballet Folk6rico, all tomorrow
at Casa Zapata.
"Cinco de Mayo" is traditionally cel
ebrated with food, song, dance, color
and pinatas. But the joyous holiday ac
tually commemorates one of Mexico's
most turbulent eras.
In 1862, with the aid of Mexican con
servatives exiled by President Benito
Juarez, French Emperor Napoleon 111
invaded Mexico.
But on May 5 of that year, a small
group of Mexican soldiers withstood the
bigger and better-equipped French army
in a battle at the rural town of Puebla.
The French were forced to retreat,
and a patriotic celebration of Mexico's
strength under adversity was born.
The French eventually wrested control
of Mexico but withdrew in 1867. Juarez,
one of Mexico's most beloved heroes,
regained power and restored national
sovereignty.
