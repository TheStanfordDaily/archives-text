Nazi goes home for trial
FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) — Four
decades after fleeing to Argentina, alleged Nazi
war criminal Joseph Schwammberger returned
to Germany as a feeble old man yesterday to
face charges in the deaths of thousands of
Jews.
Schwammberger, a former Nazi SS
lieutenant accused of commanding two labor
camps in Poland, was extradited from Argen
tina after losing a 30-month fight against being
returned to Germany.
Officials said he could face trial by the end
of the year. If convicted, he faces a maximum
sentence of life in prison. West Germany has
no death penalty.
The Stuttgart court ordered Schwam
mberger's arrest in 1973. At that time, he was
believed to be in Argentina, where there is a
sizable population of German-speaking immi
grants. Many Nazis fled to South America
following the defeat of Nazi Germany.
Poll tax endangers Tories
LONDON (AP) — Britons voted yesterday
for local councils in the first comprehensive
opinion test since Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, now in deep trouble, won a third
term in 1987.
Voters turned out in relatively large num
bers during the daylong ballot for 201 councils,
spurred by a national controversy over an
unpopular new local tax known as the poll tax.
Opinion polls showed Mrs. Thatcher's Con
servative Party, which has plunged to a record
low of more than 20 points behind the Labor
Party, headed for a drubbing.
The new tax was imposed April 1. Mrs.
Thatcher hoped it would turn voters against
high-spending Labor-controlled authorities.
But instead, most families are paying more
and blaming the government. The tax is also
perceived as unfair because everyone in a dis
trict pays the same, regardless of income.
Soviet fans tear up the town
MOSCOW (AP) — Soccer fans rioted after
a match was canceled in eastern Uzbekistan,
setting fire to buildings, homes and stores
before order was restored, Tass reported yes
terday. At least 34 people were iryured.
Wednesday's violence in the city of Andizhan
began after a game between the local club and
a team from the Centred Asian republic's cap
ital of Tashkent was called off when the visiting
squad defaulted.
The angry fans, many intoxicated, damaged
127 buildings, 79 stores and 36 private homes,
Tass reported. Among the vandalized buildings
were tne city prosecutor's office and the re
gional headquarters of the Uzbek Communist
Party, the news agency said.
Injured were 13 Interior Ministry troops,
10 policemen and 11 civilians, Tass said.
Bulgaria-Israel ties renewed
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Israel and Bulgaria
restored diplomatic relations yesterday after
a 23-year break and signed an economic
cooperation agreement.
Bulgaria and other East bloc countries broke
relations with Israel after the 1967 Six-Day
War, and only Moscow has not restored dip
lomatic ties following the democratic reforms
that have swept Eastern Europe.
Foreign ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and
Boiko Dimitrov of Bulgaria signed a formal
agreement to resume relations, then held a
news conference at the Palace of Culture.
Chinese students get a new DR
BEIJING (AP) — More than 10,000 Beijing
teen-agers are giving up their Saturday after
noons, not really through choice, to learn about
the Communist Party in political study groups
at high schools and universities.
Official media hail the groups as proof of
revived interest in ideology among youngsters.
In fact, many of the students are "volun
teered" by their schools or youth organizations.
Others sign up because showing the right po
litical attitudes can be a shortcut to a leading
university or a good job.
Prehistoric art found in Mexico
TLAXCALA, Mexico (AP) — Specialists ex

years, the government news agency Notimex
