# NATO sets summits after U.S. missile cuts
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -
Spurred by the historic changes sweep
ing Europe, the United States and its
15 Western allies agreed yesterday to
hold NATO and East-West summits

this year to reach a treaty reducing
troops and non-nuclear arms.
The decision was announced after
Secretary of State James Baker 111
briefed NATO foreign ministers on a

new U.S. nuclear missile cutback and
on the need to adapt the alliance to
a lessened Soviet military threat.
NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner reported the alliance's con
sensus to have a summit in London
in early summer and an East-West
summit in Paris by year's end.
"NATO is preparing for the future,"
he said. "The Atlantic alliance is taking
advantage of the historic opportunity
to move from confrontation to coopera
tion."
The sole sour note was an accusation
by Woerner, the former West German
defense minister, that the Soviets were
"foot-dragging" in negotiations to
reduce troops, tanks, artillery and
other non-nuclear forces.
Baker stressed that holding the 35-
nation summit depends on completing
the Conventional Forces in Europe
(CFE) treaty.
"Unless we conclude a CFE agree
ment we should postpone a CSCE sum
mit," he told reporters.
The CSCE, or Conference on Secu
rity and Cooperation in Europe, is
comprised of all the nations of Europe
except Albania, along with the United
States and Canada.
Baker said the negotiations to limit
Soviet troops in Europe to 195,000
and U.S. forces to 225,000 "have not
proceeded as rapidly as we would have
thought."
He said he would have a better grasp
of the situation after meeting with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shev
ardnadze in Bonn today and tomorrow
and again in the Soviet Union in two
weeks.
He also announced, as President
Bush did in Washington, that the
United States would shelve plans to
deploy more powerful Lance short
range nuclear missiles in West Ger
many and would not upgrade nuclear
artillery shells in Europe.
In addition, he offered to accelerate
negotiations with the Soviets to make
cuts in the current stockpile of 1,600
missiles with ranges of up to 300 miles
once the CFE treaty is wrapped up.

The decision to shelve development
of a new Lance missile underscores
the rapid pace of change in East-West
relations. West German Foreign Min
ister Hans-Dietrich Genscher wel
comed the decision, saying it shows
NATO knows how to change with the
times.
In May 1989, the NATO allies agreed
to upgrade the aging Lance missiles.
With those plans now canceled, the
Lance will become obsolete by 1995.
In 1975, the CSCE set a course for
lessening East-West tensions by pro
moting human rights and reducing
military frictions.
Now, with NATO's military mission
rapidly diminishing, the United States
and its allies seek to expand the role
of the 35-nation organization.
"We need a more ambitious agenda
for the CSCE," Baker said.
He suggested such missions as mon
itoring "unusual military activity" and
managing disputes between members.
To prepare for the 35-nation sum
mit, Baker announced he would host
a meeting of all CSCE foreign minis
ters in New York in late September.
He apppealed to the Soviets to speed
up the negotiations on a treaty and
said he was confident Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev "will overcome
this period" of slow progress.
The main obstacles to a treaty are
disputes over limiting airplanes and
helicopters and how to monitor cut
backs.
Woerner said the allies agreed that
a unified Germany would be a member
of the NATO alliance and have no
chemical or nuclear weapons. In a con
cession to Moscow, he said, Soviet
troops could remain in what is now
East Germany for a number of years.
"We have no intention of shifting
the balance to the detriment of the
Soviet Union," he said.
Gorbachev reiterated only last week
his opposition to NATO membership
for a unified Germany, and Shevard
nadze said last month the new Ger
many should be "nonaligned."
