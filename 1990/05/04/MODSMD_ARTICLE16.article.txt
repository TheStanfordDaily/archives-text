RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) — Latvia's
legislature yesterday began debating
whether to declare independence from
the Soviet Union, exhorted by Lithu
anian President Vytautus Landsbergis
to "be strong and have courage."
Landsbergis said he came to the
neighboring Baltic republic "to be with
my brothers." He said Latvians, if they
moved more slowly than Lithuania on
the path to secession, would be "trudg
ing through a jungle."
"I see and feel that Latvia won't
retreat from the principle of indepen
dence," Landsbergis said in separate
remarks to Latvian Radio.
Pro- and anti-independence protest
ers surrounded the Latvian deputies
as they entered the parliament build
ing.
About 50 Soviet Army officers who
live in Latvia gathered with signs pro
claiming, "The People and the Army
are United," and "We Won't Go the
Way of Lithuania."
A few steps away, pro-independence

protesters carried banners saying,
"The Soviet Army Must Go Home,"
and "Independence for Latvia." Pro
testers carried Soviet flags or the red
and-white Latvian flag.
The Latvian Supreme Soviet, or
legislature, debated procedural ques
tions. A vote on independence is likely
today. Lawmakers from the separatist
People's Front predicted they could
muster the two-thirds majority
needed.
The Soviet news agency Tass said
the People's Front and its supporters
controlled 131 of 201 seats in the Lat
vian Supreme Soviet. A two-thirds
minority would be 135 votes.
Anatoly Gorbunov, who was re
elected president of Latvia at the ses
sion, backed independence in a nomi
nation speech.
"I believe that the renewal of a
legally sovereign nation must be ac
complished," he said, declaring it a
"normal way of life for all the residents
of Latvia."

Gorbunov, a 48-year-old former
Communist Party functionary who
has shown himself skilled at negotiat
ing with Moscow, won 153 votes out
of 196 cast.
He warned that the republic could
not expect help from the West.
"The world, on account of 5 million
Baltic people, is not going to risk what
has been done in the area of arms
control and by Mikhail Gorbachev,"
he said.
In Washington, Lithuanian Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said
before a meeting with President Bush
that her republic would be willing to
suspend independence measures op
posed by Moscow if it had Western
guarantees of support for its
sovereignty.
Lithuania is enduring a Kremlin eco
nomic embargo imposed in response
to its independence declaration. Offi
cials of Landsbergis' government said
Thursday that shortages were begin
ning to hit medical supplies.
