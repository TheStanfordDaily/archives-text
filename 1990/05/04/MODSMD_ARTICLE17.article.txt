### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - East
Germany, under pressure from
the West, tried yesterday to find
a way to quickly shift its vast
quantities of state-owned land
and businesses into the private
sector.
Under the ousted socialist sys
tem that ruled for four decades,
the state owned all property.
West Germany has said a quick
conversion to private property
must follow the agreement the
two nations reached Wednesday
on merging their economies.
That agreement came under
heavy fire yesterday from critics
who said it will speed the collapse
of many East German factories
and hurt the poor.
