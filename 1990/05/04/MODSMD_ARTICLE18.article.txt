Lava lays waste
KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) -
People bid aloha to Kalapana yester
day as the town was sealed off be
cause of imminent danger from
Kilauea Volcano's surging sea of lava.
Workers were preparing to move
the historic Star of the Sea Church
to safer ground. The Kalapana Store
and Drive-In cleaned off its shelves
and stopped serving hot foods after
being ordered to close.
The lava flow was headed in a
direct path toward the center of town,
advancing to within 125 yards of the
store and within 250 yards of the
church.
One home burned early yesterday,
bringing to 130 the number

destroyed since Kilauea Volcano
started its present eruption Jan. 3,
1983. Several more were expected to
fall Thursday, civil defense officials
said.
Hate law troubles Simon
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Sen
ate sponsor of the new law to combat
unlawful acts of bigotry said yester
day he was disturbed over reports
that a government hotline has been
rejecting calls from some victims of
such "hate crimes."
"I have heard that people who have
been victimized because of their
sexual orientation or religion have
already been told that the hotline
cannot assist them," Sen. Paul

Simon, D-111., said in a letter to At
torney General Dick Thornburgh.
A spokesman for the Justice De
partment's community relations serv
ice, which operates the hate crimes
hotline, confirmed it does not accept
information about crimes against ho
mosexuals. But he denied it has
turned away victims of crimes based
on religious ties.
The new law requires the govern
ment to compile statistics on crimes
of bigotry and publish them along
with the annual Uniform Crime
Reports.
Hangman stays masked
OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The
identity of Washington's hangman

can be kept secret, a judge ruled yes
terday.
Thurston County Superior Court
Judge Daniel Berschauer found that
disclosure of the man's identity prob
ably would block execution of con
victed triple murderer Charles Rod
man Campbell.
Prison officials believe the ex
ecutioner to be the nation's only qual
ified hangman, and he has made it
clear he will perform the job only if
his identity and hometown are kept
secret, the judge said.
ACLU attorney Stephen Strong
told the court the information is in
the public interest. The state's $1,500
contract with the man says only that
the state would try its best to keep
his name secret, he said.
