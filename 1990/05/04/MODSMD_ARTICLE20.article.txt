NCAA's new proposal
attacks problems
with wrong solution

IT'S THE RIGHT time and the
right problem, but the wrong
solution.
A study commissioned by the
NCAA has recommended that rules
be enacted which would limit a
college athlete's practice time per
week.
More specifically, the rules in
clude limiting athletic-related ac
tivies to 20 hours per week (that
includes jogging, weight training,
etc.), allowing only one practice per
day during the season and limiting
off-season training to eight hours
per week.
According to the NCAA, the pur
pose of the rules is to allow student
athletes to live a "normal college
life."
Unfortunately, the NCAA is at
tacking the problem from the
wrong end.
Instead of looking into problems
dealing with corrupt university
athletic departments and trying to
make substantial changes, the
NCAA is punishing the students,
many of whom are brilliant schol
ars and are quite happy with their
college life.
On the other hand, schools
where few students graduate will
do whatever possible to work
around the new regulations. As

history has proven, some programs
will go to any length to build win
ning teams.
In addtition, much of the burden
from these new rules will be borne
by sports like swimming and gym
nastics. These sports require tre
mendous amounts of practice time
in order to remain competitive.
To lump football, basketball,
gymnastics and swimming to
gether is a mistake that will only
hurt all those involved.
One of the biggest problems is
the provision that states that off
season practice time will be limited
to a maximum of eight hours a
week.
How can we expect Olympic ath
letes to obey these regulations?
Will the result be that they will
choose not to enroll in school at all?
This across-the-board cut is just
not fair.
But the NCAA has a publicity
problem. The public perceives col
lege sports as having lost their ed
ucational component.
The NCAA believes that these
new rules will solve that problem.
In return, however, they will
receive an abundance of enforce
ment difficulties and complaints
for athletes who do not need these
restrictions.
The NCAA has chosen not to go
to the root of the problem â€” a
decision which will save them
much time, money and energy.
They have instead come up with
an unworkable rule which is des
tined to fail.
As the NCAA is fond of saying,
just say no.
