Graduate students need multicultural housing

AS APPLICANTS FOR multicul
tural theme house coordinators
in the Rains Houses, we would
like to express our dismay at David
Chan's letter published April 30. His
opinions exemplify the misunderstand
ings no doubt prevalent in the gradu
ate community here at Stanford.
As it is purported, the multicultural
theme house shall be a place that
unifies minority presence on our
campus. Through its expressed diversi
ty, cultural multiplicity by way of
education, awareness and involvement
of minority and non-minority graduate
students will be cultivated.
The house shall serve as a focal
point in graduate residences that pro
vides a warm and inviting community

environment and provides a central
place for hosting diverse ethnic activi
ties. As an institutional program, the
theme house shall be located in a
permanent graduate housing complex
such as Rains, not in a temporary,
predominantly undergraduate housing
complex such as Manzanita Park.
The United Graduate Student Alli
ance, orginators of the graduate theme
house proposal, envisioned a house
with 50 percent occupancy of minority
and non-minority graduates to have
the highest potential to fulfill the
above-mentioned University goals. We
share UGSA's astute observation and
complaint that The Draw does not
ensure a critical mass of committed
minority graduates who might other-

wise vie for occupation of these spots.
What's more, The Draw fails to
disqualify those not committed to
participating in an expressed multicul
tural environment, non-minority or
otherwise.
In addition to the above problems, it
is not at all clear how residents will be
assigned to the multicultural house
even after The Draw. UGSA's proposal
circumvents these problems. By simply
adding a multicultural housing option
(the selection of which requires the
submission of a theme proposal) to the
graduate housing application, commit
ted graduates can freely choose the
house.
Upholding the aforementioned 50-
percent occupancy premise, fair assign

ments are made based upon proposal
and lottery results. Thus, UGSA's
proposal enables the University to
uphold its commitments both to multi
cultural housing and to fair housing
allocation.
We stand in support of UGSA's
graduate theme house proposal. We
believe students should be able to
choose to live in a community with
those who either share a common
culture or who want to experience
other cultures. CHOICE MUST HAVE
PRECEDENCE OVER CHANCE.
