# Protesters shouldn't blame Law School hiring process
## 
### 
Those who demonstrated on Tuesday
for diversity at Stanford Law School
were right in one respect: the faculty
there, as it is at nearly all such
academies, remains overwhelmingly (27
of 34 tenured positions) comprised of
white males. That is hardly diversified,
and hence the protesters' legitimate
anger: law (and other) schools, most
agree, ultimately need to contain
women and, for want of a better term,
non-whites.
But the demonstrators were dead
wrong in blaming the hiring process at
the school for this lack of diversity.
How, in short, should a hiring decision
be made?
First, virtually all agree that excel
lence in scholarship and classroom
pedagogy are the primary criteria for
selection of a candidate as a professor.
Second, most agree that candidates'

ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation
make no difference in how well they
teach, research and write.
The alternative to this viewpoint is
bigotry; for example, imagine a student
telling you, sotto voce, "I just don't
connect well with this professor. Being
(white/black/male/straight/etc.), (she/he)
just can't teach me as well as someone
more like myself could."
Third, approximately four of every
five persons who seek teaching posi
tions are white males.
Fourth, it follows from the above
three points that a truly non- discrimi
natory hiring process will in fact hire
approximately 80 percent white males,
not more and not less. Stanford's per
centage among the tenured faculty is
79 percent.
In sum, while the protesters and
Harvard Law professor Derrick Bell
attack the hiring process, the problem
lies upstream: only when the percent
age of "diversity" candidates rises — a
successful but slow and ongoing proc
ess today — will the statistical domina
tion of faculties by white males wane.
By way of conclusion, it is remark-

able that so many of the same profes
sors who espouse further controls on
speech at Stanford — Chuck Lawrence,
Barbara Babcock and Babcock's hus
band Thomas Grey, among others —
also join in demands for race and
gender-dependent faculty hiring.
Is there any connection?
