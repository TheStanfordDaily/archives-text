In his May 2 column, Corey Davis
admitted, "I imagine there are a lot of
white people who are wigged out by
the black fraternity and sorority proc
ess." He further confessed, "I suspect
a lot of non-black people see the black
fraternity and sorority pledge process
as ridiculous."
Davis has only one year left at Stan

ford. In that time I hope he is lucky
enough to learn that by making nega
tive assumptions about strangers based
on their skin color, he is prejudging
them in a way that prevents him from
seeing their true stature.
