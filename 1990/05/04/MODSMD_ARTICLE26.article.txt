# Jon Sherman
## Humbled in a small world 
### 
THE MORAL OF today's column is:
be humble or be humbled; it's a
small world, but it's still bigger
than you think.
I'd like to call this story a parable. I
can't because it's true. The protagonist
is, unfortunately, me: Jonathan Turner
Sherman (remember this name, it be
comes important later). But feel no pity
in your heart for me as this story is, like
so many varicolored contraceptives in an
eatery's washroom, for amusement pur
poses only.
Among other things, I write plays, most
of them comedies. In the course of writing
a few scripts, I've found that this is what
I want to do professionally. So, I applied
to the few schools in the country that
offer a master's degree in some form of
dramatic writing. So far, so dull.
Enter into the picture Jonathan Sher
man. Not me, another one. I first heard
of him when my folks told me that they
saw a play on TV by a kid named Jona
than Sherman.
Well, it's certainly a coincidence. I ha
ven't met him, but apparently Jonathan
Marc Sherman is graduating from Ben
nington College this spring. And guess
what he plans on doing next fall?
Yep. Shortly after I sent in my appli
cations I got a note from Columbia Uni
versity with a handwritten scribble at
the bottom: "Jonathan — you are the
second Jonathan Sherman to apply for
playwriting for next fall. Thank heaven
for middle names!"
Yeah, thank heaven. So before I flew
back to Columbia to interview I called

up Yale and New York University and
asked them if I could come take a look
at their programs. Yale told me it would
be moot, as they weren't interested in
me. NYU, however, called and asked me
if I could come in for an interview. I could.
I showed up on a rainy Tuesday after
noon and found my way through a crowd
of artistic people (all wearing black) to
the fourth floor. I, of course, was in a
conservative blue suit. I felt like an in
vestment banker at a mimes convention.
The secretary introduced me around,
"This is Jonathan Sherman." "Oh!
Pleased to meet you, Jonathan," said the
program director, his eyes widening.
I should have known then that I was
doomed. No one ever widens their eyes
when they meet me.
As I waited to speak to the chair, the
director talked to his assistant, glancing
over at me. "You're from?" "Stanford,"
I said. "Connecticut?" "No, California."
"Cali — you came all the way here from
California?" he asked. "Yeah." He leapt
to his filing cabinet, flung it open and
screeched, "Oh my God — there are two
Jonathan Shermans!"
"So this is what it feels like to live in
a Russian novel," I thought.
The chair sat me down in her office.
"Get me his file," she ordered the direc
tor. He did. She skimmed. "Well Jona
than," she said, looking up from my file
and over her glasses, "I'll be straight
with you. We read your stuff and put
you on the borderline . . . but ended up
not taking you. I'm sorry."
"Me too," I thought. "I'm interviewing

at a school that has already rejected me.
I have single-handedly achieved a new
academic low."
Since then I've discovered that the
show by Jonathan Marc on PBS was one
of three plays selected and produced by
the Playwright's Horizons Young
Playwrights Festival in New York. It ran
for 17 days before closing.
When someone who has your name
also has a show that runs off-Broadway,
well, two Gaieties, one One-Act, a Golden
Grant, your grades and Stanford Univer
sity are pretty much spit.
When I got back to campus there was
an envelope from Yale in my PO Box:
"Dear Jonathan, we are pleased to report
that we have successfully reviewed your
financial aid request." I called 'em,
hoping I could make a deal: I'd take their
aid if they'd admit me to their program.
"Sorry, kid," said the assistant.
The other day I ran into my roommate
from last year. I hadn't seen him for
months. "Jon!" he yelled, "I saw your
play on PBS!"
Sheesh.

Jonathan Turner Sherman has gradu
ated with a degree in English. His column
appears every Friday, while Jonathan
Marc Sherman is an accomplished
playwright who would not stoop to write
for The Daily.
