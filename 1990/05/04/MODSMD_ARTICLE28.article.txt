## Tony Burciaga El Cinco de Mayo is as Americano as the Fourth of July 
### 
EL CINCO DE MAYO has always
been such a popular holiday in
Mexico that it is constantly
mistaken for Mexican Independence
Day (which is actually Sept. 16).
El Cinco celebrates a rag-tag
Mexiacn army's victory over French
invaders in a war that Mexico ulti
mately lost. But the significance of
that victory gave Mexico a unity and
pride it has never forgotten — a pride
my Mexican parents brought with them
to this country.
In the United States, El Cinco de
Mayo is growing in importance and
popularity each year. For many
Mexican Americans, it has grown from
childhood memories of eloquent
patriotic speeches and Mexican parades
into a holiday as Americano as the
Fourth of July, Chinese New Year or
St. Patrick's Day.
In part, this is a sign of the growing
popularity of Mexican culture and its
commercialization. But it also reflects
the influx of Latin Americans into this
country and their impact on the Amer
ican way of life.
Through out most of my life I have
found it necessary to state that I was
born, raised and educated in this
country — that for all my dark brown
hair now turning gray, and my persis
tent Spanish accent, I am as all-

American as any New Englander.
Today when people ask "Were you born
in this country?" I answer, "No! I was
born in Texas."
Behind the humor is the pain over
still being treated as a foreigner. There
is a pride in having been born in this
country, and there is a hurt at the
slightest insinuation to the contrary.
But the recent Latin American ar
rivals are changing this. They are
easing the pressures of being a numer
ical minority and giving native-born
Latinos a stronger sense of our identity
and, ironically, a greater appreciation
for living here in the United States.
In downtown Redwood City, Mexican
women in mourning black shawls and
their men wearing distinctively Mic
hoacan hats walk slowly, side by side.
Like characters in a magic realism
novel, they evoke memories of my
childhood trips back to Mexico — of
scenes I once thought only belonged
there.
Today, although I live in a middle
class California, I don't have to travel
far to purchase a votive candle; to find
the ingredients for making mole,
pipian, tamarindo; to visit a curandero
(or folk healer). Mexico is as close as
the neighborhood store — or neighbor.
Yet for most of my life these cul
tural items, scorned by the rest of the

country, were kept hidden. At one
time, I shared them with no one ex
cept family and trusted friends for fear
of ridicule even from my own Mexican-
Americn peers. Wear the right styles,
talk the right jive, change your name
or its pronunciation — negating your
own Mexican heritage was the easist
and quickest way to get ahead.
Today, I find myself jarred to see
and hear Norteno and Ranchera music
by Los Lobos and Linda Ronstadt on
the Johnny Carson Show. This was
once my private music — heard only
on Spanish language radio and televi
sion stations. No one was supposed to
like it except my family and people like
me.
I left my home town along the Rio
Grande many years ago. Now I discov
ered the border has spread past North
ern California to Seattle and was last
sighted in Alaska. On visits to the
East Coast, I see how the Caribbean
now extends from Sao Paulo, Brazil, to
New York City, complete with snow,
Salsa and Merengue. Pride in my
Chicano-ness has been enhanced by the
Cubano, the Puerto-Riqueno and Sal
vadoreno and Oye Chicao, que va!
Through these many recent migrants
from Latin America (not immigrants,
for remember, the border has spread),

I have learned a deeper appreciation of
my self, my culture, my people and my
country. Despite the injustices and
imperfections of life in the United
States, there is hope here, for other
wise they would not come. Exiled from
their homelands by war and poverty,
their trek across the border is the
"American Way of Life."
In 1862, near Publa, Mexico, a poor,

hungry, half-Indian Mexican army
defeated the French, at that time the
most powerful military force on earth.
Their hope and determination is what
El Cinco de Mayo is all about: the
spirit of a people in the throes of
defeat. Que Viva El Cinco de Mayo!
