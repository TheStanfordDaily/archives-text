Building a multicultural Stanford must
be a community concern instead of an eth
nic one, according to a University review
panel which held its first open forum yes
terday.
The panel, established by the University
Committee on Minority Issues, will meet
annually to evaluate the University's prog
ress in implementing the UCMI recommen
dations.
The panel will review a University self
study of Stanford's progress in implement
ing the UCMI recommendations and will
issue an evaluation within four to six
weeks, according to acting Assoc. Affirm

ative Action Officer Judith Little.
Through the forum, held at Annenberg
Auditorium, the panel was seeking com
munity input on what has been accom
plished and what is left to be addressed
for the University to achieve its goal of
multiculturalism.
The 16-member panel — which includes
students, alumni, faculty and administra
tive officials as well as officials from other
universities and national organizations —
will meet with University President Donald
Kennedy today, according to Little.
"The fact that we are here as a panel
.. . does speak very highly of this institu
tion," said Xavier University President
Norman Francis, chair of the panel.
But Francis noted multiculturalism "is

not a task we accomplish overnight. It will
take some time."
In addition, he stressed that the entire
community must work toward multicul
turalism. "Not just one segment of the
institution will accomplish the mission,"
he said.
Francis said the panel's purpose is to
identify "the issues to be addressed right
now," not just to "provide encouragement"
to the community. He added, "We're not
telling Stanford what to do, but we've been
asked to look at what Stanford wishes to
do."
Trustee Bernadine Fong, a panel mem
ber, said the panel's presence "is a signal
that there is commitment" to multicul
turalism at Stanford.

Alumnus Thomas Massey, also a panel
member, said the entire community has to
take risks to achieve its goals "because
everybody gains."
Asked if budget cuts will affect the goals
of the UCMI and the panel, Francis said
he hopes "it does not set back the vision,
delay it or destroy it."
Many institutions around the country
are dealing with issues of multiculturalism
in the face of budget crunches, said panel
member Blandina Cardenas Ramirez, di
rector of the Office of Minority Concerns
of the American Council on Education.
A few students at the forum expressed
concern of a "backlash against multicul-
