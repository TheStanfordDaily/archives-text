# The 						Daily is raided
## Palo Alto Police search offices for evidence 
### 
The Stanford Daily
May 2, 1977
The City of Palo Alto petitioned
the Supreme Court to review the
decision that a police raid on the
offices of The Stanford Daily was
unconstitutional.
Equipped with a search war
rant, four Palo Alto policemen
went through desks, flies and was
tebaskets looking for evidence to
use against participants in a riot
at the Stanford Hospital. This was
the first time in U. S. history
that police had used a warrant to
search a news organization for
evidence.
The argument against the de
cision was that it would curtail
the ability of police and other in
vestigative agencies to gather
evidence against suspects.
The chaos in the Daily offices
and in the Band Shak are
deliberate covers for illegal con
traband and sensitive classified
documents. The police never found
what they wanted. But, neither
has any reporter in Daily history.

The Western Culture task force
met for what was to become the
first of many gatherings in an
attempt to design the best courses
to satisfy DR 1 for students en
tering after fall 1978.
Objectives of the task force, ac
cording to its chair, English Prof.
Ron Rebhoz, were to give students
the "common experience of im
portant and useful documents and
texts in their contexts," to give
students the ability to pursue
courses in their own fields of in
terest which relate to Western
Culture and to provide "excellent
teaching of all courses involved."
A monster is born!! No serious
ly, I really enjoyed those lively lec
tures. Besides learning how to
conquer insomnia without drugs,
I learned some snappy cocktail
conversation material such as: "I
disagree, according to St. Augus
tine you're not supposed to have

a good time. And according to
Dante, you '11 burn in hell for not
having read your Western Culture
books."

Jay Luo, of Boise State Univer
sity, made the Guinness Book of
World Records as the youngest
graduate of an American college.

This was the first
time in U. S. history
that police had used a
warrant to search a
news organization

At 12 years of age, Luo was
scheduled to complete college with
a bachelor's degree in math and
then continue his education in
Stanford's graduate Math Depart
ment.
Luo had entered college when
he was eight years old, after only
two-and-a-half years of grade
school. Once there, he was invited
to join Phi Kappa Phi, a national
honor society.
The only special arrangement
for Luo was that he was not re
quired to teach a class.
Who says kids don't know any
thingl I used to know it all, but
I forgot most of it because of a
non-supportive atmosphere. I'm
sure I'll remember it some day,
but right now I have to pretend I
don't know anything. I laugh at
the kids in my fifth-grade class
who thought they were the
smartest thing since Richard
Nixon or the Bug.
