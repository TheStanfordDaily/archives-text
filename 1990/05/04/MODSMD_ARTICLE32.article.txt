# The
						Bug uncovers the latest dirt about Oscar the Grouch

I hear the University has decided to
bring back the cheerleaders. Gee, how
nifty, more reasons to avoid watching the
game, or maybe more reasons to avoid
attending the game. Don't forget to send
me your questions! Send them to BUG
ME@Macbeth or drop them off in the
box out front of the Daily office.
Dear Bug,
Does Oscar the Grouch from "Sesame
Street" have legs ?
- Mr. Xtra
I spoke with Jim Vadokovich at the
Children'B Television Workshop (CTW) in
Los Angeles. He told me in a monotone
voice, "Oscar has two legs." I was
tempted to ask Jim if he did the voice
for The Count - "Oscar has ONE ...
TWO ... legs! . . .Ala Peanut Butter
Sandwiches!" I also asked Jim if there
was any show where faithful viewers
might have caught a glimpse of Oscar's
legs and he told me, "No, Oscar has never
been out of the trash can." I don't believe
that, how can you stay in a trash can
all your life? Doesn't Oscar ever have to
go to the bathroom? If you've seen Oscar
out of his trash can, let me know.
Dear Bug,
Where did the expression "don't have
a cow" come from?
- Bart Simpson
Karen, who either works in the English
department or was passing through and
made the mistake of picking up the
phone, ran around asking all the available

professors what the origin of this expres
sion might be. Two professors had never
heard of the phrase, (get with it!), and
the chairman of the department said, "it
must be an Americanism." He was
British.
They directed me to the library and
its voluminous texts. I started by looking
up "cow." According to the "Dictionary
of American Slang," this word refers to
"a heavy ungraceful person, especially a
woman," and was first used in the west
in the 19205. Let's make fun of women
in our society, now there's something
new!
The expression "to have a cow" is the
same as "to have kittens." (According to
the same dictionary) It means to "become
nervous, agitated or all hot and bothered"
and first appeared in 1937. (Dictionary
of Slang and Unconventional English)
"Have" refers to giving birth, and to
"have kittens" refers to "a cat's perturba

tion during this crisis." Everybody follow
all that? So in other words, the expression
"don't have a cow" really means "don't
give birth to a heavy ungraceful person,
especially a woman."
Lastly, I gave the Simpsons a call in
Los Angeles and asked if they knew the
origin of this expression. However, I
ended up telling him (whoever "him" was,
let's just call him "Bart") where the ex
pression came from. When I said I wasn't
quite sure how the word "cow" got sub
stituted in for "kittens," Bart told me
he'd be a lot more "hot and bothered"
if he was going to give birth to a cow
instead of kittens.
Dear Bug,
There are some beautiful ramps near
Terman â€¢ very convenient for cyclists.
There are also some extremely beautiful
potted plants. The question is: why are
the potted plants placed in front of the
ramps?
- Puzzled in Potter
It's always a bad sign when the first
person you call says : "I don't know, I
doubt anyone will know the answer to
that question." Facilities, Operations and
Maintenance referred me to the Grounds
Department. Apparently the Grounds De
partment governs everything that sits on
the ground at this campus ... so be
careful where you sit. They told me this:
"the potted plants are placed in front of
the ramps to prevent vehicles from taking
a short cut down into Lomita Mall. In
stead of placing bollards or posts we put
a large potted plant in front of the ramp."
And you thought it was a "Vehicle Ex
clusion Zone."
