### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
After several great perform
ances at the Pacific 10 Conference
Individual Championships and
with the California match looming
in the all-too-near future, the
Stanford men's tennis team could
have easily overlooked Washing
ton.
It didn't. In fact, the Cardinal
played one of its most focused
matches of the year, crunching
the Huskies 9-0 yesterday at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.

"Sometimes you can overlook
matches like this one. I'm glad
we didn't," Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said. "But now we
have a bigger one to think about."
Whitlinger was referring to
today's rematch against California
at 1:30 p.m. in Hellman Tennis
Complex. In their last dual meet
April 11, the Bears handed the
Cardinal its first loss of the
season. Most of the Cardinal
players have been waiting for
their chance to avenge the earlier
defeat.
"Everyone's pretty hungry. The
match we lost here was the first
time Cal had beaten us at home
in a long, long time," team captain
Barry Richards said. "It's always
tough to play [at Hellman Tennis
Complex]. It's windy or something
like that. But we usually compete
well there, and I think we're
ready."
"We want [today's] match really
badly," Glenn Solomon added. "It

wouldn't be the end of the world
if we lost, but we are considering
it like the first round of the
NCAAs."
The recent return of freshman
Jared Palmer definitely will play
to the Cardinal's advantage today.
Palmer, who underwent knee sur
gery after the UCLA match April
6, was unavailable the last time
the two teams met.
Palmer, who reached the semi
finals of the Pac-10 Individuals in
Ojai, Calif, last weekend, contin
ued his successful debut yester
day, simply overpowering
Washington's No. 1 singles player,
Aaron Gross, 6-2, 6-2.
"I'm really surprised with how
fast I'm coming back," Palmer
said. "It usually takes a while to
get that first step back. But I felt
really good out there [yesterday]."
At No. 2 singles, Alex O'Brien
rebounded from a tough first set
to down Washington freshman
Chet Crile 4-6, 6-4, 6-0. The set
Crile won was the only one Stan
ford relinquished the whole
match.

In the doubles, Palmer and Dan
Turbow played two solid sets at
the No. 1 spot in their 6-3, 6-4
win over Gross and Crile.
At No. 2 doubles, Hombrecher
and Cathrall continued their un
defeated streak and moved to 8-0
on the season with a 6-4, 6-2 vic
tory over Brown and Graber.
In perhaps their last match as
Stanford tennis players, seniors
John Connolly and Richards
downed Washington's No. 3 dou
bles team of Grundy and Freeman
7-5, 6-1. "It was good to go out
on a winning note," Richards said,
admitting he felt a bit sentimental
after the match. "It's kind of a
weird feeling — not knowing if
you are going to play competi
tively anymore."
Gould was pleased with yester
day's performance and hopes the
team can keep its momentum
today against California.
"I only am looking for two
things [today]. First, I want to
come out of the match healthy.
Second, I want solid efforts in
singles and doubles."
