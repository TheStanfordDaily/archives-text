# Stanford ace Mussina stymies arm trouble, looks to pros
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Stanford's Mike Mussina would prob
ably be a pretty good pitcher if he could
just figure out how to throw a simple
curveball.
That's right: Tell Mussina — the man
with the golden arm, the pitcher who
could throw a baseball through a steel
wall — to throw a basic curve, and what
do you get? A pitch that quacks all the
way to the plate. No curve, no pop, all
the snap of a wet noodle.
No, seriously. Mussina, who has been
clocked at 94 mph on his fastball and
who, as a junior, will most likely be taken
early in the first round of next month's
major-league draft, can not throw a curve.
What gives? "I never had a good cur
veball," Mussina says."I could never
hook it (with my fingers), and throw it.
I never could do it, just because I never
learned.
"I was a sophomore in high school and
I said 'I've gotta come up with something
else or I'm gonna get rocked, I don't care
how hard I throw,' " Mussina says."And
I came up with this, and it works well
for me."
"This" is a wicked beast called the
knuckle-curve, which Mussina developed,
we 11... by mistake. "I goofed around
with it, and started using it sophomore
year," Mussina says."It wasn't difficult
for me to learn, because I just came up
with it somehow."
The knuckle-curve is thrown with a
normal motion — right over the top of
the shoulder — except, while he brings
the ball around, Mussina is holding it
with his fingertips. Then, just as he re
leases the ball, Mussina flicks his index
and middle fingers — and watches batters
go nuts.
"I just started throwing the ball the
way I was throwing it, and it went
zzzzzzt," Mussina says as his hand marks
off the trail of the craziest curve you've
ever seen. "I said 'Hey! How'd I do that?'
And I just kept throwing it and throwing
it and throwing it until I got pretty good
at it."

The knuckler does more than drive
hitters crazy, though: It actually saves
wear and tear on Mussina's arm. "There's
no strain on my elbow, because I don't
have to twist my wrist or anything to
throw it," Mussina says."I throw it just
like a fastball, except my fingernails are
stuck in the ball. Over the top and let
it fly, and just throw out my fingers
when I get to that point."
Hey, if it works it works. And, since
the knuckler is so effective, Mussina has
absolutely no need of the conventional
curve. Every now and then, though, he's
tempted.
"Every once in a while I'll be in the
pen and I'll say 'Okay, let's try a regular
one this time,' " Mussina says,"and it

just goes Udlldld-ump!" (Mussina's hand
does a swell impression of a wounded
duck.) "It's flat and it's ugly, usually."
He shrugs. "I'll dance with what
brought me."
That's not a bad idea, considering that
the knuckle-curve (not to mention his
hit-it-if-you-can fastball) has brought him
to the brink of the leagues. Mus
sina, who is 10-3 this season with 79
strikeouts and 30 walks in 103 innings,
has had scouts making fools out of them
selves over him for the last four years.
This season, every time Mussina has
pitched, legions of radar-gun-toting
scouts have shown up to check him out.
It's been a lot like his senior year of high
school, when Mussina was constantly
hounded by folks wanting to get him to
skip college and head right for the pros.
There's a tiny difference this time
around, though. "It was worse then [in
high school]," Mussina says."In high
school, they (the scouts) think they have
more attraction: 'Wow, the majors! Let's
go! Pick me, I'll go! Pick me, I'll go!' "
Not that it mattered: "I had decided
in my mind in early February, that I was
coming here," Mussina says.
Not everyone got the picture, however.
"There were a couple guys who were like
'We'll bring in our general manager, we'll
bring in our .. .' and I just said 'Look,
fellas, I'm sorry! This is my best move
and I'm gonna stick with it.' "
Three years, one national title, one
1988 second-team Freshman All-America
wasn't m any rush to get back into the
flow, however. "When I got up in the pen
for the first time, I thought 'Just take
it easy, and if you feel anything, you're
gonna get off of here, because it's not
worth it.' That's my occupation."
Mussina actually pitched in an in
trasquad game several weeks ahead of
schedule, and finished the fall with about
as many innings pitched as he would
have in a "normal" year. The morning
after his first outing — he pitched two
innings because Jamie Sepeda, who had
been slated to throw, was at a class —
he woke up, felt his elbow, and the world
was a great place to be.
"'lt's a little sore, but I'm okay!' " Mus
sina says. "After that, I was convinced."
The scouts, however, still had to be
shown. "That was the big question from
everyone in January," Mussina says.
"'Have you had elbow trouble, have you
had elbow trouble?'. . . I've proved to

myself, and I should have proved to them
too, that it hasn't caused me any prob
lems."
Apparently everyone is convinced, be
cause Mussina is projected to be a high
first-round pick in next month's draft.
Of course, he doesn't think about it that
much. Not at all.
No more than, say, the average child
thinks about Christmas morning when
he goes to bed the night before.
"I think about it all the time," he says.
"I think about it and the fact that I have
to get my schoolwork done, 'cause if I
don't get it done I can't finish." If — if?
— he's picked, Mussina will return to
Stanford in the fall to finish up work on
his degree. Yes, that means he'll be grad
uating early.
Where Mussina will end up is anyone's
guess, but he does have a preference. "I'd
love to play back East," he says."It just
so happens that the first eight picks of
the draft are in the eastern half of the
country — except for Seattle, which is
seventh."
Gee, you don't have the draft order
memorized, do you, Mike? "I think I
know the first eight," he laughs, then
pauses. "Maybe ten."
It's almost time. "I want to play bad,"
Mussina says. "Not that I don't like it
here, 'cause I love it here."
award, one 1990 first-team preseason All-
America honor and a lot of fun later, it
appears that best move has paid off. Ex
cept for one disaster, Mussina has had
a spectacular collegiate career.
That one disaster, however — a
strained tendon in his throwing elbow,
suffered early last season at California
— turned one season into a nightmare
and, for the first time, brought doubt
into a lot of people's minds as to whether
Mussina would indeed be able to make
it to the majors.
Ironically, the iryury happened during
a game that was one of the greatest of
Mussina's life. At Cal on Feb. 24, Mussina
had the Bears flailing away all afternoon,
striking out 12 and giving up two (count
'em) hits. "So many things happened at
Berkeley," Mussina says. "Two-hit
shutout, I remember (Eric) DeOraw in
center field diving to catch a ball that
was going in the gap, I remember Frank
(Carey) knocking down a one-hop rocket
for a double play . .. That's the best game
I've thrown."
And, physically speaking, it was also
the worst — at least in terms of the
damage it caused. "I don't recall that it
happened all of a sudden, that something
went Wham!' on me," Mussina says."I
was cruising along pretty well, and I had
no problems, and then in the seventh or
eighth inning I'd throw a pitch and I'd
kind of feel something stretching.
"That happens sometimes, and then
you don't feel it again," Mussina says.
"Then I was all right and I threw a

couple more, and all of a sudden there
it was again. I was going This isn't right,
but I'm not coming out because I've got
a two-hit shutout!' I kept going — I
didn't slow down, I didn't lose any
velocity and I was still throwing fairly
well."
Mussina wrapped his elbow in ice after
the game as a precaution, but the damage
had already been done. "The next day I
got up and I had about a 15-degree bend
in my elbow that I couldn't straighten
out, so I'm going This is definitely
wrong,' " Mussina says."I let it go a day
and I didn't say anything, and the next
day it was about the same. I went up to
Jim (Liukkonen, the team trainer) and
said 'Jim, it's been two days. I did some
thing pretty bad to my elbow, I think.' "
Liukkonen took Mussina to have the
elbow examined, and the initial diagnosis
was muscle damage. No big deal, a couple

of weeks off, get him right back out there.
Not quite. "I took two weeks off, and
I still couldn't throw," Mussina says."I
could play a lot of catch, and my elbow
was pretty straight, but if I even stood
on the mound and tried to throw it down
any grade at the catcher, my elbow just
pinched. I said 'Something's up,' so we
went back to the doctor."
This time, the doctor said possible ten
don damage. "He said that right where
the tendon connects to the elbow, I might
have had a slight tear," Mussina says."I
said 'Well, what are we talking here?
Another month?' and he said with ten
dons you can never tell."
The phrases "arm ir\jury" and "you
can never tell" are straight from a
pitcher's nightmare, and it's a nightmare
Mussina lived through for the next six
