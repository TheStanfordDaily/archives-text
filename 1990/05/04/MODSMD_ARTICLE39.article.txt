# Palumbis garners Cardinal's QB job
## 
### Debbie Spander Editorial staff 
Denny Green is a man of his
word.
After stating that he would
select a starting quarterback by
the close of spring practice,
Stanford's second-year head
football coach has done just
that â€” ahead of schedule.
Green announced that senior
Jason Palumbis will begin the
fall as the Cardinal's No. 1
signal-caller. Sophomore John
Lynch is currenly listed as
back-up quarterback, and
Steve Smith is No. 3 on the
depth chart.
"Jason is out in front at the
quarterback position," Green
said. "I'm sure everyone feels
he has made great progress and
generally played well the entire
spring."
Palumbis, a native of Lake
Oswego, Ore., is returning
from surgery on his right
shoulder. Injured since high
school, he didn't realize the
severity of his condition until
last season and underwent
arthroscopic surgery in the off
season. Both Palumbis and the
coaching staff are elated about
his progress.
"I didn't know quite what to
expect coming into spring ball.
I was hoping that after surgery
my shoulder would hold up and
I would be number one at the
end of spring, but you never
know," Palumbis said.
"After his operation his arm
strenth and capabilites have
stood out," Green added.
Palumbis, after redshirting
as a true freshman, stepped in
as Stanford's leading quarter
back the fifth game of his first
season of eligibility. Starting
the remainder of the Cardinal's
contests, he threw for 1,569
yards, going 128-of-228 and

throwing for eight touchdowns.
He did not play last season.
Both Smith and Lynch saw
action last year. Smith com
pleted 150 of 270 passes for
1,502 yards and seven
tougchdowns, while the true
freshman Lynch stepped in and
contributed 7-of-14 for 45
yards. Both are looking for
playing time.
"I'm more comfortable and
confident out there, and I have
more confidence in terms of
where I'm throwing,"
Palumbis said, "But 1 still have
alot of work to do. The job is
not clearly mine. There's con
stant competition with Steve
and John."
Green and his staff also se
lected a tentative backfield
lineup from the dearth of talent
Stanford now posseses. Fifth
year senior Jon Volpe will
return to the starting spot at
fullback after missing almost
all of last season due to knee
injuries. The 1988 All-Pacific
10 Conference player, who
rushed for 1,027 yards in '88,
is followed by junior Tommy
Vardell and Miami transfer
Ellery Roberts.
Much heralded Oklahoma
transfer Glyn Milburn is the
No. 1 tailback. Milburn rushed
for 124 yards on only eight
carries and scored a touchdown
his freshman season with the
Sooners.
"Glyn and Ellery have really
helped out the running game,
and we already had some great
talent," Palumbis said. "Our
running game is a lot more
proficient, which is only going
to help the pass out."
Spring ball culminates Sat
urday, Mayl2 with the Red and
White Scrimmage, the tradi
tional intra-squad game. The
Cardinal opens its season Sept.
6 at Colorado.
