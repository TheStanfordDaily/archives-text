# Justice Dept. launches Round 2
## Stanford to comply with request for more information 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The Department of Justice has
requested additional information
from Stanford in a second round
of its investigation of antitrust
violations among mqjor univer
sities.
The latest demand from the de
partment requests information
about Stanford's policy on setting
tuition from 1979 to 1984.

This request
follows on the
heels of the more
comprehensive
one received by
Stanford and
other universities
last year for in
formation about
tuition, faculty
salaries and fi-

nancial aid from 1985 to 1989.
In its investigation, the Justice

Department is examining the pol
icies of mtyor universities in these
three areas to determine if there
has been any collusion or price
fixing in violation of federal anti
trust laws.
According to University Gen
eral Counsel John Schwartz,
Stanford will comply with the
demand within the "next few
weeks."
