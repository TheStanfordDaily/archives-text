# Justice Dept. launches Round 2
## Stanford to comply with request for more information 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The Department of Justice has
requested additional information
from Stanford in a second round
of its investigation of antitrust
violations among mqjor univer
sities.
The latest demand from the de
partment requests information
about Stanford's policy on setting
tuition from 1979 to 1984.

This request
follows on the
heels of the more
comprehensive
one received by
Stanford and
other universities
last year for in
formation about
tuition, faculty
salaries and fi-

nancial aid from 1985 to 1989.
In its investigation, the Justice

Department is examining the pol
icies of mtyor universities in these
three areas to determine if there
has been any collusion or price
fixing in violation of federal anti
trust laws.
According to University Gen
eral Counsel John Schwartz,
Stanford will comply with the
demand within the "next few
weeks."

While the response to the initial
request required Stanford to pres
ent tens of thousands of pages of
documents — "enough to fill 23
boxes" — Schwartz said he
believes the number of documents
involved in the second request will
be smaller.
"There are probably fewer doc
uments the further back you go,"

he said. In addition, the demand
only asks for information on tui
tion.
Schwartz noted a number of
other universities besides Stan
ford have received the second re
quest, including some of the Ivy
League universities. However,
fewer schools were sent the second
request, he said.
The Justice Department has not
officially announced any findings
in its investigation, he said. How
ever, he does not anticipate that
the department will discover any

violations in financial aid or fac
ulty salaries at Stanford.
If the Justice Department does
find any wrongdoing, it will prob
ably ask the universities to change
their policies, Schwartz said. The
department would probably not
file a lawsuit unless a university
refused to agree to its demands,
he added.
In these cases, "the Justice De
partment is more interested in
getting people to stop" any
wrongdoing, rather than imposing
penalties, Schwartz said.
