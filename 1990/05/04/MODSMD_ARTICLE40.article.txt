# Track tunes up for NCAAs at Modesto
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
From the beginning, Stanford
identified the focal points of the
track and field season to be Big
Meet against California and the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships. With one of these in the
past, Stanford can now concen
trate its efforts on the postseason
meet.
For many team members, last
Saturday's Big Meet was their
final competition of the year.
These athletes have not posted
the spectacular numbers of their
better-known peers, but they
nevertheless have contributed sig
nificantly to the team's success
this season. A number of team
members have commented on the
chemistry of the 1989-90 squad,
saying that the comraderie has
been tremendous.
After last Saturday's emotional
loss, that team spirit has only
been strengthened, and the
remaining active team members
face the last month of the season
with renewed vigor.
Tomorrow's Modesto Relays
will feature runners, jumpers and
throwers from a number of West
ern teams representing several
conferences. In addition, the meet
will showcase some individuals
like long-jumper Mike Powell, the
1988 Olympic Bronze Medal win
ner, to enhance the level of com-

petition.
For the Cardinal, "Modesto is
basically a weigh station on the
road to the Pac-10s," in the words
of Coach Brooks Johnson. "In the
next two weeks, we are going to
try to spot people to qualify for
the postseason meets. Our main
thrust tomorrow is for the
NCAAs," he said.
Johnson cited three athletes
who will gun for NCAA marks
tomorrow. Junior Dave Strang
will try to trim his current best
of 1:47.83 in the 800-meters by
.08 seconds to qualify for nation
als.
Senior distancer Eric Mastalir
hopes to join teammate Bill
Crowley in the NCAAs by lower
ing his 1,500-meter time by about
three seconds. And Chryste
Gaines, the sophomore sprinter,
will try to double her duties in
that meet by outrunning the qual
ifying mark of 23.28 seconds in
the 200.
All three of these athletes will
probably achieve their goals to
morrow.
"We did very well at Cal, and
our confidence is up," Johnson
said.
