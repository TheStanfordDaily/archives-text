# McGrath volleys Cardinal to victories
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Ever since she picked up a ten
nis racket, Meredith McGrath has
been rushing toward the net. All
the while, she was on the fast
track to the professional tour and
she figured the shortest distance
there was through the serve and
the volley.
This time last year McGrath
took a detour on the road to the
Women's International Tennis As
sociation. She decided to maintain
her amateur status and try her
hand at the college game.
Upon her arrival here, McGrath
was baptized as "Crime Dog," a
reference to the cartoon character
McGruff of public service an
nouncement fame. And, though
she hasn't taken a bite out of
crime, McGrath has certainly
sunk her teeth into NCAA tennis.
All this for someone who
"didn't think I was hungry
enough" to play professionally
after graduating from high school.
McGrath's decision was by no
means an easy one. Coach Frank
Brennan says on one side of the
equation was the United States
Tennis Association pushing her to
play for pay. Then there was
McGrath's coach and mentor back
in Midland, Mich., Glen William,
who encouraged her to attend
Stanford.
"I spent twice as much time
talking to him as I did to
Meredith," Brennan says. He adds
that when she decided to follow
William's advice, "The people
from the USTA told her it was
the biggest mistake she'd ever
made."
For her own part, McGrath was
not convinced she was mature
enough to go out and earn a living
at 18. "It was never really a big
decision for me ... to go to col
lege." And how has it worked out
so far? "No question. I'm happy
with my decision."
While her serve and volley game
was already remarkably polished,
McGrath felt she needed to work
on her play at the baseline to be
successful. One area that was cer
tainly not a concern, though, was
confidence. McGrath's already
possesses an abundance of that.
On the court, she seems to
know she is going to win. "I have
an edge over a lot of the people
here — probably all the people
here — just because I've played
so many international and pro
tournaments," she says. "When it
gets down to the wire, I'm usually
going to be a little bit tougher
than the next person.
"You can have all the confidence
you want, but you've still got to
go out there and win it. I need
to have confidence to play the
style of game I play If I'm the
least bit tentative, I can get
walked all over."
Her attitude will carry her far
in the event she decides to bolt
the college ranks this year.
"Everybody thinks I'm leaving,"
she says. "People knew I was
leaving back in September. Every
body knows what I'm doing before
I seem to do it.
"There's rumor flying all over
the country about if I'm even
going to finish the year. It's just
silly," McGrath adds.
Regardless, her teammates are
resigned to the fact that McGrath
will not be back next year.
McGrath is Teri Whitlinger's new
doubles partner now that Teri's
sister Tami is on the tour. Last
week, she spoke wistfully about
having to find her third partner
in three years come 1991.
Freshman Heather Willens
noted that the team's easy vic
tories can become a bit tiresome
and that next year will hopefully
be more exciting without Lisa
Green, who is a graduating senior,
and McGrath.
At the Virginia Slims of Indian
Wells, Calif, in February,

McGrath was the last player to
qualify for the tournament and
little was expected of her. All she
did was reach the quarterfinals,
beating the world's llth-ranked
player, Jana Novotna, along the
way.
McGrath was pleased with her
results but not overly impressed.
"I knew I could beat people like
that before I went to the tourna
ment," she says.
When the event was over,
McGrath resumed her life as col
lege freshman on the nation's best
team. Now, she is the nation's
top-ranked player. Teammate
Sandra Birch, who held the No.
1 spot most of the season, has
suffered a few losses recently and
allowed McGrath to move up in
the national poll.
But not in the lineup. Brennan
rarely juggles the positions of his
players, especially in midseason.
"It's not her fault she's playing
behind the defending NCAA
champion," Brennan says of
McGrath. Realistically, the coach
adds, there was little chance for
her play No. 1 singles.
"The door was bolted," he says.
"She beat on it as hard as she
could." Still it did not open and
McGrath doesn't really have trou
ble with that.
"This late in the season, it prob

ably wouldn't be a good move to
flip-flop us .. . I'm not saying I
should be flip-flopped," McGrath
explains. "It'd probably be worse
for the team. I can live with play
ing No. 2 for one more tourna
ment."
Especially because she almost
never loses. McGrath's only defeat
in dual-match play this season
came at the hands of California's
Jean-Marie Lozano. Other than
that, McGrath hasn't been
touched.
In the past month she has had
a habit of falling behind early and
making the spectacular comeback.
"I should never be in those situ
ations," a self-effacing McGrath
says. "It's almost like I want to
get down because I like the chal
lenge of having to come back.
That's so stupid to do."
But that is never a problem for
McGrath in doubles, in which she
and Whitlinger have posted a per
fect record this year and made
themselves odds-on favorites at

'I don't care what
people expect me to
do.'
— Meredith McGrath

NCAAs. "I don't care what people
expect me to do," she says.
"I expect us to win the doubles,
but I'm not putting a tremendous
amount of pressure on us. Teri
and I want to get our picture up
in that room (where all Stanford's
NCAA champions are pictured at
the stadium)."
Even if they don't, Brennan
says McGrath will have given
something to Whitlinger. "She's
done wonders for Teri," he says.
"She's been Teri's personal guru
without even knowing it."
Brennan explains that Whit
linger has traditionally subscribed
to "the good groundstroke beats
the good volley" theory. She
believed "you lose the point when
you come to the net," he says.
Practicing and playing with
McGrath, Whitlinger has learned
how dangerous the good volley can
be.
McGrath says if she had to give
up playing tennis, she would be
a teacher. Though a successful
stint on the pro tour looms ahead,
maybe what she has done for
Whiltinger shows that McGrath
has already gotten a good start
on another career as well.
