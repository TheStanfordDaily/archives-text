# Crew tangles with Bears in 'Big Row'
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Nobody really knows what will happen when Stan
ford and the University of California meet in a
sporting event. The Bay Area sports annals are
filled with famous Stanford vs. California upsets
and blow-outs, sometimes neither being expected.
Tomorrow's crew race should provide more of the
same.
"The Cal dual is always an exciting dual, and we
seem to trade wins with each other quite often,"
women's crew Coach John Davis said. "[The women's
team] is really tough this year, they are really
moving."
As are the California men. Having improved
"drastically" from last year, according to Stanford
men's captain Andy Winden, California has thus far
dominated the Cardinal varsity, beating them by
ten seconds the last time they met. With an improved
start, the Cardinal hopes things will be different
this time around.
"We have a really good start right now, we hope
to break their confidence by staying with them after
1000 meters," Winden said.
Winden also put it into laymen's terms.
"They are Bears, they are weenies, and therefore
they are mentally unstable," the senior said.
Unstable perhaps, but good rowers. California
sent two men to the World University Games in
Germany this summer, and possess more size than
the Cardinal. California might be mocked by Stan
ford, but as contradictory as it may seem, they do
get some respect.
"They are a good crew," Winden said. "They are
big strong guys, bigger than us. They had more
guys rowing over the summer, and that makes a
difference."
In order to counter some of this size and strength,
men's Coach Ken Dryfuss has switched up the line
up, hoping for better chemistry. In order to achieve
this, Dryfuss has moved up three people from the
J.V. boat. Senior matt Dalva has taken over stroke
duties, co-captain Tom Beischer is now in the third
seat, and Steve Voorhis is the new occupant of the
six seat. Junior Pete Dominick is also back at the
varsity coxswain.
"The problem was that the varsity boat was not
beating the J.V.'s consistently in practice. We
thought we could get more speed by shaking up
the boat a little," Winden said.
The move helps to highlight the talent in the J.V.
boat, winners of their last three races. The J.V boat
is capable of post-season honors, and California
should provide a good indication of their chances.
"The J.V. is doing very well — they have to be
considered contenders for the Pac-10 title this year,"
Winden said. "(However) the Cal J.V. is the team
to beat."
