# Bone marrow donor campaign launched
## 
### Heidi Durrow 
To reach a large source of potential bone
marrow donors, a University group has
launched a public awareness campaign aimed
particularly toward people of color at Stanford.
Because the National Bone Marrow Registry
contains only about 112,000 potential donors'
names, more donors are always needed to
provide marrow for people with leukemia and
other fatal diseases, according to medical stu
dent Dan Hackner, a member of the Stanford
Medical Students' Ethics Learning Forum.
And of those potential donors, only a very
small percentage are minorities. Donors of the
same ethnicity as the receiver offer the best
chance for a match of bone marrow types,
Hackner said.
The group of medical students hopes to
increase "justice and equity in health care"
by finding more minority donors, he said.
Hackner gave the example of Allison Atlas,
a woman of Lithuanian Jewish descent, who
has yet to find a donor with matching marrow
type.
"There are amazing odds against finding a
[bone marrow] match if you're a minority,"
said Hackner, who estimated the odds at
20,000 to 1 for Atlas.

However, "Leukemia is an equal opportu
nity disease," he quipped. "White people are
just as susceptible ... and matches are still
hard to find."
Donating marrow is not as difficult or pain
ful as it may sound, Hackner noted. "Tissue
typing," the first step in the process, is free,
confidential and completely painless to blood
donors by appointment at the Stanford Med
ical School Blood Bank, he said.
After the potential donor's eligibility is con
firmed by laboratory tests, the actual donation
procedure can be performed. It is a one-hour
operation under anesthetic, during which 3
to 5 percent of a donor's marrow is withdrawn
from the hip bones.
The procedure involves little risk and only
slight discomfort that lasts a few days, Hack
ner explained.
The group's objective is "to increase aware
ness for donating at large regardless of eth
nicity," he said.
However, the group is focusing the drive at
Stanford in the minority communities. It has
contacted ethnic theme houses about making
presentations to students, Hackner said.
Fliers distributed around campus yesterday
also specifically mention the need for an ethni-

cally diverse sampling of potential donors, said
Hackner.
The group would especially like to encourage
the Asian-American community to register
since "they have, by numbers, an ability to
make a difference," according to Hackner.
Other student of color groups on campus do
not comprise as large a portion of the student
body.
Despite the minimal pain involved — like
a "bad bruise" — it is "an easy way to make
a contribution," according to Judy Ocken, a
Palo Alto caterer.
After the death of a close friend who had
suffered from breast cancer, Ocken said she
had "a feeling of impotence." But after dis
covering that marrow transplants are being
used to treat breast cancer, Ocken said she
decided to become a donor.
She wrote to the leukemia patient who re
ceived a donation from her, but the patient
has since died, she said.
"It may not have worked," said Ocken, "but
it was her only chance."
Ocken and Hackner urged others to become
donors. "It's [the patients'l last chance, and
it's very little coming from you," said Ocken.
"I'd do it again," she added.
