## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
The need for a broader support network for
women in medicine and the medical sciences has
led to the creation of the Program for Women in
Medicine.
The School of Medicine will inaugurate the pro
gram with a conference tomorrow featuring
speakers, workshops and panel discussions on issues
facing women in medicine and the medical sciences.
Although members of the program will be mainly
medical students, graduate students, faculty and
alumnae, workshops to introduce high school stu
dents and undergraduates to female role models in
medicine will be among the program's regular fea
tures.

"At Stanford there are not many women profes
sors in the biology core or the chemistry core, so
it is a great opportunity to see women role models
in medicine," said junior Jill Banatoski, a pre-med
biological sciences m^jor.
Celia Moreno, a psychiatrist at Counseling and
Psychological Services who will speak tomorrow at
the conference, also cited the lack of mentors or
role models as a problem facing women students.
"Role models serve as a way to learn," Moreno
said. Although women are prominent in fields such
as pediatrics and gynecology, many other areas
remain male-dominated.
The second mtyor problem women face, according
to Moreno, is "how to tackle all the different roles
and expectations" — for example,
family and career. Several por
tions of tomorrow's conference
will address such issues.
Dr. Dora Goldstein, professor of
pharmacology, will also speak on
historical perspectives of women
in medicine. "Today, the status of
women in medical schools is better
than it was 150 years ago. But
it's not necessarily better than it
was 20 years ago," she said.
Progress has been slow in get
ting women professors and phy
sicians into medical schools, said
Goldstein. At present, about 30
percent of Stanford's medical stu
dents and staff are women, and
two departments are headed by
women.
