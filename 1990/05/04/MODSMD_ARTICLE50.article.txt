Statues get facelift
The Rodin Sculpture Garden
got a makeover Wednesday
morning by some creative
beauticians, most likely UC-
Berkeley students.
Eleven blue and gold sculp
tures were found by a museum
guard Wednesday at 6:45 a.m.,
according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"'Cal,' 'Go Bears' and other
Berkeley epithets" were in
scribed on the statues, proba
bly after 1 a.m. Wednesday,
Niemeyer said.
Fortunately, the vandals
used water-based paint which
was quickly washed off.
Niemeyer said he suspected
the vandals, "who did a pretty
thorough job," were probably
gearing up for this weekend's
Stanford-Cal baseball game.
No suspects have been iden
tified, although the culprits did
leave a paint brush behind for
the police.
"We're trying to get prints
off the paint brush, but it's
really difficult," Niemeyer said.
This is the second time in
two years the statues have been
the object of Cal pranksters.
The last time, vandals used oil
based spray paint which was
more difficult to remove.

Computers still down
Everything is cool again at
Meyer Library and the Law
School, but the heat is still on
at the Center for Educational
Research at Stanford and
Sweet Hall.
The four buildings all
regained air conditioning and
water service yesterday after a
pipeline in a central cooling sys
tem burst Wednesday.
However, CERAS and Sweet
Hall computer systems, which

had to be turned off because
of heat, are not fully opera
tional again.
Currently, all systems are op
erating except the Portia sys
tem, which is experiencing
"disk problems," according to
Rob Snevely, a computer infor
mation specialist at Academic
Information Resources.
Service to the system is ex
pected to be reinstated this af
ternoon, he said.
The Macßeth system, the
Unix system on the second
floor of Sweet Hall, the Watson
and Oberon systems and Portia
had been shut down Wednes
day.
People who wish to use Por
tia can access it on computers
at the work station on the sec
ond floor of Sweet Hall,
Snevely advised.
People can call AIR today at
725-7887 to find out if Portia
is operating again.
