# Faculty offer differing views of SCLC proposal
## 
### Rob Baedeker Staff writer 
A mixture of support and disapproval
marked the Faculty Senate's discussion of
the Student Conduct Legislative Council's
proposed interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard yesterday.
Although the proposal was not an item
for senate action, members voiced their
opinions on the interpretation. The period
for commentary on the proposal ends today.
The proposed interpretation would out
law discriminatory "fighting words" as a
violation of the Fundamental Standard.
Law Prof. Robert Rabin, SCLC chair,
said he believes the proposal "strikes a
balance" between freedom of speech and
protection of individual rights. Rabin
refuted several frequent criticisms of the
proposal, including the charge that the pro
posed interpretation would have a "chilling
effect on free speech."
He said the proposed interpretation
would not be any worse than the "overly
broad and vague" existing Fundamental
Standard.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther opposed the
interpretation, explaining that although he
approves of it as a symbolic gesture against
racial epithets, he has great doubts about
its value as a matter of policy.
Gunther cited a similar policy that was
implemented at the University of Michigan
where "most of the people punished were
minorities" and an atmosphere of "thought
control and a quasi-fascist regime"
prevailed.
Law Prof. William Cohen said adoption
of the proposal would send out the wrong
message â€” namely, that the University's
"level of civility of discourse has
deteriorated." He criticized the ambiguity
of the proposal, which takes "an entire
newspaper page" to make its point.
Cohen said there is already an under
standing that the University has a policy
against discrimination and racism.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips voiced

support for the proposal, explaining that
although the SCLC interpretation may con
flict with the Constitution, the present
Fundamental Standard contradicts it, too.
Since people come to Stanford by choice,
he said, they therefore choose to promote
respect of others' ideas, one of the Uni
versity's ideals.
Other discussion focused on some per
ceived ambiguities in the interpretation,
specifically whether it would punish at
tacks on mEuority groups, such as whites,
in addition to attacks on minorities.
Cohen said the actual text of the proposal
did not clarify that uncertainty,
but the commentaries following it
did.
Some faculty members ques
tioned whether last year's incident
at Ujamaa House, where a racially
offensive poster was pinned to a
students' door, would be punish

able under the SCLC's interpre
tation. Rabin said that, although
the incident did not involve
speech, it was a direct vilification
of an individual and would there
fore have been punishable.
However, Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, author of the proposal, told
The Daily last spring that a case
like the one at Ujamaa would fall
"on the borderline on almost
every issue" when interpreted un
der the proposed standard.
