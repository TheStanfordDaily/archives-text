# Fac Sen examines the non-teaching
## 
### Rob Baedeker Staff writer 
The validity of non-tenure-line fac
ulty appointments was the focus of yes
terday's Faculty Senate discussion on
the recommendations of the Commit
tee on the Professoriate.
In an unofficial vote, the senate
defeated a proposal that would prohibit
farther appointments of associate pro
fessors of research, who do not teach,
and would phase out current appoint
ments through attrition or promotion.
Many senators expressed concern
over the "parallel line" to the existing
tenure track â€” one that enables re
searchers to attain full professorships
without teaching.
Currently, up to 10 percent of faculty
appointments may be made for non
tenure-line positions. Such positions
are for faculty who either research
or teach, but not both.
David Korn, dean of the School
of Medicine, said he opposes the
current system, explaining that
there is a "problem with the [cor
respondence] between the experi
ence of an individual and the rank
available to that individual."
Others voiced support for the
existing system. Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Ewart Thomas
said there are costs and benefits

to the present system, but the
rewards outweigh the drawbacks.
He said while there is a danger
of the system being misused as a
career path, the University does
have "people for whom this title
(associate professor (research)) is
precisely the right rank."
But Provost James Rosse urged
the senate to eliminate non
tenure-line research positions,
saying, "Appointments to the
University should combine teach
ing and research."
In related votes, the senate un
officially approved a proposal to
retain the rank of "professor
(research)" and to evaluate any

form of teaching done by non
tenure research faculty by the
same procedures used for tenure
line faculty.
The senate also approved a pro
posal recommending researchers
receive additional salary for any
teaching contributions.
The senate voted against pro
posed additions of sabbatical leave
and early retirement plans to the
benefits available to professors
(research).
In other senate business, Rosse
announced plans for reviews of
the progress on the University
Committee on Minority Issues'
recommendations.
