Center to explore
immigrant education
Lewis Butler, president of
the lobbying organization Cal
ifornia Tomorrow, met last
week with a few Stanford stu
dents to determine how to shift
the focus of the upcoming state
election to the changing
demographics of the state.
Butler, a 1951 graduate of
Stanford Law School, sugges
ted Thursday that students or
ganize rallies and letter-writing
campaigns, among other activ
ities, to raise more awareness
to the shifting needs of the
state because of an increasingly
large ethnic minority popula
tion.
In an interview with The
Daily, Butler pointed out that
California is a "majority mi
nority" state, meaning that a
majority of the people living in
the state are considered to be
ethnic minorities. One in five
is an immigrant, he said.
"There are a lot of cultural
and racial gaps in our society,"
Butler said.
One program to help bridge
those gaps is being started at
Stanford. Butler has worked
with the School of Education
to found the Center for Im
migrant Education. A few
scholars from the Education
School will be the backbone of
the center.
"Stanford has tried to get
these issues out in the open,"
Butler said, citing the Western
Culture and multiculturalism
debates.
California Tomorrow has

many ties to Stanford. Not only
have many Stanford graduates
worked for the organization,
but University President
Donald Kennedy is on the
group's board of advisers. "It
is completely infiltrated by
Stanford in some way or an
other," Butler joked.
California Tomorrow is
looking for people interested in
starting a yearlong fellowship
in June. Fellows will be respon
sible for doing research, publi
cation and grassroots organiz
ing. California Tomorrow also
wants to find unpaid summer
interns. For more information,
