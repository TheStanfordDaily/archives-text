# Mills College-Stanford ties may see changes

An Oakland women's college whose trustees
last week voted to turn the school co-ed has
a history of exchanges with Stanford that
may be affected by the admission of males to
the college.
Trustees at Mills College voted last week
to end 138 years of single-sex tradition at the
private liberal arts school and to admit male
undergraduates starting in the fall of 1991.
The decision, announced Thursday by Mills
President Mary Metz, may affect various for
mal and informal social and academic ex
changes offered between Mills and Stanford
— but because the situation is so unsettled,
no one is sure exactly how.
Sixty to 70 percent of the student body is
protesting the decision in a barricade of the
central campus buildings, according to fresh
man Denise Washington of the Associated Stu
dents of Mills College press committee.
The women's arms, clad in bands of yellow
and black, respectively signifying solidarity
and mourning, are linked in an effort to deny
administrators and faculty access to the build

ings, she said.
"The decision is devastating to us," Wash
ington said. "After so many years of tradition
it's like a slap in the face, and we feel betrayed.
[The decision is] like a breach of contract
because we were promised four years of a
single-sex school."
The decision to admit men was caused by
the school's financial deficit and low enroll
ment, currently 777 students. The fierce re
action by students, faculty and alumnae to
the decision has incited discussion concerning
the grading procedure for the remaining two
weeks of the semester and whether the Mills
Alumnae Association will finance a coed in
stitution.
The msyority of the faculty, which is 51
percent female, and 90 percent of the alumnae
are in favor of maintaining the school's single
sex status, Washington said.
"The general feeling is of sadness, shock
and dismay," said Alumnae Association Pres
ident Muffy Thorne.
The association provided $4.4 million in
financial assistance to Mills last year. Funds
are currently being directed toward support
of the students' protest, the pursuit of legal

action against the decision and the solicitation
of politicians and celebrities to speak out
against it.
According to Yuri Mok, associate alumnae
director, Mills and Stanford have a tradition
of formal and informal social and academic
exchanges dating back at least to the 19305.
The schools provided transportation for the
students to formal dances and informal get
togethers at both campuses, sponsored by
dorms and academic departments.
In the early part of this century, she said,
when the enrollment of women at Stanford
was limited, it was common for Stanford men
to marry Mills women.
A structured academic opportunity for Mills
students, called the 3/2 Engineering Program,
allows students to earn a liberal arts degree
after three years at Mills and an engineering
degree after two more years at Stanford.
Mills has had a "strong connection to Stan
ford marked by regular and enthusiastic ex
changes between the schools," Mok said.
"However, I think today women are seeking
more academic, career-oriented interaction
like the 3/2 Engineering Program" rather than
social interaction.
