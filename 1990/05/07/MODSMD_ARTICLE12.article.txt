## Saving environment key to our survival

"The 21st century will be
known as the century of the en
vironment. If we lose the environ
ment, we will have lost
everything," said William Penn
Mott, former National Park Serv
ice director, this weekend in
Kresge Auditorium.
Mott was the keynote speaker
at the Native Forests of the Amer
icas Conference, sponsored by the
Santa Clara Valley Audubon So
ciety, Stanford's Center for Con
servation Biology and more than
40 other organizations.
"If we can put a man on the
moon and energize the world to
strive for peace instead of war,
we can save our environment,"
Mott said. "We must be an exam
ple to the world; we have wealth,
technological know-how and re
search."
Mott urged conservationists to
unite to protect and preserve the

environment.
"We are not going to be able to
protect our environment unless
we are together," Mott said.
"Together we can conquer our ob
jectives."
By the year 2000, 90 percent
of our country's population will
live in cities, according to Mott.
He said more emphasis needs to
be placed on educating
metropolitan people about envi
ronmental concerns.
"We face the awesome respon
sibility of educating the genera
tion emerging to recognize
environmental concerns and their
responsibility of preserving and
protecting the environment to
hand over to future generations,"
Mott said.
To stop the disintegration of our
environment will cost money and
change — a change in lifestyle,
manner of using resources,
priorities and thinking from
short-term goals to long-term
ones, he said.
