# ASSU sit-in nearly squashed by police
## Protest slated to end tomorrow night

The ASSU election protest
ers survived a brief scare Fri
day night as two police squad
cars showed up to take them
away.
The protesters have been
peacefully occupying the ASSU
offices for one and a half weeks
in protest of the decision made
by Steve Krauss, ASSU elec
tions commissioner, to not
count write-in votes.
A Tresidder Union employee
called Stanford Police Friday
night when the protesters said
they would continue to occupy
the office. "He didn't look hap
py," said Chaparral editor Vic
tor Payan, who was one of the
protesting students.
Two squad cars showed up,
but the police agreed not to
haul the students out of the

office on two conditions: that
they not leave the doors open
and that they limit the protest
to three or four students.
Then came the dilemma.
Should the students bow to the
demands and appear spineless,
or should they get kicked out,
ending their protest, and still
look spineless?
On the one hand, they could
get credit for not giving up
their protest at the hands of
the police. On the other hand,
the students could go home,
sleep well and take showers.
Weary from many long days of
playing Trivial Pursuit and
watching film festivals of "The
Simpsons," the protesters
decided not to give up.
They plan to stay until to
morrow night, when the ASSU
Senate is expected to certify the
election, making it impossible
for a COP runoff to occur.
