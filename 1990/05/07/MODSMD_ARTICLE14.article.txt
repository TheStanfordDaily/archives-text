Mandela issues warning
SOWETO, South Africa (AP) — African Na
tional Congress leader Nelson Mandela said
yesterday that black-white negotiations cannot
succeed until the government abandons its
insistence on special privileges and protections
for whites.
Mandela, addressing a mostly black crowd
of 50,000 at a soccer stadium, said last week's
groundbreaking talks between his African Na
tional Congress and the white-led government
were successful.
But he said the government's demand of
special "group rights" for whites and other
minorities is unacceptable to the ANC, the
country's most powerful opposition group.

hour flight from Rome. His special Alitalia
747 jet had the Mexican and Vatican flags
waving from its cockpit as it taxied down the
runway.
"I come as a herald of faith and peace, in

from Yucatan to Baja California."

owned by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, who died
