EAST BERLIN (AP) - East Ger
mans voted in their first free local
elections yesterday, choosing a city
councilman from West Germany as
mayor of their second-largest city,
early projections showed.
The conservative party of Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere captured
the most local government seats, fol
lowed by the left-leaning Social Dem
ocrats, according to projections by
West Germany's ARD television.
The reformed Communist Party,
now called the Party of Democratic
Socialism, was finishing a distant
third.
Hinrich Lehmann-Grube, a city
council member from the West Ger
man city of Hannover, ran for mayor
of Leipzig, and television projections
indicated he was the winner.
Lehmann-Grube had adopted East
German citizenship last month and
was living part-time in Leipzig. It was
not clear whether he would resign his
Hannover post.
The parties' performances generally
reflected the results of the March 18
national elections, when East Ger
many's first democratic government
was elected.
However, de Maiziere's Christian
Democrats took only about 34 percent
of the vote in local races, according to
the ARD projections, compared to the
41 percent they gained in the March
balloting.
Local issues dominated individual
races, so it was unclear if any dissat
isfaction with the rush to unite the
two Germanys was a factor in the

races.
The Social Democrats were holding
much the same total as in the national
elections, and the Christian Demo
crats' losses appeared to have been
distributed among a group of small,
specialized parties.
The Social Democrats, howevr, cap
tured the two largest cities, East Ber
lin and Leipzig, the ARD projections
showed.
Yesterday's turnout was about 80
percent, short of the 93 percent who
voted in the March elections.
About 250,000 people from 62 par
ties ran for more than 20,000 councils
and municipal posts in 7,784 cities,
districts, towns and villages. About
12.4 million East Germans were eli
gible to vote.
The local balloting effectively gives
local communities control of their
hometown governments and
bureaucracies after four decades of
centralized Communist control.
Far-right groups were kept off the
ballots and foreigners for the first time
were allowed to take part. Radicals
plastered leaflets across the country
during the night calling for an election
boycott.
The balloting followed widespread
clashes in East Berlin the night before
between right-wing radicals and
foreign workers. Eight people were re
ported arrested and five were injured.
The elections likely were the last
for East Germany as a sovereign state.
Unification with West Germany is ex
pected to be completed next year.
