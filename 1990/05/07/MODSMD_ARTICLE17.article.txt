# Latvians prepare for Soviet economic blockade

RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) — Latvian pol
iticians said yesterday they were steel
ing themselves for strikes, protests
and an economic blockade now that
the Kremlin has reportedly rejected
their declaration of independence.
The Baltic republic's president,
meanwhile, appealed for the Kremlin
to open talks on independence instead
of "just threatening with blockades."
The televised address came a day
after Latvia's Communist Party chief,
Alfreds Rubiks, quoted Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev as telling him
he could not accept Latvia's secession
and may impose sanctions.
"We understand the situation in Lat
via will be very tough, even critical,
this summer," said Peteris Lakis, one
of the leaders of the Latvian People's
Front, which engineered Friday's dec

laration.
Also yesterday, Pope John Paul II
urged the three Baltic republics —
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — to
negotiate with Moscow in their efforts
to gain independence.
The Polish-born pope said the rights
of the republics must be balanced
against the damage that Gorbachev's
policies of economic and political
liberalization could suffer.
"Things must be resolved by a
dialogue, but by an effective dialogue,"
the pope told reporters on a flight
from Rome to Mexico. "One cannot go
beyond this at this time."
Anatoly Alexeyev, head of the Inter
front Movement of non-Latvian resi
dents, predicted the Soviets would
start an economic blockade soon.
Alexeyev, a prominent opponent of

secession, said a labor group repre
senting about 140,000 workers has
called a general strike for May 15 to
protest the declaration of indepen
dence.
Neighboring Lithuania declared in
dependence March 11, and Gorbachev
responded by sending Soviet troops to
seize some buildings and by imposing
economic sanctions, including an oil
and natural gas embargo.
Last month Estonia announced its
intention to secede but stopped short
of declaring independence and set no
date for leaving the Soviet Union. The
Kremlin has imposed no sanctions on
Estonia.
The Soviet Union forcibly annexed
the Baltic republics in 1940. They
began campaigning for independence
shortly after Gorbachev began his re

forms, and he has offered them a
greater say in economic and political
decisions but not secession itself.
The televised address by Anatoly
Gorbunov, Latvia's president, ap
peared designed to reassure Latvians
as well as carry a message to the Krem
lin.
"Let's begin by hearing out others'
opinions and comparing arguments
and not just threatening with block
ades and clinging to the old," Gor
bunov said.
As he left the Latvian TV studio
where he taped the address yesterday,
Gorbunov said he had not been in
contact with Gorbachev.
"I'll call him tomorrow and present
once more the essence of our declara
tion and our future intentions," he
said.
