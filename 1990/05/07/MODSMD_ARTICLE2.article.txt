# Dating details differ for gays and lesbians
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
Stanford students are fond of
complaining about the difficulty
of finding a date. But for one
group of students — those who
are gay — dating can be even
more complicated.

According to gay and lesbian
Stanford students, dating is dif
ferent for them in everything
from finding a date to showing
affection. But different doesn't al
ways mean more difficult.
Jake Veylupek, a gay sopho
more, said gay and lesbian stu
dents at Stanford can go to the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com

munity Center to meet each other.
"Heterosexuals don't have any
counterpart to that. The whole
world is a straight place, but there
is no place that really deals with
the issue of sexuality."
Veylupek emphasized that the
pool of students he can date is
much smaller than for heterosex
ual students. He said, "I'm prob
ably not going to end up going
out with the guy across the hall.
That's probably more of the case
with straights."
He also listed several places gay
students can go to meet each
other: gay parties, gay bars and
"gay skate night," held at a local
roller rink. Other students men
tioned support groups and the
quarterly dances sponsored by the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford as places to meet other gay
students.
Another widely used method of
meeting gay students is through
the electronic mail system.
Charles Goldman, a student at the
Graduate School of Business, said,

"I make most of my contacts
electronically. I have dated half a
dozen men I've met through gay
computer dating services, includ
ing a guy I'm dating very
seriously right now."
The computer dating services
charge a few cents per minute,
and they allow gay people to con
tact each other with greatly
reduced social pressure. "It en
couraged me to take more social
risks than I would face to face.
The consequences are much less.
It solves the toughest problem
about gay dating — figuring out
who's gay," Goldman said.
According to Toni Long, a les
bian sophomore, the electronic
mail system is used by gay women
as well.
While there is some crossover
between the places gay men meet
each other and the places lesbians
meet, lesbians have some re
sources that are only for women.
Ann Chang, a graduate student
in computer science, said "the
people in organized activities are
a very small percentage of lesbians
at Stanford." She said some stu
dents used the Graduate Women's
Network and the Women's Center
as places to meet other women.
Another difference is that AIDS

is not an issue in the lesbian com
munity, while it is something
every male couple has to deal
with, according to Veylupek.
The fact that many gay students
are not publicly candid about their
sexual orientation further compli
cates the dating process.
"A lot of gay people are in the
closet, and that makes them even
more invisible," Long said.
"Closeted dating makes for some
very interesting dynamics."
Once two gay students have met
each other, dates are sometimes
amusing, sometimes uncomfort
able, and sometimes even painful,
according to several students.
David Cruz, a graduate student,
said people often assume he and
his boyfriend are roommates when
they are on dates. Veylupek men
tioned that he's been in situations
where he's dated his "ex's ex," in
what he called one of the "bizarre
love triangles that couldn't hap
pen with heterosexuals."
Other students mentioned the
lack of social guidance in deciding
who will pay the check or lead on
the dance floor.
But often gay students who
show their affection in public find
difficulty on dates. Students de
scribed intense pressure not to
hold hands or walk arm-in-arm
in public, and some of those who
have done so reported being called
"fags" or "dykes" and being
pointed at.

Veylupek said gay couples rec
ognize that "public displays of af
fection make others
uncomfortable or angry." But
others emphasized that the same
actions that infuriate some
heterosexuals would not even be
noticed if they were done by a
man and a woman.
Another way dating is different
for gay and lesbian students is
that because most of them do not
"come out of the closet" until at
least their 20s, many lack the so
cial skills heterosexual students
usually pick up in their pre-teen
and teenage years.
Chris Hayes, a senior in physics
and political science, said, "I
didn't date at all until I came out
at 22, although I did take women
to prom and the Viennese Ball. I
feel somewhat like a teenager. I
haven't dated very much at all."
Despite the differences in meet
ing and dating, many of the dates
students described are activities
done by heterosexuals.
Long said, "Some people say
that same-sex dating and same
sex unions are easier to maintain
because of the familiarity with the
modes of behavior — the likes
and dislikes of the same sex.
"But it's just as difficult. Just
because you have the same body
parts, it doesn't mean you're the
same person. Dealing with some
body one on one is a difficult thing
to do."

same person. Dealing with some
body one on one is a difficult thing
to do."
Stanford students are fond of
complaining about the difficulty
of finding a date. But for one
group of students — those who
are gay — dating can be even
more complicated.

According to gay and lesbian
Stanford students, dating is dif
ferent for them in everything
from finding a date to showing
affection. But different doesn't al
ways mean more difficult.
Jake Veylupek, a gay sopho
more, said gay and lesbian stu
dents at Stanford can go to the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com

munity Center to meet each other.
"Heterosexuals don't have any
counterpart to that. The whole
world is a straight place, but there
is no place that really deals with
the issue of sexuality."
Veylupek emphasized that the
pool of students he can date is
much smaller than for heterosex
ual students. He said, "I'm prob
ably not going to end up going
out with the guy across the hall.
That's probably more of the case
with straights."
He also listed several places gay
students can go to meet each
other: gay parties, gay bars and
"gay skate night," held at a local
roller rink. Other students men
tioned support groups and the
quarterly dances sponsored by the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford as places to meet other gay
students.
Another widely used method of
meeting gay students is through
the electronic mail system.
Charles Goldman, a student at the
Graduate School of Business, said,

"I make most of my contacts
electronically. I have dated half a
dozen men I've met through gay
computer dating services, includ
ing a guy I'm dating very
seriously right now."
The computer dating services
charge a few cents per minute,
and they allow gay people to con
tact each other with greatly
reduced social pressure. "It en
couraged me to take more social
risks than I would face to face.
The consequences are much less.
It solves the toughest problem
about gay dating — figuring out
who's gay," Goldman said.
According to Toni Long, a les
bian sophomore, the electronic
mail system is used by gay women
as well.
While there is some crossover
between the places gay men meet
each other and the places lesbians
meet, lesbians have some re
sources that are only for women.
Ann Chang, a graduate student
in computer science, said "the
people in organized activities are
a very small percentage of lesbians
at Stanford." She said some stu
dents used the Graduate Women's
Network and the Women's Center
as places to meet other women.
Another difference is that AIDS

is not an issue in the lesbian com
munity, while it is something
every male couple has to deal
with, according to Veylupek.
The fact that many gay students
are not publicly candid about their
sexual orientation further compli
cates the dating process.
"A lot of gay people are in the
closet, and that makes them even
more invisible," Long said.
"Closeted dating makes for some
very interesting dynamics."
Once two gay students have met
each other, dates are sometimes
amusing, sometimes uncomfort
able, and sometimes even painful,
according to several students.
David Cruz, a graduate student,
said people often assume he and
his boyfriend are roommates when
they are on dates. Veylupek men
tioned that he's been in situations
where he's dated his "ex's ex," in
what he called one of the "bizarre
love triangles that couldn't hap
pen with heterosexuals."
Other students mentioned the
lack of social guidance in deciding
who will pay the check or lead on
the dance floor.
But often gay students who
show their affection in public find
difficulty on dates. Students de
scribed intense pressure not to
hold hands or walk arm-in-arm
in public, and some of those who
have done so reported being called
"fags" or "dykes" and being
pointed at.

Veylupek said gay couples rec
ognize that "public displays of af
fection make others
uncomfortable or angry." But
others emphasized that the same
actions that infuriate some
heterosexuals would not even be
noticed if they were done by a
man and a woman.
Another way dating is different
for gay and lesbian students is
that because most of them do not
"come out of the closet" until at
least their 20s, many lack the so
cial skills heterosexual students
usually pick up in their pre-teen
and teenage years.
Chris Hayes, a senior in physics
and political science, said, "I
didn't date at all until I came out
at 22, although I did take women
to prom and the Viennese Ball. I
feel somewhat like a teenager. I
haven't dated very much at all."
Despite the differences in meet
ing and dating, many of the dates
students described are activities
done by heterosexuals.
Long said, "Some people say
that same-sex dating and same
sex unions are easier to maintain
because of the familiarity with the
modes of behavior — the likes
and dislikes of the same sex.
"But it's just as difficult. Just
because you have the same body
parts, it doesn't mean you're the
same person. Dealing with some
body one on one is a difficult thing
to do."
