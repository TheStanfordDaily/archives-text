Stanford students are fond of
complaining about the difficulty
of finding a date. But for one
group of students — those who
are gay — dating can be even

pool of students he can date is
much smaller than for heterosex

out with the guy across the hall.

with straights."
He also listed several places gay
students can go to meet each
other: gay parties, gay bars and
"gay skate night," held at a local
roller rink. Other students men

quarterly dances sponsored by the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
