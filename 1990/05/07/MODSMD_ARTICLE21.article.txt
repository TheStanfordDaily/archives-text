## Celebrating love 
### 
GALA Week brings
an opportunity to
gain understanding

PINK TRIANGLES once sym
bolized oppression — now
they symbolize love.
And for the rest of Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week, students will
be seeing a lot of them.
For what supporters tout as the
most eventful GALA week ever,
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center has sold out of
the buttons displaying the pink tri
angle, which indicate support for
the rights of people regardless of
sexual orientation.
Hopefully, this is a sign that the
Stanford community realizes that
civil rights and liberties are dis
tributed along.a slippery slope:
once a rationale exists for denying
a group fundamental freedoms,
other organizations can be dis
enfranchised and encroached upon
as well.
Discrimination against lesbians,
gays and bisexuals is all too real,
both on campus and beyond. Un
like racism, however, heterosexism
is considered both acceptable and
desirable by many people.
And even when heterosexism is
recognized as sheer prejudice, it
often gets played down.
Two years ago, in the most pro
minent example of this prejudice
in Stanford's recent history, a gay

resident assistant was continually
harassed by a heterosexist resident
of his dorm. Later, the resident
was evicted from University
housing.
A subsequent protest by some
members of the community evoked
images of the Ku Klux Klan and
provoked widespread concern
about the rights of people of color
at Stanford.
But in coming to grips with that
issue, most ignored the origins of
the protest itself. Few mentioned
the RA or his rights to be free
from prejudice in his own home.
This past week, several GALA
Week fliers were taken down and
thrown out shortly after they were
first posted, while others were sim
ply torn to shreds.
With a wide array of planned
programming, from theatrical
events to panel discussions to pic
nics, GALA Week will give stu
dents, faculty and staff a prime
opportunity to examine their own
perspectives and feelings on sexual
orientation.
It will also provide a forum for
discussion with both gays and
straights about their beliefs.
Finally, GALA Week would be
an appropriate time to for the Uni
versity to make a renewed com
mitment to the needs of lesbians,
gays and bisexuals.
By providing graduate housing
for eligible gay couples and begin
ning to implement the recommen
dations of a recent report on the
needs of lesbian students, Stanford
can prove that it truly respects
and desires diversity.
