Cheerleaders will increase enthusiasm, support

I AM WRITING to address several
points raised during the current
debate about the prospect of adding
cheerleaders. The source of funds for
the cheerleaders would come from the
allocation for the Stanford Band and
the dollies. There is no intent or way
to add the cheerleaders through in
cremental funding unless there are
specific donations for that purpose
only.
The Band and dollies will still
receive departmental funding, ASSU
special fee funding and some support
through fund-raising efforts. The
sharing of funds allocated for these
support activities is appropriate, as the
Band and the dollies do not consider
themselves to be spirit or rally-oriented
instead of their self-proclaimed role as
"entertainers."
A second point of contention has

been the perception that we wish
somehow to copy the support groups of
USC. I find their goose-stepping,
pseudo-militaristic band as ridiculous
as ours, but at the other extreme.
Our Band, however, does know more
than one song. We have asked someone
from the National Cheerleading Associ
ation to help a bit at the outset; he
happens to have been an undergradu
ate at USC, which I guess is the
genesis of the Trojan-North rumors.
The most important point to address
is the reason for wanting cheerleaders.
It is not because alumni are demand
ing them. It is because we would like
to build an environment of fun, excite
ment and support for the students who
are participating in the football game.
We know we can cheer in Maples
Pavilion or Burnham Pavilion when
they are sold-out and a event is

taking place, such as the NCAA Wom
en's Basketball West Regionals or the
Stanford vs. USC men's volleyball
game. Both scenes were awesome in
terms of crowd support for the ath
letes.
But it is a lot harder at Stanford
Stadium. The venue is vast, and the
game is across the track, quite a dis
tance from the stands. In an average
crowd of 50,000 to 55,000 people, less
than 10 percent of the crowd is Stan
ford students. We would like some help
in organizing some noise, call and
response cheers, etc. Not high school
or stunt-type stuff ... just organized
support for the athletes.
As to the point about alumni, I have
observed that students eventually
become alumni. When that happens,
separation from the University does
not occur, but the relationship contin-

ues and the interest in Stanford re
mains, along with opinions about how
things should be done, and often, a
desire to remain involved with some
aspect of University activities.
This support is the heart and soul of
the survival and maintenance of a
vigorous intercollegiate athletic pro
gram at the University. If we can help
the team, create enthusiasm and have
some fun together, the crowds at the
games will swell, revenues will increase
and we can reinstate some of the
activities we have had to curtail.
Coach Denny Green and his players
believe cheerleaders can help, and I am
in full, enthusiastic support of this
addition to the student activities of
fered by the Department of Athletics.
