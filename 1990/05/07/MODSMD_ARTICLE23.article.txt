# Cheerleaders set up to promote Stanford
## 
### 
The reestablishment of the Stanford
cheerleaders is not a self-serving proj
ect. The squad is being set up for one
and only one reason: to promote Stan
ford. The Department of Athletics* cuts
will affect us all, and we will all suffer
because of them. The department had
no choice, however — its deficit is too
great to be able to keep everything as
is.
We, as students, can apparently do
nothing and are expected to just live
with it. The cheerleaders refuse to just
live with it. We want to make a differ
ence. We do not want future students
to have to endure the kind of severe
cuts that were made this year. The
only way to do that is to raise more
funds for Stanford athletics.
In the May 2 Daily editorial "Not all

right now," some extremely untrue,
unfair statements were made regarding
the cheerleaders. First, we challenge
the editors of The Daily to come up
with their own "better way to spur
spirited cheering."
As long as sports have been in exis
tence, there has been a need for organ
ized leaders to promote cheers. When
fans are yelling "Branner Sucks" or
"Toyon Rules" at the top of their
lungs, it's obvious they are excited
about something. All that needs to be
done is to get everyone together.
The figures given in the editorial are
completely incorrect, also. The editors
seem to think that "tens of thousands
of dollars" will be spent on cheerlead
ing. Unless you know something the
Department of Athletics doesn't, your
numbers are completely inaccurate. Get
real — what do you think, we're going
to buy an official cheerleaders' BMW?
Now, we would like to address one
of the most offensive, sexist remarks

that has ever been printed in The Dai
ly. How can you call cheerleading a
"nonsport?" Has any member of the
editorial board ever been a cheerleader?
In no other sport, and cheering is, in
fact, a recognized sport, do the mem
bers have to keep performing at the
same high level of intensity for a
longer period of time without a break.
As for the alumni "dictating" the
department's spending, you obviously
have not been awake for the past nine
fWades. Athletics are funded primarily
by alumni donations and ticket sales.
Why wouldn't the Department of Ath
letics try to satisfy the alumni?
The cheerleaders want to help all of
the sports at Stanford by encouraging
students, faculty and, yes, alumni to
attend sports events and to support the
department with donations.
The final ignorant, unfounded com
ment we wish to address is the entire
tangent regarding the USC consultant.
Obviously, the editorial staff cannot

separate the input of a consultant
from that of a dictator.
As for the "encroachment on the
activities of existing student groups,"
the budget for next year is exactly the
same as it was originally planned. The
squad has some funding from the de
partment, but this funding is not
keeping other student groups from
functioning.
The entire purpose of the squad,
however, is to raise funds for the de
partment. We require a little funding
now (however, NOT anywhere near
"tens of thousands of dollars"), but the
future years will be better for all.
We're proud of our university, and
we're proud of our friends and peers
who work to make it what it is. We
want to make it better, so we're actu
ally doing something about it, instead
of bashing other students' efforts.
