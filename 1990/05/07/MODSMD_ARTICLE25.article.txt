## School should reflect life

be done with law school. Prof.
Janet Cooper will finish telling us
about habeas corpus; we'll clap; she'll
exit and we'll follow her.
Thursday, May 10, at 3:05, I'll be done
with school: no more notes; no more
classes. My father said he's going to quit
his night job.
In August, I'll go to work. I'll probably
even have to wear pantyhose. After 20
years of formal schooling, I'll go to work.
It hasn't been such a bad 20 years. In
second grade, I led my class on strike —
in solidarity with the professional base
ball players. They called my mother in
as the strikebreaker.
In 19th grade, I took labor law and
learned that we had been engaged in an
illegal secondary boycott. Thank God the
school only called my mother instead of
the National Labor Relations Board.
Of course, it hasn't been a perfect 20
years. I got dizzy doing somersaults and
cartwheels in seventh grade gymnastics.
I even fell off the balance beam — for
tunately it was only four inches off the
ground. I got dizzy doing microeconomics
in 14th grade; now I can't even balance
my checkbook without going to an auto
matic teller machine.
In 20 years, I got a lot of things stuck
in my head: "i" before "e" except after
"c" (except for neighbor); you don't have
any heirs (and heirs) until you're dead;
and bicyclists have a hard time reading
the word "stop" against a red octagonal
background.
In 20 years, I learned one thing above
all others: Beryl Taylor was right.

Now, for those of you who don't know
Beryl, she was my high school journalism
teacher. She taught me to love newsprint.
She also spoke at my high school grad
uation, and just before the diplomas were
handed out she said: "There's so much
more I'd like to teach you, but I guess
I'll leave that to life."
Life is a good teacher. And I sense that
Beryl knew that her own life experience
and the portion of it she could share
with us were only part of the curriculum.
Life experiences inform what we know
about theory and doctrine and all of those
other things that seem to first appear to
us as words on a page. Life experiences
bring a sense of urgency to what we do
with our theory and doctrine.
At Stanford Law School, life experi
ences and a sense of urgency brought
many of us to the front of the school
Tuesday to ask that our life experiences
be reflected — even just a little — in the
composition of the faculty. Life had
taught us — men and women of color,
women, gays and lesbians — lessons of
exclusion and marginalization.
Life had taught us that in many parts
of the curriculum there was a life
experience-teacher dichotomy. So we did
a little agitating. Fortunately, my mother
was in Seattle, so no one could call her
in.
If the impression is that some of us
aren't satisfied with the faculty compo
sition at Stanford Law School, the im
pression is right. If the impression is
that some of us aren't fully satisfied with
the education we've received at Stanford
Law School, the impression is right.

If the impression is that we aren't
satisfied at all with the faculty and ed
ucation at Stanford Law School, the im
pression is wrong. And we recognize that
with two tenured African-American men,
two tenured Latinos and three tenured
white women (with an offer of tenure
out to a Latina) we've got it better than
a lot of law schools in terms of faculty
diversity.
But since I've only got another week
to make my impression on Stanford Law
School, I just want to say we'd like some
more diversity. Because even though I
won't be taking notes in any more class
rooms, I'll still be learning from life. And
I'd like life to teach me that more men
of color, more women and some women
of color and open gays and lesbians have
a permanent place in the second and
third floor faculty offices.
Of my whole 20 years in school, my
three at Stanford Law School have been
the most intellectually stimulating, the
most personally challenging and the most
personally rewarding. The exams have
also been the hardest. And the faculty
— as is — helped make that experience
for me.
