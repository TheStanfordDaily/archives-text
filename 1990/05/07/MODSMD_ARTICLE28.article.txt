## Cardinal netters get even with Golden Bears 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
It read like a script to a classic Rocky
flick.
Rocky loses big match. Rocky's pride
is shot. Rocky pumps himself up. Rocky
wins in an unbelievable 15th round
knockout.
Indeed, amid a packed house at Hell
man Tennis Complex, the Stanford
men's tennis team avenged an earlier
pride-deflating loss to California in a
fingernail-biting 5-4 victory.

Men's Tennis

Cardinal 5
Bears 4

With the dual knotted at 4-4, the
meet came down to a No. 2 doubles
match which pitted Stanford's Alexis
Hombrecher and Jeff Cathrall against
California's Bent Ove Pedersen and Carl
Chang.
And, in undoubtedly the most crucial
third set of the year, Hombrecher and
Cathrall broke Chang at 5-5 and ended
up winning the match 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.
Even the final game in the third set
had its ups and downs. Up 6-5,
Hombrecher used his huge serve to give
the Cardinal a 40-love, triple-match
point lead. But then Hombrecher fell
apart, missing five serves in a row. At
40-30, however, Hombrecher kicked in
a strong second serve and two shots
later the match was over.
What was Hombrecher thinking on
that sixth serve after missing five in a
row? "I was just praying that there was
a God," he said.
Earlier in the season, the Bears had
embarrassed the Cardinal at home,
beating Stanford 5-4 in a dual that came
down to one service break in the No.
1 doubles match. California's win ended
the Cardinal's 29-match winning streak
of two years, helped to drop Stanford
out of its No. 1 national ranking and
marked the first time the Cardinal had
fallen to the Bears at home in some

-20-odd years. For the Stanford team,
Friday's rematch took on epic impor
tance: it was the team's last chance to
redeem itself before the NCAA Cham
pionships May 18.
And on Friday, even with No. 1 player
Jonathan Stark out with a stress frac
ture, Stanford did just that, showing a
depth of character that it had not dis
played (or needed to display) all season
long.
Alex O'Brien started the Cardinal roll
ing at No. 2 singles, breaking out of a
slight slump by crushing arch-nemesis
Doug Eisenman 6-2, 6-3. Earlier in the
season, Eisenman had come back from
a set down to beat O'Brien in a crucial
third-set tiebreaker.
But this time O'Brien got on top of
Eisenman and never let him into the
match. "I just wanted to stay really
focused," O'Brien said. "In the last
match, I let him come back in the second
set. I wasn't going to let that happen
today."
O'Brien gave a lot of credit to the
Stanford fans who made the trip to
California. "Seriously, you'd never think
that those 30-odd guys could make a
difference. But they practically gave us
home court advantage at Cal, especially
in that last match. It's great to have
people out there making noise for you."
At No. 1 singles, Jared Palmer hoped
to work some magic against Pedersen,
the No. 12-ranked player in the country.
He almost did in the first set.
Palmer was serving 5-4 in the first
and also had a match point in the first
set tiebreaker, but the freshman super
star could not convert either time.
Pedersen ended up winning the first-set
tiebreaker 10-8 and the match 7-6, 6-0.
Palmer, who had just returned from
knee surgery which forced him to miss
the first Stanford-California dual, said
that it was difficult to regain composure
after losing the first set. "It's tough to
lose a first set like that," he explained.
"Since I am still not at my strongest
physically, it really started affecting me
mentally. I kept waiting for myself to
get back into it [in the second set]. But
he kept playing better and better, and

I obviously just didn't do it."
Jeff Cathrall also had chances at No.
3 singles but could not hold off Matt
Lucena, who ended up winning the
mate!) 2-6, 6-2, 7-5.
After being down 3-1 in the third set,
Cathrall came back to lead 4-3. Cathrall
lost his serve twice from then on, how
ever, and Lucena gave the Bears a short
lived 2-1 lead in the singles competition.
Hombrecher evened the dual at 2-2
behind some big serving and crucial vol
leying, edging Pete Fitzpatrick 2-6, 6-2,
7-5.
Matt Stroyman, however, gave the
lead back to Bears at No. 6 singles,
downing Jason Yee 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. Yee,
who had beaten Stroyman 6-1, 6-2 April
11, led the whole way until the third.
Yee was even up a service break late
in the second set. "I just didn't force
him enough. I let him back in," Yee said.
Glenn Solomon tied the seesaw battle
once again, this time at 3-3, as the
Cardinal junior upended Carl Chang 6-
4, 3-6, 6-4.
In a similar fashion to last year's
third-set victory over Chang, Solomon
once again played the role of the
"comeback kid." Down 4-1 in the third,
Solomon refused to die, retrieving every
ball that Chang sent over the net and
winning the next five consecutive games
for the victory.
"I was just playing it one point at a
time," Solomon said. "I knew I just
needed to stay with him to have a chance
[in the third].
"This is the biggest win of the year
for us. This 5-4 match, against one of
the best teams in the country, means
a lot to us. I can't say enough about
our confidence going into the NCAAs,"
Solomon added.
Tied at 3-3 after the singles, the Car
dinal needed to win two doubles
matches for the victory. In the last dual
match against California, the same sit
uation resulted, but California tri
umphed at both the No. 1 and No. 2
doubles positions.
This time, however, Stanford's dou-

over the Bears.
bles teams were more experienced.
The loss at No. 1 doubles was
insignificant. With Stark out of
the lineup, Dan Turbow stepped
in but he and Palmer were unable
to upend Eisenman and Lucena.
The California duo won the match
6-4, 6-4.
At No. 3 doubles, the Pacific
10 Conference doubles champions,
O'Brien and Yee, continued to
dominate, clobbering David Mab
butt and Barry Hancock 6-2, 6-3.
"I knew it was coming down to
doubles," Yee said.
With the match tied at 4-4,
Hombrecher and Cathrall, who
have a 9-0 record as a doubles
combination, took care of the rest.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
praised his team's doubles play
and was happy that there was no
injuries. "What this match means
is that we didn't lose going into
the NCAAs. Going in with a win
is certainly better than going in
with a loss," Gould added.
