# 33 runs later, torrid Stanford clinches Six-Pac crown
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — A pitcher, a
pitcher, my kingdom for a pitcher.
For two of this weekend's three
games between the Stanford and
California baseball teams, Cal
Coach Bob Milano probably gave
serious thought to taking out a
help-wanted ad in the local
papers, asking for anyone and his
mother to come try their hand
pitching for the Bears.

Baseball

Cardinal sweeps three
game series with Bears

Asking for help actually wasn't
a bad idea: Milano's pitching staff,
which has fused the words
"astronomical" and "ERA" this
season, gave up 30 runs (ouch!)
and 35 hits (oh my lip!) to the
Cardinal in the series' first two
games.
Finally, in yesterday's game,
junior transfer Brad Brown gave
Milano a strong pitching perform
ance, completely shutting the
Stanford hitters down. Brown was
masterful, giving up only three
hits in the first seven innings and
allowing all of two runs through
nine.
And it still wasn't good enough.
With the sweep, the Cardinal
clinches first place in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
at 22-5 (46-9 overall). The Six-Pac
title, Stanford's first since 1987,
means that Sunken Diamond will
most likely play host to one of
the eight NCAA playoff regionals,
which begin May 24.
"It's just one of those things,"
Milano said after he watched his
bullpen blow a two-run lead in
Friday's 15-9 loss at Evans Dia

mond. "We can compete with
(Stanford), but we can't pitch with
them. Offensively, we can compete
with anybody in this league. Then
we walk a few guys, we fall asleep
defensively, and that's the game."
That's a pretty fair summary
of Friday's game, with one small
exception: The Bears almost
pitched themselves out of the
game before they even got to the
plate. Starting pitcher Nate
Brown, who is listed as an out
fielder on the Cal roster for ob
vious reasons, walked the first
four Stanford batters. Eighteen
pitches. Two of them strikes.
Yicch. Nate took a walk (it was
contagious), giving way to Mark
Juhas, who only let all three Car
dinal runners score before getting
out of the inning.
Normally, a four-zip Stanford
lead and Stan (12-1) Spencer on
the mound means the game is
over, but Spencer, for the second
outing in a row, wasn't sharp.
The Bears got to within 6-4 after
four innings and then took the
lead with a four-run fifth, chasing
Spencer.
"We've been spoiled because
Stan's had great outings for us,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "As long as he's healthy I'm
not going to worry."
No need, at least not as long
as Marquess gets relief perform
ances like the one Brian Sack
insky turned in. After escaping
the mess Spencer left for him in
the fifth inning (thanks to a fan
tastic diving catch by — guess
who? — Roger Burnett), Sack
insky kept the Bears quiet, giving
up all of three hits the rest of
the way.
"I just went in with an attitude
that I was gonna go after them
and challenge them," Sackinsky
said. "If they hit my best stuff,
then they hit it."

They didn't, and the Cardinal
took the lead right back with three
runs in the top of the sixth,
thanks in part to one of Mike
"E5" Muhlethaler's 46 errors and
a wild pitch from Juhas.
The lead appeared to be enough
with Sackinsky on fire, but Stan
ford came up with four more in
the eighth (three on a homer by
Troy Tallman that just missed
clubbing a climber on the cement
wall behind the left-feld fence)
just to make sure.
"I figured we'd score more
runs," Sackinsky said, "But even
when we did I treated it as a
one-run ball game."
He wouldn't have had much of
a chance to do that in Saturday's
game at Sunken Diamond, be
cause the Cardinal lineup bent,
folded, spindled and mutilated the
Cal pitchers to the tune of 15-1.
The game was wrapped up in
about half an hour, thanks to an
eight-run second-inning hit-fest.
Tallman started the party with a
solo homer (his fourth of the year
against Cal), and a triple, two
singles, a walk, a double, two er
rors (one from Muhlethaler, a.k.a.
"Mr. Good Hands") and two
singles later it was 11-nada.
Check, please!
The offensive fireworks came
to an abrupt halt yesterday, as
Brown stifled the Cardinal for the
first seven innings. Stanford's
John Reid, however, was doing
the same to the Bears, who could
only come up with two runs —
one on a wild pitch, the other on
a single, passed ball and another
single.
In the eighth, however, Stan
ford broke through on singles
from Burnett, Hammonds and
Troy Paulsen. Paulsen's hit, a
grounder deep to short, was
