# Students split on SCLC proposal
## Poll finds mixed reaction to Fundamental Standard interpretation 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford students are evenly split over
the proposed interpretation of the Fun
damental Standard by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council, a Daily poll
has found.
The poll results show that many stu
dents are wary that the proposed SCLC
revisions would place unacceptable
limits on free speech. Only a handful
of students said the proposal does not
do enough to protect students from dis
criminatory expression.
Written by Law Prof. Thomas Grey,
the proposal would make it a violation
to use insulting or fighting words of a
discriminatory nature aimed directly to
stigmatize an individual or a small

group of individuals.
Some 285 students
were polled this week
end by The Daily on a
number of topics, in
cluding the SCLC pro
posal, cheerleaders and
the ASSU election.

Results of other poll
questions will be published in tomor
row's Daily.
Every 10th student from the Student
Directory was chosen to participate in
the poll. Fifty-four percent of the re
spondents were graduate students. The
margin of error in the SCLC poll is 6
percent.
The students were read the following
text preceding the question: "The Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council has

proposed a revised interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard. The proposal
would make it a violation to use insult
ing or fighting words of a discriminatory
nature aimed directly to stigmatize an
individual or a small group of individ
uals."
Students were asked to match their
views with the following responses:
"The proposal goes too far in limiting
discriminatory speech"; "the proposal
is fair"; or "the proposal does not go
far enough in limiting discriminatory
speech."
Of 285 respondents, 100 chose the
first option, 107 said the proposal was
fair, and 10 said the proposal did not
go far enough to limit discriminatory
