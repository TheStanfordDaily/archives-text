# Cal gets the Win the courage department
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
For the sixth time this season,
the Stanford baseball team
defeated the California Golden
Bears yesterday. But for the first
time in the 1990 version of the
cross-Bay college baseball rivalry,
California played a ballgame
worthy of praise.
Forget that the Bears have lost
16 conference games in a row and
occupy the cellnr of the Pacific 10
Southern Division. Forget that
the Cardinal crushed California
twice already this weekend, scor
ing 15 runs on Friday and again
on Saturday. Forget all that.
The Bears forgot it and, though
they are only 17-40 overall, pre
sented the 46-9, No. 2-ranked Car
dinal with the kind of no-holds
barred dogfight that Stanford
needs to prepare for the NCAA
regional tournament.
Sunday's game had the makings
of a great ballgame. By winning
Saturday's game, Stanford had
clinched at least a tie for the Six-
Pac title and the right to host one
of the NCAA's eight regional tour
naments. The Cardinal was posi
tioned to secure the conference
title outright, but California, play
ing their final Six-Pac game and
final home game of the season,
faced one final chance at redemp
tion.
By defeating Stanford, the

Bears could show that their
injury-plagued, frustrating season
was more than an exercise in
futility.
Maybe for that reason, Califor
nia Coach Bob Milano selected
junior pitcher Brad Brown, a
transfer from Stanford, to take
the mound against his former
teammates. Brown, after pitching
against Stanford April 13, was
less than reticent about his
feelings for the Stanford program.
The Cardinal players wanted to
rock Brown. Brown wanted to
shut down the Cardinal.
If Friday's and Saturday's
scores were any indicator of the
capabilities of these teams, then
California won yesterday's game,
in courage if not on the scorecard.
Brown held Stanford to just
seven hits and a run through eight
and two-thirds innings and was
one out shy of a complete game
victory. Only Ryan Turner earned
a run off of Brown, a homer to
tie the game at two in the top of
the ninth, and right fielder Chris
Pacione's fielding error allowed
Cardinal leadofT man Jeff Ham
monds to reach third on a single
in the top of the tenth.
Hammonds then scored the
game winning run, unearned, on
Troy Paulsen's blooper to center
that was booted by Aaron Fuller
to ruin Brown's masterful game
and an otherwise courageous per
formance by the Bears.

"That's our fifth conference
extra-inning game, and we've lost
them all," Milano said. "That
really saps your confidence. It
makes it tough on the team."
"Throughout the season we've
been getting a lot of runs, but not
in crucial situations," California
designated hitter Jason Evans
said. "Today we got it right up
until the last inning."
As Brown tied up the Stanford
batters, California quietly gener
ated two runs, in the third inning
and again in the seventh. Bear
left fielder John Zuber singled
with one out in the third and
scored on Mike Harrison's single
after Stanford catcher Troy Tall
man's passed ball allowed Zuber
to move up to second.
Fuller scored the second run
when pinch running for Matt
Luke, who led off the seventh with
a double to the gap in left center.
A fly ball and a Stanford error
moved Fuller to third, who trotted
home on Cardinal starter John
Reed's wild pitch.
In the second inning, Luke
robbed Stanford designated hitter
David Holbrook of an extra-base
hit with a diving catch in the gap
in right-center field and kept Tim
Griffin, who walked to lead off
the inning, safely at first base. In
the third.
For once, California put to
gether good pitching with solid
defense and clutch hitting to
stymie an opponent ... until the
ninth inning.
"We should have won it in the
bottom of the ninth. Weiss gets a
wild streak going," Milano said of
Cardinal reliever Scott Weiss, who
tallied the victory in spite of
loading the bases in the ninth.
"We've got one of our hottest hit
ters (Zuber) at the plate and he
doesn't do it."
Zuber's inability to bring home
the winning run gave Stanford
the opportunity it needed. To
begin the tenth Hammonds sin
gled and took third on Pacione's
error.
"To see a base hit like [Ham
mond's single in the tenth inning]
.. . you just can't do that,"
Milano said. "You can't let a guy
like Hammonds get to third."
Simply put, California could
have beaten Stanford. The Bears
displayed true sporting courage by
playing their hearts out when they
had nothing whatsoever to gain
from it.
That in itself is a victory for
the Bears.

scores were any indicator of the
capabilities of these teams, then
California won yesterday's game,
in courage if not on the scorecard.
Brown held Stanford to just
seven hits and a run through eight
and two-thirds innings and was
one out shy of a complete game
victory. Only Ryan Turner earned
a run off of Brown, a homer to
tie the game at two in the top of
the ninth, and right fielder Chris
Pacione's fielding error allowed
Cardinal leadofT man Jeff Ham
monds to reach third on a single
in the top of the tenth.
Hammonds then scored the
game winning run, unearned, on
Troy Paulsen's blooper to center
that was booted by Aaron Fuller
to ruin Brown's masterful game
and an otherwise courageous per
formance by the Bears.

"That's our fifth conference
extra-inning game, and we've lost
them all," Milano said. "That
really saps your confidence. It
makes it tough on the team."
"Throughout the season we've
been getting a lot of runs, but not
in crucial situations," California
designated hitter Jason Evans
said. "Today we got it right up
until the last inning."
As Brown tied up the Stanford
batters, California quietly gener
ated two runs, in the third inning
and again in the seventh. Bear
left fielder John Zuber singled
with one out in the third and
scored on Mike Harrison's single
after Stanford catcher Troy Tall
man's passed ball allowed Zuber
to move up to second.
Fuller scored the second run
when pinch running for Matt
Luke, who led off the seventh with
a double to the gap in left center.
A fly ball and a Stanford error
moved Fuller to third, who trotted
home on Cardinal starter John
Reed's wild pitch.
In the second inning, Luke
robbed Stanford designated hitter
David Holbrook of an extra-base
hit with a diving catch in the gap
in right-center field and kept Tim
Griffin, who walked to lead off
the inning, safely at first base. In
the third.
For once, California put to
gether good pitching with solid
defense and clutch hitting to
stymie an opponent ... until the
ninth inning.
"We should have won it in the
bottom of the ninth. Weiss gets a
wild streak going," Milano said of
Cardinal reliever Scott Weiss, who
tallied the victory in spite of
loading the bases in the ninth.
"We've got one of our hottest hit
ters (Zuber) at the plate and he
doesn't do it."
Zuber's inability to bring home
the winning run gave Stanford
the opportunity it needed. To
begin the tenth Hammonds sin
gled and took third on Pacione's
error.
"To see a base hit like [Ham
mond's single in the tenth inning]
.. . you just can't do that,"
Milano said. "You can't let a guy
like Hammonds get to third."
Simply put, California could
have beaten Stanford. The Bears
displayed true sporting courage by
playing their hearts out when they
had nothing whatsoever to gain
from it.
That in itself is a victory for
the Bears.
