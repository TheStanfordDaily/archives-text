# Men's rowers prove they can
## Stanford shows its potential in upset of No. 2 Golden Bears 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
"Crew is a very mental sport.
You can't perform any better than
you think you can."
— Stanford men's crew Coach Ken
Dreyfuss
The year seemed destined for
unfulfilled promise. The men's
crew team had been telling every
body that they were better than
they looked, but come race day
nothing happened. No one wanted
to believe that they were capable
of going fast. When it was time
for the "Big Row," no one, includ
ing the University of California,
seemed to believe that this team
could win.
Like the little train that could,
however, Stanford finally proved
itself up to the task.
"It was like we were rehearsing
a play, and come show time we
kept forgetting our lines," captain
Andy Winden said. "Well, we fi
nally remembered our lines."
For the first time this year,
Stanford was able to match its
race with its start. The team had
had been consistently beating
their competition off the line, only
to falter at the halfway point. But

this didn't happen Saturday.
"We rowed very hard off the
line, and took a couple of seats,"
Dreyfuss said. "This has hap
pened every Cal race, but this
time we stayed with it."
"We broke them psychological
ly," Winden added. "We really
jumped on them from the start,
and they gave us too much. We
were able to relax and row well.
We never looked back."
The Cardinal wound up beating
the West's second-ranked team by
three seconds over the 2000 meter
course, 5:47.2 to 5:50.75 The up
set gave them possession of the
Big Jim Renoylds Cup, and be
cause the team went 3-for-4 on
the strength of freshman and
novice victories, the Big Trophy
also found its way back to The
Farm. The success may be a
surprise, but it is not without ex
planation.
"It was pretty amazing," Win
den said. "The new additions to
the boat were helpful. We are a
lot stronger and better fit."
Two days before the race,
Dreyfuss mixed up his line-up in
hopes of greater speed and better
staying power. To accomplish this,
he moved Matt Dalva, Tom Beis
cher, Steve Voorhis, and coxswain

Pete Dominick up from the junior
varsity. Dreyfuss was obviously
happy with the changes.
"The new people gave the boat
an infusion of energy," the coach
said. "Matt Dalva rowed very well,
very aggressively, and Tom Beis
cher is a total leader. Pete did a
great job pulling the boat to
gether."
The women did not come up
with quite the same success. Un
like the men, the women were not
able to generate enough speed to
keep up with their cross bay rivals
and wound up losing by 3.5
seconds, 6:27.5 to 6:31. Berkeley's
time broke the existing course
record of 6:28, and the pace of
the race gave Stanford coach John
Davis hope for the future.
"This was the first week that
this eight had been together, and
there is a lot to be encouraged
by," Davis said. "Rowing a 6:31
is an indication that we can go
pretty fast."
Though Berkeley wound up
sweeping, everyone except the
second novice did better against
the Bears than they had earlier
in the year.
"The kids raced lots better than
they did a couple of weeks ago,

but Cal raced better yet," Davis
said. "Cal has been doing very
well across the board. They are
rowing with a confidence that I
haven't seen them row with in
seven years."
Stanford was first off the line,
grabbing three seats in the first

500 meters, but California crept
back to pull even at the halfway
mark. Stanford lost ground when
it was unable to match the Bear's
stroke rate after they made their
move at the 1500 meter mark.
"They got up to 36 or 37 strokes
per minute to our 34," Davis said.

"We couldn't generate enough
speed to catch them"
"Cal probably had its best race
of the season," he continued. "We
have to be pretty happy. The kids
are psyched, they believe they
have a better race in them than
they showed (Saturday)."

seven years."
Stanford was first off the line,
grabbing three seats in the first

500 meters, but California crept
back to pull even at the halfway
mark. Stanford lost ground when
it was unable to match the Bear's
stroke rate after they made their
move at the 1500 meter mark.
"They got up to 36 or 37 strokes
per minute to our 34," Davis said.

"We couldn't generate enough
speed to catch them"
"Cal probably had its best race
of the season," he continued. "We
have to be pretty happy. The kids
are psyched, they believe they
have a better race in them than
they showed (Saturday)."
