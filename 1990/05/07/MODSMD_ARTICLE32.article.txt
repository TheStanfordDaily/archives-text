# Card running toward post-season success
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
In a meet that produced
three 1990 world-best perform
ances, Cardinal track and field
athletes refused to be left out
of the action. The squad re
corded two more Pacific 10
Conference qualifying marks
and continued to close in on
qualifying for postseason meets
in other areas at the Modesto
Relays Saurday.
Freshman Ashley Black was
one of the Pac-10 qualifiers, in
the 1500-meter run. She
smashed her personal record
(set last weekend against Cal
ifornia) by about seven seconds
for a 4:28.9 and the qualifica
tion.
Senior Venessa Henlon
posted the other qualifying
mark when she popped a
season-best 19-foot-ll in the
long jump. She will now join
teammates Jackie Edwards and
Alysia Hubbard in both the
long and triple jumps at Pac
10s. Hubbard placed fifth in
the long jump at Modesto with
a 20-foot-2 1/2 jump — her
second leap over 20 feet in as
many weekends.
Chryste Gaines, the sopho
more sprinter, outran a fast
field for first in both the 100-
and 200-meter dashes with
11.39- and 23.71- second times
in those events. She is .43
seconds away from an NCAA
bid in the 200. She has already
qualified in the 100.
Another athlete who is
edging closer to the NCAAs is
junior long jumper Marcus
Hickerson. For the second

week in a row, he uncorked a
personal best, this time break
ing the 26-foot mark at 26-foot
-3/4. His jump is a quarter of
an inch off the NCAA
qualifying distance, and he pre
dicted that he will be at the
postseason meet.
"I think I got it in me," he
said. "I think I actually jumped
a little farther [than indicated
at Modesto]. The pit was kind
of shallow, and as soon as I
hit I skidded, and that may
have hurt me. My butt might
have touched as 1 fell back."
Other Cardinal athletes were
not quite as fortunate in qual
ifying or nearly qualifying for
postseason events, but several
nevertheless were highly im
pressive. Jamie Marek soared
to 16-foot-l to set a new fresh
man school record in the pole
vault.
Along with Marek and Black,
freshman Susan Helfter
showed a glimmer of Stanford's
future strength as she finished
fifth in the 400 intermediate
hurdles. Her time of 1:04.17 is
only a few seconds behind the
Pac-10 qualifying standard.
Peter Kolotouros, a senior
high hurdler, flew over the ob
stacles in a personal-best 13.6
seconds. Normally, this would
have qualified him for the
NCAAs, but as it was hand
timed and the wind was above
the NCAA's stated limit, it does
not count. Kolotouros was dis
appointed that the NCAA
would not accept his perform
ance.
"I wanted to get the quali
fying mark for NCAAs out of
the way at Modesto," he said.
