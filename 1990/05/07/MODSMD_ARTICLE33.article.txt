# Women netters seeded first for NCAAs
## Card downs Cal in mixed match 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The unanimous No. 1 team in
the nation all season long is, as
expected, the top seed in the
NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onships which begin Wednesday
in Gainesville, Fla.
Stanford cruised through the
season with a perfect 25-0 mark
and is currently riding a 61-match
winning streak dating back to
April of 1988. The Cardinal will
meet the winner of the Arizona-
Brigham Young match at 3:30
p.m. (EDT) Thursday. As one of
the top 12 seeds, Stanford gets a
first-round bye.
Should the team advance to the
quarterfinals, it will meet the win
ner of the Georgia-Oklahoma
State showdown. The Bulldogs,
seeded fifth at NCAAs, were shut
out by Stanford in last year's
championships and in this
season's National Team Indoors
held in March.
Oklahoma State lost 5-1 to the
Cardinal last May. The Cowgirls
were the only team to take even
one point from Stanford in last
season's event.
Theoretically, the semifinals
should pair Stanford with Califor
nia, a team the Cardinal has
beaten twice already this year.
In its final tune-up before
heading out to Florida, the women
paired up with the Stanford men
to battle the Golden Bears in the
annual mixed match exhibition.
The Cardinal edged Cal 37-34 in
yesterday's event.
Eight matches were played,
each with a 30-minute time limit.
All games won counted toward
the final score. The exhibition was
played in four, two-match seg

ments.
In the opening segment, Cal's
Jean-Marie Lozano and Lisa Al
bano nipped Sandra Birch and
Debbie Graham 5-4. The Cardi
nal's Alexis Hombrecher, though,
defeated the Bears' Ed Marcum
by the same score to tie things
at 9-9.
The second segment proved
decisive as Ten Whitlinger and
Dan Turbow smashed Albano and
Carl Chang 7-2. Meanwhile, John
Connolly and Ted Pedroza helped
Stanford extend the lead by out
scoring Ed Marcum and Barry
Hancock 7-4.
Cal made up some ground in
the third grouping as Albano out
scored Lisa Green 6-2. Jared Pal
mer and Kylie Johnson won a 4-3
decision over Hancock and
Lozano.
In the final pair of matches,
Matt Lucena and Pete Fitzpatrick
helped bring the Bears closer as
they downed Alex O'Brien and
Jason Yee 5-4. Similarly, Tiffany
Silveria and Ellen Walliser
defeated Mario Carruth and
Meredith McGrath 5-4.
Card notes
Host Florida is the No. 2 seed in
the NCAA tournament draw. The host
school has never won the national
championship.
Green, McGrath, Whitlinger, Birch
and Graham all earned spots in the
NCAA singles draw. Heather Willens
is the third alternate and has an out
side shot of making it.
McGrath-Whitlinger, recently
named doubles team of the month by
the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches As
sociation, and Birch-Graham both
earned spots in the NCAA doubles
event.
