# Card golfer Wooding just wants to have fun
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
There are few things more frus
trating than trying to hit a little
white bail into a cup 450 yards'
away. While there have been no
statistical surveys, the number of
golf clubs that have been wrapped
around trees by annoyed golfers
must be right up there with the
number of people claiming they
knew Unbridled was going to win
the Kentucky Derby.
In addition to the inherent dif
ficulty of the game, golfing inter
collegiately against some of the
nation's top teams brings added
pressure onto golfers. Onto every
one except sophomore Audrey
Wooding, that is.
The reason pressure doesn't get
to Wooding is because she's too
busy having fun to worry. Not
that it's always been that way,
though.
"My first (collegiate) tourna
ment I played in, I was so nervous
I could hardly hit the ball when
I stood up to it," she said. "I
remember hitting this one shot
— a six-iron on the third hole. I
could hardly stand over the ball,
I was so nervous. I finally realized
what I was doing; that I had to
calm down.
"Now I'm comfortable with the
people I'm playing with and I
know I can play with them."
After her (literally) shaky start,
Wooding went on to have a fine
freshman season and helped the
Cardinal to a lOth-place finish at
the NCAA Championships last
year. She was the last player on
the course for the Cardinal and
drained a tricky six-foot putt on
the 18th hole to put the team in
the top 10 instead of 11th. In
addition to the satisfaction of a
top-10 finish, the result put Stan
ford in line for lucrative sponsor
ship deals.
"She knew it really meant
something to the team," Coach
Tim Baldwin said. "She's had to
overcome [nervousness] and she
has. She just stands up on that
first tee now and she knows where
it's going."
And it's usually been going
somewhere good. Wooding placed
fifth in the team's second tour
nament of the year despite the
presence of five of the nation's

top 22 teams and has had several
other fine results. She is currently
ranked 50th nationally going into
the California Intercollegiate
tournament today and tomorrow
in San Diego, and is one of four
Stanford players in the top 60.

"Her golf game has improved
tremendously," Baldwin said.
"She is a very pleasant surprise.
I knew that she would be good
but I didn't know she could be
this good."
The biggest reasons for her suc

cess are an odd combination: hard
work and a fun-loving attitude.
When Wooding first played golf
on her eighth birthday, however,
her journey to the college ranks
did not seem likely.
"I hated golf after that for quite
a while," she said of her first try
at the sport. "My parents bribed
me to play golf. They would say,
'Let's go play some golf and then
we'll go get ice cream after.'
"I hit the ball so bad all the
time when I first started playing.
All the other golfers were so much
better so I had no chance of win
ning tournaments.
After seeing her older sister
begin to succeed at the game,
Wooding began to practice harder.
"I decided that I wanted to play
well," she said. "When I was 15
I started to practice more. . . .
Once I started putting my skills
to practice I started playing bet
ter. . . . It's a lot more fun when
you play well."
But despite a junior career that
included winning the Washington
age-group state title between her
junior and senior years in high
school, she still wasn't having that
much fun.
"When I was a junior golfer I
forgot to have fun," she said.
"Going into college golf I knew
my game was going to improve.
One thing was I wanted to know
was if I'd have fun. I really do
have fun (now). I really enjoy it."
Wooding feels her attitude
toward the game is what makes
her successful. "It's part of my
life but it's not my whole life. If
I'm going out, I gotta have
fun. . . . It's like my problem sets
are fun. I enjoy my classes so I
like doing my problem sets. If
you're not having fun you have
to change it so you do have fun."
Because she so enjoys the sport,

she works hard at it. "She is ex
tremely dedicated, hard-working
and extremely talented," Baldwin
said. "The evidence for Audrey is
rolling in. There's nobody who
practices harder or concentrates
harder and she just keeps getting
better."
In addition to her work ethic,
Wooding also feels the way
Baldwin runs the program has
helped her. "I think the program
we have here is such that the
attitude is relaxed but intense in
the same situation, fun but
serious," Wooding said. "That
helps a lot. I don't feel like I have
to come out for five hours — putt
and chip for five hours because I
haven't been putting and chipping
well."
The Cardinal is currently com
ing off its best showing of the
season, a fourth-place finish at
the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships at the Stanford Golf
Course a week ago.
Wooding also fared well individ
ually, tying teammate Jodi Figley
for 11th place.
"We're looking at the top five
(at NCAAs) after the way we
played [a week ago]," Wooding
said. "Realistically we could win
this tournament. After last week
end we realized we can go out
and play three good rounds and
win it."
And with four sophomores, a
junior and a senior on the team,
the Cardinal will likely be in the
running the next two years as
well. After that, Wooding doesn't
know what her future in golf holds
for her.
"I don't want to ever say no to
turning professional," she said. I
haven't really considered it but
that might be something I'd want
to do. . . . [Golf] will probably al
ways be a part of my life. But I
want to get my degree first.
"Golf isn't my life. I have more
to my existence than golf. Golf is
a part of me and I like that, but
it's not all of me and I like that
too. ... I can't just play a sport.
I'm a golfer, yes, but I wouldn't
classify myself as a golfer. I'm a
student too, but 1 wouldn't clas
sify myself as a nerd or a study
geek. Parts of me are like that
but parts of me are totally differ
ent."
But all of her is having fun.

fairways and greens of collegiate events, and contributing to the
Cardinal's winning ways as well.
