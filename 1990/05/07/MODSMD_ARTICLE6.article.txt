# 2-4-6-8 23? Yes!
## Cheerleaders take all who try out 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
"Dude, this is the first sport I
never got cut from!"
That was the reaction of one
student when Asst. Athletic Di
rector Jim Brungard announced
that all 23 students who tried out
Friday afternoon had made the
new yell leader squad.
"When you're starting some
thing new, it's important not to
cut anybody out," said Athletic
Director Andy Geiger, explaining
why every auditioner made the
squad.
When Athletic Department of
ficials decided early Friday morn
ing to accept such a large squad,
freshman Amy Poherence, captain
of the new squad and leader of
the drive to get cheerleaders at
Stanford, said her main concern
was funding.
"People are already freaking
out about the money," she said,
referring to recent criticism about
allocating funds for cheerleaders
when many sports have under
gone cutbacks.
But Geiger said funding for the
group would not come from any
additions to the Athletic Depart
ment budget or from alumni dona
tions specifically earmarked for
cheerleaders, although he ex
pressed hope that such donations
would develop in the future.
Instead, the yell leaders will
"share the Band's money."
In a letter to The Daily, Geiger
explained that "the sharing of
funds ... is appropriate, as the
Band and Dollies do not consider
themselves to be spirit- or rally
oriented instead of their self
proclaimed role of'entertainers.' "
Geiger's letter appears on page
4 of today's Daily.
Members of the Band refused
to comment on the decision until
they could talk to Geiger and ob
tain details on the amount of
money involved and how it will
affect future Band activities.
The yell leaders, comprised of
four men and 19 women, will be
split up into four smaller sub
groups, each with one man and
four or five women. During foot
ball season, the small groups will
lead cheers at different corners of
the stadium and rotate each quar
ter of the game.
"We want to get the energy in
the crowd channeled in the right

direction," said freshman Aaron
Poirier, one of the new yell
leaders.
According to Poherence, the yell
leaders will wear traditional
cheerleader uniforms and use ac
tivities like simple cheers and card
stunts.
"I honestly can't believe [the
students] will make fun of us once
they see we're here to get the
crowd into the game," she said.
The effort to get yell leaders at
Stanford began when Poherence
approached football Coach Dennis
Green with the concept. He liked
the idea, so Poherence contacted
the marketing and promotions di
vision of the Athletic Department,
which then organized the tryouts.
Because the decision to accept
such a large squad was made only
hours before the tryouts, many
details of how the squad will op
erate were yet to be decided —
such as how many squad members
will travel to away games and
where additional money to sup

plement Athletic Department
funds will be found.
Poherence said the group will
"get a lot of money from fund
raising" by its members and that
a shoe manufacturer has already
agreed to donate shoes for the
squad.
Both yell leaders and adminis
trators alike pointed out that the
squad is not trying to take the
place of the Dollies.
"The focus is not at all on danc
ing, it's on getting the students
and fans to cheer," said Brungard.
In explaining the need for yell
leaders at Stanford, Geiger said
in his letter, "We would like to
build an environment of fun, ex
citement and support for the stu
dents who are participating in the
football game."
"Anything to get the student
body involved is great. Intimida
tion (of the other team) is a major
part of the game," said sophomore
Ellery Roberts, a member of the
football team.
