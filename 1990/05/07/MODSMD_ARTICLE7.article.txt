## ASSU elections controversy not part of Krauss' vision 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Steve Krauss, ASSU elections
commissioner, had hoped this
year's elections would be remem
bered for their efficiency, rapidity
and fairness.
Instead, he has found himself
embroiled in one of the most con
troversial elections in recent
years.
Krauss' decision to invalidate
275 write-in votes for the Council
of Presidents launched a sit-in at
the ASSU offices, a vote recount,
talk of ASSU Bylaw changes and
national media attention.
Krauss never imagined his de
cision would cause such a contro
versy, but he takes it as part of
his job.
"I realized that the decision I
was making would make people
unhappy. But I thought the whole
furor would die down after a cou
ple of days. It's not that I felt the
student body wouldn't care, but
I felt the decision was pretty rea
sonable," he said.

So how does he feel now?
"Well, exhausted, for one thing.
I really don't know what to say.
It's strange. Of course it's really
unfortunate. I understand why
it's gone on so long. People are
really concerned about it, and
that's good."
Krauss thinks that other insti
tutions should be created to
resolve election difficulties. "I
think it's unfortunate that there's
no body to which it could be ap
pealed — a body that resembled
an unbiased, non-partisan [jury],"
Krauss said.
Without a judicial body to which
campaigners could appeal, Krauss
said he and the Elections Com
mission felt a great deal of pres
sure "not to waver" in their
decision-making.
"People made it clear from the
beginning that they didn't want
it to go to the senate. I don't
think anybody would say that the
senate is non-partisan," he said.
With the pressure on him and
the Elections Commission,
Krauss thought that "the Elec

tions Commission gave as impar
tial, non-partisan decision as it
could give . . . given the horrible
situation."
His decision has not been uni
versally hailed. However, while
critics have called it unfair, people
on all sides of the discussion feel
that Krauss has given a reasoned
and firm decision.
Perry Friedman, a former
Chaparral editor and participant
in the ongoing ASSU sit-in, said,
"I think he's sticking by his guns.
I don't think he's bowing to pres
sure."
Goodwin Liu, a member of next
year's COP who admitted he was,
"of course, biased," said he still
felt that Krauss "did his
homework" and "his ruling is
fair."
Krauss said he has handled the
pressure and criticism from the
rest of campus by "responding to
some, ignoring some and dealing
with the rest."
However, to minimize future


ASSU elections commissioner Steve Krauss has been at the center of a controversy since rulina that
write-in votes would not be counted in the COP race. 9
election controversy, Krauss envi
sions some changes in the ASSU
Bylaws. He said that in the midst
of all the division, it is not sur
prising that changing the Bylaws
is one thing that "everybody can
agree on."
Krauss gave two possible
avenues that could eliminate dif
ficulties. The first is to disallow
write-in voting for COP and
Senior Class Presidents so as to
allow for only "legitimate candi
dates as eligible candidates." The
second is to create Bylaws that
carefully define "which votes
count or not."
Whether this election results in
changes in the Bylaws or not,
Krauss said he is disillusioned be
cause this "whole thing happened.
.. . I'm redly disappointed that
this election may be remembered
for" its aftermath, he said.
Nonetheless, in Krauss' eyes,
one ironic aspect of the election
aftermath that has turned out
positively has been the national
media attention. When popular
cartoon character Bart Simpson
garnered enough votes to win a
non-voting graduate senate seat,
newspapers such as USA Today
and television programs like "En
tertainment Tonight" reported
the results.

Krauss said the media coverage
has "been kind of healthy. . . . It's
broken some of the tension. The
whole world is laughing at us."
While Krauss is not "thrilled"
that the elections are a national
laughingstock, he still thinks "it's
difficult to stay uptight when
there are stories of Bart Simpson
in the legislature on 'Entertain
ment Tonight.' "
Krauss said that while the elec
tion results have been contested,
protested and ridiculed, the logis
tics of the election itself were "a
sterling success."
Preliminary statistics compiled
from voters showed that 83 per
cent felt voting by computer was
"very easy," compared to 81 per
cent last year. In addition, more
people had a shorter wait in line.
About 82 percent waited 10
minutes or less, compared with
56 percent last year; further,
about 78 percent of the voters
preferred computer voting to all
other types of voting.
Krauss thought his experience
as elections commissioner last
year helped out with this year's
improved voting ease and efficien
cy.
"One of the main reasons [for
the voting success] was that we
knew a lot better what we were
doing," he said. "We brought the
equipment on campus a day ear
lier ... [and] we started according
to schedule," he added.

Krauss said he is disillusioned be
cause this "whole thing happened.
.. . I'm redly disappointed that
this election may be remembered
for" its aftermath, he said.
Nonetheless, in Krauss' eyes,
one ironic aspect of the election
aftermath that has turned out
positively has been the national
media attention. When popular
cartoon character Bart Simpson
garnered enough votes to win a
non-voting graduate senate seat,
newspapers such as USA Today
and television programs like "En
tertainment Tonight" reported
the results.

Krauss said the media coverage
has "been kind of healthy. . . . It's
broken some of the tension. The
whole world is laughing at us."
While Krauss is not "thrilled"
that the elections are a national
laughingstock, he still thinks "it's
difficult to stay uptight when
there are stories of Bart Simpson
in the legislature on 'Entertain
ment Tonight.' "
Krauss said that while the elec
tion results have been contested,
protested and ridiculed, the logis
tics of the election itself were "a
sterling success."
Preliminary statistics compiled
from voters showed that 83 per
cent felt voting by computer was
"very easy," compared to 81 per
cent last year. In addition, more
people had a shorter wait in line.
About 82 percent waited 10
minutes or less, compared with
56 percent last year; further,
about 78 percent of the voters
preferred computer voting to all
other types of voting.
Krauss thought his experience
as elections commissioner last
year helped out with this year's
improved voting ease and efficien
cy.
"One of the main reasons [for
the voting success] was that we
knew a lot better what we were
doing," he said. "We brought the
equipment on campus a day ear
lier ... [and] we started according
to schedule," he added.
Steve Krauss, ASSU elections
commissioner, had hoped this
year's elections would be remem
bered for their efficiency, rapidity
and fairness.
Instead, he has found himself
embroiled in one of the most con
troversial elections in recent
years.
Krauss' decision to invalidate
275 write-in votes for the Council
of Presidents launched a sit-in at
the ASSU offices, a vote recount,
talk of ASSU Bylaw changes and
national media attention.
Krauss never imagined his de
cision would cause such a contro
versy, but he takes it as part of
his job.
"I realized that the decision I
was making would make people
unhappy. But I thought the whole
furor would die down after a cou
ple of days. It's not that I felt the
student body wouldn't care, but
I felt the decision was pretty rea
sonable," he said.

So how does he feel now?
"Well, exhausted, for one thing.
I really don't know what to say.
It's strange. Of course it's really
unfortunate. I understand why
it's gone on so long. People are
really concerned about it, and
that's good."
Krauss thinks that other insti
tutions should be created to
resolve election difficulties. "I
think it's unfortunate that there's
no body to which it could be ap
pealed — a body that resembled
an unbiased, non-partisan [jury],"
Krauss said.
Without a judicial body to which
campaigners could appeal, Krauss
said he and the Elections Com
mission felt a great deal of pres
sure "not to waver" in their
decision-making.
"People made it clear from the
beginning that they didn't want
it to go to the senate. I don't
think anybody would say that the
senate is non-partisan," he said.
With the pressure on him and
the Elections Commission,
Krauss thought that "the Elec

tions Commission gave as impar
tial, non-partisan decision as it
could give . . . given the horrible
situation."
His decision has not been uni
versally hailed. However, while
critics have called it unfair, people
on all sides of the discussion feel
that Krauss has given a reasoned
and firm decision.
Perry Friedman, a former
Chaparral editor and participant
in the ongoing ASSU sit-in, said,
"I think he's sticking by his guns.
I don't think he's bowing to pres
sure."
Goodwin Liu, a member of next
year's COP who admitted he was,
"of course, biased," said he still
felt that Krauss "did his
homework" and "his ruling is
fair."
Krauss said he has handled the
pressure and criticism from the
rest of campus by "responding to
some, ignoring some and dealing
with the rest."
However, to minimize future


ASSU elections commissioner Steve Krauss has been at the center of a controversy since rulina that
write-in votes would not be counted in the COP race. 9
election controversy, Krauss envi
sions some changes in the ASSU
Bylaws. He said that in the midst
of all the division, it is not sur
prising that changing the Bylaws
is one thing that "everybody can
agree on."
Krauss gave two possible
avenues that could eliminate dif
ficulties. The first is to disallow
write-in voting for COP and
Senior Class Presidents so as to
allow for only "legitimate candi
dates as eligible candidates." The
second is to create Bylaws that
carefully define "which votes
count or not."

changes in the Bylaws or not,
Krauss said he is disillusioned be
cause this "whole thing happened.
