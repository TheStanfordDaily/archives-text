## ASSU elections controversy not part of Krauss' vision 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Steve Krauss, ASSU elections
commissioner, had hoped this
year's elections would be remem
bered for their efficiency, rapidity
and fairness.
Instead, he has found himself
embroiled in one of the most con
troversial elections in recent
years.
Krauss' decision to invalidate
275 write-in votes for the Council
of Presidents launched a sit-in at
the ASSU offices, a vote recount,
talk of ASSU Bylaw changes and
national media attention.
Krauss never imagined his de
cision would cause such a contro
versy, but he takes it as part of
his job.
"I realized that the decision I
was making would make people
unhappy. But I thought the whole
furor would die down after a cou
ple of days. It's not that I felt the
student body wouldn't care, but
I felt the decision was pretty rea
sonable," he said.

So how does he feel now?
"Well, exhausted, for one thing.
I really don't know what to say.
It's strange. Of course it's really
unfortunate. I understand why
it's gone on so long. People are
really concerned about it, and
that's good."
Krauss thinks that other insti
tutions should be created to
resolve election difficulties. "I
think it's unfortunate that there's
no body to which it could be ap
pealed â€” a body that resembled
an unbiased, non-partisan [jury],"
Krauss said.
Without a judicial body to which
campaigners could appeal, Krauss
said he and the Elections Com
mission felt a great deal of pres
sure "not to waver" in their
decision-making.
"People made it clear from the
beginning that they didn't want
it to go to the senate. I don't
think anybody would say that the
senate is non-partisan," he said.
With the pressure on him and
the Elections Commission,
Krauss thought that "the Elec

tions Commission gave as impar
tial, non-partisan decision as it
could give . . . given the horrible
situation."
His decision has not been uni
versally hailed. However, while
critics have called it unfair, people
on all sides of the discussion feel
that Krauss has given a reasoned
and firm decision.
Perry Friedman, a former
Chaparral editor and participant
in the ongoing ASSU sit-in, said,
"I think he's sticking by his guns.
I don't think he's bowing to pres
sure."
Goodwin Liu, a member of next
year's COP who admitted he was,
"of course, biased," said he still
felt that Krauss "did his
homework" and "his ruling is
fair."
Krauss said he has handled the
pressure and criticism from the
rest of campus by "responding to
some, ignoring some and dealing
with the rest."
However, to minimize future


ASSU elections commissioner Steve Krauss has been at the center of a controversy since rulina that
write-in votes would not be counted in the COP race. 9
