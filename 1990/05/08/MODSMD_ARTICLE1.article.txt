In addition, the poll of 285 stu
dents found that students, by al
most a 2-to-l margin, disagree
with the Athletics Department's
plans to start up a cheerleading
squad. Funding for the cheer
leaders will be drawn from the
Athletics Department's allocation
for the Band.

In results announced yesterday, response to the
Student Conduct Legislative Council proposal to
revise the Fundamental Standard was split. One
hundred seven students said the proposal is fair,
while 100 said the proposal goes too far in limiting
discriminatory speech.
In the question about the COP election, stu
dents were read the following statement: "In
ASSU elections, a Council of Presidents slate
needs a meyority of votes cast to win. Otherwise,
a runoff election is held between the top two
vote-getters. In this year's ASSU race, Elections
Commissioner Steve Krauss ruled that write-in
votes would not be counted. Because of the ruling,
no runoff election took place."
Students were then asked, "Do you think the
write-in votes should have been counted?"
Several students objected to this question,
noting that it did not explain the Elections Com
mission's reasoning for invalidating the write-in
votes. When read the question over the telephone
before the poll, Krauss said he did not object to

the wording of the question.
Two hundred seventy-five
write-in votes were disqualifed
three weeks ago by the Elections
Commission because they were
for fictional characters such as
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
or for other ineligible slates.
Of the poll respondents, 191
students said the write-in votes
should have been counted, 45 stu
dents said the votes should not
have been counted and 47 stu
dents said they had no opinion.
Krauss said he had no specific
comment about the poll results,
but he noted, "We made a judg
ment call based on how we read
the (ASSU) Bylaws."
"The Bylaws need to be
clarified," Krauss said. He added

'I haven't even
figured out what the

that public reaction should be
taken into consideration in the
clarification process and should
not be disregarded.
In the poll, every 10th student
was selected from the Student Di
rectory to participate. Of the 285
respondents, 54 percent were
graduate students. The margin of
error in the poll is 6 percent.
Students were asked the follow
ing question about the plans for
a cheerleading squad: "The Stan
ford Athletics Department plans
to start up a cheerleading squad.
The source of funds for the cheer
leaders will come from the allo
cation for the Band and the
Dollies. Do you support this de

cision?"
Sixty-nine students said they
supported the decision, 130 said
they did not support it, and 86
said they had no opinion.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said he was not surprised by the
results of the poll.
"I think the football team sup
ports the idea," and the view of
the athletes and coaches is what
is important because they are the
ones who need to win the games,
Geiger said.
"I've wanted to try to do this
for years," Geiger said, adding
that there is also strong support
for the cheerleading squad from
football coach Dennis Green.
Asked if he thought the cheer
leading squad would hurt the
Band's normal program, Geiger
said, "I haven't even figured out
what the normal program is."
However, Geiger said he "cer
tainly won't decimate" the Band's
funding.
