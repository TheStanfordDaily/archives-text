Khmer Rouge is returning
SREYE LA OH, Cambodia (AP) — Convoys
of Khmer Rouge trucks filled with the recent
rice harvest move freely through this rural
village in northwest Cambodia, and young
guerrilla fighters flirt with relaxed villagers.
"We are very happy to be back in our coun
try," said Khmer Rouge division commander
Mit Soe over coconut juice as Cambodian gov
ernment artillery rumbled in the distance.
In a scene played out in scores of villages
in rural Cambodia in recent months, Pol Pot's
Khmer Rouge have returned to areas they
were driven out of when Vietnamese forces
invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and installed
a pro-Hanoi government.
To much of the world, the Khmer Rouge
are fanatics who killed hundreds of thousands
of their countrymen during the 1970s in a
savage bid to create a communist agrarian
society.
But despite the widely held perception that
they continue to be universally despised, the
Khmer Rouge maintain significant and in
creasing support in the long-neglected, poor
villages of this ravaged country.
Since the announced pullout of Vietnamese
troops in September, the Khmer Rouge have
seized hundreds of villages in the north, west
and southwest of the country.
Jewish Congress convenes
WEST BERLIN (AP) - World Jewish Con
gress officials said yesterday that economic
hardship has fueled anti-Semitism in Eastern
Europe, and they planned a solemn ceremony
at the site where Nazis plotted the extermina
tion of the Jews.
On the second day of the congress' annual
meeting, a U.S. Justice Department official
said Washington has rejected Austrian Presi
dent Kurt Waldheim's repeated requests for a
lifting of the ban that keeps him out of the
country. The official said the ban remains in
effect because of Waldheim's role in "Nazi
sponsored persecution."
The three-day meeting in Berlin is the Con
gress' first in Germany since the organization
was founded in Switzerland in 1936 amid the
horrors of the Third Reich.
Today, Congress officials will visit Berlin's
Wannsee Villa, where on Jan. 20, 1942, leading
Nazi officials plotted the Third Reich's so
called Final Solution to exterminate Jews
worldwide.
Syria refuses to attend summit
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria announced
yesterday that it will not attend an Arab sum
mit in Baghdad, capital of its archrival Iraq,
hindering efforts to patch up the 11-year-old
feud that has blocked Arab unity.
Officials said Damascus instead proposed
that the foreign ministers of the 22 Arab
league members meet in Tunis to decide on
an alternative summit site.
In Amman, Jordan's King Hussein insisted
the summit be held in Baghdad as planned,
reflecting a deepening rift in the Arab world
over the issue.
"The upcoming Arab summit will be held
in Baghdad and there is no intention what
soever to change the location to somewhere
else," Hussein said in a statement broadcast
by state-run Jordan Television.
"I hope that Arab leaders will work to make
this upcoming summit a successful one and I
also hope that our brethren in Syria and Iraq
will reconcile soon," said Hussein.
The Syrian decision stymied efforts led by
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan to mediate a
reconciliation between Syrian President Hafez
Assad and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
They are the Arab world's most bitter foes.
Unrest ends in Mongolia
BEIJING (AP) — Nearly a week of sit-ins
and hunger strikes in Mongolia ended after
the country's largest opposition group agreed
to a compromise and joined a government ad
visory body, Mongolian radio said yesterday.
The Mongolian Democratic Association
decided late Sunday to join other opposition
groups in accepting a government offer to set
up an advisory council from which they can
submit draft bills and suggestions to the
Communist-dominated legislature.
Shortly after the agreement was reached,
the MDA and its supporters ended hunger
strikes in three cities and sit-ins in the Mon
golian capital of Ulan Bator and several other
cities, Mongolian radio said.
Mongolian President Punsalmaagiin Ochir
bat, meanwhile, flew home from China two
days earlier than planned, but neither the
Chinese nor the Mongolian Embassy gave any
explanation.
He had arrived Friday for a six-day visit
that normalized relations after nearly three
decades of coolness caused by the Chinese-
Soviet split. Mongolia is a Soviet satellite.
Pipeline bursts, starts fire
MOSCOW (AP) — A gas pipeline burst open
and started a fire in western Siberia early
yesterday, the Soviet news agency Tass re
ported.
There was no loss of life or danger to nearby
settlements as a result of the fire, which oc
curred on the Urengoi-Surgut-Chelyabinsk
pipeline in western Siberia, Tass said.
The report did not clarify if the fire had
been controlled. It also did not say what caused
the pipeline to burst.
One guerrilla killed
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli-back,<l
militiamen killed a pro-Syrian guerrilla and
captured another yesterday in a clash in south
Lebanon, the army command said.
One pro-Israeli militiaman was slightly
wounded when guerrillas fired rifles and a
rocket-propelled grenade at a militia patrol
near Beit Yahoun, six miles north of the Israeli
border, the army said.
