# Road to unification open, W. Germany says

BONN, West Germany (AP) â€”
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher said yesterday that the uni
fication process is no longer blocked
by Moscow's stand on NATO, even
though no compromise on a united
Germany's military allegiance has
been worked out.
Meanwhile, East Germany's leader
was quoted as saying he was prepared
to tolerate the continued presence of
Soviet troops on East German soil if
it would help speed the merger.
East German Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere told Die Welt, a Bonn
based newspaper, that "for a certain
amount of time yet there will be a
loss of (German) sovereignty."
But he said the main thing is "unity,
in order to do justice to our people's
wishes."
The comments by Genscher and de
Maiziere follow the "two-plus-four"

unification talks by the two Germanys
and the four World War II victors: the
United States, the Soviet Union, Brit
ain and France.
Saturday's talks, held in Bonn, gave
a boost to German leaders' hopes for
speedy unification.
Die Welt suggested West Germany's
Dec. 2 elections be canceled and all-
German elections held instead, saying
"there are no more difficulties facing
early all-German elections."
But Hans Klein, Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's chief government spokesman,
gave a crisp "no" when asked whether
there were plans to speed up the
timetable for all-German elections by
the second half of next year.
Nonetheless, Kohl's Christian Dem
ocrats and the East German party of
the same name were making prepara
tions to join forces in all-German elec
tions.

Alfred Dregger, parliamentary chair
man of Kohl's Christian Democrats,
and Dregger's East German counter
part, Guenter Krause, met yesterday
and said the two parties want to unite
"in the next few months."
During Saturday's six-nation talks,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shev
ardnadze renewed Moscow's staunch
opposition to NATO membership for
a united Germany, calling instead for
creation of new European security
structures.
But he also told his Wes rn coun
terparts that the settlement of internal
and external aspects of German unity
"do not necessarily have to come at
the same time," the West German
Foreign Ministry said.
Genscher said although the issue of
NATO membership has not been
settled, the issue is no longer an ob
stacle to unity.

"The unification process itself will
not be impeded by consultations over
the external aspects" of merging the
two Germanys, he told Deutsch
landfunk radio.
"All participants were agreed that
the German unification process can
be consummated and that no temporal
barriers will be placed before it. With
that, the important decision of Ger
man unification is left in German
hands," he said.
The Soviet news agency Novosti yes
terday quoted Shevardnadze as saying
at the Bonn meeting that Moscow "is
for Germans' right of self
determination."
But, according to Novosti, he also
said the four victorious allies should
retain their post-war rights in Ger
many until the matter of military al
legiances is worked out.
