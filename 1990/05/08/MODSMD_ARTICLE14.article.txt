# Pope addresses 200,000 on conditions for urban poor

CHALCO, Mexico (AP) â€” Pope
John Paul 11, speaking to a joyous
crowd in one of Mexico's poorest cities,
said yesterday that living conditions
for Latin America's urban poor con
stitute an urgent call to carry out the
church's teachings.
"We cannot live and sleep peacefully
while thousands of our brothers, very
near to us, lack the necessities for a
dignified human life," John Paul told
about 200,000 worshippers gathered
in a muddy field 25 miles southeast
of Mexico City.
Thousands waved yellow banners,
and mariachi bands played "Cielito
Lindo" or "Beautiful Sky," as the pope

swept in by helicopter, although gray
clouds sometimes obscured the mas
sive, snow-capped volcanic cones of
Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl.
The crowd was smaller than pre
dicted, cut down by hours of rain that
lasted into the early morning and
turned the normally dusty valley to
mud.
The theme of the pope's Mass was
"The Good Shepherd." Seated at a
microphone next to a giant crucifix
under a yellow-and-white canopy, John
Paul told the crowd that the good shep
herd could be distinguished from mer
cenaries "because he is ready to give
his life for his sheep."

"Jesus Christ, being rich, made him
self poor to enrich us with his poverty,"
said the pope.
He called on all Christians and all
"men of good will" to put into action
the church's "preferential option for
the poor," first expounded in Puebla,
50 miles east of here, on John Paul's
first visit to Mexico in 1979.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
has made a point of improving life in
Chalco, which has expanded from a
population of 6,000 in 1975 to more
than 60,000 today as poor peasants
migrate to Mexico City's vast urban
sprawl. Salinas went to Chalco earlier
this year to dedicate new electric lines

sewers and running water.
John Paul met with Salinas before
flying to Chalco, but neither made any
statements afterward. The two ex
changed gifts, the pope giving Salinas
three medallions and receiving three
books in return.
As the pope was leaving for a
helicopter ride to Chalco, a young
woman broke through security lines
and hugged him. She was quickly
hustled away by guards.
In a gesture that indicated warmer
church-state relations lie ahead,
Salinas changed plans at the last min
ute and met the pontiff at the airport
Sunday instead of sending his foreign
minister.
Salinas, greeting the pope, said:
"Your visit is a new encounter with
the generosity of a nation of many
cultures, plural visions and deep reli
gious sentiments."
Since he took office two years ago,
Salinas has encouraged improved ties
with the Vatican, while officials have
widely ignored strict decades-old laws
that intend to keep the church out of
politics.
In February, Salinas named a per
sonal representative to the Vatican, a
sign the diplomatic ties Mexico severed
in 1926 might soon be restored.
During his 13-hour flight to Mexico,
the Polish-born pope told reporters his
trip was "something new and very im
portant ... We are making efforts to
improve relations between the state
and the church."
The Roman Catholic Church backed
the ruling classes against Mexico's na
tive population in the 19th century,
which is why restrictions on the church
were written into the constitution dur
ing the country's 1910-1920 revolution.
The 1917 constitution denies
recognition to the church and bars
priests from speaking about politics
from the pulpit or wearing robes in
public. The church is also barred from
owning property.
But Mexico is a country where some
independence leaders were priests, and
where the Catholic church claims 90
percent of Mexico's 85 million people.
