# Latvia will respect Soviet interests, Parliament says

### 
RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) — Latvia's Par
liament today assured Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev that despite the
republic's declaration of independence,
it will respect Soviet interests and
hopes to open talks soon.
The parliament's message was in re
sponse to a request from Gorbachev
for information on Latvia's May 4 dec
laration of independence.
"We express the certainty that the
character of the declaration, the reten
tion of current constitutional norms
and sincere desire to respect the in
terests of the U.S.S.R. will meet with
your understanding and open the way
to a fruitful dialogue in the spirit of
honest cooperation between equals,"
the letter to Gorbachev said.
Latvian president Anatoly Gorbunov
had told the parliament this morning
of the Kremlin's request and charged
several deputies with preparing a rep
ly.

Dainis Ivans, chairman of the Lat
vian Popular Front, which has led the
independence drive, called Gorbachev's
request for more information "won
derful."
"This gives us a chance to present
our point of view," he told reporters.
Ivans said Latvia also planned to
send a delegation to Moscow within
days, and he believed the group would
be received by the Kremlin.
Delegates from Lithuania, which has
also voted to secede, went through a
similar exchange with the Kremlin but
to no avail.
Unlike Lithuania, however, Latvia
did not suspend the Soviet constitution
when it declared independence, instead
merely adding several sections calling
for independence and democracy.
Gorbunov and other Latvian leaders
have said the republic's declaration,
with its unspecified transition period
to full independence, is calculated to

"leave the door open" to talks with
the Kremlin.
They said today the Kremlin's re
quest for an explanation indicated
Moscow's reaction might not be as
stong as initially indicated.
Latvia's Communist Party chief,
Alfreds Rubiks, had said Saturday that
Gorbachev might retaliate because of
the secession vote.
The Soviet news agency Tass quoted
Rubiks as saying in a statement on
television that Gorbachev told him the
vote violated the Soviet Constitution.
Gorbachev said in a telephone call he
might impose political, economic and
administrative sanctions if the Baltic
republic didn't reverse its course,
Rubiks reported.
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Gen
nady Gerasimov, at a briefing today,
declined to answer questions about
Latvia. "There is no official response
yet," he said.

He said Rubik's statement was "not
a direct response" to the republic's
declaration of independence.
Neighboring Lithuania declared im
mediate independence from Moscow on
March 11, and Gorbachev responded
by sending troops to occupy some Com
munist Party buildings and by cutting
off fuel and other vital supplies.
The third Baltic republic, Estonia,
last month declared its intention to
secede but set no date and left the
door open for negotiations with the
Kremlin.
As the Latvian Parliament convened
today, about 50 Soviet soldiers ap
proached the building and unfurled a
red banner reading, "Comrades! Have
No Doubt We Will Defend the Interests
of the U.S.S.R. With Honor."
Several Latvians, incensed by the
ominous tone of the slogan, shouted,
"Shame!" in Russian at the soldiers.
The argument remained peaceful.
