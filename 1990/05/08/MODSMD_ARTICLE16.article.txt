Chair's claim scorned
DALLAS (AP) — Greyhound
Lines' chairman said yesterday that
the 2-month-old strike by bus drivers
was "irrelevant" and effectively over.
But strikers scoffed at the claim, and
one compared it to Napoleon declar
ing victory at Waterloo.
"The strike is in effect concluded
from the point of view of day-to-day
operations," Greyhound Lines Inc.
Chairman Fred Currey told
reporters. He declared "a new day in
the life of the new Greyhound."
Some union officials claimed Cur
rey's statement was a publicity stunt
to scare striking drivers back to work
at the nation'B only inter-city bus
company. "It's a common ploy to try

to scare a few more strikers into
scabbing by announcing that there's
no hope," said AFL-CIO spokesman
Rex Hardesty.
The company'B latest contract offer
had included the elimination of 4,500
union jobs, a change from per-mile
wage rates to hourly wage rates, plus
a four-year wage freeze. The union
called the proposal, made Saturday,
an "insult," and officials refused to
present it to membership. No further
talks were scheduled.
