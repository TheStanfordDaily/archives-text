## Chance for input 
### 
IF YOU CARE about dorm com
puter clusters, Stanford-In-
Tours, the CPPC or any other
aspect of campus that is threatened
by the budget cuts, this is your
chance to be heard.
Tomorrow night at 7 p.m., an
open meeting will be held in Bran
ner Hall to discuss the budget
repositioning process, and students
are invited to bring their opinions
and worries to the attention of the
decision makers. This is a unique
opportunity for anyone concerned
about the cuts, which will affect
every Stanford student, to have his
or her voice heard.
In attendance will be Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons, Vice
President and Provost James
Rosse, Vice President for Admin
istrative Resources Susan Schaffer
and Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Carolyn Lougee. They
are scheduled to field questions
and concerns for an hour and a

half, giving everyone ample time
to have their voices heard.
If you cannot make the open
meeting in person, it will also be
broadcast live on KZSU.
As the final decisions on budget
cuts are being made, student input
is crucial. With four of the top
decision makers attending this
forum, one couldn't hope for an
easier means of providing that in
put. We urge any concerned stu
dents to attend.
The groups who will bring this
meeting about should also be
thanked: Branner Hall, KZSU and
Innovative Academic Courses or
ganized the meeting and are pro
viding the moderator.
Finally, don't forget that there
is still time to write a letter to
Provost Rosse with any further in
put you'd like to offer. An effective
"repositioning" depends on having
the clearest possible picture of
what students want to keep.
