# Cleaning up

The statistics are
awesome — that's awesome,
as in fear inspiring.
The University's environmental
health is partially documented in
the preliminary report of the Stan
ford Environmental Audit, a stu
dent project, and the results are
not too encouraging.
For example, the report says
Stanford produced 273,000 pounds
of hazardous waste last year, cos
ting $673,000 for treatment and
disposal. Only 16 percent of the
chemical waste was recycled.
Stanford also generated 19,348
tons of solid waste last year. The
recycling program is in full swing
at Stanford, but it takes more than
the Recycling Center's efforts to
preserve the resources used and

discarded by the Stanford commu
nity.
But to say that all is bad with
Stanford's environmental program
would be a terrible blow to the
University's commitment to some
important environmental issues.
For example, Stanford has been
very efficient with energy use.
Water-saving devices are com
monly used, even if they do not
save the University money.
Also, although it has yet to
produce tangible results, the Uni
versity has given a verbal commit
ment to cut down on trans
portation problems.
Stanford has already taken a few
positive steps toward environmen
tal consciousness. It just has a few
giant leaps to go.
