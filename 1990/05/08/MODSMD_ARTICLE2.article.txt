# Standard proposal enters next phase
## SCLC votes in favor of interpretation 
### Rob Baedeker Staff writer 
After a monthlong public com
ment period, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council yesterday
voted once again in favor of a
revised interpretation of the Fun
damental Standard, bringing the
proposal one step closer to imple
mentation.
The proposal, written by Law
Prof. Thomas Grey, would make
it a violation of the Fundamental
Standard to use insulting or fight
ing words of a discriminatory na
ture aimed directly to stigmatize
an individual or a small group of
individuals.
The SCLC will republish the
proposal with minor revisions this
Thursday in The Daily, and an
other 14-day comment period will
follow. The SCLC will meet again
May 24 for a final vote.
The proposal was originally ap
proved by a 9-2 vote on March
14, allowing it to be placed before
the public for comment. This time
it was approved by a margin of
8-3.
Law Prof. Robert Rabin, SCLC
chair, said that since the period
of comment opened, the commit
tee has received about 35 written
responses. He said he interpreted
25 of those responses as against
the proposal and 10 in favor of it.
Committee members discussed
the written responses and other
issues for about an hour before
voting yesterday.
Rabin, who voted for the pro
posal, said he believes that "cer
tain narrow restrictions" on free

speech are neces
sary and that the
problem of racism
should be ad
dressed now.
"You don't wait
until the problem
has come to frui
tion to regulate
it," Rabin said.
Mechanical En-

gineering Prof. Tom Kane voiced
disapproval for the proposal, say
ing it would "institute speech con
trol at Stanford."
Student member Ed Sasaki said
there has been a historical "evolu
tion" of the Fundamental Stand
ard. He explained that just as
clarifications were added to deal
with cheating and organized
protest, the time has come for a
clarification of the issue of racism.
Constantino Pena, another stu
dent member of the committee,
changed his previous vote to a
negative one. He said he now feels
the proposal would do "more
harm than good."
"Are we here to prosecute or
educate?" Pena asked, explaining
that he thought discussion is the
key to changing attitudes, rather
than establishing another set of
rules.
Rabin also clarified a statement
from a May 4 Daily article on the
Faculty Senate's discusssion of
the SCLC proposal. He said that
last year's Ujamaa incident, in
which students posted a racially
offensive flier outside another stu
dent's door, would be a "tough
case" under the new proposal
rather than a clear violation.
