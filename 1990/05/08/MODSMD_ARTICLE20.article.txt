Bartending class teaches intervention techniques

ANDREW GOLD OF the Center
for Teaching and Learning re
cently wrote a letter which con
tained a host of inaccuracies. Gold, as
he stated in his letter, felt compelled
to express his concern over the ASSU
bartending class.
He inferred that the ASSU had done
a poor job of planning for Bartending
101 because it had failed to include as
a major component of the course "ser
ver intervention techniques" and the
many serious negative consequences of
alcohol consumption. His assertion is
patently false.
Gold, while bringing to the general
forefront many good points as to the
consequences of alcohol abuse in his
letter, did not feel compelled to ade
quately research his allegations prior to
writing his letter.
A full 15 to 20 percent of class time

Michael Risch made it clear from our very first
contract that it was very important to the ASSU
that server intervention techniques and respon
sible alcohol consumption be made a major
component of the course.

is spent covering the issues that Gold
stated were not covered at all. If Gold
had bothered to obtain a copy of the
syllabus, attend a single class or simply
make a phone call to the instructor, he
would have quickly realized that his
concerns were without merit.
When I asked him over the tele
phone why he didn't bother to do a
better job researching the content of

the class, Gold replied that he "didn't
feel that it was necessary."
The ASSU, in contrast to Gold's
inaccurate assumptions, was very
responsible in ensuring that the prob
lems of alcohol consumption would be
a mÂ£yor topic in the class.
Michael Risch, special projects coordi
nator for the ASSU, made it clear
from our very first contract that it

was very important to the ASSU that
server intervention techniques and
responsible alcohol consumption be
made a rrnyor component of the course.
As a matter of fact, these topics
have always been a major component
of the course (This is the seventh time
that I have taught this course for the
ASSU over the past five years.)
When I first started teaching Bar
tending 101, it was the only forum at
Stanford where reponsible alcohol
consumption and server intervention
were actively taught.
I hope that this letter has served to
accurately inform the Stanford commu
nity that the ASSU has been responsi
ble in sponsoring the Bartending 101
class and to allay any fears that may
have arisen from Gold's inaccurate
assertions.
