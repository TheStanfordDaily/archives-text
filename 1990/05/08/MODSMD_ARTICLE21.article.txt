# SCLC proposal defends basic value of respectful debate
## 
### 
The Daily's Friday, May 4 report of
the Faculty Senate discussion of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
proposal concerning the Fundamental
Standard did not quite capture the
logic of my remarks.
I made three points which I regard
as important but often overlooked in
the public debates. First, I pointed out
that while the U.S. Consitution refers
to citizens, the Fundamental Standard
refers to good citizens — quite a differ
ent kettle of fish. Stanford, then, for
many decades has expected faculty,
staff and students to be better than
what the Constitution requires.
Thus it is no argument against the

new proposal that it is tougher than
the Constitution.
Second, the new proposal does not
limit speech in any way, but rather it
fully protects it. The proposal defines
as illegitimate, at Stanford University,
those sorts of extreme behaviors
(outrageous verbal abuse that is de
signed only to incite anger and hurt)
that signify that discussion has been
broken off.
In effect, the SCLC proposal makes
clear that at Stanford we value debate
over ideas, not the abandonment of
discussion and a retreat to "fighting
words" and deliberately hurtful racial
insults.
Finally, I pointed out that no one is
forced to come to Stanford. We have a
duty to make our values clear, and
those who do not accept them should
stay away.
We should hold fast to the values
that make education and the pursuit

of knowledge possible — the respectful
(but forceful) debate and examination
of all viewpoints. And in my view the
SCLC document defends this basic
value of a university.
