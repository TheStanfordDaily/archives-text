# Football coach supports creation of yell leaders
## 
### 
A yell-leading squad is needed at
Stanford football games. I have only
been back at Stanford for 17 months,
but it is clear that more fan involve
ment will add to the atmosphere, ex
citement, pageantry and appreciation of
the team in Stanford Stadium.
Our team is looking for the assis-

tance that comes from organized par
ticipation by supporters who want to
show their support during the course
of the game.
A coed leading squad comprised of
Stanford students has my endorsement
as a worthwhile and needed extracur
ricular activity. Duke University, the
University of Virginia, Notre Dame
and UCLA are four schools, to name a
few, who have been able to continue
organized enthusiastic cheering and
card display sections with students and
alumni.
Stanford operates the most exten
sively broad-based athletics, intramural
and extracurricular programs in the
country. I hope that the Stanford stu
dents who are on the squad will also
benefit from this experience, as they
will be further proof that Stanford is
not afraid of change.
