## Implementing a new peace 
### 
RARELY HAS A country so small
as Israel claimed so much of the
world's attention. The Arab-Israeli
conflict has been near the top of every
one's agenda since the inception of the
Jewish state, and yet the countless efforts
by well-meaning diplomats have met
nothing but boundless futility. The in
tifada rages on, and there is no peace.
Given the perpetual lack of success in
this area of American foreign policy, I
will offer my thoughts on this issue as
the "Grant Plan" for resolving the inter
mittent war in the occupied territories.
The principles are:
• Permanent Occupation — The per
manent occupation of the territories ac
quired in the 1967 war is untenable,
• Compromise — Neither party (Israel
nor the Palestinians) can insist upon the
absolute priority of its interests: peace
without victory,
• Land for peace — The resolution of
this conflict should follow the formula of
the Camp David Accords. Moreover, ne
gotiations would be pointless if nothing
is on the table,
• Israel must negotiate with the Pal
estinian Liberation Organization — The
so-called Palestinian "moderates" with
whom Israel wishes to negotiate have
never been found. For better or for worse,
Yasir Arafat is the Palestinisn leader,
• Renouncing Terrorism — The PLO
must keep its renunciation of terrorism
pledge that it made in December 1988.
Talks must be conducted in the presence
of a cease-fire,
• The role of other Arab nations —

The countries of the Arab League must
also start easing tensions with Israel,
paralleling the Israeli/Palestinian rela
tionship. It is incumbent on countries
like Algeria, Jordan and Egypt to cool
the fanaticism of the more belligerent
nations, such as Iraq and Libya,
• Jerusalem — Israel must recognize
the sacred value of Jerusalem to all re
ligions, not just Judaism.
The mechanisms are:
• Settlement of occupied territories —
Israel must forestall additional settle
ment of the occupied territories, espe
cially in East Jerusalem,
• Israel must guarantee access to
Jerusalem — This holy city cannot be
the sole property of Israel. It ought to
return to its pre-1967 status, thus remov
ing an important source of conflict. This
would also be a great gesture showing
Israel's tolerance and respect for other
beliefs,
• No International Peace Conference
— Such a high-profile event ought to
give way to quiet diplomacy. It would
place too much pressure on results, with
each party pressed to show tangible gains
for its constituents. This sort of atmos
phere could torpedo the whole process.
Finally, such a forum has the tendency
to be a soap box for speeches, not a
format for diplomacy,
• The 20-Year Plan — Rather than a
single and immediate transfer of the oc
cupied territories, the lands ought to be
given back in three parts over a period
of 20 years. Following negotiations, one
third of all of the occupied territories

will be ceded over. After a 10-year period,
the next third will be transferred. Fol
lowing another 10-year period, the final
third will be given back. This extended
timetable will provide the Palestinians
with huge incentives to maintain the
peace and will provide stability and the
building of trust between the two parties.
This mechanism will ensure Israel's se
curity and allow it to maintain a large
degree of control over the process,
• Palestinian State — The logical con
clusion of "land for peace" is the creation
of a Palestinian state that exists not just
in theory, but in fact. It would seem
disingenuous to suggest that this people
does not have a legitimate right to a
state. The PLO must also realize that
this places even greater responsibility on
it to act with temperance and wisdom.
While this framework that I have laid
out does not completely satisfy anyone,
it is a compromise that balances the se
curity interests of the concerned parties.
But if each side insists upon the ig
nominious defeat of its rival, we may
never see the end of this spiral of hatred
and violence.
