## Michael Stevenson One man's acceptance of his identity as a gay man 
### 
I RODE MY bike to the beach the
other day. It felt good to be out
doors and on the road, with the
wind in my hair and nature's beautiful
hills and fields around me, covered in
blankets of yellow and green.
Then I was at ocean's edge, where
cold waves crashed before me, their
neverending voices whispering in my
ears. A certain peacefulness settled
over me; I was at ease as I could be
nowhere else.
God or whoever created all this was
sharing it with me and not caring
about my gender, race or creed. This
was the reason for my escape from
Stanford and the crowds, so I could
write to you honestly and from my
soul, without bitterness, anger or
resentment.
You see, I'm gay. No surprise there
— I've known it all my life. Strangers
glancing at me wouldn't guess. I'm
your average Joe Schmoe, part of the
woodwork, avoider of spotlights. I had
my whole life to master that technique
But inside, I cry out. Why was I
created this way? I didn't choose this
lifestyle, I don't want it, I deny it,
renounce it, dammit all! Who could I
blame? God? Society? My family?
Myself?
What a bitter pill to swallow! Either
pretend that I didn't feel more at-

tracted to men than women and be
forever miserable and alone, or accept
it and live my life aa it was meant to
be, in a loving and intimate relation
ship with a man. I've chosen to follow
the latter road. I really had no choice.
A lot of families were at the beach
that day. I saw parents watching their
children play at the ocean's edge,
smiles on their faces, and I wondered
how deep their love ran for them.
Deep enough to open their arms if one
future day their son or daughter ap
proached them in defiance, or fear, and
said, "Mom, Dad, I'm gay."? Do par
ents ever consider the possibility that
homosexuality could become a part of
their lives?
Bitch time now. What is so wrong
with being attracted to the same sex?
Why did I have to grow up feeling
ashamed and guilty about my feelings
for other men? As long as two consent
ing adults are happy with each other,
that's all that should matter in this
world.
People complain that gays flaunt
themselves in front of everyone else
and that it's disgusting to witness two
men or women kissing or holding
hands. But doesn't the straight world
flaunt its sexuality on television, in the
papers and on the streets? Shouldn't
we complain about that, too? Or is it

that we've grown up seeing heterosexu
ality as normal and acceptable and
that what's normal is safe?
Words like racism, minorities and
homophobia should not exist in our
dictionary, yet they do. One neglected
minority that has had to constantly
conform to society's standards is left
handed people. In "Looking at Gay and
Lesbian Life," authors Blumenfeld and
Raymond point out a number of
similarities between homosexuality and
left-handedness (no intent, of course, to
correlate the two).
For example, one out of every 10
people is left-handed; this is the same
for same-sex attractions. What righties
take for granted (i.e. cutting with
scissors, writing from left to right)
causes uncomfortable adjustments for
lefties. Dating, holding hands in public
and discussing boy/girlfriends with
parents and friends have also required
conformations for gays that
straights will never know.
Yet even with these burdens, many
famous people are hallmarked in each
of these groups: In the lefties we have
Judy Garland, Harpo Marx, Paul
McCartney and Caroline Kennedy; in
the same-sex attraction group are
Michelangelo, T.E. Lawrence, Virginia
Woolf and Leonard Bernstein. Obvi
ously these people have not allowed

their "afflictions" to become a burden
or handicap, but perhaps rather an
asset.
For myself, being gay has made me
more sensitive and compassionate to
others' feelings and needs, as well as
to my own, and that's a gift I wouldn't
trade for anything — not even for that
magic horsepill that would make me
straight.
During Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week I want to write on how I came
to this point in my life, of my accept
ing who I was and how my family and
friends responded. I also want to talk
about AIDS and how the disease af
fects both gay and straight lifestyles.
Why bare myself to you like this?
Because. Because I want to get rid of
my anger toward a society that, for
the most part, doesn't accept me for
who I am. Because a lot of homopho
bia still exists, partly out of prejudice,
and partly out of fear of the unknown,
of what homosexuality really is about,
of that hidden identity that could be in
your sibling, your roommate, your
closest friend or yourself.
And most importantly, because a lot
of young men and women are under
standably afraid to come out of the
closet — maybe this will make it a
little easier for them to cope with their

feelings.
At the beach, I saw several couples
holding hands as they walked along
ocean's edge. Their heads were bent
close, oblivious to anything but their
happiness and love for each other.
A pang of envy went through me as
I thought how I couldn't walk along
that edge with my lover and feel the
world's favor. But then I smiled, for I
finally realized that I was in control of
my life, my destiny — not society. I
too can walk along that edge .. . and
beyond.

four-part series on his feelings about
being gay.
