Two new books offer more light
and a well-rounded look at the
life and work of American poet
John Berryman. Berryman, who
won both the National Book
Award and the Pulitzer Prize,
committed suicide in 1972 at the
age of 58.
Following in his father's foot
steps, Berryman jumped to his
death from a bridge over a frozen
river near where he taught at the
University of Minnesota; his
father shot himself outside his
son's window in Florida when
John was not quite 12 years old.
Charles Thornbury's "The Col
lected Poems of John Berryman,
1937-71," edited with an intro
duction of 43 pages, is a collection
of six of Berryman's books of
verse, along with his early an
thologized poems from "Five
Young American Poets."
This compendium, released in
the winter of 1989, has been

referred to as the definitive edi
tion of Berryman 's work. Un
fortunately, it lacks his greatest
work, "The Dream Songs." With
out these, Berryman'B work seems
presented at something much less
than full power.
The introduction, however, is
insightful, placing Berryman's
work in relation to the major
poets of the English language, in
cluding Shakespeare, Keats, Whit
man and Yeats. It also mentions
early influences and similarities
with Auden, while mentioning
contemporaries Robert Lowell
and Elizabeth Bishop.
English Prof. Albert Gelpi, who
corresponded with Berryman
prior to his suicide, recently
referred to Berryman as a "great
assimilator" who was idio
syncratic in his use of slang, dic
tion and colloquialisms. He most
often cited 19th-century American
poet Walt Whitman as the poet
Berryman was most akin to.
Gelpi thought Berryman a
20th-century man in the same
Whitman was a 19th
century man. Both were obsessed
with being a poet, and both men's
work revealed a "vital connection"

between "life and art."
Berryman's work is the
"record" of a "divided, anxiety
ridden self" revealing both his "ec
centricities and insecurity." Gelpi
reflected that Berryman's work as
an artist helped him "stave-off
madness and suicide," while
toward the end of his life his
poems became "deeply religious"
in their consideration of the es
sentials of "belief and grace."
Gelpi recalled with fondness Ber
ryman's "shaky handwriting."
What makes Berryman's poems
enjoyable to the average reader is
his inclusion of his own experience
and personality presented in the
first person and through various
masks. These masks are his
created characters, most notably
Henry or Mr. Bones. With these
shifting personas offering differ
ing psychological perspectives on
life, we find the poet's voice re
sembles both the conscience
tortured Hamlet and the driven
Macbeth.
The "Collected Poems" offers a
window to the tortured searchings
of a deeply troubled soul. The
work is important both for an
understanding of our own modern
existence and as lasting literature.
