# Biography sheds light on Berryman's character 'warts and all'
## 
### Paul Mariani 
Dreamsong, The Life of John Berryman

The nature of Berryman's work and
life make a full biographical treatment
necessary, but biographers had to wrestle
with the dilemma of what material was
necessary for a proper and fair biograp
hial treatment.
"Dreamsong, The Life of John Ber
ryman" by Paul Mariani does capture
Berryman's spirit, which often swung
from utter despair to giddy joy and

laughter. Berryman did wish us to laugh
while reading his poems, and this biog
raphy is true to Berryman's character,
"warts and all." The book seems to be
full of his manic energy and humor.
Mariani's book captures both Ber
ryman's best and worst characteristics.
It captures the best of Berryman, in the
sense that "The Sonnets" reveal the poet
at the mercy of his desire to create high
art. To do this, Berryman incorporates
an ancient form and theme: the 14-line
love poem.
While "The Sonnets" lack the humor
of "The Dream Songs," they do reveal
an artist at work. We also see the artifacts

of the poet's troubled existence. We see
his problems with alcohol, women, guilt
and artistic creation all mixed together.
"The Sonnets" take on the tradition of
Petrarch and Shakespeare, while written
in an American vernacular with local
place names.
"In early June, (Robert) Lowell visited
the Berrymans again. They lunched at
Lahierre's, then spent the afternoon play
ing outdoors at Chris' house, where they
drank heavily and romped shoeless on
the grass. At one point, Berryman
climbed the sycamore on Chris's front
lawn, then watched Lowell race about
below him, hunched over, grunting 'like

a caveman and throwing beer cans and
shoes.' Suddenly Lowell was climbing the
sycamore, pushing his way past Ber
ryman to get to the very top to crown
himself king of the mountain."
This excerpt from Mariani's biography
illuminates some of the competitiveness
between the poets Robert Lowell and
John Berryman. It also illuminates
"Dream Song #1," which is missing from
"The Collected Poems," a recently re
leased anthology of Berryman's work.
Chris is the young woman Berryman was
having an affair with and it was she who
inspired "The Sonnets."
Berryman's lifelong obsessions with

loss and suffering seem to be tied to his
credo as a writer to suffer a blow so
powerful that it would do the most pos
sible damage.
"The Sonnets," of which there are 117,
document an adulterous affair. They
helped hasten the end of his first mar
riage and were not published until 19
years after their original composition.
While Berryman comes to faith in God
toward the end of his life, his inability
to escape alcoholism seems to have been
his undoing. In one of his last books,
"Love & Fame," Berryman embraces God
with his "Eleven Addresses to the Lord."
