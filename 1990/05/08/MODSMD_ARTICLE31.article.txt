Magic realism, tragic fairy tale. We i
usually don't expect to hear of something i
as being both magical and realistic; we <
certainly don't expect to hear about fairy <
tales that approach the pathos of tragedy.
Yet, these paradoxical terms most appro
priately describe Mark Helprin's latest
publication, his magic-realist adaptation
of Tchaikovsky's classic ballet, "Swan
Lake." In his "Swan Lake," Helprin
blends impossible (or at least highly im
probable) fairy tale events with a sober
vision of life tinged with tragic realism
and believable optimism. Chris Van Al
lsburg's luminous illustrations beauti
fully evoke Helprin's magic-realist world
of dazzling emotional color and intensity.
An old man represents Helprin's voice
in this retelling of "Swan Lake." This
old man and a young girl — an orphan
whom he has adopted — live in exile in
a lofty forest nestled among high moun
tains. The old man, knowing that his
foster daughter has reached the age when
she wants to know about the world and,
most importantly, about her parents and

her identity, reveals her family history.
He tells how the emperor once sum
moned him to court and how he, a humble
manager of a turkey farm who writes
articles on myriad subjects, became the
emperor's secret adviser on the affairs of
the kingdom. The old narrator details
the vicious political rivalries and extrav
agant, shallow materialism of the court,
clearly reminding us of the shortcomings
of our own modern societies.
The power-hungry court counselor Von
Rothbart "controlled several divisions
and key garrisons of the army he had
his hand deep in the treasury, and he
was the director of the secret police.
Everyone in the empire was afraid of
him." Without question, Von Rothbart
embodies the megalomania of our world's
dictators.
Knowing Von Rothbart's relentless,
heinous ambitions, the emperor arranges
for the narrator to tutor secretly his only
son, hoping that upon maturity his son
will be able to depose Von Rothbart and
end his reign of terror. After the emperor
dies, Von Rothbart seizes total imperial
control. In order to deceive Von Rothbart

about their mission of justice,

the narrator and the

young prince pre
tend to be

drunk and effeminate, thereby mislead
ing Von Rothbart to believe that they
represent no threat to his power.
During a hunting expedition, the prince
comes upon a beautiful lake full of danc
ing swans that offer him a remarkable
vision: The swans' "dance was the perfect
union of delirium and control, of purity
and abandon, of nature and civilization.
How did they put together so gentle a
thing with so much power, so powerful
a thing with so much grace?"
The vision is so beautiful that it over
whelms him, and he loses consciousness.
He wakes up and finds himself in the
hut of Odette, the story's beautiful
heroine. Because Von Rothbart killed her
parents, Odette is an orphan. Quite
predictably, she and the prince fall im
mediately in love with each other.
Later, however, the prince, in a moment
of weakness, betrays this love when he
succumbs to the entrancing beauty of
Odile, a cold-hearted ice queen who re
sembles Odette. The prince marries her
and thereby chooses the life of the court,
abandoning the mission of justice which
his father planned for him.
What redeems the prince from the spir
itual poverty of the court and from his

own betrayal of his life's purpose is an
other unexpected confrontation with
beauty.
During another hunting trip, the prince
sees a procession of swans swimming
toward him and his hunters. Entranced
by their beauty, the prince orders his
men not to shoot the swans. But Von
Rothbart's lieutenants disobey, shoot the
swans, and are in turn slain by the en
raged prince. The outbreak of violence
motivates Von Rothbart to declare war
against the prince. The prince no longer
cares for political rivalry and domination;
now, he only yearns for transcendent
"light, sound, and color . . . another
realm," the realm of love and imagina
tion. He realizes this desire by returning
to Odette, who, since their first meeting,
has borne him a daughter.
Realizing that Von Rothbart's mighty
armies will destroy their family, the
prince and Odette divert Von Rothbart's
attention toward themselves in order to
save their only child. Von Rothbart's ar
chers chase the couple to the edge of a
high cliff, and, rather than suffering to
be slain by arrows, the couple "looked
into one another's eyes, held tight, and
leaned into the wind." While the young
couple diverts Von Rothbart's forces, a
woman — Odette's friend — escapes with

Odette's infant daughter unnoticed. As
we may have suspected, this infant child
is the daughter whom the narrator has
adopted.
Whether the prince and Odette fall to
their deaths remains a problem. In watch
ing the couple fall from the cliff, the
narrator claims that the couple "did not
tumble or become entangled; they fell
with what appeared to be increasing slow
ness. They fell as if they knew how to
take to the air. . . in smooth, dampened
curves that promised flight." Later, two
magnificent swans rise from below the
clifT.
We are left with this speculation on a
miracle and a gentle caution about dis
missing it: "All proof, all reason, show
them to have fallen ... But in this world
there are as well wrenching and great
surprises that take us beyond what we
can reason and what we can prove."
Implicitly, Helprin asks us to consider
important metaphysical concerns like the
nature and existence of God, the problem
of evil and justice, the power of love and
sacrifice. His rendition of "Swan Lake"
generates a dialectic between childhood
innocence and adult realities: Helprin
suggests that the abridgement of both
worlds via the wings of the imagination
may enrich our lives.

foster daughter has reached the age when
she wants to know about the world and,
most importantly, about her parents and

her identity, reveals her family history.
He tells how the emperor once sum
moned him to court and how he, a humble
manager of a turkey farm who writes
articles on myriad subjects, became the
emperor's secret adviser on the affairs of
the kingdom. The old narrator details
the vicious political rivalries and extrav
agant, shallow materialism of the court,
clearly reminding us of the shortcomings
of our own modern societies.
The power-hungry court counselor Von
Rothbart "controlled several divisions
and key garrisons of the army he had
his hand deep in the treasury, and he
was the director of the secret police.
Everyone in the empire was afraid of
him." Without question, Von Rothbart
embodies the megalomania of our world's
dictators.
Knowing Von Rothbart's relentless,
heinous ambitions, the emperor arranges
for the narrator to tutor secretly his only
son, hoping that upon maturity his son
will be able to depose Von Rothbart and
end his reign of terror. After the emperor
dies, Von Rothbart seizes total imperial
control. In order to deceive Von Rothbart

about their mission of justice,

the narrator and the

young prince pre
tend to be

drunk and effeminate, thereby mislead
ing Von Rothbart to believe that they
represent no threat to his power.
During a hunting expedition, the prince
comes upon a beautiful lake full of danc
ing swans that offer him a remarkable
vision: The swans' "dance was the perfect
union of delirium and control, of purity
and abandon, of nature and civilization.
How did they put together so gentle a
thing with so much power, so powerful
a thing with so much grace?"
The vision is so beautiful that it over
whelms him, and he loses consciousness.
He wakes up and finds himself in the
hut of Odette, the story's beautiful
heroine. Because Von Rothbart killed her
parents, Odette is an orphan. Quite
predictably, she and the prince fall im
mediately in love with each other.
Later, however, the prince, in a moment
of weakness, betrays this love when he
succumbs to the entrancing beauty of
Odile, a cold-hearted ice queen who re
sembles Odette. The prince marries her
and thereby chooses the life of the court,
abandoning the mission of justice which
his father planned for him.
What redeems the prince from the spir
itual poverty of the court and from his

own betrayal of his life's purpose is an
other unexpected confrontation with
beauty.
During another hunting trip, the prince
sees a procession of swans swimming
toward him and his hunters. Entranced
by their beauty, the prince orders his
men not to shoot the swans. But Von
Rothbart's lieutenants disobey, shoot the
swans, and are in turn slain by the en
raged prince. The outbreak of violence
motivates Von Rothbart to declare war
against the prince. The prince no longer
cares for political rivalry and domination;
now, he only yearns for transcendent
"light, sound, and color . . . another
realm," the realm of love and imagina
tion. He realizes this desire by returning
to Odette, who, since their first meeting,
has borne him a daughter.
Realizing that Von Rothbart's mighty
armies will destroy their family, the
prince and Odette divert Von Rothbart's
attention toward themselves in order to
save their only child. Von Rothbart's ar
chers chase the couple to the edge of a
high cliff, and, rather than suffering to
be slain by arrows, the couple "looked
into one another's eyes, held tight, and
leaned into the wind." While the young
couple diverts Von Rothbart's forces, a
woman — Odette's friend — escapes with

Odette's infant daughter unnoticed. As
we may have suspected, this infant child
is the daughter whom the narrator has
adopted.
Whether the prince and Odette fall to
their deaths remains a problem. In watch
ing the couple fall from the cliff, the
narrator claims that the couple "did not
tumble or become entangled; they fell
with what appeared to be increasing slow
ness. They fell as if they knew how to
take to the air. . . in smooth, dampened
curves that promised flight." Later, two
magnificent swans rise from below the
clifT.
We are left with this speculation on a
miracle and a gentle caution about dis
missing it: "All proof, all reason, show
them to have fallen ... But in this world
there are as well wrenching and great
surprises that take us beyond what we
can reason and what we can prove."
Implicitly, Helprin asks us to consider
important metaphysical concerns like the
nature and existence of God, the problem
of evil and justice, the power of love and
sacrifice. His rendition of "Swan Lake"
generates a dialectic between childhood
innocence and adult realities: Helprin
suggests that the abridgement of both
worlds via the wings of the imagination
may enrich our lives.

Magic realism, tragic fairy tale. We i
usually don't expect to hear of something i
as being both magical and realistic; we <
certainly don't expect to hear about fairy <
tales that approach the pathos of tragedy.
Yet, these paradoxical terms most appro
priately describe Mark Helprin's latest
publication, his magic-realist adaptation
of Tchaikovsky's classic ballet, "Swan
Lake." In his "Swan Lake," Helprin
blends impossible (or at least highly im
probable) fairy tale events with a sober
vision of life tinged with tragic realism
and believable optimism. Chris Van Al
lsburg's luminous illustrations beauti
fully evoke Helprin's magic-realist world
of dazzling emotional color and intensity.
An old man represents Helprin's voice
in this retelling of "Swan Lake." This
old man and a young girl — an orphan
whom he has adopted — live in exile in
a lofty forest nestled among high moun
tains. The old man, knowing that his
foster daughter has reached the age when
she wants to know about the world and,
most importantly, about her parents and

her identity, reveals her family history.
