## Senior Green is quiet force behind three NCAA titles 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Behind every sports dynasty
there are special athletes who
make the winning possible. As a
rule, these athletes are blessed
with innate ability, put in extra
hours to improve themselves and
are tenacious competitors.
Look at Magic Johnson. Or Joe
Montana. Or Wayne Gretzky.
There is no question each has
God-given talent, a tremendous
work ethic and a burning desire
to win. The ultimate measure of
their success is in the champion
ships they bring home.
As the Stanford women's tennis
team has pieced together its 61-
match consecutive victory streak
and captured four straight NCAA
crowns, the closest thing to a con
stant among the personnel is
senior Lisa Green.
But while a Magic or a Gretzky
grabs all the headlines, Green has
rarely been the focal point of her
team. When she was a freshman,
Patty Fendick played No. 1 singles
and won an NCAA championship.
The past two seasons, Tami Whit
linger took the top spot in the
lineup before heading for the pro
fessional tour.
This season, defending NCAA
singles champion Sandra Birch
has garnered all the attention.
All the while, Green has been
winning most of her matches no
matter where she played in the
lineup. Entering this season,
Green had compiled a 68-14 record
in team play. She has, for good
measure, reached the semifinals
of the NCAA singles tournament
the past three years.
Her career has been character
ized by brilliant play under pres
sure, most notably at the 1988

national championships when the
Cardinal was an overwhelming
underdog to top-seed Florida. An
iryury to Whitlinger moved Green
into the No. 1 spot, where she
was thought to be overmatched.
Instead, she beat Florida's Halle
Cioffi, the nation's top-ranked
player, in the finals of the team
competition to lead Stanford to
victory.
The memory stands out in her
mind. "For me, of the three na
tionals that we won, that second
year was the most rewarding,"
she says. "We weren't supposed
to win. Just to beat Florida was
so great. Everyone said we
couldn't beat them." Foremost
among the Cardinal's detractors
was Gator Coach Andy Brandi.
He was confident Stanford
could not win with Green at No.
1. More than underestimating her
ability, though, Brandi underes
timated her desire. The Gators
were one of just two teams to
defeat the Cardinal in 1988. Green
wanted revenge and was able to
lift her game to get it.
Fast forward to 1990. A casual
fan of Stanford tennis stops by to
see the Cardinal in action. The
fan looks up at the scoreboard to
see who the team's lone senior
starter is playing today. "Who's
Lisa got?"
The eyes look at the No. 1
matchup. Not there."No surprise,
maybe number two." Nope.
"Hmmm.. .. Where is she?" Fi
nally, one line from the bottom,
next to the number five, the board
reads: Green vs. Silveria. "Num
ber five? What's Lisa Green doing
play five?"
Green is playing five for two
reasons. First, the Cardinal has
arguably the most impressive tal

ent ever assembled. Green, Birch,
Meredith McGrath, Teri Whit
linger and Debbie Graham could
play No. 1 for any team in the
country — and win nearly every
match.
Second, when the lineup was
being determined through inter
team challenge matches in the
preseason, Green was not playing
to the best of her ability, and she
wasn't winning. But why? "I
think I just lost my confidence,"
she says."In challenge matches,
I was just not playing well.
"Finally, I just wanted to prac
tice and figure out what I was
doing wrong," Green continues.
"So much of it was mental. I
wasn't really motivated." As to
what caused the lack of motiva
tion, Green isn't sure.
But playing near the bottom of
the lineup has done little to get
her going. Sometimes, Green says,
she knows she can just go through
the motions and win anyway. The
ability to coast much of the time
has hurt her when she has met
up with better opponents.
"When I'd play a tough match,
1 wasn't match tough," Green
says.
There is something missing
from this picture of Green — and
it has nothing to do with her play.
A key player on three champion
ship teams. A three-time NCAA
singles semifinalist. A SENIOR!
If anyone could go to Coach Frank
Brennan and demand to play
higher, it would be Green.
And that's just what she did,
right? Wrong. All Green wanted
from Brennan was an explanation
as to why she wasn't winning. In
the bigger picture, it did not mat
ter to her where she was playing

as long as the team continued to
do well.
It was in part her selflessness
that led her teammates to select
Green as team captain. At the
same time, part of what makes
her a good leader is that she is
not consumed by the sport she
plays.
"Tennis is just part of what I
do at school," Green says. "I've
loved being on a national cham
pionship team but the outside-of
tennis things have been really
rewarding.
"I've just met so many incred
ible people here. I've really en
joyed my time here. The people
I've met and the experience I've
had are not replaceable."
Given all that, it is worth noting
Green almost did not come here
at all. A native of San Jose, she
thought long and hard about
Brennan, the academic load and
being so close to home.
"I got the complete different im
pression of what Frank is really
like when I came on my recruiting
trip. He was very intimidating,"
she says.
The real Frank Brennan is a
polar opposite. "I can talk to him
about anything. He has a great
sense of humor. He knows what
to say. He can tell if you are
having problems outside of ten-

'I've just met so
many incredible
people here. I've
really enjoyed my
time here.'.

nis," Green explains.
As for the academics, she has
done just fine. And, while it's just
40 minutes away, "I never go
home."
With NCAAs approaching for
the final time, Green is getting
excited. She says the whole season
comes down to this and, with
everyone expecting the Cardinal
to win again, Green doesn't want
the team to come up short.
Plus, the four straight days of
matches at the championships will
help her get on track. Could a
fourth semifinal appearance be in
the offing? While Green won't
make any predictions, she did
leave the door open.
"I can be playing well enough.
It's just a matter of putting it all
together," she says."I never think
beforehand, 'Oh I have get to the
semis.' "
Whatever happens, Green will
take it in stride. She is ready to
move on and take nothing but
good memories with her. "I've
loved playing college tennis. It's
been a great experience for me,"
Green says.

ships they bring home.
As the Stanford women's tennis
team has pieced together its 61-
match consecutive victory streak
and captured four straight NCAA
crowns, the closest thing to a con
stant among the personnel is
senior Lisa Green.
But while a Magic or a Gretzky
grabs all the headlines, Green has
rarely been the focal point of her
team. When she was a freshman,
Patty Fendick played No. 1 singles
and won an NCAA championship.
The past two seasons, Tami Whit
linger took the top spot in the
lineup before heading for the pro
fessional tour.
This season, defending NCAA
singles champion Sandra Birch
has garnered all the attention.
All the while, Green has been
winning most of her matches no
matter where she played in the
lineup. Entering this season,
Green had compiled a 68-14 record
in team play. She has, for good
measure, reached the semifinals
of the NCAA singles tournament
the past three years.
Her career has been character
ized by brilliant play under pres
sure, most notably at the 1988

national championships when the
Cardinal was an overwhelming
underdog to top-seed Florida. An
iryury to Whitlinger moved Green
into the No. 1 spot, where she
was thought to be overmatched.
Instead, she beat Florida's Halle
Cioffi, the nation's top-ranked
player, in the finals of the team
competition to lead Stanford to
victory.
The memory stands out in her
mind. "For me, of the three na
tionals that we won, that second
year was the most rewarding,"
she says. "We weren't supposed
to win. Just to beat Florida was
so great. Everyone said we
couldn't beat them." Foremost
among the Cardinal's detractors
was Gator Coach Andy Brandi.
He was confident Stanford
could not win with Green at No.
1. More than underestimating her
ability, though, Brandi underes
timated her desire. The Gators
were one of just two teams to
defeat the Cardinal in 1988. Green
wanted revenge and was able to
lift her game to get it.
Fast forward to 1990. A casual
fan of Stanford tennis stops by to
see the Cardinal in action. The
fan looks up at the scoreboard to
see who the team's lone senior
starter is playing today. "Who's
Lisa got?"
The eyes look at the No. 1
matchup. Not there."No surprise,
maybe number two." Nope.
"Hmmm.. .. Where is she?" Fi
nally, one line from the bottom,
next to the number five, the board
reads: Green vs. Silveria. "Num
ber five? What's Lisa Green doing
play five?"
Green is playing five for two
reasons. First, the Cardinal has
arguably the most impressive tal

ent ever assembled. Green, Birch,
Meredith McGrath, Teri Whit
linger and Debbie Graham could
play No. 1 for any team in the
country — and win nearly every
match.
Second, when the lineup was
being determined through inter
team challenge matches in the
preseason, Green was not playing
to the best of her ability, and she
wasn't winning. But why? "I
think I just lost my confidence,"
she says."In challenge matches,
I was just not playing well.
"Finally, I just wanted to prac
tice and figure out what I was
doing wrong," Green continues.
"So much of it was mental. I
wasn't really motivated." As to
what caused the lack of motiva
tion, Green isn't sure.
But playing near the bottom of
the lineup has done little to get
her going. Sometimes, Green says,
she knows she can just go through
the motions and win anyway. The
ability to coast much of the time
has hurt her when she has met
up with better opponents.
"When I'd play a tough match,
1 wasn't match tough," Green
says.
There is something missing
from this picture of Green — and
it has nothing to do with her play.
A key player on three champion
ship teams. A three-time NCAA
singles semifinalist. A SENIOR!
If anyone could go to Coach Frank
Brennan and demand to play
higher, it would be Green.
And that's just what she did,
right? Wrong. All Green wanted
from Brennan was an explanation
as to why she wasn't winning. In
the bigger picture, it did not mat
ter to her where she was playing

as long as the team continued to
do well.
It was in part her selflessness
that led her teammates to select
Green as team captain. At the
same time, part of what makes
her a good leader is that she is
not consumed by the sport she
plays.
"Tennis is just part of what I
do at school," Green says. "I've
loved being on a national cham
pionship team but the outside-of
tennis things have been really
rewarding.
"I've just met so many incred
ible people here. I've really en
joyed my time here. The people
I've met and the experience I've
had are not replaceable."
Given all that, it is worth noting
Green almost did not come here
at all. A native of San Jose, she
thought long and hard about
Brennan, the academic load and
being so close to home.
"I got the complete different im
pression of what Frank is really
like when I came on my recruiting
trip. He was very intimidating,"
she says.
The real Frank Brennan is a
polar opposite. "I can talk to him
about anything. He has a great
sense of humor. He knows what
to say. He can tell if you are
having problems outside of ten-

'I've just met so
many incredible
people here. I've
really enjoyed my
time here.'.

nis," Green explains.
As for the academics, she has
done just fine. And, while it's just
40 minutes away, "I never go
home."
With NCAAs approaching for
the final time, Green is getting
excited. She says the whole season
comes down to this and, with
everyone expecting the Cardinal
to win again, Green doesn't want
the team to come up short.
Plus, the four straight days of
matches at the championships will
help her get on track. Could a
fourth semifinal appearance be in
the offing? While Green won't
make any predictions, she did
leave the door open.
"I can be playing well enough.
It's just a matter of putting it all
together," she says."I never think
beforehand, 'Oh I have get to the
semis.' "
Whatever happens, Green will
take it in stride. She is ready to
move on and take nothing but
good memories with her. "I've
loved playing college tennis. It's
been a great experience for me,"
Green says.
