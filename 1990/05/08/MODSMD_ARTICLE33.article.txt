# Cardinal on fire at golf tourney
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Even though the California
Intercollegiate golf tournament
is usually played at the Stan
ford Golf Course, the women's
golf team did not seem to mind
that it was moved down to San
Diego this year.
In fact, the team is probably
quite happy it was moved.
After the first two rounds of
the three-round tournament
yesterday, the Cardinal stands
in second place, only one shot
behind defending national
champion and currently No. 2-
ranked San Jose State.
Stanford combined for a 601
team total, shooting 300 in the
first 18 holes and a mirror
image 301 in their second go
round. San Diego State is
third in the eight-team field,
13 strokes off the pace.
"We're pretty happy with
how we played," sophomore
Audrey Wooding said. "We had
two really steady rounds and
are excited about how close we
are to San Jose State."
Wooding has plenty to be ex-

cited about, as her score of 147
put her into a tie for second
place individually. But even
more important is the fact that
in the second round of the day
she shot a 71 (one under par).
The performance was her best
collegiate round ever and the
first time she had broken par.
"I played really consistently
today and got some momentum
early in the day," she said. "It
(the career-round) hasn't really
hit me yet because I'm pretty
tired."
Someone else who ought to
be excited is junior Jodi Figley.
After all, at the end of the day,
Figley found herself all alone
in first place, two shots ahead
of Wooding and San Jose
State's Dina Ammaccapane.
Figley matched Wooding's low
round of the day score with a
71 in the first round to put herself
in the lead.
"I haven't been in first place in
a tournament in a long time, and
this feels pretty good," Figley said.
"I putted real well today and just
played my own game."
The rest of the team was not
as spectacular, but still turned in
steady rounds to keep the team
score low. Stephanie Davis shot
a 153, which put her into a tie
for tenth place, while Adele Moore
had an off day, shooting a 157.
But before getting too excited,
the Cardinal should realize that
today might be a different story.
Indeed, it has to be different be
cause the schools will switch
courses mid-tournament. It is also
a course the Cardinal has never
seen before.

'After today's rounds,
we know that we have
a realistic chance to
win the whole thing.

Still, Wooding doesn't seem con
cerned. "We haven't seen the
course yet, but sometimes this can
be a bigger advantage than dis
advantage. We don't know what's
there, so we'll just have to hit the
ball and hope."
Going into the tournament, the
team's goal was to beat San Jose
State, and if the team has another
round like yesterday's showing,
they might just accomplish their
goal.

would be great for us before going
