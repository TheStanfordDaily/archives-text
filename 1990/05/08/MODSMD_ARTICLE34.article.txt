# WPMPAST? 'Dude, I saw it on ESPN.'
## 
### 
About five or six times a year, when I
stop to think about it, I realize how
wonderful ESPN is.
Usually I'm too busy watching to actually
think about it, but every now and again it
hits me that the Entertainment and Sports
Programing Network is quite a fine thing.
And then another Friday night comes along.
Friday was quite the phenomenal sports
watching day for me. I went up to Berkeley
and watched our baseball team hammer the
Bears and our men's tennis team eek out an
awesome victory over said archrival.
Then I went back home and watched much
of the Phoenix Suns-Utah Jazz game. After
that, looking for one last sporting event to
make the evening perfect (perfect, that is,
considering that the nonexistent status of my
social life has basically caused me to lower
my expectations of what the perfect Friday
night is), I turned to ESPN.
Much to my surprise, they had some event
from the world professional mixed pairs ar
tistic surfing tour.
Right about now you are probably think
ing, "Crader's obviously blown a
synapse." That is, if you're still reading
this. Of course, if what I said in the last
paragraph drove you away, and you're not
still reading this, you probably are thinking
nothing of the sort; instead you're probably
reading about the red-hot women's golf team
or Lisa Green.
Anyway, back to those of you who are still
reading, let me repeat myself:
I turned to ESPN. Much to my surprise,
they had some event from the world profes
sional mixed pairs artistic surfing tour.
Now I'm not positive it was the world pro

fessional mixed pairs artistic surfing tour
(WPMPAST???), especially since, as far as I
know, such a tour does not exist.
But I know what I saw (don't I sound like
someone who just saw a UFO or something?).
There were these guys on surf boards, see.
And they weren't alone out there.
They were catching waves, then they were
grabbing their partner, who was conveniently
also located on the same surf board. They
would then hold her up with one or both
hands, and she would do stuff like sit on his
shoulder or whatever. I didn't stick around
long enough to get the complete picture, for
obvious reasons.
My feeling on the whole thing is that ESPN
has come a long way in the 10-plus years the
network has been available to cable viewers,
but it is not quite where it wants to be yet.
In the beginning the network had things
like the European Trampoline Championships
and British snooker on.
I know. I saw these things.
Granted, then it was just a fledgling net
work, less than wise in the way of the
typical viewers' tastes. Now, however,
I expect that it should know better.
But, of course, it doesn't.

So, in the course of a typical week, you can
watch ESPN and get an incredible variety of
non-sports.
There's that Fishin' Hole show, or whatever
it's called. And Running and Racing. And
Motorweek. Jet-ski competitions. Mud
bogging. Tractor pulling. And, one of my
favorites, Star Shoot.
At least I think that's what it's called. I'm
not actually positive it exists, since I only saw
it once, and that was really early in the morn
ing.
I had to wake up at something like six
o'clock in the morning to get ready for my
sister's wedding back in December because
her husband-to-be was coming to pick me up
at like 7:30 or something, and we were going
to go get the food and the drinks for the
reception and set them up and set up the
tables and stuff and then get dressed and go
over to the church to take pictures and then
go through the ceremony and then go to the
reception and you know, the works.
(Please feel free to take a deep breath (or
two (perhaps even three or four if you feel
you were left particularly breathless by the
quantity of mindless drivel occupying that last
sentence)) right here).
Anyway, he (my sister's husband of the
present) said he saw this show too, so I guess
it must really exist.
What it was was four guys competing in a
tag-team skeet-shooting competition. The
show I saw had Willie Gault and Jay Schroeder
of the (this space for rent) Raiders as the
celebrities.
So each celebrity teams with a pro (I think
I need to answer a few questions here: Yes,


Chris
Crader
there are apparantly professional
skeet shooters. No, I'm not
making this up. Yes, I really am
sane (at least the last time I
checked). No, I don't take drugs.),
and the pair basically tries to
shoot more clay pigeons than the
other team.
I think Schroeder's team won,
but I'm a little fuzzy on the whole
thing.
How the heck does ESPN
justify showing this
drivel?
According to my calculations,
there are about 4,291 sports I'd
rather see on television than
celebrity skeet shooting. They in
clude, but are not limited to: team
handball, jai alai, curling, biat

halons (the kind with cross
country skiing and shooting),
Matt Biondi vs. Tom Jager sprints
for cash and perhaps even Janet
Evans vs. Anke Mohring 1500-
meter long hauls for cash.
ESPN shows six or seven pro
baseball games a week but shows
only one college game a week.
And, as far as I know, they only
broadcast one collegiate men's vol
leyball match this year (USC at
Stanford), even though it may
have been the most exciting thing
they showed in all of April.
What are they thinking?
Maybe I just have higher stand
ards than the rest of the nation.
Or maybe no one actually
watches mud-bogging.

Chris Crader is The Daily's Tues
day sports columnist. He is some
what bummed he didn't get to talk
about American Gladiators in this
column, but, since ESPN doesn't
show it, it didn't fit the theme.
