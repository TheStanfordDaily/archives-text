# Athletes of the Week

The sixth time was the charm.
Leading 6-5, 40-0 in the third set of the
deciding doubles match, the Stanford player
had suddenly lost his serve. Two straight
double-faults made it 40-30. He took his
first serve — fault. But after missing five
in a row, the tall youth sliced a hard second
sevice in. A second later, it was over, and
the Cardinal had defeated the Bears 5-4 to

avenge their first loss of the season.
For snatching victory from the jaws of
defeat, Alexis Hombrecher is The Daily's
Athlete of the Week. Joining him is a second
time honoree, sprinter Chryste Gaines.
Gaines, a 5-foot-8 sophomore from Dallas,
continued to prove why she is the best
female sprinter in school history. After
breaking the school record in the 100-meter
dash a month ago, Gaines put her name in
the record books again last weekend at the
Modesto Relays.
Gaines took 37 hundredths of a second
off the 200-meter school mark by cruising
to victory in 23.71 seconds. She has easily
qualified for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships and is within half a second
of making the NCAA qualifying standard.
Gaines also won the 100-meter dash, miss
ing her own school-record time by .08
seconds in that event. She has qualified for
the NCAA meet in that event.
For her efforts Gaines was named the
Pac-10 women's track Athlete of the Week
for the second time this year.

Hombrecher, a 6-5 freshman from Suisun,
Calif., has impressed in his first year on
the Farm. Part of the "Big Three" recruiting
class along with Jonathan Stark and Jared
Palmer, Hombrecher has posted an overall
record of 27-5 this year in both singles and
doubles.
Hombrecher and teammate JefT Cathrall
are a perfect 9-0 in doubles, including the

clutch victory at No. 2 doubles over Cali
fornia's Bent Pedersen and Carl Chang. With
the 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 win, the freshman/senior
combination ended the Cardinal's regular
season on a winning note.
Hombrecher contributed another crucial
point in the Cal match with a come-from
behind three set victory at No. 5 singles
over Pete Fitzpatrick.
