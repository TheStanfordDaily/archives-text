# Paulsen named Six-Pac Player of Week
## 
### 
Junior second baseman Troy
Paulsen was named Pacific 10
Southern Division Player of the
Week for his efforts last week, as
the Cardinal won four games and
clinched its first Six-Pac title since
1987. Stanford will now likely be
selected to host one of the NCAA
Regionals scheduled for May
24-28.
Paulsen, whose team-record 28-
game hitting streak was eclipsed
this season by freshman Jeff
Hammonds, had a big weekend
against California as the Cardinal
swept the Golden Bears. In Fri
day's 15-9 win, Paulsen was three
for-five, with an RBI and run
scored.
On Saturday, as the red-hot
Stanford batsmen again posted 15
runs against the hapless men in
blue and gold, Paulsen again con
tributed three hits as well as two
runs scored and an RBI. On Sun
day, however, the loud Cardinal
bats were silenced by ex
teammate Brad Brown.
Brown cruised through the first
seven innings with a shutout, but
Paulsen broke the ice and then
went on to spark the Cardinal to
a come-from-behind win. With
one out and men on first and
third in the eighth, Paulsen hit a
deep ground ball to short. Ham-

monds beat the throw to second,
and Roger Burnett scored to make
the score 2-1 for Cal.
After Ryan Turner tied the ball
game in the top of the ninth with
a dramatic two-out homer, Paul
sen came through again in the
tenth inning. With Hammonds on
third via a leadofT triple, Paulsen
got his second hit and RBI of the
game, this one the game winner.
Paulsen, who has hit over .300
all season long after struggling
last season, hit an even .600 for
the week (including a two-for-five
gerformance a week ago against
t. Mary's). He scored five runs,
knocked in five and had three
extra base hits (a double, triple,
and home run; the latter two in
Saturday's game).
