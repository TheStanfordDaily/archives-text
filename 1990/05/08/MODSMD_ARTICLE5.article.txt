# Grad senator to introduce ASSU openness bills
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
At tonight's ASSU Senate meeting, graduate
senator Douglas Bone will introduce three bills and
a resolution intended to mandate openness and free
dom of information within the senate.
The first three bills call for changes in the ASSU
Bylaws to require open senate and senate committee
meetings and to provide for free and open access
to ASSU records. The fourth resolution mandates
freedom of information throughout the senate.
The introduction of the bills comes one week
after The Daily revealed that Stanford students are
not guaranteed access to meetings of elected ASSU
officials and are not guaranteed access to files detail
ing how the ASSU spends its money.
Bone said the purpose of the bills is "to make
the entire process more responsible" and to give
people "the ability to check on what's going on."
"It's too easy for the ASSU to hide information
— I'm not saying it's done intentionally — but I
think the ASSU should [change that]," Bone ex
plained.
The bills must be submitted for previous notice
in accordance with the Bylaws, and no action will
be taken on them tonight. But the resolution may
come up for a vote, according to Bone.
