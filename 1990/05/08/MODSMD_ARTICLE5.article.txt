# Grad senator to introduce ASSU openness bills
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
At tonight's ASSU Senate meeting, graduate
senator Douglas Bone will introduce three bills and
a resolution intended to mandate openness and free
dom of information within the senate.
The first three bills call for changes in the ASSU
Bylaws to require open senate and senate committee
meetings and to provide for free and open access
to ASSU records. The fourth resolution mandates
freedom of information throughout the senate.
The introduction of the bills comes one week
after The Daily revealed that Stanford students are
not guaranteed access to meetings of elected ASSU
officials and are not guaranteed access to files detail
ing how the ASSU spends its money.
Bone said the purpose of the bills is "to make
the entire process more responsible" and to give
people "the ability to check on what's going on."
"It's too easy for the ASSU to hide information
— I'm not saying it's done intentionally — but I
think the ASSU should [change that]," Bone ex
plained.
The bills must be submitted for previous notice
in accordance with the Bylaws, and no action will
be taken on them tonight. But the resolution may
come up for a vote, according to Bone.
One bill will change the Bylaws
to specify that "all records of any
Association entity must be avail
able for scrutiny," except for cer
tain proprietary business
information.
Association entities include
such offices as the Council of
Presidents but exempt confiden
tial records established between a
client and an attorney in the Legal
Counseling service. Records are
such things as minutes, reports,
background materials, letters and
other documents.
"Reasonable procedures may be
employed to manage such access,
but no barriers must be erected

to those seeking perusal or
photocopying of senate records,"
the bill reads.
The second bill, which requires
open senate meetings, "eliminates
any means of the senate to ever
close any meetings," according to
Bone. For example, it would bar
the senate from closing a meeting
after a two-thirds vote, a measure
provided in the current Bylaws.
The third bill requires that all
senate committee meetings be
open to non-members even if two
thirds of the committee wish to
close the meeting.
The resolution asks that senate
meetings "shall be open to the
public unless explicitly exempted
by the Bylaws."
Bone said he did not know
whether the senate would pass
any of these bills.
