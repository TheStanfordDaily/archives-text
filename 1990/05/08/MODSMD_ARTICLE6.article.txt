# Ujamaa RF celebrates gift of music with Bobby McFerrin
## 
### Heidi Durrow 
When Rachel Bagby, the resident fellow
of Ujamaa House, was younger, she says
she "was really trying to be a white boy."
The tall, hazel-eyed black woman says
she was living an "outer-directed life and
not really thinking that the gifts that I
have here within was what was needed."
But now, Bagby has begun to value those
inherent gifts and is realizing her potential
and her talent in the performing arts.
Bagby now performs with Voicestra, a
10-member a cappella ensemble headed by
Grammy Award winner Bobby McFerrin.
The group sings everything from rap to
classical music. Most of its songs are com
posed by McFerrin and other Voicestra
members.
"Voicestra is my family," Bagby explains.
"It's like a spiritual practice for me."
Before becoming a member of the en

semble, Bagby says she went to a perform
ance of an earlier incarnation of the group.
As she created three different rhythms with
her hands and feet and sang harmony, she
"had a sense of what infinity is."
The experience awakened her to a new
spiritual understanding of God after a long
alienation from Christianity because "of
that lack of affirmation of me as a woman,"
Bagby says.
"It made God all right with me again â€”
and I don't mean that in arrogance, but
it opened me up to those teachings again
in a way that I wanted to be in that group
immediately."
After recently celebrating its first anni
versary, Voicestra has big plans for the
future.
The group doesn't have an album yet,
but members have been in the studio as
sisting McFerrin as he prepares to release
a new solo album.

In September, Voicestra will tour Eu
rope, and the group will be in Japan next
May. Voicestra is also considering film and
television opportunities, Bagby says.
The group has already been seen on The
Arsenio Hall Show, performing two songs
there: "The Garden" and "Sweet in the
Morning."
"It was so much fun," Bagby exclaims
about her experience on the show. "It was
so hot."
Bagby has included one of her own songs
in Voicestra's repertoire. Originally re
corded with Everyday People, one of Stan
ford's a cappella groups, "Across the Lines"
is inspired by incidents in the fall of 1988,
when two fliers were defaced in a racially
offensive manner at Ujamaa.
Because she is so busy with her com
mitment to Voicestra, Bagby is unable to
spend as much time with students on per
forming arts projects as she would like.

Although she misses students, she plans
to sing with Voicestra for as long as she can.
But if the excitement of touring and
singing with a world-famous singer isn't
enough for Bagby, she always has her po
sitions as associate director of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project and RF of
Ujamaa to keep her on her toes.
Though she eT\joys her work with the
King Papers Project, she is planning to
take a leave of absence in the next academic
year so she can devote more time to
Voicestra.
She would also like to dedicate more
time to being an RF, but she adds that
even though she is often touring, her con
tact with the outside community is positive
for the Ujamaa community.
"It just enriches the house for me to
able to bring things back," Bagby says.
Despite such unforeseen prob
lems as the Oct. 17 earthquake,
a fire that badly damaged the
Ujamaa RF cottage during winter
break and a January car accident
in which she injured her back,
Bagby is still pleased with the
success of her first year as an RF.
Those separate events "have in
terfered with a lot of the things
that I personally have wanted to
do," Bagby says.
But one of her main goals, to
create an environment where
people feel comfortable expressing
their views, has been achieved,
Bagby says.
Bagby also hopes that Ujamaa
will continue "to be that place
where we (black people) just
embrace each other and ourselves
and all that that means."
She concedes, however, that her
success as an RF is due in large
part to an excellent residential
staff and her husband, Martin
Davidson.
"My partnership with Martin is
critical for us to be able to be
RFs here." He plays a critical role
in the house and also "to me,"
Bagby says.
