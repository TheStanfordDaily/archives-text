# 'Non-partisan' investigators question integrity of ASSU elections
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
As the result of an investigation of
alleged ASSU rules violations, three stu
dents "question the legitimacy" of last
month's elections and condemn the
obscurity of the ASSU Constitution and
Bylaws.
The students — who call themselves
non-partisan — said they hope the at
tention the report brings to "discrep
ancies and ambiguities" in ASSU proce
dure will lend support to a related bill
drafted by independent senator Sheila
Hayre for tonight's senate meeting.
In the conclusion to the 10-page report,
the three students request the ASSU es
tablish an independent judiciary body to
investigate possible procedural breaches.
Hayre, a sophomore, had worked with
the students and provided a lot of infor
mation for the report, according to junior
Morris Sim, one of the trio.
Hayre said she will present a bill which
calls for the two contending Council of
Presidents slates to "submit to media

tion" by a neutral third body about the
election results. The bill also suggests
the senate establish a permanent body
for this purpose, she said.
Hayre added that her bill agrees with
comments made in yesterday's Daily by
Elections Commissioner Steve Krauss,
who said he thinks it is "unfortunate"
that such a governing body does not exist.
Because she wanted to assure the
report's objectivity, Hayre said she
stopped working on it. She then decided
to write the bill because "this is pretty
much the only avenue" she has as a
senator to help achieve the report's ends.
Although the report makes no explicit
accusations of wrongdoing because the
students "do not feel qualified" to do so,
it "points out the facts It's pretty
clear-cut," according to sophomore
Noeleen Waldcr, another of the three stu
dents.
First, the report says the section of
the Bylaws which states that "any incor
rectly marked ballot shall not be tallied"
is ambiguous. Moreover, the "broad" in
terpretation of this clause advocated by

Krauss makes election results vulnerable
to partisan influences, according to the
report.
Sim said yesterday he believes Krauss
is personally "non-partisan," but the per
son in the position of elections commis
sioner "could be swayed."
Second, the report indicates that the
Elections Commission's release of results
with 97 percent of the ballots cast, which
was reported in the April 20 Daily, "ap
pears to be a discrepancy" with a section
of the Bylaws which states, "No individ
uals ... shall be informed of the results
of any tally ... until a complete tally of
all ballots cast on campus has been
prepared."
When The Daily reported 97 percent
results, it included all the ballots cast on
campus — the remaining 3 percent were
from overseas campuses. Walder said she
thought this should have been clearer in
the article.
Walder said she hoped "enough of the
points in [the report] will be proven" to
support the students' assertion that the
ASSU frequently violates its own rules.

Graduate senator Douglas Bone, a vocal
ASSU critic, acknowledged the truth of
the students' assertion, saying, "The sen
ate in general violates rules all the time."
The third point made in the report is
that a failure to include the minutes for
the Feb. 27 senate meeting in the agenda
packet for the April 12 meeting "seems
to" constitute a violation of a clause in
the Rules of Order which assures access
to "public ASSU information."
Bone said he did not have minutes for
the March 6 meeting, although it is
"usually" included in the agenda packet.
Fourth, the report charges that an il
legal change of dates for the April 23
senate meeting, at which the election
results were validated, "might have al
tered the results of the deliberation."
Although a section of the Bylaws states
that all senate meetings will be held on
Tuesdays — and that one was held on
a Monday — Bone said it was not a
significant violation because the date of
the meeting was well publicized on an
ASSU calendar and anyone had ample
opportunity to object to it.

However, Walder contended that the
date was changed from an original
schedule which listed an April 24 meet
ing.
Fifth, the report states that Senate
Chair Ed Sasaki's bill, which called for
a validation of the election, actually had
to be in the form of a resolution, accord
ing to the Bylaws.
Sixth, Sasaki's April 22 memo about
the election, which accused "A Clean
Slate" — which lost the race for COP —
of trying to "subvert the democratic proc
ess," casts doubt upon the non
partisanship of the senate's validation
process, according to the report.
A partisan validation violates the letter
of the Bylaws. The report did not mention
that the decision to validate the election
split along party lines.
After a complicated analysis of the
Bylaws, the report states that inherent
ambiguities "lead one to question
whether integrity can be upheld within
the current validation process and
whether the ASSU Bylaws need to be
clarified."
