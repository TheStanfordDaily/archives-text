Why did you disqualify my vote?
You know there'B a reason I put it down.
— "This Election Sucks,"
Turgid Miasma of Existence, RSE
To the tune of protest songs like "This Election
Sucks" and "Tainted Vote," about 50 students gath
ered in White Plaza yesterday to show their oppo
sition to the disqualification of write-in votes in
last month's ASSU elections.
"We figure with a massive outpouring of student
opinion — petitions, (yesterday's) Daily poll, the
rally and students showing up at the senate meeting
— some senators will see that it would be unwise
for them to go against such strong student opinion,
and they'll not certify the election," rally organizer
David Hyatt said.
However, the protest and a 14-day sit-in at the
ASSU office did not reverse the expected outcome,
as the ASSU Senate last night certified the election
in an 11-7 vote, with one abstention.
The outpouring of student opinion at yesterday's
rally was less than massive. The crowd of 50 who
attended at noon soon dwindled to less than 25,
and by 12:45 p.m. only 68 people had signed a
petition supporting a runoff in the Council of Presi

dents election.
Despite the small crowd, several students spoke
at the rally, vigorously urging the ASSU Senate not
to certify the election.
Douglas Bone, a graduate senator, said he planned
to vote against certification. He said if the senate
certified the election, there would be "people in
power who have no mandate to govern."
Other speakers called on students to protest their
disenfranchisement.
"Someone who voted just to get their fee refund
and voted for random senators and a random COP
slate — their vote counts. But someone who voted
for what they feel is a better alternative — their
vote doesn't count," said Forrest Gotshalk, half of
the jilted Nurk Twins slate, whose votes were
thrown out of the election.
Several signs at the rally featured messages such
as "One student, one vote," "Students are outraged"
and "67% want Runoff - today's Daily."
The last sign referred to a poll that appeared in
yesterday's Daily in which 67.5 percent of students
polled said the write-in ballots should be counted.
Members of the Chaparral staff were on hand,
selling T-shirts with the Chaparral logo and a pic
ture of Bart Simpson writing "I will not run for
ASSU Senate" several times on a chalkboard. The
reverse side of the T-shirt read, in typical Simpson
parlance, "One 'toon, one vote, dude."
