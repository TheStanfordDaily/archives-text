# Estonia joins Baltic independence drive

TALLINN, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Estonia
dropped the trappings of Soviet power
on yesterday, changing its name and
its flag, and proclaimed solidarity with
Latvia and Lithuania in the three Bal
tic republics' drive toward indepen
dence.
Without formally declaring indepen
dence, Estonia's Parliament
reinstituted some paragraphs from its
1938 constitution, including one pro
claiming Estonia "an independent re
public, with the supreme state power
vested in the people."
It dropped "Soviet Socialist" to be
come simply "The Republic of Es
tonia." And it adopted its old tricolor
national flag in place of the hammer
and-sickle banner of socialism.
Parliament said the steps were
meant to show solidarity with sister
republics Lithuania and Latvia, which
have issued declarations of indepen
dence. All three states were indepen
dent until forcibly annexed by the So
viet Union in 1940.
The deputies also adopted a resolu
tion proclaiming Baltic solidarity and
congratulating Latvia on declaring in
dependence.
"The path to our own statehood is
not easy, but we are convinced that
here in the Baltics, we three — acting
together — will arrive at a restoration
of our independent states more fruit
fully than if each were to struggle on
its own," said the statement, broadcast
on Radio Estonia and monitored in
Britain.
Lithuania's 3.8 million people are
under an economic blockade imposed
by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
in an attempt to force Lithuania to
rescind and Latvia set unspecified
transition periods for secession from
the Soviet Union.
On Monday, Lithuania's Council of
Ministers decided to cut meat ship
ments to Soviet ministries by 10 per
cent in hopes of bartering scarce meat
directly with Soviet factories for oil
and other supplies, said Aidas
Palubinskas, of the Supreme Council
legislature's information bueau.
The Soviet government newspaper
Izvestia accused Lithuania yesterday

of reducing meat and milk shipments
to the Soviet Union in retaliation for
Moscow's economic sanctions.
In Latvia, legislators who oppose in
dependence asked Gorbachev not to
impose sanctions on Latvia, saying
that would hurt many citizens loyal
to the Soviet Union.
The group called for a referendum
on independence.
Activists say the recent parliamen
tary elections constituted a referen
dum on independence. Advocates of
separation won more than two-thirds
of the seats in the parliaments of all
three Baltic republics.
Latvia issued a declaration of inde
pendence on Friday but did not ask
for an immediate break with Moscow
or suspend the Soviet constitution. It
is waiting to hear if Gorbachev will
impose sanctions similar to those on
Lithuania.
Latvians make up 53 percent of the
2.6 million people in their native land,
and many Russian and other non-
Latvian residents oppose indepen
dence.
In Estonia, Parliament approved the
constitutional changes and the tradi
tional symbols of state by a vote of
73-14. Eighteen deputies did not vote
or did not attend the session.
Minutes later, a small crowd gath
ered on the cobblestone square outside
the ancient parliament building and
watched as the red flag was lowered.
It was replaced by the blue-black-and
white striped flag used by Estonia
when it was independent between the
two world wars.
Matt Laar, a deputy from Tallinn,
the Estonian capital, said the republic
already is feeling the effects of the
Soviet oil and natural gas embargo
against Lithuania because a Lithua
nian refinery processes half of Es
tonia's gasoline.
Estonians have tried to start talks
with the Kremlin about eventual in
dependence, but Moscow has refused.
In Latvia, the United Council of
Work Collectives, which claims
140,000 mostly non-ethnic Latvian
members, called for a strike to protest
the declaration of independence.
