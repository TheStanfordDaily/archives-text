## Change The Draw 
### 
Despite reforms,
housing is still not
assigned on equal basis

IT'S THE EIGHTH inning,
game tied, two outs, bases
loaded. Your team was down
by three, but it has made a come
back.
There is at least one more inning
left in the game, but it sure would
be nice to have a hit now.
That's right â€” The Draw is here
again. This time the theme is base
ball.
And while The Draw has scored
some runs this year, it still needs
some more hits before Stanford
wins.
In contrast to previous years,
The Draw will be reduced to one
round, causing a significant stress
reduction.
One of the major reasons the
Housing Office was able to effect
these changes was by making sure
that people who needed to drop
out of The Draw, i.e. resident as
sistants and fraternity pledges,
could*do so before The Draw took
place.
Despite these improvements,
problems remain. RAs, for exam
ple, still do not know whether or
not they will need to enter the
lottery until the first day of The
Draw.
This fact causes problems for
groups containing people who are

applying to be RAs.
In addition, equity has not yet
hit The Draw.
Some students, especially those
members of the nefarious 10,000
club (a fictional category for people
whose draw numbers add up to
over 10,000), will never have the
opportunity to live in the more
attractive campus housing.
There must be a better way.
Other schools do not seem to
run into as large of a problem with
hurt, bitter feelings amongst draw
group (and former draw group)
members.
Though they have already
achieved much, the Housing Office
and students together should ex
plore different ways of changing
The Draw.
When further changes take
place, The Draw can be less of a
point of stress and more of an op
portunity for next year.
Toyon Hall, for instance, has fed
on that stress by requiring draw
groups to work for one hour to
obtain a priority to live Toyon. The
priority does not guarantee entry
into Toyon, however.
They will be receiving many free
work hours from people who are
desperate to live in a nice dorm
but will end up somewhere else
because of their draw number.
Neither Stanford students,
Toyon nor The Draw needs that
kind of manipulation.
What we need is a kinder, gentler
housing lottery.
And then we won't need a theme
like baseball to take our minds off
the reality of The Draw.
