UCMI goals are not being fulfilled at Medical Center

A FAIR AND resonable measure
of the success of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
could be whether their recommenda
tions are successfully implemented by
all University departments. The entire
University would have to follow UCMI
for it to be considered a success.
By this standard it is antithetical to
state that the "UCMI Goals Are Being
Fulfilled" when for example, the Medi
cal School lags far behind all other
schools in actively pursuing a strategy
of diversification, particularly of its
hospital residents and interns.
Stanford Medical School may be the
only place where institutional racism is
openly supported, nurtured and unas
hamedly practiced in the entire Stan
ford academic community.
The figures describing minority
admissions to Stanford residency pro
grams are appalling. Two-thirds of
both white and minority students in
their final year of medical school wish
to have their residencies at Stanford.
Of those who applied and for whom

Stanford was the first choice, 47 per
cent of the minorities were accepted as
opposed to 84 percent of the whites.
The discrepancy is not a function of
academic performance. In fact, a
review of clerkship student evaluations,
maybe the most important aspect of a
residency application to most programs,
reveals that minority students perform
as well, if not better, than white stu
dents on the clinical wards.
The only distinguishing variable is
race. These data originate from the
office of the Dean of the Medical
School.
This problem is not new. For at
least the past five yars there have
been numerous efforts by students and
some faculty members to stop the
blatant discrimination against minority
medical students. All efforts have been
thwarted by an apathetic administra
tion which claims no responsibility or
control over the often erratic behavior
of its department chairs.
The latest effort was the Kedes
Report filed in 1987. Its recommenda-

tions were rehashed in the UCMI
report. The recommendations of this
report were entirely dismissed and
disregarded by the dean.
Early this year, at the request of the
Minority Student's Alliance, the dean
formed a committee whose charge was
to make suggestions as to how to best
go about diversifying the house staff.
However, when the issue of account
ability was raised there were blank
stares all around. The report is due
this summer, but it is difficult to
generate enthusiasm over the recom
mendations of yet another committee
in light of the Medical School's history
of kowtowing to the hospital depart
ment heads.
The house staff will not be diver
sified until Dean David Korn, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy or
whoever is responsible for overseeing
the hiring of house staff takes a stand
and requires the various department
chairs to hire more minorities.
It has been argued in the past that
an insufficient "pipeline" of candidates

exists from which to hire house staff.
This is a lie. Stanford Medical School
classes for the past 15 years have had
a per-year minority student ratio of 20
percent. Currently, however, minorities
only make up less than 5 percent of
the hospital house staff.
As stated before it is not a problem
of lack of interest in Stanford or of
academics either. No standards would
have to be lowered to achieve a 20
percent minority to physician ratio in
most medical departments.
The problem lies in the fact that the
people responsible for hiring physicians
into the house staff are consciously or
unconsciously discriminating against
African-Americans, Latinos and Native
Americans. Until someone publicly
assumes responsibility and is em
powered to put a stop to this
deplorable situation, UCMI will be
regarded as a joke in the medical
center.
