# Regardless of ethnicity, racism should be avoided

### 
On April 16, I submitted a factual
description of an incident in which I
was harrassed on campus by a group
of approximately 15 black men. It was
printed in the April 24 Daily.
On May 3, a response from Dana
Grigg was published in which he stated
that my use of the word "black" was
intended "to evoke fear in the reader,"
that I fabricated sections of my des
cription to "play on the white
populace's excessive fear of African-
American aggression," that I was a

"covert racist" and finally that "any
black male can tell many stories" of
being slighted for the color of his skin.
So my complaint is "certainly not
remarkable enough to write a letter to
The Daily."
"America's creed" apparently means
that anyone who is not a black male
should shut up, accept racism as an
acceptable outlet for African-
Americans' aggression and never report
it for fear of being labeled a reaction
ary "covert racist."
This view reeks of tunnel vision on
Grigg's part: African-American fears
are valid whereas a Caucasian's are
delusions resulting from paranoia and
inherent racism.
I am hurt and angry that my
feelings would be completely in
validated. In response to a factual des

cription, I was told that I lied, pur
posefully fanned the flames of white
paranoia toward black people and was
a covert racist.
I refuse to accept Grigg's labels. Rac
ism is not OK, no matter what colors
are involved, and I refuse to deny the
anger I feel toward my attackers.
