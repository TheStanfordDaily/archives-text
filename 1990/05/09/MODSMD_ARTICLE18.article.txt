# Cheerleaders bolster a program which already has priority

Cheerleaders at Stanford are just
another case of pampering for the foot

ball team. I think 85 full scholarships
is more than sufficient. I don't imagine
that a similar recommendation from
the coaches of other sports on campus
would be met with such enthusiasm
from Andy Geiger.
So the football team needs cheer
leaders to win. Well, it would be nice if
the other teams were provided with
simply the leftovers from the football
team's summer training table at Bran
ner Hall.
And it would be nice if club sports
received one-hundredth of the student
and alumni support that the football
team er\joys. I guess it's just another
case of the rich getting richer.
