# COP election certified, 11-7
## Opposing senators, 30 observers walk out of Senate 
### Brent Bigler Jock Friedly Staff writers 
While observers shouted catcalls of
"travesty of justice" and "joke," the
ASSU Senate last night certified the
results of the 1990 spring election.
The 11-7 roll call vote for certifica
tion, with one abstention, fell largely
along party lines. Because election cer
tification is binding and irreversible,
students who contested the results
during the past two weeks have no other
avenue of appeal, and the certification
closes the door on further ASSU action.
After the vote, many independent and

Students First senators joined about 30
observers chanting "bullshit" and
walked out of the meeting. The senate
meeting continued with 11 senators,
enough to make a quorum.
The result of the highly charged meet
ing caused some senate observers to say
the ASSU has lost its legitimacy as a
student government. However, People's
Platform senators charged that the pro
testers and opposing senators have
trivialized the ASSU and subverted the
democratic process.
The April 18-19 election was thrown
into controversy when Steve Krauss,
ASSU elections commissioner, decided
to invalidate 275 write-in votes cast for

the Council of Presidents. The ballots
were marked with votes for popular car
toon characters such as the "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles," "The Simpsons"
and other ineligible slates.
If the discarded votes were counted,
a runoff election would have occurred
between People Platform's "Four Our
Future" and Students First's "A Clean
Slate" because neither slate would have
had a majority of all votes cast.
Many objectors to the certification
bill said that because of the confusion
about the ASSU Bylaws, a third-party
mediation group should judge the elec-
tion's validity before senate cer
tification.
Krauss said before the vote on
certification, "If the senate
decides to reopen this issue, we
would advocate sending this once
and for all to a third party."
Before senators voted on the
certification bill, independent
senator Sheila Hayre, a sopho
more, introduced a separate bill
calling for the "parties involved
in the controversy agree to arbi
tration by a nonpartisan, indepen
dent body . .. which shall advise
these parties and make recom
mendations concerning the elec
tions dispute."
The bill failed on an 8-7 roll
call vote with four abstentions.
During debate on the certifica
tion bill, People's Platform
senator Louis Jackson, a junior,
called the contestation of the elec
tion "a mockery of the democratic
process. ... It makes me sick to
see us running in circles and
talking about cartoon characters."

However, graduate senator
Douglas Bone said "people who
are writing 'screw the ASSU' (for
write-in votes) are expressing
opinions." He added that the elec
tion results should reflect those
opinions and to deny a runoff is
"hypocrisy, partisanship,
demagoguery and wrong."
Graduate senator Ziad Sarkis
led the call for the walkout.
Asked after the meeting
whether he had any comment, a
disheartened Krauss said, "Noth
ing new to add. It's a mess, and
it's really unfortunate."
Tempers were still flaring and
emotions ran high after the senate
walkout.
Junior Tim Marklein, a Stu
dents First COP candidate, said
he wasn't surprised by the vote,
but he thought senators ignored
yesterday's Daily poll showing
that more than two-thirds of stu
dents wanted a runoff election.
"The students spoke out clearly
about what they want, and the
senate clearly rejected them,"
Marklein said.
Gottshalk, Marklein, Bone and
others said they were outraged
that the senate ignored Krauss

when he said he would be willing
to have a third party abjudicate
the election controversy.
However, William Faucette,
ASSU administrative manager
and Krauss's supervisor, said a
third-party mediator would un
dermine Krauss's authority as a
nonpartisan elections commis
sioner. "You can't say that his
ruling is partisan," Faucette said.
David Brown, a current People's
Platform COP member, said, "We
have to take the responsibility to
vote for legitimate candidates.
We're not talking about democ
racy in Disneyland."
Chaparral editor Victor Payan
said he was organizing a takeover
of the X-'TV office last night. He
added that he and other protest
ers were giving up on the ASSU
office occupation, which has been
going on for the last two weeks.
One student chimed in, "There's
no reason to occupy it because
it's no longer the student govern
ment."
In other business, the senate
adopted the Program Board
budget for spring quarter and ap
proved the discretionary allot
ments of the Publications Board.
