While observers shouted catcalls of
"travesty of justice" and "joke," the
ASSU Senate last night certified the
results of the 1990 spring election.
The 11-7 roll call vote for certifica

students who contested the results
during the past two weeks have no other
avenue of appeal, and the certification
closes the door on further ASSU action.
After the vote, many independent and

Students First senators joined about 30
observers chanting "bullshit" and
walked out of the meeting. The senate
meeting continued with 11 senators,
enough to make a quorum.
The result of the highly charged meet

the ASSU has lost its legitimacy as a
student government. However, People's
Platform senators charged that the pro

trivialized the ASSU and subverted the
democratic process.

Mutant Ninja Turtles," "The Simpsons"
and other ineligible slates.
If the discarded votes were counted,
a runoff election would have occurred
between People Platform's "Four Our
Future" and Students First's "A Clean
Slate" because neither slate would have
had a majority of all votes cast.
Many objectors to the certification
bill said that because of the confusion
about the ASSU Bylaws, a third-party
mediation group should judge the elec-
