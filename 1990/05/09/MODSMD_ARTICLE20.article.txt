## GALA week promotes love 
### 
I FIRST ADMITTED I liked boys
when I was four years old. I was in
the living room watching television
with my mother. I don't remember what
we were watching, but in one scene two
men were hugging. The two men weren't
that cute, but the scene did get me ex
cited. So I turned to my momma and
said "They make my thing stick straight
up!" (Kids say the darndest things!)
All of sudden momma was asleep, or
dead. In any case she didn't say a word.
I didn't pay her too much mind, because
I was much too interested in what was
going on on the TV screen.
A year or two later, I admitted it again,
this time to my sister. One day she and
I were talking about relationships (as if
we had a whole lot to talk about — well,
there was Barbie and Ken). Anyway, I
told my sister I had a boyfriend named
Carl. Carl was fine, at least for a 6-year
old, and he and I used to "smooch" on
the jungle gym during recess.
So I told my sister, thinking she'd be
happy for me. Boy was I wrong. My sister
screamed, "OOOOHH, I'm gonna tell
momma!"
She was going to tell momma?
She was gonna tell momma. That's
why momma was acting so strange
before. It was then that I understood
that homosexuality was something evil,
something so bad that even your mother
would stop loving you.
By that time, some of the kids at school
had already started calling me "faggot"
and "sissy." I didn't know why at first,

but then I learned that "real" boys didn't
walk or talk the way I did. In order to
survive, I threw myself in the closet —
a steel-bolted, soundproof, combination
lock closet.
I wasn't gonna be anybody's "faggot"
or "sissy." I was gonna be Macho Man.
I was gonna brag about gettin' poontang,
hold my crotch and shoot hoop just like
the rest of the fellas.
I was playing the role to the hilt, but
I don't think I was fooling anybody, be
cause people would still ask me if I was
a "faggot." Can you believe that? People
had the nerve to ask me to my face
whether or not I was a "faggot." (Black
folks are bold!) I almost told them "yes"
just because they had the nerve to ask.
But it took 12 years for me to gain
the self-confidence — self-love — to once
again admit that I was attracted to men.
Stanford and the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford were crucial in my de
veloping a positive gay identity.
Growing up in Akron, Ohio, where the
only contact I had with known gay people
was through television, it was easy to
feel isolated. It's a wonder I didn't put
a gun to my head or jump off a bridge,
as so many of television's gay characters
do.
Well, I don't like guns or heights, and
I don't look good in red, so I decided to
come out. And guess who I told? That's
right — I told the family.
This time momma didn't play dead.
Instead, my family simply said, "We love
you." In fact, my family knew I was gay

the whole time, and they were just
waiting for me to tell them. (To think,
I spent all that money on Homecoming
for nothing.) I felt as if I were reborn.
Unfortunately, there are some people
out there who would rather I had jumped
off a bridge. Recent threats I've received
remind me that I am despised simply
because I love men.
Although being gay encompasses a
whole lot more than sex, there's some
thing about what gay people do in bed
that scares the hell out of a lot of people.
Some people are so scared that they'd
rather kill a gay person than face their
fears. Now that's scary
In most people's eyes homosexuality is
an unnatural act, an abomination. For
me, loving a man, emotionally, spiritually
and sexually is as natural and as much
a gift from God as breathing.
It took me 12 years to start living
again. For me, Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week, sponsored by GLAS, is a
celebration of my rebirth. GALA Week
reminds me of the total beauty of gay
life: men loving men, women loving wom
en, gay people loving themselves.
