## Michael Stevenson Fear kept student from coming out of the closet 
### 
LOOKING BACK ON life, it's hard
for me to pick the first time I
thought, "Gee, I guess I'm gay."
I do remember my earliest recollections
involving my grade-school gym teacher,
and how I hoped I would grow up to
be just like him: strong, attractive,
popular. Maybe all boys thought like
that, but I was thinking of how I'd
impress and win their attention, not
the girls'.
Those feelings never changed. Then
there was David in my fifth-grade
class, who I wished with all my might
would be my best friend forever, but
whenever I got to talk with him I
clammed up with fear — afraid inside,
but not knowing why.
By the time I finished junior high I
realized that I wasn't feeling the same
toward girls as other boys did. I
couldn't give it a name yet, but I
reacted by becoming more introverted
while everyone else dated.
Studying was my haven, my excuse
for not going out. Surprisingly enough,
the boys did pay me more attention
(albeit enviously) when my name kept
appearing at the top of the honor roll.
That was incentive enough to keep up
the grades.
High school got stickier, for child
hood innocence was no longer an
excuse not to date. A few girls were

interested in me, and I liked them —
but just as friends. Their dating invita
tions really made me nervous, yet I
still refused to comprehend the enor
mity of my feelings.
Looking back, I realize now that 1
had led a very sheltered life. I can't
recall ever having seen a labeled homo
sexual in my high school. (I don't
know, maybe I had extra large blinders
on.)
I couldn't truly label and accept my
own feelings as gay until I got to
college. By then I knew that I was
part of a hidden minority that for the
most part was looked at with scorn. I
had to decide how I would live with
my fear.
I chose to stay in the closet — it
made sense to me. I'd grown up in an
environment where heterosexual rela
tionships were advertised on television,
in books, at home, at school and in the
malls. Society had designated straights
as OK, gays not. Strike one.
I'd heard about gay bashings. Strike
two. I couldn't bear seeing disgust
show on my friends' faces if I told
them. Strike three, yeeer sexual life's
OUTTA THE GAME!! Still, I can't
fully blame society for shutting me in
the closet. I gave it permission.
College life rolled by uneventfully.
On the outside I was cool and aloof,

too busy mtgoring in chemistry and
music to socialize, while inside I was
miserable. Something had to break,
and I was afraid it was going to be
me.
Then my way out of the closet came
in the guise of grad school. Getting a
Ph.D. in chemistry was important, but
even more so was leaving home for
new surroundings where I could start
over on life and be me. I migrated
west, knowing that I would finally find
a close and intimate relationship that I
had only heard of otherwise.
Well, I found one. But it took almost
a year to develop physically. I had
conditioned myself so well to being
alone that it scared me to give myself
completely to another man. Also, deep
inside I was still hoping to go straight
— I realize now that I was only delud
ing myself.
And sure enough, I ended up back in
the closet by not telling my straight
friends of my gay identity. Both my
significant other and I kept it all a
secret, and that, along with my confu
sion over sexual intimacy, basically
killed our relationship. Fear killed it.
That was over a year ago. At first I
was devastated, afraid of being alone
again. My scrambled mind put a strain
on all my friendships, and I never
confided to anyone. I thought I was

going to explode .. . until Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Week came in May
1989.
That was the lifejacket that saved
me. Reading The Daily's coverage of
other gay men and lesbians who were
out of the closet and seemingly happy
for it gave me the courage to start
going to weekly gay counseling meet
ings. That's when I finally came out of
the closet to myself.
Life has been pretty busy since then.
First, I had to learn how to really love
myself, with all my attributes and
faults. That was hard.
I also learned that not everyone is
either gay or straight; it's common for
people to experience a whole range of
attraction toward the same sex. Then I
had to get used to being around other
gay men without feeling a sort of
unstated sexual tension (it was like
being in junior high again — it still
is).
I came out to my immediate family
last fall, and haven't regretted it since.
The shadow of AIDS ultimately fell
over me, and I had to conquer my fear
of the disease and its stigma. I also
went through a stage of wanting to
help others, and so got involved with
volunteer work.
Now I'm ready to help myself. I've
finally banished my Fear.

It's been a long, hard road to follow.
I can't see where it stretches before
me, but I don't regret following it. It
took me 24 years to get to this day in
my life where I could come out to you,
and all I can say is thank God I found
myself now instead of in another 24
years.
I'm gay, and I'm not going to
change. I don't want to. I can find
that same happiness with another man
that straight people have with the
opposite sex. The intimacy and close
ness is there to be grasped, like that
dangling ring at the merry-go-round.
It's there for us all to seize.

dent in chemistry. This is the second in
a four-part series on his feelings about
being gay.
