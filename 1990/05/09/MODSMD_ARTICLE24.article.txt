## Database helps endangered species 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
There has never been a hunger
strike to protest cruelty against
the Oregon silverspot butterfly.
No one has yet manufactured
"Save the Silverspot" bumper
stickers. And Sigourney Weaver
has yet to win an Oscar for "But
terflies in the Mist."
And yet the Oregon silverspot
butterfly is in more danger of ex
tinction than the panda, the whale
or the mountain gorilla.
The problem is that "large char
ismatic animals have always been
the center of conservation atten
tion," says Dennis Murphy, direc
tor of the Center for Conservation
Biology. "And 99 percent of the
endangered species are not those
currently under conservation," he
continues. Hundreds of lesser
known species are approaching ex
tinction unnoticed.
Researchers at the Center for
Conservation Biology are nearing
completion of a computer
database that may help identify
potentially threatened organisms
that have not yet earned the con
cern of the public. The Global
Species Database links the world's
mammal, bird and butterfly
species, their distributions and
habitats and the rate at which
these habitats are being altered.
It will also be a useful reference
for species-specific data, including
conservation status and ecological
information.
Work on the project began over
four years ago, though it has re
ceived funds from the World
Wildlife Fund only in the past
two years. It is the first project
of its kind. The database currently
holds over 4,200 species of mam
mals and 9,100 species of birds

and includes information on their
global distribution. Half of the
planned butterfly species have
also been added. Information for
the database is gathered primarily
from literature and current re
search publications. "In the long
term, it would be helpful to access
museum databases as well," says
Murphy.
The main objective of the
database is to identify "extinction
hotspots." It overlays data on
species distribution and habitat
requirements with information on
rates of habitat conversion and
loss and human populations in a
given country or geographical
unit. The database can then
predict threatened regions and
thereby predict threatened
wildlife.
"It serves as something of a
barometer for gross environmen
tal changes and provides a good
transition from focusing on en
dangered species to endangered

ecosystems," says Murphy.
However, information on cer
tain geographical areas has
proven somewhat difficult to ac
quire. There is almost no research
on habitat conversion in Central
Asia and China. Indonesia, Zaire
and parts of Brazil and Peru have
also not been thoroughly studied.
This biases reports of conserva
tion needs.
"Places like Costa Rica are ex
tremely well-surveyed, so there is
an artificially high number of
relatively endangered species.
Nearby Honduras, however, has
hardly been researched at all, and
the numbers there are artificially
low," claims Murphy.
The database allows a relatively
unbiased and consistent global
analysis of threatened species, ac
cording to Thomas Sisk, a senior
staff researcher at the center who
has been involved in the project.
Adding butterflies to the database
has decreased the characteristic

vertebrate bias in most conserva
tion efforts to date. But the com
pilation of the distributions and
habitats of all the world's species
is an unreasonable goal.
The database will provide a new
approach to the concept of endan
gered species. Traditionally, the
view on the status of animal
species has been "extant until
proven extinct," says Kathy
Rehm, another senior researcher.
"We are reversing it."
As Sisk points out, the database
will provide a more realistic view
of the extinction problem, helping
conservationists identify areas
and species most in need of at
tention. But the conferral of pro
tective status on endangered
species sadly still relies on polit
ical processes that are motivated
to support animals with strong
public appeal or persuasive advo
cates. It may be a long time before
we'll see those "Save the Sil
verspot" bumper stickers.
