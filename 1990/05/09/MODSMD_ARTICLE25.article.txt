# Hard drives for Macs play hard to get
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It used to be easy to select a hard drive
for your Macintosh. Someone would ask:
"Which kind should I buy?"
Someone would answer, "Jasmine."
Unfortunately, things aren't so simple any
more. Jasmine recently sought protection from
creditors under Chapter XI. Apparently, the
firm's rapid expansion was built on a moun
tain of debt. Despite selling thousands of
drives over the past few years, they are unable
to pay the bills.
Whether the company is shipping any prod
uct at all is unclear. That they are not repair
ing any non-functioning drives is readily ap
parent to anyone who has sent in a Jasmine
to be fixed. A broken Jasmine does not even
make a good door stop.
For customers, it's an ugly situation. Every
one is recommending, and wisely so, to stay
away from Jasmine. Do not order from them.
Period.
Sounds great in principle. The problem is
that by shying away from what used to be
the most reliable drives in the Mac market.

consumers are guaranteeing
that Jasmine fails to emerge
from bankruptcy.
In other words, the repair de
partment will remain closed in
definitely and your two-year
warranty won't be worth very
much. Third-party repairs are
available for Jasmine drives
from a number of sources but
they cost over half as much as
a brand new drive.

Investing money to fix a broken Jasmine
seems like a bad investment. While these
repair groups will tack on a new one-year
warranty, they are still too costly.
Ehman Engineering (800-257-1666) does
not make the most technically advanced drives
out there, but they do sell them cheaply. If
you have a limited budget and a Jasmine
ready for the junk heap, check out Ehman
before seeking costly repairs on your present
drive.
New Mac .buyers who are purchasing
through Microdisc should purchase hard
drive-equipped machines. The floppy-based
Macintosh is nearly obsolete and the price

premium for the hard drive mac
hines is less than the cost of
any new drive.
Apple's new one-year war
ranty on its computer will
protect you against virtually any
defects that crop up. Plus,
though there was a period re
cently where Apple interned hard
drives were malfunctioning left
and right, the company tradi
tionally has shipped a quality

product.
If you're looking for higher-capacity storage
or upgrading a machine you already own,
there are a number of company's drives worth
considering. Micro Net Tedinology (714-837-
6033) has captured the technological high
ground and sells a complete line of drives.
Other brands worth looking into include La
Cie (800-999-0143), which also sells modems,
monitors and scanners; General Computer
Corporation (800-422-7777), the oldest maker
of Macintosh hard drives; and Storage Dimen
sions (408-879-0300), which makes its own
mechanisms.
