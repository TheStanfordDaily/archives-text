Q # / need a new pair of sun
• glasses, and a friend tells
me that 1 ought to make sure
that they protect against UV,
that I shouldn't get a cheap
pair. Can you advise?
A .The Bugs assume that
• you mean ultraviolet ra
diation and not ultra-violence
from futuristic hoods. Accord
ing to the August 1988 issue
of Consumer Reports, excessive
exposure to UV can damage
your eyes, especially if you have
had cataract surgery.
The first two components of
your eye which light passes
through, the cornea and the
lens, act as UV filters for the
sensitive retina at the back of
the eye. Radiation of
wavelengths shorter than 295
nanometers is almost com
pletely absorbed by molecules
in the cornea. Although this
results in some cellular dam
age, this is of little consequence
to the cornea, which can repair
itself rapidly.
UV radiation above 295
nanometers which makes it
through the cornea is stopped
by the lens. Unfortunately, the
lens does not share the cornea's
ability to repair itself. Accum
ulated damage due to UV ab
sorption may contribute to the
gradual denaturation of the
lens proteins. The denatured
proteins can form a cataract.
To minimize eye exposure to
strong UV radiation, you can
stay in the library on bright
sunny days or invest in a pair
of sunglasses. Consumer
Reports tested 180 pairs of sun
glasses for their ability to ab
sorb UV light. They found that
every pair, whether they cost
$8 or $150, blocked 95 percent
or more of UVB. UVB is
wavelengths below 318
nanometers, the most damag
ing part of the UV spectrum.
This is a level that should be
quite adequate for general use,
such as hanging out in White
Plaza.
Although it may be neces
sary to spend big bucks to
really impress the poseurs in
White Plaza, it is not necessary
to do so to get better eye protec
tion.
, I have a Macintosh like
\?J • so many other students
ana am wondering how impor
tant it is to have one of those
multi-outlet noise/surge sup
pressors. What are the chances
that my computer will fry if I
don't have one? Also, my dorm
room has only two-pronged out
lets. Will this negate the effects

of the surge suppressor?
A. Since the author of that
• question claimed to be a
junior in Electrical Engineer
ing here at Stanford, we
decided to call MIT which ob
viously has a more substantial
EE department. The nerds
there told us that most surge
suppressors contain two types
of electronic protection: Elec
tromagnetic Interference fil
ters and Metal-Oxide Varistors.
Both types are designed to
protect your computer from po
tentially dangerous variations
in the voltage coming from
your outlets.
EMI filters are designed to
selectively pass the 60-cycle
per-second power line fre
quency, but block higher
frequencies. Light dimmers,
motor speed controls and fluo
rescent lights all produce high
frequency noise which is
carried by the power lines to
your computer. This noise is
in the right frequency range to
be mistaken for data by the
computer and cause soft errors
such as dropped digits, crashes
and lost data.
MOVs are designed to absorb
high-voltage, high-energy
surges which cannot be blocked
by EMI filters. These surges
are most commonly produced
by nearby lightning strikes and
msyor Con-Ed glitches. With
out MOVs, these surges could
pass through your computer's
power supply and burn out
sensitive components.
Just like so-called
earthquake-proof buildings,
EMI filters and MOVs do not
make you invulnerable to all
nastiness. If the EMI is strong
enough (big motors on the
same circuit as your room for
example), it will get through
and cause soft errors. Likewise,
if lightning strikes your power
pole, your computer will be
nuked, MOVs or not.
