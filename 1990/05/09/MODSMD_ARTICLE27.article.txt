## Card comes out smelling all right 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO — A win is a win is
a win, but some don't smell so great.
In fact, there a was a rather strong odor
emanating yesterday fom San Francisco
State's Maloney Field, as the Golden Gators
(think about it) came up with the wrong
plays at the wrong times to hand the Stan
ford baseball team an 11-inning, 10-6 win.

Cardinal 10

Golden Gators 6

The fragrance that filled the air after
the Cardinal scored five times in the top
of the eleventh probably doesn't have a
name, but if it did, it'd be something along
the lines of "Eau d'Error." Of the 10 Car
dinal runs, exactly three were earned. And
one of those came on a wild pitch.
Ugh. The Stanford win, which would
have been a defeat if not for a heads-up
diving catch by second baseman Troy Paul
sen in the bottom of the 10th with no one
out, gives the Cardinal a 47-9 record
heading into this weekend's series against
use.
The Stanford lineup, which had pasted
California last weekend, spent most of yes
terday's game trying to do just a little too
much against starter Kevin Rowe-Cerveny,
and it showed. "I think we all felt all right
at the plate," Paulsen said. "The problem
was we kept trying to pull his breaking
stuff, and when you do that you end up
with a lot of grounders in the infield."
"I felt good at the plate — they were
just making great pitches," said Paul Carey,
who was 0-for-five with three strikeouts
before crushing his 14th homer of the year
in the 11th. The dong, a three-run monster
that flew over the fence in right, landed
halfway up a neighboring 50-foot hill and
finished off the Gators, gives Carey 54 for
his career, tying USC's Mark McGwire and
Gonzaga's Jeff Hainline atop the Pacific
10 Conference career homer list.
Of course, Carey almost didn't get the
chance to write his name in the record
book, because Rowe-Cerveny and reliever
Shane Francisco (where do these names
come from?) were keeping the Cardinal
quiet for most of the game. "My hat's off
to that first guy," Carey said. "He pitched
a hell of a game."
True, but he wasn't getting a heck of a
lot of help from his defense. In the first,
with David Holbrook batting, Jeff Ham

monds on third and Paulsen on second,
Holbrook sent a bouncer toward third base
man Raymund Sabado, whose throw to
first was in the dirt. Alan Barsoom thought
he'd dug the ball out cleanly, but, after
Holbrook was called safe (allowing Ham
monds to score), Barsoom decided to argue
with the umpire instead of making sure
Paulsen had stopped at third.
Barsoom also made the minor mistake
of leaving the ball lying on the ground,
and by the time he realized his goof, picked
up the ball and threw home, Paulsen was
in standing up. Two-zip.
The Cardinal scored twice more in the
fourth (once on a wild pitch) and, after
SFSU pulled close with a sacrifice fly and
a wild-pitch run of its own, Ryan Turner
made it 5-2 with his fourth home run (all
of them solo) of the year.
That should have been enough, but
reliever Brian Sackinsky, the fourth Stan
ford pitcher on the day, couldn't close the
door. In the ninth, with the score 5-3,
Sackinsky gave up three straight singles,
making it 5-4. (The second of those hits
was a pure double-play ball right in front
of Paulsen that hit the edge of the grass,
found a hidden trampoline, took a "we're
entering-orbit-now" hop and ended up in
center.) A sacrifice and intentional walk
later, the bases were loaded with one down
for A 1 Malina.
Bouncer deep to short. Roger Burnett
up with it, over to Paulsen for the force
at the second, on to first. . .not in time.
Darn close, though.
The run tied it up, sending the game to
the 10th. After Stanford stranded two in
the top of the inning, Craig Pearson drew
a leadoff walk from Scott Weiss. Sabado
was next, and he hit a liner to the right
of second — right into the diving Paulsen's
glove. Pearson never had a chance.
"He hit it off the nose of the bat, and
I just took two steps and dove," Paulsen
said. "I figured the other guy would be off
first." He was, and the double play loomed
large when the next batter doubled down
the left field line.
The Cardinal finally broke through
against Francisco in the 11th, as Roger
Burnett led off with a triple. Neither Troy
Tallman nor Mark Skeels could bring him
in, but then both Hammonds and Paulsen
walked.
Bases loaded, two outs. David McCarty
sent a bouncer to third, and Sabado dove,
grabbed it, and landed flat-out on his belly.
Sabado got to his knees, made the throw
over to second in time to force Paulsen . . .

A-The same 132 sadistic yokels who showed up at the
USF and St. Mary's games,
SAN FRANCISCO — A win is a win is
a win, but some don't smell so great.
In fact, there a was a rather strong odor
emanating yesterday fom San Francisco
State's Maloney Field, as the Golden Gators
(think about it) came up with the wrong
plays at the wrong times to hand the Stan
ford baseball team an 11-inning, 10-6 win.

Baseball

Cardinal 10

Golden Gators 6

The fragrance that filled the air after
the Cardinal scored five times in the top
of the eleventh probably doesn't have a
name, but if it did, it'd be something along
the lines of "Eau d'Error." Of the 10 Car
dinal runs, exactly three were earned. And
one of those came on a wild pitch.
Ugh. The Stanford win, which would
have been a defeat if not for a heads-up
diving catch by second baseman Troy Paul
sen in the bottom of the 10th with no one
out, gives the Cardinal a 47-9 record
heading into this weekend's series against
use.
The Stanford lineup, which had pasted
California last weekend, spent most of yes
terday's game trying to do just a little too
much against starter Kevin Rowe-Cerveny,
and it showed. "I think we all felt all right
at the plate," Paulsen said. "The problem
was we kept trying to pull his breaking
stuff, and when you do that you end up
with a lot of grounders in the infield."
"I felt good at the plate — they were
just making great pitches," said Paul Carey,
who was 0-for-five with three strikeouts
before crushing his 14th homer of the year
in the 11th. The dong, a three-run monster
that flew over the fence in right, landed
halfway up a neighboring 50-foot hill and
finished off the Gators, gives Carey 54 for
his career, tying USC's Mark McGwire and
Gonzaga's Jeff Hainline atop the Pacific
10 Conference career homer list.
Of course, Carey almost didn't get the
chance to write his name in the record
book, because Rowe-Cerveny and reliever
Shane Francisco (where do these names
come from?) were keeping the Cardinal
quiet for most of the game. "My hat's off
to that first guy," Carey said. "He pitched
a hell of a game."
True, but he wasn't getting a heck of a
lot of help from his defense. In the first,
with David Holbrook batting, Jeff Ham

monds on third and Paulsen on second,
Holbrook sent a bouncer toward third base
man Raymund Sabado, whose throw to
first was in the dirt. Alan Barsoom thought
he'd dug the ball out cleanly, but, after
Holbrook was called safe (allowing Ham
monds to score), Barsoom decided to argue
with the umpire instead of making sure
Paulsen had stopped at third.
Barsoom also made the minor mistake
of leaving the ball lying on the ground,
and by the time he realized his goof, picked
up the ball and threw home, Paulsen was
in standing up. Two-zip.
The Cardinal scored twice more in the
fourth (once on a wild pitch) and, after
SFSU pulled close with a sacrifice fly and
a wild-pitch run of its own, Ryan Turner
made it 5-2 with his fourth home run (all
of them solo) of the year.
That should have been enough, but
reliever Brian Sackinsky, the fourth Stan
ford pitcher on the day, couldn't close the
door. In the ninth, with the score 5-3,
Sackinsky gave up three straight singles,
making it 5-4. (The second of those hits
was a pure double-play ball right in front
of Paulsen that hit the edge of the grass,
found a hidden trampoline, took a "we're
entering-orbit-now" hop and ended up in
center.) A sacrifice and intentional walk
later, the bases were loaded with one down
for A 1 Malina.
Bouncer deep to short. Roger Burnett
up with it, over to Paulsen for the force
at the second, on to first. . .not in time.
Darn close, though.
The run tied it up, sending the game to
the 10th. After Stanford stranded two in
the top of the inning, Craig Pearson drew
a leadoff walk from Scott Weiss. Sabado
was next, and he hit a liner to the right
of second — right into the diving Paulsen's
glove. Pearson never had a chance.
"He hit it off the nose of the bat, and
I just took two steps and dove," Paulsen
said. "I figured the other guy would be off
first." He was, and the double play loomed
large when the next batter doubled down
the left field line.
The Cardinal finally broke through
against Francisco in the 11th, as Roger
Burnett led off with a triple. Neither Troy
Tallman nor Mark Skeels could bring him
in, but then both Hammonds and Paulsen
walked.
Bases loaded, two outs. David McCarty
sent a bouncer to third, and Sabado dove,
grabbed it, and landed flat-out on his belly.
Sabado got to his knees, made the throw
over to second in time to force Paulsen . . .
