Monday's intramural wrestling
meet kicked off a busy month for
IM competition.
Kappa Sigma edged Roble for
first-place honors in the meet,
which included about thirty
wrestlers representing eight
teams. Donner took the bronze,
and Biz I came in fourth.
The wrestling meet is one of
four single-day events sponsored
by the IM office in May. Next on
the agenda is the IM swimming
and diving meet, which takes
place at deGuerre Pool Thursday,
May 17, starting at 2:00 p.m. On
Sunday, May 20 at 10:00 a.m. the
IM bike race gets rolling at the
intersection of Campus Drive and
Serra Street. And on Thursday,
May 24, beginning at 2:30 p.m.,
the gun goes off at the Stanford
Stadium for the annual track and

field meet.
Stanford-affiliated teams and
independent participants are wel
come to compete in any and all
events. Participants may register
on the day of the event thirty
minutes before competition
begins.
Intramural director Howard
Dallmar urges competitors to "be
on time" for registration so that
the events will run smoothly. He
added that both the swim and
track meets, formerly two-day
events, have been limited to a
single day to accomodate more
participants and minimize logisti
cal problems.
Although the last six track
meets have been concluded in one
day, the possibility exists that
some events might have to be
completed on Friday, May 25.
Intramural Staff member Jim
Johnston called the meets "the

Stanford-affiliated
teams and indepen
dent participants are
welcome to compete
in any and all events.

two most fun events of the year."
He went on to say that there is
"no better combination of fun and
sun. I love it!"
The swim meet features solo
and relay events. The diving com
petition will be judged by mem
bers of the varsity swim team.
Plans for the bike race were
finalized yesterday. Riders will
complete eight laps of a .7-mile
loop on campus pavement starting
and finishing at the Serra Com
plex near the intersection of
Campus Drive and Serra Street.

Members of the Stanford Cycling
Club will be on hand to supervise
the event.
All riders must wear proper
headgear, and their bikes must
undergo a safety check.
Participants in the track meet
may compete in a variety of
dashes, jumps, and distance runs.
But the only field event offered
is the shot put.
IM staffer Theo Smith said,
"We don't do the javelin or pole
vault for safety reasons."
