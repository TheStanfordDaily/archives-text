# Of IM soccer games and other memories

### 
For the past two weeks,
hardly a day has gone by
where I haven't found
myself talking about the
weather. The sun is always
shining brightly and the tem
perature has been just about
perfect.
When I came to California
almost five years ago, this is
what I hoped it would be like
all the time. My hopes were
dashed when it rained for eight
straight days during my first
year here. But that seems like
an eternity ago.
In the winter of 1985, after
that endless storm subsided, a
naive group of freshmen who
called Rinconada home were
playing in the intramural soc
cer playoffs. The foolish lads
believed they could win a B
league championship.
The details are hazy at this
point, but the scenario went
something liek this: A couple
of rounds into the playoffs, the
team was locked in a 0-0 tie.
With less than two minutes to
play, the Opponents scored a
fluke goal and eliminated our
heroes by a score of 1-0.
A year later, those same men,
now sophomores, lived in
houses all across the Stanford
campus. When it was time to
play, though, they came out
from Schiff and from Cedro.
From Kappa Sigma and Loro.
Again, they thought they could
be crowned champs.
They went by the name Rinc
in-Exile and reached the middle
rounds of the playoffs. Another
defensive battle resulted in an
other 0-0 score. Time was run
ning out when the Opponents
pushed the ball upfield and had
a golden opportunity to score.
One of them blasted a shot
past the goalie. He dove but
could not stop it. No, not again!
As the ball was about to roll
in, a fullback came out of
nowhere and attempted to
clear the ball.
He wound up his right leg
and let fly a ferocious kick. Un
obstructed, the ball would have
reached midfield. Then, all of
the sudden, the ball's path was
blocked. The goalkeeper was
recovering from his save at
tempt and, as he was standing
up, the ball ricocheted off his
back.
It was headed straight for
the goal. NO, NOT AGAIN!
Everyone on the field froze for
an instant as the ball rolled in
to make it 1-0. Our heroes were
demoralized. Only a few
minutes remained and they
knew they could not come back.
In Hollywood, there would
be a happy ending to this story.
As juniors, they would try
again to win the title they
coveted. (They did.) And they
would fail. (They did.)
Then, in their final year at
Stanford, the seniors would fi
nally break through and win
it all. They would go out and
celebrate and drink themselves
silly. But there was no cham
pionship for this group of Rin
cadelts.

Last June, as most of them
prepared to head for the Real
World, the group got together
one final time. They
reminisced. They promised to
keep in touch. They looked
back and they looked ahead.
No doubt some were ready
to move on. Four years of
paradise was enough. Others,
like myself, could probably stay
here forever.
Every Tuesday afternoon we
could clear the dried mud from
our cleats, lace them up tight
and head for that same field.
Rain or shine. Hot or cold. It
wouldn't make any difference.
We would be there.

No, not to avenge a defeat.
That really makes no differ
ence.
We would be there to spend
some time together. To run free
and forget about all the work
we have to do. To escape for
an hour and create another
memory that will always be
with us.
In a world that moves inex
orably forward it is easy to for
get what we have left behind.
Every second that ticks off the
clock is gone forever unless we
choose to remember it.
My future is so uncertain
that I would be crazy to project
where I'll be or what I'll be
doing five years from now. One
thing I do know is that this
place, and the people I have
shared it with, will always be
with me.
My dreams will be filled with
visions of that soccer field. Of
making the perfect pass that a
teammate turned into the
game-winning goal. Of lying on
the grassy hill at Sunken Dia
mond with the summer sun
beating down on me.
Of the times when reality
took a timeout and I could just
disappear into the moment and
feel like it would never end.
Life is unquestionably too
short. There is so much going
on in the present, so much
planning for the future, that
one cannot spend too much
time reliving the past.
On these lazy, cloudless,
everything's-all-right-in-the
world days, though, it somehow
seems right to forget all the
rules and just remember.

alone, he'll get lost thinking
about the old days. Then the
phone will ring and it'll be his
editor telling him to finish the
damn story.

For the past two weeks,
hardly a day has gone by
where I haven't found
myself talking about the
weather. The sun is always
shining brightly and the tem
perature has been just about
perfect.
When I came to California
almost five years ago, this is
what I hoped it would be like
all the time. My hopes were
dashed when it rained for eight
straight days during my first
year here. But that seems like
an eternity ago.
In the winter of 1985, after
that endless storm subsided, a
naive group of freshmen who
called Rinconada home were
playing in the intramural soc
cer playoffs. The foolish lads
believed they could win a B
league championship.
The details are hazy at this
point, but the scenario went
something liek this: A couple
of rounds into the playoffs, the
team was locked in a 0-0 tie.
With less than two minutes to
play, the Opponents scored a
fluke goal and eliminated our
heroes by a score of 1-0.
A year later, those same men,
now sophomores, lived in
houses all across the Stanford
campus. When it was time to
play, though, they came out
from Schiff and from Cedro.
From Kappa Sigma and Loro.
Again, they thought they could
be crowned champs.
They went by the name Rinc
in-Exile and reached the middle
rounds of the playoffs. Another
defensive battle resulted in an
other 0-0 score. Time was run
ning out when the Opponents
pushed the ball upfield and had
a golden opportunity to score.
One of them blasted a shot
past the goalie. He dove but
could not stop it. No, not again!
As the ball was about to roll
in, a fullback came out of
nowhere and attempted to
clear the ball.
He wound up his right leg
and let fly a ferocious kick. Un
obstructed, the ball would have
reached midfield. Then, all of
the sudden, the ball's path was
blocked. The goalkeeper was
recovering from his save at
tempt and, as he was standing
up, the ball ricocheted off his
back.
It was headed straight for
the goal. NO, NOT AGAIN!
Everyone on the field froze for
an instant as the ball rolled in
to make it 1-0. Our heroes were
demoralized. Only a few
minutes remained and they
knew they could not come back.
In Hollywood, there would
be a happy ending to this story.
As juniors, they would try
again to win the title they
coveted. (They did.) And they
would fail. (They did.)
Then, in their final year at
Stanford, the seniors would fi
nally break through and win
it all. They would go out and
celebrate and drink themselves
silly. But there was no cham
pionship for this group of Rin
cadelts.

Last June, as most of them
prepared to head for the Real
World, the group got together
one final time. They
reminisced. They promised to
keep in touch. They looked
back and they looked ahead.
No doubt some were ready
to move on. Four years of
paradise was enough. Others,
like myself, could probably stay
here forever.
Every Tuesday afternoon we
could clear the dried mud from
our cleats, lace them up tight
and head for that same field.
Rain or shine. Hot or cold. It
wouldn't make any difference.
We would be there.

No, not to avenge a defeat.
That really makes no differ
ence.
We would be there to spend
some time together. To run free
and forget about all the work
we have to do. To escape for
an hour and create another
memory that will always be
with us.
In a world that moves inex
orably forward it is easy to for
get what we have left behind.
Every second that ticks off the
clock is gone forever unless we
choose to remember it.
My future is so uncertain
that I would be crazy to project
where I'll be or what I'll be
doing five years from now. One
thing I do know is that this
place, and the people I have
shared it with, will always be
with me.
My dreams will be filled with
visions of that soccer field. Of
making the perfect pass that a
teammate turned into the
game-winning goal. Of lying on
the grassy hill at Sunken Dia
mond with the summer sun
beating down on me.
Of the times when reality
took a timeout and I could just
disappear into the moment and
feel like it would never end.
Life is unquestionably too
short. There is so much going
on in the present, so much
planning for the future, that
one cannot spend too much
time reliving the past.
On these lazy, cloudless,
everything's-all-right-in-the
world days, though, it somehow
seems right to forget all the
rules and just remember.
