# Fats re-evaluated in Stanford study
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
A Stanford study published today
debunks the idea that olive oil and other
monounsaturated fats are healthier
than polyunsaturated fats found in corn
oil or safflower oil for people on low-fat,
low-cholesterol diets.
The study, which was designed by
nutritionist Darlene Dreon of the Stan
ford Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention, may lead to a marked change
in the medical community's dietary rec
ommendations for cholesterol reduction.
Until now, the results of all research
in this area have pointed to the negative
effects of polyunsaturated fats on
cholesterol levels, but these effects were
not confirmed in Dreon's results.
Dreon's 30-week study, which was re
leased today in the Journal of the Amer
ican Medical Association, observes and
assesses the effects of two different low

fat diets on cholesterol levels in 29 in
dividuals. The diets were identical
except that one emphasized polyun
saturated fats, such as corn oil, and the
other primarily used monounsaturated
fats, such as olive oil.
Dreon's results indicate that, all other
things being equal, there is no signifi
cant advantage in consuming either
monounsaturated or polyunsaturated
fats.
However, Dreon said her results do
not reverse the findings of previous
studies, since her experiment design was
significantly different.
All previous studies exploring the
risks and benefits of different un
saturated fats were conducted on indi
viduals consuming relatively high-fat
diets â€” in which fat makes up over 40
percent of the daily caloric intake.
Participants in Dreon's study, how
ever, were put on a low-fat diet, in
which fat content was kept under 30

percent of total calories, in accordance
with the American Heart Association's
guidelines.
Dr. William Connor, professor of med
icine and health science nutrition at the
University of Oregon, is one of the sci
entists who conducted cholesterol
studies using 40 percent fat diets. He
is now involved in research similar to
Dreon's, involving diets with lower fat
content.
"(Dreon's experiment] was a well
performed study," Connor said, "and it
fits in beautifully with our own ideas."
Connor is now conducting a three
year study on monounsaturated fats,
and preliminary results indicate similar
findings to Dreon's.
"I think the take-home message is
that if people consume a low-fat, low
cholesterol diet, they do not need to
concentrate on olive oil," said Connor.
