## Technicality deletes women's golfers victory at Calif. Intercollegiate 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Winning doesn't always mean victory. Just
ask the women's golf team.
Despite playing its best round of the year
and finishing even with the defending national
champion and currently No. 1 ranked team
in the country, the Cardinal was anything
but pleased after the final round of the Cal
ifornia Intercollegiate golf tournament.
Going into yesterday's round only one shot
behind powerhouse San Jose State, the Car
dinal proceeded to outshoot the Spartans by
one stroke to finish in a tie for first place.
Or so the squad thought. After the final
round was completed and after junior Jodi
Figley had sunk a clutch eight-foot putt on
the last shot of the day to give the Cardinal
its final score, a tournament official came up
to Figley and took the joy out of what had
seemed such a great day.
Her first round, and her second-place finish,
were invalidated.
Prompted by an opposing coaches' com
plaint, an official ruled that Figley had com
mitted an infraction on Monday in the first
round of the three-round tournament. For
this violation, Figley was awarded a two stroke
penalty.
But that wasn't enough. Since Figley had
signed her scorecard Monday without adding
on the penalty — which she didn't find out
about until Tuesday after the tournament was
over — the official ruled that she had signed
an incorrect card. Therefore, her score of 71
was disqualified. So instead of Figley's round,
which was the lowest of the first day, the
Cardinal had to count Stephanie Parel's round

of 87, which put them 16 shots behind San
Jose State at the end of the tournament.
Confused? Well don't worry, because it's all
very simple — if you can understand what
the official and an opposing coach were think
ing.
The controversy stemmed from an incident
on the 17th hole of the first round. While
Figley was getting ready to putt, her ball
moved on its own about one-eighth of an inch.
Not knowing what to do, Figley asked her
two playing partners what action to take, and
they all agreed that she should move it back
to its original spot. So Figley did that and
continued to play well the rest of the day,
finishing in first place.
Today, Figley and her teammates continued
the strong play, shooting a 294, good enough
to tie them for first with a 895 overall
showing. But then Figley was approached by
an official who asked her to explain her pre
vious day's actions, for the coach of another
squad had heard of the ball-"moving" and
had reported it as a playing infraction.
So instead of Cardinal victory and an indi
vidual second-place, Figley was disqualified
and Stanford had to settle for second.
"We're all pretty upset about it all," Steph
anie Davis said. "The timing of it is especially
annoying."
The Cardinal, you see, wasn't notified of
the infraction and its subsequent "new" plac
ing until after the victory celebration had
begun.
"You can't believe how disappointed the kids
are," Coach Tim Baldwin said. "We're all really
disappointed for Jody because she played so
well. We still feel that we played great as a
team.

"We usually go by what the playing partners
decide, but that didn't seem to matter to this
official."
In additon to its finish today, the incident
and the tournamet outcome will most likely
affect the Cardinal's NCAA seding. According
to Baldwin, there is a good chance Stanford
will now be seeded ninth instead of the sixth
or seventh ranking the squad might have re
ceived if it had won yesterday.
Nevertheless, the experience might help the
Cardinal in the long run. "We'll be a iittie
bit more motivated now in the NCAAs," Davis
said. "We're pretty fired up right now."
"They're going to have a real mission now
at nationals," Baldwin added.
Not everything in San Diego was bleak for
the squad, however. Despite a tough last round
of 76, sophomore Audrey Wooding finished
with a combined score of 223 — good for
third place individually. San Jose State's Pat
Hurst, the defending NCAA individual cham
pion, shot a 71 on the final round to win the
tournament title by one stroke over San Diego
State's Joann Walker.
Cardinal sophomore Davis, who just last
week was named to the Pacific 10 All-
Conference second team, came on.strong in
the closing round to finish in a tie for sixth
place with a score of 225.
Another powerful finisher was senior Steph
anie Parel. After a dismal opening day, Parel
rebounded and had the team-low score of the
day with a 71 on the final round. In fact, the
entire team, including Martha Richards, who
played as an unattached individual, had final
rounds of 77 or under Such consistency and
balance will undoubtedly be a key to the team's
future success.

penalty.
But that wasn't enough. Since Figley had
signed her scorecard Monday without adding
on the penalty — which she didn't find out
about until Tuesday after the tournament was
over — the official ruled that she had signed
an incorrect card. Therefore, her score of 71
was disqualified. So instead of Figley's round,
which was the lowest of the first day, the
Cardinal had to count Stephanie Parel's round

of 87, which put them 16 shots behind San
Jose State at the end of the tournament.
Confused? Well don't worry, because it's all
very simple — if you can understand what
the official and an opposing coach were think
ing.
The controversy stemmed from an incident
on the 17th hole of the first round. While
Figley was getting ready to putt, her ball
moved on its own about one-eighth of an inch.
Not knowing what to do, Figley asked her
two playing partners what action to take, and
they all agreed that she should move it back
to its original spot. So Figley did that and
continued to play well the rest of the day,
finishing in first place.
Today, Figley and her teammates continued
the strong play, shooting a 294, good enough
to tie them for first with a 895 overall
showing. But then Figley was approached by
an official who asked her to explain her pre
vious day's actions, for the coach of another
squad had heard of the ball-"moving" and
had reported it as a playing infraction.
So instead of Cardinal victory and an indi
vidual second-place, Figley was disqualified
and Stanford had to settle for second.
"We're all pretty upset about it all," Steph
anie Davis said. "The timing of it is especially
annoying."
The Cardinal, you see, wasn't notified of
the infraction and its subsequent "new" plac
ing until after the victory celebration had
begun.
"You can't believe how disappointed the kids
are," Coach Tim Baldwin said. "We're all really
disappointed for Jody because she played so
well. We still feel that we played great as a
team.

"We usually go by what the playing partners
decide, but that didn't seem to matter to this
official."
In additon to its finish today, the incident
and the tournamet outcome will most likely
affect the Cardinal's NCAA seding. According
to Baldwin, there is a good chance Stanford
will now be seeded ninth instead of the sixth
or seventh ranking the squad might have re
ceived if it had won yesterday.
Nevertheless, the experience might help the
Cardinal in the long run. "We'll be a iittie
bit more motivated now in the NCAAs," Davis
said. "We're pretty fired up right now."
"They're going to have a real mission now
at nationals," Baldwin added.
Not everything in San Diego was bleak for
the squad, however. Despite a tough last round
of 76, sophomore Audrey Wooding finished
with a combined score of 223 — good for
third place individually. San Jose State's Pat
Hurst, the defending NCAA individual cham
pion, shot a 71 on the final round to win the
tournament title by one stroke over San Diego
State's Joann Walker.
Cardinal sophomore Davis, who just last
week was named to the Pacific 10 All-
Conference second team, came on.strong in
the closing round to finish in a tie for sixth
place with a score of 225.
Another powerful finisher was senior Steph
anie Parel. After a dismal opening day, Parel
rebounded and had the team-low score of the
day with a 71 on the final round. In fact, the
entire team, including Martha Richards, who
played as an unattached individual, had final
rounds of 77 or under Such consistency and
balance will undoubtedly be a key to the team's
future success.
