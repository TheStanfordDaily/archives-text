# GALA keynote speaker:
## Gay rights progress has been made 
### Allison Shue 
Despite continuing bigotry, the
gay rights movement has made
significant progress in the past
20 years by securing new rights
and protection, according to Tom
Stoddard, executive director of the
Lambda Legal Defense and Edu
cation Fund.
Stoddard, the keynote speaker
for Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week, addressed an audience of
about 80 last night in Kresge Au
ditorium.
A professor of law at New York
University, Stoddard attributed
some of the progress to the new
visibility of the gay rights move
ment, which "creates the possibil
ity of justice."
He contrasted current condi
tions to past discrimination in the
United States. According to Stod
dard, from 1950 to 1955, thou
sands of alleged homosexual

federal employees were purged
from their jobs for being security
risks. In 1962, he added, the
penalty for acts of sodomy in
North Carolina was a jail term of
five to 60 years, compared with
a sentence of 30 years for second
degree murder.
However, 25 states since 1960
have repealed their sodomy laws,
he said, calling such laws "cor
nerstones of oppression" because
they tell "the popular mind" that
homosexuals are criminals.
Laws protecting government

employees from losing their jobs
on the basis of their sexual ori
entation have also recently been
established, Stoddard said. He
added, however, that the military,
intelligence and immigration serv
ices are still exempt from this leg
islation.
Stoddard also predicted that
Congress will eventually repeal
laws forbidding homosexuals who
are non-citizens from entering the
country.
However, accomplishments for
the gay community have not come
without setbacks, he said.
A serious problem is the in
creasing violence against gays and
lesbians, a possible result of their
recent growing visibilty in the
public eye, said Stoddard. AIDS,
he stated, although binding the
gay community together in sup
port, has also provided excuses
for bigotry.
