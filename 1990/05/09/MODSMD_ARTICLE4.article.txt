# Stanford to limit water use
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Stanford must reduce its an
nual one billion gallon water
usage by 25 percent of its 1987
pre-drought usage, the San Fran
cisco Public Utilities Commission
announced yesterday.
In the midst of a three-year
Northern California drought, the
University will urge its residents
and employees to conserve water.
In the meantime, the Grounds De
partment is planning to shut off
Stanford's fountains and reduce
plant-watering levels "effective
immediately," said Larry Atwater,
a supervisor at Operations and
Maintainance.
The grounds and custodial staff
will meet this morning to decide
its schedule for reducing water
usage. According to Atwater, plant
watering will be reduced gradual
ly, but the fountains may be shut
off today.
"This is a problem for everyone
living in the Bay Area," said
Cheryl Jensen, Operations and
Maintainance manager for Stan
ford's water resources.
According to John Mulane of
the San Francisco Water Depart
ment, the runoff of water from
seasonal rains has been extremely
low for the past four seasons.
At Stanford, drought conditions
in 1988 resulted in a 25 percent
reduction of water usage from
1987 levels, including a shut-off
of Stanford's fountains and reduc
tion in plant watering for the
duration of the 1988-89 academic
year, according to Jensen.
In addition, Lake Lagunita has
remained empty since 1988, when
it was only partially filled. The
last time the University com
pletely filled the lake was in 1987.
Stanford's fountains are now
flowing because water authorities
last summer reduced the level of
rationing to a 15 percent recom
mended reduction. A combination
of heavy torrential rains in March
1989 and an unusually warm
spring resulted in a heavy runoff
and a temporarily large supply of
water, Jensen said.
The public utility commission
uses 1987 as a reference year be
cause that was the most recent
year in which there were no
drought conditions.
Although Stanford lies two
counties south of San Francisco

in Santa Clara County, the Uni
versity and 29 other communities
on the Peninsula receive most of
their drinking water from the
Hetch Hetchy reservoir in
Yosemite National Park. The res
ervoir is operated by the city of
San Francisco. According to Jen
sen, Stanford uses about 1 percent
of Hetch Hetchy's water supply.
To reduce the water consump
tion at Stanford, "we have a lim
ited ability to take positive
measures outside of the areas in
O&M's jurisdiction. ... Everyone
here has been so good about con
serving water," said Jensen.
"If voluntary rationing doesn't
work, we will re-evaluate the sit
uation, but we don't feel like we
need to go into the dorms and
turn off people's showers. We're
not Big Brother," she added.
Like elsewhere, much of Stan
ford's water usage reduction will
take place in the areas of irriga
tion and plant watering, Jensen
said. About half of the current
reductions will occur in this man
ner, with the other half coming
from reduced personal consump
tion.
Jensen said the fountains do not
account "for much of a water use"
because the water is recycled, but
she added that in terms of public
relations, "it just doesn't look
good to be operating fountains un
der drought conditions."
