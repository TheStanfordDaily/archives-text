# Parking rates driven up for next year
## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
The Stanford community will face
higher parking rates next fall, as the
Committee on Parking and Transpor
tation has approved parking sticker
price increases for 1990-1991.
The new rates are $200 for an "A"
sticker, up from $170, and $50 for "C"
and student resident stickers, up from
$40.
The committee also approved a free
"D" sticker which will be valid only in
new "peripheral" parking lots outside
the Campus Drive loop.
According to committee chair Pete
Sidebottom, the rate increases arc in

tended for "cost recovery" and not as
disincentives for parking demands. The
money will go to pay for existing parking
structures and the debt incurred for
the construction of new structures, he
said.
Sidebottom said changes in the price
of parking permits are nothing new to
the community. "The changes were sys
tematically approved by the committee.
They are in no way dissimilar from the
past," he said.
On April 4, the committee released a
report calling for a departure from the
current University policy of supplying
affordable parking within reasonable
distances for faculty, students and staff.
Although the report did not mention

specific parking rates, it stated Stanford
should strive for a 10 percent reduction
in parking demand by promoting car
pooling, mass transit and increased
shuttle service.
Sidebottom said the community was
given enough time for comment on the
proposal. Four publicized hearings were
held during the quarter, but a total of
only 14 people spoke at them.
Senior Jeffrey Tumlin, a student
member of the committee, said no one
has ever brought up the issue of parking
fees in the public hearings.
The fifth and last hearing will be
held tomorrow at noon in Terman
