# Parking rates driven up for next year
## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
The Stanford community will face
higher parking rates next fall, as the
Committee on Parking and Transpor
tation has approved parking sticker
price increases for 1990-1991.
The new rates are $200 for an "A"
sticker, up from $170, and $50 for "C"
and student resident stickers, up from
$40.
The committee also approved a free
"D" sticker which will be valid only in
new "peripheral" parking lots outside
the Campus Drive loop.
According to committee chair Pete
Sidebottom, the rate increases arc in

tended for "cost recovery" and not as
disincentives for parking demands. The
money will go to pay for existing parking
structures and the debt incurred for
the construction of new structures, he
said.
Sidebottom said changes in the price
of parking permits are nothing new to
the community. "The changes were sys
tematically approved by the committee.
They are in no way dissimilar from the
past," he said.
On April 4, the committee released a
report calling for a departure from the
current University policy of supplying
affordable parking within reasonable
distances for faculty, students and staff.
Although the report did not mention

specific parking rates, it stated Stanford
should strive for a 10 percent reduction
in parking demand by promoting car
pooling, mass transit and increased
shuttle service.
Sidebottom said the community was
given enough time for comment on the
proposal. Four publicized hearings were
held during the quarter, but a total of
only 14 people spoke at them.
Senior Jeffrey Tumlin, a student
member of the committee, said no one
has ever brought up the issue of parking
fees in the public hearings.
The fifth and last hearing will be
held tomorrow at noon in Terman
Auditorium to give the public a
final chance to comment on the
proposal.
Sidebottom said peripheral
parking, which entails construct
ing parking lots in non-central lo
cations, is only an experimental
project to gauge student opinion.
Next year polls will be conducted
to see if students want to maintain
the priority of parking near dorms
— at the higher cost.
Julia Fremon, director of
Transportation Programs, said
the committee has recommended
that her office develop plans for
peripheral parking lots and in

creased shuttle services.
One plan is to offer a limited
number of peripheral parking per
mits for residents and commuters
on a first-come, first-served basis.
Fremon said there are no definite
plans yet, but possible locations
for the lots include one at the
Serra Complex and one on the
west campus at Stock Farm Road.
While turnout at the hearings
has been low, the committee has
received dozens of letters from
students, faculty and staff. Al
though some said they were glad
the committee was tackling the
issue, most were critical.
One person called the commit
tee's report "naive and idealistic
.. . another ridiculous suggestion
of the Stanford elite upper admin
istration indicating the total lack

of understanding of the lives of
the average workers here on this
campus."
According to Fremon, from fall
quarter on, stickers may possibly
be distributed through Transpor
tation Programs rather than
Police Services to "consolidate all
services in one place."
Tumlin said not enough stu
dents are on the committee to
make their voices heard. He and
freshman Kevin Lewis are the
only two students serving on the
committee, and Lewis did not join
until the middle of the school year.
"There are supposed to be three
students on the committee. It was
a very poor job on the part of the
ASSU. These very powerful posi
tions were not advertised at all,"
Tumlin said.
