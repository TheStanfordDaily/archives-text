# 3rd graders from Oakland get a taste of Stanford life

What could possibly be the attraction
of Stern Hall food service?
Yesterday, some students from Mary
O'Brien's third-grade class at E. Morris
Cox Elementary School in Oakland
ditched their box lunches to revel in
campus culinary delights at Burbank.
The young connoisseurs were part of
a group of 120 students who spent an
eye-opening day at college.
The students were brought here by
James Steyer, a lecturer in the School
of Education, who also teaches weekly
at the elementary school. Steyer said
that bringing underprivileged children
to Stanford will "plant the seed early
that college is an option."
The only requirement of the day was
an assembly in Kresge Auditorium.
There, before teachers, classmates and
Stanford students, Cox students ner
vously expressed why they want to at
tend college.
This is the fourth year that Steyer

has brought Cox students to the Uni
versity. In previous years, students were
brought on campus to walk around,
without having to participate in the pre
sentation. But now, Cox Prinicpal John
Cooke said, the visit is "tied into career
planning."
Cooke described the day at Stanford
as "one of the highlights of our
school. ... It starts kids to thinking and
goal setting at an early age."
After returning to the elementary
school, Cooke said, students who visited
Stanford "will share the experience with
the entire school in an assembly." Cooke
said he hopes the students who visited
the University will "excite other kids"
about college.
Steyer has devoted his career to youth
and education. As a children's advocate,
he founded "Children Now," a lobbying
and public information service for youth.
Described by Steyer as "the Sierra Club
for children," the statewide organization
has offices in Los Angeles, Oakland and

Sacramento.
"My ultimate dream is to get a
student of mine from Cox to be
a student at Stanford," Steyer
said. Teaching in Oakland once a
week, he said, serves as "a reality
check" that keeps him focused.
With students from Steyer's
Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
class serving as guides, the Cox

students meandered from attrac
tion to attraction. Fountain hop
ping, peering out from Hoover
Tower, playing computer games
at the computer clusters and en
joying food service were some of
the highlights of the day.
To cap off a fun-filled day, the
elementary students had the
added thrill of being on television.
On hand to cover the visit was a
local news crew.
O'Brien, the third-grade
teacher, found having Stanford
students lead the elementary stu

dents created a "much more
personal" approach than a group
tour would.
Tearful goodbyes from the
elementary students were proof
of her claim.
The saddened elementary stu
dents were calmed with address
exchanges and the assurance that
the Stanford students would visit
their school on May 31. At that
time a group of Stanford students
will lecture to the children and
accompany them to an Oakland
A's game.
