Today's laptop PC leader * brings you the
new SupersPort m SX—ttie first word in
price, performance and portability!
Zenith Data Systems would like to offer
you a more useful definition of portability—the
new Supers Port SX.
As the first laptop PC to feature the
number-crunching power of the Intel 386SX ™
microprocessor, Supers Port SX gives you
processing speeds up to 33% faster than most
286 portables.
And yet, its SX architecture makes the
Supers Port SX about as affordable as a 286
laptop. So you can run high-performance 386
software for advanced financial, scientific and
engineering applications without the 386 price.
It also offers Zenith's Page White screen
with high-contrast black-on-white images that
virtually duplicate printed-page clarity. It
even runs VGA color applications with 16
corresponding shades of gray.
And Supers Port SX features Zenith's
Intelligent Power Management System!" which
lets you control power usage... for up to three
and-a-half hours of battery life.
So if your definition of true portability
includes 386 performance within a 286 budget,
get the first word in SX laptops. Pick up Zenith's
innovative new Supers Port SX today!
