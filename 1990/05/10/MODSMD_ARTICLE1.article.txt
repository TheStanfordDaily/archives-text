# Stanford to help fund investigation of tainted groundwater
## 
### Aaron Thode Staff writer 
Six years after carcinogenic chemicals
were discovered in the groundwater un
derneath Stanford Research Park, the
University has agreed to help fund an
investigation of the toxic site.
A University official said, however, that
Stanford does not plan to pay for the
estimated $4 million cleanup, which the
state Department of Health Services has
predictea will be one of the most tech
nically difficult in all of California.
The trace levels of the contaminants
are currently creeping into Barron Park,

a community of about 1,200 homes.
"The University has agreed to partic
ipate in the [cleanup] investigation," said
Andy Doty, director of community rela
tions. "We don't know if [our proposal]
has been accepted by the companies."
Doty said he was "not at liberty to say"
how much the University had offered the
companies.
"Stanford is contributing a substantial
amount," said Peter Johnson, an engi
neering consultant to 10 Research Park
companies. "The companies whom I rep
resent consider the current offer by Stan
ford adequate [for the study]."
He expects an agreement between the

two parties within the next couple weeks.
If the companies and Stanford reach an
agreement, it will mark the first time
Stanford has contributed significant fi
nancial resources to the investigation
since the contamination was found by
the Watkins-Johnson Co. in 1984.
The contaminated area is called the
Hillview-Porter site. At present, more
than 15 toxins — among them freon,
bromomethane, xylene, toluene and
trichloroethylene — have been identified
in the groundwater beneath both the Re
search Park and adjoining Barron Park.
Many of the contaminants are semicon
ductor manufacturing chemicals that

have leaked out from underground
storage areas.
The contamination has been a major
source of conflict between Stanford and
the community. Barron Park residents
charge that Stanford, the landowner of
the Research Park, has not been cooperat
ing in the cleanup process even though
it was ordered to do so by the state.
Doty said Stanford has been involved
with Hillview-Porter before. In 1986, at
the request of the state Health Services
department, the University sampled
several private wells in the Barron Park
community, an effort that proved that
the contamination plume had spread out

side the Research Park.
In December 1988, Health Services or
dered 13 companies and the University
to investigate and prepare a plan of action
for a cleanup of the site. Last July, 10
Research Park companies banded to
gether to set a timetable for the cleanup
which was quicker than the one man
dated by the state.
Following the recommendations of this
consortium, Health Services ordered six
other companies to participate in the in
vestigation last week.
Nevertheless, Stanford remained con-
