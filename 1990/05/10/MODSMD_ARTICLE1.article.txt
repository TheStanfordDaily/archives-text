# Stanford to help fund investigation of tainted groundwater
## 
### Aaron Thode Staff writer 
Six years after carcinogenic chemicals
were discovered in the groundwater un
derneath Stanford Research Park, the
University has agreed to help fund an
investigation of the toxic site.
A University official said, however, that
Stanford does not plan to pay for the
estimated $4 million cleanup, which the
state Department of Health Services has
predictea will be one of the most tech
nically difficult in all of California.
The trace levels of the contaminants
are currently creeping into Barron Park,

a community of about 1,200 homes.
"The University has agreed to partic
ipate in the [cleanup] investigation," said
Andy Doty, director of community rela
tions. "We don't know if [our proposal]
has been accepted by the companies."
Doty said he was "not at liberty to say"
how much the University had offered the
companies.
"Stanford is contributing a substantial
amount," said Peter Johnson, an engi
neering consultant to 10 Research Park
companies. "The companies whom I rep
resent consider the current offer by Stan
ford adequate [for the study]."
He expects an agreement between the

two parties within the next couple weeks.
If the companies and Stanford reach an
agreement, it will mark the first time
Stanford has contributed significant fi
nancial resources to the investigation
since the contamination was found by
the Watkins-Johnson Co. in 1984.
The contaminated area is called the
Hillview-Porter site. At present, more
than 15 toxins — among them freon,
bromomethane, xylene, toluene and
trichloroethylene — have been identified
in the groundwater beneath both the Re
search Park and adjoining Barron Park.
Many of the contaminants are semicon
ductor manufacturing chemicals that

have leaked out from underground
storage areas.
The contamination has been a major
source of conflict between Stanford and
the community. Barron Park residents
charge that Stanford, the landowner of
the Research Park, has not been cooperat
ing in the cleanup process even though
it was ordered to do so by the state.
Doty said Stanford has been involved
with Hillview-Porter before. In 1986, at
the request of the state Health Services
department, the University sampled
several private wells in the Barron Park
community, an effort that proved that
the contamination plume had spread out

side the Research Park.
In December 1988, Health Services or
dered 13 companies and the University
to investigate and prepare a plan of action
for a cleanup of the site. Last July, 10
Research Park companies banded to
gether to set a timetable for the cleanup
which was quicker than the one man
dated by the state.
Following the recommendations of this
consortium, Health Services ordered six
other companies to participate in the in
vestigation last week.
Nevertheless, Stanford remained con-
spicuously absent from the roster
of those funding the cleanup sur
vey. But the University stepped
in last week when it sent its fi
nancial proposal to the Research
Park consortium. Once accepted,
the University's funding will sup

port research activities over the
next 17 months.
During that time hydro
geologists and other engineers will
measure the depth and area of
the contaminated area, the rate
of flow of water in the aquifer,
and the geologic structure of the
Park area. The Hillview-Porter
site is especially complex because
it has been fed by nine sources
and is flowing through a confus
ing hodgepodge of clay, gravel and

sand.
Once a reasonable model of the
toxic flow has been constructed,
which may be as early as 1991,
the companies will be able to
select the best cleanup strategy
for the site.
Johnson said that study will
focus on Matadero Creek and Bar
ron Park, where concentrations
of trichloroethylene have been
found in levels exceeding state
safety limits. This July, 25 test

wells will be drilled to a depth of
125 feet to determine whether
deeper aquifers have been con
taminated. In addition, private
water wells in the area will be
sampled quarterly.
The planned drilling is a source
of great concern to the residents
of Barron Park, as these under
ground reservoirs serve as a
backup water supply for the Palo
Alto area.
Although it will help pay for

such projects, Stanford still
refuses to help fund the eventual
cleanup. "The University consid
ers itself an innocent bystander,
for we did not spill a drop into
the soil," Doty said. "When we
leased the land to the companies,
it was pristine."
John Joynt, president of the
Barron Park Association, said he
disagrees with the University's at
titude. "I would like to see closure
on this," he said. "The Depart

ment of Health Services and the
companies and the community
have been looking for Stanford to
get involved for a long time."
He said he thinks Stanford
should be financially involved in
"both the remedial and action
stage."
Johnson said he cannot predict
how long the cleanup will take,
because the full extent and struc
ture of the contamination is not
known.
