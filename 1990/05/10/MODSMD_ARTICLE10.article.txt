# Hoover Fellow:
## Japan's economy manipulated by U.S.

Japan needs to be relieved from
an unequal economic relationship
with the United States, Hoover
Senior Research Fellow Tutsuya
Kataoka said yesterday in a talk
on Japanese-American relations.
In his "Tower Talks" speech,
Kataoka said the Japanese econ
omy is being manipulated by the
United States. "An open season
on Japan began in the start of
the first term of [former President
Ronald] Reagan," he said.
Kataoka said the United States
and Japan were linked by an
"Amerippon" relationship in
which U.S. military protection

was linked to non-defense serv
ices. He said former Secretary of
the Treasury Donald Regan pres
sured Japan into recycling trade
profits back into the United
States in the form of investments
such as treasury bills.
This relationship will result in
a continuing cycle of trade ten
sions and resolutions that will ul
timately explode, Kataoka said.
Thus, he said this unequal power
relationship should be changed.
He claimed that a U.S. military
presence in Japan is no longer
needed due to the reduced Soviet
threat. Katoaka said that the only
remaining justification for U.S.
military involvement — to keep
the Japanese from military ag

gression — is illegitimate.
He proposed that the United
States sell Japan several nuclear
submarines to resolve the burden
sharing situation. The sub
marines would need joint turnkey
authorization by American and
Japanese officers in order to fire
missiles, and targeting of missiles
would also be jointly determined,
Kataoko suggested.
Even if Japanese-American re
lations worsen, Kataoka said it is
highly unlikely that the Japanese
would turn to extensive trade with
the Soviet Union. The Japanese
are wary of the Soviets, he said.
Kataoka predicted that "in 15
to 20 years, the Soviet Union will
press on Japan and China."
