Pope assails the wealthy
DURANGO, Mexico (AP) — Pope John Paul
II told an audience of Mexico's top businessmen
the rich are increasing poverty and suffering
by taking more than their share of the nation's
wealth.
The pontiff said the poor had suffered the
worst consequences of Mexico's economic crisis
and said Mexico was "still very far from the
ideal of justice."
He called on business leaders in this over
whelmingly Roman Catholic country to create
more jobs, pay just salaries and protect the
environment.
1 he pope also said the decline of communism
in Eastern Europe should not be seen as a
victory for Western consumerism.
"The events of recent history ... have been
interpreted, sometimes in a superficial way ...
as the triumph of the liberal capitalist system,"
the pope said in a speech in Durango, a provin
cial capital 450 miles northwest of Mexico City.
Cyclone wreaks havoc
MADRAS, India (AP) — A cyclone battered
the southern India coast yesterday with wind
up to 155 mph, killing at least 11 people and
cutting off thousands of others from the rest
of the country.
The center of the storm struck the Indian
mainland from the Bay of Bengal at 6:30 p.m.,
160 miles north of the city of Madras, United
News of India reported.
Strong wind and towering 33-foot waves
lashed the low-lying, heavily populated
coastline of Andhra Pradesh state, knocking
down hundreds of thatched huts, uprooting
trees and downing power lines.
Naval boats were battling rough seas in an
effort to reach more than 6,000 people in the
coastal town of Yedurumudi who were cut off
by the storm from the rest of the country,
rescue officials said.
Rescue workers evacuated more than
150,000 people during the day from coastal
districts in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
states before the storm struck, which kept the
death toll down, said Arjuna Rao, a top relief
official in Andhra Pradesh's capital,
Hyderabad.
Shamir sets conditions
JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said yesterday that Israel
would not release any Arab prisoners in return
for Western hostages unless Israeli soldiers
held in Lebanon were also freed.
Speaking for the first time about a possible
prisoner-hostage swap, Shamir said no prog
ress had been made in efforts to secure the
release of three Israeli soldiers captured in
Lebanon in 1986.
Asked about U.S. hints that Israel might
free its Shiite prisoners to facilitate the release
of Western hostages, Shamir said: "I don't
think that anybody will ask Israel to partici
pate in such an endeavor without having a
possibility to release our own prisoners and
missing soldiers."
The three missing Israeli soldiers are
believed held by Hezbollah, or the Party of
God, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group.
Rights abuse continues
LONDON (AP) — Six months after the gov
ernment proposed new human rights
safeguards, widespread torture and other
abuses continue unabated in Turkey, according
to a report released yesterday by Amnesty
International.
"In early 1990, thousands of people re
mained imprisoned for political reasons, in
cluding hundreds of prisoners of conscience
convicted for their non-violent political or re
ligious activities," the international human
rights organization said.
"Among them are members of political or
ganizations, trade unions and Kurdish groups
as well as journalists and religious activists.
The use of torture continues to be widespread
and systematic, in some cases resulting in
death."
Albania to ease restrictions
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Albania, Europe's
last hard-line Communist country, has an
nounced it wants to join the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, in a break
from its decades-long policy of isolationism.
The Tirana government also said it would
allow freer travel for its citizens, a key con
dition for joining the East-West conference.
The proposed reforms were announced yes
terday at a session of the Albanian Parliament
and are in line with new policies outlined
earlier this year by Communist Party chief
Ramiz Alia.
