RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) — Soviet
loyalists yesterday used military
parades commemorating the defeat of
Nazi Germany to denounce seces
sionist movements in the Baltics and
to stage a show of strength.
In Riga, the capital of Latvia, the
Victory Day parade ended with a rally
by about 5,000 people protesting the
Latvian parliament's declaration of in
dependence on Friday.
In Lithuania, which declared its in
dependence from the Soviet Union on
March 11, armored personnel carriers
and rocket launchers paraded through
the streets of Vilnius, the republic's
capital.
The local radio said it was the first
military parade ever held on Victory
Day in the city.
In the third independence-seeking
Baltic republic, Estonia, a Victory Day
parade occurred without incident in
the capital city of Tallinn.
In the southern republic of Georgia,
about 20,000 people attended a pro
independence rally at a park in Tbilisi,
the capital, the KST-Iveria news serv
ice reported.
Speakers said the victims of World
War II included not only those killed
by Adolf Hitler's Nazis but also those
who died at the orders of Soviet dic
tator Josef Stalin, a native Georgian.
Supporters and opponents of the
secessionist movements offered
sharply different interpretations of the
historical meaning of the anniversary.
Soviet loyalists said the anniversary
marked the liberation from Nazi
tyranny. Independence activists said
the liberating troops were actually an
occupying army, who enforced repres
sive Stalinist policies.
Soviet television reported yesterday
that the Lithuanian parliament had
issued a statement saying the May
1945 victory over the Nazis "brought
neither peace nor victory to Lithuan
ia" because it was followed by many
more years of struggle against the
Stalinist regime.
The television report said the par
liament asked Lithuanians to stay
home or spend the holiday relaxing in
the country, and avoid disturbing the
military parade.
Paul Pauparas of the Lithuanian
government press office said he knew

nothing about any such parliamentary
statement. But his office earlier re
ported that the republic's president,
Vytautas Landsbergis, asked people to
ignore the military show of force in
Vilnius.
A Lithuanian radio report moni
tored by the BBC said few people
watched the parade. But Soviet tele
vision showed citizens lining the
parade route and throwing flowers at
Soviet soldiers in their armored
vehicles. The television report also said
"insulting cries" could be heard.
About 200 people tried to block the
parade to express their dissatisfaction,
but they were quickly forced to move
by armed paratroopers, said local jour

nalist and activist Eduardas Potas
hinskas.
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri
Yazov appeared yesterday on state-run
television in Moscow and complained
about the attitude of citizens in the
Baltic republics.
"We were greeted with flowers"
when the Red Army drove the Nazis
from the Baltics, said Yazov.
The three Baltic republics were an
nexed by the Soviet Union in 1940,
then overrun by German forces, and
in turn retaken by the Soviets.
In Riga, veterans and officers
marched toward the towering World
War II victory monument, and were
met on the way by about 5,000 mostly

Russian-speaking residents, members
of the republic's non-Latvian minority,
who formed a separate civilian anti
independence demonstration.
The Soviet officers leading the mil
itary parade, which included artillery
and armored vehicles, denounced the
moves toward secession.
"We consider the declaration of in
dependence a defeat for everyone," said
Lt. Gen. Oleg Zinchenko, head of the
political directorate of the Baltic Mil
itary Region.
Zinchenko, saying he spoke for tne
Red Army and the Soviet fleet, said
appeals from the military to the Krem
lin to intervene more forcefully in the
Baltics were not signs of weakness.
