# Riots flare in South Korea, new leader sought
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Tens
of thousands of students, dissidents
and radicals battled riot police in more
than a dozen cities yesterday to
demand the ouster of President Roh
Tae-woo. Police arrested more than
900 people.
In downtown Seoul, students hurled
rocks and firebombs in the most vio
lent anti-government protests in the
capital since 1987. Dozens of police
and protesters suffered injuries, some
serious, but no figures were available.
Protesters set fire to a U.S. diplo
matic building, firebombed a police
bus, truck and jeep, occupied the front
of one of the capital's luxury hotels
and took control of a fashionable down
town shopping area for more than
three hours.
Violence erupted as the newly
created Democratic Liberal Party held
its inaugural convention. Radicals and

dissidents claim the gigantic party, a
merger of three political groups, will
lead to dictatorship.
Roh's party is declining in popularity
as inflation rises and costs soar, but
many Koreans do not support radicals
who espouse violence.
"Yankee go home!" screamed thou
sands of students hurling firebombs
and rocks. "Down with Roh Tae-woo!"
At the height of the fighting, some
15,000 students rampaged through an
area two or three miles wide from the
Seoul railway station to Dondaemun
market, the country's largest
wholesale market.
Protesters ripped up sidewalks and
metal grating to make missiles. Street
signs were taken apart to use as weap
ons against police armed with tear-gas
masks, truncheons and shields.
Clouds of choking tear gas billowed
over the center of this capital city of

10 million people, sending office
workers and shopkeepers racing for
cover at the evening rush hour, holding
their mouth and nose to keep out the
acrid gas.
Thousands of riot police in the city
center appeared to be taken by surprise
as throngs of 300 to 2,000 radical stu
dents dashed along sidewalks to occupy
main downtown shopping streets.
Screaming protesters overpowered
at least two groups of 200 to 300 riot
police and seized their helmets, clubs,
shields and other items. Students
forced dozens of police to kneel with
their hands behind their backs and
shouted insults, kicking and beating
them with fists and clubs.
"Disband the DLP!" students yelled
repeatedly.
After nightfall, about 3,000 students
occupied a block around the U.S. In
formation Service center for two hours

before being driven back by volleys of
tear gas fired from black armored
police vans.
Students broke at least seven win
dows at the four-story center and
threw firebombs into a first-floor win
dow, touching off a fire that raged out
of control for more than an hour with
flames reaching up to the second story.
Firemen and U.S. Army fire trucks
from the nearby American base extin
guished the blaze after police regained
control of the street.
Ihe front gate of the center was
shuttered, and it was unknown
whether there were people inside the
building, which includes a library and
agriculture and trade offices.
An embassy spokesman said no U.S.
personnel were known to be in the
building during the fighting, and no
damage estimate was available.
