Major cuts proposed
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President
Bush and congressional leaders an
nounced plans yesterday for emer
gency budget talks to cut up to $100
billion from a rapidly worsening
federal deficit. Tax increases as well
as spending cuts will be on the
negotiating table.
"Severe action" is needed to avoid
the huge automatic cuts that would
be triggered throughout federal pro
grams if deficit-reduction targets are
not met next fall, said presidential

spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
" The leadership in the House and
the Senate ... has accepted the pres
ident's invitation" to a budget sum
mit with no preconditions, declared
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-
Wash.
Negotiators for the House, Senate
and White House will meet for the
first time next Tuesday at the White
House, said Fitzwater.
Bush will chair the first session.
After that, he "will be involved as
necessary," Fitzwater said.
The spokesman blamed increasing
interest rates, lower revenues to the

Treasury from a sluggish economy
and a higher-than-expected cost of
the savings and loan bailout for the
widening deficit gap.
Shuttle launch delayed
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -
A puzzling breakdown in Columbia's
cooling system has forced NASA to
delay next week's scheduled shuttle
launch by an estimated two to three
weeks, the space agency said yester
day.
Columbia had been scheduled to
lift off May 16 or May 17 with seven

astronauts and the $100 million
Astro observatory, capable of probing
ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. But
engineers this week spotted a prob
lem with a valve that controls the
flow of coolant in the shuttle.
Restrictions planned
WASHINGTON (AP) - The En
vironmental Protection Agency said
yesterday it is drawing up a guide
to workplace smoking restrictions
and an assessment of the cancer risk
to non-smokers exposed to cigarette
smoke.
