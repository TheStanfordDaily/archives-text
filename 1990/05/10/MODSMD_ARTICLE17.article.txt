## Good medicine 
### 
THE NEWLY inaugurated
Program for Women in Med
icine is just what the doctor
ordered.
Female students have few role
models in any academic discipline,
but in medicine, matters can be
more complicated.
Medicine has long been a male
dominated profession. There has
been progress in this area, but it's
been slow: at present, about 30
percent of Stanford's medical stu
dents and staff are women, and
only two departments are headed
by women. And although women
have made big gains in such fields
as pediatrics and gynecology, they
have a long way to go in many
other areas.
With high expectations at both
home and work, women face addi
tional pressure.
These problems need a number

of long-term solutions, and the
group's plans show that its mem
bers will be working hard to find
these solutions.
Although members will be
mainly medical students, graduate
students, faculty and alumnae,
workshops to introduce high school
students and undergraduates to
women role models in medicine will
be among the program's regular
features.
The group will sponsor events
including a regular Medical Wom
en's Forum, a lecture series and a
quarterly newsletter. In addition,
it will evaluate residency programs
and maintain a directory of local
childcare options.
With these programs and more,
the group will hopefully be a key
to diversifying the future medical
profession, both in practice and in
academia.
