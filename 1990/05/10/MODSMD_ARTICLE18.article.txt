# Chance to change

IF THE ASSU Senate wants to
prove that they really are here
for the students, they had bet
ter pass the three bills which are
currently on the table.
Graduate Senator Doug Bone re
cently authored three bills aimed
at increasing the openness of the
ASSU. The bills were submitted
for prior notice last Tuesday and
will be considered at the next sen
ate meeting.
The first bill allows students
complete access to association
records; currently, a group's finan
cial file can only be looked at after
gaining the authorization of the
ASSU financial manager and the
specific group's financial manager.
Certainly, the students who fund
various organizations through spe
cial and general fees should be al
lowed free access to see that these

funds are being used appropriately.
The second and third bills would
eliminate the ability of the senate
and its committees to close meet
ings to the general public with a
two-thirds vote. Unless the Bylaws
specifically close a meeting on a
certain topic — personnel issues
for example — all meetings would
be forced to remain open.
Admittedly, there are some con
fidentiality issues that need to be
discussed when this bill is pre
sented. For example, it would be
inappropriate to reveal the tele
phone usage records of publica
tions that need to maintain
confidentiality of their sources.
The ASSU remains a closed-off
organization to many of its con
stituents. On May 20, the senate
will have an opportunity to change
that.
