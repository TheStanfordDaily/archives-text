# '87 graduate subject of slanderous tirade Yuh shocked by columnist's remarks
## 
### Jennifer Paley 
Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh, a Stanford
graduate and general-assignment
reporter for New York Newsday,
was the subject of Newsday col
umnist Jimmy Breslin's recent
racist and sexist tirade that has
gained national attention.
In an interview yesterday, Yuh,
a former Stanford Daily staffer,
expressed her shock over Breslin's
remarks. "I've been exposed to
racist and sexist comments before,
but [they are] usually from people
on the street â€” people unimpor
tant, not from Pulitzer Prize
winning journalists."
Breslin's outburst was triggered
by an internal computer message
Yuh sent to Breslin criticizing his
column headlined "Officially, the
Spouse is out of the House." Yuh
said its sexist remarks concerning
"official women" workers were of
fensive and inappropriate.
Upon receiving Yuh's message,
Breslin referred to her as "a yel
low cur" and "slant-eyed" in the
newsroom last Friday. Yuh was

not in the newsroom at the time,
but when she heard about her
colleague's attack she was
"shocked."
A 1987 Stanford graduate in
cognitive science, Yuh said she ex
perienced both racism and sexism
as an undergraduate. Yuh high
lighted one example from her
freshman year: "I was in the
cafeteria, and some guy said, 'The
only reason you're here is to fill
the Asian quota.' "
Breslin's actions have sent
ripples through the Asian-
American community across the
country.
Three Asian-American organi
zations asked Newsday's manage
ment to fire Breslin because of
his "racist and sexist attitudes."
The Korean American Journalists
Association is mustering its forces
against Breslin because of his
denial of "the same First Amend
ment rights to a fellow journalist."
They demanded "the immediate
ouster" of Breslin.
