## Painting a mural of labels 
### 
AND OVER THERE by the porce
lain collection we have an exqui
site mural done by the princess
w
After a whirlwind tour of the Hall of
Mirrors, I was still in the process of
absorbing the splendor of Versailles
when the tour guide pointed out a
mural which spanned an entire wall of
a princess' bedroom. Exotic thumb
shaped mountains towered over a
verdant countryside in which 100
intricately-painted figures were frolick
ing about, waving fans, pulling silk
streamers and embroidering dragons.
"It's supposed to be a countryside in
China," the tour guide explained. "But
all the figures look Caucasian since the
princess had never seen an Asian
before."
The West has always been captivated
by the "mystique" of the East. Painted
on the canvas of the Western mind,
Asian stands a mural teeming with
spices, silks and mysterious. It is
painting that is encased in its own
mystical mist . . . and sometimes delu
sion.
It is this delusion that Stanford
Alum David Henry Hwang captures in
his Tony Award-winning play, "M.
Butterfly." Hwang, who will speak in
Roble Hall at 7 p.m. Monday, tells the
story of a French diplomat in Beijing
who falls madly in love with a Chinese
opera star. After a 20-year affair,
during which she even presents him
with a child, the diplomat is arrested
and learns that his lover is not only a

spy; she's a man (it's based on a true
story â€” no joke). Captive to his sexist
and racist fantasies, the Western
diplomat chooses delusion over reality.
Within this mist comes a wealth of
paradoxical labels that have plagued
Asians throughout history. Painted into
stereotypes, Asians appear as a dichot
omy on the canvas of Western percep
tion: Are Asians weak and subservient?
(In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book
"Fire in the Lake," Frances Fitzgerald
argues that Americans didn't think
they could lose the Vietnam War be
cause they thought they were fighting
an "inferior race.") Or, are Asians
dangerous and crafty (causing the
American government to call for the
internment of Japanese Americans
during World War II)?
Is the Asian woman submissive and
obedient or the cold, calculating
Dragon Lady? Are Asian workers
industrious assets to the community
(i.e. the Chinese workers who built the
Pacific Railroads and packed Leland
Stanford's purse) or a "yellow peril"
which threatens the community (i.e.
the Chinese workers Leland Stanford
rewarded with an immigration exclu
sion act)? The colors chosen for the
painting seem to be those most con
venient for the artist.
Today's Asian-American mural is
markedly different from the princess'
vision of a Chinese countryside. Exotic
mountains have been replaced by
libraries. Calculators and books sup
plant silk streamers. And frolicking

embroiderers give way to affluent
"weak geek" engineers. Once again,
paradoxical overtones of fear and
disdain surface: Asians are both the
"model minority" and "incompetent
nerds."
"They're seen as weaker, less capable
of handling people. You know, real
men aren't engineers or geeks with
glasses playing the violin," says Arthur
Hu, an MIT graduate who studies
Asian American demographics, explain
ing why Asian Americans are often
overlooked during promotion time.
Asians make up 7.5 percent of the
nation's professionals but only 1.5
percent of managers and officials.
With the image of Asians as affluent
super-students, society turns its head
away from underprivileged Asians who
haven't "made it,"and directs anger
toward those who have. Make no
mistake that jokes like "MIT stands
for Made in Taiwan" are uttered with
a hint of resentment. It's no coinci
dence that Asian success in America,
real and perceived, is coupled with an
uprise in violence toward Asian Ameri
cans.
