## Efforts to preserve environment have been substantial

THE MAY 8 editorial, "Cleaning
Up," observes that "the Universi
ty's environmental health is . . .
pot too encouraging," citing as an
example that the University was recy
cling "only" 16 percent of Stanford's
chemical waste.
Sixteen-percent recycling is a lot (not
to mention the additonal 15 percent of
chemical waste that is neutralized and
rendered nonhazardous)! There are
over 1,500 research laboratories at
Stanford, not counting the photo labs,
print shops, maintenance shops, clean
ing operations, etc., that use chemicals.
Overall there are at least 5,000
different chemicals in use at Stanford.
In the experimental uses in the labs
these chemicals are mixed, heated,

Environmental Health and Safety is proud of
Stanford's chemical hazardous waste disposal
and recycling efforts.

"retourted," "reacted," etc. and ulti
mately end up as a great amount of
individually small quantities of mixed
waste.
The fact that most of the hazardous
waste is mixed, not pure, poses serious
practical obstacles to large scale recy
cling. We have emphasized the use of
source reduction and, here at the
Environmental Safety Facility, tech-

niques such as acid neutralization and
solvent distillation to reduce the
volume of hazardous waste that has to
be hauled away for disposal.
Right now we're experimenting with
the distillation and recycling of Xylene
and Ethanol, two commonly used
organic solvents. Recently we were able
to reclaim Xylene to the level of purity
required for research purposes and are

now selling it back to Stanford Hospi
tal for reuse.
I think the Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford environmen
tal audit (containing the data on which
the editorial was based) is a terrific
student initiative and a lot of people at
Environmental Health and Safety
helped in supplying information to the
students working on the audit.
We are, I think justifiably, proud of
Stanford's chemical hazardous waste
disposal and recycling efforts and,
though we need to do more, find our
progress to date encouraging, not
discouraging.
