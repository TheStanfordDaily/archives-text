# Concerns about gays must be discussed openly with others
## 
### 
As part of GALA Week, The Daily
ran a feature on gay dating on campus
in Monday's paper. I was interviewed
and named in the article. When I got
home that day, there were two obscene
messages on my answering machine.
The first offered a rather weak
rendition of the B-52's "Love Shack"
and concluded with "Fuck off fag!"
The second was from Felix and asked
what it was like to "have a dick up
your ass." Because I don't know Felix,
the only way I have to respond to him
is through a letter to The Daily.
Well, Felix, I've only engaged in pas
sive anal sex once, many years ago.
Actually it felt quite pleasant. You see,
it was with a guy I cared for and the
experience was pretty intense emotion
ally. The sex, a dick up my ass if you
insist, was only secondary to the

sharing of the moment with my part
ner.
Even if we weren't in love, it was
clear that we really felt for each other
and that bonding was something he
and I very much appreciated, which as
I understand is not very much differ
ent from what a heterosexual experi
ence might be. Sure the organs are
different, you've got two Tab A's and a
diferent Slot B, but from what I've
known of sexuality with a woman I
suppose the emotional intensity is very
much the same.
I like to think that sex is just more
than the rubbing together of two
bodies; to me making love is emotion
al, psychological and contextual. In this
regard, how does it matter what the
actual body parts involved are?
If people would just realize this,
Felix, perhaps they wouldn't be so
upset by the idea of two men or two
women making love anymore than I
suppose they are by a woman and a
man together.
Because this is only a response to
one question you asked, and I'd bet
you have more, I'd like to refer you to

the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center. Feel free to call and
schedule a Speakers' Bureau for your
dorm or frat, or to talk to one of the
community members present.
I have this hope that if you'd be
willing just to chat with one of us,
you'd see we're not all that horrible,
probably not all that much unlike most
of the people you already know and
respect. We certainly don't deserve
random messages on our answering
machines.
