# Providing funds for yell leaders unfair to athletes
## 
### 
Sure, the football coach supports the
cheerleaders — excuse me, the yell
leaders — but what does the field
hockey coach think? How about the
sailing team?

I'm not against emotional support
for the Card, but financial support
should come first for our varsity
teams.
And will the yell leaders even boost
emotional morale? Not unless sup
ported by the students, which, accord
ing to the poll results in The Daily on
May 8, they aren't — by almost a two
to one margin!
C'mon, let's get our priorities
straight! And remember, history
repeats itself. (Translation: If we don't
have cheerleaders, we won't be able to
boo them off the court a second time.)
