## Michael Stevenson Confiding in parents was difficult, yet rewarding 
### 
112 \EAR MOM AND DAD: It feels a
112 M little awkward writing to you. I
have something important to say,
though, and since I'm not very good at
expressing myself verbally, I figured
it'd be better putting my thoughts on
paper for you, as well as for me.
Big breath now. Mom, Dad, you
know I love you, and that I don't mean
to hurt you, but this news undoubtably
will. To put it bluntly — I'm gay. I am
attracted to men ... Why am I telling
you this ? Because you have a right to
know (did you already, in the back of
your minds?). I'm your son, and I
want to share more of my life with you
— more than "same old story, busy in
lab."
Recently I went to a P-FIJiG meet
ing. Parents and Friends of Lesbians
and Gays was a very supportive group.
About 15 mothers and a few fathers
were there, and they had all been or
still were going through the shock I'm
putting you through. I could see how
difficult it was for them to come to
grips with the fact that their son or
daughter was gay, but I felt no anger
from them. I praised and respected
each and every one of them for being
able to come to the meeting and share
their feelings with the group. There are
P-FLAG organizations all around the
country, and one back home for you if

you need their support.
There are a lot of questions I'm sure
you have for me, and I for you. I wish
I could prevent your feeling hurt, guilty
or angry, but believe me, nothing you
did in my upbringing made me this
way. I just am. We have to talk about
this, about me and how we can learn
to accept it — together.
I do love you both. Maybe I don't say
it enough, but it's always there.
That was last November. I spent the
two months before then worrying over
how to tell my parents and, more
importantly, how they'd react. Gay
topics had never been a big dinner
topic back home, so I could only hope
that they would be open enough to
eventually accept my homosexuality.
Telling my parents in order to ulti
mately have their support was worth
the possible risk of losing them. The
question was how. I could either write,
phone or do it in person.
P-FLAG helped me find the answer.
Seeing newcomer parents' anguish at
the several meetings I'd gone to made
me realize that I wanted to give my
folks time alone to come to grips with
my homosexuality, and to let any
ugliness they might feel surface in
their faces without having to worry
about my seeing it. And truthfully, I
don't think I was strong enough then

Telling my parents in order to ultimately have
their support was worth the possible risk of
losing them.

to look them in the eye and say I was
gay. Hence the letter. It went through
some umpteen revisions before I finally
mailed it, along with some books
dealing with family and homosexuality.
After that I walked on eggshells for
a week, waiting for my parents'
phonecall. It came — we talked,
laughed a little and cried a lot. They
reacted so much better than I could
have hoped. Understandably they were
confused (they hadn't had the slightest
idea about me — I was surprised), but
overall they just wanted me to be
happy with my life. I found out that
day that I had a really great set of
parents. Thanks, Mom and Dad.
I told my younger brother over
Christmas, and he shrugged it off as
no big deal. Cool, bro. My older
brother still has to be told, and I don't
know if I'll ever tell my grandparents.
Their religious beliefs might not let
them be so accepting, and I don't want
to shake up their remaining golden
years. But is it right to leave them in

the dark and have my mother keep
this secret from her parents? For now,
I think so. But time does have a way
of changing things and people's views.
My straight friends at Stanford have
been another concern. Most of them
were told before GALA Week and were
very supportive. As long as I was
happy, then that's all that mattered to
them ... besides, most of them had
already guessed! I apologize to anyone
else who had to learn of my homosexu
ality through these letters; I wish
there had been an easier way. Now,
any new friends I make are usually
told fairly soon.
I don't mean to make my being gay
an issue, but I don't want people
assuming I'm straight anymore, be
cause then they make assumptions
about my lifestyle that could later
become awkward in conversation. And
personally, I don't want to be put back
in the closet — ever.
A final plug for P-FLAG. It's a

wonderful support group for parents,
friends of gays and gay people, too.
I've never before been in such a close
and warm environment with a bunch
of strangers, feeling that it was OK to
cry if I wanted to, or share my
thoughts and feelings with them;
they'd listen. But it's the parents
themselves who make it special for me.
Knowing that the regulars there accept
and love their children completely — I
can feel some of that love rub off on
me. What a fix! Also, I guess I like
parental approval, even when I'm 70
years old.

a four-part series on his feelings about
being gay.
