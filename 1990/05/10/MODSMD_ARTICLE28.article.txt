## Unstoppable netters kick off the drive for five 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Call it"the drive for five." Think of
it as "one for the thumb." Dub it a
"five-peat." Christen it as you see fit.
Today, the Stanford women's tennis
team will begin its quest for a place
among the legends. The four-time
defending national champions enter
their second-round match against Ari
zona as the overwhelming favorites to
win yet another title.
Should the Cardinal live up to its No.
1 seeding it will tie the women's record
for consecutive NCAA championships
set by Texas swimming under current
Cardinal Coach Richard Quick.
After capturing six national crowns
in the 1980s, Stanford seems poised to
get a leg up on the '90s. The Cardinal
enters the tournament with a lineup
that dominates the Volvo/Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association rankings.
Freshman Meredith McGrath is the
top-rated player in the country even
though she plays No. 2 singles for the
Cardinal. Behind her in the rankings
is Stanford's No. 1 player, Sandra Birch.
Ten Whitlinger is ranked 11th, and
Debbie Graham holds the 13th spot.
But the ratings do not include the
results of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships where Graham defeated
Birch and McGrath.
Only Georgia (the Cardinal's probable
opponent tomorrow), Florida and Pep
perdine have even two players ranked
in the top 15. The Bulldogs one-two
punch of Shannan McCarthy (No. 6)
and Stacey Schefflin (No. 9) is probably
the nation's second best.
But Florida, with Andrea Farley (No.
5) and Nicole Arendt (No. 10), and Pep
perdine, with Ginger Helgeson (No. 4)
and Janna Kovacevich (No. 15) are also
formidable at the top.
While several teams can theoretically
match Stanford at Nos. 1 and 2, the
differences become overwhelming in the
three through six spots. No one can
touch Graham at third singles. Over
two years, she is 48-0 in team play. No
Stanford player has ever completed two
undefeated seasons. Look for Graham
to be the first.
Fourth singles is in the capable hands

of Whitlinger, who has actually lost a
match in the past two seasons. She was
defeated once last year by USC's Any a
Kochoff. In 1990, she has been flawless.
At No. 5, captain Lisa Green is closing
out her brilliant career by beating up
on overmatched opposition. Green
played No. 1 at NCAAs two years ago,
and the Cardinal romped. Enough said.
Freshman Heather Willens is ar
guably the finest No. 6 player in college
tennis. Since losing two matches early

in the season, she's been perfect as well.
At last year's tournament, Stanford
lost only one match. Birch dropped a
quarterfinal contest to Oklahoma
State's Monika Waniek. As unbelievable
as it may seem, the Cardinal could waltz
through without a single defeat this
time.
Georgia did not pick up a point when
it met Stanford at the National Team
