## Unstoppable netters kick off the drive for five 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Call it"the drive for five." Think of
it as "one for the thumb." Dub it a
"five-peat." Christen it as you see fit.
Today, the Stanford women's tennis
team will begin its quest for a place
among the legends. The four-time
defending national champions enter
their second-round match against Ari
zona as the overwhelming favorites to
win yet another title.
Should the Cardinal live up to its No.
1 seeding it will tie the women's record
for consecutive NCAA championships
set by Texas swimming under current
Cardinal Coach Richard Quick.
After capturing six national crowns
in the 1980s, Stanford seems poised to
get a leg up on the '90s. The Cardinal
enters the tournament with a lineup
that dominates the Volvo/Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association rankings.
Freshman Meredith McGrath is the
top-rated player in the country even
though she plays No. 2 singles for the
Cardinal. Behind her in the rankings
is Stanford's No. 1 player, Sandra Birch.
Ten Whitlinger is ranked 11th, and
Debbie Graham holds the 13th spot.
But the ratings do not include the
results of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships where Graham defeated
Birch and McGrath.
Only Georgia (the Cardinal's probable
opponent tomorrow), Florida and Pep
perdine have even two players ranked
in the top 15. The Bulldogs one-two
punch of Shannan McCarthy (No. 6)
and Stacey Schefflin (No. 9) is probably
the nation's second best.
But Florida, with Andrea Farley (No.
5) and Nicole Arendt (No. 10), and Pep
perdine, with Ginger Helgeson (No. 4)
and Janna Kovacevich (No. 15) are also
formidable at the top.
While several teams can theoretically
match Stanford at Nos. 1 and 2, the
differences become overwhelming in the
three through six spots. No one can
touch Graham at third singles. Over
two years, she is 48-0 in team play. No
Stanford player has ever completed two
undefeated seasons. Look for Graham
to be the first.
Fourth singles is in the capable hands

of Whitlinger, who has actually lost a
match in the past two seasons. She was
defeated once last year by USC's Any a
Kochoff. In 1990, she has been flawless.
At No. 5, captain Lisa Green is closing
out her brilliant career by beating up
on overmatched opposition. Green
played No. 1 at NCAAs two years ago,
and the Cardinal romped. Enough said.
Freshman Heather Willens is ar
guably the finest No. 6 player in college
tennis. Since losing two matches early

in the season, she's been perfect as well.
At last year's tournament, Stanford
lost only one match. Birch dropped a
quarterfinal contest to Oklahoma
State's Monika Waniek. As unbelievable
as it may seem, the Cardinal could waltz
through without a single defeat this
time.
Georgia did not pick up a point when
it met Stanford at the National Team

Sandra Birch and the four-time defending national champion tennis team start down
the road to the record book today in Gainesville, Fl.

Indoors. California is the Cardi
nal's likely semifinal foe. In two
matches this season, Stanford has
an aggregate advantage of 17-1.
The one was provided by Jean-
Marie Lozano when she shocked
McGrath. It is unlikely that will
happen again.
As for the finals, the other half
of the draw is wide open. Host
Florida has the pressure of the
home-court disadvantage. Since
the tournament adopted its pres
ent format in 1982, no home team
has even reached the finals. The
Lady Gators, seeded No. 2, are
seeking to change that this time.
Standing in their way is USC,
a team which may surprise from
its sixth-seed spot. Outside of
Graham, the Trojans Trisha Laux
is the hottest player in the coun
try. USC's doubles are surpris
ingly strong, but their Nos. 5 and
6 players are perhaps fatally
weak.
In the fourth quadrant, No. 11
Pepperdine is definitely the wild
card. The Waves are completely
healthy for the first time this
season. In 1989, they showed

moxie in nearly defeating Florida.
Arizona State is a likely upset
victim today.
The winner will probably face
UCLA, another squad plagued by
injuries. At full strength the
Bruins singles lineup is capable
of matching up with anyone's at
all spots except No. 2 where
Mamie Ceniza is sacrificed to
strengthen the overall team.
Unfortunately for UCLA, the
team will doubtless be below full
strength. No. 1 player Jessica Em
mons is recovering from a stress
fracture, and freshman Kim Po,
who could play No. 3 or 4 has
been out for two months with an
elbow injury.
No matter what happens, Stan
ford should be prepared — even
if a match goes to doubles.
McGrath and Whitlinger are un
defeated and the nation's top
ranked team. Behind them are
Birch and Graham, as formidable
a No. 2 team as any. Only at No.
3 doubles, where Green and Wil
lens have struggled, is the Cardi
nal an underdog against top com
petition.
The math, therefore, works as
follows: Should someone
miraculously take three singles

matches from Stanford — it
hasn't happened this season —
they would be hard pressed to
pick up a pair of wins in doubles.
It all adds up to another cham
pionship ring for Coach Frank
Brennan, the "Sorcerer of Stan
ford," and his Court of Disaster.
Card notes
Stanford has the misfortune of
drawing the afternoon session this
year. In '89, the Cardinal got to play
in the morning and avoid the hot
Florida sun. Stanford will play at 3:30
p.m. (EDT) today.
Tomorrow's match time is to be an
nounced.
Four Stanford women — Birch,
McGrath, Graham and Whitlinger —
have a chance to pull off an unprece
dented triple: winning the team,
singles and doubles titles in the same
year. Patty Fendick in 1987 and Birch
in 1989 have come closer than anyone,
each reaching the doubles final. Green
will play the singles event, but not
doubles.
Stanford has not had a doubles
champion since Linda Gates and
Leigh Anne Eldredge won the title
in 1985. Individual singles and dou
bles begins Monday.
Assoc. Athletic Director Alan Cum

mings is making the trip because the
Cardinal will play host to the event
in 1991 and '92.
Lost-in-the-shufTle dept.: Stanford
signed the top recruit in the nation
Laxmi Poruri of Upland, Calif, to a
letter of intent. Poruri will be expected
to fill the big shoes vacated by Green.
In addition, McGrath may turn pro.
With returning depth including Mario
Carruth and Kylie Johnson, the Car
dinal will contend again either way.
Unlike last season, Gator Coach
Andy Brandi is not making any pre
dictions about how his team will fare.
He guaranteed that if a theoretical
final between Stanford and Florida
went to doubles, his Lady Gators
would win the match and the cham
pionship. The team lost in the semis
to UCLA.
Stanford is currently 25-0 and is
riding a 61-match winning streak. The
Cardinal was undefeated in 1975, '76,
'82, '84 and '89. Brennan is 246-29
in his tenure here, a .895 winning
percentage.
Graham, Willens, McGrath, Car
ruth and Johnson have never seen
the team lose a dual match. Whit
linger and Birch have experienced two
defeats. Green has been around for a
whopping six.

the team lose a dual match. Whit

defeats. Green has been around for a

Call it"the drive for five." Think of
it as "one for the thumb." Dub it a
"five-peat." Christen it as you see fit.
Today, the Stanford women's tennis
team will begin its quest for a place
among the legends. The four-time
defending national champions enter
their second-round match against Ari
zona as the overwhelming favorites to
win yet another title.
Should the Cardinal live up to its No.
1 seeding it will tie the women's record
for consecutive NCAA championships
set by Texas swimming under current
Cardinal Coach Richard Quick.
After capturing six national crowns
in the 1980s, Stanford seems poised to
get a leg up on the '90s. The Cardinal
enters the tournament with a lineup
that dominates the Volvo/Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association rankings.
Freshman Meredith McGrath is the
top-rated player in the country even
though she plays No. 2 singles for the
Cardinal. Behind her in the rankings
is Stanford's No. 1 player, Sandra Birch.
Ten Whitlinger is ranked 11th, and
Debbie Graham holds the 13th spot.
But the ratings do not include the
results of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships where Graham defeated
Birch and McGrath.
Only Georgia (the Cardinal's probable
opponent tomorrow), Florida and Pep
perdine have even two players ranked
in the top 15. The Bulldogs one-two
punch of Shannan McCarthy (No. 6)
and Stacey Schefflin (No. 9) is probably
the nation's second best.
But Florida, with Andrea Farley (No.
5) and Nicole Arendt (No. 10), and Pep
perdine, with Ginger Helgeson (No. 4)
and Janna Kovacevich (No. 15) are also
formidable at the top.
While several teams can theoretically
match Stanford at Nos. 1 and 2, the
differences become overwhelming in the
three through six spots. No one can
touch Graham at third singles. Over
two years, she is 48-0 in team play. No
Stanford player has ever completed two
undefeated seasons. Look for Graham
to be the first.
Fourth singles is in the capable hands

of Whitlinger, who has actually lost a
match in the past two seasons. She was
defeated once last year by USC's Any a
Kochoff. In 1990, she has been flawless.
At No. 5, captain Lisa Green is closing
out her brilliant career by beating up
on overmatched opposition. Green
played No. 1 at NCAAs two years ago,
and the Cardinal romped. Enough said.
Freshman Heather Willens is ar
guably the finest No. 6 player in college
tennis. Since losing two matches early

in the season, she's been perfect as well.
At last year's tournament, Stanford
lost only one match. Birch dropped a
quarterfinal contest to Oklahoma
State's Monika Waniek. As unbelievable
as it may seem, the Cardinal could waltz
through without a single defeat this
time.
Georgia did not pick up a point when
it met Stanford at the National Team

Sandra Birch and the four-time defending national champion tennis team start down
the road to the record book today in Gainesville, Fl.

Indoors. California is the Cardi
nal's likely semifinal foe. In two
matches this season, Stanford has
an aggregate advantage of 17-1.
The one was provided by Jean-
Marie Lozano when she shocked
McGrath. It is unlikely that will
happen again.
As for the finals, the other half
of the draw is wide open. Host
Florida has the pressure of the
home-court disadvantage. Since
the tournament adopted its pres
ent format in 1982, no home team
has even reached the finals. The
Lady Gators, seeded No. 2, are
seeking to change that this time.
Standing in their way is USC,
a team which may surprise from
its sixth-seed spot. Outside of
Graham, the Trojans Trisha Laux
is the hottest player in the coun
try. USC's doubles are surpris
ingly strong, but their Nos. 5 and
6 players are perhaps fatally
weak.
In the fourth quadrant, No. 11
Pepperdine is definitely the wild
card. The Waves are completely
healthy for the first time this
season. In 1989, they showed

moxie in nearly defeating Florida.
Arizona State is a likely upset
victim today.
The winner will probably face
UCLA, another squad plagued by
injuries. At full strength the
Bruins singles lineup is capable
of matching up with anyone's at
all spots except No. 2 where
Mamie Ceniza is sacrificed to
strengthen the overall team.
Unfortunately for UCLA, the
team will doubtless be below full
strength. No. 1 player Jessica Em
mons is recovering from a stress
fracture, and freshman Kim Po,
who could play No. 3 or 4 has
been out for two months with an
elbow injury.
No matter what happens, Stan
ford should be prepared — even
if a match goes to doubles.
McGrath and Whitlinger are un
defeated and the nation's top
ranked team. Behind them are
Birch and Graham, as formidable
a No. 2 team as any. Only at No.
3 doubles, where Green and Wil
lens have struggled, is the Cardi
nal an underdog against top com
petition.
The math, therefore, works as
follows: Should someone
miraculously take three singles

matches from Stanford — it
hasn't happened this season —
they would be hard pressed to
pick up a pair of wins in doubles.
It all adds up to another cham
pionship ring for Coach Frank
Brennan, the "Sorcerer of Stan
ford," and his Court of Disaster.
Card notes
Stanford has the misfortune of
drawing the afternoon session this
year. In '89, the Cardinal got to play
in the morning and avoid the hot
Florida sun. Stanford will play at 3:30
p.m. (EDT) today.
Tomorrow's match time is to be an
nounced.
Four Stanford women — Birch,
McGrath, Graham and Whitlinger —
have a chance to pull off an unprece
dented triple: winning the team,
singles and doubles titles in the same
year. Patty Fendick in 1987 and Birch
in 1989 have come closer than anyone,
each reaching the doubles final. Green
will play the singles event, but not
doubles.
Stanford has not had a doubles
champion since Linda Gates and
Leigh Anne Eldredge won the title
in 1985. Individual singles and dou
bles begins Monday.
Assoc. Athletic Director Alan Cum

mings is making the trip because the
Cardinal will play host to the event
in 1991 and '92.
Lost-in-the-shufTle dept.: Stanford
signed the top recruit in the nation
Laxmi Poruri of Upland, Calif, to a
letter of intent. Poruri will be expected
to fill the big shoes vacated by Green.
In addition, McGrath may turn pro.
With returning depth including Mario
Carruth and Kylie Johnson, the Car
dinal will contend again either way.
Unlike last season, Gator Coach
Andy Brandi is not making any pre
dictions about how his team will fare.
He guaranteed that if a theoretical
final between Stanford and Florida
went to doubles, his Lady Gators
would win the match and the cham
pionship. The team lost in the semis
to UCLA.
Stanford is currently 25-0 and is
riding a 61-match winning streak. The
Cardinal was undefeated in 1975, '76,
'82, '84 and '89. Brennan is 246-29
in his tenure here, a .895 winning
percentage.
