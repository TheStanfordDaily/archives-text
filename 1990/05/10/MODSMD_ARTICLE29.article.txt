# Pathetic defense and other lowlights of the 1990 baseball season
## 
### 
One of the biggest cliches in sports,
preached by coaches and loud
mouthed TV analysts alike, is that
defense wins ballgames. And, even though
it's been run into the ground over and
over, the rule still holds true: A team
that plays great D will most often win.
Of course, grand-slam home runs,
fastballs that break the sound barrier,
line drives that knock holes in the out
field fence and umpires who give the
home pitchers a strike zone the size of
a battleship also help teams win. Just
for the sake of argument, though, let's
go with the conventional wisdom and say
that defense is what gets the job done.
Actually, let's just look at a corollary
of the defense-wins theorem, which comes
in three parts: (a) Bad defense makes
teams lose; (b) Lousy defense makes
teams lose more often; and (c) Pathetic
defense makes teams lose in an almost
comical manner.
For example, take Tuesday's Stanford-
San Francisco St. game (and take it far,
far away). The final score was 10-6, but
the outcome turned on four defensive
plays:

Play No.l: In the top of the first, Gator
third baseman Raymund Sabado fields a
grounder from David Holbrook and
throws it in the dirt, letting one run
score. The first baseman argues with the
ump, leaving the ball in the dirt (quite
the intelligent move), and another run
scores before he realizes what's up.
Play No. 2: In the bottom of the ninth,
with the bases loaded, one down and
Stanford up 5-4, reliever Brian Sackinsky
is trying to slam the door on SFSU. With
the count 1-1, he throws a fastball out
side. Waaaaaaay outside, and catcher
Mark Skeels has to dive right, throw out
his glove and land on his face in order
to keep the ball from flying into the
Pacific.
Two pitches later the Gators tie it up
anyway, but without Skeels' catch the
run that scores is the winning one.
Play No. 3: Troy Paulsen is the hero
an inning later, diving to snare a line
drive and doubling off the runner on
first. The next batter doubles. Without
Paulsen's catch Stanford loses.
Finally, Play No. 4: In the 11th, with
the bases full and two out, David McCarty

hits a chopper to Sabado, who makes a
great play to grab the ball. He throws
to second for the force, and the second
baseman flat-out drops the ball. Two runs
come in, and the error lets Paul Carey
put the game away with a homer.
Good defense wins. Bad defense puts
games on the proverbial silver platter
and hands them over.
Pathetic defense, though, can be fun
to watch. Hey, when a team (such
as, say, California) can take simple
ground balls, fly outs and popups and
turn them into adventures worthy of your
favorite set of stooges, that's something
to applaud!
In honor of the Bears, Gators and Cal
ifornia third baseman Mike "Five-errors
in-11-chances" Muhlethaler, then, here
are the Defensive Screwups of 1990. Call
'em the Muhlies. In no particular order
of reeking:
Worst pickoff move at the worst time:
Arizona State's Gary Tatterson. With his
team losing 4-0 two weekends ago in
Tempe, Tatterson tried to pick off
Holbrook in the third inning and threw

the ball halfway to Mexico. Paul Carey
scored on the play, and Holbrook, who
went all the way to third before the ball
found its way back to the infield, scored
on Ryan Turner's sacrifice fly.
The Cardinal went on to win 10-7, and
Tatterson was so pleased with his pickoff
move he tried it again the same inning
on Roger Burnett. Same result.
Worst play on a popup: The entire Cal
infield, for their performance in the third
inning of the April 12 loss to Stanford.
Troy Tallman led off the inning by hitting
the ball straight up, and Cal's pitcher,
catcher, first baseman and third baseman
converged a few feet from the plate. All
four stared at the ball. All four glanced

at each other.
All four watched the ball hit the
ground. An inch fair.
Whoop whoop whoop!! Nyuck, nyuck.
Most costly drop: Arizona first base
man Troy Bradford's goof in the seventh
inning of a 3-3 game with the Cardinal
in Tucson. Bradford started the fun when
he took a pickoff throw from the pitcher
and let the ball fall through a hole in
his glove, allowing Jeff Hammonds to get
to second.
Hammonds scored the go-ahead run,
which started a six-run rally and ended
the game. Run No. 5 scored on third
baseman Brian Eldridge's one-hopped
throw to first, and No. 6 came in on a
wild pitch. Without Bradford's drop, the
Cardinal scores zero runs in the inning.
Infield most likely to maul a fielder:
San Jose St.'s Municipal Stadium. Unan
imously. Stanford's Roger Burnett caught
one ground ball in the shoulder and an
other in the neck thanks to a field that
gave bouncers a mind of their own. Each
team had three errors because of the


Cameron
Macky
minefield, and the winning run
was brought in by a chopper from
Burnett that almost killed short
stop Steve Anderson.
The "Asleep at the Wheel"
award for most clueless out
fielder: San Jose's Greg Mugg,
who, in the third inning of the
same game, camped under a long
fly from Tim Griffin, waited,
waited, kept looking up, and fi
nally watched the ball drop 20
feet to his left. No one knows if
the full moon had anything to do

with it.
The Laurence Olivier award
for Best Acting Performance,
Left Field: Cal's Reid Neumann.
With the Bears winning 2-1 and
one gone in the top of the ninth
Sunday at Cal, Holbrook hit a fly
ball deep to left. Neumann raced
back and decided to add a little
drama to the play by running to
the fence and acting like the ball
was going out. He then moved up
about 10 feet, made the catch and
held the ball over his head just a
little longer than he had to.
Two pitches later, Turner
homered to tie the score. The Car
dinal won in the 10th, thanks to
an E on right fielder Chris

Facione. .
Most schizophrenic fielder:
Muhlethaler. Five errors in three
games last weekend. What didn't
make sense was that when he
wasn't booting the ball into left
field, he was making an outstand
ing moving throw to gun down a
runner at first.
Hey, you figure it out.
The Divine Intervention
Award: The twilight on Friday,
April 27 at ASU's Packard Stadi
um. (Actually, I'm kind of inclined
to think God has more important
things on his mind than a baseball
game, but . . .) Down two runs in
the 12th, Stanford hits two
straight popups to the outfield.

Routine plays. Easy plays.
Both times, the outfielders lose
the ball and let it drop right in
front of them. Minutes later,
Turner comes through with a
single to score the winning run.
No twilight, no win, and a very
slim lead in the Six-Pac race.
Defense wins.
So does luck.

Cameron Macky, The Daily's base
ball writer, led his Little League
team in errors (in spite of playing
maybe once every other week) and
makes Mike Muhlethaler look like
Brooks Robinson.

teams lose; (b) Lousy defense makes
teams lose more often; and (c) Pathetic
defense makes teams lose in an almost
comical manner.
For example, take Tuesday's Stanford-
San Francisco St. game (and take it far,
far away). The final score was 10-6, but
the outcome turned on four defensive
plays:

Play No.l: In the top of the first, Gator
third baseman Raymund Sabado fields a
grounder from David Holbrook and
throws it in the dirt, letting one run
score. The first baseman argues with the
ump, leaving the ball in the dirt (quite
the intelligent move), and another run
scores before he realizes what's up.
Play No. 2: In the bottom of the ninth,
with the bases loaded, one down and
Stanford up 5-4, reliever Brian Sackinsky
is trying to slam the door on SFSU. With
the count 1-1, he throws a fastball out
side. Waaaaaaay outside, and catcher
Mark Skeels has to dive right, throw out
his glove and land on his face in order
to keep the ball from flying into the
Pacific.
Two pitches later the Gators tie it up
anyway, but without Skeels' catch the
run that scores is the winning one.
Play No. 3: Troy Paulsen is the hero
an inning later, diving to snare a line
drive and doubling off the runner on
first. The next batter doubles. Without
Paulsen's catch Stanford loses.
Finally, Play No. 4: In the 11th, with
the bases full and two out, David McCarty

hits a chopper to Sabado, who makes a
great play to grab the ball. He throws
to second for the force, and the second
baseman flat-out drops the ball. Two runs
come in, and the error lets Paul Carey
put the game away with a homer.
Good defense wins. Bad defense puts
games on the proverbial silver platter
and hands them over.
Pathetic defense, though, can be fun
to watch. Hey, when a team (such
as, say, California) can take simple
ground balls, fly outs and popups and
turn them into adventures worthy of your
favorite set of stooges, that's something
to applaud!
In honor of the Bears, Gators and Cal
ifornia third baseman Mike "Five-errors
in-11-chances" Muhlethaler, then, here
are the Defensive Screwups of 1990. Call
'em the Muhlies. In no particular order
of reeking:
Worst pickoff move at the worst time:
Arizona State's Gary Tatterson. With his
team losing 4-0 two weekends ago in
Tempe, Tatterson tried to pick off
Holbrook in the third inning and threw

the ball halfway to Mexico. Paul Carey
scored on the play, and Holbrook, who
went all the way to third before the ball
found its way back to the infield, scored
on Ryan Turner's sacrifice fly.
The Cardinal went on to win 10-7, and
Tatterson was so pleased with his pickoff
move he tried it again the same inning
on Roger Burnett. Same result.
Worst play on a popup: The entire Cal
infield, for their performance in the third
inning of the April 12 loss to Stanford.
Troy Tallman led off the inning by hitting
the ball straight up, and Cal's pitcher,
catcher, first baseman and third baseman
converged a few feet from the plate. All
four stared at the ball. All four glanced

at each other.
All four watched the ball hit the
ground. An inch fair.
Whoop whoop whoop!! Nyuck, nyuck.
Most costly drop: Arizona first base
man Troy Bradford's goof in the seventh
inning of a 3-3 game with the Cardinal
in Tucson. Bradford started the fun when
he took a pickoff throw from the pitcher
and let the ball fall through a hole in
his glove, allowing Jeff Hammonds to get
to second.
Hammonds scored the go-ahead run,
which started a six-run rally and ended
the game. Run No. 5 scored on third
baseman Brian Eldridge's one-hopped
throw to first, and No. 6 came in on a
wild pitch. Without Bradford's drop, the
Cardinal scores zero runs in the inning.
Infield most likely to maul a fielder:
San Jose St.'s Municipal Stadium. Unan
imously. Stanford's Roger Burnett caught
one ground ball in the shoulder and an
other in the neck thanks to a field that
gave bouncers a mind of their own. Each
team had three errors because of the


Cameron
Macky
minefield, and the winning run
was brought in by a chopper from
Burnett that almost killed short
stop Steve Anderson.
The "Asleep at the Wheel"
award for most clueless out
fielder: San Jose's Greg Mugg,
who, in the third inning of the
same game, camped under a long
fly from Tim Griffin, waited,
waited, kept looking up, and fi
nally watched the ball drop 20
feet to his left. No one knows if
the full moon had anything to do

with it.
The Laurence Olivier award
for Best Acting Performance,
Left Field: Cal's Reid Neumann.
With the Bears winning 2-1 and
one gone in the top of the ninth
Sunday at Cal, Holbrook hit a fly
ball deep to left. Neumann raced
back and decided to add a little
drama to the play by running to
the fence and acting like the ball
was going out. He then moved up
about 10 feet, made the catch and
held the ball over his head just a
little longer than he had to.
Two pitches later, Turner
homered to tie the score. The Car
dinal won in the 10th, thanks to
an E on right fielder Chris

Facione. .
Most schizophrenic fielder:
Muhlethaler. Five errors in three
games last weekend. What didn't
make sense was that when he
wasn't booting the ball into left
field, he was making an outstand
ing moving throw to gun down a
runner at first.
Hey, you figure it out.
The Divine Intervention
Award: The twilight on Friday,
April 27 at ASU's Packard Stadi
um. (Actually, I'm kind of inclined
to think God has more important
things on his mind than a baseball
game, but . . .) Down two runs in
the 12th, Stanford hits two
straight popups to the outfield.

Routine plays. Easy plays.
Both times, the outfielders lose
the ball and let it drop right in
front of them. Minutes later,
Turner comes through with a
single to score the winning run.
No twilight, no win, and a very
slim lead in the Six-Pac race.
Defense wins.
So does luck.

Cameron Macky, The Daily's base
ball writer, led his Little League
team in errors (in spite of playing
maybe once every other week) and
makes Mike Muhlethaler look like
Brooks Robinson.
One of the biggest cliches in sports,
preached by coaches and loud
mouthed TV analysts alike, is that
defense wins ballgames. And, even though
it's been run into the ground over and
over, the rule still holds true: A team
that plays great D will most often win.
Of course, grand-slam home runs,
fastballs that break the sound barrier,
line drives that knock holes in the out
field fence and umpires who give the
home pitchers a strike zone the size of
a battleship also help teams win. Just
for the sake of argument, though, let's
go with the conventional wisdom and say
that defense is what gets the job done.
