# New group provides support for lesbians
##

When Lauren Mac Neill first
came to the Law School, she felt
as though she were stranded in
a desert.

Now a third-year law student,
Mac Neill is among the estimated
hundreds of gay women at Stan
ford who find little support in its
loosely knit lesbian and bisexual
community.
But a new group on campus
hopes to provide a better network
for communication. Calling itself
Beyond Heterosexuality, the
group seeks to facilitate social in
teraction and relationships among
Stanford women.
Traditionally, lesbians and bi

sexual women could meet through
socials and dances sponsored by
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford.
But many lesbians were disap
pointed to discover that the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center and its com
ponent organizations are over
whelmingly male in membership.
Before the founding of Beyond
Heterosexuality, "There really
wasn't a good way to get to know
the other people in the [lesbian
and bisexuall community," says
Mac Neill.
The fledgling group now has 47
members, including students, fac
ulty and staff.
The name of the group actually
was derived from the name of a
support group that, in turn, grew
out of a feminist studies class.
Participation in the class and the
support group inspired Elizabeth
Howton, a senior, to found the
social network. Howton says,"It
was the name and also the fact
that so many women were there

that I didn't know. There were
15 or 20 from the class alone."
She had been thinking of start
ing some kind of social network
for a couple of years. When a
Counseling and Psychological
Services report released in March

found that the worst problem for
lesbian and bisexual women at
Stanford was a lack of community,
"the idea really gelled," says How
ton.
New members, after agreeing
to protect the privacy of other
members, receive a membership
list.
According to Mac Neill, the con
fidentiality of Beyond Heterosex

uality is crucial, especially for
women who are just coming out.
"For some women, something
like this is far less threatening
than some of the more traditional
routes," Mac Neill says. "When I
first was coming out, I didn't even
want to go to the Women's
Resource Center at my college, be
cause you knew there were les
bians there."
