# Rad windsurfers hit the waves

Sophomore Ted Huang has proven that Stan
ford is indeed a place where one man's dream
can become reality.
Huang, a competitive windsurfer currently
ranked No. 1 in the country, has spent the
past two years working towards the creation
of a boardsailing team here. This spring, Stan
ford has begun to reap the fruits of Huang's
labor. Windsurfers from universities all over
California will participate in the Western Re
gional Championships, sponsored by Stanford
and Mistral Inc., a board manufacturer. The
regatta will be held this Saturday and Sunday
at the Berkeley Yacht club.
The competitors in each race must maneuver
around a designated course in San Francisco
Bay. The two regattas are "one-design" races,
meaning that the participants compete on
identical boards. At the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships, held in winds exceeding 35 mph on
April 28-29, Huang handily won the 'A' race.
Junior Chris Tawney took first in the 'B' race.
Because of the inclement weather, not all
of the 20 men and women that make up the
team were able to race. "Normally, we would
try to get everyone to compete," Tawney said.
"But at the Pacific Coast Championships, the
conditions were so gnarly that we couldn't all
race." Yea, gnarly. This is no ordinary inter
collegiate sport.
Not many of the schools that participated
in the race had a formal windsurfing program,
and still fewer featured a team as strong as
Stanford's. However, interest is on the rise,
and a much larger field will be
present at this weekend's event.
At least 13 schools are expected
to participate, including UCLA,
Long Beach State, UC-Irvine, and
UC-Santa Barbara. The race is

open to all California collegiate
boardsailors.
Huang and others are currently
working to create a Pacific Coast
Collegiate Boardsailing Associa
tion, which would build a network
of schools.
Until then, however, windsurf
ing will remain just another
spring sport that Stanford
dominates.
