# Hickerson leaping for records ... and gaining recognition
## 
### Uri Attia 
Despite the fact that he has spent three
years in the limelight as one of the most
brilliant performers on Stanford's track and
field team, long jumper Marcus Hickerson
still can't get used to the recognition he
receives on campus.
"Stanford is full of superstar athletes,"
Hickerson said. "There are swimmers who
have set world records and won gold medals
[in the Olympic Games), there are tennis
players who are national champions. . . I
thought that I would just blend in with
the rest of the students and athletes."
This has hardly been the case.
The Morristown, N. J. native has been
on a tear as of late, most recently leaping
an astounding 26 feet, inch last Saturday
at the Modesto Relays. Hickerson has an
excellent chance of capturing the Pacific
10 Conference Championship in the long
jump this year, which would make him the
first Stanford jumper since NFL legend
James Lofton to win the event. Lofton,
who also holds the Stanford long jump
record of 26' 11", won the Pac-10 title in
1978.
Hickerson's athletic accomplishments
with Stanford are amazing: in addition to
his prowess in the long jump, he has run
the 400 meters in 47.57 seconds, triple
jumped 46' 6 V4" and helped his relay team
post a 3:11.80 in the 4x400. Last year, he
placed fourth at Pac-lOs in the long jump
with a leap of 25' 1 V-T.
Although Hickerson's astounding
achievements on the track suggest a
lifetime inclination towards the sport, track
took back seat to basketball for much of

his high school career. Since Hickerson was
not permitted to participate in both sports
simultaneously, he regularly missed the in
door track season. However, he still man
aged to enter the Pathmark National
Scholastic Championships his senior year.
He finished fourth among top competitors
without a single day of training, a feat in
which even the unassuming Hickerson
takes pride.
"My high school track coach couldn't en
ter me in Nationals [because of basketball!,
so I had to enter myself," Hickerson said.
"Finishing as well as I did was one of the
best moments of my career. It gave me a
lot of confidence for the outdoor season."
Unfortunately, Hickerson's high school
track career would close on a sour note as
he failed to capture the New Jersey state
championship, which he was favored to
win. "I was a little too cocky going into
the meet," Hickerson said. "I wound up
fouling on my first two jumps, and I jumped
so early on my last that it cost me a foot
or two and the championship."
The lesson Hickerson learned at the state
championships proved to be far more im
portant than winning would have been.
Any cockiness he may have had in high
school has since all but disappeared, ena
bling Hickerson to devote his full energy
to his own improvement in the event.
Hickerson's rise to prominence in the
long jump has been nothing short of as
tounding. He has established personal bests
in each of the last two meets, each time
bettering his previous mark by over five
inches and shows no sign of slowing his

improvement. "Marcus is one of
the emerging young American
stars in the world of track and
field," Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
said. "His 26-foot leap puts him
in a very elite group of collegiate
jumpers."
So elite, in fact, that Hickerson
is only one of three athletes that
Chisam regards as contenders for
the Pac-10 crown. "The meet will
come down to Marcus, Latin
Berry of Oregon, and Percy Knox
of Arizona," Chisam said.
"Marcus is in a position in which
one good jump could easily win
the whole thing for him." The
event will be held May 19-20 at
the University of Washington.
Despite the fact that Hickerson
is considered one of the finest
long jumpers in the country, he
has yet to qualify for the NCAA
championships. He attributes this
to the extremely formidable qual
ifying distance in the event. "A
jump as long as the qualifying
standard for NCAAs [7.95 meters]
would have placed sixth at the
last Olympics," Hickerson said.
"It's an incredibly difficult event

to qualify in." His leap at Modesto
was 7.94 meters.
Hickerson's last chance to
qualify for NCAAs will be at the
Pac-10 championships. According
to Chisam, it is very likely that
Hickerson will be making the trip.
"Marcus has done his best at the
big meets [Big Meet against
Berkeley and the Modesto
Relays], and I'm sure he will rise
to the occasion again at Pac-lOs."
If he makes the distance, he will
join Bill Crowley, who will run
the 1500-meter race, Chryste
Gaines, who will run the 100, and
heptathlete Peggy Odita at na
tionals, which will be held at Duke
University May 30-June 2.
Hickerson is optimistic not only
about his own performance in the
Pac-10 Championships, but of the
team's chances as well. He sees
no reason why the team should
not dramatically improve on last
season's seventh-place finish. "We
haven't lost any scorers from last
year's team," Hickerson said,
"and we have a chance to win a
number of the events. Bill
Crowley should win the 1500, and
Dave Strang's got a chance in the
800."
And let's not forget Marcus
Hickerson in the long jump.
