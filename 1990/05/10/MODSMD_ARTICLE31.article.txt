# Hickerson leaping for records ... and gaining recognition

Despite the fact that he has spent three
years in the limelight as one of the most
brilliant performers on Stanford's track and
field team, long jumper Marcus Hickerson
still can't get used to the recognition he
receives on campus.
"Stanford is full of superstar athletes,"
Hickerson said. "There are swimmers who
have set world records and won gold medals
[in the Olympic Games), there are tennis
players who are national champions. . . I
thought that I would just blend in with
the rest of the students and athletes."
This has hardly been the case.
The Morristown, N. J. native has been
on a tear as of late, most recently leaping
an astounding 26 feet, inch last Saturday
at the Modesto Relays. Hickerson has an
excellent chance of capturing the Pacific
10 Conference Championship in the long
jump this year, which would make him the
first Stanford jumper since NFL legend
James Lofton to win the event. Lofton,
who also holds the Stanford long jump
record of 26' 11", won the Pac-10 title in
1978.
Hickerson's athletic accomplishments
with Stanford are amazing: in addition to
his prowess in the long jump, he has run
the 400 meters in 47.57 seconds, triple
jumped 46' 6 V4" and helped his relay team
post a 3:11.80 in the 4x400. Last year, he
placed fourth at Pac-lOs in the long jump
with a leap of 25' 1 V-T.
Although Hickerson's astounding
achievements on the track suggest a
lifetime inclination towards the sport, track
took back seat to basketball for much of

his high school career. Since Hickerson was
not permitted to participate in both sports
simultaneously, he regularly missed the in
door track season. However, he still man
aged to enter the Pathmark National
Scholastic Championships his senior year.
He finished fourth among top competitors
without a single day of training, a feat in
which even the unassuming Hickerson
takes pride.
"My high school track coach couldn't en
ter me in Nationals [because of basketball!,
so I had to enter myself," Hickerson said.
"Finishing as well as I did was one of the
best moments of my career. It gave me a
lot of confidence for the outdoor season."
Unfortunately, Hickerson's high school
track career would close on a sour note as
he failed to capture the New Jersey state
championship, which he was favored to
win. "I was a little too cocky going into
the meet," Hickerson said. "I wound up
fouling on my first two jumps, and I jumped
so early on my last that it cost me a foot
or two and the championship."
The lesson Hickerson learned at the state
championships proved to be far more im
portant than winning would have been.
Any cockiness he may have had in high
school has since all but disappeared, ena
bling Hickerson to devote his full energy
to his own improvement in the event.
Hickerson's rise to prominence in the
long jump has been nothing short of as
tounding. He has established personal bests
in each of the last two meets, each time
bettering his previous mark by over five
inches and shows no sign of slowing his
