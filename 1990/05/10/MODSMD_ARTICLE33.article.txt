Damian Marhofka — Daily
Bart's successor
John Overdeck, a graduate student In statistics, will occupy the ASSU Senate seat representing the Humanities &
Sciences District — a seat which cartoon character Bart Simpson captured in the recent ASSU election. Because
Simpson is not a registered student eligible to hold office here, he was booted from the race. With Simpson's dis
qualification, the three write-in votes Overdeck received were enough to put him In a three-way tie for the final seat
in the not-too-hlghly contested H&S District. The other two potential senators agreed to let Overdeck take the Job.
Although eager to begin his work, Overdeck said he thought Simpson would have done a better job.
