# ALL THAT JAZZ
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Senior staff writer 
Jazz makes great theme music
for life's singular moments. It hits
you hard, it hits ydty deep, "jazz
is orgasm," says Norman Mailer.
While that hasn't quite been my
experience, I can say that jazz is
passion, emotion recollected in ex
plosive sound. And jazz is the
heartbeat of the Bay Area's night
life.
The KJAZ DJ's have a hand on
the pulse of the local jazz beat.
According to part-time DJ Robert
Berenson, "The Bay Area is a really
hot place for live jazz." Berenson
and the KJAZ regulars frequent
many of the Bay Area's best jazz
clubs.
Along with Berenson, full-time
DJ Greg Bridges gives high marks
to Kimball's East at 5800 Shel-
Imound, in Emoryville (between
Berkeley and Oakland). "It's a nice
sized place, but it still gives you
an intimate feel," Bridges says.
"Kimball's East is, I think, the
nicest physical environment for
jazz music in the Bay Area," adds
Berenson. "And they have some
««|lly high-class acts."
J You've heard of Dizzy Gillespie?
He'll be at Kimball's East from
P Tuesday, May 22 through Sunday,
May 29. Tickets are on sale now
through BASS, or at the Kimball's
box office. For the performances
on Tuesday through Thursday and
Sunday, the cover charge is $15;
Friday and Saturday performances
have an $18 cover charge.
As with most )azz clubs, cover
charges at Kimball's East vary with
the act. And, like some favorite
Bay Area jazz spots, Kimball's East
also boasts a good restaurant with
an extensive menu.
Across the bay in the City, the
menu is smaller, the surroundings
more intimate, in Kimball's West.
Located at 300 Grove Street, be
hind the Opera House, Kimball's
West is at the forefront of local
jazz entertainment.
"Kimball's in the City is a really
intimate jazz club," Bridges says.
"The sight lines are great, and the
sound is pretty good," he adds.
You can eaten the energizing
sounds of jazz vocalist Carol Sloan
tonight at 9 and 11; cover charge
is $12. Next week, Kimball's hosts
saxophonist Scott Hamilton. The
cover charge for performances on
Wednesday through Thursday is
$12; Fnday and Saturday perform
ances carry a $15 charge.
If you're in a bluesy mood, try
Slim's at 11th and Folsom in San
Francisco. "Most of the time Slim's
has blues," Bridges says. "But they
do occassionally bnng in jazz art
ists — like the World Six Quartet."
If you'll take the advice of a
sentimental gal like me, one of my
favorite blues bars is The Fifth
Amendment at 3255 Lakeshore
Avenue in Oakland It's a place
with a cool name and hot bands,
a cozy neighborhood bar that fea
tures a different blues band every
night of the week. "We never have
a cover charge," the bartender
boasts.

But they do have spillover
crowds. The bar is small, and by
the end of the evening you can't
help but be on intimate terms with
your neighbors. But the live blues
music creates its own clean, well
lit place, and when you softly
touch your lover's hand, you're
alone together in a world of sound.
Such rapturous aesthetic trans
port can also be yours in the less
earthy, more ethereal surroundings
of the Concepts Cultural Gallery
in Oakland. The CCG, at 480
Third Street in Oakland, offers a
unique entertainment environ
ment. "It's like listening to a con
cert inside of an art gallery," says
Bridges.
"It's a great place," Berenson
says. "They have more modern
players, some unusual acts." This
Friday night, for example, The
Concepts Cultural Gallery will fea
ture a saxophone/pcrcussion duo.
Cover charge is $13.
While both Bridges and Berenson
admire the innovative program
ming and interesting surroundings
at the CCG, both agree that
Yoshi's in Oakland bills the best
live jazz the Bay Area has to offer.
"It's a great place to see trios and
soloists, because of the intimacy
of the music room," says KTAZ DJ
Greg Bridges. "Yoshi's has very
good sound."
And very good performers. Re
member our friend Dizzy; He
played Yoshi's last New Year's Eve.
"Dizzy's great," Yoshi says. "We'll
have him every year, I hope."
You've heard of |azz singer Car
men Mcßae? She and her long
time trio will be playing Yoshi's
next week, from May 15 to 19.
The cover charge for the 8 and 10
p.m. sets on Tuesday through
Thursday is $15; the 9 and 11
p.m. sets on Friday and Saturday
take a $20 cover.
In the meantime, you can catch
the complex sounds of "Oregon,"
playing Yoshi's (6030 Clarcmont
Ave., Oakland) through Saturday.
If you enjoy scintillating reeds and
driving rhythms, you'll love
"Oregon." The explosive quartet
features Paul McCandless on
reeds, Ralph Towner on piano and
guitar, Trilok Gurtu on tabla and
percussion and Glen Moore on
bass.
The group's classical iazz sound
is energized by Third-World
rhythms and surreal musical
voices. In their first set on Tuesday
night, the band treated the audi
ence to a brilliant, haunting im
provisation. Towner's keyboards
called forth the eerie sounds of a
whalesong; Gurtu's percussion
relied on the rhythms of nature,
from rattling shells to the sound
of bubbling water.
In their closing number, Moore's
laughing, light-hearted "Leather
Cats," Gurtu's instruments in
clude, among other things, an in
flated party balloon held over a
microphone to capture the shriek
of escaping air.
"Oregon" is an act you shouldn't
miss. But whenever you finally
make it to Yoshi's, you won't be
disappointed

Jazz makes great theme music
for life's singular moments. It hits
you hard, it hits ydty deep, "jazz
is orgasm," says Norman Mailer.
While that hasn't quite been my
experience, I can say that jazz is
passion, emotion recollected in ex
plosive sound. And jazz is the
heartbeat of the Bay Area's night
life.
The KJAZ DJ's have a hand on
the pulse of the local jazz beat.
According to part-time DJ Robert
Berenson, "The Bay Area is a really
hot place for live jazz." Berenson
and the KJAZ regulars frequent
many of the Bay Area's best jazz
clubs.
Along with Berenson, full-time
DJ Greg Bridges gives high marks
to Kimball's East at 5800 Shel-
Imound, in Emoryville (between
Berkeley and Oakland). "It's a nice
sized place, but it still gives you
an intimate feel," Bridges says.
"Kimball's East is, I think, the
nicest physical environment for
jazz music in the Bay Area," adds
Berenson. "And they have some
««|lly high-class acts."
J You've heard of Dizzy Gillespie?
He'll be at Kimball's East from
P Tuesday, May 22 through Sunday,
May 29. Tickets are on sale now
through BASS, or at the Kimball's
box office. For the performances
on Tuesday through Thursday and
Sunday, the cover charge is $15;
Friday and Saturday performances
have an $18 cover charge.
As with most )azz clubs, cover
charges at Kimball's East vary with
the act. And, like some favorite
Bay Area jazz spots, Kimball's East
also boasts a good restaurant with
an extensive menu.
Across the bay in the City, the
menu is smaller, the surroundings
more intimate, in Kimball's West.
Located at 300 Grove Street, be
hind the Opera House, Kimball's
West is at the forefront of local
jazz entertainment.
"Kimball's in the City is a really
intimate jazz club," Bridges says.
"The sight lines are great, and the
sound is pretty good," he adds.
You can eaten the energizing
sounds of jazz vocalist Carol Sloan
tonight at 9 and 11; cover charge
is $12. Next week, Kimball's hosts
saxophonist Scott Hamilton. The
cover charge for performances on
Wednesday through Thursday is
$12; Fnday and Saturday perform
ances carry a $15 charge.
If you're in a bluesy mood, try
Slim's at 11th and Folsom in San
Francisco. "Most of the time Slim's
has blues," Bridges says. "But they
do occassionally bnng in jazz art
ists — like the World Six Quartet."
If you'll take the advice of a
sentimental gal like me, one of my
favorite blues bars is The Fifth
Amendment at 3255 Lakeshore
Avenue in Oakland It's a place
with a cool name and hot bands,
a cozy neighborhood bar that fea
tures a different blues band every
night of the week. "We never have
a cover charge," the bartender
boasts.

But they do have spillover
crowds. The bar is small, and by
the end of the evening you can't
help but be on intimate terms with
your neighbors. But the live blues
music creates its own clean, well
lit place, and when you softly
touch your lover's hand, you're
alone together in a world of sound.
Such rapturous aesthetic trans
port can also be yours in the less
earthy, more ethereal surroundings
of the Concepts Cultural Gallery
in Oakland. The CCG, at 480
Third Street in Oakland, offers a
unique entertainment environ
ment. "It's like listening to a con
cert inside of an art gallery," says
Bridges.
"It's a great place," Berenson
says. "They have more modern
players, some unusual acts." This
Friday night, for example, The
Concepts Cultural Gallery will fea
ture a saxophone/pcrcussion duo.
Cover charge is $13.
While both Bridges and Berenson
admire the innovative program
ming and interesting surroundings
at the CCG, both agree that
Yoshi's in Oakland bills the best
live jazz the Bay Area has to offer.
"It's a great place to see trios and
soloists, because of the intimacy
of the music room," says KTAZ DJ
Greg Bridges. "Yoshi's has very
good sound."
And very good performers. Re
member our friend Dizzy; He
played Yoshi's last New Year's Eve.
"Dizzy's great," Yoshi says. "We'll
have him every year, I hope."
You've heard of |azz singer Car
men Mcßae? She and her long
time trio will be playing Yoshi's
next week, from May 15 to 19.
The cover charge for the 8 and 10
p.m. sets on Tuesday through
Thursday is $15; the 9 and 11
p.m. sets on Friday and Saturday
take a $20 cover.
In the meantime, you can catch
the complex sounds of "Oregon,"
playing Yoshi's (6030 Clarcmont
Ave., Oakland) through Saturday.
If you enjoy scintillating reeds and
driving rhythms, you'll love
"Oregon." The explosive quartet
features Paul McCandless on
reeds, Ralph Towner on piano and
guitar, Trilok Gurtu on tabla and
percussion and Glen Moore on
bass.
The group's classical iazz sound
is energized by Third-World
rhythms and surreal musical
voices. In their first set on Tuesday
night, the band treated the audi
ence to a brilliant, haunting im
provisation. Towner's keyboards
called forth the eerie sounds of a
whalesong; Gurtu's percussion
relied on the rhythms of nature,
from rattling shells to the sound
of bubbling water.
In their closing number, Moore's
laughing, light-hearted "Leather
Cats," Gurtu's instruments in
clude, among other things, an in
flated party balloon held over a
microphone to capture the shriek
of escaping air.
"Oregon" is an act you shouldn't
miss. But whenever you finally
make it to Yoshi's, you won't be
disappointed
