## From the corner of 3rd and Beale Seniors cap their Stanford music career with original album 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
When they realized their Stanford mu
sical careers would not last forever, sen
iors Cliff Goldmacher and Shelley
Harrison wanted more than just mem
ories.
They wanted an album.
Now, after months of preparation and
an estimated 150 hours in the studio,
they will get their wish. "3rd and Beale"
will be released Friday in the Stanford
Bookstore and the local Tower Records.
"It's an enjoyable way to cap off a
music career at Stanford," says Goldmac
her, who plays piano, guitar, harmonica
and does some vocals on the 10-song
album. Harrison, who does most of the
album's vocals, also plays some piano
and guitar.
For the past two years, the pair from
Memphis has been playing covers of '60s
and '70s songs at campus barbecues and
happy hours, under the name "3rd &
Beale."
Famous for its blues history, Memphis'
Beale Street has been full of musicians
playing in clubs and the street since the
19205. It's also the home of Sun Records,
the first major label that helped make
Elvis the King.
"From the comer of 3rd and Beale,
you can see down the entire street,"
Goldmacher says.
Though both liked the image of
Memphis street-corner musicians
portrayed by the name, Goldmacher's
memory was more than that of a home
town pride. The summer before his
junior year, he received a ticket for going
the wrong way down the one-way street.
"We wanted a Memphis musical idea,
but not something focused on Elvis,"
Harrison says.
For the album, the duo wanted to use
their own names as well as "3rd &
Beale." Thus, the album is titled "3rd
& Beale," while the group name has
changed to "Harrison & Goldmacher."
They admit that the name's not quite
as catchy and needs to be printed in a
smaller typeface to fit on the album, but
Harrison points out that it worked for

Simon and Garfunkel. "We won't always
be 3rd & Beale, but we'll be Harrison
and Goldmacher for the rest of our lives,"
he says.
Friends since their senior year at
Memphis University School, the two
started their musical collaboration in a
seven-person high school band called Cry
Wolf. Harrison says it was "very much
of a garage band" with a total repertoire
of two songs — Kiss' "Detroit Rock City"
and Bob Seger's "Night Moves."
When they arrived at Stanford, after
missing the chance to sign up for the
freshman talent show, the pair debuted
by performing Billy Joel's "Piano Man"
at Copa Caßranner in Harrison's fresh
man residence.
During fall quarter sophomore year,
they formed a band called "The Pit Bulls"
with some other campus musicians, per
forming mostly dance music from the
19605. "We have an aversion to songs
younger than ourselves/' Goldmacher
notes.
That spring, the two played at several
restaurants while they attended the
Stanford-in-Tours program. All their
songs were played in English, which was
enough to make them appeal to French
audiences.
Returning to Stanford junior year, Har
rison bought a sound system fit for a
seven-member band, planning to reunite
with The Pit Bulls. However, after several
failed attempts at practices, the two
realized that organization was impossible
and decided to head out on their own.
"Six people can put out a lot of loud
music, but it's not as personally fulfill
ing," Harrison says, adding that their
tastes had developed a lot since their

beginnings with Cry Wolf and The Pit
Bulls.
Inspired by a musician Goldmacher
had seen perform at Vanderbilt, the two
began playing their versions of Elton
John, Eagles and James Taylor hits at
campus barbecues and happy hours.
Although their performances were not
at the more glamorous or traditional
campus parties, the pair preferred to play
their own type of music than continuing
to play in a dance band.
The studio was another change of pace
for Harrison and Goldmacher, since they
wanted to record their own original songs
and they were forced to play in a "less
spontaneous" atmosphere.
"We've both been in the studio before,
but never on this scale," says Goldmac
her, who performed on the Mendicants
album released last spring. Harrison was
a member of the group last year.
Junior Kevin Donlon, another Men
dicant, worked with them in the studio
as a co-arranger, co-engineer and co
producer.
Most of the 10 songs were originally
written independently by Harrison or
Goldmacher, who joined together to
finish the arrangements. "When I Could
Be With You," which includes brilliant
vocals by Harrison's sister, stands as a
true collaboration which started two
years ago, but was not completed until
just before the album was recorded.
Although both were influenced heavily
by the classic rock bands they grew up
with, Goldmacher says the two have
rubbed off on each other quite a bit.
"More than anything, we're each other's
influence."
The album's mostly acoustic sound
makes it easy to classify as folk rock,
but the influence of jazz, blues and
straightforward rock are apparent.
The moods vary as much as the in
fluences, as the album ranges from re
flective to jubilant to sad. Because they
were worried the album might be "too
somber," Harrison and Goldmacher in
cluded their version of Crosby, Stills and
Nash's "Southern Cross," which has al-

Long-time friends and musical collaborators Cliff Goldmacher and Shelley Harrison
round out their Stanford careers with an album of original songs to be released
tomorrow. Not your typical campus party band, the duo from Memphis has been

ways been received well at their
performances.
On "Tiger, Tiger," the duo brings
together a full band sound with
several instruments, something
they admit they could not dupli
cate in concert. Goldmacher ex
plains that the studio afforded
them the opportunity to round out
many of their original songs, some
of which had been written with
other instrumental parts in mind
that could not be covered by just
two people.
Playing original songs makes the

duet "more vulnerable," but Har
rison says performing them is
much more exciting. "It's like
you're throwing a question mark
into the audience, and they answer
it," Goldmacher explains.
Now that they have completed
an album, Harrison and Goldmac
her are not sure what happens
next. Despite the exciting possibil
ity of being signed by a major
record label, Goldmacher says they
realize a record deal is "more of a
dream than something we're going
to pursue."
The success of artists like the
Indigo Girls and Tracy Chapman
did, however, encourage them to
send copies of the album to record
companies. "We're so far behind,

'Six people can put
out a lot of loud
music, but it's not
as personally fulfill
ing. '

maybe we're ahead," Goldmacher
quips.
For now, though, Harrison and
Goldmacher are satisfied with
having a final product they can
call their own. "It's a way to thank
each other and celebrate the music

we've done," Goldmacher says.
After school ends, the two will
be taking long trips to faraway
places — Harrison to Africa and
Goldmacher to France. Both say
they will probably be performing
for the rest of their lives, but Har
rison says they both realize it may
be "a long time before we play
together again."

Harrison and Goldmacher will
hold an album release party to
morrow at Italian House, begin
ning at 8 p.m. This Sunday, they
perform from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at
the Stanford Shopping Center and
from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Spring

an album, Harrison and Goldmac
her are not sure what happens
next. Despite the exciting possibil
ity of being signed by a major
record label, Goldmacher says they
realize a record deal is "more of a
dream than something we're going
to pursue."
The success of artists like the
Indigo Girls and Tracy Chapman
did, however, encourage them to
send copies of the album to record
companies. "We're so far behind,

'Six people can put
out a lot of loud
music, but it's not
as personally fulfill
ing. '

maybe we're ahead," Goldmacher
quips.
For now, though, Harrison and
Goldmacher are satisfied with
having a final product they can
call their own. "It's a way to thank
each other and celebrate the music

we've done," Goldmacher says.
After school ends, the two will
be taking long trips to faraway
places — Harrison to Africa and
Goldmacher to France. Both say
they will probably be performing
for the rest of their lives, but Har
rison says they both realize it may
be "a long time before we play
together again."

Harrison and Goldmacher will
hold an album release party to
morrow at Italian House, begin
ning at 8 p.m. This Sunday, they
perform from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at
the Stanford Shopping Center and
from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Spring
Faire, in front of the Stanford
Bookstore.
When they realized their Stanford mu
sical careers would not last forever, sen
iors Cliff Goldmacher and Shelley
Harrison wanted more than just mem
ories.
They wanted an album.
Now, after months of preparation and
an estimated 150 hours in the studio,
they will get their wish. "3rd and Beale"
will be released Friday in the Stanford
Bookstore and the local Tower Records.
"It's an enjoyable way to cap off a
music career at Stanford," says Goldmac
her, who plays piano, guitar, harmonica
and does some vocals on the 10-song
album. Harrison, who does most of the
album's vocals, also plays some piano
and guitar.
For the past two years, the pair from
Memphis has been playing covers of '60s
and '70s songs at campus barbecues and
happy hours, under the name "3rd &
Beale."
Famous for its blues history, Memphis'
Beale Street has been full of musicians
playing in clubs and the street since the
19205. It's also the home of Sun Records,
the first major label that helped make
Elvis the King.
"From the comer of 3rd and Beale,
you can see down the entire street,"
Goldmacher says.
Though both liked the image of
Memphis street-corner musicians
portrayed by the name, Goldmacher's
memory was more than that of a home
town pride. The summer before his
junior year, he received a ticket for going
the wrong way down the one-way street.
"We wanted a Memphis musical idea,
but not something focused on Elvis,"
Harrison says.
For the album, the duo wanted to use
their own names as well as "3rd &
Beale." Thus, the album is titled "3rd
& Beale," while the group name has
changed to "Harrison & Goldmacher."
They admit that the name's not quite
as catchy and needs to be printed in a
smaller typeface to fit on the album, but
Harrison points out that it worked for

Southern Cross, Tiger Tiger,
Venice Without You

Simon and Garfunkel. "We won't always
be 3rd & Beale, but we'll be Harrison
and Goldmacher for the rest of our lives,"
he says.
Friends since their senior year at
Memphis University School, the two
started their musical collaboration in a
seven-person high school band called Cry
Wolf. Harrison says it was "very much
of a garage band" with a total repertoire
of two songs — Kiss' "Detroit Rock City"
and Bob Seger's "Night Moves."
When they arrived at Stanford, after
missing the chance to sign up for the
freshman talent show, the pair debuted
by performing Billy Joel's "Piano Man"
at Copa Caßranner in Harrison's fresh
man residence.
During fall quarter sophomore year,
they formed a band called "The Pit Bulls"
with some other campus musicians, per
forming mostly dance music from the
19605. "We have an aversion to songs
younger than ourselves/' Goldmacher
notes.
That spring, the two played at several
restaurants while they attended the
Stanford-in-Tours program. All their
songs were played in English, which was
enough to make them appeal to French
audiences.
Returning to Stanford junior year, Har
rison bought a sound system fit for a
seven-member band, planning to reunite
with The Pit Bulls. However, after several
failed attempts at practices, the two
realized that organization was impossible
and decided to head out on their own.
"Six people can put out a lot of loud
music, but it's not as personally fulfill
ing," Harrison says, adding that their
tastes had developed a lot since their

beginnings with Cry Wolf and The Pit
Bulls.
Inspired by a musician Goldmacher
had seen perform at Vanderbilt, the two
began playing their versions of Elton
John, Eagles and James Taylor hits at
campus barbecues and happy hours.
Although their performances were not
at the more glamorous or traditional
campus parties, the pair preferred to play
their own type of music than continuing
to play in a dance band.
The studio was another change of pace
for Harrison and Goldmacher, since they
wanted to record their own original songs
and they were forced to play in a "less
spontaneous" atmosphere.
"We've both been in the studio before,
but never on this scale," says Goldmac
her, who performed on the Mendicants
album released last spring. Harrison was
a member of the group last year.
Junior Kevin Donlon, another Men
dicant, worked with them in the studio
as a co-arranger, co-engineer and co
producer.
Most of the 10 songs were originally
written independently by Harrison or
Goldmacher, who joined together to
finish the arrangements. "When I Could
Be With You," which includes brilliant
vocals by Harrison's sister, stands as a
true collaboration which started two
years ago, but was not completed until
just before the album was recorded.
Although both were influenced heavily
by the classic rock bands they grew up
with, Goldmacher says the two have
rubbed off on each other quite a bit.
"More than anything, we're each other's
influence."
The album's mostly acoustic sound
makes it easy to classify as folk rock,
but the influence of jazz, blues and
straightforward rock are apparent.
The moods vary as much as the in
fluences, as the album ranges from re
flective to jubilant to sad. Because they
were worried the album might be "too
somber," Harrison and Goldmacher in
cluded their version of Crosby, Stills and
Nash's "Southern Cross," which has al-

Long-time friends and musical collaborators Cliff Goldmacher and Shelley Harrison

ways been received well at their
performances.
On "Tiger, Tiger," the duo brings
together a full band sound with
several instruments, something
they admit they could not dupli
cate in concert. Goldmacher ex
plains that the studio afforded
them the opportunity to round out
many of their original songs, some
of which had been written with
other instrumental parts in mind
that could not be covered by just
two people.
Playing original songs makes the

duet "more vulnerable," but Har
rison says performing them is
much more exciting. "It's like
you're throwing a question mark
into the audience, and they answer
it," Goldmacher explains.
