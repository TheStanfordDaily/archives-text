## Convention boasts industry's giants 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Throughout the years, comic
books have preserved a sense of
wonder; generations have thrilled
to the exploits of superheroes
that transcend time and place.
This weekend spotlights the
wonder of comic books, as the
Fourth Annual Wonder-Con
kicks off in San Francisco. The
third-largest comic convention in
the country, the Wonder-Con is
one of the premier celebrations
of comic books, animation art
and movies.
This year's convention will
spotlight appearances by some
of the biggest names in the in
dustry. Featured guests include
Art Adams, creator of
"Longshot," Norm Breyfogle, art
ist of "Detective Comics," Erik
Larsen, artist of "Amazing
Spidcrman," Dick Giordiano,
editor in chief of DC Comics,
and Tom DeFalco, editor in chief
of Marvel Comics.
But the strength of the
Wonder-Con is its wide range of
activities, which include areas
outside the comic book medium.
The three-day agenda includes
movie previews of this summer's
hottest movies, Joe Dante's
"Gremlins II," Warren Beatty's
"Dick Tracy" and Arnold
Schwarznegger's "Total Recall."
Saturday afternoon will highlight
an auction of comic art, with all
proceeds benefitting the Literacy
Volunteers of America.
In addition, the convention
schedule includes a dance with
the band "Seduction of the In
nocent," whose members include
"Coyote" creator Steve Leialoha,
as well as an all-day festival of
Japanese animation entitled
"Anime Opus."
For the serious comic book
fans, the Wonder-Con dealer
room will have over 200 dealer
tables from shops across the

country, featuring comic books,
Star Trek memorabilia, role
plaving games, baseball cards
and animation videos. And for
those of you with transportation
problems, getting Mom to drive
you is not a problem; in honor
of Mother's Day, all moms get
free admission on Sunday.

Wonder-Con tickets are $8 for
one day and $20 for three days
if purchased in advance, and
$ 10/$25 at the door. Tickets can
be purchased at comic book
stores throughout the Bay Area.
The Wonder-Con will be held at
the Oakland Convention Center,
10th and Broadway, in Oakland.
