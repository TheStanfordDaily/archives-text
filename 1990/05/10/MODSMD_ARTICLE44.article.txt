# Dancing into spring migration

True to its name, the Stanford
Dance Division's "Spring Migra
tion '90" production feels like a
journey home after a long winter.
Providing two innovative and pas
sionate hours of entertainment,
Spring Migration reminds us of the
humanness we so conscientiously
sweep under the academic carpet.
Choreographed and performed
by students and faculty of the
Dance Division, the dances in
Spring Migration are a physical ex
ploration of human interaction.
What would the world be like if
people actually expressed what
they felt? According to "IME," a
two-woman dance choreographed
by Tony Morris-Kramer, there
would be a little hair-pullmg and

"Body Talk." Superbly
choreographed and performed, this
is the best dance of the show.
Accompanied by music ranging

from Public Enemy to a tune that
sounds like a distorted nursery
rhyme, dancers Aleta Hayes, Mar
shell Jones and Tanya Leake talk
to each other insincerely: "Sorry,
I'm not home. Leave a message."
But, as the sound system murmers
toward the end of the dance, their
"bodies tell the truth."

Boone explores religion in his solo
"Adan/Remembered," a double
dance interpreting an Islamic
prayer and its modern reflection.
For an intriguing and maybe
even enlightening evening, migrate
to the Roble studio this weekend.
Especially if you think you should
be studying for a midterm instead.

"Spring Migration '90" will run
May 9-12 at the Roble Dance
Studio. Each performance, spon
sored by the Stanford Dance Di
vision, starts at 8:30 p.m.
