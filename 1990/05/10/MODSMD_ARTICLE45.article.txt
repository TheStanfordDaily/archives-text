# Columbus St. rich in Italian food

Although you won't find Colum
bus Street appearing on local maps,
this restaurant is worthy of a visit.
The original Columbus Street,
named after its location in San
Francisco, was such a success that
the owner decided to open a second
restaraunt. Transporting a part of
San Francisco's "little Italy" to Los
Altos, he opened the second res
taurant nearly a decade ago.
Columbus Street specializes in
Northern Italian cuisine. Its menu
offers diners a delicious array of
pastas, seafood, poultry and veal.
The softly-lit restaurant has
large, wine-colored booths and
tables placed spaciously through
out the room. Candles and fresh
carnations adorn each table and
contribute to the charming, ro
mantic atmosphere.
The service is very good, and
though the wait is a little long,
the help more than compensates
by being friendly and attentive to
customers.

dough bread are on the table for

the menu. There is a wide range
of seafood appetizers such as
prawns Bordelaise or escargots de
Bourgogne to begin the meal, while
for those who find seafood a bit
too fishy, a French onion soup or
romaine salad may prove a more
pleasing choice.
Dinners range from $13 to $21
and include soup, salad, ice cream,
coffee and a medley of vegetables.
Or, for a lighter meal, one can
order entrees a la carte in the more
moderate price range of $7-$ 16.50.
The restaurant offers nearly 50
choices and provides daily specials.
One of the specials of the night,
the broiled swordfish, was cooked
in a tasty picatta sauce. Though
it was a little dry, for the most
pan the fish was tender and well
prepared.
Steamed broccoli, carrots and
rice pilaf added dashes of color to
the dish and proved nice comple
ments to the fish.
And the homemade pasta was
equally delicious. The fettucine

alfredo, cooked in a creamy, butter
sauce was fairly light and did not
leave a heavy feeling in the
stomach as some fettucine does.
This enables patrons to save
room for one of the many rich
Italian desserts that Columbus
Street offers. Each one is prepared
daily in the restaurant's kitchen.
Desserts range from a fairly
healthy strawberries and cream to
a more extravagant chocolate
decadence with raspberry puree
cake.
One of the after-dinner specials,
tiramissu, is a delicious dessert
made up of light, fluffy layers of
vanilla cake and chocolate frosting
with little bits of chocolate sprin
kled on top.
Or, if one has room for a more
solid dessert, the chocolatc almond
torte offers a blend of tangy, orange
chocolate and crunchy, roasted al
monds.
Calypso, Jamaican, Italian and
Venetian coffee are available for
after-dinner drinks as well.

Columbus Street is located at 4898
El Camino Real.
