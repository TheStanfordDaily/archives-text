## Charming rebel yeller leads 'Charmed Life' 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
"Charmed Life" seemed an ironic title
for Billy Idol's latest album.
In the weeks before the release of
the album, Idol crushed his right leg
when his motorcycle collided with a
car. His co-starring role in Oliver
Stone's new movie on Jim Morrison
was in jeopardy. And rumors had it
that Idol was even battling his record
label, Chrysalis Records.
So why was Idol still sporting his
trademark cartoon sneer?
One listen to "Charmed Life" proves
that Idol does have something to smile
about. The album represents an impor
tant step in his evolution as an artist.
Without losing any intensity or passion,
Idol succeeds at surpassing his punk
rebel image, with 11 brand-new tracks.
From the opening riffs of the first
track, "The Loveless," Idol shows his
energy. Mark Younger-Smith's guitars
bring a quick, cutting edge to Idol's
vocals and lyrics of unrequited love.
Idol has definitely grown; where "Rebel
Yell" relied on fist-pumping video antics
for energy, "The Loveless" is propelled
by its own steam.
"Prodigal Blues" shows that Idol
doesn't need to moan to succeed. With
a quiet vocal style similar to the be
ginning of "White Wedding," Idol seems
to ponder the strikingly autobiographi
cal lyrics, which tell of a man gone
astrav by the temptations of excess.
"Charmed Life" even reveals a few
new sides of the developing Idol. "End
less Sleep" uses a little bit of blues and
a simple musical structure which work

well alongside Idol's vocals. "License to
Thrill" opens with Bobby McFerrin-like
background vocals alongside Idol's own.
And it's hard to imagine the rebellious
Idol of old singing the almost romantic
lyrics of "Love Unchained." A change
had to come/1 was lonely/So blue.
Clearly, this is not the old Idol; his
newfound maturity has expanded Idol's
musical and lyrical horizons.
Not that Idol has discarded his image
of the past. "Charmed Life" still shows
ample signs of his old style. "Cradle
of Love," the album's first single, is a
relatively tame track from the upcom
ing movie, "The Adventures of Ford
Fairlane." The song's formulaic style
is fitting for a movie soundtrack. Arid
the cover version of the Doors' "L.A.
Woman," though inferior in its
Idolesque style, shows the fiery energy
of his earlier days.
But the songs which display the old
Idol also show a new twist in the de
velopment of the artist. "The Right
Way" combines his old style with sur
prisingly meaty lyrics, as Idol chooses
"one love" over "the land of desire."
"Charmed Life" is a milestone in the
career of Billy Idol. Not only does the
album demonstrate Idol's mastery of
the energetic style, but it also shows
the beginnings of a transition to some
thing much more: an artist with mu
sical skill and lyrical intimacy. With
"Charmed Life," Idol definitely has rea
son to smile ... or sneer.

Looking as coherent as always, Billy Idol rocks more than the cradle of
love on his "Charmed Life" album. The sneering rocker branches beyond
his rebellious image of the past on his newest album with 11 all-new tracks.
