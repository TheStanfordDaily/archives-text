# Posed and well-groomed, Vega finds new Luka

What is initially striking about
Suzanne Vega's new album is her cover
photo.
On the cover of her self-titled 1985
debut, she lacked make-up or any sort
of hair style and yet was beautiful in
her own relaxed, simple way. In 1987,
on "Solitude Standing," she appeared
through a hazy lens, slightly made-up
and posed.
On her new album, "Days of Open
Hand," Vega appears with her sleek,
auburn-tinted hair carefully combed to
one side of her face, cut to an even
chin length, her head is tilted at just

the right angle. This new look is neither
protested nor praised, but it seems that
with her rising success she has become
more posed and less relaxed in both
her music and her image. Like her al
bum cover photos, her new music is
much more adorned and orchestrated,
but not necessarily better.
The brooding and introspective artist
makes her feelings her livelihood. Vega
is such an artist. While every artist
hopes to achieve some sort of success
and recognition, success often disrupts
the precarious arrangement of elements
that made the art great, lessening its
quality, or changing it at the very least.

success following the release of
"Solitude Standing" and the popular
singles from that album. Since her first
album in 1985, Vega has appeared to
become more image conscious, both in
person and as an artist. Non-musical
concerns may have adversely affected
her art: the need to make a popular
single, the need to have a certain public
image and her new production style
may be to blame.
On "Days of Open Hand," with

keyboardist Anton Sanko producing,
there has been a large addition of many
new timbres and textures to her sound,
including lush synthesizer
soundscapes, interesting rhythm and
percussion parts and even a string ar
rangement by Phillip Glass.
Unfortunately, these numerous musi
cal aids fail to bring Vega's music to
new heights.
The songs, with all their timbral com
plexity, are much less distinct than the
acoustic songs of her first album. Al
though there are two or three songs
that approach the quality of her old
