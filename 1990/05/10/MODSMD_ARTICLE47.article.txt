# Posed and well-groomed, Vega finds new Luka
## 
### Paul Yu 
What is initially striking about
Suzanne Vega's new album is her cover
photo.
On the cover of her self-titled 1985
debut, she lacked make-up or any sort
of hair style and yet was beautiful in
her own relaxed, simple way. In 1987,
on "Solitude Standing," she appeared
through a hazy lens, slightly made-up
and posed.
On her new album, "Days of Open
Hand," Vega appears with her sleek,
auburn-tinted hair carefully combed to
one side of her face, cut to an even
chin length, her head is tilted at just

the right angle. This new look is neither
protested nor praised, but it seems that
with her rising success she has become
more posed and less relaxed in both
her music and her image. Like her al
bum cover photos, her new music is
much more adorned and orchestrated,
but not necessarily better.
The brooding and introspective artist
makes her feelings her livelihood. Vega
is such an artist. While every artist
hopes to achieve some sort of success
and recognition, success often disrupts
the precarious arrangement of elements
that made the art great, lessening its
quality, or changing it at the very least.

success following the release of
"Solitude Standing" and the popular
singles from that album. Since her first
album in 1985, Vega has appeared to
become more image conscious, both in
person and as an artist. Non-musical
concerns may have adversely affected
her art: the need to make a popular
single, the need to have a certain public
image and her new production style
may be to blame.
On "Days of Open Hand," with

keyboardist Anton Sanko producing,
there has been a large addition of many
new timbres and textures to her sound,
including lush synthesizer
soundscapes, interesting rhythm and
percussion parts and even a string ar
rangement by Phillip Glass.
Unfortunately, these numerous musi
cal aids fail to bring Vega's music to
new heights.
The songs, with all their timbral com
plexity, are much less distinct than the
acoustic songs of her first album. Al
though there are two or three songs
that approach the quality of her old
material, the rest are unexception
al, and a few songs are plainly bad.
The first single to be released,
"Book of Dreams," is musically
tiring and lyrically trite. It is an
obvious attempt at a pop single, a
very weak one at that. "Men in a
War" is a song that sounds like a
great idea when someone describes
it to you, but ends up being con
trived. It's about the idea of men
losing limbs in a war, but still
feeling "the thing they had before."
Vega's attempt falls short.
"Those Whole Girls (Run in
Grace)" is another good idea that
fails. The song describes those
have-it-all-debutante types who
"run in packs/with bloom to
spare." Musically, it is too slow
and monotonous to evoke the et
hereal mood she asks for.
There are two outstanding songs
in this otherwise mediocre album.
"Rusted Pipe" has her lyrical
simplicity of old, and while she
plays no guitar on it (she plays a

Fairlight, a synthesizer), it works
wonderfully. On "Big Space/' Vega
sings about the essence of human
intelligence and feeling and muses
deftly. This song has one of my
favorite lines from the album:
There must be passion in the lan
guage/Between the muscle and the
brain work/There must be feeling
in the pipeline.
In her first album, threadbare
acoustic arrangements and simple
literate verse revealed the artist as
she was, sans much adornment.
This candor in presentation was
her strength; she took a risk by
exposing herself lyrically and mu
sically, and succeeded. Her next
album used the same formula; the
best songs were simple, straight
forward, yet not cliche. At her best,
Vega was direct and emotionally
intense.
Though more texturally com
plex, "Days of Open Hand" lacks
the emotional focus of her earlier
works. Even those in love with
Suzanne Vega's voice are likely to
be disappointed by the album's
flaws.
