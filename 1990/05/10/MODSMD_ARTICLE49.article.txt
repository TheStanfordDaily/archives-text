## Worse than Killer Tomatoes Orson Welles probably wouldn't even stay for popcorn 
### Chris McKenna Staff writer 
Go see the new movie "Spaced
Invaders." It was really really
really really really really really
really really really really really
really really really really really
really really really good.
Really.
No! Noooo! I won't lie to you,
even though "they" threaten ex
cruciating pain for me if I don't!
But no matter, I must warn all
of you!
Heed my warning. There is a
name to my pain, and it is
"Spaced Invaders." "Spaced In
vaders" is the accursed front
name of a tortuous process
taking place at the Old Mill Six
Theaters. Luring innocent people
to the theater under the pretense
that they will see a movie, "they"
have something else in store for
the unsuspecting prey, some
thing so diabolically cruel and
painful that I can hardly speak
of it.
But speak of it I must, no
matter how painful it is! And
how do I know so much, you
ask? Come closer. Closer. How
do I know so much? Because I
am one of the "Spaced Invaders"
victims.

I bought a ticket and entered
the theater. I should have sus
pected that something was wrong
by the way the usher acted. He
had been nice. Too nice. And he
didn't have a skin problem.
Unfortunately, I didn't suspect
anything, and so I naively walked
into the second theater on the
left, as I had been directed to do
so by the "agent of evil." Above
the arch of the doorway there
read: "Abandon Hope All Ye Who
Enter Here". That should have
clued me in, but it didn't. Hey,
I'm no English major.
I sat down in the ninth row,
which soon became my own
ninth circle of Hell. The lights
went down and . .. and . .. and
. . . the horror, the horror. Vi
sions appeared on the screen that
closely resembled typical movie
credits, title, etc. Then the fien
dish festivities began!
Agents of the Wicked One ap
peared on the screen in the form
of five wisecracking Martians.
They spoke in an unbearable lan
guage which consisted of "Dude,"
"Awesome," and the like. And

as if that wasn't bad enough, one
wore an L.A. Lakers T-shirt and
did a tormenting impersonation
of Jack Nicholson.
It got worse, much worse. But
most of it is just a tortuous blur
now.
The five Martians misinterpret
a Halloween rebroadcast of Or
son Welles "War of the Worlds"
as a call to invade earth. They
land in Big Bean, 111., where an
old farmer is about to lose his
farm to an evil banker or some
thing. Wreaking havoc and
agonizing one-liners on the town,
the five aliens are befriended by
a lonely girl whose mother re
cently died.
But none of that is important!
You see, as these images were
displayed in front of me, some
thing strange was happening. My
head was growing lighter, and I
felt a numbness in my skull.
This so-called "movie" was mel
ting my brain! And that's exactly
what "they" want — a submis
sive bunch of idiots. I survived
with a minutiae of my brain still
intact. But others weren't so
lucky. So beware!
Beware! Don't fall into their
wicked trap! Oh no! Here They
come! Oh, the inhumanity!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Now here s a plot. These really hip-looking aliens — "confused Martians" according to the press
release — Intercept signals from a re-broadcast of Orson Welles* "War of the Worlds" and think
their leaders forgot to mention that they were planning an attack on Earth. A ratinq of "1" is
even too much.
