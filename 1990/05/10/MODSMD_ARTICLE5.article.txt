### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Senior University officials tried to allay stu
dent fears and uncertainties about the effects
of the budget "repositioning" process on stu
dent life in a question-and-answer session last
night.
The session featured a panel of four offi
cials: Provost James Rosse, Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Carolyn Lougee,
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons and
Vice President for Administrative Resources
Su Schaffer. The discussion was moderated
by Margo Horn, director of Innovative Aca
demic Courses.
Several students in the audience of about
25 expressed concern about the effect of the

proposed cuts on dorm life and on the Office
of Residential Education.
In contrast with earlier predictions of
sweeping cutbacks in Res Ed, Lyons said it
is likely that the number of resident assistants
and resident fellows will not be cut — at least
not as severely as originally feared.
In addition, because Res Ed was able to
obtain some additional funding from Academic
Information Resources, residence computer
clusters will probably not be eliminated, Lyons
said. However, future development of the res
idential computing program, including upgrad
ing computers, will probably be limited.
In order to further cut costs in the Office
of Residential Affairs, some of the functions
of the Housing Center may be simplified,
giving up some of the flexibility now in the

system, Lyons added.
Another question focused on the proposed
elimination of the overseas campus in Tours.
In response, Lougee said Overseas Studies is
looking at other ways to cut its budget besides
closing Tours.
However, "We're going to have to make
some cuts that we don't want to make," she
said.
Overseas Studies Director Tom Heller, who
also attended the discussion, noted that while
the Tours program has many benefits, the
proposed expansion of the program in Paris
will provide interesting opportunities which
will meet the needs of many students.
Rosse also gave some general background
about the repositioning process as a whole,
explaining the need to streamline.
