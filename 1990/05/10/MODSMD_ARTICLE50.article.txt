# Darkside's tales better left untold
## 
### Chris McKenna Staff writer 
Twenty-two tons of blood! Stephen King, the
prolific author of horror! George Romero, director of
"Night of the Living Dead"! Michael McDowell,
creator of "Beetlejuice"! Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that
guy who created Sherlock Holmes!
These four "masters of horror," each adding his
own horrific vision of monsters and mayhem, have
created one ferocious film of freaks and frights, con
sisting of four ghoulishly and ghastly tales. Still, all
of these ingredients add up to one mediocre movie.
"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie" was spawned
from the syndicated television program of the same
name. The small screen show features half-hour
stories set in a darker reality, a supernatural world
where things that go bump in the night shouldn't
be ignored. Continuing this tradition of horror, the
movie is a compilation of four tales whose creators
felt — due to the stories' scope, subject matter and
required effects — were better suited for the big screen.
Those who have seen the film "Creepshow" will
be familiar with the structure of "Tales from the
Darkside," which contains an ongoing story inter
spersed with three other self-contained stories. The
opening tale is called a "wraparound story," and that
is exactly the role it plays, commencing and ending
the film while also introducing the enveloped tales.
This first "tale" stars Deborah Harry (lead singer
of Blondie) as a woman just returned from the su
permarket who is making preparations for a dinner
party in which Timmy, the little boy she is holding
captive in her dungeon, will be the main course. As

Timmy attempts to postpone his comestible fate by
reading from the book, "Tales from the Darkside,"
each tale unfolds on the screen. '
The first is a supernatural story of trickery and
revenge, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "Lot
249." It stars Christian ("Heathers") Slater as a college
student who discovers that Edward, the strange guy
from downstairs, has a rather dangerous interest in
ancient relics.
"Cat from Hell," derived from a short story by
Stephen King, features a feline with a homicidal
vengeance, graphically demonstrating that one should
not tamper with Mother Nature (unless one wants
one's entrails ripped out). The last tale from the
darkside, "Lover's Vow," attempts to be a tragic love
story of a forsaken promise.
"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie" is a well
directed, well-cast thriller that has one debilitating
problem: it is not thrilling in the least. The fault,
lies with the writing which is uninspired and bland.
The stories aim for wry, dark humor, but dismally
strikes off the mark.
Instead the "twist," that moment which the preced
ing action of the tale has purposefully set up in order
to be ironic, turns out to be either predictable or a
flimsy facade for showing off gory special effects. All
in all, this movie is worth neither your time nor
your $6.50.
