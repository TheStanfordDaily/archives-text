Pretty Woman
Richard Gere's and Julia Roberts' enticing
performances definitely make this Cinderella
story heart-warming. "Pretty Woman" goes for
your heart strings and tugs fairly hard. As ro
mantic comedies go this one is a crowd pleaser.
The second act of Gere's return to leading-man
status, this film has already pulled down $90.6
million in ticket sales and appears to have
enough momentum to break the $100 million
mark in a couple of weeks.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
If ticket sales were the soul indicator of the
quality of a film, then "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" would unquestionably be the best film
of the year. With $104.8 million in gross receipts,
it is the most successful film released thus far
in 1990. An interesting aspect of "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles" is that it is live action.
Go see the movie and remind yourself of how
great you thought "Star Wars" was when you
were a kid.
My Left Foot
The Irish film "My Left Foot" offers an ex
cellent alternative to the studio fare currently
out. Both entertaining and moving, the film
relates the story of disabled Irish artist Christy
Brown. Daniel Day-Lewis received the Best Ac
tor Oscar for his portrayal of Brown, and Brenda
Fricker received the Best Supporting Actress
Oscar for her role as Christy's mother.
