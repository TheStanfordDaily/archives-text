# With bargaining behind, Webb workers spend time in the classroom
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
No longer occupied by the past year's
tense discussions over contract disputes,
the community dining room at Webb
Ranch is now filled with student desks,
a chalkboard and 16 workers who want
to learn English.
As senior Cliff Rachlin teaches the les
son, a crowing rooster occasionally
punctuates his speech.
Rachlin is one of the workers' keys to
bilingual success as one of four Stanford
tutors teaching English to workers
through the Stanford Literacy Project.
A highly energetic teacher, Rachlin
waves his hands back and forth,

blindfolds the students' eyes or pulls vis
ual aids out of his bag of learning tricks.
He even crawls on the ground to teach
a word or hams it up in short role-playing
games.
Rachlin says the workers have been
asking for the language class for a few
years. As a resident of Casa Zapata and
a Barrio Assistance tutor, Rachlin ex
posed himself to the needs of Spanish
speakers and started learning the
language.
He and the other instructors usually
start the orally based class by mentioning
a concept with which the workers may
not be familiar. "If they don't know (the
conceptl, that's fine," he says. The in
structors also teach the workers words

and then give them practice in the ap
plication of the words.
Students come to class with slightly
differing exposure to English. Sometimes,
Rachlin says, they bring in different
phrases and expressions they have heard
and picked up.
Sometimes using the better students
as examples, the instructors encourage
the students to learn from each other.
"The instructors try to foster an envi
ronment in which the workers do not get
frustrated," Rachlin says. In his class,
there are no wrong answers — and errors
are acceptable.
In most classes, students who miss
questions are forgotten, he says. But with
the workers, everyone gets a chance to

answer a question correctly. "They don't
leave without getting one right," Rachlin
says.
The instructors try to teach the
workers what the workers want to learn.
Unfortunately, he says, "most textbooks
do not take into consideration the stu
dent."
The teachers also stay in touch with

the knowledge of the workers, he says.
Using Spanish only when absolutely
necessary — such as the clarification of
a complex thought — Rachlin centers
each session around a certain theme. In
the past, workers have learned practical
skills about doctors, hospitals or buying
food in stores.
The class is planning a field trip to a
McDonald's to employ its new English
skills. However, Rachlin laughs, "In Cal
ifornia, it's hard to find a McDonald's
without Spanish-speaking workers."
Rachlin acknowledges that the instruc
tors cannot familiarize the workers with
all the forms of English. But the workers
do learn how to gain access to
greater knowledge of English.
"They learn how to communi
cate," he says.
Increased skill in communica
tion is one of a number of motives
the workers mention for taking
the class. Some want to learn Eng
lish to be "more mobile" in life
outside the ranch. Others want
to get a better job and go to school.
The workers say they also want
to learn English for "daily things"
and for "freedom."
One worker, Rachlin says, is
from Tijuana, Mexico. When he
came into the United States he
felt lost, and people told him,
"This is America, you have to
speak English here."
Many of the students are
related. In one class session about
the family, student Maria Rend6n
used her family tree to describe
English words for relatives. This
familial bond increases the unity
of the group, Rachlin says.
Rachlin says he will probably
continue the Webb Ranch class
this summer, along with another
class in East Palo Alto. Rachlin
is eager to work with the students,
who are just as anxious to learn
English.
He says,"The workers just
want to be equal participants in
American life."
