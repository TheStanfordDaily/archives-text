# Linguistic minorities faring 'Very poorly' in school, experts say

### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Linguistic minorities are "doing very poorly" in
school, and the federal government must do more
to support bilingual education, said three bilingual
education specialists in a Stanford discussion yes
terday.
The current governmental attitude toward
children who are native foreign language speakers,
said senior Cliff Rachlin, is, "once the disease [of
the native language] is fixed, the kids have to be
sent back into regular classes."
Rachlin, who is a Barrio Assistance tutor and
bilingual teacher of Spanish, told a small group at
Casa Zapata that administrators "play games" with
foreign language speakers.
Rachlin, graduate student Felix Cuevas and lawyer
David Giles supported a "double enrichment" or
"immersion" program in which both English
speakers and non-English speakers learn each
others' languages. Cuevas said the program is
gaining popularity in California.
However, Rachlin said, many bilingual programs
emphasize the importance of English at the expense
of the minority language.
Transitional programs gradually eliminate use of
the minority language and attempt to integrate
students into the English curriculum, he said. In
sheltered English programs, teachers instruct stu
dents with slow English speech and use of visual
aids.
Rachlin said these programs often discriminate
against talented students.
