Measures to prevent overlap in
chemical ordering and track
chemical disposal were among
new proposals of the Health and
Safety Committee made last night
in its annual public meeting.
In response to questions from
the audience, members of the
committee said it aims to track
chemicals coming into the Uni
versity from "cradle to grave."
Also, Palo Alto Fire Chief
Robert Wall called on the com
mittee to distribute up-to-date in
formation on University health

and safety to the public in light
of past discoveries of air and water
contamination in the surrounding
area.
Because the University
produced 240,000 pounds of
chemical waste this year, the com
mittee proposed to attempt to
raise the percentage of chemicals
recycled. In particular, retrieving
silver waste from the photography
labs would raise the percent of
chemicals recycled — currently 16
percent.
Addressing the issue of as
bestos, Tom Mcßride, director of
Environmental Health and Safety,
cited "new scientific opinion" and

said "the safest bet is to leave it."
The age of some University struc
tures makes it a "complex task
to survey and assess" asbestos
problems, according to Mcßride.
Also on the committee's
drawing board is a 40-foot addi
tion to the incinerator exhaust
stack at the Environmental Safety
Facility.
The proposal is a response to
a May 1989 University
commissioned study which found
"reintrainment of emissions from
the incinerator stack and various
vents." However, according to
Mcßride, the current level of emis
sions is "not above regulation

levels."
The committee also presented
statistics about University waste
disposal. Last year, the University
produced two million to four mil
lion pounds of biological waste,
including contaminated syringes
and blood. Most of it was burned
in University incinerators.
"We're not sending it into some
one else's back yard to dispose of.
We're taking care of it in our
own," said Mcßride.
Some 369,000 pounds of chemi
cal wastes were produced at Stan
ford last year as well. All of it
was taken to an off-campus dis
posal site.
