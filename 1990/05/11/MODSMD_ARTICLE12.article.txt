# Powwow expected to draw close to 20,000

Native American students are
gearing up for this weekend's
Stanford powwow, an event that,
with 20,000 attending, is one of
the largest Native American gath
erings on the West Coast.
The 19th annual powwow
begins tonight at 7 p.m. and lasts
all weekend. Sponsored by the
Stanford American Indian Organ
ization, the powwow is the largest
multicultural event on campus,
the largest run by a student group
and, with the exception of athletic
events and commencement, the

largest overall.
Members of dozens of tribes
from the United States and
Canada are expected to come to
the powwow, which is rivalled in
size only by powwows in Los An
geles and Washington state.
The intramural soccer fields
next to Stanford Stadium will be
covered with more than 400
lavishly dressed dancers, who are
the focus of the powwow.
The dancers will compete in
eight categories, including Fancy
Shawl, Traditional and Grass
dance. The dances vary in style,
music and costuming.

According to senior Tracey
Leßeau, a Cheyenne River Sioux
who has danced in many pow
wows, "The dance is a workout."
Leßeau, who will dance this week
end, said the dances last three to
five minutes apiece. The dancers
usually perform two or three
songs in a row.
In addition to the contests, 90
vendors will run booths featuring
arts and crafts, information and
authentic Native American food.
Jim Larimore, associate dean of
student affairs, said many people
have asked, "How can Stanford
afford to have a $43,000 pow
wow?"

The powwow budget relies little
on University funds, said
Larimore, the resident fellow of
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, the Native
American theme house formerly
known as Lathrop House. In
stead, the majority of the money
will come from vendor sales.
Larimore also noted that
$14,000 goes back to the Univer
sity to pay for police, maintenance
and supplies.
Though the powwow has been
organized by only 12 students, all
120 Native American students will
probably help in the preparation,
he said.
