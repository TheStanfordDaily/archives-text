# Bernard Lewis details 'a view from the East'

The primary source of fun
damentalist Muslims' resent
ment of the United States is
their failure to achieve Western
ideals, according to Bernard
Lewis, a Princeton University
historian.
Islamic leaders fear the
temptations of U.S. con
sumerism and secularism that
lure Muslims away from their
religious creed, he added.
To a packed crowd at Kresge
Auditorium last night, Lewis
delivered the 19th annual Jef
ferson Lecture in the Human
ities, "Western Civilization: A
View from the East," which ex
plored the historic conflict be
tween the Islamic and Western
worlds which continues to this
day.
The Jefferson Lecture is the
highest honor conferred by the
federal government for distin
guished intellectual achieve
ment in the humanities.
In reaction to the influx of
Western ideals, fundamentalist
Islamic leaders have called for
a return to the old ways of the
East, according to Lewis.
Lewis identified the contrast
ing American ideal of separa

tion of church and state and
the fundamentalist Muslim
belief in the combination of the
two as one of the causes of the
conflict.
Lewis traced the conflict
from the time of Mohammed
to the present day with ample
historical evidence.
In modern times, American
racism, sexism and imperialism
exacerbated the conflict, he
said.
The United States "must
plead guilty (to these charges),
not as the worst offenders but
as members of the human
race," said Lewis.
He proceeded to cite exam
ples of how the Eastern world
also exhibited racism, sexism
and imperialism.
"We must not be provoked
into an equally irrational reac
tion" toward the Muslims as
they feel toward the United
States, said Lewis.
Lewis was born in Britain,
spent much of his academic
career in England, and moved
to Princeton in 1974.
The lecture was sponsored
by the National Endowment for
the Humanities and hosted by
the Hoover Institution.
