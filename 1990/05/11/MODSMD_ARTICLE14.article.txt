# Community carnival to offer fun for children and volunteers
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Jugglers, clowns and magicians frolic
among the masses of fun-seekers. Amid
the chaos, youngsters scramble around
in search of good times.
This will be a typical scene at the Sixth
Annual Stanford Community Carnival,
which will be held tomorrow on Wilbur
Field from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The main purpose of the carnival is to
provide students the chance to interact
with children from East Palo Alto, Palo
Alto and the surrounding area, according
to sophomore Stacey Beaulieu, director
of this year's carnival.

Directed entirely by student volunteers,
the event will also be a fund-raiser for
Upward Bound and the Stanford Volun
teer Network.
Each year, the carnival raises an
average of $3,000 for charity organiza
tions. The carnival costs about $11,000,
which goes toward booth rentals, trans
portation and publicity.
Without donations from 52 dorms and
student organizations and more than 40
local businesses, the carnival could not
be held, according to Beaulieu.
The children, ranging in age from 4 to
12, will come from more than 60 public
and private day-care centers, elementary
schools and recreation centers.

At the carnival, each child will receive
15 free tickets for games. Most booths
require one ticket.
The games will span the usual range
of carnival madness, from balloon
shaving to sponge tossing.
However, several new activities will
debut tomorrow. Kairos House will spon
sor a headband-making booth, Mirlo
House will make "shrinky-dinks" and
Rainbow Records will host a "Name That
Tune" game. The Kappa Sigma fraternity
will feature the teddy bear toss, Madera
House will boast a tie-dye T-shirt booth
and Roble Hall has created a "Wheel of
Comic Books" for the carnival.
Another new twist this year will be a

"Twister" competition among the resi
dences, to be held at 1:30 p.m.
KZSU will provide a sound system, and
Counterpoint, Kuumba, the Mendicants,
Ballet Folklorico and other performing
groups will take the stage throughout
the day.
For the first time, this year graduate
students will sponsor a booth: Residents
of the Rains Houses will make snow
cones.
Also, this year's carnival has garnered
more ofT-campus sponsorship than in pre
vious years, according to Beaulieu. "The
food will also be much better this year,"
she promised.
Despite two complications — the m^jor

beverage supplier canceled on short
notice, as did one of the charter buses
— the carnival will go on as scheduled.
Beaulieu said she hopes for a large,
enthusiastic turnout of student volun
teers Saturday.
Beaulieu encourages students to stop
by, look around and pitch in. Students
can be clowns and magicians or help set
up and clean up. She said the carnival
especially needs "big buddies" to take the
youngsters around the carnival grounds.
Chaperones on the buses and security
personnel are also in demand.
Two volunteer tables will be open all
day for students to sign up for the various
positions.
