Pilgrims killed in plane crash
TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) - A
plane carrying pilgrims to see Pope John Paul
II crashed yesterday and killed at least 27 of
the 38 people on board, including a bishop
and some government officials, authorities
said.
The crash was near the military airport of
the southeastern city of Tuxtla Gutierrez,
where the pope is to visit today.
The plane went down at about 8:55 a.m.,
just under two miles from the airport runway
The cause of the crash was not immediately
known. The weather appeared to be clear on
television footage from the scene, but the area
is known for fog.
The badly charred wreck lay scattered in a
field, its propellers twisted. Soldiers sur
rounded it, keeping back several hundred on
lookers. Despite the security, there was some
looting of luggage.
Lebanese blast away
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Rival Christian
forces under Gen. Michel Aoun and militia
Chieftain Samir Geagea skirmished intermit
tently with machine guns and mortars in east
Beirut yesterday, day 101 of their showdown.
Police reported no casualties, and the rela
tive lull gave the exhausted population a
chance to emerge from shelters and take stock
of damage from the savage shelling.
The guns generally fell silent by midnight
Wednesday, a police spokesman said. But
snipers manning roof-top firing nests kept
most roads blocked in east Beirut and the
Christian enclave northeast of the city.
The Aoun-Geagea fight for dominance of
the 310-square-mile Christian enclave has
killed 976 people and wounded 2,564 since
Jan. 30, according to police count.
Korean students riot again
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Radical stu
dents and dissidents fought riot police in street
battles in Seoul and other cities yesterday for
the second day, despite a government warning
against violence.
Riot police moved swiftly to disperse the
groups of 200 to 500 students who chanted
"Down with President Roh Tae-woo!" during
scattered protests in the capital.
Thousands of riot police were deployed in
downtown areas. They tightened street checks
and took away young pedestrians suspected of
participating in the clashes.
Roh took office in 1988 after winning the
country's first direct presidential elections in
16 years. But his popularity has been declining.
Dissidents say the United States was behind
a plot by government conservatives to prolong
their power through the merger.
Mt. Everest is getting messy
KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) - Traffic jams
and landfills have come to Mount Everest, the
roof of the world.
A growing number of nature lovers, and the
flags, clothes and oxygen tanks they leave be
hind, are turning parts of the majestic moun
tain into a garbage dump. And a crowded one
at that.
A long line of climbers snaked near Everest's
peak yesterday, vying for elbow room on the
top. Americans, New Zealanders, Swiss,
Soviets, Chinese and Australians queued up
to reach the 29,028-foot summit.
Taiwanese barbers offer sex
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — If you step off the
plane needing a trim and shave, don't go into
that neon-lit barbershop with a facade resem
bling the Great Pyramid.
Hundreds of such gaudy establishments line
the streets of Taipei. They deal primarily in
sex, not the tonsorial arts.
Prostitution is flourishing in Taiwan, like
the economy.
"Taipei is a city of lust," City Councilman
Yen Chin-fu said. "Girlie restaurants and bars
are everywhere, even in residential and school
areas. Some are next to police stations."
