# Millions of Americans addicted to cocaine
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A study in
dicating there are nearly 2.2 million
hard-core cocaine addicts in the United
States proves the administration has
adopted the wrong strategy in the drug
war, the chair of the Senate Judiciary
Committee said yesterday.
"This news is as alarming as it is

tragic," Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.,
said at a news conference.
Biden released a report prepared by
his committee that indicated the num
ber of hard-core addicts was more than
double an earlier estimate by the Na
tional Institute of Drug Abuse.
William Bennett, director of the Of-

'This news is as alarming as it is tragic Our
consciences demand that we act, our pocketbooks
command that we do so and our safety demands
that it be done immediately.'
â€” Sen. Joseph Biden

fice of National Drug Control Policy,
called Biden's statement "ridiculous"
and said it was designed to provide
ammunition for next fall's congres
sional elections.
The administration, Bennett said,
has assumed from the outset of the
drug war that there are about 4 million
hard-core addicts and that the national
drug strategy is working.
Nearly one of every 100 Americans
is a weekly cocaine user, and some
areas of the United States have
"extraordinarily high concentrations"
of addicts, according to the report. The
study defined a hard-core user as
someone who uses cocaine once a
week.
One of every 40 people in New York
state uses cocaine at least once a week,
the study said. The nation's capital
has the highest per capita rate, 32.9
hard-core users among every 1,000
Washington residents, according to the
report.
Biden said an an earlier estimate of
862,000 U.S. addicts made by the Na
tional Institute of Drug Abuse was far
too low.
The Judiciary Committee findings,
prepared under the supervision of
Mark A.R. Kleiman of the Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard, un
derscored a dispute between Biden and
a number of other lawmakers and the
administration about whether to aim
the thrust of the drug war against
hard-core or casual users.
Biden has said hard-core users
should be the primary target, while
Bennett has advocated efforts directed
mainly at stemming casual cocaine
use.
"Our consciences demand that we
act, our pocketbooks command that
we do so and our safety demands that
it be done immediately," Biden said,
unveiling a $3 billion drug-fighting
plan that includes stepped-up research
to find new treatments and doubling

crime-fighting grants to $900 million
a year.
Dr. Edgar Adams of the National
Institute of Drug Abuse described the
37-page report, "Hard-Core Cocaine
Addicts: Measuring and Fighting the
Epidemic," as "a good attempt to look
at what is a very complex problem."
Adams cautioned that it might be
hard to figure the margin of error in
the Senate figures, but praised the
study because it "restates the fact that
drug abuse is a very serious problem."
The report said that only one out
of 10 hard-core addicts receives drug
treatment and that most who are ar
rested are quickly back out on the
streets.
Bennett said in a telephone inter
view that he saw no way in which the
report contributed to the war against
drugs and was scornful of its claim
that the government had under
counted.
"This is ridiculous," Bennett said.
"What official estimate is he talking
about? There is no official estimate.
In the national drug control strategy
we use a number larger than the one
he is using. We use 4 million."
Adams said homeless invididuals
were not counted in the the NIDA
study.
He said the institute maintained a
95 percent confidence level for its es
timate of 862,000 hard-core addicts in
households.
The committee report said 1.5 mil
lion hard-core cocaine addicts were ar
rested annually and represent about
20 percent of arrestees nationwide.
"This suggests that cocaine is a
major cause of crime in the United
States," it said.
The report estimated that New York
state had the most hard-core addicts,
434,000, followed by California,
325,000; Texas, 144,000; Illinois,
142,000; and Florida, 93,000.

Mayor Marion Barry yesterday. Barry was charged with six additional
misdemeanor drug crimes. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Joseph Biden released
