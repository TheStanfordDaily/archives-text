Runoffs under fire in Ga.
ATLANTA (AP) — A lawsuit to
abolish runoff elections might help
Andrew Young become Georgia's first
black governor, but then again it
might be the "kiss of death," political
analysts say.
Twenty-seven legislators, civil
rights leaders and others filed the
federal lawsuit to end runoffs in most
statewide and regional elections.
They said Wednesday its aim is to
boost black voting power, not help
Young's campaign.
"This is not about candidates who
are running this time," said state
Rep. Billy McKinney.
Georgia is one of nine states that
require candidates to win more than
50 percent of the vote in the primary
or else face a runoff.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, con
tends runoffs violate the 1965 Voting
Rights Act by diluting black voting
strength.
It wasn't known whether the law

suit would be settled before the July
17 primaries. No hearing was imme
diately scheduled.
Young, former Atlanta mayor and
U.N. ambassador, is the leading can
didate for the Democratic primary,
but recent polls give him only about
30 percent of the vote.
Georgia's population is an esti
mated 27 percent black.
Pollster Claibourne Darden called
the lawsuit "the closest thing to the
kiss of death to the state Democratic
Party than anything they could do,"
and said it would boost the chances
of Johnny Isakson, the Republican
front-runner.
Georgia has not had a GOP gover
nor since Reconstruction.
Mohawks raided
ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVA
TION, N.Y. (AP) — Police launched
an early morning raid today on the
Canadian side of this troubled res
ervation, arresting 21 people on

weapons and drug charges and con
fiscating about $1 million in drugs.
The raid by 100 officers from three
Canadian police forces culminated a
14-month investigation; hundreds of
police officers stationed on the res
ervation because of recent violence
helped in making the arrests, accord
ing to Peter West, a spokesperson for
the Ontario Provincial Police.
Police had planned to make the
raid earlier, but were "delayed by the
unrest on the reserve," West said.
The 'Diceman' protested
NEW YORK (AP) - So this guy,
Andrew Dice Clay, stand-up com
edian, right? His jokes are filthy, his
mouth is foul and some cast members
of this week's "Saturday Night Live"
are refusing to work with him. Dice,
is this an attitude, or what?
The current controversy began
when Nora Dunn, a cast member on
"Saturday Night Live" since the '85-
86 season, refused to perform on this

week's show because she considers
Clay's comedy degrading and repul
sive.
Pop singer Sinead O'Conner also
bowed off the show after her publicist
was alerted by the National Organ
ization for Women and the singer
reviewed tapes of Clay's act.
Barry back in court
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal
prosecutors widened the criminal
case against Mayor Marion Barry
yesterday, obtaining a new indict
ment that charges him with six ad
ditional misdemeanor drug crimes.
Barry refused to comment on his
legal status, but said his new legal
troubles will not affect his ability to
govern.
"I'm not looking for votes," Barry
said during an appearance at a senior
citizen's center. "I'm just being an
elected official trying to do my job
and trying to make sure the govern
ment goes to the people."
