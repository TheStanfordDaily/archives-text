## Student seating section shifted 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
At least it's not the end zone.
In an attempt to make foot
ball games "happier for every
one," Athletic Director Andy
Geiger has decided to move the
student section at Stanford Sta
dium for the 1990 season. But
the switch will move many stu
dents a little further from the
choice seats near the 50-yard
line.
The old student section occu
pied only the seats closest to
the field, with the seats directly
behind them sold to the public.
This rectangular section

stretched from past the 50-yard
line to beyond the east end zone.
The new arrangement
reserves a square-shaped sec
tion for students, reaching up
to within three rows of the top
of the stadium. However, these
seats begin at the 35-yard line
and end at the east end zone.
According to Geiger, the Ath
letics Department decided dur
ing the 1989 football season to
move the section because of
staff concerns about "the fights
and unhappiness between the
student section and the public
section."
Geiger said some students sit
ting in the lower section refused

to sit down, blocking other spec
tators' views and causing dis
turbances.
Geiger emphasized that, de
spite rumors to the contrary,
the new student section is not
in the end zone. "They're good
seats, just fine seats," he said,
pointing out that seats near the
top of the stadium are usually
more popular. "The change is
not earthshaking. It will make
it happier for everyone."
Student reaction to the
change was mixed.
Many students recognized the
problem from last year and saw
the move as generally positive.
Sophomore Eric Lassen, who
recalled arguments between the
student and public sections, said,
"It's a shame that we've been
moved back, but if there have
been problems in the past, OK."
He said he liked the idea of
students sitting in a more compact
"united block," particularly with
the new cheerleaders. However,
Lassen said he wished the new
section were closer to the 50-yard
line.
Senior Jeff Kritzer said, "Most
of the students go to the games
for social reasons and not neces
sarily to watch the game. The ex
tra unity of a block ... is
excellent."
Other students expressed
reservations and even anger about
the change. Freshman Joel Miller
complained, "At most schools, the
student sections are on the 50-

yard line. I don't like it at all."
Sophomore Annie Hernandez
said, "I still like the old configu
ration. When we're more spread
out, we take up more area and
we're closer to the action. ... It's
the students who make the most
noise."
The new section is next to the
section reserved for the visiting
team's fans, which might cause
problems at games against
rival teams, such as UC-Berkeley.
Each year, Stanford reserves
8,000 seats for students. Last
year, ticket sales averaged about
4,700 per game.
