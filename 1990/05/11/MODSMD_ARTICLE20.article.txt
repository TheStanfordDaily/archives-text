## Time to turn it off

SHOWER WITH a friend.
You could save almost 50
gallons of water if you do.
And if you're using a low-flow
shower head, those savings could
be doubled.
Drought conditions in the Bay
Area this year will force Stanford
to reduce its annual one-billion
gallon water usage by 25 percent
of its 1987 pre-drought usage.
That's a lot of water.
Stanford has already instituted
programs to save water, including
not filling Lake Lagunita and re
ducing plant-watering levels.
And last year, when drought con
ditions also led to conservation, the
Housing Energy Conservation Cen
ter instituted measures to reduce
water use in dormitories. The cen
ter oversaw the installation of low
flow shower heads, toilet dams and
aerators on sink faucets, all of
which will save thousands of gal
lons of water each year.

According to Julie Coopet of the
center, the University has pretty
much identified and instituted all
of the physical ways to conserve
water in dormitories. The rest is
up to individuals.
California residents have grown
up with and learned to accept
drought conditions. While at Stan
ford, we are all California resi
dents, and water conservation is
everyone's responsibility.
Simply turning off the water
each time you brush your teeth,
shave or wash the dishes can save
dozens of gallons.
While we are off to a good start,
the University should investigate
still more ways we can save water.
Why, for instance, do the lawn
sprinklers still water the basket
ball courts between Stern and Wil
bur Halls? The courts, which were
installed after the sprinkler sys
tem, are not getting any greener.
