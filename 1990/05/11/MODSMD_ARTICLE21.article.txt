# Spring diversions
## 
### 
THERE ARE things that are
worthwhile beyond mid
terms, papers, parties and
spring diversions.
Groups such as Children Now,
Project Motivation, Barrio Assis
tance, Ravenswood Tutoring Proj
ect and the Stanford Asian Youth
Project, to name a few, are cer
tainly included in the category of
worthwhile activities.
Through these groups, students
bring kids to the Stanford campus,
sharing with them a sample of col
lege life and encouraging them to
attend college.
This Saturday's Community
Carnival is a prime example of an
up-and-coming event that serves
the community by serving kids.
Anyone can help, whether by or
ganizing a booth or talking to the

kids. Volunteers are needed to play
a variety of roles. It's guaranteed
to be fun.
But the benefits of community
service don't end with students
giving back to the community. One
of the most important aspects of
community service is the learning
that Stanford students themselves
experience.
While living on the Stanford
campus, it is easy to become iso
lated from the greater community.
The everyday conditions of low
income areas such as East Palo
Alto are a far cry from the atmos
phere of one of the wealthiest col
leges in the country.
So amidst the windsurfing and
parties, consider taking a few more
hours off for community service
work.
