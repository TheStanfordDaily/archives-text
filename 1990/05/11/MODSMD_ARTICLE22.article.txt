Democratic philosophy requires closer examination

IT'S MY FAULT, and now I under
stand this fact. Actually, everyone
who finds fault with the ASSU
decisions is mistaken, for some stu
dents' definitions of democratic govern
ment are simply not in accordance
with those recognized by many Stan
ford University senators.
Naively, I initially assumed that
democratic government is created in
order that conflicting ideas can be
expressed in an open arena. In this
scenario, the open forum is available to
the people, and even encouraged, with
the hopes of discovering the policies
that are most correct or just.
Although these abstract thoughts can
never be wholly conceptualized, I
figured that the goal itself would
propel the activities striving toward it.
But I quickly discovered that the
ASSU Senate is not concerned with
hearing various ideas and utilizing
them to arrive at the most rational

decision. Closed meetings, the rejection
of the implementation of a judiciary
committee and the quick defeat of
proposals which seem to run counter
to the solidified stance of the ASSU
are all examples of how the govern
ment has little concern for arriving at
what is most just.
Having freed myself from this
idealistic delusion, I more realistically
reasoned that the ASSU government is
actually organized to represent the
"will of the people." In other words, I
assumed that because the quest for
truth was a bit too reminiscent of
Plato (What did he know about gov
ernment, anyway?), the government at
Stanford would endeavor to implement
the wants of the people, regardless of
how these wants may conflict with the
ideas of the individual representatives.
Yet many recent incidents contradict
this belief: the poll in Tuesday's Daily
which, although only a sample of the

student body, displayed a discontent
with the ASSU decision; and the exclu
sion of the enormous number of write
in votes, quickly validated by the
senate. Both of the examples demon
strate that this second concept of
democratic government is also an
interpretation which the ASSU does
not embrace.
Finally, I awoke to understand that
the ASSU seems to be the modern
"democratic" government, a system in
which elected individuals bond to
gether, their sole goal being to further
their own powers, regardless of
whether their decisions seem "just" or
if they are in accordance with the
wishes of the people whom they claim
to represent. It is this manipulation of
power which propagates the govern
ment. Unfortunately, some ASSU
senators have not yet grasped this
concept, and they felt that the only
way their opinions could be expressed

was to leave the senate meetings.
Perhaps they will someday understand
that the minority is often superfluous
in the ASSU.
I blame myself for my naivete. Like
all good governments, the ASSU has
adapted to changing times; the original
conception of this governing body could
possibly have been similar to my previ
ous beliefs, but the ASSU has changed,
and the student body must realize and
accept this fact. The current self
definitions of the ASSU Senate do not
include the production of policies which
are the most just.
It chooses instead to further its
individuals' private ends, or those of
their political party. Being finally
aware of the goals of many members
of the ASSU Senate, I heartily com
mend them on their outstanding suc
cess.
