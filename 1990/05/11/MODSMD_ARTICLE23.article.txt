# Black community does not operate on aggression
## 
### 
This letter concerns the situation
that Richard Kahn described in his
April 24 and May 9 letters to The
Daily.
I'm tired of hearing his lamenta
tions, so I'll give him the facts:
On the night of his alleged "attack,"
there was an African-American frater
nity party. This event attracted a great
number of people from other cam
puses.
The people who lunged at him were
more than likely from another univer
sity: if black people on this campus
wanted to intimidate Caucasians with
brute force, we would have taken ac-

tion before now.
But that's not how the black com
munity works — we stand behind the
Black Student Union and other organi
zations to combat racism and under
representation. There simply is no need
to catogorize this event as "an outlet
for African-American aggression." The
white community can come off Red
Alert.
Other people also suffer personal
attack. If people of color were to pout
and write letters to The Daily every
time we experienced an act that threat
ened our ethnicity, the whole campus
would be in an uproar. Learn to cope,
Rich.
Try and look into the psychology
that motivated those men in order to
improve your own condition. Use it as
a lesson: re-examine yourself and make
sure that that kind of behavior toward
you was truly unwarranted. Because
right now, you appear to er\joy your

role as the Instigator.
