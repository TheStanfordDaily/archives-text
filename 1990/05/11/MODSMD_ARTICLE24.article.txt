# Therapeutic benefit of fountains is crucial to students
## 
### 
Stanford has once again decided to
turn off its fountains. According to
Operations and Maintenance manager
Cheryl Jensen in the May 9 Daily arti
cle entitled "Stanford to limit water
use," the fountains will be turned off
for public relations reasons. It seems
that, although they do not account for
much water use, "it just doesn't look
good" to have the fountains going dur
ing periods of water rationing.
I do not think the Stanford adminis

trators have reached a decision benefi
cial to the members of the Stanford
community. Two of Stanford's foun
tains, The Claw in White Plaza and
The Hoop outside Green Library, con
tribute greatly to both the psychologi
cal health of the student body and the
spectacular beauty of this campus.
Lying near The Hoop in the green
Srass under the warm sun is a tremen
ous experience. The sound of falling
water and the feel of the occasional
wayward mist of coolness delights the
senses. As this school year comes to a
stressful close, the relaxing, therapeutic
benefits of the fountains become even
more important.
Realizing that they require only min
imal water use, is it worth some vague
concept of "public relations" to take
away from us the beauty and pleasure
of two of Stanford's fountains?
