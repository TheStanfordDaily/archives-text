## A 						cheer for all seasons 
### 
WHAT'S WRONG with you
people? Whaddya mean you
don't want cheerleaders? Come
on, everybody's doing it — don't you
realize Stanford sticks out enough as it
is? Think about it: We're often mentioned
in the same breath as Harvard, Princeton
and Yale, but next fall we have to compete
with USC, Colorado, Notre Dame and
UCLA, among other schools. That makes
us pretty unusual — and as we all know
from high school, being unusual is bad.
Now, there do exist universities which
have copied our band's irreverence — but
none of them appear in the Pac-10 or in
any of our non-conference games. Gosh,
how embarrassing for us. I feel so .. .
unconventional . .. estranged . .. alone.
It's obviously high time we became more
like everyone else — and getting cheer
leaders is a perfect beginning.
Yes, it's time for an already established
sort of tradition. With only a little coach
ing from our good friends from the south
land, soon our men and women will be
able to use Quick Tan, Peroxide and stra
tegic undergarment padding as effectively
as anyone. It's as easy as one,two,three
thousand dollars we just happen to have
sitting around.
I'll admit I was a little worried when,
in their letter to The Daily, the idea of
"an official cheerleaders' BMW" occurred
to our highly-selective squad. But then
I realized that that was only USC rubbing
off on us, so I felt better.
I am still confused, however, that call
ing cheerleading a "non-sport" could be
thought of as sexist. Why? Aren't there

men on the squad, too? Sure, cheerleaders
have generally been women, but that's
not why cheerleading isn't a sport — it's
because cheerleading is generally
performance-oriented, not competition
oriented. Here's a simple rule of thumb:
no points, no sport. That goes for the
running-around-with-ribbons-on-sticks
thing they do in the Olympics, too.
But I'm nitpicking. I'm sure these
things will resolve themselves just fine.
Now all we need are some cheers to ap
propriately represent Stanford — and to
keep us a little more interested than "go,
fight, win" or "defense" over and over
and over.
So, in the spirit of things, I've come
up with a few of my own, appropriate
for different occasions and different sec
tions of the crowd:
The Student Section Cheer:
We are drunk, and we can't see! Sun
burned, and we have to pee! Lost our
money on the floor! Tell us, tell us, what's
the scorel
The Pre-Med Pride Cheer:
We're true to good old Stanford U!
True to Leland, through and through!
Cut us, we bleed Cardinal Red! Hope it
clots or we'll be dead!
The Stuck-up Intelligentsia Cheer:
It doesn't matter if we lose again! We're
pretty sure we're still top-10! If not on
the field, if not on the court, in U.S.
News & World Report!
The Advantages of Being Intangible
Cheer:
Pinch Us! Kick Us! Beat us 'til we're
dead! You can't hurt us, 'cause we're a

color: red!
The "Pity Us, We're Poor" Cheer:
Hey you other team, give us a break!
We've got a big debt from the quake!
(repeat ad nauseam)
The Passive, Blue-Haired Alumni Cheer:
Gosh we're pleased, just thought we'd
say, that we have got more points than
they! (Do not repeat. You might seem
enthusiastic.)
The "We're Not Spending Thousands
of Dollars On Cheerleaders, Honest!"
Cheer:
No polyester pants! No short skirts! All
we've got ... is 23 T-shirts!
The Take Your Mind Off The Score By
Employing a Non Sequitur Cheer:
We are losing! We don't mind! We can
still come from behind! You are boring!
You are dull! We are multicultural!
The It's Not Whether You Win or Lose,
It's How You Balance the Budget Cheer:
Kill them Cardinal! Maim and smash!
Bowl games earn us extra cash!
Or ...
Wrestling! Sailing! Field Hockey!
Track! Score more points and bring them
back!

Sherman! Fridays! Read it here! 8.A.!
English! Just this year!
