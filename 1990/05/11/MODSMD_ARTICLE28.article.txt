## Michael Stevenson Facing the AIDS possibility: facts, fallacies, fears 
### 
A MONTH AGO I went in for an
HIV-antibody test. There was a
small chance that I had been
infected last fall with the AIDS virus;
my partner had said he wasn't infec
ted, but I still had to know my status
to ease my peace of mind. Aware of
the window period where antibodies to
human immunodeficiency virus take
from three to six months (or even
longer) to appear in the bloodstream, I
waited restlessly for five months before
going to an anonymous testing site
clinic at the Red Cross in Palo Alto.
Once there, I sat in a chair while
the nurse drew seven milliliters of my
blood into a vial, and I watched as she
placed it in a rack already holding
several other vials, none different from
my own save for a tagged number.
Then I went home, and for the next
two weeks I tried not to think of that
small vial, or of the unknown tech
nicians who were analyzing my blood
for those antibodies through ELISA, a
st that would determine the outcome
112 my life.
Finally the day came, and I went
ack for the results. A different nurse
sat me down, calmly showed me how
my number matched the number on
the paper she was holding, and paused.
My heart lept.
She said I was negative, that I

didn't have the virus, and were there
any questions?
Since then I've thought a lot about
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. AIDS. Amazing acronym.
Amazing that it took most of the
1980s to have that name become as
household a word as "Teenage Mutant
Nirya Turtles" did in a few months.
Amazing now that with all the
publicity over AIDS, including televi
sion commercials and educational
programs held in many school systems,
the rate of infection is still increasing,
most notably in the black and Hispanic
communities, and the heterosexual
population still has trouble accepting
the fact that HIV can strike them as it
spreads in their community —
teenagers are more and more suscepti
ble to infection as they explore their
own sexuality on the college campus.
And it's amazing how overblown the
fear of contracting HIV through casual
contact really is — that using the
same phone, sharing toilet seats, hug
ging or just being in the same room
with a person with AIDS poses no
health threat to anyone. People with
cancer aren't normally ostracized; why
should an HIV-positive man, woman or
child be? It's 1990, and there have
been over 71,000 deaths in the United

States from AIDS — more Americans
killed by an invisible virus than by the
Vietnam War.
I got to see the Quilt a couple of
weekends ago — the NAMES Project
AIDS Memorial Quilt. Over 1,200
panels representing those who had died
from AIDS were laid out on the floor
of the Santa Clara Convention Center
during the county's AIDS Week — a
fraction of the more than 12,000
panels that currently make up the
Quilt, which represents an even smaller
fraction of the deaths in the United
States, and in the world.
While I slowly wandered among the
panels, their sewn-in names were read
out loud — it took almost two hours.
The spectrum of grief and anger woven
into the sheets by the families, friends
and loved ones of those lost to AIDS
was tremendous ... one panel for
Michael Bennett, creator of "A Chorus
Line" ... one for Stanford University
... one for Baby Doe ... one with a
young man's favorite shirt sewn into
the fabric ... a driver's license, a comb
... a baby's rattle, love letters ... "she
died in prison — we cannot say her
name" .. . "to those who died of red
tape" .. . and the photos, oh God,
those faces, those smiling faces, just
like yours and mine .. . the loss

wrought by AIDS sewn into the
Quilt....
How the hell am I supposed to face
relationships when I'm facing all this?
The only way I or anyone else can —
by facing the facts and educating
ourselves. Look, HIV is most com
monly transmitted through exposure of
contaminated blood products or semen,
or through sharing needles with infec
ted people during intravenous drug
use. But HIV can be stopped.
For IV drug users — don't share
works. Clean the needles with soap
and water, or a bleach solution. For
the worldwide adult population —
abstain from sex. (Right) It's 100-
percent foolproof. (So are full-body
condoms, but you won't see me pulling
one of those out of my wallet!) At
least practice safer sex by using con
doms with spermicide containing
nonoxynol-9, which destroys the virus.
And remember, having sex doesn't
necessarily mean having sexual inter
course; touching can be fun, and we do
have our imagination. (I hear feather
dusters are quite stimulating — kinda
kinky, huh?)
Seriously now, until a vaccine or
cure can be found, education is the
best weapon we have against fighting

AIDS. That's the step I took toward
overcoming my alarm about the dis
ease. Now I'll approach a relationship
with both eyes and ears open.
I'll reveal my past to my partner,
what I like, what I dislike; and ask the
same of him. I will say no if I don't
want to do something — it's my
choice, and that must be respected. To
have a long-lasting relationship is to
have honest and open communication
between two people; the experience of
loving will be much more fulfilling for
that. Talk to each other, and more
importantly, listen.

While I slowly wandered among the
panels, their sewn-in names were read
out loud — it took almost two hours.
The spectrum of grief and anger woven

name" .. . "to those who died of red
tape" .. . and the photos, oh God,

How the hell am I supposed to face
relationships when I'm facing all this?
The only way I or anyone else can —
by facing the facts and educating
ourselves. Look, HIV is most com
monly transmitted through exposure of
contaminated blood products or semen,
or through sharing needles with infec
ted people during intravenous drug
use. But HIV can be stopped.
For IV drug users — don't share
works. Clean the needles with soap
and water, or a bleach solution. For
the worldwide adult population —
abstain from sex. (Right) It's 100-
percent foolproof. (So are full-body
condoms, but you won't see me pulling
one of those out of my wallet!) At
least practice safer sex by using con
doms with spermicide containing
nonoxynol-9, which destroys the virus.
And remember, having sex doesn't
necessarily mean having sexual inter
course; touching can be fun, and we do
have our imagination. (I hear feather
dusters are quite stimulating — kinda
kinky, huh?)
Seriously now, until a vaccine or
cure can be found, education is the
best weapon we have against fighting

AIDS. That's the step I took toward
overcoming my alarm about the dis
ease. Now I'll approach a relationship
with both eyes and ears open.
I'll reveal my past to my partner,
what I like, what I dislike; and ask the
same of him. I will say no if I don't
want to do something — it's my
choice, and that must be respected. To
have a long-lasting relationship is to
have honest and open communication
between two people; the experience of
loving will be much more fulfilling for
that. Talk to each other, and more
importantly, listen.

A MONTH AGO I went in for an
HIV-antibody test. There was a
small chance that I had been
infected last fall with the AIDS virus;
my partner had said he wasn't infec
ted, but I still had to know my status
to ease my peace of mind. Aware of
the window period where antibodies to
human immunodeficiency virus take
from three to six months (or even
longer) to appear in the bloodstream, I
waited restlessly for five months before
going to an anonymous testing site
clinic at the Red Cross in Palo Alto.
Once there, I sat in a chair while
the nurse drew seven milliliters of my
blood into a vial, and I watched as she
placed it in a rack already holding
several other vials, none different from
my own save for a tagged number.
Then I went home, and for the next
two weeks I tried not to think of that
small vial, or of the unknown tech
nicians who were analyzing my blood
for those antibodies through ELISA, a
st that would determine the outcome
112 my life.
Finally the day came, and I went
ack for the results. A different nurse
sat me down, calmly showed me how
my number matched the number on
the paper she was holding, and paused.
My heart lept.
She said I was negative, that I

didn't have the virus, and were there
any questions?
Since then I've thought a lot about
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. AIDS. Amazing acronym.
Amazing that it took most of the
1980s to have that name become as
household a word as "Teenage Mutant
Nirya Turtles" did in a few months.
Amazing now that with all the
publicity over AIDS, including televi
sion commercials and educational
programs held in many school systems,
the rate of infection is still increasing,
most notably in the black and Hispanic
communities, and the heterosexual
population still has trouble accepting
the fact that HIV can strike them as it
spreads in their community —
teenagers are more and more suscepti
ble to infection as they explore their
own sexuality on the college campus.
And it's amazing how overblown the
fear of contracting HIV through casual
contact really is — that using the
same phone, sharing toilet seats, hug
ging or just being in the same room
with a person with AIDS poses no
health threat to anyone. People with
cancer aren't normally ostracized; why
should an HIV-positive man, woman or
child be? It's 1990, and there have
been over 71,000 deaths in the United

States from AIDS — more Americans
killed by an invisible virus than by the
Vietnam War.
I got to see the Quilt a couple of
weekends ago — the NAMES Project
AIDS Memorial Quilt. Over 1,200
panels representing those who had died
from AIDS were laid out on the floor
of the Santa Clara Convention Center
during the county's AIDS Week — a
fraction of the more than 12,000
panels that currently make up the
Quilt, which represents an even smaller
fraction of the deaths in the United
States, and in the world.
While I slowly wandered among the
panels, their sewn-in names were read
out loud — it took almost two hours.
The spectrum of grief and anger woven
into the sheets by the families, friends
and loved ones of those lost to AIDS
was tremendous ... one panel for
