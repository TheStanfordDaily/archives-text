# Republicans spark discussion on AIDS â€” then split
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Aiming to correct "misinformation"
about AIDS and spark campus debate,
the Stanford College Republicans left
those who attended their presentation
last night with many opinions, but no
one to discuss them with.
The approximately 35-member
crowd watched a video titled "AIDS:
What You Haven't Been Told," only
to react with surprise when members
of the College Republicans left imme
diately after the presentation.

When the video ended, at about
10:30 p.m., College Republicans Pres

he had an appointment to make and
left, as did the other College Repub

gays and lesbians and a handful of
straight students.
Among other things, the movie ac

by gays and lesbians of using govern

ment funds "to spread the homosexual
lifestyle."
"We think the topic of AIDS is very
important," Abbott said before the pre
sentation. "There's a great deal of
misinformation out there about
AIDS."
Calling the video "very good," he
added, "It's important as many people
as possible see this."
Members of the gay and lesbian com
munity expressed outrage at what they
called the video's pronounced anti
homosexual tone.
Explaining that the College Repub

licans had "no official view per se" on
the topic of AIDS and homosexuals,
Abbott said, "We're just trying to show
different viewpoints" and "trying to
get a debate going at Stanford."
"The whole movie ... is about ho
mophobia," said Andrew Gans, a work
shop leader from the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA AIDS Prevention Project.
None of the College Republicans in
attendance last night could be reached
for comment after the presentation.
