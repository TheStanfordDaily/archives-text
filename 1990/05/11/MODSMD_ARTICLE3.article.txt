# Republicans spark discussion on AIDS â€” then split
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Aiming to correct "misinformation"
about AIDS and spark campus debate,
the Stanford College Republicans left
those who attended their presentation
last night with many opinions, but no
one to discuss them with.
The approximately 35-member
crowd watched a video titled "AIDS:
What You Haven't Been Told," only
to react with surprise when members
of the College Republicans left imme
diately after the presentation.

When the video ended, at about
10:30 p.m., College Republicans Pres
ident John Abbott informed the crowd
he had an appointment to make and
left, as did the other College Repub
licans in attendance.
The three or four College Republi
cans present were greatly outnum
bered by members of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, local area
gays and lesbians and a handful of
straight students.
Among other things, the movie ac
cused AIDS organizations sponsored
by gays and lesbians of using govern

ment funds "to spread the homosexual
lifestyle."
"We think the topic of AIDS is very
important," Abbott said before the pre
sentation. "There's a great deal of
misinformation out there about
AIDS."
Calling the video "very good," he
added, "It's important as many people
as possible see this."
Members of the gay and lesbian com
munity expressed outrage at what they
called the video's pronounced anti
homosexual tone.
Explaining that the College Repub

licans had "no official view per se" on
the topic of AIDS and homosexuals,
Abbott said, "We're just trying to show
different viewpoints" and "trying to
get a debate going at Stanford."
"The whole movie ... is about ho
mophobia," said Andrew Gans, a work
shop leader from the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA AIDS Prevention Project.
None of the College Republicans in
attendance last night could be reached
for comment after the presentation.
Many viewers thought the film,
which began by presenting facts
about AIDS and its transmission,
increasingly attacked homosexu
als for their "unnatural" and "un
healthy" lifestyle.
"This behavior induced the
AIDS epidemic in the first place,"
the film also said. It accused ho
mosexuals of trying to "promote
their lifestyle regardless of the im
plication on public health."
At the end of the film, the nar
rator encouraged individuals to
fund AIDS groups not sponsored
or organized by homosexuals.
The film included interviews
with AIDS patients, homosexuals,
intravenous drug users, members

of Congress and various health
officials, including members of
the Centers for Disease Control.
"This entire film switched
things upside down," Gans said.
"The use of authorities was in
teresting," said graduate student
Steve Greene. "The experts
(interviewed at the start of the
film) came back as raving homop
hobes."
Several people said they had no
idea the presentation would con
sist solely of a video, for it was
not mentioned on the fliers ad
vertising the event.
"If these are the facts, why are
[the College Republicansl so
afraid of presenting them?" grad
uate student David Bradfute said
of the information presented in
the film.
