# 'Tubbing' banned

### 
The Daily Palo Alto

Freshman hazing, or "tubbing"
as it was called, was banned from
campus under penalty of expul
sion. The decision was a result of
the administration's fear of acci
dents and its inability to regulate
the practice.
Members of the soon-to-be
sophomore class were unhappy
with the ruling because it
prevented them from avenging
themselves. The only hazing to
be allowed would be in fraternity
houses under the supervision of
upperclassmen.
Isn't that sweet? Stanford really
does care about its underclas
smen. It got rid of hazing but
invented Res Ed. Maybe if we
revive "tubbing" we could bring
back some class spirit. Perhaps it
would make a good Dead Week
activity. We could sacrifice a fresh
man or two to the spirits of partial
credit and chance.

Residents of Toyon Hall were
evacuated to make room for Army
soldiers coming to Stanford for
special training. The troops were
arriving at the University to study
engineering, psychology and
foreign languages.
Toyon was the third dorm to
be taken over by troops, the others
being Sequoia and Branner Halls.
All students were given partial
rebates on their rent and were
housed in fraternities and other
buildings on campus.
If you live on the Row, you get
displaced by an earthquake; if you
live in a dorm, you get displaced
by the Army. Imagine how it must
have felt to get kicked out of your
room to go live in a gym because
Stanford was teaching geography,
German and Hum Sex to soldiers.

More than 2,500 people
recreated the 1930s in the area
adjacent to Hoover Tower. Protes

tors constructed a shantytown,
set up a soup kitchen and wore
rags for clothes.
The "Hoovervilles" were pro
testing the Reagan administra
tion's policies by drawing a
parallel between the economic
conditions of the Depression and
those of today.
Capitalizing on the large crowd,
a member of Women's Action

climbed up on the base of the
tower to hang a 50-foot banner
that read "phallocentrism/male
dominance/militarism."
Did the architect who designed
Hoover Tower know he was cre
ating a phallic monument that
was going to be revered by genera
tions of Stanford students ?

A Berkeley student claiming to
have possession of the Axe sent
letters to the San Francisco Ex
aminer and The Daily Californian
in an attempt to strike fear in
the hearts of Stanford students
and create glee among his fellow
weenies.
Ken Raust signed the letters,
"Friends of Oski," and demanded
that Stanford change its nick
name from"The Cardinal" to
"Trees" or "Redwoods." He also
requested that he receive a front
page picture of him holding the
Axe and that all charges be
dropped.
The Axe is a useless outdated
symbol of school spirit. A more
contemporary symbol such as an
M-16 rifle or some type of laser
beam would be more appropriate.
