# The 						Bug reveals deeply guarded secrets about his sex life
## 
### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
Ever wonder what happened to Lake
Lagunita? I had a dream that the lake
was filled last night, which made me
wonder if 1 was sexually repressed. How
ever, I figured that I wasn't repressed,
but deprived. Isn't that a good Freudian
interpretation?
Anyway, I got to thinking that the land
should be put to use, so I called the
Office of the President and made these
suggestions: 1) setting up a huge tractor
pull with BIGFOOT, BIGFOOT, bigfoot,
2) converting it to a playground — but
I suppose it is a little far from Branner
or 3) turning it into a practice ground
for the Jamaican bobsledding team.
I understand that plans are underway
for a huge wave-making machine so the
University can offer a surfing class next
year. Meyer Library will be shut down
so funds can be reallocated for this very
important project. Don't worry, it won't
affect the cheerleading squad.
Send your questions to the Bug so I
can have something to do besides dream
about my sex life (what sex life?)
Dear Bug,
So just what the hell is that . . . thing
up on the south side of Terman ? A sun
dial? A diagram representing the search
for a Grand Unified Theory? Or just
another piece of pointless art?
— Rosencrantz or Guildenstern

I had a dream that the
lake was filled last night,
which made me wonder if I
was sexually repressed.

After talking to Paul, Jane, Christine,
Ben, Operations and Maintenance, two
Terman Engineering Library assistants,
Frankie, Larry, Curly and Moe, I finally
found an answer to this question.
I was in my jazz theory class and Don
Kennedy was wearing a pair of paisley
boxer shorts and yellow socks while lec
turing about why it is acceptable to dis
like classical music when in walked
Electrical Engineering Prof. Ron
Bracewell. He looked at me sitting in the
front of the class and said, "you called?"
It was at this point that I realized I was
lying in bed and my roomate had just
handed me the phone.
From what I remember of this conver
sation, that "thing" hanging from Ter
man is a mock-up of a sundial, but not
a working sundial. Anyway, Bracewell de
signed the "thing" and has received per
mission from the University Commitee
on Outside Hanging Things to create a
"working device consisting of a lot of
curves from which you can read the exact
time." I have no idea if it will look even
a tad bit similar to the non-working
device presently hanging from Terman.
It will, however, be in the exact same

place, and after you figure out how it
works, it will most likely tell you how
late to class you are.
Dear Bug,
Just who is the person on the tail of
the Alaska Airlines planes?
— Ben Jammin
I spent two fruitless hours on the roof
of my house with a pair of binoculars
before the neighbors called the police —
the woman across the street looks noth
ing like the guy on the tail of the Alaska
Airlines airplane.
Back to the question. Alaska Airlines
told me it was "nobody special — just
an Eskimo." When they asked me who

I was I said, "Oh, nobody special — just
an Eskimo."
Alaska Airlines denied all my allega
tions that the Eskimo was really Zsa Zsa
Gabor without makeup. They had
planned at one time to take the Eskimo
off, but it caused such an uproar in Alaska
that the state legislature passed a law
forbidding them to remove Zsa Zsa from
the tail of the plane.
Dear Bug,
On my way home I quite often pass
the corner of Hawthorne and Alma,
whereupon I see this enormous cement
structure in the shape of a large silo.
Because I happen to live in the area,
could you possibly tell me what it is and
if I should be concerned for my health.
— Joel
I just recently read a book by Douglas
Adams entitled "Dirk Gently's Holistic
Detective Agency." The detective, Dirk
Gently, believes that all events are inter
twined and if he just follows somebody
that looks like he knows where he's going,
he will eventually find the answer to his
questions.
In real life, however, I've discovered
this doesn't work. After following a
Volkswagen convertible to a two-story
house in San Carlos, I got out of the car
and said, "Hi, my name is Bryan, do you
know anything about this concrete struc
ture on the corner of Hawthorne and
Alma?" To make a long story short, I
quickly returned to my car and got lost

on the way home.
Sure enough there is a concrete struc
ture that looks just like a silo right where
it's supposed to be. The following is an
excerpt from my conversation with a lady
at the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce:
"Do you know what the concrete struc
ture is on the corner of Alma and Haw
thorne?"
"It's a water tower."
"Is it in use?"
"No, it's empty."
"Are you sure? Could there be any
nuclear warheads in the silo?"
"No, it's empty."
"Could there be any toxic waste in the
silo?"
"No, it's empty."
"Is there maybe ..."
"NO, it's empty."
So there you have it, Joel, it's a water
tower and the only concern you might
have for your health is if you live next
door and it collapses on your house.
Dear Bug,
What is the value dot on a Domino's
Pizza box?
— the Noid
According to the corporate branch in
San Jose, it's "a promotional thing." If
you save enough "value dots" the com
pany will offer "exciting" prizes such as
mugs, anything having to do with the
Noid and pro-life T-shirts. Generally that
requires about 10 value dots. If you were
to save, oh, say, one million value dots,
Domino's offers a special medical plan.
