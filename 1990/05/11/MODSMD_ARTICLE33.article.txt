## Three to go — Card's 'drive for five' rolls into quarters 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Gainesville, Fla.
Dear Stanford,
This place is kind of weird.
When we came in the other day,
there was hardly anyone in the
airport. Florida got out of school
last week so the town is almost
empty.
The weather is all right. The
sun is shining but it's too hot and
way too humid. It's definitely hard
to study because it's so tempting
to just sit outside — kind of like
home.
See you soon,
The women's tennis team
P.S. We played for just under two
hours yesterday. We beat Arizona
6-0. We're supposed to meet Geor
gia today.

Cardinal 6

Wildcats 0

The Cardinal kicked off its drive
for an unprecedented fifth
straight national title yesterday
in impressive fashion, de-clawing
the Arizona Wildcats without
dropping a set along the way.
Stanford had not played a dual
match since defeating USC April
24, but the Cardinal did not ap
pear the least bit rusty as they
dispatched Arizona in one hour
and 48 minutes.
Earlier in the season, the Wild
cats forced the Cardinal to dou
bles — one of only three times
that happened this year. Yester
day, the closest they came to even
winning a set was at No. 6 singles.
Twice Arizona's Kyra Johnson
(no relation to Stanford's Kylie)
was serving for the second set.
Trailing 4-5, though, Heather Wil
lens broke Johnson's serve to even

things at 5-5. Johnson then broke
back to move up 6-5. Again Wil
lens neeeded a break and again
she got it.
The tiebreaker was all Willens,
as the Cardinal freshman won the
first match of her first NCAAs
6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Ironically, the match did not

even really count. By the time
Willens was breaking Johnson's
serve to stay in the set, another
freshman, the incomparable
Meredith McGrath, was closing
out a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Betsy
Somervile to clinch the team vic
tory.
"That was just about right,"

Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "It was a real good match.
A lot of times on the opening day
you can be real tight. We played
very well today. It was very
businesslike in approach."
Brennan added he was "very

Heather Willens has been on a hot streak recently, but was cooled off a bit by her opponent yesterday
at the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships in Gainesville, Fla. Willens had to battle back from a
4-1 second-set deficit to win 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) at No. 6 singles. The Cardinal continued its dual-match
domination with a quick 6-0 kill of 13th-seeded Arizona.
impressed with Teri Whitlinger
and Lisa Green," which is appro
priate considering the short work
they made of their opponents.
Whitlinger, whose last dual
match defeat was in April of 1989,
needed just 58 minutes to dispose
of the Wildcats' Danielle Klurman
6-1, 6-0.
Green fell behind 2-3 in the first
set, although the match was on
serve. If Arizona's Beth Choate
began to think she had a chance,
Green quickly squashed that no
tion by reeling off 10 games in a
row to record the 6-3, 6-0 tri

umph.
Minutes after Green's match
ended, Sandra Birch was putting
the finishing touches on her mas
terpiece at No. 1 singles. Birch
had raced to a 6-1 first-set victory
over Danielle Scott.
The defending NCAA champion
seemed to be in top form as she
captured the first four games of
the second set as well. Scott cut
it to 4-2 before Birch closed her
out 6-1, 6-2. Scott, at No. 24 in
the Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association rankings, is
just the third top-25 player Birch
has beaten since early March.
Asked if she was back to the
level that made her the nation's
No. 1 player, Birch said, "I try

not to compare how I'm playing.
I really get into trouble when I
do that.
"I feel ready," she said. "I've
been working very hard to tune
things up (for NCAAs)."
Her biggest concern yesterday
was actually the 3:30 p.m. (EDT)
start under the hot sun. "I was
a little bit worried about playing
late in the day," Birch said. "But
I don't think it affected me too
badly."
Nor did it affect Debbie
Graham. In her 49th collegiate
dual match, Graham picked up
her 49th victory yesterday.
Graham never lost her serve in a
6-2, 6-3 thumping of Banni Red
hair.

things at 5-5. Johnson then broke
back to move up 6-5. Again Wil
lens neeeded a break and again
she got it.
The tiebreaker was all Willens,
as the Cardinal freshman won the
first match of her first NCAAs
6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Ironically, the match did not

even really count. By the time
Willens was breaking Johnson's
serve to stay in the set, another
freshman, the incomparable
Meredith McGrath, was closing
out a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Betsy
Somervile to clinch the team vic
tory.
"That was just about right,"

Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "It was a real good match.
A lot of times on the opening day
you can be real tight. We played
very well today. It was very
businesslike in approach."
Brennan added he was "very


Kai Keasey — Daily file
Heather Willens has been on a hot streak recently, but was cooled off a bit by her opponent yesterday
at the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships in Gainesville, Fla. Willens had to battle back from a
4-1 second-set deficit to win 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) at No. 6 singles. The Cardinal continued its dual-match
domination with a quick 6-0 kill of 13th-seeded Arizona.
impressed with Teri Whitlinger
and Lisa Green," which is appro
priate considering the short work
they made of their opponents.
Whitlinger, whose last dual
match defeat was in April of 1989,
needed just 58 minutes to dispose
of the Wildcats' Danielle Klurman
6-1, 6-0.
Green fell behind 2-3 in the first
set, although the match was on
serve. If Arizona's Beth Choate
began to think she had a chance,
Green quickly squashed that no
tion by reeling off 10 games in a
row to record the 6-3, 6-0 tri

umph.
Minutes after Green's match
ended, Sandra Birch was putting
the finishing touches on her mas
terpiece at No. 1 singles. Birch
had raced to a 6-1 first-set victory
over Danielle Scott.
The defending NCAA champion
seemed to be in top form as she
captured the first four games of
the second set as well. Scott cut
it to 4-2 before Birch closed her
out 6-1, 6-2. Scott, at No. 24 in
the Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association rankings, is
just the third top-25 player Birch
has beaten since early March.
Asked if she was back to the
level that made her the nation's
No. 1 player, Birch said, "I try

not to compare how I'm playing.
I really get into trouble when I
do that.
"I feel ready," she said. "I've
been working very hard to tune
things up (for NCAAs)."
Her biggest concern yesterday
was actually the 3:30 p.m. (EDT)
start under the hot sun. "I was
a little bit worried about playing
late in the day," Birch said. "But
I don't think it affected me too
badly."
Nor did it affect Debbie
Graham. In her 49th collegiate
dual match, Graham picked up
her 49th victory yesterday.
Graham never lost her serve in a
6-2, 6-3 thumping of Banni Red
hair.
