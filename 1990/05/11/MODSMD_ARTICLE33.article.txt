## Three to go — Card's 'drive for five' rolls into quarters 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer

Dear Stanford,
This place is kind of weird.
When we came in the other day,
there was hardly anyone in the
airport. Florida got out of school
last week so the town is almost
empty.
The weather is all right. The
sun is shining but it's too hot and
way too humid. It's definitely hard
to study because it's so tempting
to just sit outside — kind of like
home.
See you soon,
The women's tennis team
P.S. We played for just under two
hours yesterday. We beat Arizona
6-0. We're supposed to meet Geor
gia today.

Cardinal 6

Wildcats 0

The Cardinal kicked off its drive
for an unprecedented fifth
straight national title yesterday
in impressive fashion, de-clawing
the Arizona Wildcats without
dropping a set along the way.
Stanford had not played a dual
match since defeating USC April
24, but the Cardinal did not ap
pear the least bit rusty as they
dispatched Arizona in one hour
and 48 minutes.
Earlier in the season, the Wild
cats forced the Cardinal to dou
bles — one of only three times
that happened this year. Yester
day, the closest they came to even
winning a set was at No. 6 singles.
Twice Arizona's Kyra Johnson
(no relation to Stanford's Kylie)
was serving for the second set.
Trailing 4-5, though, Heather Wil
lens broke Johnson's serve to even

things at 5-5. Johnson then broke
back to move up 6-5. Again Wil
lens neeeded a break and again
she got it.
The tiebreaker was all Willens,
as the Cardinal freshman won the
first match of her first NCAAs
6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Ironically, the match did not

even really count. By the time
Willens was breaking Johnson's
serve to stay in the set, another
freshman, the incomparable
Meredith McGrath, was closing
out a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Betsy
Somervile to clinch the team vic
tory.
"That was just about right,"

Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "It was a real good match.
A lot of times on the opening day
you can be real tight. We played
very well today. It was very
businesslike in approach."
Brennan added he was "very

Heather Willens has been on a hot streak recently, but was cooled off a bit by her opponent yesterday
at the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships in Gainesville, Fla. Willens had to battle back from a
4-1 second-set deficit to win 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) at No. 6 singles. The Cardinal continued its dual-match
domination with a quick 6-0 kill of 13th-seeded Arizona.
