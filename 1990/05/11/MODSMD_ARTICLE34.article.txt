# Stanford looking to World Cup already?

### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Dear President Kennedy:
While you attempt to muddle
through a difficult quarter of
"redistribution," I want to take
the time to boost your spirits by
marveling at your incredible
foresight in planning this quar
ter's finals schedule. I am sure
that most Stanford students, like
myself, have long-since begun
preparing for the mid-June fun.
However, I doubt that many of
these same students realize the
reason why Sunday, June 10 is
kept free. In fact, I just realized
your rationale the other day.
Thirty days from today, the
United States soccer team will

return to the World Cup. After
40 years filled with futile at
tempts to reach the premier
competition in the world, the
American squad will finally get
the chance to march around the
field in Florence, Italy, in a first
round match against Czec
hoslovakia.
I'm sure that your foresight
was in part based on the fact
that Stanford is one of 22 sites
currently being considered for
the 12 American venues hosting
the 1994 World Cup. With the
substantial support that the
Stanford community has shown

for international soccer in the
past, I would hope that you and
the University are prepared to
accept a bid and welcome the
World Cup to Palo Alto.
If you have any doubts as to
how big an event the World Cup
is, I would hope that you observe
the crowds and TV numbers of
the '90 event that begins on that
special day in a month.
Some of the lack of interest
in World Cup soccer in this coun
try may stem from the fact that
many of the current students'
parents had barely entered grade
school when the United States
last ventured to the World Cup.
In the 1950 competition, the
United States made a quick,
first-round exit from the fes

tivities in Brazil, with
disappointing losses to Spain
and Chile.
Still, with only the one
reporter from the United States
present to record the event, the
American squad, playing for the
third time in the international
championship, secured a spot in
soccer history. The squad took
down the heavy favorite and
first- time World Cup partici
pant, England, 1-0, before
20,000 fans in Belo Horizonte.
With players like Frank Borghi
and Frank "Pee-Wee" Wallace,
the United States seemed as
sured of a promising future in
World Cup play.
However, nearly two genera
tions have applied to and received
letters from Stanford without the
United States managing to get
even a return invitation. As coun
tries such as Cameroon and South
Korea accepted final round bids,
United States' soccer has found
itself, every four years, uninvited
to the world-wide celebration —
that is, until Paul Caligiuri
slammed the shot into the back
of the net last November in
Trinidad, securing an invitation
to Italy.
To a newly-born soccer fanatic,

barely escaping a nation with just
over a million inhabitants with a
one-goal victory may not spark a
surge of national pride.
But to the fan who had dreamed
of the advanced evolution of
American soccer and cried with
the demise of the North American
Soccer League, which had sported
names such as Pele, Franz Be
ckenbauer and Kyle Rote, Jr. and
had drawn nearly 80,000 fans to
Giants Stadium in the late 19705,
the invitation inked a new line
into the American soccer history
books.
Few soccer experts foresee the
young United States team making
a substantial impact in Italy. If
the team makes it-past the first

round, where it faces two teams
it has never before played in in
ternational competition (Austria
and Czechoslovakia) and one team
that it has never before beaten
(Italy), the elderly soccer fanatics
will need someone there to
prevent them from pulling out
their greying hair in excitement.
President Kennedy, Stanford
has changed dramatically since
1950 when the United States at
tempted to scratch its way into
World Cup record books. As a
Stanford student, I want you to
know that we are taking your day
of reprieve in the middle of finals
week seriously. In deference to 40
years of frustration, we will study
neither books nor notes — just a
little World Cup history.
