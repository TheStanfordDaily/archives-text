# Georgia next on Stanford's hit list

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - The
Georgia Bulldogs have got to
wonder what they have to do to
catch a break. Tied for fourth in
the Volvo/Intercollegate Tennis
Coaches Association rankings, the
'Dawgs drew the fifth seed in the
NCAA tournament.
Because of a strange twist of
fate involving a coin flip, that
seeding earned the Bulldogs a
right to play the No. 1 team in
today's quarterfinals. And not just
any No. 1 team, either.
The Cardinal (25-0) has
knocked Georgia out of the na
tional championships three
straight years. The Bulldogs (23-3
after besting Oklahoma State 5-1
yesterday) made their first-ever
trip to the NCAAs in 1987 and
lost to Stanford 5-1 in the finals.
In 1988, the Cardinal took
Georgia out 5-3 in the quarter
finals. As Stanford rolled over the
whole field last season, they left
the Bulldogs begging for mercy in
a 6-0 semifinal shutout.
If that's not bad enough news
for Georgia fans, when the teams
met at the National Team Indoors
in March it was an NCAA reprise
in more ways than one. Not only
was it a semifinal match, the Car
dinal again emerged with a 6-0
victory.
But Coach Frank Brennan is
not taking the Bulldogs lightly.
"Obviously they are an excellent
team," he said. "We are not used
to playing a team of such out
standing quality in the quarter
finals. I'm not taking anything
for granted. They have tremen
dous people up and down their
lineup."

Most notable among those is
sophomore Shannan McCarthy.
The nation's top freshman a year
ago (with till due respect to Debbie
Graham), McCarthy finished this
season ranked No. 7. Only two of
her seven defeats this year have
been to players ranked below her.
At No. 2 singles, the Bulldogs
have senior Stacey Schefflin, who
is the single biggest reason Geor
gia has moved from also-ran to
perennial power recently. Schefflin
is 129-39, including tournament
play, over her collegiate career.
Should the match reach dou
bles, McCarthy and Schefflin com
pose the No. 2 team in the
country.
Card notes
In other action yesterday, California
shut out San Diego 6-0 and Texas did
the same to Duke by a 5-0 tally. They
meet today to earn the right to play
the Stanford-Georgia winner.
Pepperdine, a 5-1 winner over Ar
izona State, meets UCLA, which beat
South Carolina 6-0. Jessica Emmons,
the Bruins normal No. 1 player, was
not in action today. She suffered a
stress fracture last month and will
play third singles if she can go.
USC was the only winner forced to
doubles. Their 7-2 triumph over Ten
nessee sets them up to face host Flor
ida, a 6-0 winner over Indiana. No
host school has ever reached the finals
at NCAAs â€” ever.
The Stanford men earned the No.
2 seed for next week's men's tourna
ment. They'll play the Oklahoma
State-Utah winner Saturday, May 19
at Indian Wells, Calif.
Jonathan Stark, Jared Palmer and
Alex O'Brien made the singles draw
for NCAAs. Stark-Palmer, Jeff
Cathrall-Alexis Hombrecher and
O'Brien-Jason Yee all made the
doubles draw.
