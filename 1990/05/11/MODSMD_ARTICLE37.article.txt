# Stanford the man — ace hurler paces Cardinal arm corps

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Somewhere, in the back of every
pitcher's mind, lies the dream of
The Perfect Game.
Think about it: Nobody gets on
base. Twenty-seven batters, 27
outs. No hits, no walks, no errors,
no fielder's choices, no HBP's, no
nothing. It's a pitcher's paradise.
How often does a pitcher come
up with nine innings of perfec
tion? Well, look at it this way: In
100 years of major-league base
ball, there have been all of 13
perfect games. That's it. Ever. The
perfecto just doesn't happen that
much, and only a lucky few ever
come close to getting one.
Stanford pitcher Stan Spencer
already has his, though.
In an all-star game, for Pete's
sake.
Okay, so it was in Little League,
and it was only a six-inning game,
but hey, perfect is perfect. Even
for someone who, eight years lat
er, doesn't remember much about
the game. "Just that I was pitch
ing against Dorlarque," Spencer
recalls. (That would be Aaron
Dorlarque, who is now Spencer's
teammate.) "Our teams were
playing in the district playoffs,
and he threw a one-hitter or a
no-hitter or something like that,
and we beat 'em something like
1-0.
"I think I was throwing pretty
well," Spencer says. (Gee, really?)
"I was a big kid in Little League
— about 5-10." Using only a fast
ball, Spencer struck out 13 (give
or take a couple), but after the
game he wasn't exactly over
whelmed by what he'd done.
"I didn't really know what a
perfect game was, to tell you the
truth," Spencer laughs. "I got told
after the game what a perfect
game was. They said 'Yean, you

just threw a perfect game!' and I
was like 'What's that?'
"Someone said 'Nobody got on,'
and I said 'Oh.' "
No big deal.
Spencer hasn't been perfect this
season for Stanford, but he's been
damn close. After winning a total
of 12 games in his first two years,
the junior righty has a 12-1
record, 2.88 ERA, 110 strikouts
and only 27 walks in 112 innings.
Not Lad. "His command of his
pitches is as good as anybody I've
ever had," says Cardinal pitching
coach Tom Dunton, who has
coached for 23 years at Stanford.
"Stan doesn't have any one ex
ceptional pitch: He doesn't have
an outstanding fastball, and his
curve isn't the greatest, but what
he gives you is the complete pack
age. You have to put it all to
gether."
When he does put it all together,
Spencer is nearly untouchable, as
he was against Arizona March 9.
Before that game, Spencer's
career high for strikeouts was
eight.
After the game, the career high
was 15, as Spencer set each and
every Wildcat down with a K at
least once. No walks, either.
Wow. "I think I've picked up a
few miles per hour on my fastball
(this season)," Spencer says,"and
I've been more aggressive, going
after the hitters more."
"He is pitching better," Dunton
says. "As a freshman he did ex
ceptionally well for us, (but) last
year, with Mike hurt, he might
have felt he had to carry a big
part of the burden, and he pressed
a little. This season, though, he's
really concentrated on winning
the big spots."
"Mike" is teammate Mike Mus
sina, who was Stanford's co-Most
Valuable Freshman with Spencer

in 1988. Last year, though, Mus
sina went out with an arm injury
in early March, leaving Spencer a
large load to carry. The extra
weight — along with a porous
defense and a lack of run support
from his team — hung on Spencer
as he struggled to a 5-7 finish.
"I think I might have put too
much pressure on myself," Spen
cer says. "Also, I didn't have any
faith in our defense, really. Early
on, we didn't score a lot of runs
and we seemed to kick a lot of
balls, and I thought I needed to
strike everyone out. I thought I
needed to throw it by them or
paint the black every pitch — two
things that just aren't very con
ducive to pitching.
"You can't go out there and
think that way, and I think that
was a lot of my problem, more
than anything," Spencer says."I
just thought that no one could
touch the ball off me, or I was

going to be in trouble."
The lousy run support his team
mates were giving him wasn't ex
actly helping, either: the Cardinal
scored a miniscule 3.3 runs per
game in Spencer's '89 starts. Nor
mally, of course, a season of no
run support would be chalked up
to plain bad luck. When it's the
second straight season of no sup
port, though (Spencer started 18
games in 1988, but only got a
decision in nine of them despite
a 3.19 ERA), it starts to bother
you.
"It kind of got me down," Spen
cer says."I was thinking it was
another year where they weren't
going to score for me again. I was
trying to figure out why didn't
they score for me. You know,
'What can I change on the mound?
I've got to do something! Maybe
if I pick up some dirt here or


Al Green - Daily file
Cardinal junior Stan Spencer never seemed to have much luck In
his first two seasons at Stanford, suffering from chronic lack of
support. The right-hander has made up for it this season, however,
starting off 12-0 to lead his team to the Slx-Pac title.
