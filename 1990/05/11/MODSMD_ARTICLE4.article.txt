Despite a ruling that calls for Stanford to reduce
its water consumption 12 percent by August 1,
campus fountains will remain in use until the sum
mer, an Operations and Maintenance official said.
Although crews will shut off fountains and stop
watering grounds before the deadline, according to
Herbert Fong, grounds and custodial manager,
"everything will remain as it is until after gradu
ation."
Certain landscaped areas of campus will be tar
geted for water reduction, such as Galvez and
Lomita Malls and the Quad. The fountains will be
shut off because they are "an obvious water-waster,"
Fong said.
The University instituted similar rationing meas
ures two years ago when the current drought began,
shutting off all seven fountains for the entire 1988-
89 school year.
Several campus tour guides interviewed bemoaned
the "de-beautification" of campus but supported
water rationing.
"Having the fountains back on this year has been
a treat," said senior Courtney Reed, who has been
a tour guide for two years. "People usually don't
comment on the fountains, but
shutting them off would change
the atmosphere of Stanford."
"I think it would definitely
reduce the aesthetic beauty of
Stanford, but it's probably neces
sary to turn them off," said junior
Pearl Chen, another two-year vet
eran tour guide.
Although people are more im
pressed by Stanford's architec
ture, said tour guide Joelle
Coletta, a senior, "a lot of visitors
complain about the fact that the
lawns are brown. One guy from
Texas was really disgruntled."
About the fountains, "People
say 'ah' and think that it's nice,"
