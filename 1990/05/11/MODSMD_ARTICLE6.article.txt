# Recall attempt launched
## Group trying to remove newly elected COP 
### Tammy Sun 
In the aftermath of the ASSU
Senate's controversial certifica
tion of the 1990 spring elections,
dozens of students are circulating
a petition calling for the removal
of the newly-elected People's Plat
form Council of Presidents.
The petition's sponsors, who
call themselves Students United
for Fair Elections, must garner
1,950 signatures — 15 percent of
the student body — to submit it
to the ASSU Elections Commis
sion.
First-year graduate student
Perry Friedman, a member of the
group, said he is sure the petition
has already obtained more than
2,000 signatures in the first two
days.

"We are taking a stand with
this petition to show that students
will not put up with any more
partisan politics in the election
process," said Friedman.
Members of "A Clean Slate,"
the Students First slate that lost
the COP race, said they "are
definitely in support" of the move
to recall the election, according to
slate member Michael Canul, a
junior.
"We are protesting the blatant
disregard of student opinion
which clearly supports a runoff
election," he said, referring to
Tuesday's Daily poll which found
67.5 percent of students in favor
of counting the write-in votes
which would have forced a runoff.
"There is no mandate for the
present rule of the People's Plat

form's COP," Canul said. He
added that he did not understand
how the winning "Four Our Fu
ture" COP slate could accept in
"good conscience" the senate's cer
tification of the election on Tues
day.
No members of the "Four Our
Future" slate could be reached for
comment last night, but they and
other People's Platform members
have objected to the high costs of
a runoff based on what they con
sider to be a minor technicality.
The potential cost of both a recall
election and a new election is
about $8,000 to $10,000, accord
