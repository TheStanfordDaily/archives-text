# Hughes to leave Stanford
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Fraternal affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes — a self-described
"rah-rah flag-waver" for fraterni
ties and sororities — has resigned
his post, citing another job offer
as one reason for his decision.
But Hughes said his resignation
was also influenced by a fear of
the budget ax, which is to cut
deeply into the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, and personal
reasons, such as his love of South
ern California and his desire to
complete a partially finished doc
toral degree.
Hughes will take the position
of fraternal affairs adviser at Cal
State-Northridge next year and
will finish his doctorate in higher
education work and adult training
at UCLA.
Although Hughes tried to
downplay the effects of the budget
cuts, Interfraternity Council Pres
ident Todd Ortega said last night

that he sensed the cuts were the
major reason Hughes is leaving.
Ortega said the two had talked
about the University administra
tion's opposition to the fraternity
system. Some Student Affairs ad

ministrators "don't like fraterni
ties and sororities" and would
rather they not be at Stanford,
Ortega said. For example, the
University has a policy not to ac
cept any more housed fraternities.
Because of the 15 percent
budget reductions expected in
Student Affairs, administrators
told Hughes they were cutting the
job of fraternal affairs adviser to
less than half-time.
"To do something where frater
nal affairs was not the predomi
nant reason for the job . . . would
be a waste," Ortega said.
Senior Pam Simpson, who just
finished a year of being Inter
sorority Council president, said
Hughes' resignation could be a
blow to the Stanford Greek sys
tem. "I think it's a real loss," she
said. "He brought in a lot of new
ideas."
Ortega also had words of high
praise for Hughes. "Michael has


Michael Hughes
certainly been the most qualified
fraternal affairs adviser we've
had."
Hughes joined the University
in September and has weathered
a sometimes-controversial year.
Among the benchmarks in
Hughes' short career at Stanford:
• He investigated the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity's role in a Sept.
29 accident in which a drunken
freshman was hit by a truck after
reportedly leaving a Phi Delt
party. Hughes placed the Phi
Delts on suspension for four
months.

• He placed the Pi Beta Phi
sorority on suspension after a
number of alcohol-related inci
dents at an Oct. 14 party. The
sorority was released from
suspension two months later after
Hughes completed a report vin
dicating the sorority.
• He was given charge to inves
tigate the sexual assault of a 13-
year-old girl who was admitted to
a party at the Delta Kappa Ep
silon fraternity. A Daily editorial
called for the University to re
move Hughes from the investiga
tion of the incident after he told
a friend of the victim that she
should look at the incident from
the point of view of the fraternity.
• He suggested in November
that fraternity parties be closed

to students without invitations.
One fraternity closed its parties,
citing legal liability as the primary
reason.
• In a January KZSU interview,
he presented his vision that some
day 60 to 70 percent of the student
body would belong to the Greek
community.
Despite the negative press he
has received, Hughes said, "I
think it's been a real, real positive
year."
"There's a new pride in being
Greek," he said, pointing to the
successful Rush this year.
Hughes said his decision to
leave has not been easy. "It's a
lot harder to leave than I
thought," he said.
