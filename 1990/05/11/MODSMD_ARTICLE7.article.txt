# Hughes to leave Stanford
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Fraternal affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes — a self-described
"rah-rah flag-waver" for fraterni
ties and sororities — has resigned
his post, citing another job offer
as one reason for his decision.
But Hughes said his resignation
was also influenced by a fear of
the budget ax, which is to cut
deeply into the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, and personal
reasons, such as his love of South
ern California and his desire to
complete a partially finished doc

Hughes will take the position
of fraternal affairs adviser at Cal
State-Northridge next year and
will finish his doctorate in higher
education work and adult training

downplay the effects of the budget
cuts, Interfraternity Council Pres

major reason Hughes is leaving.
Ortega said the two had talked

system. Some Student Affairs ad

ministrators "don't like fraterni
ties and sororities" and would
rather they not be at Stanford,
Ortega said. For example, the
University has a policy not to ac
cept any more housed fraternities.
Because of the 15 percent
budget reductions expected in
Student Affairs, administrators
told Hughes they were cutting the
job of fraternal affairs adviser to
less than half-time.
"To do something where frater
nal affairs was not the predomi
nant reason for the job . . . would
be a waste," Ortega said.
Senior Pam Simpson, who just
finished a year of being Inter
sorority Council president, said
Hughes' resignation could be a
blow to the Stanford Greek sys
tem. "I think it's a real loss," she
said. "He brought in a lot of new
ideas."
Ortega also had words of high
praise for Hughes. "Michael has
