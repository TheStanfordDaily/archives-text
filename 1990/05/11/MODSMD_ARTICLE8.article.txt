# Over 100 pan parking plan
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
Money lured more than 100 people to the
last public meeting on the new University
parking proposals, and they weren't happy
about planned increases in the costs for
parking permits.
Although the first four hearings of the Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation were
sparsely attended, a May 4 tentative decision
to increase the price of campus parking stickers
inspired a crowd of protesters, some carrying
signs, to attend yesterday's meeting at Terman
Auditorium.
Boosting "A" sticker prices from $170 to
$200 and resident and "C" sticker prices from
$40 to $50, published as one of the committee's
"experimental" proposals April 4, earned the
most bitter criticisms of all.
One staff member from the Department of
Biological Sciences said, "When I came here
in 1974, no one paid for parking And now
(the University has) the nerve to do this, to
us, the little people."
Committee chair Pete Sidebottom expressed
concern and said he felt especially bad about
the erosion of morale caused by the proposal.
He also said he worried for the safety of female
employees, who sometimes must walk long
distances to retrieve their cars because of
parking problems on campus.
Parking problems will increase over the next
few years, according to Sidebottom. The Uni
versity will lose 2,000 surface-level parking
spaces to Near West campus construction, and
to replace them with parking structures would
cost about $40 million — which is unaffor
dable.
The committee's proposals include encour
aging bicycle use, running shuttles from grad
uate student, faculty and staff housing areas
to campus, and adding a surcharge to Univer
sity parking tickets.
One apparently dissatisfied speaker called
on the committee to "resign as a body and
refuse to participate in this charade."
The committee will hold its next private
meeting May 18.
