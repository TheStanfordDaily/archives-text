GAINESVILLE, Fla. — In her first
NCAA Women's Tennis Chapionships,
Heather Willens would not be denied. The
Cardinal freshman came through when it
counted to cap off Stanford's fifth consecu
tive successful national title drive.

Cardinal wins

NCAA Title

Saturday, Stanford was ahead of Texas'
4-1 in the semifinals. If Willens could win
her match with the Longhorns' Lanae
Renschler, the Cardinal would clinch the
team victory in singles.
Unfortunately for Stanford, she had al
ready lost the first set 7-5 and was down
4-0 in the second. Willens had dropped six
straight games and seemed to be out of it.
Then, suddenly, she broke Renschler's serve
to make it 4-1. She held and broke again.
In a blur, Willens was up 5-4 and ready
to serve for the second set. But the match
was running long and, since a Willens come
back was anything but assured, the No. 1
doubles match was started.
The Cardinal'B first doubles team, Ten
Whitlinger and Meredith McGrath, is un
defeated this season and acts as Stanford's
doomsday weapon. (They are not kept in
a case that reads: "Break glass in the event
of an emergency.") On those rare occasions
when it appears the Cardinal might need
to win a doubles match, Coach Frank Bren
nan sends out McGrath and Whitlinger

and they quickly pick apart the opposition.
Brennan employed the tandem that way
against UCLA at the National Team In
doors and they lost just one game. McGrath
and Whitlinger are the closest thing to a
sure thing since betting black and red at
the roulette table.
This time they were facing Susan
Gilchrist and Joanna Plautz, though.
Gilchrist and Plautz were the top-ranked
pair in the nation at one point this season
and seemed capable of giving the Cardinal
duo a run for its money.
Of course, seeming capable and being
capable are two different things. Before the
enthusiastic Texas players could yell "Go
Longhorns!" one more time, Gilchrist and
Plautz were down 6-1, 5-1.
Meanwhile, Willens had captured the sec
ond set and moved up 5-2 in the third. If
she could hold serve, Willens would record
the all-important fifth point. But McGrath
and Whitlinger hit three return winners
off Gilchrist's serve in the final game to
close out the match and put Stanford in
the finals. They lost just 22 points in the
48-minute rout.
At that instant, Willens' score was 40-0
— one point away from victory. Just
seconds after the participants in the dou
bles match were done shaking hands, she
finished off Renschler. If the Cardinal dou
bles tandem had come off the changeover
just a litttle later, or made an extra errant
volley, Willens could have had the clincher.
Nearly the hero, she instead had to con
tent herself with "Nice comeback, Heath
er!" But Willens did hint that her star was
ready to shine sometime soon. That time
