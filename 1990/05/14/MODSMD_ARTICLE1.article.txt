tive successful national title drive.

Cardinal wins

NCAA Title

Saturday, Stanford was ahead of Texas'
4-1 in the semifinals. If Willens could win
her match with the Longhorns' Lanae
Renschler, the Cardinal would clinch the
team victory in singles.
Unfortunately for Stanford, she had al
ready lost the first set 7-5 and was down
4-0 in the second. Willens had dropped six
straight games and seemed to be out of it.
Then, suddenly, she broke Renschler's serve
to make it 4-1. She held and broke again.
In a blur, Willens was up 5-4 and ready
to serve for the second set. But the match
was running long and, since a Willens come
back was anything but assured, the No. 1
doubles match was started.
The Cardinal'B first doubles team, Ten
Whitlinger and Meredith McGrath, is un
defeated this season and acts as Stanford's
doomsday weapon. (They are not kept in
a case that reads: "Break glass in the event
of an emergency.") On those rare occasions
when it appears the Cardinal might need
to win a doubles match, Coach Frank Bren
nan sends out McGrath and Whitlinger

and they quickly pick apart the opposition.
Brennan employed the tandem that way
against UCLA at the National Team In
doors and they lost just one game. McGrath
and Whitlinger are the closest thing to a
sure thing since betting black and red at
the roulette table.
This time they were facing Susan
Gilchrist and Joanna Plautz, though.
Gilchrist and Plautz were the top-ranked
pair in the nation at one point this season
and seemed capable of giving the Cardinal
duo a run for its money.
Of course, seeming capable and being
capable are two different things. Before the
enthusiastic Texas players could yell "Go
Longhorns!" one more time, Gilchrist and
Plautz were down 6-1, 5-1.
Meanwhile, Willens had captured the sec
ond set and moved up 5-2 in the third. If
she could hold serve, Willens would record
the all-important fifth point. But McGrath
and Whitlinger hit three return winners
off Gilchrist's serve in the final game to
close out the match and put Stanford in
the finals. They lost just 22 points in the
48-minute rout.
At that instant, Willens' score was 40-0
— one point away from victory. Just
seconds after the participants in the dou
bles match were done shaking hands, she
finished off Renschler. If the Cardinal dou
bles tandem had come off the changeover
just a litttle later, or made an extra errant
volley, Willens could have had the clincher.
Nearly the hero, she instead had to con
tent herself with "Nice comeback, Heath
er!" But Willens did hint that her star was
ready to shine sometime soon. That time

team's fifth consecutive national championship. Yesterday's victory over Florida capped off back-to-back undefeated
seasons for the Cardinal. Individual play continues this week.
was yesterday afternoon.
The final pitted host Florida against the
Cardinal in a rematch of the 1988 champion
ship match. Two years ago, Stanford was the
overwhelming underdog against the Lady
Gators but shocked them 5-2 to win the title.
Florida has been seeking revenge ever since.
Many felt sure the Gators would exact that
retribution last year on their home court. But
UCLA upset Florida in the semis and forced
them to wait another 12 months.
The showdown finally came to pass yester
day, although it was not much of a show. The
Cardinal jumped ahead 4-0 and needed a win
from Willens or Sandra Birch to capture its
fifth consecutive national crown. Amy Alcini,
the Gators No. 6 player, had a crowd of 1,500
plus behind her as she was serving to Willens
down 5-6 in the second set.
Alcini lost the first set 6-3 and Willens
knew she could seal the championship with
a service break. She saw Birch was down to
Andrea Farley but was not feeling she had
to win. "There was no pressure because I
knew if it went to doubles it would be Teri
and Meredith," she said of winning the
clincher.
With the game tied at 30-30, Willens put
away a volley to earn a break point. She was
completely composed and in no hurry. But on
the very next point, Alcini hit a short ball,
Willens responded with an approach shot, Al
cini tried to pass on the forehand side, Willens
snapped off a crisp forehand volley and it was
over.
Game. Set. Match. NCAA championship.
Five in a row. One for the thumb. Sixty-five
straight wins. A Dynasty.
"It's just an amazing feeling to win all four
nationals," said senior captain Lisa Green,
whose teams have not been defeated at
NCAAs. "I've never lost so I don't know what
it's like."
The Cardinal has put together back-to-back
undefeated seasons and prompted many
wonder when they will lose. "We all believe
one of these days the winning streak has to
end," junior Teri Whitlinger said.
"We just don't want it to be at nationals,"
Green quickly added.
While Green is the first player to be a
starter on four straight NCAA champions,
one person has been around for all seven of
the Cardinal's titles. That, of course, is Bren
nan — the dynasty builder.
"It feels good. It hasn't quite sunk in yet,"
an ebullient Brennan said. "In '83 we lost in
the quarterfinals and the next two days were
the most miserable days on my life."
He explained that six players on the team
had to remain in Albuquerque to prepare for
the individual singles and doubles, and they
all got to watch from the sidelines as USC
won the title. "That's something I want to
never do again."
With Stanford's unbelievable championship
skein, he may not ever have to. But the coach
who often says"I get paid to worry" is always
concerned. "What puts pressure on you is not
the streak," he said. "It's the extraordinary
talent we have. You just hope you don't screw
it up."
To prepare the team mentally (See related
story, page 6), Brennan kept the message
simple. Willens said he told her and the team:
"They're going to be tough. Don't underes
timate them."
Whitlinger noted the coach was careful not
to place too much emphasis on the one match.

"He said things like, 'We've had a great year.
Don't forget what we've done,' " she recalled.
The low-key approach apparently worked
like a charm.
Sophomore Debbie Graham entered her
52nd college dual match with a 51-0 record
and established early she was not interested
in 51-1. Graham broke Holly Danforth's serve
in the first and third games to take the first
set 6-2.
She liked the way that worked so much,
she broke Danforth again in the first and
third games of set number two. Graham was
soon up 5-1 and Danforth was serving at 0-40.
The Cardinal's No. 3 singles star then rocketed
a backhand winner down the line. Stanford
1, Florida 0.
At that point, Holly Lloyd, Florida's other
Holly, was crumbling at the hands of Whit
linger. With the score at 6-1, 5-1, Lloyd was
serving at match point. Whitlinger zipped a
backhand winner past her to close it out.
("Holly deja vu, Batman!") Stanford 2, Florida
0.
Minutes later, Green was receiving serve

from Jillian Alexander — and holding a 6-0,
5-2 lead. The game went to deuce and Alex
ander missed a volley to make it ad out. She
came in behind her next serve and Green
stung a backhand ("Is there and echo in
here?") passing shot by Alexander. Stanford
3, Florida 0.
Attention quickly shifted to No. 2 singles
were McGrath and Florida's Nicole Arendt
were putting on a display of power tennis.
McGrath had fallen behind 3-5 in the first
set and seemed a bit rattled by the Gator
faithful.
"There's no way you can explain to them
the crowd noise," Brennan said of his pre
match meeting with the players. "Until you
hear the roar," you cannot know it is like,
he added.
McGrath was an early victim. "I was playing
against the crowd and they were really on
my case," she said. A veteran of numerous
pro tournaments, McGrath might appear able
to block that out.
"I've played in front of bigger
crowds than that, but they've
never been as hostile," she said.
But Arendt could not capitalize
on the emotion. "By 5-3 I was
cruising, I felt really good," she
said. "Then I let up. Period."
And McGrath started to roll.
Period. She won four straight
games to take the first set 7-5
and forged a 4-2 lead in the sec
ond.
The seventh game proved to be
a pivotal momentum shift. With
Birch and Willens trailing, Arendt
had an opportunity to make
things interesting if she could
fight back into the match.
Instead, she missed an over
head at break point to fall behind
5-2. McGrath came off the chan
geover and served out a powerful
love game in which Arendt hardly
got her racket on the ball. Stan
ford 4, Florida 0.
The super frosh pumped her
first, let out a "Yes!" and, with
doomsday doubles in reserve, had
essentially guaranteed the title.
All Willens had to do was finish
off Alcini, a task that seemed im
probable when the day began. Al
cini had won an amazing 38
percent of her sets at love this
season by returning every shot
into the middle of the court and
playing mistake-free tennis.
Willens had seen Alcini's
remarkable record and recalled
remarking "That's scary." Still,
she believed she could win. "If
you have any doubt, you're going
to make it come true," she said.
"I never have any doubt even if
I'm playing someone who is sup
posedly better."

Willens came in confident and
clearly came in planning to force
the issue yesterday."I knew I had
to be more aggressive," she said.
Nearly every point ended with a
Willens winner or a Willens error.
In the end, she had more of the
former than the latter and a 6-3,
7-5 victory. Stanford 5, Florida 0.
Farley finished off Birch 7-5,
7-5 but could not dampen the Car
dinal's spirits. The team title was
theirs. That no one can deny.
Card notes
Stanford finished the year 29-0 for
the second straight season. It was the
fourth undefeated season in team his
tory (the others being '82, '84 and
*89). The Cardinal won its four NCAA
matches 6-0, 6-0, 6-1, 5-1. In 1989,
the scores were 9-0, 6-1, 6-0, 5-0.

Brennan was once 185-29 at Stan
ford. He is now 250-29 — a .896
winning percentage.
The individual events begin today-
Two rounds of singles will take place.
McGrath is seeded first and meets
Michelle McMillen of Tennessee.
Birch, the defending NCAA champ, is
the No. 5 seed. She'll face Kristi
Jonkosky of Arizona State.
Graham is seeded sixth and squares
off with Iwalani McCalla of UCLA.
Whitlinger was placed in the 9-16
group, which is seeded but in no par
ticular order. She'll play Danielle
Scott of Arizona.
In doubles, McGrath-Whitlinger
enters as an overwhelming favorite
and meets the Sun Devils Karen Ber
gan and Jennifer Rojohn. Birch and
Graham, the third seeds, face Lisa
Albano and Jean-Marie Lozano.

Whitlinger noted the coach was careful not
to place too much emphasis on the one match.

"He said things like, 'We've had a great year.
Don't forget what we've done,' " she recalled.
The low-key approach apparently worked
like a charm.
Sophomore Debbie Graham entered her
52nd college dual match with a 51-0 record
and established early she was not interested
in 51-1. Graham broke Holly Danforth's serve
in the first and third games to take the first
set 6-2.
She liked the way that worked so much,
she broke Danforth again in the first and
third games of set number two. Graham was
soon up 5-1 and Danforth was serving at 0-40.
The Cardinal's No. 3 singles star then rocketed
a backhand winner down the line. Stanford
1, Florida 0.
At that point, Holly Lloyd, Florida's other
Holly, was crumbling at the hands of Whit
linger. With the score at 6-1, 5-1, Lloyd was
serving at match point. Whitlinger zipped a
backhand winner past her to close it out.
("Holly deja vu, Batman!") Stanford 2, Florida
0.
Minutes later, Green was receiving serve

from Jillian Alexander — and holding a 6-0,
5-2 lead. The game went to deuce and Alex
ander missed a volley to make it ad out. She
came in behind her next serve and Green
stung a backhand ("Is there and echo in
here?") passing shot by Alexander. Stanford
3, Florida 0.
Attention quickly shifted to No. 2 singles
were McGrath and Florida's Nicole Arendt
were putting on a display of power tennis.
McGrath had fallen behind 3-5 in the first
set and seemed a bit rattled by the Gator
faithful.
"There's no way you can explain to them
the crowd noise," Brennan said of his pre
match meeting with the players. "Until you
hear the roar," you cannot know it is like,
he added.
McGrath was an early victim. "I was playing
against the crowd and they were really on
my case," she said. A veteran of numerous
pro tournaments, McGrath might appear able
to block that out.
"I've played in front of bigger
crowds than that, but they've
never been as hostile," she said.
But Arendt could not capitalize
on the emotion. "By 5-3 I was
cruising, I felt really good," she
said. "Then I let up. Period."
And McGrath started to roll.
Period. She won four straight
games to take the first set 7-5
and forged a 4-2 lead in the sec
ond.
The seventh game proved to be
a pivotal momentum shift. With
Birch and Willens trailing, Arendt
had an opportunity to make
things interesting if she could
fight back into the match.
Instead, she missed an over
head at break point to fall behind
5-2. McGrath came off the chan
geover and served out a powerful
love game in which Arendt hardly
got her racket on the ball. Stan
ford 4, Florida 0.
The super frosh pumped her
first, let out a "Yes!" and, with
doomsday doubles in reserve, had
essentially guaranteed the title.
All Willens had to do was finish
off Alcini, a task that seemed im
probable when the day began. Al
cini had won an amazing 38
percent of her sets at love this
season by returning every shot
into the middle of the court and
playing mistake-free tennis.
Willens had seen Alcini's
remarkable record and recalled
remarking "That's scary." Still,
she believed she could win. "If
you have any doubt, you're going
to make it come true," she said.
"I never have any doubt even if
I'm playing someone who is sup
posedly better."

Willens came in confident and
clearly came in planning to force
the issue yesterday."I knew I had
to be more aggressive," she said.
Nearly every point ended with a
Willens winner or a Willens error.
In the end, she had more of the
former than the latter and a 6-3,
7-5 victory. Stanford 5, Florida 0.
Farley finished off Birch 7-5,
7-5 but could not dampen the Car
dinal's spirits. The team title was
theirs. That no one can deny.

Cardinal wins

NCAA Title

Saturday, Stanford was ahead of Texas'
4-1 in the semifinals. If Willens could win
her match with the Longhorns' Lanae
Renschler, the Cardinal would clinch the
team victory in singles.
Unfortunately for Stanford, she had al
ready lost the first set 7-5 and was down
4-0 in the second. Willens had dropped six
straight games and seemed to be out of it.
Then, suddenly, she broke Renschler's serve
to make it 4-1. She held and broke again.
In a blur, Willens was up 5-4 and ready
to serve for the second set. But the match
was running long and, since a Willens come
back was anything but assured, the No. 1
doubles match was started.
The Cardinal'B first doubles team, Ten
Whitlinger and Meredith McGrath, is un
defeated this season and acts as Stanford's
doomsday weapon. (They are not kept in
a case that reads: "Break glass in the event
of an emergency.") On those rare occasions
when it appears the Cardinal might need
to win a doubles match, Coach Frank Bren
nan sends out McGrath and Whitlinger

and they quickly pick apart the opposition.
Brennan employed the tandem that way
against UCLA at the National Team In
doors and they lost just one game. McGrath
and Whitlinger are the closest thing to a
sure thing since betting black and red at
the roulette table.
This time they were facing Susan
Gilchrist and Joanna Plautz, though.
Gilchrist and Plautz were the top-ranked
pair in the nation at one point this season
and seemed capable of giving the Cardinal
duo a run for its money.
Of course, seeming capable and being
capable are two different things. Before the
enthusiastic Texas players could yell "Go
Longhorns!" one more time, Gilchrist and
Plautz were down 6-1, 5-1.
Meanwhile, Willens had captured the sec
ond set and moved up 5-2 in the third. If
she could hold serve, Willens would record
the all-important fifth point. But McGrath
and Whitlinger hit three return winners
off Gilchrist's serve in the final game to
close out the match and put Stanford in
the finals. They lost just 22 points in the
48-minute rout.
At that instant, Willens' score was 40-0
— one point away from victory. Just
seconds after the participants in the dou
bles match were done shaking hands, she
finished off Renschler. If the Cardinal dou
bles tandem had come off the changeover
just a litttle later, or made an extra errant
volley, Willens could have had the clincher.
Nearly the hero, she instead had to con
tent herself with "Nice comeback, Heath
er!" But Willens did hint that her star was
ready to shine sometime soon. That time


Kai Keasey - Dally

team's fifth consecutive national championship. Yesterday's victory over Florida capped off back-to-back undefeated
seasons for the Cardinal. Individual play continues this week.
was yesterday afternoon.
The final pitted host Florida against the
Cardinal in a rematch of the 1988 champion
ship match. Two years ago, Stanford was the
overwhelming underdog against the Lady
Gators but shocked them 5-2 to win the title.
Florida has been seeking revenge ever since.
Many felt sure the Gators would exact that
retribution last year on their home court. But
UCLA upset Florida in the semis and forced
them to wait another 12 months.
The showdown finally came to pass yester
day, although it was not much of a show. The
Cardinal jumped ahead 4-0 and needed a win
from Willens or Sandra Birch to capture its
fifth consecutive national crown. Amy Alcini,
the Gators No. 6 player, had a crowd of 1,500
plus behind her as she was serving to Willens
down 5-6 in the second set.
Alcini lost the first set 6-3 and Willens
knew she could seal the championship with
a service break. She saw Birch was down to
Andrea Farley but was not feeling she had
to win. "There was no pressure because I
knew if it went to doubles it would be Teri
and Meredith," she said of winning the
clincher.
With the game tied at 30-30, Willens put
away a volley to earn a break point. She was
completely composed and in no hurry. But on
the very next point, Alcini hit a short ball,
Willens responded with an approach shot, Al
cini tried to pass on the forehand side, Willens
snapped off a crisp forehand volley and it was
over.
Game. Set. Match. NCAA championship.
Five in a row. One for the thumb. Sixty-five
straight wins. A Dynasty.
"It's just an amazing feeling to win all four
nationals," said senior captain Lisa Green,
whose teams have not been defeated at
NCAAs. "I've never lost so I don't know what
it's like."
The Cardinal has put together back-to-back
undefeated seasons and prompted many
wonder when they will lose. "We all believe
one of these days the winning streak has to
end," junior Teri Whitlinger said.
"We just don't want it to be at nationals,"
Green quickly added.
While Green is the first player to be a
starter on four straight NCAA champions,
one person has been around for all seven of
the Cardinal's titles. That, of course, is Bren
nan — the dynasty builder.
"It feels good. It hasn't quite sunk in yet,"
an ebullient Brennan said. "In '83 we lost in
the quarterfinals and the next two days were
the most miserable days on my life."
He explained that six players on the team
had to remain in Albuquerque to prepare for
the individual singles and doubles, and they
all got to watch from the sidelines as USC
won the title. "That's something I want to
never do again."
With Stanford's unbelievable championship
skein, he may not ever have to. But the coach
who often says"I get paid to worry" is always
concerned. "What puts pressure on you is not
the streak," he said. "It's the extraordinary
talent we have. You just hope you don't screw
it up."
To prepare the team mentally (See related
story, page 6), Brennan kept the message
simple. Willens said he told her and the team:
"They're going to be tough. Don't underes
timate them."
Whitlinger noted the coach was careful not
to place too much emphasis on the one match.

"He said things like, 'We've had a great year.
Don't forget what we've done,' " she recalled.
The low-key approach apparently worked
like a charm.
Sophomore Debbie Graham entered her

back was anything but assured, the No. 1
doubles match was started.
The Cardinal'B first doubles team, Ten
Whitlinger and Meredith McGrath, is un
defeated this season and acts as Stanford's
doomsday weapon. (They are not kept in
a case that reads: "Break glass in the event
of an emergency.") On those rare occasions
when it appears the Cardinal might need
to win a doubles match, Coach Frank Bren
nan sends out McGrath and Whitlinger

and they quickly pick apart the opposition.
Brennan employed the tandem that way
against UCLA at the National Team In
doors and they lost just one game. McGrath
and Whitlinger are the closest thing to a
sure thing since betting black and red at
the roulette table.
This time they were facing Susan
Gilchrist and Joanna Plautz, though.
Gilchrist and Plautz were the top-ranked
pair in the nation at one point this season
and seemed capable of giving the Cardinal
duo a run for its money.
Of course, seeming capable and being
capable are two different things. Before the
enthusiastic Texas players could yell "Go
Longhorns!" one more time, Gilchrist and
Plautz were down 6-1, 5-1.
Meanwhile, Willens had captured the sec
ond set and moved up 5-2 in the third. If
she could hold serve, Willens would record
the all-important fifth point. But McGrath
and Whitlinger hit three return winners
off Gilchrist's serve in the final game to
close out the match and put Stanford in
the finals. They lost just 22 points in the
48-minute rout.
At that instant, Willens' score was 40-0
— one point away from victory. Just
seconds after the participants in the dou
bles match were done shaking hands, she
finished off Renschler. If the Cardinal dou
bles tandem had come off the changeover
just a litttle later, or made an extra errant
volley, Willens could have had the clincher.
Nearly the hero, she instead had to con
tent herself with "Nice comeback, Heath
er!" But Willens did hint that her star was
ready to shine sometime soon. That time


Kai Keasey - Dally
Debbie Graham, Heather Widens, Sandra Birch and Asst. Coach Lele Forood celebrate the Stanford women's tennis
team's fifth consecutive national championship. Yesterday's victory over Florida capped off back-to-back undefeated
seasons for the Cardinal. Individual play continues this week.
was yesterday afternoon.
The final pitted host Florida against the
Cardinal in a rematch of the 1988 champion
ship match. Two years ago, Stanford was the
overwhelming underdog against the Lady
Gators but shocked them 5-2 to win the title.
Florida has been seeking revenge ever since.
Many felt sure the Gators would exact that
retribution last year on their home court. But
UCLA upset Florida in the semis and forced
them to wait another 12 months.
The showdown finally came to pass yester
day, although it was not much of a show. The
Cardinal jumped ahead 4-0 and needed a win
from Willens or Sandra Birch to capture its
fifth consecutive national crown. Amy Alcini,
the Gators No. 6 player, had a crowd of 1,500
plus behind her as she was serving to Willens
down 5-6 in the second set.
Alcini lost the first set 6-3 and Willens
knew she could seal the championship with
a service break. She saw Birch was down to
Andrea Farley but was not feeling she had
to win. "There was no pressure because I
knew if it went to doubles it would be Teri
and Meredith," she said of winning the
clincher.
With the game tied at 30-30, Willens put
away a volley to earn a break point. She was
completely composed and in no hurry. But on
the very next point, Alcini hit a short ball,
Willens responded with an approach shot, Al
cini tried to pass on the forehand side, Willens
snapped off a crisp forehand volley and it was
over.
Game. Set. Match. NCAA championship.
Five in a row. One for the thumb. Sixty-five
straight wins. A Dynasty.
"It's just an amazing feeling to win all four
nationals," said senior captain Lisa Green,
whose teams have not been defeated at
NCAAs. "I've never lost so I don't know what
it's like."
The Cardinal has put together back-to-back
undefeated seasons and prompted many
wonder when they will lose. "We all believe
one of these days the winning streak has to
end," junior Teri Whitlinger said.
"We just don't want it to be at nationals,"
Green quickly added.
While Green is the first player to be a
starter on four straight NCAA champions,
one person has been around for all seven of
the Cardinal's titles. That, of course, is Bren
nan — the dynasty builder.
"It feels good. It hasn't quite sunk in yet,"
an ebullient Brennan said. "In '83 we lost in
the quarterfinals and the next two days were
the most miserable days on my life."
He explained that six players on the team
had to remain in Albuquerque to prepare for
the individual singles and doubles, and they
all got to watch from the sidelines as USC
won the title. "That's something I want to
never do again."
With Stanford's unbelievable championship
skein, he may not ever have to. But the coach
who often says"I get paid to worry" is always
concerned. "What puts pressure on you is not
the streak," he said. "It's the extraordinary
talent we have. You just hope you don't screw
it up."
To prepare the team mentally (See related
story, page 6), Brennan kept the message
simple. Willens said he told her and the team:
"They're going to be tough. Don't underes
timate them."
Whitlinger noted the coach was careful not
to place too much emphasis on the one match.

"He said things like, 'We've had a great year.
Don't forget what we've done,' " she recalled.
The low-key approach apparently worked
like a charm.
Sophomore Debbie Graham entered her
52nd college dual match with a 51-0 record
and established early she was not interested
in 51-1. Graham broke Holly Danforth's serve
in the first and third games to take the first
set 6-2.
She liked the way that worked so much,
she broke Danforth again in the first and
third games of set number two. Graham was
soon up 5-1 and Danforth was serving at 0-40.
The Cardinal's No. 3 singles star then rocketed
a backhand winner down the line. Stanford
1, Florida 0.
At that point, Holly Lloyd, Florida's other
Holly, was crumbling at the hands of Whit
linger. With the score at 6-1, 5-1, Lloyd was
serving at match point. Whitlinger zipped a
backhand winner past her to close it out.
("Holly deja vu, Batman!") Stanford 2, Florida
0.
Minutes later, Green was receiving serve

from Jillian Alexander — and holding a 6-0,
5-2 lead. The game went to deuce and Alex
ander missed a volley to make it ad out. She
came in behind her next serve and Green
stung a backhand ("Is there and echo in
here?") passing shot by Alexander. Stanford
3, Florida 0.
Attention quickly shifted to No. 2 singles
were McGrath and Florida's Nicole Arendt
were putting on a display of power tennis.
McGrath had fallen behind 3-5 in the first
set and seemed a bit rattled by the Gator
faithful.
"There's no way you can explain to them
the crowd noise," Brennan said of his pre
match meeting with the players. "Until you
hear the roar," you cannot know it is like,
he added.
McGrath was an early victim. "I was playing
against the crowd and they were really on
my case," she said. A veteran of numerous
pro tournaments, McGrath might appear able
to block that out.
"I've played in front of bigger
crowds than that, but they've
never been as hostile," she said.
But Arendt could not capitalize
on the emotion. "By 5-3 I was
cruising, I felt really good," she
said. "Then I let up. Period."
And McGrath started to roll.
Period. She won four straight
games to take the first set 7-5
and forged a 4-2 lead in the sec
ond.
The seventh game proved to be
a pivotal momentum shift. With
Birch and Willens trailing, Arendt
had an opportunity to make
things interesting if she could
fight back into the match.
Instead, she missed an over
head at break point to fall behind
5-2. McGrath came off the chan
geover and served out a powerful
love game in which Arendt hardly
got her racket on the ball. Stan
ford 4, Florida 0.
The super frosh pumped her
first, let out a "Yes!" and, with
doomsday doubles in reserve, had
essentially guaranteed the title.
All Willens had to do was finish
off Alcini, a task that seemed im
probable when the day began. Al
cini had won an amazing 38
percent of her sets at love this
season by returning every shot
into the middle of the court and
playing mistake-free tennis.
Willens had seen Alcini's
remarkable record and recalled
remarking "That's scary." Still,
she believed she could win. "If
you have any doubt, you're going
to make it come true," she said.
"I never have any doubt even if
I'm playing someone who is sup
posedly better."

Willens came in confident and
clearly came in planning to force
the issue yesterday."I knew I had
to be more aggressive," she said.
Nearly every point ended with a
Willens winner or a Willens error.
In the end, she had more of the
former than the latter and a 6-3,
7-5 victory. Stanford 5, Florida 0.
Farley finished off Birch 7-5,
7-5 but could not dampen the Car
dinal's spirits. The team title was
theirs. That no one can deny.
Card notes
Stanford finished the year 29-0 for
the second straight season. It was the
fourth undefeated season in team his
tory (the others being '82, '84 and
*89). The Cardinal won its four NCAA
matches 6-0, 6-0, 6-1, 5-1. In 1989,
the scores were 9-0, 6-1, 6-0, 5-0.

Brennan was once 185-29 at Stan
ford. He is now 250-29 — a .896
winning percentage.
The individual events begin today-

GAINESVILLE, Fla. — In her first

Heather Willens would not be denied. The
Cardinal freshman came through when it
counted to cap off Stanford's fifth consecu
tive successful national title drive.

Women's Tennis

Cardinal wins

NCAA Title

Saturday, Stanford was ahead of Texas'
4-1 in the semifinals. If Willens could win
her match with the Longhorns' Lanae
Renschler, the Cardinal would clinch the
team victory in singles.
Unfortunately for Stanford, she had al
ready lost the first set 7-5 and was down
4-0 in the second. Willens had dropped six
straight games and seemed to be out of it.
Then, suddenly, she broke Renschler's serve
to make it 4-1. She held and broke again.
In a blur, Willens was up 5-4 and ready
to serve for the second set. But the match
was running long and, since a Willens come
back was anything but assured, the No. 1
doubles match was started.
