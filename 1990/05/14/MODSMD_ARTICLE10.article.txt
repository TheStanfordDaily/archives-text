The Colombian move Friday was in protest

BEIJING (AP) — Senior leader Deng Xiaop
ing met yesterday with Egyptian President

in three months, dispelling the latest rumors
of his death.
A Chinese reporter said on condition of
anonymity that Deng spoke of last week's
rumor on Asian financial markets that he was
dead. "But here I am today," he said.
He said Chinese journalists were told not
to report on the meeting. However, more than
10 hours after the meeting ended, the official
Xinhua News Agency issued a brief report,
saying Deng met Mubarak "as his old friend."
Xinhua also suddenly made a photograph of
the meeting available, after having refused
photo requests earlier in the day.
Coup attempt thwarted
ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) - Sol
diers thwarted a coup attempt yesterday by
routing about 10 armed dissidents who seized
the national radio station and declared the
government overthrown. Three people were
reported killed.
Soldiers stormed the station in An
tananarivo, the capital, several hours after it
was occupied, and arrested the dissidents. No
fighting was reported elsewhere on the Indian
Ocean nation off the east coast of Africa.
Brazil's woes continue
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Signs of
renewed inflation and financial speculation
have created fears in Brazil that a drastic
economic austerity plan launched in mid-
March is running into trouble.
"The full economic picture is not clear but
one thing is: Things are getting worse," said
Alexandre Barros, a political consultant.
Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello
met all weekend with key advisers, and rumors
abounded that new austerity measures would
soon be announced, including tightening credit
and increasing interest rates to hold down the
money supply.
"The government will have to take imme
diate action now, or the situation could spin
out of control," said economist Jose Marcio
Camargo of Rio's Pontifical Catholic Univer
sity. "We may soon be facing a recession with
inflation — the worst of both worlds."
The main concern is inflation, which seemed
under control after President Fernando Collor
de Mello imposed his austerity plan on March
16, a day after he took office.

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — South African black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela yesterday
defended his wife, Winnie, saying she had been
the victim of the "most scandalous persecu
tion" by the government.
It was Mandela's first comment on criticisms
of Mrs. Mandela, one of whose former
bodyguards is on trial in connection with the
kidnapping and killing of a 14-year-old black
activist.
Three men have testified they were abducted
in December 1988 along with the teen-ager
and taken to Mrs. Mandela's Soweto house.
Deng makes appearance
BEIJING (AP) — Senior leader Deng Xiaop
ing met yesterday with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak for his first public appearance
in three months, dispelling the latest rumors
of his death.
A Chinese reporter said on condition of
anonymity that Deng spoke of last week's
rumor on Asian financial markets that he was
dead. "But here I am today," he said.
He said Chinese journalists were told not
to report on the meeting. However, more than
10 hours after the meeting ended, the official
Xinhua News Agency issued a brief report,
saying Deng met Mubarak "as his old friend."
Xinhua also suddenly made a photograph of
the meeting available, after having refused
photo requests earlier in the day.

Brazil's woes continue
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Signs of
renewed inflation and financial speculation
have created fears in Brazil that a drastic
economic austerity plan launched in mid-
March is running into trouble.
"The full economic picture is not clear but
one thing is: Things are getting worse," said
Alexandre Barros, a political consultant.
Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello
met all weekend with key advisers, and rumors
abounded that new austerity measures would
soon be announced, including tightening credit
and increasing interest rates to hold down the
money supply.
"The government will have to take imme
diate action now, or the situation could spin
out of control," said economist Jose Marcio
Camargo of Rio's Pontifical Catholic Univer
sity. "We may soon be facing a recession with
inflation — the worst of both worlds."
The main concern is inflation, which seemed
under control after President Fernando Collor
de Mello imposed his austerity plan on March
16, a day after he took office.
