# Prisoner-for-hostage swap considered
## 
### 
MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -
The commander of Israel's proxy force
in southern Lebanon said yesterday
he is ready to swap a "large number"
of the 300 Moslems held by his militia
for 16 Western hostages held by pro-
Iranian Shiites.
Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army, also included in the trade three
Israeli servicemen and several of his
men held by Shiite factions.
"I'm not only prepared to facilitate
such a package deal, but I also hope
it could happen," Lahd said in an in
terview with The Associated Press at
his single-story stone house in the SLA
compound in Maijayoun.
Lahd, 61, a retired Lebanese army
officer, commands the 3,000-strong
militia that patrols Israel's self
proclaimed security zone in southern
Lebanon. It is backed by about 1,000

Israeli troops.
In Jerusalem, a senior government
spokesman asked about Lahd's offer,
said: "I don't think it depends on Lahd
or on us but on the other side."
Asked if there was any sign of move
ment from the other side, the spokes
man said on condition of anonymity,
"none that I know of."
The SLA holds the 300 Shiites in
Khiam, a small village in Israel's six
to 10-mile-wide security zone, which
stretches from the Mediterranean to
the foothills of Mount Hermon. The
border zone was established in 1985
when Israel ended a three-year occu
pation and withdrew the bulk of its
army from southern Lebanon.
Two American hostages, Robert Pol
hill and Frank Reed, were released by
their pro-Iranian captors last month
as a "goodwill gesture."
Since then, however, there have been

contradictory statements from Iran on
any further releases. President Bush
has refused to deal for freedom for
the hostages, who include six Ameri
cans.
There was no immediate reaction to
Lahd's offer from the pro-Iranian fac
tions holding hostages, from Lebanese
clergymen or from Iran.
Iranian leaders hoping to improve
ties with the West have said all
hostages should be freed this year. But
radicals argue that holding hostages
is a means of confronting the West,
which the anti-Western faction consid
ers a cornerstone of the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
In the past, kidnappers and their
backers have said the release of the
Shiites held by the SLA and Israel
would help end the hostages' ordeal.
They have also said they want help
locating four Iranians missing in

Lebanon since 1982. Lahd did not mer
tion the four, who Lebanese sourct
say are dead.
The kidnappers and their back
have mentioned specifically the rele
of Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a P
bollah official captured by the Isra
in a raid on his village in south
Lebanon last July 28.
Bush recently said that if Isr
wanted to free any prisoners he wou
not object. He also offered to he
locate the four missing Iranians.
Asked if a swap would include Sheik
Obeid, who is held in Israel, Lahd said:
"I cannot specify Obeid or others. But
judging from my dealings with Israel,
I know that if their people were re
leased they will release (detainees).
"If they release our people and the
Israeli servicemen, I'll be able to re
lease a large number from Khiam and
from Israel."
