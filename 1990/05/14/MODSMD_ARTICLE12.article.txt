## Military ordered to take back weapons

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -
About 125,000 farmers who under the
former Sandinista government re
ceived land confiscated from wealthy
landlords will not give up their plots,
a newspaper said yesterday.
On Thursday, the new government
led by President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro announced that landlords
whose property was seized by the San
dinistas will have six months to file
claims.
She also said all unused agricultural
and pasture land will be rented out
on a provisional basis and a commis
sion will study how much rent will be
charged.
"They would have to go over the
cadavers of the cooperative members
and small producers" if the govern
ment tried to take back land, according
to Daniel Nunez, president of the Na
tional Agricultural Workers Union.
"We will not allow the application
of these laws which are totally against
the people," Nunez said. His comments
were published in the pro-Sandinista
Nuevo Diario newspaper.
The U.S.-backed Mrs. Chamorro has
said she will review all laws passed by
the leftist Sandinistas during their 10

years in office. Mrs. Chamorro, who
defeated Daniel Ortega in elections in
February, replaced him April 25.
The Sandinistas handed out weap
ons among supporters before leaving
office, and Mrs. Chamorro has ordered
the military to take back those weap
ons.
Some civilians began turning in
their weapons over the weekend.
Ninety-nine farm workers turned over
their rifles to authorities in La Ver
bena, about 180 miles southeast of
Managua, on Saturday.
Nunez said 50,000 farm union mem
bers will rally outside the presidential
palace to protest Mrs. Chamorro's
decree and demand 10 percent of the
$300 million in U.S. aid earmarked
for Nicaragua be used for farm credits.
During its decade in power, the San
dinistas confiscated and gave away
thousands of privately owned farms.
The Sandinistas on Saturday called
Mrs. Chamorro's decrees "dictatorial
and unconstitutional."
The gOffernment has refused to give
public employees a 200 percent raise
to make up for inflation. Government
workers went on strike last week after
rejecting a government offer.
