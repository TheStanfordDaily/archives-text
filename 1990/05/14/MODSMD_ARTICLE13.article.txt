# Record rains cause flooding in South

HOUSTON, Texas (AP) -
Flooding forced more residents
of low-lying areas to pack up
and leave yesterday in Texas
and Louisiana, and county jail
prisoners and volunteers
labored to reinforce levees with
sandbags in Arkansas.
A steady, heavy downpour
compounded the flood threat
in Louisiana and flooded
streets throughout the New
Orleans area.
Record flooding continued in
Texas, where 7,000 people had
been urged to leave low com
munities along the Trinity
River. The swollen Red River
continued to put pressure on
levees in Arkansas and its flood
crest threatened communities
downstream in Louisiana.
Oklahoma flood victims have
begun cleaning up, except
around gorged Lake Texoma.
The leading edge of the flood
crest on the Trinity had
reached Lake Livingston, north

of Houston. Liberty County of
ficials said yesterday that
water was pouring over the res
ervoir's spillway at a rate of
50,000 cubic feet of water per
second, more than twice nor
mal.
Liberty County Judge
Dempsie Henley said officials
expect the flow to double by
Tuesday. He issued an evacua
tion warning, urging 7,000 res
idents of communities down
stream from the lake's dam to
pack up and leave. Many roads
in the area were already under
water.
Downstream at the town of
Liberty, northeast of Houston,
John Burch and his family
frantically packed clothes and
supplies yesterday. They
worked standing in water to
avoid the many fire ants driven
to high ground by water.
"It hit us hard last year and
it's going to be worse this year,"
said Burch, 32.
