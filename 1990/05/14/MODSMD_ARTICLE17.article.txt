## Celebrating culture 
### 
This weekend's 19th
annual Stanford Powwow
was Stanford's largest mul
ticultural event, the largest event
run by a student group and the
largest event overall, with the ex
ception of athletic events and com
mencement.
Yet, it was organized by only 12
students.
The smallest of Stanford's major
ethnic groups, Native-American
students have put a lot of time
and effort into bringing Native-
American culture and education to
Stanford.
One of the largest Native-
American gatherings on the West
Coast, the powwow brings together
members of the Native-American
community, many of whom have

moved to urban areas and may
have lost touch with their roots.
While the event was organized
by 12 students, the entire 120-
member Native-American commu
nity at Stanford helped with the
preparation. Yet, it should not be
solely up to these few students to
educate the community. The Uni
versity should make an institu
tional commitment to Native-
American culture through Native-
American studies courses.
And, the University, along with
dormitories and departments,
should continue to lend resources
and support to the event so that
the powwow can expose future
generations of Stanford students
and community members to
Native-American culture.
