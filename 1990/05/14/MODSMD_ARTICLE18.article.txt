IT'S EASY to forget just how
good Stanford's women's tennis
team is.
The Cardinal women won the
NCAA championship yesterday.
For the fifth time in a row.
They are the first women's ten
nis team in the history of the sport
to ever win five championships in
a row. And they are only the third
women's collegiate team to win five
championships in a row in any
sport. (Texas' swimming squad and
Utah's gymnastics team are the
other two.)
The 5-1 victory over Florida yes
terday capped off back-to-back un
defeated seasons. The team has not
lost in its last 65 outings.
And there is probably more to
come.
While the team competition
ended yesterday, several Stanford
individual players will be compet
ing this week.
Freshman Meredith McGrath is

favored to win the singles cham
pionship and has a good chance of
combining with teammate Teri
Whitlinger for the doubles title. If
the cards fall in line, McGrath will
be the first ever to win the team,
singles and doubles title all in the
same year.
To say that Coach Frank Bren
nan has built a dynasty at Stanford
is an understatement. His record
stands at 250-29 — a .896 winning
percentage. Over the years, Bren
nan has lured top-notch recruits
to Stanford and has skillfully man
aged to keep the recruits in the
collegiate ranks. For this delicate
balancing feat, he derserves hearty
praise.
And as if all this weren't good
enough: National championships
six and seven will be won at home.
For the next two years, Stanford
plays host to the NCAA champi
onship tournament.
We're looking forward to it.
