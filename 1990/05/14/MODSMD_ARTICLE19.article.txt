Partisan politics stand in way of democratic process

MANY PEOPLE have asked me
why I was involved in organiz
ing the occupation of the
ASSU offices when I have no vested
interest in the outcome of the election.
Well, I do have an interest â€” democ
racy. I would like to see democracy
served. I am tired of the years of
partisan politics that have been
dominating the ASSU.
Ever since the People's Platform
took control of the ASSU Senate three
years ago, every single election has
been marred by scandal. Two years
ago, the Black Student Union lost its
fee assessment on campus. After re
viewing the election it was discovered
that the overseas campuses were ig
nored, so ballots were quickly mailed
and phone calls were made to assure
the passage of the BSU fee assessment.
However, campaigning overseas is
expressly forbidden under the election
Bylaws. This did not seem to matter to
the People's Platform. People protested

this illegal electioneering but no action
was taken by the senate since the
senate was controlled by the People's
Platform.
Last year, the People's Platform
controlled senate decided to rerun the
Student Cconduct Legislative Council
election but not the senate election,
even though the same irregularity
occured in both. Perhaps coincidentally,
the People's Platform had won a large
majority in the senate race but had
failed to win any seats on the SCLC.
This year has seen more scandal.
First was the illegal campaigning
involving the ASSU Resource Guide.
But again, no punitive measures were
taken. Then came the certification
outrage. Even though no slate for COP
received a majority of the votes cast
for COP, the election was certified
with the People's Platform slate being
declared the winner. The legalistic
arguments are lengthy so I will not

digress, but they have been discussed
at length in The Daily and The Stan
ford Review.
The way in which the certification
proceedings took place was an utter
disgrace. There was no regard for
student opinion, democracy or the rule
of law. The People's Platform senators
ignored the Daily poll indicating that
67.5 percent of the student body sup
ported the counting of write-in votes
and then had the hypocrisy to claim
they were representing the students'
voices and acting in the interests of
democracy.
In addition, the proceedings violated
the ASSU Bylaws by settling the ties
in the graduate senate prior to decid
ing the COP race. When this was
brought to the attention of the senate
chair, it was dismissed out of hand and
the proceedings continued as if nothing
had happened.
The People's Platform senators also

claimed that they had to uphold Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Krauss'
decision. But when Krauss said he
would cooperate fully should the senate
decide to go to mediation, the senate
still decided to disregard the notion
altogether.
Last, someone mentioned that media
tion could have been done before and
people could have presented the results
to get all parties to agree to mediation.
Students United for Fair Elections
attempted to get all parties involved to
agree to mediation. All parties did in
fact agree, EXCEPT for the People's
Platform COP-elect and it was felt
mediation would be worthless unless
all sides were represented.
We cannot allow partisan politics to
get in the way of democracy. Enough
is enough and it is time to take a
stand. We must return the ASSU to
the hands of all students.
