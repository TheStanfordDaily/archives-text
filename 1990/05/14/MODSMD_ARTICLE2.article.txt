We are brothers in life, the
Great Spirit planned it, for that
is the way. As the eagle soars
through the sky, and the wolf
pads through the forest, so I
shall walk the way of my
people....
And I will hold fast to my

my people; we are brothers in
Spirit, always striving for life,

for that is the way.

With 20,000 people in attend

capped off a year of preparation

About 20,000 people attended the 19th annual powwow put on
this weekend by the Stanford American Indian Organization.
by the Stanford American Indian
Organization and Native Ameri
can students — preparation that
began during last year's powwow.
Hundreds of student hours
went into preparing for the 19th
annual powwow, said Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Jim Larimore,
a Comanche.
This is the third year the pow
wow has carried the theme "In
Celebration of Indian Sobriety."
According to members of the Pow
wow Committee, the theme is "a
celebration of our culture's tradi
tional values before the introduc
tion of alcohol to our people."
Celebrating this culture was a
group of 400 dancers who com
peted in many categories, includ
ing Traditional, Fancy Shawl,
Jingledress and Grass Dance.
According to senior Tracey
Leßeau, a Cheyenne River Sioux
who danced this weekend, the
style of dancing varies from tribe
to tribe. But she said one element
generally bonds all the Native
American styles of dancing: the
sanctity of the feather.
The feather must not fall ofT
the head of the dancer and touch
the ground, Leßeau said. Ancient
Native American legend instructs
that when a feather touches the
ground, somewhere a warrior
dies.
Many of the dancers wore elab
orate sets of feathers on their
backs, some imitating eagles,
others emulating butterflies. A
few dancers even wore the skins
of wolves draped over their backs
and heads.
At four times throughout the
weekend, all of these dancers —
young and old — paraded into the
circular arena in the "Grand
Entry," a festive display of
pageantry and intertribal coopera
tion.
To non-Native Americans,
much of the music may have
sounded simplistic at first because
it features only the repetitive
choruses of the singers, the beat
of the drums and the rhythmic
jingling of the dancers' bells.

But Native American songs
carry much symbolic meaning in
their simultaneous simplicity and
depth, according to the Bad Med
icine singers from the Kiowa tribe
in Oklahoma.
At times, the arena emptied
while the different groups of sing
ers performed, and soon small
children occupied the circle im
itating the older dancers. Little
girls wore blankets as shawls and
boys carried eagle feathers in
their hands while others just
rolled around in the grass.
Dancers of all ages competed.
Ryan Evans, an 8-year-old Choc
taw from San Francisco, has been
competing for two years. "It's a
lot of fun, but it makes me tired,"
he said, breathing heavily after
an intense dance.
A Nez Perce from Idaho, 65-
year-old Drew Wood said he has
been dancing powwows as long as
he can remember. "I dance the
dance my grandfather taught my
father — the dance my father
taught me," he said.
Skilled dancers such as Wood
knew the songs well and moved
gracefully to the rhythms. Some
spun around wildly, some moved
their feet in intricate patterns and
others swung their arms low like
the eagles whose feathers they
clasped in their hands.
One of the challenges for the
good dancers is to predict when
the song ends — with a brief
flourish of drum beats — and to
conclude their performance
smoothly. The young "Tiny Tot"
dancers, however, usually kept
going a few beats after the songs
ended.
Aside from the dancing, the
powwow presented a few con
trasts. Out of the arena, one
young dancer was wearing not
only a traditional Native Ameri
can costume but also a "New Kids

On The Block" jacket. Booths sel
ling traditional foods such as
"Navsyo Tacos" and "Buffalo
Burgers" sat alongside "Sno-
Cone" stands.
But most of the vendors sold a
wide array of traditional jewelry
and clothing. Mythical "dream
catchers" hung from the top of
some of the vendors' booths.
These magic symbols consist of a
hanging circle which contains a
weblike structure of string, and
attached to the bottom of the
circle is a feather.
According to legend, good
dreams know how to fly through
the hole in the middle and slide
down the feather into the sleeping
person's head. But bad dreams
are caught in the webbing and
die at the first light of day.
Other mythical images of buf
falo, wolves, horses, bears and
eagles permeated the celebration.
The Native American artists at
the powwow each found their own
way of portraying these and other
elements of their culture.
Jacobson, a Choctaw artist and
poet, uses her fingers, charcoal
and birch wood to paint realistic
portraits of Native Americans. "I
study each piece of wood to find
a pattern in the natural grain of
the wood that will enhance each
painting, giving it a life of its
own," Jacobson said.
Another artist, Rod
"Bearcloud" Berry, creates intri
cate color paintings of Native
American landscapes and hides
human and animal forms in the
land and clouds. "I want to put
more than paint in my work —
I want to put feeling in it," Berry
said.
One dancer summed up the
dancers' feelings about their
traditional way of celebration. He
said, "I do not dance for myself;
I dance for you."
We are brothers in life, the
Great Spirit planned it, for that
is the way. As the eagle soars
through the sky, and the wolf
pads through the forest, so I
shall walk the way of my
people....
And I will hold fast to my

my people; we are brothers in

With 20,000 people in attend

capped off a year of preparation

About 20,000 people attended the 19th annual powwow put on
this weekend by the Stanford American Indian Organization.
by the Stanford American Indian
Organization and Native Ameri
can students — preparation that
began during last year's powwow.
Hundreds of student hours
went into preparing for the 19th
annual powwow, said Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Jim Larimore,
a Comanche.
This is the third year the pow
wow has carried the theme "In
Celebration of Indian Sobriety."
According to members of the Pow
wow Committee, the theme is "a
celebration of our culture's tradi
tional values before the introduc
tion of alcohol to our people."
Celebrating this culture was a
group of 400 dancers who com
peted in many categories, includ
ing Traditional, Fancy Shawl,
Jingledress and Grass Dance.
According to senior Tracey
Leßeau, a Cheyenne River Sioux
who danced this weekend, the
style of dancing varies from tribe
to tribe. But she said one element
generally bonds all the Native
American styles of dancing: the
sanctity of the feather.
The feather must not fall ofT
the head of the dancer and touch
the ground, Leßeau said. Ancient
Native American legend instructs
that when a feather touches the
ground, somewhere a warrior
dies.
Many of the dancers wore elab
orate sets of feathers on their
backs, some imitating eagles,
others emulating butterflies. A
few dancers even wore the skins
of wolves draped over their backs
and heads.
At four times throughout the
weekend, all of these dancers —
young and old — paraded into the
circular arena in the "Grand
Entry," a festive display of
pageantry and intertribal coopera
tion.
To non-Native Americans,
much of the music may have
sounded simplistic at first because
it features only the repetitive
choruses of the singers, the beat
of the drums and the rhythmic
jingling of the dancers' bells.

The feather must not fall off the head of the
dancer and touch the ground. Ancient Native
American legend instructs that when a feather

dies.

But Native American songs
carry much symbolic meaning in
their simultaneous simplicity and
depth, according to the Bad Med
icine singers from the Kiowa tribe
in Oklahoma.
At times, the arena emptied
while the different groups of sing
ers performed, and soon small
children occupied the circle im
itating the older dancers. Little
girls wore blankets as shawls and
boys carried eagle feathers in
their hands while others just
rolled around in the grass.
Dancers of all ages competed.
Ryan Evans, an 8-year-old Choc
taw from San Francisco, has been
competing for two years. "It's a
lot of fun, but it makes me tired,"
he said, breathing heavily after
an intense dance.
A Nez Perce from Idaho, 65-
year-old Drew Wood said he has
been dancing powwows as long as
he can remember. "I dance the
dance my grandfather taught my
father — the dance my father
taught me," he said.
Skilled dancers such as Wood
knew the songs well and moved
gracefully to the rhythms. Some
spun around wildly, some moved
their feet in intricate patterns and
others swung their arms low like
the eagles whose feathers they
clasped in their hands.
One of the challenges for the
good dancers is to predict when
the song ends — with a brief
flourish of drum beats — and to
conclude their performance
smoothly. The young "Tiny Tot"
dancers, however, usually kept
going a few beats after the songs
ended.
Aside from the dancing, the
powwow presented a few con
trasts. Out of the arena, one
young dancer was wearing not
only a traditional Native Ameri
can costume but also a "New Kids

On The Block" jacket. Booths sel
ling traditional foods such as
"Navsyo Tacos" and "Buffalo
Burgers" sat alongside "Sno-
Cone" stands.
But most of the vendors sold a
wide array of traditional jewelry
and clothing. Mythical "dream
catchers" hung from the top of
some of the vendors' booths.
These magic symbols consist of a
hanging circle which contains a
weblike structure of string, and
attached to the bottom of the
circle is a feather.
According to legend, good
dreams know how to fly through
the hole in the middle and slide
down the feather into the sleeping
person's head. But bad dreams
are caught in the webbing and
die at the first light of day.
Other mythical images of buf
falo, wolves, horses, bears and
eagles permeated the celebration.
The Native American artists at
the powwow each found their own
way of portraying these and other
elements of their culture.
Jacobson, a Choctaw artist and
poet, uses her fingers, charcoal
and birch wood to paint realistic
portraits of Native Americans. "I
study each piece of wood to find
a pattern in the natural grain of
the wood that will enhance each
painting, giving it a life of its
own," Jacobson said.
Another artist, Rod
"Bearcloud" Berry, creates intri
cate color paintings of Native
American landscapes and hides
human and animal forms in the
land and clouds. "I want to put
more than paint in my work —
I want to put feeling in it," Berry
said.
One dancer summed up the
dancers' feelings about their
traditional way of celebration. He
said, "I do not dance for myself;
I dance for you."
We are brothers in life, the
Great Spirit planned it, for that
is the way. As the eagle soars
through the sky, and the wolf
pads through the forest, so I
shall walk the way of my
people....
And I will hold fast to my
faith, against all who threaten
my people; we are brothers in
Spirit, always striving for life,

for that is the way.
