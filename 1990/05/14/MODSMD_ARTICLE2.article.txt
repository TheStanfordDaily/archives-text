# 20,000 tout tradition at Stanford powwow
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
We are brothers in life, the
Great Spirit planned it, for that
is the way. As the eagle soars
through the sky, and the wolf
pads through the forest, so I
shall walk the way of my
people....
And I will hold fast to my
faith, against all who threaten
my people; we are brothers in
Spirit, always striving for life,

for that is the way.
â€” Donna Jacobson
