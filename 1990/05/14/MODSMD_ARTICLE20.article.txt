# College Republicans lacked sensitivity during GALA week
## 
### 
I was really disappointed to see such
a low turnout at the Parents and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays discus
sion April 10 at Branner Hall. I
counted about 10 people, most of
whom had gay sibling√ü or friends, or
were gay themselves and wanted to
honor this group just for being there.
There was also one brave couple
from the community whose 16-year-old
daughter had just come out to them.
What a shame it is that people don't
consider the fact that they may have a
gay child before the child actually

comes out to them. Anyone who plans
to have children MUST realize that
one of every four families will produce
a gay child. This is a fact. It has noth
ing to do with how the child is raised
or whether the parents are straight or
gay-
The very same evening, the Stanford
College Republicans presented a film
that proposed to show "the truth
about AIDS and how much power ho
mosexuals actually wield," a film full
of misinformation, ignorance and ho
mophobia.
After it was over, the people who
presented the film left the room with
out discussing it, claiming they had a
"previous engagement." It is very sad
that straight people chose to attend
this film and learn nothing but hate
rather than attending the P-FLAG
discussion and learning about compas
sion and understanding and acceptance.

To those who attended the film or
those who stayed at home Thursday
night, I say this: if you plan to have
kids, please think twice when you
decide not to go to a P-FLAG discus
sion being held in your vicinity. It
would mean a lot to your future child.
