# Athletic Department fails to respond to students' needs
## 
### 
My applause to the sharp-thinking
individuals who decided to move the
student section at Stanford Stadium.

Considering how much the Department
of Athletics cried and moaned before
about students' "silence" at games, I
see this as a logical step.
The combination of the change in
seating and the new cheerleaders is a
sure-fire way to make students at least
boo a little louder.
I'm glad Athletic Director Andy
Geiger would prefer to designate the
60-yard line solely for players' parents,
alumni and those who have no affilia
tion with Stanford whatsoever. Once
more, we must ask, "Just who is Stan
ford anyway?"
Once again, the Department of Ath
letics seems to reply, "Not the stu
dents."
They certainly have not made games
"happier for everyone."
