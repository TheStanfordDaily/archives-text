## Settle election, move on 
### 
I'M HAVING A hard time figuring
out this ASSU election debacle. My
initial thought is that it just isn't
that important. Sit-ins? Walking out of
meetings? Recall petitions?
Let's get a little perspective here.
Most of the people I know who even
voted in the election did so because they
wanted to be able to get their fee refund
in the fall — or because supporters of
the two Council of Presidents slates
hassled them outside the doors to the
law school for so long that they voted
just to be able to walk into the law library
in peace.
I mean, it's not as if the legitimacy of
the Western world hangs in the balance.
After all, this was a good, democratic
election — by Central American stand
ards.
The whole Bart Simpson, Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle thing seems like
pretty much of an embarrassment to the
University. It reminds me of the time
Mr. Potatohead ran for mayor of Boise,
Idaho. Yes, some guy in a Mr. Potatohead
costume actually walked the streets,
shaking hands, kissing babies. He lost.
It's not that Mr. Potatohead's venture
into politics wasn't funny. It was. It's
just that with the Aryan Nation staked
out in the north and Steve Symms in
the senate, it's hardly the kind of publicity
Idaho needed.
Ah, but Stanford — that laid-back, non
conformist intellectual bastion nestled on
the San Francisco Bay Peninsula — is
just being cool, clever and downright
witty when it elects Bart Simpson to the

student senate and throws in a few votes
for the turtles.
Cool, clever and downright witty. Some
how I have a hard time believing that
the people who voted for cartoon char
acters were engaged in some sophisticated
form of political protest. Yes, they may
have been saying that student govern
ment at Stanford is a joke, but I doubt
that they really cared who won.
A more likely motivation, it seems to
me, is that the cartoon character sup
porters simply wanted to read election
returns that would prompt a few laughs,
lighten things up a little. Moreover, these
Stanford students probably wanted to
show that they, too, can be in touch with
icons of our mass culture.
But to imbue Bart and the turtles with
a mission of political revolution seems to
be stretching things a bit.
On the other hand, to imbue Dan
Quayle with the stature of national po
litical office seems to be stretching things
a bit, too. Nonetheless, in election after
election, I've learned that most voters
have a sense of priorities — and a sense
of perspective — different from my own.
For a lot of people — the eight students
on the two Council of Presidents
slates, those who hounded students
(potential votes) outside the law school
and other polling sites, those who
protested the certification of the election
— the ASSU election was a serious thing.
They invested time, energy and emotion
in the outcome. They didn't ask anyone
to trivialize the process.
Stanford offers a stupefying number

of opportunities for student involvement
— both a boon for a diverse student body
and a bane for students who choose to
participate in activities that are un
popular or easy to ridicule. If student
government is viewed as nothing more
than a resume-booster, let the students
who choose to govern boost in peace.
If some of us don't care who gets in
volved in student government, we ought
to realize that some of them do. If some
of us think that the question of legitimacy
of student government is hardly relevant,
we ought to realize that to those who do
care about the election? legitimacy is of
the essence.
The longer the election controversy
drags on, the less legitimate is the Four
Our Future slate as the new Council of
Presidents.
So Perry Friedman, bring on your
recall petition. Let's get this thing settled.
Then maybe we can all reassess our
priorities and, among other things, re
member that this first election took place
during Earth Week. We know the slates
— we don't need paper products to help
us decide how to vote.
