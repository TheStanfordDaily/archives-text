## Mental toughness gives Stanford an advantage 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
GAINESVILE, Fla. - Some
vhere in the Great Sports Cook
book there is a page titled, "Recipe
:'or a Dynasty." It reads as follows:
5 Ail-Americans
1 even-tempered coach
Top recruits (if available)
6th singles player who doesn't
lose
A heaping tablespoon of team
unity
Unlimited mental toughness
Given the assemblage of talent
the Stanford women's tennis team

is blessed with, one might think
they can just step on the court
and win every match.
And, oftentimes, they can. Les
ser opponents look at the Cardinal
lineup, roll over and play dead.
Top teams, however, approach
every showdown with Stanford as
a chance to end The Streak, an
opportunity to take down The
Dynasty.
Player for player, some of those
teams appear to be in position to
break through and win. Until they
lose 6-0.

NCAA title.
