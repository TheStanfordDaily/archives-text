## Mental toughness gives Stanford an advantage

book there is a page titled, "Recipe
:'or a Dynasty." It reads as follows:
5 Ail-Americans
1 even-tempered coach
Top recruits (if available)
6th singles player who doesn't
lose
A heaping tablespoon of team
unity
Unlimited mental toughness
Given the assemblage of talent
the Stanford women's tennis team

is blessed with, one might think
they can just step on the court
and win every match.
And, oftentimes, they can. Les
ser opponents look at the Cardinal
lineup, roll over and play dead.
Top teams, however, approach
every showdown with Stanford as
a chance to end The Streak, an
opportunity to take down The
Dynasty.
Player for player, some of those
teams appear to be in position to
break through and win. Until they
lose 6-0.
While Debbie Graham's rocket

r eri Whitiinger was simply perfect — winning every match she
played in four rounds — In helping the Cardinal to Its fifth-straight
NCAA title.
forehands and Meredith
McGrath's devastating overheads
play a role in those blowouts, it
is easy to overlook the mental edge
Stanford has over other teams.
The Cardinal has clinched 51
of the past 58 matches in singles.
In order to do that, nearly every
player needs to win nearly every
time.
"Everyone is so solid. We know
everyone can win," Lisa Green
said. "We just have so much con
fidence in everyone else. It takes
the pressure off."
Said Graham: "When I get on
the court, I feel so confident that
Teri (Whitlinger) or Heather
(Willens) is going to pull out their
match."
The result? While opposing
players take the court feeling like
they have to beat the entire Stan
ford team, the Cardinal women
focus their attention on one thing
— winning their own individual
match.
Various Stanford players noted
that the other team feels like it
has to pull out every close match
to have a chance at a team victory.
When an opponent gets close, they
feel the pressure. I have to win
or we don't have a prayer. Then
they start to crumble.
"You can always tell when it
happens," said Teri Whitlinger,
who has caused many an opponent
to break down mentally. "It's a
great feeling."
Whitlinger cited the experience
of the team as a critical fcator in
honing the mental part of their
game. "A lot of us have been play
ing top level tennis for years," she
said of their days in juniors. "We
got a taste of dealing with [pres
sure] back then.
"At this level, you win mentally
over your opponent," she contin
ued, explaining that almost every

one has all the strokes. "It's who
is mentally tougher. We all believe
we are the most mentally tough."
Said Willens: "We always seem
to pull through in the tough
matches even if we're playing
someone who is a better player."
"We rise to the occasion," Whit
linger noted.
Florida's players sensed it as
well. "They're solid. They know
how to play in big situations —
like the Lakers or the Pistons,"
Amy Alcini said.
"They know what shots to hit
and how to hit them in tough
situations," Holly Danforth
added.
The words are one thing,
evidence is another. Taking the
ability to bounce back from defeat
or struggle as an indicator, con
sider the following;
Green loses 7-5, 6-4 to Texas'
Vickie Paynter in the semifinals.
The next day she destroys Flori
da's Jillian Alexander 6-0, 6-2.
Heather Willens struggles in her
Thursday match with Arizona's
Kyra Johnson.
Friday, she beats Tonya Bog
donas of Georgia 6-1, 6-2. Satur
day, she comes back from 5-7, 0-4
against the Longhorns' Lanae
Renschler. Yesterday, she defeats
the seemingly invincible Alcini of
Florida 6-3, 7-5.
The Gators, on the other hand,
become derailed and fail to get
back on track. Danforth and Holly
Lloyd lose their quarterfinal
matches to USC's Lupita Novelo
and Anya Kochoff.
A day later, each loses to their
UCLA opponent as well. Iwalani
McCalla takes out Danforth in
straight sets. Lloyd takes a set
lead over Cammie Foley then falls
apart when Foley starts feeding
her a steady diet of moonballs.
Incidentally, Jillian Alexander is
beaten by UCLA's Stella Sampras.
Alexander won the first set 6-4
then lost the next two by identical
6-1 scores.
Move ahead to yesterday. Dan

forth can do little right against
Graham. She wins just three
games. Lloyd is equally ineffective
in her match with Whitlinger. She
wins just two games.
Oh, and Alexander pulls a
repeat defeat as well. Green drubs
her 6-0, 6-2.
While most players arrive in col
lege with a fairly fixed level of
mental toughness, a coach can go
a long way toward maintaining it
— or destroying it.
Florida Coach Andy Brandi
berates his players while they are
on the court. "We ought to send
you to the French Open," he
barked at Alexander as Sampras
was taking over the match.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan,
on the other hand, stresses posi
tive reinforcement. Before the
final he told the team to remem
ber what they had accomplished
and just try to play their best.
The message was not cluttered
with remarks chastising the
players for what they failed to do.
The positive atmosphere has
another added benefit as well, es
pecially at NCAAs. Instead of
dividing into factions, the Cardi
nal comes together. "Considering
the egos (on the team), it's
amazing how close we are," Wil
lens said, adding that she feels
stronger mentally than when she
arrived in October. "I can handle
more pressure situations."
Fortunately, there were few for
Stanford over the course of the
tournament, which is par for the
course. "It's really a great time
for team unity," Whitlinger said.
So far the rest of the college
tennis world has been unable to
wipe away that Stanford smile.
In the meantime, they content
themselves with the notion that
Stanford, winner of five straight
national crowns and 65 consecu
tive dual matches, is beatable.
All they've got to do is figure
out how to turn that notion into
reality. «
