# USC solves riddle of Sunken Diamond
## Stanford still takes two of three from Trojans to finish Six-Pac play 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
In the 1990 season, Southern Cali
fornia baseball Coach Mike Gillespie has
been the first — and only — Six-Pac
baseball mind to solve the riddle of the
Stanford baseball team at Sunken Dia
mond. Gillespie's Trojans, coming into
last weekend's Pacific-10 Southern Di
vision season-concluding series at
Sunken Diamond ranked No. 7 in the
nation, defeated the Cardinal 3-2 on
Saturday to blemish an otherwise per
fect conference record at home for the
Cardinal nine this season.

Cardinal wins two

I of three from Trojans

Tied at 2-2 in the top of the ninth,
first baseman Murph Proctor hit
o-out single and stole second base
> move into scoring position. Trojan
miated hitter Jeff Cirillo slapped
in ford reliever Scott Weiss' next pitch
into left field to bring home Proctor.
Trojan pitcher Jackie Nickell, who
relieved starter John Cummings in the
fourth after Cummings gave up two
runs, then struck out Stanford's Troy
Paulsen and David McCarty to come
within an out of his sixth victory of
hi season. Only Stanford clean-up hit
ter Paul Carey — who has 54 career
homers and needs one to break the Pac
10 home run mark currently held by
USC's Mark McGwire and Jeff Hainline
of (ionzaga — remained.
Knowing that Carey has a knack for
ninth-inning dramatic home runs, Gil
lespie decided to visit Nickell at the
n md. The wind on Saturday, blowing
in from right field, had been keeping
(I i) bnils in the park all day, including
a mn h by Carey in the fifth that didn't
ven make the warning track in right
c< titer field. Gillespie wanted Carey, bat
ting from the left side of the plate, to
have to hit into the wind.

"We didn't want him to get a pitch
he could go to left on," Gillespie said.
Good idea. But Nickell didn't agree
and threw Carey an outside pitch that
Carey knocked high to left field. Though
the ball was carried by the wind, Trojan
left fielder Mike Robertson had room
to squeeze it for the final out and the
victory.
"We dodged a bullet," a relieved Gil
lespie said afterward.
Starter Mike Mussina scattered seven
hits through six innings of work and
left with a 2-1 lead that Weiss could
not hold. Coming on in relief in the
seventh, Weiss gave up a double to
Trojan leadoff man Damon Buford, who
took third on a wild pitch and scored
tagging up when Proctor flied to right
field the next at-bat to tie the game at
2-2.
"I though [Weiss] pitched all right,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said
after the loss. "He just threw a couple
of bad pitches and they hit them."
Nickell completely shut down Stan
ford in his five and a third innings of
relief, conceding only three hits and
working out of a jam in the seventh.
Paulsen and McCarty each singled to
start a rally, but Nickell struck out
Carey, got Griffin to fly to center field,
and, after walking pinch hitter David
Holbrook to load the bases, forced Ryan
Turner to ground into a fielder's choice
at second.
Yesterday, Stanford catcher Troy
Tallman knocked a two-run homer deep
over the left-field fence in the third
inning to lead a nine-hit, six-run Stan
ford effort that avenged Saturday's loss.
McCarty added a monstrous solo homer
in the sixth, and USC shortstop Billy
Morris's failure to turn a routine
grounder into a double play allowed
Stanford to score three more runs in
the seventh inning.
Cardinal starter John Reid pitched
the full nine innings, scattering six
Trojan hits and conceding only one un
earned run for his fifth victory. Reid's
curve ball stymied the Trojan hitters

all day long.
"He doesn't throw as hard [as some
pitchers] but he's deceptively quick,"
Tallman said of Reid. "His stuff was
really breaking today. They were either
swinging through his pitches or were
out in front."
"I feel great," Reid said afterward.
"This is my first complete game of the
year and it couldn't come at a better
time. I'd rather pitch well going into
regionals than early on in the season."
After two good outings in a row, Reid
is solidifying his hold on the third start
ing position. Brian Sackinsky, who has
also pitched third in the rotation this
season, demonstrated his value as a long
reliever on Friday, coming in for starter
Stan Spencer, who gave up only one
USC run through five innings.
(Marquess had Spencer on a 75 pitch
limit to rest his arm so that he will be
rested enough to pitch on a shorter
turnaround time during regionals.)
Sackinsky had perhaps his best outing
of the year, giving up four hits, walking
only one batter and striking out seven
for the win.
The Cardinal won Friday's ballgame
in the ninth when first baseman Todd
French slapped a triple over USC center
fielder John Jackson, who crashed into
a support post in the outfield fence.
Jackson collapsed and French raced
around the basepaths.
Trojan right fielder Mark Smith raced
over to Jackson and fielded the ball as
French rounded for home. The relay
was wide of the plate, but French lost
his balance, fell and had to scamper
back to safety at third.
Time was called and Jackson re
mained down in center field. After a
twenty minute delay, Jackson was taken
from Sunken Diamond in an ambulance.
A talented wide receiver for USC last
season who was selected in April's Na
tional Football League draft, Jackson
fortunately suffered only severe bruises
to his back and ribs.


Catcher Troy Tallman was quite proficient at the plate - as well aa behind the plate
.7~X e,te I day ' B,amm,n Q ■ two-run homer to help the Card nine to a 6-1 downing of
USC at Sunken Diamond yesterday.
When play resumed, starter
Randy Powers, who until then had
given up only four hits, intention
ally walked Carey and third base
man Tim Griffin to get to
Holbrook. With the infield playing
in, Holbrook bounced a 1-2 pitch
back up the middle to score the
game-winning run.
Stanford's two wins this past
weekend bring its home record to
25-3. As Six-Pac champion and
the current No. 1 team in the
country, Stanford is bidding to
host one of the NCAA's eight re
gional tournaments, the sites of
which will be announced today by

the regional selection committees.
The selection committee, how
ever, is rumored to be unim
pressed with Sunken Diamond as
a regional site because of its lim
ited seating capacity and its lack
of lights (which would necessitate
early morning games to complete
the eight-team double elimination
tournament.) Consequently, Stan
ford may have to travel to the
regional in which it is the top
seed in spite of its incomparable
home and overall record.
"We all have our hearts set on
[hosting the regional]" Reid said
after yesterday's game. "We'd all
pretty much rather host and play
in the morning then have to travel
across the country."
"To win 24 games in this con
ference is really incredible," Mar

quess said. "It is a credit to the
players. They've worked hard and
they deserve it."
Card notes
Jackson recovered sufficiently from
his Friday injury to play an inning
in the outfield yesterday, recording a
put-out on Tallman's fly ball to center
in the eighth inning. .. . The Statistic
of-the-Weekend Award goes to K2SU
play caller Pat Broun, who noted yes
terday that when Roger Burnett broke
his belt buckle diving back into first
base on Phil Kendall's pickoff move
in the third inning, it was the fourth
time in the 1990 season that a Stan
ford player has needed a new belt
during the course of a game. ... Carey
set a Pac-10 record on Sunday, playing
in his 256 th career game, eclipsing
Arizona Wildcat Chip Hale
