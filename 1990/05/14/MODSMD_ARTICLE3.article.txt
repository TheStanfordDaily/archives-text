# Mahoney to fill new vice presidency
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
In one of the first organiza
tional changes resulting from the
budget "repositioning" process,
Provost James Rosse announced
the creation of a position of vice
president for student resources
Friday.
Sally Mahoney, who is currently
the University registrar, will be
the acting vice president. Ma
honey will be responsible for es
tablishing the office and will
retain the position until a perma
nent vice president can be found.
Although the exact responsibil
ities of the new position have not
yet been determined, Rosse said
the vice president will probably
oversee the Offices of Student Af
fairs, the Registrar, Admissions,
Financial Aid, Housing and Food
Service, and the Bursar.
In addition, the office will su
pervise some of the student serv
ice functions of the Offices of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and the Dean of Graduate
Studies, such as graduate admis
sions and advising, Rosse said.
The academic functions of these

offices will not be incorporated
into the new vice presidency.
The heads of all of these offices
will report directly to the vice
president, who will report to the
provost. By centralizing all of the
departments under one person,
Rosse said he hopes student re
sources will be streamlined and
more effective.
Mahoney said one of the
reasons for creating the position
was that while Stanford "has a
wide array of services, they have
not been organized in a particu
larly coherent manner."
Currently, the various student
service offices report to several
different University officials. For
example, the dean of student af
fairs reports directly to the pres
ident, while the dean of
undergraduate admissions and
the registrar report to the provost.
At the public announcement of
her appointment, Mahoney said
she had some mixed feelings
about the new position. She said
she welcomed the opportunity but
noted there is some uncertainty
about the reorganization of stu
dent services.
Rosse said he hoped the an

nouncement of the new position
"reduces some of the anxiety by
showing the direction" the Uni
versity plans to go in this area.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who plans to retire at the
end of the year, said he supported
the decision. The budget
repositioning process presents an
opportunity to look at how stu

dent services should be organized
in the future, Lyons said. "It
would have been irresponsible
simply to replace me," he added.
Assoc. Dean for Residential Af
fairs Norm Robinson will be the
acting dean of student affairs until
a permanent replacement is
found.
Rosse said the responsibilities
of the vice president of student
resources will probably be
clarified over the summer and
should be established by Sept. 1.
He said he expects the search
for the the permanent vice pres
ident to begin in early 1991. The
search for a new dean of student
affairs will probably begin some
time this fall.
Mahoney said one of her goals
is to strengthen a system of serv
ices that is immediately respon
sive to students and their needs.
Robert Gregg, dean of Memorial
Church and chair of the Action
Plans for Change committee
which recommended the creation
of the new position, said he hopes
there will be more "perceived co
herence" between the schools and
the new vice president.
