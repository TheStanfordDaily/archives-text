## Football bows out till summer with Cardinal and White scrimmage 
### Debbie Spander Editorial staff 
Chalk it up as a victory for Cardinal
football.
Of course, Stanford was playing
against itself on the gridiron, but in
the big scheme of thingß, that wasn't
what really mattered.
In its second spring under Coach
Denny Green, the squad completed ail
of its goals — finding a starting quar
terback, selecting first-string running
backs, and filling gaps in the offensive
and defensive lines —• and even managed
to score a touchdown in the Cardinal
and White game Saturday in Stanford
Stadium.

"We got everything accomplished that
we wanted to this spring and we're
really pleased with it," Green said,
"We're content with the offense, we like
the players we have on defense, and we
didn't have many guys missing prac
tices."
In addition to selecting Jason
Palumbis from the three currently en
rolled quarterbacks and choosing senior
Jon Volpe and Oklahoma-transfer Glyn
Milburn from the Cardinal's numerous
and talented backfield prospects, Green
and his staff also tailored the squads'
defensive style.
"It (defense) is a faster team, a pur
suit team. The speed is going to blend
in well with the faster paced, up-tempo
type of defense we're going to play."
Green said. "The defense is going to
run."
The squad feels its progress this
spring indicates that it can, indeed, keep
up with one of the toughest schedules
in football next fall. Stanford plays five
top-10 squads, including 1989 national
runner-up Notre Dame and last season's
No. 3 squad Colorado on the road.
"I think we accomplished what we
wanted to," wide receiver Ed McCaffrey

said. "The offense really came on at the
end of spring (practice) — it looks the
best it has since my freshman year
(when the Cardinal played in the Gator
Bowl). We definitely have a tough, tough
schedule. We have our work cut out for
us, but winning against those type of
teams is what makes football fun."
Oh yeah, the offense (Cardinal) beat
the defense (White) 19-18 in the tradi
tional end-of-spring-practice intra
squad scrimmage Saturday. Don't ask
how the scoring is tabulated — even
the scorers weren't too sure. But when
the smoke cleared it was Palumbis-and
gang over their none-too-friendly team
mates by way of a last second Palumbis
to McCaffrey touchdown on the final
series of the scrimmage.
Once the offense got its act together,
Palumbis did show that Green made a
wise quarterback selection — going 6-
for-9 for 76 yards and the six-yard scor
ing toss to McCaffrey. John Lynch and
Steve Smith were a combined 4-for-11.
The White squad definitely had the
upper hand most of the scrimmage,
however, hindering the Cardinal from
making much progress during the first
half (four drives) and recording a sack
as well as four tackles for losses.
"The defense really played well," Mil
burn said. "They were really aggressive
and caught us by surprise." That com
ing after Green announced to the 1200
in attendance that it's "not likely for
anyone to surprise anyone."
To the offense'B defense, (no pun in
tended) the squad was holding about
75 percent of its plays, both on the
ground in and through the air, under
wraps, as Colorado scouts (the Cardi
nal's first opponent) were among those
in the stands. Palumbis looked in con
trol, and McCaffrey (42 yards on two
catches, 1 TD), Chris Walsh (one recep
tion for 25 yards) and Jon Pinckney
(14 yards on one catch) seem to be the
targets to look for during the upcoming
season.
"Jason is throwing better than I've
ever seen him throw," McCaffrey said.
Green had a little to add about McCaf
frey. "I'm looking for [McCaffrey] to be

an Ail-American next year. He had the
best spring of anyone."
Not to be outdone, the backfield
picked the running game up a notch
during the second as well, finding holes
and helping the squad to some key first
downs. Tommy Vardell (featured on this
season's football poster with the 1990
theme "Off and running") picked up 33
yds. on five attempts, Milburn slashed
for 30 more, Miami-transfer Ellery
Roberts powered for 13 big ones on
three carries and the almost-healthy
Volpe chugged for 12 during the little
time he was allowed on the field.
"Guys like Glyn, Ellery and Tommy
make my job a lot easier," Palumbis
said. "Those guys take the pressure off
and will help us accomplish what we
want to do."
"The running game is really coming
on strong," McCaffrey added.
Others have noticed as much, includ
ing the Sports Information Office which
promotes the on-the-ground aspect of
the Cardinal's game in its pre-season
giveaway.
So coach, what is a traditionally pass
oriented school doing highlighting its
running game on its poster?
"We'll throw the ball — you need the
pass to be close in games — but you
can't win unless you run the football.
We'll definitely be running as well."
Now it's time to sit back and just
wait for Sept. 6 to roll around.
Card notes
Former star halfback Charlie Young, who
missed last season due to injuries to both
knees, was on the sideline for the scrimmage,
and is planning on being ready to suit-up
by summer.
The referees were in fine "mid-season"
form, blowing the whistle almost as many
times as the offense made it to the line of
scrimmage.
KCBS broadcaster Bob Murphy was as
verbose as usual, interviewing Green on the
PA. system both before and after the scrim
mage, and calling the key figures for every
play, sometimes before he had quite figured
out who they were. ... Only one incoming
freshman received credit for a tackle.
