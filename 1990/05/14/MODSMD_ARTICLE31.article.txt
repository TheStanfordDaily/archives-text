# Cheerleaders to cost Band little
## 
### Michelle Lin 
"It's not a big deal," said soph
omore David Nicks, treasurer of
the Stanford Band, regarding the
Department of Athletics' decision
last week to fund the new 23-
person cheerleading squad at the
expense of the Band and Dollies.
The Band, which receives ap
proximately $42,000 every year
from the Athletics Department,
will have to allocate about $5,000
of this money to the cheerleading
squad next year, according to Ath
letic Director Ajidy Geiger.
However, the decision to have
the cheerleaders share the Band's
Athletics Department funding was
"expected and anticipated," said
senior Linda Kay Brown, the
Band's manager.
She explained that the Band
was the only support group for
athletic events in past years. With
the new cheerleading squad, an
other athletic support group, the
Band seemed to be the most logi
cal source of funding, she said.
The Band's income does not
come only from the Athletics De
partment, Nicks noted. In fact,
money from the Athletics Depart-

ment primarily
funds the Band's
travel expenses.
The Band's
ASSU special fee
covers its operat
ing expenses, and
the Music De
partment pays for
some of the in
strument repairs,
Nicks said.

The cut by the Athletics De
partment would affect the Band
and the Dollies "very little, if
any," said Geiger.
"From what I know, I see no
bad financial effect on the Band,"
said Nicks. "As treasurer, I'm not
worried about it."
According to freshman cheer
leader Aaron Poirier, "From what
I have heard, the Band will not
be affected that much." In fact,
having cheerleaders will "bring
more money to athletics and the
school," he said.
Freshman Amy Pohorence, cap
tain of the cheerleading squad and
leader of the effort to bring a
squad to Stanford, said she has
"no clue" whether $5,000 is
enough for the cheerleaders next

year or how it will be spent. Co
ordinators of the cheerleading
program will meet today to
determine this.
Some Band members were not
as sanguine about the plan. "I'm
not too happy about the cut, but
I don't want to sound like I'm
against the cheerleaders," said
senior Jeff Alexander, a trumpet
player in the Band. "I just feel
like the managers were not con
sulted about it."
"In general, this year is a par
ticularly bad year for the cheer
leaders to come," said freshman
Noelle Kovach, one of the Dollies.
"The budget cuts have forced the
Athletics Department to cut back,
and the athletes are not too happy
about it. Meanwhile, the cheer
leading squad appears. There will
be resentment from the athletes
even before [the cheerleaders]
have a chance."
Although there may be some
disagreement between Band mem
bers and cheerleaders about the
financial situation, "there
shouldn't be any conflicts on the
field," said freshman Denise Mar
tinez, another member of the
Dollies.
