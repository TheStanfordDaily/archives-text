# COP recall election looking likely
## 
### Kaarin Michaelsen 
Only a few hundred more signatures are required
to turn Students United for Fair Elections' hopes
for a recall of the recently elected Council of Presi
dents into a reality.
The group is circulating a petition calling for the
recall of the COP election to show the student
body's dissatisfaction with the "partisan politics in
the election process," said group member Perry
Friedman, a first-year graduate student.
Joining their effort are members of Students First,
the party whose COP slate lost the election.
The petition is required to have 1,950 signatures,
15 percent of the student body, before it can be
turned over to Elections Commissioner Steve Krauss
for verification.
As of yesterday, Students United for Fair Elections
had "about 1,180 signatures handed in and several
hundred that are still outstanding," said Friedman.
Students First also has a number of signatures

collected but has not tallied them yet.
The need to get the signatures collected fairly
quickly is due to Article 4, Section 2 of the ASSU
Constitution, which states, "The Elections Commis
sioner shall .. . conduct a recall election .. . not
less than 10 nor more than 21 days" after he has
verified that the signatures are valid.
"If we don't get [the signatures! in by the middle
of the week, there's no way we could realistically
expect to have a recall election this year. Due to
what the rule says about the time limitations in
scheduling [a recall], we'd be running into Dead
Week or finals. It might have to be pushed over
into next year," said Friedman.
The recall election could also be postponed until
next year because the constitution further states
that any petition submitted within 35 days of the
end of the quarter, as this petition will be, may be
postponed for a vote until the following quarter at
the ASSU Senate's discretion.
