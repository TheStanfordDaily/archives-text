Lyons to announce budget cuts
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons will re
lease information about revised budget cut pro
posals for the departments within the Office of
Student Affairs today.
Lyons has received preliminary proposals from
all of the Student Affairs departments and is
now in the process of compiling the final proposed
budget cuts for the office. The overall Student
Affairs budget cut was projected to be 15 percent.
The final budget cut proposals for Student
Affairs and most other University departments
will be submitted to Provost James Rosse and
the budget repositioning steering committee Fri
day.
An open forum on the proposed Student Affairs
budget cuts will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday in
Law School room 180. Lyons and several of the
Student Affairs department heads will attend,
according to ASSU senator Sophia Shing, a co
ordinator of the forum.

Sample primaiy ballots sent
The Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters
has mailed out ballots for the upcoming June 5
statewide primary election.
Due to a recent mandated voter purge, many
registered voters have been deleted. If you believe
you are registered to vote and have not received
a sample ballot, call the registrar's office at (408)
298-7400 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday
through Friday.
Education prof, dies at 81
Education Emeritus Prof. James MacConnell,
an international authority on school planning,
died last week of a cardiovascular incident in the
swimming pool of his Portola Valley home.

MacConnell is best remembered for his work
as the director of Stanford's School Planning
Laboratory, which he founded in 1951.
During the 19405, '50s and '60s, MacConnell
battled the rising costs of "baby boom" school
construction with what some termed the "erector
set" approach to school planning.
Keeping a steady focus on and alliance with
the taxpayer, he designed schools to give more
space for the dollar. MacConnell pioneered the
use of peg-board walls, modular space, moveable
partitions and, later, closed-circuit television to
expand the classroom.
In addition to his work with school facilities,
MacConnell was an outspoken advocate of
keeping education relevant and up-to-date with
the rapid change of the post-war decades.
A memorial service will be held in Cubberley
Auditorium in the School of Education, Saturday
at 2 p.m.
Biology prof, given 2 awards
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert Sapolsky, who
studies the physiology and pathophysiology of
stress through laboratory and field studies, has
been given two awards.
Saplosky was among the first to demonstrate
that glucocorticoids and stress can damage brain
cells. For three months each year he travels to
the Serengeti in East Africa to study the rela
tionship between patterns of stress-related dis
eases and dominance rank, social behavior and
personality in wild baboons.
His work has earned him the A. E. Bennett
Award for his manuscript titled "Adrenodcortical
Funcion, Social Rank and Personality among Wild
Babboons."
He had also received the Richter Award, which
is presented to the Young Investigator of the
Year for the International Society of Psyc
honeuroendocrinologists.
