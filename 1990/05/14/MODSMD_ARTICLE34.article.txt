# Fraternities above total quota
## 
### Tammy Sun 
Reaping successful results from
its spring Rush, preliminary fig
ures indicate that the entire Stan
ford fraternity system is above its
total quota for new pledges this
year.
The fraternity system has re
ceived a total of 287 pledges —
32 percent of male freshmen and
a huge increase over last year's
figure of 22 percent, according to
junior Erik Jorgensen, Interfra
ternity Council Rush chair.
Jorgensen attributed the in
crease in pledges this year to the
"networking" done by individual
members of the fraternities with
the non-Greek community even
before spring Rush began. "The
fraternities have made a more
responsive effort to break down
the rumors and myths surround
ing the Greek community," Jor
gensen said.
Individual housed fraternities,
including Beta Theta Pi, Kappa
Alpha, Theta Delta Chi and Theta
Xi, still remain behind in their
quota points. However, Theta Xi
is exempt from its quota this year
because it was disadvantaged by
not having a house for Rush par
ties. Fraternities can decide to
continue rushing informally until
June to fulfill their quota points.
This is the third year in a row
that the Theta Delts failed to meet
their quota.
Although the fraternities under
quota this year are in no imme
diate jeopardy of losing their

houses, they are still "concerned
because in the long run they may
be in danger of having their house
put into the Draw," said senior
Dan Nash, Rush coordinator for
housed fraternities.
Each fraternity has a different
quota to meet, recommended by
the Row Office. In the quota sys
tem, applicable to housed frater
nities only, a freshman is counted
as one point and sophomores are
considered half a point because
they possess fewer years of guar
anteed housing.
A housed fraternity is in danger
of being considered for placement
in the Draw by the Row Office if

it is under quota three out of four
years. However, the University
rarely "scrutinizes" individual
fraternities when the fraternity
system as a whole reaches its
quota, according to junior Todd
Ortega, IFC president.
Furthermore, if the entire fra
ternity system does not make
quota in two consecutive years,
then the fraternity with the lar
gest deficit over the past few years
will be considered for Draw place
ment. However, a fraternity which
has lost its house previously has
a chance to regain it in years when
the fraternity system is over
quota.
