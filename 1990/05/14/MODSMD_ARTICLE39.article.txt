# Kennedy speech tonight to kick off Rape Awareness Week
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
Efforts by various organiza
tions to educate the Stanford com
munity about sexual assault
culminate today with the begin
ning of Rape Awareness Week.
Each day this week through
Thursday, a series of "brown-bag
lunch" discussions and nightly
speeches and panels will focus on
issues surrounding rape.
Rape Awareness Week was or
ganized by the Rape Education
Project, along with Project HEAR
(Heightened Education on Ac
quaintance Rape), the Stanford
Police Department and the Inter
fraternity Council. Individual
events have co-sponsors as well.
Although this year's Rape

Awareness Week will be "a little
more low-key" than last year's,
which was the first one, aware
ness of rape in general is now
much higher, according to co
coordinator Beth Davidow, a
junior.
Since the release of the results
of the Rape Education Project's
1988 survey on sexual assault on
campus — during last year's Rape

Awareness Week — and the sub
sequent creation of the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, "all
of a sudden the University recog
nized that there was a problem,"
said Davidow.
In fact, with his opening re
marks for the week tonight, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
will be making his first public
statement about rape on campus.
Davidow said it was "sig
nificant" that Kennedy agreed to
make some remarks, although he
is withholding an official Univer
sity statement on rape until he
receives recommendations from
the task force, which will complete
its work in November.
"Recognizing and addressing
the issue is the best thing [Ken
nedy] can do at this point," ac

cording to Davidow.
