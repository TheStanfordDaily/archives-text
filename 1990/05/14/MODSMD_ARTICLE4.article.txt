# Tears and trauma: It's time for the Draw
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Editorial staff 
Starting today, Stanford students will
once again undergo the annual tribulation
of the Draw. Like a bad practical joke, the
Draw provides a double dose of distress
for students.
First, one must decide with whom to
draw. With a maximum of eight people per
group, someone inevitably gets the boot.
Frequently, the Draw ends friendships on
a note of betrayal. "I know people who are
crying about it," said freshman Jennice
Torres.
Many students try to deal with Draw
groups from a pragmatic view. "There was
no stress among our group," claimed Adele
Cooper, a freshman. "It just meant there
could only be eight of us." Yet, with the
emphasis on who draws with whom and
where, the importance of Draw groups is
unavoidable.
After going through a stressful Draw
last year, sophomore Lee Ould viewed the
composition of his Draw group as more
important than his Draw number. "1 think
it matters who you live with," said Ould,
"not where you live."
Roble Hull Resident Fellow Evan Porteus
said he thinks one of the hardest aspects
of the Draw is the reluctance of students
to be honest about their preferences for
Draw partners. Looking at the positive side.

he said, "There's probably some learning
and growth in going through that stress."
Another source of trouble arises from
the selection of those magical eight
"residence preferences."
Most people can agree on their dream
picks: 558, Roble, Storey, Toyon. The real
problems kick in when a group must come
to a consensus on its remaining choices.
According to freshman Ileana Perez, "All
my best friends have different preferences."
Where students have lived this year
seems to have a direct effect on where they
want to live next fall. Referring to her
Draw group's hopes of living in the west
residences next year, Lolly Ward, a fresh
man, said, "We're such west campus people.
We lived here as freshmen and don't know
anything about east campus."
On the other hand, many students are
anxious to try new living arrangements. "I
don't want to live in the same dorm again,"
said freshman Allison Deal. "Most fresh
men who live in Roble want to live here
again. We considered it, but shot it down
pretty quickly."
In an effort to improve their chances for
drawing into certain houses, many students
seek priorities. To get most priorities stu
dents must sign a house agreement stating
that they are aware of the duties each
student living in the residence must fulfill.
However, to get certain
priorities, more than just your
John Hancock is required.
The American Studies House
requires prospective residents to
submit a proposal for a theme
project. Toyon Hall's require
ments for a priority have been
among the more controversial this
year. Unlike in previous years,
students desiring to receive a pri

ority to live in Toyon must now
work for an hour in one of the
Toyon Eating Clubs.
Deal objected to having to work
to get a Toyon priority on the
grounds that "the work wasn't
equally divided."
The type of tasks required also
raised the ire of some students.
"We scrubbed under the soda ma
chine," said freshman Jenny
Weidwald, "which had a horren
dous odor which we smelled all
day. There were stalagmites of
sticky syrup."
Eating Clubs president Deborah

Senior Tracy Young is fearful of ending
up in the 'M-words' â€” Mirrielees House
and Manzanita Park.

Kelly said the new requirement
was instituted to make prospec
tive Toyon residents aware that
the clubs are not the same as
regular food service. "We're really
interested in having people who
want to be a part of a self-op,"
said Kelly.
She emphasized that the new

requirement is not aimed at
changing Toyon's popularity in
the Draw, but in eliminating po
tential disappointment with the
eating clubs. "I think we would
have much less dissatisfaction,"
concluded Kelly, "if people were
aware of how the clubs work. .. .
Happy club members keep the

place cleaner and locked."
Beyond those students hoping
to get into a popular residence are
those drawing unguaranteed.
Senior Tracy Young is fearful of
ending up in the "M-words," Mir
rielees House and Manzanita
Park. "I've been mighty lucky so
far," said Young. "I'm holding my
breath in anticipation of going un
guaranteed."
For others, drawing unguaran
teed takes a lot of the mystery
out of the type of housing they
will receive. "Being unguaranteed
gives you a totally different atti

tude going into the Draw," said
Ould.
Just getting a spot in housing
seems to be enough for some stu
dents. "As long as you're on
campus," said Young, "you're
pretty well off."
Will the blind justice of the
Draw sentence you to a bunker
like Stern or a country club like
Governor's Corner? Will your
friends still be your friends after
the Draw groups have been cho
sen? These are the questions that
students dread to have answered
this week.
