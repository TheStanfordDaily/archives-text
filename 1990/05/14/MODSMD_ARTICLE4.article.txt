# Tears and trauma: It's time for the Draw
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Editorial staff 
Starting today, Stanford students will
once again undergo the annual tribulation
of the Draw. Like a bad practical joke, the
Draw provides a double dose of distress
for students.
First, one must decide with whom to
draw. With a maximum of eight people per
group, someone inevitably gets the boot.
Frequently, the Draw ends friendships on
a note of betrayal. "I know people who are
crying about it," said freshman Jennice
Torres.
Many students try to deal with Draw
groups from a pragmatic view. "There was
no stress among our group," claimed Adele
Cooper, a freshman. "It just meant there
could only be eight of us." Yet, with the
emphasis on who draws with whom and
where, the importance of Draw groups is
unavoidable.
After going through a stressful Draw
last year, sophomore Lee Ould viewed the
composition of his Draw group as more
important than his Draw number. "1 think
it matters who you live with," said Ould,
"not where you live."
Roble Hull Resident Fellow Evan Porteus
said he thinks one of the hardest aspects
of the Draw is the reluctance of students
to be honest about their preferences for
Draw partners. Looking at the positive side.

he said, "There's probably some learning
and growth in going through that stress."
Another source of trouble arises from
the selection of those magical eight
"residence preferences."
Most people can agree on their dream
picks: 558, Roble, Storey, Toyon. The real
problems kick in when a group must come
to a consensus on its remaining choices.
According to freshman Ileana Perez, "All
my best friends have different preferences."
Where students have lived this year
seems to have a direct effect on where they
want to live next fall. Referring to her
Draw group's hopes of living in the west
residences next year, Lolly Ward, a fresh
man, said, "We're such west campus people.
We lived here as freshmen and don't know
anything about east campus."
On the other hand, many students are
anxious to try new living arrangements. "I
don't want to live in the same dorm again,"
said freshman Allison Deal. "Most fresh
men who live in Roble want to live here
again. We considered it, but shot it down
pretty quickly."
In an effort to improve their chances for
drawing into certain houses, many students
seek priorities. To get most priorities stu
dents must sign a house agreement stating
that they are aware of the duties each
student living in the residence must fulfill.
