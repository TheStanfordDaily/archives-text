# Dining hall stripper prompts questioning of food service policy
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Editorial staff 
A recent incident involving a stripper
has left many Sterling Quad residents
angry and confused about the role of
dining hall managers in permitting pro
gramming during meals.
Several students hired the stripper to
surprise a hasher during a lunch shift
at Ricker Dining Center last Tuesday.
Ricker serves the four dormitories of
Sterling Quad, including Robinson
House, the gender issues focus house.
In an open letter distributed in the
dining hall, Sue Peletta, the hall's man

ager, said she had been contacted in ad
vance by the students and she "suggested
that there would be some people that
would be offended â€” but did not feel
[she] had the authority to prevent the
event from occurring."
When the stripper began her perform
ance and no dining hall staff took any
action, some students walked out in dis
gust.
Traditionally, dining hall managers
have not been involved in determining
the content of programs taking place in
halls under their jurisdiction.
But after numerous complaints about
the unexpected presence of the stripper,

University officials are planning to pro
vide a develop that would enable them
to prevent or intervene in potentially of
fensive situations.
Keith Guy, director of housing and food
services, said he was uncertain what form
of prior review of events might be created.
"The tricky part of this is that we're
trying to be sensitive (to issues of freedom
of speech and freedom from harassment)
in our thinking about clearer guidelines,"
Guy said. The policy would most likely
go into effect this fall, he added.
In response to the incident, several stu
dents organized a "women's empower
ment picnic" Friday. About 75 students,

most of them women, ate lunch on the
lawn in front of Ricker, in an environment
that was intended to help students cope
with sexism.
"We fight sexism every day, but in this
space, in this hour you can feel supported,
refreshed and above all, reunited with
your women friends," said junior Jill
Banatoski, one of the organizers of the
picnic.
Nora Cain, the resident fellow of Rob
inson, added, "I felt really violated that
I couldn't count on having lunch in my
own dining hall . . . without the comfort
of knowing that I won't be assaulted by
sexism at such a gross level."

Food service workers probably would
have reacted quickly if the incident had
been racially inflammatory, Cain said.
But Sue Stevens, assistant manager of
Ricker, said there was no policy that
clearly delineated the responsibilities of
food service workers in such a situation.
Stevens added she might have wor
sened the situation by intervening.
"When I looked around, people were
laughing and they were clapping, and
smiling and all of that," Stevens ex
plained. "I could have had a lot of senti
ment against me and against Food Service
for determining what should go on
there."
