# Stanford's housing Draw one of a kind
## 
### Allison Shue 
Residential colleges, upperclass priority and
returning resident priority determine housing
assignments at colleges across the country.
Stanford's Draw system is unique among
the 17 schools surveyed by The Daily, although
many use similar lottery systems.
More than a third of the schools house their
students in residential colleges. These dor
mitory areas serve as the hub of living and
socializing for most students.
Freshmen at Yale University and Rice Uni
versity are assigned to a residential college for
four years. At Yale, each of the 12 colleges
selects a committee of students, supervised by
a dean, which designs an in-house room as
signment process.
At Rice, with three years of housing guar
anteed, policies vary. One of the eight resi
dential colleges may require all sophomores or
juniors to live off-campus, while another may
grant room priority to those who have lived
off-campus.
