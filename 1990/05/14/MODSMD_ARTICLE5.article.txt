# Stanford's housing Draw one of a kind

Residential colleges, upperclass priority and
returning resident priority determine housing
assignments at colleges across the country.
Stanford's Draw system is unique among
the 17 schools surveyed by The Daily, although
many use similar lottery systems.
More than a third of the schools house their
students in residential colleges. These dor
mitory areas serve as the hub of living and
socializing for most students.
Freshmen at Yale University and Rice Uni
versity are assigned to a residential college for
four years. At Yale, each of the 12 colleges
selects a committee of students, supervised by
a dean, which designs an in-house room as
signment process.
At Rice, with three years of housing guar
anteed, policies vary. One of the eight resi
dential colleges may require all sophomores or
juniors to live off-campus, while another may
grant room priority to those who have lived
off-campus.
Freshmen at Princeton Univer
sity, UC-Santa Cruz and UC-San
Diego are assigned to a residential
college for two years. After their
first year, they can upgrade to a
better room. UCSD students live
in the housing for the academic
college to which they applied.
Students at these schools then
enter an upperclass housing lot
tery. Although four years of
housing are guaranteed at Prince
ton, seniors have top priority in
the lottery, drawing in groups of
up to eight for a time to sign up
for remaining space. UCSC stu
dents enter the lottery individu
ally.
During the freshman year at
Harvard University, students en
ter a lottery, in groups of up to
19, listing their top four unranked
choices of 12 residential houses in
which to live for the next three
years. In-house preference for
rooms goes to juniors and seniors.
Other schools also allocate
rooms through lotteries. Students
who draw in groups at Brown
University use the average of the
group members' numbers to
choose housing. The numbers of
each class are better than those
of the class below. The draw is
an ongoing process at Brown, with
five lotteries for different types of
housing.
At Amherst College, the draw

is weighted so that most students
live in the more desirable housing
only once during their four guar
anteed years.
Students vying for one of the
4,500 dorm spaces at UC-Berkeley
enter a lottery individually or with
one roommate. UCLA has a
similar process. Both schools
reserve most of the housing for
new students.
Although the University of
Oregon does not have a lottery,
returning residents have priority
during sign-ups, and others are
assigned according to date of ap
plication.
After freshman year, in which
students are assigned by date of
application for housing, Univer
sity of Southern California stu
dents must also go through an
application process for housing
based on many criteria such as
year in school and returning
residency.
Some colleges give upperclass
men priority in the campus lot
tery. At Georgetown University,
where three years of housing are
guaranteed, students draw with a
roommate, and juniors and sen
iors have priority if they have pre
viously lived off-campus. In-house
draws for rooms are based on
numbers drawn in the campus lot
tery.
Duke University uses a similar
system, except students draw in
dividually. Two future roommates
may use the better of their two
lottery numbers to choose
housing together.
