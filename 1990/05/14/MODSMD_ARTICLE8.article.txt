# New RAs beware: You're about to begin a 24-hour-a-day job
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The night before her application to
Stanford's School of Medicine was due,
senior Asha Pillai, a resident assistant
in Alondra House, went to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center with a freshman
who complained of feeling ill.
After returning at 2 a.m., Pillai slept
two hours before waking up to finish
her application. By 8:30, with only a
half hour to spare, Pillai went to turn
in her application, only to have a bike
accident along the way.
Missing sleep, putting off homework
and applications, and taking care of res
idents in the middle of the night are
just a few of the hazards of being an RA.
Those who find out today that they
will be RAs next year will eventually
learn, just as some of this year's RAs
have, that more than just a caretaker,
an RA must be a programmer, adviser,
community builder, counselor and
friend.
While Pillai stressed that she chose
to accompany the sick resident to Cowell
(and, incidentally, was later accepted to
the Medical School), her experience
nonetheless shows some of the personal
sacrifices RAs make for their residents.
"RAs pay a terrific price in wear and
tear," notes Don Roberts, resident fellow
at the American Studies House. "It's a
24-hour-a-day job."
As an RAin Donner, an all-freshman
house, senior Sarah Gerding says her
official responsibilities include planning
residential programs, performing ad
ministrative duties and attending one
staff and one house meeting a week.
"Then there are all the other things
that take a lot of time that aren't in
the definition," Gerding says, including
"all the questions freshmen have" about
academics, class scheduling and life at
Stanford.
Pillai concurs, saying that especially

during the first few weeks of school,
she "spent a lot of time talking to people,
discussing their problems and aspira
tions."
The prime challenge facing RAs in a
four-class house, as junior Nick Haddad,
Mirlo RA, can attest, lies in "building
community." While freshmen enter a
house and have yet to make friends and
find a niche at Stanford, upperclassmen
"already know what they want out of
a dorm," he says.
Senior John Tippett, RA at the up
perclass American Studies House, says,
"There is less tangible work that you
do as an upperclass RA than you do if
you're a freshman RA."
As the only RAin a house of 50
residents, Tippett says that for most of
fall quarter, he spent time in the dorm
getting to know all the residents.
However, Tippett hasn't brought
many speakers or programs to the
house. "It's pretty impossible to con
vince (residents) to do what they're not
inclined to do already," he says.
Regardless of the type of house, RAs
have a lot to do with setting the tone
of a dormitory, Roberts explains.
Having been an RF for four years,
Roberts believes "dorms can live and
die" depending on the RA's efforts. Even
with great RFs, he says, "It's real hard
to have a good dorm with crummy RAs."
Fostering a "good dorm" most often
means that RAs sacrifice time others
spend socializing, studying and par
ticipating in other activities.
As a result of the additional effort
her job requires, Gerding has had to
manage her academics better and plan
up to three weeks in advance to socialize
with friends.
"You don't realize how much time
[being an RA] does take," Gerding says.
"It's dominated my time," Pillai says
of her RA position. "It's made it more
difficult to keep up with classes."
In addition, Pillai has had to give up

certain extracurricular activities and
time spent with friends. "If you want
your sanity, you have to give something
up," she explains. "I've stopped inter
acting as much with close friends, but
it's my choice."
Tippett says he finds it straining
"when everybody gets stressed out dur
ing dead week and finals week" and
goes to see him, even though he has
his own finals to worry about.
But ultimately, the rewards of being
an RA far exceed the $4,500 in com
pensation. For one, Roberts says RAs
"get quite good training in interpersonal
and crisis skills."
Gerding found her ability to manage
a crisis situation tested after the Oct.
17 earthquake. Gerding says "people
got scared when the media kicked in"
with graphic pictures and exaggerated
death tolls.
The Los Angeles String Quartet had
been scheduled to play in Donner at 6
p.m. before making a campus-wide ap
pearance. To calm the residents, Ger
ding and the other Donner RAs
dismantled the fire alarm in the lounge,
so that "an hour after the quake, the
L.A. String Quartet was playing in our
lounge for everyone in the house."
Pillai says being an RA has changed
her in ways she didn't expect.
For example, Pillai says,"I need to
be more spontaneous." Living in a house
of freshmen has helped her become
more so than some may realize.
She adds, "Until this year, I was a
very organized person, doing things sys
tematically and early. This year, a lot
of that has been thrown completely out
of whack because I have a lot of people
I'm physically and emotionally respon
sible for."
"There are times when I question the
sanity of my decision to become an RA,"
Tippett concludes, "but overall, it's been
a great experience."
