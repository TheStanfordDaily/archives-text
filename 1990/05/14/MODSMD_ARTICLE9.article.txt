# Those who don't make today's cut wary about jumping in the Draw
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Today will be a happy day for resident
assistant applicants who receive assign
ments â€” but those who don't will have
the additional trauma of trying to ar
range their Draw plans in less than two
days.
Today marks both the announcement
of resident assistant appointments for
next year and the first day of the Draw.
While the Draw has consisted of two
rounds in the past, this year's Draw has
only one.
In previous years, RA assignments
were not made until the first day of the
second round. Consequently, applicants
entered the first round, received a
housing assignment and had to drop out
of the Draw if assigned an RA position.
Housing Director Rodger Whitney said
this year's one-round Draw marks "a
big improvement" over the previous sys
tem. Letting applicants find out about
RA decisions before drawing is just one
advantage of streamlining the Draw
process, according to Whitney.
The RA decision date has remained
the same, Whitney noted. "All we've
done this year is just delay the Draw."
However, several RA applicants inter
viewed yesterday complained that find
ing out RA assignments on the first day
of the Draw leaves them little time to
rearrange draw groups, list housing pref
erences and collect housing priorities by
Wednesday, the last day of the Draw.
"I can't believe the process is actually
going to be over tomorrow," said soph

omore Leslie Yang, an RA applicant.
"I'm anxious to find out one way or
another so I can settle things with my
draw group."
Because three of the five members of
her draw group applied to be RAs and
everyone has differently ordered prefer
ences, Yang said, "We can't compose a
list of places until those of us up for
RA-ships have them."
"I'm trying not to get stressed," soph
omore Jomichael Porter said. He has
joined a tentative draw group, saying,
"I'm assuming I'm not going to be an
RA, so I'll be pleasantly surprised if
nothing else."
"It's not fair to them," Porter said.
He explained that until today, his draw
mates will not know whether to list
Toyon Hall, comprised mainly of triples,
or to list houses with doubles.
"I've put my draw group in a pretty
tight spot," sophomore James Wu
agreed. With four in his tentative draw
group, his receiving an RA position
would leave only three. "Unless they all
get singles," Wu said, "someone's going
to get a [randomly assigned roommate]."
Wu said that "even five days" between
RA announcements and the Draw would
be helpful.
For next year, Whitney said he hopes
to see "a little less tightness in the
schedule," perhaps setting the date for
RA decisions a few days ahead.
Many applicants also said with time
spent interviewing to be an RA, catching
up on classwork and taking midterms,
they've had little or no time to collect
housing priorities.
