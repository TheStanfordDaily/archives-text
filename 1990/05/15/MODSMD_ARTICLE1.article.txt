# Gorbachev plans visit, national press reports

### Kim Freidberg Editorial staff 
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is
considering a visit to Stanford June 4, ac
cording to unconfirmed national press
reports.
If preliminary reports are correct, Gor
bachev has made Stanford the second stop
on his post-summit trip across the United
States. The unofficial itinerary was re
leased yesterday in an NBC News broad
cast, catching senior University officials by
complete surprise.
Also, The New York Times reported
today that a Bush administration official
had said that "under consideration is a
visit to San Francisco and the Bay Area,
where Mr. Gorbachev would speak at Stan
ford University."
The Associated Press reported last night
that U.S. officials, speaking on the condi
tion of anonymity, said Gorbachev is in
terested in speaking with businesspeople
in California and "may deliver a speech at
Stanford."

Although details of the visit are ex
tremely sketchy, a statement released yes
terday by University President Donald
Kennedy said that "unofficial sources" had
indicated that Gorbachev wished to visit
campus June 4.
Evening news broadcasts on the mqjor
networks named Minneapolis as the other
site Gorbachev plans to visit after his May
30-June 3 summit in Washington with
President Bush.
Press officers at the White House, the
State Department, the Soviet Embassy and
Tass, the Soviet news agency, were either
unavailable or could not confirm or deny
the reports of Gorbachev's planned visit to
campus. "It's all speculation," said Alixe
Glen, a White House press representative.
In the event of Gorbachev's visit, Stan
ford will design a program for the event
with the help of the State Department, the
Soviet Embassy and others, according to
Kennedy's statement.
Kennedy outlined a proposed program
as involving the Economics De
partment, the Hoover Institution
and the Center for Economic
Policy Research.
The Associated Press report
noted that the Hoover Institution
houses expert scholars of the So
viet Union and the world's largest
collection of material on the 1917

Russian Revolution.
Many professors on campus
who had heard the news were
eagerly looking forward to the
possible visit by Gorbachev,
named "Man of the Decade" by
Time magazine earlier this year.
"It would be quite exciting to
have him here," said David Hol
loway, political science professor
and chair of the International Re
lations Department.
Holloway speculated that Gor
bachev may want to see more of

the United States beyond Wash
ington and that the presence of
former Secretary of State George
Shultz at Stanford may have in
fluenced his choice.
Charles Hill, a senior research
fellow at Hoover and Shultz'a spe
cial assistant in the State Depart
ment, said he thought that
invitations from Stanford stu
dents over the last few years may
have influenced Gorbachev's deci
sion.
