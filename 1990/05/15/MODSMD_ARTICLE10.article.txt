# Senior attempts to unite genders
## Student-created program examines sex stereotypes through discussion 
### Theresa Urist Staff writer 
It was a typical playground in
cident, but all senior Ted Des-
Maisons recalls is that it left him
sobbing.
Some of his classmates came
over to tell him that it was un
acceptable for boys to cry. Bur
dened by a gender stereotype,
DesMaisons felt isolated.
But now DesMaisons is bring
ing people together to discuss and
diminish sex biases. As the foun
der of a unique dorm presenta
tion, he tries to make men and
women "allies."
In DesMaisons' definition, an
ally is one who "offers respect,
helps one experience feelings, is
there when in need and offers lis
tening without judgment."
Creating a "forum for under
standing, not dispute," Des-
Maisons begins by grouping
participants by gender and asking
each group the following ques
tions:
• What do you most like about
being in your gender group?
• What do you most dislike
about being in your gender group?
• What do you never hope to
see, hear or experience again as
a member of your gender group?
• What do you need to hear
from members of the opposite
gender group in order for them
to be your allies?
The unique and personal ele
ment of the program emerges
when the two groups reunite. In
stead of merely bringing up
answers to the questions, women
and men must think about and
reiterate the answers of their
counterparts.
By initially dividing partici
pants into gender groups, the pro
gram enables them to overcome
obstacles in self-expression,

DesMaisons says.
Although the out
come of a given
program depends
on the group of
participants,
some concerns re
peatedly arise,
DesMaisons says.
Many women
explain that they

want to be treated as equals. They
add that they don't want to hear
sexist language and that they
shouldn't have to be afraid of
rape.
Often, men point out that they
don't want to be generalized as
typical or sexist males. Others
want to be affectionate with other
men without feeling uncomfort
able.
Senior Ashley Ryan, a resident
assistant at Arroyo House, re
cently experienced the program,
finding it frustrating.
"It leaves you with more ques
tions than answers," she says.
Stressing that this disharmony is
a positive effect, she attributes
the program's impact to its
facilitator.
"DesMaisons is excellent in
speaking and getting people to
open up," Ryan says. "He's mellow
and in control."
A feminist studies Des-
Maisons joined the Rape Educa
tion Project as a freshman and
began facilitating dorm discus
sions for the project his sopho
more year.
Originally, his programs con
sisted of a film, followed by a
discussion of the issues it raised.
Then DesMaisons learned about
the "New Bridges" program, a
one-week camp for high school
students of different economic and
ethnic backgrounds. The program
focuses on creating understanding
about such issues as racism,

sexism and homophobia.
DesMaisons participated in a
mini-version of the camp that
paved the way for his present
dorm discussion.
The program was "the most in
tense weekend of my life" and
"very healing," DesMaisons says.
During his stay at the camp,
he was finally able to discuss the
pain he felt after being teased for
his tears, an experience that "still
affects my behavior."
During the weekend, Des-
Maisons got in touch with that
feeling. He found that due to his
early experience as a male, "wor
rying about being alone was af
fecting my being an ally to
others."
After forgetting to bring "Ret
hinking Rape," a video that was
supposed to spur discussion, Des-
Maisons and Toby Eastman, an
other member of the project,
found a golden opportunity to in
troduce a new format.
In 15 minutes, they tailored
DesMaisons' experiences to design
a new method to get the original
group, which consisted of Sigma
Chi fraternity members and
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority
members, to listen to each other.
With the first attempt a huge
success, DesMaisons and
Eastman held several more dis
cussions in conjunction with the
project. After Eastman graduated
last year, Claire Dolan, a resident
assistant at Otero House last year
and fellow project member, took
her place.
The program has been pre
sented to a number of dorms and
houses around campus this year.
Since DesMaisons is preparing to
graduate, he hopes to train new
people to lead discussions.
He also has sketches for new
offshoots of the program on the
drawing board.
