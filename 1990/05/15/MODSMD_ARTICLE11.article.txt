# Food Service workers laid off
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Layoffs of 21 "temporary" Food
Service workers — including some
who had worked at Stanford for
more than three years — have
angered many workers and the
United Stanford Workers.
According to USW field repre
sentative Rodney Barnette, many
of the workers should have been
classified as permanent employees
and should have received all the
benefits the USW contract grants
to regular staff employees.
However, Director of Housing
and Food Services Keith Guy said
the workers were hired only tem
porarily. Guy announced the
layoff on Friday, explaining that
the jobs were terminated because
there are "not enough full jobs
for that many people."
Article I-A of the USW contract
defines the term "regular staff"
as including "only employees in
positions requiring at least 20
hours work per week for a period
actually lasting at least four
months." Some of the workers say
they have been working from 20
to 40 hours per week for longer
than four months.

The contract stipulates that
when permanent staff workers are
laid off, "each shall be given at
least 30 calendar days notice or
pay in lieu of such notice." It also
adds that "Workers permanently
or indefinitely laid off who have
one or more years of University
seniority shall be entitled ... to
a severance allowance."
In the case of these workers,
Guy said their positions should
have been reviewed after the
standard 120-day temporary em
ployment period ended.
Temporary workers, if chosen to
fill permanent positions, go
through a three-month probation
ary period before full promotion.
Most of the workers should
have been laid off earlier, he said,
but Housing and Food Services
did not realize until recently that
the workers were still on the
payroll.
Guy said he realized the reten
tion of the temporary employees
without promotion "conflicted
with the spirit of the USW agree
ment." He then sent the order to
the individual dorm food service
managers to terminate the posi
tions.
According to Barnette, the

USW thinks the layoff is "a sign
of budgetary problems." But Guy
said the layoff had nothing to do
with Food Service's financial re
duction target.
Jon Rose, a cook with five years
of experience at Ricker Dining
Center, said there are enough per
manent jobs for the temporaries
to fill. According to Rose, the tem
poraries were not performing ex
traneous work but were covering
a rapid increase in the amount of
work necessary in Food Service.
Rose said the feeling among the
other workers is that the tem
poraries should have been given
permanent positions, adding that
four of the temporary workers in
Wilbur Hall had been here for
three-and-a-half years.
"Worker morale is the lowest
it's ever been,"he said. "The tem
poraries were treated with very
little regard or respect."
Rose said he thinks the Uni
versity hires temporaries just so
it won't have to create new per
manent positions. At the end of
the 120 days, the University sim
ply terminates the workers' jobs
and hires another group of tem
poraries to take their place, Rose
said.
