Israeli murderer supported
JERUSALEM (AP) — Rabbi Moshe
Levinger, a founder of the Jewish settlement
movement, was carried on the shoulders of
hundreds of armed supporters to an Israeli
prison today to begin a five-month sentence
for killing a Palestinian.
Levinger pled guilty to death by negligence
in the shooting of a Hebron shoestore owner
on Sept. 30, 1988. He was originally charged
with manslaughter, but the charges were
reduced in a plea bargain. He was sentenced
on May 1.
According to witnesses, Levinger fired in
discriminately after Palestinian youths stoned
his car. The victim, Kayed Sallah, 42, was hit
in his stomach as he stood before his shop.
Independence called illegal
MOSCOW (AP) — President Mikhail Gor
bachev yesterday declared independence moves
by Latvia and Estonia "illegal and invalid"
but gave no hint whether he would retaliate
with sanctions as he has with Lithuania.
In two presidential decrees read yesterday
on the nightly TV news program "Vremya,"
Gorbachev clearly rejected a weekend appeal
by the three Baltic presidents to recognize
their statehood.
Koreans demand ouster
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — About 300
radical students demanding the ousting Pres
ident Roh Tae-woo hurled firebombs and rocks
at riot police in front of a Seoul university
yesterday, and police responded with tear gas.
In Ulsan, 200 miles southeast of the capital,
union leaders at South Korea's largest car
maker announced a general strike today. At
the world's largest shipyard, also in Ulsan,
workers voted to return to their jobs.
Flood waters rising
NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) The
steadily rising Red River forced more Loui
siana families to evacuate yesterday and may
have contributed to a murder-suicide by a
farmer. Evacuations also continued along
Texas' Trinity River, where 7,000 were urged
to head for high ground.
The Red River had started to recede in parts
of Arkansas, but 100 National Guardsmen,
reinforced by two helicopters hauling
sandbags, labored to prevent the collapse of a
levee guarding the town of Garland.
Damage to Texas agriculture alone has been
estimated at between $500 and $700 million
during the past two weeks, since heavy rain
fell in Oklahoma and northern Texas, in the
watersheds of the Trinity and Red rivers.
Dow sets record
NEW YORK (AP) — Stock prices climbed
to a record high yesterday, building on their
rally of the last two weeks as interest rates
continued to ease.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 19.95 to 2,821.53, extending its gain since
April 27 to 176.48 points.
In so doing the average surpassed its pre
vious closing peak of 2,810.15.
