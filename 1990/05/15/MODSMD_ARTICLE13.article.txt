ALLENBY BRIDGE, Jordan (AP)
— Jordanian troops and riot police
yesterday tossed tear gas and smoke
bombs at demonstrators to stop them
from crossing into the Israeli-occupied
West Bank during a pro-Palestinian
march.
"There was nothing else for us to
do," a riot policeman on the scene said.
"We had to stop them by force."
The 2,500 protesters included scores
of Palestinians deported after Israel
seized the West Bank from Jordan in
the 1967 war. They broke away from
a larger group of more than 20,000
marchers.
Hospital sources said at least 103
people were injured when the march,
called to promote Arab-Israeli peace
and an independent Palestinian state,
turned violent.
Interior Minister Salem Masadeh
put the iryury toll at only 52. There
was no immediate explanation for the
difference in figures given by the gov
ernment and hospitals.
"Some elements, probably due to ig
norance, have succeeded in ruining
this march and its peaceful image for
the good cause of the Palestinians,"
Masadeh said in a telephone interview.
Police fired machine guns in the air
to disperse the demonstrators, while
the army tossed tear gas canisters
from six tanks.
Ambulances raced to the scene amid
exploding smoke bombs and tear gas
to evacuate the casualties to Shuna
Hospital, five miles north of the King
Hussein-Allenby Bridge.
Some of the injured appeared to
have broken limbs. A few were bleeding
after being trampled when hysterical
crowds ran in all directions.
Most of casualties were unconscious
after inhaling too much gas, said
Shuna Hospital sources, insisting on
anonymity.
The barrage lasted about IV2 hours,
and many teen-agers were seen throw

ing stones at the tanks and the
policemen.
It was not clear if any of the esti
mated 700 policemen or 300 soldiers
were iryured.
The army and police had instructed
the crowd to stop 700 yards from the
bridge over the Jordan River to avoid
antagonizing the Israelis on the other

side.
But when the demonstrators arrived
at that point after a one-hour walk
from Hajjaj City, three miles to the
north, some 2,500 demonstrators
broke away and tried to run toward
the wooden bridge.
The ground was scattered with Pal
estinian flags, portraits of Palestinian

figures and anti-American and anti-
Israeli banners waved during the
march.
The march was organized by 120
Arab unions and professional associa
tions to mark the 42nd anniversary
of the United Nations' partition plan
that sliced British-mandated Palestine
into Jewish and Arab states.
