Special session held
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme
Court justices, setting the stage for
a decision with meyor political impli
cations, joined lawyers in spirited ar
guments yesterday over flag burning,
patriotism and freedom of expres

In arguments before the justices,

room lawyer, Solicitor General Ken
neth Starr, argued that a new federal
law to protect Old Glory does not
violate free speech any more than a
regulation limiting an outdoor
loudspeaker's volume.
But civil rights attorney William
Kunstler said, "Respect for the flag

must be voluntary. Once people are
compelled to respect a symbol, they
are no longer free."
