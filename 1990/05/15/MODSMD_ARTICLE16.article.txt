A different system
would ensure access
and accountability

Representative govern
ment must be accountable.
It must be accountable to
all those whom it represents, and
it must provide meaningful chan
nels of access for all those who
seek to offer input.
Lessons are still emerging from
the ongoing controversy over the
Council of Presidents election, and
one lesson that shouldn't be lost
is that the ASSU Senate, in its
current configuration, does not
provide the channels of access it
should to ensure its accountability.
Once undergraduate senators
are elected in the spring — in an
election based largely upon party
affiliation and effective fliers —
there is no real mechanism to en
sure accountability to students on
a week-to-week or issue-by-issue
basis.
Face it: Undergraduate senators
have no way of really knowing
what students think about issues
such as the validity of Election
Commissioner Steve Krauss' deci
sion to not count write-in votes.
And when they are given such
information, such as very telling
results from a Daily poll, they are
perfectly free to ignore it.
Undergraduate senators cast
their votes based on no more than
their party affiliation and a general
feel for what they think students
think.
It's time for a change.
What if the ASSU were to divide
the undergraduate population into
10 "districts," based on residential
areas, that would each elect a
voting and non-voting undergrad

uate senator to represent them in
the ASSU Senate?
Senators would be required to
hold periodic "town meetings" in
their districts and attend dorm
meetings regularly. At the meet
ings, students could offer input,
ask questions and keep tabs on the
attendance and voting records of
their representatives.
A residential district would be
about the size of Wilbur Hall. Res
idents living in the eight houses of
Wilbur would elect one voting and
one non-voting senator to repre
sent them — and the represena
tives would be required to do the
rounds of Wilbur house meetings
and hold supplementary open
forums through.
A number of the smaller dorms
would be combined to form a single
residential district. For example,
residents of Toyon and Branner
and undergraduates living in
Crothers might constitute a single
district.
Furthermore, a proportional
number of senators would be cho
sen to represent students not living
in the campus residential system.
Finally, it would make sense to
move the election of senators to
the fall, after "residential districts"
have been populated for the year.
Each district, each having about
600 students, would hold its own
senatorial election a few weeks into
fall quarter. The campaign season
would be compact — about a week
— but would focus on issues. The
other ASSU election items (COP,
Bylaws amendments, etc.) would
remain on the spring ballot.
The current COP's "democracy
in the dorms" campaign has pro
vided a firm step in the right di
rection, but undergraduates need
to take a full leap forward in en
suring they have a say in their
student government.
Representation by district is the
answer.
