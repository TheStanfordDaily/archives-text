Students should call rules in Stanford speech game

THE PRIMARY objection to the
proposed interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard — which
explicitly defines "discriminatory verbal
harrassment" as a violation — is that
it compromises the right to free
speech.
Critics argue that by ratifying the
interpretation, Stanford would be
"adopting an anti-speech regulation"
and "instituting censorship" (in Me
chanical Engineering Prof. Tom Kane's
and Law Prof. Gerald Gunther's words,
respectively, as quoted in the May 9
Campus Report). This objection has
tremendous intuitive force: The First
Amendment is something that most of
us value highly, and we react with
alarm to any apparent threat to it.
And certainly the Fundamental
Standard, especially under this new
interpretation, would be an egregious
breach of the Bill of Rights if it were a

state or federal law. As a law, I per
sonally would greet it with horror.
But the Fundamental Standard is
not a law, and so to assess it by the
same criteria is a fallacy. The fact that
we would not want a particular rule to
be a law, and might even want consti
tutional guarantees to prevent the rule
from becoming law, is not a reason to
reject that rule in every context.
Within a game of Pictionary, players
are not allowed to tell their partners
what they are trying to draw. To pass
that rule as a law would inhibit free
speech; nonetheless, the rule is vital to
the game of Pictionary. Of course, we
don't have to play the game.
We make up the rules of the Stan
ford game, and the only benchmark
that we should use when considering
whether to adopt a new rule is
whether that rule will help make
Stanford the kind of place that we

want it to be.
Critics of the new interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard imply that
the University should never penalize
anyone for what they say This princi
ple is clearly untenable. On what basis
do students typically fail classes if not
on the basis of what they say? In
effect, Stanford can expel someone for
making too many assertions that in
structors dislike, or not enough asser
tions that they do like.
Consider a slightly different example.
Suppose that a student in a Shake
speare class incessantly launches into
elaborate explications of cell division,
explications that in a microbiology
class would be considered exemplary
Such a student would probably soon be
asked to leave the class.
If the student exhibited similarly
inappropriate behavior in every class, I

suspect most of us would agree that
the student should not remain at
Stanford. This student's behavior,
specifically this student's verbal behav
ior, would encumber the exploration of
ideas that the classes exist to facilitate.
Universities are special communities
dedicated to creating an environment
where ideas flourish. I believe that the
new interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard would help to secure that
kind of environment. Personal verbal
assaults directed toward a student's
race, gender or sexual preference
sabotage the spirit of tolerance and
trust necessary to the free flow of
ideas. They are intellectual fouls, the
equivalent of physical abuse in a game
of physical skill, such as basketball or
hockey. They should be against the
rules.
