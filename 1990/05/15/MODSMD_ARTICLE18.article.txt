# Duties of teaching and research are not mutually exclusive
## 
### 
There has been a good deal of corre
spondence in the press recently con
cerning Senior Lecturer in Biological
Sciences, Ellen Porzig. While some of
this correspondence has justifiably
praised Porzig's contributions to our
teaching program, much of it has
critized the faculty and the department
for a lack of commitment to teaching.
As for the issues relating to Porzig, it
would be inappropriate to respond
publicly to matters relating apecifically
to her situation other than to point
out that her current position of senior
lecturer is a continuing appointment
without a termination date.
I would, however, like to respond to

the more general issues of department
teaching philosophy and commitment.
Biological Sciences, is, as its name indi
cates, a department concerned with the
biological world in all its diversity and
in particular with the scientific analy
sis of that world through experiment.
Our teaching goal, therefore, includes
both explaining "facts" and explaining
process, which is the critical evaluation
of experimentation. The department
feels that teaching and research are
highly synergistic, i.e., that faculty
actively engaged in research provide
that best education to our students.
While research activity does not,
obviously, guarantee superb undergrad
uate teaching, the two are not
mutually exclusive aa has been sugges
ted. There is a strong postive correla
tion between the two activities and the
record of teaching excellence in our
department supports this. Five faculty
have received major teaching awards,

and all five rank among the best re
search scientists in our department.
This is not a coincidence; the two ac
tivities really do sustain each other.
Thus we have had a policy that our
research-only faculty positions are term
positions, not available for renewal
beyond five years; the department fac
ulty reaffirmed this policy recently in
discussions regarding the potential case
of a teaching-only faculty position, the
one requested by Porzig. It should be
noted that research-only and teaching
only faculty positions at Stanford are
nonetheless full Academic Council posi
tions carrying the responsiblities and
privileges of submitting grants and
sponsoring and advising graduate stu
dents.
The department has the obligation to
consider all of these factors and to
report on them to the dean in the
appointment nomination. We have
taken this obligation, as well as our
duties to our undergraduates, very

seriously in policy discussions, and
individual evaluations of all faculty
appointments, including that requested
by Porzig.
The issue of Porzig's appointment
and the quality of the biology curricu
lum have become intertwined in an
unfortunate emotional blur. Our fac
ulty feel a strong commitment to pro
vide the best possible educational op
portunities for our students, and we
remain open and available to hear
studnet views toward improvement.
