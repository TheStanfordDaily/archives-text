# Lyons revises cutbacks
## Programs to be scaled down, not eliminated 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
With a revised list of proposed budget
cuts in hand, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons announced yesterday that
most of the cuts will be accomplished by
scaling back existing programs instead of

eliminating them.
The numbers of resident
fellows and computer
clusters will not change,
and the reduction in the
number of resident assis
tants will be smaller than
expected. However, Cowell
Student Health Center's in
firmary, which provides
overnight and emergency
care, will be closed'

While the cuts announced yesterday are
not yet final, Lyons said he expects the
budget Repositioning Steering Committee
to accept most of the cuts.
At this point, the University is trying to
cut programs rather than personnel from
the Student Affairs budget, Lyons noted.
While the staff within the various offices
under Student Affairs will be affected, "we
don't (yet) know the personnel implica
tions," he said.
"There are all kinds of possibilities" for
dealing with the personnel issues after the
cuts have been accepted, Lyons added.
In the Office of Residential Education,
19 student staff residence positions will be
eliminated beginning in the 1991-92 school
year. Most of these positions will be RAs
or other comparable positions in residences
such as Mirrielees House.
In addition, RAs in upperclass houses
without RFs will have fewer responsibilities
than those in houses with RFs. Pay for
these RAs will be cut to 75 percent of the
pay given to RAs in houses with RFs.

Along the same lines, responsibilities and
salaries for 37 graduate RAs will also be
reduced.
According to the revised proposal, all of
the residence computer clusters that cur
rently exist will remain in place. However,
to save money, maintenance and develop
ment funds for the clusters will be reduced.
Some of the costs of the clusters will
also be absorbed by Academic Information
Resources, which is currently responsible
for academic computing.
While the number of resident fellows will
not be reduced, RF program funds will be
cut by 25 percent.
In addition, the overall Res Ed program
funds will be reduced by 50 percent and
graduate residence program funds by 20
to 25 percent.
The overall Student Affairs cut should
be about $1.5 million, 15 percent of its
total budget.
The current proposal covers $1.1 million,
with the remaining money to be made from
organizational changes, reduced office ex
penses and reduced administrative support,
Lyons said.
Lyons said that, on the average, only
one to two students use the Cowell infir
mary on a given night. Students will have
to use other alternatives such as the hospi
tal, he added.
Cowell will also save money by shifting
some of the costs of physical therapy and
diagnostic tests to students' insurance in
stead of paying for it directly, according to
the proposal.
As a possible further step, graduate stu
dents may be charged a fee of $8 per quarter
for Cowell aerobics classes, which are cur
rently free. Initially, the plan proposed that
these classes be cut, but Provost James
Rosse received a flood of letters over the


Lyons
past few weeks from graduate stu
dents.
Other savings will come from
reducing the amount of money
the University gives the ASSU for
such costs as insurance, support
staff and office expenses.
Although most of the functions
performed by the Career Planning
and Placement Center will remain
intact, their overall scale may be
reduced, with an increased em
phasis on group rather than in
dividual advising, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Margaret Ann
Fidler said.
In another streamlining move,
the offices of Tresidder Programs,
Student Organization Services,
Fraternal Affairs and some of the
ASSU advising functions will be
combined into one office.
Lyons said the cuts were less
severe than originally expected be
cause the committees and advi

sory groups "found better ways
to make the cuts."
"I don't feel good about any
one of these cuts, but I'm sur
prised there weren't more out
right eliminations," Lyons said.
Fidler agreed the cuts were not
as severe as projected. "People
forget that 85 percent of Student

Affairs is left intact," she said.
Lyons said he is still looking
for student reaction before
making the final decision on the
proposed budget cuts. Together
with the ASSU, Student Affairs
is sponsoring an open forum on
the budget cuts at 7 p.m. tonight
in Law School room 180.
