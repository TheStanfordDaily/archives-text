## Avoid tangling alliances 
### 
AS EVERY AMERICAN politician
worth his salt yammers on about
the necessity of NATO, it is dying
a slow death.
As President Bush insists upon main
taining our status as a "mcgor European
power," the raison d'etre for American
military forces in Europe is fading away.
As the government faces another fiscal
year with a huge budget deficit despite
neglecting pressing domestic concerns —
inadequate education, drug addiction,
deteriorating infrastructure — neither
the president nor Congress is rethinking
our basic commitment to the defense of
Western Europe, a commitment which
costs some $160 billion per year.
In the past year, the limits of the Soviet
empire have shifted eastward back to the
Baltic states, and German reunification
has been transformed from a theoretical
question into a political reality. The con
sequences of these changes should be
clear: The balance of power in Europe
has been radically altered, and yet, the
United States clings to the institutions
and relationships of the pre-1989 era.
Instead of producing an overall strat
egy which deftly extricates ourselves from
the obligations of the bipolar world, the
Bush foreign policy is content to react to
events. The Bush administration refuses
to lead and is content to follow.
It seems to be a maxim of accepted
wisdom among pundits that U.S. forces
are a permanent fixture in the European
landscape: prudent, reciprocal reductions
— yes, but total withdrawal - never. For
some, it is inconceivable and unnatural

that Europe could ever cope without a
large contingent of the U.S. Army sta
tioned on its soil.
But how unthinkable is a total with
drawal? The disintegration of the Warsaw
Pact has effectively eliminated the threat
of a Soviet attack on Western Europe.
Quite frankly, the Red Army would have
to fight its way through the territory of
its nominal allies to attempt such an
operation.
The very countries we are supposed to
protect (such as West Germany and
France) are scaling back their own mil
itary budgets, and our military presence
is beginning to be seen as an onerous
imposition on their sovereignty. The U.S.
Army in Europe will eventually alienate
our allies instead of serving as the back
bone of NATO, as it has done since 1949.
I suggest instead that this country
return to its long tradition of maintaining
a foreign policy that emphasizes freedom
of action and avoids entangling alliances.
However, this foreign policy does not ex
pect and does not rely upon the goodwill
of nations.
It is a foreign policy that is constantly
mindful of U.S. national interest and is
acutely aware of the cost of open-ended,
long-term military commitments. It is a
strategy which plays to our strengths and
eschews military action requiring large
numbers of ground forces.
Walter Lippmann wrote in 1947 that
"American military power is distin
guished by its mobility, its speed, its
range and its offensive striking force."
The United States' military commitments

The 'new isolationism'
retains the American
capacity to use force
quickly and decisively.

ought to be structured around our air
and sea power, where our technological
edge and military expertise can carry the
day.
The "new isolationism" retains the
American capacity to use force quickly
and decisively but does not allow its
troops to be engaged in the prolonged,
static defense of foreign nations.
"New isolationism" is not a retreat
from foreign relations. U.S. diplomacy
can remain active without stationing
troops in farflung areas of the world.
The defense of Western Europe is not
a privilege but a burden, a burden which
we have borne for good cause and prudent
purpose in the postwar world. However,
we must now move on to the post-postwar
world. It is time that this country tended
its own gardens.
