# Diagnosing, not doomsaying
## Anne Ehrlich discusses new book on population policy 
### Amy Arends 
Anne Ehrlich, co-author of
"The Population Explosion" and
senior research associate in biol
ogy, won't make predictions about
the future of the planet, but she
will make a diagnosis.
"I get upset with predictions,"
Ehrlich said. "We're diagnosing
global problems."
Ehrlich gives the example of a
patient going to a doctor and being
diagnosed with cancer.
"The doctor predicts that if you
don't get treatment, you're going
to die. Is that just doomsaying?
He doesn't predict; he diagnoses
the problem and then recom
mends treatment," Ehrlich ex
plained. "My diagnosis for the
planet would be that we are in
real trouble. If we don't change
our ways and pay some more at
tention, civilization is going to go
down the drain.
"The United States is one of
the biggest consumers in the
world. Look at our per capita en
ergy consumption as an index of
our impact on the global environ
ment," Ehrlich continued. "It's
fairly simple but fairly accurate
in the sense that it really gets at
the heart in the ways in which

we do our damage.
In the book, she and her hus
band Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor
of population studies, talk about
ways of controlling the popula
tion. Anne's thoughts range from
controlling the birth rate using
various methods in foreign coun
tries to establishing a United
States population policy.
In less-developed countries, a
method for encouraging small
families would be to "use eco
nomic incentives, such as better
housing and other tax incentives
and have disincentives for large
families."
"China already has such en
couragements in place, and statis
tics have shown that the program
has had some effect," she ex
plained.
According to Ehrlich, the U.S.
government needs a population
policy to use as a guideline for
national policy and also to use as
an example to foreigners.
"We're role models for the
world. People may complain about
our politics, but they nevertheless
like to do things the way we do.
They see our television programs
and aspire to our way of life. It
will be a disaster if five million
people decide to live like Ameri

cans," she continued.
Currently, the government has
an immigration policy. However,
Ehrlich feels that "makes no sense
at all and is no help when they
don't have an overall population
policy.
"We need to get our immigra
tion policy rationalized. What
people don't seem to realize is
that our foreign policy and foreign
behavior go a long way in gener
ating the immigration we seem to
want to regulate so much."
Ehrlich cites the large amounts
of immigration from Southeast
Asia as an example.
"It is a legacy we created from
the Vietnam War. This is not to
say we should slam the door be
cause, after all, we did create the
need and now have an obligation
to these people," she explained.
"However, that also means we
don't have to let them all in. We
do need to play some sort of role
on the world scene to see that
they are cared for properly and
find homes."
Ehrlich's dream population
policy would establish a goal to
stop the American population
growth as soon as possible and
"begin a slow decline to a sus
tainable level."
