"Ruin is the destination toward
which all men rush, each pursuing
his own best interest in a society
that believes in the freedom of
the commons. Freedom in a com
mons brings ruin to all."
The "tragedy of the commons"
about which Garrettt Hardin
speaks is that of overgrazing a
village's common pasture. In "The
Population Explosion," Paul and
Anne Ehrlich compare "the com
mons" to the global ecosystem in
which we live.
In the Ehrlichs' view, human
ity's freedom to reproduce without
regard to the worldwide over
population problem threatens the
survival of the Earth itself. This
may seem a farfetched claim, but
Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of
population studies and professor
of biological sciences at Stanford,
and Anne Ehrlich, senior research
associate in biology, present reams
of facts and statistics to buttress

their viewpoint in"The Popula
tion Explosion."
Today, 5.3 billion people live on
our planet, and some 95 million
are added annually. According to
the Ehrlichs, the environmental
impact of so many bodies amassed
together on Earth is devastating.
Instead of depending on renew
able resources, or income, the
ever-growing human population
has increasingly been living off its
nonrenewable resources, or capi
tal.
Examples of renewable re
sources would be topsoil and
groundwater, both of which are
vital farming crops — to feed the
multiplying mouths on our planet.
But because of the increasing de
mands of increasing numbers of
people, groundwater is being
turned from a renewable resource
into a nonrenewable one.
In order to support human ac
tivity, water is being withdrawn
from underground stores many
times faster than it is being
replaced by nature. For instance,
in California's San Joaquin Valley,
aquifers are being pumped at a
rate that exceeds recharge by over
500 billion gallons annually. This

enormous overdraft is best pic
tured as roughly double the flow
of oil into the entire U.S. economy
annually.
An example of a truly non
renewable resource is the Earth's
biotic diversity. By exterminating
genetically distinct species
through deforestation and the
like, Homo sapiens is closing off
a wide range of opportunities to
improve the health and welfare
of its exploding population
through as-yet-undiscovered
foods, medicines and industrial
materials. By living off capital
rather than income, we're eating
the goose that lays our golden
eggs.
Overpopulation, according to
the Ehrlichs, occurs when the
number of people in an area
exceeds the resources or capacity
of the environment to sustain
human activity in that area, i.e.
the area's carrying capacity. By
this definition, Earth as a planet
is overpopulated, and virtually
every nation is already vastly
overpopulated.
The impact that a population
makes on its environment can be
summarized in a simple equation:
Impact = Population * Affluence
* Technology, or I = PAT.
Rich, developed nations make a
greater environmental impact
than poor nations because of the
large A and T factors. Less devel
oped countries with big popula
tions also have high

environmental impact since the P
factor is so huge. Undesirable en
vironmental impact can be
reduced if the population
decreases in size, per capita con
sumption drops or the technology
that provides goods consumed is
less environmentally disruptive.
It is likely that food will be the
limiting resource that keeps
human populations in check.
Today, nearly a billion of the
world's poorest people are hungry.
The Ehrlichs maintain that if the
excess food of the rich were some
how made available to the poor,
the poor would be better fed; but
there is not much food left to
accomodate a population increase.
Moreover, agricultural systems
supplying the people of Earth
with food are adversely affected
by many forms of human-caused
environmental damage. Human
attempts to produce more food
more often than not reduce
ecosystem health, which in turn
undermines the ability of terres
trial and aquatic ecosystems to
supply humanity with further
sustenance.
As the Ehrlichs see it, the pop
ulation connection to global envi
ronmental problems is usually

and obvious. First, there is
the greenhouse effect — carbon
dioxide released by the burning
of fossil fuels, in combination with
other greenhouse gases, is
gradually warming the entire
planet, turning up the heat on
the atmospheric system.
Poor nations are now relatively
minor contributors to the carbon
dioxide load generated by burning
fossil fuels, but a significant re
alization of their aspirations to
develop, multiplied by their pop
ulation growth, will change that
very quickly.
While the greenhouse warming
represents an impending environ
mental catastrophe, serious dam
age from acid rain is already upon
us. Too many cars, too many in
dustrial products, and too much
energy use per person inflate the
consumption (A) factor of the I
= PAT equation.
Failure to invest in smaller,
more energy-efficient cars and a
refusal to pay for adequate pollu
tion controls in factories makes
the ecologically damaging technol
ogy (T) factor substantial too. But
the P factor is important here as
well. If there were only half as
many Americans driving cars,

using manufactured devices and
consuming electric power, acid
rain problems would be compara
tively negligible-
Yet another widespread
population-related environmental
problem is the ecological degrada
tion of Earth's land surface in
what is known as desertification.
Population growth interacts
with bad land-use policies and
changing socioeconomic condi
tions to produce land
deterioration.
In the Ehrlichs' view, over
population in rich countries is,
from the standpoint of Earth's
habitability, more serious than
rapid population growth in poor
countries. Recall the "Affluence"
factor in the I = PAT equation.
Rapid population growth in
poor nations, however, is an im
portant reason they stay poor, and
overpopulation in those nations
will greatly increase their destruc
tive impact on the environment
as they struggle to develop.
However, the Ehrlichs go on to
maintain that Earth cannot long
sustain even the 5.3 billion people
living on our planet today. They
believe that population shrinkage
below today's size eventually will
be necessary if the global ecosys
tems supporting human life are
to be preserved.
Apparently, educating the
public (especially those in rich,
democratic nations) about the
problem of overpopulation in the
hopes of changing people's atti
tudes about ideal family size is
the primary means by which pop
ulation growth can be halted. To
this end, "The Population Explo
sion" does a commendable job.

Poor nations are now relatively
minor contributors to the carbon

fossil fuels, but a significant re

While the greenhouse warming
represents an impending environ
mental catastrophe, serious dam
age from acid rain is already upon
us. Too many cars, too many in
dustrial products, and too much
energy use per person inflate the
consumption (A) factor of the I
= PAT equation.
Failure to invest in smaller,
more energy-efficient cars and a
refusal to pay for adequate pollu
tion controls in factories makes
the ecologically damaging technol
ogy (T) factor substantial too. But
the P factor is important here as
well. If there were only half as
many Americans driving cars,

using manufactured devices and
consuming electric power, acid
rain problems would be compara
tively negligible-
Yet another widespread
population-related environmental
problem is the ecological degrada
tion of Earth's land surface in
what is known as desertification.
Population growth interacts
with bad land-use policies and
changing socioeconomic condi
tions to produce land
deterioration.
In the Ehrlichs' view, over
population in rich countries is,
from the standpoint of Earth's
habitability, more serious than
rapid population growth in poor
countries. Recall the "Affluence"
factor in the I = PAT equation.
Rapid population growth in
poor nations, however, is an im
portant reason they stay poor, and
overpopulation in those nations
will greatly increase their destruc
tive impact on the environment
as they struggle to develop.
However, the Ehrlichs go on to
maintain that Earth cannot long
sustain even the 5.3 billion people
living on our planet today. They
believe that population shrinkage
below today's size eventually will
be necessary if the global ecosys
tems supporting human life are
to be preserved.
Apparently, educating the
public (especially those in rich,
democratic nations) about the
problem of overpopulation in the
hopes of changing people's atti
tudes about ideal family size is
the primary means by which pop
ulation growth can be halted. To
this end, "The Population Explo
sion" does a commendable job.

"Ruin is the destination toward
which all men rush, each pursuing
his own best interest in a society
that believes in the freedom of
the commons. Freedom in a com
mons brings ruin to all."
The "tragedy of the commons"
about which Garrettt Hardin
speaks is that of overgrazing a
village's common pasture. In "The
Population Explosion," Paul and
Anne Ehrlich compare "the com
mons" to the global ecosystem in
which we live.
In the Ehrlichs' view, human
ity's freedom to reproduce without
regard to the worldwide over
population problem threatens the
survival of the Earth itself. This
may seem a farfetched claim, but
Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of
population studies and professor
of biological sciences at Stanford,
and Anne Ehrlich, senior research
associate in biology, present reams
of facts and statistics to buttress

their viewpoint in"The Popula
tion Explosion."
Today, 5.3 billion people live on
our planet, and some 95 million
are added annually. According to
the Ehrlichs, the environmental
impact of so many bodies amassed
together on Earth is devastating.
Instead of depending on renew
able resources, or income, the
ever-growing human population
has increasingly been living off its
nonrenewable resources, or capi
tal.
Examples of renewable re
sources would be topsoil and
groundwater, both of which are
vital farming crops — to feed the
multiplying mouths on our planet.
But because of the increasing de
mands of increasing numbers of
people, groundwater is being
turned from a renewable resource
into a nonrenewable one.
In order to support human ac
tivity, water is being withdrawn
from underground stores many
times faster than it is being
replaced by nature. For instance,
in California's San Joaquin Valley,
aquifers are being pumped at a
rate that exceeds recharge by over
500 billion gallons annually. This

enormous overdraft is best pic
tured as roughly double the flow
of oil into the entire U.S. economy
annually.
An example of a truly non
renewable resource is the Earth's
biotic diversity. By exterminating
genetically distinct species
through deforestation and the
like, Homo sapiens is closing off
a wide range of opportunities to
improve the health and welfare
of its exploding population
through as-yet-undiscovered
foods, medicines and industrial
materials. By living off capital
rather than income, we're eating
the goose that lays our golden
eggs.
Overpopulation, according to
the Ehrlichs, occurs when the
number of people in an area
exceeds the resources or capacity
of the environment to sustain
human activity in that area, i.e.
the area's carrying capacity. By
this definition, Earth as a planet
is overpopulated, and virtually
every nation is already vastly
overpopulated.
The impact that a population
makes on its environment can be
summarized in a simple equation:
Impact = Population * Affluence
* Technology, or I = PAT.
Rich, developed nations make a
greater environmental impact
than poor nations because of the
large A and T factors. Less devel
oped countries with big popula
tions also have high

environmental impact since the P
factor is so huge. Undesirable en
vironmental impact can be
reduced if the population
decreases in size, per capita con
sumption drops or the technology
that provides goods consumed is
less environmentally disruptive.
It is likely that food will be the
limiting resource that keeps
human populations in check.
Today, nearly a billion of the
world's poorest people are hungry.
The Ehrlichs maintain that if the
excess food of the rich were some
how made available to the poor,
the poor would be better fed; but
there is not much food left to
accomodate a population increase.
Moreover, agricultural systems
supplying the people of Earth
with food are adversely affected
by many forms of human-caused
environmental damage. Human
attempts to produce more food
more often than not reduce
ecosystem health, which in turn
undermines the ability of terres
trial and aquatic ecosystems to
supply humanity with further
sustenance.
As the Ehrlichs see it, the pop
ulation connection to global envi
ronmental problems is usually

and obvious. First, there is
the greenhouse effect — carbon
dioxide released by the burning
of fossil fuels, in combination with
other greenhouse gases, is
gradually warming the entire
planet, turning up the heat on
the atmospheric system.
