## And then there were four: McGrath upset in singles 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - In
1989, the Stanford Cardinal
placed five players in the NCAA
individual singles championships.
Four of them advanced to the
round of 16.
The fifth was Tami Whitlinger,
the No.l player in the country.
She was upset in the first round
by Noelle Porter of Pepperdine,
a player few regarded as a
legitimate contender.
This year, Stanford again found
itself with five singles participants
including Meredith McGrath, the
No. 1 player in the country. Ap
parently the gods decided to go
with the same script again.
Sandra Birch, Teri Whilinger,
Debbie Graham and Lisa Green
all won a pair of matches yester
day, but McGrath, the tourna
ment's No. 1 seed, suffered a
stunning second-round upset.
After getting past Michelle
McMillen of Tennessee in her
opening match, McGrath drew
Lupita Novelo of USC. Tennis fol
lowers know Novelo as a some
what gifted player who cannot
seem to come up with the big win.
But that was before yesterday.
Behind the strength of her first
serve and aided by numerous un
forced errors off the racket of
McGrath, Novelo jumped ahead
6-3, 5-3 and was serving for the
match.
The Stanford freshman had
been in this situation before and

pulled it out. And when Novelo
served up a pair of double faults,
it semed like the tide might be
turning again. "I got it into my
mind she always comes back,"
Novelo said of her struggles in
the last game.
Then she quickly pushed the
thoughts aside, got a match point
ar.d converted it.
"I didn't play well," McGrath
said. "She did what she had to
do to beat me, which today was
not very much. I couldn't get a
rhythm going."
Novelo's play had a good deal
to do with that. She said she was
taking the ball on the rise and
agressively attacking the net.
"There's no way I would stay back
because she would kill me,"
Novelo said.
While McGrath was not making
any excuses, she did cite the
fatigue factor. For the previous
four days, McGrath was battling
some of the best players in the
country in the team competition.
Novelo and USC were eliminated
Friday.
"To have the individuals so
close to the team is just really
tough on everybody," McGrath
said. "I don't think it's the
greatest format."
She went on to talk about what
the loss meant to her. "I'm very
disappointed," she said. "I wanted
to win this more than anything
all year."
McGrath also really wants to
win the doubles title with Whit
linger. And, after a shaky start

that found them down 3-1, the
Cardinal tandem advanced with a
6-4, 6-2 victory over Karen Ber
gan and Jennifer Rojohn of Ari
zona State.
For the rest of the Stanford
contingent, the day was a battle
against the elements and fierce
competition that, in the end, was
colcrcd all Cardinal.
Temperatures soared into the
90s, and the humid Florida air
lacked any hint of a breeze. Nary
a cloud flitted over the horizon
to block the sun. It was hardly
ideal weather in which to play a
pair of singles matches — and in
most cases a doubles match as
well.
Green has made three straight
appearances in the NCAA semi
finals but entered the draw this
year unseeded and unheralded.
After she opened with San Diego's
Tonya Fuller and allowed her just
one game in a 6-0, 6-1 thumping,
there was still hardly anyone
paying attention.
Then Green faced Georgia's
Caryn Moss, an infuriating back
board who can drive a player
crazy. But Green stayed sane and
won that match 6-4, 6-1. Still, few
eyebrows were raised.
When fourth seed Trisha Laux
was defeated by Carla Cossa of
Texas to open up Green's section
of the draw, suddenly a fourth
final four appeance seemed within
reach. Today, Green will have to
beat Cossa and probably Florida's
