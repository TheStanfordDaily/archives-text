# Birch aims at repeat, Wimbledon too
## But defending NCAA singles champ finds it tough to stay on top 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Someday, she would
like to win Wimbledon, to be champion at the
All-England Club. Sandra Birch calls it "my
long-term goal."
But the junior from Huntington Bay, N.Y.,
is no fool. She knows that the length of "long
term" is far from certain. Instead of waiting
for the big prize, she has found a way of
taking intermediate steps along the way to
keep herself motivated.
When she arrived at Stanford in the fall of
1987, one of those plateaus she aspired to
was earning the No. 1 spot in Stanford's
singles lineup. But she played fourth singles
as a freshman and second singles as a soph
omore.
Birch was frustrated by her position but
never unrealistic. She knew the top position
would not be handed to her — it would have
to be earned.
A year ago she went a long way toward
earning it as she emerged from the field to
win the NCAA singles championship. The vic
tory gave her confidence and established Birch
as the player to beat. When she won the
Riviera All-American Championships in Octo
ber, that reputation was enhanced even fur
ther.
The Cardinal played out its challenge
matches to determine the lineup a couple of
months later and, as expected, Birch emerged
from them as the No. 1 singles player.
By all rights she has had a teriffic season.
She was undefeated in dual matches until late
March, held the No. 1 spot in the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate rankings through most of the
year and helped lead her team to a fifth
straight NCAA title.
But Birch was not satisfied. "I'm a perfec
tionist," she says. "I'm not happy with this
year." A late-season slump saw her drop five
dual matches in a span of just over six weeks.

And maybe the worst thing about it is trying
to figure out what went wrong.
"Things didn't really go well toward the
end. I really don't know why," she says."I
try not to measure my goals as far as my
results and win-loss record. I try to look at
the play of my game."
Invariably, Birch continues, she ends up
wrapped up in those very results. They are
one of the few tangible measures of how she
is doing, of whether she is improving.
Sometimes, losing can put a distorted focus
on the picture and make everything seem out
of proportion. But not for the levelheaded
Birch. Instead of deciding her game has gone
downhill faster than Franz Klammer at In
nsbruck, she acknowledges that some im
provement has been made, "but it's not
transferring quite as well as I would like into
match play."
What she hopes to do with her game in the
future is to develop a more lethal backhand
to compliment her "Steffi Graf Jr." forehand.
Maybe 30 percent of the time, she says, Birch
would like to pound a topspin backhand in
place of her slice.
Birch practices the new stroke all the time
and feels she has it down, but she is unlikely
to use it in a match, lest she bang one off
the back fence. "There's a fear there I'm going
to have to get over," she says.
That shot might be just the weapon she
needs to overcame the one type of player
Birch has had real trouble beating. If her
opponent serves-and-volleys or plays aggres
sively, Birch rarely has trouble. She plays that
way as well and thrives in the uptempo style.
No, those players are not the problem. It's
the baseline bangers who rarely even hint at
stepping in and are content to bomb from
just outside the end line. USC's Trisha Laux
and Florida's Andrea Farley are the foremost
practitioners of the style and have beaten
Birch a total of four times this season —

three times in dual matches.
"From the baseline, I'm not strong enough
to beat them at their game," Birch says, adding
she has to force the issue with smart, aggres
sive play. Typically, an outside observer can
tell she is going really well when her opponent
is taken out of their game.
It was that ability that allowed Birch to
win the NCAAs last season. She says she
made one mistake when that happened last
year. "It was a great feeling, but I didn't let
myself enjoy the win," she says."I regret that
now."
Before she could savor the moment, she
had already rededicated herself to working
harder and seeing that she did not slip. Now
she realizes "it can be so ephemeral being on
top."
Of course Birch knows when she leaves the
friendly confines of Stanford and heads out
to the pro tour, the road to the top will be
much longer. Still, she is wrought with an
ticipation. "I have thought about turning pro
after this year and still kick the idea around,"
she says.
"I feel I'm ready to move on. I feel ready
to play the pro tour."
But for all her feelings, there is a very
strong draw to return for her fourth year.
She can get her degree on time, be with her
good friends and continue to play college ten
nis.
"I really enjoy the team aspect. . . playing
for Stanford," she says. "When you share a
common experience (of winning), it's such a
neat feeling. I don't think you could ever get
that anywhere else."
She adds that she will probably stay at
Stanford. Wimbledon has been there a long
time; it's not going anywhere. If she wins
another NCAA crown two days from now,
Birch will make certain she pauses to enjoy
it this time. If not, she'll just set another
short term goal and take it from there.

just outside the end line. USC's Trisha Laux
and Florida's Andrea Farley are the foremost
practitioners of the style and have beaten
Birch a total of four times this season —

three times in dual matches.
"From the baseline, I'm not strong enough
to beat them at their game," Birch says, adding
she has to force the issue with smart, aggres
sive play. Typically, an outside observer can
tell she is going really well when her opponent
is taken out of their game.
It was that ability that allowed Birch to
win the NCAAs last season. She says she
made one mistake when that happened last
year. "It was a great feeling, but I didn't let
myself enjoy the win," she says."I regret that
now."
Before she could savor the moment, she
had already rededicated herself to working
harder and seeing that she did not slip. Now
she realizes "it can be so ephemeral being on
top."
Of course Birch knows when she leaves the
friendly confines of Stanford and heads out
to the pro tour, the road to the top will be
much longer. Still, she is wrought with an
ticipation. "I have thought about turning pro
after this year and still kick the idea around,"
she says.
"I feel I'm ready to move on. I feel ready
to play the pro tour."
But for all her feelings, there is a very
strong draw to return for her fourth year.
She can get her degree on time, be with her
good friends and continue to play college ten
nis.
"I really enjoy the team aspect. . . playing
for Stanford," she says. "When you share a
common experience (of winning), it's such a
neat feeling. I don't think you could ever get
that anywhere else."
She adds that she will probably stay at
Stanford. Wimbledon has been there a long
time; it's not going anywhere. If she wins
another NCAA crown two days from now,
Birch will make certain she pauses to enjoy
it this time. If not, she'll just set another
short term goal and take it from there.
GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Someday, she would
like to win Wimbledon, to be champion at the
All-England Club. Sandra Birch calls it "my
long-term goal."
But the junior from Huntington Bay, N.Y.,
is no fool. She knows that the length of "long
term" is far from certain. Instead of waiting
for the big prize, she has found a way of
taking intermediate steps along the way to
keep herself motivated.
When she arrived at Stanford in the fall of
1987, one of those plateaus she aspired to
was earning the No. 1 spot in Stanford's
singles lineup. But she played fourth singles
as a freshman and second singles as a soph
omore.
Birch was frustrated by her position but
never unrealistic. She knew the top position
would not be handed to her — it would have
to be earned.
A year ago she went a long way toward
earning it as she emerged from the field to
win the NCAA singles championship. The vic
tory gave her confidence and established Birch
as the player to beat. When she won the
Riviera All-American Championships in Octo
ber, that reputation was enhanced even fur
ther.
The Cardinal played out its challenge
matches to determine the lineup a couple of
months later and, as expected, Birch emerged
from them as the No. 1 singles player.
By all rights she has had a teriffic season.
She was undefeated in dual matches until late
March, held the No. 1 spot in the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate rankings through most of the
year and helped lead her team to a fifth
straight NCAA title.
But Birch was not satisfied. "I'm a perfec
tionist," she says. "I'm not happy with this
year." A late-season slump saw her drop five
dual matches in a span of just over six weeks.

And maybe the worst thing about it is trying
to figure out what went wrong.
"Things didn't really go well toward the
end. I really don't know why," she says."I
try not to measure my goals as far as my
results and win-loss record. I try to look at
the play of my game."
Invariably, Birch continues, she ends up
wrapped up in those very results. They are
one of the few tangible measures of how she
is doing, of whether she is improving.
Sometimes, losing can put a distorted focus
on the picture and make everything seem out
of proportion. But not for the levelheaded
Birch. Instead of deciding her game has gone
downhill faster than Franz Klammer at In
nsbruck, she acknowledges that some im
provement has been made, "but it's not
transferring quite as well as I would like into
match play."
What she hopes to do with her game in the
future is to develop a more lethal backhand
to compliment her "Steffi Graf Jr." forehand.
Maybe 30 percent of the time, she says, Birch
would like to pound a topspin backhand in
place of her slice.
Birch practices the new stroke all the time
and feels she has it down, but she is unlikely
to use it in a match, lest she bang one off
the back fence. "There's a fear there I'm going
to have to get over," she says.
That shot might be just the weapon she
needs to overcame the one type of player
Birch has had real trouble beating. If her
opponent serves-and-volleys or plays aggres
sively, Birch rarely has trouble. She plays that
way as well and thrives in the uptempo style.
No, those players are not the problem. It's
the baseline bangers who rarely even hint at
stepping in and are content to bomb from
just outside the end line. USC's Trisha Laux
and Florida's Andrea Farley are the foremost
practitioners of the style and have beaten
Birch a total of four times this season —
