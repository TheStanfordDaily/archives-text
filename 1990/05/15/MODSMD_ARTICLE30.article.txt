# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Tcri Whitlinger and John Reid are both
juniors, and both are varsity athletes for
Stanford. Both had dam fine weeks in their
respective sports, and that makes the two
of them the Daily's Athletes of the Week.
Whitlinger, who is from Neenah, Wis.,
plays on the Stanford women's tennis team,
a.k.a. The Automatic, The Dynasty or simply
The Champs. With a slight flick of their
collective wrists over the weekend, the Car

dinal won their fifth straight national title.
Whitlinger led the way, winning all five
matches she played in straight sets in the
NCAA team championships. Despite her No.
10 ranking nationally, Whitlinger plays
fourth singles for Stanford. At four, Teri
Whitlinger doesn't lose. Period.
She finished the season 26-0 in singles,
after an NCAAs that went 6-3, 6-0; 6-1, 6-3;
6-2, 6-4; 6-1, 6-1 (in the finals). In doubles,
Whitlinger ascends to the top of the pack,
as she and partner Meredith McGrath form
the nation's No. 1 team.
In their only test, the duo finished off
the No. 5-ranked team from Texas in 48
minutes, 6-1, 6-1. They finish the dual-match
season 14-0.
On a team where nearly every member
dominated the opposition, Whitlinger par
ticularly sparkled and showed her court
savvy in helping Stanford win the third
consecutive title of her career.

Reid, who comes to the Farm from St.
Louis, is a new face on the Stanford baseball
team this year despite his class standing.
Reid, a 6-foot-5 right-hander, is the lone
junior-college transfer on the Cardinal
squad.
Stanford is glad he came along, as Reid
has emerged as a solid third starter in the
pitching rotation. With 10 starts and 16
total appearances, Reid's ERA of 2.97 places
him second on the team and first in Coach
Mark Marquess's heart.
On Sunday, after USC had handed the
Cardinal its first home conference loss of

the year, Reid had the luxury of taking the
mound in a game that was meaningless for
Stanford standings-wise. The Trojans, how
ever, were playing for a possible second-place
tie in the Pacific 10 Southern Division.
So Reid went out and pitched a complete
game six-hitter. The one run he allowed was
unearned, and he struck out four Trojans
as the Cardinal slammed the door on the
Six-Pac, 6-1.
