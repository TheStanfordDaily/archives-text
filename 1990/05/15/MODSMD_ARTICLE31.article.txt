# Furious firings in pro sports puzzles
## 
### 
The coaching profession
seems to be terribly
misunderstood these
days.
For starters, two firings in
professional sports in the past
week or so have proven that if
you have an IQ higher than
your shoe size, there's a job for
you in the front office of some
pro team.

I heard about a week ago
that Terry Crisp was fired as
the coach of the Calgary
Flames. Now a rule of sports
lately has been that coaches get
fired all the time. I don't nec
essarily think that's a good
idea, but it happens and I can
deal with it.
But how could you fire the
coach who had brought your
club the Stanley Cup only 11
months before?
If memory serves me correct
ly, Crisp's Flames had the best
regular-season record in 1989
before winning the Cup, and
they also had the league's best
mark the year before that. This
year, the Flames only won the
Smythe Division regular
season title before being upset
by the Los Angeles Kings in
the first round of the NHL
playoffs.
So do you consider Crisp a
good coach for his team's fine
showings over the long haul,
or do you call him a loser for
dropping four of seven games
to the Kings?
Considering, of course, that
the winning goal in the final
game was scored in double
overtime by a player lying flat
on the ice who didn't know he
was the person who put the
puck into the net until a team
mate told him in the locker
room after the game? And con
sidering that Calgary had
scored the game-winning goal
in the first overtime, but it
was disallowed?
I'd vote for a guy with a
career .690 winning percent
age, but I guess I have some
opposition in the Flames' front
office.
Perhaps that cold Canadian
air is freezing people's brains
up in Calgary.
Example two came a day
or two later. Or maybe
a day or two earlier. I
forget.
Anyway, one morning I got
up, walked to the door of my
apartment and got the morning
paper. I opened to the sports
page (my second-favorite sports
page, of course). And I was

stunned to see Jimmy Rodgers
had been fired as the coach of
the Boston Celtics.
Now all Rodgers has done
lately is take one of the oldest
teams in professional sports to
the fourth-best record in the
Eastern Division of the NBA.
Last year, with star forward
Larry Bird out for almost the
entire season, Rodgers directed
the team to the playoffs any
way.
This year, with a guy no one
has ever heard of (Reggie
Lewis) and four other guys
whose average age is 34 (Bird,
Dennis Johnson, Kevin McHale
and Robert Parrish) as his
starting lineup, the Celtics had
a fine year. But because of one
game — a 121-114 loss to the
New York Knicks in Boston
Garden — he got the axe.
Aside from the total silliness
required to fire such a success
ful coach, the Celtics front of
fice is setting itself up to look
very stupid next year. With
everyone getting a year older
and with no high draft choice,
Boston will likely be somewhat
worse next season.
And while some good
coaches are getting fired,
some great coaches are
not getting the recognition
they deserve. When John
Wooden won a bunch of NCAA
titles in rapid succession he
was named the Wizard of
Westwood and went down in
history as the greatest coach
in collegiate history.
Yet Frank Brennan has won
five consecutive NCAA wom
en's tennis titles — and seven
in the last nine years — yet
he gets the same treatment as
the Los Angeles Lakers' Pat
Riley gets. You know, the "His
team's so talented, 1 could
coach it," routine.
But how did the team get so
talented?
In Brennan's case, he man
aged to convince most of the
top high school tennis players
in the nation that Stanford was
where they wanted to go. De
spite the high admissions
standards and competition
from every other school in the
country, Brennan nabs the na
tion's top recruits almost every
year.
And once they get here, he
isn't through with them. As a
freshman, Sandra Birch played
at No. 4 singles for the Cardi
nal. As a sophomore, she won
the NCAA singles title.
Brennan had something to
do with the improvement,
I just hope nobody is think
ing about firing him.

Chris Crader is still The Dai
ly's Tuesday sports columnist.
However, it has been rumored
that if he doesn't stop writing
about the NBA and random,
irrelevant ESPN events, he may
be joining his buddies Terry
and Jimmy in the job hunt.

page, of course). And I was

stunned to see Jimmy Rodgers
had been fired as the coach of
the Boston Celtics.
Now all Rodgers has done
lately is take one of the oldest
teams in professional sports to
the fourth-best record in the
Eastern Division of the NBA.
Last year, with star forward
Larry Bird out for almost the
entire season, Rodgers directed
the team to the playoffs any
way.
This year, with a guy no one
has ever heard of (Reggie
Lewis) and four other guys
whose average age is 34 (Bird,
Dennis Johnson, Kevin McHale
and Robert Parrish) as his
starting lineup, the Celtics had
a fine year. But because of one
game — a 121-114 loss to the
New York Knicks in Boston
Garden — he got the axe.
Aside from the total silliness
required to fire such a success
ful coach, the Celtics front of
fice is setting itself up to look
very stupid next year. With
everyone getting a year older
and with no high draft choice,
Boston will likely be somewhat
worse next season.
And while some good
coaches are getting fired,
some great coaches are
not getting the recognition
they deserve. When John
Wooden won a bunch of NCAA
titles in rapid succession he
was named the Wizard of
Westwood and went down in
history as the greatest coach
in collegiate history.
Yet Frank Brennan has won
five consecutive NCAA wom
en's tennis titles — and seven
in the last nine years — yet
he gets the same treatment as
the Los Angeles Lakers' Pat
Riley gets. You know, the "His
team's so talented, 1 could
coach it," routine.
But how did the team get so
talented?
In Brennan's case, he man
aged to convince most of the
top high school tennis players
in the nation that Stanford was
where they wanted to go. De
spite the high admissions
standards and competition
from every other school in the
country, Brennan nabs the na
tion's top recruits almost every
year.
And once they get here, he
isn't through with them. As a
freshman, Sandra Birch played
at No. 4 singles for the Cardi
nal. As a sophomore, she won
the NCAA singles title.
Brennan had something to
do with the improvement,
I just hope nobody is think
ing about firing him.

Chris Crader is still The Dai
ly's Tuesday sports columnist.
However, it has been rumored
that if he doesn't stop writing
about the NBA and random,
irrelevant ESPN events, he may
be joining his buddies Terry
and Jimmy in the job hunt.
