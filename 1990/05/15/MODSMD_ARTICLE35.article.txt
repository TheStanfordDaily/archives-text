# Sackinsky drinks his milk, sets them down for Cardinal
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
The Baltimore Orioles must know
something when it comes to pitchers
from Pennsylvania. After all, they
drafted Mike Mussina in 1987. And last
year, the Orioles took right-hander
Brian Sackinsky from Library, Penn.,
in the June draft.
Like his counterpart, Sackinsky
turned down Baltimore's offer of a pro
fessional contract to attend college. But
he still had to choose a school, with
Florida State and Stanford the top con
tenders. Needless to say, Sackinsky
chose Stanford, and he is extremely glad
he did.
"A guy died down there [Florida
State] from arm surgery," Sackinsky
says. "I'm not saying that they have a
bad program, but they are having a lot
of problems. I love it here."
The Cardinal is also pleased that
Sackinsky chose to come West. Before
last weekend's homestand against USC,
he had managed to rack up a record of
7-1 with one save in 19 games. After
Friday, Trojan Coach Mike Gillespie
would have rather seen Sackinsky stay
back East.
With the Cardinal trailing 1-0 in the
sixth inning, Sackinsky came on in relief
for Stan Spencer. In a brilliant relief
effort, he shut out the Trojans for the
final four innings while striking out
seven. His efforts enabled Stanford to
win the contest in the bottom of the
ninth, giving the freshman a stellar 8-1
mark.
"Sackinsky came in and really gave
them what they had to have," Gillespie
said. "We had good at-bats against Spen
cer, but Sackinsky was quite dominant."
But the season hasn't been as smooth
as the hurler's record makes it appear.
Projected as the third starter in the
Cardinal rotation early in the year,
Sackinsky was unable to be consistent
in his starting roles. He threw a near
no-hitter (eight and one-third innings)
against Fresno State March 26, but that

was sandwiched between two bad starts
against Arizona State.
Sackinsky believes that several things
contributed to that inconsistency. Along
with trying to throw too many different
pitches and feeling a little pressure as
a freshman, he felt that he wasn't drink
ing enough milk. With the soda mac
hines in the food service lines,
Sackinsky had started drinking more
Coca-Cola. Soon thereafter, he devel
oped a sore back and problems with his
ankle. His mother provided the solution.
"I have never broken any bones be
cause I drank a lot of milk when I was
at home," Sackinsky says. "My mom
came out after I got hurt, and she told
me that I better start drinking milk. I
did, and I'm feeling better."
But consuming more milk wasn't
going to satisfy Coach Marquess. He
took Sackinsky out of the starting role
and put him in the bullpen where he
could concentrate on relief work. "When
Sackinsky was starting, he just didn't
respond well," Marquess says. "But,
when he comes out of the bullpen, he
goes right at them."
With last weekend's performance
against USC and his relief appearance
at California May 5 — where he gave
up only one run in four and one-third
innings to earn the win — it appears
that the freshman is gladly taking the

advice from his teammates and coaches.
He didn't always listen to advice so
quickly, however. Last summer, his
American Legion coach wanted him to
stay on his team for the playoffs, but
Sackinsky had different plans. He
wanted to play in the U.S. Olympic
Festival.
"At first I didn't realize how much
of a big deal it was. The coach (from
the Olympic team) called me, and I told
him that I would think about it," Sack
insky explains. "But, I decided that I
wanted to pitch against the best in the
country."
The Festival gave him the exposure
he needed to get selected to play for
the USA at the World Junior Champi
onships in Canada.
Those two tournaments allowed him
to get in some much needed work on
his fastball, as well as his control, before
showing up for fall practice at Stanford.
During his senior season in high school,
it rained so frequently that he didn't
have time to get his arm in shape.
"Scouts would come in the first in
ning and leave. I was only throwing
83-84 mph," he explains. "I didn't have
a real good senior year." The work paid
off, as Sackinsky now throws his fastball
around 90 mph, and Marquess describes
him as a pitcher with good control.
Milk, it does a body good. Pass it on.

Freshman right-hander Brian Sackinsky had one of his finest outings of the year
on Friday, coming on in relief to shut down USC and get the victory. Sackinsky
owns an 8-1 record on the season, which puts him in the record books for the
moment — tied for third in single season win-loss percentage.
