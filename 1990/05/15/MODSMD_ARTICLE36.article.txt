# Stanford to host regional
## 
### 
Although many speculated that it
wouldn't happen, Stanford will host
the West I NCAA Baseball Regional
next week. The Cardinal and five
other teams (to be named next Mon
day) will take the field May 24-27
for a spot in the 1990 College World
Series.
It was rumored that Sunken Dia
mond would be passed over by the
selection committee because of its

limited seating and lack of lighting
for night games. Instead, the NCAA
went with tradition instead of money
— the Pacific 10 Southern Division
champion customarily is awarded a
regional.
The multiple games will neces
sitate some 9 a.m. starting times.
Information on ticket sales was not
available as of last night.
