# Kennedy makes statement on rape
## President urges men to understand rules of consent, modify behavior 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
Urging men to modify their sexual
behavior, University President Donald
Kennedy made his first statement about
sexual assault on campus last night to
open Rape Awareness Week.
Kennedy said he was "surprised" by
recent requests for an official University
statement against rape because he
thought it would be equivalent to an
nouncing "murder is wrong."
Also, already-existing University re
sponses to the problem — such as coun
seling and installing campus lighting —
constitute "actions" that matter more
than statements, according to Kennedy.
However, on the occasion of Rape
Awareness Week, Kennedy took the op
portunity to offer some "substantive"
remarks. He said addressing men is "the
most useful contribution I can make."
Kennedy identified a "misapprehen
sion, which I am afraid is fairly wide
spread among young men, that forcible
sex can be the expected endpoint of
progressive intimacy, instead of a plain
act of criminal violence."
Focusing on acquaintance rapes, Ken

nedy outlined some rules for male be
havior, which he added "apply equally
to same-gender sexual relations."
• The first rule Kennedy stated is,
"'No' means no," and its meaning is
"immutable." He said any man should
be "embarrassed" by trying to justify
a sexual assault because "things had
gone too far to stop."
• Second, "Silence ... is not the equiv
alent of 'yes.' Expressed consent is nec
essary," said Kennedy.
• Third, Kennedy offered some exam
ples of when "'Yes' does not necessarily
mean yes" — such as when "there is
even a hint of coercion ... or some
implied threat of force" or when the

victim's reason is impaired by alcohol
or a debilitating emotional state.
These are, I think, pretty simple
rules," Kennedy summarized.
In a telephone interview after the
speech, junior Suzanne O'Brien, co
chair of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, said she thinks the
problem of rape should be addressed
"in the context of a community" and
not just toward men.
Although she applauded Kennedy for
making the statement, O'Brien criti
cized him for not looking at why rapes
occur or their effect on society.
"[Kennedy] said he sees sexual assault
as a simple moral question," she ex
plained. "Though it may be clear to
him, it's not as clear to assailants —
many of whom don't think of their be
havior as criminal or victims — who
feel they've brought it on themselves."
Kennedy also lauded the bravery of
women who have reported rapes. He
said few men "understand how difficult
(reporting a sexual assaultl is, given the
complex mixture of horror, shame and
guilt that are frequently part of the
victim's lot in the aftermath of sexual
assault."
