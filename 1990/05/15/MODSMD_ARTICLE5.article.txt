# 'Love and bad karma and stuff
## Alum discusses Tony award-winning play, future projects 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
As a sophomore at Stanford,
David Henry Hwang brought a
copy of a play he had written to
a professor in the English Depart
ment. The professor, Hwang
recalled, told him it was "really
bad."
Hwang spent his next few years
seeing and reading "as many plays
as I could." His efforts have
clearly paid off: Several awards
— including the 1988 Tony award
for Best Play for "M. Butterfly"
— pay tribute to the fact that
Hwang is well past his "really
bad" days.
Hwang returned to Stanford
last night, speaking to a large
crowd at Roble Hall about his
evolution as a writer.
In an interview with The Daily
yesterday, Hwang said he had
never written a play before com
ing to Stanford. As a freshman
in Madera House, he went to plays
in San Francisco and thought,

"Gee, I can do that."
Hwang, who graduated in 1979,
spent his remaining time at Stan
ford "figuring out that writing
plays was maybe something I
wanted to do and then starting
to learn how to do that."
Hwang's position as a theme
assistant in Okada House was one
factor which led to his interest in
"the experience of Asians in
America and what it meant to be
Chinese and American." These is
sues influence much of his work,
he explained.
Hwang's first three plays
"really dealt with the issue of
being an Asian in America." How
ever, Hwang said that "after a
point I got sort of tired of that."
He described "M. Butterfly," his
most recent play, as examining
"the larger picture . . . Asia and
the West. Other times I have proj
ects that don't have anything to
do with Asia at all."
Hwang admitted that he was
"a little surprised" at the phe
nomenal success of "M. Butter

fly," including the Tony Award.
He was especially pleased because
"M. Butterfly" was "not a play
that I'd written necessarily with
a lot of commercial intent .. . it's
a play that I wrote because I
believed in it, and I found it in
teresting. The fact that other
people have seen fit to agree with
me is icing on the cake."
Hwang said he realizes that "it's
not likely my next play will do as
well" as "M. Butterfly." He said
that one negative effect of having
a successful play is that a little
doubt about the potential com
mercial success makes him ner
vous.
Next fall he will begin work on
his first film, tentatively titled
"Red Angel." Hwang wrote the
screenplay and will also direct the
film, which will be shot in San
Francisco. He describes the sub
ject of the film as "love and bad
karma and stuff."
He is also finishing the screen
