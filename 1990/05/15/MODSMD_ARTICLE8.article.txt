# Acting director of Hoover given permanent post
## 
### Leland Lo 
In a move that is expected to continue
the thawing of relations between the Hoo
ver Institution and the University, John
Raisian was named the permanent director
of the think tank yesterday.
Raisian, acting director of the Hoover
Institution since September, succeeds W.
Glenn Campbell, who served as Hoover
director from 1960 until 1989.
The selection ends more than a year of
speculation about who would serve as the
new director. Possible candidates for the
position included Economics Prof. Michael
Boskin, chair of the President's Council of

Economic Advisers and John Deutsch,
provost of MIT.
Unlike Campbell, whose leadership style
was often controversial, Raisian is widely
regarded as an administrative moderate.
The unanimity of the search committee's
recommendation of Raisian may be one
indication of the continuing improvement
of the institution's relationship with the
University.
University President Donald Kennedy
and Robert Mallot, chairman of the Hoover
Board of Overseers, were both pleased with
the appointment.
Provost James Rosse, who has worked
closely with Raisian since his appointment

as acting director, said that Raisian has
"demonstrated good judgment" and will
help the Hoover Institution fulfill its mis
sion as a "policy research institute."
Raisian said he is "pleased and honored
to take on the challenge" that this appoint
ment offers. "There are profound social
changes currently taking place in the
world," Raisian said.
Raisian said he hopes to "lead the schol
arship effort toward studying the effects
of these changes."
"With communism waning, we are no
longer looking at the disadvantage of com
munism but now suddenly find ourselves
looking at how countries perform transi

tions in their political and economic struc
ture," said Raisian.
Raisian was nominated for the post by
a search committee that was headed by
Hoover senior fellow Gerald Dorfman and
included three other Hoover senior fellows,
three members of the Hoover Board of
Overseers and three members appointed
by Kennedy.
The search committee reviewed more
than 100 candidates for the position. The
selection of Raisian was approved by the
Stanford Board of Trustees, the Hoover
Institution Board of Overseers and the
Board of Directors of the Herbert Hoover
Foundation.
