BRACE YOURSELF FOR LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN
- Bruce Williamson, PLAYBOY
LAST EXIT
TO BROOKLYN
"AN EPIC...
UNCOMMONLY EVOCATIVE...
The performances are nearly
perfect ... Its wit is savage...
The movie commands attention
from the opening shots...
the scale is big, the details
meticulous...Elegiac."
Vincent Canby, THE NEW YORK TIMES
The film's elegiac note is lust
right... The movie, thanks to Leigh's
quirky, iridescent performance,
gets a worthy climax."
Georgia Brown, VILLAGE VOlCE
"WHAT A MOVIE!
Brilliant and amazingly tender...
An astonishing cast"
Dennis Dermody, PAPER
