Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. is the nation's leader in the
research, analysis, and prevention of engineering failures.
Founded in 1967 by a group of Stanford engineers, we've
since analyzed thousands of failures —from airplane
crashes to building collapses, from power plant failures to
supertanker sinkings. We currently have opportunities for
two entry-level Research Assistants to perform a variety of
research and project coordination functions.
Specific responsibilities include organizing and compiling
reference and statistical data, conducting telephone and
field surveys, and investigating industry and government
standards. In addition, these positions perform risk analy
ses, summarize depositions, and serve as the liaison be
tween cl ients and staff regarding current projects and cases.
We require a BA/BS and strong analytical and mathemati
cal aptitude. Excellent verbal and written communication
skills are also necessary. Computer experience, including
knowledge of word processing and spreadsheet applica
tions, is required. We are seeking well-organized self-start
ers with the interpersonal skills to interact successfully with
all levels of tec hnical and non-technical personnel.
We offer a compensation and benefits package that ex
ceeds industry standards. Please send your resume and
cover letter, indicating location desired, to Barbara Kirk,
Dept. 8R843, Human Resources, Failure Analysis
Associates, Inc., P.O. Box 3015, Menlo Park, CA 94025,
or fax to (415) 328-3049. Equal Opportunity Employer.
