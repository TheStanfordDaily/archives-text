# It's for real: Gorbachev coming to campus June 4
## 
### Kim Freidberg Editorial staff 
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev will definitely visit Stan
ford June 4 and will probably
spend two hours on campus, So
viet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin
and American officials confirmed
yesterday.
The Soviet Embassy has asked
the University to propose an
agenda for Gorbachev's 11 a.m. to
1 p.m. visit, University President
Donald Kennedy said at a press
conference. Soviet officials have
not said why Gorbachev wants to
visit Stanford nor what he wants
to do here.
"We haven't decided yet what

to do with him," said Kennedy,
although he speculated that Gor
bachev will want to meet with
scholars from the Hoover Institu
tion, the Center for Economic
Policy Research and the Center
for International Security and
Arms Control.
Rumors continued to circulate
in the national media that Gor
bachev plans to give a mtyor ad
dress at Stanford. However, a
spokesperson at the Soviet Em
bassy would not confirm the
reports.
Kennedy mentioned "there is a
possibility that Mr. Gorbachev will
want to give a public address.
"I certainly hope . .. that Stan
ford faculty and students would

have a chance to hear him," Ken
nedy said, adding that security
requirements will play a role in
shaping the agenda.
Gorbachev, the first Soviet head
of state to visit Stanford, is also
expected to meet with former Sec
retary of State George Shultz,
now a professor at the Graduate
School of Business.
Shultz was one of the first U.S.
officials to meet with Gorbachev
after he took power in the Soviet
Union in 1985, and administra
tors have suggested that Shultz's
expertise in international econom
ics may have influenced the Soviet
leader's decision to visit Stanford.
Gorbachev will arrive in San
Francisco following his May 30-

June 3 summit meeting with
President Bush in Washington,
D.C.
Robert Freelen, vice president
for public affairs, is in charge of
drawing up an initial agenda and
will be coordinating the event in
conjunction with the Soviet Em
bassy, the White House and the
State Department.
Hoover Institution Director
John Raisian said he believes
"Gorbachev would be especially
interested in the collections we
have within the Hoover Library
and archives containing important
historical documents."
The Hoover Institution houses
the world'B largest collection of
material on the 1917 Russian

Revolution.
The announcement of Gorba
chev's visit took many senior Uni
versity officials by surprise
Monday when it was broadcast by
the national media. Kennedy said
he "heard about it from some
passerby" before confirming the
visit with the Soviet Embassy.
"I am both surprised and
pleased, but somewhat more
pleased than surprised," said Ken
nedy.
Many scholars at Stanford ex
pressed enthusiasm about the im
pending visit.
"The Soviet Union is facing cru
cial economic choices in the im


Mikhail Gorbachev
mediate future, and Stanford
economists have a tradition of of
fering research and advice on im
portant public policy issues," said
Gavin Wright, chair of the Eco
nomics Department, and John
Shoven, director of the Center for
Economic Policy, in a joint state
ment.
Asked how much he believed
could actually be accomplished in

two hours, Kennedy responded by
describing Gorbachev as "extraor
dinarily quick."
"I have enormous respect for
his capacity," Kennedy said. "I
think a great deal could be taken
away from this meeting."
A factor that may have influ
enced Gorbachev's decision to visit
was former Soviet Minister of De
fense Sergei Ahkromeyev's trip to
Stanford last fall. Ahkromeyev
spent time with Shultz and was
reportedly impressed with Hoo
ver's extensive archives on the So
viet Union.

University administrators sug
gested that Gorbachev may have
decided to accept a standing invi
tation to speak, originally offered
for the 1985 commencement. Re
cently, the ASSU Speakers Bureau
also extended an invitation to the
Soviet leader.
The last Soviet head of state to
visit the Bay Area was Nikita
Khrushchev, who in 1959 gave a
speech in San Francisco.
It is not yet known whether
Raisa Gorbachev, the Soviet pres
ident's wife, will be accompanying
her husband.
