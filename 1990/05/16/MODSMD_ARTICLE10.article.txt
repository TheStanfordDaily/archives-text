# Next fraternal adviser will have less time to devote to Greeks
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
When fraternal affairs adviser Michael
Hughes leaves Stanford after this aca
demic year, sororities and fraternities will
lose more than a familiar face.
Next year, the responsibilities of the
fraternal affairs adviser will be expanded
to include programming and advising for
other organizations, causing a significant
reduction in the adviser's exclusive at
tention to the Greek system.
This modification will result from the
merger of Fraternal Affairs, Student Or
ganization Services, Tresidder Union
Programs and ASSU administration into
a new Office of Student Activities and

Fraternal Affairs, according to Michael
Jackson, associate dean for campus af
fairs.
Jackson said broadening the fraternal
affairs adviser's responsibilities does not
represent a genuine departure from past
University policy, because "when the po
sition was originally created, several
years ago, the intention was to have a
half-time fraternal affairs adviser who
would have additional responsibilities for
student affairs."
Although former fraternal affairs ad
viser Joe Pisano followed this formula,
acting also as judicial affairs adviser and
summer orientation coordinator, Jackson
explained that the University "wanted to
give Hughes one year to get used to"

Stanford and the Greek system before
diversifying his job.
Thus, Jackson said of the anticipated
change in the fraternal affairs adviser
position, "Nothing has changed
philosophically; we're just rounding out
the position, and we were going to do
that anyway."
Nevertheless, some sorority and frater
nity members are worried about the loss
of a full-time adviser, as the new plan
calls for the adviser to devote only 40 to
60 percent of the position to the Greek
system.
"We need more than 40 percent of the
new adviser's job," said newly elected In
terfraternity Council President Erik Jor
gensen, although he added that "we do

understand that the University is making
cuts and that everybody has to give a
little bit."
Jackson said the new adviser will not
be selected until the University's
budgetary revisions are concluded.
While Jackson admitted that "overall,
we are clearly going to save money in
the merger," he emphasized that organ
izational practicality also characterizes
the change.
Jorgensen said he the new adviser's
additional responsibilities may interfere
with the sort of "personal consultation"
readily available this year with Hughes,
who had time to promote "one-on-one
dialogues" outside of regular meetings.
Hughes agreed that "the personal

touch with the Greek community is likely
to be reduced because the adviser will
be responsible for more groups."
Erin Scalley, the new Intersorority
Council president, said "it will be harder
without someone there 100 percent of
the time."
However, Scalley's predecessor, Pam
Simpson, pointed out that a less acces
sible fraternal affairs adviser might ac
tually benefit the sororities and
fraternities by forcing increased self
reliance.
"The change will definitely make
things harder, but it won't kill the Greek
system, and perhaps it will be good be
cause we'll be taking on more responsi
bility," said Simpson.
