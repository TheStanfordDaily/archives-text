# Palo Alto seeks cheaper land lease
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Faced with nearly a $100,000
yearly deficit, the Palo Alto City
Council hopes to reach an agree
ment with Stanford concerning a
land rent increase the city can't
afford to pay.
Palo Alto agreed to lease the
land from Stanford in 1915 for a
period of 98 years.
One 11-acre patch, located
across from the Stanford Shop
ping Center, contains El Camino
Park, which has Palo Alto's only
lighted softball and soccer fields.
Another 12 acres includes the
Mac Arthur Park Restaurant,
American Red Cross, Holiday Inn
and Southern Pacific train depot.
In January, Stanford raised the
annual rent by $100,000, to
$434,823. The increase resulted
from an agreement between Palo
Alto and Stanford to re-evaluate
the market price of the land every
five years.
The council refuses to pay the
rent increase because it leaves the
city with a budget shortfall. Ac
cording to a May 3 report released
by the council to the city's Finance
and Public Works Committee,
"this year the city will pay about
$97,000 more per year than it
receives from the tenants and
park users."
A large part of the gap comes
from insufficient El Camino Park
user fees. City council member
Jean McCown said the rates paid
by groups who use the park have
not been raised to reflect the Jan
uary rent increase.

Stanford raised Palo
Alto's rent for 23
acres of land by
$100,000 â€” and the
city can't afford it.

"That gap is just going to get
bigger," said McCown.
The report said that "Stanford
University has expressed a will
ingness to work with the city as
long as there is no reduction in
rent." Stanford's Lands Manage
ment office could not be reached
for comment.
However, Bill Fellman, real es
tate property manager for Palo
Alto, confirmed last week that
"Stanford and the city are throw
ing up options to reduce the rent."
The city council now hopes to
reach an agreement with Stanford
to reduce the rent, according Andy
Doty, director of community rela
tions for Stanford.
But in exchange, Stanford
wants the right to develop a com
mercial research park along an
undeveloped patch of land on
Arastradero Road, Doty said. Cur
rently designated for housing de
velopment, the land would have
to be rezoned to allow for com
mercial use.
The University would receive
greater revenue from research
than housing, Doty said.
But McCown pointed out that
the Arastradero strip "has been

a bone of contention" between
Palo Alto and Stanford.
While Stanford would like to
see the land commercially devel
oped, McCown noted that more
housing is needed because cur
rently "there are more jobs in Palo
Alto than people who live there."
While no formal date has been
set to reach an agreement, Doty
said the Finance and Public Works
Committee met May 9 "and said
the two sides should continue
talking."
City council member Jack
Sutorius said the committee has
recommended to the council that
it pay the rent it owes Stanford
for 1989-90.
"We're not excited or delighted
about such a very, very large
amount, but we're recommending
that the council ... approve pay
ment of the budgeted amount,"
Sutorius said.
"In my judgment, neither party
is going to get exactly what they
would like," he added. "Any com
promise means both parties . ..
have to accommodate more than
they would ideally do on an inde
pendent basis."
McCown said "the press of
other business," including start
ing the whole city budget process,
may keep the council from reach
ing an agreement with Stanford
until as late as July.
"We did not set a date for this
to return to our agenda," Sutorius
said. For now, both the city coun
cil and Stanford's Lands Manage
ment office await further
negotiations pending the progress
made by the two groups' staffs.
