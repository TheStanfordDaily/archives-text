# Baker arrives in Moscow for arms talks

MOSCOW (AP) â€” Secretary of
State James Baker, backed by three
dozen advisers, arrived in the Soviet
capital yesterday to try to overcome
deep differences over missile reduc
tions that could impede success at the
Washington summit.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
is due to see President Bush in only
two weeks, and senior Baker aides said
on the flight to Moscow that at least
four key issues were unresolved.
Already, the two sides have decided
to resume negotiations in Geneva right
after Baker concludes his visit on Sat
urday, take a break for the May 30-
June 3 summit, and then work
through the summer.
This suggests there is little hope
that Baker, in his talks with Gorbachev
and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevard
nadze, can settle all the remaining is
sues in time for a summit declaration.
The differences are over restrictions
to be placed on cruise missiles aboard
fighter planes and warships, on mobile
missiles with multiple warheads and
on heavy land-based missiles.
Also, in more than 400 pages of
proposed treaty text compiled in
Geneva, the two sides have not fixed
on a scheme for verifying compliance
with the reductions in strategic nu
clear weapons.
Gorbachev is to arrive in Washing
ton May 30 after visiting Canada the
previous day. After his summit meet
ings with Bush, at the White House
and at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md., he is to fly to Minneapolis
on June 3, to visit with business and
agricultural leaders, and then on to
San Francisco for a speech at nearby
Stanford University.
Two U.S. officials, who spoke to
reporters traveling with Baker on con

dition they would not be identified,
said the Soviets had backtracked in
talks in Washington last month after
considerable headway was made in
February talks in Moscow.
"There has been some movement to
try to pick up the pieces," one of the
officials said of the continuing talks

in Geneva. But he declined to venture
a prediction of Baker success or
describe recent headway as substan
tial.
On two other arms control fronts
the outlook also is cloudy.
Completion of a U.S.-Soviet accord
at the summit pledging to cease pro

duction of chemical weapons depends
on the Soviets agreeing to a schedule
to destroy their stockpiles.
And differences over verification
methods and limiting aircraft stand in
the way of an accord between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact to reduce troops
and tanks in Europe.
