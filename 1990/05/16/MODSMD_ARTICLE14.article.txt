# Bush urges fast action on cutting deficit

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush opened the domestic budget sum
mit yesterday by calling the U.S. econ
omy "not as strong or secure as it
should be" and urging fast action to
trim a widening federal budget deficit.
At the same time, Bush assured the
team of 21 congressional negotiators
there was no immediate crisis, partic
ipants ssyd.
Lawmakers who attended the one
hour, 40-minute session at the White
House said the president did not bring
up the possibility of tax increases to
cut the deficit nor make any other
specific recommendations.
But he promised to share the re
sponsibility with Congress for difficult
and unpopular measures to try to
slash $50 billion or more from the
deficit, the participants said.

"It was pretty clear that we're going
to share the heat," said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif.
Democrats, who approached yester
day's budget talks with some skep
ticism, said afterward they were will
ing to join the Republican administra
tion in a full-scale assault on the na
tion's deficit problems.
"We're going into these talks in good
faith and with an effort to find a con
structive solution," said House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
"We're not going in with any other
purpose."
But Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said he could not
say whether Bush's words to negotia
tors would diminish Democratic sus
picion that the administration might

be setting a trap to blame Democrats
for tax increases.
"We are going forward ... because
we believe this is a serious problem
confronting the nation that we must
deal with in a responsible nature,"
Mitchell said, speaking to reporters
outside the White House.
Deficit cuts of the magnitude being
discussed by the president likely would
require a mix of deep spending cuts
and tax increases. But in recent days
each side has suggested the other
would have to be the first to propose
any tax increase.
Senate Budget Committee Chair
man James Sasser, D-Tenn., said that
Budget Director Richard Darman told
the congressional negotiators that the
deficit for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 would be $140 billion to $188

billion if the costs of bailing out the
savings and loan industry are counted.
If those expenses are not included,
Darman said the deficit would be
about $138 billion range.
Bush declined to answer questions
at a picture-taking session as he and
other top administration officials met
with the congressional leaders in the
Cabinet Room.
But White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater afterward quoted Bush as
telling the negotiators that, while
there was no "immediate crisis," fast
action was crucial.
"We are fortunate that the economy
continues to grow, but it is important
to act while the economy is still
growing, for growth is not as strong
or secure as it should be," Bush was
quoted by his spokesman as saying.
