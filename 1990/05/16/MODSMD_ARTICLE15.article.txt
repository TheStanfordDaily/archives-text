# Flooding continues destruction

LIBERTY, Texas (AP) — Engineers opened
floodgates wider yesterday to release a record flow
of water from a flood-burdened reservoir, and some
downstream residents who had not already
evacuated called for help.
Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were
declared a federal disaster area by President Bush
as National Guardsmen labored to shore up a weak
ened levee protecting a small town from the Red
River, which continued its steady climb toward a
45-year high.
In neighboring Louisiana, residents stacked
sandbags around homes near the Red River and
some evacuated.
Elsewhere, creeks and rivers rose sharply in west
ern and central Missouri, including the Kansas City
area, as thunderstorms continued to dump heavy
rain throughout the region. Many streets were
flooded and more rain was expected.
Residents of low-lying areas along the Trinity
River in southeastern Texas braced for the worst
as engineers at Lake Livingston Dam cranked open
the taps to release a record flow 85,000 cubic feet
per second to protect the dam from a record flood.
Releases of more than 20,000 cfs cause at least
some flooding below the dam.
The river's crest was expected to reach the dam
today, and releases could reach 100,000 cfs that day
or tomorrow, causing the worst flooding in 80 years
in the small communities downstream.
Flooding along the Trinity began two weeks ago

in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, forcing hundreds of
people from their homes.
In Arkansas, agencies differed on the numbers of
houses affected by flooding on the Arkansas and
Red rivers. The state Office of Emergency Services
estimated 493 houses sustained some kind of flood
damage, said spokesman Gary Talley. Red Cross
spokesman David Threkelsen said their count stood
at 337 but that surveys were continuing.
The president's disaster declaration makes federal
funding available through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to supplement the recovery of
residents and businesses in Crawford, Faulkner,
Jefferson, Little River, Perry, Pulaski and Sebastian
counties.
The disaster declaration was requested last week
by Gov. Bill Clinton, who renewed the request yes
terday saying, "devastating flooding unprecedented
in recent history continues to this day."
Clinton estimated that losses to public and private
property will exceed $20 million.
In Louisiana, about 300 homes have been
evacuated along the Red River from Shreveport
southward as the river climbed toward a 45-year
high.
Emergency workers ringed homes with sandbags
in a low-lying area of Shreveport, where the Red
was expected to crest Wednesday at 34.8 feet, about
5 feet above flood stage. That will be higher than
a 1957 flood, but not a record.
