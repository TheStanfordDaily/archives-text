# College suicide study released

NEW YORK (AP) â€” College students com
mit suicide at about half the rate of non
students their age, and suicide rates at highly
competitive schools are not significantly dif
ferent from those at less rigorous ones, an
expert says.
Allan Schwartz, chief of the University
Health Services' Mental Health Section at the
University of Rochester, said students are less
likely than others their age to kill themselves
chiefly because they have less access to guns.
Recent data for college students show a
suicide rate of six or seven per 100,000 student
years, he said. A student-year is like a man
hour: 10 student-years can mean one year for
10 students or 10 years for one student.
The college rate is about half that for an
age-matched group composed equally of each
sex, he said.
Two lines of evidence suggest that lack of
access to guns plays the major role, he said.
Whatever the pressures of a rigorous school,
no link between suicide rates and college com
petitiveness has been observed so far, suggest
ing that if one does exist it is only minor.
