Hubble finally focuses
WASHINGTON (AP) - Hubble
Space Telescope engineers gave an
upbeat report yesterday: The tele
scope has found the stars it was sup
posed to find.
"For the first time we now are
sure we know where we are point
ing," said Ed Weiler, NASA program
scientist for the $1.5 billion instru
ment. "We can point to a place in
space and actually find the stars that
are supposed to be there, lock up on
them, measure them and use them
for focusing."
Satellite may be rescued
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -
NASA said yesterday it will send up
a shuttle to rescue a communications
satellite left stranded in a uselessly
low orbit, provided the satellite's

mission.
Intelsat, a not-for-profit consor
tium of 119 countries that operates
a global communications satellite sys
tem, will decide whether to accept
NASA's offer at its board of gover
nors meeting in Barbados next

Drug dealers evicted
ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - People
conducting drug deals in their public
housing units could lose their leases

under a program Housing Secretary
Jack Kemp unveiled yesterday.
"A judicial order for forfeiture of
assets is a very powerful weapon,"
Kemp told several hundred state and
local drug war officials at a confer
ence called by the Office of National
Drug Control Policy. "It allows the

public housing authority to take over
the trafficker's unit immediately."

nouncing the settlement yesterday.

Report urges pre-emption
WASHINGTON (AP) - A presi
dential commission said yesterday

spond to air terrorism with "preemp
tive or retaliatory military strikes"

sengers of credible terrorist threats
and said the government should take
more seriously the possibility of ter
