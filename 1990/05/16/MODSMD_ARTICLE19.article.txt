## Insulting remarks

JIMMY BRESLIN'S RECENT
racist and sexist tirade against
New York Newsday reporter
Ji-Yeon Yuh shows the relevance
of Stanford's Fundamental Stand
ard debate to the real world.
Breslin, a Newsday columnist,
reacted stongly after Yuh, a 1987
graduate of Stanford, sent him a
memo criticizing one of his
columns for inappropriate and of
fensive sexist remarks. In a
newsroom outburst, Breslin called
Yuh a "yellow cur," "slant-eyed,"
and a "c —."
Bigotry is not confined to Stan
ford or the Newsday newsroom. It
occurs all the time, and most
people feel powerless to overcome
oppressive environments.
Yuh's criticism of Breslin's sexist

remarks in his column and her
speaking out regarding his out
burst are models of courage.
It seems clear that legislation
would not have stopped Breslin's
actions. Regardless of how many
rules are made, violations will al
ways occur.
Reaction by Newsday staff and
the community at large played a
role in causing Breslin's two
week suspension. However, the
suspension did not occur until after
Breslin showed the insincerity of
his apology on a radio talk show.
As Yuh said, it is sad that racism
and sexism continue to exist —
even in Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalists. However, this incident
is a positive example of how every
one needs to play a role in fighting
discrimination.
