WHEN DISCUSSING A
topic as serious as AIDS,
sensitivity is vital.
But with their actions last week
at an AIDS information session,
the Stanford College Republicans
insensitively ignored a crucial dis
cussion on the issue.
With fliers distributed campus
wide, the College Republicans ad
vertised a showing of the film
"AIDS: What You Haven't Been
Told," with the assertion that it
"aims to correct misinformation."
Obviously, the subject matter and
presentation of the film were very
controversial. By all indications,
the showing was public and open
to all.
If they presumed to establish the
legitimacy of their beliefs, the
Stanford College Republicans
should have been prepared to deal
with the controversy. However,
they did not even wait to hear
people's responses to the film,

much less engage in a dialogue.
Rather than correcting "misin
formation," the College Republi
cans made controversial and
sensationalist assertions that they
failed to support.
AIDS is a serious issue that man
dates sensitive and thoughtful dis
cussion. The callousness and
arrogance of the College Republi
cans is not merely tasteless — their
actions and attitudes are poten
tially harmful to the entire Stan
ford community, as well as to
individuals within the community.
The conduct of the College Re
publicans would be inappropriate
at any time. The fact that this
incident occured during Gay And
Lesbian Awareness Week is partic
ularly disturbing.
While the damage is already
done, the Stanford College Repub
licans should, at the very least,
issue an apology to the gay and
lesbian community at Stanford.
