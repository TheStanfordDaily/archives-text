Students, COP excited about student government

WE, THE COUNCIL of
Presidents-elect, want to greet
you and lay out some of our
plans for the coming year. We realize
that we are taking office after a partic
ularly close and controversial election.
We recognize that we will have to
work hard to ensure that all students
feel represented.
Several challenges now face Stanford
students and the ASSU. The most
obvious is the budget cuts.
We want to make sure that you
continue to have channels through
which you can express your priorities,
whether they be computer clusters,
quality residential education, committ
ment to University Committee on
Minority Issues goals or the overseas
campus in Tours. We encourage you to
continue writing letters to administra
tors and to attend open budget-cut

meetings during this crucial time.
Students have pointed out two spe
cific problems that the ASSU must
solve. One is student access to ASSU
information. The ASSU Bylaws can be
clarified to make student access to
information and files easier.
The other problem is the vagueness
of the Bylaws which gave rise to the
elections controversy. The definition of
a "vote cast" and what constitutes a
legitimate write-in candidate needs to
be clarified so that what happened this
year does not happen again.
ASSU members, including Elections
Commissioner Steve Krauss and
several concerned students, have set up
a task force to work on a proposal for
the clarification of election rules. The
group now meets at 8:30 p.m. on
Mondays at the ASSU.
A final challenge is building unity in

the Stanford community. In its en
dorsement of our slate, The Daily
asserted that Four Our Future is the
slate best suited to meet the challenge
of representing the diverse interests of
all students during a time of budget
cuts, streamlining and continued dedi
cation to multiculturalism.
We will remain committed to offering
a voice to those students historically
underrepresented in the ASSU, and we
will further our commitment to in
creased student involvement in the
ASSU through committees and an
improved dormitory representative
system.
We want to help leaders from diverse
sectors of the campus share goals and
find common ground. We also have in
mind a campus-wide community service
day.

We know that next year will be
difficult, but we are inspired by the
high level of involvement in the past
election. The emergence of a third
party, the high voter turnout and the
concern over the write-in issue all
show that students care about student
government. We hope to use that
energy and momentum to build a
better Stanford in the coming decade.
As the quarter comes to a close, we
wish you fun in the sunshine and good
luck on finals. If you have any ques
tions or concerns, please call us or
drop by the ASSU.
