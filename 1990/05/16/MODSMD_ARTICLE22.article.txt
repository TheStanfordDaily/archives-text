# Fraternal adviser sparked awareness in Greek system
## 
### 
We would like to thank outgoing
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes for his commitment to stu
dents and his support for the Greek
system at Stanford.
Hughes' resignation is a great loss to
fraternities and sororities. Endowed
with a decade of experience and exten
sive knowledge in fraternal affairs, he
imparted his expertise upon a system
which has greatly improved under his
direction.
His enthusiam for the Greek system
has sparked a new awareness in those
who are in fraternities and sororities.
He has instilled a renewed sense of
pride and affirmation in the positive
role we play in the Stanford communi
ty.

This attitude has challenged mem
bers to re-evaluate their goals and to
focus on those issues which not only
concern themselves but the entire
Stanford community. Such a belief has
also helped to unify the system be
cause fraternal organizations realize
that they share common goals and are
facing many of the same issues such as
multiculturalism, rape eduation and
alcohol policies.
Hughes describes himself as an edu
cator first and foremost, and his ac
tions as fraternal affairs adviser have
proven this dedication.
His door was always open to stu
dents, and he was always willing to
help students with their problems. Yet
he did not wait in his office for stu
dents to come to him — he also
reached out to share with them his
ideas and his goals.
Michael Hughes will be sorely
missed. His charismatic leadership has
raised Stanford's Greek system to a
higher level. Yet we understand his
decision and wish him the very best in

his future plans. We are confident that
the vision and the enthusiasm he in
stilled in us this year will continue
into the future.
