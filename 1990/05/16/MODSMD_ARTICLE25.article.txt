## Who wants a dark tan? 
### 
YOU CAN TELL it's spring when
you see so many folks laying out
in the sun. Folks will lay out
anywhere the sun is beating down, trying
their hardest to put some color in their
skin. I must say, I never have quite un
derstood the tanning ritual.
When I was growing up, the darker
you were, the more you got talked about.
I remember we used to talk about Monica
like a dog. "Creature from the Black
Lagoon," we used to call her because she
was so dark.
Of course Monica's color didn't have
anything to do with tanning — that was
her melanin talking. They teased that
poor child so bad, she'd run home crying.
The idea of getting a tan — of a black
person trying to get darker — was un
heard of. But that didn't keep the black
kids out of the sun. We were always in
the sun, playing kickball, football or
hopscotch.
Of course when we'd go in the house,
we'd get talked about. "The sun 'den
burnt you," my family used to tease me.
For the next few days, I'd stay in the
house until the burn wore off, and then
I'd be right back out there with God's
light beating down on me.
Each year when spring rolled around,
the white kids used to beg the teachers
to go outside to study. Now, the black
kids weren't opposed to going outside.
We loved going outside too; we just didn't
want to be sitting in the hot sun for
nothing.
If we were going to be in the sun, we
wanted to be doing something fun, like
playing kickball or baseball. I guess we

figured the more we moved around, the
less likely we were to get burnt. And
when we did go outside to study, all the
black kids used to head for the shade.
Of course the white kids who couldn't
get a tan — the ones who just turned
red — they'd be heading for the shade
too.
I still don't like the sun beating down
on me for nothing. That's why I cringe
when the professor suggests that we go
outside for class, because I know he or
she is going to pick the sunniest and
hottest spot there is.
When I walk around campus and I see
classes sitting in the quad, where you
can't hide from the sun, I always wonder
how many of the black folks voted to go
outside.
My white friends used to always ask
me if black people could get a tan. They
never really believed me when I told them
"yen," until one yeaf- my family went to
Miami during Christmas break. Needless
to say it was sunny and hot. When I got
back, everybody, even my white friends,
knew I had been in the sun. Now that's
burnt.
While I was trying to hide my tan, my
white friends would wear theirs like a
new pair of designer jeans. Every time
they came back from Spring Break,
they'd come sticking their arms next to
mine. "See, I'm almost as dark as you,"
they'd say with great pride.
Some of them came pretty damn close,
but I knew good and well they didn't
really want to be as dark as me — they
didn't want to be black. I'd just smile
and laugh to myself, because I knew later

I must say, I never have
quite understood the
tanning ritual.

on down the road, if they kept it up,
they were going to be dried-up, wrinkled
and spotted.
But when I think of the scam that
white America ran on us, I don't know
whether I should laugh or cry. While
white America was busy trying to sell
black folks every bleaching cream on the
market, they were busy inventing all
kinds of ways to get darker, from sun
tanning lotions to portable sunlamps.
Unfortunately, some folks are literally
killing themselves via skin cancer in
search of that almighty tan.
What's even more sad is that so many
black kids spend half their lives running
away from their color, trying their hard
est not to get burnt, not just by the sun,
but by a society that views dark skin as
ugly. (If only Monica knew then what we
know now.)
I guess tanning just goes to show you
that being colored ain't so bad after all.
