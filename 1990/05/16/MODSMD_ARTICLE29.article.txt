## Cheerios are crumby 
### Dave Ehrhardt Brian White Staff writers 
Here at Science Bug Re
search Park, we spend most of
our time arguing the deepest
questions of science. Which
came first, the chicken or the
McNuggets? Did anchovies
evolve solely to go on pizzas?
Why is that lout Stallone so
popular? And just where do
Elvis and ancient astronauts
figure into all of this?
Unfortunately, none of this
great wisdom can appear in the
pages of The Daily unless you,
the reader, ask us about it. We
need your questions to distract
us from our fistfights with The
Theology Bug over ensoulment
and transubstantiation. You
can help, or you can just turn
the page.
pv. I am tormented by
W • crumbs at the bottom of
mybox of Cheerios. They're al
ways mixed in with the cereal
and they turn to sludge in milk.
My friend says I should shake
the box to settle them out, but
I thought shaking mixes things
up. What gives?
A. For this, we consulted
• the popular journal "Pow
der Technology" (v. 49:59-69,
1986) where this problem has
been discussed extensively. It
turns out that shaking or
pouring mixtures of different
sized particles causes the larger
ones to rise to the top. This
counter-intuitive process is a
big problem for anyone who
wants to keep mixtures of
solids mixed.
To quote from that article,

which used a computer model
that "shook" a container of
discs of various sizes: "As the
discs fall during a 'shake,'
small discs easily move in
beneath a large disc whenever
gaps open up. A large disc may
move back down if many small
discs simultaneously move
from beneath it. This is an un
likely event, and therefore large
discs move up relative to small
discs."
This occurs if the "large and
small discs" are Cheerios and
crumbs, brazilnuts and
peanuts or whatever. It even
works if the large particles are
much denser than the small
ones.
In short, your friend is right;
shaking mixtures of solids can
actually un-mix them. So next
time, shake the box a few
times, then pour carefully. You
should leave the crumbs be
hind. We find this works all
the time with our Purina Bug
Chow.
Why is fine beef aged?
• Is aging a euphemism for
letting it rot?
A. Aging is done to improve
• the flavor and texture of
the meat. According to Hal
McGee in "On Food and
Cooking," the precise mecha
nism of aging is not known,
but it is thought to be due in
part to the action of protein
degrading enzymes in the beef.
These enzymes are normally
stored in the muscle cells in
compartments called
lysozomes. When the muscle
cell dies, the lysozomes break
open and the enzymes are re
leased into the cell body. There
they cleave the muscle proteins
into strong-tasting amino
acids.
Although many foods, such
as cheeses and wine, are the
result of microbial action, aged
beef should not be. Before the
era of refrigeration, aging was
usually carried out at cool but
not cold temperatures and was
therefore accompanied by a
nice layer of rot on the meat's
surface. Today, aging may be
done at temperatures just
above freezing, which inhibits
most microbial growth.

You, too, can have your ques
tion answered by the Science
Bugs, but only if you send them
