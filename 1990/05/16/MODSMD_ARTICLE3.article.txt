# First woman selected to chair ASSU Senate
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Solina Kwan was elected the
first woman chair in the history
of the ASSU Senate last night.
The newly elected 21st senate
chose Kwan, an outgoing People's
Platform senator, over four other
candidates: David Brown, Brian
Fagel, Kevin Lewis and Tim
Marklein.
In an unusual action, the senate
opened its selection proceedings
to non-senators. During debate on
the merits of each candidate,
senators largely agreed the senate
chair should be "non-partisan,"
but they disagreed on who would
be the least partisan of the five
candidates.
Kwan defeated Fagel in a 13-7
ballot vote. No other candidates
received votes.
Kwan said she was excited by
the opportunity to be chair of the
senate and promised to dedicate
her efforts to "make the senate

work together."
She added she thinks it is
"extremely important ... to con
tinue the outreach that has been
done in dorm democracy."
"One of my goals will be
to establish a regular [ASSU]
newspaper" which will be distrib
uted by dorm representatives and
senators to students, she said.
Opinion from other candidates
concerning Kwan's role in next
year's senate was mixed.
Fagel, an independent candi
date, said "the senate is going to
lose credibility because of voting
such a partisan person into the
senate chair."
He added the senate is "com
mitting suicide by letting her
win."
Brown, a People's Platform
member, said the senate made "a
good choice and a fair choice."
"I think [Kwan] has the expe
rience to help facilitate the senate
next year," he added.
