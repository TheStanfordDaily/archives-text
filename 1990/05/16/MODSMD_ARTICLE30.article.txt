# Patients get a new leech on life

### Elizabeth Palmberg 
When Dr. Vincent Hentz reat
taches a severed fingertip, he
depends on microsurgery and
leeches.
Medicinal leeches have been in
use for at least 2,500 years —
over two millennia before the in
vention of modern microscopes.
Historically, leeches were used
on people with mental illness,

tumors, skin
disease and a
variety of
other condi
tions. Clini
cal leech use
reached its
heyday in
the 1830s,
but virtually
disappeared
by the 19205.

But Hentz, associate professor
of surgery at the Medical Center,
uses the invertebrates today — to
remove blood from areas where
it has built up. When a small,
accidentally severed extremity,
such as a fingertip or an ear, is
sewn back on to the body, sur
geons are able to repair the ar
teries that bring blood into a
damaged area. However, Hentz
notes, "the veins, being very much
smaller than the arteries, are just
technically very difficult to reat
tach."
Without the veins to return the
blood to the heart, the hapless
fingertip would become so con
gested with old blood that new
blood would not be able to get in.
Deprived of oxygen, the fingertip
would die.
Leeches can prove to be the
salvation of reattached tissue.
Once he explains the leeches' ef

fectiveness, Hentz has never had
a patient refuse them. Hentz says
the usual attitude is, "I don't care,
do what you have to."
He notes that one effective his
torical use of leeches was to
relieve tissues whose veins were
inadequate.
An average leech removes about
two to four cubic centimeters of

blood. Excess blood continues to
drain from the extremity for some
time after the sated leech drops
off.
This bonus drainage occurs be
cause leeches inject their prey
with a potent anti-coagulant, a
substance that prevents blood
from clotting. Hentz estimates
that leeches' anti-coagulant,
hirudin, is about a million times
as strong as those currently ad
ministered by humans.
"When it stops dripping blood
and the part begins to look a little
congested again," Hentz explains,
"you put on another leech. We
use about two a day." Within four
to seven days, the veins grow back
sufficiently so the leeches are no
longer needed.
Before the leech made its clini
cal comeback, reconstructive and
cosmetic surgeons relieved blood
congestion by creating a wound.

For example, when reattaching
fingers, they sometimes removed
a fingernail and rubbed it to in
duce bleeding. Such methods of
bloodletting were not painful as
a reattached part has no feeling
until nerves grow back.
However, in order to facilitate
sufficient blood loss, doctors had
to inject patients with intravenous
anticoagulants. This made the

F
patients' entire bodies more likely
to bleed. A patient might lose up
to four or five pints of blood and
require multiple transfusions.
The leech's localized action

reduces the problem of excess
bleeding. With them, Hentz
estimates, the success rate
has risen from two out of 10
to seven out of 10 reattache
ments.
Surgeons get leeches from
the Medical Center pharmacy.
Fred Nishioka, investiga
tional drug pharmacist, ex
plains that the pharmacy
agreed to keep some leeches
on hand even though the in
vertebrates are technically
not its responsibility.
"I don't consider leeches a
medicinal agent," he said.
"There aren't too many drugs
that crawl around."

However, he explained that the
pharmacy department has the fa

cilities to maintain leeches "on an
on-call basis."
Leeches U.S.A. Ltd. ships the
leeches to the Medical Center via
overnight air delivery. The crea
tures are not returnable. Depend
ing on the quantity ordered, each
leech costs the Medical Center
from $4.75 to $6, plus shipping
charges.
Once the leeches arrive, they
are kept in a refrigerator, where
they will survive, dormant, for

some months. They are treated
with caution. "I'm unaware of any
leeches having attached to any

workers at the Pharmacy De
partment," notes Nishioka.
While leech maintenance is
not exactly a desirable task,
pharmacy workers can over
come initial squeamishness.
"Some of the technicians call
them their pets," he points
out.
Leeches are not an un
mixed medical blessing. As
literature sent out by Leeches
U.S.A. warns, "The leech gut
contains an endosymbiotic
bacterium, aeomonas
hydrophila." The bacterium
performs functions in the gut
that make it "essential for
the leech to grow."
