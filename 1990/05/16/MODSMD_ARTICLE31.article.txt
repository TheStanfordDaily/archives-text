# Tay-Sachs carriers can be identified now
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
Tay-Sachs is a fatal genetic dis
ease which strikes infants born to
mostly unsuspecting parents, be
cause many parents are unaware
that they are carriers of the dis
ease.
Anybody can be a carrier of Tay-
Sachs disease, but people of
Jewish origin are at particular
risk. One in every 200 people in
the general population, and one
in every 30 individuals in the
Jewish population, carry the
(unexpressed) gene for the dis
ease; yet few people are familiar
with it, and even fewer have ac
tually been tested to see if they
are carriers.

The Northern California Ta>-
Sachs Prevention Program will
provide carrier detection testing
for Tay-Sachs disease on campus
today and tomorrow. The tests
are free and take only five
minutes.
Tay-Sachs is a brutal disease

Tay-Sachs causes
the sudden and
rapid destruction
of the child's ner
vous system.

which has its onset in infancy and
causes the sudden and rapid
destruction of the child's nervous
system.
A child with Tay-Sachs seems
normal until about six months;
however, soon the child begins to
lose all motor skills. The child

ceases to crawl or turn over, loses
sight and even loses the ability to
eat and smile. By the age of five,
the child inevitably dies.
In their short lifetimes, children
with Tay-Sachs require constant
medical care in order to stay alive.
They must be monitored and fed
and are particularly susceptible to
diseases such as pneumonia.
This heart-wrenching disease
often causes financial as well as
emotional strain for parents of an
afflicted child; hospital care for
such children generally costs be
tween $7,000 and $9,000 per year.
Understanding of Tay-Sachs
has only recently been made pos

sible by medical discoveries. How
ever, there is no known cure, only
prevention.
When two carriers of the disease
have children, there is a one in
four chance for each child of
having Tay-Sachs. There is also
a 50 percent chance for each child
of being a carrier.
If two individuals who know
they are carriers decide to raise
a family, they can plan in advance
to avoid having a child with Tay-
Sachs.
The couple may opt for artificial
insemination (by a non-carrier
male donor), they may adopt a
child or they may have each preg
nancy tested for Tay-Sachs by am

niocentesis.
If the results of amniocentesis
indicate the incidence of Tay-
Sachs, the couple may choose to
terminate the pregnancy.
Testing for the Tay-Sachs gene
will be provided free of charge
today from 11 a.m.-2 p.m. in Oak
Lounge West at Tresidder Union
and from 5:30-7:30 p.m. at the
Business School, room 54. Tomor
row, testing will be made available
from 8-10 a.m. at the Medical Cen
ter in MlO6 (the student lounge)
and from 11 a.m.-noon in Tres
idder's Oak Lounge West.
The testing is being sponsored
by Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity,
the Hillel Foundation, Stanford
Genetic Counseling, the Depart
ment of Obstetrics/Gynecology
and the Cowell Health Promotion
Program.
