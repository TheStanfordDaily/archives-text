# Lithuanian Green party inspired independence movement

Serious environmental threats
are a significant impetus for po
litical activism in Lithuania and
other parts of the Soviet Union,
according to a delegation of Lith
uanian Green Party members who
visited campus last week.
"Ecological problems were like
a gate for starting the democracy
movement," said Saulius Lapienis,
a mathematician who is a member
of both the coordinating council
and the parliament of the Lithu
anian Green Party.
When Lapienis and other scien
tists founded the ecological club
Zemyna in 1988, they were not
thinking in terms of independence
from the Soviet Union. The
paramount issue was the Ignalina
nuclear power station in north
eastern Lithuania, which has two
large reactors of the same type
as those at Chernobyl.

Ignalina, built on a tectonic
fracture point in 1973 with no
earthquake protection, had al
ready experienced outbreaks of
fire when the government an
nounced plans to build a third
reactor. Zemyna held public meet
ings, prepared a digest on the
geological and physical dangers of
the plant and sent a petition with
44,000 signatures to Moscow. The
petition was ignored.
Zemyna then organized an un
official public referendum against
the plant and circulated another
petition calling for the plant to
be closed until it could be in
spected by the International
Atomic Energy Agency. In only

two months, 700,000 people out
of a Lithuanian population of 3.7
million signed the petition.
The Zemyna Greens and the
larger Lithuanian Reform Move
ment Sajudis gathered 30,000
people to form a human chain
around the plant in October, 1988.
Ignalina was shut down as a
result. As the party members' in
terpreter pointed out, in a country
where supplies are so scarce that
people often substitute newspaper
for toilet paper, the Ignalina
movement was an inspiring feat
of organization.
On October 15, 1988, represen
tatives from environmental
groups all over Lithuania held the
first conference of Lithuanian
Greens. Activists in the Green
Movement are closely tied to
nationalist causes of sovereignty
â€” they have worked on cam
paigns which reinstated the old
national flag and made Lithua
nian the official state language.

Lapienis said he thinks that en
vironmentalism was the "most
important root" in the drive for
independence. Environmental
causes were an opportunity to
gain experience and confidence in
organizing the people against the
government.
Lapienis, Arturas Abromavicius
and Eugenijus Bistrickas are part
of a larger delegation of Lithua
nian Greens spending four weeks
in the United States, primarily in
northern California. The goal of
the trip is to show the Lit
huanians economic, political and
social methods of dealing with en
vironmental problems in the
United States and how U.S. meth
ods can benefit Lithuania. The
trip is sponsored by the Center
for U.S.-U.S.S.R. Initiatives in
San Francisco and Beyond War,
a non-profit foundation focused
on conflict resolution.
The delegation made a special
visit to the Hoover Archives,

where they were among the first
Lithuanians to view rare histori
cal documents including photo
graphs of Hitler and Stalin
signing the non-aggression pact
which resulted in the Baltic
states' incorporation into the So
viet Union. Two meetings, one
with faculty and staff and the
other with Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford, were
held to discuss issues of mutual
concern.
Lithuania has numerous envi
ronmental problems aside from
nuclear power plants, ranging
from soil pollution from fertilizers
and pesticides to air pollution
caused by petroleum processing
factories and water pollution from
leaking oil storage tanks.
Although the Soviet Union es
tablished a Committee for the
Protection of Nature,
Abromavicius, a hydrogeologist
and member of the Coordinating
Council of Lithuanian Greens,

believes the committee is "only a
name." The Soviet Union has
more environmental regulations
than almost any nation in the
world, but enforcement is difficult
because the government is in the
position of policing its own indus
tries.
Now that it has declared its
independence, Lithuania has the
opportunity to try to improve the
situation. A commission com
prised of Greens in the Lithuanian
Parliament is working on a set of
new laws which will set new prece
dents in the way the government
treats the environment.
The laws propose economic
measures including taxes on the
use of natural resources, fines for
polluters, rewards for plants with
a good ecological protection record
and higher prices for superior
produce. Abromavicius admits
that the laws need refining, but
he hopes they will be accepted
