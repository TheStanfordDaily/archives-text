Repellents recalled
With the possible exception of
the übiquitous campus caterpil
lars, insects are not a imyor
nuisance in this part of Califor
nia.
However, those who plan to
head east this summer, or into
the mountains or anyplace
where insects abound and insect
bites are a problem, should be
aware that several popular
brands of insect repellant have
recently been pulled from the
market.
Two hundred brands of insect

repellent, including the popular
Off and Cutter's, were recalled
a few weeks ago.
An ingredient, R-11, is added
to these products in order to
repel flies that bite.
Although the test results for
R-l 1 are preliminary, it has been
shown to cause "adverse repro
ductive effects, (including)
ovarian atrophy and on
cogenecity, or tumors," in labo
ratory rats and mice.
If you're unsure of what to
substitute for these products,
take a cue from many natives
of the Adirondack Mountains in

New York where insects are a
considerable nuisance in the
summer months.
Many of these individuals
have discovered another
household product which they
claim works better than those
designed for the purpose. The
product is Avon "Skin-so-soft"
bath oil. Although it isn't ad
vertised for its bug repelling
qualities, the oil is an excellent
and possibly preferable alterna
tive, as it is all-natural, non
aerosol and pleasant smelling in
addition to being effective.
