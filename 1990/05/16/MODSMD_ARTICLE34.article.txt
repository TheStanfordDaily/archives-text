## Graham, Birch to square-off in NCAA semis 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - At the
moment of defeat, all Lisa Green
could feel was disappointment.
Florida's Nicole Arendt had just
closed out a 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 victory
over Green in the NCAA individ
ual singles quarterfinals ending
the college career of Stanford's
senior captain.
Arendt abruptly halted Green's
charge to a remarkable fourth
straight appearance in the semi
finals. Even though she was
knocked out of the draw, the loss
could not erase any of her ac
complishments over the past four
years.
Green will be the fifth Stanford
women'B tennis player to graduate
as a four-time All-American,
joining an elite group comprised
of Patty Fendick, Linda Gates,
Elis Burgin and Diane Morrison.
She was a key contributor to
the last four national champion
ship teams and yesterday's loss in
the round of eight was her earliest
exit from the tournament.
Teammates Debbie Graham
and Sandra Birch both reached
the semifinals and advanced to
the quarters in doubles. Teri
Whitlinger suffered a defeat in
the third round of singles but she
and Meredith McGrath also ad
vanced in the doubles.
Green's run over the past two
days took tournament observers
by surprise. She was ranked just
75th in the country after a year
in which she struggled in tourna
ments and had trouble picking up
points on the computer playing
No. 5 singles for Stanford.
Though she did not talk about

it much, an injured knee affected
her play through much of the
year. Entering NCAAs she was
healthy, however, and spoke of
how she plays better when she
gets to play a lot of matches in a
short time period.
Yesterday morning she ad
vanced to the quarters with a 6-4,
7-5 defeat of Texas' Carla Cossa.
A day earlier, Cossa had trounced
No. 4 seed Trisha Laux of USC.
Arendt got by Mary Beth Young
of USC and had been playing the
best tennis of her career. Green
came out strong and took the first
set as Arendt struggled a bit with
her serve and volley game.
In the second set, the match
seemed to turn as Green's serve
became shaky while Arendt's got
stronger. "She missed a lot of first
serves in the first set," Green said.
"Then she started making a lot
more."
As a result, Arendt could follow
her serve in and win points
quickly at the net. Green was not
getting her first serve in, though
at first it was not hurting her
much.
Arendt kept stepping up to
pound Green's second serve and
found herself making errors in
stead of hitting winners. "I never
played against someone who has
a serve like that," Arendt said of
Green's short, flat shots. "It took
me a while to get used to it."
When she did, Green was in
trouble. Arendt captured the sec
ond set and began to give Green
problems early in the third. Serv
ing at 0-1, Green went to deuce
10 times before winning the game.
Serving at 2-3, however, Green
was broken. She broke back im
mediately, but Arendt continued

the break trend to go up 5-3. In
the nert game, Arendt fell behind
0-30, then won four straight
points and the match.
"I got a little tired," Green said
of the titanic three-plus hour
struggle. "I lost a little energy."
Graham, on the other hand, had
enough in reserve to win a second
set tiebreaker 11-9 over Pepper
dine's Ginger Helgeson to earn a
semifinal berth. She had won the
first set 6-0.
Earlier, Graham handled Stacey
SchefTlin of Georgia easily 6-4, 6-
0. She is the only semifinalist who
has not dropped a set along the
way.
Graham's quarterfinal victory
got a measure of revenge for the
Cardinal as it was Helgeson who
knocked out Teri Whitlinger. The
Gdina, Minn, native had never
beaten Whitlinger, who hails from
Neenah, Wis. before the 6-3, 6-3
victory yesterday morning.
Birch, the defending NCAA
champion, survived her second
meeting of the week with Texas'
Susan Glichrist in her morning
match. Unlike Birch's rout in the
team competition, this one was a
see-saw battle that Birch eventu
ally captured 6-0, 3-6, 6-4.
She then faced California's
Jean-Marie Lozano in the quar
ters and took her out easily 6-2,
6-2. Birch caught a break when
Lozano burned Florida's Andrea
Farley in the round of 16. Not
only had Farley beaten Birch Sun
day, she was the hottest player in
the country.
Birch now meets Graham for
the third time in their college
careers, with the winner advanc
ing to Thursday night's final. "It's
a shame we have to meet," Birch

said.
"I'd rather we play in the
finals," Graham said.
Last season, Birch defeated
Graham in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence tournament final. This
season, Graham won the Pac-10
title knocking out Birch in the
semis.
Asked about that win, Graham
said, "It definitely gives me con
fidence. It was the first time I'd
ever beaten her."

"I'd like to avenge my loss (at
Pac-10s)," Birch said. She added
she could not get caught up in
playing her close friend, who is
also her teammate and doubles
partner. In addition, the two are
rooming together this week in
Gainesville. They did not at Pac
10s.
If the two can put the singles
match behind them on the dou
bles caught, they could do quite
well. For the second day in a row,

the pair romped in doubles.
Beth Choate and Danielle Scott
of Arizona did break Graham's
serve, the first time that had hap
pened in NCAA doubles this year,
but did little else in a 6-1, 6-2 rout.
Birch and Graham next meet
Arendt and Jillian Alexander who
advanced when Mamie Ceniza and
Stella Sampras of UCLA
defaulted.

Sophomore Debbie Graham earned a NCAA semifinal singles berth — where she will face teammate
Sandra Birch — by means of straight-set victories In the round of 16 and the quarterfinals yesterday.
McGrath and Whitlinger have
a date with USC's Stephanie Lon
don and Lupita Novelo, who
knocked McGrath out of the
singles field. The Cardinal duo
hammered Debbie Goldberger and
Tracie Johnstone of UC-Santa
Barbara 6-3, 6-1.

Card notes
Birch is already pictured on the wall
of champions at the Stanford tennis
stadium. If Graham wins the singles
and McGrath-Whitlinger captures the
doubles, all four will be on the wall.
Each has earned All-America
honors in both singles and doubles
for the 1990 season. That makes
Whitlinger and Birch three-time Ail-
Americans and Graham a two-time
honoree.

at first it was not hurting her
much.
Arendt kept stepping up to
pound Green's second serve and
found herself making errors in
stead of hitting winners. "I never
played against someone who has
a serve like that," Arendt said of
Green's short, flat shots. "It took
me a while to get used to it."
When she did, Green was in
trouble. Arendt captured the sec
ond set and began to give Green
problems early in the third. Serv
ing at 0-1, Green went to deuce
10 times before winning the game.
Serving at 2-3, however, Green
was broken. She broke back im
mediately, but Arendt continued

the break trend to go up 5-3. In
the nert game, Arendt fell behind
0-30, then won four straight
points and the match.
"I got a little tired," Green said
of the titanic three-plus hour
struggle. "I lost a little energy."
Graham, on the other hand, had
enough in reserve to win a second
set tiebreaker 11-9 over Pepper
dine's Ginger Helgeson to earn a
semifinal berth. She had won the
first set 6-0.
Earlier, Graham handled Stacey
SchefTlin of Georgia easily 6-4, 6-
0. She is the only semifinalist who
has not dropped a set along the
way.
Graham's quarterfinal victory
got a measure of revenge for the
Cardinal as it was Helgeson who
knocked out Teri Whitlinger. The
Gdina, Minn, native had never
beaten Whitlinger, who hails from
Neenah, Wis. before the 6-3, 6-3
victory yesterday morning.
Birch, the defending NCAA
champion, survived her second
meeting of the week with Texas'
Susan Glichrist in her morning
match. Unlike Birch's rout in the
team competition, this one was a
see-saw battle that Birch eventu
ally captured 6-0, 3-6, 6-4.
She then faced California's
Jean-Marie Lozano in the quar
ters and took her out easily 6-2,
6-2. Birch caught a break when
Lozano burned Florida's Andrea
Farley in the round of 16. Not
only had Farley beaten Birch Sun
day, she was the hottest player in
the country.
Birch now meets Graham for
the third time in their college
careers, with the winner advanc
ing to Thursday night's final. "It's
a shame we have to meet," Birch

said.
"I'd rather we play in the
finals," Graham said.
Last season, Birch defeated
Graham in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence tournament final. This
season, Graham won the Pac-10
title knocking out Birch in the
semis.
Asked about that win, Graham
said, "It definitely gives me con
fidence. It was the first time I'd
ever beaten her."

"I'd like to avenge my loss (at
Pac-10s)," Birch said. She added
she could not get caught up in
playing her close friend, who is
also her teammate and doubles
partner. In addition, the two are
rooming together this week in
Gainesville. They did not at Pac
10s.
If the two can put the singles
match behind them on the dou
bles caught, they could do quite
well. For the second day in a row,

the pair romped in doubles.
Beth Choate and Danielle Scott
of Arizona did break Graham's
serve, the first time that had hap
pened in NCAA doubles this year,
but did little else in a 6-1, 6-2 rout.
Birch and Graham next meet
Arendt and Jillian Alexander who
advanced when Mamie Ceniza and
Stella Sampras of UCLA
defaulted.


Kai Keasey — Daily file
Sophomore Debbie Graham earned a NCAA semifinal singles berth — where she will face teammate
Sandra Birch — by means of straight-set victories In the round of 16 and the quarterfinals yesterday.
McGrath and Whitlinger have
a date with USC's Stephanie Lon
don and Lupita Novelo, who
knocked McGrath out of the
singles field. The Cardinal duo
hammered Debbie Goldberger and
Tracie Johnstone of UC-Santa
Barbara 6-3, 6-1.

Card notes
Birch is already pictured on the wall
of champions at the Stanford tennis
stadium. If Graham wins the singles
and McGrath-Whitlinger captures the
doubles, all four will be on the wall.
Each has earned All-America
honors in both singles and doubles
for the 1990 season. That makes
Whitlinger and Birch three-time Ail-
Americans and Graham a two-time
honoree.
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - At the
moment of defeat, all Lisa Green
could feel was disappointment.
Florida's Nicole Arendt had just
closed out a 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 victory
over Green in the NCAA individ
ual singles quarterfinals ending
the college career of Stanford's
senior captain.
Arendt abruptly halted Green's
charge to a remarkable fourth
straight appearance in the semi
finals. Even though she was
knocked out of the draw, the loss
could not erase any of her ac
complishments over the past four
years.
Green will be the fifth Stanford
women'B tennis player to graduate
as a four-time All-American,
joining an elite group comprised
of Patty Fendick, Linda Gates,
Elis Burgin and Diane Morrison.
She was a key contributor to
the last four national champion
ship teams and yesterday's loss in
the round of eight was her earliest
exit from the tournament.
Teammates Debbie Graham
and Sandra Birch both reached
the semifinals and advanced to
the quarters in doubles. Teri
Whitlinger suffered a defeat in
the third round of singles but she
and Meredith McGrath also ad
vanced in the doubles.
Green's run over the past two
days took tournament observers
by surprise. She was ranked just
75th in the country after a year
in which she struggled in tourna
ments and had trouble picking up
points on the computer playing
No. 5 singles for Stanford.
Though she did not talk about

it much, an injured knee affected
her play through much of the
year. Entering NCAAs she was
healthy, however, and spoke of
how she plays better when she
gets to play a lot of matches in a
short time period.
Yesterday morning she ad
vanced to the quarters with a 6-4,
7-5 defeat of Texas' Carla Cossa.
A day earlier, Cossa had trounced
No. 4 seed Trisha Laux of USC.
Arendt got by Mary Beth Young
of USC and had been playing the
best tennis of her career. Green
came out strong and took the first
set as Arendt struggled a bit with
her serve and volley game.
In the second set, the match
seemed to turn as Green's serve
became shaky while Arendt's got
stronger. "She missed a lot of first
serves in the first set," Green said.
"Then she started making a lot
more."
As a result, Arendt could follow
her serve in and win points
quickly at the net. Green was not
getting her first serve in, though
at first it was not hurting her
much.
Arendt kept stepping up to
