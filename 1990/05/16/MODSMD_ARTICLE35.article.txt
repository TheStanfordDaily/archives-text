# McGrath has legit reasons for NCAA loss... and turning pro
## 
### 
Gainesville, Fla.
The vicissitudes of the NCAA in
dvidual singles tournament
claimed their fair share of victims
once again this year, most notable Stan
ford freshman Meredith McGrath.
If the tournament were played a hun
dred times, McGrath would win several
dozen times while her conqueror, Lupita
Novelo, would most likely never take the
title.
All that means little to McGrath right
now. Her chance to make college tennis
history by winning the team, singles and
doubles titles in the same year has gone
by the wayside.
The feat has not been achieved in the
nine-year history of NCAA women's ten
nis largely because they are so many
matches to be played in so little time.
The top players nearly always play for
the top teams. Therefore, they play dual
matches on four consecutive days before
the singles and doubles tournaments even
get underway. Players on championship
teams have an additional handicap.
They celebrate their NCAA crown Sun
day night then have to put that all aside

Monday morning to start a new tourna
ment. McGrath was bouncing off the
walls late on Sunday. While she may have
been physically ready to go the next day,
emotionally she was clearly drained.
Novelo, on the other hand, was fully
charged. A senior closing out her career,
she had nothing to lose playing the No.
1-ranked player in the country. She used
that energy to pull ahead of McGrath
early. Then Novelo's confidence snow
balled.
While McGrath's will to win may never
have waned, her ability to muster a come
back was clearly limited by mental
fatigue.
There is no doubt the fact she is a

freshman contributed as well. While
Sandra Birch and Debbie Graham, both
of whom reached the semifinals, have
won an NCAA team championship before,
McGrath had never had the experience.
She and Heather Willens, the two first
time winners among the starters, were
the most overtly emotional Sunday after
the finals. If McGrath had won instead
of lost, all that would be discounted. But
in determining why the improbable be
comes the actual, there is a lot to be said
for the validity of the argument.
All week, McGrath has been asked
if she is turning professional after
this season and all week she has
said her mind is not made up. Sometime
soon, though, she will probably announce
that she is leaving school.
There are so many reasons she should
stay, it is odd I feel she is ready to go.
At the bottom of her game, McGrath can
be beaten by second-tier collegians like
Jean-Marie Lozano of California and
Novelo.
At the top of her game, she has beaten
Jana Novotna, the world's No. 11 player.

McGrath has turned down more prize
money than any amateur — well over
$50,000.
McGrath already is a world-class dou
bles player. She has already played with
the brightest young star on the tour,
Jennifer Capriati, and will do so a great
deal more in the future. Unlike most of
the top players in pro tennis, McGrath
genuinely loves doubles.
She and Capriati could mature together
well and make additional money playing
doubles. Former Stanford star Patty Fen
dick has augmented her income a great
deal doing just that.
Projecting McGrath's singles ranking
a year from would be hit or miss at best,
but do not be surprised if she cracks the
top 50 before Easter Sunday, 1991. Her
serve-and-volley game is devastating
when it's on and her groundstrokes much
improved from when she arrived at Stan
ford.
The only clear reason McGrath should
stay in school is the "What if she gets
hurt?" argument. There's no denying that
the risk of permanent, physically limiting
injury is out there. But that risk has to

be balanced against the earning potential
she forgoes by remaining in school.
If the average Stanford student were
offered the opportunity to make over a
quarter of a million dollars in the next
three years, would he or she stay? Some
would, but how many?
What if the student was told it might
be a half million? Are you packing yet?
Florida has hosted the NCAA Cham
pionships for two straight years
and has done a top-notch job put
ting on the show. In '91 and '92, the
event will be held at Stanford. The folks
in athletics have their work cut out for
them to match the high standards set
here . ..
Of course, they already have a head
start: They can guarantee better weather
than Gainesville has provided over the
past week. Imagine playing four singles
matches and two doubles matchces over
two days in 90-degree heat and high
humidity.
Having trouble picturing it? Bring your
VCR and Jane Fonda tape into the sauna
and do aerobics for a few hours.

genuinely loves doubles.
She and Capriati could mature together
well and make additional money playing
doubles. Former Stanford star Patty Fen
dick has augmented her income a great
deal doing just that.
Projecting McGrath's singles ranking
a year from would be hit or miss at best,
but do not be surprised if she cracks the
top 50 before Easter Sunday, 1991. Her
serve-and-volley game is devastating
when it's on and her groundstrokes much
improved from when she arrived at Stan
ford.
The only clear reason McGrath should
stay in school is the "What if she gets
hurt?" argument. There's no denying that
the risk of permanent, physically limiting
injury is out there. But that risk has to

be balanced against the earning potential
she forgoes by remaining in school.
If the average Stanford student were
offered the opportunity to make over a
quarter of a million dollars in the next
three years, would he or she stay? Some
would, but how many?
What if the student was told it might
be a half million? Are you packing yet?
Florida has hosted the NCAA Cham
pionships for two straight years
and has done a top-notch job put
ting on the show. In '91 and '92, the
event will be held at Stanford. The folks
in athletics have their work cut out for
them to match the high standards set
here . ..
Of course, they already have a head
start: They can guarantee better weather
than Gainesville has provided over the
past week. Imagine playing four singles
matches and two doubles matchces over
two days in 90-degree heat and high
humidity.
Having trouble picturing it? Bring your
VCR and Jane Fonda tape into the sauna
and do aerobics for a few hours.
