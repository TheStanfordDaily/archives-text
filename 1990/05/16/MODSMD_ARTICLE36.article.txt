# Cardinal golfer's aim becomes pro potential

Mark Funseth's dad would have
been pleased.
Rod Funseth — a tournament
winning pro golfer — always
wanted his son to play collegiate

golf.
Mark, however, had different
plans.
Junior golf became a chore. So
many other activities looked in
viting. He came that close to just
giving up competitive play altoget
her. "All my friends would be off

doing things and I was always in
tournaments. When I was 16 my
dad got on me to keep it up, but
I was really burning out." But
then his father was stricken with
terminal cancer. And while Rod
never felt sorry for himself and
competed as long as possible,

Mark resolved to win a golf schol
arship for his dad.
The summer before his senior
year of high school Mark dedi
cated himself to golf — and to
his father's dream. Rocketing
through the junior rankings, he
quickly became nationally
renowned in junior circles. His
father didn't live to see it, but
Mark was offered a dozen schol
arships.
"My dad really wanted his kids
to go to college since he only went
to one year [of college] and
thought golf would be a great way
for me to go to school. I wasn't
even going to play my junior year
(of high school), but I really
wanted to fulfill my dad's wish
after he died."
Funscth almost wasn't a Car
dinal, however. He narrowed his
decision to four schools — Stan
ford, Southern California, Univer
sity of the Pacific, and Northwest
em — but USC's strong golf pro
gram looked awfully inviting.
Northwestern was eliminated
when the then-Northwe9t
ern/current Stanford Coach Wally
Goodwin brought him on a
recruitng trip in January. The
California native didn't think too
highly of the temperture, or the
curtailed golf season.
The opportunity to play right
away and the proximity to his
home in Napa, Calif, were just
too much to pass by.
"I didn't know anyone at Stan
ford but my parents always
wanted me to go, and I really
liked the campus," Funseth said
of his decision. "The golf program
wasn't great when I came here
but I felt I could play right away
and get experience, and if I had
gone to USC I would have had to
wait till sophomore year.
Neither the Cardinal nor Fun

seth is second-guessing his deci
sion.
Other than a rocky freshman
fall — he didn't make the travel
ing squad after having a little too
much fun in non-golf related ac
tivites — the senior has been one
of the dominating figures of Car
dinal golf for the past four years.
He didn't just qualify for the trav
eling team — he earned the No.
1 seed. And stayed on top for two
years. His game blossomed.
"The level of play among the
team wasn't that great at first,
but I did get to play with the best
collegiate golfers since I was the
top seed," Funseth said.
The economics major was the
team's low scorer his sophomore
season. He won a tournament —
the U.C. Davis Invitational — the
same year. Golf was finally fun. '
"When I didn't make any trips
I felt burned out — like I was
playing for nothing — but as soon
as I got in the lineup I had a
great time.
Funseth wasn't the only one
doing well. The team as a whole
took its game up a notch. Stanford
was once again regarded as a force
in collegiate golf. Top recruits
started giving the school a second
thought. Christian Cavaer ar
rived.
The European Juniors cham
pion boosted the program, and
booted Funseth from his perch
atop the team. But while no
longer playing No. 1, Funseth is
still excited about the progress of
the squad. "The level of play has
really gone up the past two years.
Starting last season we've really
tried to get an effort together to
play as a team."
The effort has obviously paid
off, both both for Funseth and
the program. Funseth won the

schools' host tournament, the
Stanford Invitational, last month,
leading the Cardinal to its fourth
victory of the year. NCAA
Regionals, and if all goes right,
the NCAA Tournament, loom in
the distant future.
But that's it for collegiate golf.

Come June Funseth's Cardinal
golfing days will be over.
His golf career, however, may
not be. Following in his father's
footsteps is now, ironically, a
career option.
Funseth is still not totally con
fident of his game. "I'm too
streaky. Sometimes I play really
well but sometimes I'm really
bad," he explains, but he's going
to take a swing at the Golden
State Tour this summer — pos

sibly as an amateur. After his final
quarter next fall he may give the
Australian Tour a shot as well,
depending on whether or not he
can line up a sponsor.
"He has some things to work
on still," says mentor Goodwin.
"He's a little forceful on the
course and he has to become a
better putter. But he's got a great
hold on life, which can't be sub
stituted for. If he can get a little
more handle on himself emotion

ally he can make it (on the pro
fessional tour)."
Even if professional golf does
not work out, Funseth plans on
staying in the field. "I don't have
a back up plan. Whatever I do
will probably be golf related.
Maybe I'll try for a teaching pro
position. I can't see myself work
ing 9-5."
Going for a golf scholarship
didn't turn out so badly after all.

Northwestern was eliminated
when the then-Northwe9t
ern/current Stanford Coach Wally
Goodwin brought him on a
recruitng trip in January. The
California native didn't think too
highly of the temperture, or the
curtailed golf season.
The opportunity to play right
away and the proximity to his
home in Napa, Calif, were just
too much to pass by.
"I didn't know anyone at Stan
ford but my parents always
wanted me to go, and I really
liked the campus," Funseth said
of his decision. "The golf program
wasn't great when I came here
but I felt I could play right away
and get experience, and if I had
gone to USC I would have had to
wait till sophomore year.
Neither the Cardinal nor Fun

seth is second-guessing his deci
sion.
Other than a rocky freshman
fall — he didn't make the travel
ing squad after having a little too
much fun in non-golf related ac
tivites — the senior has been one
of the dominating figures of Car
dinal golf for the past four years.
He didn't just qualify for the trav
eling team — he earned the No.
1 seed. And stayed on top for two
years. His game blossomed.
"The level of play among the
team wasn't that great at first,
but I did get to play with the best
collegiate golfers since I was the
top seed," Funseth said.
The economics major was the
team's low scorer his sophomore
season. He won a tournament —
the U.C. Davis Invitational — the
same year. Golf was finally fun. '
"When I didn't make any trips
I felt burned out — like I was
playing for nothing — but as soon
as I got in the lineup I had a
great time.
Funseth wasn't the only one
doing well. The team as a whole
took its game up a notch. Stanford
was once again regarded as a force
in collegiate golf. Top recruits
started giving the school a second
thought. Christian Cavaer ar
rived.
The European Juniors cham
pion boosted the program, and
booted Funseth from his perch
atop the team. But while no
longer playing No. 1, Funseth is
still excited about the progress of
the squad. "The level of play has
really gone up the past two years.
Starting last season we've really
tried to get an effort together to
play as a team."
The effort has obviously paid
off, both both for Funseth and
the program. Funseth won the

schools' host tournament, the
Stanford Invitational, last month,
leading the Cardinal to its fourth
victory of the year. NCAA
Regionals, and if all goes right,
the NCAA Tournament, loom in
the distant future.
But that's it for collegiate golf.

Come June Funseth's Cardinal
golfing days will be over.
His golf career, however, may
not be. Following in his father's
footsteps is now, ironically, a
career option.
Funseth is still not totally con
fident of his game. "I'm too
streaky. Sometimes I play really
well but sometimes I'm really
bad," he explains, but he's going
to take a swing at the Golden
State Tour this summer — pos

sibly as an amateur. After his final
quarter next fall he may give the
Australian Tour a shot as well,
depending on whether or not he
can line up a sponsor.
"He has some things to work
on still," says mentor Goodwin.
"He's a little forceful on the
course and he has to become a
better putter. But he's got a great
hold on life, which can't be sub
stituted for. If he can get a little
more handle on himself emotion

ally he can make it (on the pro
fessional tour)."
Even if professional golf does
not work out, Funseth plans on
staying in the field. "I don't have
a back up plan. Whatever I do
will probably be golf related.
Maybe I'll try for a teaching pro
position. I can't see myself work
ing 9-5."
Going for a golf scholarship
didn't turn out so badly after all.
Mark Funseth's dad would have
been pleased.
Rod Funseth — a tournament
winning pro golfer — always
wanted his son to play collegiate

golf.
Mark, however, had different
plans.
Junior golf became a chore. So
many other activities looked in
viting. He came that close to just
giving up competitive play altoget
her. "All my friends would be off

doing things and I was always in
tournaments. When I was 16 my
dad got on me to keep it up, but
I was really burning out." But
then his father was stricken with
terminal cancer. And while Rod
never felt sorry for himself and
competed as long as possible,

Mark resolved to win a golf schol
arship for his dad.
The summer before his senior
year of high school Mark dedi
cated himself to golf — and to
his father's dream. Rocketing
through the junior rankings, he
quickly became nationally
renowned in junior circles. His
father didn't live to see it, but
Mark was offered a dozen schol
arships.
"My dad really wanted his kids
to go to college since he only went
to one year [of college] and
thought golf would be a great way
for me to go to school. I wasn't
even going to play my junior year
(of high school), but I really
wanted to fulfill my dad's wish
after he died."
Funscth almost wasn't a Car
dinal, however. He narrowed his
decision to four schools — Stan
ford, Southern California, Univer
sity of the Pacific, and Northwest
em — but USC's strong golf pro
gram looked awfully inviting.
