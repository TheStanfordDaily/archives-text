# Rugby ends '90 season
## 
### Mark Davies Staff writer 
Stanford rugby takes to
the field today for its final
match of the 1990 season.
In an international col
legiate match, the squad
hosts the University of
Toronto at 5:00 p.m. at
Maloney field.
The Cardinal, which
finished its season with a
16-6 record after earning a
3rd place spot in the Pacific
Coast region, will face the
Blues from Toronto. The
Canadian team is currently
engaged in a 10-day tour of
northern Califonia.
Comprised of over 40
players, the Blues are
coached by Kevin Jones, who
also coaches the Ontario
Juniors and the Toronto
Barbarians. Since Jones' ad
dition to the coaching staff
four years ago, the Blues
have steadily improved,
going from 0-7 four years
ago to 3-4 this season.
The Cardinal will start a
primarily all-senior team as
this will be their last time
wearing the cardinal and
white for Stanford. "Al
though the team will be
losing many valuable
players," said coach Franck
Boivert, the "future is
promising."
The Stanford rugby pro
gram underwent a rebuild
ing phase during the 80s,
which has culminated in the
hiring of Boivert as a part
time coach last year and
then as a head coach this
season.
