# Chinese persecution fears renewed
## Secret document singles out Stanford graduate student 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
A secret document made public last
week by a defector from the Chinese
embassy in Washington, D.C. has raised
renewed concerns about persecution of
activists among Chinese students at
Stanford.
The report of the March meeting of
the Chinese State Education Commis
sion outlines a strategy of classification
and selective harassment of the 42,000
Chinese students in the United States.
Among the individuals singled out in
the report is Liu Yongchuan, a Stanford
graduate student in sociology who is
currently serving as the head of the
national Independent Federation of Chi

nese Students and Scholars.
Calling for a reconstruction of the
Chinese Communist Party in the United
States, the report divides Chinese stu
dents into those who have remained
loyal, those who can be won back, and
a core group of activists who should be
made into examples.
Although the report calls on consular
officials to avoid "pushing students
away," it is quite explicit in its intention
to isolate and punish those who were
very active â€” "category five" students
who organized demonstrations, testified
before Congress, asked for political
asylum, engaged in fund-raising activi
ties or made anti-government speeches.
Several Chinese Stanford students fall
within this category.

The report lists several measures for
consular officials to use against ac
tivists, including cutting off scholarship
money, confiscating passports, restrict
ing or prohibiting relatives' ability to
come to the United States, and elimi
nating jobs in China.
The document was made public by
Xu Lin, who had been third secretary
in the education department in the em
bassy until he defected two weeks ago.
The document is currently being circu
lated among student groups in the
United States.
At Stanford, most students are treat
ing it with a wry humor. "We joke with
each other about it," said Wang Weijia,
