# Chinese persecution fears renewed
## Secret document singles out Stanford graduate student 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
A secret document made public last
week by a defector from the Chinese
embassy in Washington, D.C. has raised
renewed concerns about persecution of
activists among Chinese students at
Stanford.
The report of the March meeting of
the Chinese State Education Commis
sion outlines a strategy of classification
and selective harassment of the 42,000
Chinese students in the United States.
Among the individuals singled out in
the report is Liu Yongchuan, a Stanford
graduate student in sociology who is
currently serving as the head of the
national Independent Federation of Chi

nese Students and Scholars.
Calling for a reconstruction of the
Chinese Communist Party in the United
States, the report divides Chinese stu
dents into those who have remained
loyal, those who can be won back, and
a core group of activists who should be
made into examples.
Although the report calls on consular
officials to avoid "pushing students
away," it is quite explicit in its intention
to isolate and punish those who were
very active â€” "category five" students
who organized demonstrations, testified
before Congress, asked for political
asylum, engaged in fund-raising activi
ties or made anti-government speeches.
Several Chinese Stanford students fall
within this category.

The report lists several measures for
consular officials to use against ac
tivists, including cutting off scholarship
money, confiscating passports, restrict
ing or prohibiting relatives' ability to
come to the United States, and elimi
nating jobs in China.
The document was made public by
Xu Lin, who had been third secretary
in the education department in the em
bassy until he defected two weeks ago.
The document is currently being circu
lated among student groups in the
United States.
At Stanford, most students are treat
ing it with a wry humor. "We joke with
each other about it," said Wang Weijia,
a graduate student in electrical
engineering. "We say, 'Oh you're
definitely classified' and 'Oh no,
I'm class two.' "
But behind the humor, the
report is seen as evidence of the
government's continuing inability
to understand its citizens abroad.
"What we are up against is a gov
ernment that still has the men
tality of the 1940s [during the
civil war] or even earlier," said
Doug Pan, another graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering.
The report consistently uses
war metaphors, calling the fight
for student allegiance as a "life
and death battle," and, at one

point, suggesting a new term be
developed to describe student ac
tivists that would have the emo
tional impact of "anti-Chinese
traitor."
"The government actually
believes that the majority of the
students overseas don't think for
themselves," Pan continued.
"They don't understand us at all.
They don't think we care for
China at all."
"I don't believe they can
develop party organizations here,"
said Xu Guanghan, a graduate
student in electrical engineering.
"But maybe it will have some ef
fects on people who aren't active
in the movement now."
Category one students, those
who are "very loyal" and intend
to return to China, can expect

preferential job assignment, ac
cording to the report. Students in
categories two through four, who
were active to different degrees
but "intend to correct their mis
takes" are to be shown leniency
in passport renewal and repay
ment for educational fees.
Preventing further brain drain
is clearly one of the motives
driving the policy of leniency
toward students who are in the
middle range. The report calls it
a "critical fight for talent."
"Overseas students are
patriotic," the report continues,
"but that does not necessarily
mean they like socialism. We
should deal with these students
correctly by giving them hope that
the country is moving in a positive
direction."

The report was approved by
Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng,
after a meeting in Beying atten
ded by public security officials,
consular representatives and offi
cials from the Foreign Ministry.
While the report says sending
students overseas is one of the
few cards China has left to play
in attempts to improve relations
with the United States, it also
calls for an end to travel permis
sion for graduate students, saying
it should be limited to "mature
and reliable" visiting scholars.
Several Chinese students report
increased activity on campus by
representatives of the Chinese
consulate in San Francisco in the
last several weeks. "The consulate
knows everything about us," said
Xu.
