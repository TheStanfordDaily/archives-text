Students still have about a week to comment
on proposed budget cuts in Student Affairs,
University officials said at an open forum last
night.
"We want to move expeditiously, but we'll
still be soliciting input for the next six or
seven days," said John Hughes, a staff member
of the University's Repositioning Steering
Committee.
Other topics discussed at the forum, atten
ded by about 20 students, included the extent
of student input already solicited and the im-

pact of cuts on Cowell Student Health Center,
student residences and ethnic centers.
Graduate student Sha Xin Wei asked how
students would be able to respond to budget
cuts that would come in September before
the start of the upcoming school year.
"I've been the first out of the gate inviting
comments from students," responded Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons. "We've literally
had hundreds of letters come back."
Council of Presidents member David Brown
praised the administration for making an ex
tra effort to solicit student opinion, but he
added, "I think the timeline ought to be

longer" for student input.
"Perhaps we can be more concrete in solici
ting student input by submitting to students
a form like this [listing recommended budget
reductions for Student Affairs] at house meet
ings," he suggested.
On other topics, Assoc. Dean for Adminis
tration Margaret Ann Fidler explained the
extent to which different sectors of Student
Affairs will be affected by the cuts.
The proposed 20 percent budget reduction
for Student Affairs was reduced to 15 percent.
In all, Student Affairs is trimming $1.5 million
from its budget.
