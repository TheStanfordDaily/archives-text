# Presentations on spring break trip to Israel provoke controversy
## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
A Stanford delegation that traveled to
Israel over spring break to study the
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip has come under fire for
its recent presentations about the trip.
The presentations have angered many
in Stanford's Jewish community, but be
cause the issue is so emotional many
have refused to talk openly about com
plaints that the programs were insensi
tive, biased or out of context.
Stanford Lutheran pastor Herbert
Schmidt, who led the trip, said it aimed
to examine, from a Palestinian perspec
tive, the intifadah, the 2-year-old Pales
tinian resistance movement. The trip,
sponsored by Ecumenical Ministries at
Stanford with support from the Council
for Higher Education on the West Bank,
was made by 18 students, faculty and
staff members.
The charges arose after members of
the delegation presented what they
learned on the trip in Mirlo House,
Alondra House, Bechtel International
Center and other locations.

Joel Shurkin, a Stanford News Service
writer who said he was speaking on his
own behalf as a Jew, pointed to one in
cident at a presentation he attended.
Shurkin said a student from the delega
tion suggested that one can understand
the oppression of Palestinians during the
intifadah by substituting the word 'Pales
tinian' for 'Jew' in titles of exhibits at
Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust
museum.
"To that student, organized mass ex
termination and violation of civil rights
were the same. It was astonishingly in
sensitive," Shurkin said.
Mohamad Ali, a sophomore who went
on the trip, said the delegation is just
pointing out a cycle of violence. "There
is fear of what happened in the Holocaust,
and this fear goes on."
Stanford News Service writer Laura
Paull, who also took the trip, said Israel
Shahak, an Israeli chemistry professor
and government opponent, told the del
egation that during the six years before
the Germans implemented the concentra
tion camps, the German policy toward
Jews was comparable to Israeli policy
toward the Palestinians today.

Despite the heated emotions, Schmidt
and representatives of Hillel, the Jewish
student organization, said they want to
move forward to provide a forum for
constructive discussion and therefore did
not wish to speak with The Daily.
Jocelyn Reisman, interim director of
Hillel, said the leadership of the Jewish
community does not want to exacerbate
the issue by publicizing it. A letter to
The Daily from a Hillel staff member
was withdrawn before publication after
the two sides met.
Schmidt and leaders of Hillel have
agreed to put out a reader including
literature from various points of view.
Schmidt said they are also going to form
a planning committee represented by
members from Hillel and the Christian
Campus Ministry to promote under
standing and dialogue.
However, Shurkin said the issue should
now be discussed openly. He said the
programs "were very insensitive to the
point where you start wondering."
Mona Mourshed, a freshman on the
delegation, said all the student delegates
agreed to the consensus reached between
Hillel and Schmidt about moving for

ward. "All I have to say is the presenta
tions were not anti-Semitic," she said.
Shurkin said he was appalled by the
delegation's overly simplistic analysis of
the problems in Israel. He said the del
egation has "deliberately excluded" the
other side of the story, making them
unqualified to discuss this "2,000-year
old debate."
Nick Haddad, a resident assistant in
Mirlo, attributed the one-sided nature of
the presentation in his dorm to the for
mat of the program. 'They said they
were going to talk about history and
background after the slide show, but the
format didn't allow them to do so."
Margaret Solomon, a freshman, said
she was upset to find Israel portrayed
in the Mirlo presentation as an im
perialist power always fighting to gain
territory. "They ignored the issue that
Israel is in a constant state of war with
people around it and the psychological
implications that has on the people."
Paull explained that the presentations
seethed one-sided because the Israeli gov
eriftent was too busy to talk to the
group. She said thousands of American
Jews are also criticizing the situation.

She added that almost all the students
who went on the trip are freshmen. "They
are very sensitive. All of them were sim
ply struck by the the policy of repression
(of the Palestinians)."
Ali said it is understandable that people
would be upset at hearing the"truth,"
and the critics may not necessarily rep
resent the general opinion.
Shurkin said there is a difference be
tween fact and truth. He said that al
though parts of the presentations
contained factual information, the pre
sentations distorted the truth because the
facts were not presented within a histor
ical context.
Shurkin suggested the formation of a
"truth squad" to attend the presenta
tions. "There were a number of students
who went with prepared questions, but
they were bluntly cut off," he said.
However, Paull said a truth squad is
an attempt to raise false issues because
people don't want to hear criticisms on
the Israeli government.
She called the term "truth squad" is
an oxymoron. "Truth is not something
that can be or should be policed."

Schmidt, who led the trip, said it aimed
to examine, from a Palestinian perspec
tive, the intifadah, the 2-year-old Pales
tinian resistance movement. The trip,
sponsored by Ecumenical Ministries at
Stanford with support from the Council
for Higher Education on the West Bank,
was made by 18 students, faculty and
staff members.
The charges arose after members of
the delegation presented what they
learned on the trip in Mirlo House,
Alondra House, Bechtel International
Center and other locations.

Joel Shurkin, a Stanford News Service
writer who said he was speaking on his
own behalf as a Jew, pointed to one in
cident at a presentation he attended.
Shurkin said a student from the delega
tion suggested that one can understand
the oppression of Palestinians during the
intifadah by substituting the word 'Pales
tinian' for 'Jew' in titles of exhibits at
Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust
museum.
"To that student, organized mass ex
termination and violation of civil rights
were the same. It was astonishingly in
sensitive," Shurkin said.
Mohamad Ali, a sophomore who went
on the trip, said the delegation is just
pointing out a cycle of violence. "There
is fear of what happened in the Holocaust,
and this fear goes on."
Stanford News Service writer Laura
Paull, who also took the trip, said Israel
Shahak, an Israeli chemistry professor
and government opponent, told the del
egation that during the six years before
the Germans implemented the concentra
tion camps, the German policy toward
Jews was comparable to Israeli policy
toward the Palestinians today.

Despite the heated emotions, Schmidt
and representatives of Hillel, the Jewish
student organization, said they want to
move forward to provide a forum for
constructive discussion and therefore did
not wish to speak with The Daily.
Jocelyn Reisman, interim director of
Hillel, said the leadership of the Jewish
community does not want to exacerbate
the issue by publicizing it. A letter to
The Daily from a Hillel staff member
was withdrawn before publication after
the two sides met.
Schmidt and leaders of Hillel have
agreed to put out a reader including
literature from various points of view.
Schmidt said they are also going to form
a planning committee represented by
members from Hillel and the Christian
Campus Ministry to promote under
standing and dialogue.
However, Shurkin said the issue should
now be discussed openly. He said the
programs "were very insensitive to the
point where you start wondering."
Mona Mourshed, a freshman on the
delegation, said all the student delegates
agreed to the consensus reached between
Hillel and Schmidt about moving for

ward. "All I have to say is the presenta
tions were not anti-Semitic," she said.
Shurkin said he was appalled by the
delegation's overly simplistic analysis of
the problems in Israel. He said the del
egation has "deliberately excluded" the
other side of the story, making them
unqualified to discuss this "2,000-year
old debate."
Nick Haddad, a resident assistant in
Mirlo, attributed the one-sided nature of
the presentation in his dorm to the for
mat of the program. 'They said they
were going to talk about history and
background after the slide show, but the
format didn't allow them to do so."
Margaret Solomon, a freshman, said
she was upset to find Israel portrayed
in the Mirlo presentation as an im
perialist power always fighting to gain
territory. "They ignored the issue that
Israel is in a constant state of war with
people around it and the psychological
implications that has on the people."
Paull explained that the presentations
seethed one-sided because the Israeli gov
eriftent was too busy to talk to the
group. She said thousands of American
Jews are also criticizing the situation.

She added that almost all the students
who went on the trip are freshmen. "They
are very sensitive. All of them were sim
ply struck by the the policy of repression
(of the Palestinians)."
Ali said it is understandable that people
would be upset at hearing the"truth,"
and the critics may not necessarily rep
resent the general opinion.
Shurkin said there is a difference be
tween fact and truth. He said that al
though parts of the presentations
contained factual information, the pre
sentations distorted the truth because the
facts were not presented within a histor
ical context.
Shurkin suggested the formation of a
"truth squad" to attend the presenta
tions. "There were a number of students
who went with prepared questions, but
they were bluntly cut off," he said.
However, Paull said a truth squad is
an attempt to raise false issues because
people don't want to hear criticisms on
the Israeli government.
She called the term "truth squad" is
an oxymoron. "Truth is not something
that can be or should be policed."
