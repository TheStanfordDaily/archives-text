# Aftershocks of '89 takeover still felt
## 
### Sue Kown 
May 15, 1989. Students occupy
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office, blocking the
entrances to Building 10 as well
as a sheriffs bus used to hold
arrested students. Protesters, in
cluding many members of the Stu
dents of Color Coalition, hold
hands and chant, calling for a
meeting with Kennedy to discuss
their "Agenda for Action." Their
demands include a tenure-track
Asian-American history professor,
the establishment of a discrimi
nation grievances board and the
hiring of a full-time Chicano com
munity dean. Fifty-five students
are arrested.
May 16, 1990. At least one and
possibly two tenure-track posi
tions have been created in Asian-
American studies, and a full-time
dean for El Centro Chicano has
been hired. Students are complet
ing their public service sentences.
The takeover is long past, but it
remains very close to many mem
bers of the Stanford community

— a community still divided over
the effectiveness of the takeover.
Protesters say progress made
on multicultural issues is a direct
result of the takeover, while many
administrators attribute these
changes to the report of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues, which was well underway at
the time of the protest.
However, some students and ad
ministrators do agree that the in
cident has led to an interesting
development: The early tensions
have led to a better relationship
with more communication, inclu
sion and sensitivity between the
two groups.
Protesters David Brown and In
grid Nava, current Council of
Presidents members, and Stacey
Leyton, a member of last year's
COP, said they believe some real
changes have resulted from the
takeover.
"From the first time we heard
that there was going to be a
tenured Asian-American studies
professor and that El Centro
would receive a full-time dean, we
knew that the ordeal was worth
it. The protest did evoke action
and opened the door for more
changes," Leyton said.
According to Nava, "There was
no way that the campaign for the
new [Chicano] dean was going to
happen before the end of the year.
The takeover made the urgency
of the issue more real."
However, not all students look
back on the takeover with such

satisfaction. According to sopho
more John Abbott, president of
the Stanford College Republicans,
"There are no positive outcomes
of the takeover.... The Univer
sity showed that if you scream
loud enough, they'll cave in to
your demands."
At the time of the takeover,
Kennedy did not immediately re
spond to the protesters' demands
to discuss their "Agenda for Ac
tion," a list of priorities for im
plementing the proposals in the
UCMI report. Kennedy was to
present his remarks on the UCMI
report to the Academic Council
later in the week.
Kennedy said he is still per

plexed as to why the students held
the takeover. He said he believed
their demands were already being
addressed by the UCMI report.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons agrees with Kennedy.
"Everything that has happened
(regarding the UCMI report) was
already being worked on at the
time of the takeover. The takeover
didn't contribute substantially to
what was already in progress."
Although the administration
and student protesters disagree on
what was accomplished as a result
of the takeover, they do agree that
relations between the two parties
have improved since the incident.
Kennedy now meets once a

quarter with the ASSU Senate as
well as with all student of color
groups to discuss campus issues
as well as specific group issues of
concern. Previously, he met yearly
with these groups.
According to Kennedy, "The in
cident didn't damage personal re
lations with the students involved.
It's important not to let personal
feelings get involved in the after
math of an incident like this."
