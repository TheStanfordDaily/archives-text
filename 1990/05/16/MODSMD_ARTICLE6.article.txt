# For many, punishment was small price to pay

### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
For sophomore Vince Ricci, one of 55 stu
dents arrested a year ago yesterday in the
takeover of University President Donald Ken
nedy's office, punishment has been less than
punishing.
Ricci and most of the other protesters were
each fined a total of 115 hours of public service
work by the University and Santa Clara
County. He is trying to finish up the approx
imately 20 hours of public service he has left.
"The work-fine was an opportunity to work
in areas that I always wanted to but probably
would not have taken time to do otherwise,"
said Ricci, who worked for the Stanford Recy
cling Center and the Hews Center for Public
Service and is currently working on a special
project for the Stanford Volunteer Network.
