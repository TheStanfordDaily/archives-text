# For many, punishment was small price to pay
## 
### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
For sophomore Vince Ricci, one of 55 stu
dents arrested a year ago yesterday in the
takeover of University President Donald Ken
nedy's office, punishment has been less than
punishing.
Ricci and most of the other protesters were
each fined a total of 115 hours of public service
work by the University and Santa Clara
County. He is trying to finish up the approx
imately 20 hours of public service he has left.
"The work-fine was an opportunity to work
in areas that I always wanted to but probably
would not have taken time to do otherwise,"
said Ricci, who worked for the Stanford Recy
cling Center and the Hews Center for Public
Service and is currently working on a special
project for the Stanford Volunteer Network.
Other students arrested in the takeover
echoed Ricci's sentiments. Stu
dents interviewed by The Daily
said the takeover was successful,
and therefore worth the price.
The protesters were charged by
Santa Clara County with trespass
ing and were fined 40 hours of
volunteer service each. All the stu
dents met the January deadline
for completing the service.
In addition, most of the stu
dents were also charged by the
University for violating the Policy
on Campus Disruption and were
fined 75 public service hours on
campus. The students have until
June 15 to complete their work.
If they do not, their registration
will be placed on hold.
According to the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs office, only 10
takeover participants have re
ported completion of their Uni
versity requirement.
Senior Nadeem Hussain is one
of the few protesters completely
finished with his work require
ment — though he was not given
a University sentence.

During the takeover, Hussain
collapsed inside Kennedy's office
and was rushed to Cowell Student
Health Center before police ar
rived on the scene. Busy organiz
ing the takeover with the ASSU
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation, Hussain said he ne
glected to eat or sleep for two
days.
Hussain was not charged by the
University due to his ambiguous
whereabouts at the time of the
arrests; county sheriffs deputies
arrested him two weeks after the
takeover.
For his county work require
ment, Hussain worked at The
Julian Street Inn, a homeless
shelter in San Jose for schizo
phrenic paranoids. He cooked,
cleaned, painted and "spent the
majority of the time talking to
the people."
According to Hussain, he
befriended one of the people at
Julian Street, who still comes to
visit him.
"My parents did things like this
in the '605," Hussain said. "I ex
pected to take over the President's
Office at least once in my college
years. It was a good learning ex
perience."

Current Senior Class Presidents
member Michael Roark has also
completed his work-fine hours.
Roark tutored at the East Palo
Alto Youth Development Center
and still does. He also aided in
earthquake relief in Watsonville
during spring break.
"A lot of things we were fight
ing for were just goals and hopes,"
said Roark, who was involved with
CODE last year. "They are now
commonly held beliefs that they
are things the University needs
to improve on to be great. The
campus is now more open and
understanding about the direction
the University needs to be going."
Roark, however, is "annoyed"
at some aspects of the University's
response to the takeover.
During University probation,
Roark said, the students were
denied access to their transcripts.
They had to petition to receive a
copy.
Graduate student Stacey
Leyton still has about 15 hours
left to complete her work-fine.
She helped coordinate the You
Can Make a Difference Confer
ence, helped paint El Centro Chi
cano and worked at Julian Street.
Leyton, a former Council of

Presidents member, worked with
CODE to devise the Agenda for
Action, a list of demands the pro
testers sought to present to Ken
nedy.
"The sit-in was not anything
anyone wanted to happen,"
Leyton said. "We certainly did not
want to put ourselves or President
Kennedy in that position, but I
have noticed a real difference
since the takeover in how serious
the administration is willing to
take the students," Leyton said.
Ricci agreed that relations be
tween the protesters and the Uni
versity have improved. "The
climate of the campus has
changed a lot," he said, adding
the takeover "made a lot of sense
in the context of last year. . . . The
tone of the University and the
frustrations of students were
precursors to the sit-in."
However, Ricci said "this year
there is a conservative backlash
that has led up to Perry Fried
man's taking over of the ASSU.
The tone this year was set by
President Kennedy's challenge at
'The Fire Within' to question stu
dent political groups, and that's
basically what people have been
doing all year," he said.

Agenda for Action Coalition members and riot police exchanged
opinions outside Building 10 a year ago yesterday. On May 15,
1989, 55 students were arrested for taking over University President
Donald Kennedy's office. Those students arrested in the takeover
have performed community service hours for both the University
and Santa Clara County.
