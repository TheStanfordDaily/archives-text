### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Nancy Ziegenmeyer, a rape sur
vivor who made national head
lines by allowing a newspaper to
publish her name and photo
graph, spoke at Annenberg Audi
torium last night.
Typically, newspapers withhold
names of women who have been
raped, in order to protect the vic
tim's privacy.
"The reason my story was so
powerful to readers was there was
a real name and a real face at
tached to it," she said. "It really
touched people."
Her decision to reveal her iden
tity has prompted overwhelmingly
positive responses. "A lot of
women who were rape victims
themselves have written to me
saying, 'Thank you for speaking
out,' " she said. "After reading my
series, a 50-year-old woman fi
nally went to a rape crisis center,
after 35 years of never telling

anyone about her rape."
Ziegenmeyer, however, does not
advocate printing rape victims'
names without their express con
sent. "To do so would only further
victimize women who most likely
have already been victimized by
a rapist, a doctor, a policeman and
the courts," she said. "Why in
God's name should we add one
more thing to the list?"

parking lot and forced her to have
intercourse with him.
The man was sentenced by an
lowa court in January of this year
to life in prison without parole
for first-degree kidnapping, and
the case is currently under appeal.
Fear of being stigmatized al
most stopped her from reporting
her rape to the police. Like many
women, she experienced guilt and
self-blame in the aftermath of her
assault. "I could not get over the
feeling that I had done something
to deserve this," she said.
While the case was in court, an
editorial in a local newspaper sug
gested that perhaps in keeping
rape victims' names confidential,

the media contribute to the
stigma attached to rape victims.
Three weeks later, she and her
husband decided to go public with
her story, in hopes of destigmatiz
ing rape.
"If we do not get rid of the
stigma, the result will be less and
less women reporting the crime
of rape," Ziegenmeyer said. Never
theless, "allowing my face and
name to be published was not an
easy decision to make."
She worked with a reporter
from the Des Moines Register un
der conditions which would
protect the identity of her three
children, whose safety had been
threatened by the rapist. She also
stipulated that the articles would
not run until after the trial.
Ziegenmeyer discussed the
media's terminology for women

who have been raped. "The man
who raped me made me a rape
victim," she said. "My friends and
support network, which helped
me in healing, made me a survi
vor."
During the talk, Ziegenmeyer
also addressed the issue of ac
quaintance rapes on college cam
puses. "The institution has a
responsibility to the victim," she
said.
This obligation includes
respecting a woman's decision of
whether or not to press charges,
providing her with complete in
formation on legal rights and the
progress of the investigation, of
fering financial assistance for
counseling or medical care and
protecting her from harassment
by the assailant or his friends,
Ziegenmeyer said.
