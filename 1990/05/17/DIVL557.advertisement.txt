Think of the six women
closest to you.
Now guess
which one will be raped
this year.
One out of six college women will be sexually assaulted this year.
But you can change the odds of it happening. Simply by trying to
avoid situations that leave you or your friends vulnerable.
For starters, follow security measures. Don't prop residence hall
doors open. Walk with a friend after dark. And be aware that date
rape is a major problem on college campuses. With many of these
rapes involving drinking.
Then share these facts with six of your friends. And maybe none
of them will become another statistic.
