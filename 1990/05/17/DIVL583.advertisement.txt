Today's laptop PC leader* brings you the
new SupersPort w SX—the first word in
price, performance and portability!
Zenith Data Systems would like to offer
you a more useful definition of portability—the
new Supers Port SX.
As the first laptop PC to feature the
number-crunching power of the Intel 386SX ,M
microprocessor, Supers Port SX gives you
processing speeds up to 33% faster than most
286 portables.
And yet, its SX architecture makes the
Supers Port SX about as affordable as a 286
laptop. So you can run high-performance 386
software for advanced financial, scientific and
engineering applications without the 386 price.
It also offers Zenith's Page White screen
with high-contrast black-on-white images that
virtually duplicate printed-page clarity. It
even runs VGA color applications with 16
corresponding shades of gray.
And Supers Port SX features Zenith's
Intelligent Power Management System ™ which
lets you control power usage.. for up to three
and-a-half hours of battery life.
So if your definition of true portability
includes 386 performance within a 286 budget,
get the first word in SX laptops. Pick up Zenith's
innovative new Supers Port SX today!
