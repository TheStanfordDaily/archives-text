# Lithuanians offer compromisory gesture

RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Lithuania's
parliament offered yesterday to
suspend laws it has enacted since
declaring the republic's independence
if the Kremlin agrees to negotiate.
The resolution adopted by the Lith
uanian Supreme Council aimed at
breaking Lithuania's impasse with
Moscow, but parliament spokeswoman
Rita Dapkus said it did not involve
rescinding the republic's March 11 dec
laration of independence as the Krem
lin has demanded.
The offer will be delivered to Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev tomorrow,
she said.
Ms. Dapkus said the proposal closely
resembled the compromise suggested
last month by French and German
leaders, but adds a transition period
before full independence and concrete
proposals on military cooperation, eco
nomic plans and other topics.
Gorbachev spokesman Arkady Mas
lennikov has said the proposal by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
French President Francois Mitterrand
went "along the lines" of Gorbachev's
thinking, but stopped short of calling
it acceptable.
Gorbachev pronounced Lithuania's
declaration of independence invalid in
March and followed up with economic
sanctions, including a partial blockade
that officials say has left the republic
of 3.8 million on the verge of running
out of fuel.
Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene said Tuesday
that she believed talks with Moscow
could begin as early as this week.
A leader of neighboring Latvia said
yesterday that talks on Baltic indepen
dence would start next week with mid
level Kremlin officials. Estonia's Pre
mier Edgar Savisaar appealed yester
day for U.S. help to smooth the way.
Latvian Deputy Prime Minister ll
mars Bisers, just back from meetings
in Moscow, said talks with Soviet of

ficials would focus on "the gaining of
independence on the basis of a treaty
with the Soviet Union."
Savisaar also appealed to U.S. Sec
retary of State James Baker 111 to
discuss the Baltic republics' drive for
independence in his meetings this week
with Soviet leaders in Moscow, the
Estonian news agency ETA said.
All three Baltic republics were re
ported to be calm yesterday, one day

after thousands of anti-independence
protesters converged on government
buildings in Riga, the capital of Latvia,
and Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.
In Moscow, Baker said he would
press Soviet leaders to explain why
they have not begun talks with Baltic
leaders.
"It's not encouraging to us to see
the absence of a dialogue between
leaders there and the Kremlin," Baker

said.
In Washington, President Bush said
the standoff between Moscow and the
Baltic republics "certainly puts some
tension" on his May 30-June 3 sum
mit.
Gorbachev has offered Latvia and
Estonia "special status" in a revamped
Soviet federation in late April. They
chose instead to pursue their drives
for gradual, but full independence.
