Bush to stand firm
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush said yesterday that he won't
yield to pressure from Democrats to
"go first" in proposing tax and spend
ing cuts needed to bring the federal
budget deficit under control.
Nor will he make a prime-time tele
vision address to the nation on
budget problems in the absence of a
deal with Congress, Bush told a news
conference.
"I don't want to inadvertently send
the wrong signals to the markets,"
Bush said, adding that he would
make such an address "at the appro
priate time."
Some congressional Democrats

criticized Bush yesterday, a day after
the first budget summit talks, for
refusing to go directly to the public
with the economic bad news that
prompted him to call a summit on
the budget deficit.
AIDS bill approved
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Sen
ate overwhelmingly approved an
AIDS spending bill yesterday worth
an estimated $2.9 billion over five
years that is aimed at helping cities
and states cope with growing num
bers of patients with the disease.
The vote was 95-4. The Senate ac
cepted amendments designed to im
prove inspection of the nation's blood

supply system and prevent local gov
ernments from using their share of
the federal money to distribute
needles to drug abusers.
Anti-smoking bill passed
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Senate
committee approved a $110-million
a-year anti-smoking bill yesterday
that would encourage states to en
force laws prohibiting the sale of
cigarettes to minors.
The bill, approved 10-4 by the
Labor and Human Resources Com
mittee, also would finance improve
ment of programs designed to educate
Americans about dangers of smoking.

Inflation held in check
WASHINGTON (AP) - Falling
costs for vegetables, fuel oil and wom
en's clothing helped hold consumer
price inflation to 0.2 percent in April,
the government said yesterday.
It was the first moderate report
after a severe cold snap sent prices
spiraling 1.1 percent in January. The
Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index had risen 0.5 percent in both
February and March.
"We're correcting from the un
usually high prices of the winter,"
said economist Donald of
Georgia State University. "... You
could argue the worst of inflation is
behind us, certainly for this year."
