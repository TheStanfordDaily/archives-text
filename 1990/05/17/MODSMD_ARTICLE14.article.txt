## Community respect 
### 
THERE'S NO place like home.
Almost.
To some people, the dor
mitory is their home, and the
dining hall is their kitchen. Treat
ing campus residences like homes
helps to build community among
students.
And just as we show respect for
the privacy of members of our
homes, we should be conscious of
the others in our residence halls.
Hiring a female stripper to per
form in a dining hall while students
are eating lunch shows a lack of
respect for residents' rights and
privacy. The students who did so
in Sterling Quad's Ricker dining
center last Tuesday were not sensi
tive to the disempowering effect
their actions would have on wom
en.
That type of "entertainment" is
disturbing and not something that
would have been enjoyable to all
those eating at Sterling Quad that

day.
Both female and male students
have the right to dine at their res
idences without being so blatantly
objectified for the sake of the
amusement of a few unthinking
individuals. The fact that residents
of Robinson House, the gender is
sues focus house, dine at Ricker
adds to the lack of sensitivity that
the students displayed when they
brought in a performance repre
senting the exploitation of women's
bodies.
The Robinson residence staff

sense of community in Sterling

When entertainment is presented
in a place where many are involun
tarily exposed to it, sensitivity
toward the community is in order.
