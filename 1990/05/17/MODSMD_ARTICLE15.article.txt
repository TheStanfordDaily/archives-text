REGISTRAR Sally Mahoney
has been appointed to fill the
recently established position
of vice president for student re
sources. Although this position has
been in the works for quite some
time, the University has neglected
to make it official until now.
The appointment of Mahoney
was an excellent choice, given her
extensive experience with the Uni
versity. Mahoney has seen Stanford
from many different perspectives;
she attended graduate school here,
served as a residential director (a
position much like the current res
ident fellow) and has worked with
the Provost's Office and its many
committees.
Despite Mahoney's personal
qualifications, judgment should be

withheld on the question of the
position's ultimate worth. The con
cept of institutionalizing a high
level position to oversee student
resources is good in theory, but
the position and its duties must
be spelled more clearly out before
its viability can be determined.
In addition, as the University
faces budget cuts across the board,
it is a hope that the addition of
this top level administrative posi
tion will be consistent with Stan
ford's goal of streamlining and
saving. Stanford will have to do a
great deal of trimming at the lower
levels to compensate for the crea
tion of this new position.
Eventually, all the pieces of this
puzzle will fall into place. Let's
hope that none is missing.
