## Limiting shock tolerance

SAY SCHOLARS"
"FLORIDA SUN MELTS TOURIST'S
NOSE"
As if written in neon, the headlines
beckon from the newsstands in aisle
three. Shopper Larry Lunchbox darts a
quick glance around him. Good. Not a
familiar face in sight. Edging in some
what ashamedly toward the newsstands,
Larry begins to pore over the tabloids
until . ..
"Hi there Larry."
Oh rats. The boss is in aisle two. Quick
eye shift to Time magazine. "Hey there,
how 'bout that Sunnunu?"
Despite being the most disparaged
"newspapers" in the country, sen
sationalist tabloids also have the largest
readerships in the United States. The
secret of yellow journalism's selling
power?
It's the reason freak shows draw
audiences. It's behind the business
acumen of the movie producer who
pushed for an R rating. It's why people
wearing neon stand out. Or the reason
raunch radio survives. The departure
from the norm, the shock value, jars our
senses to say, "Wait . . . stop . . . here's
something different."
But what happens when "shock" be
comes commonplace? For some reason,
neon doesn't look as bright in Los An
geles. And a movie scene that some would
have considered violent 20 years ago

seems tame by today's standards.
Inundated by "shock value" from every
angle, it's possible to develop a shock
tolerance; that "shock" which was in
tended to make us scream, cry or shudder
in fear merely bounces off us like rubber
bullets. Horror movies might become
more horrific, raunch radio might become
raunchier, but shock tolerance simply
goes up, impinging upon our ability to
react.
Nor is the shock tolerance limited to
the world of cinema and fiction. In a
world in which each day's newspaper
headlines recount a tragedy, tragedies be
come "commonplace."
We are told that 100 people died on
this plane yesterday and 20 people were
murdered the day before and that . . .
With each passing headline there is a
distant, scary guilt that says, "Yes, this
is horrible, but why don't I feel worse
about it?" Flip to comic page.
I remember a West German exchange
student in my high school remarking,
during a documentary on the Holocaust,
"They showed us these kinds of films
1,000 times back home. I feel horrible
saying this, but I just don't feel shocked
anymore when I see it." The ability to
react, to feel shock, seems somehow
stymied by familiarity.
Words have lost their shock value in
much the same way. As four-letter words
become standard conversation staples,
they no longer merit so much as a wince.
Rather than using a swear word to em
phasize a point, people turn to the violent

simile. After a physics midterm Monday,
I heard a girl say, "Omigod .. . that mid
term ... it was like being raped." Or
after the Draw: "Yeah, we were
castrated."
Okay, the physics midterm was hor
rible, but was it like "being raped?"
Granted, it was intended as hyperbole to
make a point, but can you really equate
rape to a physics midterm? The simile
makes people kind of stop and react at
the expense of trivializing rape and the
trauma which rape victims experience.
Loose use of words desensitizes us to the
horror of the reality.
As shock tolerance levels increase, dul
ling the senses and the ability to react,
apathy and cynicism soon follow. In an
age where "cool" is everything, and
phrases like "chill, dude" or "don't have
a cow" are vogue, mellowness sometimes
crosses over to a cold indifference.
This is not to say we should get caught
in an emotion fest, grab a box of Kleenex
and mourn every bug that was ever
squashed. Constant reaction pins us
down in a state of inertia. But so does
the inability to react.
