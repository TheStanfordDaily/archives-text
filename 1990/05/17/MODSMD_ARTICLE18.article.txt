## Community must surrender censorship for free speech 
### 
AS A RECENTLY ELECTED
member of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, I had not
felt compelled to clarify my stance on
the SCLC's new speech-limitation
proposal until I came across Faculty
Senate member Denis Phillips' devas
tatingly simple-minded defense of that
proposal in the May 14 Daily.
Particularly half-baked is Phillips'
assertion that "no one is forced to
come to Stanford" and those who don't
accept "our values" should "stay
away." This seems to have the same
logic to it as those '70s bumperstickers
that read "America: Love it or Leave
it."
Nowhere on the undergraduate
application for admission does it read

"independent thinkers need not apply."
The fact of the matter is, we are here
at Stanford and we aren't going to
leave. No one told us we lost our civil
rights when we accepted admission; we
intend to see our freedom of speech
respected.
Equally disgruntling is Phillips'
contention that we have fewer rights
at Stanford than under the U.S. Con
stitution because the Fundamental
Standard only refers to good citizens.
The flaw in this reasoning, as in the
entire speech-limitation proposal, is the
vagueness and inherent subjectivity of
its standards. Any interpretation as to
who is a "good" citizen or what is
racially "offensive" speech is likely to
be wholly dependent on who is doing

the interpreting.
At Stanford, some people consider
the term "third world" offensive. Some
take offense at criticism of the actions
of minority organizations. Others are
offended by the old Western Culture
requirement. Some are bound to be
offended by a debate on the merits of
affirmative action quotas. Any serious
debate over race-related issues has the
potential to offend someone.
And besides, why should offensive
speech only be censored if it deals with
race? If we want to make sure no one
ever feels uncomfortable, let's start by
censoring the censors themselves. For
example, Ingrid Nava, an SCLC mem
ber who supports the new proposal,
alienated and offended most of this

year's freshman class with her remarks
at Orientation. What better candidate
for censorship under offensive-speech
guidelines?
Returning to seriousness, I ask the
current SCLC to take pity on free
speech. Everyone is offended by the
expression of ideas and beliefs contra
dictory to their own. It is only by
collectively surrendering our right to
censor that we gain the right to be
heard. If free speech is impracticable
even at a place like Stanford, we might
as well declare the entire democratic
experiment a failure.
