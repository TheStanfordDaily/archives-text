# All teams should be lauded with equal attention
## 
### 
Now that the varsity women's tennis
team has won its fifth-straight na
tional title, perhaps the Department of
Athletics could sponsor a rally on their
behalf. Maybe The Daily could include
a special section illustrating their win
ning season or the the administration
could make it known when they will
be arriving at the airport so we can all
be there to greet them.
Wouldn't that be something?! But
wait a minute, I forgot that the NCAA
championships is being held at Stan
ford for the next two years. With the
way things are going, the tennis team
will probably have to win five more
titles before a commemorative plaque
is designed in their honor.
It is high time the University begins
to treat all national championship
teams alike whether or not it's the

first title or one of many. In addition,
the amount of revenue the sport brings
to the school should not be a factor.
Granted, this will certainly affect the
press in the outside world. But the
achivements of the women tennis
players are no less outstanding, and
therefore they should receive the same
honors as other NCAA championship
teams.
