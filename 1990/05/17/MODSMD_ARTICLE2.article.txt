# More admittances, fewer acceptances
## Wait-list offers made again this year 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
All around the country students
are opening envelopes this month
that they wish they had received
last month. For the second year
in a row, the Office of Undergrad
uate Admissions has admitted
students from its wait list.
The necessity to go to the wait
list comes in a year when the total
number of applications declined
by 13 percent, hitting a 10-year
low. Nonetheless, the Admissions
Office admitted 100 more stu
dents than last year, a total of
2,649.
But the Admissions Office has
a target of enrolling 1,600 fresh
men, which is up to 100 more
than have been accepted in indi
vidual years over the past 10
years.
According to John Bunnell, di
rector of freshman admissions,
1990 marks the first time in
several years that Stanford has
had to go to its wait list for two
consecutive years. Usually, Bun
nell said, the Admissions Office
has seen a pattern of going to the
wait list every second year.
While Bunnell called the need
to admit wait-listed students "a
concern," he emphasized that it
is not a cause for alarm. He said

that a cursory
check of response
cards showed
that Stanford still
encounters its
greatest cros
sover with the
same four top
Eastern schools it
has in the past:
Harvard, Yale,

Princeton and MIT.
According to admissions offi
cials at those schools, MIT has
also gone to the wait list this year,
while Harvard, Yale and Prince
ton have not.
He said there are fewer high
school graduates this year, which
meahs a decline in applications
and a "more competitive" situa
tion for the top schools.
He also emphasized that mea
suring the percentage of students
who accept the offer of admission
is not the best way of determining
the quality of the freshman class.
"This yield business is misleading.
We could have a 100 percent yield
â€” we would just admit all those
students who say Stanford is their
first choice. That's not what we
do."
Going to the wait list can even
be a "pleasant experience," Bun
nell said. "We've been able to ad
mit some awfully good students
we'd like to have here."
