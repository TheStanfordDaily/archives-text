# Correct advice on sunglasses crucial to eyes
## 
### 
In the May 9 Daily, the Science Bugs
gave some advice about sunglasses that
might be misinterpreted. The Bugs are
correct that cost has little to do with
sunglass quality, but the implication
that all sunglasses are alike and
equally effective is unfortunate.
The relatively short-wave UV-B radi

ation, which most sunglasses block, is
only a small portion of the UV light
which can reach the interior of the
eye. Longer UV radiations (UV-A, 320-
400 nanometers) and some deep-blue
light (400-500 nanometers) are also a
concern with respect to aging changes
within the eye. To protect the retina,
and gain the maximal subjective effects
from reduced glare, sunglasses must
block UV-A and some of the blue.
Sunglass labeling is presently a dis
aster. Some manufacturers describe
"general purpose" and "special pur
pose" sunglassses, but these categories
are rather broad and do not tell you
precisely how much protection you get
in each category of radiation.
Look for a product which tells you
the actual wavelengths that are cov
ered, or that specifies protection in the
blue and UV-A regions as well as the
UV-B. If you feel politically inclined,
write to the Food and Drug Adminis
tration saying that the public has a
right to know what it is buying.
