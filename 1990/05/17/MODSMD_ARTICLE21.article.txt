# Hoover director has much to offer to scholarship
## 
### 
I was very pleased to read in the
May 15 Daily that John Raisian has
been appointed director of the Hoover
Institution.
Raisian was my deputy director, and
he is a man of integrity and talent. I
am confident he will continue to ad
vance the scholarly activities of the
Hoover Institution and protect the
academic freedom of its scholars and
the independent status of the Hoover
Institution, just as I did for over 29
years.
As for any improvement in Hoover-
Stanford relations, that depends on
University President Donald Kennedy.
Given his behavior for the past several
years, I am not too optimistic. How
ever, I would like to be proven wrong.
Glenn Campbell
Counselor, Hoover Institution
