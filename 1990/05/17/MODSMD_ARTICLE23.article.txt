## Republicans owe apology to all who have suffered from AIDS 
### 
STANFORD COLLEGE Republi
cans president John Abbott's
actions and his May 16 letter are
as offensive to me as the worst of the
hate-mongering contained in "AIDS:
What You Haven't Been Told," the
so-called "documentary" presented to
the Stanford community by the College
Republicans on May 10.
He is as in the dark as he claims to
be because his cowardice, irrespon
sibility or (at the most generous) ex
treme nearsightedness led him to
schedule an appointment for the time
immediately after the showing of what
he must have known would be a con
troversial film requiring discussion.
I am outraged that Abbott could
misrepresent facts (I don't want to say
"lie") as bold-facedly as he does in his

letter. Even though he and the other
College Republicans fled the room as
quickly as they were able to weasel
through the appalled audience (Did
they all have appointments?), they did
not do so until after Andrew Gans of
the Mid-Peninsula YWCA AIDS Pre
vention Project and Patty Davis of the
San Mateo County Department of
Health Services made their initial
comments about the film. Gans and
Davis corrected factual errors made
regarding incubation time of the virus
and the opinion of the legitimate
medical community — excluding
actress Morgan Fairchild — on the
possibility of the HIV virus "going
airborne," to cite two substantive
examples that were offered before the
College Republicans' hasty departure.

I question John Abbott and the
College Republicans' motivation in
presenting this "documentary." If one
of their main goals was really dissemi
nating information that could poten
tially save lives to the many at
Stanford for whom "much vital infor- •
mation on the AIDS epidemic lies out
of reach," why did they not better
publicize their presentation?
Even a notice in Once Around The
Quad could have reached thousands of
indivduals who might not have chanced
upon one of the flyers left in dining
halls. And if the presentation of life
saving facts is so important to them
(and why, John, would an "established
fact" need "exposing?"), why don't the
College Republicans volunteer their
time to help with the Stanford AIDS

Education Project, the AIDS Outreach
Program sponosred by the Cowell
Student Health Center's Sexual Health
Program or the YWCA Mid-Peninula
AIDS Prevention Project.
I personally have never expressed a
desire that the College Republicans
"suppress critical information," as
Abbott writes. But they must be ma
ture enough to discuss what they've
done in presenting a film which was
offensive to many; one in which the
findings of a national government
study are totally discounted because
the study advises that almost a third
(30 percent) of teenage suicides occur
because of the unbearable pressures
our society exerts on gay youth; one in
which the hopes and goals of millions
of women are trivialized by identifying

former National Organization of
Women president Eleanor Smeal only
as "pro-abortion/lesbian rights activist";
one in which interviewees are nameless
— identified only with a subtitle
reading "homosexual" — until the end
of the film, when the audience is
treated to still photos of them, now
bearing the legend "Deceased."
An apology from John Abbott and
the Stanford College Republicans is
due, and I sincerely hope it is not only
to the gay and lesbian community at
Stanford, but also to the people who
have died from this horrific disease, to
the brave who are living with it and
to the compassionate who are taking
positive action to combat AIDS.
