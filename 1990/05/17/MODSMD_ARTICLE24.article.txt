## Can Stanford make a tennis triple-killing at NCAAs? 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Debbie
Graham provided the thunder; the big
guy upstairs provided the lightning.
Before a storm halted play at the
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships
yesterday, Graham defeated teammate
Sandra Birch in the semifinals of the
singles event.
An hour later, it was no longer
Graham vs. Birch. Instead, it was
Graham and Birch, together again on
the doubles court, advancing to the dou
bles final for the second straight year.
If Graham wins both events tomor
row, she will become the first player in
history to capture the team, singles and
doubles titles in the same year.
While the Cardinal sophomore was
the story on the court, the heart-stopper
of the day came courtesy of mother
nature. Two games into the doubles
semifinal pitting Meredith McGrath and
Teri Whitlinger against Oklahoma
State's Jackie Booth and Monika
Waniek, a thunderstorm that had been
lurking a few miles away came crashing
down on Scott Linder Stadium.
A bolt of lightning struck a nearby
building and caused an explosion that
sent everyone in the stands and on the
courts to jump, scream and run for
cover — in no particular order. The
match was suspended and will resume
today at 10 a m. (EDT).
After everyone had recovered, the ac
complishments of Graham once again
became the main topic of conversation.
Her defeat of Birch was her second such
win ever. The first came a month ago
at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif.
"I think I might have wanted it a
little more," Graham said afterward.
"One of my goals was to do really well
in this tournament. I've been working
very hard (to do that).
"I was in better shape than her,"
Graham continued. "I never thought I
gave her a game."
With the victory, Graham advanced
to center stage for the first time in her
college career, and she was enjoying the
spotlight. "Every time anyone referred
to the Stanford tennis team, it was
Sandra and Meredith," Graham noted.
Clearly that will not be the case any
longer. McGrath is heading for the pro
ciruit, and Birch hinted she might be
as well. Yesterday, however, Graham
showed that at the top of her game she

can beat Birch even when the defending
NCAA champ is playing well herself.
The match opened with Graham serv
ing and she quickly jumped ahead 1-0
when she hit a service winner at 40-30.
Graham's serve has been what she likes
to call a "huge factor" ever since the
doubles tournament began and would
eventually prove to be the difference
yesterday.
But Birch was not going to give in
easily at all. She fell behind 0-40 in her
first service game before winning five
points in a row to knot things at 1-1.
Graham closed out the next game on
another service winner after facing a
break point.
Both players stayed on the aggressive,
coming into the net often. But when
Birch served at 3-3, Graham broke her
serve and the complexion of the match
changed entirely. Three more breaks fol
lowed as Graham failed to follow in
strong first serves, and Birch's serve
became easy prey for Graham's powerful
groundstrokes.
With Graham serving at 5-5, she put
away three straight volleys to win the
game and move within striking distance
of capturing the set. Two lobs and two
errors off Birch's forehand in the next
game gave Graham the break at love
and a 7-5 triumph in the first set.
The service break parade then
resumed with a vengeance. Graham was
broken. Birch was broken. Graham was
broken. Birch was broken. ("Honey, is
the record broken?")
In the ninth game, Graham started
off with a rocket forehand winner to
go up 15-0. She put away a volley on
the next point for 30-0. After a Birch
approach shot was too much for

Graham, she came up with an unretur
nable serve and a 40-15 lead. Yet an
other service winner gave Graham the
game and a 5-4 edge in the set.
Birch entered the game having failed
to hold serve in her last seven tries.
The eighth time was not the charm.
Trailing 30-40, Birch hit another sting
ing approach shot that landed within
inches of the baseline. Graham called
it out. Birch saw it in.
She appealed to the umpire who con
firmed Graham's call, and the match
was over. "[Sandra] would have done
the same thing," Graham said of the
call, which she was confident she had
made correctly.
"I saw it good," Birch said, adding
that others had confirmed her opinion.
But it probably would not have mat
tered. Graham said even if she had lost
the game she was prepared to go on.
Indeed, she looked stronger than Birch
late in the second set. Birch acknowl
edged she might have to focus on her
conditioning, though she might not do
it at Stanford.
"I'm ready to move on," she said.
"[School workl takes its toll. It's very
exhausting. I'm looking forward to put
ting 100 percent into tennis."
She made it clear that her mind is
not made up, and speculation was she
would return for her senior year. Im
pressively, she put all the disappoint
ment and dispute aside in time to take
the doubles court with Graham and con
tinue their remarkable play.
Graham and Birch found themselves
in the semis after receiving a default
in the quarterfinals. Nicole Arendt won
her singles semifinal over Kansas'
Eveline Hamers and was so exhausted
and dehydrated she needed to receive
intravenous fluids.
Arendt and Jillian Alexander were
therefore unable to play their match
with Birch and Graham, allowing them
a walkover. So far in the tournament,
the Cardinal duo has turned most of
its matches into on-the-court walkovers
anyway.
Georgia's Shannan McCarthy and
Stacey Schefflin, the No. 2 seeds, hoped
to change all that yesterday but were
overmatched. Graham's thunderous
serve complimented the approaching
rain clouds, frequent lightning and
Birch's spectacular volleys nicely. The
end result was an easy 6-3, 6-3 win and
another chance to capture the NCAA
doubles title they came up one match
short of last year.

with Birch and Graham, allowing them
a walkover. So far in the tournament,
the Cardinal duo has turned most of
its matches into on-the-court walkovers
anyway.
Georgia's Shannan McCarthy and
Stacey Schefflin, the No. 2 seeds, hoped
to change all that yesterday but were
overmatched. Graham's thunderous
serve complimented the approaching
rain clouds, frequent lightning and
Birch's spectacular volleys nicely. The
end result was an easy 6-3, 6-3 win and
another chance to capture the NCAA
doubles title they came up one match
short of last year.

Sophomore Debbie Graham has caught fire at the right time, as she advanced to the
NCAA singles final with a victory over teammate Sandra Birch.
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Debbie
Graham provided the thunder; the big
guy upstairs provided the lightning.
Before a storm halted play at the
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships
yesterday, Graham defeated teammate
Sandra Birch in the semifinals of the
singles event.
An hour later, it was no longer
Graham vs. Birch. Instead, it was
Graham and Birch, together again on
the doubles court, advancing to the dou
bles final for the second straight year.
If Graham wins both events tomor
row, she will become the first player in
history to capture the team, singles and
doubles titles in the same year.
While the Cardinal sophomore was
the story on the court, the heart-stopper
of the day came courtesy of mother
nature. Two games into the doubles
semifinal pitting Meredith McGrath and
Teri Whitlinger against Oklahoma
State's Jackie Booth and Monika
Waniek, a thunderstorm that had been
lurking a few miles away came crashing
down on Scott Linder Stadium.
A bolt of lightning struck a nearby
building and caused an explosion that
sent everyone in the stands and on the
courts to jump, scream and run for
cover — in no particular order. The
match was suspended and will resume
today at 10 a m. (EDT).
After everyone had recovered, the ac
complishments of Graham once again
became the main topic of conversation.
Her defeat of Birch was her second such
win ever. The first came a month ago
at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif.
"I think I might have wanted it a
little more," Graham said afterward.
"One of my goals was to do really well
in this tournament. I've been working
very hard (to do that).
"I was in better shape than her,"
Graham continued. "I never thought I
gave her a game."
With the victory, Graham advanced
to center stage for the first time in her
college career, and she was enjoying the
spotlight. "Every time anyone referred
to the Stanford tennis team, it was
Sandra and Meredith," Graham noted.
Clearly that will not be the case any
longer. McGrath is heading for the pro
ciruit, and Birch hinted she might be
as well. Yesterday, however, Graham
showed that at the top of her game she

can beat Birch even when the defending
NCAA champ is playing well herself.
The match opened with Graham serv
ing and she quickly jumped ahead 1-0
when she hit a service winner at 40-30.
Graham's serve has been what she likes
to call a "huge factor" ever since the
doubles tournament began and would
eventually prove to be the difference
yesterday.
But Birch was not going to give in
easily at all. She fell behind 0-40 in her
first service game before winning five
points in a row to knot things at 1-1.
Graham closed out the next game on
another service winner after facing a
break point.
Both players stayed on the aggressive,
coming into the net often. But when
Birch served at 3-3, Graham broke her
serve and the complexion of the match
changed entirely. Three more breaks fol
lowed as Graham failed to follow in
strong first serves, and Birch's serve
became easy prey for Graham's powerful
groundstrokes.
With Graham serving at 5-5, she put
away three straight volleys to win the
game and move within striking distance
of capturing the set. Two lobs and two
errors off Birch's forehand in the next
game gave Graham the break at love
and a 7-5 triumph in the first set.
The service break parade then
resumed with a vengeance. Graham was
broken. Birch was broken. Graham was
broken. Birch was broken. ("Honey, is
the record broken?")
In the ninth game, Graham started
off with a rocket forehand winner to
go up 15-0. She put away a volley on
the next point for 30-0. After a Birch
approach shot was too much for

Graham, she came up with an unretur
nable serve and a 40-15 lead. Yet an
other service winner gave Graham the
game and a 5-4 edge in the set.
Birch entered the game having failed
to hold serve in her last seven tries.
The eighth time was not the charm.
Trailing 30-40, Birch hit another sting
ing approach shot that landed within
inches of the baseline. Graham called
it out. Birch saw it in.
She appealed to the umpire who con
firmed Graham's call, and the match
was over. "[Sandra] would have done
the same thing," Graham said of the
call, which she was confident she had
made correctly.
"I saw it good," Birch said, adding
that others had confirmed her opinion.
But it probably would not have mat
tered. Graham said even if she had lost
the game she was prepared to go on.
Indeed, she looked stronger than Birch
late in the second set. Birch acknowl
edged she might have to focus on her
conditioning, though she might not do
it at Stanford.
"I'm ready to move on," she said.
"[School workl takes its toll. It's very
exhausting. I'm looking forward to put
ting 100 percent into tennis."
She made it clear that her mind is
not made up, and speculation was she
would return for her senior year. Im
pressively, she put all the disappoint
ment and dispute aside in time to take
the doubles court with Graham and con
tinue their remarkable play.
Graham and Birch found themselves
in the semis after receiving a default
in the quarterfinals. Nicole Arendt won
her singles semifinal over Kansas'
Eveline Hamers and was so exhausted
and dehydrated she needed to receive
intravenous fluids.
Arendt and Jillian Alexander were
therefore unable to play their match
with Birch and Graham, allowing them
a walkover. So far in the tournament,
the Cardinal duo has turned most of
its matches into on-the-court walkovers
anyway.
