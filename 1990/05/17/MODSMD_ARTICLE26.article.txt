# Cardinal cycling team hosts nationals
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Lost in the shadows created by
its brilliant baseball and tennis
squads is the quiet success en
joyed by the Stanford cyclists.
Last year the team captured third
place at Nationals, its highest
finish ever, and will achieve fur
ther recognition this weekend by
hosting the U.S. Collegiate Road
Cycling Championships.
The fact that a good part of the
race will be held on Stanford soil
should provide the Cardinal with
an excellent opportunity to repeat
or possibly even improve upon last
year's finish. Wit Henisz, a team
member and one of the event's
co-directors, is very optimistic
about the team's chances.
"We definitely have the poten
tial to win the meet," Henisz said.
"To win, it really takes a really

special effort. We're not the fa
vorite to win, but the home crowd
should give us an edge."
The distinction of favorite goes
to the University of Colorado at
Boulder, the defending national
champions. They will head a field
of over 30 of the best collegiate
teams in the country in conten
tion for the title.
The teams have been selected
from over 200 squads in 10 con
ferences. Stanford, which finished
second out of 39 teams in the
Western Collegiate Cycling Con
ference this year, was nosed out
by California in the conference
championships for the second con
secutive year.
Due to its enormous size, the
WCCC will send five teams to na
tionals. UC-Santa Barbara, Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, and UCLA
will join the California and Stan
ford squads at this weekend's

meet. The Cardinal would like
nothing more than to upset the
Bears, last year's runner-up at na
tionals.
"We're out to prove that we're
the best in the Bay once and for
all," cyclist Tim Wainwright said.
"Cal has had a great deal of suc
cess over the past few years, but
I think we've got a chance to beat
them at home."
Stanford has also enjoyed a
great deal of success. This year's
third-place finish in the WCCC
marks the 11th year in a row that
the Cardinal riders have placed
in the top three in the conference.
This regional consistency has led
to national results recently, in
cluding top ten finishes in each
of the last two years.
Every participating school will
send five women and five men to
this year's meet. Men's and wom
en's point totals will be combined

to determine the overall cham
pion, a scoring method unique to
cycling.
Henisz feels that this year's
women's team is exceptionally
strong. "The women anchor this
year's team," Henisz said. "Al
though they may not have the
one superstar that many teams
have, we have five very, very good
riders. They are probably the
deepest team in the nation."
Erica Deese-Dobson, Liz Moyer,
Michele Sullivan, Amy Dawson,
and Laura Wilson will represent
Stanford in the women's races.
The men's team consists of Scott
Evans, Frank Scioscia, Brian
Sterling, Jeremy Herman, and
Coulter Richardson.
Stanford will travel to UC-
Santa Cruz for Saturday's portion
of the competition, which consist
