# Special Olympics: a chance to learn
## 
### 
There I was, standing
chest-deep in freezing
water at nine in the
morning, getting my butt
kicked by a swimmer whom I
was supposed to help to the
other side of the pool.
The setting was deGuerre
pool. The date was May 14,
1989. The event was the 20th
annual Stanford Special Olym
pics.
And the memory? Only the
single greatest day of my life
at Stanford.
When I had signed up to be
a volunteer the week before, I
was asked (for a very good rea
son) if I'd had any lifeguard
training. The job I signed up
for — lane-swimmer, a.k.a.
"The one who makes sure each
athlete gets to the other side
in one piece" — would, in a
worst-case scenario, involve
life-saving techniques.
(Thankfully, last year no one
needed any such help.)
What I wasn't asked was if
my ego was too sensitive. If
they'd asked, I would've said
no, but I still don't think I
would have been prepared for
what was to happen to me
while I "helped" each athlete
make his or her way across
that 25-yard stretch.
Now, I'm a good swimmer.
Really. There wasn't a swim
ming team in my hometown,
but at the end of every summer
the public pool would sponsor
age-group races, and I usually
walked away with every event
when 1 was in elementary
school. (Then 1 became a teen
ager, which meant I was much
too cool to care about the silly
Labor Day Swim Meet.)
Last year's Special Olympics,
then, were a chance for me to
use a little of my ability to help
some people who weren't as
talented, or as gifted, as I
thought I was. When I jumped
into the pool that Sunday
morning, I thought I was being
the proper Stanford student,
helping each athlete get as
much out of the day as possible.
What I didn't think about,
as the first of them got into
the water, was how much 1 was
going to learn.

Ever since 1 came here,
I've suffered from the
"I'm-pretty-damn-good"
syndrome. I'm sure you know
what I'm talking about: It's the
feeling of pride we take in what
we're able to do, a sense that
everything we've accomplished
we've done completely on our
own, an almost-unconscious at
titude that we're really some
thing incredible.
Call it the "We Got In" dis
ease, or whatever you want. I
know I've felt it over and over.
And part of me was feeling it
last May 14. . . but not for very
long.
I'm not sure when I first
started thinking about this:
maybe it was after one of the
supposedly helpless swimmers
left me in his wake (moving so
fast I couldn't catch up, no
matter how hard I tried),
maybe it was as I watched the
thousands of smiles and laughs
going around, or maybe it
wasn't until several days later.
Anyway, all I know is that
at some point I realized I
wasn't the one who was doing
anyone any great favors. Sure,
quite a few of the athletes there
that day needed my help, but
I wonder if what I gave them
came even close to what they
gave me.
Looking back on the day, I
realized that no matter how
good I am at what I do, I'm
merely taking advantage of the
gifts I've been given. No matter
what I accomplish, or how fan
tastic I think I am, all I have
has been given to me. I've had
no control over it.
Each and every one of those
athletes can say the same
thing. They're given certain
gifts, and they do what they
can with them. I wonder how
