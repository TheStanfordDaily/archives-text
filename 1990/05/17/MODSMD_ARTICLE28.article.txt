# Cevaer—'The Sundance Kid'—shines for Card golfers
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Imagine growing up in the South
Pacific on the sun-soaked island of
Tahiti. Imagine playing golf in your bare
feet and a bathing suit with a group of
friends, and then jumping into the lake
by the 18th hole to cool off after you've
finished.
This was the introduction to the game
that Stanford sophomore Christian
Cevaer enjoyed as a child. Growing up
in the French territories of the South
Pacific, he spent his spare time playing
the island's only golf course over and
over again.
After a few years of this, however,
he was ready for a greater challenge. It
came in the form of Pebble Beach,
renowned for its well-manicured greens
and elite country clubs where members
wear both shoes and white collared
shirts.
"I decided to come to California for
high school because I knew I would
have the chance to play golf more often
and on different courses," Cevaer ex
plained. "The atmosphere was very dif
ferent. Some of the clubs here in
America are very snobbish, with dress
codes and caddies and everything. I
guess I just had to get used to it."
Indeed, despite his initial culture
shock, Cevaer soon made a smooth tran
sition to life in the United States and
enjoyed a successful high school career.
He was the Central Coast Section cham
pion for three years in a row at Robert
Louis Stevenson High School and took
the Northern California high school title
his senior year. Some of his most im
pressive accomplishments, however,
were achieved on his summer vacations.
A win at the French Junior Champi
onships in 1986 first brought Cevaer to
the attention of the golf world. One
year later, he was part of the French
junior national team that snagged the
European Junior Championship. It was
in this tournament that he was dubbed
"The Sundance Kid" due to his South
Pacific origins.
"The team championship was played
against Scotland in Scotland," he says.
"When we won, it was one of the
greatest moments I've experienced in
golf."

This statement takes on greater sig
nificance when one considers how many
great moments Cevaer has had. In ad
dition to playing on a team that took
fourth in the 1988 World Champion
ships, he won the individual titles in
the Doug Sanders World Champion
ships, the British Youth Champion
ships, and the French Amateur.
Now a top competitor for the Stanford
golf team, he has had a chance to com
pare the collegiate and international
scenes and put his experiences in per
spective. "I went from high school to
the college level without any real diffi
culty because I had played on the na
tional level," he says."I didn't feel any
pressure playing my first college tour
nament. I just looked on it like any
other tournament: as something to try
to win."
Cevaer is also happy with his choice
of schools. "I knew about (Coach) Wally
Goodwin when he was at Northwest
ern," he says. However, the thought of
winters in Illinois made "The Sundance
Kid" slightly nervous.
"I had no desire to go to such a cold
place, so I was very happy when I found
out he had moved to Stanford at the
beginning of my senior year," Cevaer
says. "Besides, regardless of the golf,
who would want to turn away Stanford?
In high school I managed academics and
sports fine, so I knew I would be able
to do the same here."
Stanford has also benefited from the
deal. Despite his status as a freshman,
Cevaer quickly established himself as a
leader last year and topped off a suc
cessful season by winning the Pacific
10 Conference tournament by three
strokes. This year he has managed to

be even more consistent, although he
has yet to win a tournament.
"Christian has finished in the top
five six times this year, and three of
those finishes were seconds," Goodwin
says."I doubt if anyone in the U.S. has
matched this record. He has improved
his average over last year and shows a
lot of consistency. It's fun to win, but
it's great to be second every week too."
Cevaer agrees, but can't help hoping
that the final two tournaments of the
season will end his dry spell. "I'm
slightly disappointed because my goal
was to win golf tournaments, and I've
had some chances to do so — with the
second place finishes. So far I've just
fallen short, but hopefully I'll be able
to do well in future tournaments."
As a sophomore, he still has many
tournaments ahead of him. However,
Cevaer does not feel any pressure being
at the top at a young age. "In golf, it
doesn't matter what age you are," he
explains. "An 18-year-old can beat a
34-year-old. When I compete in amateur
tournaments, I play against people of
all ages, so I've gotten used to it."
Eventually, Cevaer hopes to raise his
level of competition up a notch to the
professional level. He has no intention
of doing so before he graduates, how
ever. "I'm playing NCAA golf because
I want to be a professional golfer. There
are two routes you can take to the pros:
one is to join the tour and learn as you
go along, and the other is to raise your
self to a level where you're not at the
bottom of the list when you start out.
I hope to do the latter."
Goodwin has no doubts that he will
be successful. "Christian is definitely
champion material. He has a good mind
for the game, and he is very level
headed. He has the potential to be a
really great player."
There is still a side of Cevaer that
belongs in the South Pacific, however.
"The other day when it was very sunny
out here I was playing golf, and I wanted
to get a tan," he explains. "So, I took
my shirt off and started thinking, 'Hey,
this reminds me of the good old days
in Tahiti.' Then my coach came along
and told me to put my shirt back on."
Despite his international acclaim and
lofty goals, the legend of "The Sundance
Kid" lives on.
