# Taking stock of student services
## Mahoney seeks to define new role, reorganize resources 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Registrar Sally Mahoney
thought she was going to face a
big task over the next few months
when she planned to computerize
access to student records.
But last week she learned she
would encounter an even larger
task — the reorganization of all
major student services at Stan
ford.
As the new acting vice president
for student resources, Mahoney
has been given an impressive
charge. Over the next year she
will have to define the job of the
new vice president and assemble
and organize the departments
that she will oversee.
She can hardly be faulted for
being a little bit nervous about
how she will accomplish this
monstrous task.
In spite of the amount of work
that this job will entail, Mahoney
says she sees it as an opportunity
to "take stock of the array of stu
dent services available at Stan
ford."
Mahoney says she foresees that
the "umbrella of student re
sources brings together student
services and the academic depart
ments." One of her first priorities
will be to go to the academic deans
and see how student services can
help support their agenda.
"How do we build on what is
positive and acknowledge what
new services have grown up?" she
asks.
Mahoney has had a long history
of working with students and with
the Office of Student Affairs.
Mahoney first came to Stanford
in 1961 as a graduate student in
English. In 1964, she decided to
join the administration and be
came a residence director at Bran
ner Hall, which at that time was
an all-women's dormitory.
In the late 19605, Mahoney be
came involved in what, partially
through her efforts, would even
tually come to be known as Stu

dent Affairs. During her few years
as an associate dean of students,
Mahoney says she, along with
others in the department, "con
figured in basic design the system
we have now."
Among other things, Mahoney
initiated the system of resident
fellows, helped define the fresh
man houses as the center for fac
ulty advising and developed the
outlines of the housing Draw.
In a task somewhat analogous
to her charge as vice president,
she said she helped consolidate
some of the counseling, psycho
logical and medical services into
their current structure.
Mahoney notes her last task at
Student Affairs was the develop
ment of Manzanita Park, which
was projected to be used for only
five years.
In 1970, Mahoney moved on to
the Office of the Provost, where
she became director of the sum
mer session.
She says this position gave her
experience in dealing with the dif
ferent parts of the University. The
summer session "is a microcosm
of the University as whole," she
added.
As director, Mahoney had to
work with the schools themselves,
with Student Affairs, and with
publicity for attracting students.
Overall, she calls the experience
a "wonderful thing."
Her experience in working with
different University departments
paid off when she became
registrar in 1973. Mahoney
describes her job as registrar as
"a faculty service with a large stu
dent clientele."
In particular, her duties include
overseeing publication of Univer
sity bulletins, record-keeping for
students, and assignment and
maintenance of classrooms.
Mahoney has also served as an
RF in Larkin and will continue
to be an academic adviser.
But perhaps her widest experi
ence comes from her participation
on numerous University commit

tees and on search committees to
fill administrative positions.
Mahoney is a member of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which is responsible for
setting degree requirements and
approving interdisciplinary pro
grams. She is also a member of
the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, which
establishes the grading system
and gives academic awards and
prizes.
Ironically, she was also head of
the search committee that in 1987
chose Robert Gregg to become
dean of Memorial Church. Gregg
was chair of the Action Plans for
Change committee that recom
mended the creation of the posi
tion of vice president for student
resources.
Mahoney says she believes her
experience gives her a "sense of
history" of Stanford, and she in
tends to draw on her experience
as registrar in her role as vice
president.
The transition to vice president
and the establishment of the new
department will not be easy tasks,
and Mahoney says she has some


Sally Mahoney
concern about the moves.
In particular, she says she is
bothered by the the "unknown"
nature of the assignment. No one
knows exactly how the depart
ment will be reorganized, she
adds.
While she does have the recom

mcndation of the Actions Plans
for Change committee as a
guideline, most of the task of im
plementing those recommenda
tions has been left to her.
There are some general plans
for the overall department, she
explains, but "how it will work
remains to be seen."
While maintaining the services
that work well, she says she wants
to remain open to new ideas and
new ways of organizing her de

partment.
In terms of management style,
Mahoney says she likes the con
sensus style of management but
also believes in delegating author
ity. "I like to be clearer about the
objectives and then move for
ward," she adds.
She says she has no definite
plans after a permanent vice pres
ident is found. "I assume the
registrar's position will still be
open."

Registrar Sally Mahoney
thought she was going to face a
big task over the next few months
when she planned to computerize
access to student records.
But last week she learned she
would encounter an even larger
task — the reorganization of all
major student services at Stan
ford.
As the new acting vice president
for student resources, Mahoney
has been given an impressive
charge. Over the next year she
will have to define the job of the
new vice president and assemble
and organize the departments
that she will oversee.
She can hardly be faulted for
being a little bit nervous about
how she will accomplish this
monstrous task.
In spite of the amount of work
that this job will entail, Mahoney
says she sees it as an opportunity
to "take stock of the array of stu
dent services available at Stan
ford."
Mahoney says she foresees that
the "umbrella of student re
sources brings together student
services and the academic depart
ments." One of her first priorities
will be to go to the academic deans
and see how student services can
help support their agenda.
"How do we build on what is
positive and acknowledge what
new services have grown up?" she
asks.
Mahoney has had a long history
of working with students and with
the Office of Student Affairs.
Mahoney first came to Stanford
in 1961 as a graduate student in
English. In 1964, she decided to
join the administration and be
came a residence director at Bran
ner Hall, which at that time was
an all-women's dormitory.
In the late 19605, Mahoney be
came involved in what, partially
through her efforts, would even
tually come to be known as Stu

dent Affairs. During her few years
as an associate dean of students,
Mahoney says she, along with
others in the department, "con
figured in basic design the system
we have now."
Among other things, Mahoney
initiated the system of resident
fellows, helped define the fresh
man houses as the center for fac
ulty advising and developed the
outlines of the housing Draw.
In a task somewhat analogous
to her charge as vice president,
she said she helped consolidate
some of the counseling, psycho
logical and medical services into
their current structure.
Mahoney notes her last task at
Student Affairs was the develop
ment of Manzanita Park, which
was projected to be used for only
five years.
In 1970, Mahoney moved on to
the Office of the Provost, where
she became director of the sum
mer session.
She says this position gave her
experience in dealing with the dif
ferent parts of the University. The
summer session "is a microcosm
of the University as whole," she
added.
As director, Mahoney had to
work with the schools themselves,
with Student Affairs, and with
publicity for attracting students.
Overall, she calls the experience
a "wonderful thing."
Her experience in working with
different University departments
paid off when she became
registrar in 1973. Mahoney
describes her job as registrar as
"a faculty service with a large stu
dent clientele."
In particular, her duties include
overseeing publication of Univer
sity bulletins, record-keeping for
students, and assignment and
maintenance of classrooms.
Mahoney has also served as an
RF in Larkin and will continue
to be an academic adviser.
But perhaps her widest experi
ence comes from her participation
on numerous University commit

tees and on search committees to
fill administrative positions.
Mahoney is a member of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which is responsible for
setting degree requirements and
approving interdisciplinary pro
grams. She is also a member of
the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, which
establishes the grading system
and gives academic awards and
prizes.
Ironically, she was also head of
the search committee that in 1987
chose Robert Gregg to become
dean of Memorial Church. Gregg
was chair of the Action Plans for
Change committee that recom
mended the creation of the posi
tion of vice president for student
resources.
Mahoney says she believes her
experience gives her a "sense of
history" of Stanford, and she in
tends to draw on her experience
as registrar in her role as vice
president.
The transition to vice president
and the establishment of the new
department will not be easy tasks,
and Mahoney says she has some

concern about the moves.
In particular, she says she is
bothered by the the "unknown"
nature of the assignment. No one
knows exactly how the depart
ment will be reorganized, she
adds.
While she does have the recom

mcndation of the Actions Plans
for Change committee as a
guideline, most of the task of im
plementing those recommenda
tions has been left to her.
There are some general plans
for the overall department, she
