Ambiguity still surrounds So
viet President Mikhail Gorba
chev's agenda for hia June 4 visit
to Stanford, although speculation
in the media has touched on a
major public address and a meet
ing with Silicon Valley busines
speople.
[Gorbachev's] schedule is not
completed," said Soviet press of
ficer Ivan Rumiantsev, who would
not confirm one press report
stating that Gorbachev will
deliver a speech during his
two-hour visit to campus.
The media has also reported
that Gorbachev has planned a lun
cheon with former President
Ronald Reagan in San Francisco.
A spokesperson at Reagan's Los
Angeles office confirmed that So
viet officials initiated contact but
denied that a meeting between
Reagan and the Soviet head of
state has been set up.
University President Donald
Kennedy said Tuesday that a
meeting with Silicon Valley

business leaders is a possibility,
as Gorbachev may want to discuss
technology transfers. Kennedy
also speculated that the Soviet
leader would be interested in
talking to experts about arms con
trol, economic restructuring and
environmental problems.
Regarding exact details of the
trip, however, "your guess is as
good as mine," said Kennedy.
Rumiantsev indicated that Mos
cow would make Gorbachev's
itinerary available within a week
after consultation with the White
House, Stanford and the State De
partment.
A visit to the Hoover Institution
by Gorbachev, however, seems
rather likely.
"I would be very surprised if
he didn't [visit]," said Charles
Palm, associate director of Hoo
ver.
At Hoover, a display of materi
als including czarist secret police
files from the Russian Revolution
and an original copy of the Com
munist Manifesto was set up
Tuesday by scholars anticipating
a visit from Gorbachev.
The files include secret police
reports and letters from Trotsky,
Lenin and other revolutionaries
that were collected at the Russian
embassy in France until 1924. At

that time a Russian ambassador
unsympathetic to the new com
munist regime in his country
secretly shipped the files to Hoo
ver in a diplomatic bag.
In a pact with the ambassador,
Vasily Maklakov, the documents
were kept in sealed, unmarked
crates in the attic of Hoover
Tower until his death in 1957.
Gorbachev is not the first head

of state to visit Stanford.
• In 1983, Queen Elizabeth II
attended a luncheon at Lou Henry
Hoover House.
• In 1984, King Carl GustafXVl
of Sweden met with Nobel
Laureates at Stanford's Hanna
House to discuss high technology.
• Also in 1984, French Presi
dent Francois Mitterand attended
a reception at Hoover House.
