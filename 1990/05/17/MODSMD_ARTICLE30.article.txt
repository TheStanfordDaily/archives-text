Tay-Sachs screening ends today
Today is the last day that health professionals
will hold a free screening to identify carriers of
the Tay-Sachs disease who might pass the gene
to their children.
The test, which takes five minutes to get
results, will be held at Tresidder Union in Oak
Lounge West from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Also, screen
ing will occur at the Stanford Medical Center in
Room MlO6 from 8 to 10 a.m.
Organizers say the test is not available through
private physicians' offices nor is it part of the
premarital exam.
Tay-Sachs is a recessively inherited genetic dis
order which causes destruction of the nervous
system, resulting in rapid deterioration of phys
ical and mental capabilities. Carrier rates in the
general population are 1 in 150, but the American
Jewish population has a carrier rate of about 1
in 30.
