# Kennedy: Write-ins should count
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
University President Donald Kennedy said yes
terday he thought it was wrong to toss out write-in
votes in last month's ASSU elections, but added it
would be highly inappropriate for him to intercede
in the conflict.
Kennedy said students should not rely on the
University administration to settle internal ASSU
squabbles.
The statement, made during lunch with The Dai
ly's editorial board, marks the first public statement
Kennedy has made about the ASSU elections com
missioner's highly controversial decision to disregard
write-in votes for fictional characters. Because of
the decision, no run-off election took place between
the Students First and People's Platform Council

of Presidents slates.
Kennedy also said he is hoping for sweeping
changes in the Greek system to make fraternities
and sororities centers for intellectual discourse and
cultural exchange. He said the present system is
not structured in a way that would make this vision
possible, and that the next fraternal affairs adviser
should be responsible for the shift.
In response to a question about the Student Con
duct Legislative Council proposal on discriminatory
harassment, Kennedy said he would have the
framers put it through a rigorous test before he
would sign it to make it"the law of the land."
He said that if the University of Michigan had
given a similar proposal a rigorous test, the school
could have avoided many problems it has encoun
tered with its implementation.
