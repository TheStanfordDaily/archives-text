# No longer just kid stuff, comic books come of age
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Comic books aren't just for kids
anymore.
Once, comic books were
(literally) a dime a dozen. Super
heroes and villains ran around in
tights, distinguished only by dif
ferent costume colors. Good inev
itably prevailed over evil with
formulaic plots and conflicts. And
due to the industry's reverence for
the Comics Code, a ratings system
similar to the motion picture scale,
artistic and literary creativity was
kept at a minimum, drawing
audicnces of only the very young
at heart.
About 10 years ago, though,
comic books began to change. Vital
characters died. Costumed heroes
became less invulnerable and more
human. And as the industry began
to disregard the once-powerful
Code, stories became more graphi
cally explicit, attracting grown-up
audiences with mature characters
and stories.
Today, comic books have be
come mediums for adventurous
storytelling, prolific writing,
abstract artwork and graphic nar
ratives. Amidst industries which
have exhausted almost all of their
creative outlets, comic books are
just beginning to challenge the
traditional boundaries. The indus
try's creative explosion has given
comics literary and artistic
credibility. And comics are no
longer just kid stuff.
This whole explosion started in
the early 1980s with what some
call the "Frank Miller superhero
revisionist movement." Miller, an
artist and writer, took the two
dimensional Marvel hero
"Daredevil" and placcd him in a
more realistic world, where loved
ones perish, lovers betray, villains
succeed and heroes bleed.
Soon, this trend caught on. DC
Comics' "Crisis on Infinite Earths"
killed off principal characters Su
pergirl and Flash in consecutive
issues. As comics started striving
for realism, audiences grew.
But the challenge to conven
tional styles didn't stop there.
Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight

Returns" series, widely recognized
as the turning point for the comic
medium, prophesized a Batman of
the future as a psychotic, recluse
vigilante. And as "Dark Knight"
discovered new styles in artwork,
DC's "Watchmen," a multi-level,
apocalyptic nuclear prophecy, gave
the medium literary credibility.
With words and artwork, comics
became poised on the cutting edge.
Today, comics continue to chal
lenge traditional boundaries, with
innovative mainstream magazines
and independent projects. The fol
lowing is a list of some of the
most entertaining, exciting, inven
tive and thought-provoking books
on the stands.
Big Numbers, by Alan Moore
and Bill Sienkiewicz, is a 12-issue
project which has the potential to

take comic
books to en
tirely new
levels. Moore
and Sienkie
wicz are both
pioneers in
their fields; the
past works of
these two have
set standards
for the comic
book industry.
Moore's prolific
writing style,
evidenced by
the apocalyptic
saga "Watch
men," made
people take DC
Comics' floun
dering "Swamp
Thing" serious
ly. Sienkie
wicz's eerie
painting and
abstract style,
imitated in
works like
"Ark h a m
Asylum," make
each panel an
individual work
of art.
Through
black-and
white sketches

and twisted construction, "Big
Numbers" illustrates the lives of
suburban British characters who
become displaced by a sprawling
new shopping mall. A glance at
the ambitious first issue reveals
intellectual conversation,
superhero-less suspense and defi
nite potential for success. Moore
and Sienkiewicz just may pull it
off.
Spider-man, by Todd McFar
lane, promises to be the main
stream comic event of the
summer, as fans wait to see if the
hottest artist in the industry can
write as well as he can draw. In
the fourth regular Spider-man title,
McFarlane will take the Marvel
Comics mainstay to new adven
tures, including a showdown with
the Lizard in the second issue.

McFarlane will
take the Marvel
Comics main
stay to new ad
ventures, in
cluding a show
down with the
Lizard in the
second issue.
McFarlane's
26-issue run on
"The Amazing
Spider-man"
currently sells
for over $250,
and Marvel is
taking advan
tage of his
popularity by
releasing the
first issue in
four separate
formats, in
cluding two

limited-print, collectors' edition
styles.
Wilderness, by Timothy
Truman, is a black-and-white
graphic novel series that results
from two years of historical re
search. Truman, one of indepen
dent comics' finest talents, traces
the life of Simon Girty, a renegade
who deserted the Americans dur
ing the Revolutionary War and
fought with the British and Native
Americans in the uncharted
forests. The writing is well-honed,
and Truman's illustrations are
magnificent. "Wilderness" is not
only a great story, but also a true
story.
Akira, by Katsuhiro Otomo, is
an expensive comic worth buying.
This Japanese epic saga describes
the lives of young teenage rebels
in post-World War 111 Japan who
find a mysterious child with
powers beyond physical science.
"Akira" is the name for a special
power with the potential to shake
the recovering world. Otomo's il
lustration is a step above tradi
tional Japanese animation styles,
and the scripting rivals American
works. The 1,800-page storyline
was recently squashed into a two
hour movie, but the comics allow

one to appreciate "Akira" again and
again.
Sandman, by Neil Gaiman,
Mike Dringenberg and Malcolm
Jones 111, consists of mini-epics
starring the Sandman, the god of
dreams, who interacts with mor
tals through their nocturnal fanta
sies and nightmares. The limitless
landscapes of the Sandman's
dreamworld and the human sub
conscious have given Gaiman the
literary freedom to become the new

Alan Moore.
Freud would be
proud.
Plastic
Forks, by Ted
McKeever, is
ironically
named for
McKeever's
concept of the
"ultimate dis
posable item."
Each issue of
the fully
painted, five
issue bookshelf
series is not
something to
throw away.
The off-beat
science fiction
story intro
duces scientist

Henry Apt, who discovers a proc
ess of asexual human reproduc
tion. After a conspiracy steals the
secret, hoping to make
"disposable" people of its own,
sparks start to fly.
Hellblazer, by Jamie Delano and
Sean Phillips, is perhaps the most
realistic, down-to-earth comic
available. Delano follows John
Constantine, a mysterious recluse
whose friends drop off like flies.
Hellblazer's stoic attitude about
life and relationships is particularly
interesting amidst the current
storyline, which revolves around
family affairs and deaths, sending
the hero on an emotional
rollercoaster ride.
For those new to the comic book
scene, paperback anthologies have
collected some of the best stories
in neat collections.
Later this year, Frank Miller
returns to comics with the highly
anticipated "Hardboiled," a mys
tery of a cyborg in search of his
memory and purpose. Undoubted
ly, Miller's words and artwork will
push the boundaries of graphic
novels even further. Now, as one
of the primary mediums for alter
native entertainment, comics have
definitely grown up. All that kid
stuff is just a memory of the past.

Code, stories became more graphi
cally explicit, attracting grown-up
audiences with mature characters
and stories.
Today, comic books have be
come mediums for adventurous
storytelling, prolific writing,
abstract artwork and graphic nar
ratives. Amidst industries which
have exhausted almost all of their
creative outlets, comic books are
just beginning to challenge the
traditional boundaries. The indus
try's creative explosion has given
comics literary and artistic
credibility. And comics are no
longer just kid stuff.
This whole explosion started in
the early 1980s with what some
call the "Frank Miller superhero
revisionist movement." Miller, an
artist and writer, took the two
dimensional Marvel hero
"Daredevil" and placcd him in a
more realistic world, where loved
ones perish, lovers betray, villains
succeed and heroes bleed.
Soon, this trend caught on. DC
Comics' "Crisis on Infinite Earths"
killed off principal characters Su
pergirl and Flash in consecutive
issues. As comics started striving
for realism, audiences grew.
But the challenge to conven
tional styles didn't stop there.
Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight

Returns" series, widely recognized
as the turning point for the comic
medium, prophesized a Batman of
the future as a psychotic, recluse
vigilante. And as "Dark Knight"
discovered new styles in artwork,
DC's "Watchmen," a multi-level,
apocalyptic nuclear prophecy, gave
the medium literary credibility.
With words and artwork, comics
became poised on the cutting edge.
Today, comics continue to chal
lenge traditional boundaries, with
innovative mainstream magazines
and independent projects. The fol
lowing is a list of some of the
most entertaining, exciting, inven
tive and thought-provoking books
on the stands.
Big Numbers, by Alan Moore
and Bill Sienkiewicz, is a 12-issue
project which has the potential to

take comic
books to en
tirely new
levels. Moore
and Sienkie
wicz are both
pioneers in
their fields; the
past works of
these two have
set standards
for the comic
book industry.
Moore's prolific
writing style,
evidenced by
the apocalyptic
saga "Watch
men," made
people take DC
Comics' floun
dering "Swamp
Thing" serious
ly. Sienkie
wicz's eerie
painting and
abstract style,
imitated in
works like
"Ark h a m
Asylum," make
each panel an
individual work
of art.
Through
black-and
white sketches

and twisted construction, "Big
Numbers" illustrates the lives of
suburban British characters who
become displaced by a sprawling
new shopping mall. A glance at
the ambitious first issue reveals
intellectual conversation,
superhero-less suspense and defi
nite potential for success. Moore
and Sienkiewicz just may pull it
off.
Spider-man, by Todd McFar
lane, promises to be the main
stream comic event of the
summer, as fans wait to see if the
hottest artist in the industry can
write as well as he can draw. In
the fourth regular Spider-man title,
McFarlane will take the Marvel
Comics mainstay to new adven
tures, including a showdown with
the Lizard in the second issue.

McFarlane will
take the Marvel
Comics main
stay to new ad
ventures, in
cluding a show
down with the
Lizard in the
second issue.
McFarlane's
26-issue run on
"The Amazing
Spider-man"
currently sells
for over $250,
and Marvel is
taking advan
tage of his
popularity by
releasing the
first issue in
four separate
formats, in
cluding two

limited-print, collectors' edition
styles.
Wilderness, by Timothy
Truman, is a black-and-white
graphic novel series that results
from two years of historical re
search. Truman, one of indepen
dent comics' finest talents, traces
the life of Simon Girty, a renegade
who deserted the Americans dur
ing the Revolutionary War and
fought with the British and Native
Americans in the uncharted
forests. The writing is well-honed,
and Truman's illustrations are
magnificent. "Wilderness" is not
only a great story, but also a true
story.
Akira, by Katsuhiro Otomo, is
an expensive comic worth buying.
This Japanese epic saga describes
the lives of young teenage rebels
in post-World War 111 Japan who
find a mysterious child with
powers beyond physical science.
"Akira" is the name for a special
power with the potential to shake
the recovering world. Otomo's il
lustration is a step above tradi
tional Japanese animation styles,
and the scripting rivals American
works. The 1,800-page storyline
was recently squashed into a two
hour movie, but the comics allow

one to appreciate "Akira" again and
again.
Sandman, by Neil Gaiman,
Mike Dringenberg and Malcolm
Jones 111, consists of mini-epics
starring the Sandman, the god of
dreams, who interacts with mor
tals through their nocturnal fanta
sies and nightmares. The limitless
landscapes of the Sandman's
dreamworld and the human sub
conscious have given Gaiman the
literary freedom to become the new

Alan Moore.
Freud would be
proud.
Plastic
Forks, by Ted
McKeever, is
ironically
named for
McKeever's
concept of the
"ultimate dis
posable item."
Each issue of
the fully
painted, five
issue bookshelf
series is not
something to
throw away.
The off-beat
science fiction
story intro
duces scientist

Henry Apt, who discovers a proc
ess of asexual human reproduc
tion. After a conspiracy steals the
secret, hoping to make
"disposable" people of its own,
sparks start to fly.
Hellblazer, by Jamie Delano and
Sean Phillips, is perhaps the most
realistic, down-to-earth comic
available. Delano follows John
Constantine, a mysterious recluse
whose friends drop off like flies.
Hellblazer's stoic attitude about
life and relationships is particularly
interesting amidst the current
storyline, which revolves around
family affairs and deaths, sending
the hero on an emotional
rollercoaster ride.
For those new to the comic book
scene, paperback anthologies have
collected some of the best stories
in neat collections.
Later this year, Frank Miller
returns to comics with the highly
anticipated "Hardboiled," a mys
tery of a cyborg in search of his
memory and purpose. Undoubted
ly, Miller's words and artwork will
push the boundaries of graphic
novels even further. Now, as one
of the primary mediums for alter
native entertainment, comics have
definitely grown up. All that kid
stuff is just a memory of the past.

Comic books aren't just for kids
anymore.
Once, comic books were
(literally) a dime a dozen. Super
heroes and villains ran around in
tights, distinguished only by dif
ferent costume colors. Good inev
itably prevailed over evil with
formulaic plots and conflicts. And
due to the industry's reverence for
the Comics Code, a ratings system
similar to the motion picture scale,
artistic and literary creativity was
kept at a minimum, drawing
audicnces of only the very young
at heart.
About 10 years ago, though,
comic books began to change. Vital
characters died. Costumed heroes
became less invulnerable and more
human. And as the industry began
to disregard the once-powerful
Code, stories became more graphi
cally explicit, attracting grown-up
audiences with mature characters
and stories.
