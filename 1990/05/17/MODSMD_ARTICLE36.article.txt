# Once-loathed artist succeeds on 'Spider-man'
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Erik Larsen knew he would be
loathed.
When Larsen took over his first reg
ular comic book, DC Comics' "Doom
Patrol," flocks of readers wrote letters
stating that Larsen's work, "too car
toony" in style, paled in comparison to
his predecessor's art.
"My artwork was loathed, " Larsen
said, "and this was just after a semi
popular guy."
But the true test was yet to come.
After a stint on Marvel Comics' "Punis
her," Larsen was offered a job on Mar
vel's flagship comic, "The Amazing
Spider-man." Promising young artist
takes over one of the world's most
popular comics; for Larsen, a dream
come true, right?
Wrong. Larsen was scheduled to take
over "Spider-man" right after a 25-issue
run by the hottest name in the industry,
Todd McFarlane. McFarlane had used
stunning layouts and obsessively
detailed webs to catapult "Spider-man"
back to its glory days. A lot of pressure
rested on die new kid in town. And
once again, Larsen was expecting to be
loathed.
However, with powerful, eye-catching
Covers, intricate backgrounds and
popular guest stars, Larsen has left his
skeptics speechless. With only his first

six issues, Larsen has proved not only
that he can hold his own, but that he
can improve upon the excellence. Sales
for "Spider-man" have never been bet
ter, and the comic is still the hottest
magazine around.
Finally, Erik Larsen knows what it's
like to be loved.
Intermission spoke with Larsen re
cently at an Oaldand convention.
Intermission: When did you begin
drawing?
Erik Larsen: I've been drawing comic
book characters since fourth grade. I
used to make my own comic books on
8 1/2 by 11" sheets of paper, folded in
half and stapled together in the middle.
I would team up my characters with
Marvel characters, and have them battle
it out. I continued drawing after I
finished school.
I: So how did you crack into the
comic book industry?
EL: I had been writing letters to Jim
Shooter, former editor in chief of Marvel
Comics, for years, just as a fan. I would
tell him what comics were good and
why and what comics were bad. Jim
would answer my letters personally.
Meanwhile, my dad owned a printing
press, and my friends and I used this
to put together our own self-published
comic book. This gave me something
tangible to work with. I sent my work
to a comic fanzine to get reviewed, and

In future issues, 'Peter
Parker will temporarily
give up his Spider-man
powers. And issue 350
will be simply shocking.

that publicity got me some work
through the mail, from guys who
wanted to publish their own comic
books and needed an artist. When I
was 19, I got my first regular job, as
artist of "Megaton" for a small, inde
pendent company called Megaton Com
ics.
I: How did you cross over to the big
companies?
EL: I finally got a chance to meet
lim (Shooter) at a Chicago comic con
vention. We actually plotted my first
job, a Hulk vs. Thor idea of mine, nght
there at the convention. The story
ended up being scripted by (Marvel
founder) Stan Lee and ran in "Thor"
three years later. I think Jim was a
little taken aback when I took him up
on his offer to start the project nght
there.
I: What was it like for you on "Doom
Patrol?"
EL: Basically, my artwork was

loathed. The transition from my
predecessor's work to my art was too
jarring for my readers, and they hated
me for it.
When I took over "Spider-man," I
tried to ease the transition between
Todd (McFarlane) and me a little bit.
We both have a quasi-cartoon style, so
it wasn't very difficult, and I didn't
have to change my own style too radi
cally. But I didn't feel all of the pressure
that I should've. because I pretty much
expected to be loathed.
I: So what's on the horizon for the
web-slinger?
EL: I plan to bring in a lot of char
acters, from old guys like the
Chameleon to new faces like Bloodlust,
a character from my stones in "Marvel
Comics Presents." There will be plenty
of new villains. And after the death of
Nathan, Aunt May's boyfriend, Peter
Parker will feel so guilty that he will
temporarily give up his Spider-man
powers. And issue 350 will be simply
shocking.
I: And what's in the future for Erik
Larsen?
EL: Eventually, I want to write and
draw my own book, and be left alone.
Being on such a big-name book really
changes things â€” you can't do every
thing that you want, and you end up
fighting for what you really want to
draw. With my own book, I'd have the
creativity to be really happy.
