## Batman comics show hero's dark colors 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
When Batman first emerged onto the
streets of Gotham City in 1939, many
doubted as to how long he would survive.
As superheroes go, he doesn't possess
any extraordinary powers. He doesn't fly,
communicate with animals, have X-ray
vision or spontaneously combust into a
pillar of flame (although some of his
enemies would have liked him to).
Batman is a mere man. Sure, he's a
multi-millionaire with gadgets that make
James Bond's arsenal look like tinker
toys, and he is in superb physical con

dition and knows the martial arts like
no one else in the world. In addition,
he's incredibly intelligent, with a
capacity for deductive logic that makes
Sherlock Holmes roll in his grave.
Still, when all is said and done, Bat
man is merely Bruce Wayne, a man
whose parents were killed in a petty
robbeiy. This incident, as one would ex
pect, filled him with incomprehensible
rage, but instead of merely seeking
revenge, he managed to turn his anger
into a personal crusade against all evil
doers.
As a superhero, Batman has evolved
quite a bit in the past half- century. At

one time gifted with, for him, nonsensi
cal abilities such as time travel and other
"super" traits, Batman has returned to
the roots of his dark, psychological his
tory.
Perhaps the factor most instrumental
in bringing this nocturnal being back
into the light of society was Frank Mil
ler's work, "The Dark Knight Returns."
First published in 1986, this epic chron
icles the reemergence of Batman some
time in the future, after some 20 years
of retirement. This future Bruce Wayne
is older physically — although still able
to kick butt — and so relies more upon
his mental capabilities to fight crime.

He is a more grim, determined and Mac
hiavellian man, who restores order to a
crime-ridden Gotham City utilizing
whatever means he deems necessary.
Still, his methods and intentions focus
on justice; however, the president and
his personal errand boy, Superman, fail
to agree with his means. The final con
frontation between the Dark Knight and
the Man of Steel is awe-inspiring, some
thing any fan of either should witness
for themselves.
The revival of interest in Batman
spawned by Miller's work led to an in-

credible upsurge in Batman litera
ture. Fueled also by the promised
release of the movie, graphic novels
such as "Year One," "The Killing
loke," and"The Son of the
Demon" heightened the excite
ment and interest. Although each
of these is well done, I highly rec
ommend "The Killing Joke." It
details the beginning of the Joker
and is masterfully done, in graph
ics and in a superb plot.
All of the works I've mentioned
above stay faithful to Batman's
dark origin and play successfully
off his psychological parallels of
darkness and pain with his
enemies. In fact, some of the most
interesting stories revolve around
the empathy Batman shares with
the criminals and the possibilities

that the origins and destinies of
Batman and his enemies are inex
tricably linked.
Other well-done works include
"Batman Year Two," recently re
leased in a graphic novel format,
and the latest paperback release,
"Arkham Asylum."
"Arkham Asylum" delves deeply
into the psychological makeup of
the Batman and his foes. Although
the plot doesn't involve much ac
tion, the artwork is amazing and
the psychological profiles of the
Joker, Two-Face, Clayface and
others grab the reader with their
intensity.
Overall, it seems that the con
cept of a man driven by a lifelong
obsession to superhuman achieve
ments in the name of good
provokes much more interesting
material with which to work than
many heroes gifted with super
natural abilities.
