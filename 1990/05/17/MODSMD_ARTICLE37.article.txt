## Batman comics show hero's dark colors 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
When Batman first emerged onto the
streets of Gotham City in 1939, many
doubted as to how long he would survive.
As superheroes go, he doesn't possess
any extraordinary powers. He doesn't fly,
communicate with animals, have X-ray
vision or spontaneously combust into a
pillar of flame (although some of his
enemies would have liked him to).
Batman is a mere man. Sure, he's a
multi-millionaire with gadgets that make
James Bond's arsenal look like tinker
toys, and he is in superb physical con

dition and knows the martial arts like
no one else in the world. In addition,
he's incredibly intelligent, with a
capacity for deductive logic that makes
Sherlock Holmes roll in his grave.
Still, when all is said and done, Bat
man is merely Bruce Wayne, a man
whose parents were killed in a petty
robbeiy. This incident, as one would ex

rage, but instead of merely seeking
revenge, he managed to turn his anger
into a personal crusade against all evil
doers.
As a superhero, Batman has evolved
quite a bit in the past half- century. At

one time gifted with, for him, nonsensi
cal abilities such as time travel and other
"super" traits, Batman has returned to
the roots of his dark, psychological his
tory.
Perhaps the factor most instrumental
in bringing this nocturnal being back
into the light of society was Frank Mil
ler's work, "The Dark Knight Returns."
First published in 1986, this epic chron
icles the reemergence of Batman some
time in the future, after some 20 years
of retirement. This future Bruce Wayne
is older physically — although still able
to kick butt — and so relies more upon
his mental capabilities to fight crime.

He is a more grim, determined and Mac
hiavellian man, who restores order to a
crime-ridden Gotham City utilizing
whatever means he deems necessary.
Still, his methods and intentions focus
on justice; however, the president and
his personal errand boy, Superman, fail
to agree with his means. The final con
frontation between the Dark Knight and
the Man of Steel is awe-inspiring, some
thing any fan of either should witness
for themselves.
The revival of interest in Batman
spawned by Miller's work led to an in-
