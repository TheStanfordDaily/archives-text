# Stanford professors grade the 'Classics'

### Raoul Mowatt Editorial staff 
Mark Twain once claimed that a clas
sic was something that everyone
wanted to have read, but no one wanted
to actually read. The recent revival of
a series of comics, however, intends to
change all that.
Based on new interest in comics as
an artform, the new series "Classics
Illustrated" marks an attempt to bridge
the gap between novels and readers.
Back in the early 19405, Albert Louis
Kanter developed the original concept
of "Classics" out of concern that great
literary works weren't getting enough
exposure. Unable to beat the growing
comics industry, Kanter decided to join
it by adapting established fiction to the
cheap, multicolored format.
In 1941, the line debuted and was
an instant success. But due to inflation
and weakened demand, "Classics"
ceased publication in the early 19705.
But with a resurgence of interest in
the comics medium, First Publishing
decided to take a risk in reviving the
concept of regular adaptations of fiction,

according to Wade Roberts, First Com
ics' "Classics" supervisor. First Publish
ing purchased the rights to the line and
began planning its strategy in partner
ship with Berkeley Publishing Group,
which is responsible for distribution to
bookstores and other markets.
"Before the ink was dry on all the
agreements, we were starting to assign
people" to develop classics, Roberts
said. "The first three books got under
way immediately." This alacrity helped
expedite the production, for each book
requires a year-long commitment from
an artist-writer team which must eat,
sleep, live and breathe the work of fic
tion that it is adapting.
The first few "Classics Illustrated"
issues which have come out this year
have showcased the best and brightest
that the comics field has to offer. And
from preliminary responses, the gamble
First took seems to have paid off,
Roberts says.
It's too early for accurate sales totals
from the books released thus far, but
some issues have gone back for second
printings after an initial run of 100,000.
What explains that sort of popularity?

Roberts attributes the high sales to
curiosity about the comics industry.
Sales may have been prompted by such
acclaimed books as Art Spiegelman's
"Maus," which related the rise of
Nazism in a gripping fable.
"A lot of people who are picking up
'Classics Illustrated' are people who
have never read comics before or who
have abandoned comics for a number
of years," Roberts said.
From the moment that you pick up
one of the newer Classics, you realize
that something powerful is happening
in your hands. No longer printed on
flimsy newsprint and coverstock, "Clas
sics Illustrated" now have a look more
approriate to classics.
"The old line was, I suppose, good
in its day," Roberts said. "But we are
doing a much more faithful job of
adapting the works." While its predeces
sor had standardized art for all
situations, todays classics use art to
convey the theme of the original and
compensate for the abridgement proc
ess.
But what do the toughest critics alive
— Stanford English professors — have

to say about them?
English Prof. Ron Rebholz read the
"Classics Illustrated" version of Hamlet
and found that the comic "really does
capture the spirit of the play. ... I was
engrossed by it."
Rebholz said that as a result of the
abridgement process, though, several
aspects of the play were overlooked or
became unclear. For instance, the motif
of poison, central to the play, becomes
less evident in the Classics version after
the omission of some key lines.
Despite these types of problems, the
comic pays close attention to other
details, such as the costume of the time
period. "It's a very balanced presenta
tion," Rebholz said of "Hamlet." "Given
the emphasis on soliloquies, it does of
course keep Hamlet at the center, but
it does give a pretty rich characteriza
tion of everyone else." Rebholz added
that he was considering experimenting
with the Hamlet in his introductory
Shakespeare class next fall to see if it
sparked sufficient interest in reading
the actual work.

But English Prof. Jay Fleigelman
had mixed feelings about Bill Sien
kiewicz's rendition of Moby Dick.
Fleigelman sees the comic as "a
critical essay on the book, a visual
essay in which the images interpret
the scenes rather than representing
the scenes."
"Part of the problem is that these
are such contemporary kinds of
images that they don't recover the
world of the book," Fliegelman
said. "They translate it into a sort
of familiar realm of images . ..
and in that sense, it's more an
updating."
P.Craig Russell, who adapted
Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scar
let Letter" for "Classics
Illustrated," conceded that the
comic books fall short of the

original works. "It's not as good
as the original," Russell said. "But
at least the readers of 'Classics
Illustrated' issues gain a sense of
cultural literacy."

Currently available issues of "Clas
sics Illustrated" include Edgar Al
len Poe's "The Raven," Robert
Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde," Mark Twain's "Tom
Sawyer" and Lewis Carroll's
"Through the Looking Glass." Up
coming works include "Robinson
Crusoe" and"The Three Mus
keteers. "
