# 'Concrete' evidence for comic book realism
## 
### Warren Scherffius Staff writer 
Traditional comic books have stories
where two mutants in spandex proceed to
clobber the snot out of one another for 30
pages, right? And then, there came
"Concrete."
"Concrete" is the creation of writer/artist
Paul Chadwick, a relative newcomer to the
business. Chadwick's only professional
comic work prior to "Concrete" was a five
issue run on Marvel's "Dazzler" title, but
his training as a commercial illustrator and
movie storyboard artist ("Pee Wee's Big Ad
venture," "The Big Easy") has made him a

masterful visual storyteller.
Published in several formats by Dark
Horse Comics, "Concrete" chronicles the
adventures of Ron Lithgow, a senator's
speechwriter whose brain has been trans
planted against his will into a huge, rocky
alien body.
True, Concrete physically resembles a
cross between the Michelin Tire Man and
a big Pillsbury Dough Boy left out in the
sun too long. And even casual comics
readers are quick to point out similarities
to Ben "The Thing" Grimm of "Fantastic
Four" fame. Concrete's secret identity and
implausible origin certainly hold no
surprises for the hardcore comics fan. So.

what's so special?
Aside from the one fantastic element of
his physical existence, "Concrete" stands
with both feet firmly planted in the real
world; no super villains, rousing fight scenes
or earth-threatening plots in this magazine.
Instead, it examines the struggles of a man
trying to maintain his humanity, utilizing
his new condition to explore realms and
situations denied to most people. In short,
Concrete turns a potential disability into
the opportunity of a lifetime. And yet,
whether he appears on "The Tonight Show,"
attempts a trans-Atlantic swim or mounts
a solo Everest expedition, things never quite
work out as expected.

In art, as in life, personality conflicts,
miscommunication, the unpredictability of
the environment and the pressures of hu
manity sometimes create crushing failures.
Some of the most affecting "Concrete"
stories are the simplest and quietest, dealing
solely with Concrete's reactions to ordinary
situations.
In"The Gray Embrace," featured in "Dark
Horse Presents" #4, Concrete fails to muster
the courage to initiate contact with a group
of beachgoers, instead choosing to play a
long-distance practical joke. In "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous," featured in "Dark

Horse Presents" #1, Concrete is
tricked into a personal appearance
at a child's birthday party.
In Concrete's own magazine, the
stories are just as interesting. In
"No Sweat!," he extols the joy of
work as he helps a family restore
its farm. And in "Always Fences,"
Concrete attempts to secretly visit
his dying mother. The stories
maintain a perfect blend of humor
and pathos, introspection and ex
position, words and silence. In ad
dition, "Concrete" has a wonderful
supporting cast, and the warmth
between the principal characters
elevates each story into a joyous
celebration of the triumph of love
and friendship over adversity.
Chadwick's attention to detail
and careful research make

"Concrete" a treasure-trove ot
images and information. His
black-and-white layouts possess a
kinetic energy that gives his stories
a seemingly effortless flow. Stories
about biology, geography, history,
agriculture or the exotic customs
ot distant lands contain multi
layered aspects of the environment
and unusual points of view.
"Concrete" is not an easy mag
azine to find. Early short stories
will soon be collected into a one
volume anthology. A 10-issue
black-and-white feature series
garnered three Eisner Awards, in
cluding "Best New Series," and
"Best Continuing Series." The
award-winning series will soon be
reprinted with some new material.
If the purpose of art is to hold
a mirror up to reality, examine the
human condition and present ideas
in entertaining, educational and
uplifting ways, then "Concrete"
succeeds admirably. Check it out.
