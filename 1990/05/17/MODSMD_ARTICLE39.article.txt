# 'Concrete' evidence for comic book realism
## 
### Warren Scherffius Staff writer 
Traditional comic books have stories
where two mutants in spandex proceed to
clobber the snot out of one another for 30
pages, right? And then, there came
"Concrete."
"Concrete" is the creation of writer/artist
Paul Chadwick, a relative newcomer to the
business. Chadwick's only professional
comic work prior to "Concrete" was a five
issue run on Marvel's "Dazzler" title, but
his training as a commercial illustrator and
movie storyboard artist ("Pee Wee's Big Ad
venture," "The Big Easy") has made him a

masterful visual storyteller.
Published in several formats by Dark
Horse Comics, "Concrete" chronicles the
adventures of Ron Lithgow, a senator's
speechwriter whose brain has been trans
planted against his will into a huge, rocky
alien body.
True, Concrete physically resembles a
cross between the Michelin Tire Man and
a big Pillsbury Dough Boy left out in the
sun too long. And even casual comics
readers are quick to point out similarities
to Ben "The Thing" Grimm of "Fantastic

what's so special?
Aside from the one fantastic element of
his physical existence, "Concrete" stands

or earth-threatening plots in this magazine.
Instead, it examines the struggles of a man
trying to maintain his humanity, utilizing
his new condition to explore realms and
situations denied to most people. In short,
Concrete turns a potential disability into
the opportunity of a lifetime. And yet,
whether he appears on "The Tonight Show,"
attempts a trans-Atlantic swim or mounts
a solo Everest expedition, things never quite
work out as expected.

In art, as in life, personality conflicts,
miscommunication, the unpredictability of
the environment and the pressures of hu
manity sometimes create crushing failures.
Some of the most affecting "Concrete"
stories are the simplest and quietest, dealing
solely with Concrete's reactions to ordinary
situations.
In"The Gray Embrace," featured in "Dark
Horse Presents" #4, Concrete fails to muster
the courage to initiate contact with a group
of beachgoers, instead choosing to play a
long-distance practical joke. In "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous," featured in "Dark
