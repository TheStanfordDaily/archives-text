# Sand Hill report may get go-ahead next week
## 
### Daryl Joseffer 
Stanford may soon know
whether it will get the green light
to proceed with an environmental
impact report on the controversial
Sand Hill extension project.
Residents have heavily con
tested the report, claiming that
approval from the city councils of
Palo Alto and Menlo Park was
based on a conflict of interest.
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Stan
ford approved the report last De
cember to study the effects of
extending Sand Hill.
The state is expected to rule on
that allegation soon, possibly as
early as next week. If the state
finds no conflict of interest, the
environmental impact report
could begin shortly. The report
will take six months to complete.
Stanford's effort to extend Sand
Hill Road to El Camino Real for
years has been a mtyor source of
tension between the University
and many of its neighbors. The
University believes the extension

would alleviate congestion on
campus roads and provide better
access to one of Palo Alto's busiest
business districts.
Opponents argue that the ex
tension would change traffic pat
terns and cause an influx of traffic
through northern Palo Alto resi
dential areas, disturbing the quiet
neighborhoods and lowering prop
erty values. Some 2,700 residents
of Palo Alto and Menlo Park have
recently signed a petition opposing
Stanford's efforts to extend Sand
Hill Road to El Camino Real.
If the environmental impact
report does not show a significant
negative impact, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park would likely approve
the extension, allowing Stanford
to begin construction as early as
January 1991.
Residents of Palo Alto appealed
the Palo Alto City Council's deci
sion to commission an environ
mental impact report, arguing
that it resulted from a conflict of
interest because of the Universi
ty's presence on the City Council's
policy committee.
The council is composed of two
Stanford administrators, two
members of the Palo Alto City
Council and two members of the
Menlo Park City Council.
Some Palo Alto residents hope
the state will rule that the Uni
versity's role is a conflict of in
terest, which could invalidate the
City Council's vote for the envi
ronmental impact report, com
plicating Stanford's efforts to
extend Sand Hill.
Sand Hill Road currently ends
at the Stanford Shopping Center.
To reach El Camino, motorists
from Sand Hill currently cut
through the shopping center
parking lot, turn onto Arboretum
Road and filter through campus
roads or find alternate routes
through Menlo Park neighbor
hoods.
The University hopes to extend
Sand Hill to El Camino through
the parcel of Stanford land be
tween the shopping center and
San Francisquito Creek. Andy
Doty, Stanford's director of com
munity relations, explains that
Stanford is "doing the area a favor
by building what is, in effect, a
public highway."

Residents of Palo Alto fear they
will suffer from the rerouting of
commuter traffic. According to
Palo Alto transportation officer
Marvin Overway, however, "the
extension itself is relatively minor,
so it won't have a mtyor effect."
Tony Badger, a resident of Palo
Alto and leader of Neighbors
Against the Sand Hill Extension,
opposes even the environmental
impact report. He said he believes
the report is too costly and un
necessary: "There's enough data
that's available, currently, that I
think the city should look at with
out going ahead with any EIR."
Stanford is paying the $500,000
cost of the report, but if Palo Alto
withdraws its support from the
Sand Hill extension the city will
have to pay half the cost of the
report.
Residents of northern Palo Alto
fear the extension will allow com
muters heading to Highway 101
to cross El Camino and continue
on Alma Street. Cars would then
shortcut through the quiet resi
dential area.
Doty claims that will never hap
pen, as no member of the Palo
Alto City Council is likely to ap
prove that option. Instead,
motorists would turn left or right
onto El Camino and find another
route.
A 1984 environmental impact
report showed that between 75
and 95 percent of the cars using
the extension would be "existing

vehicles diverted from more cir
cuitous routes" in the area. Doty
interprets this data as meaning
that the extension will not sub
stantially increase the flow of traf
fic to El Camino.
Badger disputes that claim, ar
guing, "If you make a convenient
hookup to El Camino, you're
going to change the way people
use Sand Hill Road."
He also believes that the exten
sion will create a bottleneck at
the intersection of Sand Hill and
El Camino, because traffic on the
extension "has to be swallowed
up totally by El Camino."
Badger explains that traffic cur
rently "gets out onto El Camino
in a more diffuse manner," since
motorists use a variety of routes
through Menlo Park and the
campus to reach El Camino. Doty
questions the validity of that
claim, however, arguing that there
is no bottleneck at the intersection
of Sand Hill and Santa Cruz.
Opponents also claim the exten
sion will open Stanford up for
more land development. The Uni
versity denies that claim, explain
ing that the land in question is
already open for development due
to Interstate 280.
Another fear has been that a
Sand Hill extension would revive
plans for a Willow Expressway to
connect 280 and 101. Construc
tion of that expressway would re
quire bulldozing a path through
two miles of homes.

by building what is, in effect, a
public highway."

Residents of Palo Alto fear they
will suffer from the rerouting of
commuter traffic. According to
Palo Alto transportation officer
Marvin Overway, however, "the
extension itself is relatively minor,
so it won't have a mtyor effect."
Tony Badger, a resident of Palo
Alto and leader of Neighbors
Against the Sand Hill Extension,
opposes even the environmental
impact report. He said he believes
the report is too costly and un
necessary: "There's enough data
that's available, currently, that I
think the city should look at with
out going ahead with any EIR."
Stanford is paying the $500,000
cost of the report, but if Palo Alto
withdraws its support from the
Sand Hill extension the city will
have to pay half the cost of the
report.
Residents of northern Palo Alto
fear the extension will allow com
muters heading to Highway 101
to cross El Camino and continue
on Alma Street. Cars would then
shortcut through the quiet resi
dential area.
Doty claims that will never hap
pen, as no member of the Palo
Alto City Council is likely to ap
prove that option. Instead,
motorists would turn left or right
onto El Camino and find another
route.
A 1984 environmental impact
report showed that between 75
and 95 percent of the cars using
the extension would be "existing

vehicles diverted from more cir
cuitous routes" in the area. Doty
interprets this data as meaning
that the extension will not sub
stantially increase the flow of traf
fic to El Camino.
Badger disputes that claim, ar
guing, "If you make a convenient
hookup to El Camino, you're
going to change the way people
use Sand Hill Road."
He also believes that the exten
sion will create a bottleneck at
the intersection of Sand Hill and
El Camino, because traffic on the
extension "has to be swallowed
up totally by El Camino."
Badger explains that traffic cur
rently "gets out onto El Camino
in a more diffuse manner," since
motorists use a variety of routes
through Menlo Park and the
campus to reach El Camino. Doty
questions the validity of that
claim, however, arguing that there
is no bottleneck at the intersection
of Sand Hill and Santa Cruz.
Opponents also claim the exten
sion will open Stanford up for
more land development. The Uni
versity denies that claim, explain
ing that the land in question is
already open for development due
to Interstate 280.
Another fear has been that a
Sand Hill extension would revive
plans for a Willow Expressway to
connect 280 and 101. Construc
tion of that expressway would re
quire bulldozing a path through
two miles of homes.

The Sand Hill extension project, which would extend the road to El Camino Real past the Stanford
Shopping Center, has been a major source of tension between the University and community members.
The project has been stalled for years because residents fear the project will disturb their quiet
neighborhood and lower property values.
Stanford may soon know
whether it will get the green light
to proceed with an environmental
impact report on the controversial
Sand Hill extension project.
Residents have heavily con
tested the report, claiming that
approval from the city councils of
Palo Alto and Menlo Park was
based on a conflict of interest.
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Stan
ford approved the report last De
cember to study the effects of
extending Sand Hill.
The state is expected to rule on
that allegation soon, possibly as
early as next week. If the state
finds no conflict of interest, the
environmental impact report
could begin shortly. The report
will take six months to complete.
Stanford's effort to extend Sand
Hill Road to El Camino Real for
years has been a mtyor source of
tension between the University
and many of its neighbors. The
University believes the extension

would alleviate congestion on
campus roads and provide better
access to one of Palo Alto's busiest
business districts.
Opponents argue that the ex
tension would change traffic pat
terns and cause an influx of traffic
through northern Palo Alto resi
dential areas, disturbing the quiet
neighborhoods and lowering prop
erty values. Some 2,700 residents
of Palo Alto and Menlo Park have
recently signed a petition opposing
Stanford's efforts to extend Sand
Hill Road to El Camino Real.
If the environmental impact
report does not show a significant
negative impact, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park would likely approve
the extension, allowing Stanford
to begin construction as early as
January 1991.
Residents of Palo Alto appealed
the Palo Alto City Council's deci
sion to commission an environ
mental impact report, arguing
that it resulted from a conflict of
interest because of the Universi
ty's presence on the City Council's
policy committee.
The council is composed of two
Stanford administrators, two
members of the Palo Alto City
Council and two members of the
Menlo Park City Council.
Some Palo Alto residents hope
the state will rule that the Uni
versity's role is a conflict of in
terest, which could invalidate the
City Council's vote for the envi
ronmental impact report, com
plicating Stanford's efforts to
extend Sand Hill.
Sand Hill Road currently ends
at the Stanford Shopping Center.
To reach El Camino, motorists
from Sand Hill currently cut
through the shopping center
parking lot, turn onto Arboretum
Road and filter through campus
roads or find alternate routes
through Menlo Park neighbor
hoods.
The University hopes to extend
Sand Hill to El Camino through
the parcel of Stanford land be
tween the shopping center and
San Francisquito Creek. Andy
Doty, Stanford's director of com
munity relations, explains that
Stanford is "doing the area a favor
by building what is, in effect, a
public highway."
