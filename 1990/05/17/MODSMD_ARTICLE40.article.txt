## Questin' Tribe more than De La Copy 
### Paul Yu 
"People's Instinctive Travels in the
Paths of Rhythm" is the debut album
by A Tiribe Called Quest, a group con
sisting of rappers Ali, Phife, Q-Tip and
Jarobi. The Thbe's front man, Q-tip, may
be familiar to fans of De La Soul as that
young-sounding rapper on "Me Myself
and I" who interjects some words of
wisdom in Posdnuos' soliloquy: "People
think they dis my person/cause they
think I'm darkly packed, (meaning that
he is a dark-skinned black)/I know this/so
I point at Q-tip and he states: 'Black is
Black.'"
Like their friends in De La Soul, the
Tribe raps on multi-layered sound col
lages of jazzy instrumentals funkified
with great rhythms. The Tribe contrib
uted to De La Soul's "3 Feet High and
Rising" on a few tracks, but their styles
of rap are quite similar. Both have a
quick and witty style of delivery, with a
relaxed attitude.
Both emphasize melody more than
most rap, deriving this element heavily
from sampled bits of old songs. (While
De La Soul borrowed from Steely Dan
and the Turtles, the Tribe borrows from
Lou Reed and '70s jazz and funk.) De
La Soul and the Tribe are young — both
recently graduated from high school.
And finally, both groups are less con
cerned with making extremely serious
statements than being funny, as Q-Tip
declares in the beginning of the album,

on "Push it Along:" Q-tip is my title/1
don't think it's vital/for me to be your
idol/but dig this recital: /If you can envi
sion/A brother who ain't dissin'/Saying
this and that/Causing this and that was
missing.
These fellows are more than De La
Proteges, however. Their raps have taken
the Posdnuos/Prince Paul school of sam
pling in a different direction. While De
La Soul was less concerned with organ
izing the collage of jazzy riffs and vocals
than getting an overall effect, A Tribe
Called Quest pastes their riffs together
in a scholarly fashion by comparison.
"Sound Provider" Ali Shali Muhammad

is extremely skilled at combining sam
ples from quite disparate sources and
making a tight, cohesive melodic back
ground.
The album is not nearly as random
and chaotic as De La Soul and slightly
more elaborate. The songs have intros,
melodies and bridges and are pretty
catchy. Muhammad really knows how
to put together a song, taking almost all
of his samples from 1970s jazz and funk
tunes. He has a good ear for jazz and
overlays the songs with killer bass and
rhythm parts.
The rhymes are okay, but the stories
are really good. The single "I Left My
Wallet in El Segundo" is mediocre, but
"The Luck of Lucien," the story of a
black French exchange student in Amer
ica, is funny. Both have good music to
go along with the raps.
A sense of humor pervades the entire
album. "Pubic Enemy" is a clever rap
about sexually transmitted diseases and
the rewards of promiscuity. Consistent
with their relaxed, mellow delivery is
their tendency to speak in a semi-drawl,
to stretch out words and push against
the beat. It makes the raps much more
interesting.
They are not quite as clever or funny
as De La Soul, but the raps and music
of A TYibe Called Quest are definitely
in the same league, though rather differ
ent. If you like De La Soul's sense of
humor, you'll probably enjoy A Tribe
Called Quest.
