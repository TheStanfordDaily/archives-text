## Squeeze-ing more albums out of the same old songs 
### Chris Harris Staff writer 
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to the National
Gallery of Useless Endeavors,
where you'll find such purposeless
objects as speed bumps, Electronic
Battleship, and most vice presi
dents from the past 200 years.
We are especially proud of our
music collection here at the gallery,
ranging from the Carpenters boxed
set to "Marcel Marceau on tape."
But now, I direct your attention
to the latest addition to our point
less collection: "A Round and A
Bout," a new live album from
Squeeze. Let us take a closer look.
For a live album to be anything
but redundant (and hence, point
less), it needs to provide the lis

tener with that extra something
special, that oomph that one can't
find on a studio album. Squeeze,
known for their lively, interactive
concerts, would seem to be a
promising band to do this.
With this in mind, there is noth
ing inherently wrong with "A
Round and A Bout." Fourteen of
Difford and Tilbrook's more well
known songs, recorded during
Squeeze's "Frank" tour last year,
are played. But although there are
exceptions, the album falls short
of being the fun experience one
expects it to be.
Perhaps it's the choice of songs.

Although few should be unfamiliar
(almost every tune hails from their
"Singles" collection or last two al
bums), many are simply straight,
yawn-stimulating renditions of
their studio counterparts. Sure, I
tapped my feet during "Pulling
Mussels from a Shell," but I wasn't
being rhythmical — just impatient.
And although "Tempted" and
"Black Coffee in Bed" sound as
good and fun as they should be in
front of 10,000 singing teenagers,
one nagging question is never
solved: just what is the point of a
live version of "Up the Junction"?
Surprisingly, the material from
their most recent album "Frank",
a generally mediocre effort, shines
in live format. "Dr. Jazz" and
"Slaughtered, Gutted, and
Heartbroken" have never sounded

Many of these live songs are simply
straight, yawn-stimulating renditions of
their studio counterparts.

better, and when the entire audi
ence harmonizes "Is That Love,"
the album finally sounds like what
it should have all along.
Alas, it's not enough to make
up for the other, all-too
conventional melodies. Like I said,
there's nothing definitely wrong
with this collection. It's simply a
good live album. But when there
are better versions of better songs
on better Squeeze albums and col

lections, this effort seems, well,
useless.
So if you're dying for another
version of "Hourglass" and think
that "Annie Get Your Gun" was
pop music's greatest moment .. .
or if you happen to enjoy flavored
popcorn, The New Munsters and
other completely pointless pieces
from our gallery, then the new live
Squeeze album may just be for
you. Otherwise, I must give this
collection around and about a 6.
