Yuck!
Though not exactly eloquent,
the word adequately sums up
my feelings for the movie "Class
of 1999," on several different
levels.

daughter, who is the girlfriend
to the leader of the Blackhearts'
gang, and frame the leader of
the other gang, the Razorheads.
The two gangs, after expending
thousands of rounds of ammo
on each other, realize that their
common enemy is that old
standby of authority, the teach
ers. Yuck!
