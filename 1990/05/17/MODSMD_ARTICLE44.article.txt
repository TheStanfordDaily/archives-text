# Riveting characters heat up 'Burn This'
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
In Lanford Wilson's explosive
drama, "Burn This," currently per
formed by the American Conser
vatory Theatre, riveting, passionate
characters light up the stage with
straightforward talk and action.
There's Anna, the gifted but iso
lated dancer? Pale, the hot-blooded,
coke-snorting restaurant manager;
Larry, Anna's quick- witted gay
roommate; and Burton, Anna's
smugly successful boyfriend.
As the play begins, we learn that
Anna's dancer partner, Robbie, has
just been killed in a boating acci
dent along with his male lover.
Anna had a tender attachment to
Robbie. When Robbie's brother,
Pale (as in VSO Pale), intrudes on
her in the middle of the night in
her New York apartment, she's un
able to supress her attraction, de
spite admitting that Pale is
dangerous.
As Anna, Andrea Marcovicci's
overall performance is beautifully
self-contained and has a nice shape
to it, but she often appears stiff.
When she returns from Robby's
funeral, her despair is all in her

head, and she doesn't project her
feelings. She loosens up when she
begins to dance, but her concluding
scene with Pale rings false, and it
may have come to a more natural
resolution if Marcovicci started off
on a higher emotional plane.
Daniel Reichert electrifies the
stage with his aggressive portrayal
of Pale. He brings enormous di
mension to this hardcore, street
wise character, and shows the
admirable qualities that are under
neath Pale's fiery outbursts.
In a vulnerable moment, Pale
collaspses in tears when reminded
of his brother, but he's usually
caustic, drunk and foul-mouthed,
rattling on about spending his life
looking for a parking space.
As Anna's roommate Larry,
Wesley Mann is convincing and
has excellent comedic timing.
When he's caught in an awkward
situation, he relieves tension by
doing an offbeat imitation of
Divine's "Lust in the Dust"

"Burn This" runs through June 17
at the Stage Door Theater, 420
Mason Street, around the comer
from the Geary Theater.
