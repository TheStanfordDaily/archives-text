# Ceremony offers workers a mixed message
## 
### Robert L Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
With carnival-like fanfare — complete
with popcorn, music and balloons — Ad
ministrative Resources officials yesterday
recognized the accomplishments of
University laborers. But the officials also
warned of future layoffs that could rain on
the workers' parade.
More than 600 Administrative Resources
workers and directors gathered in Lagunita
Courtyard for an "appreciation ceremony"
in tribute to labor and "to celebrate the
successes and milestones of Stanford's
workers," said Su Schaffer, vice president
for Administrative Resources.
About 165 employees also received service
pins awarded for each five-year period of
service to the University.
But the event was not entirely a celebra
tion. Rodney Barnette, field representative
for the United Stanford Workers, circulated

black-ribbon arm bands and letters as signs
of silent protest to the layoffs of 21 food
service employees last week.
Barnette also cited decreasing morale
among the workers, worsening job condi
tions and the University's use of outside
contractors as reasons for his symbolic ges
ture.
"We are doing this because we think that
what the University is doing is unfair," Bar
nette said in an interview before the cere
mony. "Contracting out will especially result
in more layoffs and prevent the contracting
of work to USW workers."
SchafTer implored the workers not to "lis
ten to rumors, but facts" and called workers'
concerns about Stanford contracting outside
labor "unwarranted." She noted that one
contractor in Escondido Village was recently
dropped in favor of University employees.
Sdiaffer, however, was not as optimistic
about the future of jobs in Administrative
Resources. As a result of departmental

budget cuts, Schaffer detailed probable in
ternal layoffs, effective as early as this fall.
SchafTer's department will first submit its
recommendation for layoffs to a University
steering committee tomorrow for consider
ation. If passed, Administrative Resources
will reduce its total staff of 751 employees
by 85 positions between September 1990
and September 1991, she said.
Of the 85 positions to be cut, 32 are
presently vacant.
Preliminary plans call for the elimination
of 22 positions by Sept. 1 and 31 positions
the following year. Although layoff notices
will not be available until June for the up
coming fall cuts, Schaffer said that Stan
ford's intent is to place as many of the 22
workers in other positions throughout the
University.
"Through an in-placement process we will
work with those who are laid off to develop

other skills so that they can get
other positions in the University,"
SchafTer said, also sharing her
hope that the workers would
choose to remain a part of the
Stanford family.
University President Donald
Kennedy, speaking at the cere
mony, also called the workers as
an integral part of the University
family, while noting that the im
pending layoffs may be a neces
sary evil.
"There is no intention to selec
tively impact those that work with
hearts and hands for this Univer
sity," he said.
"Stress is always worse in an
ticipation of what we don't know
than in the aftermath of diffi
culty."
