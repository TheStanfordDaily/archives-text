# Many sorority members report sexual coercion
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Twenty percent of Stanford
sorority members have experi
enced attempted or actual sexual
coercion at a sorority or fraternity
function, according to a student
survey released yesterday.
About 90 percent of the respon
dents said they had faced pressure
to consume alcohol at Greek
events, and 25 percent had been
pressured to engage in "regret
table sexual activity." A quarter
of the women in the 150-person
survey said they would not expect
the same pressures at a dorm
party.
Former Intersorority Council
member Debbie Chang and Kappa
Kappa Gamma member Tracy
Gordon presented these and other
preliminary findings at a noon
forum held yesterday in El Centro
Chicano.
An audience composed of
mostly sorority and some frater
nity members yesterday discussed
the effectiveness of traditional
rape educational programs and at
titudes prevalent in all-male living
groups, among other issues, as
part of Rape Awareness Week.
Gordon and Chang made
several recommendations based
on the survey results. They noted,
for example, that while nearly 70

percent felt the issue of acquaint
ance rape had been discussed
enough in their sorority, an equal
number felt that actual policy im
plementation has been inade
quate.
More self-assertiveness training
for women, educational programs
specifically tailored to fraternity
and sorority members and a for
mal protocol for reporting sexual
assault within the Greek system
were among the suggestions.
Gordon noted that while factors
such as alcohol do not cause in
cidences of sexual coercion to oc
cur, they can act as catalysts.
"There are many factors in so
ciety which contribute to rape,"
she said. "I feel there is tremen
dous potential for change in the
Greek system because people are
close-knit" and willing to work
together.
Although half of the respon
dents had attended an educational
program on rape, their attitudes

and behaviors were similar to
those of women who had not un
dergone rape education.
"Stanford students are very
good at absorbing knowledge and
learning facts, but I'm not sure
they always can personalize that
experience and say, 'What mean
ing, what significance does this
have for me?' " said Michael
Hughes, fraternal affairs adviser,
explaining the ineffectiveness of
educational programs.
This was also evident in wom
en's reluctance to label their ex
periences as rape. Even when an
incident met the legal definition
of rape, women were more likely
to say they had experienced some
thing "approaching rape," said
Gordon.
Gordon hopes to create more
effective educational programs by
tailoring them specifically to fra
ternity and sorority members.
"These statistics speak directly to
people in the Greek system at
Stanford," she said.
Another behavior which contri
butes to acquaintance rape may
be the "token resistance" toward
sexual gestures on the part of
some sorority women, the stu
dents reported. Fewer than one
third of the women surveyed
agreed strongly that other women
who say no mean it, and only half
agreed strongly that they meant

no when they said it.
According to Gordon, who
stressed that she was not inter
ested in blaming the victim, some
women say no without meaning
it because "women are condi
tioned not to be known as promis
cuous."
Statistics on reporting rape
were also revealing. None of the
women in the survey had reported
an incident of actual or attempted
sexual coercion to the police, and
only three percent of victims
sought counseling after an inci
dent.
More than half felt they were
partially to blame, which "makes
people less likely to share their
experiences," said Gordon.
While 85 percent said hypot
hetically they would feel comfort
able seeking support from their
sorority sisters, only 60 percent
of women who had survived an
incident actually did tell someone
about their experience.
During the open forum segment
of the discussion, Suha Jhaveri,
a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority,
noted that the largely female au
dience points to a larger problem
of raising consciousness in frater
nities. "Seeing other people as
people and not objects" is key to
changing behavior, she said.
"The bottom line is getting men
to care more about this issue than
about their brothers in the fra
ternity. This might sound like
sacrilege to some people, but . . .
[fraternity members! cannot
stand up for their brothers' right
to rape someone," said Marty
Smith, a member of Beta Theta
Pi fraternity.
