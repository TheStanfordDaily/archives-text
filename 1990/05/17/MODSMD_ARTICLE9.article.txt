# Campus politicos give party lines in debate
## 
### Andrew Tilton 
Rather than serving up
drinks, the Coffee House
played host to a lively partisan
political debate last night.
The College Republicans and
Stanford Democrats faced off
over party leadership ability in
the '90s, domestic political is
sues and foreign policy.
Democrat Scott Christopher
son led off, stressing his party's
values and commitment to
greater government involve
ment and attacking the Reagan
record on the economy.
Keith Rabois and John Ab
bott, president of the College
Republicans, explained the
"fundamental principles" of the
Republican party, emphasizing
the empowerment of the indi
vidual. Rabois condemned drug
use and voiced his opposition
to the Democratic notion that
"a homosexual lifestyle is as
valid as a heterosexual one."
In the area of domestic pol
itics, the Republicans com
menced by encouraging
government deregulation,
praising small businessmen for
their role in the economy's
growth and attacking the high
unemployment and inflation of
the years under former Presi
dent Carter.
For the Democrats, Christop
herson laid emphasis on envi

ronmental policies for the
future and the lack of such pol
icies during the Reagan era.
Foreign policy arguments
centered on the recent events
in Europe and on comparison
of U.S. and Soviet military
forces. Rabois credited the
GOP for the reforms in East
ern Europe, saying that they
were "not a surprise" to the
Republicans.
Democrat Dmitri Melhorn
criticized the supposed causal
relation of military buildup un
der the Republicans and com
munist downfall in Eastern
Europe, and stressed the Dem
ocrats' desire for disarmament
and "respect for other na
tions."
The room became more
raucous after the orderly
debate as questions from the
audience focused on the issues
of gun control and the war on
drugs.
The representatives of both
parties felt they were able to
get their main points across,
although they said they would
have liked to have more time.
Moderator David Brady, pro
fessor of political science, said
he felt that each side was bas
ically "preaching to its ad
herents," although the debate
certainly gave a clear impres
sion of the standpoints of the
respective parties.
