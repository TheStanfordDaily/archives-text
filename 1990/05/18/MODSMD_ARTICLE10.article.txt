# Responding to rape's reality
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
The reality of rape on campus
has never escaped Christine
Griffith, assistant director of
graduate residences.
As the informal leader of the
Rape Response Group — about
six faculty and staff members
who wish to offer support serv
ices to sexual assault victims —
Griffith says student efforts
have helped her group in trying
to achieve its purpose.
The grass-roots response
team was formed about 10 years
ago at Counseling and Psycho
logical Services, according to
Griffith, who joined it in 1987.
However, it has been"in exis
tence and not in existence" de
pending on the amount of
faculty and staff interest.
When first formed, the group
sought to provide immediate re
sponse services — such as ac
companying a victim to the
hospital and assisting in easing

her immediate academic and fi
nancial worries.
However, no one ever utilized
these resources, according to
Griffith. Because sexual assault
is one of the most underreported
crimes in the country, the group
was concerned that it was not
taking the best approach to the
problem.
The research efforts of the
group and other rape education
groups revealed that sexual as
sault victims who report the
crime often do not report it for
weeks or months afterward.
Moreover, because victims suf
fer devastation that persists for
long periods of time, they need
more than just short-term sup
port.
Griffith said the group has
recently been called upon for
support of such victims who
have waited for a time before
reporting.
The six members of the all
woman group come from the Of
fice of Student Affairs, CAPS

and the Bechtel International
Center, among other places.
Griffith said the group hopes to
recruit both men and students.
She says she was asked to
join the group because of her
skills in "crisis intervention"
and remains with it because of
its rewards.
Griffith, who is a member of
the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, said Stanford
lags behind other universities
in establishing rape response
protocols.
"Certainly there are other
universities who have, much
earlier than us ... made
available to students ways to en
ter into the. . . healing process,"
she said.
Griffith pointed to the results
of the Rape Education Project's
1988 survey on sexual assault
on campus as the impetus for
University investigation of the
problem as well as a help to her
group in solidifying its approach
to the problem.
