# 60 women start new sorority

### Jennifer Paley 
Sixty women at Stanford have
started a local sorority, Chi Alpha
Pi, and hope to gain affiliation
with a national sorority next year.
In order for Chi Alpha Pi to be
recognized as a national sorority,
it must first be approved by Stan
ford's Intersorority Council. The
ISC currently has no formal policy
for the formation of new sorori
ties.
According to freshman Michelle
Ho, co-president of Chi Alpha Pi,
the sorority might issue an invi
tation to the national sorority Chi
Omega if the ISC recognizes the
group as the eighth sorority on
campus.
The members of Chi Alpha Pi
are in the process of writing a
100-page proposal to the ISC ex
plaining their constitution,
bylaws and philanthropy pro
grams and giving information
about their officers.
After a trial period next fall
quarter, the ISC will decide if it
will recognize the new sorority.

"The earliest time that we will
vote is at the end of fall or be
ginning of winter quarter," said
ISC President Erin Scalley.
Although Scalley, a junior, said
she would "rather not comment"
on her reaction to the possible
expansion of the sorority system,
many of the existing sororities
said they are receptive to the idea.
"We're all 100 percent for it,"
Pi Beta Phi president Kari Mur
nane, a senior, said.
"Because this year was unguar
anteed a lot of women were
burned," she said, referring to the
change this year to an unguaran
teed bid system. "But it's exciting
that these women are taking the
initiative (to form a new
sorority)."
Members of Chi Alpha Pi said
they decided to form their own
sorority because they were dis
satisfied with the Rush process.
"The process was superficial,"
Chi Alpha Pi social chair Justine
Mattera, a freshman, said. "I
realize the advantages of organ
ized social events, though, and

hope that [we] will be successful,"
she added.
Ho said the group's decision to
form a new sorority is not a sign
of "sour grapes."
Although many sororities have
been supportive, members of the
Gamma Phi Beta sorority, which
did not fill its quota this year,
feel threatened.
"We're in support of any group
forming an organization, espe
cially if it will strengthen the
Greek system, but I am concerned
that the system will be
saturated," Gamma Phi Beta
President Fiona Nelson explained.
Gamma Phi Beta considered
merging with Chi Alpha Pi, ac
cording to Nelson. However,
members of Chi Alpha Pi refused,
preferring to become the founders
of a new national sorority at Stan
ford, Ho said.
According to fraternal affairs
adviser Michael Hughes, "If [Chi
Alpha Pi] has a successful track
record and is approved by the ISC,
I'm sure that a national sorority
will colonize them."
