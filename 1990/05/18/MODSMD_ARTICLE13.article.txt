Outlaw broadcast postponed
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Plans to beam
pro-democracy messages to China from a radio
ship have been postponed indefinitely, an or
ganizer said yesterday, because Taiwan refused
to allow a powerful transmitter through cus
toms.
"We are anti-Communist but we cannot vi
olate international law," government spokes
man Shaw Yu-ming said. "This government
does not support the broadcasting plans and
we cannot help them install the transmitters."
Without the transmitter sent from France,
it would be impossible to proceed with the
broadcasts, said Christophe Nick, an organizer
of the Goddess of Democracy ship.
China has accused Taiwan of secretly help
ing the Goddess of Democracy and has refused
to rule out the use of force to stop the broad
casts.
The 1,200-ton vessel, which left France on
March 17, arrived in the northern port of
Keelung on Sunday to take on provisions
before sailing into international waters to
broadcast toward Communist China.
Philippines wants more dollars
MANILA, Philippines (AP)— U.S. and
Philippine negotiators yesterday ended a
fourth day of talks on the future of American
bases in the Philippines without reporting any
breakthroughs.
The two sides disagree on whether the
United States failed to make full aid payments,
and on when the facilities would actually have
to close if the two sides cannot reach a lease
agreement.
After this round of talks, which is to end
today the two sides could either begin formal
negotiations on a new pact or start working
on a schedule for closing the bases. Their lease
expires in September 1991.
The installations include Clark Air Base,
the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller
facilities.
The two sides met into the evening yesterday
to try to resolve a Philippine claim that the
United States owes $222 million in back pay
ments for use of the bases.
AIDS tames Zambian sex
LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)— Tribal chiefs
worried about the spread of AIDS have banned
the ancient custom of widows and widowers
having sex with a relative of their late spouse
to "cleanse" themselves.
Chiefs in Chikankata and Monze districts,
about 80 miles south of Lusaka, ordered a
halt to the practice after AIDS educators
visited, a health ministry spokesman said yes
terday.
Under the custom, a widow would have sex
with one of her husband's brothers, and a
widower would arrange a sexual encounter
with one of his late wife's relatives.
The tradition contributed to the spread of
AIDS, "especially, of course, if a spouse died
from AIDS," said the spokesman, who was
not identified.
In Africa, AIDS is mainly spread by heter
osexual contact and the use of contaminated
blood or medical equipment.
Sandinista strikes succeed
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — An esti
mated 150,000 government employees re
turned to work yesterday, ending a weeklong
strike that savaged Nicaragua's already
crippled economy and hamstrung the new,
U.S.-backed administration.
The huge walkouts were a victory for the
leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front,
which engineered the strikes beginning last
Friday to press for job security and big pay
increases.
