CAMILLA COVE, Texas (AP) -
Floodwaters from a rain-swollen lake
gushed into the Trinity River at a
record rate yesterday, but many resi
dents downstream stayed home to
guard against looters despite evacua
tion warnings.
"At this point, we're still hanging
in there," said Eugene Hanson, who
owns a small store near the base of
Lake Livingston Dam and has been
watching rising waters get closer and
closer.
Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana and
Oklahoma also coped with continued
flooding or braced for more.
Oklahoma's governor dispatched Na
tional Guard soldiers to help get feed
to stranded cattle. A Louisiana farmer
began evacuating his 4,000 alligators
to higher ground. And St. Louis
prepared for floods from the Missis
sippi River.
Rivers in Arkansas continued reced
ing following record floods last week,
and southern Illinois residents cleaned
up from floods Wednesday night.
Flooding has caused at least 13
deaths in Texas and one in Oklahoma
in the past three weeks, and millions
of dollars in damage. In Texas, 33
counties have been declared eligible
for disaster aid due to storms and
flooding.
Floodwaters from Lake Livingston,
about 75 miles northeast of Houston,
are expected to inundate more than
200 square miles along the Trinity
River.
An aerial inspection yesterday de
termined that, except for scattered
subdivisions, most of the damage was
confined to pasture.
