# Pentagon says to Congress: I want my HDTV
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)- A Pentagon
task force is recommending that the
government spend $100 million a year
to develop advanced video systems
such as high-definition TV, a pub
lished report said yesterday.
That would be a 10-fold increase
over what the Pentagon agency
charged with HDTV development
sought and received this year for ad
vanced TV research.
The High-Resolution Systems Task
Force has forwarded the $100 million
recommendation to the Defense Sci

ence Board, which will discuss the pro
posal next week, according to the
Washington-based trade publication
Communications Daily.
A task force spokeswoman, Susan
Hansen, said yesterday she would not
confirm the $100 million figure. She
said the task force recommendations
were under review and would be con
sidered by the board.
Proponents of HDTV, which prom
ises motion-picture-quality images and
compact-disc-quality sound, say it
could help re-energize the U.S.

electronics and computer industries.
But others say HDTV won't be a
popular consumer item until well into
the next century.
The Pentagon foresees military ap
plications in radar and other display
type technologies and has funded a
modest research program through
DAPRA, its Defense Advanced Projects
Research Agency, which also funds the
Sematech semiconductor consortium.
White House officials such as
Budget Director Richard Darman re
portedly have opposed efforts to single

out private industries for government
aid.
Europe Eureka consortium has
spent between $300 million and $400
million on HDTV, while Japan has
spent about $1 billion.
DAPRA spent $5 million in 1989 to
fund research into high-definition dis
plays, spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi said
yesterday. The agency requested and
received $10 million for 1990 and has
requested $12 million for 1991, she
said.
