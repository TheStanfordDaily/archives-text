Turtles need TEDS
WASHINGTON (AP)- A panel
said yesterday that between 11,000
and 44,000 sea turtles drown an
nually in shrimp nets and recom
mended that virtually all trawlers be
required to use turtle-excluder
devices for most of each year.
Incidental capture and drowning
in shrimp trawler nets "accounts for
more deaths than all other human
activities combined" among the five
endangered species of sea turtles that
live in the U.S. waters, the National
Research Council committee said.
The report said the turtles drown
when they are caught in a funnel

shaped net commonly dragged behind
boats to capture shrimp that live near
the ocean floor.

stacks of three legs that enable it to
traverse uneven terrain.
William L. Whittaker, one of three

heading the project, said the robot

moves like a cross-country skier.
Robots using Ambler technology
are slated for use in a series of mec
hanized missions to Mars, Lavery
said.
