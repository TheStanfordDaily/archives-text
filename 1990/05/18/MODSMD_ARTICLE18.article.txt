IT JUST DOESN'T make any
sense.
Just a few weeks ago, the
Athletics Department was citing
the need to unify student cheering
at football games as a reason to
support its new cheerleading pro
gram. Now, the department has
taken the student section it wants
so badly to be vocal and moved
the majority farther away from the
game.
When Athletic Director Andy
Geiger says that "they're good
seats, just fine seats," perhaps he
means it in the sense of "just barely
fine" seats, since student seating
that used to stretch along the track
from beyond the 50-yard line down
through the end zone is now com
pressed into four sections that
start at the 35-yard line and get
worse.
One could speculate endlessly on
why the Athletics Department
chose to move the students —

clashes between the student and
public sections, the potential
proceeds of opening up hundreds
of 50-yard-line seats for full-price
ticketing or perhaps the desire to
force the student section to become
more unified. There are plenty of
excuses.
What is outrageous, however, is
the fact that Geiger made the de
cision to move the students last
fall, without consulting, advising
or warning the student body.
As was the case with the cutting
of field hockey, wrestling and the
other "varsity III" sports, and the
department's ignoring the lack of
student support for the cheer
leaders, the Athletics Department
has once again proved it has little
or no concern for the student body.
So, with snubbed students
paying more for inferior tickets,
Geiger says"It will make it happier
for everyone."
You make the call.
