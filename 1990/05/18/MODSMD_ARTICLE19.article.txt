Dear new fraternal
affairs adviser,
Welcome to a very diffi
cult job.
When you take office, you will
have a great opportunity to make
some big changes in Stanford's
Greek system, including increasing
the organizations' intellectual con
tributions to this campus. And you
will have the advantage of the com
munity spirit your predecessor
spoke of so often.
But you will not have 60 to 70
percent of the student body as your
predecessor envisioned.
Instead, you will be dealing with
a system still dealing with prob
lems stemming from alcohol, ho
mophobia, acquaintance rape and
the need to sponsor responsible
parties.

And therefore you will be forced
into the role of both an advocate
of the Greek system and its dis
ciplinarian.
Yet sometimes discipline is nec
essary to move toward a better
system, and you should not be
afraid to use the tools at your dis
posal.
It's good that you will come from
another position at this University.
You will know the community's
traditions, attitudes and problems.
That will make it easier as you
try to make the Greek system more
of an intellectual center which par
ticipates more in the community.
We don't know how well you will
be able to accomplish these goals,
but it certainly doesn't hurt to try.
We wish you the best of luck
next year.
