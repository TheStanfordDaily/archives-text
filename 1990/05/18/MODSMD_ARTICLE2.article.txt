# Poster attacks alleged political ties of Chang
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
An anonymous poster distrib
uted around campus yesterday ac
cuses Gordon Chang, who has
been offered a tenured professor
ship at Stanford, of being a leader
of a secretive Marxist-Leninist or
ganization, the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle.
Declaring in bold letters, "He's
a slime," the poster attacks Chang
as an " 'overseas Chinese*
muckety-muck in a Maoist party."
It goes on to detail Chang's alleged
involvement in a Maoist organi
zation named I Wor Kuen that
merged with another group to
form the League.
Chang could not be reached last
night for comment.
Chang resigned last year from
a lectureship at Stanford because
of a highly charged dispute over
professorial appointments.
Several student organizations
worked last year to gain a tenure
track professorship for Chang,
who taught Stanford's only class
in Asian-American studies. He
took a tenure-track position in the
history department of UC-Irvine.
