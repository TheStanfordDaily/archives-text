# Poster attacks alleged political ties of Chang
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
An anonymous poster distrib
uted around campus yesterday ac
cuses Gordon Chang, who has
been offered a tenured professor
ship at Stanford, of being a leader
of a secretive Marxist-Leninist or
ganization, the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle.
Declaring in bold letters, "He's
a slime," the poster attacks Chang
as an " 'overseas Chinese*
muckety-muck in a Maoist party."
It goes on to detail Chang's alleged
involvement in a Maoist organi
zation named I Wor Kuen that
merged with another group to
form the League.
Chang could not be reached last
night for comment.
Chang resigned last year from
a lectureship at Stanford because
of a highly charged dispute over
professorial appointments.
Several student organizations
worked last year to gain a tenure
track professorship for Chang,
who taught Stanford's only class
in Asian-American studies. He
took a tenure-track position in the
history department of UC-Irvine.
The poster is modeled after
posters recently distributed by the
Stanford Central American Action
Network that labeled students,
staff and faculty members as sub
versives as part of SCAAN's guer
rilla theater project to raise
awareness about death squads in
Central America.
A number of students involved
in the Asian-American commu
nity released a statement late last
night attacking the poster. The
poster "represents a return to the
McCarthyist tactics that wrongly
limited academic freedom in the
19505," the statement said.
"Teachers should be judged by
their academics, not through their
supposed political life," according
to the statement. The statement
was signed by a number of officers
in the Asian American Student
Association, including chair Ed
ward Morimoto and former chair
Joseph Park.
No group had claimed respon
sibility for the posters as of late
yesterday.
But the wording of the poster
is very similar to a paper titled
"Maoism Down on the Farm"
written by Tom Terrell, a former
employee of the Recycling Center
who has researched the League
and other leftist organizations for
a number of years. Although once
sympathetic to Marxist ideology,
he has since become staunchly
anti-communist.
The paper details the involve
ment of the League at Stanford,
naming a number of students and
staff members as members of the
League.
Terrell visited the Daily offices
Wednesday night requesting back
issues of the paper. The photo
graph of Chang appearing on the
poster was taken by a Daily pho
tographer, and it has appeared
with numerous Daily articles dur
ing the last year.
An individual fitting Terrell's
general description was spotted
hanging the posters by several
people, including Nan Bentley, a

History Department administra
tor. Chaparral editor David Hyatt
also saw a man fitting Terrell's
description distributing the
posters.
Terrell could not be reached last
night for comment.
The accusations play upon "a
lot of racist stereotypes ... of
Asians being sneaky, subversive
and manipulative," according to
Elsa Tsutaoka, office manager of
the Asian American Activities

Center.
The accusations against Chang
are "really unfortunate because
we're right in the middle of trying
to convince him to come here,"
said Jean Kim, director of grad
uate residences.
"I think this is really low," said
economics graduate student
Masao Suzuki, who has been ac
tive in the Asian American Stu
dent Association's attempt to get
a tenured professor position.


Copies of the above flier were distributed around campus yesterday.
The flier attacks Gordon Chang, who has been offered a tenure-track
position at Stanford.
