Recall petition is necessary for a legitimate election

AS SOME READERS may know,
Students United for Fair Elec
tions (SUFE) is circulating a
petition asking for the recall of next
year's Council of Presidents and a new
election between Four Our Future and
A Clean Slate. I am writing to explain
why we feel a recall is necessary and
why we hope students will support us
and sign the petition.
ASSU Bylaws require a winning
slate to receive 50 percent of all votes
cast to take office. The real issue
comes down to whether the write-in
votes are real votes or not.
Two main arguments have emerged
to support discarding them; however,
we feel that both are flawed. Elections
Commissioner Steve Krauss's compari
sion of the votes to improperly marked
ballots is wrong; the reason you don't
count improperly marked ballots is
because you can't figure out what they

mean.
It should be quite clear to all what a
vote for the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles means — it's not improperly
marked at all.
It has also been argued that a vote
for a fictional character is a "joke" and
thus can't be counted. However, this
argument is also wrong. A write-in
vote for Bart Simpson says only that
the voter thinks having no senator at
all would be an improvement on
having the current senators in office.
It may be that some readers would
agree with this position. Nowhere in
the election laws does it say that
write-in votes have to be limited to
eligible candidates. (There is a bylaw
stating that only eligible candidates
can take office, however.)
The idea that a student cannot vote
for anyone he or she wants to is made

up and is not to be found anywhere in
the rules for running elections.
We can find no valid reason under
the ASSU Bylaws for discounting the
write-in votes. We believe a) the votes
should have counted; b) the Bylaws
call for a run-off election; c) such
election has not been held and there
fore d) the current COP slate has not
been properly elected. As such, we
want them recalled and a proper
runoff election held.
Senator Louis Jackson, in a speech
to the Senate, referred to the support
for the fictitious candidates as a "per
version of democracy." But we don't
see how the desire to hold an election
can possibly be a perversion of democ
racy.
All we want to do is to hold the
run-off election the Bylaws call for to
ensure that the slate that takes office
has the support of a mtyority of stu-

dents.
That's why we're trying to get the
COP recalled — to ensure that which
ever slate does take office has the
m£yority of votes that the Bylaws
require. We are not seeking to unelect
Four Our Future — we would be
perfectly happy if they were to get a
.mfigority in the runoff election. They
would then have legitimately won a
fair election, which is all we are ask
ing.
We ask all students to sign the
petition when asked and to vote for
the slate of their preference in the
runoff election. Then, when one slate
captures 50 percent of the vote, that
slate will truly have a mandate to
govern, and the ugliness of the last
election will finally be behind us.
