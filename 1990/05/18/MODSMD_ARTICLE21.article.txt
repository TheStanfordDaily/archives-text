# Extension will move traffic directly to destination

Some points in The Daily's May 17
story about the proposed Sand Hill
Road extension deserve to be clarified
or corrected.
First, I was quoted as "arguing that
there is no bottleneck at the intersec
tion of Sand Hill and Santa Cruz." I
would never make such a claim, for
obviously there is a bottleneck at that
point.
What I did tell your reporter is that
there is "not even a bottleneck" at the
El Camino end, for the road now ends
at Arboretum Road, where traffic fil
ters through to El Camino by way of

campus roads and the Shopping Center
parking lot.
In short, the vehicles that will use
the extension already are reaching El
Camino via circuitous routes. One of
the msyor purposes of the extension is
to funnel that traffic directly to its
destination, where it will simply turn
right or left, just as it does now at
several streets in Menlo Park, at the
Shopping Center entrance, at Palm
Drive and at Galvez Street.
In 1972, planning consultant John
Blayney of San Francisco told the Palo
Alto City Council that: "Considering
the complexity and importance of facil
ities along the road (a regional shop
ping center, a regional medical center,
a professional center and Palo Alto's
largest housing complex — the Oak
Creek Apartments), the access is abom
inable. I can't think of any other situ
ation in the Bay Area where that
amount of activity has been concern -

trated with such poor access."
That statement has even greater
validity today. The situation can be
corrected by a road extension that
would provide mayor benefits while
doing minimal harm.
