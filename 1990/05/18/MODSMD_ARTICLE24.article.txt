## University of the Absurd 
### 
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV IS visit
ing, huh? I guess that makes
sense: our school color is red,
we're also having economic troubles and
our leading political party calls itself "The
People's Platform" but doesn't have a
plurality of support.
Pretty much Moscow with sunshine
here on the Farm.
On the other hand, it still seems a
touch weird — about as weird as every
thing else here at the real-life theatrical
production I call "The University of the
Absurd."
The Stars:
Ex-Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes: Sad but true, Stanford's answer
to Dan Quayle is taking his final bow.
This guy placed seven — count 'em —
seven Thursday Personals in the May 3
Daily. For only $25 Hughes got to use
the words "awesome" and "psyched" in
print.
Although he has been called "the fra
ternity system's own personal idiot
savant," (60 or 70 percent. Definitely.
D-Definitely 70 percent Greek) he's ac
tually returning to southern California
"to finish his doctorate in higher educa
tion work and adult training."
Golly Mike, what's the thesis on —
better blender drinks or those wacky se
cret handshakes?
Associate Dean of Residential Educa
tion Alice Supton: Brought to you by the
Ministry of Truth, Supton routinely
denies that Res Ed has an agenda. (I
hear groups of prospective resident as
sistants have burst out laughing when

she's said this.) Having an agenda isn't
necessarily a bad thing, but being dis
honest about it is.
Res Ed, of all offices, should be open
to differences of opinion. Supton likes to
emphasize "programming" over commu
nity building as the educational tool of
choice (for example, six of 10 RA evalu
ation questions focus on programming,
one focuses on communal activities).
It's got an eerie sort of ring to it, the
word "programming," doesn't it? Like
we're all about to be hooked up to Macs
or something.
I find that these staccato bursts of
wisdom tend to be divisive, as they em
phasize differences even before a commu
nity of people who trust one another has
been built. Res Ed has a noble goal, but
it is failing to achieve it by neglecting to
see that common ground must be a
springboard to discussing differences;
metaphorically, you're more likely to start
a fire with a gentle flame than with a
firecracker.
Athletics Director Andy Geiger: Wow.
We have a top-10 University, teams that
are perennial powerhouses and an Ath
letics Department that is distinctly sep
arate from the University so that it may
be run more like a business and less like
a non-profit starry-eyed college (cough,
cough) — and yet this department is in
the red.
Does anyone else see something wrong
with this picture?
Geiger cut funding to programs "going
nowhere," thus treating students as if
we were a horde of unproductive employ

ees. It's like being fired — which doesn't
make any sense because he's supposed
to be working for us.
The Chorus:
Cheerleaders 11 — Andy's Revenge: Put
up your hands! Get on your feet! We've
just sold your student seat! If the alumni
still can't see, we'll move you to double-Z!
Phi Delts: If Hughes is an idiot savant
these guys have perfected the art of being
sans savant. How do you get yourselves
put on probation three times in four
years? And in the same month each time?
This is either a case of recidivism olr
extreme punctuality.
A Capella Groups: All four million of
them. Please, somebody stop them before
Stanford simply caves in and assigns you
to one.
The Set:
The Tresidder Elevator: The elevator,
located just outside the Coffee House
patio entrance, has two floors it serves
— and two buttons. Where's the sense in
this? No wonder we need to streamline
this University . . .
I guess this is intermission. I'm inter
ested to see how this show ends — that
is, if it ends.

Jon Sherman graduated with a degree
in English last quarter. His column ap
