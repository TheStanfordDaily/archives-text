Organizers of the Stanford
Women's Conference had plans to
obliterate Adolf Hitler at the War
Fair.
In an effort to raise funds for
defense, the women sold 10-cent
stamps which corresponded to
hundreds of little boxes marked
out on a 36-square-foot portrait
of der Fuehrer. The purchase of
each stamp enabled the buyer to
black out one box until the face
of the Nazi leader could no longer
be seen.
Creative fundraising is close to
my heart. Perhaps we could do
something like that for Mikhail
Gorbachev's impending visit.
Maybe we could sell democracy
stamps or German flags to put on
a map of Eastern Europe.

Over 150 Wilbur Hall freshmen
signed a petition expressing dis
appointment with life in Wilbur
and asking for an evaluation of
the entire freshman residence
policy.
The petition called for an im
partial committee to "consider the
broad questions of freshman res
idence, including integration of
freshman and upperclass
dormitories and coeducational
housing."
I was once a freshman in Wil
bur. But I don't understand why
it has such a bad reputation. Let's
try a visualization experiment in
order to better understand what
motivated those freshmen from
not so far back. Close your eyes
and be one with the universe. Now
picture yourself as a naive fresh
man. As you harness your new
found energy, imagine in your
mind's eye (or if you live in Wilbur
just open your eyes) living in a
closet in a concrete barrack with
a completely random roommate
and only male freshmen all
around. Finally, feel your energy
and expectations dissipate after
eating some gross food after first

quarter finals. Now wasn't that a
great trip?

The Board of Trustees approved
four coeducational "demonstra
tion houses" and simultaneously
established a midnight limit on
all open house hours.

The action provided for the con
version of two houses each in Wil
bur and Stern Halls into
integrated coed residences, each
with a distinct academic program.
In addition, Branner Hall was to
become a coed freshman dor
mitory.
And the Trustees said, let the
campus mix. And the campus
mixed. And all became good. And
the students socialized. But, they
gave us a modified Branner to
keep us humble.

The Lag Mess monster previ
ously discovered in Lake Lagunita
was found to fit the description
of a lost 16-year-old Mississippi
alligator named Sam.
Sam had been missing for some
time from the outdoor biology lab
of Fremont High School in Sun
nyvale. A search party for the al
ligator was organized for later
that week. Sam was described as
not vicious and had never bitten
anybody.
What would Sam think now if
he saw his aquatic haven turned
into a fertile field of weeds and
thorny things? And if he wasn't
happy, I'd be pretty scared.
