# Nationwide organization active here, students say

The League of Revolutionary Struggle
(Marxist-Leninist) is a highly secretive nation
wide organization that focuses on people of
color groups for its mass support, as well as
student and labor movements.
League doctrine states that the United
States is composed of various oppressed na
tions, including the black nation in the South,
the Chicano nation in the Southwest and the
Hawaiian nation. One of the primary goals of
the League is the liberation of these "oppressed
nations" under a socialist state.
The organization has been active at Stanford
for several years, recruiting students into its
membership, according to a number of stu
dents who say they were recruited by the
League. The League has recruited students
within the various student of color organiza
tions on campus, according to sources in each
community who say they have been recruited.
However, most students within these organ
izations have no knowledge of the League or
its presence at Stanford. Even many of those
in leadership positions within
these groups said they had no
knowledge of the League.
The recruitment of individuals
for membership is highly secre
tive, in many cases to the point
that people are not aware they
are being recruited, according to
a number of Stanford students
who say they were recruited by
the League.
Activists who fit the criterion
of being "politically correct" ac
cording to League standards are
invited to various "study groups"
in which League members con
verse on subjects of socialism,
labor or people of color move
ments and the League.
After recruits go through a se
ries of study groups and demon
strate their commitment to the
cause, they may be asked to join
the League, depending in large
part on their political beliefs, ac
cording to sources. Official mem
bership in the League comes only
after applicants write an essay on
why they want to join the League.
The League operates under the
principles of democratic
centralism, which denotes a
decision-making process in which
decisions are made at the top of
the hierarchy and relayed down,
according to a student who said
he was recruited.
It is democratic to the extent
that individual members can pass
their input up the hierarchy, but
once a decision is made by the
Central Committee, the top body
of the League, there can be no
dissent, according to the student.

The League demonstrates con
tempt for government law en
forcement organizations such as
the Central Intelligence Agency,
the Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion and the police.
It also denounces the "legal and
extralegal political repression and
violence" of groups such as the
Ku Klux Klan and Neo-Nazis, ac
cording to a 1986 book published
by the League titled "Peace, Jus
tice, Equality and Socialism." The
book, which explains the agenda
of the League, is sometimes given
to recruits for more information.
Although it is a nationwide or
ganization with power in cities
like New York and Boston, the
League has most of its power con
centrated in California, particu
larly at various universities. In
addition to its presence at Stan
ford, the League has different
degrees of influence at the UC-
Berkeley, UCLA, UC-Santa Cruz,
San Jose State and San Francisco
State, as well as a number of other
schools.
According to a number of stu
dents who were recruited, the
League exercises much influence
in statewide student organizations
such as Statewide MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group; the
African/Black Statewide Student
Alliance, which recently held it
annual meeting at Stanford; and
the Asian Pacific Islander Student
Union.
League members also report
edly have some influence in the
California Progressive Student Al
liance and the United States Stu
dent Alliance, of which the ASSU
is a member. The ASSU budgeted
$6,100 this year for student travel
expenses to the annual United

States Student Alliance Confer
ence and other conferences.
The League is also reported to
have considerable power in
various labor movements, includ
ing the Watsonville cannery move
ment, which just completed a
successful strike, and the United
Farm Workers.
Membership in the League is
generally secretive because of the
disfavor of Marxist groups in the
United States. Although certain
members openly admit their con
nections to the League, especially
those in leadership positions,
most people at the lower levels
do not admit membership and are
forbidden from revealing others
as members.
The League publishes Unity
newspaper, written in both Eng
lish and Spanish, which is
commonly found on campus. The
League also publishes a monthly
magazine, the Forward Journal
on Socialist Thought, which con
tains theoretical essays on Marx
ist topics.
In addition, the League puts out
Black Nation magazine, which is
written for an Afro-American au
dience, and East Wind for Asian-
Americans.
Leaders of the League include
William Gallegos, the editor of
Unity newspaper; Carl Davidson,
a former leader of Students for a
Democratic Society who joined the
League after his Communist
Party (Marxist-Leninist) became
defunct in 1981; and Amiri
Baraka, a popular revolutionary
poet who sits on the Central Com
mittee of the League.
Baraka spoke at Stanford Law
School during the Educational
Rights Conference in 1986 and

has spoken at least two other
times on campus since the late
19605. Baraka was involved in the
original founding of the Black
Student Union on campus in
1968.
Baraka is also the editor of
Black Nation and an associate
professor of African studies at the
State University of New York at
Stony Brook.
Baraka could not be reached for
comment.
The League was founded in
1978 from the merger of two
smaller Maoist groups, the Au
gust 29 Movement and I Wor
Kuen. I Wor Kuen was a predom
inantly Asian organization that
was based in New York's
Chinatown and later in San Fran
cisco.
The League gained added mo
mentum with the incorporation
of the Revolutionary Communist
League (Marxist-Leninist-Mao
Zedong Thought) into its ranks
in early 1980.
Many of the individual mem
bers of the League are Maoists,
including Baraka, although the
organization is not officially
Maoist, according to Harvey
Klehr, a professor of political sci
ence at Emory University and an
expert on the American political
Left.
"They came out of the Maoist
movement originally," Klehr said.
The League denounces both the
United States and the Soviet
Union, while looking to China as
the best example of a socialist so
ciety. The Soviet Union, although
it originally succeeded by moving
the socialist revolution forward,
"unfortunately degenerated into
an expansionist superpower" in

the 19505, according to the 1986
book.
However, "the Chinese Revolu
tion liberated one-fourth of hu
manity from imperialism and
today continues to inspire
revolutionary-minded people the
world over," the publication
states.
Although it has generally sup
ported the actions of the Chinese
government, the League sharply
criticized China for the massacre
of pro-democracy students at
Tiananmen Square in Bering last
year, saying that "the vast
majority of the students involved
are patriotic and believe in
socialism."
In a special editorial bulletin in
Unity last June, the League con
demned the "actions of the Chi
nese government because it is not
in the spirit of socialism, nor in
the spirit of the Chinese Revolu
tion and the Chinese Communist
Party."
Solidarity with other Marxist-
Leninist organizations has been
one of the League's primary goals
to combat the historical tensions
between American radical groups.
Despite its goal of unity with
other leftist groups, the League
has attacked the Communist
Party USA for being "revisionist"
and for having "betrayed the Afro-
American people's revolutionary
struggle," according to its 1986
book.
