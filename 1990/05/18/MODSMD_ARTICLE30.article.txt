# The 						Bug takes us out to the ball game to answer a foul question
## 
### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
Who is it that has the job of coming
up with product names? I've always
wanted to see Arnold Schwarzenegger do
a commercial for Peter Pan Peanut But
ter. And what the hell is "Rice-a-Roni"?
Or how about Constant Comment Tea
"for gabby old ladies who just won't shut
up"? Ah, yes and my favorite car, the
new Ford Probe — I think I'd check my
seat twice before sitting down. Or the
AMC Matador, "a car that drives itself
when you're drunk."
Dear Bug,
When watching baseball, I notice how
often searing line drives are hit into foul
territory and into the seats. Has anybody
been seriously hurt or killed by any of

them ? Does the batter or team incur any
liability when it happens 1 ?
— Willie Mays
I'm very happy I don't have to pay for
my own long distance calls when I'm at
this job — so I started with calling my
mother. The most recent accident at a
ball game occurred in Seattle early this
season when a 9-year-old girl was nailed
by a line drive. She apparently broke her
jaw and cheekbone. The lady in Seattle
sure didn't talk much when I was asking
these questions, so I told her I was a
lawyer before I asked who had hit the
ball. The ball was hit by Darnell Coles.
No fans have ever been killed, and
apparently serious injuries aren't fre
quent. I did hear a rumor that a fan was
recently tagged at a Houston game, but
research only revealed that parking is $3
at the Astrodome and tours are conducted

daily.
When I asked a woman at the Oakland
Coliseum whom I could sue if I were
nailed by a stray baseball, she kept mut
tering, "Um, that's hard to say." As a
matter of fact, she said that four times
in 68 seconds. If you really wanted to
file a civil suit, the courts would decide
whether the player, the team or the fan
was responsible. "Um, that's hard to say."
To sum it up, if you're a player and
you get hit by a ball, you're out — some
times out cold. If you're a fan and you
get hit, find a good lawyer and sue every
body in the stadium.
Dear Bug,
Are those little white and yellow flowers
growing in front of Am Stud Camomile,
and if so, is it safe to make tea out of
them?
— Peter Rabbit's Mother

Camomile, otherwise known as
Mayweed, dog-fennel, Anthemis Cotula,
Matricaria Maritima, Myrrh or Franken
cense Stein, is a member of the sunflower
family After pilfering a few flowers from
the front lawn of Am Stud, I headed
immediately to my grandmother's house
to do some pilfering of flower books. The
description of Camomile is this:
Leaves finely divided; stalked heads at
branch tips; disk conic; rays white or
yellow, heads V2 to 1 in. wide, rays 10
to 20; grows in fields; hallucenogenie
when smoked in small amounts.
This flower appears to match that des
cription. So I gathered a few more and
dried and ground them before slipping
them in my roommate's tea. Let me just
say it's probably a better idea to just go
to the store and buy a package of Lipton.
