## Graham serves notice to nation, wins singles crown McGrath-Whitlinger win doubles in all-Card final 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Enter
ing the NCAA championships,
sophomore Debbie Graham had a
statement to make. Graham
wanted everyone to know that
while teammates Sandra Birch
and Meredith McGrath are
worthy of all the accolades they
have received, she was tired of
not being mentioned along with
them.

Cardinal wins singles
and doubles titles

Instead of taking her case to
reporters, she took it to court.
And in her closing statement last
night, Graham defeated Florida's
Nicole Arendt 6-3, 6-3 to capture
the national singles crown. In so
doing, Graham served notice, vol
leyed notice and groundstroked
notice that she is not just ready
to step up and join the elite of
the college game — she had al
ready arrived.
Graham followed up the victory
with her second straight appear
ance in the NCAA doubles final.
Had she and Birch won the match,
Graham would have been the first
player to capture the team, singles
and doubles titles in the same
year. Instead, McGrath and Teri
Whitlinger scored a 4-6, 7-5, 6-2
triumph and made Stanford the
first school to net the triple crown
in a single season.
Of course, it wasn't the doubles
that Graham was gunning for.
Winning the singles was her ticket
to the respect she sought. "That's
what got me ready for this tour
nament," Graham said. "It's been
my motivating force: whenever
someone talks about Stanford ten
nis, it's always Sandra, who won
the nationals in 1989 and
Meredith, who is the number one
ranked player, and I'm sitting
there at number three (singles).
"I'm the player in the middle
of the lineup and no one ever
cares. I wanted to prove to every
one that Stanford is not just their

Debbie Graham's streak to
the NCAA singles title:
d. Iwalani McCalla, UCLA, 6-2, 6-3.
d. Jolene Watanabe, UNLV, 6-1, 6-3.
d. Stacey Schefflin, Georgia, 6-4, 6-0.
d. Ginger Helgeson, Pepperdine, 6-2, 7-6 (11-9).
d. Sandra Birch, Stanford, 7-5, 6-4.
d. Nicole Arendt, Florida, 6-3, 6-3.

one and two players."
For those in attendance, it was
an open-and-shut case. Graham
displayed an ability to win points
with her serve, at the net and
from the baseline in a match that
was really not close.
Graham opened with a strong
game in which she displayed a
willingness to come in behind her
serve and become the aggressor.
Arendt knotted things at 1-1 with
a strong service game of her own.
The next two games were essen
tially similar and resulted in a
2-2 score.
In the fifth game, Graham
fought off four break points and
went to deuce seven times before
holding serve. It was really the
only opening she allowed Arendt
all night and the Lady Gator
junior failed to take advantage.
The first turning point occurred
with Arendt serving down 3-4.
She pounded a terrific serve and
Graham answered with a better
return. Another unplayable
return and a perfect topspin lob
gave Graham three break points.
She needed just one before going
ahead 5-3.
Graham then served out the set
at love and was well on her way.
"The first set was so important
to me," she said. "I started off
the match and I don't remember
a time where I've ever been so
nervous. I felt she was really ner
vous in the beginning, too.
"I knew if I played a very ag
gressive game, if I kept the pres
sure on her, and worked her
nerves a little bit ... that would
give me that extra edge."
When Arendt failed to hold

serve in the first game of the
second set after leading 40-15, it
was clear that the emotional lift
the hometown crowd tried to pro
vide was not going to be enough.
Graham captured the next two
games and was serving up 3-0.
Arendt tried to attack the net,
but Graham lobbed her for 15-0.
On the next point, Graham
punched a backhand volley just
out of Arendt's reach to make it
30-0. Graham won the next two
points on overhead winners to
take a commanding 4-0 lead.
Arendt fought back to 4-2
before Graham again broke her
at love to earn an opportunity to
serve for the match. She then
played a shaky game and Arendt
broke her back to make it 5-3. "I
have a tendency to get up some
times and then choke. I start
looking ahead," Graham said.
But she quickly gathered her
self together. With Arendt serving,
Graham seized every opportunity
to come in and was hovering over
the net when she put away the
match.
A baseliner all her life, Graham
has been focusing on playing bet
ter at the net and the results were
readily apparent. Her stellar play
inside the service line along with
a willingness to come in even after
being passed were too much for
Arendt to handle.
"It's such a key factor," Graham
said. "If I had been playing like
I had last year, afraid to get into
the net, there's no way I could've
finished off Nicole in two sets."
Stanford Asst. Coach Lele
Forood told Graham that after

Arendt lost the first set, she would
try to attack more often. "Lele
kept saying, 'You have to want to
come in more because she's going
to want to come in more,' "
Graham said.
Arendt did try, but was unable
to muster a comeback. She needed
to receive intravenous fluids after
her semifinal victory Wednesday
and had a very draining week.
Still, she was not hiding behind
anything.
"I was tired, but I tried not to
think about it," Arendt said. "I
would say [fatigue] carried over,
but I was still going to fight. She
was tired, too. She played just as
much as I did. I'm not trying to
make any excuses. She played
smart and that's all I'm going to
say."
The doubles final was a
rematch of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championship match. In that

meeting three weeks ago,
McGrath and Whitlinger handled
Birch and Graham easily 6-4, 6-1.
Yesterday was another story al
together. Though Graham was
broken twice in the opening set,
she and Birch still won in 6-4.
When McGrath failed to hold
serve at 1-0 in the second, Birch
and Graham seemed to be on their
way.
Graham held to push her team
up 3-0. Whitlinger and Birch each
held to make it 4-1, Birch-
Graham. But McGrath-
Whitlinger did not compile a 25-0
record entering the doubles final
by rolling over and playing dead.
They clawed their way back by
breaking Graham twice more.
Whitlinger served her second
straight love game at 6-5 to give
her team the second set. The
decider was no contest as
McGrath and Whitlinger were

never broken en route to a 6-2
victory.
"Meredith and I were a little
nervous after being undefeated
the whole year," Whitlinger said.
But they turned it around when
they realized their goal of becom
ing NCAA champions was slipping
out of reach. Said McGrath: "Why
have one loss. ..."
"... where it erases out whole
dominant season," Whitlinger
chimed in. The victory capped a
year in which the tandem routed
the No. 2- through No. 6-ranked
teams in straight sets.
Card notes
Graham last was defeated on Feb.
9 at the Rolex National Indoors. Since
that 6-2, 6-2 loss to Brigham Young's
Mary Beth Young, Graham has
reeled off 35 straight victories. In that
span, she was only forced to a third
set four times


Kat Keasey — Daily file
Sophomore Debbie Graham was "just" the No. 3 singles player for Stanford going into the 1990
NCAA individual championships. When the dust had settled, however, Graham had taken all comers
to win the singles crown. It was the Cardinal's second consecutive individual title (junior Sandra
Birch won the 1989 championship).
