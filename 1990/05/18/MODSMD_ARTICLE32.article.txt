Todd Lichti, considered by
many to be the greatest bas
ketball player in school his
tory, underwent surgery on a
broken foot yesterday after
surviving a one-car auto acci
dent that killed the driver.
Lichti suffered multiple
lacerations and broke a bone I
in his right foot in the acci-'
dent, which occurred early yes-

terday morning. He is currently at Rose Med
ical Center in Denver, where he was flown
after the accident.
The 1989 graduate was returning to his
parent's home in Concord, Calif., after com
pleting his rookie season with the Denver Nug
gets. Lichti graduated as the all-time leading
scorer in Stanford history and led the Cardinal
to its first NCAA Tournament berth in 47
years a year ago.
The Nevada Highway Patrol said Lichti was
a passenger in the car that ran off Interstate
80, 30 miles east of Lovelock, Nev., and over
turned in the median at about 7:15 a.m.
The driver, Kristin Gravrock, 23, of Bel
levue, Wash., was pronounced dead at the
scene. Troopers said Lichti's face and hands
were covered with blood from multiple cuts
and he complained of pain in his foot.
Investigating officers said Gravrock appar
ently fell asleep. Her car ran off the right side
of the highway then slid into the median and
overturned when she overcorrected.
A Nuggets spokesman said Lichti sustained
an open fracture to the fifth metatarsal bone
of his right foot. An open fracture occurs when
the bone has broken the skin.
Dr. Steven Traina performed the surgery
Thursday afternoon at Rose Medical Center,
removing dead tissue from the foot and at
tempting to reduce the risk of infection.
Officials said it was too early to determine
the severity of the injury or whether it might
be career-threatening.
Lichti was the Nuggets' first-round draft
pick in the 1989 NBA draft and was the 15th
player selected overall. He played in 79 games
for the Nuggets this past season, starting four.
He averaged 8.0 points per game.
The Nuggets made the NBA playoffs but
were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in
three straight games in the first round two
weeks ago. In the opener against the Spurs
Lichti had the best game of his professional
career, scoring 22 points, grabbing 13 rebounds
and handing out eight assists.
At Stanford he scored 2,336 points and
pulled down 652 rebounds, eighth on the
career list. Additionally, his total of 304 assists
is third all-time.
