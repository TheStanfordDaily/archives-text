# Healthy men's netters go for 'three-peat'
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
He's back. They're still here. And,
on paper, the 1990 Stanford men's ten
nis team that heads into the NCAA
Championships today in Palm Desert,
Calif, is the best squad in the country,
perhaps the best men's college team
ever.
That's right, ever.
With Jonathan Stark back in both
the singles and the doubles lineup,
any chink in the Cardinal's armor has
vanished. Before a stress fracture in
his left foot sidelined him April 17,
Stark was playing undeniably the best
tennis in the country. Stark has yet
to lose a dual meet match at No. 1
singles and, despite the recent iryury,
is presently ranked No. 2 by the Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate Rankings.
Stanford is seeded second behind un
defeated Tennessee in the tournament
and will meet the winner of the Okla
homa State-Utah match Saturday at
8 a.m. If the Cardinal wins Saturday,
it would then square off against either
Texas or Pepperdine.
"(The first match] is the most im
portant right now," Gould said. "You
can't play the second match unless
you win the first, and it is especially
important that some of guys who were
injured respond."
That would be Stark, primarily. Im
mediately before his departure, the
freshman recorded a 6-1, 6-3 thrashing
of No. 4-ranked Byron Black of USC
and a 6-3, 6-1 clobbering of No. 12-
ranked Bent-Ove Pederson of Califor
nia. Stark's dual meet singles record
presently stands at 18-0.
In addition, Stark teams with fresh
man classmate Jared Palmer to form
the No. 2-ranked doubles combination
in the country. Stark and Palmer, who
won last year's juniors title, Wimble
don also have yet to be defeated in
dual meet action.
Like Stark, Palmer was injured for
much of the season, undergoing two
knee operations since January. How
ever, the freshman, who will play in
either the No. 2 or No. 3 singles spot,
now appears to be at 100 percent. Pal
mer played No. 1 singles for the Car
dinal in its last two matches.
When both Palmer and Stark were
in the lineup, the Cardinal was unde
feated and unanimously ranked No. 1
in the country.
"John and Jared are holding up ex
tremely well," Coach Dick Gould said.
"Of course, what they need is match
toughness. But you're talking about
two guys who are great competitors.
If anyone can go into a big match
after having been ii\jured, it's those
two. I'd be very surprised if they don't

do extremly well," Gould added.
But, even without Palmer and Stark,
two-time defending national champion
Stanford still boasts one of the top
teams in the country.
1989 All-America Alex O'Brien, who
presently is ranked No. 14 in the coun
try, has once again stepped up his
level of play for the NCAAs. O'Brien,
a sophomore, probably will play in the
No. 2 or No. 3 singles spot. In Stan
ford's last match against California,
O'Brien avenged an earlier loss to
Doug Eisenman, whipping the Bear's
No. 2 player 6-2, 6-3.
O'Brien will team with Jason Yee
in the No. 3 doubles spot. Yee and
O'Brien are the 1990 Pacific 10 Con
ference doubles champions and, yes,
they are playing No. 3.
Perhaps O'Brien's biggest asset is
his ability to play the big matches as
well as anyone in the country. "Alex
played his best tennis of the year at
the NCAAs last year," Gould said.
Filling out the singles lineup will be
senior Jeff Cathrall, junior Glenn
Solomon and freshman Alexis
Hombrecher.
Hombrecher and Cathrall will play
No. 2 doubles. The combination is un
defeated in dual meet action at 9-0.
Doubles specialist Dan Turbow also
will make the trip to Palm Desert.
Gould, who earlier called this team
perhaps the best in the past two
decades," admitted that he was pleased
with how the Cardinal is looking. "In
a lot of ways, we are in good shape,"
he said. "If someone is going to beat
us. they are going to have to play very
well.
"We look forward to this tournament
the whole year."
The team tournament will conclude
Tuesday The NCAA Individuals will
begin Wednesday.
Stark, Palmer and O'Brien will all
compete in the individual singles
event In addition, the teams of Stark
and Palmer, Cathrall and Hombrecher
and O'Brien and Yee will square off
in the doubles competition.

Going For Another Double
With the NCAA team title the women's tennis team captured
on Sunday, the Cardinal has a chance to win both the men's
and women's team championships in the same year for an
unprecedented fourth time, and the third time in a row.
