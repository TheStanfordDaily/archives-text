# 'The other outfielder' gains spotlight
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Game time at Sunken Diamond,
and the Stanford baseball team
races on to the field. "Ladies and
gentlemen, will you please
rise. ..
As the Star-Spangled Banner
plays over the loudspeaker, the
Cardinal players stand at atten
tion. In shallow center field, the
team's three outfielders — side
by-side, hats in hands — look at
the flag.
On the right is Paul Carey, one
of the greatest players in Stanford
history. He holds the school
records for hits, doubles, home
runs, RBI, at bats and games
played. He's been a legend ever
since his dramatic grand-slam
home run kept the Cardinal alive
in the 1987 College World Series.
He's a superstar, a team leader,
one of the best the school has
ever seen.
In the middle is Jeff Ham
monds. In only his first year, he's
already established himself as a
great. He owns the longest hitting
streak in Stanford history, he
soon will break the school record
for steals, and he leads the team
in hitting. This is a man who who
turned down in excess of a quarter
of a million dollars
to come to Stanford. By the time
he leaves, he may well be remem
bered as a Stanford legend.
On the left. . .is Ryan Turner.
Hey, how would you feel?
Some other players and their
egos might have a problem
sharing the outfield with two guys

who make anyone suffer by com
parison, but Turner couldn't care
less. "Those guys are very, very
talented," Turner says. "It's kind
of disheartening in a way, but I
realize I just have to stay within
my own limits. I'm a good player,
but I'm not a Jeff Hammonds or
a Paul Carey. I can still contribute
in my own way."
Aw, c'mon. It doesn't bother
you that the 1990 Stanford media
guide contains the words "With
Paul Carey in right and freshman
Jeff Hammonds in center, Stan
ford can claim to have two-thirds
of a 'dream' outfield"? Not even
a little?
"Well, I haven't done anything
to earn recognition, I don't
think," Turner laughs. "I can't
say I've been ignored."
Good point. Turner had all of
three hits in his first two seasons,
which added up to a not-so
spectacular .094 career batting
average. He'd started a whole
seven games in two years.
This year, though, has been just
a tad different, so you'd think
Turner would get a little recogni
tion now and then. Answer this:
Who has a .343 (!) average at
the plate, third-best on the team?
Who, three weeks ago at Ari
zona State, had the game-winning
hit in the 12th inning against the
Sun Devils' undefeated pitcher
Sean Rees?
Who, two weeks ago at Califor
nia, hit a two-out, ninth-inning
home run to send the game to
extra innings?
Who, among all the Cardinal
starters, has yet to commit an

error this season?
Very good. All in all, it's been
quite the fun year for the junior
from San Jose — and for Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess.
"I'm pleasantly surprised and
really excited for him," Marquess
says."It doesn't always work out
that the guys who work hard and
are dedicated get the chance to
do well: a lot of times it's the
guys who have more natural tal
ent that get to play.
"In Ryan's case, his hard work
and everything have really paid
off," Marquess says. "He's had the
patience to not play much his first
two years and still come back
strong this season. That says a
lot to the other players: that you
can be patient and still get to play.
I'm real proud of him."
Of course, Turner's hard work,
dedication and patience haven't

been the only factors contributing
to his strong play. He had to pay
his dues. He had to suffer just a
little to get where he is.
He had to spend a summer play
ing baseball in Liberal, Kansas.
Where? "Middle of nowhere,"
Turner says."It was a typical
small, midwestern town, farm
oriented. The nearest city was
about three hours away.
"I actually wanted that,"
Turner says, "because I didn't
want any distractions. I wanted
to work hard on baseball and im
prove my skills. It's the ideal place
for that, because there aren't
many distractions at all."
Of course, Turner didn't just
come across a team in a small
town on the Oklahoma border by

Junior Ryan Tlirner brushed up on his swing last summer in Kansas,
and it has paid dividends for the Cardinal left-fielder this year.
