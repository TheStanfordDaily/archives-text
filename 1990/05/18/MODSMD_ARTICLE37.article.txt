# Track team looking to follow Odita's winning ways at Pac-10s

The Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship heptathlon was held in typical
Seattle wind and rain and cold. As a
result, scores were expected to be low.
But Cardinal senior Peggy Odita wasn't
bothered.
She won it anyway.
Odita brought home Stanford's first
Pac-10 individual championship in two
years Tuesday, and her teammates are
hoping she is starting a trend that will
continue this weekend. Although the
bulk of the Pac-10 Championships are
tomorrow and Sunday, both demanding
multi-event competitions — the hep
tathlon and decathlon — were held
Monday and Tuesday to give the
athletes a rest before the individual
events begin.
"It wasn't a spectacular hep, but I'll
take it," said Odita, whose weather
worn score of 5280 was about 150 points
below her personal record. Of course,
everyone else's scores were down as
well, including Odita's teammate Jen
Jauquet, who just missed the points
with seventh place.
Senior D.D. Harris also finished a dis
appointing seventh in the decathlon.
For this weekend's events, Stanford
will send 31 athletes. Although only 24

have qualified per se, the conference
allows each school at least one repre
sentative per event.
Here is a rundown of a few Cardinal
athletes to look for:
Chryste Gaines — The sophomore
sprinter is the overwhelming favorite
to win the 100-meter dash. She should
finish at least second in the 200.
Marcus Hickerson — After improving
steadily through the season, including
two consecutive personal-record
weekends recently, Hickerson has placed
himself among the Pac-10's long
jumping elite.
The Cardinal women horizontal
jumpers — Although American triple
jump record holder Sheila Hudson of

California has reserved first place for
herself in both of these events, a Car
dinal trio promises to rack up some
serious points for Stanford. Jackie Ed
wards, Venessa Henlon and Alysia Hub
bard will all compete in the triple jump,
with the latter two also competing in
the long jump.
The men's middle distance corps —
After recording two of the nation's top
times in the 4xBoo- and 4x1500-meter
relays at the Texas Relays, this Cardinal
quintet — Dave Strang, Bill Crowley,
Alex Accetta, Eric Mastalir and Mark
Mastalir — has dominated in the indi
vidual events at those distances. Strang
is the favorite to win the 800, while
Crowley should win the 1500. All five
promise to garner points for Stanford.
Assistant Coach Scott Chisam said
that he expects the men to finish fifth
in team competition, while the women
should finish fourth or fifth.
Coach Brooks Johnson was also op
timistic. "All we can ask is that they
maintain the same level of competitive
effort they've been giving all season,"
he said. "This is the most competitive
team I've ever had at Stanford. It's been
a fantastic year. The only difference now
is, we're like vultures. We can't kill
anyone, but if someone dies we're gonna
gobble them up."
