# Crew teams looking for pair of Pac-10 titles
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Stanford women's crew coach
John Davies and men's coach Ken
Dreyfuss are taking different ap
proaches to the same goal. Both
men hope their respective crews
will bring home the gold from this
weekend's Pacific Ten Conference
rowing championships at Lake
Natoma in Sacramento, but while
Dreyfuss leaves today, Davies and
his team have been up north since
Wednesday.
"I wanted them to get a feel of
the water, and get away from the
hustle and bustle of campus,"
Davies said. "We need to get used
to the mood of the place, get a
feel for the conditions of the
course."
Dreyfuss, on the other hand,
feels that it is better not to create
overt pressure about this week
end's races.
"It is most comfortable to do
what we do everyday," he said. "I
think it is important for the guys
to sleep in their own beds Thurs
day, and just get up and go."
If things go right, the argument
about which approach is better
could turn out to be moot. With

almost two weeks to prepare for
the Pac-10's after the Big Row,
both the men and women have
improved their races. The coaches
agree that this year's varsity races
have the potential to be very com
petitive, and with the men seeded
second and the women seeded
third, both Stanford boats should
be in the thick of things.
"This is the first race all season
that we are really rested for,"
Davies said. "I really anticipate
the best race of the season, [the
teaml is really rowing well. We
will be going our fastest."
"We are definitly rowing a little
better," Dreyfuss said. "[The
teaml is sharpening up and has

been attacking practices. They are
really coming together."
Though the men's boat remains
unchanged, the women have
moved around due to the return
of Katherine Van Uum. Van Uum,
out almost all year with back in
juries, will take over the seventh
seat. The senior attended the open
weight National Team selection
camp over the summer, and
brings new strength and experi
ence to the boat.
"Katherine is not quite as fit
as the others, but she adds
dynamism. She is very strong, and
100 percent healthy," Davies said.
The men and women will be
sending varsity, J.V., novice and
freshmen boats to compete this
weekend. Though the Pac-10 uses
this weekend's races for its cham
pionships, the event is actually
the Pacific Coast Rowing Cham
pionships.
The Championships will feature
close to 1,600 athletes, represent
ing 57 teams from 31 schools.
Both the men's and women's var
sity eight winners receive all ex
pense paid trips to the National
Championships.
The format has teams racing
in heats Saturday morning, with

the finals on Sunday. Stanford
should qualify for the finals, and
has the potential to win it all.
"We are capable of winning,"
Davies said. "Fate is primarily in
our hands â€” the competition is
good, but so are we. We need to
take the initiative and make
things happen instead of having
things happen to us."
The men find themselves
seeded second, primarily because
of their upset of California at the
Big Row two weeks ago. Unlike
the women, the men find them
selves broken up into three heats,
with the top two teams in each
heat making it to the finals.
The Cardinal should advance to
the final where in all likelihood
it will meet top-seeded Washing
ton, third-seeded California, and
fourth-ranked, three-time defend
ing champion UCLA.
Like the women's race, Dreyfuss
sees the men's Championships as
being up for grabs.
"Any one of the top four seeds
could be the champion," Dreyfuss
said. "The crew that can go to
the course and block out the pres
sure and surroundings, and per
form the race they are capable of
will win."
