# Faculty Senate votes to reorganize non-tenure research line
## 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
In an attempt to prevent University
faculty from splitting into parallel teach
ing and research lines and still retain
hiring flexibility, the Faculty Senate has
reorganized the non-tenure research line.
After much discussion at its meeting
yesterday, the senate unanimously voted
to eliminate the line of promotion in
research professorships and to create a
new post of "assistant professor of re
search."
In the past, associate research profes
sors who remained in good academic
standing earned promotion to full
professorship "indue course," according

to Provost James Rosse. The new policy,
however, abolishes the "path of promo
tion" between the titles, Rosse explained
in a telephone interview last night.
One proposal to eliminate the post of
associate professor of research was
defeated in a roll call vote, 13-17, with
two abstentions.
During discussion on the proposals,
many senators expressed concerns that
they may make it more difficult to attract
good research professors to Stanford.
With the new policy, an assistant or
associate professor of research can move
up to a higher rank only if there is an
opening for such a position, said Rosse.
In addition, the candidate will not receive
an automatic promotion but must apply

for the position in a competitive process.
Rosse said the proposals will mainly
have an impact on the School of Medicine
and the School and Engineering, which
employ many research professors. Also,
the science departments in the School of
Humanities and Sciences will be some
what affected.
The rulings will probably get "mixed

reviews" from the Medical School, accord
ing to Charlotte Jacobs, a senior associate
dean for education and student affairs at
the Medical School.
Jacobs speculated that it might be more
difficult to attract top people because
they will face so many barriers to pro
motions.
On the other hand, she said, the newly

created post of assistant professor of re
search will add to the departments'
flexibility in hiring faculty members that
will fill specific research needs.
During the discussion, many senators
expressed concerns that unless promotion
policy is changed, a second "parallel fac
ulty" of research professors may develop.
The new policy makes the research pro
fessor hierarchy — assistant professor,
associate professor and professor —
identical to that of teaching professors.
In other business, the senate unani
mously approved proposals for two new
academic programs: an honors program
in ethics and society and a graduate
degree program in molecular and cellular
physiology.
