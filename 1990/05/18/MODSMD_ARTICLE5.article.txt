# Symposium celebrates birthday of Malcolm X
## 
### Denise Morris 
The philosophy of Malcolm X,
that people of color must achieve
liberation "by any means neces
sary," was echoed last night at a
symposium celebrating his
birthday.
Oba T'Shaka and Maulana
Karenga, authorities on Malcolm
X, interpreted his vision for people
of color in achieving human
rights.
Traditionally, the Stanford
community has paid its respects
to Malcolm one day each year. For
the first time, Malcolm X Day has
been extended to Malcolm X Week.
The symposium featured a dra
matic reading by students of the
Shule Mandela Academy and
keynote speeches by T'Shaka and
Karenga.
The academy students declared,
"When we honor Malcolm, we
honor ourselves and the dignity
and righteousness of our struggle
for freedom."
They denounced claims that
Lincoln freed the slaves and that
white people enlightened the
"dark continent."
T'Shaka reiterated the empha
sis of redefining history. As chair
of the Black Studies Department
at San Francisco State and author
of "The Political Legacy of Mal
colm X," he urged people of color
to reject the Eurocentric view of
history.
He supported the Cultures,
Ideas and Values debate, declaring
that "history did not begin in
Greece or Rome. Western civiliza
tion went straight from barbarism
to savagery without civilization."
Karenga, chair of the Black
Studies Department at California
State University in Long Beach
and creator of Kwanzaa, an
African-American holiday, asked,
"What is a classic, stripped of all
its racial significance? A creative
work of art. Classics are not ex
clusive."
There is a nationwide push to
change "outdated" curriculum,
T'Shaka said.
Citing such evidence as the
crisis of the black family and con
tinued racial tension, T'Shaka

proclaimed that "[people of color]
are at war." Part of our education,
he said, is to struggle for libera
tion," by any means necessary."
T'Shaka said Malcolm X has
been misunderstood because of
the distortion of history recorded
through the Eurocentric point of
view. One of the main tenets of
Malcolm's philosophy was to
define "black" from within, not
through the eyes of others or as
Webster defines it: the absence of
white, he added.
"Racism," Karenga declared, "is
not an attitude, but an ability to
turn prejudice and hatred into
public policy."
Perhaps Malcolm's most contro
versial statement was that white
people are devils, although he
later recanted. This comment does
not apply to whites' skin color,
but to a history of evil behavior,
said Karenga. "The European has

been the embodiment of historical
evil," he said,
Malcolm X's three-step program
for liberation of people of color is
"wake up, clean up, stand up."
One must have courage to main
tain the struggle, but one must
first work from internal strength.
Discipline, moral grounding and
spiritual renewal therefore com
pose the "clean up" step.
Finally, Malcolm X believed that
people of color would have to "go
back to come forward." By that
he meant history has to be
reevaluated in order to realize
one's roots and identity.
