# There to listen during all hours of the night

When recent graduate Janet
Mercer's phone rings, it could be
one of her friends hoping to chat
— or it could be a suicidal stu
dent.
Mercer is one of five live-ins
at the Bridge, the student peer
counseling center. Live-ins an
swer calls at all hours of the day
and night.
"Beinjj a live-in is like parent
training," Mercer says. "You can
never leave the phone alone —
at night it makes noises, and
you have to get up and take care
of it."
From midnight until 9 a.m.,
the students' most important
duty is to answer incoming calls.
Counselors are there to listen
and to validate the caller's
feelings. However, they never
give advice.
If the caller is the one to in
itiate a solution, "they are more

likely to follow through and more
likely to feel better," says junior
Alyson Giardini.
Live-ins rotate during the
night shift, with one "primary"
and one "secondary" counselor
being on call each night. The
"primary" handles most of the
counseling load, while the
"secondary" is there in case of
a simultaneous call or to give
support to the other live-in.
Although most calls are
related to stress from academics
or relationships, others are more
urgent.
Despite spending nights on call
each week, it is not easy to adjust
to having the phone ring in the
middle of the night, live-ins say.
Whenever there is a call, "you
jump through your skin," Giar
dini explains. "You never know
what it's going to be."
The worst possibility is that a
caller is potentially suicidal.

Junior Corey Booker and senior Chuck Bryant are two of the live-in counselors at the Bridge
who are on call at all hours.
In that event, a counselor must
"try to use everything you have
to try and talk the person out of
it," Mercer says.
During her two years at the
Bridge, Mercer has handled three
or four such cases, calling them
"kind of surreal, scary" in reflec
tion.
Despite their training and ex
perience, extreme crisis calls
remain disturbing even to these
longtime staffers. Live-ins empha
sized the importance of having
another person to talk to imme
diately after a difficult counsel.
Although each call remains con
fidential, live-ins can discuss the
generalities of a case with one
another and talk about their own
feelings and reactions.
"The Bridge is referred to by
many as an oasis or a refuge,"
says live-in Chuck Bryant. Yet for
these five counselors, it is often
difficult to separate home from
office. The refuge can, in Bryant's
view, become claustrophobic.
Instead of engaging in casual
conversations at home, the live
ins often have business to discuss,
Mercer says.
Each live-in receives a single
room at the Bridge as compensa
tion. Last year, the organization
fought hard to retain live-ins.
