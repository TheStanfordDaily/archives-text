# There to listen during all hours of the night

When recent graduate Janet
Mercer's phone rings, it could be
one of her friends hoping to chat
— or it could be a suicidal stu
dent.
Mercer is one of five live-ins
at the Bridge, the student peer
counseling center. Live-ins an
swer calls at all hours of the day
and night.
"Beinjj a live-in is like parent
training," Mercer says. "You can
never leave the phone alone —
at night it makes noises, and
you have to get up and take care
of it."
From midnight until 9 a.m.,
the students' most important
duty is to answer incoming calls.
Counselors are there to listen
and to validate the caller's
feelings. However, they never
give advice.
If the caller is the one to in
itiate a solution, "they are more

likely to follow through and more
likely to feel better," says junior
Alyson Giardini.
Live-ins rotate during the
night shift, with one "primary"
and one "secondary" counselor
being on call each night. The
"primary" handles most of the
counseling load, while the
"secondary" is there in case of
a simultaneous call or to give
support to the other live-in.
Although most calls are
related to stress from academics
or relationships, others are more
urgent.
Despite spending nights on call
each week, it is not easy to adjust
to having the phone ring in the
middle of the night, live-ins say.
Whenever there is a call, "you
jump through your skin," Giar
dini explains. "You never know
what it's going to be."
The worst possibility is that a
caller is potentially suicidal.
