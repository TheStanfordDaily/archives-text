# Special Olympics short on volunteers for weekend event

More than 200 mentally retarded athletes
from Santa Clara County are gearing up
for the swimming competition at the 14th
annual Stanford Special Olympics this Sun
day at deGuerre Pool.
A concern, according to Special
Olympics co-coordinator Steve Boom, is
whether enough students and community
members will volunteer to help the athletes
on the day of the event. Boom said more

than 300 volunteers are needed to be
"buddies" of the athletes and to offer ad
ministrative and coordinative assistance.
Volunteers can register at 7:45 a.m. Sun
day at deGuerre â€” even if they have neither
signed up nor attended this week's informa
tional meetings.
Boom said the Special Olympics have
been one of student volunteers' favorite
activities of the year.
The athletes have been drawn from the
Santa Clara County chapter of the National
Special Olympics. The athletes train under

coaches at Santa Clara University.
Twelve events, including a track and field
meet, soccer game and bowling tourna
ment, comprise the entire Olympic games.
Stanford traditionally hosts the swimming
event.
Ranging in age from 8 to 60 years old,
the athletes will compete at three levels.
At one extreme are those who are severely
mentally retarded, and at the other are
those who may attend school or hold jobs,
functioning at an almost normal level.
"All the hard work that the athletes put

into their training I look forward to seeing
nt the meet," said Lisa Guzzo, coach and
swimming events coordinator. "Often when
we practice, I don't get to see all that the
athletes are capable of doing, and suddenly
at the meet they show it. They do it."
Freshman Janet Evans, three-time
Olympic gold medalist in swimming, will
kick off this year's opening ceremonies with
a short welcome and will lead the athletes
in a warm-up. Last year, Andrew MofTe, a
