## Special athletes spend a day at de Guerre 
### Brooke Hart Staff writer 
Showers and cold weather did
little to dampen the spirits of the
athletes at the Special Olympics
swimming competition yesterday
at deGuerre Pool.
Ranging in age from 8 to 60
years old, nearly 200 mentally dis
abled athletes, joined by an even
greater number of volunteers,
cheered one another to the finish
line.
"This is what I dream about,"
said 14-year-old Travis Casper of

Nearly 200 mentally disabled athletes came to deGuerre Pool yesterday for the Special Olympics swimming
competition. The event has been held at Stanford 14 times.
San Jose. "Since I can't play sports like
my brother does, I do this and compete
against kids of my own ability. I love it."
Casper and his twin brother, a member
of his school's varsity baseball team, are
freshmen at Santa Teresa High School. In
his first Special Olympics swim meet yes
terday, Casper competed in the breast
stroke and backstroke races.
Students and community members
volunteered their time yesterday to serve
as "buddies" and event coordinators. Each
buddy spent the entire day with one special
athlete, orienting and encouraging her or
him before and after the race.
Lee DeßrofT, a graduate student, was the
buddy of 20-year-old Teresa Hammond of
Santa Clara. "Seeing her win is unimpor
tant," he said. "Seeing her interact is what
amazes me. She remembers everybody's
name. The way I see it, you could have a
child with problems, or you could have
Teresa."
The athletes are drawn from the Santa
Clara County chapter of the National Spe
cial Olympics. At one extreme are those
who are severely mentally disabled, and at
the other are those who may attend school
or hold jobs, functioning at an almost nor
mal level.
Twelve events, held at different times

during the year, comprise the entire Special
Olympic games. Yesterday Stanford hosted
its 14th Special Olympics swimming com
petition.
"It's just fun to be here," Casper said.
"Sure I like to win, but that's not why I'm
here." Casper was voted most inspirational
player of the Santa Teresa team at the
basketball tournament and track and field
meet of the Special Olympics held earlier
this year. He received first place in the
bowling competition, though he said the
soccer match, in which he received an
award for his skills, was his favorite.
A senior at Cupertino High School, Ham
mond is in her fifth year as a competitor
in the Special Olympics. After winning her
heat in the 15-meter kicking race yesterday,
she said, "I feel proud." One of the reasons
Hammond loves to participate is to cheer
on her friends, she said, including her
boyfriend of two years.
A "moonwalk," or inflatable trampoline
like enclosure, donated by the School of
Medicine, and music, including a perform
ance by the Stanford Band, entertained the
athletes on the lacrosse field. Local busi
nesses donated lunch for the athletes, vol
unteers and the athletes' families.
Most of the event's budget, however, was
funded by dorms, sororities and fraterni
ties.
"The people here get along so well, at
least as well as 'normal' people," said buddy
DeßrofT. "I haven't seen anyone upset all
day — everyone's smiling."
