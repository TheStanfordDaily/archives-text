# Police arrest 'the Stalker'
## 
### 
"I wanted to see how it felt to
make someone think they were
going to die," Mark Stillman re
portedly said after being arrested
in investigation of assault with a
deadly weapon early Friday.
Stillman's deadly weapon was
his car, which he deliberately
drove into the path of an oncom
ing vehicle, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Police have been looking for
Stillman, who graduated from
Stanford in 1982, for some time
in connection with the methodical
harassment of a female University
staff member. He would send the
woman "love letters," call her and
stalk her around campus, police
said. Police knew Stillman as "the
Stalker."
Friday's incident — apparently
unrelated to the harassment —
occurred on Junipero Serra Boul
evard at 4:30 a.m. There were no
injuries or damage, as the driver
of the vehicle Stillman tried to
hit was able to avoid a collision.
A police officer happened to be
driving behind Stillman at the
time of the near-collision.
