An article in Friday's Daily
about Gordon Chang, who has re
cently been offered a tenured
professorship at Stanford, may
have left readers with the wrong
impression about student de
mands for a tenured Asian-
American studies professor and
the ensuing search process.
Last year, students nailed on
University President Donald Ken
nedy's door several demands, in
cluding that Chang, then a lec
turer, be given tenure immedi
ately.
However, calls for an Asian-
American professorship made
after Chang left Stanford were not
necessarily intended for Chang.
Similarly, the ensuing search proc
ess for a professor in Asian-
American studies was a general
search and not directed toward
Chang in particular.
