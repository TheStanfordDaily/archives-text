Taiwan wants to improve ties
lAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — President Lee Teng
hui yesterday urged an end to hostilities with
China's Communist government and released
10 political prisoners to mark his inauguration.
It was the first time a Taiwan president
had publicly indicated a desire to move away
from the 40-year-old policy of the "three No's"
toward Beijing — no official contact, no ne
gotiations and no compromise.
Meanwhile, Lee's nomination of the nation's
only four-star general as premier continued to
spark protests yesterday. About 10,000 people,
including students and opposition party mem
bers, staged a noisy march through Taipei,
smashing windows and throwing eggs at offices
of the military and the ruling Nationalist
Party.

history.

amid all the difficulties that the violent ones
have placed upon us," said 43-year-old Cesar
