EL ALMENDRO, Nicaragua (AP)—
Contra commanders confirmed they
have suspended disarmament and said
they won't order their troops to put
down their weapons unless their safety
can be guaranteed.
A Contra representative had said
Saturday the rebels would continue
disarming under terms of an agree
ment with the government.
However, the No. 2 Contra com
mander said late that day the group
had ordered its forces to keep their
weapons.
"Demobilized fighters are not get
ting the treatment they deserve," said
Oscar Sovalbarro, the second-ranking
Contra commander, in an interview
with The Associated Press.
Sovalbarro, known as "Commander
Ruben," said demobilized Contras
were being harassed by Sandinistas
and weren't getting enough food, med
ical care and assistance to establish
themselves in civilian life.
Sovalbarro said the Sandinistas were
subverting President Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro's efforts at reconciliation.
"The government is sympathetic.
But it doesn't have any money, and
the Sandinistas are disobeying orders,"
he said.
He cited last week's civil service
strikes, which virtually paralyzed the
government, as an example. The public
employees' union is controlled by the
Sandinistas.
Sovalbarro spoke after a meeting of
the Contra high command at the
mayor's house in El Almendro, a vil
lage 110 miles southeast of Managua.
