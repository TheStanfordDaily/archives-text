Hubble takes photo
GREENBELT, Md. (AP) - NASA
engineers captured the "first light"
photograph yesterday of the Hubble
Space Telescope and a scientist said
the experts "were pleased as punch"
with the spectacular image.
A camera on the telescope clicked
its shutter twice beginning at 8:13
a.m. PDT and the images were
relayed to the ground more than two
hours later, giving astronomers their
first glimpses of the view from the
$1.5 billion telescope.
"It's quite an image. Fantastic,"

James Westphal, the principal scien
tist for the camera used in the first
photo exercise, said as one the photos
was displayed on a TV screen.
Westphal said the Hubble image
revealed a double star that was pre
viously unseen in ground-based pho
tographs taken at an observatory in
Chile.
'Wizard' leaps ahead
ANGELS CAMP, Calif. (AP) -
Help Mr. Wizard, a dripping one
pound amphibian with a soaring soul,
beat back a challenge by a trio of

African Goliath frogs to win the 1990
Jumping Frog Jubilee yesterday.
Wizard, owned by Gregg Jaschek
of Concord, Calif., leaped 19 feet, 3
inches, besting 72 other finalists in
the 62nd annual event that drew a
capacity crowd of 8,000 to this
Calaveras County hamlet.
"It was just luck. I've been trying
for 19 years and if I knew the secret
of winning I would have won long
before this," Jaschek said, kissing his
frog as friends poured champagne on
him.

Bombs miss Quayle
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Smoke bombs
and firecrackers were set off in the
lobby of a hotel yesterday, two hours
before Vice President Dan Quayle
was due to address a Jewish group.
Quayle hadn't arrived at the
Sheraton Centre hotel when the
devices were set off, said John Mul
ligan, a Fire Department spokesman.
There was nothing solid to link
the explosions to Quayle's visit, said
Special Agent Allan Cramer, a Secret
Service spokesman.
