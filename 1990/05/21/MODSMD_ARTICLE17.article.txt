## Unfinished business 
### 
AFTER NEARLY a month of
controversy, this year's
tumultuous ASSU election
may finally be drawing to a close.
Petitioners have acquired
enough signatures — more than
15 percent of the student body —
to require a recall Council of Presi
dents election in accordance with
the ASSU Constitution.
According to the Bylaws, the
ASSU Senate has the option to
postpone the election until fall
quarter next year, as the petition
was submitted within 35 days of
the end of the quarter.
But the recall election should be
held this quarter. It is time to put
all the election controversies be
hind us and get on with the busi
ness of governing.
If the recall election is
postponed, a good part of fall quar
ter — when the new COP should
be moving forward with its cam
paign promises — will be wasted
with more campaigning and elec
tion business. We need not make
this marathon election process any
longer.
Holding the election this quarter

does pose some risks. If "Four Our
Future" is recalled, there would
be no COP slate in office during
the summer, a critical time for the
slate to begin planning and imple
menting their goals.
The risk is not avoided, though,
if the election is postponed until
the fall. It would be ridiculous to
expect "Four Our Future" to work
diligently all summer knowing
that, come fall, they could lose
their positions; if recalled, all their
hard work would amount to noth
ing.
In addition, the start of a new
school year brings with it a crop
of new eligible voters, freshmen
who would be uniformed about this
year's election controversies.
And current seniors, who have
followed the election and know the
issues and the details, would lose
the chance to vote.
Because the proper procedure
was followed in requesting a recall
election, that election must be
held. And in order to put a timely
close to the events following this
year's COP race, it should be held
this quarter.
