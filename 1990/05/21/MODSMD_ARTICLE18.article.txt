# A 						thankless job
## 
### 
IT'S BEEN A long, hard journey
— and it's not over yet.
Elections Commissioner
Steve Krauss is still in the spot
light of an election that, under nor
mal circumstances, would have
ended long ago.
But Krauss has yet to complain.
He has come under fire from many
directions concerning his write-in
ruling, yet he continues to deal
fairly with both sides of the debate.
He has worked hard to remain im
partial in his duties and has
succeeded, with neither side accus
ing him of favoritism.

For months, Krauss has been
working toward a successful elec
tion outcome. Statistics show that
the election itself — especially com
puter voting — was a huge success
with voters.
But that is not what this year's
election, or the elections commis
sioner, will be remembered for. In
stead, the election will be marred
with memories of cartoon charac
ters and sit-ins.
Now that Krauss has been called
upon to hold a recall election, we
can only hope he will continue to
work hard at such a thankless job.
