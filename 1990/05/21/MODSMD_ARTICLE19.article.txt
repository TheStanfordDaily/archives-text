Tactics mocked by flier used seriously in imitation

WE ARE NOT now, nor have we
ever been, members of the
League of Revolutionary
Struggle, but we are members of the
Stanford Central America Action Net
work. It is our group whose Project
Awareness posters were recently im
itated by someone who anonymously
used the same format in a serious
campaign against Gordon Chang, a
history scholar whom Stanford has
offered a tenure-track professorship.
Project Awareness was intended to
graphically illustrate the brutal tactics
used by death squads linked to the
government of El Salvador. Now those

same tactics are being used here at
Stanford. And this time, it's real.
Terms such as "red-baiting" and
"McCarthyism" only describe one of
the many offensive aspects of the
poster's message — the anti-Asian
racism and patronizing attitude toward
the minority "dupes" of the league in
the United States are equally odious.
Most frightening to us, however, was
the format. Project Awareness posters
parodied those of Salvadoran fascists.
We deliberately used absurd arguments
(we accused a campus sorority of being
a SCAAN front group, for example) to
make our point.
The attack on Chang imitated our

flier to make a serious denunciation,
reproducing those very totalitarian
tactics by which the Salvadoran mili
tary terrorizes the people of El Sal
vador.
We are also deeply concerned about
The Daily's coverage of the whole
affair. Although The Daily's article was
critical of the flier, it was run side-by
side with a (much longer) expos6-style
piece on the league. This diverted
attention from the reactionary politics
of the flier and tacitly legitimized its
basic McCarthyist message.
The league article provided exactly
the response this kind of defamation
project hopes to elicit. The timing of

the two articles leave us wondering
about The Daily's position: was this a
sincere attempt to research the league,
or was it simple capitulation to a
smear campaign?
Let's not return to the ugly days of
the House Un-American Activities
Committee. For the sake of journalistic
ethics, The Daily should take more
care to differentiate between informing
the public and collaborating with hate
ful, red-baiting scare campaigns.
