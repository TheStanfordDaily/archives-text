# Budget cuts move one step closer to reality
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The budget-cutting process moved
into its final stages Friday, as individ
ual departments submitted their final
proposals to the budget repositioning
steering committee.
During the next two weeks, the com
mittee will examine about 30 proposals
to determine whether they meet the
targets assigned to each department.
In addition, the committee will
decide if the proposed cuts fulfill the
overall goals of streamlining the Uni
versity without placing too much
strain on any particular department.
Provost James Rosse said he
believed the proposed cuts would be
sufficient to meet the University's
overall goal of cutting $22 million.
The steering committee will also
consider the final reports of four Ac
tion Plans for Change task forces

which are looking at ways of reorganiz
ing parts of the University.
Following the preliminary recom
mendation of the task force on student
services, Rosse last week announced
the creation of the position of vice
president for student resources.
The other task forces' recommenda
tions deal with the possibility of reor
ganizing the library administration,
facilities management and the Office
of Human Resources, Rosse said.
Except in Human Resources, the
task forces' recommendations will
probably not have a dramatic imme
diate effect on the budget cuts, Rosse
said. The reorganization of Human Re
sources will be accompanied by a 30
percent budget cut, the largest of any
University department.
"We need to see balance across the
University" in the budget cuts so that
the "primary values of the institution
are retained," Rosse said.

Rosse also noted that Stanford's
existing layoff policy has been amended

to "maximize the
number of people who
get hired inside the
University." An out
placement service has
also been established
for people who are laid
off and are not hired
into another Univer
sity position.
The committee

plans to read through all of the budget
cut proposals several times before
making final decisions. The first nuyor
step will take place tomorrow, when
the steering committee will meet as a
whole to examine all of the cuts, Rosse
said.
Rosse said he expects the final de
cisions to be made about a week later.
The steering committee has been

divided into several teams, each of
which has been working with one or
more University departments through
out the process. As a result, the rec
ommendations will probably not come
as a total surprise to the committee,
Rosse said.
Rosse added that in most cases, the
recommendations will probably be fol
lowed, although he and University
President Donald Kennedy have
"promised to make sure that the bal
ance is preserved" between the Uni
versity's various priorities.
Members of the Offices of Affirma
tive Action, Employee Relations and
the General Counsel will also review
the proposals.
After the steering committee makes
its decisions, the final budget
repositioning proposal will be submit
ted to the Board of Trustees at its
June meeting.
