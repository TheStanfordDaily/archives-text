# The
						Bridge provides many useful services to Stanford students
## 
### 
The Bridge staff greatly appreciates
The Daily's interest in our organiza
tion. Unfortunately, we feel that the
May 18 article on the live-in counselors
under-represented the Bridge's func
tions and intentions. In order to clarify
this piece, we would like to emphasize
other important contributions which
the Bridge makes to the Stanford com
munity.
Although we do manage a 24-hour
counseling line, we are far more than
a crisis counseling service. We encour
age individuals who simply need a lis
tening ear to speak with us, not
merely those in desperate straits.
In addition, the article did not men
tion other crucial Bridge functions,
such as the sponsorship of support
groups like Body Image, Food and Self
Esteem, Alcoholics Anonymous and a
Coming Out Rap Group, among others.
We also provide extensive information
and referral services to the Bay Area.

Furthermore, our outreach program,
including relationship workshops, is
another avenue of support for Stanford
students. Also, more than 20 massage
workshops were presented by the
Bridge at various dorms last quarter.
Additionally, Psychology 167 A, the
peer counseling class sponsored by the
Bridge each quarter, not only trains
future Bridge staffers but also teaches
valuable listening skills to concerned
individuals.
We are a voluntary student organiza
tion and fund ourselves through the
annual Stanford Spring Faire held
during Mother's Day weekend.
An enthusiastic and supportive staff,
which includes live-ins, coordinators
and staffers, is 90 strong and hopes to
continue to expand and contribute to
the community's well-being. Most im
portantly, we do what we do because
we ei\joy it.
