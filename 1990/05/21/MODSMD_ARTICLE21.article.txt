# Spectator behavior was contradictory to spirit of march
## 
### 
Last Thursday Ann Simonton spoke
of society's rape culture, in which men
are conditioned to view women as pos
sessions and inferiors. Following the
speech, over 100 students participated
in a Take Back the Night March to
focus attention on women's fears of
rape at night.
Although such a march might not
seem necessary in our cozy, sheltered
campus, events that evening made
readily apparent the need for greater
sensitivity and awareness about issues
of sexual assault.
When walking to see Simonton
speak, several individuals were pre
sented with an ironic picture. Four
sorority pledges on hands and knees
were bowing to fraternity members
standing next to a fraternity banner
supporting the march.
Further, instead of participating in
the march, this fraternity chose to

have a party that was so loud it
drowned out the marchers' voices.
A second and more provocative inci
dent occurred later during the march.
Walking under the breezeway of
Paloma House, a small burning object
was thrown from a window toward the
crowd. Shouts from this same window
of "Freaks! Dykes! Women should be
pregnant!" further jarred the marchers.
We write this letter to display the
hypocrisy and disturbing attitudes on
this campus. We have not named the
specific people and organizations in
volved because we feel their insensitiv
ity to issues of rape is not limited to
them but is rather a campus-wide
problem.
Rape Awareness Week exists to allow
men and women to better understand
the issues at hand. We strongly encour
age everyone to discuss these matters
and attend future programs about
rape.
