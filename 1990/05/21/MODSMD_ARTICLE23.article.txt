## Goodbye to close friends

FINALS ARE MY least favorite part
of law school.
Insights into the obvious.
Actually, the whole two weeks are life
pared down to its simplest form. You eat,
you sleep, you eat. You study. You eat.
You exercise a little — by walking to
the refigerator. You eat. You take an ex
am. You watch four hours of soap operas
— eating the entire time — and then
you watch "Geraldo."
It's a mind-numbing experience. It's
that time when you remember that you
really did read (or at least were assigned
to read) almost every page of those four
1,200-page textbooks. And there are no
pictures.
For law students, studying consists
mainly of outlining the course. For me,
that means little more than recopying in
a legible form my class notes and any
stray thoughts I marked in the margin
of the text.
Why do we law students do outlines?
Because the law students before us did
outlines, and because some guy named
Gilbert's does outlines and many of us
used Gilbert's to get through the course
in the first place. For the uninitiated
who haven't been to the legal study aids
section of the bookstore — adjacent to
the computer shop — Gilbert's is sort of
like Cliffs Notes.
And then when we're done outlining,
we have to make indexes for our outlines,
highlight the really important parts of
our outlines and finally tab the really,
really important parts of our outlines for
easy access during the exam. Most of all,

this gives us something to do until it's
time to eat or sleep again.
So, as you can see, it's pretty easy to
block out the rest of the world during
this intense time with computer, books,
refrigerator, television and pillow.
But the rest of the world never seems
to have the courtesy to block itself out.
Last May, Tiananmen Square erupted.
Last December, the United States in
vaded Panama. This May, Jim Henson
died.
With all due respect to Sammy Davis
Jr., it was Jim Henson who helped shape
my childhood. (Not that I blame him for
how I turned out.)
He introduced me to a lot of friends.
When I was in first-grade art, I always
painted Sesame Street characters. Oscar
the Grouch was my favorite. I'm not sure
if it was the attitude or the absence of
neatness that attracted me.
I told my mother I wanted to grow up
to be just like Oscar. Some days she'd
tell you that I have. And she hasn't even
seen me or my room during finals week
at law school.
The last time I saw Sesame Street was
about six weeks ago when I was visiting
my brother and his family in Seattle.
Ernie is still fond of his rubber ducky,
the Bird is still Big, the Count is counting
up to the twenties and kids are still suc
cessfully being told how to get, how to
get to Sesame Street.
Jim Henson and his Muppets paint a
time of my life that I can recapture by
changing a channel. Of course, at this

time of the year, the educational content
of the program might be beyond my
cognitive capabilities. Hence, "Geraldo."
This finals week, I'll probably lose a
lot more than the creator of my childhood
friends. I'll lose the proximity of my law
school friends. When the last exam has
been written, when the last honor code
has been signed, we all jump on planes
for different destinations, and this time
we'll stay there come fall. At least I will.
Oh, wait a minute, I forgot about the
bar exam. Those of us who might possibly
want to practice law (three years of school
and we still have to practice?) in Cali
fornia have six weeks of review and then
the bar exam.
Thank God for the bar exam. The bar
exam as a bond between friends? Some
how, I don't think I'll remember the bar
exam as fondly as I do Sesame Street —
although I will remember the friends.
Right about now (if not about six
paragraphs ago), some of you have got
to be saying — is there a point to this?
Is there ever a point?
It's a mind-numbing experience.
