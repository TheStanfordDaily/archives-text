## Story stigmatized communities, lacked substantiation 
### 
FOR THE FIRST TIME in weeks,
I didn't read The Daily Friday
morning.
I just couldn't — not after looking
at the top-ranked stories about the
alleged presence of a Marxist-Leninist
group on campus, the League of
Revolutionary Struggle. It wasn't a
deliberate boycott of The Daily; it was
out of sheer amazement.
One story told of how a flier alleged
that Gordon Chang, a professor who
has been offered a position here, was
part of this covert group; the other
provided background on the group's
activities, according to an unspecified
number of unnamed sources who
claimed they had been recruited by the
group.
More or less, the story on the flier
itself seemed straightforward enough.
The one glaring problem with it was
an editorial decision. The story was
about members of the Asian commu
nity being upset about the flier, and
The Daily (I don't want to say 'we'
when I refer to The Daily for the rest
of this volume) printed the very same
flier in the paper, doing a much more
effective job of distributing it than its
creator could ever hope to.
Primarily, I was concerned about the
"sidebar" to the story — a sidebar
that was longer than the story itself.
Everything about it seemed tenuous

and hazy, with unnamed sources at
testing to the existence of a secretive
group that controls? shapes? manip
ulates? campus politics.
It said that the members belonged to
all the campus organizations of color,
and that no one really knows how they
work.
I have never before seen a story in
The Daily without a single named
source in it, and I hope to never again.
I have no idea why no one would come
forward with their identity. If students
are afraid of torture/harassment at the
hands of the League, then the story
should have said so.
Those unnamed sources should also
realize that they're making life worse
for themselves and others. Granted
that the League exists and is based on
intimidation, all League members
would have to do is threaten all those
who might have been "recruited" (to
give one example of an inflammatory
term in the story, reappearing with
alarming frequency.)
My experience reading the articles
was like the Brady Bunch episode
where Bobby had that nightmare,
remembering time and time again that
"Mom always said not to play ball in
the house."
I couldn't believe that what was
happening in my hands was real. A
joke perhaps? Was it an issue of The

Stanford Review in disguise? They
haven't been publishing for a while
now. No, my name was on the mast
head, and Chang's name was spelled
correctly in the headline.
When it sunk in that it was actually
Friday's Daily, I started a whole ques
tioning process.
As a member of the news depart
ment, I was shocked that the story
was treated the way it was.
It certainly didn't deserve top
ranking; if someone had distributed a
flier saying "Administrator X = In
competent Bureaucrat," we certainly
wouldn't have run that story off the
front, let alone print an "extensively
researched" story on how some say
that there are a number of incompe
tent bureaucrats controlling Stanford's
administration (although I invite
readers to test my theory out).
As a news editor of color, I felt
betrayed that I had no prior knowledge
of this investigation. This was the
same paper that stands on its commit
ment to accurate and fair coverage of
the various campus groups? This is the
paper that I've blown off lectures and
dropped classes for? This is the same
paper that wouldn't run a profile of a
professor because it seemed "un
balanced" because she accused the
University of being unsupportive of
minority faculty without a University

response? This is the same paper that
a week ago denounced New York
Newsday for its hesitant chastisement
of one of its writers for sexist and
racist slurs, and we printed this?\
The story never says anything is
actually wrong with the League, but it
does a damn good job of stigmatizing
just about everybody it mentions. It
plays on a number of stereotypes:
those subversive Commies, the in
scrutable Asians, those power-hungry
minorities.
I'd be tempted to call it a blatantly
racist story, were it not for the fact
that from what I know the reporter
doesn't think that way.
I'm sure he's done a wonderful job
researching the group and so forth,
and has uncovered all these facts
about it. But there are plenty of ways
to color (sort of ironic usage, huh?)
facts to change the end result.
As an example, I wrote the following
snippet, which follows the basic format
of the article on the League:
The editorial board of The Stanford
Daily is a highly secretive organization
constantly making decisions about what
people on campus should think, do and
act.
Daily doctrine states that Stanford is
made up of various groups with influ
ence, among which are administrators,
students, and staff.

The organization has been active at
Stanford for almost 80 years, per
petually recruiting students into its
membership.
However, many students within The
Daily have no knowledge of the secret
agenda of the board. Even many of
those within the board say that they
have no knowledge of a secret agenda.
The recruitment of individuals for
membership is highly secretive, at
times to the point of students at Stan
ford not realizing how or why they
were chosen, according to a number of
students who say they were recruited by
the board.
All of the above is basically true, but
it all makes the board look much
worse than it really is. This is how I
imagine many within the communities
of color feel. And on behalf of The
Daily, I'd like to apologize to them.
But I can't. I can only speak for
myself.
I'm sorry.

term in the story, reappearing with
alarming frequency.)
My experience reading the articles
was like the Brady Bunch episode
where Bobby had that nightmare,
remembering time and time again that
"Mom always said not to play ball in
the house."
I couldn't believe that what was
happening in my hands was real. A
joke perhaps? Was it an issue of The

Stanford Review in disguise? They
haven't been publishing for a while
now. No, my name was on the mast
head, and Chang's name was spelled
correctly in the headline.
When it sunk in that it was actually
Friday's Daily, I started a whole ques
tioning process.
As a member of the news depart
ment, I was shocked that the story
was treated the way it was.
It certainly didn't deserve top
ranking; if someone had distributed a
flier saying "Administrator X = In
competent Bureaucrat," we certainly
wouldn't have run that story off the
front, let alone print an "extensively
researched" story on how some say
that there are a number of incompe
tent bureaucrats controlling Stanford's
administration (although I invite
readers to test my theory out).
As a news editor of color, I felt
betrayed that I had no prior knowledge
of this investigation. This was the
same paper that stands on its commit
ment to accurate and fair coverage of
the various campus groups? This is the
paper that I've blown off lectures and
dropped classes for? This is the same
paper that wouldn't run a profile of a
professor because it seemed "un
balanced" because she accused the
University of being unsupportive of
minority faculty without a University

response? This is the same paper that
a week ago denounced New York
Newsday for its hesitant chastisement
of one of its writers for sexist and
racist slurs, and we printed this?\
The story never says anything is
actually wrong with the League, but it
does a damn good job of stigmatizing
just about everybody it mentions. It
plays on a number of stereotypes:
those subversive Commies, the in
scrutable Asians, those power-hungry
minorities.
I'd be tempted to call it a blatantly
racist story, were it not for the fact
that from what I know the reporter
doesn't think that way.
I'm sure he's done a wonderful job
researching the group and so forth,
and has uncovered all these facts
about it. But there are plenty of ways
to color (sort of ironic usage, huh?)
facts to change the end result.
As an example, I wrote the following
snippet, which follows the basic format
of the article on the League:
The editorial board of The Stanford
Daily is a highly secretive organization
constantly making decisions about what
people on campus should think, do and
act.
Daily doctrine states that Stanford is
made up of various groups with influ
ence, among which are administrators,
students, and staff.

The organization has been active at
Stanford for almost 80 years, per
petually recruiting students into its
membership.
However, many students within The
Daily have no knowledge of the secret
agenda of the board. Even many of
those within the board say that they
have no knowledge of a secret agenda.
The recruitment of individuals for
membership is highly secretive, at
times to the point of students at Stan
ford not realizing how or why they
were chosen, according to a number of
students who say they were recruited by
the board.
All of the above is basically true, but
it all makes the board look much
worse than it really is. This is how I
imagine many within the communities
of color feel. And on behalf of The
Daily, I'd like to apologize to them.
But I can't. I can only speak for
myself.
I'm sorry.

FOR THE FIRST TIME in weeks,
I didn't read The Daily Friday
morning.
I just couldn't — not after looking
at the top-ranked stories about the
alleged presence of a Marxist-Leninist
group on campus, the League of
Revolutionary Struggle. It wasn't a
deliberate boycott of The Daily; it was
out of sheer amazement.
One story told of how a flier alleged
that Gordon Chang, a professor who
has been offered a position here, was
part of this covert group; the other
provided background on the group's
activities, according to an unspecified
number of unnamed sources who
claimed they had been recruited by the
group.
More or less, the story on the flier
itself seemed straightforward enough.
The one glaring problem with it was
an editorial decision. The story was
about members of the Asian commu
nity being upset about the flier, and
The Daily (I don't want to say 'we'
when I refer to The Daily for the rest
of this volume) printed the very same
flier in the paper, doing a much more
effective job of distributing it than its
creator could ever hope to.
Primarily, I was concerned about the
"sidebar" to the story — a sidebar
that was longer than the story itself.
Everything about it seemed tenuous

and hazy, with unnamed sources at
testing to the existence of a secretive
group that controls? shapes? manip
ulates? campus politics.
It said that the members belonged to
all the campus organizations of color,
and that no one really knows how they
work.
I have never before seen a story in
The Daily without a single named
source in it, and I hope to never again.
I have no idea why no one would come
forward with their identity. If students
are afraid of torture/harassment at the
hands of the League, then the story
should have said so.
Those unnamed sources should also
realize that they're making life worse
for themselves and others. Granted
that the League exists and is based on
intimidation, all League members
would have to do is threaten all those
who might have been "recruited" (to
give one example of an inflammatory
term in the story, reappearing with
alarming frequency.)
My experience reading the articles
was like the Brady Bunch episode

remembering time and time again that
