## USC next hurdle in netters' championship drive 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - No
one was paying too much atten
tion to second-seeded and two
time defending NCAA champion
Stanford in the desert a few days
ago.
The media was more interested
in covering undefeated and first
seeded Tennessee or host-school
USC with its three foreign Davis
Cup players.
All that changed yesterday
when Stanford crushed No. 7-
ranked Texas 5-1 in the NCAA
quarterfinals.
In its fir3t-round match Satur
day, Stanford dominated a much
weaker Oklahoma State team 5-1.
The victory over Texas snapped
a 21-match Longhorn winning
streak.
"We opened some eyes out here
today," Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "A 5-1 win over
Texas. . .that's an impressive win.
And if everyone competes like
they did out here today, we should

win, no matter who we play."
"Texas was a great team, and
everybody knew it," junior Glenn
Solomon said. "It definitely helps
our confidence to win a match
like this."
Stanford's semifinal opponent
will be USC, which beat third
seeded Georgia 5-1 in yesterday's
quarterfinals.
For Alex O'Brien, who played
No. 3 singles, yesterday's match
had added significance. O'Brien
hails from Armarillo, Texas. "I
know and like every guy on their
team. I also know how good they
are," O'Brien said. "Still, 1 wanted
to show them what we were ca
pable of."
O'Brien did just that, polishing
off Micheal Penman 6-2, 6-3 in
just over an hour.
O'Brien, who is ranked No. 14
in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings, was broken in the very
first game but, after that, was
never in trouble.
"After that first game, I felt
really confident out there," he
said. "I was hitting it wide to his

forehand a lot, and it was working
really well."
Freshman Jared Palmer was
next off the courts, scoring a 6-2,
6-3 win over Mitch Michulka at
No. 2 singles.
"I was really focused out there
today," Palmer eaid. "I didn't play
that great of tennis, but I concen
trated well. That's what won it."
Palmer, who returned from his
second knee operation only three
weeks ago, said he was moving at
100 percent. "I'm moving espe
cially well at the net. That's cru
cial," he said.
Just minutes after Palmer's vic
tory, Hombrecher served out his
match as well, downing Texas'
Scott Stewart 6-4, 6-4.
Although he wasn't serving nor
returning particularly well,
Hombrecher came up with big
shots when he needed them.
"When I needed a big serve, I hit
one," he said.
At one point during the match,
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger told
Hombrecher, "You're only hitting
25 percent of your first serves in."
Hombrecher responded, "Yeah,
but they're all aces."
Whitlinger agreed and said,
"You're right. Keep serving 'em."
Although Stanford was up 3-0,
the match was far from decided.
Texas players were leading in all
the other singles matches.
Texas' Patrick Flynn made mat
ters worse as he won his third
set quickly against Jeff Cathrall
at No. 4 singles.
After winning the first set,
Cathrall seemed lackadaisical in
the next two. "I just didn't play
well today," Cathrall said of his
4-6, 6-3, 6-2 loss.
In the day's top-billing, fresh
man Jonathan Stark upended
Texas' Steve Bryan 6- 7, 7-5, 6-4.
Stark is ranked second in the
country, and Bryan is ranked
third.
After losing Saturday 6-2, 6-2
to a much lesser opponent in Okla
homa State's Eric Fahnestock,
Stark said today's win gave him
a lot of confidence, especially be
cause it was only his second match
back since his injury.
Stark's serve was particularly
hot as he hit 21 aces in the three
set marathon.
More impressive than his serve,
however, was Stark's ability to

victory over Steve Bryan, the nation's third-ranked player, in the NCAA quarterfinals yesterday.
stay focused after losing the first
set.
Stark had four set points and
three in the first-set tiebreaker
before giving away the set at 10-12
in the tiebreaker.
Just as in the first set where
he jumped out to a 5-2 lead, Stark
came out cruising in the second,
going up 4-0. Bryan fought back,
however, and eventually took a
5-4 lead.
After that, it was all Stark as
he held serve, broke Bryan and
then held again to win the second
set.
In the third, Stark broke at 3-2
and held serve twice to win the
set at 6-4.
"I didn't get frustrated with
myself today," Stark said. "I was
a little upset after losing the first,
but I kept my concentration. It
eventually worked out for me."
With Stanford up 4-1 in singles,
the No. 5 singles match would
decide whether or not the two
teams would go to doubles.

Solomon had lost the first set
6-4 to Texas' No. 5 player Herbert
Karrasch but had come back to
win the second 6-3.
In a match that featured
baseline rallies of up to 20 shots,
Solomon broke Karrasch at 4-3
and then held serve to win the
match 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
"I needed to outtough him
today. That's what it came down
to," Solomon said. "I got lucky."
"It was a typical Solomon
match. He lost the first set, but
he just kept grinding it out and
grinding it out. He has been win
ning matches like that all year,"
Whitlinger said.
Gould agreed, "All the guys on
this team are competitors. They
are the guys you want at the plate
with the bat in their hands when
the game is on the line."
Tomorrow's semifinal match
against USC will kick off at 10
a.m. at the Hyatt Grand Cham
pions in Indian Wells, Calif.
Stanford has never played USC
healthy. With Palmer out of the
lineup April 7, the Cardinal won
the dual 5-1. With both Stark and
Palmer out of the lineup April 20,
Stanford fell 5-1.
