Success — it's how you mea
sure it.
Nine Stanford crew boats
went up to the Sacramento
Aquatic center on Lake Natoma
for this weekend's Pacific 10
championships, and nine crew
boats made it to the finals. No
boat won a championship, but
six boats medaled. Not bad.
"Everyone had a chance on
the last race of the season to
be a champion. You can't com
plain," said men's coach Ken
Dreyfuss.
With the women's varsity
eight upsetting California to
finish second, and 23 freshman
men medaling, it is hard to ar
gue. Every crew had a chance
and every crew made the most
of it. The men's varsity eight
finished fourth, but like the
rest of the Cardinal rowers,
they gave it their all.
"We went out hard. We really
went for the win," Dreyfuss
said. "There was not a crew
out of the nine who did not go
for the win."
The problem for the men was
that their competition did the
same. Stanford came off the
line hard and after the first
500 meters was less than a sec
ond behind favored Washing
ton. The boat remained
competitive through the

halfway point, but with 500
meters to go they found they
could not hold on. Washington
and UCLA made their moves
and got nearly a length and a
half on the Cardinal, ultimately
finishing 1-2 respectively. Stan
ford battled with California
down to the wire, but the Bears
pulled ahead in the last 15
strokes and got the bronze by
.5 seconds. The finish was dis
appointing, but not crushing.
"This is a good crew,"
Dreyfuss said. "They did a
remarkable job getting into the
picture. At San Diego (in April)
we were not in the picture, at
the Pac-10's we were."
The women have been in the
picture all year, and if things
go right, they should get the
chance to stay in the picture.
Though only the varsity eight
champion is guaranteed a trip
to the nationals, the Cardinal's
surprise second place finish
could move the U.S. Rowing
Association to give Stanford an
at-large bid.
"We are optimistic," women's
coach John Davis said. "We
have really come on in the last
six days. If they want another
West Coast crew it would be
us."
Whatever may happen, the
varsity women have to be
happy with their performance.
Seeded third, the Cardinal found
themselves in a race that had
three boats challenging for second
in the last 200 meters. Washing
ton, California, and Stanford all
had a chance to take the silver.
"Before the race the Cal coach
came up to me and really nailed
it on the head. He said it was
going to be a bloodbath, that it
was really going to be murder out
there, and it was," Davis said.
After what Davis termed a
"blazing" start, the Bruins of
UCLA took control of the compe
tition, and turned it into a race
for second. California made its
move at the 1300-meter mark,
and Stanford found itself behind,
but only momentarily. When
Washington began to falter, it
came down to California and
Stanford in a mad sprint for the
line, with the Cardinal prevailing
for the silver.
