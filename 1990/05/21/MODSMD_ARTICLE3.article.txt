# Viva El Palo Alto: The Tree still stands tall

What if half the people in Paris
didn't know where the Eiffel Tower
was or whether it really existed, even
though it was a national symbol of
France?
What could not happen to the Eiffel
Tower has happened to El Palo Alto,
a "1,000-year old" redwood tree near
Stanford. The Ã¼biquitous symbol of
Stanford University appears every
where, from University stationery to
Stanford sweatshirts to the Band's
dancing mascot.
Today El Palo Alto is hardly notice
able, surrounded by taller eucalyptus
trees and standing by a simple iron
rail bridge to Menlo Park. Many Stan

ford students and community mem-
bers are not aware of its location or
even its existence.
Located on the bank of San Fran-
cisquito Creek within 20 yards of the
Southern Pacific railroad bridge and
two blocks from the Stanford Shopping
Center, the tree is the namesake of
both the Palo Alto Farm, which con-
stituted Leland Stanford's pre-1891 lo-
cal land holdings, and the city that
was founded as a college town three
years after the University opened.
A century ago El Palo Alto was a
prominent landmark on the Peninsula,
towering more than 100 feet high and
visible from miles away. Its name
means "the high tree" in Spanish, and
residents regarded the unusual double
trunks of the tree as sentinels of the

local area.
Unfortunately, a powerful rainstorm
in 1886 battered the north curved
trunk into the arroyo, although the
straighter south trunk survives to this
day.
Since that time the surviving tree
has weathered the elements, breathed
soot from several decades of coal-
powered Southern Pacific trains pass-
ing nearby, and benefitted from
extensive recent efforts by the City of
Palo Alto to anchor the tree.
Because El Palo Alto lies on Palo
Alto city property, the University does
not take responsibility for main-
tainance of the tree. But some in the
local community have disagreed with
that position, saying that El Palo Alto
is a majestic symbol of Stanford worth

preserving, and that Stanford should
join Palo Alto in working to protect it.
However, even 100 years ago, El Palo
Alto was was not virile and majestic
enough to represent an institution of
Stanford's nature. In a letter by the
designer of Stanford's seal, the artist
chose instead to view several other
healthier redwoods to imagine "what
El Palo Alto would have resembled in
its prime (several hundred years ago)."
El Palo Alto was discovered bv the
expedition of Spanish captain Gaspar
de Portola in November 1769. Portola
was sent to find and fortify the Mon
terey Bay but found himself by the
San Francisco Bay instead, more than
50 miles away. Portola's party camped
underneath the shelter of El Palo Alto
and gave it its name-
