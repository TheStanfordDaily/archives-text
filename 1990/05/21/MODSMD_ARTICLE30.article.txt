# Carey leads the way with home run crown
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
UC-Santa Barbara pitcher Gary
Adcock made the same mistake
college pitchers have made on 54
other occasions. He served Paul
Carey a pitch that he could drive.
In the third inning of Satur
day's game, Carey came to the
plate tied with Southern Califor
nia's Mark McGwire and Gon
zaga's JefTHainline on the Pacific
10 Conference all-time career
home run list at 54. The senior
Ail- American stepped in the box
and drilled Adcock's first pitch
toward the fence in rightfield, but
it hooked foul.
After a ball and another strike,
Carey was in a hole with a 1-2
count. "I was looking for a fast
ball," the senior said. "The UCSB
pitchers have been throwing
fastballs inside all weekend, but
they were also throwing away for
strikes. So it was hard."
But Carey made it look as easy
as ever. He deposited Adcock's un
expected curveball 350 feet from
home plate to record his 55th
home run and etch his name in
the record books as the Pac-10's
all-time career home run leader.
"It still hasn't sunk in,"he said.
"It probably won't until I retire
and can look back on some of
these moments. The one off
McDonald still hasn't."
That one against Ben McDonald
in the 1957 College World Series
is probably Carey's most memo
rable blast. The Cardinal, losing
5-2 to LSU in the bottom of the
tenth inning of an elimination
game, sent Carey to the plate with
the bases loaded.
He promptly stroked a fastball
for an opposite-field grand slam
to win the game. To this day, the

four-run game-winning blast tops
Carey's list, even after hitting the
record breaker. "The home run
off McDonald is definitely my big
gest one."
Saturday's blast also ended a
l-for-17 slump that had plagued
him since tying the record May 8
against San Francisco State. "I
have been feeling a lot of pressure
because I haven't been hitting well
these past few weeks," Carey said.
"What a relief. It was almost to
the point where it wasn't fun."
During the mini-slump, he did
anything he could to try to change
his luck. "Baseball is mental and
superstitious," he said. "I changed
everything. I changed my socks,
sliding pants, and bats but noth
ing worked. So, I stood alone for
the national anthem."
During the anthem before each
game, Carey usually finds the
other two outfielders and stands
in shallow centerfield. Saturday,
he left Jeff Hammonds and Ryan
Turner to themselves and stood
alone in right field. That must
have done the trick.
Before the season started,
Coach Mark Marquess seemed op
timistic about Carey's chances,
even without superstitions. "Paul
is the top power hitter in college
baseball," he said in the Cardinal's
press guide. "He has as much
power as we've had here. I expect
him to have his best season and
be a dominant player in the Pac
-10."
That's a pretty tall order con
sidering his numbers over his first
three years in the Cardinal uni
form. As a freshman and sopho
more, Carey made his presence
felt by stroking 12 homers each
year and helping Stanford win two
national championships. He
brought his home run total up to
40 his junior year by hitting 12
of his 16 round-trippers in the
final 22 games of the season.
But this year, Carey has made
Marquess look like a fortune teller
by hitting .343 and pulling down
six Stanford and four Pac-10
career records in offensive

categories.
After hitting the blast, however,
Carey is by no means ready to sit
back and rest on his laurels. The
career .337 hitter has other things
to worry about. "I still have to
come back tommorrow and get a
couple base hits," he said.
In fact, the senior didn't even
want to wait for the next day. In
the fifth inning of Saturday's
game, he took an outside pitch to
the opposite field for what looked
to be his second homer of the
game. But with the help of a cross
wind and a little bad luck, it sliced

foul by about five feet. One pitch
later, he brought Paulsen in from
third by grounding out to first to
tie the score.
His defensive skills seemed to
have been in order as well. In the
sixth inning, a line drive eluded
the diving effort of Carey. But,
he quickly recovered and threw
out Nick Satriano who was trying
to advance from first to third on
the hit. It was a magnificent dis
play of all-around defensive talent
that so many of today's power
hitting outfielders lack.
Hail to the (home run) King.

the bases loaded.
He promptly stroked a fastball
for an opposite-field grand slam
to win the game. To this day, the

four-run game-winning blast tops
Carey's list, even after hitting the
record breaker. "The home run
off McDonald is definitely my big
gest one."
Saturday's blast also ended a
l-for-17 slump that had plagued
him since tying the record May 8
against San Francisco State. "I
have been feeling a lot of pressure
because I haven't been hitting well
these past few weeks," Carey said.
"What a relief. It was almost to
the point where it wasn't fun."
During the mini-slump, he did
anything he could to try to change
his luck. "Baseball is mental and
superstitious," he said. "I changed
everything. I changed my socks,
sliding pants, and bats but noth
ing worked. So, I stood alone for
the national anthem."
During the anthem before each
game, Carey usually finds the
other two outfielders and stands
in shallow centerfield. Saturday,
he left Jeff Hammonds and Ryan
Turner to themselves and stood
alone in right field. That must
have done the trick.
Before the season started,
Coach Mark Marquess seemed op
timistic about Carey's chances,
even without superstitions. "Paul
is the top power hitter in college
baseball," he said in the Cardinal's
press guide. "He has as much
power as we've had here. I expect
him to have his best season and
be a dominant player in the Pac
-10."
That's a pretty tall order con
sidering his numbers over his first
three years in the Cardinal uni
form. As a freshman and sopho
more, Carey made his presence
felt by stroking 12 homers each
year and helping Stanford win two
national championships. He
brought his home run total up to
40 his junior year by hitting 12
of his 16 round-trippers in the
final 22 games of the season.
But this year, Carey has made
Marquess look like a fortune teller
by hitting .343 and pulling down
six Stanford and four Pac-10
career records in offensive

categories.
After hitting the blast, however,
Carey is by no means ready to sit
back and rest on his laurels. The
career .337 hitter has other things
to worry about. "I still have to
come back tommorrow and get a
couple base hits," he said.
In fact, the senior didn't even
want to wait for the next day. In
the fifth inning of Saturday's
game, he took an outside pitch to
the opposite field for what looked
to be his second homer of the
game. But with the help of a cross
wind and a little bad luck, it sliced

foul by about five feet. One pitch
later, he brought Paulsen in from
third by grounding out to first to
tie the score.
His defensive skills seemed to
have been in order as well. In the
sixth inning, a line drive eluded
the diving effort of Carey. But,
he quickly recovered and threw
out Nick Satriano who was trying
to advance from first to third on
the hit. It was a magnificent dis
play of all-around defensive talent
that so many of today's power
hitting outfielders lack.
Hail to the (home run) King.
