INDIAN WELLS, Calif. -
After Stanford freshman Jona
than Stark lost 6-2, 6-2 to Okla
homa State's Eric Fahnestock
Saturday morning, a lot of people
at the NCAA Men's Tennis Cham
pionships were saying, "I told you
SO.
You can't put a guy who hasn't
played a single competitive set in
35 days into the No. 1 spot at
the NCAAs.
What's worse, you can't expect
a guy with only a partially healed
stress fracture in his left foot to
compete successfully with the best
players in the country.
For Stark, it was his first dual
meet loss of the season, after win
ning 18 straight matches at No.

1. "I'm just embarrassed," Stark
said after the defeat.
But all the"I told you so's"
stopped yesterday â€” abruptly.
In undoubtedly his most im
pressive win of the season, Stark,
who was ranked No. 2 by the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings
coming into the match, downed
Texas' Steve Bryan, the No. 3-
ranked player in the country, 6-7,
7-5, 6-4.
"It was a huge confidence
builder for me," Stark said. "Yes
terday, I got off to a slow start,
and everything just went downhill
from there. Today, even if I would
have lost, I felt so much better
out there."
And lose he almost did. In the
first set, Stark couldn't capitalize
on a truckload of opportunities.
Up 3-0, 4-1 and 5-2 in the first

set, Stark seemed to miss a few
more easy shots than usual.
At 5-4 in the first, Stark had
a set point but couldn't convert.
In the first-set tiebreaker, Stark
had set points at 6-5, 7-6, and 9-8
but missed with groundstrokes
that landed just outside the
baseline each time. Bryan ended
up winning the first-set tie
breaker 12-10.
"Of course, I was upset about
losing the first set. But, even
though I lost it, I knew, if I kept
concentrating, I could stay in
there," Stark said.
Instead of becoming frustrated
after losing the first set as he did
Saturday, Stark bore down and
jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the
second.
Once again, however, Bryan
inched his way back into the set,
winning five straight games and
going up 5-4.
Stark held serve at 4-5 and
broke Bryan at 5-5. Stark then
served out the set, acing Bryan
on the final point and winning
the second set 7-5.
The third set was a little less
up-and-down. Stark broke Bryan
at 3-2 and never looked back,
taking the final set 6-4.
Stark had seven aces in the de
ciding third set and 21 aces in
the match. "I was serving 100
times better today," he said.
According to Coach Dick Gould,
Stark's comeback victory did al
most as much for the team's con
fidence as it did for Stark's.
Teammate Glenn Solomon
agreed, "John's our leader. He's
our No. 1 guy. So, when he comes
back and wins a match like that,
it helps the whole team."
With Stark back in top form,
as he appeared to be yeste.'day,
Stanford looks nearly unstoppable
heading into today's semifinal
against Southern California. At
their last meeting, Stark beat
USC's No. 1-ranked player, Byron
Black, 6-1, 6-3. Black is ranked
No. 4 in the country.
"With Stark playing well again,
a lot of teams are saying 'oh no,
he's back,'" Gould said. "That
does a lot psychologically for our
team."
