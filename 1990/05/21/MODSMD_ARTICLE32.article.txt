# Record-setting weekend for Card nine
## Stanford finishes regular season with sweep of Gauchos, three milestones 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
closed out its regular season in
high style this weekend, treating
the guest UC-Santa Barbara

Gauchos to a record-breaking ex
travaganza.
When the smoke from the party
cleared, Stanford's Paul Carey
stood atop the Pacific 10 Confer
ence career home run list, Troy
Paulsen had shattered the school

record for doubles in a season
(and tied Carey for the career
mark) and Tim Griffin had be
come only the fourth player in
school history to hit 20 homers
in a season.
Oh yeah: David Holbrook had
hit his third home run of the year,
too.

Cardinal sweeps three*
game series with Gauchos |

Even with all the weekend's
destroyed milestones, it was
Holbrook's homer — a gTand slam
in the eighth inning of yesterday's
we'll-spot-you-an-eight-run-lead
and-sfi//-beat-you 13-11 in-your
face win — that received the most
attention.
"I was just trying to make con
tact with runners in scoring po
sition," said Holbrook, who also
had the game-winning hit in the
first game of last weekend's series
with USC. "I wasn't sure if it was
gone — I figured it would either
go out or get caught."
It went, erasing what was left
of an 11-3 lead that had been
built in the Gauchos' first four
times up. At the start of the game
UCSB owned both John Reid, who
got exactly one batter out while
giving up five runs, and Greg Mix,
who came in and gave up five
more before being chased in the
fourth.
Not that it really mattered.
"We've been down before,"
Holbrook said. "There's just some
thing about this team's attitude:
We never feel like we're going to
lose. Even if the other team's up,
we figure we can match them run
for run, and we always feel like
we're going to score one more."
The team probably doesn't feel
it's going to lose simply because
it doesn't know how: The Gaucho
sweep gives the Cardinal a 52-10
record heading into this weekend's
regional playoffs at Sunken Dia
mond. (All-session passes, single
day passes and single-game tickets
are on sale starting today at the
Athletic Department. The word is
to get 'em quick.)
The 52 wins is one shy of the
school record, which was set by
the 1987 NCAA Champion team.

That squad, though, was (only!)
44-16 after the regular season.
Not bad for a team that went
into this weekend knowing it had
to, well . . not do very much. "We
just want to play as consistently
as possible," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said after the Cardinal
out-consistent-ed UCSB 6-4 on
Saturday. "I don't think we're
very revved up. These games are
important, but they aren't do-or
die."
Someone must have forgotten
to tell Paulsen, who was eight
for-fifteen with seven doubles dur
ing the three games. His three
two-baggers in Friday's 6-2
yawner gave him 23 on the year
(breaking his own record of 22,
set in 1988); his three on Saturday
set him up to score half the team's
runs; and his one yesterday
(everyone has off days) actually
tied Carey's record of 65 in a
career.
"I'm barking at his heels,"
Paulsen joked after he pulled
within one of Carey on Saturday.
"We don't keep track of those
things — I knew I had 20, but
only because Paul and Griff do,
too, and we joke with each other
about it at times. You try not to
think about it, because if vou do
you can fall out of your tree in a
hurry."
Nobody fell anywhere against
the Gauchos, especially not Grif
fin, who finally got dong No. 20
on Friday after going homer-less
in the first half of May. The Car
dinal had taken a four-zip lead in
the fourth, which was started by
Rvan Turner's bloop single to cen
ter.
Roger Burnett followed with a
first-pitch double, scoring Turner,
and then Troy Tall man got on
with a bunt that pitcher Scott
Longaker and first baseman Sean
Luft both did their best to avoid.
That brought up .Jeff Ham
monds, who sent Longaker's first
pitch smashing off the Diet Pepsi
sign next to the scoreboard in left.
Good night.
The game was basically over
(Stan Spencer gave up only a run
scoring grounder to Frank Appice
and an RBI double to D;inny
Lane) except for Griffin's solo
homer, which capped off the scor

ing and broke him out of his
homer-less slump.
"I don't know if I've been press
ing," Griffin said. "I just haven't
been hitting. "You make so many
adjustments over the course of the
season, and soon you're swinging
completely differently. I'm getting
close to where I want to be,
though."
He must be, because home run
No. 21 came the very next day.
With the score tied at three, Grif
fin came up with two down in
the fifth. Clank! The ball was on
its way to the next zip code, and
left fielder Jerrold Rountree could
only lean against the fence — face

first, arms pounding in frustra
tion — as Griffin trotted around.
The Cardinal added two just
in-case runs in the sixth, and
Scott Weiss, relieving Mike Mus
sina, picked up his seventh save
by getting Appice to ground into
a force in the ninth.
That set the stage for Sunday's
sweep-cap, which marked the
ninth time this season the Cardi
nal has played broom-meister.
Card notes
Shortstop Roger Burnett suffered
a mild sprained ankle in the second
inning yesterday when Gaucho Nick
Satriano got a little hyper sliding into
second. Burnett should be fine.
In the top of the third, an orange
balloon from the Special Olympics
swim meet found its way onto the
field in front of Cardinal second base
man Tony Better. Detter had
thoughts about gently escorting the
balloon off the field, but then said
the heck with it, popped it and put
the remains in his pocket.
The next two Gauchos homered.

ing and broke him out of his
homer-less slump.
"I don't know if I've been press
ing," Griffin said. "I just haven't
been hitting. "You make so many
adjustments over the course of the
season, and soon you're swinging
completely differently. I'm getting
close to where I want to be,
though."

No. 21 came the very next day.
With the score tied at three, Grif

the fifth. Clank! The ball was on
its way to the next zip code, and
left fielder Jerrold Rountree could
only lean against the fence — face

first, arms pounding in frustra

The Cardinal added two just
in-case runs in the sixth, and
Scott Weiss, relieving Mike Mus

by getting Appice to ground into

That set the stage for Sunday's
sweep-cap, which marked the
ninth time this season the Cardi
nal has played broom-meister.

Shortstop Roger Burnett suffered
a mild sprained ankle in the second
inning yesterday when Gaucho Nick
Satriano got a little hyper sliding into
second. Burnett should be fine.
In the top of the third, an orange
balloon from the Special Olympics
swim meet found its way onto the
field in front of Cardinal second base
man Tony Better. Detter had
thoughts about gently escorting the
balloon off the field, but then said
the heck with it, popped it and put
the remains in his pocket.
The next two Gauchos homered.
The Stanford baseball team
closed out its regular season in
high style this weekend, treating
the guest UC-Santa Barbara

Gauchos to a record-breaking ex
travaganza.
When the smoke from the party
cleared, Stanford's Paul Carey
stood atop the Pacific 10 Confer
ence career home run list, Troy
Paulsen had shattered the school

record for doubles in a season
(and tied Carey for the career
mark) and Tim Griffin had be
come only the fourth player in
school history to hit 20 homers
in a season.
Oh yeah: David Holbrook had
hit his third home run of the year,
too.

Cardinal sweeps three*
game series with Gauchos |

Even with all the weekend's
destroyed milestones, it was
Holbrook's homer — a gTand slam
in the eighth inning of yesterday's
we'll-spot-you-an-eight-run-lead
and-sfi//-beat-you 13-11 in-your
face win — that received the most
attention.
"I was just trying to make con
tact with runners in scoring po
sition," said Holbrook, who also
had the game-winning hit in the
first game of last weekend's series
with USC. "I wasn't sure if it was
gone — I figured it would either
go out or get caught."
It went, erasing what was left
of an 11-3 lead that had been
built in the Gauchos' first four
times up. At the start of the game
UCSB owned both John Reid, who
got exactly one batter out while
giving up five runs, and Greg Mix,
who came in and gave up five
more before being chased in the
fourth.
Not that it really mattered.
"We've been down before,"
Holbrook said. "There's just some
thing about this team's attitude:
We never feel like we're going to
lose. Even if the other team's up,
we figure we can match them run
for run, and we always feel like
we're going to score one more."
The team probably doesn't feel
it's going to lose simply because
it doesn't know how: The Gaucho
sweep gives the Cardinal a 52-10
record heading into this weekend's
regional playoffs at Sunken Dia
mond. (All-session passes, single
day passes and single-game tickets
are on sale starting today at the
Athletic Department. The word is
to get 'em quick.)
The 52 wins is one shy of the
school record, which was set by
the 1987 NCAA Champion team.

That squad, though, was (only!)
44-16 after the regular season.
Not bad for a team that went
into this weekend knowing it had
to, well . . not do very much. "We
just want to play as consistently
as possible," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said after the Cardinal
out-consistent-ed UCSB 6-4 on
Saturday. "I don't think we're
very revved up. These games are
important, but they aren't do-or
die."
Someone must have forgotten
to tell Paulsen, who was eight
for-fifteen with seven doubles dur
ing the three games. His three
two-baggers in Friday's 6-2
yawner gave him 23 on the year
(breaking his own record of 22,
set in 1988); his three on Saturday
set him up to score half the team's
runs; and his one yesterday
(everyone has off days) actually
tied Carey's record of 65 in a
career.
"I'm barking at his heels,"
Paulsen joked after he pulled
within one of Carey on Saturday.
"We don't keep track of those
things — I knew I had 20, but
only because Paul and Griff do,
too, and we joke with each other
about it at times. You try not to
think about it, because if vou do
you can fall out of your tree in a
hurry."
Nobody fell anywhere against
the Gauchos, especially not Grif
fin, who finally got dong No. 20
on Friday after going homer-less
in the first half of May. The Car
dinal had taken a four-zip lead in
the fourth, which was started by
Rvan Turner's bloop single to cen
ter.
Roger Burnett followed with a
first-pitch double, scoring Turner,
and then Troy Tall man got on
with a bunt that pitcher Scott
Longaker and first baseman Sean
Luft both did their best to avoid.
That brought up .Jeff Ham
monds, who sent Longaker's first
pitch smashing off the Diet Pepsi
sign next to the scoreboard in left.
