# Card takes five Pac-10 titles
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
The men's and women's track and field teams
had two main goals coming into the 1990 season:
first, to beat California, and second, to place fifth
or higher in the Pacific-10 Conference Champion
ships.
After several months of continuous improvement,
the squads lost an emotional decision to the Bears
on the last event of that meet. This past weekend,
they once again gave their all, only to fall short of
achieving their goals, with the men finishing eighth
and the women placing sixth.
However, in a meet where many things went
wrong for the Cardinal, there were some bright
spots. Stanford claimed five individual champion
ships. That's five more than last year.
Last Tuesday, in inclement weather, Peggy Odita
won the heptathlon. The weather only deteriated
over the weekend, becoming another foe for the
athletes to compete against, but a number of Car
dinal individuals followed Odita's lead.
Bill Crowley closed out his Pac-10 career by win
ning the 1500-meter run in 3:47.79. Mark Mastalir
also scored in that event, placing sixth in 3:52.64.
Shocking the field, junior Melanie Bloch captured
the women's 1500 in a personal record, giving Stan
ford a sweep at that distance. She was clocked at
4:24.2, about ten seconds ahead of Ashley Black at
4:43.6. Although Black did not score at eighth place,
the freshman promised plenty to come in future
years for Stanford.
Junior Dave Strang outran all comers in the
800-meter run, finishing in 1:49.38. Teammate Alex
Accetta garnered sixth place and one point in that
event with a 1:55.09 time.
Chryste Gaines, the heralded sophomore sprinter,
won the 100- meter dash in a not-so-blistering 12.05.
"The headwind was pretty bad," she explained. After
a relaxed run in the 200 prelims, Gaines did not
start the finals in that event due to a tight ham-

string. This unfortunate result of the cold weather
prevented her from qualifying for this year's NCAAs
in that event.
As expected, the women's horizontal jumpers were
successful. Venessa Henlon, Jackie Edwards and
Alysia Hubbard went 4-5-6 in the triple jump to
tally seven points for the Cardinal. Edwards and
Hubbard duplicated their places in the long jump,
as well.
Other field events were also successful. Junior
Debbie Malueg placed third in the shot put and
sixth in the discus with distances of 47-9 and 150-06,
respectively. Senior Brian Boggess threw 57-1 1/2
in the shot put, good for sixth place.
After considerable late-season success, junior
Marcus Hickerson leaped a somewhat disappointing
25-3 1/4 in the long jump, but still managed fourth
place.
Odita got the honor of being the highest Cardinal
point-scorer when she tied for fourth in the high
jump at 5-8 3/4. Added to her heptathlon champi
onship, she contributed 14 of the Stanford women's
51 points.
Another Cardinal scorer was senior Eric Mastalir,
who garnered six of the men's 38 points with a
third-place finish in the 5000-meter run. The stop
watch showed 14:27.93.
Despite the somewhat lower-then-hoped-for team
placing, Coach Brooks Johnson remained upbeat.
"I'm so proud of our team's effort this year," he
said. "Last year we had no individual champions.
This year we had five. That shows me a lot about
the character and ethic of this year's group."
