# Dorm phone system faces legal challenge
## 
### Heidi Durrow 
Three graduate students are challenging
the legality of the new University-wide tele
phone service because it provides only one
way for students to "reach out and touch
someone."
If the California Public Utilities Com
mission sides with the three students, it
could require the University to provide
access to Pacific Bell's telephone service.
The University's new phone service is ex
pected to begin June 21.
Michael Murray, a graduate student and
resident assistant, filed the complaint when
Stanford's Office of Communication Serv
ices "stopped changing [the new system]"
in response to student complaints, he said.
Murray filed a formal complaint with
the commission on May 10 in conjunction
with two other graduate students, William
Behrman and Gerald LeTendre, claiming
the new system violates Guideline 8 of the
commission's Shared Tenant Decision.
Guideline 8 states that "the property
owner or manager shall place no restric
tions on tenants which desire service di
rectly from the telephone utility in addition

to or in lieu of service furnished by the
provider."
However, before Stanford can be forced
to comply with this regulation, the com
mission must decide whether or not Stan
ford is covered by the decision's guidelines.
Murray claims that Stanford is not a
"telephone company" that is exexpt from
Guideline 8, as are hospitals and hotels.
These exemptions are given for companies
with "temporary" residents, but Murray
argues that most graduate students live on
campus for four years, including summers,
and cannot be considered "temporary."
"That's why this is argued from the grad
uate standpoint," Murray explained.
The complaint also claims that Stanford's
requirements for qualifying for a service
comparable to Pacific Bell's Universal
Lifeline service for low-income families are
not in synch with the guidelines the state
has set forth.
In order to qualify for Stanford's offering
"you must send a copy of your January or
February (1990) Pacific Bell bill to verify
that you qualify," according to a brochure
