# Dorm phone system faces legal challenge
## 
### Heidi Durrow 
Three graduate students are challenging
the legality of the new University-wide tele
phone service because it provides only one
way for students to "reach out and touch
someone."
If the California Public Utilities Com
mission sides with the three students, it
could require the University to provide
access to Pacific Bell's telephone service.
The University's new phone service is ex
pected to begin June 21.
Michael Murray, a graduate student and
resident assistant, filed the complaint when
Stanford's Office of Communication Serv
ices "stopped changing [the new system]"
in response to student complaints, he said.
Murray filed a formal complaint with
the commission on May 10 in conjunction
with two other graduate students, William
Behrman and Gerald LeTendre, claiming
the new system violates Guideline 8 of the
commission's Shared Tenant Decision.
Guideline 8 states that "the property
owner or manager shall place no restric
tions on tenants which desire service di
rectly from the telephone utility in addition

to or in lieu of service furnished by the
provider."
However, before Stanford can be forced
to comply with this regulation, the com
mission must decide whether or not Stan
ford is covered by the decision's guidelines.
Murray claims that Stanford is not a
"telephone company" that is exexpt from
Guideline 8, as are hospitals and hotels.
These exemptions are given for companies
with "temporary" residents, but Murray
argues that most graduate students live on
campus for four years, including summers,
and cannot be considered "temporary."
"That's why this is argued from the grad
uate standpoint," Murray explained.
The complaint also claims that Stanford's
requirements for qualifying for a service
comparable to Pacific Bell's Universal
Lifeline service for low-income families are
not in synch with the guidelines the state
has set forth.
In order to qualify for Stanford's offering
"you must send a copy of your January or
February (1990) Pacific Bell bill to verify
that you qualify," according to a brochure
issued by Communication Serv
ices.
However, the state require
ments for Universal Lifeline serv
ice are based on income and not
on proof of prior subscription to
the service, as Communication
Services requires.
"It's a grandfather clause,"
Murray said of the verification
requirement. Murray said he is
concerned new students wouldn't
be eligible, nor those who "threw
away their January and February
phone bills," he said.
Murray's complaint also seeks
to halt the June 21 change-over
date. In addition, he is beginning
a petition drive to influence the
decision.
Murray is also concerned that
students cannot choose their own
long-distance carrier and that a
late telephone payment could
cause a student's registration to
be put on hold.
There is, however, some debate
over the feasibility of dual access

to Communication Services and
Pacific Bell. Maureen Trimm, as
sistant director of Communica
tion Services, said dual access is
"not possible for us to do."
But Judy Peterson of Pacific
Bell's media center claims, "As it
stands now, [dual access] could
be done, [but] if Stanford refused
us access or if they went in and
cut all the inside wire, we would
no longer have any access."
Pacific Bell has sold Stanford
its main cable. Stanford also owns
the inside wiring for access, since
according to 1987 deregulation
guidelines, the property owner
owns the wiring.
The complaint will now be as
signed to an administrative law
judge and follow the legal proce
dure, said M. J. Purcell, a contact
counselor at the Public Utilities
Commission. The complaint could
"go to hearing, be settled out of
court or dismissed," she said.
Jasper Williams of the Stanford
Legal Office, who is handling the
case for the University, was un
available for comment. Stanford
has 30 days to reply to the com
plaint.
Despite the possibility of a delay
in the change-over, Communica

tion Services is "proceeding along
with our plans," Trimm said.
The change-over is expected to
begin as scheduled on June 21
and will effectively disconnect cur
rent telephone service in Crothers
Memorial and all buildings in Es
condido Village and the Rains
Houses.
In the meantime, Murray urges
students to put the words "I
would prefer Pacific Bell service"
on the Pacific Bell Quick Discon
nect Form.
"This gives Pacific Bell an idea
of who would like Pacific Bell
service if given the opportunity."
Murray also encouraged stu
dents to write "pending PUC in
vestigation" on the Service
Transition Form. Even if it is not
legally binding, it does "send a
message to Communication Serv
ices," he said.
Peterson commented, "Under
the auspices of the break-up (of
Pacific Bell's monopoly), the
whole idea is competition. We feel
students ought to be able to
choose."
However, because a formal com
plaint has been filed, "the PUC
will make a decision," Peterson
said.
