# More than 2,000 sign petition to recall COP
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Disgruntled students think they have
amassed enough student signatures to sup
port a recall of the Council of Presidents
slate "Four Our Future."
The students, led by the group Stanford
United for Fair Elections, submitted their
petition of 2,012 signatures Friday, after
10 days of circulating the document. If
verified by ASSU Elections Commissioner
Steve Krauss, the petition would force a
recall election as early as June 4.
First-year graduate student Perry Fried
man, who has helped lead the petition push,
said he was confident that the number of
signatures would be enough to mandate a
recall election. "I've been quoted various
numbers," Friedman said, "but 2,012
signatures should be more than enough."
According to the ASSU Constitution, a
petition to recall the Council of Presidents

must contain signatures from "at least 15
percent of the membership of the Associ
ation." Krauss estimated the number of
signatures needed to be "around 2,000,"
but said he would call the Registrar s Office
to find out the exact number needed.
"The signatures will have to be verified
by [Hearings Officer] Natalie Seer," Krauss
said yesterday, further stating that the
verification process could take two to three
days.
Friedman said he had already noticed
and crossed out a signature by Bart
Simpson, the popular cartoon character
who has already caused much of the fuss
in this election. Krauss ruled after the
election that write-in votes for fictional
characters such as the Simpsons and the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would not
be counted.
Krauss was unsure when a recall election
would be held. "The ASSU Constitution
says that we have to wait at least 10 days
from verification," he said. "It would be a
good idea to hold the election this quarter,
and I assume that both slates would agree.
I think everyone wants to get this whole
thing over with."
Krauss cited two main problems which
verification of this petition would create.
If the recall election were held during Dead
Week, which begins June 4, Krauss said
he would be concerned that people would
not vote due to other commitments.
In addition, if election results mandated
a recall of the current COP slate, the elec
tion for the new slate might not occur
until fall quarter. "We have to allow one
week for the new COP slate campaign,"
Krauss said, "and there would be no way
to have the new election this year."
With this scenario, "the ASSU Bylaws
are unclear about who would run the ASSU
during the summer," he said.
Goodwin Liu, a member of the "Four
Our Future" COP slate, echoed Krauss'
concern about a Dead Week recall election.
"You'd be asking people to vote in a week
when they'll have better things to do," Liu
said. "But I don't think this election would

work to our disfavor. I wouldn't be terribly
worried about the results."
According to Michael Canul, members of
"A Clean Slate," the Students First COP
slate, hope that the recall election will be
held this year. "If the recall election were
tomorrow," Canul said, "undoubtedly we
would fare well. But I can't speculate on
next year's results. Obviously, there would
be a big difference with the different con
stituencies."
If the signatures are verified by Krauss,
an ASSU Senate vote would determine the
date of the recall election. Because the
recall petition was submitted so close to
the end of the quarter, the senate has the
authority to hold the recall election next
year.
"The people have spoken three times
about this election: the initial controversy,
the Daily poll and the petition," Canul said.
"It's my hope that the Senate will finally
listen to what student opinion is saying
and decide to have the election this quar
ter."
But Friedman is already satisfied with
his group's efforts. "It's a symbolic thing,
whether or not it succeeds," Friedman said.
"It tells the ASSU that the people aren't
going to take this lying down, and that
the student body isn't going to quit. People
do care."
