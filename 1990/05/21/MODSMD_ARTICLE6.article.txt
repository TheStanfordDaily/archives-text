# Prof. details cause of black poverty in U.S.

### Kaarin Michaelsen 
The unequal distribution of financial and
social resources to blacks in the United States
is the primary cause of the high levels of
poverty that many of them face today, accord
ing to Tetteh Kofi, professor of economics at
the University of San Francisco.
"Why blacks are so poor" was the topic of
Kofi's speech to a small group of students and
faculty at History Corner Friday afternoon.
His talk was the latest in a series of ongoing
"monthly raps on where it's at in black Amer
ica," which are sponsored by the Program in
African and Afro-American Studies.
Kofi, who served as a member of the Food
Research Institute at Stanford for nine years
before accepting a position at USF, was named
one of the top 20 black economists in the
United States in the fall 1989 edition of "The
Review of Black Political Economy."
In his speech, Kofi argued that not only
does the United States have a long history of
denying equal resources to blacks, but this
trend has lately been augmented by its reliance
on neoclassical theories of economics, which
assume that individuals start with the same
attributes and don't look at prior accumula
tions of wealth or resources.
"When one looks at the problem of black
poverty in the United States in neoclassical
economic terms, it's easy to see how the dice
has been loaded against blacks," he said.
"Neoclassical economists assume that every
one starts out more or less equal, and so goods
should be distributed accordingly. This simply
isn't true for blacks; history proves it isn't
so. But the fact that few realize this is one
of the primary reasons why the
problems of blacks' disadvantages
aren't taken seriously," he said.
According to Kofi, the
redistribution of resources is the
"only real way to resolve the issue
of black poverty," but he feels that
"it's just too late for the United
States" to try to implement this
method.
Although he expressed doubt
about the United States' ability
to solve the problem of black
poverty, Kofi said he has high
hopes that this will not be the
case in other countries with climb
ing black poverty rates, such as
South Africa.
"If we are to eliminate the prob
lem of poverty among blacks in
South Africa, we will have to deal
with the issue of redistribution of
resources now. We can't afford to
wait until apartheid has been
revoked to begin to sort out these
issues, or the same problems that
we have in the United States
today might result," he warned.
