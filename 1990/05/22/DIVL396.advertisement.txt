K?
It took Freud 38 years to understand it.
You have one night.
The psych exani is in 12 hours. And your id wants to party. Your ego
wants to conk out. But your superego knows you need to stay awake
tonight to cram.
Fortunately, you've got Vivarin. It helps keep you awake and mentally
alert for hours. Safely and conveniently. So all your brainpower can focus
on understanding the brain.
If Freud had used Vivarin, maybe he could have understood the brain
faster too. Revive with VIVARIN*
