# Sororal, fraternal systems explored
## 
### Rob Baedeker Staff writer 
Leaders from the African-
American letter organizations and
the "mainstream" Greek fraterni
ties and sororities attempted to
dispell some common myths about
their groups at a television taping
last night.
Before a crowd of about 75 stu
dents in Toyon Lounge, two rep
resentatives from each system
explained some characteristics of
their respective groups and
responded to questions at XTV's
taping of the program "Voice," a
talk show in the style of the Oprah
Winfrey Show.
The African-American Frater
nal and Sororital Association
broke away from the Interfrater
nity Council and Intersorority
Council several years ago, and this
division has sometimes come un
der criticism. But senior Magnus
Christon, a member of Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity, emphasized the
importance of having a separate
African-American system, largely
because the African-American or
ganizations are developed around
a cultural theme — something he
said he feels the "mainstream"
systems do not emphasize.
Junior Dereca Blackmon, a
member of the Delta Sigma Theta
sorority, said the African-
American fraternities and sorori
ties were "founded on a cultural
emphasis" and that they concen
trate more on community service
and philanthropy than the main
stream systems.
Students asked the panel
whether they thought their
respective organizations were
elitist or lacked diversity. Senior
Todd Ortega, a member of the
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and
president of the Interfraternity
Council, pointed out that the per-
centage of minorities in the
mainstream fraternity system is
actually greater than that of Stan
ford in general and that the Greek
system's "doors are open to every
one."
Junior Erin Scalley, a member
of Delta Delta Delta sorority and
president of the Intersorority
Council, argued that, contrary to
popular opinion, the mainstream

system's focus is not on alcohol.
Alcohol is the main thing that
people outside the system see, and
most people don't get to look
"behind the scenes" at the
sorority system, she said.
Blackmon said she has a prob
lem with black students who are
members of the mainstream
Greek system and who forget
their responsibilities to the
African-American community.
African-Americans have a
commitment to the rest of their
community, she said.
