# Daily, campus groups discuss recent coverage
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Daily editors met yesterday
with more than 70 members of
campus groups to discuss Friday's
coverage of two related articles
about the League of Revolution
ary Struggle, a nationwide
Marxist-Leninist organization.
Members of the Asian American
Student Association, ASSU Com
mittee on Democracy in Educa
tion, Black Student Union,
MEChA, Stanford Central Amer
ican Action Network, Stanford
American Indian Organization
and others expressed discontent
with The Daily's coverage at the
tense 40-minute meeting.
Editor in Chief John Wagner
told the audience, "It is a learning
process for us to listen to your
ideas. . . . We are interested in
what you have to say." Sunday,
AASA members requested a meet
ing with Daily editors, and Wag
ner agreed.
One article centered on an
anonymous poster distributed
around campus Thursday. The
flier accused Gordon Chang, who
is considering coining to Stanford

as a tenured professor in Asian-
American studies, of being a
leader of the League.
A longer sidebar provided back
ground on the League's activities.
It also stated that "the League
has recruited students within the
various student-of-color organiza
tions on campus."
Several students at the meeting
took issue with the second article's
use of an unspecified number of
unnamed students as its sources.
Judy Wu, an AASA officer, drew
loud applause when she said, "I
for one have fought for Asian-
American studies because I be
lieve in it. I was not duped and
I don't think anyone else was."
Senior Steve Levitsky of
SCAAN said the juxtaposition of
the two stories "legitimizes the
message of the flier." The poster
attacking Chang was apparently
modeled after SCAAN's Project
Awareness posters, which were in
tended to illustrate tactics used
by Central American death
squads.
The poster and its media cov
erage have received.attention be
yond Stanford. A conference of
the national Association for Asian

American Studies held in Santa
Barbara last weekend passed a
resolution condemning the poster
as a "racist, repressive and un
warranted attack against Profes
sor Gordon Chang."
The resolution, which was writ
ten largely by Stanford students
who attended the meeting, urged
Stanford to "punish those respon
sible and work to ensure that such
actions do not recur in the fu
ture."
Further, the statement recog
nized that "the poster and news
paper coverage create an
atmosphere that represses open
discussion and academic freedom
and has a chilling effect on free
dom of thought and academic dis
course." Copies of the resolution
were circulated at the meeting.
Some students saw the article
on the League as part of a larger
phenomenon. "All year long stu
dents of color have been under
attack on this campus, and it is
really paralyzing our communi
ties," said Anna Mata, co-chair of
MEChA. "Any relations that The
Daily had with MEChA are
ruined" because of the innuendo
in the article, she said.

Masao Suzuki, a graduate stu
dent in economics, asked heatedly
near the end of the meeting, "Does
The Daily know about the type
of McCarthyism that went on in
the 1950s?"
Others said they thought the
story reflected biased reporting by
The Daily.
Wagner said it is impossible for
any story to be completely free of
bias but denied that the article
had any "right-wing" or "anti
multicultural" slant, as some stu
dents had suggested.
Students repeatedly asked Wag
ner to outline what future actions
he planned to take in response to
the complaints.
Wagner said he was willing to
meet with concerned parties and
suggested letters to The Daily as
a possible forum for expressing
ideas.
Valerie Mih, an AASA officer
and an at-large member of The
Daily's editorial board, said, "The
Daily has to do more than give a
meeting. ... A correction should
be given the same exposure as
original misinformation."
