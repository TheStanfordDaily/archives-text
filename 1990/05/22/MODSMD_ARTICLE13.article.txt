Israelis continue killing
JABALIYA CAMP, Occupied Gaza Strip
(AP) — Israeli soldiers shot and killed three
Palestinians and wounded as many as 112
yesterday in violence sparked by the massacre
of seven Palestinians by an Israeli civilian a
day earlier.
Smoke from burning tires rose above towns
and reftigee camps in the Gaza Strip, home
to the seven men gunned down Sunday while
waiting for day laborers' jobs in a Tel Aviv
suburb.
Youths on rooftops hurled stones at army
patrols. Women in traditional Palestinian dress
screamed and chanted as wounded victims
were brought to the U.N. clinic in this refugee
camp.
Bush calls for balance
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — President Bush
said yesterday the federal government ought
to strike a "needed balance" between environ
mental priorities and economic concerns.
Addressing a controversial proposal to
protect the northern spotted owl, the president
told a Republican fund-raising breakfast that
he rejects environmentalists who "ignore the
economic consequences" of protecting such
fragile species.
Kashmir forces open fire
SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Security forces
in Kashmir yesterday opened fire on a crowd
of 100,000 mourners carrying the body of a
slain Moslem leader, killing at least 41 people
and wounding 300, officials said.
Earlier yesterday an official source in New
Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity,
gave a different account of the shooting. He
said militants opened fire on paramilitary
troops "and in the cross fire approximately
20 people were killed and 40 were wounded."
Henson funeral held
NEW YORK (AP) - There were happy
songs, upbeat words and a gaggle of Muppet
pals at a memorial service yesterday for Jim
Henson, in accordance with the master pup
peteer's wishes.
Henson, who created the Muppets and used
them to entertain and educate children world
wide on "Sesame Street" and elsewhere, died
Wednesday from pneumonia. He was 53.
Henson had written instructions for his fu
neral four years ago that were opened after
his death. He said he wanted the occasion to
be a happy one and that mourners should not
wear black.
Soviet strike fails
MOSCOW (AP) — A strike by pro-Moscow
forces in Estonia failed to win widespread sup
port yesterday when many workers ignored a
call to walk off the job in protest of the re
public's independence drive.
In Lithuania, lawmakers put together a new
offer aimed at breaking the republic's deadlock
with Moscow.
Soviets send experts
WASHINGTON (AP) — Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev is sending arms experts
here later in the week to resume pre-summit
negotiations to cut long-range nuclear weap
ons, and they will find the Bush administration
in a mood to strike a deal.
The negotiators will take up a half-dozen
issues that were not resolved by Secretary of
State James Baker last week in Moscow. The
aim is to settle as many as they can before
Gorbachev arrives May 30 for summit talks
with President Bush.
Market sets another high
NEW YORK (AP) — The stock market
reached a new high for the fourth time in the
past six sessions yesterday, getting still more

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 24.77 points to 2,844.68, surpassing
the previous closing peak of 2,831.71 it estab
lished last Thursday.
