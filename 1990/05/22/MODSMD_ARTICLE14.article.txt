BETHESDA, Md. (AP) â€” More than
80 AIDS activists were arrested at the
National Institutes of Health yester
day during a demonstration calling for
more AIDS research by government
scientists.
Nearly a thousand protesters draped
red streamers through the trees out
side a number of NIH buildings to
symbolize the red tape of the bureau
cracy that they say is slowing down
work to find a cure for AIDS.
The demonstrators moved from
building to building, chanting slogans
and erecting cardboard head stones on
the lawns of some of the buildings.
Bob Shriver, a spokesman for the
NIH, said about 60 people were ar
rested on trespassing charges at the
main Bethesda campus. He estimated
the crowd at about 900.
Mark Harrington of the New York
based AIDS Coalition To Unleash
Power, ACT UP, said the activists want
NIH to put more emphasis on drugs
that fight the opportunistic infections
that kill AIDS patients.
He said they also want more re
search into new anti-viral drugs that
work differently from AZT.
For years AIDS activists had di
rected their criticism at the Food and
Drug Administration, saying health of
ficials there were too slow in approving
new drugs to fight the disease and the
infections it causes.
