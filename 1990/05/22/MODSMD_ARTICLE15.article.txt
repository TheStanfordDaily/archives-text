# Supreme Court allows ban on demonstrations
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday allowed a per
manent ban on demonstrations by an
anti-abortion group that blocked
access to abortion clinics in New York.
It was the second legal setback in two
weeks for Operation Rescue.
The justices, without comment, let
stand a federal judge's order that for
bids Operation Rescue members from
blocking women trying to enter New
York-area abortion clinics.
Operation Rescue members are un
der similar injunctions in other cities.
Yesterday's action came a week after
the high court, by a 5-4 vote, left
intact a similar ban on Operation Res

cue blockades at abortion clinics in
Atlanta.
The court's order in the Atlanta case
was preliminary in nature. The dis
pute had reached the justices as a re
quest for emergency help before Geor
gia courts had finished studying the
controversy.
The four justices who voted to allow
demonstrations in Atlanta said free
speech restrictions should not have
been imposed before Georgia courts
had a chance to rule definitively
The high court rejected a formal
appeal by Operation Rescue after lower
courts ruled definitively against the
group in the New York case.

And, in contrast to the Atlanta case,
there were no dissenting votes yester
day.
Randall Terry, founder of Operation
Rescue, said in a statement about the
ruling: "No court can prohibit us from
rescuing babies.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals last Sept. 20 upheld Ward's in
junction, and became the nation's first
federal appeals court to rule that Op
eration Rescue's tactics violate wom
en's civil rights and are not a type of
protected free speech.
The group's members "were trespas
sers without right, constitutional or
otherwise," the appeals court said.

Among other things, the appeals
court said the Operation Rescue dem
onstrators had violated the Ku Klux
Klan Act's ban on conspiracies which
violate the rights of a "class of per
sons."
"As conspiracies directed against
women are inherently invidious and
repugnant to the notion of equality
for all citizens, they are therefore en
compassed under the act."
Rejecting Operation Rescue's free
speech arguments, the appeals court
said, "Blocking access to public and
private buildings has never been up
held as a proper method of communi
cation in an orderly society."
