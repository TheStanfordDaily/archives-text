Ruling on Mormons
WASHINGTON (AP) - Monies
given directly to Mormon mis
sionaries by the church's members
are not deductible donations under
federal tax law, the Supreme Court
ruled unanimously yesterday.
The court said Congress did not
intend to make such direct contribu
tions tax-deductible.
Ruling against an Idaho couple
who were denied the tax deductions
for subsidizing their two sons' mis
sionary service, the justices resolved
conflicting federal appeals court
rulings that allowed such tax deduc
tions in six states and banned them
in nine states.
Writing for the court, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor said that un

der federal tax law "a taxpayer may
claim a deduction for a charitable
contribution only if the contribution
is made to or for the use of a qualified
organization."
Court orders restitution
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court ruled unanimously yes
terday that defendants can be re
quired to make restitution only for
specific crimes of which they are con
victed, not related alleged offenses.
The justices said a former post of
fice worker in Texas is not required
to pay a bank $90,431 he allegedly
stole through credit card fraud.
The worker, Frasiel L. Hughey,
pleaded guilty to a single count of
credit card fraud specifying only that

more than $1,000 was stolen.
Court rejects appeal
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday rejected an
appeal by a company accused of ille
gal bias for refusing to hire as a
truck driver a Navajo Indian who
used peyote in religious ceremonies.
The court, without comment, let
stand a ruling that the company en
gaged in illegal discrimination even
though it offered to hire the man
after he complained to New Mexico
officials.
The justices last month ruled there
is no constitutional right to take
peyote as a religious practice. The
court in that case upheld decisions
by Oregon officials denying unem

ployment benefits to two fired drug
counselors who took peyote in Native
American Church ceremonies.
Labeling laws upheld
WASHINGTON (AP) - States
may impose labeling and reporting
requirements on liquor sold at U.S.
military bases within their borders,
the Supreme Court ruled yesterday.
The court said North Dakota's
regulation of liquor sold at two mil
itary bases there does not violate a
clause of the Constitution which gen
erally gives federal policy priority
over state regulations.
The high court upheld the labeling
regulation by a 5-4 vote and the
reporting rule, 9-0.
