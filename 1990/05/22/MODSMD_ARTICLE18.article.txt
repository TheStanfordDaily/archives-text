### 
McCarthyesque fliers
stifle an atmosphere
of free and open debate

The anonymous flier
accusing Prof. Gordon
Chang of membership in a
secret Marxist-Leninist group is
the worst type of slime — it's
McCarthyesque slander by in
nuendo.
Although the flier is protected
under the First Amendment, it
combines the worst aspects of free
speech: unsubstantiated,
defamatory comments by an indi
vidual (or group of individuals)
who will not even put his or her
name on the paper.
That's shameful.
The University should strongly
condemn this flier and the use of
those types of red-baiting tactics.
In addition, it is important to
repair the damage now done to
Chang and the Asian-American
community.
The flier does not mention
Chang's highly distinguished schol
arship and academic credentials.
He is admired and respected in
academic circles, and the United
States government grants him
high-level security clearance. *
The search committee for the
newly created Asian-American
studies tenure-track position
reviewed Chang's credentials and
found him, along with another pro
fessor, to be an excellent scholar
and utterly qualified for that po
sition.
Years of planning, thought and
discussion went into the creation
of a tenure-track Asian-American
studies professorship. The out
come of the process was desirable

for both the Asian-American com
munity and the Stanford commu
nity as a whole.
And despite the ill feelings
Chang feels toward Stanford be
cause of this controversy, we hope
that he will still decide to come to
Stanford. It would be unfortunate
if this incident deterred qualified
people of color from accepting
professorships here.
This episode represents another
chapter in the continuing struggle
of students of color organizations
on campus.
Students should not have the im
pression that these groups are con
trolled by the League of
Revolutionary Struggle. The impli
cation that these groups and their
statewide alliances are "dupes" and
"front groups" for a secretive
Marxist-Leninist organization in
sults the intelligence and
commitment of students involved
in those groups and demeans the
progress and advancements they
have made on this campus.
It also attempts to negate the
positive advancements the groups
have made for all students at Stan
ford.
These groups have been success
ful at promoting educational
reform at Stanford and elsewhere.
Their work is both legitimate and
important, and students must re
spect their accomplishments.
Yet the insinuation by some
seems to be that all students of
color who talk about socialism or
communism are members of the
League of Revolutionary Struggle.
Nothing could be further from
the truth.
This campus must live up to its
potential as a university, a place
where ideas are debated freely and
exchanged openly.
McCarthyesque fliers like the
ones distributed last week only
harm that type of atmosphere.
