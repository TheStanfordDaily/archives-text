University's hiring methods are inconsistent, unfair

TWENTY-ONE Stanford food
service employees were laid off
May 11 with one day's notice.
We, as English tutors with the Stan
ford Literacy Improvement Project, had
contact with some of these people and
find Stanford's methods inconsistent
and unfair and its hiring philosophy
questionable.
These individuals were hired as
temporary employees and contract
regulations stipulate that a temporary
employee working 20 or more hours
more per week cannot work for more
than four months. However, most of
the individuals let go had been working
for longer than four months and some
for more than three years. Why were
contract regulations ignored?
These temporary employees were
kept on by their managers because
they were responsible and worked

hard. Now Stanford will have to hire
and retrain the people to take their
places. This cycle of temporaries is
wasteful. Why not create a few perma
nent positions?
These firings also have a dire and
immediate effect on those who were
fired. Now these people must try to
pay the bills and put food on the table
while looking for work. In addition, the
morale in the kitchens at Stanford is
low because of the disregard that these
workers received.
In at least one hall, one out of two
dining rooms is closed while new
workers are hired. Our English classes
have been cut short, and we, like the
students in the dorms who got to
know those who were fired, feel that
we have lost some of our friends.
Stanford is sending a very negative
message to its students and the com-

munity at large as to what is a socially
responsible way to run an organiza
tion.
We demand to know what is going
on here. Is Stanford trying to avoid
the benefits and United Stanford
Workers union membership which
permanent status gives to workers? We
challenge the University to reevaluate
its system since this recent occurrence
points to serious problems.
Ideally, we would like to see all
workers who are hired temporarily get
the chance to become permanent em
ployees after their four months are up.
Most work that these people do does
not stop needing to be done at the end
of four months.
At the very least, the four-month
limit must be applied fairly and consis
tently, so as to avoid lulling the

workers into thinking that their jobs
are more permanent than they are,
since it is easy to lose sight of one's
temporary status even after three
months, let alone three years. This can
be done by simply reminding them of
their temporary status, thereby allow
ing them to be at least semi-ready to
pursue other work.
It is time to break this cycle of
unfairness and waste. Stanford has the
work; it should exercise some responsi
bility and hire a set of employees to do
it on a permanent basis.
