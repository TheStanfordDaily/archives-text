# Article insinuates action, intentions without evidence

Why did the League of Revolutionary
Struggle article make the front (or
any) page of the May 18 Daily? To
find that article in The Stanford
Review would have been amusing, but
to see it printed on the front page of
The Daily was a rude shock.
The Daily seems to hope that bluster
and cold-war scare tactics will frighten
readers into ignoring the fact that the
entire article is nothing but smoke and
spy lenses. It insinuates a great deal
without producing a shred of evidence.
How the information was secured from
a "highly secretive nationwide organi
zation" is left unclear.

The not-so-subtle accusation that
labor unions, student of color groups
and progressive student groups have all
been infiltrated by outside agitators is
unfounded and designed to sow suspi
cion. The insinuation that ASSU travel
money was spent on Marxist-Leninists
bent on destroying our proud country
(Hands over hearts or else!) is likewise
a little too McCarthyesque to be funny.
By the way, who cares that Unity mag
azine is bilingual? Does that make it
more dangerous or, more importantly,
more likely to be subversive?
I did, however, like the assertion
that students recruited by the league
were often unaware of the recruitment
process. The subtle logistics of this
insidious operation certainly guarantee
secrecy, but I fail to understand their
efficacy. The incriminatory use of k Se
phrase "study groups" would also have
been laughable if it weren't so chilling.
I have been in a number of "study
groups." Does that mean I am at risk

of being a Marxist-Leninist?
Probably not. I doubt I could pass
the essay test to get in. I'd send them
my SATs, but they're a secret organi
zation and I couldn't find a school
code to send scores to.
