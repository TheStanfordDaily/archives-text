# Violations to be examined from a Palestinian view
## 
### 
I am disappointed by the partisan
and incomplete nature of the May 16
article "Presentations on spring break
trip to Israel provoke controversy." The
human rights delegation was, first of
all, a trip to Israel, the West Bank and
Gaza.
Furthermore, the aim of this delega
tion was to examine human rights

violations from a Palestinian perspec
tive. I cite this from the third para
graph of the article, which proceeds to
present the Jewish community's reac
tion to on-campus presentations.
The word "controversy" implies a
two-sided issue. However, the article
examines neither the Palestinian com
munity's reaction nor the Stanford
community's reaction to the trip and
the presentations. Such a partisan arti
cle for The Daily is unacceptable be
cause The Daily rejected publication of
the group's own summary of its trip
and conclusions.
In addition, The Daily failed to in
form the general community about the
trip, which was even covered in a half
hour discussion by KZSU, and also
failed to cover any of the presenta
tions. This only hinders productive and
intellectual discussions between the
human rights delegation and the rest
of the Stanford community.
