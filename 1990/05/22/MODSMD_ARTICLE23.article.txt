## Mainstream conservatism? 
### 
THE STANFORD COLLEGE Re
publicans, purported champions of
free and vigorous debate, have
lately produced nothing of the sort. In
stead, they have only displayed a spirit
of intolerance in speaking out about is
sues concerning the gay community. Such
an attitude will curry no favor on this
campus, and rightfully so.
It is disheartening that this group
traditionally chooses Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week to show its insensitivity
in full flush. It is especially unfortunate
that the College Republicans seek to
spread fear and disinformation about the
AIDS epidemic. I think it is important
to never lose sight of the fact that this
incurable disease is nothing less than a
tragedy.
There are certain sectors of American
public opinion which believe that AIDS
is divinely inspired punishment cast upon
homosexuals for their immoral and un
seemly lifestyle. Armed with a sense of
self-righteousness and a few choice words
from the Bible, these same people take
it upon themselves to use AIDS to
produce punitive legislation which is
founded upon nothing more than their
dislike of homosexuality and homosexu
als.
Quite frankly, I see unmistakable
tinges of this mentality among the College
Republicans. In a recent debate, Keith
Rabois railed against the Democratic no
tion that "a homosexual lifestyle is as
valid as a heterosexual one." This great
disparger of the "Looney Left" seems to
suggest that one's personal views on

homosexuality belong in the realm of
public policy debate and should serve as
the basis for governmental action.
This is a dangerous notion. While one
is certainly free to believe that homo
sexuality is a sin or that this sort of
lifestyle is unacceptable, these beliefs
should never be used to deny the
legitimate rights of gays and lesbians. If
it is the aim of the College Republicans
to "invalidate" homosexuality through
the political process, then I can see no
other consequence but the denial of these
rights.
I see it as a distressing sign that the
College Republicans seem to be aligning
themselves with the wing of the Repub
lican Party which borders on homopho
bic. John Abbott, chair of the Stanford
College Republicans, in his April 27 letter
to The Daily, claims that his party "ad
heres to mainstream conservatism, as
stipulated by the National Republican
Party Platform."
We may properly ask whether this
"mainstream conservatism" is the con
servatism of individuals like Jesse Helms.
Just recently, Helms launched a furious
campaign to torpedo a bill which called
for setting up a national registry of hate
crimes. In this case, good sense won out;
the bill was passed overwhelmingly by
the Senate and was signed by President
Bush. But we may ask if the College
Republicans are willing to embrace an
ideology of monumental intolerance as
espoused by the Jesse Helms wing of the
Republican Party.
The College Republicans aspire to in

vigorate the quality of debate and dis
cussion at Stanford, to present an
"alternate view," as it were. However, I
have seen little more than the pedantic
dogmatism of which they accuse their
ideological rivals. Worse still, their con
tribution to the understanding of issues
often consists of snide comments and ig
noble hit-and-run tactics.
The whole incident of the Republicans'
video presentation on the AIDS epidemic
was disgraceful. Without commenting on
the content of the presentation, I must
say that the hasty retreat executed by
the College Republicans immediately
after showing a controversial documen
tary is not the mark of an organization
dedicated to free and open debate. I would
be the last to criticize the Republicans
for showing a video with which others
may disagree, but to refuse to discuss it
afterward represents the worst in intel
lectual dishonesty.
Stanford College Republicans, you have
claimed for yourselves the responsibility
of expressing the "alternate view" and
raising the level of campus debate, but
your recent actions have made a mockery
of these pretensions.
