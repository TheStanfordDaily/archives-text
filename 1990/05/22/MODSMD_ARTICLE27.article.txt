After he was a Stegner Fellow
at Stanford in 1958, Wendell
Berry decided to escape New York
literary life and return to eastern
Kentucky, where his parents,
grandparents and great
grandparents had been farmers.
There, from the 75-acre hillside
he chose to cultivate, he has writ
ten passionately about the life of
a modern-day yeoman.
Berry is especially known as an
outspoken conservationist who
calls on his readers to restructure
their lives on the model of the
self-sufficient agrarian. A poet,
novelist, essayist and professor,
his work explores culture and
community, love and labor, land
and nature and tradition and in
dividual responsibility.
Many American writers have
examined similar themes. The
agrarian ideal of self-reliance has
been one of the most important
sources of inspiration in United
States cultural and intellectual
history. Many writers have echoed
Thomas Jefferson's remark in
"Notes on the State of Virginia"
that: "The mobs of great cities
add just so much to the support
of pure government as sores do
to the strength of the human

body." Berry is just a small part
of a cultural continuum that in
cludes Hector St. John de
Crdvecoeur, Henry David
Thoreau, John Burroughs, Robert
Penn Warren and Gary Snyder.
But Berry's work advances that
agrarian tradition in significant
ways, translating it into a modern
political context and overcoming
both the misty abstractions of the
transcendentalists and the narcis
sism of the counterculture.
"What Are People For?" pro
vides an excellent introduction to
that work. The 210-page paper
back collection subtly explores
most of the major themes of
Berry's writing. The 22 lucid,
deliberate essays collected in the
volume include an autobiographi
cal reflection about the relation
of people to nature ("Damage"),
an incisive piece of literary
criticism ("A Poem of Difficult
Hope"), a tribute to Wallace Steg
ner ("Wallace Stegner and the
Great Community"), discussions
of the politics of food ("The Plea
sure of Eating"), the cultural sig
nificance of computers ("Why I
am Not Going to Buy a Comput
er") and the need for writers to
cultivate a sense of place ("A Work
of Local Culture").
Berry laments the fragmenta
tion of small rural communities
on both moral and material
grounds. The culture of moder
nity, according to Berry, has made
it difficult for citizens to live

meaningful lives — lives con
nected to the rhythm of the land
and redeemed by honest labor —
and has allowed irresponsible out
siders to threaten the earth with
environmental catastrophe.
Only by seizing control of our
own experience, he writes, only
by reducing our dependence on
the economy of modern industrial
society and embracing old values
of family, community, religion and
work, can we avoid both spiritual
mediocrity and ecological ruin.
Berry's iconoclastic environmen
talism is based on a staunch
traditionalism.
If you read "What Are People
For?," expect to have your beliefs,
even your entire life, radically
challenged. Berry saves some of
his most virulent criticism to at
tack the modern university. You
may feel as if you're reading from
within the belly of a beast.
But keep reading. What Berry
writes of environmental writer
and gadfly Edward Abbey could
just as well be said of him: "The
quality in him that I most prize,
the one that removes him from
the company of writers I respect
and puts him in the smaller com
pany of writers I love, is that he
sees the gravity, the great danger,
of the predicament we are now
in. He tells unswervingly, and he
defends unflinchingly the heritage
and the qualities that may
preserve us."
