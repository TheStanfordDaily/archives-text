A Moscow physicist recently
told me a story that summarily
illustrates current Soviet atti
tudes toward what we call
feminism.
Sitting one day with a circle of
woman friends, she asked them
what they thought about the idea
of a women's movement. One, a
doctor, replied that the women's
movement should conduct women
back to the home to raise their
families. The second answered
with a question: "Why? How are
we oppressed more than anyone
else?" And the last said, "Great
idea. What we need is to get rid
of our male politicians. Only
women can competently govern.
We all know that; just look at our
husbands. Let's start a women's
party and run in the local elec
tions!"
The study of Soviet women and
the values that shape their lives
represents a fascinating and im
portant challenge to Western
feminists and the cultural under
standing of the Soviet Union.
"Soviet Women: Walking the
Tightrope," is a rare investigation
of how the behavior and
representations of women and
men in Soviet culture affect the
social fabric and shape the indi
vidual experience.
In "Soviet Women," Francine
du Plessix Gray indirectly, but
persistently, challenges and in
quires into the essence of feminist
thought and practice by interpret
ing Soviet women's lives through
their own words. And as she notes
in one chapter, American and So
viet women seem to be "traveling
in precisely opposite directions."
One of the most prominent con
temporary Soviet writers, Tatiana
Tolstaia, says about U.S.
feminism: "But how can we un
derstand your American
feminists? The few I've talked to
tell me that they're fighting for
the right to work in coal mines.
My dear, Russian women are
fighting not to work in coal
mines!"
This book is not an exhaustive
study, but an engaging collection
of interviews with Soviet women,
and some men, that insightfully
introduces the spirit and culture
of Soviet women. She speaks with
women from all professions
(except, conspicuously and un
fortunately, prostitutes and poli
ticians), all ages and almost every
region of the country.
Gray's writing is clear, lyrical
and kind. It is accessible to any
reader, but it does not over
simplify. She combines her expe
rienced journalistic skills with a
poetic sincerity that comes from
writing about something she loves
and has known since childhood.
In the best tradition of feminist
cultural study, she locates herself
in her text. Raised in Paris by a
Russian grandmother, Gray's
tender familiarity with the culture
animates her writing and her in
teraction with the women she in

troduces.
Previously seen as socially
divisive and subversive to Marxist
class theory, gender analysis and
discussion of women's experiences
are only recently emerging as top
ics of public debate in the Soviet
Union. Since 1917, when 40,000
women marched in Moscow de
manding women's suffrage,
women have been prohibited from
collective action by the Soviet gov
ernment's censure of any
"feminist" movement outside of
state control.
Due to several decades of cul
tural isolation and intentional
state slandering of the Western
women's movement, Soviets are
uninformed and distrustful of
Western feminism. The words
"feminism" and "feministka"
carry such negative connotations
among Soviet men and women,
that Gray "banned [them] from
[her] vocabulary."
Soviets have never had access
to the most basic feminist texts;
Virginia Woolf, Simone de
Beauvoir and Betty Friedan are
still not translated nor available.
Within the last two years, for the
first time since the 19205, words
such as "abortion," "menstrua
tion" and "prostitution" have ap
peared in the state-run press. Just
over a decade ago, four women
were exiled for their co
authorship of the first "feminist"
journal, of which they had
produced only 10 mimeographed
copies.
However, as Gray notes, many
Soviet women speak and act like
our most vigorous feminists, with
their "extraordinary balancing
acts of work and family and their
awesome self-assurance."
It is this paradox that makes
the book, and the relationship be
tween U.S. and Soviet women, so
complex and interesting.
For many years, Western
feminists celebrated the constitu
tionally guaranteed equality of So
viet men and women and the
state-guided elevation of Soviet
women from traditional, domestic
roles into the work force.
For instance, it is widely known
and touted that the majority of
doctors (77 percent) are women
and that the employment rate for
women in the Soviet Union is one
of the highest in the world (93
percent). But it is less well known,
however, that doctors are among
the lowest-paid workers, that
most surgeons are men and that
women earn on average 30 percent
less than men.
The overburdened, meager lives
of Soviet women are nothing to
glorify. Soviet statistics report
that women sleep two hours less
than men each night on average.
If they can be found at all, con
traceptive devices are poorly made
and often dangerous — the only
diaphragms produced in the So
viet Union are metal, and the con
doms almost always break. The
Soviet Union has the highest
abortion rate in the world, with
estimates of five to eight abor
tions for every birth.
Gray's painful account of the
birthing ward and the abortion
clinic are vivid indictments of the
skewed priorities of the

centralized state planning. The
government's neglect of human
needs has affected all Soviets'
lives, but particularly those of
women, who are still primarily re
sponsible for child rearing and
running the household.
Soviet women's lives are some
of the most difficult in the world.
And although Soviet women are
among the most resilient, most
self-assured and most powerful
women in the world, their lives
and social roles are not products
of choice, but of circumstance and
state mandate.
The government-enforced
emancipation and authorized
equality of women in the Soviet
Union has not been philosophi
cally based on the primacy of self
determination and autonomy, but
rather on economic demand or po
litical expediency.
As Soviet historian Elvira
Novikova says in "Soviet Women'':
"True equality is the ability to
choose."
This understanding and man
date is the centerpiece of U.S.
feminism, in my view. For this
reason, I expect that Western
feminism can have great
relevance to the social changes
now convulsing the Soviet Union.
But, it won't be well received un
less it is combined with a deep
understanding of Soviet history
and the contemporary, im
poverished state of Soviet life.
Gray brilliantly describes the
tight mother-daughter bonds that
are the backbone of Soviet life.
She evocatively conveys, through-'
out the book, the deep aesthetic,
spiritual, moral consciousness
that is identified with women and
expected of them. This nurturing,
savvy, devoted nature appears
again and again in her cast of
women.
This book is a very significant
piece of contemporary history. It
records women's experience in
world history, which in itself is a
noteworthy and creditable task.
But even more, this book is an
example of the cultural study that
was a prisoner of the Cold War.
I optimistically hope we can look
forward to more like it.
"Soviet Women" should be read
by both those who know very little
about the Soviet Union and by
those who study it. Especially for
those new to the subject, it may
be particularly frustrating or sur
prising reading. The tendency to
imagine one's enemy as oneself
has affected and misinformed, I
believe, our understanding of the
Soviets and created a false
familiarity between our cultures.
Just because we have similar
weapons does not mean we lead
similar lives nor share similar his
tories. Gray deftly negotiates and
examines differences.
Although she incompletely dis
cusses the influence of economic
class on the lives of Soviet women
and completely leaves out an ex
amination of violence against
women, Gray's work is a model
of sound feminist reportage and
anthropology. It sparks and
satisfies curiosity, and it is a
respectful, lively introduction to
an important and engrossing sub
ject.

Soviet Women: Walking the
Tightrope

Reviewed by Susan McKean
A Moscow physicist recently
told me a story that summarily
illustrates current Soviet atti
tudes toward what we call
feminism.
Sitting one day with a circle of
woman friends, she asked them
what they thought about the idea
of a women's movement. One, a
doctor, replied that the women's
movement should conduct women
back to the home to raise their
families. The second answered
with a question: "Why? How are
we oppressed more than anyone
else?" And the last said, "Great
idea. What we need is to get rid
of our male politicians. Only
women can competently govern.
We all know that; just look at our
husbands. Let's start a women's
party and run in the local elec
tions!"
The study of Soviet women and
the values that shape their lives
represents a fascinating and im
portant challenge to Western
feminists and the cultural under
standing of the Soviet Union.
"Soviet Women: Walking the
Tightrope," is a rare investigation
of how the behavior and
representations of women and
men in Soviet culture affect the
social fabric and shape the indi
vidual experience.
In "Soviet Women," Francine
du Plessix Gray indirectly, but
persistently, challenges and in
quires into the essence of feminist
thought and practice by interpret
ing Soviet women's lives through
their own words. And as she notes
in one chapter, American and So
viet women seem to be "traveling
in precisely opposite directions."
One of the most prominent con
temporary Soviet writers, Tatiana
Tolstaia, says about U.S.
feminism: "But how can we un
derstand your American
feminists? The few I've talked to
tell me that they're fighting for
the right to work in coal mines.
My dear, Russian women are
fighting not to work in coal
mines!"
This book is not an exhaustive
study, but an engaging collection
of interviews with Soviet women,
and some men, that insightfully
introduces the spirit and culture
of Soviet women. She speaks with
women from all professions
(except, conspicuously and un
fortunately, prostitutes and poli
ticians), all ages and almost every
region of the country.
Gray's writing is clear, lyrical
and kind. It is accessible to any
reader, but it does not over
simplify. She combines her expe
rienced journalistic skills with a
poetic sincerity that comes from
writing about something she loves
and has known since childhood.
In the best tradition of feminist
cultural study, she locates herself
in her text. Raised in Paris by a
Russian grandmother, Gray's
tender familiarity with the culture
animates her writing and her in
teraction with the women she in

troduces.
Previously seen as socially
divisive and subversive to Marxist
class theory, gender analysis and
discussion of women's experiences
are only recently emerging as top
ics of public debate in the Soviet
Union. Since 1917, when 40,000
women marched in Moscow de
manding women's suffrage,
women have been prohibited from
collective action by the Soviet gov
ernment's censure of any
"feminist" movement outside of
state control.
Due to several decades of cul
tural isolation and intentional
state slandering of the Western
women's movement, Soviets are
uninformed and distrustful of
Western feminism. The words
"feminism" and "feministka"
carry such negative connotations
among Soviet men and women,
that Gray "banned [them] from
[her] vocabulary."
Soviets have never had access
to the most basic feminist texts;
Virginia Woolf, Simone de
Beauvoir and Betty Friedan are
still not translated nor available.
Within the last two years, for the
first time since the 19205, words
such as "abortion," "menstrua
tion" and "prostitution" have ap
peared in the state-run press. Just
over a decade ago, four women
were exiled for their co
authorship of the first "feminist"
journal, of which they had
produced only 10 mimeographed
copies.
However, as Gray notes, many
Soviet women speak and act like
our most vigorous feminists, with
their "extraordinary balancing
acts of work and family and their
awesome self-assurance."
It is this paradox that makes
the book, and the relationship be
tween U.S. and Soviet women, so
complex and interesting.
For many years, Western
feminists celebrated the constitu
tionally guaranteed equality of So
viet men and women and the
state-guided elevation of Soviet
women from traditional, domestic
roles into the work force.
For instance, it is widely known
and touted that the majority of
doctors (77 percent) are women
and that the employment rate for
women in the Soviet Union is one
of the highest in the world (93
percent). But it is less well known,
however, that doctors are among
the lowest-paid workers, that
most surgeons are men and that
women earn on average 30 percent
less than men.
The overburdened, meager lives
of Soviet women are nothing to
glorify. Soviet statistics report
that women sleep two hours less
than men each night on average.
If they can be found at all, con
traceptive devices are poorly made
and often dangerous — the only
diaphragms produced in the So
viet Union are metal, and the con
doms almost always break. The
Soviet Union has the highest
abortion rate in the world, with
estimates of five to eight abor
tions for every birth.
Gray's painful account of the
birthing ward and the abortion
clinic are vivid indictments of the
skewed priorities of the

centralized state planning. The
government's neglect of human
needs has affected all Soviets'
lives, but particularly those of
women, who are still primarily re
sponsible for child rearing and
running the household.
Soviet women's lives are some
