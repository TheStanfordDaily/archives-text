## Cardinal netters conquer Men of Troy to reach finals Solomon hangs in to win for Card 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. -
Glenn Solomon is never the first
one off the court.
In the 100-pluB degree heat of
the California desert, Solomon
has played two matches which
have both lasted over three hours.
Yesterday's match lasted for three
hours, 45 minutes.
And Solomon hasn't been lol
ligagging around the court for the
past two days either. His game is
one of attrition: wear out the
other guy, run down every ball,
hit from side to side, dive, scratch,
claw, hit hard, hit soft, hit flat,
lob, pass and slice.
Yesterday, Solomon did all
those things and more as he out
lasted USC's Martin Dionne 3-6,
7-6, 6-3. The match gave Stanford
a crucial 4-2 lead in the dual score,
and Solomon, who had literally
collapsed into the arms of Asst.
Coach John Whitlinger, received
a standing ovation from the 400
spectators who had gathered
around court No. 4.
All Whitlinger could say to
Solomon after the match was:
"Unbelievable. Absolutely unbe
lievable."
"I was really exhausted,"
Solomon said after the marathon
match. "The thing that kept me
going was that I knew I only had
one more set to play. I promised
myself I wouldn't have anything
left at the end of that match. I
didn't."
Solomon was down the whole
match against Dionne. After
losing the first set, Solomon was
forced to break Dionne at 4-5 in
the second. In the second-set tie
breaker, Dionne actually had a

match point at 6-5, but Solomon
hit a deep ball to Dionne's back
hand which the USC freshman
sprayed long.
Solomon went on to win the
tiebreaker 9-7.
In the third set, Solomon
jumped out to an early 4-2 lead.
He did it by doing something out
of the ordinary — coming to the
net.
"I try to adapt to whatever the
situation calls for," Solomon said.
"I'll stay back if that's what it
takes, or I'll come in. I sensed
that he was getting a bit weary,
so I came in more. I also was
getting a little tired on some of

those long points."
Solomon ended up winning the
match at 5-3 on a leaping back
hand volley which bounced over
Dionne's head.
Although yesterday's comeback
third-set win was amazing, it
wasn't unusual. "It was basically
a carbon copy of what happened
in Sunday's match," Whitlinger
said. "Solomon just keeps grind
ing and grinding. He never gives
you an easy point."
Indeed, Solomon pulled the
same heroics Sunday against
Texas' No. 5 player Hubert Kar
rasch, losing the first set but com
ing back to win the match 4-6,

6-3, 6-3.
His win against Karrasch
clinched Stanford's quarterfinal
victory over Texas.
After both wins, Solomon was
so exhausted from the heat and
the intensity that he was barely
able to talk.
"We've won about four or five
key dual matches when Solomon
has been down and come back to
win," Coach Dick Gould said.
"He's the guy you want to lay a
bet on when the chips are down.
If you are ever going to beat
Solomon, you are going to have
to play awfully well to do it. He's
one of the best team players ever."
