## Views role as facilitator, emphasizes cooperation and compromise

When freshmen arrive on campus for Orientation,
Solina Kwan will be there to greet them. But she
doesn't expect to greet anyone by the name of Bart
Simpson.
As the newly elected ASSU Senate chair, Kwan
is hoping to put the popular cartoon character to
rest long before the freshmen arrive. A self-described
"Renaissance person," Kwan wants to move the
ASSU into a new era, with restored student confi
dence.
In this year's election for the Council of Presi
dents, the ASSU Elections Commission ruled that
275 write-in votes for fictional characters and in

eligible slates would not be counted. The decision
has sparked controversy about ambiguities in the
ASSU Bylaws.
"Overall, this election has been really damaging
to the whole image of student government," Kwan
says.
But Kwan is a firm believer in the structure of
the ASSU.
"Compared to a lot of universities, the ASSU has
proven that it is a government of the students, by
the students and for the students," she says.
Kwan says one of her top priorities is to revise
the Bylaws to avoid similar problems in next year's
election. She also hopes to produce a weekly update
on ASSU activities.
