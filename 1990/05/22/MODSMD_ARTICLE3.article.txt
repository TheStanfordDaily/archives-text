# Kwan believes in ASSU structure
## Views role as facilitator, emphasizes cooperation and compromise

When freshmen arrive on campus for Orientation,
Solina Kwan will be there to greet them. But she
doesn't expect to greet anyone by the name of Bart
Simpson.
As the newly elected ASSU Senate chair, Kwan
is hoping to put the popular cartoon character to
rest long before the freshmen arrive. A self-described
"Renaissance person," Kwan wants to move the
ASSU into a new era, with restored student confi
dence.
In this year's election for the Council of Presi
dents, the ASSU Elections Commission ruled that
275 write-in votes for fictional characters and in

eligible slates would not be counted. The decision
has sparked controversy about ambiguities in the
ASSU Bylaws.
"Overall, this election has been really damaging
to the whole image of student government," Kwan
says.
But Kwan is a firm believer in the structure of
the ASSU.
"Compared to a lot of universities, the ASSU has
proven that it is a government of the students, by
the students and for the students," she says.
Kwan says one of her top priorities is to revise
the Bylaws to avoid similar problems in next year's
election. She also hopes to produce a weekly update
on ASSU activities.
A former senate associate,
Kwan finishes her term as a
People's Platform senator today.
She will begin to work with stu
dent government from a whole
new perspective next week.
Kwan is the first woman elected
to be senate chair, to her partial
surprise. "When you look at the
opposition I was running against,
there were four white males and
me.
"I think it shows how forward
thinking the 21st Senate is in
being able to go beyond what they
might believe to be the typical
senate chair," Kwan says. "If I'm
effective . . . more women will
want to seek this position."
Kwan adds that events of this
year have lent new importance to
women's issues, requiring more
action by student government.
"The role of a senate chair is
to be a facilitator," Kwan explains.
"It lies in that person's ability to
voice opinion and to judge when
voicing opinion would hinder
achievement of a common goal."
"Everybody has a viewpoint,

(but) I think affiliation with any
group doesn't necessarily mean
that person can't be an objective
facilitator."
Kwan says she wants to em
phasize cooperation and compro
mise.
Kwan has high hopes that an
upcoming summit with represen
tatives from campus student
groups will result in targeting ob
jectives that the entire ASSU will
work to achieve. The forum, ini
tiated by the COP-elect, has been
tentatively planned to take place
June 1.
"Essentially, everyone has com
mon goals," Kwan says. "We're
all in it together to make Stanford
the best it can be. What we need
now is better communication."
The possibility of a recall of the
COP has little impact on Kwan
as she prepares for the 21st Sen
ate.
"Regardless of what's going on
with the executive branch, we
have to continue to respond to
the immediate needs of the stu
dents and work with the COP
elect," she says.
Kwan was raised in a "very po
litical neighborhood" in Virginia,
with many parents working on
Capitol Hill. In high school, she

was on the basketball and tennis
teams, but she hasn't kept up
with those sports at Stanford.
"I wonder why," she jokes.
Double-majoring in history and
economics, Kwan is still keeping
her post-graduation options open.
Currently, she is contemplating
several post-graduate degrees.
"I love being a student, so I
wouldn't mind being a full-time
student," she said.
