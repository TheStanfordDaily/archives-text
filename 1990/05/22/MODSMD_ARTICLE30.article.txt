T et's play a little game here.
â–  J.( Everyone out.there.pull
11 i J out a No. 2 pencil and write
down which of these records don't
belong in this group: 52-10, 15-31,
47-12, 37-22, 46-20 and 42-13.
Time's up! Pencils down!
Those of you who selected
choice B, 15-31, congratulations.
For the rest of you, maybe you
should get an early start on study
ing for your Calc 41 final.
Those six records belong to the
six teams selcted to participate in
the NCAA West I Baseball Re
gional, beginning this Thursday
at Sunken Diamond. And if you
show up around 4 p.m. Thursday,
you will get to see the 52-10 Car
dinal, currently ranked No. 1 in
the nation, meet the Campbell
University Fighting Camels, the
possessors of that 15-31 mark.
Thanks to the wonder of auto
matic bids to NCAA postseason
events, the Fighting Camels sur
vived a 17-game losing streak, a
5-25 start to their season and an
18-1 loss to noted powerhouse
North Carolina-Asheville.
Yes, that's right. UNC-
Asheville.
They finished their season by

defeating Baptist, Radford,
Winthrop and Coastal Carolina,
over a four-day period, to win the
Big South Conference tournament
and get the league's automatic
bid. But while some people say
that's what's wrong with the
NCAA baseball, and also basket
ball, tournament, I say that's
what's right about it.
No matter how dismal a
season your team has, no
matter how many games
you lose or how badly you lose
them, if your league has a tour
nament, you have a chance to go
to the postseason.
It's a good way to do it, because
it's fair. When you have nine guys
sit in a hotel room in Kansas City
and pick what they think are the
48 best teams in the country, it
can lead to a lot of bitterness.
There are always teams complain
ing that they should have been in
the tournament but were left out
for some reason.
For teams in the Big South,
however, it is more cut and dried.
You play in the postseason tour
nament. If you win it, you go to
the NCAA tournament; if you

don't, too bad.
Now the players for Coastal
Carolina, the Big South regular
season champs, are probably up
set that they didn't get selected
to play in the big show. But they
got to play the conference tour
nament on their home field and
they lost, fair and square.
If you lose twice in the regional
you don't get to go to the College
World Series. If you lose twice in
the CWS, you don't get to be
NCAA champs.
So if you lose in the league tour
ney, why should you get to go to
the regional, unless you had a
great year. The automatic bid rule
serves only to effectively allow
more teams to play in the NCA/
tourney.

But how much of a chance
does Campbell have to do
well in the regional?
It all depends on what you con
sider. If you look at their stats
over the course of the season, the
Fighting Camels don't look so hot.
For starters, they have been
outscored in every inning except
the first. They have compiled a
.260 team batting average
(compared to Stanford's .318).
Their team ERA is an alarming
5.70 (Stanford's is 3.85) and they
have made 115 errors in 46 games
(the Cardinal has made 69 in 62).
Campbell hit 10 home runs as a
team in 42 regular-season games
while Stanford third baseman
Tim Griffin has 21 by himself this
year.
The Camels' three top starters
are 4-8, 3-8 and 3-8 while the
Cardinal has pitchers with records
like 13-1, 12-3, 8-1, 6-2 and 5-1.
So from this perspective, it would
appear that there will be a blow
out of epic proportions Thursday
afternoon.
Despite that, I plan to be there
to watch the game, and you should
too.
