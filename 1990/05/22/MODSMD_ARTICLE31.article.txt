# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
You don't have to win both team and
individual NCAA championships in the space
of a five days to be selected as The Daily's
Athlete of the Week, but it sure helps.
On the other hand, sometimes doing
something outstanding but also rather
bizarre can give a Stanford athlete the pres
tigious honor. Such aa collecting eight hits
in three games, seven of them doubles.
For those achievements, respectively, we

here at the Daily are proud to announce
that Debbie Graham and Troy Paulsen are
this week's big winners.
Graham, who garnered the same recogni
tion three weeks ago for her win at the
Pacific 10 Conference Tournament, was sim
ply unstoppable at the NCAA Champion
ships in Gainesville, Fla. After winning four
straight matches to help the Cardinal win
their fifth consecutive team crown, Graham
romped through the singles tournament to
capture Stanford's second consecutive indi
vidual singles NCAA title. She did not drop
a set in her six individual matches.
Ironically, when Graham and partner
Sandra Birch stepped onto the court to play
for the doubles title (only minutes after the
singles final had ended), it was the second
year in a row that the doubles tandem was
playing for a spot in NCAA history. Last
year, Birch had a chance to complete an
unprecedented "triple crown" of the team,
singles, and doubles titles (in one season)
for the first time ever. This year it was
Graham's turn.
However, as occurred last year, she and
Birch were defeated in the final to thwart
history. Nonetheless, with her accomplish
ments last week, Graham carved out a niche
for herself in the annals of the greatest
collegiate tennis players ever.

Paulsen, who was named Six-Pac Player
of the Week two weeks ago, went on a double
rampage over the weekend in the Cardinal's
three-game sweep of UC-Santa Barbara. It

got to the point where, when Paulsen
stepped to the plate, the crowd was shocked
if he didn't end up on second.
The All-Six-Pac second baseman entered
the weekend needing three doubles to break
his own team record of 22, set in 1988. He
got them all right â€” in the first game.
If that wasn't enough, the Fountain Val
ley, Calif., native added three more two
baggers on Saturday and another on Sunday.
