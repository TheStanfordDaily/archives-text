# Stanford meets No. 1 Tennessee today

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. -
Three-peat.
You can hear people whispering
about it at the NCAA tournament
site.
In fact, there seems to be an
odor lurking around the Hyatt
Grand Champions resort these
days â€” the three-peat odor,
they're calling it.
After sneaking by a much
improved and extremely danger
ous USC squad 5-3 yesterday,
two-time defending NCAA cham
pion Stanford now needs only one
more victory to become the first
men's team ever to win three con
secutive NCAA championships
under the present dual-match
format adopted in 1977.

The last team to win three con
secutive NCAA crowns was USC,
which captured four in a row from
1966-1969.
Top-seeded and undefeated Ten
nessee (34-0), which came back
from 4-2 down to win 5-4 in a
dramatic third-set tiebreaker vic
tory at No. 3 doubles against
third-seeded UCLA, stands in the
way of Stanford's quest. UCLA,
which lost yesterday's match on
a double fault by No. 3 doubles
player Bill Behrens, is actually the
last team to beat Stanford in an
NCAA final, defeating the Cardi
nal 5-4 in the 1984 championship.
Despite the magic of this year's
Tennessee squad, many of the
players on Stanford's team are

confident, especially after gritting
out a tough dual against the
Trojans yesterday.
"They're a great team. But if
we play well and concentrate, I
think we should win it," freshman
Alexis Hombrecher said.
Hombrecher was actually the
first person off the court yester
day, as he clobbered USC's No. 6
player Paul Brandt 6-1, 6-3.
"I tried to get on him from the
start," Hombrecher said. "I knew,
if I did that, I would have an
easier time."
The Cardinal's 1-0 lead was
short-lived, however. Senior Jeff
Cathrall, who seems to be in a
slight singles slump, fell to Andras
Lanyi 6-2, 6-2 at No. 4 singles.
Lanyi, who many Stanford
players call the "craftiest" player
on the USC team, frustrated
Cathrall by changing the pace and
by running down every ball.
A half hour later, sophomore
All-American Alex O'Brien gave
Stanford back the lead at 2-1, as
he finished off Donny Isaak 7-5,
6-3 at No. 3 singles.
"I knew that he wasn't going
to miss many balls," O'Brien said.
"So I tried to put some extra pres
sure on him. I came to the net
more than usual."
Freshman Jared Palmer, who
has been one of the most consis
tent Cardinal performers since
coming back from knee surgery
April 26, moved the match score
to 3-1 with a victory over Mehdi
Benyebka, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 at No. 2
singles. Benyebka is Algeria's No.
1 Davis Cup player.
In the second set, Benyebka
seemed to frustrate Palmer with
huge, looping top-spin
groundstrokes.
"I was having some trouble
with his groundstrokes. I wasn't
moving my feet well enough
today," Palmer said. "As the
match wore on, I was trying to
get into the net more and more.
I knew that when the match got
tighter, he would start missing
some of his passing shots. And in
the third set, he did miss a few
more shots than usual."
In only his third match back
from a foot injury, Stanford's No.
1 player Jonathan Stark once
again played beyond expectations.
This time, however, it wasn't
enough.
No. 2-ranked Stark fell to Byron
Black, the No. 4 player in the
country, 7-6, 6-7, 7-5.
Like Sunday, when Stark

upended No. 3-ranked Steve
Bryan of Texas 6-7, 7-5, 6-4, the
Cardinal freshman had numerous
opportunities to close out the
match. But this time he couldn't.
In the first-set tiebreaker, Stark
was serving for the set at 6-5, but
Black hit a return winner down
the line to knot the tiebreaker
and eventually win it 8-6.
In the third set, Stark led 5-2
but ended up losing five straight
games and the match.
"I just wasn't hitting enough
first serves in the end of the
match," Stark said. "[Black] has
a great return, and he showed it
in the third set. I was trying to
do too much with my first serve.
That's probably why I was missing
so many."
With the Cardinal up 3-2 in
singles, all eyes turned to the No.
5 singles match, which pitted
Stanford junior Glenn Solomon
against USC's Martin Dionne.

At that time, Solomon had lost
the first set and was down a
match point at 6-5 in the second
set tiebreaker. But, for the second
day in a row, Solomon fought back
from a set down. He won the
second-set tiebreaker 9-7 and
broke Dionne twice in the third
for a 3-6, 7-6, 6-3 triumph.
Solomon's win put the Cardinal
up 4-2 going into the doubles com
petition. USC was the first team
at the NCAAs to force Stanford
into the doubles.
At No. 2 doubles, the unde
feated team of Cathrall and
Hombrecher seemed to have the
dual match wrapped up. After
losing the first set in a tiebreaker,
the Stanford duo had won the
second set and broken USC's
Isaak and Lanyi to go up 6-5 in
the third.
With Hombrecher serving,
Stanford went up 30-love. But, in

the next four points, Hombrecher
double faulted twice, and USC
forced the match into a third-set
tiebreaker.
The two teams stayed neck-and
neck for most of the tiebreaker,
but the Trojans ended up on top,
8-6.
Moments later, however, Stan
ford's No. 1 doubles team of Stark
and Palmer gave the Cardinal the
dual meet with a 7-5, 7-5 victory
over Black and Brandt.
The doubles match marked the
first time Stark and Palmer had
played together in 52 days.
USC's Kent Seton, the regular
No. 6 singles player and No. 1
doubles player, could not play be
cause of chicken pox.
Today's match will mark the
10th time Stanford has advanced
to the NCAA finals since 1977. It
is Tennessee's first appearance in
the NCAA finals.
