# Stanford meets No. 1 Tennessee today

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. -
Three-peat.
You can hear people whispering
about it at the NCAA tournament
site.
In fact, there seems to be an
odor lurking around the Hyatt
Grand Champions resort these
days â€” the three-peat odor,
they're calling it.
After sneaking by a much
improved and extremely danger
ous USC squad 5-3 yesterday,
two-time defending NCAA cham
pion Stanford now needs only one
more victory to become the first
men's team ever to win three con
secutive NCAA championships
under the present dual-match
format adopted in 1977.

The last team to win three con
secutive NCAA crowns was USC,
which captured four in a row from
1966-1969.
Top-seeded and undefeated Ten
nessee (34-0), which came back
from 4-2 down to win 5-4 in a
dramatic third-set tiebreaker vic
tory at No. 3 doubles against
third-seeded UCLA, stands in the
way of Stanford's quest. UCLA,
which lost yesterday's match on
a double fault by No. 3 doubles
player Bill Behrens, is actually the
last team to beat Stanford in an
NCAA final, defeating the Cardi
nal 5-4 in the 1984 championship.
Despite the magic of this year's
Tennessee squad, many of the
players on Stanford's team are

confident, especially after gritting
out a tough dual against the
Trojans yesterday.
"They're a great team. But if
we play well and concentrate, I
think we should win it," freshman
Alexis Hombrecher said.
Hombrecher was actually the
first person off the court yester
day, as he clobbered USC's No. 6
player Paul Brandt 6-1, 6-3.
"I tried to get on him from the
start," Hombrecher said. "I knew,
if I did that, I would have an
easier time."
The Cardinal's 1-0 lead was
short-lived, however. Senior Jeff
Cathrall, who seems to be in a
slight singles slump, fell to Andras
Lanyi 6-2, 6-2 at No. 4 singles.
Lanyi, who many Stanford
players call the "craftiest" player
on the USC team, frustrated
Cathrall by changing the pace and
by running down every ball.
A half hour later, sophomore
All-American Alex O'Brien gave
Stanford back the lead at 2-1, as
he finished off Donny Isaak 7-5,
6-3 at No. 3 singles.
"I knew that he wasn't going
to miss many balls," O'Brien said.
"So I tried to put some extra pres
sure on him. I came to the net
more than usual."
Freshman Jared Palmer, who
has been one of the most consis
tent Cardinal performers since
coming back from knee surgery
April 26, moved the match score
to 3-1 with a victory over Mehdi
Benyebka, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 at No. 2
singles. Benyebka is Algeria's No.
1 Davis Cup player.
In the second set, Benyebka
seemed to frustrate Palmer with
huge, looping top-spin
groundstrokes.
