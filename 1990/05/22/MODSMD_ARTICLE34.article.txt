# Campbell, four other teams to visit Farm
## 
### 
The Camels tire coming.
That would be the Campbell
University Fighting Camels, who
will be taking on the Stanford
baseball team in the first round
of this weekend's NCAA West I
Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Campbell was one of the 48
teams receiving NCAA bids yes
terday, as announced during a
satellite hookup by the NCAA Se
lection Committee. The Camels,
along with Fresno State, San
Diego State, Southern Illinois,
Middle Tennessee State and host
Stanford, will play at Sunken Dia
mond this weekend for the right
to go to the College World Series
in Omaha, Nebraska.
The double-elimination tourna
ment begins Thursday at 9:00
a.m. and continues through Sun
day. In Thursday'B first game, San
Diego St. (46-20) and Middle Ten
nessee St. (42-13) will square off,
followed by No. 10 Southern Illi
nois (47-12) taking on Fresno St.
(37-22) at noon.
The Camels enter their 4:00
p.m. game against the Cardinal
with a 15-31 record. (No, that is
not a typo. Fifteen and thirty
one.) A week ago the Camels were
more than out of the running for

a postseason bid at 11-31, but
they caught fire in the Big South
Conference tournament, won four
straight and received the league's
automatic NCAA playoff berth.
At one point this season, the
Camels were 5-25 after losing 17
straight games (11 of them at
home), but they enter the tour
nament on a roll.
We are not making this up.
Tickets for the regional went
on sale yesterday at the Athletic
Department and will continue to
be sold throughout the week. All
session passes, which admit the
bearer to games all four days, are
$25 for adults and $16 for stu
dents, senior citizens and children.
Day passes are $10 and $8, and
single-game tickets go for $6 and
$4. Single-game tickets will only
be on sale the day of the game.
Between each game, all specta
tors will be asked to leave the
stadium, and those with all
session passes will re-enter first.
Stanford last hosted a regional
in 1987, the year the Cardinal
first won the national title. The
Cardinal also hosted in 1983 and
1985, and went on to the College
World Series both years.
