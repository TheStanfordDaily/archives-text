Cal adopts new policy
UC-Berkeley's new admissions policy, ap
proved by the academic senate last Septem
ber, has upset faculty and students.
The policy allows the University to admit
more students based on an "academic index"
— a composite of the applicant's grade point
average and admissions test scores — than
it has in the past.
The change in admissions procedure was
made in an effort to diversify the student
body, but critics charge that it will only
increase the number of white and Asian
students admitted to the school.
The student government's Presidential
Commission on Admissions and Affirmative
Action stated, "Meritocracy has historically
existed to thwart any kind of socioeconomic
advancement by people of color."
The policy is expected to take effect in
the fall of 1991.

Gay cadets won't pay ROTC
The two gay cadets who were expelled
from the U.S. Navy's Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps will not be required to pay back
their ROTC scholarships.
One of the students, enrolled at MIT, was
asked to repay $38,000 in scholarship money.
The other, a 1989 graduate of Harvard Uni
versity, was asked to return $50,000.
A similar case involving a Washington
University student who has been asked to
repay $25,000 in scholarship money is still

pending.

Students fast at Princeton
More than 100 students at Princeton Uni
versity recently participated in a 24-hour
fast to commemorate last year's May 13
hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in
Beijing.
Tienne Lee, a co-organizer of the fast,
said, "The goal of the fast is to remember
the Chinese student movement and the mas
sacre on June 4."
John Zuehlke, a sophomore who helped
recruit participants, said he was motivated
to volunteer for the fast out of compassion.
Zuehlke said, "I'm a student, and when a
government slaughters thousands of stu
dents and then publicly denies it to their
own people, we (students) have to stick to
gether."
The fast is part of a nationwide college
effort. The idea originated at the Lincoln
Memorial Protest in Washington, D.C. in
September.

Mark Pritchard, a business economics
msyor at UC-Santa Barbara, has developed
a very successful way to pay his rent.
Last falj, Pritchard, who said his goal is
"to be self-sufficient for the rest of my col
lege years," had an idea — to sell coupons.
This idea has developed into a profitable

business. Pritchard sells coupon books,
redeemable for $35 worth of merchandise,
for $10.
Pritchard's idea was that coupons should
not give discounts but, rather, free products.
With the books, students can give a store a
coupon and immediately get the product.
Ted Schram, a UCSB sophomore, said of
the coupons, "They are a great idea and
real convenient."
Pritchard recommends the entrepreneur
ial life. He said, "Running your own business
is great."

Chicano studies requested
A group of students at UCLA who wish
to improve Chicano studies have requested
that the University create a department for
the mcuor.
The students say they believe creating a
department would help attract Chi
cano/Latino scholars and regulate classes of
fered in the m£yor.
Chancellor Charles Young, though, dis
agrees with the students. He said, "[Chicano
studies! is not the kind of thing that is and
ought to have a department, given the kind
of structure of the university." He said be
cause Chicano studies courses are offered
through other departments, "It's got to be
an interdisciplinary degree."
However, Young said, "I'm open to argu
ment."
