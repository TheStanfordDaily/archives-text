Greif wins in med
student elections
Bill Greif, a second-year

medical student from Berkeley,
was elected yesterday the new
president of the Stanford Med
ical Students Association.
Greif ran unopposed on a
platform of academic reform
and better student communi
cation and cohesion. He said
the Medical School needs more
interactive programs and
teaching assistant involvement
in the classroom because of the
passive teaching style in many
classes.
Greif said he is excited about
the representative part of his
job, such as sitting in on Fac
ulty Senate meetings. "It will
allow me to safeguard student
opinions."
Greif will also be in charge
of an operating budget of
$100,000, which will be ap
propriated to community proj
ects, Medical School groups and
the East Palo Alto AIDS Proj
ect.
Because this year the Medi
cal School is up for accredita
tion, a committee of represen
tatives from many medical
schools will evaluate the school
and its curriculum.
About 200 students, which is
less than 50 percent of the med
ical students enrolled, voted in
the election. The new vice pres
ident is Carlos Caballero, and
the new treasurer is Mike Pan
zara. About 20 officials were
elected altogether.
