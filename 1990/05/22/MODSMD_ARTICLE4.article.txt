# Sasaki unhappy with split Senate
## Says senators should concentrate on small changes over long periods 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
When ASSU Senate Chair Ed
Sasaki took his position last
spring, he expected to see a lot
of cooperation among senators
this year. Instead, he has wit
nessed the senate grow more
splintered and divided as the
ASSU has become increasingly
partisan.
And Sasaki finds the dishar
mony strange. "(Senators! said,
'Stanford comes first,' but I think
the points of cooperation were too
far and few between. People need
to realize that when they fail to
coordinate or refuse to cooperate,
it's ultimately the students who
suffer," he said.
In lieu of disharmony and dis
sension, Sasaki believes the senate

and senators "should be in a rush
to discuss, analyze and re-analyze
bills until they come to an agree
ment," instead of being "in a rush
to pass bills."
To more efficiently help the sen
ate effect changes it needs, Sasaki
said he has tried to reduce harm
ful, uncooperative debate and
replace it by selectively targeted,
beneficial discussion.
"Senators have a lot of ideas
about what they want to do, but
they don't realize how difficult it
is (to bring about change). I think
it's the job of the senate chair to
focus the senators (on a select few
issues)," he said.
Sasaki thinks the goal of the
senate should be to content itself
with making small changes over
a long period. As an example, he
cited four ASSU Constitutional

amendments reforming special fee
refunds which were placed on this
spring's ballot. While two of the
amendments passed, the other
two — which he wrote — may
require years of revision to gain
a majority vote.
But Sasaki said the slow pro
cesses frustrates some new
senators. "[Theyl come into the
senate and think they can wave
their hands and make a lot of
change." Instead, senators should
realize "that incremental change
is all they can make."
"I've made changes that I'm
very proud of, but nobody will
notice them — they're just a grain
of sand," he said.
However, Sasaki said, on a per
sonal level his term in the senate
has helped him change his views
about himself and his interests.
"I found ... I really enjoyed
working with people; I eiyoyed
running the senate office; I en
joyed being an administrator. I
always thought of it as being a
boring position, but I really en
joyed it,"he said.
Sasaki said his function as an
administrator forced him to work
with people of different view
points, but he welcomed the op
portunity because it allowed him
to develop skills he could not learn
in a classroom. In addition, he
thought his administrative work
helped him in the Law School by
giving him the chance to experi
ence situations which otherwise
would have been theory in a
casebook.
As an administrator, Sasaki
said his role was to stay out of
as many senate controversies as
possible and concentrate on being
a spokesperson for the senate.
"It's the student body, the
[Council of Presidents], and the
senators who set the agenda. In
some sense you play a passive role

'A lot of the time, especially when things get
heated among senators — you don't poke fun
at a senator — but when you make a mistake
or misspeak, you acknowledge it... you're
not like a president, you're not commanding
people, you're not a dictator, you have to
persuade.'

because you have to pursue the
course a majority of senators have
issued. ... (For example) you
pursue the discussion on alcohol
policy until the senate has spoken,
and then you present the opinion
of the senate to the administra
tion or The Daily."
Even though Sasaki has found
his job as an administrator enjoy
able overall, some of it has been
tedious and difficult. "It' 3 also
very frustrating because you're
dealing with a bureaucracy, you're
dealing with high turnover (and)
you're dealing with a lack of con
tinuity in terms of documenta
tion," he said.
In addition to frustrating bu
reaucracy, Sasaki said running
senate meetings can be a difficult
experience, especially when they

become hectic.
To handle challenging meetings,
Sasaki said he found it was im
portant to balance a sense of
humor with personal persuasive
ness.
"I think a lot of the time, es
pecially when things get heated
among senators — you don't poke
fun at a senator — but when you
make a mistake or misspeak, you
acknowledge it . . . you're not like
a president, you're not command
ing people, you're not a dictator,
you have to persuade," he said.
"You have to be sensitive to the
million different things at once
.. . . Whenever you make a deci
sion there is always a person who
will be unhappy with that,"
Sasaki added. "You have to get
used to people misunderstanding
your motives."

"I've made changes that I'm
very proud of, but nobody will
notice them — they're just a grain
of sand," he said.
However, Sasaki said, on a per
sonal level his term in the senate
has helped him change his views
about himself and his interests.
"I found ... I really enjoyed
working with people; I eiyoyed
running the senate office; I en
joyed being an administrator. I
always thought of it as being a
boring position, but I really en
joyed it,"he said.
Sasaki said his function as an
administrator forced him to work
with people of different view
points, but he welcomed the op
portunity because it allowed him
to develop skills he could not learn
in a classroom. In addition, he
thought his administrative work
helped him in the Law School by
giving him the chance to experi
ence situations which otherwise
would have been theory in a
casebook.
As an administrator, Sasaki
said his role was to stay out of
as many senate controversies as
possible and concentrate on being
a spokesperson for the senate.
"It's the student body, the
[Council of Presidents], and the
senators who set the agenda. In
some sense you play a passive role

'A lot of the time, especially when things get
heated among senators — you don't poke fun
at a senator — but when you make a mistake
or misspeak, you acknowledge it... you're
not like a president, you're not commanding
people, you're not a dictator, you have to
persuade.'

because you have to pursue the
course a majority of senators have
issued. ... (For example) you
pursue the discussion on alcohol
policy until the senate has spoken,
and then you present the opinion
of the senate to the administra
tion or The Daily."
Even though Sasaki has found
his job as an administrator enjoy
able overall, some of it has been
tedious and difficult. "It' 3 also
very frustrating because you're
dealing with a bureaucracy, you're
dealing with high turnover (and)
you're dealing with a lack of con
tinuity in terms of documenta
tion," he said.
In addition to frustrating bu
reaucracy, Sasaki said running
senate meetings can be a difficult
experience, especially when they

become hectic.
To handle challenging meetings,
Sasaki said he found it was im
portant to balance a sense of
humor with personal persuasive
ness.
"I think a lot of the time, es
pecially when things get heated
among senators — you don't poke
fun at a senator — but when you
make a mistake or misspeak, you
acknowledge it . . . you're not like
a president, you're not command
ing people, you're not a dictator,
you have to persuade," he said.
"You have to be sensitive to the
million different things at once
.. . . Whenever you make a deci
sion there is always a person who
will be unhappy with that,"
Sasaki added. "You have to get
used to people misunderstanding
your motives."
