# Sasaki unhappy with split Senate
## Says senators should concentrate on small changes over long periods 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
When ASSU Senate Chair Ed
Sasaki took his position last
spring, he expected to see a lot
of cooperation among senators
this year. Instead, he has wit
nessed the senate grow more
splintered and divided as the
ASSU has become increasingly
partisan.
And Sasaki finds the dishar
mony strange. "(Senators! said,
'Stanford comes first,' but I think
the points of cooperation were too
far and few between. People need
to realize that when they fail to
coordinate or refuse to cooperate,
it's ultimately the students who
suffer," he said.
In lieu of disharmony and dis
sension, Sasaki believes the senate

and senators "should be in a rush
to discuss, analyze and re-analyze
bills until they come to an agree
ment," instead of being "in a rush
to pass bills."
To more efficiently help the sen
ate effect changes it needs, Sasaki
said he has tried to reduce harm
ful, uncooperative debate and
replace it by selectively targeted,
beneficial discussion.
"Senators have a lot of ideas
about what they want to do, but
they don't realize how difficult it
is (to bring about change). I think
it's the job of the senate chair to
focus the senators (on a select few
issues)," he said.
Sasaki thinks the goal of the
senate should be to content itself
with making small changes over
a long period. As an example, he
cited four ASSU Constitutional

amendments reforming special fee
refunds which were placed on this
spring's ballot. While two of the
amendments passed, the other
two — which he wrote — may
require years of revision to gain
a majority vote.
But Sasaki said the slow pro
cesses frustrates some new
senators. "[Theyl come into the
senate and think they can wave
their hands and make a lot of
change." Instead, senators should
realize "that incremental change
is all they can make."
"I've made changes that I'm
very proud of, but nobody will
notice them — they're just a grain
of sand," he said.
However, Sasaki said, on a per
sonal level his term in the senate
