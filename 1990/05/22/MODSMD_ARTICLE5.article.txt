# Kimball Hall gets environmental OK
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
The 200-bed Kimball Hall,
which will help give undergradu
ates four years of guaranteed
housing, has been given an envi
ronmental OK by the county, and
the dormitory will be built this
summer if the ruling is uncon
tested.
No major environmental im
pacts were found that could not
be mitigated in ways acceptable
to the Santa Clara County Plan
ning Office.
The public is asked to comment
regarding the correctness, com
pleteness and adequacy of this
ruling by June 14, when a public
hearing regarding the county's de
cision will be held. Significant ob
jections, which University offi
cials say are highly unlikely, could
be very costly to the University
and could delay the construction
project for many months.
Kimball will be located on the

north side of Escondido Road be
tween Campus Drive and Serra
Street, the present location of
Manzanita Park.
The $10-million project is ex
pected to be completed before fall
1991.
The University has already
taken a brief look at possible en
vironmental impacts of the dorm,
and Stanford's consultant pre
sented a report to the county. The
consultant recommended:
• Planting designs should use,
where possible, drought-tolerant,
low-maintenance species,
• Construction work should be
scheduled to avoid disruption of
academic research or other activ
ities,
• All construction equipment
and operations with a high noise
potential should be muffled or
controlled, as feasible, and
• If paleontological or ar
cheological specimens are found,
work should stop immediately
within a 35-foot radius.
