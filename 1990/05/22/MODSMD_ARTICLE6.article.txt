# Weekend hot water shutdown planned
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
A hot shower may not be on
tap for some students this holiday
weekend when the University
shuts off the steam.
A planned steam shutdown,
slated to begin Sunday at 8 a.m.
and end Monday at noon, will tem
porarily cut off warm water to
four residence halls and over a
half-dozen Row houses that rely
on energy from steam to heat
water.
Large computer networks and
laser facilities throughout the
University that use steam to
power cooling systems will also
be affected and should not be
used, according to shutdown co
ordinator Terry Adams of Oper
ations and Maintenance.
The shutdown is part of Stan
ford's periodic check on the Car
dinal Cogeneration Plant, the pri-

Mary steam generator for the
campus.
The effect of the shutdown on
students will depend on student
use of hot water. If enough stu
dents flock to the beaches over
the weekend, the impact of the
shutdown may be hardly notice
able.
Depending on how long the
already-existing warm water
supply lasts in each dorm, stu
dents might not have to contend
with the prospect of cold showers,
Adams said.
But while the shutdown may
not affect students in the shower,
it could make for a palate problem
in the dining hall.
All University Food Service
dining rooms, with the exception
of the gas-powered Ricker Dining
Center, will be forced to resort to
alternative menus. Preliminary
plans include pastry and cold
cereal breakfasts in the morning
and barbecue-grilled dinners.
University Food Services man
ager Jim Keeton says his entire
staff is trying to draft menus that
use the fewest number of dishes
and serving pans since most of
the kitchens will not have steam
available to clean kitchen wares
and dishes.
"We will be open at all locations
that are scheduled to be open for
the holiday weekend," Keeton
said. "But we won't have hot
entrees at every meal and will use
plastic utensils."
The precautionary inspection
comes at a time when the Uni
versity's demand for steam has
grown faster than the capacity to
generate steam, according to
Adams.
"We need to make sure that the
generator's facilities are operating
up to par and take steps to insure
the prevention of a breakdown in
the future," Adams said.
However, one University ad
ministrator, who wished to
remain anonymous, said the shut-

down "could not have come at a
possibly worse time," adding that
the procedure could have waited
until the end of the year.
Adams, however, said that the
primary reason for initiating the
shutdown at this time is due to
less energy demands at Stanford
Hospital, a msyor user of steam.
"We needed to find a time when
the hospital would not be too
busy," Adams said. "The
Memorial Day weekend was the
best time for the hospital since
there would be the least expected
demand for the hospital and to a
lesser extent, the research facili
ties that depend on the steam en
ergy considerably," he added.
Adams warned students to be
aware of the inconveniences that
could stem from the shutdown
and plan accordingly, "especially
if they are planning on having
the grandparents over for a nice
hot meal over the weekend,"
