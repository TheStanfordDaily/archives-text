# Weekend hot water shutdown planned
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
A hot shower may not be on
tap for some students this holiday
weekend when the University
shuts off the steam.
A planned steam shutdown,
slated to begin Sunday at 8 a.m.
and end Monday at noon, will tem
porarily cut off warm water to
four residence halls and over a
half-dozen Row houses that rely
on energy from steam to heat
water.
Large computer networks and
laser facilities throughout the
University that use steam to
power cooling systems will also
be affected and should not be
used, according to shutdown co
ordinator Terry Adams of Oper
ations and Maintenance.
The shutdown is part of Stan
ford's periodic check on the Car
dinal Cogeneration Plant, the pri-

Mary steam generator for the
campus.
The effect of the shutdown on
students will depend on student
use of hot water. If enough stu
dents flock to the beaches over
the weekend, the impact of the
shutdown may be hardly notice
able.
Depending on how long the
already-existing warm water
supply lasts in each dorm, stu
dents might not have to contend
with the prospect of cold showers,
Adams said.
But while the shutdown may
not affect students in the shower,
it could make for a palate problem
in the dining hall.
All University Food Service
dining rooms, with the exception
of the gas-powered Ricker Dining
Center, will be forced to resort to
alternative menus. Preliminary
