# COP recall petition close to verification
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
After verification of petition
signatures last night, ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Krauss
has tentatively planned an elec
tion to determine whether to
recall the Council of Presidents
slate "Four Our Future."
The election is the result of a
petition circulated by the group
Stanford United for Fair Elec
tions, which garnered 2,030 signa
tures by Friday afternoon. This
number of signatures is well
above the 1,998 signatures needed
to mandate the election.
"It's pretty much there,"
Krauss said last night at 10:30
p.m. as he was finishing the
verification process by checking
50 signatures at random to make
sure they were registered stu
dents. The ASSU Bylaws state
that the election must be held at
least 10 days after verification and
no more than 21 days.
At tonight's ASSU Senate meet
ing, however, senators have the
authority to move up the recall
election to fewer than 10 days
after the petition was received in
order to hold the vote before Dead
Week. Because the petition was
submitted at the end of the quar
ter. the senate may also vote to
hold the election next year.
One problem posed by such a
late election date is that the Law
School is already out of session.
Krauss was considering mailing
absentee ballots to all law students
in order to circumvent this prob

lem.
In the meantime, graduate stu
dent Perry Friedman is continu
ing to collect signatures, which
could be submitted and accepted
at a later date. "SUFE is working
on getting about 70 more signa
tures as a bigger buffer," Fried
man said. "That would allow for
a greater rate of failure, just in
case."
