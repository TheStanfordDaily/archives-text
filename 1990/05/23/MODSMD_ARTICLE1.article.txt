# Three-peat: Tennis tops Tennessee to take title
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - The
magic of formerly undefeated Ten
nessee vanished in the red-hot
desert heat yesterday as the
Stanford men's tennis team cap
tured its third straight NCAA
title, pounding the Volunteers 5-2
in just under four hours.
The victory gave Stanford its
fourth NCAA title in the past five
years and its 11th title overall.
Stanford ends the 1990 season
with a record of 25-3. The Vol
unteers finished their season at
34-1.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould was
quick to give credit for the cham
pionship to the unselfishness of
this year's team. "Every guy on
this team is a great player, a great
athlete and a great person," he
said. "And they all melded to
gether for a common goal this
year."
"I never had any ego problems,
and these guys went out of their
way to put themselves in situa
tions for the good of the team. I
can't say enough about how these
guys stuck together," he added.
Stanford led the entire match
and had a chance to win the title
at the No. 2 singles spot. But
freshman Jared Palmer lost his
first match of the tournament in
a dramatic third-set tiebreaker,
sending the duel into doubles play
with the Cardinal leading 4-2.
Unlike Monday night, however,

Stanford wins NCAA title

when Tennessee came back from
being down 4-2 to beat UCLA in
all three doubles matches and
reach the NCAA finals, this time
the Volunteers couldn't find any
hats or any rabbits, for that mat
ter.
Sophomore Jason Yee made
sure of that, smashing an over
head over the fence to give the
Cardinal a 6-2, 6-4 victory at No.
3 doubles and the dual-match vic
tory.
"It came down to that one shot,
and I took it. I wasn't going to
let it get away," Yee said. "I knew
about what happened against
UCLA, and I wanted to make sure
that I put that one away."
Jeff Cathrall and Alexis
Hombrecher were up one set and
tied 6-6 in a second-set tiebreaker
at No. 2 doubles when the match
was called.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien, who
has never lost a match in doubles
or singles at the NCAAs, started
the Cardinal off on a positive note
yesterday, whipping Tennessee's
Brice Karsh 6-1, 6-1.
O'Brien kept Karsh hitting off
his back foot all day, mixing up
the pace with looping topspin lobs

and penetrating groundstrokes.
"I was pretty pumped up
today," O'Brien said. "There was
an aura playing Tennessee be
cause they hadn't lost and espe
cially after what they did last
night against UCLA. I wanted to
dispel it. So, I went out there and
tried to stay on top the whole
way."
Hombrecher, who had given the
Cardinal three previous wins at
the No. 6 spot, was next off the
court. This time, however, he re
turned poorly and ended up losing
to Tennessee's John Gibson 6-4,
6-4.
"I wasn't as mentally tough
today as I was the past three
days," Hombrecher said. "I didn't
give up or anything, but I
shouldn't have lost."
Glenn Solomon, who was last
off the court the past two duals,
gave Stanford an early 2-1 lead
as he clobbered Coenie de Villiers
6-4, 6-1 at No. 5 singles.
"I was tired [before the match 1.
I had played a couple of long
matches before and didn't feel like
I was as quick as usual," Solomon
said. "Fortunately, I sized him up
and made him hit a lot of balls.
He was missing some easy shots."
Solomon did not lose at this
year's NCAAs, winning four
straight singles matches at No. 5.
Cathrall saved his best play for
last. The senior was slumping

lost in the past two matches at No. 4.
But yesterday Cathrall was as mentally
tough as he has been all season.
Cathrall overpowered Fabio Silber
berg, one of the most talented No. 4
players in the country, 6-2, 7-6.
Cathrall actually was serving for the
•match at 5-4 in the second set, but he
put Silberberg away. "It says
•a lot for Cathrall to come back after
rbeing broken at the end of the second,"
lAsst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
; In the second-set tiebreaker, Cathrall
•rebounded from a 4-1 deficit to win it
•7 -5.
I"I wasn't going to lose it today," Cath-
Irall said. "It was my last match, and I
just never thought I was going to lose."
• Moments after Cathrall's match,
-Stanford's No. 1 player, Jonathan Stark,
moved the Cardinal's lead to 4-1. Stark
won the last four games of the third
set for a 6-1, 2-6, 7-5 victory over Doug
-Flach.
Stark captured the first set 6-1 in 24
minutes but, after that, Flach seemed
to pick up his play.
In the third set, Flach was actually
serving for the match at 5-4. But Stark
hit three great returns and volleyed his
way to a 40-love lead. Two points later

ter than the last. You
really can't beat the
feeling of winning one
of these.'

the match was knotted at 5-5.
Stark then held serve and broke Flach
to win the third set at 7-5. "In the
third set, I had nothing to lose. I hadn't
broken him the whole set, but suddenly
things started to go my way. I was lucky
to come away with it," Stark said.
With Stanford up 4-1 in singles, all
eyes turned to the No. 2 singles match
which pitted Palmer against Tennessee's
Tim Jessup.
Szalmer had won the first set 6-4 but
lost the second rather quickly at 6-1.
In the third set, Palmer broke back
from 4-5 down to even the score at 5-5.
Both players held serve and entered
into a possible dual-match-deciding tie
breaker.
Jessup, however, came up with three
big serves and won the tiebreaker at 7-3.

"I just got a little tight in that tie
breaker," Palmer said.
Luckily for the Cardinal, the doubles
turned out to be a horse race to see
who could claim the championship first.
For a moment, it looked as though Cath
rall and Hombrecher would take the
honors. The No. 2 doubles team quickly
dispatched of Coenie de Villiers and
John Gibson 6-1 in the first set.
But the Tennessee team forced Cath
rall and Hombrecher into a tiebreaker
in the second set, which allowed the
No. 3 doubles combination of Yee and
O'Brien to win their match first and
grab the title.
"That's like the third time this season
O'Brien and Yee have done this to us.
I kind of knew they'd beat us to it
again," Hombrecher lamented.
O'Brien and Yee, the Pacific 10 Con
ference doubles champions, led the
whole match against Karsh and Silber
berg, eventually winning it 6-2, 6-4.
As soon as Yee put away the final
point with an overhead winner, the No.
1 and No. 2 doubles matches were called
off.
O'Brien mentioned the large amount
of support, especially from the students,
as being crucial to the win. "It really
helps to have those guys cheering for
you. It makes you want to win more,"
O'Brien said. "It was great that they
came all the way down here to cheer
us on."
Team captain Barry Richards added,
"It may not seem like it, but those guys
can change a few matches around. It's
always great to have someone pumping
you up."
Solomon, who has played on all three
NCAA championship squads, said that
this title was the best of all. "Every
one seems better than the last. You
really can't beat the feeling of winning
one of these," he said.
With the win, Stanford became the
first men's team to win three consecu
tive championships under the present
dual-match format, adopted in 1977.
How good was this team compared
to the others?
USC Coach Dick Leach called this
year's Cardinal squad "one of the two
or three best college teams ever as
sembled."
But Gould prefers to leave those types
of questions unanswered. "Ask them,"
he said, pointing to the players, when
asked how good this team was.
Gould did mention that he was par
ticularly impressed with the way this
team was able to bounce back from
adversity. players, like Stark and
Palmer, were injured for much of the
season. "You can't say enough about
the way these guys fought back," Gould
said.
For several of the Cardinal
performers, however, yesterday was just
the beginning. Stark, Palmer, and
O'Brien all will play in the individual
NCAA singles competition today. Stark
is seeded second in the tournament.
In addition, Stark and Palmer,
Hombrecher and Cathrall, and O'Brien
and Yee will also play in the doubles
tournament, which will begin Thursday.
Stark and Palmer are the second seed
in the doubles draw.

Stanford wins NCAA title

when Tennessee came back from
being down 4-2 to beat UCLA in
all three doubles matches and
reach the NCAA finals, this time
the Volunteers couldn't find any
hats or any rabbits, for that mat
ter.
Sophomore Jason Yee made
sure of that, smashing an over
head over the fence to give the
Cardinal a 6-2, 6-4 victory at No.
3 doubles and the dual-match vic
tory.
"It came down to that one shot,
and I took it. I wasn't going to
let it get away," Yee said. "I knew
about what happened against
UCLA, and I wanted to make sure
that I put that one away."
Jeff Cathrall and Alexis
Hombrecher were up one set and
tied 6-6 in a second-set tiebreaker
at No. 2 doubles when the match
was called.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien, who
has never lost a match in doubles
or singles at the NCAAs, started
the Cardinal off on a positive note
yesterday, whipping Tennessee's
Brice Karsh 6-1, 6-1.
O'Brien kept Karsh hitting off
his back foot all day, mixing up
the pace with looping topspin lobs

and penetrating groundstrokes.
"I was pretty pumped up
today," O'Brien said. "There was
an aura playing Tennessee be
cause they hadn't lost and espe
cially after what they did last
night against UCLA. I wanted to
dispel it. So, I went out there and
tried to stay on top the whole
way."
Hombrecher, who had given the
Cardinal three previous wins at
the No. 6 spot, was next off the
court. This time, however, he re
turned poorly and ended up losing
to Tennessee's John Gibson 6-4,
6-4.
"I wasn't as mentally tough
today as I was the past three
days," Hombrecher said. "I didn't
give up or anything, but I
shouldn't have lost."
Glenn Solomon, who was last
off the court the past two duals,
gave Stanford an early 2-1 lead
as he clobbered Coenie de Villiers
6-4, 6-1 at No. 5 singles.
"I was tired [before the match 1.
I had played a couple of long
matches before and didn't feel like
I was as quick as usual," Solomon
said. "Fortunately, I sized him up
and made him hit a lot of balls.
He was missing some easy shots."
Solomon did not lose at this
year's NCAAs, winning four
straight singles matches at No. 5.
Cathrall saved his best play for
last. The senior was slumping

lost in the past two matches at No. 4.
But yesterday Cathrall was as mentally
tough as he has been all season.
Cathrall overpowered Fabio Silber
berg, one of the most talented No. 4
players in the country, 6-2, 7-6.
Cathrall actually was serving for the
•match at 5-4 in the second set, but he
put Silberberg away. "It says
•a lot for Cathrall to come back after
rbeing broken at the end of the second,"
lAsst. Coach John Whitlinger said.

•rebounded from a 4-1 deficit to win it
•7 -5.
I"I wasn't going to lose it today," Cath-
Irall said. "It was my last match, and I
just never thought I was going to lose."
• Moments after Cathrall's match,
-Stanford's No. 1 player, Jonathan Stark,
moved the Cardinal's lead to 4-1. Stark
won the last four games of the third
set for a 6-1, 2-6, 7-5 victory over Doug
-Flach.
Stark captured the first set 6-1 in 24
minutes but, after that, Flach seemed
to pick up his play.
In the third set, Flach was actually
serving for the match at 5-4. But Stark
hit three great returns and volleyed his
way to a 40-love lead. Two points later

ter than the last. You

the match was knotted at 5-5.
Stark then held serve and broke Flach
to win the third set at 7-5. "In the
third set, I had nothing to lose. I hadn't
broken him the whole set, but suddenly
things started to go my way. I was lucky
to come away with it," Stark said.
With Stanford up 4-1 in singles, all
eyes turned to the No. 2 singles match
which pitted Palmer against Tennessee's
Tim Jessup.
Szalmer had won the first set 6-4 but
lost the second rather quickly at 6-1.
In the third set, Palmer broke back
from 4-5 down to even the score at 5-5.
Both players held serve and entered
into a possible dual-match-deciding tie
breaker.
Jessup, however, came up with three
big serves and won the tiebreaker at 7-3.

"I just got a little tight in that tie
breaker," Palmer said.
Luckily for the Cardinal, the doubles
turned out to be a horse race to see
who could claim the championship first.
For a moment, it looked as though Cath
rall and Hombrecher would take the
honors. The No. 2 doubles team quickly
dispatched of Coenie de Villiers and
John Gibson 6-1 in the first set.
But the Tennessee team forced Cath
rall and Hombrecher into a tiebreaker
in the second set, which allowed the
No. 3 doubles combination of Yee and
O'Brien to win their match first and
grab the title.
"That's like the third time this season
O'Brien and Yee have done this to us.
I kind of knew they'd beat us to it
again," Hombrecher lamented.
O'Brien and Yee, the Pacific 10 Con
ference doubles champions, led the
whole match against Karsh and Silber
berg, eventually winning it 6-2, 6-4.
As soon as Yee put away the final
point with an overhead winner, the No.
1 and No. 2 doubles matches were called
off.
O'Brien mentioned the large amount
of support, especially from the students,
as being crucial to the win. "It really
helps to have those guys cheering for
you. It makes you want to win more,"
O'Brien said. "It was great that they
came all the way down here to cheer
us on."
Team captain Barry Richards added,
"It may not seem like it, but those guys
can change a few matches around. It's
always great to have someone pumping
you up."
Solomon, who has played on all three
NCAA championship squads, said that
this title was the best of all. "Every
one seems better than the last. You
really can't beat the feeling of winning
one of these," he said.
With the win, Stanford became the
first men's team to win three consecu
tive championships under the present
dual-match format, adopted in 1977.
How good was this team compared
to the others?
USC Coach Dick Leach called this
year's Cardinal squad "one of the two
or three best college teams ever as
sembled."
But Gould prefers to leave those types
of questions unanswered. "Ask them,"
he said, pointing to the players, when
asked how good this team was.
Gould did mention that he was par
ticularly impressed with the way this
team was able to bounce back from
adversity. players, like Stark and
Palmer, were injured for much of the
season. "You can't say enough about
the way these guys fought back," Gould
said.
For several of the Cardinal
performers, however, yesterday was just
the beginning. Stark, Palmer, and
O'Brien all will play in the individual
NCAA singles competition today. Stark
is seeded second in the tournament.
In addition, Stark and Palmer,
Hombrecher and Cathrall, and O'Brien
and Yee will also play in the doubles
tournament, which will begin Thursday.
Stark and Palmer are the second seed
in the doubles draw.

O'Brien kept Karsh hitting off
his back foot all day, mixing up
the pace with looping topspin lobs

and penetrating groundstrokes.
"I was pretty pumped up
today," O'Brien said. "There was
an aura playing Tennessee be
cause they hadn't lost and espe
cially after what they did last
night against UCLA. I wanted to
dispel it. So, I went out there and
tried to stay on top the whole
way."
Hombrecher, who had given the
Cardinal three previous wins at
the No. 6 spot, was next off the
court. This time, however, he re
turned poorly and ended up losing
to Tennessee's John Gibson 6-4,
6-4.
"I wasn't as mentally tough
today as I was the past three
days," Hombrecher said. "I didn't
give up or anything, but I
shouldn't have lost."
Glenn Solomon, who was last
off the court the past two duals,
gave Stanford an early 2-1 lead
as he clobbered Coenie de Villiers
6-4, 6-1 at No. 5 singles.
"I was tired [before the match 1.
I had played a couple of long
matches before and didn't feel like
I was as quick as usual," Solomon
said. "Fortunately, I sized him up
and made him hit a lot of balls.
He was missing some easy shots."
Solomon did not lose at this
year's NCAAs, winning four
straight singles matches at No. 5.
Cathrall saved his best play for
last. The senior was slumping

lost in the past two matches at No. 4.
But yesterday Cathrall was as mentally
tough as he has been all season.
Cathrall overpowered Fabio Silber
berg, one of the most talented No. 4
players in the country, 6-2, 7-6.
Cathrall actually was serving for the
•match at 5-4 in the second set, but he
put Silberberg away. "It says
•a lot for Cathrall to come back after
rbeing broken at the end of the second,"
lAsst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
; In the second-set tiebreaker, Cathrall

•7 -5.
I"I wasn't going to lose it today," Cath-
Irall said. "It was my last match, and I
just never thought I was going to lose."
• Moments after Cathrall's match,
-Stanford's No. 1 player, Jonathan Stark,
moved the Cardinal's lead to 4-1. Stark
won the last four games of the third
set for a 6-1, 2-6, 7-5 victory over Doug
-Flach.
Stark captured the first set 6-1 in 24
minutes but, after that, Flach seemed
to pick up his play.
In the third set, Flach was actually
serving for the match at 5-4. But Stark
hit three great returns and volleyed his
way to a 40-love lead. Two points later

ter than the last. You

the match was knotted at 5-5.
Stark then held serve and broke Flach
to win the third set at 7-5. "In the
third set, I had nothing to lose. I hadn't
broken him the whole set, but suddenly
things started to go my way. I was lucky
to come away with it," Stark said.
With Stanford up 4-1 in singles, all
eyes turned to the No. 2 singles match
which pitted Palmer against Tennessee's
Tim Jessup.
Szalmer had won the first set 6-4 but
lost the second rather quickly at 6-1.
In the third set, Palmer broke back
from 4-5 down to even the score at 5-5.
Both players held serve and entered
into a possible dual-match-deciding tie
breaker.
Jessup, however, came up with three
big serves and won the tiebreaker at 7-3.

"I just got a little tight in that tie
breaker," Palmer said.
Luckily for the Cardinal, the doubles
turned out to be a horse race to see
who could claim the championship first.
For a moment, it looked as though Cath
rall and Hombrecher would take the
honors. The No. 2 doubles team quickly
dispatched of Coenie de Villiers and
John Gibson 6-1 in the first set.
But the Tennessee team forced Cath
rall and Hombrecher into a tiebreaker
in the second set, which allowed the
No. 3 doubles combination of Yee and
O'Brien to win their match first and
grab the title.
"That's like the third time this season
O'Brien and Yee have done this to us.
I kind of knew they'd beat us to it
again," Hombrecher lamented.
O'Brien and Yee, the Pacific 10 Con
ference doubles champions, led the
whole match against Karsh and Silber
berg, eventually winning it 6-2, 6-4.
As soon as Yee put away the final
point with an overhead winner, the No.
1 and No. 2 doubles matches were called
off.
O'Brien mentioned the large amount
of support, especially from the students,
as being crucial to the win. "It really
helps to have those guys cheering for
you. It makes you want to win more,"
O'Brien said. "It was great that they
came all the way down here to cheer
us on."
Team captain Barry Richards added,
"It may not seem like it, but those guys
can change a few matches around. It's
always great to have someone pumping
you up."
Solomon, who has played on all three
NCAA championship squads, said that
this title was the best of all. "Every
one seems better than the last. You
really can't beat the feeling of winning
one of these," he said.
With the win, Stanford became the
first men's team to win three consecu
tive championships under the present
dual-match format, adopted in 1977.
How good was this team compared
to the others?
USC Coach Dick Leach called this
year's Cardinal squad "one of the two
or three best college teams ever as
sembled."
But Gould prefers to leave those types
of questions unanswered. "Ask them,"
he said, pointing to the players, when
asked how good this team was.
Gould did mention that he was par
ticularly impressed with the way this
team was able to bounce back from
adversity. players, like Stark and
Palmer, were injured for much of the
season. "You can't say enough about
the way these guys fought back," Gould
said.
For several of the Cardinal
performers, however, yesterday was just
the beginning. Stark, Palmer, and
O'Brien all will play in the individual
NCAA singles competition today. Stark
is seeded second in the tournament.
In addition, Stark and Palmer,
Hombrecher and Cathrall, and O'Brien
and Yee will also play in the doubles
tournament, which will begin Thursday.
Stark and Palmer are the second seed
in the doubles draw.
