# Three-peat: Tennis tops Tennessee to take title
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - The
magic of formerly undefeated Ten
nessee vanished in the red-hot
desert heat yesterday as the
Stanford men's tennis team cap
tured its third straight NCAA
title, pounding the Volunteers 5-2
in just under four hours.
The victory gave Stanford its
fourth NCAA title in the past five
years and its 11th title overall.
Stanford ends the 1990 season
with a record of 25-3. The Vol
unteers finished their season at
34-1.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould was
quick to give credit for the cham
pionship to the unselfishness of
this year's team. "Every guy on
this team is a great player, a great
athlete and a great person," he
said. "And they all melded to
gether for a common goal this
year."
"I never had any ego problems,
and these guys went out of their
way to put themselves in situa
tions for the good of the team. I
can't say enough about how these
guys stuck together," he added.
Stanford led the entire match
and had a chance to win the title
at the No. 2 singles spot. But
freshman Jared Palmer lost his
first match of the tournament in
a dramatic third-set tiebreaker,
sending the duel into doubles play
with the Cardinal leading 4-2.
Unlike Monday night, however,

when Tennessee came back from
being down 4-2 to beat UCLA in
all three doubles matches and
reach the NCAA finals, this time
the Volunteers couldn't find any
hats or any rabbits, for that mat
ter.
Sophomore Jason Yee made
sure of that, smashing an over
head over the fence to give the
Cardinal a 6-2, 6-4 victory at No.
3 doubles and the dual-match vic
tory.
"It came down to that one shot,
and I took it. I wasn't going to
let it get away," Yee said. "I knew
about what happened against
UCLA, and I wanted to make sure
that I put that one away."
Jeff Cathrall and Alexis
Hombrecher were up one set and
tied 6-6 in a second-set tiebreaker
at No. 2 doubles when the match
was called.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien, who
has never lost a match in doubles
or singles at the NCAAs, started
the Cardinal off on a positive note
yesterday, whipping Tennessee's
Brice Karsh 6-1, 6-1.
O'Brien kept Karsh hitting off
his back foot all day, mixing up
the pace with looping topspin lobs

and penetrating groundstrokes.
"I was pretty pumped up
today," O'Brien said. "There was
an aura playing Tennessee be
cause they hadn't lost and espe
cially after what they did last
night against UCLA. I wanted to
dispel it. So, I went out there and
tried to stay on top the whole
way."
Hombrecher, who had given the
Cardinal three previous wins at
the No. 6 spot, was next off the
court. This time, however, he re
turned poorly and ended up losing
to Tennessee's John Gibson 6-4,
6-4.
"I wasn't as mentally tough
today as I was the past three
days," Hombrecher said. "I didn't
give up or anything, but I
shouldn't have lost."
Glenn Solomon, who was last
off the court the past two duals,
gave Stanford an early 2-1 lead
as he clobbered Coenie de Villiers
6-4, 6-1 at No. 5 singles.
"I was tired [before the match 1.
I had played a couple of long
matches before and didn't feel like
I was as quick as usual," Solomon
said. "Fortunately, I sized him up
and made him hit a lot of balls.
He was missing some easy shots."
Solomon did not lose at this
year's NCAAs, winning four
straight singles matches at No. 5.
Cathrall saved his best play for
last. The senior was slumping
coming into the match, having
