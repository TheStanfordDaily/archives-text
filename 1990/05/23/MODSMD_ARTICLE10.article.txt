# Brothers looks at love in the '90s
## Psychologist: Days could be numbered for one-night stands 
### Denise M. Morris 
Dr. Joyce Brothers, renowned
psychologist, author and colum
nist, revealed secrets about love
in the '90s at a speech in Kresge
Auditorium last night. An
nouncing "the end of the one
night stand," Brothers predicted
the return of old-fashioned
courting.
Voted one of the 10 most in
fluential women in the country
by United Press International,
Brothers captivated her audi
ence with facts as well as with
her clinical but sarcastic tone.
She stood in front of the
podium, holding the micro
phone, in an effort to establish
personal rapport with her audi
ence.
Citing statistics, Brothers
declared that there are, and will
be throughout the decade, more
marriageable women than men.
But, because men tend to marry
younger mates while women
marry older ones, there will be
more than one man for every
woman. Therefore women will
be in a position to be choosy.
This competition among the

sexes will lead to the rebirth of
romance and courting, she said.
Temporary relationships will be
replaced by "pair bonding that
lasts."
Brothers called body language
an almost infallible sign of one's
vulnerability to love. In looking
for a "conquerable" mate, "a
touch that lingers a bit too long"
or slight trembling in the hand
can be telltale signs of attrac
tion, she said. But Brothers
warned, "Gentlemen, please use
this with discretion."
The most important issue in
the '90s will be how to attract
the opposite sex, Brothers said.
Now more than ever, it will be
useful not to fit in with accepted
beauty standards. Prospective
mates will prefer "rare rather
than the common variety, un
usual human beings other than
carbon copies," she said.
However, there is a way to
get an edge. There are mainly
two types of people who are at
tractive to the opposite sex: sexy
people and those with sexual
power. As Brothers pointed out,
there is a difference between the
two.

A sexy person, Brothers said,
can be called handsome or beau
tiful and provide food for fan
tasy. Sexy people include types
like Warren Beatty and Raquel
Welch, those who affect the
body's response.
On the other hand, Brothers
said, people with sexual power,
like Donald Trump and Gloria
Steinem, control the body and
the mind. Although they may
not be embraced as physically
sensual by the general popula
tion, their intrigue will endure.
Luckily, Brothers said, sexual
power can be developed.
Sexual power almost always
arises from strength, whether it
be coping or intellectual or any
other kind of strength, Brothers
explained.
But love will be more desira
ble than sexual power, said
Brothers, declaring that college
students believe in love. More
students are living together,
postponing marriage to make
sure it will last. This caution is
a reaction to the high divorce
rate and unhappy marriages,
she said.
