Mandela lashes out
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) —
African National Congress leader Nelson Man
dela accused the South African government
yesterday of massacring demonstrators and
causing black-on-black violence.
Mandela also charged the government with
defaming his wife, Winnie, in a murder and
assault trial involving one of her former
bodyguards and said the ANC is not satisfied
with reforms introduced by President F.W. de
Klerk.
Mandela, speaking to reporters after return
ing from an eight-nation African tour, said de
Klerk has no control over the police force. He
accused police of "slaughtering" black people
involved in political demonstrations.
Canada abortion law debated
TORONTO (AP) — Canada's Parliament
opened debate yesterday on an abortion bill
that has split Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
governing party and is opposed by both pro
and anti-abortion lobbies.
The proposed law would allow abortion if a
doctor believes the physical, mental or psycho
logical health of a pregnant woman is threat
ened.
The bill is aimed at filling the void left when
the Supreme Court struck down the previous
law in January 1988. The court said the old
measure was arbitrary and violated women's
rights.
Anti-abortion forces say the bill would au
thorize abortion on demand. The pro-choice
lobby says there have been no restrictions for
the past two years that and none are needed
now. About 60,000 abortions were performed
in Canada last year.
Motorcycle killing targeted
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Riding double
on motorcycles was declared illegal yesterday
in the city of Medellin in an effort to stop
drive-by killings that have become common in
the drug-infested city.
President Virgilio Barco, worried about a
wave of violence prior to Sunday's presidential
election, canceled a trip to Peru where he was
to have attended a regional presidential sum
mit yesterday.
The new law regarding motorcycle riders
was imposed a day after the slaying of Sen.
Federico Estrada Velez of the governing
Liberal Party. Police in Medellin said two men
on a motorcycle were responsible for the mur
der.
Korean students condemn U.S.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Radicals
armed with firebombs and rocks fought police
and burned a U.S. flag in Kwangju yesterday,
and students in the capital declared a week
of protests against the U.S. presence in South
Korea.
Police tightened security at U.S. facilities
and arrested eight radical students who tried
to deliver a letter to the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.
Shouting "Drive out the Yankees!" the pro
testers unfurled an anti-American banner that
demanded the U.S. apologize for South Korea's
bloody suppression of a 1980 civil uprising in
Kwangju.
Also in Seoul, police fired 23 blanks from
an M-16 rifle at about 100 students who threw
firebombs at a police station.
Student leaders said they would stage anti-
U.S. protests through Sunday.
Thatcher praises de Klerk
LONDON (AP) — Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said yesterday that economic sanc
tions against South Africa should be lifted
because President F. W. de Klerk's reforms
have made them "almost irrelevant."
Answering a question in Parliament from a
pro-South African lawmaker, Mrs. Thatcher
issued her most forthright call so far for
waiving sanctions.
It came four days after de Klerk met Mrs.
Thatcher in England during the South African
president's nine-nation tour of Europe.
Praising de Klerk's "integrity and courage,"
Mrs. Thatcher said he had made reforms
"which are irreversible, which will bring an
end to apartheid" and lead to a democratic
government on a non-racial basis.
East German charged
EAST BERLIN (AP) — East Germany yes
terday accused a former top Communist offi
cial of squandering government money, the
first formal criminal charges to be brought
against a member of the old regime.
Also yesterday, lawmakers from the ruling
coalition called for the resignation of Interior
Minister Peter-Michael Diestel for trying to
use an ex-Communist spymaster as an adviser
and for failing to fully dismantle the former
government's system of police informers.
Peter Przbylski, a spokesman for the federal
prosecutor's office, said Werner Krolikowski,
61, a member of the former Communist Party's
ruling Politburo and a deputy prime minister,
faces trial in an East Berlin city court on
charges of abuse of trust.
The charge carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison.

CULIACAN, Mexico (AP) — A female
human rights activist who successfully
agitated against police torture in northern
Mexico's Sinaloa state has been killed by uni
dentified gunmen, a police official said yester
day.
Adriana Leyva of the state judicial police
said in a telephone interview that Norma
Sapienz, a 37-year-old attorney, was shot Mon
day night near the Sinaloa Autonomous Uni
versity where she used to teach law.
A police report said Corona Sapienz's auto
mobile was intercepted by three gunmen in a
