# Palestinian protest meets with violence
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Police battled
hundreds of protesters outside the
U.S. Consulate yesterday and troops
killed a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip
amid new rioting over the massacre
of seven Arab laborers by an Israeli
gunman.
In Jordan, Palestinian protests
broke out nationwide, and two people
were reported killed and 23 injured.
Demonstrations protesting the Israeli
killing were held in the capital of Am
man, the cities of Irbid and Zarqa and
the Baqaa refugee camp. A Jordanian
government official acknowledged only
one death.
At least 14 Palestinians were
wounded by troops in clashes in the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, including
a woman five months pregnant who
was hit in the stomach with a plastic
bullet, Arab hospital officials said.
Another Palestinian died of wounds
suffered in an earlier clash, bringing
to 12 the number of Arabs killed since
Sunday's massacre. The number of
Palestinians injured by troops since
Sunday reached at least 826.
Throughout the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, Palestinians closed shops
and schools and stayed home from jobs
in Israel for a third day to protest
Sunday's slayings in which an Israeli
gunman lined up 50 Arab laborers and
opened fire, killing seven.
The army extended a curfew on the
Gaza Strip, home of the slain workers,
and most of the West Bank to quell
angry protests. About 1.5 million Pal
estinians were confined to their homes
by the curfews.
In Israeli-annexed Arab east
Jerusalem, police fired tear gas today
to break up a protest by about 200
Palestinians, mostly women, who
carried black flags of mourning and

chanted pro-PLO slogans as they
marched to the U.S. consulate.
The protesters were led by three
Arab members of Parliament, Greek
Catholic Archbishop of Jerusalem
Lufti Laham and Sheik Hamad Jamal,
a Moslem leader.
Arab legislator Abdel Darousha com
plained police acted too quickly in
firing tear gas. "It was a brutal action
by police. There was no need for it,"
he said.
Sheik Jamal defended the violent
protests throughout the occupied
lands. "In the name of the Palestinian
nation, in the name of the stone
throwers ... I say to the occupiers, get
out of our land," the gray-robed
preacher told reporters.
In Jerusalem, Arab youths trapped
a police jeep in a hail of rocks, but no
one was hurt. In the Jewish quarter
of the walled Old City, assailants
hurled a firebomb into an apartment,
gutting one room but causing no in
juries.
In Gaza City, troops firing on Pal
estinian stone throwers fatally shot
18-year-old Ahmed Musabeh in the
chest, said officials at Shifa Hospital
who examined the body.
Musabeh's pregnant 23-year-old
sister, Samira, was in stable condition
after being shot in the stomach, the
Shifa officials said. The fetus was un
harmed, they said.
Earlier today, Naji Sabala, 22, died
at Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital after
being shot twice in the head by troops
in clashes late Monday in Gaza's Rafah
refugee camp, Arab reporters said.
The deaths today brought to 707
the number of Palestinians killed dur
ing the 29-month-old uprising. An ad
ditional 216 Palestinians have been
slain by fellow Arabs.
