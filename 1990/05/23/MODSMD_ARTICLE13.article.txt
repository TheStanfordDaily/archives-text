# Gorbachev chooses radical economic plan

MOSCOW (AP) - Mikhail Gorba
chev's presidential council of advisers
approved a plan yesterday that would
double food prices next year and in
troduce other radical reforms to ease
the Soviet Union into a market econ
omy by 1995.
The council stressed the need to help
the poor survive the high prices by
introducing compensation and index
ing, the official news agency Tass re
ported.
The government plan will be pre
sented to the Supreme Soviet legisla
ture tomorrow by Premier Nikolai

Ryzhkov, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov told reporters.
An accompanying resolution decrees
that prices on bread, so cheap some
of it is used to feed cattle, will be
raised as early as July to offset higher
grain prices. But it also calls for im
mediate compensation to help poor
people buy bread, their main staple.
The resolution also says new laws
are needed on free enterprise, anti
trust, foreign investment, income in
dexing, employment, banking and cus
toms. It requires the laws be ready
for passage in September.

The program is designed to rescue
an economy plagued by huge
shortages, strikes and ethnic conflicts.
While outlining major price in
creases and other reforms, the report
emphasized the need to control infla
tion, unemployment and other social
ills.
The government will continue to reg
ulate the cost of basic foodstuffs, in
cluding meat, bread and cooking oil,
a draft of the planned reforms said.
The reforms would stagger the
cumulative shock over five years in
stead of the two discussed earlier.

Soviet officials are wary lest abrupt
increases in food prices set off riots
and strikes, like those that toppled
Polish Communist governments in the
1970s and 1980s.
The plan is far more radical than
the government program presented in
December to the Soviet Congress, the
Supreme Soviet's parent parliament.
The earlier plan basically called for
three more years of a centrally planned
economy, but sentiment is growing
that faster steps are needed to improve
production and distribution.
