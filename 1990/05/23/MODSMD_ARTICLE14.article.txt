# Iliescu wins election, raises fears
## 
### 
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - In
terim President lon Iliescu defeated
the opposition in Romania's election
by such a large margin that fears were
raised yesterday in his own party
about entrenching democracy in this
former Communist bastion.
Iliescu captured 85.9 percent of the
vote in the three-way presidential race
with nearly all ballots counted. His
National Salvation Front party had
more than two-thirds of the seats in
the two-chamber Parliament.
The 60-year-old former Communist
Politburo member had been expected
to win Romania's first multiparty elec
tion in 53 years last Sunday, but his
overwhelming victory astonished
many Romanians and foreign observ
ers.
Iliescu says he wants to turn
Romania into a Swedish-style social
democracy and that he will seek a
coalition with the opposition.
But his two opponents said they will
seek to nullify the election on grounds
of fraud and indicated it was unlikely
they would join a national unity gov
ernment.
A monthlong protest by anti-
Communist demonstrators in down
town Bucharest's University Square
flared into what almost became a vi
olent confrontation with government

officials who tried to establish a
dialogue. At least 4,000 protesters
filled the square last night, shouting
the election was a fraud.
Silviu Brucan, the Front's power be
hind the scenes and one of its cam
paign organizers, said the turnout of
more than 85 percent meant
Romanians "have passed magna cum
laude the first class in democracy."
But he said the Front's share of the
vote was too high.
"This is no good for democracy be
cause I stick to my statement that a
strong opposition is essential in a de
mocracy, particularly at a time when
that democracy is in the making," he
said.
Iliescu, who announced Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's execution
at the climax of December's revolution,
capitalized on his personality and his
grassroots support from industrial
workers and peasants.
In an editorial, the outspoken inde
pendent daily Romania Libera said:
"The Front has won the elections but
apparently it definitely alienated
several million voters and the country
has lost a chance, the chance to have
a genuine political opposition in Par
liament."
Some foreign diplomats and observ
ers monitoring the election said the

Front's control of Parliament means
it could overwhelm the process of writ
ing a new constitution, which is to
take place within 18 months.
"If the results are confirmed, this
doesn't seem to be the result of a
pluralist system and this worries me,"
said Adelaide Aglietta, a lawmaker
from Italy's Green party, who was an
observer for the European Parliament.
"I think people here were not helped
to understand exactly what democracy
means. They still think that other po
litical parties are the enemies, and they
haven't understood what a political
dialogue in a democracy is," she told
a news conference.
Andreas Khol, leader of the Euro
pean Democratic Union observer
group, drawing together Western Eu
rope's powerful conservative parties,
said in Vienna the election did not
give Iliescu or the Front the legitimacy
of new governments in Hungary or
Poland.
He said it was an important step
toward democracy but did not express
"the free will of the Romanian people."
Khol said Western governments
should refrain from granting
Romanian aid and leave any help to
private firms.
