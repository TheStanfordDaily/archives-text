Boesky takes stand
NEW YORK (AP) — Ivan Boesky
took the witness stand yesterday for
the first time since the convicted ex
speculator struck a plea deal in 1986,
testifying against former friend John
Mulheren Jr. on securities fraud
charges.
Boesky, center of the biggest in
sider trading scandal in Wall Street
history, made his entrance through
a back door of Manhattan federal
court, where he faced Mulheren and
a packed courtroom. It was Boesky's
first public appearance since he was
released early from a three-year
prison term last month.
Bishop angers pro-lifers
MILWAUKEE (AP) - Archbishop
Rembert Weakland has angered some
anti-abortion activists by suggesting
the Roman Catholic church can rec
oncile some reasons why women have
abortions.

"Yes. There are possibilities there.
One could reconcile their stance with
a church position. I think that is a
possibility. That's why you have to
talk with each one," Weakland said
in an interview published Monday by
the Milwaukee Sentinel.
His comments came just seven
months after the National Confer
ence of Catholic Bishops — the
church's main governing body in the
United States — issued a statement
that "no Catholic can responsibly
take a 'pro-choice stand."'
Simpson criticized
NEW YORK (AP) — Bart Simpson,
the goggle-eyed cartoon kid with a
corrugated hairdo, is catching flak
from educators who say his smart
alecky attitude on "The Simpsons"
gives children the wrong message.
Bart's influence has reached Stan
ford and UCLA, where he won votes
in student elections. He was disqual
ified in both races on the technicalitv

that he was not enrolled, prompting
student protests.
Last month, Principal Bill Krum
now of Lutz Elementary School in
Ballville Township, Ohio, banned
Bart's "Underachiever: And Proud of
It, Man," T-shirt.
"To be proud of being an incom
petent is a contradiction of what we
stand for," Krumnow said "We strive
for excellence and to instill good
values in kids." The show, he said,
"teaches the wrong thing to stu
dents."
Guardsmen investigated
WASHINGTON (AP) - The gov
ernment is investigating 10 current
or former Coast Guardsmen as part
of a drug-smuggling probe, including
one serviceman who has been part
of a detail off President Bush's Maine
home, Coast Guard Commandant
Paul Yost said yesterday.
Yost said at a news conference that
those being investigated included

four current and six former
guardsmen. He said one of those
being investigated had been relieved
of his duties.
In a statement released before the
news conference, Yost had said all
four active-duty personnel had been
relieved of their duties. However, res
ponding to a question, Yost said only
one had actually been relieved and
that he would discuss with the U.S.
attorney's office how to handle the
others.
