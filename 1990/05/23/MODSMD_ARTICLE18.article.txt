## Three-peat 
### 
IT WAS REALLY no surprise
â€” except maybe to Tennessee.
Yesterday the Stanford men's
tennis team beat No. 1-ranked Ten
nessee, clinching the NCAA cham
pionships and becoming the first
team ever to win three consecutive
titles under the present dual-match
format of the NCAAs. Three-peat.
The Cardinal went into the
weekend's competition with a 21-3
record in dual matches and ranked
No. 2 behind undefeated Tennes
see. All eyes were fixed upon the
favored Tennessee, but Stanford
debunked the validity of rankings
yesterday, outlasting the no
longer-undefeated Tennessee 5-2.
Exactly what everyone at Stan
ford, and everyone who knows the
men's tennis team, expected.
All year long, the team has lived
up to its billing as "perhaps the
best (men's tennis team) in the
past two decades," in the words of
Coach Dick Gould.
And with three of the top fresh

man recruits in the country, Alexis
Hombrecher, Jared Palmer and
Jonathan Stark, the Cardinal has
the talent and youth to continue
its unprecedented streak for many
more years.
But the team's strength is not
just in its freshmen. Ail-American
sophomore Alex O'Brien, juniors
Glenn Solomon and Jason Yee and
senior Jeff Cathrall consistently
provided the wins and the depth
that makes the team as good as it
is.
For the rest of this week, Stark,
Palmer and O'Brien will compete
in the individual singles event, and
the teams of Stark and Palmer,
Cathrall and Hombrecher, and
O'Brien and Yee will enter the dou
bles competition.
Stark is seeded No. 2 in singles
and Stark and Palmer are seeded
No. 2 in doubles.
But we all know what a No. 2
ranking means. Just ask Tennes
see.
