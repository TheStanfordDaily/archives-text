IT'S POSSIBLE FOR commu
nity concern and expert opinion
to go hand in hand on the Sand
Hill Road extension project.
The extension of Sand Hill Road
to El Camino Real rests on an
environmental impact report the
University has agreed to fund.
Since there has been some discon
tent concerning the environment
expressed by the community, the
report provides an excellent chan
nel to alleviate concerns about the
possible effects of the construction.
If the project is completed, the
convenience of being able to reach
El Camino via Sand Hill will be a.
benefit to all. Drivers will no longer
have to detour through the Shop
ping Center, and traffic in the area

will be less congested.
If the environmental impact of
the project merits true concern,
the experts can validate and pin
point the problems before any con
struction takes place.
The report should have the full
support of local residents, as their
input has been taken into consid
eration.
As a local governing body, Stan
ford is legitimate in making deci
sions such as the execution of
building projects.
The assertion that the commis
sion of the report was a conflict
of interest is not valid, and the
University has taken steps to ac
commodate many of the interests
of the entire community.
