# League has played little-known role in campus politics

A secretive nationwide organization
called the League of Revolutionary
Struggle (Marxist-Leninist) has been a
little-iuiown factor in student politics at
Stanford for several years, a Daily in
vestigation-has -ftrond: — — - -
Through the selective recruitment of
Stanford students into its organization,
the League has been able to influence

aspects of progressive politics on campus
by trying to place its members in lead
ership positions within the ASSU, the
communities of color and in staff posi
tions.
The total number of Stanford stu
dents and staff members who are League
members is apparently fewer than 30,
but these individuals are in positions
that allow them to shape Btudent gov
ernment policies, according to a number
of sources who said they have either

been recruited by the League or have
worked with League members in the
ASSU or student of color organizations.
The presence of the League has been
in part responsible for dramatic effects
at Stanford, ranging from divisions
within the communities of color to the
pressured resignation of an administra
tor to parts of the planning of last
spring's takeover of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office.
However, most students involved in

progressive politics, including many
leaders of the ASSU and student of color
organizations interviewed by The Daily,
are unaware of the League's presence.
The League, based in the Bay Area
but with membership across the coun
try, has been able to recruit Stanford
students into its organization in a man
ner secret enough so that students are
not initially told they are being recruited
by the League, according to several
Stanford students who said they were

recruited but did not join the League.
Recruitment of individuals by the
League is generally conducted over a
long period of time, several years in
some cases, according to students who
were recruited. Students who are suc
cessfully recruited by the League are
then able to further the League's goals
by running for student offices and help
ing to determine policies in the ASSU
