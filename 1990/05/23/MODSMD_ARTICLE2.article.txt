# League has played little-known role in campus politics
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
A secretive nationwide organization
called the League of Revolutionary
Struggle (Marxist-Leninist) has been a
little-iuiown factor in student politics at
Stanford for several years, a Daily in
vestigation-has -ftrond: — — - -
Through the selective recruitment of
Stanford students into its organization,
the League has been able to influence

aspects of progressive politics on campus
by trying to place its members in lead
ership positions within the ASSU, the
communities of color and in staff posi
tions.
The total number of Stanford stu
dents and staff members who are League
members is apparently fewer than 30,
but these individuals are in positions
that allow them to shape Btudent gov
ernment policies, according to a number
of sources who said they have either

been recruited by the League or have
worked with League members in the
ASSU or student of color organizations.
The presence of the League has been
in part responsible for dramatic effects
at Stanford, ranging from divisions
within the communities of color to the
pressured resignation of an administra
tor to parts of the planning of last
spring's takeover of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office.
However, most students involved in

progressive politics, including many
leaders of the ASSU and student of color
organizations interviewed by The Daily,
are unaware of the League's presence.
The League, based in the Bay Area
but with membership across the coun
try, has been able to recruit Stanford
students into its organization in a man
ner secret enough so that students are
not initially told they are being recruited
by the League, according to several
Stanford students who said they were

recruited but did not join the League.
Recruitment of individuals by the
League is generally conducted over a
long period of time, several years in
some cases, according to students who
were recruited. Students who are suc
cessfully recruited by the League are
then able to further the League's goals
by running for student offices and help
ing to determine policies in the ASSU
and other student groups.
Three-month investigation
Over the past three months,
The Daily has interviewed dozens
of students who have some
familiarity with the League.
These interviews were part of an
investigation of the League which
included more than 100 inter
views with students, administra
tion officials and nationwide
experts.
Many students interviewed by
The Daily asked not to be identi
fied because they said they are
afraid of harassment by League
members. Former Asian Ameri
can Student Association chair
Richard Suh said he was heavily
recruited by Elsa Tsutaoka, the
office manager of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center for three
years, but eventually decided
against joining the League.
Suh sat on the committee that
planned the takeover and was
himself arrested in the action. In
addition, Suh was selected for the
search committee that found a
new Asian-American dean last
spring after the resignation of the
outgoing dean.
Suh said he was primarily con
cerned about the secrecy of the
organization. According to Suh,
when Tsutaoka asked him to ap
ply for membership in the League,
Suh asked her which Stanford
students were members of the
League. "You shouldn't ask that
question," was the reply, he said.
Tsutaoka denied having any
knowledge of the League or that
she had ever recruited for the
League.
Because the recruitment proc
ess is secretive and individuals
refuse to acknowledge that they
are members of the League, it is
difficult to prove whether anyone
is a League member.
League theory
According to League theory, the
United States is composed of
various "oppressed nations," such
as the Afro-American nation in
the South, the Chicano nation in
the Southwest and the Asian-
American nation. The overall goal
of the League has been the liber
ation of these nationalities under
a socialist state, according to a
1986 League publication called
"Peace, Justice, Equality and
Socialism" that explains its goals.
Until it can gain enough sup
port to stage a revolution, the
League attempts to "organize,
agitate and educate the masses"
by working with more main
stream groups, according to the
publication. By making mass or
ganizations more radical, the
League can gain enough support
for its "protracted revolution" in
the United States, the publication
states.
Unlike the Communist Party
USA, which is a predominantly
white organization, the League
focuses on mass organizations

dealing with people of color for
its support within student and
labor movements. At Stanford,
the League has tried to work
toward its goals with varying
degrees of success in MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group;
AASA; the Black Student Union
and the ASSU through the
People's Platform.
Although the League has
operated in almost complete
secrecy at Stanford, there has
been a growing awareness of its
presence, in large part because of
The Daily's investigation.
League members at Stanford
"are leading progressive politics
on campus ... because they are
the best and the hardest
workers," Suh said.
Council of Presidents member
David Brown and former COP
member Stacey Leyton are both
believed to be members of the
League, according to a number of
sources. Brown refused to com
ment. Leyton denied that she was
a member or that she had any
knowledge of the League's mem
bership at Stanford.
Although there is no indication
that she joined the League, COP
member Ingrid Nava, who was
recently re-elected to a second
term, was heavily recruited by the
League beginning at the end of
last summer, according to a num
ber of students. Nava refused to
return numerous phone calls.
At the end of last summer, Nava
lived briefly at a house on Bryant
Street in Palo Alto known sar
castically by some progressive stu
dents as the "Revolutionary
Hotel," where recruitment for the
League has occurred, according to
sources who say they have been
recruited.
Tsutaoka and Steven Phillips,
a former BSU chair and current
Daily multicultural editor who
has allegedly recruited for the
League, currently live in the
house. Phillips recruited Nava be
ginning in September, according
to a student who was also
recruited by the League.
Phillips said he had no knowl
edge of the League's involvement
at Stanford and has not recruited
for the organization.
Takeover planning
A steering committee which was
comprised of at least two mem
bers of the League and several
others who were being actively
recruited at the time were behind
much of the planning for the May
15, 1989, takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. The protest was staged to
demand an Asian-American
tenured professor position, a full
time Chicano dean and a director
for the African and Afro-
American Studies Program
among other goals. Although
these goals were widely accepted
in the color communities that
sponsored the action, it was the
tactics of the takeover planned by
the committee that alienated
many students.
"It was the tactics and not the

goals (of the takeover) that were
planned" by members of the
League who sat on the committee,
according to a student arrested
for involvement in the takeover
who knew of the League's influ
ence. "When specific decisions are
made about what tactics to use,
such as whether or not to do a
takeover for example, these people
have a lot of influence, because
they're the ones who are leaders."
Most people involved in the
takeover did not know of the
League's influence in the tactical
planning of the action. Steve
Ostrander, a senior who was ar
rested in the takeover, said he
was "shocked" when he was told
in January that some of the
people he had worked with on the
takeover and other issues were
League members.
Ostrander said he felt "manip
ulated" by the League members
because he was not told "where
the power was really coming
from."
"I had worked feverishly [in
progressive politics] . . . but in the
end these people couldn't tell me
what was really going on," he said.
Committee members were se
lected from the ASSU Committee
on Democracy in Education,
AASA, MEChA, the Stanford
American Indian Organization
and the black community. The
BSU did not officially approve of
the takeover but supported the
participation of individuals within
the BSU.
The steering committee met in
complete secrecy, deciding that a
physical takeover of the building
would be necessary to achieve its
goals. Gina Hernandez from
MEChA and Leyton from CODE,
who sat on the steering commit
tee, are League members, accord
ing to a number of sources who
asked not to be identified. Leyton
denied having any connections
with the League. Hernandez said
she had never heard of the
League.
Although students allegedly as
sociated with the League com
prised much of the leadership of
students in the takeover, most
students involved in the takeover,
and even some of the planners,
were not told of their influence,
according to sources. Most stu
dents involved in the takeover
only became aware of the specific
action the night before it hap
pened.
"Whenever you take over a
building, there has to be a certain
degree of secrecy," Leyton told
The Daily last month.
Students allegedly connected to
the League from other univer
sities, including San Jose State,
UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz and
San Francisco State, were also
present at the takeover to show
their support for the action.
Administration response
Administration officials said
they had some indication that the
League was involved in the
takeover, but did not attempt to
investigate the influences of the

League.
Kennedy said he was aware of
"outside influences" at the
takeover, but said he did not in
vestigate them because that
would be interpreted by the stu
dents involved as an "effort to
disregard the message in favor of
finding a messenger to shoot."
Kennedy also said he had little
evidence to substantiate the claim
of League involvement in the
takeover.
"On the other hand, I really
am concerned when students, and
particularly freshmen, are influ
enced by people who are working
for their own secret agendas. .. .
If there was any of that, then I'm
troubled by it,"he said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said it would be
"counterproductive" to investi
gate outside influences on the
takeover. "All I know is that I
was dealing with 50-plus students
who were occupying the Presi
dent's office, and like they hold
us accountable for the University,
we hold them accountable for
what they're doing (regardless of
outside influences)," he said.
Students associated with the
League are also in part responsi
ble for last year's resignation of
Juan Yniguez, the former director
of El Centro Chicano and dean of
Chicano affairs, who was pres
sured by some MEChA members
to resign from his post. Yniguez
had been critical of the influence
of the League in MEChA before
he was pressured to resign. Pres
sure from within MEChA came
from both League and non-
League people.
Divisive effects
The League has often had
divisive effects on the various
color communities. Deep ideolog
ical divisions within the Stanford
Chicano community have been in
part the result of the League's
influence within MEChA, accord
ing to a number of students and
staff members in the Chicano
community critical of the League.
League members at Stanford
are "good people, political ac
tivists, but their tactics cause the
most problems in minority com
munities," said Rudy Fuentes, a
co-founder of Stanford MEChA in
1985 and a former Council of
Presidents member who currently
attends Boalt Law School at UC-
Berkeley.
The League at Stanford has
found support over the years in
the membership of MEChA,
where recruitment of MEChA
members into the League is con
ducted by former MEChA
members, according to sources.
The League has had more influ
ence in MEChA in past years than
it holds now, but its power
decreased last year with the grad
uation of a number of MEChA
members allegedly associated
with the League. However, the
League still influences many de
cisions of MEChA through its ties
with some MEChA members, ac
cording to a MEChA member who

did not wish to be identified.
More subtle divisions within the
BSU and AASA have also resulted
because of the League, with only
a few members of each group con
nected to the League.
Little influence in BSU
This year the League has little
influence in the BSU because of
the actions by the BSU officer
corps to reduce the power of stu
dents they believe to be League
members within the BSU. Last
spring, outgoing BSU chair Mary
Dillard warned incoming chair
Calvin Joel Martin about the
power of the League.
BSU officers interviewed by
The Daily said there was an in
ternal division in the BSU based
on League membership, with
more progressive members in one
faction and a more moderate fac
tion headed by Martin. But Mar
tin and other BSU officers said
they had no solid evidence that
individuals within the black com
munity were League members.
"Everybody writes [League
members] off as being too radi
cal," according to former BSU
general representative Bacardi
Jackson. "It's not active members
of the BSU that they get their
respect from."
The takeover caused a notice
able schism in the BSU officer
corps last year, alienating League
members from a more moderate
faction led by Martin. The BSU
officer corps did not officially en
dorse the takeover and did not
even know a takeover was sched
uled until the day before it hap
pened, according to Martin.
"The takeover was their mis
take in the black community, be
cause it created this division,"
according to one BSU member
who was recruited by the League.
The student, who participated in
the takeover, asked not to be iden
tified.
'Like a lackey'
Stanford's Asian-American
community has several people
who are League members, accord
ing to Suh, the AASA chair who
resigned in October because of the
League's influence.
Although at the time he said
publicly that he resigned for "per
sonal reasons," Suh recently told
The Daily he resigned because he
was disillusioned with the League.
"I decided at some point that I
felt like a lackey, because on a
theoretical level [League mem
bers] were fighting for ... an
other agenda."
"I felt that the progressive pol
itics at Stanford were so
dominated by this group, that I
didn't feel independent unless I
disconnected myself from progres
sive politics for a while," he said.
In October, Suh submitted a
letter of resignation to AASA
members he believed to be mem
bers of the League in which he
indirectly criticized the presence
of the League in the Asian-
American community.
There is currently a minor split

in the Asian-American communi
ty, which Suh and others in the
community partially attribute to
the League. However, others say
the split is based primarily on the
conflicting personalities of AASA
members.
Julie Su, who resigned in March
as the co-chair of the AASA issues
committee, said she was unaware
of the League presence at Stan
ford, and that "the split is based
on personality more than any
thing else." She cited frustrations
in dealing with more radical offi
cers of AASA as the reason for
her resignation.
The AASA officer corps has
very little League influence at the
top levels, although a few AASA
members are alleged to be league
members by Suh and other
sources.
Tsutaoka is the League leader
in the Stanford Asian-American
community and also has wide in
fluence in the other color commu
nities, according to Suh and a
number of other sources.
Suh said Tsutaoka has an "inor
dinate amount of power and in
fluence in Asian-American
student politics" because she is
consulted on many important de
cisions within AASA, despite no
longer being a student. Tsutaoka
has also written for Unity news
paper, a League publication.
Writers for Unity newspaper do
not necessarily have any connec
tions to the League.
Although Unity newspaper
originally called itself the news
paper of the League, it no longer
admits its ties to the League. It
is published by Getting Together
Publications, which prints the
Forward Journal of Socialist
Thought, the League's journal, as
well as other League publications.
Troubled by secrecy
Kennedy said he was aware of
the existence of the League and
its presence at Stanford, but said
he had no specific knowledge of
its activities or membership. "If
I'm troubled by anything, it's the
secrecy. It's that there is an or
ganization that is active and
plainly has a political agenda, and
that nobody is saying anything
about it," Kennedy said.
"That's a whole lot less open
than the traditions of this com
munity," he added.
Other administrators said they
were also aware of the League
but did not know the extent of
its influence. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said he has
known of the existence of the
League since "the late 1970s or
early 1980s" when he saw Unity
newspapers being distributed on
campus.
Lyons said he was never par
ticularly concerned with the in
fluence of the League at Stanford
because "it smacks to me of the
kind of small-group movement
oriented political activist groups
that have characterized American
higher education throughout its
history."

uled until the day before it hap
pened, according to Martin.
"The takeover was their mis
take in the black community, be
cause it created this division,"
according to one BSU member
who was recruited by the League.
The student, who participated in
the takeover, asked not to be iden
tified.
'Like a lackey'
Stanford's Asian-American
community has several people
who are League members, accord
ing to Suh, the AASA chair who
resigned in October because of the
League's influence.
Although at the time he said
publicly that he resigned for "per
sonal reasons," Suh recently told
The Daily he resigned because he
was disillusioned with the League.
"I decided at some point that I
felt like a lackey, because on a
theoretical level [League mem
bers] were fighting for ... an
other agenda."
"I felt that the progressive pol
itics at Stanford were so
dominated by this group, that I
didn't feel independent unless I
disconnected myself from progres
sive politics for a while," he said.
In October, Suh submitted a
letter of resignation to AASA
members he believed to be mem
bers of the League in which he
indirectly criticized the presence
of the League in the Asian-
American community.
There is currently a minor split

in the Asian-American communi
ty, which Suh and others in the
community partially attribute to
the League. However, others say
the split is based primarily on the
conflicting personalities of AASA
members.
Julie Su, who resigned in March
as the co-chair of the AASA issues
committee, said she was unaware
of the League presence at Stan
ford, and that "the split is based
on personality more than any
thing else." She cited frustrations
in dealing with more radical offi
cers of AASA as the reason for
her resignation.
The AASA officer corps has
very little League influence at the
top levels, although a few AASA
members are alleged to be league
members by Suh and other
sources.
Tsutaoka is the League leader
in the Stanford Asian-American
community and also has wide in
fluence in the other color commu
nities, according to Suh and a
number of other sources.
Suh said Tsutaoka has an "inor
dinate amount of power and in
fluence in Asian-American
student politics" because she is
consulted on many important de
cisions within AASA, despite no
longer being a student. Tsutaoka
has also written for Unity news
paper, a League publication.
Writers for Unity newspaper do
not necessarily have any connec
tions to the League.
Although Unity newspaper
originally called itself the news
paper of the League, it no longer
admits its ties to the League. It
is published by Getting Together
Publications, which prints the
Forward Journal of Socialist
Thought, the League's journal, as
well as other League publications.
Troubled by secrecy
Kennedy said he was aware of
the existence of the League and
its presence at Stanford, but said
he had no specific knowledge of
its activities or membership. "If
I'm troubled by anything, it's the
secrecy. It's that there is an or
ganization that is active and
plainly has a political agenda, and
that nobody is saying anything
about it," Kennedy said.
"That's a whole lot less open
than the traditions of this com
munity," he added.
Other administrators said they
were also aware of the League
but did not know the extent of
its influence. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said he has
known of the existence of the
League since "the late 1970s or
early 1980s" when he saw Unity
newspapers being distributed on
campus.
Lyons said he was never par
ticularly concerned with the in
fluence of the League at Stanford
because "it smacks to me of the
kind of small-group movement
oriented political activist groups
that have characterized American
higher education throughout its
history."
A secretive nationwide organization
called the League of Revolutionary
Struggle (Marxist-Leninist) has been a
little-iuiown factor in student politics at
Stanford for several years, a Daily in
vestigation-has -ftrond: — — - -
Through the selective recruitment of
Stanford students into its organization,
the League has been able to influence

aspects of progressive politics on campus
by trying to place its members in lead
ership positions within the ASSU, the
communities of color and in staff posi
tions.
The total number of Stanford stu
dents and staff members who are League
members is apparently fewer than 30,
but these individuals are in positions
that allow them to shape Btudent gov
ernment policies, according to a number
of sources who said they have either

been recruited by the League or have
worked with League members in the
ASSU or student of color organizations.
The presence of the League has been
in part responsible for dramatic effects
at Stanford, ranging from divisions
within the communities of color to the
pressured resignation of an administra
tor to parts of the planning of last
spring's takeover of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office.
However, most students involved in

progressive politics, including many
leaders of the ASSU and student of color
organizations interviewed by The Daily,
are unaware of the League's presence.
The League, based in the Bay Area
but with membership across the coun
try, has been able to recruit Stanford
students into its organization in a man
ner secret enough so that students are
not initially told they are being recruited
by the League, according to several
Stanford students who said they were

recruited but did not join the League.
Recruitment of individuals by the
League is generally conducted over a
long period of time, several years in
some cases, according to students who
were recruited. Students who are suc
cessfully recruited by the League are
then able to further the League's goals
by running for student offices and help
ing to determine policies in the ASSU
and other student groups.
Three-month investigation
Over the past three months,
The Daily has interviewed dozens
of students who have some
familiarity with the League.
These interviews were part of an
investigation of the League which
included more than 100 inter
views with students, administra
tion officials and nationwide
experts.
Many students interviewed by
The Daily asked not to be identi
fied because they said they are
afraid of harassment by League
members. Former Asian Ameri
can Student Association chair
Richard Suh said he was heavily
recruited by Elsa Tsutaoka, the
office manager of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center for three
years, but eventually decided
against joining the League.
Suh sat on the committee that
planned the takeover and was
himself arrested in the action. In
addition, Suh was selected for the
search committee that found a
new Asian-American dean last
spring after the resignation of the
outgoing dean.
Suh said he was primarily con
cerned about the secrecy of the
organization. According to Suh,
when Tsutaoka asked him to ap
ply for membership in the League,
Suh asked her which Stanford
students were members of the
League. "You shouldn't ask that
question," was the reply, he said.
Tsutaoka denied having any
knowledge of the League or that
she had ever recruited for the
League.
Because the recruitment proc
ess is secretive and individuals
refuse to acknowledge that they
are members of the League, it is
difficult to prove whether anyone
is a League member.
League theory
According to League theory, the
United States is composed of
various "oppressed nations," such
as the Afro-American nation in
the South, the Chicano nation in
the Southwest and the Asian-
American nation. The overall goal
of the League has been the liber
ation of these nationalities under
a socialist state, according to a
1986 League publication called
"Peace, Justice, Equality and
Socialism" that explains its goals.
Until it can gain enough sup
port to stage a revolution, the
League attempts to "organize,
agitate and educate the masses"
by working with more main
stream groups, according to the
publication. By making mass or
ganizations more radical, the
League can gain enough support
for its "protracted revolution" in
the United States, the publication
states.
Unlike the Communist Party
USA, which is a predominantly
white organization, the League
focuses on mass organizations

dealing with people of color for
its support within student and
labor movements. At Stanford,
the League has tried to work
toward its goals with varying
degrees of success in MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group;
AASA; the Black Student Union
and the ASSU through the
People's Platform.
Although the League has
operated in almost complete
secrecy at Stanford, there has
been a growing awareness of its
presence, in large part because of
The Daily's investigation.
League members at Stanford
"are leading progressive politics
on campus ... because they are
the best and the hardest
workers," Suh said.
Council of Presidents member
David Brown and former COP
member Stacey Leyton are both
believed to be members of the
League, according to a number of
sources. Brown refused to com
ment. Leyton denied that she was
a member or that she had any
knowledge of the League's mem
bership at Stanford.
Although there is no indication
that she joined the League, COP
member Ingrid Nava, who was
recently re-elected to a second
term, was heavily recruited by the
League beginning at the end of
last summer, according to a num
ber of students. Nava refused to
return numerous phone calls.
At the end of last summer, Nava
lived briefly at a house on Bryant
Street in Palo Alto known sar
castically by some progressive stu
dents as the "Revolutionary
Hotel," where recruitment for the
League has occurred, according to
sources who say they have been
recruited.
Tsutaoka and Steven Phillips,
a former BSU chair and current
Daily multicultural editor who
has allegedly recruited for the
League, currently live in the
house. Phillips recruited Nava be
ginning in September, according
to a student who was also
recruited by the League.
Phillips said he had no knowl
edge of the League's involvement
at Stanford and has not recruited
for the organization.
Takeover planning
A steering committee which was
comprised of at least two mem
bers of the League and several
others who were being actively
recruited at the time were behind
much of the planning for the May
15, 1989, takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. The protest was staged to
demand an Asian-American
tenured professor position, a full
time Chicano dean and a director
for the African and Afro-
American Studies Program
among other goals. Although
these goals were widely accepted
in the color communities that
sponsored the action, it was the
tactics of the takeover planned by
the committee that alienated
many students.
"It was the tactics and not the

goals (of the takeover) that were
planned" by members of the
League who sat on the committee,
according to a student arrested
for involvement in the takeover
who knew of the League's influ
ence. "When specific decisions are
made about what tactics to use,
such as whether or not to do a
takeover for example, these people
have a lot of influence, because
they're the ones who are leaders."
Most people involved in the
takeover did not know of the
League's influence in the tactical
planning of the action. Steve
Ostrander, a senior who was ar
rested in the takeover, said he
was "shocked" when he was told
in January that some of the
people he had worked with on the
takeover and other issues were
League members.
Ostrander said he felt "manip
ulated" by the League members
because he was not told "where
the power was really coming
from."
"I had worked feverishly [in
progressive politics] . . . but in the
end these people couldn't tell me
what was really going on," he said.
Committee members were se
lected from the ASSU Committee
on Democracy in Education,
AASA, MEChA, the Stanford
American Indian Organization
and the black community. The
BSU did not officially approve of
the takeover but supported the
participation of individuals within
the BSU.
The steering committee met in
complete secrecy, deciding that a
physical takeover of the building
would be necessary to achieve its
goals. Gina Hernandez from
MEChA and Leyton from CODE,
who sat on the steering commit
tee, are League members, accord
ing to a number of sources who
asked not to be identified. Leyton
denied having any connections
with the League. Hernandez said
she had never heard of the
League.
Although students allegedly as
sociated with the League com
prised much of the leadership of
students in the takeover, most
students involved in the takeover,
and even some of the planners,
were not told of their influence,
according to sources. Most stu
dents involved in the takeover
only became aware of the specific
action the night before it hap
pened.
"Whenever you take over a
building, there has to be a certain
degree of secrecy," Leyton told
The Daily last month.
Students allegedly connected to
the League from other univer
sities, including San Jose State,
UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz and
San Francisco State, were also
present at the takeover to show
their support for the action.
Administration response
Administration officials said
they had some indication that the
League was involved in the
takeover, but did not attempt to
investigate the influences of the

League.
Kennedy said he was aware of
"outside influences" at the
takeover, but said he did not in
vestigate them because that
would be interpreted by the stu
dents involved as an "effort to
disregard the message in favor of
finding a messenger to shoot."
Kennedy also said he had little
evidence to substantiate the claim
of League involvement in the
takeover.
"On the other hand, I really
am concerned when students, and
particularly freshmen, are influ
enced by people who are working
for their own secret agendas. .. .
If there was any of that, then I'm
troubled by it,"he said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said it would be
"counterproductive" to investi
gate outside influences on the
takeover. "All I know is that I
was dealing with 50-plus students
who were occupying the Presi
dent's office, and like they hold
us accountable for the University,
we hold them accountable for
what they're doing (regardless of
outside influences)," he said.
Students associated with the
League are also in part responsi
ble for last year's resignation of
Juan Yniguez, the former director
of El Centro Chicano and dean of
Chicano affairs, who was pres
sured by some MEChA members
to resign from his post. Yniguez
had been critical of the influence
of the League in MEChA before
he was pressured to resign. Pres
sure from within MEChA came
from both League and non-
League people.
Divisive effects
The League has often had
divisive effects on the various
color communities. Deep ideolog
ical divisions within the Stanford
Chicano community have been in
part the result of the League's
influence within MEChA, accord
ing to a number of students and
staff members in the Chicano
community critical of the League.
League members at Stanford
are "good people, political ac
tivists, but their tactics cause the
most problems in minority com
munities," said Rudy Fuentes, a
co-founder of Stanford MEChA in
1985 and a former Council of
Presidents member who currently
attends Boalt Law School at UC-
Berkeley.
The League at Stanford has
found support over the years in
the membership of MEChA,
where recruitment of MEChA
members into the League is con
ducted by former MEChA
members, according to sources.
The League has had more influ
ence in MEChA in past years than
it holds now, but its power
decreased last year with the grad
uation of a number of MEChA
members allegedly associated
with the League. However, the
League still influences many de
cisions of MEChA through its ties
with some MEChA members, ac
cording to a MEChA member who

did not wish to be identified.
More subtle divisions within the
BSU and AASA have also resulted
because of the League, with only
a few members of each group con
nected to the League.
Little influence in BSU
This year the League has little
influence in the BSU because of
the actions by the BSU officer
corps to reduce the power of stu
dents they believe to be League
members within the BSU. Last
spring, outgoing BSU chair Mary
Dillard warned incoming chair
Calvin Joel Martin about the
power of the League.
BSU officers interviewed by
The Daily said there was an in
ternal division in the BSU based
on League membership, with
more progressive members in one
faction and a more moderate fac
tion headed by Martin. But Mar
tin and other BSU officers said
they had no solid evidence that
individuals within the black com
munity were League members.
"Everybody writes [League
members] off as being too radi
cal," according to former BSU
general representative Bacardi
Jackson. "It's not active members
of the BSU that they get their
respect from."
The takeover caused a notice
able schism in the BSU officer
corps last year, alienating League
members from a more moderate
faction led by Martin. The BSU
officer corps did not officially en
dorse the takeover and did not
even know a takeover was sched
uled until the day before it hap
pened, according to Martin.
"The takeover was their mis
take in the black community, be
cause it created this division,"
according to one BSU member
who was recruited by the League.
The student, who participated in
the takeover, asked not to be iden
tified.
'Like a lackey'
Stanford's Asian-American
community has several people
who are League members, accord
ing to Suh, the AASA chair who
resigned in October because of the
League's influence.

In October, Suh submitted a

dents involved as an "effort to
disregard the message in favor of
finding a messenger to shoot."
Kennedy also said he had little
evidence to substantiate the claim
of League involvement in the
takeover.
"On the other hand, I really
am concerned when students, and
particularly freshmen, are influ
enced by people who are working
for their own secret agendas. .. .
If there was any of that, then I'm
troubled by it,"he said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said it would be
"counterproductive" to investi
gate outside influences on the
takeover. "All I know is that I
was dealing with 50-plus students
who were occupying the Presi
dent's office, and like they hold
us accountable for the University,
we hold them accountable for
what they're doing (regardless of
outside influences)," he said.
Students associated with the
League are also in part responsi
ble for last year's resignation of
Juan Yniguez, the former director
of El Centro Chicano and dean of
Chicano affairs, who was pres
sured by some MEChA members
to resign from his post. Yniguez
had been critical of the influence
of the League in MEChA before
he was pressured to resign. Pres
sure from within MEChA came
from both League and non-
League people.
Divisive effects
The League has often had
divisive effects on the various
color communities. Deep ideolog
ical divisions within the Stanford
Chicano community have been in
part the result of the League's
influence within MEChA, accord
ing to a number of students and
staff members in the Chicano
community critical of the League.
League members at Stanford
are "good people, political ac
tivists, but their tactics cause the
most problems in minority com
munities," said Rudy Fuentes, a
co-founder of Stanford MEChA in
1985 and a former Council of
Presidents member who currently
attends Boalt Law School at UC-
Berkeley.
The League at Stanford has
found support over the years in
the membership of MEChA,
where recruitment of MEChA
members into the League is con
ducted by former MEChA
members, according to sources.
The League has had more influ
ence in MEChA in past years than
it holds now, but its power
decreased last year with the grad
uation of a number of MEChA
members allegedly associated
with the League. However, the
League still influences many de
cisions of MEChA through its ties
with some MEChA members, ac
cording to a MEChA member who

did not wish to be identified.
More subtle divisions within the
BSU and AASA have also resulted
because of the League, with only
a few members of each group con
nected to the League.
Little influence in BSU
This year the League has little
influence in the BSU because of
the actions by the BSU officer
corps to reduce the power of stu
dents they believe to be League
members within the BSU. Last
spring, outgoing BSU chair Mary
Dillard warned incoming chair
Calvin Joel Martin about the
power of the League.
BSU officers interviewed by
The Daily said there was an in
ternal division in the BSU based
on League membership, with
more progressive members in one
faction and a more moderate fac
tion headed by Martin. But Mar
tin and other BSU officers said
they had no solid evidence that
individuals within the black com
munity were League members.
"Everybody writes [League
members] off as being too radi
cal," according to former BSU
general representative Bacardi
Jackson. "It's not active members
of the BSU that they get their
respect from."
The takeover caused a notice
able schism in the BSU officer
corps last year, alienating League
members from a more moderate
faction led by Martin. The BSU
officer corps did not officially en
dorse the takeover and did not
even know a takeover was sched
uled until the day before it hap
pened, according to Martin.
"The takeover was their mis
take in the black community, be
cause it created this division,"
according to one BSU member
who was recruited by the League.
The student, who participated in
the takeover, asked not to be iden
tified.
'Like a lackey'
Stanford's Asian-American
community has several people
who are League members, accord
ing to Suh, the AASA chair who
resigned in October because of the
League's influence.
Although at the time he said
publicly that he resigned for "per
sonal reasons," Suh recently told
The Daily he resigned because he
was disillusioned with the League.
"I decided at some point that I
felt like a lackey, because on a
theoretical level [League mem
bers] were fighting for ... an
other agenda."
"I felt that the progressive pol
itics at Stanford were so
dominated by this group, that I
didn't feel independent unless I
disconnected myself from progres
sive politics for a while," he said.
In October, Suh submitted a
letter of resignation to AASA
members he believed to be mem
bers of the League in which he
indirectly criticized the presence
of the League in the Asian-
American community.
There is currently a minor split

in the Asian-American communi
ty, which Suh and others in the
community partially attribute to
the League. However, others say
the split is based primarily on the
conflicting personalities of AASA
members.
Julie Su, who resigned in March
as the co-chair of the AASA issues
committee, said she was unaware
of the League presence at Stan
ford, and that "the split is based
on personality more than any
thing else." She cited frustrations
in dealing with more radical offi
cers of AASA as the reason for
her resignation.
The AASA officer corps has
very little League influence at the
top levels, although a few AASA
members are alleged to be league
members by Suh and other
sources.
Tsutaoka is the League leader
in the Stanford Asian-American
community and also has wide in
fluence in the other color commu
nities, according to Suh and a
number of other sources.
Suh said Tsutaoka has an "inor
dinate amount of power and in
fluence in Asian-American
student politics" because she is
consulted on many important de
cisions within AASA, despite no
longer being a student. Tsutaoka
has also written for Unity news
paper, a League publication.
Writers for Unity newspaper do
not necessarily have any connec
tions to the League.
Although Unity newspaper
originally called itself the news
paper of the League, it no longer
admits its ties to the League. It
is published by Getting Together
Publications, which prints the
Forward Journal of Socialist
Thought, the League's journal, as
well as other League publications.
Troubled by secrecy
Kennedy said he was aware of
the existence of the League and
its presence at Stanford, but said
he had no specific knowledge of
its activities or membership. "If
I'm troubled by anything, it's the
secrecy. It's that there is an or
ganization that is active and
plainly has a political agenda, and
that nobody is saying anything
about it," Kennedy said.
"That's a whole lot less open
than the traditions of this com
munity," he added.
Other administrators said they
were also aware of the League
but did not know the extent of
its influence. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said he has
known of the existence of the
League since "the late 1970s or
early 1980s" when he saw Unity
newspapers being distributed on
campus.
Lyons said he was never par
ticularly concerned with the in
fluence of the League at Stanford
because "it smacks to me of the
kind of small-group movement
oriented political activist groups
that have characterized American
higher education throughout its
history."
A secretive nationwide organization
called the League of Revolutionary
Struggle (Marxist-Leninist) has been a
little-iuiown factor in student politics at
Stanford for several years, a Daily in
vestigation-has -ftrond: — — - -
Through the selective recruitment of
Stanford students into its organization,
the League has been able to influence

aspects of progressive politics on campus
by trying to place its members in lead
ership positions within the ASSU, the
communities of color and in staff posi
tions.
The total number of Stanford stu
dents and staff members who are League
members is apparently fewer than 30,
but these individuals are in positions
that allow them to shape Btudent gov
ernment policies, according to a number
of sources who said they have either

been recruited by the League or have
worked with League members in the
ASSU or student of color organizations.
The presence of the League has been
in part responsible for dramatic effects
at Stanford, ranging from divisions
within the communities of color to the
pressured resignation of an administra
tor to parts of the planning of last
spring's takeover of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office.
However, most students involved in

progressive politics, including many
leaders of the ASSU and student of color
organizations interviewed by The Daily,
are unaware of the League's presence.
The League, based in the Bay Area
but with membership across the coun
try, has been able to recruit Stanford
students into its organization in a man
ner secret enough so that students are
not initially told they are being recruited
by the League, according to several
Stanford students who said they were

recruited but did not join the League.
Recruitment of individuals by the
League is generally conducted over a
long period of time, several years in
some cases, according to students who
were recruited. Students who are suc
cessfully recruited by the League are
then able to further the League's goals
by running for student offices and help
ing to determine policies in the ASSU
and other student groups.
Three-month investigation
Over the past three months,
The Daily has interviewed dozens
of students who have some
familiarity with the League.
These interviews were part of an
investigation of the League which
included more than 100 inter
views with students, administra
tion officials and nationwide
experts.
Many students interviewed by
The Daily asked not to be identi
fied because they said they are
afraid of harassment by League
members. Former Asian Ameri
can Student Association chair
Richard Suh said he was heavily
recruited by Elsa Tsutaoka, the
office manager of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center for three
years, but eventually decided
against joining the League.
Suh sat on the committee that
planned the takeover and was
himself arrested in the action. In
addition, Suh was selected for the
search committee that found a
new Asian-American dean last
spring after the resignation of the
outgoing dean.
Suh said he was primarily con
cerned about the secrecy of the
organization. According to Suh,
when Tsutaoka asked him to ap
ply for membership in the League,
Suh asked her which Stanford
students were members of the
League. "You shouldn't ask that
question," was the reply, he said.
Tsutaoka denied having any
knowledge of the League or that
she had ever recruited for the
League.
Because the recruitment proc
ess is secretive and individuals
refuse to acknowledge that they
are members of the League, it is
difficult to prove whether anyone
is a League member.
League theory
According to League theory, the
United States is composed of
various "oppressed nations," such
as the Afro-American nation in
the South, the Chicano nation in
the Southwest and the Asian-
American nation. The overall goal
of the League has been the liber
ation of these nationalities under
a socialist state, according to a
1986 League publication called
"Peace, Justice, Equality and
Socialism" that explains its goals.
Until it can gain enough sup
port to stage a revolution, the
League attempts to "organize,
agitate and educate the masses"
by working with more main
stream groups, according to the
publication. By making mass or
ganizations more radical, the
League can gain enough support
for its "protracted revolution" in
the United States, the publication
states.
Unlike the Communist Party
USA, which is a predominantly
white organization, the League
focuses on mass organizations

dealing with people of color for
its support within student and
labor movements. At Stanford,
the League has tried to work
toward its goals with varying
degrees of success in MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group;
AASA; the Black Student Union
and the ASSU through the
People's Platform.
Although the League has
operated in almost complete
secrecy at Stanford, there has
been a growing awareness of its
presence, in large part because of
The Daily's investigation.
League members at Stanford
"are leading progressive politics
on campus ... because they are
the best and the hardest
workers," Suh said.
Council of Presidents member
David Brown and former COP
member Stacey Leyton are both
believed to be members of the
League, according to a number of
sources. Brown refused to com
ment. Leyton denied that she was
a member or that she had any
knowledge of the League's mem
bership at Stanford.
Although there is no indication
that she joined the League, COP
member Ingrid Nava, who was
recently re-elected to a second
term, was heavily recruited by the
League beginning at the end of
last summer, according to a num
ber of students. Nava refused to
return numerous phone calls.
At the end of last summer, Nava
lived briefly at a house on Bryant
Street in Palo Alto known sar
castically by some progressive stu
dents as the "Revolutionary
Hotel," where recruitment for the
League has occurred, according to
sources who say they have been
recruited.
Tsutaoka and Steven Phillips,
a former BSU chair and current
Daily multicultural editor who
has allegedly recruited for the
League, currently live in the
house. Phillips recruited Nava be
ginning in September, according
to a student who was also
recruited by the League.
Phillips said he had no knowl
edge of the League's involvement
at Stanford and has not recruited
for the organization.
Takeover planning
A steering committee which was
comprised of at least two mem
bers of the League and several
others who were being actively
recruited at the time were behind
much of the planning for the May
15, 1989, takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. The protest was staged to
demand an Asian-American
tenured professor position, a full
time Chicano dean and a director
for the African and Afro-
American Studies Program
among other goals. Although
these goals were widely accepted
in the color communities that
sponsored the action, it was the
tactics of the takeover planned by
the committee that alienated
many students.
"It was the tactics and not the

goals (of the takeover) that were
planned" by members of the
League who sat on the committee,
according to a student arrested
for involvement in the takeover
who knew of the League's influ
ence. "When specific decisions are
made about what tactics to use,
such as whether or not to do a
takeover for example, these people
have a lot of influence, because
they're the ones who are leaders."
Most people involved in the
takeover did not know of the
League's influence in the tactical
planning of the action. Steve
Ostrander, a senior who was ar
rested in the takeover, said he
was "shocked" when he was told
in January that some of the
people he had worked with on the
takeover and other issues were
League members.
Ostrander said he felt "manip
ulated" by the League members
because he was not told "where
the power was really coming
from."
"I had worked feverishly [in
progressive politics] . . . but in the
end these people couldn't tell me
what was really going on," he said.
Committee members were se
lected from the ASSU Committee
on Democracy in Education,
AASA, MEChA, the Stanford
American Indian Organization
and the black community. The
BSU did not officially approve of
the takeover but supported the
participation of individuals within
the BSU.
The steering committee met in
complete secrecy, deciding that a
physical takeover of the building
would be necessary to achieve its
goals. Gina Hernandez from
MEChA and Leyton from CODE,
who sat on the steering commit
tee, are League members, accord
ing to a number of sources who
asked not to be identified. Leyton
denied having any connections
with the League. Hernandez said
she had never heard of the
League.
Although students allegedly as
sociated with the League com
prised much of the leadership of
students in the takeover, most
students involved in the takeover,
and even some of the planners,
were not told of their influence,
according to sources. Most stu
dents involved in the takeover
only became aware of the specific
action the night before it hap
pened.
"Whenever you take over a
building, there has to be a certain
degree of secrecy," Leyton told
The Daily last month.
Students allegedly connected to
the League from other univer
sities, including San Jose State,
UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz and
San Francisco State, were also
present at the takeover to show
their support for the action.
Administration response
Administration officials said
they had some indication that the
League was involved in the
takeover, but did not attempt to
investigate the influences of the

League.
Kennedy said he was aware of
"outside influences" at the
takeover, but said he did not in
vestigate them because that
would be interpreted by the stu
dents involved as an "effort to
disregard the message in favor of
finding a messenger to shoot."
Kennedy also said he had little
evidence to substantiate the claim
of League involvement in the
takeover.
"On the other hand, I really
am concerned when students, and
particularly freshmen, are influ
enced by people who are working
for their own secret agendas. .. .
If there was any of that, then I'm
troubled by it,"he said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said it would be
"counterproductive" to investi
gate outside influences on the

Students associated with the
League are also in part responsi
ble for last year's resignation of
Juan Yniguez, the former director
of El Centro Chicano and dean of
Chicano affairs, who was pres
sured by some MEChA members
to resign from his post. Yniguez
had been critical of the influence
of the League in MEChA before
he was pressured to resign. Pres

recruited.
Tsutaoka and Steven Phillips,
a former BSU chair and current
Daily multicultural editor who
has allegedly recruited for the
League, currently live in the
house. Phillips recruited Nava be
ginning in September, according
to a student who was also
recruited by the League.
Phillips said he had no knowl
edge of the League's involvement
at Stanford and has not recruited
for the organization.
Takeover planning
A steering committee which was
comprised of at least two mem
bers of the League and several
others who were being actively
recruited at the time were behind
much of the planning for the May
15, 1989, takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. The protest was staged to
demand an Asian-American
tenured professor position, a full
time Chicano dean and a director
for the African and Afro-
American Studies Program
among other goals. Although
these goals were widely accepted
in the color communities that
sponsored the action, it was the
tactics of the takeover planned by
the committee that alienated
many students.
"It was the tactics and not the

goals (of the takeover) that were
planned" by members of the
League who sat on the committee,
according to a student arrested
for involvement in the takeover
who knew of the League's influ
ence. "When specific decisions are
made about what tactics to use,
such as whether or not to do a
takeover for example, these people
have a lot of influence, because
they're the ones who are leaders."
Most people involved in the
takeover did not know of the
League's influence in the tactical
planning of the action. Steve
Ostrander, a senior who was ar
rested in the takeover, said he
was "shocked" when he was told
in January that some of the
people he had worked with on the
takeover and other issues were
League members.
Ostrander said he felt "manip
ulated" by the League members
because he was not told "where
the power was really coming
from."
"I had worked feverishly [in
progressive politics] . . . but in the
end these people couldn't tell me
what was really going on," he said.
Committee members were se
lected from the ASSU Committee
on Democracy in Education,
AASA, MEChA, the Stanford
American Indian Organization
and the black community. The
BSU did not officially approve of
the takeover but supported the
participation of individuals within
the BSU.
The steering committee met in
complete secrecy, deciding that a
physical takeover of the building
would be necessary to achieve its
goals. Gina Hernandez from
MEChA and Leyton from CODE,
who sat on the steering commit
tee, are League members, accord
ing to a number of sources who
asked not to be identified. Leyton
denied having any connections
with the League. Hernandez said
she had never heard of the
League.
Although students allegedly as
sociated with the League com
prised much of the leadership of
students in the takeover, most
students involved in the takeover,
and even some of the planners,
were not told of their influence,
according to sources. Most stu
dents involved in the takeover
only became aware of the specific
action the night before it hap
pened.
"Whenever you take over a
building, there has to be a certain
degree of secrecy," Leyton told
The Daily last month.
Students allegedly connected to
the League from other univer
sities, including San Jose State,
UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz and
San Francisco State, were also
present at the takeover to show
their support for the action.
Administration response
Administration officials said
they had some indication that the
League was involved in the
takeover, but did not attempt to
investigate the influences of the

League.
Kennedy said he was aware of
"outside influences" at the
takeover, but said he did not in
vestigate them because that
would be interpreted by the stu
dents involved as an "effort to
disregard the message in favor of
finding a messenger to shoot."
Kennedy also said he had little
evidence to substantiate the claim
of League involvement in the
takeover.
"On the other hand, I really
am concerned when students, and
particularly freshmen, are influ
enced by people who are working
for their own secret agendas. .. .
If there was any of that, then I'm
troubled by it,"he said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said it would be
"counterproductive" to investi
gate outside influences on the
takeover. "All I know is that I
was dealing with 50-plus students
who were occupying the Presi
dent's office, and like they hold
us accountable for the University,
we hold them accountable for
what they're doing (regardless of
outside influences)," he said.
Students associated with the
League are also in part responsi
ble for last year's resignation of
Juan Yniguez, the former director
of El Centro Chicano and dean of
Chicano affairs, who was pres
sured by some MEChA members
to resign from his post. Yniguez
had been critical of the influence
of the League in MEChA before
he was pressured to resign. Pres
sure from within MEChA came
from both League and non-
League people.
Divisive effects
The League has often had
divisive effects on the various
color communities. Deep ideolog
ical divisions within the Stanford
Chicano community have been in
part the result of the League's
influence within MEChA, accord
ing to a number of students and
staff members in the Chicano
community critical of the League.
League members at Stanford
are "good people, political ac
tivists, but their tactics cause the
most problems in minority com
munities," said Rudy Fuentes, a
co-founder of Stanford MEChA in
1985 and a former Council of
Presidents member who currently
attends Boalt Law School at UC-
Berkeley.
The League at Stanford has
found support over the years in
the membership of MEChA,
where recruitment of MEChA
members into the League is con
ducted by former MEChA
members, according to sources.
The League has had more influ
ence in MEChA in past years than
it holds now, but its power
decreased last year with the grad
uation of a number of MEChA
members allegedly associated
with the League. However, the
League still influences many de
cisions of MEChA through its ties
with some MEChA members, ac
cording to a MEChA member who

did not wish to be identified.
More subtle divisions within the
BSU and AASA have also resulted
because of the League, with only
a few members of each group con
nected to the League.
Little influence in BSU
This year the League has little
influence in the BSU because of
the actions by the BSU officer
corps to reduce the power of stu
dents they believe to be League
members within the BSU. Last
spring, outgoing BSU chair Mary
Dillard warned incoming chair
Calvin Joel Martin about the
power of the League.
BSU officers interviewed by
The Daily said there was an in
ternal division in the BSU based
on League membership, with
more progressive members in one
faction and a more moderate fac
tion headed by Martin. But Mar
tin and other BSU officers said
they had no solid evidence that
individuals within the black com
munity were League members.
"Everybody writes [League
members] off as being too radi
cal," according to former BSU
general representative Bacardi
Jackson. "It's not active members
of the BSU that they get their
respect from."
The takeover caused a notice
able schism in the BSU officer
corps last year, alienating League
members from a more moderate
faction led by Martin. The BSU
officer corps did not officially en
dorse the takeover and did not
even know a takeover was sched
uled until the day before it hap
pened, according to Martin.
"The takeover was their mis
take in the black community, be
cause it created this division,"
according to one BSU member
who was recruited by the League.
The student, who participated in
the takeover, asked not to be iden
tified.
'Like a lackey'
Stanford's Asian-American
community has several people
who are League members, accord
ing to Suh, the AASA chair who
resigned in October because of the
League's influence.
Although at the time he said
publicly that he resigned for "per
sonal reasons," Suh recently told
The Daily he resigned because he
was disillusioned with the League.
"I decided at some point that I
felt like a lackey, because on a
theoretical level [League mem
bers] were fighting for ... an
other agenda."
"I felt that the progressive pol
itics at Stanford were so
dominated by this group, that I
didn't feel independent unless I
disconnected myself from progres
sive politics for a while," he said.
In October, Suh submitted a
letter of resignation to AASA
members he believed to be mem
bers of the League in which he
indirectly criticized the presence
of the League in the Asian-
American community.
There is currently a minor split

in the Asian-American communi
ty, which Suh and others in the
community partially attribute to
the League. However, others say
the split is based primarily on the
conflicting personalities of AASA
members.
Julie Su, who resigned in March
as the co-chair of the AASA issues
committee, said she was unaware
of the League presence at Stan
ford, and that "the split is based
on personality more than any
thing else." She cited frustrations
in dealing with more radical offi
cers of AASA as the reason for
her resignation.
The AASA officer corps has
very little League influence at the
top levels, although a few AASA
members are alleged to be league
members by Suh and other
sources.
Tsutaoka is the League leader
in the Stanford Asian-American
community and also has wide in
fluence in the other color commu
nities, according to Suh and a
number of other sources.
Suh said Tsutaoka has an "inor
dinate amount of power and in
fluence in Asian-American
student politics" because she is
consulted on many important de
cisions within AASA, despite no
longer being a student. Tsutaoka
has also written for Unity news
paper, a League publication.
Writers for Unity newspaper do
not necessarily have any connec
tions to the League.
Although Unity newspaper
originally called itself the news
paper of the League, it no longer
admits its ties to the League. It
is published by Getting Together
Publications, which prints the
Forward Journal of Socialist
Thought, the League's journal, as
well as other League publications.
Troubled by secrecy
Kennedy said he was aware of
the existence of the League and
its presence at Stanford, but said
he had no specific knowledge of
its activities or membership. "If
I'm troubled by anything, it's the
secrecy. It's that there is an or
ganization that is active and
plainly has a political agenda, and
that nobody is saying anything
about it," Kennedy said.
"That's a whole lot less open
than the traditions of this com
munity," he added.
Other administrators said they
were also aware of the League
but did not know the extent of
its influence. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said he has
known of the existence of the
League since "the late 1970s or
early 1980s" when he saw Unity
newspapers being distributed on
campus.
Lyons said he was never par
ticularly concerned with the in
fluence of the League at Stanford
because "it smacks to me of the
kind of small-group movement
oriented political activist groups
that have characterized American
higher education throughout its
history."
A secretive nationwide organization
called the League of Revolutionary
Struggle (Marxist-Leninist) has been a
little-iuiown factor in student politics at
Stanford for several years, a Daily in
vestigation-has -ftrond: — — - -
Through the selective recruitment of
Stanford students into its organization,
the League has been able to influence

aspects of progressive politics on campus
by trying to place its members in lead
ership positions within the ASSU, the
communities of color and in staff posi
tions.
The total number of Stanford stu
dents and staff members who are League
members is apparently fewer than 30,
but these individuals are in positions
that allow them to shape Btudent gov
ernment policies, according to a number
of sources who said they have either

been recruited by the League or have
worked with League members in the
ASSU or student of color organizations.
The presence of the League has been
in part responsible for dramatic effects
at Stanford, ranging from divisions
within the communities of color to the
pressured resignation of an administra
tor to parts of the planning of last
spring's takeover of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office.
However, most students involved in

progressive politics, including many
leaders of the ASSU and student of color
organizations interviewed by The Daily,
are unaware of the League's presence.
The League, based in the Bay Area
but with membership across the coun
try, has been able to recruit Stanford
students into its organization in a man
ner secret enough so that students are
not initially told they are being recruited
by the League, according to several
Stanford students who said they were

recruited but did not join the League.
Recruitment of individuals by the
League is generally conducted over a
long period of time, several years in
some cases, according to students who
were recruited. Students who are suc
cessfully recruited by the League are
then able to further the League's goals
by running for student offices and help
ing to determine policies in the ASSU
and other student groups.
Three-month investigation
Over the past three months,
The Daily has interviewed dozens
of students who have some
familiarity with the League.
These interviews were part of an
investigation of the League which
included more than 100 inter
views with students, administra
tion officials and nationwide
experts.
Many students interviewed by
The Daily asked not to be identi
fied because they said they are
afraid of harassment by League
members. Former Asian Ameri
can Student Association chair
Richard Suh said he was heavily
recruited by Elsa Tsutaoka, the
office manager of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center for three
years, but eventually decided
against joining the League.
Suh sat on the committee that
planned the takeover and was
himself arrested in the action. In
addition, Suh was selected for the
search committee that found a
new Asian-American dean last
spring after the resignation of the
outgoing dean.
Suh said he was primarily con
cerned about the secrecy of the
organization. According to Suh,
when Tsutaoka asked him to ap
ply for membership in the League,
Suh asked her which Stanford
students were members of the
League. "You shouldn't ask that
question," was the reply, he said.
Tsutaoka denied having any
knowledge of the League or that
she had ever recruited for the
League.
Because the recruitment proc
ess is secretive and individuals
refuse to acknowledge that they
are members of the League, it is
difficult to prove whether anyone
is a League member.
League theory
According to League theory, the
United States is composed of
various "oppressed nations," such
as the Afro-American nation in
the South, the Chicano nation in
the Southwest and the Asian-
American nation. The overall goal
of the League has been the liber
ation of these nationalities under
a socialist state, according to a
1986 League publication called
"Peace, Justice, Equality and
Socialism" that explains its goals.
Until it can gain enough sup
port to stage a revolution, the
League attempts to "organize,
agitate and educate the masses"
by working with more main
stream groups, according to the
publication. By making mass or
ganizations more radical, the
League can gain enough support
for its "protracted revolution" in
the United States, the publication
states.
Unlike the Communist Party
USA, which is a predominantly
white organization, the League
focuses on mass organizations

dealing with people of color for
its support within student and
labor movements. At Stanford,
the League has tried to work
toward its goals with varying
degrees of success in MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group;
AASA; the Black Student Union
and the ASSU through the
People's Platform.
Although the League has
operated in almost complete
secrecy at Stanford, there has
been a growing awareness of its
presence, in large part because of
The Daily's investigation.
League members at Stanford
"are leading progressive politics
on campus ... because they are
the best and the hardest
workers," Suh said.
Council of Presidents member
David Brown and former COP
member Stacey Leyton are both
believed to be members of the
League, according to a number of
sources. Brown refused to com
ment. Leyton denied that she was
a member or that she had any
knowledge of the League's mem
bership at Stanford.
Although there is no indication
that she joined the League, COP
member Ingrid Nava, who was
recently re-elected to a second
term, was heavily recruited by the
League beginning at the end of
last summer, according to a num
ber of students. Nava refused to
return numerous phone calls.
At the end of last summer, Nava
lived briefly at a house on Bryant
Street in Palo Alto known sar
castically by some progressive stu
dents as the "Revolutionary
Hotel," where recruitment for the
League has occurred, according to
sources who say they have been
recruited.
Tsutaoka and Steven Phillips,
a former BSU chair and current
Daily multicultural editor who
has allegedly recruited for the
League, currently live in the
house. Phillips recruited Nava be
ginning in September, according
to a student who was also
recruited by the League.
Phillips said he had no knowl
edge of the League's involvement
at Stanford and has not recruited
for the organization.
