Valid process selected a distinguished professor

IN RESPONSE TO the recent flier
regarding Gordon Chang and some
misconceptions caused by the flier,
we, the Asian American Student Asso
ciation, would like to present important
unaddressed issues.
• Professors should be judged by
their scholarship, not by smears about
their supposed political lives. The
selection process is based on academic
scholarship and qualification, and
Chang's selection indicates that he is
indeed qualified to teach.
Chang received a Ph.D. in history
from Stanford. For many years, he was
a member of the research faculty of
the Institute for International Studies
here at Stanford. Beyond his position
at the Institute, Chang taught Asian-
American studies without additional
compensation.
Chang is widely respected as an
expert on United States-China relations

and Asian-American studies. Presently
he is an assistant professor at UC-
Irvine.
• Authorship of the flier was claimed
by groups whose purpose and activities
are ambiguous. Constructive discussion
of the issues raised by the flier is
impossible because the author remains
unknown.
If the authors of the flier are truly
concerned about the issues, we encour
age them to come out and identify
themselves so that dialogue which is
presently not taking place can become
possible.
• There is no evidence that the
selection process was controlled by any
outside organization. The selection
process involved not only students but
also many different faculty and staff.
The search committee of faculty and
staff included: John Meyers, sociolgy;
Lawrence Lau, economics; Sylvia

Yanagisako, anthropology; Ewart
Thomas, dean of Humanities and
Sciences; Estelle Freedman, history;
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of Student
Affairs; and Peter Duus, history.
The creation of the tenure-track
Asian-American studies position ulti
mately involved Provost James Rosse
and University President Donald Ken
nedy. The effort to bring Asian-
American studies to campus has in
volved the broad support of many
students, not just students of color,
and it has also received support from
faculty and administrators.
• The point of establishing Asian-
American studies was not to bring any
particular individual to Stanford but to
expand Stanford's academic horizons to
include traditionally ignored fields of
scholarship. The flier states that the
whole point of the takeover last year
was to bring "Red Guard Gordie" to

Stanford.
We would like to point out that the
students worked for a tenure-track
Asian-American studies position even
before the takeover. In addition, the
takeover was not exculsively held to
obtain this professorship, which in
turn was not specifically designated for
Chang.
• The use of the terrorist methods
that the Stanford Central American
Action Network is trying to educate us
about endangers academic freedom on
campus. The fliers are reminiscent of
McCarthyist tactics that limited aca
demic freedom in the 19505. All faculty
and staff should be concerned about
this threat to studying and teaching
freely regardless of beliefs.
