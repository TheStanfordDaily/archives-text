# Leftist groups are silenced in modern America
## 
### 
As a visitor at Stanford, I have gen
erally been impressed with the open
discussion that seems to occur here.
The "He's a slime" poster slandering
Gordon Chang and The Daily's
"expoB6" of the League of Revolution
ary Struggle certainly changed that
perception.
The freedom of speech of the right,
which currently dominates politics, the
courts and much of the media, is not
in danger of being repressed in this
country.
On the other hand, we have a long
history of repressing leftist groups
rather than dealing with the substance

of what they have to say. In 1979 the
Ku Klux KJan, guided by an agent of
the FBI, murdered five members of a
Communist anti-Klan group in broad
daylight in Greensboro, N.C. Bud and
Ruth Schultz provide many other ex
amples of such blatant repression in a
recent University of California Press
book, "It Did Happen Here."
It seems obvious to me that we need
a wide-ranging discussion about possi
ble solutions to the overwhelming
problems that exist in this country and
the world today. The attacks on Prof.
Chang and your "expose" helped to
close down, rather than open up,
debate.
What we don't need is more repres
sion, overt or subtle, of the few leftist
groups that exist in George Bush's
America.
