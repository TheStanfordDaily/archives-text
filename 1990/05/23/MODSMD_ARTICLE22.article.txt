# Columnist should comment on events he attended
## 
### 
I find it amazing that Alex Grant
can criticize the College Repubicans
when he was not even at the meeting
where the informational AIDS video
was shown.
His article was just a typical attack
of the Liberal Left here at Stanford.
He calls the incident "disgraceful,"
yet how does he know this? Corey
Davis was at the meeting, and he has
every right to express his opinion.
Grant should write on things he
knows (like international relations), not
on things he happens to hear from a
third, fourth or fifth party.
