## Facing fear has rewards 
### 
NOW THAT THE year is almost
over, it's time to grade myself as
a resident assistant. Seeing as how
Stanford is good for grade inflation, I
think I can fairly give myself an A-. (All
right, so I didn't always buy food for the
hall meetings — y'all are too greedy any
way! Is a B+ better?)
Being an RA is hard work. You have
to put up with some crazy stuff: serving
as locksmith for dufus residents who lock
themselves out of their rooms, including
fellow RAs; playing Mommy, Daddy and
Rover for homesick freshmen; and con
stantly reminding folks that their
momma doesn't live here, so they have
to clean up after themselves.
But for me the hardest part about being
an RA has been dealing with residents
who have blown me off, purposely avoided
me and refused to engage me on issues
of race and sexual orientation.
Maybe it's because Stanford has be
come so politically and racially charged
that some people feel they can't express
an opinion without being termed a racist.
Maybe it's because some people are so
concerned about being "politically cor
rect" that they suppress their true
feelings and forgo debate. Maybe it's be
cause my being outspoken about my racial
identity and homosexuality offends and
scares some people.
I consider myself a good listener and
an open-minded individual, so it's puz
zling at best and discouraging at worst
when a resident refuses to associate or
engage me on important issues, or doesn't
want to have anything to do with me at

all. In the end we both miss out — we
both miss an opportunity to make a new
friend, or at least to come to an under
standing of each other.
So why am I going to be an RA again,
and in Otero — scene of the infamous
"Otero Incident?" And why in God's name
am I leaving the comforts of Ujamaa to
be an RAin a predominantly white dorm?
It can only be one of two answers:
either I'm crazy or I'm crazy. Yes, I'm
crazy. I'm crazy for a new challenge. I'm
crazy about meeting new people, and I'm
crazy about my new resident fellow and
the rest of the staff.
Being an RAin Otero will be another
stop on that personal and cultural jour
ney that I mentioned in a previous
column. Since I've been at Stanford, I've
gone from "Pseudo Black" to "Super
Black," and this year I've finally become
fully comfortable with myself and my life
experience.
I'm not saying it's easy to be black and
gay. I still get angry sometimes when I
watch television and see racist portrayals
of black people, or when I don't see my
life reflected at all. For the most part
people like me still remain the "Invisible
Man."
Rather than disconnect myself from
the world or drown myself in a sea of
anger and pity, I'd rather develop new
relationships with people of any color
who are sincerely interested in building
a multicultural society that is built on
respect for differences in race, religion,
sex and sexual orientation.
Yet I'm still scared to be an RA. As a

politically conscious and openly black gay
man, my biggest worry is how I'm going
to relate to a generally naive group of
freshmen, some of whom have never met
a black or openly gay person, let alone
discussed issues of race or sexuality.
Will someone scribble "nigger" on my
door, or hold a KKK-like vigil outside my
dorm? Will some macho stud threaten to
kick my ass because I'm gay? Or worse,
will the residents ignore me and refuse
to engage me about issues of race and
sexuality, and about myself?
I'm scared, but I tend to take my big
gest steps when I'm afraid. I don't want
fear to prevent me living my life. Fortu
nately, each time that I've acted in spite
of fear, I've had a rewarding experience,
and that's exactly what I expect in Otero.
I'm not going to pretend that the world
is perfect and filled with racial harmony.
I'm not going to pretend that I'm
straight. You see, I can't live for anyone
but Corey. All I can do is remain open
minded and honest, and hope that people
meet me halfway.
