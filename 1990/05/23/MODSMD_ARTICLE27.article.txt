## Reckless charges against reporter unwarranted 
### 
WHEN I FIRST launched an
investigation into the League
of Revolutionary Struggle and
its influence at Stanford in late Febru
ary, I knew that I had to expect a
certain amount of opposition.
I was expecting bitter criticism on
the justification for why I was investi
gating the group, which I received. The
question of whether the investigation
had elements of McCarthyism is a
legitimate concern, and one that I have
tried to reconcile.
I was expecting protestations from
progressive students with the concern
that this had the potential of damaging
the multicultural agenda. I received
these worthy criticisms as well.
I was not, however, prepared for the
litany of personal and unfounded
charges against me as an individual
that tried to link alleged moral
shortcomings to my integrity as an
investigative reporter.
Since last week, I have been sub
jected to a wide array of unsubstantia
ted and damaging accusations. I have
been attacked for my judgment in
pursuing my investigation, in large
part based on the presumption that
somehow I have a personal political
agenda that drives me on some blind
attack against the League.
I am incredulous when I hear

reports that my political convictions
are assailed in public by students and
University staff members who are
complete strangers to me. How is it
that these strangers all of a sudden
have some insight into my alleged
political beliefs?
First of all, let me set the record
straight about my political agenda. It
does not differ significantly from many
of those who are the most vocal in
attacking me. I am a liberal Democrat
who very strongly supports the pro
gressive agenda at Stanford espoused
by the People's Platform, if not always
the tactics that are used in achieving
it.
It is unfortunate that I have to
defend myself on this issue. I should
not have to feel the need to state
whether or not I am "politically cor
rect" and establish my liberal creden
tials. Ideally, Stanford should not be a
place where one is attacked for politi
cal beliefs, regardless of whether those
beliefs be right-wing or left-wing.
One of the most remarkable ele
ments of this campaign against me is
that never once have I been asked
what my political convictions are.
Community members have called my
journalistic integrity into question, but
the hypocrisy of that attack is seen
when one considers the irresponsible

Tainting me with the
label of a racist as a
knee-jerk reaction is
irresponsibly
defamatory and slan
derous.

nature of the charges against me,
when lies about my beliefs are openly
distributed without even an attempt to
verify their accuracy.
By far the most reckless of the
charges against me is that I, as a
white man, have racial biases that
have motivated me in pursuit of this
story. More directly, in a number of
cases I have been called a racist for
my actions.
This is the charge that hurts me the
most. With one sweeping irresponsible
charge against me, everything that I
believe in most strongly has been
called into question, exposing me to
the suspicions of people who don't
know me and who don't know of my
strong personal convictions to this
University's efforts toward a multicul
tural environment.

Was I a racist when I worked to
bring to light the living conditions of
Webb Ranch workers in an investiga
tive series of articles that brought
public outrage against Webb Ranch?
Was I a racist when I helped Tresidder
custodians, who are all people of color,
to retain their jobs in a series of arti
cles in the fall?
The insidious effects of racism
throughout the nation, including Stan
ford, must be fought at every step of
the way, and I commend the efforts of
student leaders in the People's Plat
form and others in the community to
do exactly that.
Since conducting acts of overt or
covert racism is such a horrible of
fense, to accuse an individual of racism
is a serious charge that cannot be
made responsibly without a careful and
thorough assessment of the facts.
Tainting me with the label of a racist
as a knee-jerk reaction is irresponsibly
defamatory and slanderous, without
any basis in the truth.
I hereby publicly demand that the
irresponsible tactics of character assas
sination being waged against me cease
immediately.
Stanford should be an environment
of enlightened discussion of all relevant
issues, not one of harassment against
individuals that challenge the accepted

"truths" that govern our lives.
If people could realize the inner
turmoil that I have been suffering as a
result of my investigation, always
fighting between the necessity for
opening up the political process at
Stanford through an investigation of
the League, and the potential damage
of the results to progressive politics, I
would not be receiving these attacks.
If individuals in the community wish
to investigate whatever possible politi
cal or racial biases that I have in my
investigation of the League, I suggest
they start by talking to me and my
friends, who understand my unswerv
ing commitment to multiculturalism
and the progressive agenda.
Only then can we conceivably salvage
some enlightened discussion from what
has been up to now a reckless smear
campaign intended to ruthlessly assail
my credibility as a journalist.

ted and damaging accusations. I have
been attacked for my judgment in
pursuing my investigation, in large
part based on the presumption that
somehow I have a personal political
agenda that drives me on some blind
attack against the League.
I am incredulous when I hear

reports that my political convictions
are assailed in public by students and
University staff members who are
complete strangers to me. How is it
that these strangers all of a sudden
have some insight into my alleged
political beliefs?
First of all, let me set the record
straight about my political agenda. It
does not differ significantly from many
of those who are the most vocal in
attacking me. I am a liberal Democrat
who very strongly supports the pro
gressive agenda at Stanford espoused
by the People's Platform, if not always
the tactics that are used in achieving
it.
It is unfortunate that I have to
defend myself on this issue. I should
not have to feel the need to state
whether or not I am "politically cor
rect" and establish my liberal creden
tials. Ideally, Stanford should not be a
place where one is attacked for politi
cal beliefs, regardless of whether those
beliefs be right-wing or left-wing.
One of the most remarkable ele
ments of this campaign against me is
that never once have I been asked
what my political convictions are.
Community members have called my
journalistic integrity into question, but
the hypocrisy of that attack is seen
when one considers the irresponsible

Tainting me with the
label of a racist as a
knee-jerk reaction is
irresponsibly
defamatory and slan
derous.

nature of the charges against me,
when lies about my beliefs are openly
distributed without even an attempt to
verify their accuracy.
By far the most reckless of the
charges against me is that I, as a
white man, have racial biases that
have motivated me in pursuit of this
story. More directly, in a number of
cases I have been called a racist for
my actions.
This is the charge that hurts me the
most. With one sweeping irresponsible
charge against me, everything that I
believe in most strongly has been
called into question, exposing me to
the suspicions of people who don't
know me and who don't know of my
strong personal convictions to this
University's efforts toward a multicul
tural environment.

Was I a racist when I worked to
bring to light the living conditions of
Webb Ranch workers in an investiga
tive series of articles that brought
public outrage against Webb Ranch?
Was I a racist when I helped Tresidder
custodians, who are all people of color,
to retain their jobs in a series of arti
cles in the fall?
The insidious effects of racism
throughout the nation, including Stan
ford, must be fought at every step of
the way, and I commend the efforts of
student leaders in the People's Plat
form and others in the community to
do exactly that.
Since conducting acts of overt or
covert racism is such a horrible of
fense, to accuse an individual of racism
is a serious charge that cannot be
made responsibly without a careful and
thorough assessment of the facts.
Tainting me with the label of a racist
as a knee-jerk reaction is irresponsibly
defamatory and slanderous, without
any basis in the truth.
I hereby publicly demand that the
irresponsible tactics of character assas
sination being waged against me cease
immediately.
Stanford should be an environment
of enlightened discussion of all relevant
issues, not one of harassment against
individuals that challenge the accepted

"truths" that govern our lives.
If people could realize the inner
turmoil that I have been suffering as a
result of my investigation, always
fighting between the necessity for
opening up the political process at
Stanford through an investigation of
the League, and the potential damage
of the results to progressive politics, I
would not be receiving these attacks.
If individuals in the community wish
to investigate whatever possible politi
cal or racial biases that I have in my
investigation of the League, I suggest
they start by talking to me and my
friends, who understand my unswerv
ing commitment to multiculturalism
and the progressive agenda.
Only then can we conceivably salvage
some enlightened discussion from what
has been up to now a reckless smear
campaign intended to ruthlessly assail
my credibility as a journalist.
