## Asparagus makes urine smell 
### David Ehrhardt Brian White Staff writers 
The Bugs appreciate the questions we
received in response to our shameless
begging last week. Keep those cards and
letters coming!
Q m How can I phrase this delicately ?
• Why does my passed water smell
particularly pungent after I eat
asparagus? Does this happen to every
one?
A. According to a 1987 study by S.C.
• Mitchel and co-workers, the pri
mary volatile components unique to the
urine of asparagus eaters are methanet
hiol, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disul
fide, dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl
sulfone. The first two components in
this list contribute most of the odor, but
dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl sulfone
add to the unique character of the
aroma. When these are added back to
the urine of someone who has not re
cently ingested asparagus, the urine
smells similar to that passed by someone
who has enjoyed a few stalks. The source
of these compounds in the asparagus is
not known, although a sulfur-containing
substance found uniquely in asparagus,
asparagusic acid, is suspected.
It has been passed along anecdotally
for years that some people produce this
smell while others do not. Several
studies have been inconsistent on this
point, the most recent suggesting that
all French people are "stinkers" (does
this remind you of a Warner Brothers
cartoon?), while only a 40 percent in
cidence was reported in Great Britain.
Mitchel again attempts to settle the
issue, reminding us of an important
tenet of experimental science: nothing
clears the air like a well-designed exper
iment.
His group had the urine from 800
people in Great Britain sniffed both
before and after asparagus ingestion.
The panel of testers did not know the
identity of the samples and had demon
strated the ability to consistently dis
criminate asparagus urine from normal
urine. An incidence of 43 percent
stinkers was found in this population,
in agreement with previous reports.
While other studies may not have been
as carefully designed, the possibility was
left open that there may be differences
among populations in the ability to
produce the odor.
Since many of the people tested were
related to each other, Mitchel did a
lineage analysis of stinkers and non
stinkers. The analysis was consistent
with stinkiness being a simple dominant
autosomal trait. If this is true, then if
neither of your parents stink, you won't
either. The frequency of this trait in the
Stanford community is not known, but
the researchers at Bug Research Park
are loath to find out.

. What is sleepwalking? Do people
• dream that they are walking and
actually get up and walk around?
A. We talked to Dr. Alex Clerk of the
• Sleep Disorders Clinic, who gave
us the inside dope on sleepwalking. Sleep
research is one of our favorites here at
Science Bug Naptime Research Park.
Normal sleep has four stages, from
the light sleep of stage one, through the
deepest sleep of stage four. These stages
of sleep are defined largely by levels and
patterns of brain wave activity. Dream
ing, or Rapid Eye Movement sleep, is a
separate state of sleep from stages one
to four.
Usually, a sleeper will cycle through
the stages roughly in order, dropping
down to four and back up to one several
times a night. Unless disturbed, sleepers
normally awaken from stage one or two.
A sleeper in stage four is very difficult
to rouse and is usually very disoriented
upon awakening.
In sleepwalking, sleepers arouse from
stage four and begin moving about.
Their eyes can be either open or closed,
and they seem to negotiate obstacles by
feel or memory. If they are awakened
while walking, they are usually very dis
oriented, suggesting that they are still
in stage four sleep.
Since dreams do not occur in stage
four sleep, the sleepwalker is probably
not acting out a walking dream. It is
thought that strong emotional conflicts
drive people to sleepwalk, but not all
cases can be explained this way.
Presumably, George Bush is running
laps around the White House these
nights, as he decides how to tell people
to forget what he said about taxes.
