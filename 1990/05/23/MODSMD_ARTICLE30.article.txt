# Robots built for space repairs

Space robots have come to Stanford.
Five doctoral students in the Aerospace
Robotics Laboratory have pioneered a
new design which could revolutionize
satellite repair.
The students, directed by Aeronautics
and Astronautics Prof. Robert Cannon,
have been working in this lab for three
years. The purpose of their research,
funded entirely by a five-year contract
with NASA, is "to improve technology
for space robots and to make robots
more effective in the orbital environ
ment," said Ross Koningstein, one of
the researchers.
Marc Ullman, the student responsible
for most of the design of the robots,
used a layer-cake model. The bottom
layer is the gas supply system, which
powers the thrusters located in the next
layer. The third layer contains the
electronic system and battery packs,
while the robot's computer is housed in
the top layer.
The layer-cake design makes the
robots easier to service. "We've had
pieces break and had the robot back
together and functioning within a half
hour," Koningstein said. He added that
experts from aerospace companies who

have looked at their research are very
impressed with the design and think
the industry could learn something
from the project.
"The thrust of the research is to make
space-based manipulation simpler,"
Koningstein said. "People don't have a
very clear model or understanding of
exactly what the problems are or how
to solve them."
To study the problems presented by
trying to manipulate objerts in space,
the researchers began with one-armed
robots. They soon found that moving
objects in space with two arms is easier
than with only one.
Besides using two arms, the robots
have several other special features to
make them both easier to use and com
pletely autonomous in space. An on
board power system and thrusters
enable the robot to move around on its
own. Special sensing equipment linked
to the on-board computer allows the
robot to position itself exactly.
Another problem they encountered is
that in space, there is nothing to use
as a support. When a robot pushes on
a satellite, for example, the robot moves
in the opposite direction from the satel
lite. The purpose of the research is to
figure out how to program the robot to

compensate for such motion. With cur
rent systems, the robots use so much
time, energy and power simply trying
to maintain their position that the proj
ect becomes worthless.
To simulate the space environment,
the robots are floated over a granite
table on an air cushion less than one
thousandth of an inch thick. While the
robots float, the researchers try differ
ent ways of manipulating them to find
the most efficient mode of operation.
Each student focuses on a specific
part of the total problem. For example,
Koningstein described his work as
trying "to figure out how to write con
trol schemes that will allow the robot
arm endpoints to go where you want
them to even though the base is mov
ing." The culmination of the five proj
ects will be a robot capable of servicing
objects in space efficiently and able to
withstand environmental conditions
such as solar radiation.
The entire project is scheduled to con
tinue for the next few years.
Koningstein hopes to finish his part in
six months, while Ullman and the other
researchers — Vincent Chen, Bill Dick
son and Warren Jasper — will complete
their projects later.
