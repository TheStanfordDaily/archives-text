# Apple cuts prices, offers trade-in
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
If Apple Computer were a basketball
team, one might say they were putting
a little run together. After scoring on
an easy layup with the decision to ex
tend warranties to one year, Apple came
back with a three-pointer and a slam
dunk in the form of two fascinating
decisions.
First, the firm announced an impres
sive series of price cuts to the compact
Macintosh series — the Plus, SE and
SE/30. If you stop by Microdisc, you
can plunk down $684 and walk off with
a spanking new Mac Plus.
For only $1,119, the nice Bookstore
folks will hand you an SE with a 20-
megabyte hard disk. Better still, if
you've got $2,023, an SE/30 with a 40-
meg drive is yours for the asking. Even
the elephantine Mac Portable is almost
reasonable at $3,357 including hard
drive.
In the past, Apple cut prices as new,
higher-end models became available. A
couple of years ago the cuts stopped
coming — and sales started to stagnate.
Chairman John Sculley outlined his
new plan for the company in the next
two years. He said, plain and simple,
that Apple wants to capture a bigger
chunk of the market. To do that, Apple
is making available inexpensive Macs
while continuing its parade of higher
end machines to satisfy the need for
speed.

To users it means that
Macs are now competitive
with PC-compatibles. The
recommendation here, if
you have the dollars, is to
pick up an SE/30. You get
a lightning-quick machine
that is protected against
obsolescence for at least
three years.
Whatever choice you
make, you can rest easily

knowing what the low prices mean.
Rumors of Apple's impending demise
have been greatly exaggerated. Instead
of taking a defensive approach to its
marketing, Apple has gone on the at
tack.
If the price cuts can be thought of
as a three-pointer swishing through the
hoop, then the trade-up program is a
Jordanesque slam dunk.
On a few select days in June, Mac
owners no longer need to suffer from
acute jealousy as their friends unpack
a pristine machine from the box.
Through a new program, you will be
able to trade-up your good ol' Mac and
drive a brand new baby off the lot.
The program is a lot like what you
might get from a new car dealer, with
a few important exceptions. The key
similarity is that you will no doubt have
a different opinion than Microdisc about
the worth of your computer. For exam
ple, the original Mac 512K will net
owners just $190 in "trade-up bucks."
On the flip side, the program is a

boon to owners of SEs
who are looking for
SE/30s. If you're tired of
the sluggish SE and you
want to be ready to exploit
Apple's System 7 when it
becomes available, a
trade-in is the solution.
In the past, you could
take your SE with a check
for $1,199 and swap the
main logic board for an

SE/30 board. Whatever was wrong with
your SE — slow hard disk, dim monitor
or pen marks on the case — would still
be there.
Under the trade-in program, you can
take an SE with two floppy drives in
and get $950 credit toward a new Mac.
For another $1,073 you would be
handed a new SE/30 that has a 40-
megabyte hard drive built in.
This is a steal of a deal. Even if your
SE has a hard drive, the numbers look
good. Your trade in would now be worth
$1,092.50.
If upgrading is in your future plans
at all, seize the days (June 7, 8 and
11-15). For other trade-ins, the deal is
still solid but unspectacular. The Mac
II line is still quite expensive compared
to the compact line. But if you were
looking for a Mac II anyway, now is as
good a time as any.
