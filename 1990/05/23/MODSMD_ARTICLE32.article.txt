## Once again reliable O'Brien personifies Card's NCAA play 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. â€” Sophomore
Alex O'Brien always plays best when it
counts most.
In the past two years at the NCAAs,
O'Brien has never lost in dual competition,
winning 10 straight matches in doubles
and singles.
He wins big points more consistently
than any player on the Cardinal team. And
even though he is not the most physically
talented player on the squad, as O'Brien
himself will tell you, he may be the toughest
to beat, especially at the NCAAs.
"He takes his game up another notch at
the NCAAs," Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said.
"I always look for ways to win. I do
anything I can, especially in matches where

I know I need to win," O'Brien said. "When
you know that if you lose you're out, it
makes you try that much harder."
Yesterday, when it counted most, O'Brien
was unstoppable. He decapitated Tennes
see's former No. 1 player, Brice Karsh, 6-1,
6-1.
From the start, O'Brien pounded away
at Karsh, confusing him with moonball
lobs and then powerful ground strokes. But
it was O'Brien's mental attitude that gave
him the most significant edge yesterday.
"I was really pumped to play. I wanted
to jump on top early too, especially after
last night's comeback by Tennessee,"
O'Brien said.
It was only fitting that O'Brien would
serve for the title in the No. 3 doubles
match. Up one set and with a 5-4
lead, O'Brien served as well as he
has all season. He and partner
Jason Yee won the game at love.
"I was especially pumped to
play doubles. I knew what hap
pened to UCLA (they lost three
straight doubles matches),"
O'Brien said. "I wasn't going to
let that happen to us."
Like his teammates, O'Brien
feels that winning this second
team title is like a dream come
true. "It is such a great feeling.
This tournament is what Coach

I was really pumped to play. I wanted to
jump on top early too, especially after last
night's comeback by Tennessee.'

Gould bases the whole season on,"
O'Brien said. "To come back from
those injuries late in the season
and to keep fighting. . .1 can't ex
plain it. It seriously was a total
team effort."
O'Brien, a 1989 All-American,
has become somewhat of a vet
eran at the NCAAs, even though
he is just a sophomore. Not only
does O'Brien have two team
championships under his belt, but

he was also a doubles semiflnalist
in the individual competition last
year with JefT Tarango.
This year O'Brien, who is
ranked 14th in the country in
singles, will play in both the
singles and doubles competitions.
Despite his top-16 ranking,
however, O'Brien was not seeded
in the top 16. "Politics," he smiles.
In his first-round singles match
today, O'Brien, who has alter

nated between No. 1 and No. 3
singles for the Cardinal, will
square off against Jorge Ortega
of New Mexico.
"There's a lot of people who can
win the singles tournament,"
O'Brien said. "I think I can do it.
I'm just going to take it one match
at a time. To win the tournament
is what every college player
dreams about."
O'Brien and Yee, who won the
Pacific 10 Conference doubles title
together, kick off their tourna
ment against Texas' Steve Bryan
and Hubert Karrasch tomorrow.
O'Brien has tallied an impres
sive 19-4 dual-match singles
record and a 17-3 tournament
record this season.
