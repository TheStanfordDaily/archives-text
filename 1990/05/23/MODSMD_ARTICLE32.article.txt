## Once again reliable O'Brien personifies Card's NCAA play 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. â€” Sophomore
Alex O'Brien always plays best when it
counts most.
In the past two years at the NCAAs,
O'Brien has never lost in dual competition,
winning 10 straight matches in doubles
and singles.
He wins big points more consistently
than any player on the Cardinal team. And
even though he is not the most physically
talented player on the squad, as O'Brien
himself will tell you, he may be the toughest
to beat, especially at the NCAAs.
"He takes his game up another notch at
the NCAAs," Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said.
"I always look for ways to win. I do
anything I can, especially in matches where

I know I need to win," O'Brien said. "When
you know that if you lose you're out, it
makes you try that much harder."
Yesterday, when it counted most, O'Brien
was unstoppable. He decapitated Tennes
see's former No. 1 player, Brice Karsh, 6-1,
6-1.
From the start, O'Brien pounded away
at Karsh, confusing him with moonball
lobs and then powerful ground strokes. But
it was O'Brien's mental attitude that gave
him the most significant edge yesterday.
"I was really pumped to play. I wanted
to jump on top early too, especially after
last night's comeback by Tennessee,"
O'Brien said.
It was only fitting that O'Brien would
serve for the title in the No. 3 doubles
