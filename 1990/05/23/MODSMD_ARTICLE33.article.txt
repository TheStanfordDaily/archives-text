# Pitchers can't overlook Griffin anymore
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Take a trip back to April 23.
It's the bottom of the eighth in
ning at Sunken Diamond, and
Stanislaus State pitcher Hugh

Caram calmly strolls into the
middle of an accident looking for
a place to happen.
With his team down 9-8, Caram
gets the call to come in from the
bullpen. The situation? Bases
loaded. Nobody out. Stanford's

Paul Carey at the plate.
And you wonder why relievers
have breakdowns.
Caram, though, deals with the
situation in probably the best pos
sible way: He gives Carey a free
pass to first. Sure, it drives in a
run, but it keeps the potential
damage to a minimum.
And besides, it gives Caram a
chance to face Tim Griffin. It
beats taking on Stanford's all-time
home run king, right?
Well, maybe it doesn't, as
Caram finds out just a few pitches
later. Griffin sends the ball par
avion to Mountain View, and the
game is over, 14-8.
Caram actually can't be blamed
for pitching around Carey — the
conventional wisdom in 1990 is
that it's better to face just about
anyone besides Mr. Homer. As a
result, Carey has walked an
astronomical 60 times this season.
And no one is enjoying it quite
as much as Griffin, who has been
batting behind Carey ever since
the third week of the year.
"It's fine with me," Griffin says.
"Paul's a patient hitter when he's
going good, so it looks like they're
pitching around him because he's
not one to swing at a lot of bad
pitches. He gets a lot of walks,
which is nice for me.
"Also, they have been pitching
around him still," Griffin says.
"Maybe it's because when you look
at his numbers he's been doing it
for four years, whereas maybe
some people still feel like 'Shoot,
(I've) gotta go down sometime.' I
don't know what they're thinking,
but it's fine with me."
Of course, pitchers could try to
pitch around Carey and Griffin,
but that probably wouldn't work.
"They could try, but it's a little
hard to pitch around me because
I'll swing," Griffin laughs.
That seems like a fairly decent
plan, since Griffin's swings have
brought him 21 home runs so far

this year. Yes, that's 21, the
fourth-highest total in Stanford
history. Yes, that's 21, six more
than Carey has in 1990. And yes,
that's 21, three times as many as
Griffin hit in the last two seasons
combined.
What gives? "I've been asked
that a few times," Griffin says.
"I don't know, really. I changed
my swing a little bit this fall. Our
whole team concept towards hit
ting changed a little bit, using our
lower bodies to get power."
"Changed my swing a little
bit"? Twenty-one dongs from a
"little" change? No one's gonna
buy that.
"Well, the experience I've had
the last couple of years has made
me a better hitter," Griffin says.
"I'm more patient this year, I've
been able to take advantage of
pitches, pitcher's mistakes, stuff
like that.
"Even though I only had four
last year, I had good power," Grif
fin says."I could hit home runs
in b.p. at will, pretty much. Of
course, it's a whole different thing
to do it in a game. This year I've
been able to.
"A big part is that I've become
a better hitter, more disciplined,
waiting for a ball to hit."
Whatever the explanation, Grif
fin has had a season for the ages
in 1990. He's four home runs shy
of Rick Lundblade's single-season
record, and his 54 RBI (on 81
hits) puts him third on the all
time list.
That's not bad, considering that
Griffin, now a senior, didn't even
make the varsity team his first
year here. Instead, he watched
from the stands as the 1987 Car
dinal won the school's first NCAA
title — with classmate Carey play
ing a leading role on the team.

dealt with it rather well. "It was
(hard), but it wasn't," Griffin
says."I didn't deserve (to play).
With my talent level ... I needed
work. It wasn't a matter of me
looking at the lineup and going
'Jeez, I oughta be playing there.'
We had a great team that year,
and I wasn't one of those guys
who could come out of high school
ready to play here.
"I knew I needed a year to learn
everything, to get comfortable
playing, to improve," Griffin says.
"In high school I just used to play,
I was never coached too much. I
never really took it all that
seriously, either. Then I came
here, and all of a sudden they're
teaching you to play baseball,
whereas it always used to be you'd
just go play.
"It's not easy to play when
you're thinking — thinking how
to do things, Griffin says."It
doesn't come naturally; it's hard
to be smooth. That summer I just
got some games under my belt,
and those things that I'd been
taught all year here started to
become a little more natural.
When I came back the next year
I could just play, I didn't have to
worry about thinking."
The way he was playing, Griffin
didn't have to worry about much
of anything: after playing
sparingly in the first few weeks
of 1988, Griffin took over the des
ignated hitter role and went on
to lead the team in hitting at .345.
After the season — and another
Stanford NCAA title — Griffin
was named the team's Most Im

proved Player.
"That was the year I felt I
deserved a shot, and I got it,"
Griffin says."I was in the right
place at the right time. It's tough
being here because there's guys
on the bench who deserve to play,
and they can definitely play, and
then they see the teams we're
playing, and they say 'Shoot, I
could be playing for them.' That's
hard, but at the same time it's
good, because it makes our prac
tices competitive.
"It's tough when you feel like
you should be playing, but I ha
ven't ever really felt that," Griffin
says. "Freshman year, there was
no way. I was iust happy to be
here."
Three seasons later, he's even
happier. And now, as Stanford
begins its drive for a third na
tional championship, Griffin is
standing squarely in the spotlight
instead of watching from the
cheap seats. "It's strange, because
I look back to when I was younger,
and I think about the seniors,"
Griffin says."And I'm seeing
myself... all those guys were old!
I don't see myself as being like
that. I feel pretty much the same.
It's kind of hard to explain."
Griffin isn't old, but his Stan
ford career will be finished some
time in the next few weeks. And,
on June 4, he will most likely be
picked in the major league draft.
"I think about pro ball," he
says."I dream about the majors,
but it might be just a dream. But
I definitely want a chance to play
in the minors, and just see how
much more I can improve. I think
I can still, but I don't know. I'm
definitely gonna try, and have
some more fun."

cheap seats. "It's strange, because
I look back to when I was younger,
and I think about the seniors,"
Griffin says."And I'm seeing
myself... all those guys were old!
I don't see myself as being like
that. I feel pretty much the same.
It's kind of hard to explain."
Griffin isn't old, but his Stan
ford career will be finished some
time in the next few weeks. And,
on June 4, he will most likely be
picked in the major league draft.
"I think about pro ball," he
says."I dream about the majors,
but it might be just a dream. But
I definitely want a chance to play
in the minors, and just see how
much more I can improve. I think
I can still, but I don't know. I'm
definitely gonna try, and have
some more fun."
Take a trip back to April 23.
It's the bottom of the eighth in
ning at Sunken Diamond, and
Stanislaus State pitcher Hugh

Caram calmly strolls into the
middle of an accident looking for
a place to happen.
With his team down 9-8, Caram
gets the call to come in from the
bullpen. The situation? Bases
loaded. Nobody out. Stanford's

Paul Carey at the plate.
And you wonder why relievers
have breakdowns.
Caram, though, deals with the
situation in probably the best pos
sible way: He gives Carey a free
pass to first. Sure, it drives in a
run, but it keeps the potential
damage to a minimum.
And besides, it gives Caram a
chance to face Tim Griffin. It
beats taking on Stanford's all-time
home run king, right?
Well, maybe it doesn't, as
Caram finds out just a few pitches
later. Griffin sends the ball par
avion to Mountain View, and the
game is over, 14-8.
Caram actually can't be blamed
for pitching around Carey — the
conventional wisdom in 1990 is
that it's better to face just about
anyone besides Mr. Homer. As a
result, Carey has walked an
astronomical 60 times this season.
And no one is enjoying it quite
as much as Griffin, who has been
batting behind Carey ever since
the third week of the year.
"It's fine with me," Griffin says.
"Paul's a patient hitter when he's
going good, so it looks like they're
pitching around him because he's
not one to swing at a lot of bad
pitches. He gets a lot of walks,
which is nice for me.
"Also, they have been pitching
around him still," Griffin says.
"Maybe it's because when you look
at his numbers he's been doing it
for four years, whereas maybe
some people still feel like 'Shoot,
(I've) gotta go down sometime.' I
don't know what they're thinking,
but it's fine with me."
Of course, pitchers could try to
pitch around Carey and Griffin,
but that probably wouldn't work.
"They could try, but it's a little
hard to pitch around me because
I'll swing," Griffin laughs.
That seems like a fairly decent
plan, since Griffin's swings have
brought him 21 home runs so far

this year. Yes, that's 21, the
fourth-highest total in Stanford
history. Yes, that's 21, six more
than Carey has in 1990. And yes,
that's 21, three times as many as
Griffin hit in the last two seasons
combined.
What gives? "I've been asked
that a few times," Griffin says.
"I don't know, really. I changed
my swing a little bit this fall. Our
whole team concept towards hit
ting changed a little bit, using our
lower bodies to get power."
"Changed my swing a little
bit"? Twenty-one dongs from a
"little" change? No one's gonna
buy that.
"Well, the experience I've had
the last couple of years has made
me a better hitter," Griffin says.
"I'm more patient this year, I've
been able to take advantage of
pitches, pitcher's mistakes, stuff
like that.
"Even though I only had four
last year, I had good power," Grif
fin says."I could hit home runs
in b.p. at will, pretty much. Of
course, it's a whole different thing
to do it in a game. This year I've
been able to.
"A big part is that I've become
a better hitter, more disciplined,
waiting for a ball to hit."
Whatever the explanation, Grif
fin has had a season for the ages
in 1990. He's four home runs shy
of Rick Lundblade's single-season
record, and his 54 RBI (on 81
hits) puts him third on the all
time list.
That's not bad, considering that
Griffin, now a senior, didn't even
make the varsity team his first
year here. Instead, he watched
from the stands as the 1987 Car
dinal won the school's first NCAA
title — with classmate Carey play
ing a leading role on the team.
Not getting a chance to play
was difficult at times, but Griffin

dealt with it rather well. "It was
(hard), but it wasn't," Griffin
says."I didn't deserve (to play).
With my talent level ... I needed
work. It wasn't a matter of me
looking at the lineup and going
'Jeez, I oughta be playing there.'
We had a great team that year,
and I wasn't one of those guys
who could come out of high school
ready to play here.
"I knew I needed a year to learn
everything, to get comfortable
playing, to improve," Griffin says.
"In high school I just used to play,
I was never coached too much. I
never really took it all that
seriously, either. Then I came
here, and all of a sudden they're
teaching you to play baseball,
whereas it always used to be you'd
just go play.
"It's not easy to play when
you're thinking — thinking how
to do things, Griffin says."It
doesn't come naturally; it's hard
to be smooth. That summer I just
got some games under my belt,
and those things that I'd been
taught all year here started to
become a little more natural.
When I came back the next year
I could just play, I didn't have to
worry about thinking."
The way he was playing, Griffin
didn't have to worry about much
of anything: after playing
sparingly in the first few weeks
of 1988, Griffin took over the des
ignated hitter role and went on
to lead the team in hitting at .345.
After the season — and another
Stanford NCAA title — Griffin
was named the team's Most Im

proved Player.
"That was the year I felt I
deserved a shot, and I got it,"
Griffin says."I was in the right
place at the right time. It's tough
being here because there's guys
on the bench who deserve to play,
and they can definitely play, and
then they see the teams we're
playing, and they say 'Shoot, I
could be playing for them.' That's
hard, but at the same time it's
good, because it makes our prac
tices competitive.
"It's tough when you feel like
you should be playing, but I ha
ven't ever really felt that," Griffin
says. "Freshman year, there was
no way. I was iust happy to be
here."
Three seasons later, he's even
happier. And now, as Stanford
begins its drive for a third na
tional championship, Griffin is
standing squarely in the spotlight
instead of watching from the
cheap seats. "It's strange, because
I look back to when I was younger,

Griffin says."And I'm seeing
