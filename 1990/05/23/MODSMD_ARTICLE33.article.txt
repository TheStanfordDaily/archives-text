# Pitchers can't overlook Griffin anymore
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Take a trip back to April 23.
It's the bottom of the eighth in
ning at Sunken Diamond, and
Stanislaus State pitcher Hugh

Caram calmly strolls into the
middle of an accident looking for
a place to happen.
With his team down 9-8, Caram
gets the call to come in from the
bullpen. The situation? Bases
loaded. Nobody out. Stanford's

Paul Carey at the plate.
And you wonder why relievers
have breakdowns.
Caram, though, deals with the
situation in probably the best pos
sible way: He gives Carey a free
pass to first. Sure, it drives in a
run, but it keeps the potential
damage to a minimum.
And besides, it gives Caram a
chance to face Tim Griffin. It
beats taking on Stanford's all-time
home run king, right?
Well, maybe it doesn't, as
Caram finds out just a few pitches
later. Griffin sends the ball par
avion to Mountain View, and the
game is over, 14-8.
Caram actually can't be blamed
for pitching around Carey — the
conventional wisdom in 1990 is
that it's better to face just about
anyone besides Mr. Homer. As a
result, Carey has walked an
astronomical 60 times this season.
And no one is enjoying it quite
as much as Griffin, who has been
batting behind Carey ever since
the third week of the year.
"It's fine with me," Griffin says.
"Paul's a patient hitter when he's
going good, so it looks like they're
pitching around him because he's
not one to swing at a lot of bad
pitches. He gets a lot of walks,
which is nice for me.
"Also, they have been pitching
around him still," Griffin says.
"Maybe it's because when you look
at his numbers he's been doing it
for four years, whereas maybe
some people still feel like 'Shoot,
(I've) gotta go down sometime.' I
don't know what they're thinking,
but it's fine with me."
Of course, pitchers could try to
pitch around Carey and Griffin,
but that probably wouldn't work.
"They could try, but it's a little
hard to pitch around me because
I'll swing," Griffin laughs.
That seems like a fairly decent
plan, since Griffin's swings have
brought him 21 home runs so far

this year. Yes, that's 21, the
fourth-highest total in Stanford
history. Yes, that's 21, six more
than Carey has in 1990. And yes,
that's 21, three times as many as
Griffin hit in the last two seasons
combined.
What gives? "I've been asked
that a few times," Griffin says.
"I don't know, really. I changed
my swing a little bit this fall. Our
whole team concept towards hit
ting changed a little bit, using our
lower bodies to get power."
"Changed my swing a little
bit"? Twenty-one dongs from a
"little" change? No one's gonna
buy that.
"Well, the experience I've had
the last couple of years has made
me a better hitter," Griffin says.
"I'm more patient this year, I've
been able to take advantage of
pitches, pitcher's mistakes, stuff
like that.
"Even though I only had four
last year, I had good power," Grif
fin says."I could hit home runs
in b.p. at will, pretty much. Of
course, it's a whole different thing
to do it in a game. This year I've
been able to.
"A big part is that I've become
a better hitter, more disciplined,
waiting for a ball to hit."
Whatever the explanation, Grif
fin has had a season for the ages
in 1990. He's four home runs shy
of Rick Lundblade's single-season
record, and his 54 RBI (on 81
hits) puts him third on the all
time list.
That's not bad, considering that
Griffin, now a senior, didn't even
make the varsity team his first
year here. Instead, he watched
from the stands as the 1987 Car
dinal won the school's first NCAA
title — with classmate Carey play
ing a leading role on the team.
Not getting a chance to play
was difficult at times, but Griffin


With 21 homo runs and 54 RBI tho Cardinal's Tim Griffin has
established himself as a threat In the batter's box this season.
