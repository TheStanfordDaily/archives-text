Fast forward the video cas
sette of your life a few
years. You're sitting in a
chaise lounge by the pool sip
ping a cool drink. The radio is
playing in the background,
though you're not paying it
much attention.
Suddenly, something stands
out amid the idle chatter
emanating from the boom box.
"This just in from Barcelona,
Spain. American Janel Jorgen
sen has just won the gold medal
in the 100-meter butterfly"
"Honey, you're not going to
believe this," you shout to your
spouse who is doing the dishes.
"What, dear?"
"The woman who lived next
door to me my freshman year
at Stanford just won an Olym
pic gold medal."
"That's nice, dear."
Somehow the news fills you
with an inexplicable dollop of
glee. Your spouse's disinterest
can't wipe the smile from your
face.
"How about that. Good ol'
Janel. I knew her when she
couldn't get a date for the
Branner formal."
Ever since that thick en
velope arrived from Dean Jean,
you've been told about all the
incredible people you'll meet at
Stanford. About how they'll be
the future leaders of America.
About how you'll be able to
gay, "I knew them when ..

The young upstart re
moves her visor to wipe
the perspiration from
her brow. It's 90-plus degrees
in Flushing Meadow today and
the humidity is unbearable.

New York is always a
miserable place to be around
Labor Day. Still, there's not a
single empty seat in Louis
Armstrong Stadium. It's the
quarterfinals of the U.S. Open
and the crowd has begun to
cheer for the underdog.
Across the net is Monica
Seles, the No. 2 seed. She's al
ready fought off two match
points and is about to face an
other. The upstart already has
a half-dozen aces on the day
and could reach the semis if
she can serve up one more.
The ballboy bounces one ball
to the server, then another. She
tosses, rocks and smashes a
bullet straight up the middle.
Seles lunges but can barely put
a racket on it. The upset it
complete.
In the television booth atop
the stadium, Mary Carillo tells
a national audience: "If there
was any doubt before today,
consider it erased. Debbie
Graham is one of the bright
young stars in professional ten
nis."
Debbie Graham. I knew her
when she played No. 4 singles
for the Cardinal.

Fourteen seconds left on the
clock in Game 7 of the East
em Conference finals. In
diana trails Chicago by one point
and has just called a timeout.
The Bulls have completely frus
trated the Pacers inside game all
day. Were it not for red-hot shoot
ing by Reggie Miller, the game
would have long since been
decided.
On the sidelines, Indiana
diagrams the game's final play. A
basket and they advance to the
NBA's championship series. A
miss and they head home for an
other summer thinking about
what might have been.
"Vera, walk it around for ten,
then get it to Reggie in the cor
ner," Pacers Coach Dick Versace
tells Vern Fleming, the point
guard.

"Reggie. I assume you know
what to do with it."
He nods.
Both teams return to the court.
Indiana inbounds to Fleming who
steps up to the three-point arc.
The Bulls' B.J. Armstrong puts
little pressure on Fleming so he
just stands there dribbling.
The clock counts down. Eight.
Seven. Six. Armstong bounces the
ball down to Miller.
Miller squares his shoulders,
eyes the basket and gets ready to
shoot. Suddenly, Michael Jordan
flies out of nowhere and extends
his wing to block the shot.
Out of the corner of his eye,
Miller spots the redheaded rookie
posting down low. Quinn Buckner
calls the action:
"Miller shoots. Noooooo! He
fires the ball to Adam Keefe,
Keefe sneaks past Stacey King
and dunks it home. The Pacers
are going to The Finals!"
Adam Keefe. I knew him when
he was Eric Reveno's backup.
