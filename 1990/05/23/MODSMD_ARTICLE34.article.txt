Fast forward the video cas
sette of your life a few
years. You're sitting in a
chaise lounge by the pool sip
ping a cool drink. The radio is
playing in the background,
though you're not paying it
much attention.
Suddenly, something stands
out amid the idle chatter
emanating from the boom box.
"This just in from Barcelona,
Spain. American Janel Jorgen
sen has just won the gold medal
in the 100-meter butterfly"
"Honey, you're not going to
believe this," you shout to your
spouse who is doing the dishes.
"What, dear?"
"The woman who lived next
door to me my freshman year
at Stanford just won an Olym
pic gold medal."
"That's nice, dear."
Somehow the news fills you
with an inexplicable dollop of
glee. Your spouse's disinterest
can't wipe the smile from your
face.
"How about that. Good ol'
Janel. I knew her when she
couldn't get a date for the
Branner formal."
Ever since that thick en

Armstrong Stadium. It's the
quarterfinals of the U.S. Open
and the crowd has begun to
cheer for the underdog.
Across the net is Monica
Seles, the No. 2 seed. She's al
ready fought off two match
points and is about to face an
other. The upstart already has
a half-dozen aces on the day
and could reach the semis if
she can serve up one more.
The ballboy bounces one ball
to the server, then another. She
tosses, rocks and smashes a
bullet straight up the middle.
Seles lunges but can barely put
a racket on it. The upset it
complete.
In the television booth atop
the stadium, Mary Carillo tells
a national audience: "If there
was any doubt before today,
consider it erased. Debbie
Graham is one of the bright
young stars in professional ten
nis."
Debbie Graham. I knew her
when she played No. 4 singles
for the Cardinal.
