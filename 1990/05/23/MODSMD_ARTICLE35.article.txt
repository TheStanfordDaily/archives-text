# Golfers kick off NCAA drive
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
It all comes down to today. Or
make that today, tomorrow, Fri
day and Saturday.
All the hours of practice, all the
balls hit and all the rounds played
this year have led the women's
golf team to Hilton Head, South
Carolina for the four most impor
tant days of the season — the
NCAA tournament.
As sophomore Stephanie Davis
said, "We need to come together
for just four more days."
And what a four days it prom
ises to be. The Cardinal will not
only be facing the top teams in
the nation, but the team will also
be facing the incredibly difficult
Arthur Hills Golf Course — a
course that the team has never
seen before.
Coach Tim Baldwin has seen
the course before, and he knows
his team is in for a challenge and
some excitement. "It is a tremen
dous course and will probably be
the most difficult one we've
played on all year. There are a
lot of water [hazards] and all sorts
of things in the water like
crocodiles, snakes. .
Crocodiles! Snakes! Yep, you
read right. As Baldwin explained,
"The course is in a big swamp

'We certainly aren't
the favorites, but I
wouldn't put it past us
to win the whole
thing.

and is practically like a wildlife
refuge." Sounds like an interest
ing place to play golf.
But don't fear for the safety of
the team. Since the Cardinal ar
rived in South Carolina last Sat
urday, the team should have had
plenty of time to get to know the
course and its local inhabitants.
And if Stanford keeps playing
like they have been all spring long,
then the other teams in the 17-
team field will most likely become
well acquainted with the names
of the golfers who will be playing
for the Cardinal. After all, in the
last three tournaments, the team
has been on fire, shooting season
low rounds in each of the tour
naments. In fact, in the team's
last outing al the California In
tercollegiate, the Cardinal came
within a controversial rules in
fraction of tying the No. 2 ranked
and defending national champion
San Jose State team.

Needless to say, Stanford is full
of confidence going into this tour
nament. Said Davis, "I have a
really good feeling about this tour
nament. We certainly aren't the
favorites, but I wouldn't put it
past us to win the whole thing.
We've proven that we can do it."
Teammate Jodi Figley, who had
a terrific last tournament to close
out the year, echoed the same
thoughts. "I feel great and am
really excited. We're all just ready
to go out there and do it. After
these last tournaments, we all
know we can beat everyone, so
now we just have to do it."
But if the Cardinal is to come
away with the national champi
onship, the team will have to get
by some fairly formidable opposi
tion, chiefly No. 1 ranked and
Pacific-10 conference foe, Arizona
State. In addition to San Jose
State, the other favorites are Ar
izona, Tulsa and Oklahoma State.
ASU's freshman sensation Brandi
Burton is a heavy favorite to win
the individual title, although last
year's champion, Pat Hurst of San
Jose State, is also in the field.
But don't count out the cur
rently ninth-ranked Stanford
squad. As Baldwin said, "I'm
looking forward to great things.
For us to win it, everything would
have to work just right, and each

player would have to play her best
rounds of the year."
Last year on the Stanford Golf
Course, the Cardinal finished a
disappointing 10th, and this year
the team will undoubtedly be
looking to improve on that plac

ing. The best a team has done in
Baldwin's 11 years as coach is
sixth place.
However, Baldwin feels this
may be the year for his team to
break out. "This team is the best
I've ever had here. There have

been other potentially great
teams, but this is the best playing
team I've ever had. We can play
with everyone in the tourna
ment." And that includes the
friendly dwellers on the course
who will be watching it all.
