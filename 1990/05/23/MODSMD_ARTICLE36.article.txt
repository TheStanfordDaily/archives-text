# Star-crossed Cardinal cyclists take fifth
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Bad luck abounded for the
Stanford cyclists at last weekend's
Collegiate Cycling Champion
ships.
Seconds into the meet's very
first event, the women's road race,
a collision removed two of Stan
ford's foremost cyclists, Amy
Dawson and Michele Sullivan,
from contention.
Later, in the team time trial,
an ambiguity in the scoring sys
tem that was not clarified until

after the race had actually started
dropped the Cardinal women from
second to third in the event.
In Sunday's criterium, which
awards points to its top 18 fin
ishers, the top Cardinal women
took 19th and 20th.
"All I can say is, it's extremely
frustrating," cyclist Erica Deese-
Dobson said of their run of bad
luck. "It seems as if we just miss
doing really well in each race."
The Cardinal's bad fortunes
placed them in eighth place going
into the last race, the men's cri
terium. Just one lap into the sixty-

lap, contest, cyclist Scott Evans
had to stop for bike repairs. Pros
pects for a strong final placing
were looking bleak indeed.
However, anyone who planned
on a poor Cardinal showing forgot
to tell Coulter Richardson and
Frank Scioscia, whose heroics pro
pelled Stanford to victory in the
men's criterium. They combined
for an astounding 126 points in
the event, pushing Stanford's six
race total to 284. Despite the fact
that the Cardinal's fifth-place
finish was far behind the Univer
sity of Colorado's winning total of

715, officials and team members
alike considered the race a success
for the cycling team.
"This event represents a big
step for the cycling program
here," Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference Director Tim Nichol
son said. "Although they didn't
place as well as they did last year,
the fact that they were able to
host such a successful event says
a lot about the Stanford team."
Senior women's captain and
race co-director Laura Wilson
agrees. "The race went extremely
smoothly," Wilson said, "And we
have a lot of team members and
volunteers to thank for that.
They've spent a lot of time putting
this race together."
The volunteers' long hours of
labor allowed hundreds of cyclists
from over 60 schools to participate
in the race. Standing out from
the rest of the field were Julie
Furtado of Colorado and Jacob
Hacker of Berkeley, the individual
champions.
Hacker's heroics propelled the
Golden Bears to a repeat perfor
mace of last year's second-place
finish. Scioscia, who finished in
a tie for 9th place in the overall
individual competition, and Rich
ardson, who finished 12th, paced
the Cardinal.
"I was pleased with my per
formance on Sunday," Scioscia
said. "I wasn't riding that well at
first, but the home crowd gave
me a lot of help.
Disappointing as the results
may have been for the Cardinal
riders, only four schools in the
nation — Colorado, Cal, the Uni
versity of Arizona, and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo — can boast
cycling teams superior to Stan
ford's. However, the lofty goals
set for the Cardinal bikers left
nobody content with the race's
outcome.
