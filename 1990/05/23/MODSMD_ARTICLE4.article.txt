## Officials confirm Soviet president will speak during June 4 visit 
### Janine De Fao Editorial staff 
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
will deliver a public address during his
June 4 visit to Stanford, Soviet officials
confirmed yesterday.
The announcement, by Aleksandr
Poptemkin, minister of cultural affairs
at the Soviet embassy in Washington,
D.C., followed a week's worth of specula
tion and rumors as to whether or not
the Soviet president would speak.
The time and location of the speech
have yet to be determined, said Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen.
The University has proposed
Memorial Auditorium, Maples Pavilion,
Frost Ampitheater and Stanford Sta

dium as four possible locations for the
speech, Freelen said.
Memorial Auditorium is the Soviets'
current preference, he added.
The availability of tickets has not yet
been determined, but Freelen said some
type of lottery will probably take place.
Preference will be given to students,
faculty and staff before members of the
outside community. The demand for at
tendance of University guests, such as
trustees, will also have to be met. In
addition, the size of Gorbachev's trav
eling contingent, which is yet unknown,
must also be considered.
"It's wonderful," University President
Donald Kennedy said of the announce
ment. "We certainly hope it's correct —
and that's the word we heard from the
folks at the Soviet embassy."

However, Kennedy added a note of
caution. "These arrangements are shift
ing bj their very nature. Although we're
thrilled, we don't want to get anyone's
hopes up," he said.
"But that's the plan as it stands now,"
he added.
The rest of Gorbachev's agenda is still
undecided.
Former Soviet Ambassador Yuri
Dubinin confirmed last week that Gor
bachev would be on campus from ap
proximately 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Soviet
Embassy asked the University for a pro
posed agenda, which was submitted
along with a campus map.
The University suggested a speech, a
working luncheon with academic
authorities in a number of fields
and, time permitting, a visit to
the Soviet archives at the Hoover
Institution.
Many people, at Stanford and
nationally, have speculated that
visiting the archives is one of the
key reasons Gorbachev chose to
come to Stanford.
Freelen said he is sure Gorba
chev will visit Hoover, which is
mounting an exhibit of some
items from the archives.
A luncheon will probably not
be held, due to time constraints,
Freelen said.
He said the University has also
recommended a small meeting be

tween Gorbachev and certain fac
ulty and students. The University
does not yet know if it will occur
or who will be invited. People's
interests and expertise would be
considered, he added.
The University is expecting an
advance team of Soviet and Amer
ican officials to arrive for a
"walkaround" of campus facili
ties. Freelen said he heard from
one source the team could arrive
tomorrow morning, but there has
been no official statement.
Freelen said the team will be
shown all four of the sites sug
gested for the speech.
Another rumor, that Gorbachev
may stay an additional day in the
area to learn about the Loma
Prieta earthquake, also remains
unconfirmed.
