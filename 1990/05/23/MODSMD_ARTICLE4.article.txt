Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
will deliver a public address during his
June 4 visit to Stanford, Soviet officials
confirmed yesterday.
The announcement, by Aleksandr
Poptemkin, minister of cultural affairs
at the Soviet embassy in Washington,
D.C., followed a week's worth of specula
tion and rumors as to whether or not
the Soviet president would speak.
The time and location of the speech
have yet to be determined, said Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen.
The University has proposed
Memorial Auditorium, Maples Pavilion,
Frost Ampitheater and Stanford Sta

dium as four possible locations for the
speech, Freelen said.
Memorial Auditorium is the Soviets'
current preference, he added.
The availability of tickets has not yet
been determined, but Freelen said some
type of lottery will probably take place.
Preference will be given to students,
faculty and staff before members of the
outside community. The demand for at
tendance of University guests, such as
trustees, will also have to be met. In
addition, the size of Gorbachev's trav
eling contingent, which is yet unknown,
must also be considered.
"It's wonderful," University President
Donald Kennedy said of the announce
ment. "We certainly hope it's correct â€”
and that's the word we heard from the
folks at the Soviet embassy."

However, Kennedy added a note of
caution. "These arrangements are shift
ing bj their very nature. Although we're
thrilled, we don't want to get anyone's
hopes up," he said.
"But that's the plan as it stands now,"
he added.
The rest of Gorbachev's agenda is still
undecided.
Former Soviet Ambassador Yuri
Dubinin confirmed last week that Gor
bachev would be on campus from ap
proximately 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Soviet
Embassy asked the University for a pro
posed agenda, which was submitted
along with a campus map.
The University suggested a speech, a
