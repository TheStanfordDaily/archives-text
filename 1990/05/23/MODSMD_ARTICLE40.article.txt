# Campbell's challengers square off
## Democrats seeking to capture 12th District outline their views 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Democratic candidates Gary
Bond and Robert Palmer face a
marathon race to defeat heavily
favored incumbent Representative
Tom Campbell in November.
And in a debate presented by
the Stanford Democrats last night
at Tresidder Union, Palmer
showed no hurry to reach the
starting line, arriving an hour late
for the scheduled 7 p.m. event.
Bond and Palmer are Demo
crats running for the 12th U.S.
Congressional seat currently held
by Stanford Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell, a moderate Republican.
A June 5 primary election will
give Democrats a chance to select
either Bond or Palmer. The win
ner will face Campbell in the fall
in a district that has historically
been represented by Republicans.
The 12th District includes Stan
ford, Palo Alto, Los Altos and
Mountain View and is 44 percent
Democrat and 42 percent Repub
lican.
Campbell defeated Republican
incumbent Ernie Konnyu and
Democratic challenger Anna Es
hoo to capture the seat in 1988
and is running for his second
term.
Libertarian Chuck Olson will

also be on the November ballot.
An audience that started with
three students and eventually
swelled to 10 questioned Bond on
the issue of federal student aid as
he awaited Palmer's arrival.
Bond proposed that education
grants should be increased in spe
cialized fields which concern the
public good, such as education and
general medicine.
Palmer, who cited an "un
tenable situation" for his late ar
rival, attacked the Republican
Party's "campaign against indi
vidual rights" before the 15-
minute debate ended.
Bond, a 42-year-old business
consultant from Mountain View,
is considered the favorite to win
the primary. He received 6 percent
of the vote in the 1988 primary
while losing to Eshoo and has re
ceived the endorsement of the
state Democratic party in his race
against Palmer.
"I'm expecting to be the nom
inee and I'm expecting to give
Campbell a very hard time," Bond
said. "He's very anti-people, anti
social programs and anti
environment."
But Bond admitted to his
longshot status. "This year I'll
need a pretty major break. It
would be wonderful if he
(Campbell) had done something

terrible — and it was true — and
we found out about it."
"But he has such a clean-cut
image it would be very difficult,"
Bond added.
Palmer is is a 66-year-old en
gineer from Los Altos who is chal
lenging Campbell as a "Bush
apologist." He has lived in the
12 th District since 1964 when he
came to Stanford as a National
Science Foundation faculty fellow.
"It serves no public purpose to
re-elect an incumbent who fails
to oppose misconduct in govern
ment," Palmer said in a campaign
release. "I can match Campbell's
academic attainments and exceed
his life experience, and anybody
who'd speak in favor of Robert
Bork for the Supreme Court is
not my kind of guy."
Bond said he would focus on
environmental issues in his cam
paign and would not accept cam
paign contributions from Political
Action Committees.
He said he would target 40,000
unaffiliated voters to defeat
Campbell. "I'll get 40 percent just
by showing up," he said.
Stanford Democrats co-chair
Scott Christofferson said he was
"surprised" by Palmer's late arri
val and he "would have liked to
see more people at the event."
