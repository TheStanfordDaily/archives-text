## Senate sets COP recall for Dead Week 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night voted to
hold a recall election of Council of Presi
dents slate-elect "Four Our Future." It
also extended its support to Gordon
Chang, who has been offered a tenure
track professorship at Stanford. Last
week, a poster was distributed on
campus accusing Chang of being a
leader in the League of Revolutionary
Struggle, a secretive Marxist-Leninist
organization.
During debate on the recall election
bill, the senate only discussed the dates
and times of the recall election. Because
law students will leave campus this Fri
day, the senate voted to open polls at
the Law School today through Friday.
Elections for the rest of campus will be
held June 4 and 5.
The election will ask voters whether

they "wish to have the current COP
elect 'Four Our Future' . . . removed
from office?"
The recall election comes in response
to a petition organized by Students
United for a Fair Election; it was signed
by 2,030 students, exceeding the 1,998
signatures — 15 percent of the student
body — needed to mandate the election.
Although they have no power to stop
the recall election, some senators ex
pressed dismay that it will be held.
Graduate senator Colin Hampson
characterized the election as "stupid"
because "the COP has not even officially
taken office. They haven't had the op
portunity to fall into the disfavor of the
student body," he said in an interview
after the meeting.
However, SUFE organizer Perry
Friedman, a graduate student, said in
an interview he believes "it's not
whether or not they're ('For Our Fu

ture') going to be good. The real issue
is whether or not they were elected
fairly. They can run again in a new
election. . . . The students should have
a chance to voice their opinion."
The senate also considered a bill to
extend its support to Chang, a UC-
Irvine professor, who has been offered
a tenure-track position in Asian-
American studies.
The bill is a response to the anony
mous poster distributed on campus last
week as well as the subsequent Daily
coverage of the poster. The bill said two
articles in Friday's Daily, one on the
poster and another giving background
information on the League, "legimated"
the poster.
The bill passed in a 10 to two hand
vote with one abstention.
