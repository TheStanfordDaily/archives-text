## Senate sets COP recall for Dead Week 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night voted to
hold a recall election of Council of Presi
dents slate-elect "Four Our Future." It
also extended its support to Gordon
Chang, who has been offered a tenure
track professorship at Stanford. Last
week, a poster was distributed on
campus accusing Chang of being a
leader in the League of Revolutionary
Struggle, a secretive Marxist-Leninist
organization.
During debate on the recall election
bill, the senate only discussed the dates
and times of the recall election. Because
law students will leave campus this Fri
day, the senate voted to open polls at
the Law School today through Friday.
Elections for the rest of campus will be
held June 4 and 5.
The election will ask voters whether

they "wish to have the current COP
elect 'Four Our Future' . . . removed
from office?"
The recall election comes in response
to a petition organized by Students
United for a Fair Election; it was signed
by 2,030 students, exceeding the 1,998
signatures — 15 percent of the student
body — needed to mandate the election.
Although they have no power to stop
the recall election, some senators ex
pressed dismay that it will be held.
Graduate senator Colin Hampson
characterized the election as "stupid"
because "the COP has not even officially
taken office. They haven't had the op
portunity to fall into the disfavor of the
student body," he said in an interview
after the meeting.
However, SUFE organizer Perry
Friedman, a graduate student, said in
an interview he believes "it's not
whether or not they're ('For Our Fu

ture') going to be good. The real issue
is whether or not they were elected
fairly. They can run again in a new
election. . . . The students should have
a chance to voice their opinion."
The senate also considered a bill to
extend its support to Chang, a UC-
Irvine professor, who has been offered
a tenure-track position in Asian-
American studies.
The bill is a response to the anony
mous poster distributed on campus last
week as well as the subsequent Daily
coverage of the poster. The bill said two
articles in Friday's Daily, one on the
poster and another giving background
information on the League, "legimated"
the poster.
The bill passed in a 10 to two hand
vote with one abstention.
Senate discussion on the Chang bill
revolved around The Daily's cov
erage. Sophmore Vince Ricci said,
"Reading those two articles on
Friday I was ready to transfer.. ..
I have lost all faith in The Dai
ly. ... It's basically an attack on
the changes that have happened
over the last 20 years. . . . That
was not journalism."
Graduate senator Jay Bhattac
harya, who voted against the bill,
said "I don't understand that The
Daily legitimated the flyer by
printing it. .. . The slant in the
Daily article — on the flyer —
was negative."
Bhattacharya later said he did

not vote for the bill because the
clause saying The Daily
"legitimated" the poster does not
"support the freedom of the
press."
The senate also passed one res
olution and three Bylaws changes
— two intended to mandate free
dom of information and two to
mandate openess within the sen
ate.
The first freedom of informa
tion bill — "a catch-all," according
to graduate senator Douglas Bone,
the author of the bill — requires
that the "ASSU provide full access
to its records" with the exception
of certain non-ASSU-funded ac
counts and confidential records
concerning ASSU Legal

Counseling.
The second freedom of infor
mation bill passed on a hand vote,
10 to one with one abstention. It
opens all ASSU records to public
inspection with the stipulation
that the treasurer of a student
group be informed of an inspec
tion of the group's financial
records and the person or group
who has requested it.
The first openness bill, which
passed on a divided voice vote,
requires that all senate meetings
be open to the public.
The second openness bill, which
