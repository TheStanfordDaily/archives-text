# What's in a name?
## Professor-authored textbooks can mean profits, pitfalls 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
When students enrolled in Psy
chology 1 cram for today's mid
term, they will pore over
"Psychology and Life," a textbook
written by Philip Zimbardo. A few
times each week, they view a tele
vision show produced and hosted
by Philip Zimbardo. And when
students attend lecture each Wed
nesday, they are instructed and
sometimes entertained by — you
guessed it — Philip Zimbardo.
"The class is completely Zim
bardo," says Eric Cope, a fresh
man currently enrolled in
Psychology 1. Cope says that the
combination of a Zimbardo
textbook and a Zimbardo lecture
series makes the class more inte
grated.
Zimbardo is one of many pro
fessors at Stanford who have writ
ten textbooks that are required
reading — and sometimes the
only reading — for their classes.
While professors who write their
own textbooks say they reap
rewards in the classroom and in
the checkbook, they admit
textbook authorship has its dan
gers.
Professors who assign their

own texts say their classroom
teaching is enhanced. Satisfied
that their texts provide a basic
introduction to the subject, they
can branch out into in-depth ex
ploration of the latest research or
current topics.
Zimbaro says using "Psychology
and Life" in his classes liberates
him. "Since I can count on and
trust the information in the text,
I can use class time to go beyond
it. That's what makes teaching
fun."
Similarly, Human Biology Prof.
Herant Katchadourian, who
teaches "Human Sexuality," says
that by assigning his own book
he can expand the scope of his
class during lectures through
slides, panels and guest lecturers.
"I find that (the textbook)
facilitates my teaching the
course," said Katchadourian.
"The lecture doesn't have to carry
the primary burden of conveying
information."
When Katchadourian first
wrote his "Fundamentals of
Human Sexuality" in 1970, no
textbooks existed in the field. Now
in its fifth edition, the text re
mains a staple for his course —
the only required reading for the
hundreds of students enrolled

each winter.
The field of human sexuality
attracts many authors with dif
ferent slants and biases, and by
using his own book, Katchadour
ian says,"I don't have to argue
with the author."
Outside of the classroom,
textbooks can fill professors' cof
fers — or just their resumes.
For large introductory courses
such as Psychology 1 or "Human
Sexuality," professors can make a
sizable profit from royalties on
commercial textbooks.
Most commercial textbook au
thors get a royalty of 15 percent
of the wholesale price of the book.
"It's one of the few ways an
academician can supplement his
or her income," he says. The other
is consulting, which, Zimbardo
points out, can often take profes
sors away from campus.
However, textbooks in less
popular or more esoteric fields are
far less lucrative.
Communication Prof. Jeremy
Cohen said he makes "zero
money" on "Congress Shall Make
No Law," a book about the First
Amendment that he uses in his
class "Communication Media and
