Synthetic organic chemicals have sprung up as pervasive
environmental contaminants within the last generation, in
our water, land and air. Where do these contaminants come
from? In what quantity? What are their potential environmental
and health impacts? What can we do about them, as a society,
as a university enterprise, and as individuals? This talk will
provide a long-term perspective on these questions, from both the
technological and socio-economic standpoints.
