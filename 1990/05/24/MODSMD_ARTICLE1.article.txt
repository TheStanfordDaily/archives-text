# Hoover aglow over Gorbachev's visit

John Raisian could hardly be
happier. Less than 48 hours after
being appointed permanent direc
tor of the Hoover Institution,
Raisian learned he would host So
viet President Mikhail Gorbachev
on his June 4 visit.
This is the ultimate compliment
for the conservative think tank
that often takes a heavy beating
for the views of its scholars. Gov
ernment officials have reported
that Gorbachev's interest in Hoo
ver's scholarship helped lure him
to campus, doing wonders for the
think tank's reputation.
Although Hoover is hardly a
Cinderella being discovered, it will
certainly benefit from extensive
media coverage. Because Gorba
chev's visit to Stanford and Hoo
ver was announced last week,
virtually every mayor paper in the
country has given a great deal of
coverage to Hoover's archives and
scholars.
Richard Burress, associate di
rector of the institution, expects
Gorbachev's visit to "underline
the wealth of scholarly talent that
we have at the Hoover Institu
tion," noting that Gorbachev is
"the number one celebrity in the
world today."
Most press coverage has cen
tered on Hoover's archival collec
tions. Those collections, which
occupy 25 miles of shelving, are
world-renowned as a source of his
torical information.
According to Raisian, the insti

tution is busy preparing "a first
class" exhibit of some of the
treasures from Hoover's library
and archives for Gorbachev. Hoo
ver has an extensive Russian and
Eastern European collection con
taining "hundreds of thousands"
of documents, according to
Charles Palm, head of Hoover's
library and archives.
Those documents include a copy
of the first issue of Pravda, dozens
of letters written by Lenin and
Trotsky, archives of the czarist
government and a copy of the first
edition of the Communist
Manifesto.
Palm expects Gorbachev's visit
to "give a lot of visibility to the
collection," and increase "ap
preciation for the work the Hoo
ver Institution has done ... in
documenting the history of the
20th century, with particular em
phasis on Russia and the Soviet
Union."
Palm said Hoover also is pre
paring "a rnggor exhibit of Russian
materials for the general public"
to coincide with Gorbachev's visit.
Gorbachev's interest in the
think tank dates back several
years. On two separate occasions
he cited a book on the Soviet econ
omy to American diplomats. That
book, "The United States in the
1980'5," was written by Hoover
scholars.
Several Hoover fellows are dis
tinguished Soviet experts, "who
for some time have been writing
and publishing books that were
discounted many places .. . and
have now been given real
credence," according to Burress.
Soviet human rights activist
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has done
extensive research at the Hoover
archives and held one of his first
American press conferences at
Hoover Tower.
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev,
retired chief of Soviet armed
forces, viewed Hoover's materials
from the Russian Revolution of
1917 when he visited Hoover last
year. Akhromeyev reportedly said
Hoover had the best collection of
materials from the Russian Revo
lution that existed outside of the
Soviet Union.
