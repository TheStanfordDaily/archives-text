# Bail boosted to contain 'the Stalker'
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
It looks like "the Stalker" won't be stalking much
anymore. Tuesday afternoon Judge Hayden of the
Palo Alto Municipal Court raised the bail from
$20,000 to $50,000 for Mark Stillman, whom police
knew as "the Stalker."
Stillman was originally arrested on charges of
assault with a deadly weapon for driving his Honda
Accord into the path of an oncoming vehicle. He
reportedly said he did so to "see how it felt to make
someone think they are going to die."
The charges against Stillman have been modified
to reckless driving, and he is currently incarcerated
at Main Jail in San Jose. The bail increase was
intended to keep him there. According to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, "We don't want him
out."

Police would like to hear from the intended victim,
who was driving a "mid-sized American car," but
they were unable to record the car's license plate,
and they have no way of tracing the car or the
intended victim.
All parties involved with the case agreed to
postpone Stillman's arraignment until May 31.
Niemeyer said Stillman's attorney aims at a "long
term conservatorship" for his client rather than an
extended jail sentence. A conservatorship would
mean a long-term mental evaluation, and Niemeyer
said "he would probably be hospitalized for a long
time." Before the arraignment Stillman will undergo
a mental evaluation.
Stillman is known as "the Stalker" because of
his harassment of a woman staff member at Stan
ford. But Niemeyer said Stillman can not be charged
for the harassment, because he has not broken any
laws.
