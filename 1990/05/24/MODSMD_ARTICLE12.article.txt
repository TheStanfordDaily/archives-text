# Hayward elected to head Daily
## 
### Edwina Inchief Staff writer 
The new editor is . . . Bart
Simpson. Just kidding.
Brad Hayward, current
managing editor and a sopho
more majoring in political
science, will be editor in chief
of Volume 198 of The Daily.
Hayward was a senior staff
writer for Volume 195 and news
editor for Volume 196. His
resume is miles long, and one
would think he'd feel very proud
upon hearing the election
results. Not so.
"1 feel very wet," said
Hayward, who ran on a platform
which proclaimed that The
Daily should be "sometimes ir
reverent in spirit." Apparently
for Hayward that irreverence
does not extend to getting wet.
"I was disturbed that cham
pagne was poured over my
head," said Hayward. "I was dis
turbed that our multi-thousand
(dollar, perhaps?) computer
would be ruined by champagne

spray.
The highly meticulous
Hayward is obsessed with or
ganization, according to his
roommate Gerry Diaz. He
arranges his books from the
shortest to the tallest and also
keeps a collection of cardigans
that he does not wear outside
his room.
Hayward is known for his an
noying habit of flipping his pen
while he talks to people. "It's
kind of an ego-boost because no
one else can flip it as many times
in a row."
Diaz described Hayward as
the "boy next door who loves
his family, his grandparents and
is obsessed with his dogs Augie
and Missy." Hayward called his
family in Seattle right after he
found out about his victory.
"My parents were a little ner
vous but they are glad that I
won."
Hayward is Mr. Serious, but
he does recall a funny incident
at The Daily. "Late one night
(current editor John) Wagner

and (Daily guru Mark)
Rogo(wsky) began throwing
oranges at each other. The
oranges became very smushed,
and after a while they ended up
being thrown against the wall.
I haven't seen Wagner laugh
that much ever since." So much
for our respect for these editors.
Hayward likes tennis, skiing,
movies, the theater — you name
it. His favorite food is spaghetti
"because it tastes good." (Have
you heard of anyone who does
not think his favorite food tastes
good anyway?)
Hayward's dislikes are also no
different from the average Stan
ford student. He complained
about the Draw. "It was good
last year when I drew into Ster
ling Quad. I think it degenerated
this year when I drew 4512 —
off campus!"
This summer Hayward will
intern at The Daily Review in
Hayward, California. He can't
escape from newspapers. It's all
in his name.
