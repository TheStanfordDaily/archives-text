Government rejects bailout
BONN, West Germany (AP) — The govern
ment yesterday rejected a bailout of weak East
German companies amid new signs that uni
fication may bring negative side effects to West
Germans.
Also yesterday, the president of the East
German parliament said political unification
could be complete by the end of the year.
The two Germanys last week signed a treaty
on joining their economies. That merger is to
take place July 2.
However, West Germany's opposition Social
Democrats charge that the treaty should go
further in protecting East German factories
and jobs and giving East German goods a fair
chance of competing with West German prod
ucts.
Gaviria urges support
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia's
presidential frontrunner said yesterday that
the United States must work harder at stop
ping the narcotics trade and more vigorously
prosecute drug suspects like Washington
Mayor Marion Barry.
Cesar Gaviria, the only of four candidates
in Sunday's election to take a hard-line stand
on Colombia's drug traffickers, complained
that Colombians are dying in the drug war,
while other nations take only limited action.
In a statement released yesterday, Gaviria
said the United States and other industrial
countries must take more responsibility. He
said other countries "are not showing a serious
commitment to end this scourge" of drug traf
fickers.
He also called for increased economic aid to
this violent-prone South American country.
Israelis celebrate anniversary
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of flag
waving Israelis celebrated the 1967 capture of
Arab east Jerusalem, and the government
launched a counteroffensive at critics who link
its hard-line policies to the killings of seven
Arabs.

was shot to death and four other people, in
cluding two policemen, were seriously wounded
during a six-hour clash at the Hitteen refugee
camp near the capital of Amman, police re
ported.
Iliescu criticizes opposition
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — lon Iliescu,
Romania's interim president and now its
president-elect, accused his opposition of po
litical immaturity yesterday for complaining
that his lopsided victory in weekend elections
was fraudulent.
He rejected a proposal that a commission
be set up to investigate allegations of electoral
fraud, a demand of the chief U.S. gov
ernment observer, Gov. Garrey Carruthers, R-
N.M.
"None of the foreign observers could point
to even one fact that constitutes fraud," Iliescu
insisted. "It's all based on claims by the op
position."
