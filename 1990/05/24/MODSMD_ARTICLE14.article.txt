# Lithuania desperate, reiterates compromise

### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Lithuania's par
liament tried again yesterday to get
the Kremlin to the negotiating table
by offering to suspend some of the
laws it passed after declaring indepen
dence March 11, while refusing to
suspend the declaration itself.
Lithuanian officials said earlier yes
terday that Soviet energy sanctions im
posed on the Baltic republic five weeks
ago will force all but emergency
vehicles off the road by the weekend.
Lithuania's president, Vytautas
Landsbergis, encouraged countrymen
to "survive as though we were in a
surrounded fortress."
"We are poor, but we'll not starve
to death," Landsbergis said in a speech
reported by the Lithuanian news
agency ELTA. "Our main weapon is
unity and stamina."
In a conciliatory gesture, the repub
lic's Supreme Council voted 74-15,
with 10 abstentions, for a resolution
that offers to suspend the laws if Mos
cow agrees to talks.
The resolution did not spell out
which laws could be suspended, but
Soviet officials have objected to meas
ures that would create a system of
special identification cards for Lithu
anian citizens, bar Soviet army draft
boards in Lithuania and establish
Lithuanian control over its borders.
Yesterday's resolution said Lithu
ania decided "to temporarily suspend,
for the period of official interstate ne
gotiations, those actions and decisions
arising from realization of the March
11, 1990, acts of the Supreme Council
of the Republic of Lithuania related
to interests that could be defined by
both parties as objects of negotia
tions," said a text released by the Lith
uanian parliament's press office.
Before yesterday's announcement,
the Baltic situation was settling into
a stalemate as Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev insisted that Lithuania
and its sister republics of Latvia and
Estonia retreat from independence.
Landsbergis and other Baltic leaders
have said they are willing to compro
mise but will not surrender their goal
of seceding from the Soviet Union,
which forcibly annexed all three

republics in 1940. Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia had been independent be
tween World War I and World War 11.
Gorbachev responded to Lithuania's
declaration of independence by cutting
off oil, natural gas and key raw ma
terials. Since energy supplies were cut
off April 18, factories in Lithuania
have ground to a halt, traffic has
thinned out and 19,000 people have
lost their jobs.
Soviet authorities have blocked hard

currency transfers to all three Baltic
republics, but otherwise have not used
the economic punishments against
Latvia and Estonia for their more cau
tious approach to secession.
A committee directing a strike by
non-Estonian workers for the past
three days to protest Estonia's seces
sion drive decided yesterday night to
call off the walkout, Tass reported.
The official Soviet news agency said
workers were told to return to their

jobs today because the strike commit
tee felt the main goal, to publicize its
cause, was achieved.
The Estonian News Agency said So
viet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov
sent a telegram asking that the strike
end "in view of the complicated polit
ical and economic situation in the
country." The report said the telegram
was sent "on behalf of the Soviet pres
ident" — Gorbachev.
