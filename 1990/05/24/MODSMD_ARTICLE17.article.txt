## Striving for unity 
### 
Responsibility lies
with next year's senate
to heal the divisions

THE ELECTION OF Solina
Kwan to the position of
ASSU Senate chair marks
a memorable moment in the
ASSU Senate. Not only is she
the first woman to chair the sen
ate, but she is the first woman
of color to hold the position.
As she begins her term as sen
ate chair, Kwan faces the chal
lenging task of unifying the
senate to work together for the
community.
This year's election controversy
has, in some ways, increased an
tagonism in the senate. Conflicts
between parties have heightened
tensions among senators.
Unfortunately, in the past the
senate chair has often had to take
the brunt of attacks from differ
ent parties in the senate.
Although Kwan begins her
term in the heat of much con
troversy, her unbiased guidance
can help calm a savage senate.
Responsibility lies with next
year's senators to heal the divi
sions that have occured this past
year. Senators of all parties need
to work with, rather than
against, each other.

Senators must also be held ac
countable to their constituents —
the various students and student
groups they represent. Kwan and
the senate need to work for the
benefit of the entire student body
without making party lines their
top priority.
Additionally, the concept of
openness in student government
needs to be addressed to ensure
responsibility as well as account
ability.
While acknowledging the dam
age done to the ASSU this year,
Kwan has expressed a commit
ment to building a cohesive ASSU
Senate next year. Moreover, she
has shown her committment to
keeping the ASSU in touch with
the student body.
As a woman of color, her guid
ance should help carry out the
goals of multiculturalism in order
to bring together different groups
on campus.
The open forum scheduled for
June will provide an opportunity
for student groups to meet with
their representatives, and give
the diverse organizations at Stan
ford a sense of unity.
As senate chair, Kwan will play
a significant role in carrying out
the true mission of the senate.
With a mark of confidence, we
wish the new senate chair the
best of luck in the coming year.
