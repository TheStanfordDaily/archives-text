Fraternities have unjustly been accused of sexism

AS MOST STUDENTS are aware,
fraternities at Stanford come
under continual fire for their
alleged racist and sexist practices. Two
of the most common complaints are
that fraternities' rosters do not share
the minority percentages that the rest
of Stanford boasts and that fraternities
are breeding grounds for misogyny and
even rape.
What many students do not realize
is that the majority of fraternity mem
bers are both cognizant of and con
cerned about these complaints; in fact,
many fraternity members have taken
action in attempts to improve their
reputation, only to encounter obstacles
created by the same individuals who
voiced the original accusations.
Consider the following event: in the

week prior to fraternity rush, In
tefraternity Council President Erik
Jorgensen was distributing flyers in the
Lagunita dining hall. These innocuous
flyers encouraged all students to attend
an informational meeting about rush.
Upon entering the south end of the
hall, Jorgensen quickly became the
object of verbal harrassment by a few
individuals. "Get outta here," they
said. "We oughta burn these," one
suggested. These individuals removed
the flyers, thus impeding an innocent
attempt to advertise rush to all stu
dents and to bolster minority member
ship in fraternities.
A similar incident occurred last
Thursday night. Two weeks before the
"Take Back the Night" march, two
members of the organizing committee
for this event asked the members of

Sigma Chi to place candles in their
windows in support of the march.
These fraternity members responded
by posting a sign reading "Sigma Chi
supports Take Back the Night," in
addition to placing candles in many
windows.
When the marchers (who, once again,
had suggested this form of support)
arrived at the house, the Sigma Chis
complied with their request to stop the
music being played inside. When the
band stopped playing, though, the
marchers hurled various insults, shout
ing, "Fuck you, assholes! Why would
you hypocrites support us?" Another
effort to throw sincere support behind
a worthy cause, then, was met with
catcalls and more stereotypes.
Earlier that evening, several individ
uals witnessed sorority pledges

seemingly "bowing to fraternity mem
bers." If these individuals had looked
past their biases, though, they would
have noticed that the pledges were
actually singing a sorority song, during
which they traditionally "bow,"
whether men are present or not.
These examples only touch the sur
face of the interference which fraterni
ties encounter when they try to amend
the current situation. We resent the
fact that many people on this campus
believe that we perpetuate racism and
sexism; in an effort to improve this
reputation, many of us have tried to
change these views. For once, though,
we'd like to receive some unadulterated
encouragement — not condemnation.
