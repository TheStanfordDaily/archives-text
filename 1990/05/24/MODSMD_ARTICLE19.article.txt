# Students, not groups set goals and make decisions for union
## 
### 
With outrage, we condemn the bla
tant attack against the Asian and
Pacific Islander Student Union, per
petrated by The Daily's inappropriate
expose-style article on the League of
Revolutionary Struggle.
The Daily article claimed that some
"highly secretive nationwide organiza
tion ... has considerable influence in
APSU." While making such serious
allegations, The Daily irresponsibly did
not bother to talk to a single member
on the Coordinating Committee, the
organizational body of APSU, to ask us
whether we had heard of such an or
ganization.
APSU is a statewide network of
Asian and Pacific Islander students â€”
and students are the only ones who

influence APSU. We students make our
own decisions in setting APSU's goals,
namely to help our communities. Our
commitment to institutionalize Asian-
American studies at universities across
the state of California originates only
from our own desire to attain an accu
rate and inclusive education.
The Daily's contortion of these just
demands as being "influenced" by some
sinister organization reinforces racism
against Asians. The rude treatment of
Asian-American students, implying that
we cannot think for ourselves or con
trol our own actions, must be con
demned.
APSU has organized many programs
and conferences on education. Just last
month, over 1,000 people attended the
12th annual APSU conference in Los
Angeles. In 1988, APSU co-sponsored
an educational conference at Stanford
where Jesse Jackson and Michael Du
kakis' son spoke. Stanford University
President Donald Kennedy welcomed
the 10,000 person crowd to this event.
Is The Daily next going to imply that

all these people are "influenced?"
