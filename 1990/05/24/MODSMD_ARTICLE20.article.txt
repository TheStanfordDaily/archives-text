# League's members are not secretive about their identity
## 
### 
My advice to The Daily: Give it a
rest. The "expose" of the League of
Revolutionary Struggle is one big
yawn. Groups like the League have
always existed on college campuses in
the real world, and always will. Stan
ford should be happy that it doesn't

also have the Spartacus Youth League
and the Revolutionary Communist
Party, organizations that operate in
Berkeley, San Francisco State and
most other places across the country.
These groups routinely attack the
League for being "mere liberal
reformers," in other words, a secretive
front group for the Rainbow Coalition
or (heaven forbid) the Democratic
Party.
I am not now, nor have I ever been,
a member of the League, but I know a
number of League members. They
have never hidden that fact from me,
nor have they tried to recruit me, sur
reptitiously or otherwise. They do not
"infiltrate" other campus organizations
because they believe in their goals, just
as they believe in the goals of the
League. I belong to both the American
Historical Association and KQED: does
that mean I'm a "mole" historian
trying to subvert the agenda of Public
Television?
