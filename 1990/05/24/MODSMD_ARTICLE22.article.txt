Obscure Voice 1: Comrades, we now
call to order this secret session of this
study session run by this secret organi
zation. You may put on your plastic Mao
Tse Tung masks now. Say the secret
pledge.
Obscure Voices: MAO IS GREAT,
MAO IS COOL. HE BREAKS LAWS
AND BAILS ON SCHOOL!
Obscure Voice: What has the higher
leadership orchestrated and master
minded for us to do this time comrade?
Obscure Voice: Our situation is des
perate. There are traitors among us who
have leaked out secrets to the public.
The higher leadership demands drastic
action.
Obscure Voices: WE ARE DUPED,
OUR BRAINS ARE GOO, WE'LL DO
WHAT YOU WANT US TO!
Obscure Voice: The higher leadership
calls for Master Plan Fortune Cookie. A
secret liasion from the Tea House has
provided us with fortune cookies with
clever sayings from Mao and Stalin
stuffed sneakily inside. Give them to your
friends, your professors, your RAs, your
RFs. Master Plan Sushi is currently un
derway also . . . even as I speak, one of
our dear comrades is busily making
Lenin-shaped sushi that will mold the
minds of even the most unsuspecting
roc mi too

STUDIES? HEY WHAT'S THAT? IT'S
JUST A FRONT FOR WHERE IT'S AT!
