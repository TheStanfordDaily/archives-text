# Daily staff members of color feel discrimination
## 
### 
WE, AS STAFF PERSONS of
color at The Daily, strongly
condemn The Daily's treatment
of the May 18 article on the poster
attacking Gordon Chang. We also
condemn the sidebar article on the
League of Revolutionary Struggle —
which we feel was irresponsibly re
ported — and the nature of the subse
quent coverage.
Fundamentally, the articles on the
League were patronizing and insulting
to the communities of color at Stan
ford. They offered tenuous and unsub
stantiated links to student of color
groups, giving the impression that
these students of color were duped by
the League. In order to have written
such articles, we feel one would have
to believe that people of color are
stupid enough to be duped into serving
as "front groups" of the League.
Moreover, the allegations are a direct
attack on the self-determination of
students of color, on the integrity of
student of color groups and on the
more than 20-year legacy of struggle,
sacrifice and positive change that
students of color have built on this
campus.
The May 18 article offered no objec
tive information about student of color
groups, the United Farm Workers,
Amiri Baraka or any other of the

supposed League affiliates listed. As a
matter of fact, in a journalistic style
we have never seen before at The
Daily, the article offered not a single
named source for its allegations.
Furthermore, The Daily's May 22
editorial was painfully hypocritical. On
the one hand, the editorial criticized
and condemned the "McCarthy-esque"
poster. On the other hand, The Daily
reprinted the flyer in full, advertising
the slander to the community. We feel
The Daily's article on the flyer actually
supported the flyer by misrepresenting
the Asian-American studies campaign,
saying that "several student organiza
tions worked last year to gain a
tenure-track professorship for Chang
.. although the campaign never
called for the hiring of a particular
individual. And The Daily legitimized
the flyer's racist and McCarthyistic
accusations with the sidebar, twice as
long as the actual flyer article, about
"a highly secretive nationwide organi
zation ... that focuses on people of
color groups for its mass support," and
other allegations which we feel were
inflammatory and underlyingly racist.
These Daily articles were themselves
McCarthyistic.
We feel The Daily's actions represent
a reckless and irresponsible abuse of
journalistic power. We realize that The

The allegations are a
direct attack on the self
determination of students
of color.

Daily is seen as a respected institution
that is able to shape the reality of this
campus. The Daily failed to uphold
journalistic standards. Such poor judg
ment demands responsible action.
We feel that this unfortunate inci
dent has revealed to us that we, as
Daily staff persons of color, have no
real respect or decision-making power
at The Daily. The multicultural editors
were not consulted on the fact that
such expose-style articles would be
printed, even though it was known
that the articles would have profound
effects on all the communities of color.
Even worse, the news features editor,
an African-American male who is
generally involved in all investigative
articles, was, we feel, purposely kept in
the dark that any such article was
being planned. We feel the only reason
he was excluded was because the color
of his skin made him suspect.
People of color were not allowed to

have any input into the decision to
run the May 18 article, subverting the
positions of people of color who are
editors and contradicting The Daily's
own claims of inclusiveness. We have
never experienced such a blatant abuse
of power and such a manipulation of
standard Daily processes and proce
dures.
Moreover, with the treatment of the
latest expose-article, printed on May
23, we feel staff persons of color were
relegated to a minimal and essentially
powerless role. Late Tuesday night, a
staff person of color was asked to read
the story, but was not given any
decision-making power on the
newsworthiness of the article. The
persons of color who did see the article
saw it only at the very end of a
months-long editorial process and felt
powerless to question the sources,
content or angle of the article.
We, as Daily staff persons of color,
are witness to the fact that The Daily
has shown no substantial remorse for
these disrespectful and dehumanizing
actions and continues to commit them.
Unfortunately, another indication of
the problems at The Daily is the fact
that there are very few staff persons
of color. Although there are not many
of us, we felt it was necessary for us
to make clear our condemnation of the

articles and to clarify our grievances.
We, as a group, have discussed possi
ble paths of action, including mass
resignation as a form of protest. Many
of us no longer want to be associated
with a paper like The Daily. However,
we realize that it is important that we
stay at The Daily and fight to make
The Daily reflective of all people,
regardless of race, gender or sexual
orientation. We hope that one day
students of color will be more than
tokens at The Daily.
