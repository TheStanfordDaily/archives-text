## Three advance in singles 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
A month and a half ago no one was
even sure whether Jared Palmer would
be able to play college tennis for the
remainder of the 1990 season. In a
match against UCLA April 6, after just
returning from surgery on one knee,
Palmer's other knee went out.
A second operation and a miraculous
recovery later, Palmer returned to the
courts to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Individual Championships April
26.
Unbelievably, Palmer made it to the
semifinals of the Pac-lOs and came
within an eyelash of beating the even
tual winner, UCLA's Jason Netter.
Still, there were questions as to
whether Palmer would be asked to com
pete in the NCAA individual singles
tournament. He was ranked No. 49 by
the Volvo Tennis /Collegiate Rankings,
but he still hadn't played for much of
the season.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said he
thought Palmer's chances were only
"fifty-fifty."
But Palmer, who Gould calls "one of
the most talented players I've ever
coached," made it into the tournament
and, after clobbering Joby Foley of West
Virginia yesterday in the first round,
different questions are now being asked.
Questions like "Can Palmer go all the
way?"
No one doubts that Palmer has the
talent to win the NCAAs. He probably
has more shots in his repertoire than
any player at the NCAAs.
No one doubts that he has the expe
rience. He has beaten experienced pro
fessionals like Kevin Curren and Jimmy
Arias and had a pro ranking of No. 223
in 1989.
Still, some people are wondering
whether or not Palmer has enough time
to get his game back up to its previous
level. Indeed, in the team competition,

Palmer was winning at No. 2 singles
but not playing up to his potential. His
return of serve was questionable.
"I didn't play especially well in the
team competition," Palmer admitted. "I
had a 3-1 record [at No. 2 singles] but
I wasn't as consistent as usual, espe
cially on my return of serve."
All that changed yesterday. Palmer's
return of serve was impeccable: low,
powerful, and consistent.
"My return of serve was the hardest
shot for me to get back after being off
(during the knee surgeries). It takes so
much timing. You've got to keep your
strokes short, and you have to react
well," Palmer said. "But today it came
back. I was stepping into the ball. I was
cutting off the angles. I was being ag
gressive on [every return]."
With his return of serve back, Palmer
looked practically unbeatable.
In fact, he came back from 4-0 down
yesterday to win in straight sets, 7-6,
6-3.
Foley couldn't believe it."I had to
play well to even get a game in that
match," Foley said.
"When I was down 4-0, I still had
confidence that I could get back into
it," Palmer said. "If I could get a few
second serves and hit some good
returns, I knew I could break him."
That's exactly what happened. Palmer
broke Foley twice and held serve three
times to go up 5-4. "I just kept getting
better and better as the match wore
on," Palmer said.
In the first-set tiebreaker, Palmer
dominated, smashing serves at Foley's
body and keeping every return of serve
at Foley's feet.
In the second set, Palmer continued
to play the consistent tennis that has
been absent since his injury.
"This was the first time since before
the knee operations that he has re
turned that well," Gould said. "He was
aggressive. He was stepping into every
thing."

Palmer will play Shaun O'Donovan
of Texas A&M in the next round.
"The only way I can look at this tour
nament is that it's anybody's to take,"
Palmer said. "It's definitely not in
anybody's hands. It's going to come
down to a few points in a few matches."
Gould definitely thinks Palmer can
win the tournament, but he says that
the freshman needs to "tighten up his
game a bit."
"He's so talented that he tends to get
a little inventive with his shots at
times," Gould said. "At this stage, I
think he has to not always go for the
spectacular shots. That's not to say he
shouldn't be aggressive, just that he
has to be consistent as well."
Palmer said the heat may be a de
ciding factor in the tournament. "I am
going to have to drink a lot of water,"
he said. "Today it wasn't so bad, but
if you're playing two or three matches
a dny, it can start to wear you out."
Palmer also will play doubles today.
He and teammate Jonathan Stark are
seeded second and will face Chris
Gregersen and Todd Martin of North
western.
"If my return comes around like it
did today, we'll be tough to beat," Pal
mer said. "I just have to make sure to
be aggressive and get my weight into it."
In other action, Stark and Alex
O'Brien moved into the second round
of the tournament as well.
Stark, the No. 2 seed, crunched Tim
Jessup of Tennessee 6-1, 6-4.
After an easy first set, Stark had a
brief let-up in the second. "I had a bad
service game when I was up 2-0 (in the
second set)," Stark said. "I let him back
into the match. Luckily, I broke him at
4-4, so I could win it in straight sets."
Stark will play Lou Gloria of South
Carolina today.
O'Brien, who is ranked No. 14 but
not seeded at the tournament, also won

in straight sets yesterday, clob
bering New Mexico's Jorge Ortega
6-2, 6-1.
O'Brien, who has been playing
like a machine on a mission lately,
seemed to be able to break Ortega
at will.

"Alex is moving his feet better
than he has all year," Gould said.
"That's the key to his game
(moving his feet). It's going to be
very tough to beat him, very
tough."
O'Brien will face Conny Falk
today. "Falk has the ability to win
the tournament but so does Alex.
It's going to be a great match,"
Gould said.

a dny, it can start to wear you out."
Palmer also will play doubles today.
He and teammate Jonathan Stark are
seeded second and will face Chris
Gregersen and Todd Martin of North
western.
"If my return comes around like it
did today, we'll be tough to beat," Pal
mer said. "I just have to make sure to
be aggressive and get my weight into it."
In other action, Stark and Alex
O'Brien moved into the second round
of the tournament as well.
Stark, the No. 2 seed, crunched Tim
Jessup of Tennessee 6-1, 6-4.
After an easy first set, Stark had a
brief let-up in the second. "I had a bad
service game when I was up 2-0 (in the
second set)," Stark said. "I let him back
into the match. Luckily, I broke him at
4-4, so I could win it in straight sets."
Stark will play Lou Gloria of South
Carolina today.
O'Brien, who is ranked No. 14 but
not seeded at the tournament, also won

round of the NCAA Individual Championships.
in straight sets yesterday, clob
bering New Mexico's Jorge Ortega
6-2, 6-1.
O'Brien, who has been playing
like a machine on a mission lately,
seemed to be able to break Ortega
at will.

"Alex is moving his feet better
than he has all year," Gould said.
"That's the key to his game
(moving his feet). It's going to be
very tough to beat him, very
tough."
O'Brien will face Conny Falk
today. "Falk has the ability to win
the tournament but so does Alex.
It's going to be a great match,"
Gould said.
A month and a half ago no one was
even sure whether Jared Palmer would
be able to play college tennis for the
remainder of the 1990 season. In a
match against UCLA April 6, after just
returning from surgery on one knee,
Palmer's other knee went out.
A second operation and a miraculous
recovery later, Palmer returned to the
courts to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Individual Championships April
26.
Unbelievably, Palmer made it to the
semifinals of the Pac-lOs and came
within an eyelash of beating the even
tual winner, UCLA's Jason Netter.
Still, there were questions as to
whether Palmer would be asked to com
pete in the NCAA individual singles
tournament. He was ranked No. 49 by
the Volvo Tennis /Collegiate Rankings,
but he still hadn't played for much of
the season.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said he
thought Palmer's chances were only
"fifty-fifty."
But Palmer, who Gould calls "one of
the most talented players I've ever
coached," made it into the tournament
and, after clobbering Joby Foley of West
Virginia yesterday in the first round,
different questions are now being asked.
Questions like "Can Palmer go all the
way?"
No one doubts that Palmer has the
talent to win the NCAAs. He probably
has more shots in his repertoire than
any player at the NCAAs.
No one doubts that he has the expe
rience. He has beaten experienced pro
fessionals like Kevin Curren and Jimmy
Arias and had a pro ranking of No. 223
in 1989.
Still, some people are wondering
whether or not Palmer has enough time
to get his game back up to its previous
level. Indeed, in the team competition,

Palmer was winning at No. 2 singles
but not playing up to his potential. His
return of serve was questionable.
"I didn't play especially well in the
team competition," Palmer admitted. "I
had a 3-1 record [at No. 2 singles] but
I wasn't as consistent as usual, espe
cially on my return of serve."
All that changed yesterday. Palmer's
return of serve was impeccable: low,
powerful, and consistent.
"My return of serve was the hardest
shot for me to get back after being off
(during the knee surgeries). It takes so
much timing. You've got to keep your
strokes short, and you have to react
well," Palmer said. "But today it came
back. I was stepping into the ball. I was
cutting off the angles. I was being ag
gressive on [every return]."
With his return of serve back, Palmer
looked practically unbeatable.
In fact, he came back from 4-0 down
yesterday to win in straight sets, 7-6,
6-3.
Foley couldn't believe it."I had to
play well to even get a game in that
match," Foley said.
"When I was down 4-0, I still had
confidence that I could get back into
it," Palmer said. "If I could get a few
second serves and hit some good
returns, I knew I could break him."
That's exactly what happened. Palmer
broke Foley twice and held serve three
times to go up 5-4. "I just kept getting
better and better as the match wore
on," Palmer said.
In the first-set tiebreaker, Palmer
dominated, smashing serves at Foley's
body and keeping every return of serve
at Foley's feet.
In the second set, Palmer continued
to play the consistent tennis that has
been absent since his injury.
"This was the first time since before
the knee operations that he has re
turned that well," Gould said. "He was
aggressive. He was stepping into every
thing."

Palmer will play Shaun O'Donovan
of Texas A&M in the next round.
"The only way I can look at this tour
nament is that it's anybody's to take,"
Palmer said. "It's definitely not in
anybody's hands. It's going to come
down to a few points in a few matches."
Gould definitely thinks Palmer can
win the tournament, but he says that
the freshman needs to "tighten up his
game a bit."
"He's so talented that he tends to get
a little inventive with his shots at
times," Gould said. "At this stage, I
think he has to not always go for the
spectacular shots. That's not to say he
shouldn't be aggressive, just that he
has to be consistent as well."
Palmer said the heat may be a de
ciding factor in the tournament. "I am
going to have to drink a lot of water,"
he said. "Today it wasn't so bad, but
if you're playing two or three matches
a dny, it can start to wear you out."
Palmer also will play doubles today.
He and teammate Jonathan Stark are
seeded second and will face Chris
Gregersen and Todd Martin of North
