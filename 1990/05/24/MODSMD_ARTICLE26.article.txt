# Stanford baseball '90: breaking all the rules
## 
### 
There are a few things in
life that people just
shouldn't be allowed to
do.
You know what I mean. Mi
chael Jordan does something
in each and every game that
absolutely amazes everyone,
and that's fine with me, but,
darnit, sometimes it's just not
fair. How can a human being
jump 45 feet through the air,
spin four times, do two flips,
cradle the ball and then slam
it home while still on the way
up?

It just shouldn't be allowed.
Therefore, in the spirit of Mi
chael, and in honor of the Stan
ford baseball team, let's look
at a few things the 1990 Car
dinal has accomplished that
have left people thinking "Oh,
wow."
Because, if you think about
it, this team has crushed a lot
of the conventional baseball
wisdom — and amazed a lot of
people — this season.
The following you absolutely,
positively cannot do:
First let's take Jeff Ham
monds. Against Arizona
March 11, Hammonds
scored from second on a
grounder to short. Yes, from
second. Yes, that's pretty hard
to do.
Of course, Hammonds has
done a few other ridiculous
things this year: Against
Hawaii, he stole a base stand
ing up. He had a 37-game hit
ting streak, which is the
longest in school history by
nine games. He became the
first freshman in 20 years to
be named to first-team all Six-
Pac. He'll break the school
record for steals this weekend.
No one could be that good
that young. Could they?
Then there's Tim Griffin.
This is the one that has driven
pitchers crazy all year: How on
earth does a man with seven
career home runs hit 21 in a
single season, including two
grand slams in one game?
It's just not fair.
Ryan Turner is next. This is
a man who had a career batting
average of .094 before this
season. That's zero-nine-four.
How's he done this year? Oh,
terribly: Turner is second on

the team in hitting at .347 and
hasn't committed an error all
year.
And then there's his knack
for coming through in the
clutch: Turner had the game
winning hit in the bottom of
the 12th against Arizona St.
last month, and a week later,
down 2-1 in the top of the ninth
at Cal, with two outs, he
homered to send the game to
extra innings.
Now, how does a player with
all of two career dongs do that?
Of course, Turner isn't the
only Cardinal player to raise
his average by a zillion points
this year. Troy Tallman, who
hit .151 in '89, has only boosted
that to .284 while hitting eight
homers this season — as op
posed to two last year.
Troy Paulsen? Twenty-seven
doubles (a school record by
five). David McCarty? Five
homers and 20 RBI last year.
Twelve and sixty-two this
season, while raising his
average 50 points to .346.
How can you do that?
Of course, the Cardinal
hasn't been outstanding
only on offense, even
though this team has broken
records for doubles and homers
while winning the Six-Pac bat
ting title for the first time ever.
Take the defense: a .971
fielding percentage, which is a
school record. At least once a
week, Roger Burnett makes a
play that's completely ridic
ulous, like the time he dove 25
feet sideway through the air to
grab a bouncer for a force to
help beat San Jose State. For
this team, that's a yawner. Oh,
a throw from deep in the hole
lying on your back to beat the
runner by two feet? No big
deal.
The thing that's most
amazing about this team,
though, isn't the outstanding
performances — although
there have been plenty of those.
Paul Carey? Six school career
records broken this year.
No, despite all the records,
despite all the you-simply
can't-do-this-but-we-can plays,
the most amazing thing about
the 1990 Stanford Cardinal is
that it's a team that absolutely
refuses to lose. Fifty-two wins
in a season. That's insane.
But hey, it's not surprising.
The players just simply don't
ever believe they can lose.
Sophomore David Holbrook
said so after Sunday's season
finale. In that game, the Car
dinal spotted UCSB and eight
run lead. And won anyway.
Holbrook hit a grand slam
in the bottom of the eighth to
win that one.

grand slams in one game?
It's just not fair.
Ryan Turner is next. This is
a man who had a career batting
average of .094 before this
season. That's zero-nine-four.
How's he done this year? Oh,
terribly: Turner is second on

the team in hitting at .347 and
hasn't committed an error all
year.
And then there's his knack
for coming through in the
clutch: Turner had the game
winning hit in the bottom of
the 12th against Arizona St.
last month, and a week later,
down 2-1 in the top of the ninth
at Cal, with two outs, he
homered to send the game to
extra innings.
Now, how does a player with
all of two career dongs do that?
Of course, Turner isn't the
only Cardinal player to raise
his average by a zillion points
this year. Troy Tallman, who
hit .151 in '89, has only boosted
that to .284 while hitting eight
homers this season — as op
posed to two last year.
Troy Paulsen? Twenty-seven
doubles (a school record by
five). David McCarty? Five
homers and 20 RBI last year.
Twelve and sixty-two this
season, while raising his
average 50 points to .346.
How can you do that?
Of course, the Cardinal
hasn't been outstanding
only on offense, even
though this team has broken
records for doubles and homers
while winning the Six-Pac bat
ting title for the first time ever.
Take the defense: a .971
fielding percentage, which is a
school record. At least once a
week, Roger Burnett makes a
play that's completely ridic
ulous, like the time he dove 25
feet sideway through the air to
grab a bouncer for a force to
help beat San Jose State. For
this team, that's a yawner. Oh,
a throw from deep in the hole
lying on your back to beat the
runner by two feet? No big
deal.
The thing that's most
amazing about this team,
though, isn't the outstanding
performances — although
there have been plenty of those.
Paul Carey? Six school career
records broken this year.
No, despite all the records,
despite all the you-simply
can't-do-this-but-we-can plays,
the most amazing thing about
the 1990 Stanford Cardinal is
that it's a team that absolutely
refuses to lose. Fifty-two wins
in a season. That's insane.
But hey, it's not surprising.
The players just simply don't
ever believe they can lose.
Sophomore David Holbrook
said so after Sunday's season
finale. In that game, the Car
dinal spotted UCSB and eight
run lead. And won anyway.
Holbrook hit a grand slam
in the bottom of the eighth to
win that one.
