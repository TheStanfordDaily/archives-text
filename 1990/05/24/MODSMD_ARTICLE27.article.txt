# Ice in his veins: Hockey is Carey's first love
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Late afternoon at Sunken
Diamond, and five
youngsters are playing
catch with a legend.
Half an hour earlier, Stanford's
Paul Carey had sent a ninth
inning Mark Juhas fastball
soaring off into the twilight to
give the Cardinal an 11-9 win
against California. It was Carey's
11th homer of the year, bringing
his school-record career total to
51.
Now, in the Cardinal pen, after
most of the fans have left, Carey
is playing bullpen catcher. The
five boys — the oldest of them
maybe eight years old — are
standing on the hill, firing at the
crouching superstar. Other
youngsters interrupt now and
then to get autographs, but mostly
the action is five little kids
pretending to be Roger Clemens
and one big kid pretending to be
Carlton Fisk.
As each boy pitches, he takes a
lunging step down from the
mound, which wasn't exactly built
for eight-year-old legs. Soon
things get a little out of hand,
though: each boy tosses, falls, gets
the ball back from Carey and then
tries to throw while someone else
is doing the same.
"One at a time, one at a time!"
Carey laughs.
The boys take about five
minutes to figure out who gets
to go first, and then Carey
resumes his crouch. "Attaway —
take turns," Carey says.
Soon most of the boys are called
to join their parents, leaving
Carey and a lefity wearing an An
gels cap in the bullpen. "Hey
Dad!" the boy yells up the hill to
his father. "I can pitch good —
ask Paul!"
"He is good," Carey smiles.
A few fastballs later it's time
to go home. The boy's father
thanks Carey, and the Cardinal
right fielder waves goodbye, dis

appearing into the clubhouse.
Mark Langston Jr. smiles all the
way home.
How many of us get to play
catch with our heroes?
The little kid that is Paul
Carey will play the last
game of his incredible
career sometime in the next two
weeks. With luck, that final game
will be in the College World Series
championship on June 9.
Even if it isn't, though, Carey's
college years have already given
him a lot to look back and smile
upon. How do you become a
legend? Simple:
You break your school and
Pacific 10 Conference records for
career home runs, RBI, total bases
and games played;
You break the school records
for career hits, doubles and at
bats;
You bat .336 — with power —
for four years;
You hit a bottom-of-the-tenth
grand slam in the College World
Series semifinal to put your team
in the championship game;
And, most importantly, you lead
your team to two straight national
titles and a shot at a third.
Carey has done all that and
more in his four years at Stanford,
which isn't bad for someone who,
deep down inside ... would really
rather be playing hockey.
Hold up. Hockey? "Hockey,"
says Carey, whose hometown is
Weymouth, Mass. "To this day
hockey's my favorite sport. It's
fun, it's a team sport. You're not
one-on-one against a pitcher in
front of all the people. You can
mess up a bunch of times and
still come back. . . . It's a lot more
fun."
Wonderful. The man countless
Little Leaguers idolize ... would
rather be on an ice rink, crashing
into people.
"I loved the Boston Bruins
when I was growing up," Carey
says. "Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito
. . . they were my heroes."

Hockey? Why, for Pete's sake?
"It's physical," says the 6-4,
212-pound Carey. "It's emotional:
It's kind of like football in the
sense that you can play on emo
tion to get up for the games. In
baseball it's almost like you have
to contain your emotion and really
concentrate.
"I was recruited back east, and
I could've played on a scholar
ship," says Carey, who was a
defenseman. "I liked defense be
cause it was physical; I got to hit
people. People try to come down
on you, and you can just crush

em.
Carey hasn't been able to play
much in the last few years, but
he still hits the rink every chance
he gets.
"The past winters when I've

gone home I've played," Carey
says. "I'd just hack around with
a stick and a puck. Even out here
I've gone skating a bunch of
times. There's a place right here
in Palo Alto, and I've gone this
year. It's fun, it's relaxing."»
But is it a career alternative?
"I've been thinking — if I don't
do well in the draft, if I don't get
a nice offer, maybe I'll go back
east and play hockey," Carey says.
Right.
Don't count on seeing Carey
in the black and gold of
the Bruins anytime soon,
because he'll be playing ball as
soon as someone picks him in next
month's pro draft.


At Green - Oalfy We
Though Paul Carey has shown s talent for swinging the bst, he
prefers swinging a hockey stick. The Massachusetts native was a
highly recruited high echool hockey prospect.
Hopefully, that someone will be
— c'mon, guess! — the Boston
Red Sox.
"I grew up on the East Coast,
I went to Fenway Park my whole
life, I grew up with the American
League East," Carey says. "It'd
be a dream fulfilled to be able to
put on a Red Sox uniform and
play in Fenway Park someday."
That's not a surprise, consider
ing Carey (along with the rest of
New England) has been crazy
about the Sox since long before
he stayed up past his bedtime to
watch Fisk's sixth-game for-the
ages home run in the 1975 World
Series.
"I was watching on TV," says
Carey, who was seven at the time.
"Unbelievable."
Carey wasn't at Fenway for the
game, which was unusual. "I must
have been really young (the first
time I went to Fenway)," he says.
"Four or five. I used to go a lot
with my dad and a lot with my
aunt. We used to go up in the
bleacher seats — one dollar, a dol
lar fifty cents.
"I remember going to the '78
playoff game against the
Yankees," Carey says. "Carl
Yazstremski hit one out, and then
Bucky Dent hit that three-run
homer to win it for the Yankees."
Even though his whole baseball

life had been the Sox, the thought
of actually playing for them
wasn't very prominent for Carey.
"I never really started thinking
about it until last year, honest to
God," he says. "Growing up I was
always a little bit better than the
average person, and everyone
kept telling me 'You're going to
be in the big leagues, you're going
to be in the big leagues.'
"I never believed it," Carey
says."I just said in the back of
my head 'Yeah, whatever.' It went
in one ear and out the other, and
I just went out and played."
And quite well: Carey was
drafted in the fourth round by
the Detroit Tigers last year, but
decided to come back to school.
"Turning down a lot of money
to come back to school — 99 per
cent of the people would say I was
crazy and still think I'm crazy,"
Carey says.
"That's me!" pitcher Mike Mus
sina chimes in.
' But still: Coming back, win
ning the Pac-10, hosting a region
al, being No. 1 ... to be where
we are right now makes it all
worth it," Carey says. "That's
what it's all about: going out
there, being with your friends,
competing and winning."
And maybe, some time in the
next few years, Carey will get a
chance to play catch with some
kids at Fenway.

Bruins.

"Four or five. I used to go a lot
with my dad and a lot with my
aunt. We used to go up in the
bleacher seats — one dollar, a dol
lar fifty cents.
"I remember going to the '78
playoff game against the
Yankees," Carey says. "Carl
Yazstremski hit one out, and then
Bucky Dent hit that three-run
homer to win it for the Yankees."
Even though his whole baseball

life had been the Sox, the thought
of actually playing for them
wasn't very prominent for Carey.
"I never really started thinking
about it until last year, honest to
God," he says. "Growing up I was
always a little bit better than the
average person, and everyone
kept telling me 'You're going to
be in the big leagues, you're going
to be in the big leagues.'
"I never believed it," Carey
says."I just said in the back of
my head 'Yeah, whatever.' It went
in one ear and out the other, and
I just went out and played."
And quite well: Carey was
drafted in the fourth round by
the Detroit Tigers last year, but
decided to come back to school.
"Turning down a lot of money
to come back to school — 99 per
cent of the people would say I was
crazy and still think I'm crazy,"
Carey says.
"That's me!" pitcher Mike Mus
sina chimes in.
' But still: Coming back, win
ning the Pac-10, hosting a region
al, being No. 1 ... to be where
we are right now makes it all
worth it," Carey says. "That's
what it's all about: going out
there, being with your friends,
competing and winning."
And maybe, some time in the
next few years, Carey will get a
chance to play catch with some
kids at Fenway.
If he's not playing for the
Bruins.
Late afternoon at Sunken
Diamond, and five
youngsters are playing
catch with a legend.
Half an hour earlier, Stanford's
Paul Carey had sent a ninth
inning Mark Juhas fastball
soaring off into the twilight to
give the Cardinal an 11-9 win
against California. It was Carey's
11th homer of the year, bringing
his school-record career total to
51.
Now, in the Cardinal pen, after
most of the fans have left, Carey
is playing bullpen catcher. The
five boys — the oldest of them
maybe eight years old — are
standing on the hill, firing at the
crouching superstar. Other
youngsters interrupt now and
then to get autographs, but mostly
the action is five little kids
pretending to be Roger Clemens
and one big kid pretending to be
Carlton Fisk.
As each boy pitches, he takes a
lunging step down from the
mound, which wasn't exactly built
for eight-year-old legs. Soon
things get a little out of hand,
though: each boy tosses, falls, gets
the ball back from Carey and then
tries to throw while someone else
is doing the same.
"One at a time, one at a time!"
Carey laughs.
The boys take about five
minutes to figure out who gets
to go first, and then Carey
resumes his crouch. "Attaway —
take turns," Carey says.
Soon most of the boys are called
to join their parents, leaving
Carey and a lefity wearing an An
gels cap in the bullpen. "Hey
Dad!" the boy yells up the hill to
his father. "I can pitch good —
ask Paul!"
"He is good," Carey smiles.
A few fastballs later it's time
to go home. The boy's father
thanks Carey, and the Cardinal
right fielder waves goodbye, dis

appearing into the clubhouse.
Mark Langston Jr. smiles all the
way home.
How many of us get to play
catch with our heroes?
The little kid that is Paul
Carey will play the last
game of his incredible
career sometime in the next two
weeks. With luck, that final game
will be in the College World Series
championship on June 9.
Even if it isn't, though, Carey's
college years have already given
him a lot to look back and smile
upon. How do you become a
legend? Simple:
You break your school and
Pacific 10 Conference records for
career home runs, RBI, total bases
and games played;
You break the school records
for career hits, doubles and at
bats;
You bat .336 — with power —
for four years;
You hit a bottom-of-the-tenth
grand slam in the College World
Series semifinal to put your team
in the championship game;
And, most importantly, you lead
your team to two straight national
titles and a shot at a third.
Carey has done all that and
more in his four years at Stanford,
which isn't bad for someone who,
deep down inside ... would really
rather be playing hockey.
Hold up. Hockey? "Hockey,"
says Carey, whose hometown is
Weymouth, Mass. "To this day
hockey's my favorite sport. It's
fun, it's a team sport. You're not
one-on-one against a pitcher in
front of all the people. You can
mess up a bunch of times and
still come back. . . . It's a lot more
fun."
Wonderful. The man countless
Little Leaguers idolize ... would
rather be on an ice rink, crashing
into people.
"I loved the Boston Bruins
when I was growing up," Carey
says. "Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito
. . . they were my heroes."

Hockey? Why, for Pete's sake?
"It's physical," says the 6-4,
212-pound Carey. "It's emotional:
It's kind of like football in the
sense that you can play on emo
tion to get up for the games. In
baseball it's almost like you have
to contain your emotion and really
concentrate.
"I was recruited back east, and
I could've played on a scholar
ship," says Carey, who was a
defenseman. "I liked defense be
cause it was physical; I got to hit
people. People try to come down
on you, and you can just crush

em.
Carey hasn't been able to play
much in the last few years, but
he still hits the rink every chance
he gets.
"The past winters when I've

gone home I've played," Carey
says. "I'd just hack around with
a stick and a puck. Even out here
I've gone skating a bunch of
times. There's a place right here
in Palo Alto, and I've gone this
year. It's fun, it's relaxing."»
But is it a career alternative?
"I've been thinking — if I don't
do well in the draft, if I don't get
a nice offer, maybe I'll go back
east and play hockey," Carey says.
Right.
Don't count on seeing Carey
in the black and gold of
the Bruins anytime soon,
because he'll be playing ball as
soon as someone picks him in next
month's pro draft.

Though Paul Carey has shown s talent for swinging the bst, he
prefers swinging a hockey stick. The Massachusetts native was a
highly recruited high echool hockey prospect.
Hopefully, that someone will be
— c'mon, guess! — the Boston
Red Sox.
"I grew up on the East Coast,
I went to Fenway Park my whole
life, I grew up with the American
League East," Carey says. "It'd
be a dream fulfilled to be able to
put on a Red Sox uniform and
play in Fenway Park someday."
That's not a surprise, consider
ing Carey (along with the rest of
New England) has been crazy
about the Sox since long before
he stayed up past his bedtime to
watch Fisk's sixth-game for-the
ages home run in the 1975 World
Series.
"I was watching on TV," says
Carey, who was seven at the time.
"Unbelievable."
