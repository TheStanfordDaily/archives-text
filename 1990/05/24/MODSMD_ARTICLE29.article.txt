# Moore leads after first round
## But women's golf team stuck in eighth place at NCAAs 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Since Texas is in first place in
the team competition after the
first round of the NCAA Women's
Golf Championships, Stanford
sophomore and Dallas native
Adele Moore figured it was only
right that she do her part for the
lone star state. And with her
opening round score of 71, good
enough for first place individually,
Moore has more than done her
part.
Unfortunately, the rest of the
Cardinal did not have such luck
yesterday at the Arthur Hills Golf
Course in Hilton Head, S.C. The
team finished with a disappoint
ing first-round score of 311 that
puts Stanford in a three-way tie
for eighth place, 12 shots off the
lead.
Despite the poor outing, the
Cardinal are only five shots out
of third place and are certainly
still in the hunt for the tourna
ment title with three days of golf
left to be played.
As Audrey Wooding said, "We're
pretty disappointed, but we're not
out of the tournament by any
means. When we finished the day,
we were pretty down but then we
saw how the other teams did, and
this cheered us up a bit."
Something else that ought to
cheer the Cardinal up is the per
formance of Moore. Coach Tim
Baldwin was full of praise for his
star golfer. "Adele played great
golf today. She really knows how
to play in big tournaments and
she sure showed this today. She
is leading the number one
amatuer tournament in the world,
and that's really exciting."
Wooding added that "Adele
played really solid golf today. She's
been practicing very hard and it

showed in her game."
The play of junior Jodi Figley
is also reason for the Cardinal to
be excited. Figley shot a two-over
par round of 74 to finish in a tie
for seventh place.
Baldwin said, "Jodi played a
real solid 18 holes today. She
played Jodi Figley golf and was
just on cruise control the whole
day."
Figley's teammates were stuck
in a different gear, however.
Wooding and Stephanie Davis, the
team's two most consistent golfers
of the year, suffered unusual sub
standard rounds yesterday, shoot
ing an 84 and 85, respectively.
But these two should rebound
in the upcoming rounds. Baldwin
is counting on it.
"Stephanie and Audrey are dis
appointed, but they are very de
termined and will be back.
They're competitors, and I expect
them to come out and have a good
day tomorrow."
The Cardinal will need to have
good days from them and contin
ued strong performances from
Figley and Moore if the team
hopes to move up in the standings.
In order to do this, Stanford will
have to master the extraordinarily
difficult course that the tourna
ment is being held on.
Going into the NCAAs, Baldwin
and his team knew the course
would be difficult, but the Cardi-

'We're pretty disappointed, but we're not
out of the tournament by any means. When
we finished the day, we were pretty down but
then we saw how the other teams did, and
this cheered us up a bit.'

nal coach did not think it would
be as difficult as it turned out to
be.
"This is definitely the toughest
course we've played on all year
long," Baldwin said. "There are
literally lagoons bordering almost
all the holes, and this means that
there are no margins at all for
error."
Wooding obviously had a tough
time with the aquatic nature of
the course. "I would be doing all
right, and then I'd run into some
trouble on one hole. If you play
well, then the course isn't that
much a factor, but if you don't
play it right, you've got trouble."
The back nine is especially
tough, so the Cardinal has to be
pleased that it played better in
this half of the round, shooting
a 151 as compared to a 160 on
the front nine. As Baldwin said,
"We got tough in the end and
battled it out."
One additional benefit to the
team yesterday was the play of
senior Stephanie Parel. Although
her round of 82 wasn't a very
good round, it was the team's
third lowest of the day and made
up for the surprisingly poor
showings of Davis and Wooding.
Yet her performance should not
be surprising. After all, she's from
San Antonio. What a day for
Texas.
