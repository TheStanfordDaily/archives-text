# Administrators had hands-off concern about League
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
Involvement of students and staff at
Stanford in a secretive nationwide or
ganization known as the League of
Revolutionary Struggle has been met
by administators over the past few
years with hands-off concern, accord
ing to admininstrators interviewed by
The Daily.
The involvement "certainly concerns
me," said University President Donald
Kennedy. "I really worry about organ
izations that must hide behind veils
of secrecy. I think it's very antithetical
to the values of this community, so it
troubles me in that way."
But at the same time, the University
cannot be "turning over rocks and in
vestigating organizations just because

of some tenuous evidence" the Uni
versity had that the League has influ
enced Stanford students, he said.
"Had we found an easy way to get
information [on the League at Stan
ford], I suppose we would have. I
couldn't think of any way of doing
that," Kennedy said.
The League, also known as the
Unity League, has been able to help
shape student government policies by
recruiting Stanford students into its
membership and by trying to place
them in influential student govern
ment positions, The Daily has found.
Last Friday, Kennedy met with five
students who said they were recruited
over the past three years by the
League. The students called the meet
ing to give Kennedy more information
on the recruitment tactics of the

League.
"We're much more
tapped into these
things than folks be
lieve," said Assoc.
Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Jackson.
But Jackson said he
had no direct knowl
edge of the extent of
the League's influence

at Stanford, nor had he attempted to
find out more information about the
League.
"I don't think it's mv job, or neces
sarily anyone's job or right, to march
into some investigation of [the League]
and its influence on Stanford stu
dents," Jackson said.
Kennedy said he was particularly
concerned with the involvement of

staff members at Stanford in the
recruitment of individuals into the
League.
"It is the duty of staff members to
be behind the institution's agenda and
not pursuing their own," Kennedy
said. "It is important for staff mem
bers to be forthcoming about those
relationships if they involve particular
commitments and particularly if they
involve active proselytizing of stu
dents."
Members of the administration be
came particularly aware of the
League's influence during last year's
takeover of Kennedy's office. Jackson
reported seeing individuals that he did
not recognize giving advice to students
involved in the takeover as possible

evidence of outside influence.
Administration officials also
cited what they saw as a tight
leadership core and considerable
advance planning as possible in
dications of outside influence,
most likely by the League, they
said. Reports of the high quality
of the barricades to keep the police
outside the building was one ex
ample of what the administration
considered to be advance plan
ning, according to Kennedy.
"Since we knew that there was
outside involvement and since we
knew that Unity League was a
fairly pervasive organization with
lots of influence at lots of cam
puses, it didn't sound implausible
to me" that the League was in
volved in the takeover, Kennedy

said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Jackson were particu
larly concerned with a mysterious
man named Fred, who partici
pated in a march to Kennedy's
office the day after the takeover.
Jackson saw Fred talking to stu
dent leaders and confronted him
to find out who he was, but Fred
refused to answer any questions.
* 'Who's Fred?' became a bit of
a campus joke in certain circles,"
according to Kennedy.
Although he could not be posi
tively identified by The Daily,
Fred is believed by a number of
students involved in the takeover
to be a League member attending
San Jose State University.
On the morning of the takeover,
Lyons made phone calls to admin
istrators at other area universities
to determine whether they were
also experiencing building
takeovers or other student ac
tions. According to Lyons, actions

at other universities could be an
indication that there was a larger
outside group organizing the
movement. Lyons found no other
actions at other universities.
Beyond this initial contact with
other universities and Jackson's
confrontation with Fred, admin
istration members made no at
tempts to investigate possible
outside influence. Once a dialogue
was established with the students
involved in the takeover, question
ing the outside influence "became
counterproductive, because from
my perspective students wanted
to project and own responsibility
for their actions and we wanted
them to take responsibility for
their actions," Jackson said.
"The important thing to us was
dealing with the issues and not
pursuing an effort to show that
it was all agitation from the out
side," Kennedy said. "I just don't
think that (effort) is the right pos
ture."

"On the other hand, I really
am concerned when students, and
particularly freshmen, are influ
enced by people who are working
for their own agendas," Kennedy
said.
"Show me a campus without
the presence of some kind of ex
tremist ideas, and I'll show you
a campus that's in deep yogurt,"
Lyons said. But "show me a
campus where those ideas are
being implemented, where the
control really is external, and I'll
show you a campus that's also in
trouble."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said he had no direct
knowledge of the League or of its
activities. "A long time ago, I
stopped worrying about what
groups did what," he said.
The Stanford Police Depart
ment keeps track of only "the
groups that have a potential for
violence," Herrington said. He
said he did not consider the

League to be such a group.
University General Counsel
John Schwartz said he was not
aware of the League and had no
direct knowledge of outside influ
ence at the takeover.
Jackson compared the influence
of the League to national chapters
of fraternities and sororities.
"Sigma Chi on campus is affili
ated with a national organization
called Sigma Chi, but they still
have local autonomy on campus,
and what we would expect is that
those students would be making
their own decisions," he said.

"I don't want to single out one
group or another as long as our
students still feel in control of
their lives, feel in control of their
own personal political view
points," Jackson said.
"If some of our students believe
that they want to be in one or
ganization or another, then this
is America. Freedom of choice,
and I respect that," said Jackson.
"The place where I get concerned
is the extent to which it creates
less dialogue and students are
being manipulated. If they are,
we're clearly concerned."
