# Administrators had hands-off concern about League

### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
Involvement of students and staff at
Stanford in a secretive nationwide or
ganization known as the League of
Revolutionary Struggle has been met
by administators over the past few
years with hands-off concern, accord
ing to admininstrators interviewed by
The Daily.
The involvement "certainly concerns
me," said University President Donald
Kennedy. "I really worry about organ
izations that must hide behind veils
of secrecy. I think it's very antithetical
to the values of this community, so it
troubles me in that way."
But at the same time, the University
cannot be "turning over rocks and in
vestigating organizations just because

of some tenuous evidence" the Uni
versity had that the League has influ
enced Stanford students, he said.
"Had we found an easy way to get
information [on the League at Stan
ford], I suppose we would have. I
couldn't think of any way of doing
that," Kennedy said.
The League, also known as the
Unity League, has been able to help
shape student government policies by
recruiting Stanford students into its
membership and by trying to place
them in influential student govern
ment positions, The Daily has found.
Last Friday, Kennedy met with five
students who said they were recruited
over the past three years by the
League. The students called the meet
ing to give Kennedy more information
on the recruitment tactics of the

League.
"We're much more
tapped into these
things than folks be
lieve," said Assoc.
Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Jackson.
But Jackson said he
had no direct knowl
edge of the extent of
the League's influence

at Stanford, nor had he attempted to
find out more information about the
League.
"I don't think it's mv job, or neces
sarily anyone's job or right, to march
into some investigation of [the League]
and its influence on Stanford stu
dents," Jackson said.
Kennedy said he was particularly
concerned with the involvement of

staff members at Stanford in the
recruitment of individuals into the
League.
"It is the duty of staff members to
be behind the institution's agenda and
not pursuing their own," Kennedy
said. "It is important for staff mem
bers to be forthcoming about those
relationships if they involve particular
commitments and particularly if they
involve active proselytizing of stu
dents."
Members of the administration be
came particularly aware of the
League's influence during last year's
takeover of Kennedy's office. Jackson
reported seeing individuals that he did
not recognize giving advice to students
involved in the takeover as possible
