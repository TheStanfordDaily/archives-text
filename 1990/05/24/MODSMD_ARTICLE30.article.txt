## Men's golf team prepares for blustery NCAA tournament 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
Ask Stanford men's golf coach
Wally Goodwin what he remem
bers most about the 1989 NCAA
Western Regional Tournament,
and you'll get a one word an
swer: "wind."
In last year's regional, Stan
ford was a round away from ad
vancing to the national
championship tourney before
gale-force gusts roared threw El
Paso, Texas and took with them
the Cardinal linksters' aspira
tions of playing for a NCAA title.
As play commences in today's
opening round of the 1990 re
gional in Las Cruces, New
Mexico, the squad is determined
not to let the cruel winds of
America's Southwest affect its
performance.
Stanford qualified for postsea
son play by virtue of its stellar
showing throughout its season,
which was accentuated by cap
turing the team title in April's
Cardinal Invite. The squad will
vie this weekend with the 17
other top ranked teams in the
West for nine berths to the
NCAA Championship Tourney.
To finish in the top half of
this talent-laden field, the Car
dinal will need to capitalize on
the experience and maturity of
its players, as four seniors will
venture to Las Cruces. Sopho
more Christian Cevaer joins Don
Christiansen, Marc Funseth,
Brad Geer and Steve White in
an effort to assure Stanford of
its first appearance in the NCAA
Championship round since 1986.

"We've got as good a line-up
as we can send this weekend.
This team is prepared, and I feel
as good about our chances as I
have all year," Goodwin said.
Despite a disappointing outing
during last month's Pacific 10
Conference Championship, the
Cardinal appears to be peaking
just as its drive for a national
title begins. In a year with three
tournament victories, Goodwin
claimed that his squad has
played its finest golf in the last
weeks.
"I've never seen our team hit
the ball better or more aggres
sively than we have lately," said
the veteran coach. "It looks like
we've saved our best stuff for
when it counts."
For the team to demonstrate
its wide array of talents in this
weekend's three 18-hole rounds,
it must be able to overcome the
wind that proved so devastating
in 1989.
In its practice rounds for this
weekend's event, the team has
learned the lessons of El Paso
and has focussed on preparing
for the potentially blustery play
ing conditions at the New Mexico
State University Golf Course.
The squad has traveled
throughout the Bay Area in
search of wind-buffeted links in
an effort to acclimate itself to
driving and chipping in the
midst of a powerful zephyr.
"We're in much better shape
to face the wind this year," said
Goodwin, who designed the in
novative approach to preparing
for the winds of New Mexico.
