#THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

PALO ALTO, May 24, 2050 -
Wandering around the halls of the
Evergreen Home for Aged Cardi
nal, you can hear the whispers and
echoes of a glorious time long since
past. Stooped old men and women,
dressed in the red and white of
their alma mater, tell tales of a
different kind of Stanford student
— the kind that roamed Palo Alto
before the Great Quake of 2006
forever altered the Farm and its
inhabitants so many years ago.
Before the quake brought solem
nity to campus, Stanford students
lived a carefree life. They skipped
classes and went to the beach, they
weren't afraid to take over a build
ing if the need arose, and they
were brave enough to venture into
the boiling netherworld of
catacombs beneath the Farm: the
Stanford steam tunnels.
Since the tunnels were taken
over by a mutant league of teenage
rabid cats (the sole survivors of
the University's controversial cat
elimination plan of 1989), no
single human has ventured
beneath the earth — and come out
alive. But once there was a time
when a few intrepid humans would
explore the steamy depths, wary
only of an occasional rat or freely
floating asbestos fibers.
Steam tunnel spelunking was
certainly not for everyone; the dan
gers were very real. "Pete," an
80-year-old former Cardinal who
lives at the Home for the Aged,
was a legendary steam tunnel
spelunker in his day. On a recent
visit to the home, he told me about
his days of adventure. "Yep, I sup
pose tunnel spelunking was a
pretty hazardous way to pass the
time," he remembered.
"I guess our biggest fear was the
abundance of asbestos," he said,
coughing violently. "Every pipe

carried the warning: 'Danger, as
bestos fibers. Do not create dust.'
But that was a pretty damn hard
thing to do for someone jumping
seven or eight feet down through
a narrow brick pipe into the crum
bling tunnels," he added. "Oh, and
then there were the rats."
During the course of our lunch,
Pete's buddy "John" and one other
guy — we'll call him "Guy" —
joined us. Both John and Guy,
while not the tunnel regulars that
Pete once was — would occasion
ally join their friend on journeys
to the lower reaches of higher ed

ucation.
"It was a great place to hang out
late at night when you were in the
mood to inhale large quantities of
asbestos dust, crunch your 6-foot -
5-inch frame into a tunnel three
feet in diameter and stumble
through the empty cans and
bottles left by previous visitors,"
lohn noted.
"You always saw evidence of
other visitors, but it always seemed
so old — I never saw any recent
relics," Guy added. "Actually, I
never saw any other people down
there."

"I did once," Pete interjected. "I
thought they were cops, and it
freaked me out. It turned out they
were just fellow spelunkers."
But they never did get caught,
Pete added with a smirk on his
face. One time, when they were
emerging from a foray into the tun
nels with a couple of curious jour
nalists and a photographer, a
security vehicle drove by, he
remembered. "But I just shoved
John back down in the tunnel and
sat there twiddling my thumbs 'til
they went past."
The spelunkers could get just

about anywhere around the inner
Quad in the tunnels, Pete recalled.
"One time I went down near
Memorial Church, traveled
beneath the Quad and popped up
near two women who were sitting
and smoking on a bench. Surprised
the hell out of them."
The average steam tunnel was
about three or four feet high and
filled with heavily insulated pipes
to trip over and the occasional light
fixture to bump one's head on,
they said. Often, however, the tun
nels were pitch black and required
a flashlight — or excellent night

vision.
"Every so often you would come
to a big open space with generators
and wires hanging from the ceiling.
There your average 5-foot-3-inch
reporter or 5-foot-8-inch editor
could stand easily, but for big guys
like us, it was still a little tight."
If the manuscripts we've un
earthed from the apparently factual
annual Stanford tradition
"Gaieties" are to be believed, steam
tunnel spelunking was not just a
student pasttime. According to a
manuscript from November, 1989,
then-University President Donald
Kennedy was an avid spelunker
who spent many hours exploring
the underside of the University.
And legend has it that the a cap
pella group "Mixed Company"
even performed a concert in the
tunnels.
While steam tunnel spelunking
was an adventure, it was not with
out its perils. One time, Pete was
over near the Cardinal Cogenera
tion plant when they decided to
turn on the steam. "There was
always an occasional hot pipe, but
you just stayed away from those,"
he said. "But that time, they turned
on the steam, and it got really hot
down there. I turned around to
talk to someone and scalded
myself on a pipe," he told me,
showing off the scar he still carries
on his right arm.
"And what about the time I
forged ahead of you guys beneath
the English Department building?"
Guy added.
"Yeah, he went ahead to
reconoiter, and all of a sudden he
wasn't responding to our calls,"
John said. "Luckily, we had a fear
less reporter with us who went
ahead and rescued Guy from the
tunnei monsters, before he could
become 'one of them.' We thought
he was going to come back with
a rat in his teeth or something."
But did they ever venture into
the tunnels beneath White Plaza?
"Oh, I'd never do that," Pete ex
claimed. "That's where the Stench
emanated from." The Stench to
which Pete referred was an infa
mous odor that pervaded all cor

Damian Marhefka — Daily
ners of White Plaza at certain
times of the day and during certain
wind patterns in the last century.
A common theory in those days
was that the Stench was a result
of excess frozen yogurt dumped
into the gratings and left to rot,
but no one ever found out for sure.
The one explorer who dared to in
vestigate the situation died mo
ments after emerging from the
tunnels from acute olfactory
distress.
While Pete and his cohorts
would take the occasional unevent
ful foray into the Stanford steam
tunnels, students at other univer
sities were not always so fortunate.
At UCLA, a lesser-known Califor
nia university which no longer
exists, the penalty for a sojourn
to the steam tunnels was imme
diate expulsion.
Despite the danger, even at
UCLA, students risked their aca
demic careers for adventure; a
school yearbook from the 1980s
shows pictures of partying
spelunkers with black bars across
their eyes, concealing their iden
tities.
And at Stanford, for Pete, John
and Guy, the thrill of spelunking
outweighed the risks of danger.
