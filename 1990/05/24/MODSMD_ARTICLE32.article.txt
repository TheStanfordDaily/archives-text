# Madonna strikes a 'Vogue' pose
## Buy new album, listen and move your hands around your face

Madonna thrives on unpredict
ability.
Without it she would not have
survived the '80s to come out on
top in the '90s again. Her latest
album, "I'm Breathless: Music
From and Inspired By the Film
'Dick Tracy' " is a 180-dcgree turn
from anything she has ever done
before.
The compilation is a collection
of 19305-stylc big band numbers
and ballads, with only one dance
able track (the current number one
single, "Vogue"). While "I'm
Breathless" may alienate some of
Madonna's younger fans, it will
undoubtedly win over their par
ents. Madonna has taken a huge
risk by making an old-fashioned,
torchy record, but she pulls it off
almost flawlessly.
After the forgettable opening
tune, "He's A Man," the album
drifts into a lovely ballad, "Sooner
or Later." Stephen Sondheim, the
renowned Broadway musical com
poser, seems the most unlikely
candidate as Madonna's
songwriter. Yet his three contribu
tions to the album, including
"Sooner or Later," work in favor
of the songstress, whose voice on
this record is lower and sultrier
than on the bubble-gum hits of

yesteryear.
The album's strongest bid for a
classic is "Hanky Panky," a bluesy
ode to the pleasures of a little bit
of pain. Treat me like I'm a bad
girl/Even when I'm being good to
yon/I don't want you to thank
me/You can just . . . spank me It's
a naughty, raunchy and ultimately
delightful big-band number that
will have censors writhing.
Equally fun is "Now I'm Follow
ing You (Parts I and II)." The first
is a tunc in which Warren Beatty
accompanies Madonna in a soft
shoe duet. It promptly leads into
an electronic funk version of the
same song, remixed at a faster
tempo and set to a drum machine.
The version echoes Prince's "Bat
dance," only it's more coherent,
consistent, and racy ("Dick — now
that's an interesting name . . . my
bottom hurts just thinking about
it.").
"Back in Business," "I'm Going
Bananas" and "More" are all sur
prisingly potent ventures into ter
ritory Madonna has rarely
explored. The latter is Stephen
Sondheim's tap-dancer answer to
"Material Girl." "Back in Business"
is a finger-snapping scorcher that

best showcases Madonna's new,
improved voice. It's an aggressive
showstopper that caters to the
singer's strong-willed but sexy per
sona.
Most surprising is "I'm Going
Bananas," a Latin-flavored homage
to Carmen Miranda, where
Madonna proves she's as good with
accents as Meryl Streep She cat
calls and coos her way through the
mariachis and castanets, peppering
the song with a Spanish accent.
"I'm Breathless" has only two
weak spots. "Something to Re
member" is an uninspired ballad
of minor chords and corny lyrics.
"What Can You Lose" is a duet
with Mandy Patinkin, Broadway's
latest one-man-show darling. The
song is syrupy and unsatisfying,
and Madonna's voice clashes ter
ribly with Patinkin's.
As a whole, "I'm Breathless" will
leave you just that — it's a shock
ingly different picture of the ever
changing Madonna, in a medium
that is remarkably fitting. The Tin
Pan Alley flavor and the Cotton
Club rhythms never sound old
fashioned when matched with
Madonna's voice, yet they are
undeniably nostalgic. With this al
bum, Maaonna establishes herself
as one of the most versatile and
unpredictable performers of our
time.
