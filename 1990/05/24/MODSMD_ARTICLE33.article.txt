# Madonna leaves crowd breathless
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
Let there be no doubt, Madonna is pop culture —
pure and simple. And her "Blond Ambition Tour,"
currently writhing its way across the country, is the
crown jewel of her breatntaking career.
Last weekend, the high goddess of pop culture gave
the Bay Area three chances to see exactly what all
the ruckus is about. And she holds absolutely nothing
back during her dazzling 90-minute show of spectacle
and delight. Never afraid of controversy, the sights
and sounds of Madonna's show are as suggestive as
they are enjoyable.
With gears twirling mechanically in the back
ground, an elevator lifts her to the mammoth stage.
Six buff male dancers stroll around aimlessly, creating
an industrial slave feel as the music begins.
Madonna wears a head-set microphone, leaving

her free to dance as she begins the evening with an
awesome production of "Express Yourself "
But this is only the tip of the iceberg. What has
begun is not just a concert, it is part of pop history
in the making.
Every move Madonna makes in the next hour and
a half is carefully planned. Even her quips to the
audience are thought out well in advance, using the
phrase "Hey you, don't be silly, put a rubber on vour
willy" all three nights in Oakland.
Madonna's band, whose sound surpasses what is
heard on her albums, is pushed off to the sides,
giving her and her dancers free reign over the entire
stage. And once she takes the stage, she never gives
it up, except for brief dashes off staee to change into
the next revealing costume and to allow time for the
stage to mechanically alter itself into one of the three

different settings used for the
show.
Each number is a production in
itself. Most include the entourage
of slick male dancers and the two
wonderful female back-up singers
who dance it up with the best of
them.
After the first four songs,
Madonna leaves her dancers danc
ing to an extended beat of "Where's
The Party" as she exits for her
first costume change. She emerges
from a trapdoor in center stage
atop a red satin-covered bed to
deliver a slowed-down version of
"Like A Virgin." She is attended
to by two male dancers sporting
brassieres of their own.
She concludes the ballad in true
Madonna fashion — shocking
much of the audience and much
to the delight and cheers of the
rest. The platinum goddess allows

her attendants' hands to roam
freely across her well-toned body,
while hers make a brief venture
between her legs before she begins
a wild frenzy of grinding her hips
into a satin pillow and then hum
ping the bed itself.
Sated, she looks up to find her
self in a dark cathedral with giant
Roman columns, banks of burning
candles and a large hanging
crucifix. The stage is set for her
energetic production of "Like A
Prayer."
She again changes costumes,
only to return atop a grand piano
belting out "Sooner Or Later," a
ballad from her upcoming movie,
Dick Tracy. Staying with songs
from the "Breathless" album, she
delves into the delightfully naughty
"Hanky Panky" in a striking body
suit.
After taking a break to dance
with a Dick Tracy look-alike in a
bright yellow raincoat, the Material
Girl returns to the stage under a
hair dryer to deliver an entertaining
spoof of herself, singing "Material

Girl" with an obnoxious Long Is
land accent. She then takes a rest
to perform the wonderful no-frills
ballad "Cherish" along with three
merry mermen who slither their
way across the stage.
To top off the show, she begins
with the irresistible "Into The
Groove" and proceeds directly into
her current smash, "Vogue."
Nobody can Vogue like Madonna.
Her complete entourage takes the
stage and Vogues its way through
a wonderfully energetic and visual
production.
But the show is not over yet.
Madonna returns for two encores.
The first is "Holiday," for which
she wears a really funky black and
white outfit — the only one which
exposes her famed midriff. The
second is a grand production of
"Keep It Together."
After keeping it together for the
past hour and a half, Madonna
leaves the audience wanting more.
Through it all, the show is ambi
tious as it is spectacular — just
like Madonna herself.
