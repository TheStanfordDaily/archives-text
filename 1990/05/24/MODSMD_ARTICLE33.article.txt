Let there be no doubt, Madonna is pop culture â€”
pure and simple. And her "Blond Ambition Tour,"
currently writhing its way across the country, is the
crown jewel of her breatntaking career.
Last weekend, the high goddess of pop culture gave
the Bay Area three chances to see exactly what all
the ruckus is about. And she holds absolutely nothing
back during her dazzling 90-minute show of spectacle
and delight. Never afraid of controversy, the sights
and sounds of Madonna's show are as suggestive as
they are enjoyable.
With gears twirling mechanically in the back
ground, an elevator lifts her to the mammoth stage.
Six buff male dancers stroll around aimlessly, creating
an industrial slave feel as the music begins.
Madonna wears a head-set microphone, leaving

her free to dance as she begins the evening with an
awesome production of "Express Yourself "
But this is only the tip of the iceberg. What has
begun is not just a concert, it is part of pop history
in the making.
Every move Madonna makes in the next hour and
a half is carefully planned. Even her quips to the
audience are thought out well in advance, using the
phrase "Hey you, don't be silly, put a rubber on vour
willy" all three nights in Oakland.
Madonna's band, whose sound surpasses what is
heard on her albums, is pushed off to the sides,
giving her and her dancers free reign over the entire
stage. And once she takes the stage, she never gives
it up, except for brief dashes off staee to change into
the next revealing costume and to allow time for the
stage to mechanically alter itself into one of the three



One-name wondress Madonna demonstrates her new dance craze, "Vogue," which basically consists
of moving your hands around your face In a fashionable fashion.
