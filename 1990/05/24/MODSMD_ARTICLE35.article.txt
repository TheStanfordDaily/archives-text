## Ballet's concert promises mucho culture 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
If you want a taste of culture from
south of the border, there is no better
place to be than Dinkelspiel Auditorium
this Friday and Saturday night for El
Ballet Folklorico de Stanford's Sixth An
nual Concierto de la Primavera.
That's "spring concert" for those of
you who don't do Spanish.
El Ballet Folklorico de Stanford boasts
an entourage of 45 talented dancers who
perform traditional Mexican dances from
the regions of El Norteno, Nayarit,
Oaxaca (pronounced O-ha-ka), Colima
and others. Needless to say, they promise
to perform El Jarabe Tapatio, more com
monly known as the Mexican hat dance.
Hey, no show would be complete without
it.
Another easily recognizable dance to
be performed is the wonderful "Colima
Suite," complete with real machetes and
gorgeous costumes. During this portion
of the show, the group will be accom
panied by El Mariachi Azteca. You can't
get more authentic than this.
The students who comprise the group
come from all backgrounds. John
Moreno, a four-year veteran of the group
began his freshaman year because "a
friend asked me to join. I thought it
would be fun, and I could learn a little
about the culture." Although he had no
prior dance experience (he played football
in high school), Moreno has become a
real powerhouse dancer of Colima.
Another talented member of the group,
Angelita Valencia joined winter quarter
of her freshman year because she "loves
to dance." Whereas Moreno had no pre
vious dance experience, Valencia began

dancing as a child and has continued
performing these past three years with
the group. Like Moreno and Valencia,
most members of the group heard about
it through friends who encouraged them
to join.
The group began in 1972 when its
director and current chair of the dance
division at Stanford, Suzy Cashion, began
offering classes in traditional Mexican
dance. Since then, Cashion has had a
never-ending love affair with sharing
Mexican dance with the Stanford com
munity.
Though Cashion may be the soul of
the group, it is the students who com
prise it that give it life. It is they who
organize the annual spring concert, and
it is they who perform the dances for us
to enjoy. The phrase Ballet Folklorico
was coined in Mexico and refers to the
performance of traditional Mexican
dances. So, it is not like these dances
are the latest craze in dance clubs in
Mexico. I'm pretty sure they're "Vogu
ing" down there too.
Being a member of the group is not
all fun and games, however. It is actually
a class offered by the dance department.
The dancers practice at least six hours
a week (more before performances) and

The performance promises to include El farabe
Tapatio, more commonly known as the Mexican
hat dance. Hey, no show would be complete
without it.

earn two units of dance credit.
An introductory class is offered fall
and winter quarters for those interested
in joining the group. Each quarter, the
dancers learn two or three distinct styles
of dance. According to Valencia, the aan
cers "can learn a dance in about two
hours. Then it's just a matter of rehears
ing it 'til everyone gets it down."
Behind the scenes at their perform
ances, you often see dancers asking each
other about counts and which foot goes
where and other dancer things. It's
clearly a group effort.
Also scheduled to appear this weekend
is Jos6 Cuellar, more commonly known
as Dr. Loco and his Rockin' Jalapeno
Band. Cuellar is only one of a host of
outside artists contributing to the event,
including guest performer and choreog
rapher Marco Romero, former dancer
with El Ballet Folklorico de Mexico.
Romero will be dancing El Gustito with
Cashion. Its complexity is sure to dazzle
the audience.

Tickets are 53 for students, senior
citizens and children under 12 and $6
for general admission. They are available
at the door or may be reserved by calling
328-7024. Both shows start at 8 p.m.
