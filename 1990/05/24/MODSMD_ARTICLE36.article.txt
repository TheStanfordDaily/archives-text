# Stanford artists share Gallery spotlight

Works by five candidates for the master
of fine arts degree are currently in the
spotlight at the Stanford Art Gallery. For
painters Matthew Chansky, Richard
Payne, Francesca Sundsten and Dani
Tull and photographer Leslie Smith, the
exhibit represents the culmination of two
years of intensive study.
Chansky's bold abstract paintings fea
ture web-like, linear compositions
derived from geometric grids. Although
he sees the universal order of geometry
as his starting point, Chansky's art is
ultimately more intuitive than sys
tematic.
In his best works, "Kyrie" and "Con
futatis," Chansky forges a remarkable
pictorial tension by employing a narrow
range of hues and values to enforce unity
on an unruly jumble of lines and planes.
Each plan asserts its own individual char
acter while remaining tightly locked
within a larger compositional unity.
Payne paints the image of the crucified
Christ, surrounding the silhouetted fig
ure with the repeated lettering of the
"Jesus Prayer": "Lord Jesus Christ Son
Of God Have Mercy On Me." Payne's
faceless Christ is crudely drawn, and the

surrounding prayer is lettered in a graffiti
like scrawl.
This lack of sophistication is not cal
culated, but sincere, and underlines the
directness of these images by heightening
their hypnotic potential.
Smith presents a series of richly
textured black and white photographs
which document the themes of human
absence and abandonment. In many of
the photographs, Smith focuses on
human refuse or, more poignantly, the
disappearance of humans themselves.
One photograph features a rumpled
corduroy jacket discarded on the beach,
surrounded by disposable razors, a
toothbrush and a cigarette. Another pic
tures an abandoned campsite in Watson
ville, subtly reminding us of the effects
of the recent earthquake on the homeless.
Sundsten's polished, illusionistic
painting style intensifies the eenc impact
of her mysterious subject matter. A
preternatural stillness reigns in her
landscapes, which are frequently popu
lated by inscrutable figures engaged in
games or rituals whose purposes cannot
be determined.
Despite the mysterious incongruities
of her imagery, though, Sundsten cannot
be properly termed a surrealist, for she

insists that her subjects are not derived
from dreams and fantasies but from her
own experience and thus exist in the
realm of the possible.
The final room of the gallery is filled
by the work of Tull, perhaps the most
ambitious artist of the group. Eschewing
ordinary painting methods, Tull incor
porates a variety of media and found
objects into his intriguing tableaux, in
cluding light, sound and motion. His
work expresses a magical and alchemical
process and a mystical presence shar
pened by the shrine-like installation of
the room.
Tull's two most enormous paintings
loom on the far wall. "The Healing" is
a foreshortened bathtub, and
"Necropolis" presents the ominous
image of a tomb. Embedded in the dense
surfaces of these dark pictures are
shadowy, spectral faces which peer out
at us from mysterious depths. Tull con
fronts the viewer with death while hin
ting at ressurection, symbolized in many
of his paintings.

The Stanford Art Gallery, located near
Hoover Tower, is open Monday through
Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and
weekends from 1 to 5 p.m.
