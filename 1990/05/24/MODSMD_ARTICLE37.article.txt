# Good mood and great food

Yoshi is a petite woman — older, still
beautiful — with dark eyes and long,
ebony hair. "I am dancer. That's my
true love," she says in the soft accents
of the Japanese mainland. "That's why
I came to this country."
If she did not fulfill her dream of
becoming a prima ballerina, Yoshi saw
another, more distant dream come to
life in America. "When I was a girl in
Japan — 18, 19 years old — I used to
go visit many different nightclubs in
Tokyo. I wanted to have my own club."
Yoshi glances around the clean, well-lit
dining room and smiles. "It was a dream,
you know, I never imagined it as a
reality."
For over 20 years, Yoshi's of Oakland
has been a dream come true for jazz
enthusiasts and gourmands alike. Yoshi's
Nitespot offers the very best in live en
tertainment. "It's a great place to see
trios and soloists because of the intimacy
of the music room," says KJAZ DJ Greg
Bridges. "Yoshi's has very good sound."

As if the great jazz performers playing
the Nitespot aren't enough to draw a
crowd, Yoshi's reopened its dining room
on May 15, boasting a new look, a new
menu and a fantastic new chef.
Yoshi's California/Japanese Restau
rant, with its new Yakitori and Sushi
Bar, is definitely unique. And head chef
Koetsu Akasaka has added color and
style to the dining room menu.
Try the "duck breast in plum sauce."
The fowl is very mild — no hint of
"gamey" taste — and the sauce is bril
liant, light and delicious. The "grilled
trout stuffed with herbs" is also a treat.
"Yoshi's" boasts a full wine list and
an attractive array of desserts. Be sure
to try to sinfully rich "French vanilla
bean" ice cream as well as the luxurious
"chocolate cheesecake."

Yoshi's is located at 6030 Claremont Av
enue in Oakland.
