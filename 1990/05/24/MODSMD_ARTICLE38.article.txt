Cadillac Man
Robin Williams

of New York City, "Cadillac
Man" distinguishes itself from
the mass of those big-city stories
by quickly setting a tone of dark

"(Opportunity Knocks But Once)
Snatch and Grab It" saunters
along with its uplifting theme.
Meanwhile, a pan of the city
skyline lowers down to a slow
