## Purpose of Caddy: to woo women

From the opening scenes of
the new film "Cadillac Man," it
seems as though the movie en
sures quirkiness and comedy of
a dark nature.

of New York City, "Cadillac
Man" distinguishes itself from
the mass of those big-city stories
by quickly setting a tone of dark

irony. The old bluesy tune
"(Opportunity Knocks But Once)
Snatch and Grab It" saunters
along with its uplifting theme.

Car salesman Joey O'Brien (Robin Williams) and Joy Munchak (Fran Drescher) — one of
O'Brien's many girlfriends in "Cadillac Man" — are held at gunpoint for hours by another
dealership worker's jealous boyfriend.
crammed with tombstones. Next
to the graveyard is a funeral proces
sion of cars that has stopped in
its tracks because the hearse's en
gine has blown up.
Along comes this Good
Samaritan in a Caddie, helping the
complete strangers transfer the cof
fin to another car while also tem
porarily soothing flaring tempers.
What a nice guy. Then he tries to
sell a hearse to the funeral director
and a new car to the grieving
widow. What a sleaze.
It's this mixture of kindness and
scum which defines loey O'Brien
(Robin Williams), the womanizing
Cadillac salesman with a heart of
gold.
O'Brien is torn between a des
perate need to sell and a desperate
need to be with women. It is this
dual nature which is at the root
of Joey's problems, and boy does
he have a lot of problems: his
mistress Joy demands an emo
tional commitment, the ex-wife he
supports wants a devoted father
for their wild teenage daughter, his
girlfriend Tina is a vacuum for
Joey's money, he owes $20,000 to
the mafia.
To top it all off, he needs to sell
12 cars in one day or he loses his

job. In other words, Joey's in quite
a squeeze.
This is where the film takes a
very strange turn. A gun-toting
Larry (Tim Robbins of "Bull Dur
ham") crashes through the window
of the floor room, crazed with the
idea that one of the salesmen is
sleeping with his wife. Unless
someone confesses, everyone will
die. This is the moment in which
Joey has the chance to prove his
worth and give the sales pitch of
his life.
Like Joey O'Brien, this film has
a dual nature, torn between the
desire to be a dramatic comedy
and the desire to be an ac
tion/comedy. Frankly, the latter
half depicting the hostage scene is
far more enjoyable then the preced
ing 45 minutes detailing the life
of the salesman. This scene
definitely delivers the funniest,
wittiest moments and finally ful
fills the promise of the opening
sequence, although it is out of
place with the rest of the movie.
All in all, "Cadillac Man" is an
amalgam of incompatible ideas,
comic moments, eccentric charac
ters and a very dopey resolution
with his family. It is basically a
film which may be seen as only a
low-horse power vehicle in which
a restrained Robin Williams flexes
his character-acting skills.
