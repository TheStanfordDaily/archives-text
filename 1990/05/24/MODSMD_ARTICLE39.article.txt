There's nothing quite like a
healthy dose of sex-related contro

film eventually agreed to cut the
scandalous footage in exchange for
an "R"-rating, the publicity blitz

associated with the incident thrust
the content of what would other

film into the sensationalized
limelight of a national debate.

Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and
Her Lover," the new Mickey
Rourke vehicle "Wild Orchid," and
David Lynch's latest effort "Wild
at Heart."

Another of the most recent films
to embroil itself in sexual scandal
is "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!"
Written and directed by the
talented Spanish filmaker Pedro

of a Nervous Breakdown"), "Tie
Me Up! Tie Me Down!" garnered
an "X"- rating for its rather explicit
