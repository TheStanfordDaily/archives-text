# Sex & Movies tied together
## 
### Kelly Parsons Staff writer 
There's nothing quite like a
healthy dose of sex-related contro
versy to stir up public interest in
a movie.
In 1987, for example, the film
"Angel Heart" attracted nationwide
attention when a steamy love
scene between screen bad boy
Mickey Rourke and Cosby kid Lisa
Bonet earned the movie an "X"-
rating.
Although the producers of the
film eventually agreed to cut the
scandalous footage in exchange for
an "R"-rating, the publicity blitz

oTie Me Up, Tie Me Down
Victoria Abril

associated with the incident thrust
the content of what would other
wise have been a rather obscure
film into the sensationalized
limelight of a national debate.
Since then, many other films
have generated similar controversy,
including the "X"-rated "The
Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and
Her Lover," the new Mickey
Rourke vehicle "Wild Orchid," and
David Lynch's latest effort "Wild
at Heart."

Another of the most recent films
to embroil itself in sexual scandal
is "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!"
Written and directed by the
talented Spanish filmaker Pedro
Almodovar ("Women on the Verge
of a Nervous Breakdown"), "Tie
Me Up! Tie Me Down!" garnered
an "X"- rating for its rather explicit
sexual content. Almodovar, un
willing to edit any of his material,
opted to release the film as un
rated.
Yet all the debate that has sur
rounded "Tie Me Up! Tie Me
Down!" in recent weeks obscures
the fact that this movie is a wry,
extremely witty and enormously
entertaining loqk at love, sex and
marriage.
The film relates the adventures
of a young man named Ricky
(Antonio Banderas) who, after
being released from the psychiatric
ward that has served as his home
for most of his life, decides to settle
down and get married.
Ricky cnoses for his bride
Marina (Victoria Abril), a porn star
turned B-movie actress with whom
he spent a wildly amorous night
during an escape from the institu
tion. Unfortunately, however,
Marina does not remember him.
In an effort to win her love, Ricky
kidnaps her, vowing to hold her
prisoner until she agrees to marry
him.
The story, as a whole, was rather
predictable. In addition, Al
modovar leaves a major subplot
concerning an elderly movie direc
tor completely unresolved. Yet, the
film's strong script and excellent
cast more than make up for these
deficiencies.
Almodovar's insightful dialogue
is laced with biting, sardonic lines
that provide a uniquely humorous
perspective on the nature of rela

tionships and of modern society
in general. By the end, one is left
wondering who is truly "crazy":
Ricky, or the people around him
who profess to be "normal."
Similarly, Almodovar demon
strates a masterful sense of comic
timing, underscored by the story's
quick, yet never rushed, pace. "Tie
Me Up! Tie Me Down!" is a finely
crafted movie, a comedy that
lightly jabs at, without passing
judgement on, human nature.
More than being a good film,
however, "Tie Me Up! Tie Me
Down!" also reveals the inade
quacies of the Motion Picture As
sociation of America's current
system of ratings.
Already under fire for this very
reason, the M.P.A.A. has recently
considered adding a new category
to its ratings system: "A" for
"Adult." "A" would cover those
adult films whose serious,
culturally- minded themes distin
guish them from exploitative
pornography. Like "X"-rated films,
"A" films would admit no one un
der the age of 18.
One can only hope that, in a
moviegoing atmosphere thick with
glitzy star vehicles, vapid sequels
and uninspired, heavily commer
cialized blockbusters, the M.P.A.A.
will modify its system to reflect
the growing creative importance of
these films.
