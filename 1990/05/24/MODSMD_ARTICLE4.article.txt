# Speakers detail violence againt women in U.S.
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
At least 2,000,000 women are beaten each
year in the United States by their husbands
or boyfriends, and about one-third of all female
homicide victims die at the mercy of their
husbands or boyfriends.
These and other statistics were highlighted
last night in a presentation sponsored by the
American Studies theme house titled "Battered
Women, Battered Lives," held in the History
corner.
After viewing the film "Two Million Wom
en," the 30-member audience listened to
speakers from the Mid-Peninsula Support Net
work for Battered Women and Next Door, a
domestic violence shelter and counseling center
in San Jose.
"Battery is the cause of iryury to
women in the United States," said Lin White
of the Mid-Peninsula Support Network. Bat
tery results in more injuries requiring medical
treatment than rapes, car accidents and mug
gings combined.
White said physical violence "is only the tip
of the iceberg." Verbal, emotional, mental and
financial abuse are types of battery that "no
one sees," she added.
Both White and Chase outlined three stages
of domestic violence: tension-building or denial,
actual abuse and the "honeymoon period" in
which the husband promises not
to continue abusing his wife.
"Battery knows no economic,
cultural or racial barriers; it af
fects everyone," said Sydney
Chase, a counselor from Next
Door.
Chase is living proof that bat
tery does not restrict itself to poor
minority women. Coming from "a
solid background" and a good ed
ucation, Chase said her husband
once beat her to the point that
she had two holes in her tongue,
required eight root canals and had
the right side of her face sit an
inch lower than the left for one
year.
"I didn't come out of shock and
terror for six months," Chase
said.

Chase said one reason abusers
go unpunished is due to the "old
boy network among men." White
pointed out that the top three
professions of male abusers are
doctors, members of military serv
ice and policemen, traditionally
well-respected and high-authority
positions.
After seeing three doctors after
her assault, Chase said, "not one
of them gave me a hotline number
or the name of a shelter" or sug
gested she have her husband ar
rested.
She added, "A hundred years
ago, a man wasn't a man unless
he beat his wife twice a week.
Only now we're beginning to say
'Stop,' 'No,' 'This is wrong.' "
Chase said domestic violence is
a learned behavior that can be
"unlearned" through counseling
and support groups for both men
and women.
