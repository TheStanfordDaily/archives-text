# Hawn, Gibson go out on a wire
## 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
With the release of "Bird on a
Wire," Hollywood demonstrates
that it can keep relying upon stand
ard formulas for movie after movie
and, in the process, become quite
good at making them.
Starring Mel Gibson ("Lethal
Weapon," "Gallipoli") and Goldie
Hawn ("Foul Play," "Wildcats"),
"Bird on a Wire" does not break
any new ground; however, it main
tains its predictable ac
tion/comedy/love story formula in
an enjoyable way.
The movie revolves around
Mel's character Rick Jarmin, who
once testified against some evil
drug dealing bad guys back in his
rowdy '70s college days. Jarmin,
under the FBI witness protection
program, disappeared from his old
life and shifts identities periodi
cally to stay away from a corrupt
DEA official, played by David Car

radine (a lot fatter since his "Rung
Fu" days), who wants revenge.
Coincidentally, Jarmin runs into
the college girlfriend, played by
Goldie Hawn, he left when he first
had to change lives.
Goldie is now a high-powered
New York businesswoman who
has changed considerably from the
ideological, pot-filled days when
she shared a college romance with
Mel. Still, she inadvertently helps
him, and they try to escape the
killers together.
Amid various humorous clashes
between their personalities, they
experience rousing action and ad
venture as they travel together and
remember the old days, with nu
merous attempts to revive their
love affair.
By the way, this movie compen

sates for the exploitative overabun
dance of female breasts in most
movies by establishing a parity of
posteriors — that's right, both Mel
and Goldie expose their fannies.
If that isn't enough to give this
movie an academy award, then it
probably won't get one. Besides,
there's a rumor circulating that it's
not even Mel's behind.
Anyway, the typical portrayal in
this movie of the criminals as in
herently dim-witted is annoying,
as is the inability of any bad guy
wielding an automatic weapon to
hit anything other than the dirt
around a hero's or heroine's feet.
Overall, the action scenes and
the acting in this film are good,
and it's pretty funny. If you can
put up with the idea of not seeing
anything captivating (other than
what may be Mel's behind) and
just watching the movie for fun,
you'll probably have a good time.
