## Van's compilation needs no Morrison 
### Ari Richter Staff writer 
It was 1966 when the Irish group
Them recorded "G-l-o-r-i-a," intro
ducing the world to the singing
and songwriting talents of Van
Morrison. One year later, Morrison
went solo, releasing perhaps his
most famous song "Brown Eyed
Girl."
Now, some 23 years later, Mor
rison is finally pausing to catch
his breath.
For over two decades, Van Mor
rison has consistently proven him
self to be one of the greatest
songwriters of the rock era. Musi
cally, as well as lyrically, songs
ranging from 1970's "Moondance,"
to 1989's "Whenever God Shines
His Light," have revealed Mor
rison's gifts. The new collection
"The Best Of Van Morrison" pro
vides a 20-song look back at his
incredible career.
Compilation albums are curious
beasts. Even if all the songs in the
collection are really good, there are
always personal favorites which get
left out. But is it fair to attack an
album for what it doesn't contain?
If so, "The Best Of Van Mor
rison" may disappoint some of its
listeners. Sure, all of the aforemen
tioned classics are included, but
what about such equally-deserving

songs as "Tupelo Honey," "Blue
Money" and "Caravan"?
In all fairness, Morrison — like
so many other artists these days
— would have had to go the route
of the boxed set in order to do
justice to his career. As it stands,
"The Best of Van Morrison" only
fills one compact disc. But listen
ing to its 76 minutes' worth of
music, you begin to forget all those
songs that might also have been
included.
In fact, as you listen to the col
lection a few more times, you find
there's really nothing to complain
about. Songs like "And It Stoned
Me" and "Domino" were both
quite popular and are included.
And songs such as "Dweller On
The Threshold," "Wonderful
Remark" and "Sweet Thing" may
not be as familiar as the bigger
hits, but these are top-quality
songs.
Here's one final thing to consider
about "The Best Of Van Morrison."
If the only problem with an album
is what didn't get included, such
a complaint is roughly equivalent
to bemoaning a baseball team's
lack of a good third-string catcher.
