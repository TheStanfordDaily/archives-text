# World Party worldly, but not all that fun
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Perhaps the most overlooked al
bum of 1986 was World Party's
"Private Revolution," which com
bined the heightened social con
sciousness of the 1960s with the
diversified popular sound of the
1980s. The album proved to be a
one-man tour de force for former
Waterboy Karl Wallinger, who
brought together several of his
friends to play on the album.
Now that the 1990s are here,
Wallinger has assembled a second
showpiece that has been anything
but overlooked. Two singles have
already been released, several crit
ics have praised the album, and
Wallinger has found his profile in
several national magazines.
Unfortunately, the critics have
joined the wrong bandwagon.
While "Goodbye Jumbo"
deserves ample applause for its
message of social and environmen
tal awareness, the album suffers
musically from a one-dimensional
approach lacking the rich texture
of "Private Revolution."
That may be an exaggeration,
but the album did not meet the
expectations created by the in
spired performance on the debut
album. Ironically, reviews of
"Private Revolution" primarily crit
icized the one song that sounds

most like the new album.
Wallinger shines on well
rounded releases like "Way Down
Now" and "Put the Message in the
Box," a cleverly described method
of increasing social awareness: Put
the message in the box /Put the
box into the car/Drive the car
around the world / Until you get
heard.
A modern-day Dylan, Wal
linger's car is fueled by poignant
lyrics that serve as vivid social
commentary. In the album's
opening song, "Is It Too Late?",
Wallinger mixes concerns about
the neglected environment, the kil
ling of elephants for ivory, and so
cial apathy in only one verse: In
a dream I was crossing African
plain s / A n elephant's
graveyard/A bone dry place/And
I was wondering why there was
no more rain/And in a pile of
bones I saw your face.
Wallinger has put his strong
message in two albums, the most
recent of which will definitely be
heard. And if the world goes ac
cording to Wallinger's plan, people
in the 1990s may hold a great
resemblance to those in the 19605.
