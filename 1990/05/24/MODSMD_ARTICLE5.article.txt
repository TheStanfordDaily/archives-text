# Mendoza to head Chicano Research
## New director is expert on health status of children 
### Michael Canul 
Long concerned with the
growth and development of
Mexican-American and Latino
children, Fernando Mendoza has
been named director of the Stan
ford Center for Chicano Research.
Mendoza, assistant professor of
pediatrics at the School of Medi
cine, currently teaches and prac
tices at Stanford Children's
Hospital and has been associated
with the center as an associate
researcher since 1983.
An expert on the health and
nutritional status of Mexican-
American children, Mendoza
believes that "a new approach is
needed in dealing with the health
problems that face Mexican-
Americans."
"Teenage pregnancy, substance
abuse, low birth weight, high in
fant mortality and a poor health
care system all require a multi
disciplinary approach," he said.
Mendoza is especially concerned
about the relationship between
economics and health care.
"I believe that poverty deter
mines one's health," Mendoza
said. "My challenge is to provide
a more accurate view of the issues
that are involved . . . with re
search in health, as well as in
education, sociology, anthropol
ogy, psychology, as well as health.
We have to understand all the
factors involved."
Raised in the Willow Glen area

of San Jose, Mendoza remembers
that his interest in childhood de
velopment came at an early age.
"When I was in high school, I
had already decided that I wanted
to be a pediatrician," he said. "I
wanted to provide for others be
cause I recognized the poor
quality of health care that many
people were receiving."
After graduating from San Jose
State University, Mendoza ob
tained his medical degree from
Stanford Medical School in 1975.
He then completed a three-year
pediatrics residence and went on
to obtain a masters degree in
Public Health at Harvard.
In 1981, he was appointed to
the faculty and since then has
worked on many issues, including
launching the first in-depth,
nationwide study of the health
status of Mexican-American
children with colleagues Reynaldo
Martorell and Ricardo Castillo.
"I'm concerned about the
children and the adolescents,"
Mendoza said. "Forty-five percent
of all Mexican-Americans and
Puerto Ricans are 18 and under,
and most of these people live in
poverty levels two to three times
the national average. .. . We need
to bring out the reality of what's
happening."
Mendoza looks forward to col
laborative work with researchers
in many fields to investigate the
issues involved.
"Multiculturalism is another

area for the Chicano Research
Center to look into," he added.
"We're moving toward a multicul
tural society, and we need to ask
ourselves what multiculturalism
really is and how we can change
institutions to fit into the multi
cultural concept."
Mendoza said he is optimistic
about the future of Chicanos in
the United States. "Things are
changing, and Chicanos are mov
ing up. Massive demographic
changes are occurring, and the
problems we need to overcome are
education and poverty."
Mendoza will begin his new po
sition in September 1990.
