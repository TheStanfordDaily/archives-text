In a significant step toward treatment of
multiple sclerosis, a team of Stanford and
Australian researchers have identified the spe
cific immune system cells involved in the dis
ease.
By determining the exact immune response
cells which attack the brain of individuals with
multiple sclerosis, scientists can now work
toward developing an antibody for the cells,
to deactivate them and prevent them from
eliciting harmful effects.
This discovery, which appears in today's
issue of Nature magazine, was made by Dr.
Lawrence Steinman, associate professor of
neurology and genetics, and his colleagues,
when examining the brains of three patients
who had died of multiple sclerosis.
The researchers identified specific immune
response cells, known as T cells, in affected
areas of the patients' brains, which were absent
in healthy individuals.
The researchers pointed out, however, that
it will be several years before any treatment
is approved for use in humans.
The body contains many different types of
T cells, which prevent infection by attacking
foreign particles such as bacteria or viruses.
Multiple sclerosis is believed to be caused
by T cells which are misdirected into launching
a self-destructive attack on the cells of an
individual's brain and spinal cord.
According to Stanford's Dr. Jorge Oksenberg,
the scientists have "known all along that there
were T cells involved" in the immune system
response which characterizes multiple
sclerosis; however, the utilization of a tech
nique developed by Cetus Corp. of Emeryville,
Calif, allowed the researchers to identify, for
the first time, the exact T cell receptors.
By determining the exact T cells involved,
scientists hope to now develop an antibody
which will bind to these cells, inactivating
them and preventing them from impairing the
brain. Such an antibody would be integral to
an effective treatment of the disease.
Steinman and his colleagues have already
been working for several years on the devel
opment of a treatment for multiple sclerosis.
But all of the group's efforts to date have
been broad approaches, employing antibodies
which impair all the body's T cells, and thus
the entire immune system, in order to avoid
harmful impacts on the brain.
Now, with the discovery of the specific T
cells, the researchers can develop a more spe
cific treatment inducing less immune system
impairment.
