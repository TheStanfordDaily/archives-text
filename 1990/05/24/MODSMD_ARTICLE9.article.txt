In an effort to "highlight mul
ticultural issues" at Stanford,
Law Prof. Charles Lawrence and
Linda Chavez, former deputy as
sistant to President Reagan, last
night debated the benefits of af
firmative action versus a system
of individual merit.
Arguing in defense of affirma
tive action, Lawrence raised what
he called, "the four flagrant fal
sehoods" of affirmative action op
ponents: that racism doesn't exist,
that affirmative action has stig
matized minorities, that affirma
tive action does not work and that
affirmative action is anti-merit.
Chavez warned that "preferen
tial affirmative action" hurts mi
nority students. She quoted
Martin Luther King Jr., who ex
plained that in a truly equal so

ciety, "one is not judged by the
color of skin, but by a judgment
of character."
In response, Lawrence said
Chavez assumes that "the sys
tems that exist now do exist based
on merit." Lawrence cited schools
giving preference to children of
alumni and donors, and, jokingly,
the vice-presidency of Dan Quayle
as possible examples of a different
system of preference. He said, "af
firmative action exists as an an
tidote to this common
preference."
Lawrence and Chavez both
agreed that efforts need to be
made to provide continual support
to members of minority groups.
Chavez explained that affirmative
action should be replaced with a
program aimed at supporting mi
nority education through the col
lege years. Lawrence agreed

stating that "it is not enough to
just admit students [into colleges!
without doing anything for them
while they are there."
Viewing affirmative action from
an educational standpoint, the
two debaters differed on the fu
ture of the issue. Chavez ex
pressed that "first and foremost,"
education allows people to
succeed. She stated that opportu
nities should became available
"the old-fashioned way, by em
phasizing education, so that the
people can compete on their own
merit."
Lawrence responded stating,
"one thing I am certainly not in
favor of is the old-fashioned way.
. . . We do not want to go back to
the 'old fashioned way' but for
ward to a true multicultural in
stitution."
