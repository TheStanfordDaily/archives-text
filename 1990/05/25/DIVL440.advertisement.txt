THE LUCK
OF THE

A dead spot out in the wilds
Magma still seething with fury
All the power in the world

Rings and initials multiply
Equality opposes blind opportunism
Ultimately the planet will die
The contents of the dome kept hidden
Red, yellow, blue, grey and white
Three shots fired back and forth
A piece of peach around the light
