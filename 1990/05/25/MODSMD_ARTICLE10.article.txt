# Fac Sen passes measures to attract researchers
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Despite protests against lessen
ing the distinction between the
tenure and non-tenure-line
professoriate, the Faculty Senate
yesterday approved six measures
intended to attract qualified re
searchers to Stanford.
In a meeting that began late
and ended early due to difficulties
in reaching a quorum, the senate
continued its discussion of the
long list of recommendations pro
posed to it by the Committee on
the Professoriate more than a
month ago.
One of the more controversial
proposals to pass, which calls for
similar everyday reference to ten
ure and non-tenure-line faculty,
is intended to make non-tenure
line faculty feel less like second
class citizens, according to the
committee.

Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Charles Kruger, a committee
member, said the second-class
treatment of non-tenure-line
faculty causes recruiting prob
lems.
However, several faculty mem
bers raised objections to the pro
posal.
"If the distinctions Ibetween
tenure and non-tenure faculty]
are unimportant then we should
abolish them," said Gary
Feldman, a professor at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center.
But "truth in advertising requires
that we don't suppress distinc
tions we consider important."
Biological Sciences Prof.
Patricia Jones also argued it was
important for people outside the
University to have a clear under
standing of a person's function.
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman
feared the proposals "keep blur
ring the line" between tenure and
non-tenure faculty. He said he

wanted to keep the distinction
that exists between them.
Despite these objections, Mate
rials Science Prof. David Steven
son argued that to vote against
the resolution was an "unneces
sary chop against those who make
an important contribution to the
University."
The senate also passed another
controversial recommendation, a
proposal to create the position of
senior fellow at policy centers.
Senior fellows will be eligible to
direct their own research projects.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley said the qualifications for
senior fellow were so broad nearly
anyone could meet the qualifica
tions.
Kruger countered that the post
of senior fellow would be held by
notable, highly qualified people
such as former Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol researcher Sally Ride, "not

any old former astronaut."
In other business, University
President Donald Kennedy re
ported to the senate on Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's
upcoming visit.
Gorbachev is expected to give a
speech in Memorial Auditorium,
as well as meet in a smaller group
with faculty members and ad
vanced students in academic areas
in which the Soviets express in
terest.
Kennedy stressed that plans
will not be finalized until shortly
before Gorbachev arrives. "I ex
pect it to be a scramble," he said.
Kennedy also responded to a
question on The Daily's current
coverage of the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle.
Kennedy said it was not uncom
mon for young people to have
"temporary" interest in radical
political movements, and added it
was "important to put this in per
spective."
