# Skip Hoover, Manley writes to Gorbachev
## 
### Daryl Joseffer 
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, a longtime Hoover In
stitution critic, has written a
letter to Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev urging him not
to visit Hoover during his
planned trip to Stanford.
In the letter, Manley tells
Gorbachev the "Institution .. .
is using your visit to Stanford
to discredit socialism, and to
make it appear that, with
socialism's failure, you are
coming to them for advice."
Government officials have
reported that Gorbachev's in
terest in Hoover's scholarship
and archives helped lure him
to Stanford.
Although Manley told The
Daily he is "the last one to
opine upon what might be
going on in Gorbachev's mind,"
he said Gorbachev "is not com
ing hat in hand for advice from
Hoover."
Manley said, "The unseemly
public relations blitz Hoover
launched last week" prompted
him to write to Gorbachev. Vir
tually every paper in the
country has reported on Hoo
ver's archives and scholars
since Gorbachev's June 4 visit
was announced last week.
Manley said Hoover has
"blurred the distinction be

tween the archives and the po
litical arm" of the institution.
He said he hopes his letter will
persuade Gorbachev to avoid
even the Hoover archives, since
"Hoover will use this to refur
bish their image and really to
laugh at him and at socialism."
Hoover's archives contain
what is widely regarded as the
best collection of Russian doc
uments outside the Soviet
Union.
Hoover fellows and adminis
trators showed little concern
about Manley's letter. Senior
research fellow Charles Hill
labeled it "silly" and added,
"The whole issue ... is trivial."
English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, who has worked with
Manley in the past to urge the
University to sever all ties with
Hoover, said he hopes Gorba
chev takes Manley's letter
seriously and "doesn't honor"
Hoover with a visit. Rebholz
added that Gorbachev's
planned visit to Hoover "cer
tainly will be sad for [Gorbac
hev] and everything he's trying
to achieve."
Manley sent the letter on
Monday to the Kremlin, the
Soviet Embassy in Washington,
D.C., the Soviet Consulate in
San Francisco and several
major newspapers.
University officials were un
available for comment.
