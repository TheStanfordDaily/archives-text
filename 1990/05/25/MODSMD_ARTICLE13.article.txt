Bombings continue in Medellin
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A car bomb
exploded yesterday at a police post near a
luxury hotel in the cocaine capital of Medellin,
killing at least four people, a city spokesman
said.
The blast occurred less than a block from
the Intercontinental Hotel. It damaged nearby
buildings and destroyed several cars, said Cesar
Perez, press spokesman for Mayor Juan
Gomez.
The Colombian radio network RCN, quoting
unnamed policemen at the scene, said the bomb
killed five people and injured 15.
It was the sixth powerful bomb to go off in
Colombia the last two weeks. The other five
blasts killed 28 and injured about 300.
Meanwhile, a police officer was shot to death
in Medellin outside of a local office of the
ruling Liberal Party. His death brought to 34
the number of policemen killed in Medellin
the last 15 days.
The Medellin drug cartel has offered to pay
$4,300 for each policeman killed as part of
their campaign of violence.
Rebels rebuffed in Liberia
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — President
Samuel Doe claimed his forces had recaptured
a strategic port from rebel forces yesterday, a
Liberian radio station said.
If the claim is true, the government has
quickly reversed a setback earlier this
week when the rebels took Buchanan, the
country's main port for iron ore.
ELWA radio, a missionary station monitored
in Abidjan, said the government victory was
initially announced by the Liberian Ministry
of Information.
No independent confirmation of the govern
ment claim was immediately available. The
government said nothing about casualties in
the latest fighting. Rebels of the National
Patriotic Front, led by former Doe aide Charles
Taylor, invaded Liberia from its northeastern
border with Ivory Coast on Dec. 24.
Japan apologizes to Korea
TOKYO (AP) — In Japan's clearest effort
to deal with its militaristic past, Emperor
Akihito and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on
yesterday acknowledged the suffering Japa
nese colonial rule inflicted on Koreans.
Akihito, in a carefully worded statement,
expressed "deepest regret" for the pain Japa
nese rule has caused Koreans, but he did not
explicitly apologize, which many South
Koreans had demanded.
Kaifu, however, expressed "sincere remorse
and honest apologies" for Japanese actions
that "inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow
on the people of the Korean peninsula."
Walesa criticized for ad
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Lech Walesa says
he never thought that agreeing to do an ad
vertisement supporting the U.S. Bill of Rights
would be seen as an endorsement of cigarette
smoking — a habit he kicked cold turkey years
ago.
