WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) — A strike
by Canadian truck drivers over pro
posed tax increases and the U.S.-
Canadian free-trade agreement began
disrupting production at auto plants
in both nations as it entered its third
day yesterday.
The protest choked off shipments of
parts to the General Motors of Canada
Ltd. assembly plant in Ste. Therese,
Quebec, where 3,000 workers worked
half a shift before being sent home
Wednesday.
Half-shifts were planned at the plant
again today. GM also sent home 11,000
day-shift workers at three plants in
Oshawa, Ontario, because of a lack of
parts, spokesman Nick Hall said.
Production also was disrupted at
plants run by Chrysler Canada and
Ford of Canada.
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co., Chrysler Corp. and Honda of
America Manufacturing Inc. said pro
duction at their U.S. plants could be
curtailed if the protest continued much
longer.
At Fort Erie, Ontario, near Niagara
Falls, about 130 trucks jammed the
approaches to the international Peace
Bridge today as the protest spread to
New York state's borders.
The truckers blocked all commercial
lanes of the bridge linking Fort Erie
and Buffalo, N.Y., to protest the free
trade agreement with the United
States and the goods and services tax
that the Canadian government plans
to impose next year.
Canadian Transport Minister Doug
Lewis planned to fly from Ottawa to
Windsor yesterdy to meet with protest
leaders. Some American truckers have
joined the protest, either in sympathy
with the Canadians or because of
grievances of their own.
More than 300 truckers parked their

rigs Wednesday along more than three
miles of the highway leading to the
Ambassador Bridge between Windsor
and Detroit. They remained there this
morning, parked in a line that led all
the way to customs brokerage offices,
blocking only the truck lanes.
There also were about two dozen

rigs on the bridge blocking truck traf
fic entering Windsor from Detroit.
Hundreds more truckers blocked
traffic on the Blue Water Bridge be
tween Sarnia, Ontario, and Port
Huron, Mich., according to Oscar Vaz
quez, bridge safety officer for the U.S.
Department of Transportation.

Quebec truck drivers on Wednesday
partially lifted a blockade that began
Monday, but they continued to prevent
U.S. trucks from leaving or entering
the province.
Authorities at the bridges described
the protests as peaceful and said cars
were crossing without delays.
