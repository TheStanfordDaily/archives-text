Colt responds to ban
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The
president of Colt's Manufacturing Co.
assailed a Senate vote Wednesday to
outlaw some assault weapons as a
"sad and dishonest effort" to make
voters think lawmakers are fighting
crime.
The restrictions, which await final
Senate action, would bar the import
of five foreign-made assault weapons
and outlaw U.S. manufacture of four
others.
The Bush administration opposes
the restrictions.
"It is a sad and dishonest effort
to make the public think the politi
cians are actually doing something
about crime," said Richard F. Gam

ble, president of Colt's Manufactur
ing.
"In fact, rifles of any description
are almost never used in crimes and
semiautomatic so-called 'assault
rifles' have been used in less than
three-hundredths of 1 percent of all
crimes where a gun was involved,"
Gamble said.
Environmentalists bombed

ing organize a campaign to halt log

ging in Northern California's old
growth forests and other environ
mental activities.
The explosion occurred shortly
before noon near Oakland High
School, said a garage worker who
identified himself only as Charles.
Authorities declined to identify the
victims, but Earth First! spokesman
Daniel Barron said they were group
members Judi Bari, 40, a passenger
in the white Subaru station wagon
registered in her name, and driver
Darryl Cherney, 30, both of Ukiah.

8 premiere.
