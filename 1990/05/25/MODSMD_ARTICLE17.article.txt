## A 						constructive visit 
### 
WE ARE EXTREMELY
honored and excited that
Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev is visiting campus.
His historic visit offers a unique
opportunity for the Stanford com
munity to learn from, and see up
close, the man Time magazine se
lected as "Man of the Decade."
This visit is obviously taking
place at a propitious moment in
history. Given the revolutionary
changes sweeping his country at
this time, Gorbachev is venturing
into unchartered waters and could
perhaps learn something himself
during the visit.
To accomplish a mutual learning
exchange, we are heartened to hear
that Gorbachev has decided to give
a public address. This will provide
an opportunity for the maximum
number of students to be exposed
to the ideas and presence of this
significant figure.
If the security provisions can be
worked out, we would hope that

he could deliver his address in a
larger facility than Memorial Au
ditorium, which only holds 1,700
people. If not, the University needs
to ensure that the selection process
for both the speech and the sem
inar are based on some fair and
understandable criteria.
During Gorbachev's short visit
here, we should try to offer the
best of the University as a contri
bution to cross-cultural communi
cation and education.
That means we should convey
Stanford's commitment to multi
culturalism and the power of stu
dents in American universities to
carry out our goals and make our
visions a reality.
Today's generation of students
represents tomorrow's leaders, and
if we can foster mutual under
standing and respect now, we can
make even greater progress toward
global cooperation and progress in
the future.
