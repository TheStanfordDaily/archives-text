# Breaking ground
## 
### 
AT LAST, GROUND is going
to be broken for Kimball
Hall. The construction of the
new dormitory will bring us one
step closer to the promised land
of four years of guaranteed
housing.
After more than 20 years of
"temporary" housing, the trailers
in Manzanita Park will soon be
disappearing. The length of time
it has taken to get rid of the trailers
is a sad commentary on the pace
of change at Stanford.
Now, we need to put behind us
any disgruntled feelings and work
to make the transition to Kimball
as smooth as possible.
Those of us who have not had
to endure life in the trailers should
be sensitive and understanding to

those who did live there. Not only
did they get the short end of the
housing stick, but those who
remain (only one-third of the
trailers will disappear) will have
to put up with noisy and disruptive
construction.
Residents of Branner Hall and
Toyon Hall may also experience
some discomfort, but that is a
small price to pay for a permanent
improvement in the campus envi
ronment.
The lesson of the Kimball con
struction is a testament to the ef
ficacy of the system. It shows that
when students are persistent in of
fering their input, the system can
respond and act on those desires.
We hope to see this form of
cooperation continuing in the fu
ture.
