Those hurt by articles contributed much to Stanford

RICHARD SUH SAYS, in the May
23 Daily, that League of Revolu
tionary Struggle members "are
leading progressive politics on campus
. . . because they are the best and the
hardest workers." He and others "who
asked not to be identified" then
"charge" that Elsa Tsutaoka, Stacey
Leyton, David Brown, Gina Hernandez,
Steven Phillips and Ingrid Nava are
members of this League (presumably
because they are some of the best and
hardest workers on campus).
All six deny being members of such
a group, which the author then uses to
imply that they must in fact be mem
bers, since the organization is suppos
edly secretive.
The absurdity of such reasoning is
apparent, but what concerns us is that
irresponsible charges that have serious
and detrimental implications for indi
viduals' lives are being published on
the basis of rumor and innuendo.
Those "accused" by this article deserve
our respect and support because of
their being the "best and hardest
workers."

The "infiltration" of Stanford by
these six hard workers has given us
the leaders of Stanford's anti-Apartheid
and pro-CIV movements, the coordina
tor of the 1987 You Can Make A
Difference Conference, three student
body presidents, a Phi Beta Kappa in
history, fighters for the expansion of
the Asian American Activities Center
and El Centro Chicano, key volunteers
and speakers on the 1987 and 1990
YCMAD Conferences, an RA, members
of the varsity track and swim teams, a
dancer in Ballet Folklorico and much
much more.
The Daily has come right out and
said that Stanford students are too
stupid to think for themselves. The
League of Revolutionary Struggle has
been running things all along, using
students for its own ends.
But we, those who should know,
assert that Stanford students are not
dupes and that progressive student
politics on campus are decidedly demo
cratic. When a particular plan of action
is proposed by any student, others
weigh their options and then agree on
a path of action.

It is ironic that the six community
members you name have themselves
been some of the staunchest advocates
of democratic processes.
Just out of curiosity, what is wrong
with being a Marxist-Leninist? Last
time we checked, it was still legal in
this country to hold any political
beliefs or belong to any organization
without alerting the media.
Stanford should ask itself why radi
cals feel the need to avoid explicit
mention of their politics. It is easy to
get tagged as a radical at this univer
sity and have one's ideas and actions
written off. To avoid censure you keep
your head down and keep your
criticism in the mainstream.
The odd thing is that many of us
are in agreement with Marxists and
even that blacks, Latinos, women,
homosexuals and many others are
oppressed or at least suffer the effects
of past oppression? We may disagree
with the League's ultimate goals or
projects, but is it impossible to work
with them where we do agree? (If
indeed we could really find them.)
The need to avoid this kind of red

baiting will lead student groups to ask
radical members to leave in order to
avoid trouble. This process can only
lead to the stifling of discussion and
the weakening of student groups by
throwing out "the best and hardest
workers."
How long before we start hearing
that familiar old question before we
can participate in student politics: Are
you now or have you ever been ...
