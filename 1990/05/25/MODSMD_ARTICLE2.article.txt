# Creator of Chang flier comes forward in letter
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
A former employee of the Recy
cling Center acknowledged Wed
nesday night that he had distrib
uted posters attacking Gordon
Chang, who has been offered a
tenure-track professorship in the
History Department at Stanford.
In "an open letter to the Stan
ford community" submitted to
The Daily, Tom Terrell, who still
lives in the area, explained his
reasons for making the poster. He
described his disillusionment with
the politics of the League of
Revolutionary Struggle, the or
ganization of which he accused
Chang of being a leader.
Since its distribution, the poster
has come under heavy attack from
members of the Asian-American
community and others as being
"McCarthyist" and racist.
Since the poster was distribut
ed, members of the Asian-
American community have made
various statements strongly in fa
vor of Chang as their choice for
an Asian-American studies
tenure-track position.
In a Wednesday letter to The
Daily, outgoing Asian American
Student Association chair Joseph
Park and incoming AASA chair
Edward Morimoto defended
Chang's qualifications for the po
sition, based on his academic
record. "Professors should be
judged by their scholarship, not
by smears about their supposed
political lives," the letter said.
Chang could not be reached for
comment.
"For many years, I held
socialism as an ideal: a better,
more just society without dis
enfranchised people or great
poverty," Terrell said in his letter.
But he said the democracy move

ment in Eastern Europe and his
experiences with the League at
Stanford "have combined to impel
a thorough soul-searching and a
drastic re-evaluation of my ideas."
According to the letter, one of
the reasons for publicizing his
views in an open letter is that
"everybody and their orthodontist
has been talking about this sub
ject lately."
In a rambling style that char
acterized an earlier paper he
wrote on the League titled
"Maoism on the Farm" and the
poster attacking Chang, the letter
attacks a number of other Stan
ford students and staff members
who he alleges are members of
the League.
"This letter is going to embar
rass and anger certain people on
this campus, but they should take
a good look in the mirror and face
the fact that they have only them
selves to blame for the discomfort
this is going to cause them," the
letter said.
The letter was submitted to The
Daily Wednesday night and was
also posted in several residences
around campus.
According to the letter, one
source of "inner turmoil" for Ter
rell was an incident in which the
League allegedly expelled a Stan
ford student from its ranks be
cause she was a lesbian. Terrell
said he learned of her expulsion
in a "casual conversation" in
which he was also told of a re
ported provision in League bylaws
that excludes gays and lesbians.
It is unknown whether such a
provision actually exists. The stu
dent who was allegedly expelled
could not be reached for comment.
In a League publication titled
"Peace, Justice, Equality and
Socialism," the League sets forth
its policy on homosexuality in two
points after 24 pages about the
rights of people of color.
The two points are "the right
to livelihood and housing" and
"an end to police harassment."
Gay and lesbian rights "is at
best a peripheral part of their
agenda," according to Richard
Suh, a former AASA chair who
said he was recruited by the
League. Suh said that the homo
phobic image of the League was
one of the reasons he decided
against joining.
In the letter, Terrell said an
other incident that made him dis

illusioned with the League was a
rally last spring sponsored by the
Association of Chinese Students
and Scholars at Stanford in sup
port of the student democracy
movement in China. Terrell said
he was struck by the almost com
plete absence of League members
from the rally.
The League has traditionally
been in support of the Chinese
government and its policies. How
ever, the League condemned the
June 4 massacre of student dem
onstrators in Tiananmen Square
in Beijing, saying the crackdown
was "not in the spirit of socialism"
in an editorial printed in Unity
newspaper, a League publication.
Terrell was adamant in not
apologizing for his public attack
on Chang, saying the poster
"expresses what I think of him."
