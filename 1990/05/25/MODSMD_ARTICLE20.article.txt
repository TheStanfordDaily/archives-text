# League members have harmed own, others' issues
## 
### 
After writing this letter, in response
to The Daily's May 23 article on the
League of Revolutionary Struggle, I
had the computer check my spelling
for me. It did not recognize the word
"multiculturalism," which wasn't sur
prising, considering that I never heard
the word until coming here. It is a
word which would probably never be
used were it not for the work of such
people as are the subject of the article

I do not wish to attack their political
stand. I do, however, question any
student who would choose membership
with the League.
They have every right to be part of
any organization nationwide, but I
wonder if they realized the repurcus
sions, both campus and nationwide,
that their actions have.
As Stanford is at the forefront of
change in the nation, the story of
what happened on our campus is sure
to make headlines nationwide. I can
see the headlines of the prestigious
New York Post back home: "Stanford
University Run by Communist Pigs."
What is the impression given to ob
servers? That the changes at Stanford,
such as Cultures, Ideas and Values, are
not manifestations of a needed and

desired move toward multiculturalism
but the product of a few "radicals,"
working for their own goals.
And what of the damage caused on
campus when the work of groups such
as the Committee on Democracy in
Education, the Asian American Student
Association and MEChA are dismissed
by the unaware as subversive, its im
portance undermined.
In addition, I as a student am both
disappointed and disillusioned. To
think that some people I may have
voted for in the recent elections could
be members of this League amazes me.
Can I trust them to work for me,
vote in my best interest, rather than
listen to an organization with a voice
much more powerful than my own?
Was the takeover, which I saw a bold

and brave move on the students' part,
merely the work of lackeys?
I think that life at Stanford, and the
quality that it is to be, should be de
termined by Stanford students and
faculty. I do not know why students
joined the League. I certainly respect
them for trying to change what they
think wrong, even more so than the
many among us, myself included, who
are apathetic to their environment.
Whether or not they chose the right
banner to march under is not up to
me, but I hope their actions as far as
this campus is concerned were all for
the right reasons, reasons that came
from their minds and not someone
else's.
