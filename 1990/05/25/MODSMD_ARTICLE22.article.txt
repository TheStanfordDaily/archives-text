## Do not be afraid of love 
### 
LOVE IN THE '90s - that's what
Dr. Joyce Brothers talked about on
Tuesday. Which got me thinking
about love in the '80s and love in the
'70s — which got me depressed.
I didn't go see Dr. Joyce because I just
don't feel right taking advice on love
from someone who feels safe listing an
appearance on "Mr. Belvedere" as a cred
it. There aren't many rules I live by, but
I feel pretty strongly about this one.
I won't take love advice from Dr. Joyce,
I won't go to restaurants that Release
recommends with enthusiasm that is in
direct proportion to the amount of ad
space bought by that restaurant, and I
won't let Jim Rosse balance my check
book. Outside of these I'm pretty flexible.
See — I didn't date much in high
school. Twice, I think. On the first outing
I took a cheerleader to a movie,
"Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbid
den Zone," a 1983-D disaster.
A word to the wise: No matter how
well you get along, don't take a date to
a 3-D movie; by the time the show's over
one of you is guaranteed to have a head
ache.
My second date occurred when a friend
tricked me into asking a girl to the prom.
He told me how she'd just broken up
with her boyfriend and how now she had
no date and didn't I think she was nice
and wouldn't it be a shame to miss the
senior prom . . . before I knew it I was
at Tuxedo King with a measuring tape
up against my inseam.
But there's more to it than bad expe
riences; there's also my bad attitude. For

years I was a firm believer in the two
tenets of teenage relationships: one, that
it's a waste of time and money to take
someone out you don't really, really like
a whole lot and two, if you really really
like someone a whole lot it's safer not to
ask him or her out because if things
don't go well you might ruin a perfectly
good friendship.
I think you see the problem.
Spring causes other problems for me.
Example: By the end of high school I
found someone I was genuinely interested
in — and who was interested in me.
Things were going well until she said,
"Jon, you're going to Stanford where
you'll meet a whole lot of women and
you'll forget me, and so I think we should
end this relationship before it starts."
You know what? / believed her. I only
stopped kicking myself sophomore year.
Spring number 2: At the end of fresh
man year I went to a professor's office
to talk about law school. He said, "Jon,
don't think about that. When I was at
school here the most important thing to
me was love relationships. That's what
you should eryoy while you're here."
And you know what? I didn't believe
him. I'm starting to kick myself again.
The first time things fizzled because
I believed that time and distance will
inevitably kill a relationship. It's not a
bad aphorism, but I think I should have
at least argued that having a relationship
to kill is better than not having anything
at all.
The second time I had other problems.
I was content to wait, I was too busy, or

that horrible thing that happens when
someone you're interested in starts
showing interest in you happened to me.
You know how it is — the way they
laugh sets you on edge, the way they
smell starts to bother you, they give you
things and you put the things in drawers
and you suddenly notice how frighten
ingly dark the hair on their arms is.
What do you call it when that happens
— cold feet? A touch of Gynophobia?
Whatever it is, don't let time (either
plenty to spare or too little left) prevent
you from chancing something. I don't
think the "Stanford students don't date"
generalization is true, but 1 do think
enough people buy into it that it is un
wittingly perpetrated.
In closing then, SWM, 21, seeks ap
proximate opposite. Can use phone and
write well enough to keep significant
other generally amused at long distances.
Promises to one day be successful but
would prefer call before then.

in English last quarter and now has
plenty of free time to spend with a sig
nificant other. His column appears every
