## Stacey Leyton Daily's allegations negate individuals' positive contributions 
### 
AS I WRITE THIS, I am choking
in anger over the irresponsible
charges leveled by The Daily in
its story "League has played little
known role in campus politics."
In this story I find myself, among
others, assailed and accused, and my
contributions to this university negated
and maligned; all this, by unnamed
sources.
This, by a reporter who in a view
point piece claims, "Stanford should
not be a place where one is attacked
for political beliefs, regardless of
whether those beliefs be right-wing or
left-wing."
I discussed this article with the
reporter about a month before it was
published. In our discussion, I tried to
emphasize the role that red-baiting has
historically played in this country. I
said that people who have personal
vendettas due to political controversies
or failed personal relationships (as do
some of The Daily's "sources") often
will use anti-communism to discredit
everything that an individual stands
for or has done.
When accusations are given credence
by respected newspapers such as The
Daily, the results for the individuals
accused of being communists can be
enormous: family troubles, friends
fearing that if they associate too
closely with the accused they will also
be suspect, losing jobs, having to ex
plain oneself all one's life . . .
I tend to be too trusting sometimes,
but I hoped that The Daily would
consider these kinds of consequences
before publishing such serious allega
tions. Instead, the reporter has called
friends of mine and asked them about
"how close" we were and "why we
grew apart." He has questioned many

activists about my activities.
His campaign of harrassment has
finally found its way to print, and I
know that these charges may haunt
me for the rest of my life, as people
may ask me, "Are you now or have
you ever been a member of the League
of Revolutionary Struggle?"
It is ironic that the reporter himself
in a viewpoint piece complains of being
"subjected to a wide array of unsub
stantiated and damaging accusations.
... With one sweeping irresponsible
charge against me, everything that I
believe in most strongly has been
called into question, exposing me to
the suspicions of people who don't
know me and who don't know of my
strong personal convictions."
1 just wish he could truly know how
it feels to fall victim to these kinds of
tactics. I find myself identified as a
member of the League by "a number
of sources who asked not to be identi
fied." Supposedly these individuals
choose not to be identified because
they are "afraid of harassment."
Anyone who is at all familiar with
me knows that I have never and will
never harass anyone, no matter what
that person says about me and no
matter what their political beliefs. To
tell me that the sources accusing me
will forever remain a secret because
they fear me is to malign my personal
integrity and to question everything I
have ever stood for in terms of treat
ing all individuals with decency and
respect.
The charge of membership in a
communist organization is used specifi
cally to negate the contributions indi
viduals have made in building a pro
gressive society. I guess I should be
pleased to find myself in the good
company of individuals such as
Langston Hughes, Margaret Randall

and Paul Robeson, who have been
accused of and harassed for being
communists because they threatened
those who sought to maintain an
unjust status quo.
Supposedly the charge of communists
should be enough to discredit the
contributions of these great individuals,
or to negate my own contributions.
When I find people claiming that
"these people have a lot of influence,
because they're the ones who are
leaders," or that League members "are
leading progressive politics on campus
.. . because they are the best and the
hardest workers," I wonder, how is
this an accusation?
I have too much influence? Because
I'm a leader? Because I work too hard
or too well? How is it that this is a
problem? Do The Daily's accusations
make me unfit to speak my opinions
and hope that others will listen to me
and take into account what I say?
Any "influence" that 1 might have
derives from people respecting what I
have done or agreeing with what I say.
I was elected to the Council of Presi
dents in spring 1988 not because I
duped or manipulated voters, but
because people liked the platform that
we put forward; we called for the
ASSU being opened to the participation
of all students, and we promised to
stand for an agenda of multicul
turalism and educational rights.
I am proud of what the COP was
able to accomplish that year â€” we
established the Committee on Democ
racy in Education, ASSU Dorm Repre
sentatives, Beat the Bookstore, the
ASSU Airport Shuttle, Course Consult
ants, Financial Aid Advocates ... we
made the ASSU the relevant and
dynamic institution that it is today.
Some disagreed with some of the

decisions we made and the tactics we
used. We appreciated criticisms, and I
think you will find that the People's
Platform has changed a lot in response
to such concerns. Responsible criticism,
criticism of individuals based on what
they have actually done, is appropriate
and critical at an institution such as
Stanford.
Irresponsible criticism, accusations
thrown out in order to discredit indi
viduals based on their political beliefs,
serves only to divide and alienate the
Stanford community.
Why didn't The Daily choose to
acknowledge the contributions that I
have made, not only as a member of
the COP but also as an ASSU senator,
an activist in the anti-apartheid and
the educational rights movements, as a
residential assistant, among other
activists? Why didn't he mention that I
received the Dean's Award for service
to the Stanford community? Why
didn't he mention that in spite of the
tremendous number of hours I have
committed to such activities, I man
aged to work hard in school and grad
uate Phi Beta Kappa? And why didn't
he print anything about my vision of a
better society, the personal convictions
and commitment to social justice that
have driven me to pursue my goals?
To mention those things would have
made me a real person, a person that
Daily readers might respect for my
contributions.
I am truly sorry that The Daily
instead chose to print unsubstantiated
allegations without printing my re
sponses, without noting why I felt it
was fundamentally wrong to be pursu
ing the story in a manner that
harassed individuals such as myself.
I regret that anyone on this campus
has to answer the question of whether
they have ever been a member of a

communist organization. Such a ques
tion is no different from that asked by
Joseph McCarthy during the hearings
of the 19505. These hearings destroyed
many individuals' lives, including a
Stanford professor who committed
suicide when called to testify before
these Congressional committees.
I am definitely afraid, afraid that
the FBI will come knocking on my
door, or that in future years I will be
forced to defend my political beliefs as
a result of this Daily article.
But I am strengthened in knowing
that the mtyority of Stanford students
will choose to support or oppose me
based on my actions and my contribu
tions to this campus, not based on
what a few unnamed sources have said
about me.
I know that most students truly
believe in what the reporter ironically
calls for in his viewpoint: "an environ
ment of enlightened discussion of all
relevant issues, not one of harassment
against individuals that challenge the
accepted 'truths' that govern our
lives."
Oh, and by the way, I also lived for
a time in the house on Bryant Street
which The Daily identifies as "Revolu
tionary Hotel" and "where recruitment
for the League has occurred, according
to sources who say they have been
recruited."
I guess that kind of negates every
thing I have said in this letter, doesn't
it? Makes me pretty suspicious, right?
You might want to disregard every
thing I wrote, after all, because who
would believe anything that someone
suspected of communist sympathies
would write?
