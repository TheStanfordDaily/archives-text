Major-General William Snow,
chief of artillery in the National
War Department determined
Stanford to be "the logical place
for a large field artillery unit be
cause of the rise of the campus
and the nature of the surrounding
territory." The major-general was
visiting the campus to inspect the
R.O.T.C. unit.
Stanford land has captured the
imagination of many people.
Leland Stanford thought it was
perfect for prize-winning horses.
He later changed hobbies and
decided it was perfect for prize
winning minds. Someone else
thought this place would be great
for a golf course and a two mile
long amusement park known as
SLAC. The army, sharing the op
inion of some students today,
thought this place was perfect to
blow up.

Dr. J. Clausen, a botanist at the
Stanford branch of the Carnegie
Institute, predicted that the fa
mous Palo Alto tree on the bank
of San Francisquito Creek would
survive for an indefinite period,
perhaps a century or more.
Clausen observed that the tree
was out of its natural range and
that its seed had probably been
washed down from the Santa
Cruz Mountains.

Dr. Anthony C. Sokol of the
Stanford Germanic Languages
Department recounted to The
Daily how two Dutch men were
eaten by cannibals in the South
Seas.
Apparently, while cruising near
Humboldt Bay, New Guinea in
1922, Sokol docked his ship to get
supplies. Members of his crew ob
served several natives engaged in
ceremonial dances on the beach,
and two Dutch officers went
ashore to watch them. The can
nibals who had been preparing for

a raid on another tribe changed
their minds when they caught
sight of the tasty-looking
Dutchmen.
/ sense a moral in this little
tale, if not "Far Side" material.
There is always hope. If you are
sad, you will be happy. If you're
hungry, a tender Dutch morsel
may mysteriously appear and
satisfy you. And, if you fail your
courses they won't show up on your
transcript. Tell your children,
curiosity killed the cat but fed the
unsuspecting cannibal.

Earlier that week, armed at
tackers had kidnapped three Stan
ford students and a Dutch
researcher from Tanzania's famed
Gombe Stream primate research
center.
There had been no word from
the kidnappers, whose identities
were unknown. According to
sketchy reports from Tanzania, a
boat containing 40 uniformed men
from the neighboring nation of
Zaire raided the facility on the
eastern shore of Lake Tan
ganyika.
About 15 other students, in
cluding seven from Stanford,
managed to escape the attack. Dr.
Jane Goodall, the center's director
and a Stanford professor, ap
peared to be the target of the
raid. According to reports she es
caped into the jungle.
I don't want you to get as
curious as the poor Dutchmen —
all of the students were eventually
released. The University denied
rumors that it paid the captors
$40,000 for the release of the stu
dents.
