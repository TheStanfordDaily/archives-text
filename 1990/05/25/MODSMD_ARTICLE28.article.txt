# The
						Bug 'literally' explains Joseph Heller to his curious readers

### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
My uncle flew into town this weekend,
and we entered into one of those casual
conversations that tend to happen be
tween people who haven't seen each other
in a while. He asked me, "So, what are
you up to these days?" I answered, "Oh,
not much. How about you?" This was
the beginning of a truly meaningful con
versation.
"I was talking to your Dad last night,"
my Uncle was telling me. "And we
realized that out of the extended family,
he and I were the only ones gainfully
employed." He's right — so I asked him
to lend me 20 bucks.

Dear Bug,
Why do people say "catch 22" instead

of "catch anything but 22?"
— Budget
The phrase "catch 22" comes from the
book of the same name by Joseph Heller.
I thought it might be neat to talk to Mr.
Heller, but the publishing company only
gave me his address — I expect to hear
back sometime in late August.
Interestingly enough the book was al
most titled "Catch 18," but Heller
changed the name because Leon Uris
published a book called "Mila-18" just
prior to Heller's publication.
I had to resort to crude methods to
find the origin of this phrase. I knew it
was a military phrase, so I started calling
armed forces recruiters. I first contacted
the Marines and asked if they knew the
origin of the phrase:
"Hell, I don't know. Wouldn't know
where the hell to start . . . Jesus Christ,
that's a toughie!" (This is no joke, he
really said this.)

The Marines weren't much help, so I
called the Navy, and they politely sug
gested 1 try looking through the book.
Chapter 1, "Catch 22":
There was only one catch, and that
was catch 22, which specified that a con
cern for one's safety in the face of dangers
that were real and immediate was the
process of a rational mind. Orr (he's a
character in the book) would be crazy to
fly more missions and sane if he didn't,
but if he was sane he had to fly them.
If he flew them he was crazy and didn't
have to; but if he didn't he was sane and
had to. If he were sane, but really crazy,
because he flew too much while thinking
he was crazy, well then he was really
crazy. I mean not just insanely crazy but
nuts, wacko, but nevertheless sane for
thinking he was such . . .
Dear Bug,
Do you know what that orange traffic

cone is doing on the roof of the main
entrance to the Inner Quad?
— t.t.
1 went to the Inner Quad, and sure
enough there is an orange cone on the
roof, just to the right of the apex of the
arch. It didn't look like it was doing
anything at the time, so I sat down in
the grass and watched it for a while. The
cone didn't do anything while I was there.
I figured maybe somebody else had
seen the cone doing something, so I
decided to do my very own student poll.
I picked up the directory and randomly
called people. This turned out to be an
ineffective method of getting an answer,
mainly because nobody had even seen the
cone, and one person asked me what the
cone on the arch above Mem Chu was
doing. This just reinforces my opinion
that most students don't go to class dur
ing spring quarter.
