## Card beats upset-minded Camels in regional opener 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
For four and a third innings yesterday
afternoon, the Fighting Camels of
Campbell University were spitting all
over the No. 1 baseball team in the
country.
For four and a third innings, Camp
bell pitcher Tom McGraw had the Stan
ford Cardinal's batters lost in a desert
by getting them to pop up, hit weak
grounders and look foolish on strike
outs.
For four and a third innings the
Camels, who entered the game 15-31,
had a legitimate shot at the collegiate
baseball upset of the year.
But only for four and a third innings.

Cardinal 7
Fighting Camels 0

With one gone in the bottom of the
fifth, Troy Tallman finally got the Car
dinal's offense over the Camels' hump
by creaming a high fastball from
McGraw for his ninth homer of the
year. Two pitches later Jeff Hammonds
did the same for his sixth dong, and
Stanford had a three-zip lead that would
prove to be more than enough against
the Camel's drought-stricken offense.
With the victory, the Cardinal has
tied the school record for wins at 53-10
and now moves into the NCAA West I
Regional second round against Middle
Tennessee State at 12:30 p.m. today.
The Blue Raiders, who were mauled
18-6 by San Diego State yesterday
morning, need to win today to stay alive
in the double-elimination tournament.
The Camels, who were down by only
one going into the bottom of the fifth,
will face Southern Illinois in a loser

gets-a-trip-home game at 9 a.m. How
ever, even if they lose, the Camels have
proven they deserve to be here.
"Seven-nothing — that's not that
bad," Campbell Coach Mike Caldwell
grinned afterward. "If we'd scored in
the first five innings, it might have
been a different ball game. Of course,
if we do, maybe [Stanford's] offense gets
even more fired up.
"I'm pleased with our kids," Caldwell
said. "I'm proud of 'em. Hopefully the
experience will help us tomorrow."
"They played well, good enough to
beat us," Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess said. "This was one of those
games where if we don't get get a great
pitching performance, we lose."
That great pitching performance was
turned in by John Reid, who gave up
only six singles and a double in his
eight innings of work. Normally Reid
pitches the third game of each Cardinal
series, but Marquess and pitching coach
Tom Dunton juggled the rotation —
allowing aces Mike Mussina and Stan
Spencer to pitch today and tomorrow,
respectively — because of the Camels'
less-than-awe-inspiring record.
"I think they went with me because
they looked at [the Camels] and figured

'I'm pleased with our kids. I'm proud of 'em.
Seven-nothing — that's not that bad. If we'd
scored in the first five innings, it might have
been a different ballgame. Of course, if we do,
maybe [Stanford's] offense gets even more
fired up.'

if I'm on my game like I had been before
last weekend, I can handle them," Reid
said. "It's nice to know they have that
confidence in me."
The confidence was well-founded, for
Reid didn't let a single Camel get as
far as third base. For the first four
innings, however, McGraw was handling
the Cardinal just as well — except for
Hammonds, of course.
Hammonds led off the game with a
single to left, and after he stole second
(beating the throw by about the distance
from here to Buies Creek, N.C.), moved
to third on a grounder and scored on
a sac fly, it looked like McGraw was in
for a lousy day.
Then something funny happened: in
the next three innings, only three Car
dinal players got on base, all on walks.
Everyone else was busy popping up,
striking out or grounding into double
plays as McGraw's junk pitches (many
of them burrowing into the dirt around
the plate) kept each batter off-balance.
"That type of pitcher — the ones who
hit their spots and mix in the changeup
and slow curve — those are the ones
who have troubled us the most this
year," Tallman said. "He did a good job
— he hit his spots and kept us off
balance."
Until the fifth, that is. With one gone,
Tallman watched three straight balls
fly by, took a strike, and then launched
a no-doubt-about-it shot that soared so
far he could have rounded the bases,
run into the dugout, strapped on his
catcher's gear and been back out at the
plate for the next inning by the time
it landed.
"Usually, nobody has to pick us up,"
Tallman said. "No one guy has to do
it. We just figure someone'll get a hit
to get us going.
"As soon as I got back to the dugout
it was a lot looser," Tallman said. "It
was almost like people said 'There's the
first — now let's get about our busi
ness.' "
Hammonds got busy right away,
mauling the second pitch he saw for a
low-trajectory hom°r that almost split
one of the left-field pine trees in half.
"The kid that led off was the key,"
Caldwell said. "He was definitely the

Paul Carey had two hits and an RBI as he and his Cardinal teammates tied the
team record for victories in a season with a 7-0 victory over Campbell yesterday in
the West I Regional at Sunken Diamond. Stanford is 53-10 on the year.
