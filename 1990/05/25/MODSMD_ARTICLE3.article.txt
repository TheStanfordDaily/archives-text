Soviet chief of protocol Vladimir
Cherneshev is expected to arrive
today to tour proposed sites for
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev's June 4 visit and make final
decisions on the proposed
itinerary.
As of late yesterday afternoon,
the time of Cherneshev's visit had
not been set. He was scheduled
to arrive in San Francisco last
night.
His arrival follows yesterday's
visit by Soviet Consul General
Valentin Kamenev. He came as
part of a seven-member Soviet ad
vance team, sent ahead to inspect
proposed locations for Gorba
chev's speech as well as several
other places he may stop.
Their objective was to make rec
ommendations, they stressed,
adding that final decisions will be
made after the protocol chiefs
visit. The advance team was
joined by several secret service
agents, police and representatives
from the Office of Public Affairs.
Members of the delegation were
given Stanford baseball hats and
sweatshirts before their tour of
campus sites, including Memorial
Auditorium, Frost Amphitheater
and Maples Pavilion. Memorial
Auditorium is the Soviets' current
choice for Gorbachev's speech.

The group dined on box lunches
in History Corner.
They also met Hoover Institu
tion Director John Raisian at
Hoover and toured the rotunda
and archives. A Hoover tour is
one of the item 3 on the proposed
agenda for Gorbachev's visit,
which was released yesterday.
Other activities include a greet
ing on the front steps of the Quad
with University President Donald
Kennedy, his wife Robin, and
George and O'Bie Shultz.
Whether Raisa Gorbachev will
join her husband for the visit to
Stanford was still unconfirmed
last night.
According to the proposed
itinerary, Gorbachev will tour the
Quad and meet with a select
group of Stanford faculty, Hoover
fellows and students. The meeting
will include a proposed 25 to 40
participants, who have yet to be
selected.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Freelen said earlier this
week that people's interests and
expertise will be considered in
making the choice.
