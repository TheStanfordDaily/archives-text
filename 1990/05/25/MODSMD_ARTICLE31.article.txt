INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - The
red coats are coming! The red
coats are coming!
For the rest of the NCAA In
dividual Tennis Championships
field, the nightmares have gotten
worse and worse. Towering pubes
cents wearing red and white —
with names like Alex, Jared, John,
Alexis, Jason and Jeff — have
been coming back from one set

down and smashing little yellow
fuzzy things down other people's
throats. They have been hitting
all the big shots at all the right
times.
After yesterday, the nightmares
will do anything but subside. All
three Stanford doubles teams ad
vanced to the round of 16, as did
two of the three singles entrants.
But, in doing so, the Stanford con
tingent had to go to the magic
well more than a few times.
In the last match of the day,

the second-seeded team of Jona
than Stark and Jared Palmer
rebounded from a sluggish first
set-and-a-half to down North
western's Todd Martin and Chris
Gregersen 6-7, 7-6, 6-4. Martin is
the top seed in the singles com
petition.
After losing the first set, Stark
and Palmer quickly fell behind
3-0 in the second. "We were still
thinking too much about our
singles matches [earlier in the
day]," said Palmer. "When we got

down two breaks at 3-0 in the
second, we both realized that it
was now or never."
Palmer and Stark held serve
and broke back immediately to
put it at 3-2. But Martin and
Gregersen played two good service
games, and Martin was serving
for the match at 5-4.
After losing the first point in
Martin's service game, Palmer
and Stark won the next two to
put the score at 15-30.
At that point, Martin, who has
one of the biggest deliveries in
college tennis, blasted a first serve
at Palmer's backhand. Shank!
But, as Palmer will attest,
sometimes a shank is the best
shot of all. The backhand landed
just over Gregersen's racquet and
right inside the baseline: 15-40.
Palmer just drooped his head. "We
didn't deserve to win that point.
I didn't hit it very well," Palmer
said.
But two points later Palmer and
Stark had knotted the match at
5-5.
The Stanford duo went on to
win a close second-set tiebreaker
at 8-6. Stark and Palmer only
needed one break in the third,
winning it at 6-4.
"They started off sluggish,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"They picked it up just enough
to win."
"We weren't communicating too
well out there," Palmer added.
"This was our first competitive
match in a long time."
Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee also
rebounded from a slow first set
to edge Texas' Steve Bryan and
Hubert Karrasch 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.
Up 6-5 in the third, O'Brien
and Yee played nearly a perfect
game, combining low returns and
reflex volleys to break Karrasch
at 15.
O'Brien wasn't so lucky in the
singles. The Stanford sophomore,
who hadn't lost a singles match
since the finals of the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, fell to
No. 5-8 seed Conny Falk of Miami
6-4, 6-2.

was the 14th-ranked player In college tennis this season. As a result, O'Brien bowed out of the
singles to a seeded player yesterday; however, he and partner Jason Yee won In doubles.
