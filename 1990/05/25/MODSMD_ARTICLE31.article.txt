INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - The
red coats are coming! The red
coats are coming!
For the rest of the NCAA In
dividual Tennis Championships
field, the nightmares have gotten
worse and worse. Towering pubes
cents wearing red and white —
with names like Alex, Jared, John,
Alexis, Jason and Jeff — have
been coming back from one set

down and smashing little yellow
fuzzy things down other people's
throats. They have been hitting
all the big shots at all the right
times.
After yesterday, the nightmares
will do anything but subside. All
three Stanford doubles teams ad
vanced to the round of 16, as did
two of the three singles entrants.
But, in doing so, the Stanford con
tingent had to go to the magic
well more than a few times.
In the last match of the day,

the second-seeded team of Jona
than Stark and Jared Palmer
rebounded from a sluggish first
set-and-a-half to down North
western's Todd Martin and Chris
Gregersen 6-7, 7-6, 6-4. Martin is
the top seed in the singles com
petition.
After losing the first set, Stark
and Palmer quickly fell behind
3-0 in the second. "We were still
thinking too much about our
singles matches [earlier in the
day]," said Palmer. "When we got

down two breaks at 3-0 in the
second, we both realized that it
was now or never."
Palmer and Stark held serve
and broke back immediately to
put it at 3-2. But Martin and
Gregersen played two good service
games, and Martin was serving
for the match at 5-4.
After losing the first point in
Martin's service game, Palmer
and Stark won the next two to
put the score at 15-30.
At that point, Martin, who has
one of the biggest deliveries in
college tennis, blasted a first serve
at Palmer's backhand. Shank!
But, as Palmer will attest,
sometimes a shank is the best
shot of all. The backhand landed
just over Gregersen's racquet and
right inside the baseline: 15-40.
Palmer just drooped his head. "We
didn't deserve to win that point.
I didn't hit it very well," Palmer
said.
But two points later Palmer and
Stark had knotted the match at
5-5.
The Stanford duo went on to
win a close second-set tiebreaker
at 8-6. Stark and Palmer only
needed one break in the third,
winning it at 6-4.
"They started off sluggish,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"They picked it up just enough
to win."
"We weren't communicating too
well out there," Palmer added.
"This was our first competitive
match in a long time."
Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee also
rebounded from a slow first set
to edge Texas' Steve Bryan and
Hubert Karrasch 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.
Up 6-5 in the third, O'Brien
and Yee played nearly a perfect
game, combining low returns and
reflex volleys to break Karrasch
at 15.
O'Brien wasn't so lucky in the
singles. The Stanford sophomore,
who hadn't lost a singles match
since the finals of the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, fell to
No. 5-8 seed Conny Falk of Miami
6-4, 6-2.

Alex O'Brien was not seeded In the NCAA Individual Singles Championships despite the fact that he
was the 14th-ranked player In college tennis this season. As a result, O'Brien bowed out of the
singles to a seeded player yesterday; however, he and partner Jason Yee won In doubles.
But the 1990 Stanford Ail-
American had his chances in a
match that mostly featured long
baseline brawls. At 4-4 in the
first, O'Brien lost four consecu
tive games in which he was
leading or had a game point.
"Those games were crucial,"
Gould said. "He needed to win
one of those."
Down 2-0 in the second,
O'Brien broke back to 2-1 but Falk
continued his amazingly consis
tent baseline play to to win the
set at 6-2.
O'Brien's loss was surrounded
by a bit of controversy. Despite
being ranked No. 14 heading into
the tournament and not having
lost a dual match in over a month,
O'Brien was not seeded in the top
16 at the NCAAs.
"There were a few guys who
were seeded who probably
shouldn't have been," teammate
Alexis Hombrecher said. "You
hate to see two of the very top
players in the tournament
(O'Brien and Falk) meeting in the
second round. It just shouldn't
happen like that."
In other Cardinal action,
Hombrecher and Cathrall ad
vanced with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over
South Carolina's Stephane Simian
and David Hopper.
"We didn't play great,"
Hombrecher said. "We played nor
mal, but it was enough to win
today."
Palmer and Stark also won
their singles matches in straight
sets. Palmer, who beat No. 5-8
seed Joby Foley Wednesday,
pounded Shaun O'Donovan of
Texas A&M 3-3, 6-4.
"[O'Donovan] was the type of
player who wasn't going to beat
me unless I beat myself," Palmer
said. "I knew that he was a hit

Stark, the No. 2 seed, also ad
vanced to the round of 16 with a
6-2, 6-4 victory over Lou Gloria
of South Carolina.
Stark will play Ty Tucker of
Ohio State today, while Palmer
will square off against Louisiana
State's Tom Furukrantz.
In the doubles, Stark and Pal
mer will face UCLA's No. 1 team
of Fritz Bissell and Mark
Knowles. Hombrecher and Cath
rall will square off against Mitch
Michulka and Michael Penman of
Texas, a No. 5-8 seed. O'Brien
and Yee will meet Johan Donar
and Conny Falk of Miami, another
No. 5-8 seed.

singles to a seeded player yesterday; however, he and partner Jason Yee won In doubles.
But the 1990 Stanford Ail-
American had his chances in a
match that mostly featured long
baseline brawls. At 4-4 in the
first, O'Brien lost four consecu
tive games in which he was
leading or had a game point.
"Those games were crucial,"
Gould said. "He needed to win
one of those."
Down 2-0 in the second,
O'Brien broke back to 2-1 but Falk
continued his amazingly consis
tent baseline play to to win the
set at 6-2.
O'Brien's loss was surrounded
by a bit of controversy. Despite
being ranked No. 14 heading into
the tournament and not having
lost a dual match in over a month,
O'Brien was not seeded in the top
16 at the NCAAs.
"There were a few guys who
were seeded who probably
shouldn't have been," teammate
Alexis Hombrecher said. "You
hate to see two of the very top
players in the tournament
(O'Brien and Falk) meeting in the
second round. It just shouldn't
happen like that."
In other Cardinal action,
Hombrecher and Cathrall ad
vanced with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over
South Carolina's Stephane Simian
and David Hopper.
"We didn't play great,"
Hombrecher said. "We played nor
mal, but it was enough to win
today."
Palmer and Stark also won
their singles matches in straight
sets. Palmer, who beat No. 5-8
seed Joby Foley Wednesday,
pounded Shaun O'Donovan of
Texas A&M 3-3, 6-4.
"[O'Donovan] was the type of
player who wasn't going to beat

said. "I knew that he was a hit

"The match was tight. I ended

Stark, the No. 2 seed, also ad

6-2, 6-4 victory over Lou Gloria
of South Carolina.
Stark will play Ty Tucker of
Ohio State today, while Palmer
will square off against Louisiana
State's Tom Furukrantz.
In the doubles, Stark and Pal

No. 5-8 seed.
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - The
red coats are coming! The red
coats are coming!
For the rest of the NCAA In
dividual Tennis Championships
field, the nightmares have gotten
worse and worse. Towering pubes
cents wearing red and white —
with names like Alex, Jared, John,
Alexis, Jason and Jeff — have
been coming back from one set

down and smashing little yellow
fuzzy things down other people's
throats. They have been hitting
all the big shots at all the right
times.
After yesterday, the nightmares
will do anything but subside. All
three Stanford doubles teams ad
vanced to the round of 16, as did
two of the three singles entrants.
But, in doing so, the Stanford con
tingent had to go to the magic
well more than a few times.
In the last match of the day,

the second-seeded team of Jona
than Stark and Jared Palmer
rebounded from a sluggish first
set-and-a-half to down North
western's Todd Martin and Chris
Gregersen 6-7, 7-6, 6-4. Martin is
the top seed in the singles com
petition.
After losing the first set, Stark
and Palmer quickly fell behind
3-0 in the second. "We were still
thinking too much about our
singles matches [earlier in the
day]," said Palmer. "When we got

down two breaks at 3-0 in the
second, we both realized that it
was now or never."
Palmer and Stark held serve
and broke back immediately to
put it at 3-2. But Martin and
Gregersen played two good service
games, and Martin was serving
for the match at 5-4.
After losing the first point in
Martin's service game, Palmer
and Stark won the next two to
put the score at 15-30.
At that point, Martin, who has
one of the biggest deliveries in
college tennis, blasted a first serve
at Palmer's backhand. Shank!
But, as Palmer will attest,
sometimes a shank is the best
shot of all. The backhand landed
just over Gregersen's racquet and
right inside the baseline: 15-40.
Palmer just drooped his head. "We
didn't deserve to win that point.
I didn't hit it very well," Palmer
said.
But two points later Palmer and
Stark had knotted the match at
5-5.
The Stanford duo went on to
win a close second-set tiebreaker
at 8-6. Stark and Palmer only
needed one break in the third,
winning it at 6-4.
"They started off sluggish,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"They picked it up just enough
to win."
"We weren't communicating too
well out there," Palmer added.
"This was our first competitive
match in a long time."
Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee also
rebounded from a slow first set
to edge Texas' Steve Bryan and
Hubert Karrasch 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.
Up 6-5 in the third, O'Brien
and Yee played nearly a perfect
game, combining low returns and
reflex volleys to break Karrasch
at 15.
O'Brien wasn't so lucky in the
singles. The Stanford sophomore,
who hadn't lost a singles match
since the finals of the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, fell to
No. 5-8 seed Conny Falk of Miami
6-4, 6-2.
