# Women golfers fail to move at NCAAs
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
There is good and bad news
out of Hilton Head, South
Carolina where the Cardinal
women's golf team is competing
in the NCAA Championships.
First, the bad news. In the
second round yesterday, Stan
ford shot a 312 which dropped
the team into 10th place, 19
shots behind leader and pre
tournament favorite Arizona
State.
Now, the good news. Make
that the great news. Sopho
more Adele Moore is still
leading the tournament.
As teammate Stephanie
Davis said, "Adele's playing
really well right now. This is
the top tournament in the
country, with so many good
players, and she's in first place.
It's amazing."
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
is also obviously pleased with
Moore's perfomance. "Adele is
playing tremendous golf on a
tremendously difficult course."
Hopefully, Moore's perform
ance will carry over to the rest
of her teammates, who are
having a little tougher time
with the challenging Arthur
Hills Golf Course.
Davis, who had a terrible
first day, had a much better
second round yesterday, finish
ing with a round of 77. Never
theless, she is still a little leery
of the water hazard-filled
course.
"The golf course is getting
the best of me.," she said. "I'm
getting used to it a little bit,
but I'm still not happy."
Someone else who is not too
happy with her performance is
junior Jodi Figley. The Cardi
nal veteran's second day score
of 79 dropped her into 20th
place after two rounds. She had

been in seventh after the first
18 holes.
Audrey Wooding is probably
even more disappointed with
how she has played in the first
two rounds. One of the team's
most consistent golfers all year
long, Wooding has struggled in
the NCAA's with surprisingly
high rounds of 84 and 81.
Senior Stephanie Parel has
equalled Wooding's two round
score of 165.
With only two rounds left,
the Cardinal's hopes of winning
the national title are almost all
gone, but the team still has a
realistic chance to finish in the
top five.
"We're not satisfied with
how we're playing," said Davis,
"but we still have two rounds
left. If we could finish in the
top five, that would be great."
Martha Richards, who is not
playing in this tournament but
is still watching and cheering
her teammates on, feels the
team will have a much better
next two rounds. "We know we
can play better and we just
have to put it all together. To
morrow is going to be a great
day. I have a good feeling about
it, and I'm usually right about
these things."
The Cardinal hopes Richards
is right, and the team also
hopes that Moore will continue
her strong showing. As Davis
said, "Adele has really inspired
us, and hopefully we'll be able
to follow her lead."
Moore is (logically) enjoying
being in the leader's position.
"I like being in the lead.
Nobody expected me to be
there, so it's a great feeling."
Surprisingly, she is not
feeling any added pressure
from being ahead of the rest
of the field. "I'm just relaxing
out there and having a good
time. It's fun to play well."
