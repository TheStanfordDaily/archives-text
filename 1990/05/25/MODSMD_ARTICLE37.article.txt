# Wither the wind?
## Cardinal golfers find amenable elements at regional in Las Cruces 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
The men's golf team had its
guns ablazin' in yesterday's wild
opening round of the NCAA West
ern Regional Golf Championships,
as the Cardinal finished tied for
eighth after the first day of com
petition.
With the vaunted winds of Las
Cruces, N.M. notable by their ab
sence, the tourney was trans
formed into a veritable shoot-out
between the top 18 golf teams in
the West.
The Cardinal is knotted with
San Diego State, as both squads
are 11 shots of the blistering pace
set by the leading Arizona Wild
cats.
Stanford was led by senior Brad
Geer, who fired a four-under-par
68 to tie for fifth individually. In
a field of 93 players, Geer tallied
one of a staggering total of 45
sub-par opening rounds.
The New Mexico State Univer
sity Course was designed to chal
lenge players when the afternoon
winds that haunt the region kick
up. According to Stanford
Coach Wally Goodwin, when the
wind blows, the links can be
nearly impossible to navigate. But
when it doesn't blow. ...
"Without wind, this is not a
difficult course, " Goodwin said.
"There is plenty of room on the
fairways and the greens aren't
tricky. Today's scores show you
what can be done when there is
no wind," he said.
Marc Funseth and Christian
Cevaer fell victim to the ease the
lack of wind provided in Las
Cruces, as both ended up tied for
31st in the field despite carding
sub-par scores of 71.

'Without the wind,
this course is
manageable and I
could tell that I
would play well.'
— Brad Geer

Steve White posted solid rounds
for the Cardinal, as White's two
over 74 bested his teammate by
a stroke.
But for Stanford, the day
belonged entirely to Geer. The
player who shot the highest prac
tice round amongst his team
mates to qualify for the journey
to New Mexico, the Cardinal vet
eran demonstrated his dazzling
array of shot-making skills.
In his finest afternoon of col
legiate golf, Geer hit all but one
green in regulation, birdied three
of the six closing holes, and did
not suffer a bogey in the entire
opening round of competition.
"I just was striking the ball
well," Geer said in an analysis of
his performance. "Without the
wind, this course is manageable
and I could tell that I would play
well," he said.
Stanford needs to finish among
the top nine teams to advance to
next month's NCAA Champion
ships in Innisbrook, Florida. With
36 holes remaining, the squad ex
pressed confidence in its potential
in New Mexico.
"We need to play more consis
tently [Friday] and Saturday,"
Goodwin said. "However, I do feel
that this team has what it takes
to move on."

total placed him 10 shots behind the pace.
