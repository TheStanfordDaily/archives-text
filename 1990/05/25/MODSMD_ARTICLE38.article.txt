# 1990 NCAA West I Regional
## 
### 

The above is only today's portion of the bracket. Because of
the double- elimination format of the NCAA baseball tourna
ment, the shape of the bracket depends upon how quickly
teams are eliminated. Saturday and Sunday's schedule allows
for extra games, if necessary, to produce a champion who
has not lost twice. Regardless of today's outcome, however,
Stanford will play their third game tomorrow at 9 a.m.
