The revised interpretation of the Fun
damental Standard was approved by the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
last night by an 8-3 vote.
The passage, at a meeting in Tresid
der Union, constituted the final stage
in the approval of the interpretation. It
will go into effect June 11.
Though the proposal was approved,
University President Donaid Kennedy
can still veto it, although there is no
formal procedure in which it will be
submitted to him.
The interpretation, written by Law

Prof. Tom Grey, states
it "is intended to clarify
the point at which
protected free expres
sion ends and prohib
ited discriminatory
harassment begins."
According to the in
terpretation, students
who intimidate other

students through vio
lence or threat of violence, or who harass
students "on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation,
or national and ethnic origin," will be

in violation of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
The SCLC has received about 45 writ
ten responses to the proposal, 35 of
which have been interpreted as being
in opposition to it, according to SCLC
member Perry Friedman, a coterminaJ
student in computer science.
SCLC members discussed some of
these criticisms during last night's
meeting. Friedman, who opposed the
proposal, said it would end up being
"purely punitive" and not educational.
