# Standard interpretation approved
## 
### Allison Shue 
The revised interpretation of the Fun
damental Standard was approved by the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
last night by an 8-3 vote.
The passage, at a meeting in Tresid
der Union, constituted the final stage
in the approval of the interpretation. It
will go into effect June 11.
Though the proposal was approved,
University President Donaid Kennedy
can still veto it, although there is no
formal procedure in which it will be
submitted to him.
The interpretation, written by Law

Prof. Tom Grey, states
it "is intended to clarify
the point at which
protected free expres
sion ends and prohib
ited discriminatory
harassment begins."
According to the in
terpretation, students
who intimidate other

students through vio
lence or threat of violence, or who harass
students "on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation,
or national and ethnic origin," will be

in violation of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
The SCLC has received about 45 writ
ten responses to the proposal, 35 of
which have been interpreted as being
in opposition to it, according to SCLC
member Perry Friedman, a coterminaJ
student in computer science.
SCLC members discussed some of
these criticisms during last night's
meeting. Friedman, who opposed the
proposal, said it would end up being
"purely punitive" and not educational.
However, judicial affairs officer Sally


Grey
Cole, who favors the proposal,
pointed out that though most ex
amples of discrimination would
probably still be worked out
informally, it would be helpful to
have a rule in place if needed.
Graduate student Constantino
Pena was another member who
opposed the proposal. He raised
concerns about its ambiguity, say
ing some people do not under
stand the proposal. He also

asserted Stanford has no jurisdic
tion to limit what people can say.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Tom Kane said that by passing
this proposal, Stanford would lose
the bigger battle against racism
and the University would only
pass a law "against the obvious."
After the meeting, Philosophy
Prof. John Perry said in an in
terview, "I'm happy that the pro
posal has been passed. I think
Tom Grey and (Law Prof. Robert)
Rabin deserve enormous credit for
designing a proposal that will be
effective educationally and will be
extremely difficult to abuse in

such a way that freedom of speech
will be imperiled."
Newly elected ASSU Senate
Chair Solina Kwan, who voted for
the proposal, commented, "I think
it's a positive step in clarifying
our common goals. I think it's
definitely going to make Sally
Cole's job a lot easier."
At the end of the meeting,
Rabin, the SCLC chair, said, "I
guess having passed the proposal,
my main hope is that we won't
have to use it. I hope there will
be a degree of civility next year
and in the following years that
makes it unnecessary to rely on

the proposal."
The proposal was presented
April 4 by the SCLC for public
comment. A month later, the
SCLC made minor revisions on
the proposal and resubmitted it
to the public for another 14-day
comment period.
Student and faculty reactions
to the proposal have been mixed.
Results of a Daily poll published
May 7 showed that almost as
many students thought the pro
posal went too far in limiting dis
criminatory speech as thought
that the proposal was fair.
