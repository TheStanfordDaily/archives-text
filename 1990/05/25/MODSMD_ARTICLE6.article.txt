# Prankster hasn't found what he's looking for
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Editorial staff 
For some, public service is a
lofty pursuit that requires a
serious attitude. And then there's
Perry Friedman.
During his four years at Stan
ford, Friedman has been, in his
words, "a Renaissance man." He's
belonged to the Chaparral staff
and the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council; he's appeared in The
Daily for his role in causing a
recall election of this year's Coun
cil of Presidents-elect and for forg
ing the top Draw number.
And the motivation for his
seemingly paradoxical behavior?
"Babes," he says."I want
babes."
At first, it seems he's kidding;
kidding is what he does best. But
some think his politics are no
laughing matter, including Fried
man himself.
He says: "I've fallen into the
problem of being a political activ
ist and taking school seriously, so
I have to equalize it out by having
some fun and trying to add some
levity to Stanford."
Though many view him as a
prankster, Friedman ran for the
SCLC out of a commitment to
free speech. Once elected, he was
a vocal opponent of the recently
adopted proposal, fearing it would
infringe on that right.
"I don't like to be taken
seriously most of the time, but I
try to make it obvious when I'm
really trying to be serious," he
says. "Subtlety is not one of my
finer traits."
A coterminal student in com
puter science, Friedman says
Stanford has been experiencing a
"three-year anal-retentive slide,"
with all aspects of campus life
affected, from politics to sporting
events.

'I did get a recall,
but I still haven't
gotten a woman.'

"College is supposed to be fun.
These are the most carefree days
of your lives, and you've got to
make them count," Friedman
says. "Right now, I think Stanford
has a stick so far up its ass it
can't even see straight."
With that in mind, Friedman
organized Students United for
Fair Elections, an organization
that lobbied for a run-off in the
close race between contending
COP slates. Friedman then spear
headed a successful petition drive
for a recall election.
The recall election is scheduled
for June 4 and 5. But somehow,
Friedman doesn't seem com
pletely happy.
"I did get a recall, but I still
haven't gotten a woman," he la
ments. "Which do you think would
be easier: getting 2,000 signatures
to get a recall of an election and
to overthrow a government, or to
find a woman?"
But Friedman is still wary of
what might happen in the upcom
ing election.
"Right now, things are still a
little bit too quiet for my liking,"
he says. "People really don't seem
that upset or all that enraged in
any one direction."
Although he was instrumental
in causing the recall, Friedman
doesn't plan to play a big part in
campaigning to recall the COP
elect.
"My strategy is to not do a
whole lot of work," he says. "I'm
hoping that Students First runs
with the ball and takes control."
