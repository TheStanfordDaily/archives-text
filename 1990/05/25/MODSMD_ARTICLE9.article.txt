# Environmental program on the horizon
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Students may soon have another academic
option if the University implements a current
proposal to create an interdisciplinary envi
ronmental program, Earth Systems.
"Earth Systems refers to the coupled
geological, biological and social processes that
are taking place ... on the planet. Under
standing these processes contributes to de
signing effective environmental policy, and to
reconciling competing environmental and so
cial objectives," wrote Biological Sciences Prof.
Jonathan Roughgarden in a preliminary Earth
Systems program proposal.
To institute such a diverse program, the
proposal calls for faculty participation from
six areas: the earth sciences, biological sciences
and engineering areas, as well as the Institute
for International Studies, Stanford Research
Institute and STAR Lab.
The Earth Systems program will also draw
experts from off-campus sources, including

NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, to join
its faculty.
The proposed undergraduate mtyor consists
of 24 courses, featuring an emphasis in earth
sciences, biological sciences, economics and
policy analysis or environmental engineering.
The will also require many math and
science courses, three electives and a senior
project.
The Earth Systems proposal also outlines
a coterminal program and a master's program,
with a doctoral program to be developed in
the future.
Students will support the Earth Systems
program, predicted geology graduate student
Steve Chambers, citing about 200 students
involved in the Stanford University Project
for Environmental Research as evidence of
student interest in environmental studies.
In addition, Chambers said a May 15 meet
ing "to rally student support for the program
went very well."
Although enthusiastic faculty and students

are obvious prerequisites for a successful
Earth Systems program, implementation of
the proposal will require financial support as
well. A May 4 memorandum from Gary Ernst,
dean of the School of Earth Sciences, explained
the program is currently sponsored by the
School of Earth Sciences and "funded by it
on a shoestring."
However, Ernst expressed confidence that
Earth Systems "can evolve toward a regular
department" after gaining further support
from the science and engineering communi
ties.
According to Chambers, the first steps
toward this long-term goal can be taken when
the program itself is finalized and subse
quently approved by the Faculty Senate and
University administration.
In the meantime, although the Earth Sys
tems program will not be included in next
year's "Courses and Degrees," Chambers sug
gested interested students should contact the
School of Earth Sciences next fall for infor
mation on requirements for the m^jor.
