# Gorbachev deletes Hoover from Stanford itinerary
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Senior staff writer 
. Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev will not visit the Hoover
Institution when he comes to
Stanford June 4, Soviet officials
announced yesterday.
Gorbachev's advance team can
celed his stop at Hoover "because
of the tight timing" of his Stan
ford itinerary, according to Robert
Freelen, Stanford vice president
for public affairs.
The Soviet advance team has
opted instead for a visit to the
Stanford Art Gallery, where Gor
bachev will accept two works of
art as "gifts for the Soviet people,"
said a spokesperson for the PBN
Company, which is handling
media arrangements for the visit.
Soviet Consul General Valentin
Kamenev "called and told me that
they had been reviewing the
schedule," Freelen said. "They felt
it was too tight and that they
were not going to Hoover." The
University had originally pro
posed that Gorbachev spend 20
minutes at the Hoover Institu
tion, Freelen said.
"We're very disappointed," said
University President Donald Ken
nedy. "I think that would have
been an exciting and interesting
stop for him." The Hoover Ar
chives house many rare Soviet
documents and photographs.
Nevertheless, the proposed
itinerary for Gorbachev's visit was
a bit crowded, Kennedy said.
"We've been working with them
very closely all along. We've of
fered them a little more than they
can do, and we expect them to
make choices," Kennedy said.
Hoover Director John Raisian
said he "would not like to spec
ulate" on why the Soviets dropped
their plans for a visit to Hoover
in favor of a visit to the gallery.
Kennedy denied that the
Soviets' choice to eliminate the
Hoover visit was influenced by a
recent letter to Gorbachev by Po
litical Science Prof. John Manley.

In a letter sent last week to the
Kremlin and the Soviet Embassy
in Washington, D.C., Manley
urged Gorbachev not to visit Hoo
ver.
"I don't know if my letter had
anything to do with it or not,"
said Manley. "But clearly [Gor
bachev's] visit was being used by
Hoover, and if he's canceled his
visit, then I think it's fair to say
that Hoover has shot itself in the
foot."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
did not believe that Manley's let
ter influenced the Soviet decision
to cancel the Hoover visit. But

whatever the cause of the deci
sion, he said, "I'm delighted that
Gorbachev's going to the Art
Gallery rather than the Hoover
Institution."
Freelen admitted that "people
will obviously want to speculate"
that Manley's letter influenced the
Soviet delegation's decision. "But
several members of the (Soviet)
advance party from Moscow have
noted that they're accustomed to
dealing with letters of opinion
from all facets of many issues,
and they can take that (Manley's
letter) in stride," Freelen said.
During a visit to Stanford last

Friday, Soviet Chief of Protocol
Vladimir Cherneshev told The
Daily he did not think Gorbachev
was bothered by the anti-
Communist "mission" of the Hoo
ver Institution. "I'm aware of its
high reputation, and I respect this
studying center," Cherneshev said
through a translator.
"And I don't think the subjects
are taught here too tenaciously;
I think they're objectively taught
here," Cherneshev added.
According to Freelen, Chernes
hev is responsible for making all
the "detail decisions" surrounding
Gorbachev's visit.
