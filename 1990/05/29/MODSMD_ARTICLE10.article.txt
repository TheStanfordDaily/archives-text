# Brokaw gives audience laughs and challenges

### Janine De Fao Editorial staff 
From the deep South in 1964
to Czechoslovakia in 1990, from
Gorbachev to Mandela, from the
role of education in our society
to the role of television, NBC
News anchor Tom Brokaw gave
his "impressions of our world" to

a standing-room-only crowd in
Annenberg Auditorium Friday.
Brokaw, whose daughter grad
uated from Stanford two years
ago, used his familiarity with both
the University and the world to
engage the audience in a some
times jocular, sometimes solemn,
address.
Referring to Soviet President

Mikhail Gorbachev's upcoming
visit, Brokaw began his speech, "I
don't know how they settled on
Stanford. Gorbachev said he
wanted to visit with some of
America's underclass. I think it
got lost in the translation." He
added Gorbachev would go back
to the Kremlin and tell his ad
visers, "We've got a long way to

go!"
On a more serious note, he ad
dressed the rapid changes in the
world, from Eastern Europe to
South Africa. "Your time, 1990,
is a time of transition, of explo
sive, cataclysmic, exhilarating
change," he said.
Brokaw quoted Czechoslovak
ian President Vaclav Havel's in
augural address, saying, "Above
all, man is never merely a product
of the world around him. He is
always capable of striving for
something higher no matter how
systematically his ability is
ground down by the world that
exists around him."
This lesson for Czechoslovakia
is a message for our time as well,
Brokaw said. We have a respon
sibility to these newly arising de
mocracies, he said.
"It begins here in a lot of ways,
with your Stanford education,"
Brokaw said. "You are educated,
we trust, and the certification will
be in your degree. A lot of you
think of it as the ticket to the
good life. Why not think of it in
another way, especially in the
closing years of the 20th century?
Why not think of it as a ticket to
join the democratic revolution
that is going on around the
world?" he asked.
"What do you think a young
South African would do with your

education, or a young Czech, or
a young Chinese or Nicaraguan?"
Brokaw continued.
"What you have here is a na
tional resource," he said.
He also expressed concern that
we are cutting away a "comnjon
ground" of dialogue between
races.
"Racism, whatever its colora
tion, is no less than a form of
despotism, and it has no place
anywhere," he said, adding thfere
is an emerging pattern of racism
in our society.
"There must be a coalition of
conscience, and this is a moral as
well as a political imperative. We
must listen to each other and hot
just talk at each other," Brokaw
said.
Public education, he said, is one
way in which we can take a stand.
It is the great common ground,
Brokaw said.
"Public education is the engine
that moves us as a society toward
a common destiny. It is in
desparate need of overhaul and
rigid maintenance," he added.
"It is in public education that
the American dream begins to
take place," he said. But for a
number of "disconnected"
children who "live in a universe
without a support system . . . the
American dream is not difficult
to achieve; it does not exist."
