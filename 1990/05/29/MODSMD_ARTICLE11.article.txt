Arab League summit opens
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — President Saddam
Hussein, opening a two-day Arab League sum
mit, said yesterday that if Israel deployed nu
clear or chemical weapons against Arabs, Iraq
would respond with "weapons of mass destruc
tion."
Also speaking to the 15 kings, sheiks and
presidents, Jordan's King Hussein urged Arabs
to use their oil wealth to influence world pol
itics.
The conference was called as a show of Arab
unity against what Saddam has said is a West
ern and Israeli campaign against Iraq. The
summit was also to seek ways to stem the
large-scale emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.
"The potentials of any Arab nation have to
be in the service of all Arabs to safeguard
national security," Saddam said.
IRA mistakenly kills two
ROERMOND, Netherlands (AP) — The Irish
Republican Army said yesterday its gunmen
shot to death two Australian lawyers on va
cation in the Netherlands after they "tragically
mistook" them for British soldiers.
The two 24-year-old victims were ambushed
Sunday night after returning to their car fol
lowing a meal in an Italian restaurant.
"The IRA accepts responsibility for the
deaths," said an IRA statement released in
Dublin yesterday."The active service unit in
volved tragically mistook the men for two
British Army personnel. The IRA deeply
regrets this tragedy."
The statement did not explain how the mis
take was made. However, Dutch television said
police believed the attackers were confused by
British license plates on the Australians' car.
Solidarity gains in Polish vote
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Officials yester
day began adding up the results of the first
free elections to local councils since World War
11, and Solidarity claimed decisive victories in
Warsaw and elsewhere.
Candidates from more than 80 parties on
Sunday competed in 52,000 races nationwide,
a vote that aroused the interest of less than
half the electorate. Official results were to be
announced tomorrow.
The pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza
said preliminary tallies indicated candidates
of the Solidarity Citizens Committee had won
big victories nearly everywhere.
Pinochet ordered out of politics
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — President
Patricio Aylwin summoned former military
ruler Augusto Pinochet to the government
palace yesterday, ordered him to hand over
secret police records and told him the army
must stay out of politics.
Pinochet, who remains army commander,
was forced to walk a gantlet of demonstrators
shouting "murderer!" and other insults when
his armored car was denied entrance at the
palace gate. Visibly furious, he complained
about the treatment to a police guard.
Inside, he met privately with Aylwin and
Defense Minister Patrico Rojas for an hour.
