PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) - The
bodies of five American servicemen
killed nearly 40 years ago in the
Korean War were returned to their
countrymen yesterday in an emotional
Memorial Day ceremony marking
them heroes.
Five brown caskets and five small
boxes containing buttons, dog tags,
boots and pieces of uniforms were
turned over to eight U.S. congressmen
by communist North Korea, the enemy
in the war.
It was the first return of U.S.
Korean War dead from the North since
1954. More than 8,000 Americans
from the 1950-53 conflict are still un
accounted for.
U.S. Rep. Ben Campbell, D-Colo.,
peered down at one of the caskets as
it was opened ceremoniously to be
checked and saw a skeleton beneath a
white silk cloth.
"All I could think was that one or
two of these unidentified might have
been one or two of my friends," said
Campbell, who served 13 months in
Korea in the Air Force.
The return of the remains is widely
seen as a gesture by North Korea to
improve relations with the United
States. The two countries do not have
diplomatic relations.
U.S. military officials said the re
mains would be flown Tuesday to
Hickam Air Base in Hawaii for a hero's
welcome and the painstaking process
of identification, which could take
several months.
Pallbearers in suits and ties, wearing
white gloves and lapel pins of North
Korean leader Kim II Sung, handed
the caskets over to the congressional
delegation in the truce village of Pan
munjom inside the Demilitarized Zone
separating the two Koreas.
The caskets were draped with blue
flags of the United Nations, the flag

under which American forces fought
in Korea. An Army chaplain read a
prayer saying "we have come to take
them home to family and friends, to
a hero's welcome."
Several old soldiers wept.
The transfer came after Rep. G.V.
"Sonny" Montgomery, D-Miss., chair
man of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, signed a document with
North Korea confirming he received
the remains.
"This is a historic occasion . . .
recognition for Americans who fought
in Korea, recognition that has not
come for 40 years," Montgomery said.
He said the United States hoped
more remains would be returned.
Americans discounted speculation
there might be American prisoners
still alive in North Korea, saying both
Soviet and North Korean diplomats
had assured them it was untrue.
"I feel happiness, sadness, bitter
ness," said Lt. Col. Don Byers, the
last active duty servicemen stationed
in Korea who fought in the war. "I
want to know where the rest are. Why
five? Why not 500?"
The American-led United Nations
Command in Seoul says 33,629 U.S.
soldiers were killed and 103,284
wounded in the war. More than 2 mil
lion Koreans were killed.
The Command includes the United
States and 15 other nations that
fought on South Korea's side after
North Korean forces invaded across
the 38th parallel dividing the Korean
Peninsula on June 25, 1950.
The remains of the five returned
yesterday were unearthed in 1987 and
are those of two U.S. Air Force mem
bers and three Army members. All
five were believed to have been pris
oners of war and died in Hwanghae
Pukto province south of North Korea's
capital of Pyongyang.
