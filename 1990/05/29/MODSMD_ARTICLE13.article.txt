Storms soak LA
LOS ANGELES (AP) - An un
seasonable rainstorm dumped record
rain Monday on southern California,
which is in the fourth year of a
drought, snarling traffic and contri
buting to two deaths.
But the rain came too late to help
with the drought. Warm weather •vriil
cause it largely to evaporate rather
than percolate into the soil.
The storm dropped an inch of rain
on Los Angeles, the National Weather
Service said.
Bush previews summit
KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP)
— President Bush said yesterday that
Mikhail Gorbachev is "pretty darn

strong" despite economic woes plagu
ing the Soviet Union. But Bush vir
tually closed the door on giving Mos
cow trade benefits during summit
talks this week.

arms to welcome the president of the
Soviet Union," Bush said, winding
up four days of vacation to return
to Washington for talks beginning

FBI bids on a winner
BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - An un
dercover horse the FBI used to in
vestigate race-fixing at Finger Lakes
Race Track won at least one race
and finished strongly in others —
much to the agents' surprise.
The bureau bought the horse

thinking it would perform badly and
could become involved in a scheme
to fix races, but the horse ran con
sistently well during the 1989 racing
season, said Special Agent Dale An
derson.
"I can say he won at least one race
and placed in about half of his races.
The FBI did quite well with him.
The bureau made enough money to
offset the costs of upkeep," about
$1,000 a month, Anderson told The
Buffalo News.
Surgical fire kills patient
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Sheets
covering a patient caught fire during
surgery yesterday, filling an operat
ing room with smoke so thick that
staff members couldn't extinguish

the flames. The patient died.
"The sheets just caught on fire.
It's bizarre," said Fire Department
spokesman Pat Marek.
Investigators were seeking the
cause of the fire at the sprawling
UCLA Medical Center on the campus
of the University of California, Los
Angeles, Marek said.
An autopsy was ordered io deter
mine the cause of death of the pa
tient, 26-year-old Angela Hernandez,
who had been undergoing surgery
for injuries suffered in an automobile
accident, said campus spokeswoman
Vicki Beck.
It was not immediately known if
Hernandez died because of the fire
and smoke, her injuries or a combi
nation of the two.
