Proposed phone system
may limit options and
rights of all students

THE UNIVERSITY'S pro
posed phone system is still
under fire from graduate
students, but this time the com
plaints go beyond claims of inef
ficiency and unfairness.
Three students are challenging
the system on legal grounds, saying
the University does not have the
right to limit a person's choice of
long-distance carriers to one.
Graduate students have given
the University much feedback on
the new system, and some changes
have been made in response to
their concerns.
But many feel that they have
not had significant input in the
proposals and that the changes
which have been made have not
gone far enough.
The initiative of the three stu
dents who are challenging the Uni
versity should be applauded. The
fact that the University may be
violating California Public Utilities
Commission guidelines is disturb
ing and must be explored.
If the Commission finds the Uni
versity is covered by its guidelines
— that "the property owner or
manager shall place no restrictions
on tenants which desire service di

rectly from the telephone utility
in addition to or in lieu of service
furnished by the provider" — then
Stanford must cooperate with this
finding.
Even if the University is not
found to be in violation of any
laws, it may want to rethink
aspects of the system before push
ing its June 21 starting date.
Graduate students are still dis
gruntled for legitimate reasons.
They are not "temporary" resi
dents — like many undergraduates
— and the system provides less
benefits for them.
Undergraduates, too, may be ad
versely affected by the system. In
addition to not having a choice of
long-distance carriers, all students
may face the problem of having
their registration placed on hold
due to late phone bills.
In an era of supposed "stream
lining," is it efficient to link phone
billing with registration?
The debate over the phone sys
tem may be a precedent-setting
case, as many universities already
have such systems in place and
there has not been such dissent in
other places.
Nationwide there seems to be a
trend of universities adopting their
own phone systems, but Stanford
may not be joining it. There has
been little student support for this
initiative, which the University
should continue to take into con
sideration as we move closer to the
phone system becoming an irrever
sible reality.
