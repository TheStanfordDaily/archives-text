## League's tactics have damaged MEChA, community 
### 
I WAS ASKED TO JOIN the
League of Revolutionary Struggle
during the fall quarter of my soph
omore year. The person who recruited
me explained the League ideology to
me and told me that if I "reasoned
well enough," I would conclude that
socialism was the logical progression
for my "politics."
This individual told me a personal
tale of League involvement and ex
plained why the League's "struggle"
would "liberate our people." The per
son went on to ask me to come to the
study groups. I said I would think
about it, which I did, before I said no.
I explained how honored I felt at being
asked to join such an elite club, but I
was not a socialist, not a revolutionary,
so basically ... no thanks.
I was co-chair of Stanford MEChA at
the time. Little did I know that by
turning down the League's gracious
invitation, I virtually relinquished all
power I had within MEChA. For the
rest of the year, I was excluded from
important decisions and left unin
formed about events. For example, I,
like most of the MEChA membership,
had no knowledge of the takeover of
University President Donald Kennedy's
office until the night before it hap
pened. (MEChA is notorious for work
ing through undemocratic means —
like Central American elections, you
can vote but they tell you what and
who to vote, for and why — or else.)
Moreover, the friendship between my
recruiter and myself deteriorated really
quickly.
This was a year and a half ago. Ever
since, I have heard that I was a bad
co-chair because I refused to join the
League and "(I) wouldn't even go to
the study group#." A drunken League
member approached me at a party
with the accusation that I was "too
much of an individual." (He was obvi
ously spouting League rhetoric that
forever and unquestionably favors the

collective over the individual.) He
meant it as an insult and, at the time,
I took it as such. Now I know better.
During all of this year, I was caught
in a bind between two equally unap
pealing options: I could either protect
the League by keeping its secret and
letting MEChA fall to pieces as more
and more people became alienated by
the radical League agenda in MEChA,
or I could attack the League and
MEChA in the process. I couldn't do
either, so I decided to do nothing at
all.
I took a noted absence from MEChA.
I contemplated the problems with the
League and the information I stumbled
upon over the summer about its in
filtration of the MEChA statewide
network. But I couldn't talk openly
about it; I had been told not to ask
any questions, not to tell anybody. 1
felt severely alienated from almost
everybody in my community: the reac
tionary anti-MEChA elements and the
manipulative League members who
thought they had cornered the Chicano
progressive movement. I can honestly
say it was one of the darkest periods
in my life.
I agonized over the decision to talk
to The Daily, but I did it. I didn't
have the courage to go on the record. I
was afraid of the harassment I knew
the League was capable of (the exam
ple of Juan Iniguez' expulusion from
the deanship of El Centro Chicano
comes to mind).
But now I kind of have to go on the
record, so this is what I am reporting:
the League's infiltration, the "outside
agitators" (non-students who still play

hold on MEChA and dissent is so stifled that... reform

key roles in Stanford student politics),
their crafty recruiting tactics, the fact
that they stifle dissent and the secrecy
that shields them. I don't want to
indict them for their ideology. I believe
in academic freedom, and I respect
their right to be Marxist.
Because the left has historically been
persecuted in our society, any time any
one of us decides to speak out against
the left we run the risk of seeming
like red-baiters. This very fact
paralyzed me and many others for
years, and it also granted the League
virtual immunity from criticism. Any
thing that challenged the League's
agenda, whether it be from the left or
the right, was labeled "racist, fascist,
red-baiters" or some other sweeping
term. Character assassination is the
League's favorite tactic.
My intention is not to damage the
multicultural movement, but I know
that inevitably it will be damaged.
Anyone who knows me knows that 1
support the progressive agenda. I
believe that people of color are eco
nomically, politically and socially mar
ginalized, that the power structure will
not change out of it's own volition and
that I must do as much as I can to
help change it.
I believe this because I was raised in
the biggest barrio in the United States:
East Los Angeles — Chicano Mecca. I
have been studying Chicano scholarship
since I was 12 years old. I am not
going through my college radical phase;
this is my life, and it is part of the
reason why the revolutionary rhetoric
doesn't appeal to me. Try telling "the
people" that you advocate revolution

on their behalf — it's silly.
People will ask me if I am doing this
because I have personal gripes with
League members. Let me put it this
way: When people befriend you, make
you co-chair of MEChA as an inexperi
enced sophomore because they think
they can manipulate you and then
proceed to screw you over when you
decide not to join their cult, you feel
used and hurt . . . very personally.
But that is not the reason I am
exposing the League. I am doing this
because the League has such a strong
hold on MEChA, and dissent is so
stifled that disagreement is not
tolerated and reform from within is
impossible.
This should be a time of introspec
tion for both the Chicano community
and for all those who claim to believe
in the progressive agenda. A friend of
mine put it well when he said that the
healing process should involve dialogue
between non-League and League mem
bers, but this can not happen until the
League decides to be up front with us
— just stop lying.
Lastly, I want to respond to the
charge that criticizing the League in
public has hurt the progressive agenda.
I am sensitive to the fact that we are
strongest when united and that airing
our dirty laundry threatens that unity;
nevertheless I think that being radical
is to be constantly rethinking and
re-analyzing.
Unity is most important when we
are a small fringe group fighting the
power structure. But in Stanford's
student politics, the "Progressive
Agenda" has managed to become a
part of the power structure. In
MEChA the League has gained so
much power that it silences much
needed criticism, and I for one have
kept its secrets long enough.

key roles in Stanford student politics),
their crafty recruiting tactics, the fact
that they stifle dissent and the secrecy
that shields them. I don't want to
indict them for their ideology. I believe
in academic freedom, and I respect
their right to be Marxist.
Because the left has historically been
persecuted in our society, any time any
one of us decides to speak out against
the left we run the risk of seeming
like red-baiters. This very fact
paralyzed me and many others for
years, and it also granted the League
virtual immunity from criticism. Any
thing that challenged the League's
agenda, whether it be from the left or
the right, was labeled "racist, fascist,
red-baiters" or some other sweeping
term. Character assassination is the
League's favorite tactic.
My intention is not to damage the
multicultural movement, but I know
that inevitably it will be damaged.

support the progressive agenda. I
believe that people of color are eco
nomically, politically and socially mar
ginalized, that the power structure will
not change out of it's own volition and
that I must do as much as I can to
help change it.
I believe this because I was raised in
the biggest barrio in the United States:
East Los Angeles — Chicano Mecca. I
have been studying Chicano scholarship
since I was 12 years old. I am not
going through my college radical phase;
this is my life, and it is part of the
reason why the revolutionary rhetoric
doesn't appeal to me. Try telling "the
people" that you advocate revolution

on their behalf — it's silly.
People will ask me if I am doing this
because I have personal gripes with
League members. Let me put it this
way: When people befriend you, make
you co-chair of MEChA as an inexperi
enced sophomore because they think
they can manipulate you and then
proceed to screw you over when you
decide not to join their cult, you feel
used and hurt . . . very personally.
But that is not the reason I am
exposing the League. I am doing this
because the League has such a strong
hold on MEChA, and dissent is so
stifled that disagreement is not
tolerated and reform from within is
impossible.
This should be a time of introspec
tion for both the Chicano community
and for all those who claim to believe
in the progressive agenda. A friend of
mine put it well when he said that the
healing process should involve dialogue
between non-League and League mem
bers, but this can not happen until the
League decides to be up front with us
— just stop lying.
Lastly, I want to respond to the
charge that criticizing the League in
public has hurt the progressive agenda.
I am sensitive to the fact that we are
strongest when united and that airing
our dirty laundry threatens that unity;
nevertheless I think that being radical
is to be constantly rethinking and
re-analyzing.
Unity is most important when we
are a small fringe group fighting the
power structure. But in Stanford's
student politics, the "Progressive
Agenda" has managed to become a
part of the power structure. In
MEChA the League has gained so
much power that it silences much
needed criticism, and I for one have
kept its secrets long enough.

MEChA co-chair 1988-89
I WAS ASKED TO JOIN the
League of Revolutionary Struggle
during the fall quarter of my soph
omore year. The person who recruited
me explained the League ideology to
me and told me that if I "reasoned
well enough," I would conclude that
socialism was the logical progression
for my "politics."
This individual told me a personal
tale of League involvement and ex
plained why the League's "struggle"
would "liberate our people." The per
son went on to ask me to come to the
study groups. I said I would think
about it, which I did, before I said no.
I explained how honored I felt at being
asked to join such an elite club, but I
was not a socialist, not a revolutionary,
so basically ... no thanks.
I was co-chair of Stanford MEChA at
the time. Little did I know that by
turning down the League's gracious
invitation, I virtually relinquished all
power I had within MEChA. For the
rest of the year, I was excluded from
important decisions and left unin
formed about events. For example, I,
like most of the MEChA membership,
had no knowledge of the takeover of
University President Donald Kennedy's
office until the night before it hap
pened. (MEChA is notorious for work
ing through undemocratic means —
like Central American elections, you
can vote but they tell you what and
who to vote, for and why — or else.)
Moreover, the friendship between my
recruiter and myself deteriorated really
quickly.
This was a year and a half ago. Ever
since, I have heard that I was a bad
co-chair because I refused to join the
League and "(I) wouldn't even go to
the study group#." A drunken League
member approached me at a party
with the accusation that I was "too
much of an individual." (He was obvi
ously spouting League rhetoric that
forever and unquestionably favors the

collective over the individual.) He
meant it as an insult and, at the time,
I took it as such. Now I know better.
During all of this year, I was caught
in a bind between two equally unap
pealing options: I could either protect
the League by keeping its secret and
letting MEChA fall to pieces as more
and more people became alienated by
the radical League agenda in MEChA,
or I could attack the League and
MEChA in the process. I couldn't do
either, so I decided to do nothing at
all.
I took a noted absence from MEChA.
I contemplated the problems with the
League and the information I stumbled
upon over the summer about its in
filtration of the MEChA statewide
network. But I couldn't talk openly
about it; I had been told not to ask
any questions, not to tell anybody. 1
felt severely alienated from almost
everybody in my community: the reac
tionary anti-MEChA elements and the
manipulative League members who
thought they had cornered the Chicano
progressive movement. I can honestly
say it was one of the darkest periods
in my life.
I agonized over the decision to talk
to The Daily, but I did it. I didn't
have the courage to go on the record. I
was afraid of the harassment I knew
the League was capable of (the exam
ple of Juan Iniguez' expulusion from
the deanship of El Centro Chicano
comes to mind).
But now I kind of have to go on the
record, so this is what I am reporting:
