## Self-determination for all 
### 
Dear mr. Gorbachev:
It is a particular honor that you
have chosen to visit Stanford Uni
versity when there are so many other
cities and universities worthy of your
attention. I would like to encourage you
to see Stanford as a university typical of
all of the top American universities. See
it not as an institution which provides
the managers and scientists for American
industry, but as a place where the values
of freedom of speech, freedom of conduct
and freedom of thought are most easily
expressed.
Our hope, as symbolized by this sum
mit meeting with President Bush, is that
our two countries will continue to come
closer together. It is said that this past
year has marked the end of the Cold War.
But only until we turn our weapons away
from each other and cease to see each
other as adversaries will the peace treaty
to this nearly 50-year-old war be signed.
Great strides have already been made,
and they have come in large part from
your willingness to reject the Cold War
mentalities of your predecessors and to
embrace a "new thinking."
Your hopes and vision for a new world
order have captured the imagination of
peoples on every continent. In 1988, you
stated in front of the U.N. General As
sembly that the use or threat of force
was no longer a legitimate instrument of
state policy. It is my sincere hope that
this principle will become the actual basis
for your country's foreign policy and the
basis for the foreign policy of all coun
tries.
But only when all the peoples of the
world are able to determine their own

destiny will this ideal become a reality.
Only when the larger, stronger powers
refrain from coercing the smaller, weaker
nations will your vision be realized. It is
only under such a world order that na
tions whose only defense is their moral
strength will be guaranteed their security.
Because you have articulated these
ideals so strongly and clearly, it is now
especially disconcerting that your actions
have fallen far short of your words. The
thinly veiled threats of the Red Army
and the economic blockade directed at
Lithuania are slowly suffocating the dem
ocratic aspirations of the Lithuanian
people.
You have demanded that Lithuania
renounce its declaration of independence
and that it must give way to constitu
tional procedures that do not even exist
yet. Mr. Gorbachev, you have asked that
the Lithuanian people's hopes for inde
pendence be put off for at least five years
and be subject to a maze of restrictions
and requirements which may never be
met.
One of the great jurists of our history
once said that "justice long delayed is
justice denied." The people of the Baltic
republics, after having been forcibly an
nexed over 50 years ago, now can only
expect more complications and indefinite
delays. They are beginning to believe that
their justice may be forever delayed and
forever denied.
It is said that these aspirations for
self-determination, unless silenced, rep
resent an unassailable barrier for your
reforms. We support your reforms. We
support perestroika, your plan for eco

nomic restructuring and rejuvenation, be
cause it promises to improve the
well-being of your people.
However, glasnost, the plan for the
political and social rejuvenation of your
people, is the reform which is closest to
our hearts because it comes closest to
expressing the values and ideals found
in our Bill of Rights and Declaration of
Independence.
Therefore, Mr. Gorbachev, 1 am
troubled and somewhat skeptical that
your desire for democracy and greater
freedom can be subverted by these same
aspirations as expressed by the people of
the Baltic republics. If your reforms are
to truly succeed, they cannot be based
upon fear and intimidation.
Injustice now cannot purchase justice
later. And injustice in the Baltics cannot
purchase justice for the rest of the Soviet
Union.
Mr. Gorbachev, while we applaud the
rapprochement that has taken place be
tween the United States and your inter
nal reforms, these cannot be bought at
the price of the Baltics' independence.
