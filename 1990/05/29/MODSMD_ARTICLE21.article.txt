## Progress requires the freedom to question 
### 
THE DAILY'S recent coverage of
the League of Revolutionary
Struggle has come under heavy
fire during the past week and a half,
both from the outside community and
from within the Daily staff.
Several members of the Stanford
community and a few members of the
Daily staff have labeled the coverage
"McCarthyist" and "racist," have ac
cused The Daily of harboring an
agenda antithetical to multiculturalism,
and have called for punitive measures
ranging from a half-page apology from
myself to a yearlong suspension of the
reporter who worked on the stories.
Given the intense questioning of our
actions over the past several days, I
thought it would be an appropriate
time to offer a few thoughts on the
role The Stanford Daily should be
playing in the Stanford community,
and to respond to some of the criti
cisms The Daily has received regarding
our coverage of the League.
A number of those who have written
letters to The Daily have said the
articles on the League of Revolutionary
Struggle constitute McCarthyist attacks
on particular individuals who are
leading progressive change at Stanford.
Quite frankly, The Daily is neither
leading nor collaborating in an effort
to weed out and purge political "radi
cals" or "subversives'' from our student
government. Rather, The Daily has
brought to light the presence of a
nationwide organization which many
credible individuals say is playing an
important but little-known role in
student politics on campus.
Whether or not concealing member
ship in such an organization is consis
tent with the standards of openness
and honesty mandated by this commu
nity is an issue which the community
ultimately must decide for itself. By
running stories on the League, The
Daily has only served to facilitate
discussion on that issue.
That the group in question is a
Marxist-Leninist organization naturally
leaves The Daily open to charges of
McCarthyism. We were prepared for
that, though perhaps not to the degree
that it has occurred.
The stories, however, would have
been written and pursued with the
same vigor had the organization been
of any ideological stripe. The real
significance of the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle, from the standpoint
of why it deserves coverage, is not the

politics it advocates, but the degree of
influence many students involved in
campus politics say it exercises at
Stanford and the effects that influence
carries with it.
Through my work over the past few
years as a Daily reporter and editor, I
have had the opportunity to get to
know several of those mentioned in
our stories not only as news subjects,
but on a much more human level as
well. Let me make it clear that the
stories about the League are by no
means an effort to discredit these
individuals or their many positive
contributions to Stanford. The individ
uals mentioned in the stories are, for
the most part, good people with noble
intentions and unwavering devotion to
bringing about their vision of a more
just society.
The stories are, however, intended to
provoke discussion regarding the
reasons for their concealing member
ship in an organization which many
individuals have told The Daily is
shaping student politics on campus.
Thus, it is not at all hypocritical for
the editorial board of this paper to
condemn the smear tactics used by
Tom Terrell in the flier he distributed
which attacks Gordon Chang, while at
the same time stand behind our inves
tigation of the League of Revolutionary
Struggle. Terrell's flier was a horrid
attempt to discredit Chang as an
individual and a scholar. The Daily's
stories were the starting point for an
assessment of the influence of an
organization.
The fundamental issue at hand is
the accountability of our student gov
ernment and student organization
leaders. If an off-campus organization
is playing a significant role in shaping
student-government policy, then it
would seem our leaders who are associ
ated with the outside organization
should acknowledge the fact.
That the outside organization is
Marxist-Leninist in ideology does make
the hesitancy of individuals to ac
knowledge their membership under
standable. To an unsettling degree, the
world outside Campus Drive is still
very hostile to those who profess
communist sympathies.
Whether or not our leaders should
be excused from such a level of ac
countability because the organization
to which they belong is one of Marxist-
Leninist ideology is perhaps open to
debate.

I fear that at Stanford
we have found it
much easier to dis
credit the messenger
than to examine the
merits of the mes
sage.

Admittedly, the labels of "McCar
thyist" and "racist" that have been
stamped on The Daily's coverage over
the past week have left me quite
disturbed. I am disturbed because I
fear the weapons of those who claim to
hold the moral high-ground on issues
of race and politics have become so
powerful that the careless employment
of these weapons often paralyzes intel
ligent discussion of sensitive issues. I
fear that at Stanford we have found it
much easier to discredit the messenger
than to examine the merits of the
message. It has become much easier to
brand The Daily a "racist, McCar
thyist, irresponsible institution" than
to objectively evaluate information
presented on its news pages that may
cause a great deal of discomfort.
Some have been critical of The
Daily's use of unnamed sources and
have asserted that the stories on the
League were thinly sourced. The
stories which have appeared are based
upon more than 100 interviews with
students, administrators and staff
members, dozens of whom said they
had some degree of familiarity with
the League of Revolutionary Struggle.
Those speaking on the record about
the presence of the League include the
current chair of the Black Student
Union, another current BSU officer,
the former chair of the Asian Ameri
can Student Association, the co-founder
of MEChA (who is also a former Coun
cil of Presidents member), the 1987-88
co-chair of MEChA, the president of
this university, and several students
who were recruited to join the League
by Stanford students or staff members.
The recent claims by some that The
Daily's stories have set the multicul
tural agenda at Stanford back several
years should provide some insight into
the hesitancy of some students to
speak critically about the League. At

Stanford, to question accepted truths
of the multicultural agenda is to stand
in the way of progress, to profess one's
ignorance of the history of racial op
pression in this country, and, if you
are a student of color, to betray your
people. Given the vocal negative reac
tion by some to The Daily's articles on
the League, it should come as little
surprise that few students are willing
to subject themselves personally to
similar charges from within their own
communities. It should come as little
surprise that few students are willing
to be accused of being traitors to their
own race by helping The Daily to
"stigmatize" the communities of color
at Stanford.
Most of The Daily's unnamed
sources are very committed to the
empowerment of people of color, and
many of them share similar political
outlooks as members of the League.
On the opposite page, former MEChA
co-chair Delia Ibarra describes in elo
quent fashion the internal turmoil
faced by many of our unnamed
sources. (In the article which ran May
23, Ibarra was not identified by name.
She has since allowed us to use her
name.)
I am by no means trying to squelch
discussion over the manner in which
The Daily covers particular issues.
Such discussion is certainly appropri
ate. To that end, T have been and
remain willing to engage in an honest
evaluation of the way The Daily has
treated any subject under my volume
with anyone in this community. I am
also willing to acknowledge areas
where The Daily has fallen short of my
expectations or of community stand
ards.
Because The Daily strives to cover
the entire Stanford community as
comprehensively as possible, I think it
is valid to criticize The Daily for over
looking some of the positive contribu
tions students of color have made to
this campus. This year, The Daily has
made some strides in covering the
communities of color more comprehen
sively, but one could certainly build a
reasonable case that the biggest steps
have yet to be taken.
But, that The Daily has not provided
as comprehensive coverage of students
of color on campus as it perhaps could
is not sufficient reason for The Daily
to ignore the presence of the League
on campus.
As an institution, we do not yet

have as diverse a staff as we should,
nor do we have as many students of
color in decision-making positions as I
would find desirable. At the beginning
of my volume, I articulated my belief
that a diverse staff is essential to
comprehensively covering a pluralistic
community. I stand behind that state
ment as much right now as I did then.
Quite honestly, I believe The Daily has
made progress toward pluralism over
the past few months, and much of that
progress will be apparent when my
successor appoints next fall's editorial
staff. Some would argue that such
progress has been painstakingly slow,
and, for the record, I include myself in
that camp.
Let me make sure one point is
perfectly clear: Students of color are
welcome at The Daily, and their contri
butions are valued. I have been and
remain committed to making The Daily
more accessible to all those interested
in journalism, and I have the utmost
confidence in my successor's ability to
build upon this commitment.
Those who have been following the
Opinions pages of The Daily are no
doubt aware that the decision to
publish stories on the League has been
harshly criticized by several Daily staff
members. At the same time, many
others on the staff have been highly
critical of me for allowing The Daily's
dirty laundry to be aired in public.
While public scrutiny of an organiza
tion to which I have poured so much
of my time, energy and heart into is
very painful, I am convinced that my
pain is secondary to the value of open
and honest discussion, and that my
pain is secondary to the future of The
Daily, which I unabashedly believe will
be stronger as a result of the intense
scrutiny.
Likewise, I believe that a multicul
tural Stanford will only become a
reality if we proceed down a path that
allows all members of the community
to question, and question rigorously,
where we are going and who is leading
us there.

leading progressive change at Stanford.
Quite frankly, The Daily is neither
leading nor collaborating in an effort
to weed out and purge political "radi
cals" or "subversives'' from our student
government. Rather, The Daily has
brought to light the presence of a
nationwide organization which many
credible individuals say is playing an
important but little-known role in
student politics on campus.
Whether or not concealing member
ship in such an organization is consis
tent with the standards of openness
and honesty mandated by this commu
nity is an issue which the community
ultimately must decide for itself. By
running stories on the League, The
Daily has only served to facilitate
discussion on that issue.
That the group in question is a
Marxist-Leninist organization naturally
leaves The Daily open to charges of
McCarthyism. We were prepared for
that, though perhaps not to the degree
that it has occurred.
The stories, however, would have
been written and pursued with the
same vigor had the organization been
of any ideological stripe. The real
significance of the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle, from the standpoint
of why it deserves coverage, is not the

politics it advocates, but the degree of
influence many students involved in
campus politics say it exercises at
Stanford and the effects that influence
carries with it.
Through my work over the past few
years as a Daily reporter and editor, I
have had the opportunity to get to
know several of those mentioned in
our stories not only as news subjects,
but on a much more human level as
well. Let me make it clear that the
stories about the League are by no
means an effort to discredit these
individuals or their many positive
contributions to Stanford. The individ
uals mentioned in the stories are, for
the most part, good people with noble
intentions and unwavering devotion to
bringing about their vision of a more
just society.
The stories are, however, intended to
provoke discussion regarding the
reasons for their concealing member
ship in an organization which many
individuals have told The Daily is
shaping student politics on campus.
Thus, it is not at all hypocritical for
the editorial board of this paper to
condemn the smear tactics used by
Tom Terrell in the flier he distributed
which attacks Gordon Chang, while at
the same time stand behind our inves
tigation of the League of Revolutionary
Struggle. Terrell's flier was a horrid
attempt to discredit Chang as an
individual and a scholar. The Daily's
stories were the starting point for an
assessment of the influence of an
organization.
The fundamental issue at hand is
the accountability of our student gov
ernment and student organization
leaders. If an off-campus organization
is playing a significant role in shaping
student-government policy, then it
would seem our leaders who are associ
ated with the outside organization
should acknowledge the fact.
That the outside organization is
Marxist-Leninist in ideology does make
the hesitancy of individuals to ac
knowledge their membership under
standable. To an unsettling degree, the
world outside Campus Drive is still
very hostile to those who profess
communist sympathies.
Whether or not our leaders should
be excused from such a level of ac
countability because the organization
to which they belong is one of Marxist-
Leninist ideology is perhaps open to
debate.

I fear that at Stanford
we have found it
much easier to dis
credit the messenger
than to examine the
merits of the mes
sage.

Admittedly, the labels of "McCar
thyist" and "racist" that have been
stamped on The Daily's coverage over
the past week have left me quite
disturbed. I am disturbed because I
fear the weapons of those who claim to
hold the moral high-ground on issues
of race and politics have become so
powerful that the careless employment
of these weapons often paralyzes intel
ligent discussion of sensitive issues. I
fear that at Stanford we have found it
much easier to discredit the messenger
than to examine the merits of the
message. It has become much easier to
brand The Daily a "racist, McCar
thyist, irresponsible institution" than
to objectively evaluate information
presented on its news pages that may
cause a great deal of discomfort.
Some have been critical of The
Daily's use of unnamed sources and
have asserted that the stories on the
League were thinly sourced. The
stories which have appeared are based
upon more than 100 interviews with
students, administrators and staff
members, dozens of whom said they
had some degree of familiarity with
the League of Revolutionary Struggle.
Those speaking on the record about
the presence of the League include the
current chair of the Black Student
Union, another current BSU officer,
the former chair of the Asian Ameri
can Student Association, the co-founder
of MEChA (who is also a former Coun
cil of Presidents member), the 1987-88
co-chair of MEChA, the president of
this university, and several students
who were recruited to join the League
by Stanford students or staff members.
The recent claims by some that The
Daily's stories have set the multicul
tural agenda at Stanford back several
years should provide some insight into
the hesitancy of some students to
speak critically about the League. At

Stanford, to question accepted truths
of the multicultural agenda is to stand
in the way of progress, to profess one's
ignorance of the history of racial op
pression in this country, and, if you
are a student of color, to betray your
people. Given the vocal negative reac
tion by some to The Daily's articles on
the League, it should come as little
surprise that few students are willing
to subject themselves personally to
similar charges from within their own
communities. It should come as little
surprise that few students are willing
to be accused of being traitors to their
own race by helping The Daily to
"stigmatize" the communities of color
at Stanford.
Most of The Daily's unnamed
sources are very committed to the
empowerment of people of color, and
many of them share similar political
outlooks as members of the League.
On the opposite page, former MEChA
co-chair Delia Ibarra describes in elo
quent fashion the internal turmoil
faced by many of our unnamed
sources. (In the article which ran May
23, Ibarra was not identified by name.
She has since allowed us to use her
name.)
I am by no means trying to squelch
discussion over the manner in which
The Daily covers particular issues.
Such discussion is certainly appropri
ate. To that end, T have been and
remain willing to engage in an honest
evaluation of the way The Daily has
treated any subject under my volume
with anyone in this community. I am
also willing to acknowledge areas
where The Daily has fallen short of my
expectations or of community stand
ards.
Because The Daily strives to cover
the entire Stanford community as
comprehensively as possible, I think it
is valid to criticize The Daily for over
looking some of the positive contribu
tions students of color have made to
this campus. This year, The Daily has
made some strides in covering the
communities of color more comprehen
sively, but one could certainly build a
reasonable case that the biggest steps
have yet to be taken.
But, that The Daily has not provided
as comprehensive coverage of students
of color on campus as it perhaps could
is not sufficient reason for The Daily
to ignore the presence of the League
on campus.
As an institution, we do not yet

have as diverse a staff as we should,
nor do we have as many students of
color in decision-making positions as I
would find desirable. At the beginning
of my volume, I articulated my belief
that a diverse staff is essential to
comprehensively covering a pluralistic
community. I stand behind that state
ment as much right now as I did then.
Quite honestly, I believe The Daily has
made progress toward pluralism over
the past few months, and much of that
progress will be apparent when my
successor appoints next fall's editorial
staff. Some would argue that such
progress has been painstakingly slow,
and, for the record, I include myself in
that camp.
Let me make sure one point is
perfectly clear: Students of color are
welcome at The Daily, and their contri
butions are valued. I have been and
remain committed to making The Daily
more accessible to all those interested
in journalism, and I have the utmost
confidence in my successor's ability to
build upon this commitment.
Those who have been following the
Opinions pages of The Daily are no
doubt aware that the decision to
publish stories on the League has been
harshly criticized by several Daily staff
members. At the same time, many
others on the staff have been highly
critical of me for allowing The Daily's
dirty laundry to be aired in public.
While public scrutiny of an organiza
tion to which I have poured so much
of my time, energy and heart into is
very painful, I am convinced that my
pain is secondary to the value of open
and honest discussion, and that my
pain is secondary to the future of The
Daily, which I unabashedly believe will
be stronger as a result of the intense
scrutiny.
Likewise, I believe that a multicul
tural Stanford will only become a
reality if we proceed down a path that
allows all members of the community
to question, and question rigorously,
where we are going and who is leading
us there.

THE DAILY'S recent coverage of
the League of Revolutionary
Struggle has come under heavy
fire during the past week and a half,
both from the outside community and
from within the Daily staff.
Several members of the Stanford
community and a few members of the
Daily staff have labeled the coverage
"McCarthyist" and "racist," have ac
cused The Daily of harboring an
agenda antithetical to multiculturalism,
and have called for punitive measures
ranging from a half-page apology from
myself to a yearlong suspension of the
reporter who worked on the stories.
Given the intense questioning of our
actions over the past several days, I
thought it would be an appropriate
time to offer a few thoughts on the
role The Stanford Daily should be
playing in the Stanford community,
and to respond to some of the criti

significance of the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle, from the standpoint
of why it deserves coverage, is not the

politics it advocates, but the degree of
influence many students involved in
campus politics say it exercises at
Stanford and the effects that influence
carries with it.
Through my work over the past few
years as a Daily reporter and editor, I
have had the opportunity to get to
know several of those mentioned in
our stories not only as news subjects,
but on a much more human level as
well. Let me make it clear that the
stories about the League are by no
means an effort to discredit these
individuals or their many positive
contributions to Stanford. The individ
uals mentioned in the stories are, for
the most part, good people with noble
intentions and unwavering devotion to
bringing about their vision of a more
just society.
The stories are, however, intended to
provoke discussion regarding the
reasons for their concealing member
ship in an organization which many
individuals have told The Daily is
shaping student politics on campus.
Thus, it is not at all hypocritical for
the editorial board of this paper to
condemn the smear tactics used by
Tom Terrell in the flier he distributed
which attacks Gordon Chang, while at
the same time stand behind our inves
tigation of the League of Revolutionary
Struggle. Terrell's flier was a horrid
attempt to discredit Chang as an
individual and a scholar. The Daily's
stories were the starting point for an
assessment of the influence of an
organization.
The fundamental issue at hand is
the accountability of our student gov
ernment and student organization
leaders. If an off-campus organization
is playing a significant role in shaping
student-government policy, then it
would seem our leaders who are associ
ated with the outside organization
should acknowledge the fact.
That the outside organization is
Marxist-Leninist in ideology does make
the hesitancy of individuals to ac
knowledge their membership under
standable. To an unsettling degree, the
world outside Campus Drive is still
very hostile to those who profess
communist sympathies.
Whether or not our leaders should
be excused from such a level of ac
countability because the organization
to which they belong is one of Marxist-
Leninist ideology is perhaps open to
debate.

I fear that at Stanford
we have found it
much easier to dis
credit the messenger
than to examine the
merits of the mes
sage.

Admittedly, the labels of "McCar
thyist" and "racist" that have been
stamped on The Daily's coverage over
the past week have left me quite
disturbed. I am disturbed because I
fear the weapons of those who claim to
hold the moral high-ground on issues
of race and politics have become so
powerful that the careless employment
of these weapons often paralyzes intel
ligent discussion of sensitive issues. I
fear that at Stanford we have found it
much easier to discredit the messenger
than to examine the merits of the
message. It has become much easier to
brand The Daily a "racist, McCar
thyist, irresponsible institution" than
to objectively evaluate information
presented on its news pages that may
cause a great deal of discomfort.
Some have been critical of The
Daily's use of unnamed sources and
have asserted that the stories on the
League were thinly sourced. The
stories which have appeared are based
upon more than 100 interviews with
students, administrators and staff
members, dozens of whom said they
had some degree of familiarity with
the League of Revolutionary Struggle.
Those speaking on the record about
the presence of the League include the
current chair of the Black Student
Union, another current BSU officer,
the former chair of the Asian Ameri
can Student Association, the co-founder
of MEChA (who is also a former Coun
cil of Presidents member), the 1987-88
co-chair of MEChA, the president of
this university, and several students
who were recruited to join the League
by Stanford students or staff members.
The recent claims by some that The
Daily's stories have set the multicul
tural agenda at Stanford back several
years should provide some insight into
the hesitancy of some students to
speak critically about the League. At

Stanford, to question accepted truths
of the multicultural agenda is to stand
in the way of progress, to profess one's
ignorance of the history of racial op
pression in this country, and, if you
are a student of color, to betray your
people. Given the vocal negative reac
tion by some to The Daily's articles on
the League, it should come as little
surprise that few students are willing
to subject themselves personally to
similar charges from within their own
communities. It should come as little
surprise that few students are willing
to be accused of being traitors to their
own race by helping The Daily to
"stigmatize" the communities of color
at Stanford.
Most of The Daily's unnamed
sources are very committed to the
empowerment of people of color, and
many of them share similar political
outlooks as members of the League.
On the opposite page, former MEChA
co-chair Delia Ibarra describes in elo
quent fashion the internal turmoil
faced by many of our unnamed
sources. (In the article which ran May
23, Ibarra was not identified by name.
She has since allowed us to use her
name.)
I am by no means trying to squelch
discussion over the manner in which
The Daily covers particular issues.
Such discussion is certainly appropri
ate. To that end, T have been and
remain willing to engage in an honest
evaluation of the way The Daily has
treated any subject under my volume
with anyone in this community. I am
also willing to acknowledge areas
where The Daily has fallen short of my
expectations or of community stand
ards.
Because The Daily strives to cover
the entire Stanford community as
comprehensively as possible, I think it
is valid to criticize The Daily for over
looking some of the positive contribu
tions students of color have made to
this campus. This year, The Daily has
made some strides in covering the
communities of color more comprehen
sively, but one could certainly build a
reasonable case that the biggest steps
have yet to be taken.
But, that The Daily has not provided
as comprehensive coverage of students
of color on campus as it perhaps could
is not sufficient reason for The Daily
to ignore the presence of the League
on campus.
As an institution, we do not yet

have as diverse a staff as we should,
nor do we have as many students of
color in decision-making positions as I
would find desirable. At the beginning
of my volume, I articulated my belief
that a diverse staff is essential to
comprehensively covering a pluralistic
community. I stand behind that state
ment as much right now as I did then.
Quite honestly, I believe The Daily has
made progress toward pluralism over
the past few months, and much of that
progress will be apparent when my
successor appoints next fall's editorial
staff. Some would argue that such
progress has been painstakingly slow,
and, for the record, I include myself in
that camp.
Let me make sure one point is
perfectly clear: Students of color are
welcome at The Daily, and their contri
butions are valued. I have been and
remain committed to making The Daily
more accessible to all those interested
in journalism, and I have the utmost
confidence in my successor's ability to
build upon this commitment.
Those who have been following the
Opinions pages of The Daily are no
doubt aware that the decision to
publish stories on the League has been
harshly criticized by several Daily staff
members. At the same time, many
others on the staff have been highly
critical of me for allowing The Daily's
dirty laundry to be aired in public.
While public scrutiny of an organiza
tion to which I have poured so much
of my time, energy and heart into is
very painful, I am convinced that my
pain is secondary to the value of open
and honest discussion, and that my
pain is secondary to the future of The
Daily, which I unabashedly believe will
be stronger as a result of the intense
scrutiny.
Likewise, I believe that a multicul
tural Stanford will only become a
reality if we proceed down a path that
allows all members of the community
to question, and question rigorously,
where we are going and who is leading
us there.
