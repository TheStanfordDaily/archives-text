Ah, The City.
From the day most students ar
rive at Stanford, San Francisco
takes on almost mythical propor
tions. It is no longer "a city." It
is The City, looming large as a
type of haven to the north, a des
tination, a place to escape to, an
urban playground. And after a few
excursions north, the distinction
seems fitting.
There is something about San
Francisco that makes it more than
just a teeming mass of people
struggling to succeed in a dog-eat
dog world. San Francisco has a
grace, a beauty and, it almost
seems, a type of conscience.
Though it may seem odd to think
about a city in this way, there is
something, a collective spirit, that
seems to emanate from the people
who live there.
This collection, "San Francisco
Stories," breathes life into The
City. Selections from poems,
novels and letters have been
brought together from the works
of 28 noted authors who each
viewed The City in their own way.

Some of the authors were oc
casional visitors to San Francisco,
and some lived there most of their
lives. The collection includes let
ters from Dylan Thomas, a poem
by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, an es
say by Czeslaw Milosz and ex
cerpts from Vikram Seth's "The
Golden Gate."
Each author focuses on differ
ent threads that weave together
to make up San Francisco culture.
By choosing writings that span
the past two centuries, John Mil
ler gives the reader some idea of
how San Francisco has changed
over time.
In addition to the literary se
lections, this book also includes
several photographs which com
plement the writings and reveal
some of San Francisco's glory.

have a greater appreciation for
the diverse milieu that is San
Francisco. It is not surprising that
The City has inspired so many
great writers. It is not surprising
that so many great writers have
decided to settle there.
As the editor of this collection
notes, "Living on a fault line is
no easy business." But perhaps it
is this sense of mortality or
fatality which gives San Francisco
its vibrancy and its conscience.
Perhaps it is this sense combined
with the awe-inspiring beauty of
The City and its diverse in
habitants that moves writers who
visit, moves them to write as if
each word could be their last and
as if each sentence must be their
best if they are to capture the
essence of The City.
