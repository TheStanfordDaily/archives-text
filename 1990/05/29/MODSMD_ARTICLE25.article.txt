How was popcorn used in the selection
of materials for re-entry bodies by a local
aerospace company?
Why did the first design of the B-36
bomber wing never get off the ground,
even though it was designed by an "ex
pert" from Stanford University?
The answers to these questions and a
lot more can be found in John Kimball's
book, "Freedom to Soar."
No, this is not another book on
airplanes, though it does describe a num
ber of them. Rather it is a compilation
of mini-vignettes, descriptions of unique
contributions and observations on the
realities of project design distilled from

the variegated experience of a seasoned
design engineer.
Kimball candidly presents a host of
brief case studies that tell how engineer
ing was done in projects he was personally
involved with over his 35-year career as
a design engineer and 12-plus years (in
"retirement") as a part-time volunteer
project coach in mechanical engineering
at Stanford.
The book is written in four parts: Part
1 is a chronological record of some of
Kimball's design adventures, ranging
from aircraft to power tools. Part 2 is a
compilation of media writings and com
mentary on the Challenger Space Shuttle
disaster. Part 3 comprises writings on
the general subject of design. Part 4
presents some reflections on realities in
the design world and "words of wisdom"
to prospective and up-and-cominp en
gineers.

The scope and span of Kimball's career
presented in Part 1 is impressive by itself.
Most of it was spent in aircraft design
during the golden years of the develop
ment of aviation. (He mentions meeting
Orville Wright in person and, toward the
end of his career, working on concepts
for the space shuttle!)
Kimball writes with a "homey," un
pretentious style that is very easy to fol
low, even for the non-technical person.
Part 1 is liberally sprinkled with pictures
of aircraft Kimball worked on and anec
dotes that give the reader the feeling of
being led on a personal tour through
Kimball's career diary.
But the book is more than just auto
biography, because Kimball takes numer
ous opportunities to comment on the
realities of the design process: what went
right, what went wrong and why, what
were attitudes and practices that were

helpful or not helpful.
This is especially true in Parts 3 and
4, and this is what I see as one of the
outstanding features of the book: It
passes on advice, advice from one with
experience in engineering design.
Kimball is not shy about calling engi
neering management on the carpet to get
serious about ways to minimize the
"meanderings," as he puts it, that take
place in engineering design. He feels one
way to do this is to allow for an organiza
tionally "free" in-house design consultant
to provide a whistle blowing surveillance
function as needed. Here again he speaks
from experience, having been in such a
position for 10 years during his tenure
at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company.
Kimball also has plentiful and practical
words of advice for design engineering
students. Not the least of these sugges
tions is that of gaining broad experience

in design and staying in a technical design
capacity long enough to have sufficient
background to move into competent en
gineering management.
Overall, I liked the book. It had some
shortcomings, mostly details such as a
few hard-to-read figures and maybe some
organizational flaws. But for a first-time
author, who wore all the hats (author,
chief editor and publisher), Kimball did
a commendable job.
The late Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Henry Fuchs wrote the foreword to the
book, which sums it up well. In it he
said, "The content of this book is rare
and important... . Engineering textbooks
tell us how the jobs should be done. Very
few people tell us what actually happened.
.. . Any addition to this rare genre is
important in helping us to understand a
profession which is changing our way of
living."
