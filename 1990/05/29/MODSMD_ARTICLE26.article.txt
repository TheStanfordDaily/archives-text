## Sizzling Card nine sweeps into Omaha 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Thanks for coming, guys.
Five visiting teams invaded
Sunken Diamond this weekend,
trying to steal away the NCAA
West I Regional crown from top

seeded Stanford.
After Friday's play, three
pretenders to the throne were left.
As of Saturday evening, one was
left.
As of 2:47 p.m. yesterday after
noon — which was when Stanford
pitcher Mike Mussina fielded a

weak ground ball, gave two ec
static fist-pumps and tossed to
David McCarty for the final out
in a 6-2 win over San Diego State
— the pretenders had dl gone
home.
Pack your bags, grab your
books, call your profs and tell
them what to do with their finals,
kids, 'cuz the Cardinal's headin'
back to Omaha. And, just like
Mussina, they're a little excited
about it.
"It's an amazing feeling," said
Ryan Turner after his 4-for-5,
three-run, two stolen base per
formance against the Aztecs yes
terday. "It's basically a dream
come true."
"It's what you work for the
whole year," said Troy Paulsen,
who hit a monster solo home run
yesterday. "You come in in the
fall working to go to Omaha."
And then there was Mussina,
who punctuated his out-of-his
mind, you're-not-gonna-hit-this
performance with the little
celebration moments before the
final out.
"Hey, the crowd was standing,
and they'd been cheering since
there was one out (in the ninth),"
Mussina said of his fist pump. "I
was excited and wanted to show
it, but I wanted to wait until I
was sure we'd won it."
Mussina probably could have
started celebrating a little earlier,
because he had the Aztecs com
pletely overpowered throughout
the game. Pitching on two days
rest, Mussina had his fastball
humming like never before: San
Diego State managed but three
hits, five fly outs, four K's and a
whole mess of ground balls.
Any secret to your success,
Mike? "They were just putting
down 'I,' and I was throwing it
hard," he said. "They (the de
fense) made some great plays. . .
I can't ask for any better out
come."

time since 1988, when the Cardi
nal won the Northeast Regional
on the way to its second straight
CWS title. This regional win, how
ever, was just a bit sweeter than
the one of two years ago.
"It feels better this year,
definitely," Paulsen said "You've
got the '89 factor (the Cardinal
wasn't invited to last year's
playoffs), but even more than
that.. .we had as good a season
as you could have this year, but
it wouldn't have mattered if we
hadn't won here."
There wasn't much of a chance
of that happening, because the
Cardinal trailed in only two in
nings of the four games it played
during the regional. Most of the
thanks for that goes to the Car
dinal pitchers, who gave up only
five runs in four games — four
of them to the Aztecs in 6-2 wins
Saturday and Sunday.
Leading the way was Mussina,
who won two games (he worked
eight strong innings in Friday's
6-1 win over Middle Tennessee
State) and was named the region
al's Most Outstanding Player.
Stan Spencer picked up the other
game, striking out 12 San Diego
State batters Saturday.
The weekend's sweep gives the
Cardinal a school-record 56 wins
in 1990, and both Mussina and
Spencer have now tied the
pitchers' single-season record
with 14 victories.
Under normal circumstances,
Mussina would have had one day
off before coming back Sunday
for the championship game. How
ever, thanks to torrential rains,
Sunday's game was postponed un

til Monday — giving Mussina 24
extra hours of rest.
"I told (Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess) I wanted to throw yes
terday," Mussina said Monday.
"Somebody was looking out for
me and making it rain. Somebody
said 'Okay, you want to pitch that
bad, we'll make it rain.' "
Someone apparently also
wanted the Cardinal to break out
of its hitting mini-drought: After
getting only five hits against
MTSU Friday, Stanford racked up
25 in its two games against the
Aztecs.
Not that it mattered, because
the Cardinal pitchers were letting
their opponents get absolutely
nothing. "The way our pitchers
are throwing, it takes the pressure
off our offense," Roger Burnett
said after Saturday's game. "We
know we don't have to score a
whole lot of runs to win."
Good thing, because the Stan
ford offense was missing in action
for the first seven innings of Fri
day's game with MTSU. The Car
dinal managed all of two hits
before the eighth inning against
the Blue Raiders' Tom Wegmann
— but was still leading 2-0.
The two runs scored in the sec
ond inning — on zero hits, zero
walks and zero errors. Paul Carey
scored the Cardinal's first run by
— this is ugly — getting hit by
a pitch, moving to second on a
wild pitch, taking third on a
fielder's choice that got no one
out (the throw to get Carey was
late) and then coming home on
another wild pitch.
Not wanting to be outdone in
the ugly department, David
Holbrook — who had reached on
the FC, moved to second with an
SB and gone to third on the sec
ond WP — made it two-zip on
yet another WP. (Pretty EZ, huh?
Stop that, damit!)
That was it for the next six
innings, as the Cardinal lineup

seven hits during 17 innings on the mound.
flailed away. "This was one of the
best games I've ever pitched,"
Wegmann said. "I spotted my
pitches the best I have all year. . .
The No. 1 team in the nation: It
pumped me up, and I just wanted
to go right at 'em."
That worked fine until the
eighth, when Jeff Hammonds led
things off with a walk, took second
with his school-record-breaking
44th steal of the year and scored
on a single by McCarty. Carey
followed up with a bloop single
to center, and a loooong fly out
by Tim Griffin chased Wegmann.

After a walk to Holbrook loaded
the bases, Turner — who, like
the rest of the team, had struggled
his first few times up — came to
the plate. "We just had to settle
down," Turner said. "We'd been
swinging too hard, trying to pull
the ball and that's not us. We just
had to try to hit the ball up the
middle. Sometimes it takes us a
couple of at-bats to figure that
out."
Turner had apparently learned
his lesson, for he took a 1-0 pitch
and lined it to the gap in right
center. The ball landed as
McCarty scored and then started
rolling to the wall. Carey scored,
and still the ball rolled. Turner
steamed past second, never even

considered slowing down and slid
into third as Holbrook came home.
Six-nothing, and good afternoon.
That wasn't the end of the day's
excitement, however: In the next
half-inning, MTSU left fielder
Corey Watkins hit a high fly to
left-center. Turner called for it,
Hammonds called for it, Turner
called louder Hammonds called
louder, and then Turner said the
heck with it and grabbed the ball
while crashing into Hammonds.
Way to communicate, guys.
"That's his ball all the way,"
Turner said later. "The center
fielder's boss out there, but,
y'know. . . he's a freshman."
Turner laughed and put a head
lock on Hammonds.
"Yeah, I'll tell you what, out
there I'm a rock between two su
perstars," Hammonds smiled as
he hit Turner in the gut. "They
say the center fielder calls them
all he's the general. Not on this
team, baby. We've got three center
fielders out there."
The win gave the Cardinal a 9
a.m. (ouch!) date on Saturday
with the Aztecs, who had won
their Friday game with Fresno
State, 8-4. Everyone was pretty
grouchy with the early start, es
pecially after a few creative strike
calls by the home umpire.
Except Spencer, that is. After
giving up a quick run in the first,
he loosened up and started to
cruise, striking out nine in the
last five innings.
"I was maybe a little nervous
until the third, then I settled
down a bit," Spencer said. "After
the third I started feeling pretty
good."
Apparently so: Spencer never
lost any of his stuff, striking out
all three batters in the ninth.
"Stan's a battler, and he really
came through for us today," Tall
man said.
Tallman battled as well, coming
through with a two-RBI double
in the fourth to make it 4-1. After
golfing/fouling off two pitches
that, to be generous, were just a
bit low, Tallman hit two more
back out of play and then cranked
the next pitch down the third-base
line. Holbrook scored, Burnett did
the same after ignoring a stop
sign from third-base coach Dean
Stotz and Tallman ended up at
third when the throw went to the
plate.
McCarty then made it 5-1 with
a single, and Spencer had more
than enough of a cushion.
Tallman came through again
yesterday, bringing Turner home
with two sacrifice flies. Turner
scored his other run on a double
from Burnett, and, with Mussina
not letting the Aztecs do anything
but look silly, the Cardinal booked
its trip to Omaha.

and off the field last weekend while helping Stanford to its regional
championship title.
