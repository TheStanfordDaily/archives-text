# Card rookies disprove first-year curse theory

Experience? Who needs experi
ence?
Entering this weekend's West I
Regional, six of the Stanford base
ball team's starters had never
played in the NCAA playoffs.
Junior Ryan Turner, sophomores
David McCarty, Roger Burnett,
Troy Tallman and David Holbrook
and freshman Jeff Hammonds?
Rookies. Clueless. Didn't know
what to expect.
How'd they do? Oh, horribly:
Only four of the rookies made the
All-Tournament team, joining
pitchers Stan Spencer and Mike
Mussina. And, on a weekend
which didn't have the normal pro
duction Stanford expects from
senior sluggers Tim Griffin and
Paul Carey, it was "the younger
guys" who brought the Cardinal
back to the College World Series.
"Griff has carried us most of
the season, and now he's strug
gling a bit, and Paul's had a couple
of hits, but not big ones," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said
after the Cardinal's 6-2 win over
San Diego State Saturday. "The
key to our success this season has
been that a different guy hits
every game. If someone's not

producing, someone else'll pick it
up."
That someone was usually
Turner, who was named to the
All-Tournament team after going
7-for-15 with four RBIs, four runs
scored and two steals over the
weekend. On Friday, Turner hit
a bases-loaded triple to break open
a 3-0 game against Middle Ten
nessee State, and then yesterday
he had two doubles, two singles
and three runs in the champion
ship game against San Diego
State.
"I wasn't even there (at the re
gional playoffs) in '88, so this
means a lot more to me," Turner
said. "I feel like I've contributed
more this season; I've got more
at stake."
So do all the younger players,
whose excitement over being in
the regional was obvious. "We've
got a good mix on this team,"
Marquess said. "The young guys,
they're all excited, and the older
guys are like 'All right, all right,
we're okay.' You know, all seniors
are really cool. It's a good blend."
"Mac and Roger and Troy, you
can just see it, they're as excited
as hell," Troy Paulsen said after
the Cardinal clinched a berth in
the CWS. "They've played well,
they've played hard, and I'm sure
they feel as good as anybody right

now, maybe better because of last
year."
Burnett, who made the all
tournament team thanks to his
normal array of just completely
sickening "how'd-he-do-that?" de
fensive plays, wasn't about to hide
his enthusiasm. "I was really ex
cited today," he said Saturday
morning after going three-for
four to help put the Cardinal in
the championship game. "The

older guys have been carrying us
all year, and they may be feeling
a bit of pressure. The younger
guys may be a bit looser, just
going out and having fun."
Burnett was apparently pretty
loose on defense, because he made
two plays during the weekend that
were absolutely insane. In the
fifth inning Friday, Middle Ten
nessee's Mike Severance hit a high
chopper to the left of the mound.

Mussina moved back, couldn't
make the play, and then got out
of the way of a charging Burnett,
who barehanded the ball on a
dead run, cocked and sent a
screaming throw to first to nail
Severance. Easily.
That's sick. "I felt if I'd gloved
it I wouldn't have got him," Bur
nett shrugged after the game.


Al Green — Daily
Troy Tallman forgot the definition of first-time Jitters in his post-season debut, hitting a home run
and knocking in four RBIs to help propel the Cardinal to the College World Series.
"The ball took a great hop, I
grabbed it and threw it and didn't
think about it."
Yesterday, in the sixth, the Az
tecs' Bill Dunckel hit a bouncer
deep to the hole. Burnett raced
over, backhanded it — much,
much too deep to have a prayer
of catching Dunckel — and looped
a throw with his body turned the
wrong way without even giving it
a thought. The ball was off-target,
and McCarty had to use every
last bit of his 6-foot-5 frame to
grab it, but Dunckel was out.

Wow. "Goddarn, Burnett played
great defense," Marquess said.
"We've had some great ones here,
but there's been no one better
than him, defensively. Roger's
something special."
So are the rest of the young
'uns. McCarty and Hammonds
both made the All-Tourney team.
Unanimously. Tallman didn't
make it, but he probably should
have.
