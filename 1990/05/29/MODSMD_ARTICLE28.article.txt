# Pitching the key
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Stanford baseball Coach
Mark Marquess' call to arms
was heralded emphatically
at Sunken Diamond this
weekend. As the Cardinal
nine swept to the West I Re
gional championship and a
bid to the College World Se
ries, the Stanford pitching
staff responded to Mar
quess' challenge and sent
notice to the teams who will
join the Cardinal in Omaha,
Neb.
To beat us, you have to
hit us. And that's not easy.
"The bottom line with this
team is pitching and de
fense," Marquess said after
yesterday's 6-2 victory over
San Diego State in the
championship game. "If we
get the ball over the plate
... we're going to win some
ballgames when we're not
hitting well."
The Stanford pitching
staff conceded only five runs
in the four games of the re
gional, four of which were
in two victories over a San
Diego State team that
pounded out 26 runs in their
first two games in the re
gional. On Saturday, Stan
ford starter Stan Spencer
pitched a complete game 6-2
victory over the Aztecs —
which teammate Mike Mus
sina duplicated yesterday.
The Moose, who had also
pitched eight innings for the
win over Middle Tennessee
State on Friday, joined Spen
cer on the All-Regional
Team.
Freshman pitcher John
Reid, who is normally the
third pitcher in the Stanford
rotation, threw eight shut
out innings on Thursday for
the Cardinal's first regional
victory over Campbell.
Most impressive, however,
is the fact that Mussina
pitched two victories —
seventeen innings of
fastballs — on just two days
rest. After the rain on Sun
day forced the postponement
of the championship game
until yesterday, Marquess
was afforded the luxury of
starting Mussina.
Though Marquess had
said he'd start freshman
Brian Sackinsky for the
championship game (and
save Mussina for a second
game if the Aztecs avoided
elimination by winning the
first), he opted for Mussina
just before game time.
"Mussina wanted the ball
in the worst way," Marquess
said. "He was mad at me
when I took him out of the
game on Friday. That's when
he told me he wanted the
ball when we went on Sun
day. The extra day [of rest]
helped him, no doubt. His
fastball was as good as it
could possibly be, especially
on just two days rest."
