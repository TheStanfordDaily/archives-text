# Card netters stopped in semis but come home All-Americans

### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - In the
playera' lounge at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium, there stands The Wall.
Now this isn't just your everyday, run
of-the-mill wall. The Wall is adorned with
pictures of some of the greatest tennis
players who have ever lived — all of
whom happen to be former Stanford stu
dents. John McEnroe. Alex Mayer. Roscoe
Tanner. Patty Fendick. Kathy Jordan.
Tim Mayotte.
To be placed alongside these tennis
deities and permanently engraved in the
annals of Stanford tennis history, a player
simply needs to accomplish one task: win
an individual NCAA championship in
singles or doubles.
In 1990, no men's player made it onto
The Wall. But if there ever was a year
when an entire team belonged on The
Wall, this is it.
Injuries, mid-season slumps, more in
juries — the Cardinal men's team over
came them all, winning the 1990 NCAA
team championship with some of the gut
siest play any Stanford squad has ever
shown.
After the team championship con
cluded May 22, the Stanford players

looked more like they had just walked
off a football field than a tennis court.
Freshman No. 1 player Jonathan Stark
limped around the court, a huge ice bag
wrapped around his not-yet-healed stress
fracture in his left foot. No. 2 player
Jared Palmer could barely walk as well,
both knees bandaged up with ice. Palmer
had mtyor surgery on both knees during
the 1990 season. Sophomore No. 3 player
Alex O'Brien looked like a mummy, his
chronically-iryured right shoulder cov
ered with ace bandages and ice bags.
"It was just a tremendous achievement
to win it this year, especially with all the
adversity (injuries), M Coach Dick Gould
said.
After the team championship, it
seemed that asking the players to get up
in the morning — let alone play in the
individual NCAA tournament — would
be indeed asking too much.
Yet, once again, Cardinal performers
went above and beyond the call, not win
ning any individual titles but coming
home with four All-America honors and
two semifinal appearances.
In the singles, Palmer, unseeded in the
tournament because he had been
sidelined for most of the season, crushed
opponent after opponent en route to the
semifinals.

In the quarterfinals, Palmer upset top
seeded and big-serving Todd Martin of
Northwestern 6-2, 6-4 with an array of
shots that most players never dream of
even attempting.
"He is the most talented player in col
lege," Martin said after the match. "He
has rough days, but it is amazing that
a kid can play that well. My serve has
never been returned that well. I played
Michael Chang a few months ago, and
he didn't return my serve even close to
that. No one can beat Jared when he
plays that well."
Not too bad for a guy who Coach Gould
said had only a "50-50" chance of making
it into the tournament because of lack
of matches.
The next day in the semifinals, how
ever, Palmer looked quite different, losing
to the eventual winner, Texas' Steve
Bryan, 6-0, 6-1. Every shot that he hit
just the day before landed a little long
or a little short.
"I was worn out," Palmer explained.
"I had played three matches the day
before, and I'm not in the best shape
(after my knee surgeries). I just couldn't
get going."
"You're not going to beat someone
who's that good (Bryan) when you've got
a flat tire." Gould added, referring to

Palmer's knees.
Stark, who was the second seed in the
tournament, lost in the quarterfinals to
UCLA's Jason Netter 6-4, 6-3. But for
Stark, who had not played for over a
month before the tournament started,
the event was a huge success.
Even with the stress fracture and the
lack of practice, Stark won three rounds
in the individual tournament and, in the
team competition, beat the eventual tour
nament champion, Bryan, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4.
Stark, who was ranked No. 2 by the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings enter
ing the tournament, had beaten Netter
6-1, 7-5 earlier in the season.
In doubles, Stark and Palmer, who both
earned All-America status by virtue of
their singles and doubles results, ad
vanced to the semifinals before crashing
into another Texas blockade. Texas'
Mitch Michulka and Michael Penman up
set the second-seeded Stanford team. 7-5
5-7, 6-4.
In the quarterfinals earlier that day.
Stark and Palmer looked invincible
against Georgia's A 1 Parker and Murphy
Jensen, pounding the Bulldog duo 6-3
6-2.
Palmer was returning each service with
pinpoint precision, while Stark was all
over the net, smashing every short ball

that dared come over the net.
But later in the day against Michulka
and Penman, Stark and Palmer looked
tired. "How could we play good doubles
when we were both dead?" Palmer la
mented.
"We were a little tired out there today,"
Stark said. "After we both lost in the
singles, we said that we would win it in
doubles. I kind of wanted to get up there
on The Wall. It would be an incredible
honor. I guess that will just have to be
a goal for next year."
Perhaps more impressive than Stark
and Palmer's showing, though, was the
doubles play of O'Brien and Jason Yee.
Unseeded going into the tournament,
O'Brien and Yee, Stanford's No. 3 doubles
team, earned All-America status with a
quarterfinal appearance. The dynamic
duo, who won the Pacific 10 Conference
doubles championship earlier in the year,
upended Miami's Johan Donar and Conny
Falk, a No. 5-No. 8 seed, 7-5, 6-1 to reach
the quarterfinals.
In the quarterfinals, O'Brien and Yee
won the first set, but Alabama's Ellis
Ferreira and John Stimpson played better
on the big points to come out with a 3-6,
6-4, 6-3 victory.
"We didn't stick it to them like
we did yesterday," Yee said.
"We worked well together all
year," said O'Brien, who became
an All-American for the second
straight year. "Whenever I would
get the ball low, Jason would al
ways be there to close off the net.
It's too bad we didn't play as well
today because I think we could
have won it. H
Gould had nothing but positive
things to say about both Yee and
O'Brien. "Besides winning the
team tournament, those two guys'
becoming All-Americans was
definitely the biggest highlight for
me," he said. "Alex had such a
great year. It would have been a
shame for him not to have made
it. And Jason. . .there's a guy who
wasn't even sure he was going to
make the traveling squad. In
stead, he sticks it out, wins Pac
10s, fills in for us at No. 6, and
now he's an All-American. What
those two guys did was just phe
nomenal."
Freshman Alexis Hombrecher
and senior Jeff Cathrall, Stan
ford's No. 2 doubles team, came
within one match of becoming All-
Americans, losing in the round of
16 to Michulka and Penman 6-3,
6-3.
In all, Stanford came back from
Indian Wells with four All-
Americans, as many as Gould has
ever had in his 23 years as a
Stanford coach. As far as next
year, Stanford looks to be even
stronger, if that's possible.

Now this isn't just your everyday, run
of-the-mill wall. The Wall is adorned with
pictures of some of the greatest tennis
players who have ever lived — all of
whom happen to be former Stanford stu
dents. John McEnroe. Alex Mayer. Roscoe
Tanner. Patty Fendick. Kathy Jordan.

To be placed alongside these tennis
deities and permanently engraved in the
annals of Stanford tennis history, a player
simply needs to accomplish one task: win
an individual NCAA championship in
singles or doubles.
In 1990, no men's player made it onto
The Wall. But if there ever was a year
when an entire team belonged on The
Wall, this is it.
Injuries, mid-season slumps, more in
juries — the Cardinal men's team over
came them all, winning the 1990 NCAA
team championship with some of the gut
siest play any Stanford squad has ever
shown.
After the team championship con
cluded May 22, the Stanford players

looked more like they had just walked
off a football field than a tennis court.
Freshman No. 1 player Jonathan Stark
limped around the court, a huge ice bag
wrapped around his not-yet-healed stress
fracture in his left foot. No. 2 player
Jared Palmer could barely walk as well,
both knees bandaged up with ice. Palmer
had mtyor surgery on both knees during
the 1990 season. Sophomore No. 3 player
Alex O'Brien looked like a mummy, his
chronically-iryured right shoulder cov
ered with ace bandages and ice bags.
"It was just a tremendous achievement
to win it this year, especially with all the
adversity (injuries), M Coach Dick Gould
said.
After the team championship, it
seemed that asking the players to get up
in the morning — let alone play in the
individual NCAA tournament — would
be indeed asking too much.
Yet, once again, Cardinal performers
went above and beyond the call, not win
ning any individual titles but coming
home with four All-America honors and
two semifinal appearances.
In the singles, Palmer, unseeded in the
tournament because he had been
sidelined for most of the season, crushed
opponent after opponent en route to the
semifinals.

In the quarterfinals, Palmer upset top
seeded and big-serving Todd Martin of
Northwestern 6-2, 6-4 with an array of
shots that most players never dream of
even attempting.
"He is the most talented player in col
lege," Martin said after the match. "He
has rough days, but it is amazing that
a kid can play that well. My serve has
never been returned that well. I played
Michael Chang a few months ago, and
he didn't return my serve even close to
that. No one can beat Jared when he
plays that well."
Not too bad for a guy who Coach Gould
said had only a "50-50" chance of making
it into the tournament because of lack
of matches.
The next day in the semifinals, how
ever, Palmer looked quite different, losing
to the eventual winner, Texas' Steve
Bryan, 6-0, 6-1. Every shot that he hit
just the day before landed a little long
or a little short.
"I was worn out," Palmer explained.
"I had played three matches the day
before, and I'm not in the best shape
(after my knee surgeries). I just couldn't
get going."
"You're not going to beat someone
who's that good (Bryan) when you've got
a flat tire." Gould added, referring to

Palmer's knees.
Stark, who was the second seed in the
tournament, lost in the quarterfinals to
UCLA's Jason Netter 6-4, 6-3. But for
Stark, who had not played for over a
month before the tournament started,
the event was a huge success.
Even with the stress fracture and the
lack of practice, Stark won three rounds
in the individual tournament and, in the
team competition, beat the eventual tour
nament champion, Bryan, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4.
Stark, who was ranked No. 2 by the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings enter
ing the tournament, had beaten Netter
6-1, 7-5 earlier in the season.
In doubles, Stark and Palmer, who both
earned All-America status by virtue of
their singles and doubles results, ad
vanced to the semifinals before crashing
into another Texas blockade. Texas'
Mitch Michulka and Michael Penman up
set the second-seeded Stanford team. 7-5
5-7, 6-4.
In the quarterfinals earlier that day.
Stark and Palmer looked invincible
against Georgia's A 1 Parker and Murphy
Jensen, pounding the Bulldog duo 6-3
6-2.
Palmer was returning each service with
pinpoint precision, while Stark was all
over the net, smashing every short ball

that dared come over the net.
But later in the day against Michulka
and Penman, Stark and Palmer looked
tired. "How could we play good doubles
when we were both dead?" Palmer la
mented.
"We were a little tired out there today,"
Stark said. "After we both lost in the
singles, we said that we would win it in
doubles. I kind of wanted to get up there
on The Wall. It would be an incredible
honor. I guess that will just have to be
a goal for next year."
Perhaps more impressive than Stark
and Palmer's showing, though, was the
doubles play of O'Brien and Jason Yee.
Unseeded going into the tournament,
O'Brien and Yee, Stanford's No. 3 doubles
team, earned All-America status with a
quarterfinal appearance. The dynamic
duo, who won the Pacific 10 Conference
doubles championship earlier in the year,
upended Miami's Johan Donar and Conny
Falk, a No. 5-No. 8 seed, 7-5, 6-1 to reach
the quarterfinals.
In the quarterfinals, O'Brien and Yee
won the first set, but Alabama's Ellis
Ferreira and John Stimpson played better
on the big points to come out with a 3-6,
6-4, 6-3 victory.
"We didn't stick it to them like
we did yesterday," Yee said.
"We worked well together all
year," said O'Brien, who became
an All-American for the second
straight year. "Whenever I would
get the ball low, Jason would al
ways be there to close off the net.
It's too bad we didn't play as well
today because I think we could
have won it. H
Gould had nothing but positive
things to say about both Yee and
O'Brien. "Besides winning the
team tournament, those two guys'
becoming All-Americans was
definitely the biggest highlight for
me," he said. "Alex had such a
great year. It would have been a
shame for him not to have made
it. And Jason. . .there's a guy who
wasn't even sure he was going to
make the traveling squad. In
stead, he sticks it out, wins Pac
10s, fills in for us at No. 6, and
now he's an All-American. What
those two guys did was just phe
nomenal."
Freshman Alexis Hombrecher
and senior Jeff Cathrall, Stan
ford's No. 2 doubles team, came
within one match of becoming All-
Americans, losing in the round of
16 to Michulka and Penman 6-3,
6-3.
In all, Stanford came back from
Indian Wells with four All-
Americans, as many as Gould has
ever had in his 23 years as a
Stanford coach. As far as next
year, Stanford looks to be even
stronger, if that's possible.
