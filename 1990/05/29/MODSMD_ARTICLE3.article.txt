# Armenian girl OK after having tumor removed
## Had to travel halfway around world for surgery 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
A 2-year-old Armenian girl who had a
life-threatening tumor removed from her
left thigh at Stanford Hospital will finally
be able walk normally in a week, doctors
said.
Svetlana Gregorian left the hospital Sat
urday after the successful removal of a
football-sized hemangioma, or blood vessel
tumor, on Thursday.
A team of physicians from the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation — led by Dr. David
Apfelberg, working together with Dr. Agheg
Yenikomshian, a San Jose plastic surgeon
—■ performed the laser surgery to remove
the tumor, which wa9 not malignant.
Gregorian was refused treatment in Ar
menia, Moscow and New York City because
doctors deemed the surgery too risky —
the operation could have cost her a leg or
her life.
Gregorian's tumor "is the biggest I've
ever seen," said Apfelberg, who is renowned
for his expertise on hemangiomas.
Apfelberg and the other physicians
donated their services. In addition,
Gregorian received a $10,000 donation

from Interplast Inc., a non-profit organi
zation that provides free reconstructive
surgery to children of Third World
countries.
The San Francisco Armenian Relief So
ciety and the Bay Area Armenian commu
nity also donated funds-
Apfelberg and the four other medical
foundation physicians who performed the
surgery all belong to the clinical faculty at
Stanford.
The case was brought to Apfelberg's at
tention by Yenikomshian, who learned
about it from Sirarpi and Hagop Chakalian
of Hillsborough.
Gregorian's family met Mr. Chakalian by
chance last year when he was helping with
earthquake relief in Armenia. "Her family
realized that sending her to the United
States was the only way to save her life,"
Mrs. Chakalian said.
Mr. Chakalian brought back pictures of
Gregorian and showed them to his friend
Yenikomshian, who was treating other Ar
menian earthquake victims at that time.
Yenikomshian referred the case to Ap
felberg because of his "experience on the
cutting edge of laser surgery with heman
giomas," Yenikomshian said.
