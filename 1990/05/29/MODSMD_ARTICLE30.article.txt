# Card can't overcome course
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Although the women's golf team
is not that happy about their
ninth-place finish in the NCAA
Golf Championships held at Hil
ton Head, S.C., the team is thank
ful for one thing.
As Stephanie Davis said, "At
least none of us got eaten by any
of the crocodiles."
The Arthur Hills Golf Course,
however, was much less kind to
the Cardinal than its crocodile in
habitants.

Cardinal ninth

at NCAAs

After a great third round of 302
that vaulted the team into sixth
place in the tournament, the
course got the best of the Cardinal
on the final day of play. The Car
dinal had its worst round of the
tournament Saturday — shooting
a 314 — which dropped them into
a ninth place finish.
"Things just didn't go our way
in the last round. We will all re
member how tough this course
was. It is definitely the most dif
ficult course we played on all year

long," Coach Tim Baldwin said.
Going into the fourth and final
round, the Cardinal was only two
shots out of fourth place and had
a legitimate shot at accomplishing
the team goal of finishing in the
top five.
"We were all feeling really good
and playing well going into the
last round," sophomore Audrey
Wooding said. "But with a course
like this, you have to always be
on your guard because one mis
take can really hurt you."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal
made a few too many mistakes,
while the teams ahead of them in
the 17-team field managed to play
exceptional golf and pull away
from Stanford.
Arizona State, the pre
tournament favorite, proved the
experts right as they won the
NCAA championship by a com
manding 16 strokes over runner
up UCLA. San Jose State finished
in third place. Arizona's Susan
Slaughter, who finished second in
last year's championship, won the
individual title this year in a
playoff over Texas' Michiko Hat
tori.
Stanford's Adele Moore, who
had been tied for first place with
Hattori after the first two rounds
and was still in sth place after

the third round, had an especially
disappointing last round, shooting
an 82, which dropped her into a
22nd-place finish.
Someone else who had a tough
last round was junior Jodi Figley.
Figley was in eigth place entering
the final round, but her score of
83 put her all the way down to
31st place.
On a brighter note, Davis and
Wooding had the best scores of
the day for the Cardinal, with
final rounds of 77. Senior Steph
anie Parel, in her last collegiate
tournament, finished with her
best round of the tournament, as
she shot a 78.
Despite the team's disappoint
ing last round, the Cardinal still
has much to be happy about.
"I wish we had finished higher,
but I'm happy because we made
some improvements and know we
can play with any of the teams
in the country," Wooding said. "In
our minds, we know we're better
than ninth in the country."
Baldwin was also very proud of
his golfers. "I've never seen them
try as hard as they did and be so
focused on playing well, but it
just didn't seem to help. They
really wanted to do well, maybe
just a little bit too well," he said.
You can't blame them for that.
