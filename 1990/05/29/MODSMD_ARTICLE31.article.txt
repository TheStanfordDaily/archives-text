Two strokes.
In a year comprised of nearly
twenty tournaments, hundreds of
holes and countless shots, the
men's golf team missed gaining a
berth in the NCAA Champion
ships by a mere two strokes.
Eighteen teams assembled this
weekend for the West Regional in
Las Cruces, N.M., with the top
nine squads earning a trip to next
month's national championship
tourney. Stanford finished tied for
10th, just two shots behind NCAA
qualifiers Nevada-Reno and New
Mexico.
The Cardinal's three-round
team total of 864 was 32 strokes
off the sparkling pace set by vic
torious UNLV, in a 54-hole event
that was characterized by sharp
shooting and low scores.
Indicative of the fine play that
dominated the tournament, only
six shots separated the six teams
who finished from fifth to 10th
place on the New Mexico State
Course.
Despite the bittersweet ending
for his squad's 1990 campaign,
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin
emphasized the positive aspects
of what proved to be a cruel week

end for the Cardinal.
"There's no disgrace in our
showing because everybody
played as hard as they could in
this tournament," Goodwin said.
"We had our chances and just
came up short."
Senior Don Christiansen, who
contributed at Las Cruces with a
223 total, was philosophical about
the abrupt end to the team's
season.
"Golf is a frustrating game at
times," he said, "and we saw it
at one of its most frustrating mo
ments."
The Cardinal was led by soph
omore Christian Cevaer, whose
rounds of 71-68-72 tied the
French native for 11th individu
ally. The performance enabled
Cevaer to continue his season, as
he qualified as one of two players
at the Western Regional who will
advance to the NCAA Champion
ships as individuals.
Seniors Marc Funseth and
Steve White played their final
Jioles as collegiates in style,, as
Funseth bowed out with a fine
three-day showing of 217, while
White capped his Stanford career
with a strong 223.
Brad Geer, soon to join the
ranks of Cardinal alumni himself,
demonstrated his opening round

68 was not an anomaly with
closing rounds of 74 and 72. For
Geer, his last college tournament
proved to be a disappointing
closing note.
"It's obviously tough to swallow
when it comes down to just a few
strokes," he said. "We knew it
would be close, but it's still hard
to handle."
Ironically, the Cardinal suffered
a strikingly similar fate in last
year's Western Regional, as Stan
ford saw its top-nine position
evaporate and failed to qualify for
the NCAA finals.
Despite its heartbreaking post
season, the team's season must
be evaluated as a success. Stan
ford won an unprecedented four
team tournament titles and was
ranked among the nation's finest
squads throughout the year.
Goodwin accentuated the
team's 1990 achievements in his
evaluation of the squad's overall
performance.
"There's no question we enjoyed
a .tremendous year," he said.
"While we had some rough mo
ments, on the whole, this was a
great year for Stanford golf."
For the Cardinal linksters, the
54-hole event proved to be a bit
tersweet ending to a remarkably
successful season.
