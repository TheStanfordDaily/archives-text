Sometimes being the best just
isn't good enough.
While Stanford, the nation's
top-ranked team, cruised through
the NCAA West I Regional over
the weekend, most of the top seeds
didn't have it so easy. In fact, of
the six other teams that advanced
to the College World Series over
the weekend, only one was a
region's top seed.
Stanford was barely tested in
winning four consecutive games
over the weekend, but a combi
nation of upsets and rain delays
played havoc with the favorites
in the other seven regionals.
The upsets began in the North
east Regional, held in Waterbury,
Conn. Top-seeded North Carolina
lost twice Saturday, to Georgia
and unheralded Rutgers, and saw
their season come to a close. The
Bulldogs (48-18) continued to win,
hammering Rutgers 20-9 in the
final, becoming the first team to
reach the CWS Sunday night.
Rutgers forced a second cham
pionship game when Ted Ciesla's

sacrifice fly in the bottom of the
ninth gave the Scarlet Knights a
4-3 win, but Georgia scored six
in the fourth, four in the fifth
and five in the sixth en route to
the 20-9 victory. Jeff Cooper had
seven RBIs and scored four runs.
Arkansas, the top seed in the
Midwest Regional, had it even
worse than the Tar Heels. The
Razorbacks dropped their first
two games and returned to Fay
etteville two days after arriving
in Wichita, Kansas. The second
seed, host Wichita State, didn't
fare much better, sandwiching a
pair of losses around an upset of
Arkansas. In a game completed
last night, Georgia Southern (50-
17), the fifth seed, defeated third
seeded South Alabama 6-5 to ad
vance to the Series for the first
time since 1973.
Rob Fitzpatrick hit a grand
slam in the fifth inning, and Chris
James threw out the tying run at
the plate in the sixth to key the
win for the Eagles. Reliever Joey
Hamilton came in to get both that
win and a 5-4 victory over UCLA
earlier in the day to up his record
to 17-3 on the season. Bruin Paul
Ellis hit his nation-leading 29th
home run in the loss to Georgia
Southern yesterday morning.
Another upset occurred yester
day in the Central Regional, held
in Austin, Texas. Texas was the
top seed and the defending NCAA
runner-up, but Cal State-
Fullerton (36-21), the region's
third seed, beat the Longhorns
twice in two days. Yesterday Titan
sophomore James Popoff threw a

four-hit shutout to beat Texas 3-0
and lead his team to Omaha.
One other team successfully
took out a top seed on its own
turf. In the West II Regional,
Oklahoma State, the second seed,
beat Arizona State twice in two
days. The Cowboys (53-16)
thumped the top-seeded (and
second-ranked) Sun Devils in
ASU's own Packard Stadium 17-9
Sunday, and came back for a 10-5
win yesterday. The Cowboys took
a 7-0 lead into the fourth and
never looked back. The Sun Devils
had won nine of the previous 10
regionals they had hosted.
Mississippi State is also going
to the World Series after a 4-3
win over Florida State last night
at the South II Regional in
Starkville, Miss. The second
seeded Bulldogs (49-19) beat the
top-seeded Seminoles 11-8 Satur
day and 4-3 yesterday to offset
an 11-9 loss Sunday. In the cham
pionship game, Mississippi State
scored three runs in a two-out
rally in the eighth to post the 4-3
come-from-behind win. Bobby
Reed went the distance to win his
15th game this year against only
two losses.
The only other top seed to join
Stanford (56-10) in the College
World Series is LSU, winner of
the South I Regional. Playing on
their home field in Baton Rouge,
La., the Tigers (52-17) triumphed
in two of three One-run games
with second-seeded USC.
Rain, rain and more rain has
the Atlantic Regional a full day
behind schedule.
