# The
						card of the century
## U.S. to issue Centennial commemorative postcard 
### Brooke Hart Staff writer 
When you care enough to send the very
best, a Stanford Centennial postcard may
be just the thing you need.
To commemorate Stanford's centennial,
the U.S. Postal Service will issue a postal
card this fall depicting Memorial Court and
the Inner Quad.
It will be the first U.S. postal card of
Stanford.
Illustrator Jim M'Guinness, a former
University staff member, was commis
sioned to design the postal card. He has
created dozens of note cards, posters, book
covers and brochures for Stanford over the
past 20 years.
M'Guinness said he hopes his card will
become a collector's item.
The Postal Service will issue 10 million
of the 15 cent post cards â€” which also
portray the old Memorial Arch, which was
destroyed in the 1906 earthquake.
"It is appropriate for the postcard be
cause it is part of the original architecture,"
M'Guinness said in an interview. "It seems
to epitomize Stanford from the beginning."
Four other designs by M'Guinness,

depicting Hoover Tower and Memorial
Church, were not chosen.
M'Guinness' watercolor design was un
veiled at Stanford's National Centennial
Celebration in Orange County last week.
Ceremonies accompanying the first day
of issue will be held at the Stanford post
office Sept. 30, the day before the com
mencement of the University's 100 th year.
Among the guests helping mark the oc
casion will be U.S. Postmaster General An
thony Frank and the Postal Board of
Governors. California Gov. George Deuk
meijian has been invited to deliver the
keynote address.
