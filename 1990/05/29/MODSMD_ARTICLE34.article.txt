# Feminist magazine Aurora returns after long hiatus
## 
### Michelle Lin 
Aurora magazine — which portrays
on its cover Hoover Tower as a phallus
being pulled down by the female symbol
— has hit campus for the first time
since the early 1980s.
This quarterly feminist magazine, a
collection of various literary and art
pieces, deals with such issues as beauty,
rape and incest and aims to continue
the "feminist revolution."
About 40 published works were chosen
from 130 submissions, said junior Hilary
Jensen, one of Aurora's rejuvenaters.
"Contrary to what people think, we're
really not that radical," Jensen said.
"This is just a magazine that was created
to present a wide range of views con
cerning women. We were shooting for a
voice for women — a strong voice for
women."
Senior Terri Hopper, who worked on
the magazine, said the reason the mag
azine temporarily stopped publication
was lack of interest in feminism.

One goal of the magazine is "reclaim
ing the word 'feminist' and stripping it
of its (socially imposed) negative conno
tations," according to the magazine's in
troduction.
Another purpose is "to spark discus
sion around campus," according to soph
omore Jennifer Derwingson, a writer for
the magazine.
To accomplish these goals, the articles
portray women as open-minded rather
than man-hating or radical, said writer
Jessica Sibley.
Some readers, however, did not agree.
"It makes it look like all males are
incestuous, wife-beating, insensitive
brutes," said freshman Jason Robinson.
"The magazine was a good idea, but
the cover was a turnoff," said freshman
Nathan Reading.
According to Jensen, who contributed
to the cover art, the image was supposed
to show right-wing conservatism, repre
sented by Hoover Tower, bending under
the influence and growing power of
liberal feminism.
