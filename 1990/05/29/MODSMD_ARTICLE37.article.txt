# Stanford no devil when it comes to details

If World War I made the world
a safe place for democracy, then
the Soviet advance team has
made Stanford a safe place for
photography.
Vladimir Cherneshev, the So
viet chief of protocol, spent
several hours on campus Friday
negotiating the most minute
details of Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev's visit to Stan
ford.
After meeting with University
President Donald Kennedy,
Cherneshev and the Soviet del
egation began a start-to-finish
"walk-through" of the June 4
itinerary proposed by the Uni
versity.
Three hours and three walk
throughs later, Cherneshev
seemed pleased with the results.
Through a translator, he
remarked, "We've got indeed a
very high level of satisfaction
on our side to how they've made

their arrangements."
The Soviets seemed equally
satisfied with the University's
willingness to "un-make" their
arrangements. Cherneshev sug
gested several changes in the
University's proposed itinerary,
including the addition of a Gor
bachev visit to the Art Gallery.
Said Robert Freelen, Stan
ford's vice president for public
affairs, "I gather that [Gorbac
hev] likes art."
Art — and photo opportuni
ties. Cherneshev devoted careful
attention to the visual sur
roundings of each stop on Gor
bachev's itinerary. In the Art
Gallery, he requested the
removal of several temporary
walls.
Freelen's response was imme
diate: "We'll take care of it."
In Memorial Auditorium,
Cherneshev asked whether the
stage could be carpeted. The
University response was imme
diate: "If you want it carpeted,
we can carpet it."

Next, Cherneshev negotiated
a symmetrical arrangement of
armchairs on the stage, as well
as the placement of a low table
in front of each armchair.
Cherneshev's interpreter ex
plained, "He thinks it would be
unfortunate if the photogra
phers (sitting in the front row)
were shooting up at people
through their legs." The tables,
equipped with a "modesty
panel," would hide the legs of
those on stage.
Additionally, Cherneshev re
quested some kind of emblem
or Soviet seal to adorn the
podium and stage. The Univer
sity's response? "If you want us
to make one, we'll make it."
Perhaps it was the Universi
ty's eager-to-please attitude,
rather than last Friday's perfect
weather, which prompted an of
ficial of the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, D.C. to remark, "I
cannot imagine having any
problems here. Wherever in the
world, but not here."
