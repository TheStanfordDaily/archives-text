## 
### Kim Freidberg Editorial staff 
After a trying housing Draw,
another student lottery will take
place this week with a perhaps
more coveted prize: tickets to see
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev deliver a public address June
4 in Memorial Auditorium.
Up to 600 Stanford students
will be randomly chosen out of an
expected pool of 10,000 to attend
the speech, said Michael Ramsey-
Perez, director of Student Organ
ization Services.
However, as of yesterday the
arrangements for faculty and staff
attendance at the speech had not
been formulated, said Ramsey-
Perez.
The duration and content of
Gorbachev's speech in the 1,700-
seat auditorium have not yet been
revealed.
Students can fill out bids Wed
nesday and Thursday in White
Plaza, and 500 to 800 names will
be chosen from the pool.
The selected bids will be evenly
divided between graduate stu
dents and undergraduates.
Several students hoped that
Stanford would prioritize stu
dents, faculty and staff in its
allocation of seats instead of
giving preference to big donors,
alumni and politicians.
"[Seats] should be allocated not
[based] on wealth and status, but
on what people stand to learn
from this," said Leslie Saul, a
senior in political science.
"Gorbachev chose to come to
Stanford because it is primarily
an educational institution," Saul
said. "He has a chance here to
talk to future leaders, and Stan
ford should expose them to him."

will be posted Friday at several
locations in Tresidder Union, and
students on the list will then be
able to pick up their tickets at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
Security arrangements are also
forthcoming and may have an ef
fect on attendance plans, said
Ramsey-Perez.
"Because we are hosts, so much
of it depends on what the Soviet
government would like to see hap
pen," said Ramsey-Perez.
A short waiting list of 50 stu
dents will be created in case some
tickets are not picked up.
However, tickets will not be as
signed to specific individuals,
making them transferable.
Scalped tickets will likely be a hot
commodity.
"If I paid $30 for Billy Joel, I'd
pay $75 for Gorbachev," said
sophomore Chris Seeley.
Many just hoped they would be
blessed with good luck when the
time came to randomly choose the
bids.
"Can we draw in a group?"
joked sophomore Pei-Ran Ho, who
drew 33 with friends in the
housing Draw and hoped his luck
would last through this week's lot
tery.
