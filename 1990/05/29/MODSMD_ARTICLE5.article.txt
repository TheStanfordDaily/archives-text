# Winners and losers in Draw
## Roble most popular choice; 90 percent of undergrads receive assignments 
### J.T.S. Moore Editorial staff 
The envelope, please. This year's most
popular choice in the Draw is . . . Roble Hall,
with a cut-off number of 220 for men and
414 for women.
At the other end of the spectrum, the high
est possible numbers which received on
campus housing assignments were 4,428 and
4,315 for women and men, respectively.
Ninety percent of all undergraduates who
applied for University housing were assigned
in the annual undergraduate housing lottery,

up 4 percent from last year.
Not counting resident assistants and about
1,600 incoming freshmen and transfers, 3,412
students received housing. While only seven
more women were assigned this year, 43 more
men received housing this year than last.
About 75 percent of graduate students
seeking University housing received assign
ments. All housing demands were met for
graduate families and graduate married cou
ples, which have the highest priority in the
graduate Draw.
Perhaps the most shocking performance in
this year's undergraduate Draw was that of

Slavianskii Dom, with a cut-ofT for men of
249, making it appear the second-most
popular house. Slavianskii's cut-ofT for men
was 3,063 last year.
However, this year's cut-off number, with
a priority three, shows the importance of
priorities. Students with priorities one or two
who drew more than 3,000 made it into
Slavianskii.
The Draw number necessary to make it
into Toyon Hall increased significantly for
both women and men. This year's cutoff num-
ber for men was 730; for women
it was a relatively high 1,350. A
requirement to work in the Eating
Clubs to obtain a Toyon priority
may have influenced the decrease
in popularity.
According to Housing Director
Rodger Whitney, the most time
consuming aspect of the Draw was
entering student information into
computers. Once all the data was
fed into the computer, it took "less
than three minutes" to determine

the results of this year's Draw.
Whitney said there is "ab
solutely no room for error in this
system." Consequently, a great
deal of effort is made checking
and double-checking the results.
Any inaccuracies in the data affect
the assignment of all draw num
bers.
A notable difference between
this year's Draw and that of pre
vious years was the elimination
of a second round which normally
took place after Rush and RA se
lection. Whitney said the change
went "beautifully," though he ex
pressed concern about the timing
of the Draw in relation to the

selection of RAs.
Students who applied to be RAs
were notified on the first day of
the Draw whether they received
positions, forcing those who were
not accepted as RAs to scramble
to get Draw groups together.
Referring to the baseball theme
of this year's Draw, Whitney said
that, due to budget cuts, "This
may be the last year for a fun
theme draw."
"I would hate to see a lot of
that tradition lost," he added.
Another change to expect next
year will be the addition of Kim
ball Hall to the Draw.
