# Intruder confronts 2 women
## 
### 
A man posing as a stripper
began masturbating in front
of two freshman women
Sunday morning in Rin
conada House before they
called the police.
According to one of the
women, the man entered the
dormitory through the un
locked front door at about
8:15 a.m. and went to the
all-female second floor.
Spotting a room with an
open door and a decoration
next to it identifying one of
the inhabitants as a sorority
member, the man intro
duced himself to the two
women inside as someone
hired by other sorority
members to perform a strip
tease as a form of initiation,
the woman said.
The woman who is not in
the sorority left the room,
and the sorority member
brought in another friend,
who is also in the sorority.
Although the man was
wearing ordinary clothes
and brought no music to ac
company his performance,
the women were too
"surprised" to suspect he
was an impostor, the woman
said. One of the women of-
fered to play some music for him.
Although he remained evasive
about his employer and which
sorority member had requested a
stripper, the man said he would
remove all his clothes — and pro
ceeded to do so. Then, he began
masturbating, and the women told
him to leave.
The man left immediately,
claiming he had to give another
performance. The women said
they never felt they were in any
physical danger.
While one of the women fol
lowed the man's path through the
middle of the Wilbur Hall com
plex, the other called Stanford
Police, who arrived in a few
minutes.
The suspect was not ap
prehended. Although other
women on the hall had seen the
man enter the dorm, no one saw
the direction in which he left.
One of the women described the
perpetrator as a pale-skinned
white male about six feet tall,
weighing about 170 pounds, with
"shaggy dark brown" hair down
to the middle of his neck and
"dark brown" eyes.
He was wearing a turquoise T
shirt, faded blue jeans and white
high-top sneakers at the time of
the incident.
