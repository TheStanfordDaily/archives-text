# Kennedy on KZSU:
## Teaching still key despite budget cuts 
### Karin Roffman 
Reflecting on a variety of
campus issues last night on
KZSU's "Campus Conference,"
University President Donald
Kennedy commented on his
role in recent events at Stan
ford and expressed the need to
continue improving the hu
manities and teaching.
Responding to a question on
how these improvements will
be made despite the proposed
budget cuts, Kennedy ex
plained that "we have designed
these cuts so that they are not
aimed at the core of the Uni
versity's academic goals."
Kennedy said the role of res
ident fellows has been a major
area of concern in the proposed
budget cut, but he added that
discussions of the extent of RF
responsibilities are "going for
ward in a friendly fashion." He
added that he considers the
work of resident fellows "one
of the best things about under
graduate education."
Commenting on the upcom
ing visit of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, Kennedy
said, "It is a wonderful com
pliment to Stanford, but a
fairly major headache."
Kennedy also said Political

Science Prof. John Manley's
letter to Gorbachev had "ab
solutely nothing" to do with
Gorbachev's decision not to
visit the Hoover Institution.
Kennedy stressed that in an
already extremely tight
schedule, Gorbachev merely
"wanted to simplify" his
itinerary.
Answering a question on the
alleged presence of the League
of Revolutionary Struggle at
St&nford, Kennedy said he
hoped people would allow "the
truth to settle out of this." As
of now, he said, the evidence
for the presence of the League
"is not at all clear. I'm troubled
if the agenda is secret."
However, Kennedy said he
felt that "the truth has a way
of crystallizing."
Explaining why he did not
take any action on the issue of
a recall in the recent ASSU
elections, Kennedy said there
was no need for him to step in.
"When people are dis
satisfied with a political event,
a recall is working within the
process," he said. "My reaction
to Stanford students who said,
'Why don't you do something?'
was to ask them, 'Why don't
you do something?' "
