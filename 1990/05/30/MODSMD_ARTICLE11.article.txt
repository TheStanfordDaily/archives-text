# Hospital designs new programs for patients
## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
Stanford Hospital, in an effort
to contain costs and improve pa
tient services, has designed four
new patient programs intended to
provide the most appropriate level
of care for ambulatory, short-stay
and lower-acuity patients.
These four programs — "Con
tinuity of Care," the Short-Stay
Surgical Unit, the 23-hour Out
patient Program and the Ambu
latory Surgical Center — are
designed to "better address the

needs of patients and their phy
sicians," according to hospital
President Kenneth Bloem.
"Continuity of Care" is de
signed for stable medical and
surgical patients who are too ill
to go home but not sick enough
to require acute hospital care.
They will receive care while
waiting to be placed in a skilled
nursing facility or in rehabilita
tion facilities.
The Short-Stay Surgical Unit
caters to patients who have gone
through less complex types of sur
gery and therefore need less at

tention than patients with more
serious complications. Most
patients will be able to go home
at the end of three days. Prices
— $400 per day — are set lower
than the daily rate and include
meals.
The' 23-hour Outpatient Pro
gram is a pilot service which is
already in operation. It is intended
for patients who need limited
hospital care but do not wish to
enter the hospital as an inpatient
for a full day. Patients come to
the hospital for surgery in the
afternoon and stay to recuperate

until the early morning hours.
The charges for this program
are also lower than the daily in
patient rate. Bloem said the serv
ice has been in great demand and
will be made permanent.
The Ambulatory Surgical Cen
ter, scheduled to open in the fall,
will provide a full range of out
patient surgical services, includ
ing lithotripsy (a procedure to
remove bladder stones), laser
laparoscopy and arthroscopy
(which serve to view the ab
domenal cavity and joints, respec
tively).
