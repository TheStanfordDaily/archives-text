# Students detail Spring Break trip to Gaza Strip

### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
A Stanford delegation that traveled to Israel
over spring break to study the Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip gave
a presentation about the trip last night in
Slavianskii Dom.
This was the sixth time the program, which
has been given at various dorms throughout
the quarter, has been presented. Three stu
dents from the delegation, Diane Carpenter,
Lucia Volk and Dina Hamdy, talked about the
intifadah, the 2-year-old Palestinian resis
tance movement.
Jewish students and others have criticized
the delegation's presentations in the past for
being one-sided. Several students present ex
pressed dissenting views during the presenta
tion.
Hamdy mentioned that Palestinians
employed peaceful methods of resistance in
addition to violent ones such as rock-throwing.
The economic strategies included boycotts of

Israeli goods, strikes and tax resistance, she
said.
Carpenter went on to describe "methods of
Israeli repression" such as a curfew in the
Gaza Strip, the second most densely populated
area in the world.
Carpenter said there is a "pervasive element
of humiliation" in the forms of daily harass
ment. One example she cited was that of a
19-year-old who was shot by a soldier in the
scrotum.
Carpenter added that the most horrifying
form of harassment is the Israeli government's
power to imprison a Palestinian without
charge.
There are several peace movements which
involve both Israelis and Palestinians, said
Volk. One example is "Women for Women
Political Prisoners," in which Israeli women
donate items to Palestinian women prisoners
and act as a link to their families.
The talk was followed by a slide presenta
tion. One slide showed the Intifadah Garden,
which is the "symbol of the growth and con

tinuation of the struggle."
Another slide showed a checkpoint between
Israel proper and the West Bank, where
Carpenter said seven Palestinians were shot
by a gunman a week ago.
During the program, one student from the
audience objected to the "polemical presenta
tion based on a one- or two-week trip."
"I expect a discussion with a thesis, antit
hesis and synthesis in an academic setting. I
am hearing all kinds of blanket assertions,"
the student added.
Another student criticized the fact that Is
raeli policies were portrayed as extremely vi
olent, whereas Palestinians were depicted as
peaceful people. He then mentioned "Arafat's
call for Palestinians to kill as many Jews as
possible."
Delegation member Ann Barhoum, who
taught a winter quarter SWOPSI course on
the intifadeh, explained that the group tried
to contact Israeli government officials to learn
about the Israeli point of view but did not
get to speak to any of them.
