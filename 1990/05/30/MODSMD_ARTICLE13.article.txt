# Mean trick — Statistics doctoral exams do disappearing act
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
When Neil Crellin finished
taking his statistics qualifying ex
aminations on May 20, he felt
relieved, thinking he had passed
a obstacle to obtaining his
doctorate.
He was wrong.
Crellin didn't fail his "quals"
— the tests disappeared from the
Statistics Department. Crellin,
along with 11 of his classmates,
will have to take them again on
Saturday.
The five-hour written exams,

which many students suspect have
been stolen, are the second half
of a 10-hour series of examina
tions that are a prerequisite to
continuing in the statistics doc
toral program here.
Crellin said the tests involve
"relatively hard math-type prob
lems" that cover the three re
quired classes in the first-year
doctoral program: theoretical sta
tistics, applied statistics and ad
vanced probability.
Students who fail their qualify
ing exams the first year are
usually allowed to take them
again the following year, accord

ing to Rebecca Betensky, the grad
uate student who administered
the exams. Five of the 12 students
taking this year's test were taking
it for the second time.
A student who fails twice runs
the risk of being kicked out of
the doctoral program, as the tests
are designed as an indicator of
who is "qualified" to pursue a
doctoral thesis.
When the tests were completed
at 4 p.m. May 20, Betensky col
lected the tests and placed each
student's eight blue books in 12
individual manila envelopes. "I
put them away in the

(departmental) secretary's office
and locked the door," Betensky
said. She said she saw nothing
unusual after that.
On Monday morning, the
departmental secretary noticed
that the tests weren't on her desk,
Crellin said. The department then
conducted a search of the build
ing, including trash cans and a
nearby dumpster.
When Crellin found out that af
ternoon, he was crestfallen. "We
all thought it was a very bad joke,"
he said. "I had felt elated to have
been finished. Many of us felt we
had done well enough to have

passed; people have spent months
preparing for this test."
Crellin said having to retake
the tests was "double jeopardy,"
adding, "It's like being tried for
the incompetence of the depart
ment."
Another student, Craig Kol
lman, asked Statistics Depart
ment Chair Jerome Friedman "to
give us an automatic pass."
But Friedman said yesterday
that the students would be
retested. "The fairest thing would
be to regive the exam as soon as
possible, and that's what we're
doing," he said.

There has been no investigation
by police or the University.
Friedman called judicial affairs
officer Sally Cole when he discov
ered that the tests had disap
peared, but Cole told The Daily
she was not planning to start an
investigation at this time. "There
would have to be some indication
of student involvement and some
suspect" for her to investigate,
she said.
But if someone were proven
guilty, Cole said, there is "ample
precedent" for the person to be
charged under the Fundamental
Standard.
