Protestors threatened
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — The mayor
of Bucharest announced yesterday that au
thorities would clear the city's main square of
anti-Communist protesters by morning. One
demonstrator urged friends and relatives to
come to the square.
About 150 protesters remained in University
Square on a cold and rainy night, continuing
a 38-day-old protest that demands former high
ranking Communists be banned from holding
public office for 10 years.
The government, led by President lon
Iliescu, a former Communist official, has
rejected the demand.
In a statement read on state television,
Mayor Dan Predescu said his office decided
"to take due measures to open traffic" in
University Square because the lengthy block
ade has blocked one of the city's main
thoroughfares and because of the numerous
requests from local people.
Arabs withhold letter
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Arab Leaders yes
terday decided against sending a memorandum
on the Middle East conflict to the superpower
summit after moderates failed to temper
criticism of Washington in the draft.
The memorandum, mostly on the influx of
Soviet Jews to Israel, had become a focus of
discord on how hard a line the Arab League
summit should take against the United States.
"There will be no letter," Iraqi Foreign Min
ister Tariq Aziz said as he emerged from a
closed-door meeting. He refused to elaborate.
The conference was called as a show of Arab
unity against what President Saddam Hussein
has said is a Western and Israeli campaign
against Iraq. It also sought ways to stem the
emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.
Little unity, however, has been apparent so
far in the summit. Syria and Lebanon
boycotted the meeting, and Morocco, Algeria
and Oman sent senior government officials.
Eton celebrates 550 th year
ETON, England (AP) — Old Etonians
thronged "ye distant spires, ye antique towers,
that crown the wat'ry glade," and Queen
Elizabeth II came for lunch yesterday to mark
the 550 th anniversary of Eton College.
The queen praised the school as "second to
none," though she sent her three sons to Gor
donstoun in Scotland. She told students she
had asked the headmaster to give them an
extra holiday each October.
Why October? Because the actual 550 th an
niversary of the foundation of Eton College
by King Henry VI falls on Oct. 11.
Eton celebrated yesterday, a school official
explained, because it was the day before the
annual June 4 holiday in honor of King George
111 — which Eton chose to celebrate on May 30.
