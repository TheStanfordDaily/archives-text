OTTAWA (AP) â€” Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev left, behind wors
ening domestic problems and arrived
yesterday for an overnight visit on his
way to Washington for his second sum
mit meeting with President Bush.
"This is a time of dramatic change
in the world," Gorbachev said after
being welcomed with a military honor
guard and a 21-gun salute.
He noted that he and Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney would discuss a wide
range of subjects in their four hours
of talks, and added: "It is our hope
that this Soviet-Canadian summit will
bring us to a new level of cooperation."
Gorbachev told reporters he was
"somewhat concerned" by the election
yesterday of radical reformer Boris
Yeltsin as president of Russia, the lar
gest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
Yeltsin narrowly defeated Gorba
chev's own candidate in the parliamen
tary elections in Moscow.
The victory gives one of Gorbachev's
most vociferous critics a new platform
from which to criticize his economic
reforms, which Yeltsin contends have
not gone far enough to salvage the
country from severe economic decline.
Gorbachev called the protracted
voting that Yeltsin won "a kind of
faceoff, a kind of confrontation." He
said Yeltsin had been forced to "adjust
his position quite seriously over the
past few days and has adjusted to the
better."
The usually buoyant Gorbachev,
looking tired with deep creases in his
brow, arrived at the Uplands Canadian
Forces Base just outside Ottawa and
was greeted by Governor General Ray
Hnatyshn and Mulroney, who has
some domestic problems of his own
with a separatist movement in Quebec.
Several hundred schoolchildren
looked on, cheering and waving small
Canadian and Soviet flags. Snipers

were posted on rooftops at the airport
and security was tight along Gorba
chev's route to downtown Ottawa.
One house along the route proudly
displayed a large homemade sign in
Russian: "Hello, Mr. President. Come
and have a beer."
Hnatyshn, Queen Elizabeth ll's per

sonal representative in Canada, wel
comed Gorbachev with words of reas
surance.
"Even our schoolchildren know such
words as glasnost and perestroika,
which promise a better future for your
country," said Hnatyshn, a Canadian
of Ukrainian descent.

Mulroney visited Moscow last No
vember and signed 14 agreements to
expand cooperation and trade between
the two northern neighbors, whose
vast territories are linked by the Arctic
Ocean ice cap. It was the first official
visit of a Canadian prime minister to
the Soviet Union in 18 years.
