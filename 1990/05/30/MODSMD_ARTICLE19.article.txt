## Equal opportunity 
### 
JUST SIX MORE days.
On Monday, Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev's en
tourage will arrive on our palm
tree-lined campus. More than
3,000 faculty and staff members
and more than 4,000 students will
have the historic opportunity to
see Gorbachev. Of these fortunate
few, 550 students, 350 faculty and
200 employees will attend his ad
dress in Memorial Auditorium.
Given the scarcity of supply and
excess of demand, a randomly gen
erated computer lottery is probably
the fairest method that can be
devised for distributing tickets.
People whose names are listed
in today's and tomorrow's Daily
will be able to pick up their tickets
on Friday and Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium, and unclaimed tick
ets will be distributed on a first
come, first-served basis Monday.
Though this is a fair system, the

potential for egalitarian distribu
tion can be perverted by people
selling tickets for exorbitant prices.
This reality could develop into a
scalper's dream and a low-income
student's nightmare.
Those who don't want their tick
ets should not pick them up, al
lowing them to be placed in the
pool to be distributed Monday
morning. And only people truly in
terested in seeing Gorbachev
should stand in the inevitably long
line which will probably form out
side the Tresidder ticket office
Sunday night.
Almost 2,000 people who aren't
lucky enough to get a ticket will
still get a chance to see Gorbachev
on simultaneous audio and video
broadcasts at four different
campus locations. This is a good
idea which will allow as many
people as possible to witness a truly
historic visit to the Farm.
