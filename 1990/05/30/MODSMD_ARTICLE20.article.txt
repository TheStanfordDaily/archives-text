WHAT IF YOU had plans
for a reception and
the guest of honor decided
he had better things to do?
If you can imagine that feeling,
you can't help but sympathize with
the Hoover Institution.
A delegation representing Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev had
originally agreed that he would
spend 20 minutes at Hoover during
his upcoming visit to Stanford. But
the Soviet Consul General recently
decided to cancel the visit to Hoo
ver, citing time constraints.
Hoover has just learned an age
old lesson: don't count your chick
ens before they hatch, especially
when prominent public figures are
involved.
Gorbachev's decision to cancel is

understandable, given the
whirlwind of activities on his Stan
ford agenda. In fact, it is surprising
that Hoover was even on the pro
posed agenda in the first place,
given the ideological gap between
the two parties involved.
It is fortunate that the Soviet
President still plans to speak with
students, both personally and in a
public address. The resulting
dialogue will be mutually enrich
ing.
By the same token, students
stand to learn much from the dis
play of Russian and East European
papers and documents that Hoover
was assembling for Gorbachev's
visit. The exhibit remains a public
testimony to Hoover's excellent ar
chives and thorough scholarship.
