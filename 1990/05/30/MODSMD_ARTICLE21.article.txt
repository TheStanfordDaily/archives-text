Stanford and Soviet Union have much in common

WELCOME, COMRADE Gorba
chev! You will feel quite at
home here, since there is a
strange similarity between Stanford's
problems and yours. You and Raisa
will be greeted on our Red Square, the
Quad, by the Kennedys, who are your
mirror images. You will be welcomed
also by George Shultz and his good
wife. We have never had a better
secretary of state. Too bad you didn't
bring Eduard Shevardnadze along; the
Soviet Union never had a better
foreign minister.
If the promised demonstrations
against you take place, that will
remind you of Red Square, but don't
be uspet. When the queen of our
closest ally, Great Britain, visited
Stanford a few years ago, plans for her
and Prince Phillip to visit the Quad
were abandoned for fear that some
demonstrator would take a shot at
them, so they were sneaked in by a
back road and never saw the Quad.
They probably muttered "with friends
like these," etc.
We have our apparatchiks and our
housing problem. While the top ap-

paratchiks live in official dachas, many
of our workers commute from as far
away as Fresno. It's nowhere near as
bad as your housing problem, and we
have a mild climate. Still our
proletariat is complaining, just as
yours is, because the University is
undergoing a perestroika which will
lead to the firing of hundreds.
You have been criticized for having
yourself appointed president without an
election. I once proposed that, to
mitigate the anti-party feeling wide
spread here, the University president
and other top officials serve for a
maximum of two five-year terms. The
proposal was applauded, but nothing
came of it.
Agitprop? We have that too. Until
the present administration, commence
ment was a dignified affair at which
leading academics and other public
figures made significant statements
and illustrated the role of the univer
sity in society. Under perestroika we
have had a series of hack political
figures.
Protests against the change have had
no impact. This year we have a black

woman activist, undoubtedly a fine
person, but again commencement is
being used for agitprop. It makes
activists feel good, but it doesn't really
mean much. Neither they nor the
administrators who name the com
mencement speaker show much sign of
making personal sacrifices.
Glasnost? We have that too. As
editor of the World Affairs Report, I
read Pravda daily, and glasnost clearly
has sharp limits, as the Moscow News
has complained. Our Pravda is the
Campus Report, the best paper of its
kind, run by highly professional people.
However, there too glasnost has im
posed limits.
I wrote a piece about the abuses of
certain minority groups whose actions
demean minorities and debase the
academic process. It was well docu
mented, but the Campus Report
refused to publish it, presumably
because of a possible backlash. Nobel
Prize laureate Milton Friedman volun
tarily wrote a letter protesting this
censorship, but his letter was not
published either. Like you, we have

minorities with real problems, but, like
yours, they can be unreasonable and
violent.
Our Lysenko-Vavilov feud is very
modest. Lysenko believed in the in
heritance of acquired characteristics.
Under the perestroika of our under
graduate requirements, power has been
seized by those who attribute every
thing to nurture, while those who, like
Vavilov, believe in the importance of
nature are branded as enemies of the
party dogma. Some of the University's
best scholars live frustrated and
spurned, like Vavilov. The apparat has
even suggested that some of them take
early retirement. I hope that, like
Vavilov, they will finally see their
merits recognized.
So, welcome to Stanford! My regret
is that you will not see our Medical
School and thus have an opportunity
to express your gratitude for all that
our physicians are doing to help the
Soviet people.
