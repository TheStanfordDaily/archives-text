# School of Medicine lacks effective minority recruitment
## 
### 
Earlier this month, a letter written
by Fernando Lopez, president of the
Hispanic Medical Student Association,
appeared in The Daily. It addressed the
fact the the School of Medicine was
excluded in the evaluation of the prog
ress report on the implementation of
the University Committee on Minority
Issues recommendations.
As Lopez correctly stated, the statis
tics on the admission of medical gradu
ates show that equally qualified minor

ity students are less likely to be admit
ted into residency programs. Since the
selection process is quite subjective, it
is quite easy for faculty members' per
sonal biases or lower comfort levels
around minorities to result in a nega
tive bias in selecting future members
of their departments. Based on the
evidence, we conclude that ethnicity is
indeed a determining factor.
Furthermore, there are many exam
ples of differential treatment of minor
ity medical students during the course
of their medical training. Whether or
not certain influential individuals are
willing to admit it, the reality is that
we as minorities face very real barriers
to the attainment of our professional
goals. Finally, until Medical School

Dean David Korn and his department
chairs are willing to admit that there
has been bias, willful or otherwise, in
the admission of minority residents, we
are convinced that the inequity will
persist.
