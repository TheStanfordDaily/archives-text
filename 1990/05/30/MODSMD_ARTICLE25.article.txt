I HAVE TO BE HONEST, I don't
know what to think about the League
of Revolutionary Struggle and the
controversy surrounding its presence on
campus. For me there are too many un
answered questions to come to a com
fortable conclusion.
Who's in the League of Revolutionary
Struggle? If those people whom Daily
sources name as member of the League
are in fact members of this organization,
are they so ashamed of their politics that
they must hide behind a veil of secrecy?
How can some leaders or representa
tives of communities of color deny having
knowledge of the League, especially since
it has apparently had a significant impact
on these communities, or at least on
several members within the community?
Either these so-called leaders or rep
resentatives are lying, or they are way
out of touch with the communities that
they're supposed to be leading and rep
resenting.
And now that some members of these
communities have come forward and said
they have been recruited or harassed by
the League, will these so-called leaders
acknowledge the stories of these mem
bers, or will they deny that the League
has played a role in campus politics and
that such affected members operate from
personal vendettas due to political con
troversies or failed personal relation
ships?
Given the negative and threatening at
titudes that communism and its support
ers have historically met with in this
country, is it fair for The Daily's sources

to remain anonymous while they "indict"
and discredit other individuals, many of
whom will inevitably feel repercussions
later in their lives as a result of such
accusations?
Are these sources so afraid of harass
ment or of being linked to the League
themselves that they hide behind the pro
tective facade of "unidentified source,"
while the accused face public ostracism
and ridicule without meeting their ac
cusers?
Is The Daily really committed to mul
ticulturalism? If so, as it claims to be,
then why wasn't any person of color on
its staff consulted about the investiga
tion? I know The Daily doesn't have too
many people of color working for it, but
couldn't they find at least one person of
color to act as a consultant? Or does The
Daily believe that all persons of color are
suspect and biased and therefore cannot
serve as objective or honest individuals?
Is this another example of the white
patriarchal power structure that says
people of color are somehow incapable of
running their own lives?
Furthermore, what's the point of
having multicultural editors if they are
not going be consulted on issues that will
have a significant impact on communities
of color? Or are "multicultural editors"
token positions? Given this seemingly
shabby treatment, should people of color
trust The Daily or continue to write for
it?
Have Daily staff members been taking
news reporting lessons from the National
Enquirer, or did the predominance of

Does The Daily believe
that all persons of color
are suspect and biased
and therefore cannot
serve as objective or
honest individuals?

unnamed sources suddenly become a
journalistic standard? What can we ex
pect next from The Daily, an expos 6 of
alien creatures who have taken over the
administration? More importantly, does
The Daily plan to do an expos 6 of the
right wing secret societies, such as the
Ku Klux Klan or Skin Heads, which I
am sure are also present on this campus?
Or is The Daily content to associate pro
gressive politics with communism?
There are a lot of questions surround
ing the League, its purported influence
on campus, and The Daily's reporting of
the story and its treatment of staff mem
bers of color. I think some people owe
us answers. Only then can the Stanford
community begin to figure out just what
in the hell is going on.
