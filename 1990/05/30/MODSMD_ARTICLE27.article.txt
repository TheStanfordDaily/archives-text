## The 						Stanford Community Accusations were made without investigating complete story 
### 
ALL THEY HAD TO DO was ask.
If The Daily, in writing the
article "League has played little
known role in campus politics," had
simply bothered to ask a few basic
questions, it could have avoided
causing extensive confusion, contro
versy and pain.
I find myself today in the unenviable
position of being publicly accused of
associating with a secretive, nationwide
Marxist-Leninist organization which
harbors a hidden agenda and has
supposedly exerted great influence on
Stanford politics.
Although this is not an unusual
charge against those who advocate
social change, I find it ironic that I am
facing accusations of covert activity
when I have worked so hard in the
public eye to shape Stanford's agenda.
I have written 32 columns and arti
cles, given dozens of speeches, written
a book on my interpretation of the
Black Student Union's history, partici
pated in numerous dorm programs and
been featured in Newsweek magazine
and the San Jose Mercury News. It's
news to me that my agenda is some
how "secret."
I could have cleared all this up if
The Daily had simply asked me to
explain the particular charges made
against me. If I had been asked if I
had ever participated in "study
groups," I would have willingly ex-

plained that, yes, I have indeed spoken
at dinner discussions sponsored by
Student Unity Network — a student
group registered with Student Organi
zation Services. (I fail to understand
why the authorized representative of
SUN was not interviewed during the
100-person investigation.)
My role in SUN's discussions is no
different from my participation in
dorm programs or events sponsored by
other student groups and institutions
such as the Doffelmyer Lecture Series.
Everywhere I am asked to speak, I try
to oblige because I think it is impor
tant to contribute to the marketplace
of ideas.
In the past, when reporters from the
Mercury News, Newsweek and other
responsible journalistic institutions
have interviewed me, they've asked a
wide range of questions designed to get
a complete picture of reality. The Daily
failed to live up to this standard.
The Daily simply wanted to know,
"What do you know about the LRS?"
They appeared obsessed with "the
LRS" instead of trying to get a fair
and balanced understanding of the
nature and purpose of my political
activities. Although I told The Daily
what I did know about the League of
Revolutionary Struggle, my actions and
intentions were still misinterpreted and
mis-characterized.
This journalistic lapse has had a

human toll. The stigma resulting from
the inaccurate coverage will follow me
for the rest of my life. People I con
sider dear and close friends have begun
to look at me with suspicion and dis
trust, and those kinds of personal
wounds will be a long time in healing.
What I most resent is the insinua
tion that some outside organization
tells me what to think and do. My
politics are intensely personal and have
more to do with Ray Cochran, my
deceased uncle, than Karl Marx. Al
though my uncle was selected as
Ohio's best college journalist and grad
uated from the prestigious Columbia
school of journalism in the 19505, he
died penniless and unemployed.
Despite the fact that he was a
talented young reporter on the White
House beat, the white journalists at
The Washington Star shunned and
ridiculed him. When he tried to start
his own newspaper, that aspiring black
journalist could not find anyone to
invest in his dream, so the paper
folded, his dream died, and his spirit
was broken. Twenty years later, unable
to obtain adequate medical care, he
died of cancer at the age of 56 — a
casualty of the American Dream.
When I stood over his casket looking
down into the lifeless face of the man
who I loved and who had helped to
raise me, I didn't need any Central
Committee to tell me to fight for

justice. I resolved to do everything in
my power to change this country so
that no other human being would have
to suffer the pain that destroyed my
uncle.
That commitment led me to stop out
of school to devote all of my energy to
changing the Stanford curriculum,
working on Jesse Jackson's presidential
campaign and, yes, speaking at study
groups about possible paths to social
change. As long as I have breath to
speak, I am going to continue to share
what I have learned about why things
are the way they are with anybody
who cares to listen. All you have to do
is ask.
Relatively, my personal difficulties
are insignificant. As Nelson Mandela
observed, "the indignities are a diver
sion." The fundamental issue is that,
intentional or not, The Daily's articles
represent an attack on the progress
made at Stanford in the '80s. To
attack those of us named in the arti
cles is to attack that progress.
I, for one, have been proud to play a
small role in strengthening the BSU,
forging a coalition with students of
color and progressive whites, producing
Stanford's first divestment in history,
creating Cultures, Ideas and Values,
establishing the Universiy Committee
on Minority Issues, hiring faculty of
color, opening up the ASSU to people
of color, diversifying the staff of The

Daily and placing multicultural change
high on the University's agenda. To
imply that those developments are part
of a communist conspiracy is ludicrous,
insulting and diversionary. Whatever
names they call us, we must keep our
eyes on the real prize of justice and
equality, and the struggle must con
tinue.
The Daily has done serious damage
to the cause of multiculturalism on
this campus, and I am disappointed in
my colleagues. Inadequately informed
about the dynamics of multicultural
change, some of those who hold the
most power at The Daily seem to fear
the growing empowerment of people of
color. I am concerned that those fears
may be partially responsible for the
recent coverage and the exclusion of
staff of color from the decision-making
process. I hope that the cries of
betrayal from the writers of color will
help The Daily demonstrate greater
understanding, maturity and com
petence in the future.
If I can shed any more light on this
confusing and highly charged contro
versy, please don't hesitate to give me
a call at The Revolutionary Hotel. I'd
be happy to answer your questions. All
you have to do is ask.

Over the past week, we have .u
-ceived dozens of letters concerning
the May 18 and 23 articles on the
League of Revolutionary Struggle.
Letters have addressed whether The
Daily acted with journalistic integrity
in presenting the stories, what the
extent of the League's influence on
campus may be and the significance
of both issues. The following view
points represent a small sample of
the feedback we have received from
the Stanford community.

cles is to attack that progress.
I, for one, have been proud to play a
small role in strengthening the BSU,
forging a coalition with students of
color and progressive whites, producing
Stanford's first divestment in history,
creating Cultures, Ideas and Values,
establishing the Universiy Committee
on Minority Issues, hiring faculty of
color, opening up the ASSU to people
of color, diversifying the staff of The

Daily and placing multicultural change
high on the University's agenda. To
imply that those developments are part
of a communist conspiracy is ludicrous,
insulting and diversionary. Whatever
names they call us, we must keep our
eyes on the real prize of justice and
equality, and the struggle must con
tinue.
The Daily has done serious damage
to the cause of multiculturalism on
this campus, and I am disappointed in
my colleagues. Inadequately informed
about the dynamics of multicultural
change, some of those who hold the
most power at The Daily seem to fear
the growing empowerment of people of
color. I am concerned that those fears
may be partially responsible for the
recent coverage and the exclusion of
staff of color from the decision-making
process. I hope that the cries of
betrayal from the writers of color will
help The Daily demonstrate greater
understanding, maturity and com
petence in the future.
If I can shed any more light on this
confusing and highly charged contro
versy, please don't hesitate to give me
a call at The Revolutionary Hotel. I'd
be happy to answer your questions. All
you have to do is ask.

Steve Phillips is a multicultural editor
at The Daily.

Over the past week, we have .u
-ceived dozens of letters concerning
the May 18 and 23 articles on the
League of Revolutionary Struggle.
Letters have addressed whether The
Daily acted with journalistic integrity
in presenting the stories, what the
extent of the League's influence on
campus may be and the significance
of both issues. The following view
points represent a small sample of
the feedback we have received from
the Stanford community.


ALL THEY HAD TO DO was ask.
If The Daily, in writing the
article "League has played little
known role in campus politics," had
simply bothered to ask a few basic
questions, it could have avoided
causing extensive confusion, contro
versy and pain.
I find myself today in the unenviable
position of being publicly accused of
associating with a secretive, nationwide
Marxist-Leninist organization which
harbors a hidden agenda and has
supposedly exerted great influence on
Stanford politics.
Although this is not an unusual
charge against those who advocate
social change, I find it ironic that I am
facing accusations of covert activity
when I have worked so hard in the
public eye to shape Stanford's agenda.
I have written 32 columns and arti
cles, given dozens of speeches, written
a book on my interpretation of the
Black Student Union's history, partici
pated in numerous dorm programs and
been featured in Newsweek magazine
and the San Jose Mercury News. It's
news to me that my agenda is some
how "secret."
I could have cleared all this up if
The Daily had simply asked me to
explain the particular charges made
against me. If I had been asked if I
had ever participated in "study
groups," I would have willingly ex-

plained that, yes, I have indeed spoken
at dinner discussions sponsored by
Student Unity Network — a student
group registered with Student Organi
zation Services. (I fail to understand
why the authorized representative of
SUN was not interviewed during the
100-person investigation.)
My role in SUN's discussions is no
different from my participation in
dorm programs or events sponsored by
other student groups and institutions
such as the Doffelmyer Lecture Series.
Everywhere I am asked to speak, I try
to oblige because I think it is impor
tant to contribute to the marketplace
of ideas.
In the past, when reporters from the
Mercury News, Newsweek and other
responsible journalistic institutions
have interviewed me, they've asked a
wide range of questions designed to get
a complete picture of reality. The Daily
failed to live up to this standard.
The Daily simply wanted to know,
"What do you know about the LRS?"
They appeared obsessed with "the
LRS" instead of trying to get a fair
and balanced understanding of the
nature and purpose of my political
activities. Although I told The Daily
what I did know about the League of
Revolutionary Struggle, my actions and
intentions were still misinterpreted and
mis-characterized.
This journalistic lapse has had a

human toll. The stigma resulting from
the inaccurate coverage will follow me
for the rest of my life. People I con
sider dear and close friends have begun
to look at me with suspicion and dis
trust, and those kinds of personal
wounds will be a long time in healing.
What I most resent is the insinua
tion that some outside organization
tells me what to think and do. My
politics are intensely personal and have
more to do with Ray Cochran, my
deceased uncle, than Karl Marx. Al
though my uncle was selected as
Ohio's best college journalist and grad
uated from the prestigious Columbia
school of journalism in the 19505, he
died penniless and unemployed.
Despite the fact that he was a
talented young reporter on the White
House beat, the white journalists at
The Washington Star shunned and
ridiculed him. When he tried to start
his own newspaper, that aspiring black
journalist could not find anyone to
invest in his dream, so the paper
folded, his dream died, and his spirit
was broken. Twenty years later, unable
to obtain adequate medical care, he
died of cancer at the age of 56 — a
casualty of the American Dream.
When I stood over his casket looking
down into the lifeless face of the man
who I loved and who had helped to
raise me, I didn't need any Central
Committee to tell me to fight for

justice. I resolved to do everything in
my power to change this country so
that no other human being would have
to suffer the pain that destroyed my
uncle.
That commitment led me to stop out
of school to devote all of my energy to
changing the Stanford curriculum,
working on Jesse Jackson's presidential
campaign and, yes, speaking at study
groups about possible paths to social
change. As long as I have breath to
speak, I am going to continue to share
what I have learned about why things
are the way they are with anybody
who cares to listen. All you have to do
is ask.
Relatively, my personal difficulties
are insignificant. As Nelson Mandela
observed, "the indignities are a diver
sion." The fundamental issue is that,
intentional or not, The Daily's articles
represent an attack on the progress
made at Stanford in the '80s. To
attack those of us named in the arti
cles is to attack that progress.
