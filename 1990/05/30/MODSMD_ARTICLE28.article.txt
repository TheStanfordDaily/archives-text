# League's tactics include threats
## 
### 
We are all currently active members
of the Chicano community who, as
liberal Democrats, have had first-hand
experiences with the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle.
Three years ago, members of the
League obtained key positions in
MEChA, at which point they began to
physically encircle, verbally harass and
generally intimidate students who op
posed their political views. Their ac
tions created a rift in our community
so deep that, as noted in the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues
report, only 15.2 percent of the Chi
cano student body has ever participated
in any single MEChA event.
We commend The Daily for
documenting the League's existence,
and we salute the Daily for its profes
sionalism. Most of all, we thank Rich
ard Suh, Steve Ostrander and Bacardi
Jackson for bravely speaking out about
the League. They have given us the
courage to finally say what all students
should know. For too long the League
has bullied us into silence. We refuse
to make that mistake again.
Stanford students should not under
estimate how dangerous the League
really is. The League is not dangerous
because of its political ideology (we,
too, value elements of Marxist
thought). Rather, the League is danger
ous because of its insular self
righteousness and active intolerance of
moderate political elements on campus.
Some examples:
When we questioned MEChA tactics
at community meetings, we were called
"disrupters," "community destroyers"
and "sell-outs." When we posted open
community letters questioning
MEChA's views, they were torn down.
When we held meetings to create an
alternative Chicano organization, they
were crashed. When we were vocal in
our opposition to the League, we were
followed, confronted, verbally harssed
and physically encircled by League
members.
On a larger scale, the League's will
ingness to let the ends justify the

means resulted in the campaign to
force El Centro Dean Juan Yniquez to
resign in the spring of 1989 and in the
illegal seizure of University President
Donald Kennedy's office on May 15,
1989.
Furthermore, the League consistently
labels white students who speak out or
document League activities as "racist."
Certain members of The Daily staff are
the latest the League has tried to dis
credit. (Interestingly, the recent League
smear campaign against The Daily has
not questioned The Daily's named
sources.) For the record, as students of
color: we do not consider the Daily
stories to be racist in any way.
The League has indeed operated in
secret, as reported in The Daily. Most
of us were active members of MEChA
for over a year, quite ignorant that it
was actually controlled by another or
ganization. A number of us were
recruited by the League, ultimately
rejecting it.
When we began to question the
League, we did not speak out to
anyone, because we were intimidated
into silence. Only slowly, one by one,
at different times, we talked to each
other, finally realizing the extent of
the League's control over our commu
nity.
We invite all students, particularly
Chicano/Latino freshmen and Daily
reporters, to ask us about our experi
ence with the League. The University
is an open and tolerant community.
League ideology has an inalienable
right to exist here, but intolerance,
secrecy and harassment do not.
