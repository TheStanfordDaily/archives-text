# League has always been well-known
## 
### 
As concerned graduate students we
reject the terms of the argument that
have been put forth over the last week
in The Stanford Daily's coverage of the
League of Revolutionary Struggle's
presence in various progressive groups
on campus.
We ask, what is wrong with being in
the League? According to the democ
racy the right espouses at their con
venience, there is nothing illegal or
immoral about belonging to a leftist
political party. We should judge these
alleged members of the League by
their political program and their activ
ism. If we agree with the necessary
progressive change they have helped to
bring about on campus, then we
should aplaud them, not condemn
them according to a rhetoric that
should have been buried with McCar
thy.
As members of the left, we have
known and worked with members of
the League for years. Whether or not
we agree with all of their agenda, it
has never been hidden, and their politi
cal philosophy has a long-standing
tradition in the nation's political life.
While we are concerned with the
League's tactic of secret membership,
recent attacks by The Stanford Review
and The Daily legitimate their caution.
How can The Daily expect members of
this group to disclose their identity in
the face of such coercion and hostility?
As campus activists, we would like to
address the progressive groups on
campus, specifically the student of
color groups. We cannot let The Daily's
attack create a divisive paranoia or
cripple our agenda in the face of a
conservative backlash. We call on all
progressive students, from the Pro-
Choice Aliance to the Stanford Central
America Action Network, to continue
supporting the "secret" agenda: to
broaden the curriculum to include
other voices, to broaden faculty and
student representation, to broaden the
spectrum of free speech on campus.
These are concerns shared by all pro-

gressive students, not just students of
color, not just the League.
