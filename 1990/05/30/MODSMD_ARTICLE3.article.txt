# Hoover takes Soviet chiefs snub in stride

What would you do if your internationally
known think tank was dumped from Gorba
chev's intinerary? Pound your shoe on a table?
Turn red with rage? Or take it in stride?
Most fellows at the Hoover Institution seem
to be adopting the latter option, saying they
are not disappointed that Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev will pass over Hoover during
his visit to Stanford.
Charles Hill, a senior research
fellow at Hoover and a member
of the committee organizing Gor
bachev's visit to Stanford, said the
mood at Hoover is "the same as
before" and that there is no sense
of disappointment at being passed
over by Gorbachev.
"I think everybody's surprised,"
said Hoover Assoc. Director
Thomas Hendrickson.
Government officials originally
reported that Gorbachev's interest
in Hoover's scholarship helped

lure him to campus. Rumors that
Gorbachev would meet with Hoo
ver scholars and tour Hoover's ex
tensive Eastern European
archives did wonders for the think
tank's reputation in the national
media.
The Soviet Embassy nixed Gor
bachev's stop at Hoover "because
of the tight timing" of his Stan
ford itinerary, Stanford Vice Pres
ident for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen said Monday.
Hoover fellows said they are un
sure why Gorbachev chose not to
visit the think tank. Martin An
derson, a senior research fellow
and former domestic policy ad
viser to President Reagan, noted

that Gorbachev's visit to Hoover
had never been confirmed. He
agreed Gorbachev's decision arose
from a scheduling problem.
Hoover Director John Raisian
was not available for comment.
Hoover fellows do not expect
Gorbachev's change of plans to
negatively affect the tremendous
publicity the think tank has re
ceived from Gorbachev's proposed
visit. Hill said he expects Gorba
chev's decision will spark another
wave of publicity.
Hill said "quite a few papers"
have already contacted Hoover
about the change, and he believes
the new publicity will be positive.
