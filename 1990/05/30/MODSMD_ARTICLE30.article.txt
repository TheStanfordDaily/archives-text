# Daily exercised good journalism

### 
We, as readers of The Daily, believe
that the articles concerning the League
of Revolutionary Struggle, which ap
peared on May 18 and 23, are both
disturbing and highly significant. As
Stanford students, we feel we have the
right to know about secretive or not
so-secretive organizations that exist on
campus. To no one's surprise, both
radical left-wing and right-wing student
organizations have always existed and
are necessary to encourage the diver
sity of views found on a dynamic, in
tellectual campus.
As students, we are more shocked
and concerned to realize that our
friends, who are caring peers and con
scientious students of color, belong to
minority organizations that may be
merely pawns or vehicles for a larger,
more powerful umbrella organization.
Therefore, we feel that the minority
groups should not focus on attacking
these articles, but on the possibility
that they, as students, are being used,
manipulated and influenced in order to
achieve the goals of a national organi
zation.
As students, we all recognize the
amount of fervor, energy and commit
ment we exude — but we also want to
set and achieve our own personal and
global goals. All Stanford students see

the incredible amount of community
service, education and peer support
which student organizations offer;
therefore, we do not want the minority
groups hurt or pushed into an uncom
fortable position by outside forces.
We, as students of color and non
color, did not find the articles of May
18 and 23 to be patronizing, offensive
nor targeting to our ethnicities. Al
though The Daily conveyed the one
sided view that the League existed and
that certain key students were mem
bers of it, had David Brown and Ingrid
Nava returned their phone calls and
made a definitive statement, the story
would have been infinitely more com
prehensive and well-rounded.
Therefore, we feel The Daily pre
sented facts, sources and details in the
most professional manner possible un
der the circumstances. Remember, the
reason some sources refused to release
their names was because they were
fearful of intimidation. We, therefore,
do not find the articles to be a per
sonal attack on the ideas, characters or
views of students of color.
In reply to the related May 24 staff
notebook, why should the entire Daily
staff, including columnists who drop
their articles by The Daily office, be
informed of articles coming out in the
future? For example, it is taken for
granted that The Daily will write
about Gorbachev's visit and the forth
coming security measures, but that
does not mean the entire Daily staff
should get this information before the
rest of the students do.
We, therefore, find that some of the
minority writers of the Daily staff
were unjustified in their demand to
see the articles prior to print.
