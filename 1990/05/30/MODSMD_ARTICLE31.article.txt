# League information was given out of concern for multiculturalism
## 
### 
O, WHAT A TANGLED WEB we
weave, when first we practice to
deceive." Never have I felt this
maxim by Shakespeare to be so true as
I watch the actions of League of
Revolutionary Struggle members over
the last week.
I am writing to explain my motiva
tions in coming out with the truth the
way I did in the May 23 Daily article
on the lieague and to answer some
questions people have fielded to me
about the presence of the League in
the various communities.
I got involved in the Asian-American
community sometime toward the end
of my freshman year. That year was,
in many ways, difficult for me as I
experienced a great deal of culture
shock and alienation as a second
generation Korean-American on a
primarily white campus. That initial
experience eventually led me to an
understanding of how race and culture
dynamics in the United States serve to
disempower and marginalize minorities.
And it was with this understanding

and a desire to help change this situa
tion that I participated in the cam
paign for Asian-American studies last
year and the takeover that eventually
won a tenure-track professorship in
this field.
The bottom line is I care about the
multicultural movement and I feel my
past involvement attests to that. You
can understand then how difficult it
was for me to speak out like I did,
knowing that it could have a harmful
effect on communities of color. Believe
me it was pure agony knowing about
the secretive League and not being
able to tell anybody about it for fear of
betraying people I knew and trusted
and possibly damaging the movement
itself.
But at some point I came to realize
that what was going on within the
communities, with the secret member
ship and recruiting, was wrong and
that the presence of this organization
was actually undermining the very
goals we were striving for.
I was going to talk a little bit about

how I feel particular characteristics of
these Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries,
such as their overzealousness and
fanaticism and tendency to argue end
lessly with people (in their efforts to
resolve "contradictions"), are alienating
many in the Asian-American communi
ty.
However, I decided that the main
issue is not the debate over the ef
ficacy of certain strategies and modes
of interaction, but rather how honest
people are with their intentions and
political motivations when they become
leaders of organizations and coalitions.
That is, I think people should know
whether Marxist -Leninist strategies are
being employed to organize a commu
nity. Otherwise, it's paternalistic,
patronizing and manipulative.
The kind of secrecy upon which the
League depends does more damage to
the communities than it's worth be
cause it paralyzes those who know
about them, gives certain groups a
cohesive power individuals cannot
challenge and thereby makes most

discussions undemocratic. Hand-in
hand with this deception is the unethi
cal way in which certain leaders of the
communities of color use their influ
ence and positions to advance their
peripheral politics and encourage others
to join a purely partisan and, in this
case, a secret, revolutionary organiza
tion.
As I've stated before, I do recognize
the fact that these people are some of
"the best and hardest workers" and
that they've done a tremendous
amount for communities of color in
winning basic resources and establish
ing various programs. (By the way, I
did not mean to imply that hardwork
ing people are communists.) However,
I've come to realize, too, that achieve
ments like these are only one criteria
for judging the "success" of a particu
lar group, organization or government.
Other considerations must be taken
into account, such as the process by
which these things were achieved —
was it truly democratic, truly open to
all, honest and non-repressive.

Again, my point ultimately is not to
be anti-Marxist-Leninist or to red-bait.
One last point — 1 would like to
remind people that after all of this is
over, and the truth finally comes out,
we should concentrate again on issues
of multiculturalism. For the Asian-
American community in particular, this
is the message I want to impart to you
all: that the main task for us is to
find our identities, our cultural selves,
both on an individual and collective
level.
In this way, we will truly be "radi
cal" (because to be bicultural is to be
radical in this Anglo-dominated society)
and avoid falling into the tempting
"wanna-be-white," "wanna-be
bourgeoisie," "let's just party" mental
ity that is prevalent among some sec
tors of our community. With that in
mind, I hope Asian-Americans and
others will reaffirm the importance of
multiculturalism.

amount for communities of color in
winning basic resources and establish
ing various programs. (By the way, I
did not mean to imply that hardwork
ing people are communists.) However,
I've come to realize, too, that achieve
ments like these are only one criteria
for judging the "success" of a particu
lar group, organization or government.
Other considerations must be taken
into account, such as the process by
which these things were achieved —
was it truly democratic, truly open to
all, honest and non-repressive.

Again, my point ultimately is not to
be anti-Marxist-Leninist or to red-bait.
One last point — 1 would like to
remind people that after all of this is
over, and the truth finally comes out,
we should concentrate again on issues
of multiculturalism. For the Asian-
American community in particular, this
is the message I want to impart to you
all: that the main task for us is to
find our identities, our cultural selves,
both on an individual and collective
level.
In this way, we will truly be "radi
cal" (because to be bicultural is to be
radical in this Anglo-dominated society)
and avoid falling into the tempting
"wanna-be-white," "wanna-be
bourgeoisie," "let's just party" mental
ity that is prevalent among some sec
tors of our community. With that in
mind, I hope Asian-Americans and
others will reaffirm the importance of
multiculturalism.
