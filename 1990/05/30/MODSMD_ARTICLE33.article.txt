A. Once again, the Bugs find
• McGee's "On Food and
Cooking" an invaluable
resource. Between it and a
quick tour of Lane Medical Li
brary, we found that several
substances can give food that
"hot" feeling in your mouth.
The most infamous is per
haps the alkaloid capsaicin, the
principle hot component in chili
peppers and other members of
the genus Capsicum. Capsaicin
has been quite extensively
studied as it has several pro
nounced effects on mammalian
physiology. The sensory effect
for which it is best known
seems to be caused by direct
stimulation of heat, pain and
chemo-receptors in the skin
and mouth and the release of
their stored neurotransmitters.
Some of the other side effects
of a fiery meal can also be at
tributed to capsaicin. It has
been shown to alter the body's
thermal regulation, apparently
by stimulating the warm recep
tors in the hypothalamus. You
feel warmer than you really are
and your body responds, which
includes that lovely sweat
which beads up on your
forehead and runs down your
face. Another side effect is
noticeable some time after the
meal when capsaicin stimulates
your gastro-intestinal tract,
usually when you are incon
veniently on Highway 101.
Some of the other substances
which can taste "hot" are
alkaloids — piperine, in white
and black pepper, and zin
gerone, from ginger. Sulfur
containing compounds provide
the bite in mustards and horse
radish in the form of isot
hiocyanate derivatives,
commonly known as mustard
oils, and in garlic as diallyl dis
ulfide. The pharmacology of
these substances is not as well
worked out as it is for cap
saicin.
It seems that plants produce
these substances to make them
less palatable to animals like
us. However, due to some quirk
in human nature, this has
backfired. We seek out the chili
pepper like we listen to the Sex
Pistols.
The Bugs want to stress that
McGee's marriage to Assoc.
Prof, of Biological Sciences
Sharon Long, thesis adviser to

about the Dish — I
never see it move, but
lately it's been pointing in all
different directions. What are
they doing up there — can you
tell from the way it's pointing?
A. We called SRI, the people
• who built the Dish in
1961, and spoke to Roy Long,
who is involved in many of the
experiments that use the dish.
He said that it is being used
by many groups of people these
days, so it's hard to tell what
it's doing at any one time.
These days it is being used
to study pulsars and to revive
some dead satellites. One of
these satellites had received a
command it should have ig
nored that caused it to jam all
incoming signals with its own
transmitter. The Dish's signal
was powerful enough to over
come this jamming and make
the satellite listen to reason.
Lately, they've been trying
to fix a satellite whose trans
mitter failed after launch. By
putting it through a series of
vigorous maneuvers they "hope
to shake any loose connections
back in place." That's NASA
speak for "Give it a swift
and see if that fixes it."
He also said that when the
dish faces roughly south
(actually south-southwest)
pointing horizontally, it is
"parked." Contrary to myth,
this position offers the least
wind resistance to the
strongest prevailing winds and
is not the best angle for zap
ping TVs in Los Altos.
