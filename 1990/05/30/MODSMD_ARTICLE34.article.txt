# Hopkins scientists look for larvae

### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
During spring quarter, most
Stanford students wake up late
and frantically search for a clean
pair of matching socks. At Stan
ford's Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove, however, several re
searchers and graduate students
wake up early to search for bar
nacle larvae.
Prof. Jonathan Roughgarden of
Hopkins, together with postdoc
toral fellow Douglas Stoner and
graduate student Kristi Miller, is
studying barnacle populations in
order to model other marine life
organisms.
"Barnacles are an abundant or
ganism. By studying them, we can
determine the kinds of mecha
nisms that affect other marine
species, like squid," says Miller.
Determining the fluctuations of
marine populations is also of great
economic interest to the seafood
industry.
The great barnacle puzzle, how
ever, is: where do the barnacle
larvae go? "What processes deter
mine the number of larvae set
tling on shore, and how does that
affect people and animals along
the shore?" asks Stoner.
During the mating season of
the hermaphroditic barnacles,
thousands of barnacle babies,
called larvae, are released into the
ocean. The larvae, about a mil
limeter in length, swim freely for
several weeks before finally choos
ing a permanent home.
But barnacle larvae aren't like
homing pigeons — it is hard to
keep track of a species that can

only be seen under a magnifying
glass. They usually float far away
from their parent's rock to spend
the rest of their lives elsewhere.
Predicting exactly how far they
travel is a hard question to an
swer. "If you have barnacles in
one place, and they release kids
into the water, how far they will
go before settling depends on the
currents," says Mark Denny, pro
fessor at Hopkins and an expert
on barnacles.
"You can't just calculate the
rate of flow of water and thus
calculate the distance that the
barnacles travel," Denny contin
ues. The turbulent mixing of the
water near the shore forms em
bayments in which passing larvae
and other plankton can be
entrapped. In order to measure
the actual rate of travel, blobs of
dye are released into the water
and followed for several miles.
This simulates the course of the
barnacle larvae.
"We found that, in reality,
larvae spend about one-tenth of
the time travelling. They are par
titioning time between embay
ments and movement along the
shore. They travel in a sort of
drunkard's walk," says Denny.
The key to understanding the
question of where the larvae go
is the seasonal Monterey winds.
The winds pick up from February
through midsummer. Bent by the
Coriolis effect, the rotation of the
earth, they blow water away from
shore and into the ocean toward
the California current. As the
winds drive shore water away, up
welled water rises from the depths
of the ocean to replace it. This

water is much colder and of dif
ferent density than the muddy and
sandy shore water. It is full of
nutrients that refresh the abun
dant marine life along the coast
and Monterey Bay.
This upwelled water propels
barnacle larvae away from the
shore. Driven by seasonal winds,
the water carries plankton and
fish toward the front that sepa
rate the upwelled water from the
California current. When the wind
dies, the larvae drift back toward
the rocky shore.
The larvae can stay out in the
water for up to six weeks. "What
determines if they come back
depends on the wind," Denny
says. Wind fluctuations affect bar
nacle "recruitment," the settling
of larvae into adult populations.
They also affect other marine life.
"When upwelled water is return
ing to shore, we see a change in
the recruitment record," contin
ues Stoner.
Stoner is currently working on
the hypothesis that on the shore

south of headlands, where land
protrudes from the coastline, bar
nacle populations are not as abun
dant. "The current hits the
headland and is quickly shot off
shore. It doesn't directly go into
the areas south of the headlands;
there is sort of a shadow of
recruitment," speculates Stoner.
Work on barnacle populations
can also furnish information
about ocean currents in the Bay.
Miller, for example, is looking at
the biogeography of barnacles and
how borders between species are
maintained. "Some of the distinct
species borders can be explained
by differences in water tempera
ture," says Miller. For example,
"Some northern species cannot
live in the warmer water around
Santa Barbara and Los Angeles,"
she continues.
"But current patterns are also
separating the north and south
populations. Current during the
reproductive season moves from
north to south, so the larvae move
with it,"says Miller.
When the barnacles finally do
return to shore, they choose a cozy
homesite and settle down. Within
two weeks, they produce cement
for sticking to the slippery rock
that will be their adult home. If
a barnacle has chosen the neigh
borhood well, there is plenty of
passing food to catch with its feet
like organs. If it has chosen poorly,
it dies of starvation.
Meanwhile, no one is still ex
actly sure where it has travelled
in its larval stage. Researchers
continue to wonder where have
all the larvae gone. And so do the
rock fish that feed on them.

north to south, so the larvae move
with it,"says Miller.
When the barnacles finally do
return to shore, they choose a cozy
homesite and settle down. Within
two weeks, they produce cement
for sticking to the slippery rock
that will be their adult home. If
a barnacle has chosen the neigh
borhood well, there is plenty of
passing food to catch with its feet
like organs. If it has chosen poorly,
it dies of starvation.
Meanwhile, no one is still ex
actly sure where it has travelled
in its larval stage. Researchers
continue to wonder where have
all the larvae gone. And so do the
rock fish that feed on them.

During spring quarter, most
Stanford students wake up late
and frantically search for a clean
pair of matching socks. At Stan
ford's Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove, however, several re
searchers and graduate students
wake up early to search for bar
nacle larvae.
Prof. Jonathan Roughgarden of
Hopkins, together with postdoc
toral fellow Douglas Stoner and
graduate student Kristi Miller, is
studying barnacle populations in
order to model other marine life
organisms.
"Barnacles are an abundant or
ganism. By studying them, we can
determine the kinds of mecha
nisms that affect other marine
species, like squid," says Miller.
Determining the fluctuations of
marine populations is also of great
economic interest to the seafood
industry.
The great barnacle puzzle, how
ever, is: where do the barnacle
larvae go? "What processes deter
mine the number of larvae set
tling on shore, and how does that
affect people and animals along
the shore?" asks Stoner.
During the mating season of
the hermaphroditic barnacles,
thousands of barnacle babies,
called larvae, are released into the
ocean. The larvae, about a mil
limeter in length, swim freely for
several weeks before finally choos
ing a permanent home.
But barnacle larvae aren't like
homing pigeons — it is hard to
keep track of a species that can

only be seen under a magnifying
glass. They usually float far away
from their parent's rock to spend
the rest of their lives elsewhere.
Predicting exactly how far they
travel is a hard question to an
swer. "If you have barnacles in
one place, and they release kids
into the water, how far they will
go before settling depends on the
currents," says Mark Denny, pro
fessor at Hopkins and an expert
on barnacles.
"You can't just calculate the
rate of flow of water and thus
calculate the distance that the
barnacles travel," Denny contin
ues. The turbulent mixing of the
water near the shore forms em
bayments in which passing larvae
and other plankton can be
entrapped. In order to measure
the actual rate of travel, blobs of
dye are released into the water
and followed for several miles.
This simulates the course of the
barnacle larvae.
"We found that, in reality,
larvae spend about one-tenth of
the time travelling. They are par
titioning time between embay
ments and movement along the
shore. They travel in a sort of
drunkard's walk," says Denny.
The key to understanding the
question of where the larvae go
is the seasonal Monterey winds.
The winds pick up from February
through midsummer. Bent by the
Coriolis effect, the rotation of the
earth, they blow water away from
shore and into the ocean toward
the California current. As the
winds drive shore water away, up
welled water rises from the depths
of the ocean to replace it. This

water is much colder and of dif
ferent density than the muddy and
sandy shore water. It is full of
nutrients that refresh the abun
dant marine life along the coast
and Monterey Bay.
This upwelled water propels
barnacle larvae away from the
shore. Driven by seasonal winds,
the water carries plankton and
fish toward the front that sepa
rate the upwelled water from the
California current. When the wind
dies, the larvae drift back toward
the rocky shore.
The larvae can stay out in the
water for up to six weeks. "What
determines if they come back
depends on the wind," Denny
says. Wind fluctuations affect bar
nacle "recruitment," the settling
of larvae into adult populations.
They also affect other marine life.
"When upwelled water is return
ing to shore, we see a change in
the recruitment record," contin
ues Stoner.
Stoner is currently working on
the hypothesis that on the shore

south of headlands, where land
protrudes from the coastline, bar
nacle populations are not as abun
dant. "The current hits the
headland and is quickly shot off
shore. It doesn't directly go into
the areas south of the headlands;
there is sort of a shadow of
recruitment," speculates Stoner.
Work on barnacle populations
can also furnish information
about ocean currents in the Bay.
Miller, for example, is looking at
the biogeography of barnacles and
how borders between species are
maintained. "Some of the distinct
species borders can be explained
by differences in water tempera
ture," says Miller. For example,
"Some northern species cannot
live in the warmer water around
Santa Barbara and Los Angeles,"
she continues.
"But current patterns are also
separating the north and south
populations. Current during the
reproductive season moves from
north to south, so the larvae move
with it,"says Miller.
When the barnacles finally do
return to shore, they choose a cozy
homesite and settle down. Within
two weeks, they produce cement
for sticking to the slippery rock
that will be their adult home. If
a barnacle has chosen the neigh
borhood well, there is plenty of
passing food to catch with its feet
like organs. If it has chosen poorly,
it dies of starvation.
Meanwhile, no one is still ex
actly sure where it has travelled
in its larval stage. Researchers
continue to wonder where have
all the larvae gone. And so do the
rock fish that feed on them.
