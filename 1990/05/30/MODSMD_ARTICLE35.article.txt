# Plaque is worse than Cavity Creeps
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
"Look Ma, no cavities!"
For many years, the number of
fillings a person had was used to
gauge how healthy their mouth
was; however, it is actually gum
disease, not tooth decay, which is
the mcyor cause of tooth loss.
The media focus has shifted
toward gum disease in recent
years, due in part to the plaque
and tartar fighting products flood
ing the market.
Individuals are beginning to
realize that although standard
brushing may fend off the Cavity
Creeps, it takes more than just a
quick dose of the Crest Cavity
Fighters to prevent gum disease.
There are two basic types of
gum disease. Gingivitis, a rever
sible condition, is the most com
mon and is characterized by red,
swollen, tender gums.
Periodontitis is more serious: a
chronic inflammation of the
gums, which may be accompanied
by bone and tissue destruction.

Some general symptoms of gum
disease include persistent bad
breath, a bad taste in the mouth
and gums that bleed easily.
The basic cause of gum disease
is plaque, which forms under and
around the gums. Plaque is
caused by the bacteria that nor
mally live in the mouth. It con
sists of the bacteria, the toxic
substances they release and
saliva.
Tartar, on the other hand, is
plaque which hardens to form a
base on which minerals are
deposited. This build-up, although
ugly, does not directly cause gum
disease but may make plaque
removal more difficult.
Although tartar can only be ef
fectively removed by professional
cleanings, proper personal
hygiene is very important for ef
fective plaque control.
Recommendations on dental
hygiene vary greatly, however,
and with the flood of contradic
tory health claims made by dif
ferent products, many consumers
are left confused about how to

best protect their teeth and gums.
Most experts recommend floss
ing once and brushing at least
twice a day; however, the few
hurried seconds most college stu
dents devote to actually caring for
their teeth isn't sufficient.
The average individual, who
isn't in the process of completing
several hundred pages of reading
and a problem set, spends an
average of 30 to 60 seconds brush
ing his or her teeth, but a full
five to 10 minutes is actually
believed to be ideal for efficient
removal of plaque.
Plaque is very sticky and has
been described as almost forming

a chemical bond with the teeth,
so that an individual must work
very hard to pull it off.
Small-headed brushes with soft
nylon bristles are the best choices
for plaque removal, since hard
brushes can be abrasive and dam
age the mouth, while large
brushes are hard to maneuver for
access to molars.
Molars are the most common
site of plaque build-up, probably
because their inaccessibility leads
people to neglect them.
Regardless of the precautions
one takes and the products one
uses, it is still necessary to visit
a dentist for a professional clean
ing every six months to a year to
remove tartar and plaque.
Particularly if your diet resem
bles that of the average college
student, you should give some
serious thought to taking some
preventative action: brushing,
flossing and visiting a dentist reg
ularly. This will ensure that after
you graduate — when you really
have reason to smile — you still
have teeth to display
