# PROPOSED INTERPRETATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
## 
### 
The Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) authors and amends both aca
demic and non-academic codes of conduct
that relate to students. On April 4, the
1989-90 SCLC began the legislative proc
ess, as prescribed by the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, by releasing pro
posed legislation to the University commu
nity for a 30-day comment period.
On May 7, the SCLC, after making minor
changes in the comments that accompa
nied the initial proposal, voted first pas
sage, and released the proposed
legislation for a second comment period of
14 days.
On May 24, the SCLC adopted the Inter
pretation to the Fundamental Standard in
the area of discriminatory harassment. This
bill shall become effective on June 11,1990
as prescribed by the Charter.
SCLC members are:
Faculty Robert Rabin (Chair), Tom Kane,
Mark Mancall, John Perry, Alan
Schwettman, Edward Solomon
Students Ravi Bellur, Perry Friedman,
Constantino Pena
Ex Officio Edwin Sasaki, Ingrid Nava, Sally
Cole
The Fundamental Standard reads:
Students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be suffi
cient cause for removal from the Uni
versity.
This statement remains unchanged and the
new legislation will follow as it appears
below:
PREAMBLE
The Fundamental Standard requires that stu
dents act with "such respect for... the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens." Some
incidents in recent years on campus have
revealed doubt and disagreement about what
this requirement means for students in the
sensitive area where the right of free expression
can conflict with the right to be free of invidious
discrimination. This interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard is offered by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council to provide students and
administrators with guidance in this area.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETA
TION:
FREE EXPRESSION AND
DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of
free inquiry and free expression. Students have
the right to hold and vigorously defend and pro
mote their opinions, thus entering them into the
life of the University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this right
requires that students tolerate even expression
of opinions which they find abhorrent. Intimida
tion of students by other students in their exer
cise of this right, by violence or threat of
violence, is therefore considered to be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committed to principles of
equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each
student has the right of equal access to a Stan
ford education, without discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
Harassment of students on the basis of any of
these characteristics contributes to a hostile en
vironment that makes access to education for
those subjected to it less than equal. Such dis
criminatory harassment is therefore considered
to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is intended to clarify the point at which
protected free expression ends and prohibited
discriminatory harassment begins. Prohibited
harassment includes discriminatory intimidation
by threats of violence, and also includes per
sonal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an indi
vidual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or in
dividuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols.
In the context of discriminatory harassment by
personal vilification, insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols are those "which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and which are
commonly understood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt for human beings on
the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin.

COMMENTS

This interpretation first restates, in Sections 1
and 2, existing University policy on free expres
sion and equal opportunity respectively. Stan
ford has affirmed the principle of free expression
in its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing
itself to support "the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with
which they disagree." The University has
likewise affirmed the principle of non
discrimination, pledging itself in the Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national
and ethnic origin in the administration of its ed
ucational policies." In Section 3, the interpreta
tion recognizes that the free expression and
equal opportunity principles conflict in the area
of discriminatory harassment, and draws the line
for disciplinary purposes at "personal vilification"
that discriminates on one of the bases prohib
ited by the University's non-discrimination
policy.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment,"
rather than just plain harassment?
Some harassing conduct would no doubt vio
late the Fundamental Standard whether or not it
was based on one of the recognized categories
of individous discrimination — for example, if a
student, motivated by jealousy or personal dis
like, harassed another with repeated middle-of
the-night phone calls. Pure face-to-face verbal
abuse, if repeated, might also in some circum
stances fit within the same category, even if not
discriminatory. The question has thus been
raised why we should then define discriminatory
harassment as a separate violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the
reason why the particular kinds of discrimination
mentioned in the University's Statement on Non
discriminatory Policy are singled out for special
prohibition. Obviously it is University policy not
to discriminate against any student in the admin
istration of its educational policies on any arbi
trary or unjust basis. Why then enumerate "sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, and national and ethnic origin" as specially
prohibited bases for discrimination? The reason
is that, in this society at this time, these charac
teristics tend to make individuals the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination.
These characteristics thus tend to serve as the
basis for cumulative discrimination: repetitive
stigma, insult, and indignity on the basis of a fun
damental personal trait. In addition, for most of
the groups suffering such discrimination, a long
history closely associates extreme verbal abuse
with intimidation by physical violence, so that
vilification is experienced as assaultive in the
strict sense. It is the cumulative and socially per
vasive discrimination, often linked to violence,
that distinguishes the intolerable injury of
wounded identity caused by discriminatory har
assment from the tolerable, and relatively ran
domly distributed, hurt of bruised feelings that
results from single incidents of ordinary person
ally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard
protects against.
2. Does not "harassment" by definition re
quire repeated acts by the individual charged?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive pro
posal can constitute prohibited sexual harass
ment, so can a single instance of vilification
constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment.
The reason for this is, again, the socially pervas
ive character of the prohibited forms of discrim
ination. Students with the characteristics in
question have the right to pursue their Stanford
education in an environment that is not more
hostile to them than to others. But the injury of
discriminatory denial of educational access
through maintenance of a hostile environment
can arise from single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal
with a form of abuse that is repetitive to its vic
tims, and hence constitutes the continuing injury
of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit
the individual actions that, when added up,
amount to institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize re
quired?
Student members of groups subject to per
vasive discrimination may be injured by uninten
ded insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well as
by those made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes enforcement
of the prohibition of discriminatory harassment
more difficult, particularly since proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is required to establish
charges of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary
process should only be invoked against inten
tionally insulting or stigmatizing utterances. The
kind of expression defined in Section 4(c) does
not constitute "insulting or 'fighting' words" un
less used with intent to insult. For example, a
student who heard members of minority groups
using the standard insulting terms for their own
group in a joking way among themselves might
— trying to be funny — insensitively use those
terms in the same way. Such a person should
be told that this is not funny, but should not be
subject to disciplinary proceedings. It should
also not be a disciplinary offense for a speaker
to quote or mention in discussion the gutter ep
ithets of discrimination; it is using these epithets
so as to endorse their insulting connotations that
causes serious injury.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number

of individuals" prohibited, and how many are too
many?
The principle of free expression creates a
strong presumption against prohibition of
speech based upon its content. Narrow excep
tions to this presumption are traditionally recog
nized, among other categories, for speech that
is defamatory, assaultive, and (a closely related
category) for speech that constitutes "insulting
or 'fighting' words:" The interpretation adopts
the concept of "personal vilification" to help spell
out what constitutes the prohibited use of fight
ing words in the discrimination context. Personal
vilification is a narrow category of intentionally in
sulting or stigmatizing discriminatory statements
about individuals (4a), directed to those individ
uals (4b), and expressed in viscerally offensive
form (4c).
The requirement of individual address in Sec
tion 4(b) excludes "group defamation" — offen
sive statements concerning social groups
directed to the campus or the public at large.
The purpose of this limitation is to give extra
breathing space for vigorous public debate on
campus, protecting even extreme and hurtful ut
terance in the public contect against potentially
chilling effect of the threat of disciplinary
proceedings.
The expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) is meant to make clear that prohibited
personal vilification does not include "group
defamation" as that term has been understood
in constitutional law and in campus debate. The
clearest case for application of the prohibition of
personal vilification is the face to face vilification
of one individual by another. But more than one
person can be insulted face to face, and vilifica
tion by telephone is not (for our purposes) es
sentially different from vilification that is literally
face to face.
For reasons such as these, the exact contours
of the concept of insult to "a small number of
individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One limiting restriction is that the re
quirements of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that
a "small number" of persons must be no more
than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
5. What is the legal basis for the concept of
"insulting or fighting' words," and what is the
concept's relation to the actual threat of violence
on the one hand, and to the actual infliction of
emotional distress on the other?
In its unanimous decision in Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court
spoke of "certain well-defined and narrowly lim
ited classes of speech" which are outside the
protection of the First Amendment because their
utterance is "no essential part of any exposition
of ideas" and of such "slight social value as a
step to truth" that they can be prohibited on the
basis of "the. social interest in order and
morality." Along with libel and obscenity, this
category was said to include "insulting or 'fight
ing' words — those which by their very ut
terance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace."
In subsequent opinions, the Court has consis
tently reaffirmed the basic Chaplinsky doctrine.
At the same time, the Court has clarified the con
cept of "insulting or 'fighting' words" in two im
portant ways. First, where the state attempts to
punish speech for provoking violence, the threat
of violence must be serious and imminent
{ Gooding v. Wilson, 1972). Second, the "insult
ing or 'fighting' words" exception does not allow
prohibition of utterances offensive to the public
at large, but must be confined to insults or af
fronts addressed directly to individuals, or thrust
upon a captive audience (Cohen v. California,
1971).
The Supreme Court's phrase "insulting or
'fighting' words" is often shortened to simply
"fighting words," an expression which, while
roughly capturing the sort of personally abusive
language we mean to prohibit, may also have
certain misleading connotations. First, the ex
pression may imply that violence is considered
an acceptable response to discriminatory
vilification; but we prohibit these utterances so
that disciplinary proceedings may substitute for,
not supplement, violent response. Second, ex
clusive focus on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of controversial
speech can transform it into forbidden "fighting
words" by plausibly threatening violent re
sponse to it — the so-called "heckler's veto."
The speech, if it is to be subject to restraint, must
also be grossly insulting by the more objective
standard of commonly shared social standards.
Finally, the "fighting words" terminology might
be thought to imply that extreme forms of per
sona! abuse become protected speech simply
because the victims are, for example, such dis
ciplined practitioners of non-violence, or so
physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not, in context, pose
an actual and imminent threat of violent retalia
tion. Such a limitation might be appropriate un
der a breach of the peace statute, whose sole
purpose is to prevent violence, but does not
make sense in an anti-discrimination provision
such as this one.
Another and largely overlapping category of
verbal abuse to which legal sanctions may be
applied is defined by the tort law concept of "in
tentional infliction of emotional distress." Much
of the conduct that we define as discriminatory
harassment might well give rise to a civil suit for
damages under the "emotional distress" rubric.
But that rubric has drawbacks as the legal basis
for a discriminatory harassment regulation. It is
less well established in free speech law than is

the fighting words concept. Further, taken as it
is from tort law, it focuses primarily on the vic
tim's reaction to abuse; the question is whether
he or she suffers "severe emotional distress."
We think it better in defining a disciplinary of
fense to focus on the prohibited conduct; we
prefer not require the victims of personal vilifica
tion to display their psychic scars in order to es
tablish than an offense has been committed.
6. What is included and excluded by the
provision requiring "symbols ... commonly un
derstood to convey direct and visceral hatred or
contempt?"
These terms in Section 4(c) provide the most
significant narrowing element in the definition of
the offense of discriminatory personal vilification.
They limit the offense to cases involving use of
the gutter epithets and symbols of bigotry: those
words, pictures, etc., that are commonly under
stood as assaultive insults whenever they are
seriously directed against members of groups
subject to pervasive discimination. The require
ment that symbols must be "commonly
understood" to insult or stigmatize, and so injure
"by their very utterance," narrows the discretion
of enforcement authorities; it means that partic
ular words or symbols thought to be insulting or
offensive by a social group or by some of its
members must also be so understood across
society as a whole before they meet the pro
posed definition.
The kinds of expression covered are
words or combinations of words (listed, not
exhaustively, and with apologies for the af
front involved even in listing them) such as
"nigger," "kike," "faggot," and "cunt;" sym
bols such as KKK regalia directed at
African-American students, or Nazi
swastikas directed at Jewish students. By
contrast, a symbol like the Confederate
flag, though experienced by many African-
Americans as a racist endorsement of
slavery and segregation, is still widely
enough accepted as an appropriate sym
bol of regional identity and pride that it
would not in our view fall within the "com
monly understood" restriction. The direc
tion of profanities or obscenities as such at
members of groups subject to discrimina
tion is also not covered by the interpreta
tion, nor is expression of dislike, hatred, or
contempt for these groups, in the absence
of the gutter epithets or their pictorial equiv
alents.
Making the prohibition so narrow leaves some
very hurtful forms of discriminatory verbal abuse
unprohibited. Substantively, this restriction is
meant to ensure that no idea as such is
proscribed. There is no view, however racist,
sexist, homophobic, or blasphemous it may be
in content, which cannot be expressed, so long
as those who hold such views do not use the
gutter epithets or their equivalent. Procedurally,
the point of the restriction is to give clear notice
of what the offense is, and to avoid politically
charged contests over the meaning of
debatable words and symbols in the context of
disciplinary proceedings.
7. Does not the narrow definition of vilification
imply approval of all"protected expression" that
falls outside the definition?
Free expression could not survive if institu
tions were held implicitly to endorse every kind
of speech that they did not prohibit. The Stan
ford community can and should vigorously
denounce many forms of expression that are
protected against disciplinary sanction. For ex
ample, while interference with free expression
by force or intimidation violates the Fundamental
Standard, less overt forms of silencing of diverse
expression, such as too hasty charges of rac
ism, sexism, and the like, do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful to individuals and bad
for education; as such, it is to be discouraged,
though by means other than the disciplinary
process.
Similarly, while personal vilification vi
olates the Fundamental Standard, even ex
treme expression of hatred and contempt
for protected groups does not, so long as
it does not contain prohibited insulting or
fighting words, and is not addressed to in
dividual members of the groups insulted.
Yet such extreme expressions of hatred
and contempt cause real harm. Members
of the university community have every
right to denounce them. At the same time,
however, respect for the right of free ex
pression — so critical to a university com
munity — requires that students tolerate
opinions which they find abhorrent. As
stated in Section I, intimidation aimed at
suppressing the exercise of this right
through violence, or the threat of violence,
constitutes a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In general, the disciplinary requirements that
form the content of the Fundamental Standard
are not meant to be a comprehensive account
of good citizenship within the Stanford commu
nity. They are meant only to set a floor of mini
mum requirements of respect for the rights of
others, requirements that can be reasonably
and fairly enforced through a disciplinary proc
ess. The Stanford community should expect
much more of itself by way of tolerance, diversi
ty, free inquiry and the pursuit of equal educa
tional opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.

PREAMBLE
The Fundamental Standard requires that stu
dents act with "such respect for... the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens." Some
incidents in recent years on campus have
revealed doubt and disagreement about what
this requirement means for students in the
sensitive area where the right of free expression
can conflict with the right to be free of invidious
discrimination. This interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard is offered by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council to provide students and
administrators with guidance in this area.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETA
TION:
FREE EXPRESSION AND
DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of
free inquiry and free expression. Students have
the right to hold and vigorously defend and pro
mote their opinions, thus entering them into the
life of the University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this right
requires that students tolerate even expression
of opinions which they find abhorrent. Intimida
tion of students by other students in their exer
cise of this right, by violence or threat of
violence, is therefore considered to be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committed to principles of
equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each
student has the right of equal access to a Stan
ford education, without discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
Harassment of students on the basis of any of
these characteristics contributes to a hostile en
vironment that makes access to education for
those subjected to it less than equal. Such dis
criminatory harassment is therefore considered
to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is intended to clarify the point at which
protected free expression ends and prohibited
discriminatory harassment begins. Prohibited
harassment includes discriminatory intimidation
by threats of violence, and also includes per
sonal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an indi
vidual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or in
dividuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols.
In the context of discriminatory harassment by
personal vilification, insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols are those "which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and which are
commonly understood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt for human beings on
the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin.

COMMENTS

This interpretation first restates, in Sections 1
and 2, existing University policy on free expres
sion and equal opportunity respectively. Stan
ford has affirmed the principle of free expression
in its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing
itself to support "the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with
which they disagree." The University has
likewise affirmed the principle of non
discrimination, pledging itself in the Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national
and ethnic origin in the administration of its ed
ucational policies." In Section 3, the interpreta
tion recognizes that the free expression and
equal opportunity principles conflict in the area
of discriminatory harassment, and draws the line
for disciplinary purposes at "personal vilification"
that discriminates on one of the bases prohib
ited by the University's non-discrimination
policy.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment,"
rather than just plain harassment?
Some harassing conduct would no doubt vio
late the Fundamental Standard whether or not it
was based on one of the recognized categories
of individous discrimination — for example, if a
student, motivated by jealousy or personal dis
like, harassed another with repeated middle-of
the-night phone calls. Pure face-to-face verbal
abuse, if repeated, might also in some circum
stances fit within the same category, even if not
discriminatory. The question has thus been
raised why we should then define discriminatory
harassment as a separate violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the
reason why the particular kinds of discrimination
mentioned in the University's Statement on Non
discriminatory Policy are singled out for special
prohibition. Obviously it is University policy not
to discriminate against any student in the admin
istration of its educational policies on any arbi
trary or unjust basis. Why then enumerate "sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, and national and ethnic origin" as specially
prohibited bases for discrimination? The reason
is that, in this society at this time, these charac
teristics tend to make individuals the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination.
These characteristics thus tend to serve as the
basis for cumulative discrimination: repetitive
stigma, insult, and indignity on the basis of a fun
damental personal trait. In addition, for most of
the groups suffering such discrimination, a long
history closely associates extreme verbal abuse
with intimidation by physical violence, so that
vilification is experienced as assaultive in the
strict sense. It is the cumulative and socially per
vasive discrimination, often linked to violence,
that distinguishes the intolerable injury of
wounded identity caused by discriminatory har
assment from the tolerable, and relatively ran
domly distributed, hurt of bruised feelings that
results from single incidents of ordinary person
ally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard
protects against.
2. Does not "harassment" by definition re
quire repeated acts by the individual charged?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive pro
posal can constitute prohibited sexual harass
ment, so can a single instance of vilification
constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment.
The reason for this is, again, the socially pervas
ive character of the prohibited forms of discrim
ination. Students with the characteristics in
question have the right to pursue their Stanford
education in an environment that is not more
hostile to them than to others. But the injury of
discriminatory denial of educational access
through maintenance of a hostile environment
can arise from single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal
with a form of abuse that is repetitive to its vic
tims, and hence constitutes the continuing injury
of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit
the individual actions that, when added up,
amount to institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize re
quired?
Student members of groups subject to per
vasive discrimination may be injured by uninten
ded insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well as
by those made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes enforcement
of the prohibition of discriminatory harassment
more difficult, particularly since proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is required to establish
charges of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary
process should only be invoked against inten
tionally insulting or stigmatizing utterances. The
kind of expression defined in Section 4(c) does
not constitute "insulting or 'fighting' words" un
less used with intent to insult. For example, a
student who heard members of minority groups
using the standard insulting terms for their own
group in a joking way among themselves might
— trying to be funny — insensitively use those
terms in the same way. Such a person should
be told that this is not funny, but should not be
subject to disciplinary proceedings. It should
also not be a disciplinary offense for a speaker
to quote or mention in discussion the gutter ep
ithets of discrimination; it is using these epithets
so as to endorse their insulting connotations that
causes serious injury.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number

of individuals" prohibited, and how many are too
many?
The principle of free expression creates a
strong presumption against prohibition of
speech based upon its content. Narrow excep
tions to this presumption are traditionally recog
nized, among other categories, for speech that
is defamatory, assaultive, and (a closely related
category) for speech that constitutes "insulting
or 'fighting' words:" The interpretation adopts
the concept of "personal vilification" to help spell
out what constitutes the prohibited use of fight
ing words in the discrimination context. Personal
vilification is a narrow category of intentionally in
sulting or stigmatizing discriminatory statements
about individuals (4a), directed to those individ
uals (4b), and expressed in viscerally offensive
form (4c).
The requirement of individual address in Sec
tion 4(b) excludes "group defamation" — offen
sive statements concerning social groups
directed to the campus or the public at large.
The purpose of this limitation is to give extra
breathing space for vigorous public debate on
campus, protecting even extreme and hurtful ut
terance in the public contect against potentially
chilling effect of the threat of disciplinary
proceedings.
The expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) is meant to make clear that prohibited
personal vilification does not include "group
defamation" as that term has been understood
in constitutional law and in campus debate. The
clearest case for application of the prohibition of
personal vilification is the face to face vilification
of one individual by another. But more than one
person can be insulted face to face, and vilifica
tion by telephone is not (for our purposes) es
sentially different from vilification that is literally
face to face.
For reasons such as these, the exact contours
of the concept of insult to "a small number of
individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One limiting restriction is that the re
quirements of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that
a "small number" of persons must be no more
than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
5. What is the legal basis for the concept of
"insulting or fighting' words," and what is the
concept's relation to the actual threat of violence
on the one hand, and to the actual infliction of
emotional distress on the other?
In its unanimous decision in Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court
spoke of "certain well-defined and narrowly lim
ited classes of speech" which are outside the
protection of the First Amendment because their
utterance is "no essential part of any exposition
of ideas" and of such "slight social value as a
step to truth" that they can be prohibited on the
basis of "the. social interest in order and
morality." Along with libel and obscenity, this
category was said to include "insulting or 'fight
ing' words — those which by their very ut
terance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace."
In subsequent opinions, the Court has consis
tently reaffirmed the basic Chaplinsky doctrine.
At the same time, the Court has clarified the con
cept of "insulting or 'fighting' words" in two im
portant ways. First, where the state attempts to
punish speech for provoking violence, the threat
of violence must be serious and imminent
{ Gooding v. Wilson, 1972). Second, the "insult
ing or 'fighting' words" exception does not allow
prohibition of utterances offensive to the public
at large, but must be confined to insults or af
fronts addressed directly to individuals, or thrust
upon a captive audience (Cohen v. California,
1971).
The Supreme Court's phrase "insulting or
'fighting' words" is often shortened to simply
"fighting words," an expression which, while
roughly capturing the sort of personally abusive
language we mean to prohibit, may also have
certain misleading connotations. First, the ex
pression may imply that violence is considered
an acceptable response to discriminatory
vilification; but we prohibit these utterances so
that disciplinary proceedings may substitute for,
not supplement, violent response. Second, ex
clusive focus on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of controversial
speech can transform it into forbidden "fighting
words" by plausibly threatening violent re
sponse to it — the so-called "heckler's veto."
The speech, if it is to be subject to restraint, must
also be grossly insulting by the more objective
standard of commonly shared social standards.
Finally, the "fighting words" terminology might
be thought to imply that extreme forms of per
sona! abuse become protected speech simply
because the victims are, for example, such dis
ciplined practitioners of non-violence, or so
physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not, in context, pose
an actual and imminent threat of violent retalia
tion. Such a limitation might be appropriate un
der a breach of the peace statute, whose sole
purpose is to prevent violence, but does not
make sense in an anti-discrimination provision
such as this one.
Another and largely overlapping category of
verbal abuse to which legal sanctions may be
applied is defined by the tort law concept of "in
tentional infliction of emotional distress." Much
of the conduct that we define as discriminatory
harassment might well give rise to a civil suit for
damages under the "emotional distress" rubric.
But that rubric has drawbacks as the legal basis
for a discriminatory harassment regulation. It is
less well established in free speech law than is

the fighting words concept. Further, taken as it
is from tort law, it focuses primarily on the vic
tim's reaction to abuse; the question is whether
he or she suffers "severe emotional distress."
We think it better in defining a disciplinary of
fense to focus on the prohibited conduct; we
prefer not require the victims of personal vilifica
tion to display their psychic scars in order to es
tablish than an offense has been committed.
6. What is included and excluded by the
provision requiring "symbols ... commonly un
derstood to convey direct and visceral hatred or
contempt?"
These terms in Section 4(c) provide the most
significant narrowing element in the definition of
the offense of discriminatory personal vilification.
They limit the offense to cases involving use of
the gutter epithets and symbols of bigotry: those
words, pictures, etc., that are commonly under
stood as assaultive insults whenever they are
seriously directed against members of groups
subject to pervasive discimination. The require
ment that symbols must be "commonly
understood" to insult or stigmatize, and so injure
"by their very utterance," narrows the discretion
of enforcement authorities; it means that partic
ular words or symbols thought to be insulting or
offensive by a social group or by some of its
members must also be so understood across
society as a whole before they meet the pro
posed definition.
The kinds of expression covered are
words or combinations of words (listed, not
exhaustively, and with apologies for the af
front involved even in listing them) such as
"nigger," "kike," "faggot," and "cunt;" sym
bols such as KKK regalia directed at
African-American students, or Nazi
swastikas directed at Jewish students. By
contrast, a symbol like the Confederate
flag, though experienced by many African-
Americans as a racist endorsement of
slavery and segregation, is still widely
enough accepted as an appropriate sym
bol of regional identity and pride that it
would not in our view fall within the "com
monly understood" restriction. The direc
tion of profanities or obscenities as such at
members of groups subject to discrimina
tion is also not covered by the interpreta
tion, nor is expression of dislike, hatred, or
contempt for these groups, in the absence
of the gutter epithets or their pictorial equiv
alents.
Making the prohibition so narrow leaves some
very hurtful forms of discriminatory verbal abuse
unprohibited. Substantively, this restriction is
meant to ensure that no idea as such is
proscribed. There is no view, however racist,
sexist, homophobic, or blasphemous it may be
in content, which cannot be expressed, so long
as those who hold such views do not use the
gutter epithets or their equivalent. Procedurally,
the point of the restriction is to give clear notice
of what the offense is, and to avoid politically
charged contests over the meaning of
debatable words and symbols in the context of
disciplinary proceedings.
7. Does not the narrow definition of vilification
imply approval of all"protected expression" that
falls outside the definition?
Free expression could not survive if institu
tions were held implicitly to endorse every kind
of speech that they did not prohibit. The Stan
ford community can and should vigorously
denounce many forms of expression that are
protected against disciplinary sanction. For ex
ample, while interference with free expression
by force or intimidation violates the Fundamental
Standard, less overt forms of silencing of diverse
expression, such as too hasty charges of rac
ism, sexism, and the like, do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful to individuals and bad
for education; as such, it is to be discouraged,
though by means other than the disciplinary
process.
Similarly, while personal vilification vi
olates the Fundamental Standard, even ex
treme expression of hatred and contempt
for protected groups does not, so long as
it does not contain prohibited insulting or
fighting words, and is not addressed to in
dividual members of the groups insulted.
Yet such extreme expressions of hatred
and contempt cause real harm. Members
of the university community have every
right to denounce them. At the same time,
however, respect for the right of free ex
pression — so critical to a university com
munity — requires that students tolerate
opinions which they find abhorrent. As
stated in Section I, intimidation aimed at
suppressing the exercise of this right
through violence, or the threat of violence,
constitutes a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In general, the disciplinary requirements that
form the content of the Fundamental Standard
are not meant to be a comprehensive account
of good citizenship within the Stanford commu
nity. They are meant only to set a floor of mini
mum requirements of respect for the rights of
others, requirements that can be reasonably
and fairly enforced through a disciplinary proc
ess. The Stanford community should expect
much more of itself by way of tolerance, diversi
ty, free inquiry and the pursuit of equal educa
tional opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.
The Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) authors and amends both aca
demic and non-academic codes of conduct
that relate to students. On April 4, the
1989-90 SCLC began the legislative proc
ess, as prescribed by the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, by releasing pro
posed legislation to the University commu
nity for a 30-day comment period.
On May 7, the SCLC, after making minor
changes in the comments that accompa
nied the initial proposal, voted first pas
sage, and released the proposed
legislation for a second comment period of
14 days.
On May 24, the SCLC adopted the Inter
pretation to the Fundamental Standard in
the area of discriminatory harassment. This
bill shall become effective on June 11,1990
as prescribed by the Charter.
SCLC members are:

The Fundamental Standard reads:
Students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be suffi
cient cause for removal from the Uni
versity.
This statement remains unchanged and the
new legislation will follow as it appears
below:
PREAMBLE
The Fundamental Standard requires that stu
dents act with "such respect for... the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens." Some
incidents in recent years on campus have
revealed doubt and disagreement about what
this requirement means for students in the
sensitive area where the right of free expression
can conflict with the right to be free of invidious
discrimination. This interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard is offered by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council to provide students and
administrators with guidance in this area.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETA
TION:
FREE EXPRESSION AND
DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of
free inquiry and free expression. Students have
the right to hold and vigorously defend and pro
mote their opinions, thus entering them into the
life of the University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this right
requires that students tolerate even expression
of opinions which they find abhorrent. Intimida
tion of students by other students in their exer
cise of this right, by violence or threat of
violence, is therefore considered to be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committed to principles of
equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each
student has the right of equal access to a Stan
ford education, without discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
Harassment of students on the basis of any of
these characteristics contributes to a hostile en
vironment that makes access to education for
those subjected to it less than equal. Such dis
criminatory harassment is therefore considered
to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is intended to clarify the point at which
protected free expression ends and prohibited
discriminatory harassment begins. Prohibited
harassment includes discriminatory intimidation
by threats of violence, and also includes per
sonal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an indi
vidual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or in
dividuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols.
In the context of discriminatory harassment by
personal vilification, insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols are those "which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and which are
commonly understood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt for human beings on
the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin.

COMMENTS

This interpretation first restates, in Sections 1
and 2, existing University policy on free expres
sion and equal opportunity respectively. Stan
ford has affirmed the principle of free expression
in its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing
itself to support "the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with
which they disagree." The University has
likewise affirmed the principle of non
discrimination, pledging itself in the Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national
and ethnic origin in the administration of its ed
ucational policies." In Section 3, the interpreta
tion recognizes that the free expression and
equal opportunity principles conflict in the area
of discriminatory harassment, and draws the line
for disciplinary purposes at "personal vilification"
that discriminates on one of the bases prohib
ited by the University's non-discrimination
policy.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment,"
rather than just plain harassment?
Some harassing conduct would no doubt vio
late the Fundamental Standard whether or not it
was based on one of the recognized categories
of individous discrimination — for example, if a
student, motivated by jealousy or personal dis
like, harassed another with repeated middle-of
the-night phone calls. Pure face-to-face verbal
abuse, if repeated, might also in some circum
stances fit within the same category, even if not
discriminatory. The question has thus been
raised why we should then define discriminatory
harassment as a separate violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the
reason why the particular kinds of discrimination
mentioned in the University's Statement on Non
discriminatory Policy are singled out for special
prohibition. Obviously it is University policy not
to discriminate against any student in the admin
istration of its educational policies on any arbi
trary or unjust basis. Why then enumerate "sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, and national and ethnic origin" as specially
prohibited bases for discrimination? The reason
is that, in this society at this time, these charac
teristics tend to make individuals the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination.
These characteristics thus tend to serve as the
basis for cumulative discrimination: repetitive
stigma, insult, and indignity on the basis of a fun
damental personal trait. In addition, for most of
the groups suffering such discrimination, a long
history closely associates extreme verbal abuse
with intimidation by physical violence, so that
vilification is experienced as assaultive in the
strict sense. It is the cumulative and socially per
vasive discrimination, often linked to violence,
that distinguishes the intolerable injury of
wounded identity caused by discriminatory har
assment from the tolerable, and relatively ran
domly distributed, hurt of bruised feelings that
results from single incidents of ordinary person
ally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard
protects against.
2. Does not "harassment" by definition re
quire repeated acts by the individual charged?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive pro
posal can constitute prohibited sexual harass
ment, so can a single instance of vilification
constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment.
The reason for this is, again, the socially pervas
ive character of the prohibited forms of discrim
ination. Students with the characteristics in
question have the right to pursue their Stanford
education in an environment that is not more
hostile to them than to others. But the injury of
discriminatory denial of educational access
through maintenance of a hostile environment
can arise from single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal
with a form of abuse that is repetitive to its vic
tims, and hence constitutes the continuing injury
of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit
the individual actions that, when added up,
amount to institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize re
quired?
Student members of groups subject to per
vasive discrimination may be injured by uninten
ded insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well as
by those made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes enforcement
of the prohibition of discriminatory harassment
more difficult, particularly since proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is required to establish
charges of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary
process should only be invoked against inten
tionally insulting or stigmatizing utterances. The
kind of expression defined in Section 4(c) does
not constitute "insulting or 'fighting' words" un
less used with intent to insult. For example, a
student who heard members of minority groups
using the standard insulting terms for their own
group in a joking way among themselves might
— trying to be funny — insensitively use those
terms in the same way. Such a person should
be told that this is not funny, but should not be
subject to disciplinary proceedings. It should
also not be a disciplinary offense for a speaker
to quote or mention in discussion the gutter ep
ithets of discrimination; it is using these epithets
so as to endorse their insulting connotations that
causes serious injury.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number

of individuals" prohibited, and how many are too
many?
The principle of free expression creates a
strong presumption against prohibition of
speech based upon its content. Narrow excep
tions to this presumption are traditionally recog
nized, among other categories, for speech that
is defamatory, assaultive, and (a closely related
category) for speech that constitutes "insulting
or 'fighting' words:" The interpretation adopts
the concept of "personal vilification" to help spell
out what constitutes the prohibited use of fight
ing words in the discrimination context. Personal
vilification is a narrow category of intentionally in
sulting or stigmatizing discriminatory statements
about individuals (4a), directed to those individ
uals (4b), and expressed in viscerally offensive
form (4c).
The requirement of individual address in Sec
tion 4(b) excludes "group defamation" — offen
sive statements concerning social groups
directed to the campus or the public at large.
The purpose of this limitation is to give extra
breathing space for vigorous public debate on
campus, protecting even extreme and hurtful ut
terance in the public contect against potentially
chilling effect of the threat of disciplinary
proceedings.
The expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) is meant to make clear that prohibited
personal vilification does not include "group
defamation" as that term has been understood
in constitutional law and in campus debate. The
clearest case for application of the prohibition of
personal vilification is the face to face vilification
of one individual by another. But more than one
person can be insulted face to face, and vilifica
tion by telephone is not (for our purposes) es
sentially different from vilification that is literally
face to face.
For reasons such as these, the exact contours
of the concept of insult to "a small number of
individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One limiting restriction is that the re
quirements of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that
a "small number" of persons must be no more
than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
5. What is the legal basis for the concept of
"insulting or fighting' words," and what is the
concept's relation to the actual threat of violence
on the one hand, and to the actual infliction of
emotional distress on the other?
In its unanimous decision in Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court
spoke of "certain well-defined and narrowly lim
ited classes of speech" which are outside the
protection of the First Amendment because their
utterance is "no essential part of any exposition
of ideas" and of such "slight social value as a
step to truth" that they can be prohibited on the
basis of "the. social interest in order and
morality." Along with libel and obscenity, this
category was said to include "insulting or 'fight
ing' words — those which by their very ut
terance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace."
In subsequent opinions, the Court has consis
tently reaffirmed the basic Chaplinsky doctrine.
At the same time, the Court has clarified the con
cept of "insulting or 'fighting' words" in two im
portant ways. First, where the state attempts to
punish speech for provoking violence, the threat
of violence must be serious and imminent
{ Gooding v. Wilson, 1972). Second, the "insult
ing or 'fighting' words" exception does not allow
prohibition of utterances offensive to the public
at large, but must be confined to insults or af
fronts addressed directly to individuals, or thrust
upon a captive audience (Cohen v. California,
1971).
The Supreme Court's phrase "insulting or
'fighting' words" is often shortened to simply
"fighting words," an expression which, while
roughly capturing the sort of personally abusive
language we mean to prohibit, may also have
certain misleading connotations. First, the ex
pression may imply that violence is considered
an acceptable response to discriminatory
vilification; but we prohibit these utterances so
that disciplinary proceedings may substitute for,
not supplement, violent response. Second, ex
clusive focus on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of controversial
speech can transform it into forbidden "fighting
words" by plausibly threatening violent re
sponse to it — the so-called "heckler's veto."
The speech, if it is to be subject to restraint, must
also be grossly insulting by the more objective
standard of commonly shared social standards.
Finally, the "fighting words" terminology might
be thought to imply that extreme forms of per
sona! abuse become protected speech simply
because the victims are, for example, such dis
ciplined practitioners of non-violence, or so
physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not, in context, pose
an actual and imminent threat of violent retalia
tion. Such a limitation might be appropriate un
der a breach of the peace statute, whose sole
purpose is to prevent violence, but does not
make sense in an anti-discrimination provision
such as this one.
Another and largely overlapping category of
verbal abuse to which legal sanctions may be
applied is defined by the tort law concept of "in
tentional infliction of emotional distress." Much
of the conduct that we define as discriminatory
harassment might well give rise to a civil suit for
damages under the "emotional distress" rubric.
But that rubric has drawbacks as the legal basis
for a discriminatory harassment regulation. It is
less well established in free speech law than is

the fighting words concept. Further, taken as it
is from tort law, it focuses primarily on the vic
tim's reaction to abuse; the question is whether
he or she suffers "severe emotional distress."
We think it better in defining a disciplinary of
fense to focus on the prohibited conduct; we
prefer not require the victims of personal vilifica
tion to display their psychic scars in order to es
tablish than an offense has been committed.
6. What is included and excluded by the
provision requiring "symbols ... commonly un
derstood to convey direct and visceral hatred or
contempt?"
These terms in Section 4(c) provide the most
significant narrowing element in the definition of
the offense of discriminatory personal vilification.
They limit the offense to cases involving use of
the gutter epithets and symbols of bigotry: those
words, pictures, etc., that are commonly under
stood as assaultive insults whenever they are
seriously directed against members of groups
subject to pervasive discimination. The require
ment that symbols must be "commonly
understood" to insult or stigmatize, and so injure
"by their very utterance," narrows the discretion
of enforcement authorities; it means that partic
ular words or symbols thought to be insulting or
offensive by a social group or by some of its
members must also be so understood across
society as a whole before they meet the pro
posed definition.
The kinds of expression covered are
words or combinations of words (listed, not
exhaustively, and with apologies for the af
front involved even in listing them) such as
"nigger," "kike," "faggot," and "cunt;" sym
bols such as KKK regalia directed at
African-American students, or Nazi
swastikas directed at Jewish students. By
contrast, a symbol like the Confederate
flag, though experienced by many African-
Americans as a racist endorsement of
slavery and segregation, is still widely
enough accepted as an appropriate sym
bol of regional identity and pride that it
would not in our view fall within the "com
monly understood" restriction. The direc
tion of profanities or obscenities as such at
members of groups subject to discrimina
tion is also not covered by the interpreta
tion, nor is expression of dislike, hatred, or
contempt for these groups, in the absence
of the gutter epithets or their pictorial equiv
alents.
Making the prohibition so narrow leaves some
very hurtful forms of discriminatory verbal abuse
unprohibited. Substantively, this restriction is
meant to ensure that no idea as such is
proscribed. There is no view, however racist,
sexist, homophobic, or blasphemous it may be
in content, which cannot be expressed, so long
as those who hold such views do not use the
gutter epithets or their equivalent. Procedurally,
the point of the restriction is to give clear notice
of what the offense is, and to avoid politically
charged contests over the meaning of
debatable words and symbols in the context of
disciplinary proceedings.
7. Does not the narrow definition of vilification
imply approval of all"protected expression" that
falls outside the definition?
Free expression could not survive if institu
tions were held implicitly to endorse every kind
of speech that they did not prohibit. The Stan
ford community can and should vigorously
denounce many forms of expression that are
protected against disciplinary sanction. For ex
ample, while interference with free expression
by force or intimidation violates the Fundamental
Standard, less overt forms of silencing of diverse
expression, such as too hasty charges of rac
ism, sexism, and the like, do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful to individuals and bad
for education; as such, it is to be discouraged,
though by means other than the disciplinary
process.
Similarly, while personal vilification vi
olates the Fundamental Standard, even ex
treme expression of hatred and contempt
for protected groups does not, so long as
it does not contain prohibited insulting or
fighting words, and is not addressed to in
dividual members of the groups insulted.
Yet such extreme expressions of hatred
and contempt cause real harm. Members
of the university community have every
right to denounce them. At the same time,
however, respect for the right of free ex
pression — so critical to a university com
munity — requires that students tolerate
opinions which they find abhorrent. As
stated in Section I, intimidation aimed at
suppressing the exercise of this right
through violence, or the threat of violence,
constitutes a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In general, the disciplinary requirements that
form the content of the Fundamental Standard
are not meant to be a comprehensive account
of good citizenship within the Stanford commu
nity. They are meant only to set a floor of mini
mum requirements of respect for the rights of
others, requirements that can be reasonably
and fairly enforced through a disciplinary proc
ess. The Stanford community should expect
much more of itself by way of tolerance, diversi
ty, free inquiry and the pursuit of equal educa
tional opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.

PREAMBLE
The Fundamental Standard requires that stu
dents act with "such respect for... the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens." Some
incidents in recent years on campus have
revealed doubt and disagreement about what
this requirement means for students in the
sensitive area where the right of free expression
can conflict with the right to be free of invidious
discrimination. This interpretation of the Funda

FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETA
TION:
FREE EXPRESSION AND
DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of
free inquiry and free expression. Students have
the right to hold and vigorously defend and pro
mote their opinions, thus entering them into the
life of the University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this right
requires that students tolerate even expression
of opinions which they find abhorrent. Intimida
tion of students by other students in their exer
cise of this right, by violence or threat of
violence, is therefore considered to be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committed to principles of
equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each
student has the right of equal access to a Stan
ford education, without discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
Harassment of students on the basis of any of
these characteristics contributes to a hostile en
vironment that makes access to education for
those subjected to it less than equal. Such dis
criminatory harassment is therefore considered
to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is intended to clarify the point at which
protected free expression ends and prohibited
discriminatory harassment begins. Prohibited
harassment includes discriminatory intimidation
by threats of violence, and also includes per
sonal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an indi
vidual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or in
dividuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols.
In the context of discriminatory harassment by
personal vilification, insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols are those "which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and which are
commonly understood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt for human beings on
the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin.

COMMENTS

This interpretation first restates, in Sections 1
and 2, existing University policy on free expres
sion and equal opportunity respectively. Stan
ford has affirmed the principle of free expression
in its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing
itself to support "the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with
which they disagree." The University has
likewise affirmed the principle of non
discrimination, pledging itself in the Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national
and ethnic origin in the administration of its ed
ucational policies." In Section 3, the interpreta
tion recognizes that the free expression and
equal opportunity principles conflict in the area
of discriminatory harassment, and draws the line
for disciplinary purposes at "personal vilification"
that discriminates on one of the bases prohib
ited by the University's non-discrimination
policy.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment,"
rather than just plain harassment?
Some harassing conduct would no doubt vio
late the Fundamental Standard whether or not it
was based on one of the recognized categories
of individous discrimination — for example, if a
student, motivated by jealousy or personal dis
like, harassed another with repeated middle-of
the-night phone calls. Pure face-to-face verbal
abuse, if repeated, might also in some circum
stances fit within the same category, even if not
discriminatory. The question has thus been
raised why we should then define discriminatory
harassment as a separate violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the
reason why the particular kinds of discrimination
mentioned in the University's Statement on Non
discriminatory Policy are singled out for special
prohibition. Obviously it is University policy not
to discriminate against any student in the admin
istration of its educational policies on any arbi
trary or unjust basis. Why then enumerate "sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, and national and ethnic origin" as specially
prohibited bases for discrimination? The reason
is that, in this society at this time, these charac
teristics tend to make individuals the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination.
These characteristics thus tend to serve as the
basis for cumulative discrimination: repetitive
stigma, insult, and indignity on the basis of a fun
damental personal trait. In addition, for most of
the groups suffering such discrimination, a long
history closely associates extreme verbal abuse
with intimidation by physical violence, so that
vilification is experienced as assaultive in the
strict sense. It is the cumulative and socially per
vasive discrimination, often linked to violence,
that distinguishes the intolerable injury of
wounded identity caused by discriminatory har
assment from the tolerable, and relatively ran
domly distributed, hurt of bruised feelings that
results from single incidents of ordinary person
ally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard
protects against.
2. Does not "harassment" by definition re
quire repeated acts by the individual charged?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive pro
posal can constitute prohibited sexual harass
ment, so can a single instance of vilification
constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment.
The reason for this is, again, the socially pervas
ive character of the prohibited forms of discrim
ination. Students with the characteristics in
question have the right to pursue their Stanford
education in an environment that is not more
hostile to them than to others. But the injury of
discriminatory denial of educational access
through maintenance of a hostile environment
can arise from single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal
with a form of abuse that is repetitive to its vic
tims, and hence constitutes the continuing injury
of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit
the individual actions that, when added up,
amount to institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize re
quired?
Student members of groups subject to per
vasive discrimination may be injured by uninten
ded insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well as
by those made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes enforcement
of the prohibition of discriminatory harassment
more difficult, particularly since proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is required to establish
charges of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary
process should only be invoked against inten
tionally insulting or stigmatizing utterances. The
kind of expression defined in Section 4(c) does
not constitute "insulting or 'fighting' words" un
less used with intent to insult. For example, a
student who heard members of minority groups
using the standard insulting terms for their own
group in a joking way among themselves might
— trying to be funny — insensitively use those
terms in the same way. Such a person should
be told that this is not funny, but should not be
subject to disciplinary proceedings. It should
also not be a disciplinary offense for a speaker
to quote or mention in discussion the gutter ep
ithets of discrimination; it is using these epithets
so as to endorse their insulting connotations that
causes serious injury.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number

of individuals" prohibited, and how many are too
many?
The principle of free expression creates a
strong presumption against prohibition of
speech based upon its content. Narrow excep
tions to this presumption are traditionally recog
nized, among other categories, for speech that
is defamatory, assaultive, and (a closely related
category) for speech that constitutes "insulting
or 'fighting' words:" The interpretation adopts
the concept of "personal vilification" to help spell
out what constitutes the prohibited use of fight
ing words in the discrimination context. Personal
vilification is a narrow category of intentionally in
sulting or stigmatizing discriminatory statements
about individuals (4a), directed to those individ
uals (4b), and expressed in viscerally offensive
form (4c).
The requirement of individual address in Sec
tion 4(b) excludes "group defamation" — offen
sive statements concerning social groups
directed to the campus or the public at large.
The purpose of this limitation is to give extra
breathing space for vigorous public debate on
campus, protecting even extreme and hurtful ut
terance in the public contect against potentially
chilling effect of the threat of disciplinary
proceedings.
The expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) is meant to make clear that prohibited
personal vilification does not include "group
defamation" as that term has been understood
in constitutional law and in campus debate. The
clearest case for application of the prohibition of
personal vilification is the face to face vilification
of one individual by another. But more than one
person can be insulted face to face, and vilifica
tion by telephone is not (for our purposes) es
sentially different from vilification that is literally
face to face.
For reasons such as these, the exact contours
of the concept of insult to "a small number of
individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One limiting restriction is that the re
quirements of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that
a "small number" of persons must be no more
than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
5. What is the legal basis for the concept of
"insulting or fighting' words," and what is the
concept's relation to the actual threat of violence
on the one hand, and to the actual infliction of
emotional distress on the other?
In its unanimous decision in Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court
spoke of "certain well-defined and narrowly lim
ited classes of speech" which are outside the
protection of the First Amendment because their
utterance is "no essential part of any exposition
of ideas" and of such "slight social value as a
step to truth" that they can be prohibited on the
basis of "the. social interest in order and
morality." Along with libel and obscenity, this
category was said to include "insulting or 'fight
ing' words — those which by their very ut
terance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace."
In subsequent opinions, the Court has consis
tently reaffirmed the basic Chaplinsky doctrine.
At the same time, the Court has clarified the con
cept of "insulting or 'fighting' words" in two im
portant ways. First, where the state attempts to
punish speech for provoking violence, the threat
of violence must be serious and imminent
{ Gooding v. Wilson, 1972). Second, the "insult
ing or 'fighting' words" exception does not allow
prohibition of utterances offensive to the public
at large, but must be confined to insults or af
fronts addressed directly to individuals, or thrust
upon a captive audience (Cohen v. California,
1971).
The Supreme Court's phrase "insulting or
'fighting' words" is often shortened to simply
"fighting words," an expression which, while
roughly capturing the sort of personally abusive
language we mean to prohibit, may also have
certain misleading connotations. First, the ex
pression may imply that violence is considered
an acceptable response to discriminatory
vilification; but we prohibit these utterances so
that disciplinary proceedings may substitute for,
not supplement, violent response. Second, ex
clusive focus on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of controversial
speech can transform it into forbidden "fighting
words" by plausibly threatening violent re
sponse to it — the so-called "heckler's veto."
The speech, if it is to be subject to restraint, must
also be grossly insulting by the more objective
standard of commonly shared social standards.
Finally, the "fighting words" terminology might
be thought to imply that extreme forms of per
sona! abuse become protected speech simply
because the victims are, for example, such dis
ciplined practitioners of non-violence, or so
physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not, in context, pose
an actual and imminent threat of violent retalia
tion. Such a limitation might be appropriate un
der a breach of the peace statute, whose sole
purpose is to prevent violence, but does not
make sense in an anti-discrimination provision
such as this one.
Another and largely overlapping category of
verbal abuse to which legal sanctions may be
applied is defined by the tort law concept of "in
tentional infliction of emotional distress." Much
of the conduct that we define as discriminatory
harassment might well give rise to a civil suit for
damages under the "emotional distress" rubric.
But that rubric has drawbacks as the legal basis
for a discriminatory harassment regulation. It is
less well established in free speech law than is

the fighting words concept. Further, taken as it
is from tort law, it focuses primarily on the vic
tim's reaction to abuse; the question is whether
he or she suffers "severe emotional distress."
We think it better in defining a disciplinary of
fense to focus on the prohibited conduct; we
prefer not require the victims of personal vilifica
tion to display their psychic scars in order to es
tablish than an offense has been committed.
6. What is included and excluded by the
provision requiring "symbols ... commonly un
derstood to convey direct and visceral hatred or
contempt?"
These terms in Section 4(c) provide the most
significant narrowing element in the definition of
the offense of discriminatory personal vilification.
They limit the offense to cases involving use of
the gutter epithets and symbols of bigotry: those
words, pictures, etc., that are commonly under
stood as assaultive insults whenever they are
seriously directed against members of groups
subject to pervasive discimination. The require
ment that symbols must be "commonly
understood" to insult or stigmatize, and so injure
"by their very utterance," narrows the discretion
of enforcement authorities; it means that partic
ular words or symbols thought to be insulting or
offensive by a social group or by some of its
members must also be so understood across
society as a whole before they meet the pro
posed definition.
The kinds of expression covered are
words or combinations of words (listed, not
exhaustively, and with apologies for the af
front involved even in listing them) such as
"nigger," "kike," "faggot," and "cunt;" sym
bols such as KKK regalia directed at
African-American students, or Nazi
swastikas directed at Jewish students. By
contrast, a symbol like the Confederate
flag, though experienced by many African-
Americans as a racist endorsement of
slavery and segregation, is still widely
enough accepted as an appropriate sym
bol of regional identity and pride that it
would not in our view fall within the "com
monly understood" restriction. The direc
tion of profanities or obscenities as such at
members of groups subject to discrimina
tion is also not covered by the interpreta
tion, nor is expression of dislike, hatred, or
contempt for these groups, in the absence
of the gutter epithets or their pictorial equiv
alents.
Making the prohibition so narrow leaves some
very hurtful forms of discriminatory verbal abuse
unprohibited. Substantively, this restriction is
meant to ensure that no idea as such is
proscribed. There is no view, however racist,
sexist, homophobic, or blasphemous it may be
in content, which cannot be expressed, so long
as those who hold such views do not use the
gutter epithets or their equivalent. Procedurally,
the point of the restriction is to give clear notice
of what the offense is, and to avoid politically
charged contests over the meaning of
debatable words and symbols in the context of
disciplinary proceedings.
7. Does not the narrow definition of vilification
imply approval of all"protected expression" that
falls outside the definition?
Free expression could not survive if institu
tions were held implicitly to endorse every kind
of speech that they did not prohibit. The Stan
ford community can and should vigorously
denounce many forms of expression that are
protected against disciplinary sanction. For ex
ample, while interference with free expression
by force or intimidation violates the Fundamental
Standard, less overt forms of silencing of diverse
expression, such as too hasty charges of rac
ism, sexism, and the like, do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful to individuals and bad
for education; as such, it is to be discouraged,
though by means other than the disciplinary
process.
Similarly, while personal vilification vi
olates the Fundamental Standard, even ex
treme expression of hatred and contempt
for protected groups does not, so long as
it does not contain prohibited insulting or
fighting words, and is not addressed to in
dividual members of the groups insulted.
Yet such extreme expressions of hatred
and contempt cause real harm. Members
of the university community have every
right to denounce them. At the same time,
however, respect for the right of free ex
pression — so critical to a university com
munity — requires that students tolerate
opinions which they find abhorrent. As
stated in Section I, intimidation aimed at
suppressing the exercise of this right
through violence, or the threat of violence,
constitutes a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In general, the disciplinary requirements that
form the content of the Fundamental Standard
are not meant to be a comprehensive account
of good citizenship within the Stanford commu
nity. They are meant only to set a floor of mini
mum requirements of respect for the rights of
others, requirements that can be reasonably
and fairly enforced through a disciplinary proc
ess. The Stanford community should expect
much more of itself by way of tolerance, diversi
ty, free inquiry and the pursuit of equal educa
tional opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.
The Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) authors and amends both aca
demic and non-academic codes of conduct
that relate to students. On April 4, the
1989-90 SCLC began the legislative proc
ess, as prescribed by the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, by releasing pro
posed legislation to the University commu
nity for a 30-day comment period.
On May 7, the SCLC, after making minor
changes in the comments that accompa
nied the initial proposal, voted first pas
sage, and released the proposed
legislation for a second comment period of
14 days.
On May 24, the SCLC adopted the Inter
pretation to the Fundamental Standard in
the area of discriminatory harassment. This
bill shall become effective on June 11,1990
as prescribed by the Charter.
SCLC members are:
Faculty Robert Rabin (Chair), Tom Kane,
Mark Mancall, John Perry, Alan
Schwettman, Edward Solomon
Students Ravi Bellur, Perry Friedman,
Constantino Pena
Ex Officio Edwin Sasaki, Ingrid Nava, Sally
Cole
The Fundamental Standard reads:
Students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be suffi
cient cause for removal from the Uni
versity.
This statement remains unchanged and the
new legislation will follow as it appears
below:
PREAMBLE
The Fundamental Standard requires that stu
dents act with "such respect for... the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens." Some
incidents in recent years on campus have
revealed doubt and disagreement about what
this requirement means for students in the
sensitive area where the right of free expression
can conflict with the right to be free of invidious
discrimination. This interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard is offered by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council to provide students and
administrators with guidance in this area.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETA
TION:
FREE EXPRESSION AND
DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of
free inquiry and free expression. Students have
the right to hold and vigorously defend and pro
mote their opinions, thus entering them into the
life of the University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this right
requires that students tolerate even expression
of opinions which they find abhorrent. Intimida
tion of students by other students in their exer
cise of this right, by violence or threat of
violence, is therefore considered to be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committed to principles of
equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each
student has the right of equal access to a Stan
ford education, without discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
Harassment of students on the basis of any of
these characteristics contributes to a hostile en
vironment that makes access to education for
those subjected to it less than equal. Such dis
criminatory harassment is therefore considered
to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is intended to clarify the point at which
protected free expression ends and prohibited
discriminatory harassment begins. Prohibited
harassment includes discriminatory intimidation
by threats of violence, and also includes per
sonal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an indi
vidual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or in
dividuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols.
In the context of discriminatory harassment by
personal vilification, insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols are those "which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and which are
commonly understood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt for human beings on
the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin.

COMMENTS

This interpretation first restates, in Sections 1
and 2, existing University policy on free expres
sion and equal opportunity respectively. Stan
ford has affirmed the principle of free expression
in its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing
itself to support "the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with
which they disagree." The University has
likewise affirmed the principle of non
discrimination, pledging itself in the Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national
and ethnic origin in the administration of its ed
ucational policies." In Section 3, the interpreta
tion recognizes that the free expression and
equal opportunity principles conflict in the area
of discriminatory harassment, and draws the line
for disciplinary purposes at "personal vilification"
that discriminates on one of the bases prohib
ited by the University's non-discrimination
policy.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment,"
rather than just plain harassment?
Some harassing conduct would no doubt vio
late the Fundamental Standard whether or not it
was based on one of the recognized categories
of individous discrimination — for example, if a
student, motivated by jealousy or personal dis
like, harassed another with repeated middle-of
the-night phone calls. Pure face-to-face verbal
abuse, if repeated, might also in some circum
stances fit within the same category, even if not
discriminatory. The question has thus been
raised why we should then define discriminatory
harassment as a separate violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the
reason why the particular kinds of discrimination
mentioned in the University's Statement on Non
discriminatory Policy are singled out for special
prohibition. Obviously it is University policy not
to discriminate against any student in the admin
istration of its educational policies on any arbi
trary or unjust basis. Why then enumerate "sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, and national and ethnic origin" as specially
prohibited bases for discrimination? The reason
is that, in this society at this time, these charac
teristics tend to make individuals the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination.
These characteristics thus tend to serve as the
basis for cumulative discrimination: repetitive
stigma, insult, and indignity on the basis of a fun
damental personal trait. In addition, for most of
the groups suffering such discrimination, a long
history closely associates extreme verbal abuse
with intimidation by physical violence, so that
vilification is experienced as assaultive in the
strict sense. It is the cumulative and socially per
vasive discrimination, often linked to violence,
that distinguishes the intolerable injury of
wounded identity caused by discriminatory har
assment from the tolerable, and relatively ran
domly distributed, hurt of bruised feelings that
results from single incidents of ordinary person
ally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard
protects against.
2. Does not "harassment" by definition re
quire repeated acts by the individual charged?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive pro
posal can constitute prohibited sexual harass
ment, so can a single instance of vilification
constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment.
The reason for this is, again, the socially pervas
ive character of the prohibited forms of discrim
ination. Students with the characteristics in
question have the right to pursue their Stanford
education in an environment that is not more
hostile to them than to others. But the injury of
discriminatory denial of educational access
through maintenance of a hostile environment
can arise from single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal
with a form of abuse that is repetitive to its vic
tims, and hence constitutes the continuing injury
of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit
the individual actions that, when added up,
amount to institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize re
quired?
Student members of groups subject to per
vasive discrimination may be injured by uninten
ded insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well as
by those made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes enforcement
of the prohibition of discriminatory harassment
more difficult, particularly since proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is required to establish
charges of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary
process should only be invoked against inten
tionally insulting or stigmatizing utterances. The
kind of expression defined in Section 4(c) does
not constitute "insulting or 'fighting' words" un
less used with intent to insult. For example, a
student who heard members of minority groups
using the standard insulting terms for their own
group in a joking way among themselves might
— trying to be funny — insensitively use those
terms in the same way. Such a person should
be told that this is not funny, but should not be
subject to disciplinary proceedings. It should
also not be a disciplinary offense for a speaker
to quote or mention in discussion the gutter ep
ithets of discrimination; it is using these epithets
so as to endorse their insulting connotations that
causes serious injury.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number

of individuals" prohibited, and how many are too
many?
The principle of free expression creates a
strong presumption against prohibition of
speech based upon its content. Narrow excep
tions to this presumption are traditionally recog
nized, among other categories, for speech that
is defamatory, assaultive, and (a closely related
category) for speech that constitutes "insulting
or 'fighting' words:" The interpretation adopts
the concept of "personal vilification" to help spell
out what constitutes the prohibited use of fight
ing words in the discrimination context. Personal
vilification is a narrow category of intentionally in
sulting or stigmatizing discriminatory statements
about individuals (4a), directed to those individ
uals (4b), and expressed in viscerally offensive
form (4c).
The requirement of individual address in Sec
tion 4(b) excludes "group defamation" — offen
sive statements concerning social groups
directed to the campus or the public at large.
The purpose of this limitation is to give extra
breathing space for vigorous public debate on
campus, protecting even extreme and hurtful ut
terance in the public contect against potentially
chilling effect of the threat of disciplinary
proceedings.
The expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) is meant to make clear that prohibited
personal vilification does not include "group
defamation" as that term has been understood
in constitutional law and in campus debate. The
clearest case for application of the prohibition of
personal vilification is the face to face vilification
of one individual by another. But more than one
person can be insulted face to face, and vilifica
tion by telephone is not (for our purposes) es
sentially different from vilification that is literally
face to face.
For reasons such as these, the exact contours
of the concept of insult to "a small number of
individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One limiting restriction is that the re
quirements of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that
a "small number" of persons must be no more
than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
5. What is the legal basis for the concept of
"insulting or fighting' words," and what is the
concept's relation to the actual threat of violence
on the one hand, and to the actual infliction of
emotional distress on the other?
In its unanimous decision in Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court
spoke of "certain well-defined and narrowly lim
ited classes of speech" which are outside the
protection of the First Amendment because their
utterance is "no essential part of any exposition
of ideas" and of such "slight social value as a
step to truth" that they can be prohibited on the
basis of "the. social interest in order and
morality." Along with libel and obscenity, this
category was said to include "insulting or 'fight
ing' words — those which by their very ut
terance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace."
In subsequent opinions, the Court has consis
tently reaffirmed the basic Chaplinsky doctrine.
At the same time, the Court has clarified the con
cept of "insulting or 'fighting' words" in two im
portant ways. First, where the state attempts to
punish speech for provoking violence, the threat
of violence must be serious and imminent
{ Gooding v. Wilson, 1972). Second, the "insult
ing or 'fighting' words" exception does not allow
prohibition of utterances offensive to the public
at large, but must be confined to insults or af
fronts addressed directly to individuals, or thrust
upon a captive audience (Cohen v. California,
1971).
The Supreme Court's phrase "insulting or
'fighting' words" is often shortened to simply
"fighting words," an expression which, while
roughly capturing the sort of personally abusive
language we mean to prohibit, may also have
certain misleading connotations. First, the ex
pression may imply that violence is considered
an acceptable response to discriminatory
vilification; but we prohibit these utterances so
that disciplinary proceedings may substitute for,
not supplement, violent response. Second, ex
clusive focus on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of controversial
speech can transform it into forbidden "fighting
words" by plausibly threatening violent re
sponse to it — the so-called "heckler's veto."
The speech, if it is to be subject to restraint, must
also be grossly insulting by the more objective
standard of commonly shared social standards.
Finally, the "fighting words" terminology might
be thought to imply that extreme forms of per
sona! abuse become protected speech simply
because the victims are, for example, such dis
ciplined practitioners of non-violence, or so
physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not, in context, pose
an actual and imminent threat of violent retalia
tion. Such a limitation might be appropriate un
der a breach of the peace statute, whose sole
purpose is to prevent violence, but does not
make sense in an anti-discrimination provision
such as this one.
Another and largely overlapping category of
verbal abuse to which legal sanctions may be
applied is defined by the tort law concept of "in
tentional infliction of emotional distress." Much
of the conduct that we define as discriminatory
harassment might well give rise to a civil suit for
damages under the "emotional distress" rubric.
But that rubric has drawbacks as the legal basis
for a discriminatory harassment regulation. It is
less well established in free speech law than is

the fighting words concept. Further, taken as it
is from tort law, it focuses primarily on the vic
tim's reaction to abuse; the question is whether
he or she suffers "severe emotional distress."
We think it better in defining a disciplinary of
fense to focus on the prohibited conduct; we
prefer not require the victims of personal vilifica
tion to display their psychic scars in order to es
tablish than an offense has been committed.
6. What is included and excluded by the
provision requiring "symbols ... commonly un
derstood to convey direct and visceral hatred or
contempt?"
These terms in Section 4(c) provide the most
significant narrowing element in the definition of
the offense of discriminatory personal vilification.
They limit the offense to cases involving use of
the gutter epithets and symbols of bigotry: those
words, pictures, etc., that are commonly under
stood as assaultive insults whenever they are
seriously directed against members of groups
subject to pervasive discimination. The require
ment that symbols must be "commonly
understood" to insult or stigmatize, and so injure
"by their very utterance," narrows the discretion
of enforcement authorities; it means that partic
ular words or symbols thought to be insulting or
offensive by a social group or by some of its
members must also be so understood across
society as a whole before they meet the pro
posed definition.
The kinds of expression covered are
words or combinations of words (listed, not
exhaustively, and with apologies for the af
front involved even in listing them) such as
"nigger," "kike," "faggot," and "cunt;" sym
bols such as KKK regalia directed at
African-American students, or Nazi
swastikas directed at Jewish students. By
contrast, a symbol like the Confederate
flag, though experienced by many African-
Americans as a racist endorsement of
slavery and segregation, is still widely
enough accepted as an appropriate sym
bol of regional identity and pride that it
would not in our view fall within the "com
monly understood" restriction. The direc
tion of profanities or obscenities as such at
members of groups subject to discrimina
tion is also not covered by the interpreta
tion, nor is expression of dislike, hatred, or
contempt for these groups, in the absence
of the gutter epithets or their pictorial equiv
alents.
Making the prohibition so narrow leaves some
very hurtful forms of discriminatory verbal abuse
unprohibited. Substantively, this restriction is
meant to ensure that no idea as such is
proscribed. There is no view, however racist,
sexist, homophobic, or blasphemous it may be
in content, which cannot be expressed, so long
as those who hold such views do not use the
gutter epithets or their equivalent. Procedurally,
the point of the restriction is to give clear notice
of what the offense is, and to avoid politically
charged contests over the meaning of
debatable words and symbols in the context of
disciplinary proceedings.
7. Does not the narrow definition of vilification
imply approval of all"protected expression" that
falls outside the definition?
Free expression could not survive if institu
tions were held implicitly to endorse every kind
of speech that they did not prohibit. The Stan
ford community can and should vigorously
denounce many forms of expression that are
protected against disciplinary sanction. For ex
ample, while interference with free expression
by force or intimidation violates the Fundamental
Standard, less overt forms of silencing of diverse
expression, such as too hasty charges of rac
ism, sexism, and the like, do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful to individuals and bad
for education; as such, it is to be discouraged,
though by means other than the disciplinary
process.
Similarly, while personal vilification vi
olates the Fundamental Standard, even ex
treme expression of hatred and contempt
for protected groups does not, so long as
it does not contain prohibited insulting or
fighting words, and is not addressed to in
dividual members of the groups insulted.
Yet such extreme expressions of hatred
and contempt cause real harm. Members
of the university community have every
right to denounce them. At the same time,
however, respect for the right of free ex
pression — so critical to a university com
munity — requires that students tolerate
opinions which they find abhorrent. As
stated in Section I, intimidation aimed at
suppressing the exercise of this right
through violence, or the threat of violence,
constitutes a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In general, the disciplinary requirements that
form the content of the Fundamental Standard
are not meant to be a comprehensive account
of good citizenship within the Stanford commu
nity. They are meant only to set a floor of mini
mum requirements of respect for the rights of
others, requirements that can be reasonably
and fairly enforced through a disciplinary proc
ess. The Stanford community should expect
much more of itself by way of tolerance, diversi
ty, free inquiry and the pursuit of equal educa
tional opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.
The Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) authors and amends both aca
demic and non-academic codes of conduct
that relate to students. On April 4, the
1989-90 SCLC began the legislative proc
ess, as prescribed by the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, by releasing pro
posed legislation to the University commu
nity for a 30-day comment period.
On May 7, the SCLC, after making minor
changes in the comments that accompa
nied the initial proposal, voted first pas
sage, and released the proposed
legislation for a second comment period of
14 days.
On May 24, the SCLC adopted the Inter
pretation to the Fundamental Standard in
the area of discriminatory harassment. This
bill shall become effective on June 11,1990
as prescribed by the Charter.
SCLC members are:

The Fundamental Standard reads:
Students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be suffi
cient cause for removal from the Uni
versity.
This statement remains unchanged and the
new legislation will follow as it appears
below:
PREAMBLE
The Fundamental Standard requires that stu
dents act with "such respect for... the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens." Some
incidents in recent years on campus have
revealed doubt and disagreement about what
this requirement means for students in the
sensitive area where the right of free expression
can conflict with the right to be free of invidious
discrimination. This interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard is offered by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council to provide students and
administrators with guidance in this area.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETA
TION:
FREE EXPRESSION AND
DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of
free inquiry and free expression. Students have
the right to hold and vigorously defend and pro
mote their opinions, thus entering them into the
life of the University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this right
requires that students tolerate even expression
of opinions which they find abhorrent. Intimida
tion of students by other students in their exer
cise of this right, by violence or threat of
violence, is therefore considered to be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committed to principles of
equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each
student has the right of equal access to a Stan
ford education, without discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
Harassment of students on the basis of any of
these characteristics contributes to a hostile en
vironment that makes access to education for
those subjected to it less than equal. Such dis
criminatory harassment is therefore considered
to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is intended to clarify the point at which
protected free expression ends and prohibited
discriminatory harassment begins. Prohibited
harassment includes discriminatory intimidation
by threats of violence, and also includes per
sonal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an indi
vidual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or in
dividuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols.
In the context of discriminatory harassment by
personal vilification, insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols are those "which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and which are
commonly understood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt for human beings on
the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin.

COMMENTS

This interpretation first restates, in Sections 1
and 2, existing University policy on free expres
sion and equal opportunity respectively. Stan
ford has affirmed the principle of free expression
in its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing
itself to support "the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with
which they disagree." The University has
likewise affirmed the principle of non
discrimination, pledging itself in the Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national
and ethnic origin in the administration of its ed
ucational policies." In Section 3, the interpreta
tion recognizes that the free expression and
equal opportunity principles conflict in the area
of discriminatory harassment, and draws the line
for disciplinary purposes at "personal vilification"
that discriminates on one of the bases prohib
ited by the University's non-discrimination
policy.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment,"
rather than just plain harassment?
Some harassing conduct would no doubt vio
late the Fundamental Standard whether or not it
was based on one of the recognized categories
of individous discrimination — for example, if a
student, motivated by jealousy or personal dis
like, harassed another with repeated middle-of
the-night phone calls. Pure face-to-face verbal
abuse, if repeated, might also in some circum
stances fit within the same category, even if not
discriminatory. The question has thus been
raised why we should then define discriminatory
harassment as a separate violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the
reason why the particular kinds of discrimination
mentioned in the University's Statement on Non
discriminatory Policy are singled out for special
prohibition. Obviously it is University policy not
to discriminate against any student in the admin
istration of its educational policies on any arbi
trary or unjust basis. Why then enumerate "sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, and national and ethnic origin" as specially
prohibited bases for discrimination? The reason
is that, in this society at this time, these charac
teristics tend to make individuals the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination.
These characteristics thus tend to serve as the
basis for cumulative discrimination: repetitive
stigma, insult, and indignity on the basis of a fun
damental personal trait. In addition, for most of
the groups suffering such discrimination, a long
history closely associates extreme verbal abuse
with intimidation by physical violence, so that
vilification is experienced as assaultive in the
strict sense. It is the cumulative and socially per
vasive discrimination, often linked to violence,
that distinguishes the intolerable injury of
wounded identity caused by discriminatory har
assment from the tolerable, and relatively ran
domly distributed, hurt of bruised feelings that
results from single incidents of ordinary person
ally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard
protects against.
2. Does not "harassment" by definition re
quire repeated acts by the individual charged?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive pro
posal can constitute prohibited sexual harass
ment, so can a single instance of vilification
constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment.
The reason for this is, again, the socially pervas
ive character of the prohibited forms of discrim
ination. Students with the characteristics in
question have the right to pursue their Stanford
education in an environment that is not more
hostile to them than to others. But the injury of
discriminatory denial of educational access
through maintenance of a hostile environment
can arise from single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal
with a form of abuse that is repetitive to its vic
tims, and hence constitutes the continuing injury
of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit
the individual actions that, when added up,
amount to institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize re
quired?
Student members of groups subject to per
vasive discrimination may be injured by uninten
ded insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well as
by those made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes enforcement
of the prohibition of discriminatory harassment
more difficult, particularly since proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is required to establish
charges of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary
process should only be invoked against inten
tionally insulting or stigmatizing utterances. The
kind of expression defined in Section 4(c) does
not constitute "insulting or 'fighting' words" un
less used with intent to insult. For example, a
student who heard members of minority groups
using the standard insulting terms for their own
group in a joking way among themselves might
— trying to be funny — insensitively use those
terms in the same way. Such a person should
be told that this is not funny, but should not be
subject to disciplinary proceedings. It should
also not be a disciplinary offense for a speaker
to quote or mention in discussion the gutter ep
ithets of discrimination; it is using these epithets
so as to endorse their insulting connotations that
causes serious injury.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number

of individuals" prohibited, and how many are too
many?
The principle of free expression creates a
strong presumption against prohibition of
speech based upon its content. Narrow excep
tions to this presumption are traditionally recog
nized, among other categories, for speech that
is defamatory, assaultive, and (a closely related
category) for speech that constitutes "insulting
or 'fighting' words:" The interpretation adopts
the concept of "personal vilification" to help spell
out what constitutes the prohibited use of fight
ing words in the discrimination context. Personal
vilification is a narrow category of intentionally in
sulting or stigmatizing discriminatory statements
about individuals (4a), directed to those individ
uals (4b), and expressed in viscerally offensive
form (4c).
The requirement of individual address in Sec
tion 4(b) excludes "group defamation" — offen
sive statements concerning social groups
directed to the campus or the public at large.
The purpose of this limitation is to give extra
breathing space for vigorous public debate on
campus, protecting even extreme and hurtful ut
terance in the public contect against potentially
chilling effect of the threat of disciplinary
proceedings.
The expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) is meant to make clear that prohibited
personal vilification does not include "group
defamation" as that term has been understood
in constitutional law and in campus debate. The
clearest case for application of the prohibition of
personal vilification is the face to face vilification
of one individual by another. But more than one
person can be insulted face to face, and vilifica
tion by telephone is not (for our purposes) es
sentially different from vilification that is literally
face to face.
For reasons such as these, the exact contours
of the concept of insult to "a small number of
individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One limiting restriction is that the re
quirements of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that
a "small number" of persons must be no more
than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
5. What is the legal basis for the concept of
"insulting or fighting' words," and what is the
concept's relation to the actual threat of violence
on the one hand, and to the actual infliction of
emotional distress on the other?
In its unanimous decision in Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court
spoke of "certain well-defined and narrowly lim
ited classes of speech" which are outside the
protection of the First Amendment because their
utterance is "no essential part of any exposition
of ideas" and of such "slight social value as a
step to truth" that they can be prohibited on the
basis of "the. social interest in order and
morality." Along with libel and obscenity, this
category was said to include "insulting or 'fight
ing' words — those which by their very ut
terance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace."
In subsequent opinions, the Court has consis
tently reaffirmed the basic Chaplinsky doctrine.
At the same time, the Court has clarified the con
cept of "insulting or 'fighting' words" in two im
portant ways. First, where the state attempts to
punish speech for provoking violence, the threat
of violence must be serious and imminent
{ Gooding v. Wilson, 1972). Second, the "insult
ing or 'fighting' words" exception does not allow
prohibition of utterances offensive to the public
at large, but must be confined to insults or af
fronts addressed directly to individuals, or thrust
upon a captive audience (Cohen v. California,
1971).
The Supreme Court's phrase "insulting or
'fighting' words" is often shortened to simply
"fighting words," an expression which, while
roughly capturing the sort of personally abusive
language we mean to prohibit, may also have
certain misleading connotations. First, the ex
pression may imply that violence is considered
an acceptable response to discriminatory
vilification; but we prohibit these utterances so
that disciplinary proceedings may substitute for,
not supplement, violent response. Second, ex
clusive focus on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of controversial
speech can transform it into forbidden "fighting
words" by plausibly threatening violent re
sponse to it — the so-called "heckler's veto."
The speech, if it is to be subject to restraint, must
also be grossly insulting by the more objective
standard of commonly shared social standards.
Finally, the "fighting words" terminology might
be thought to imply that extreme forms of per
sona! abuse become protected speech simply
because the victims are, for example, such dis
ciplined practitioners of non-violence, or so
physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not, in context, pose
an actual and imminent threat of violent retalia
tion. Such a limitation might be appropriate un
der a breach of the peace statute, whose sole
purpose is to prevent violence, but does not
make sense in an anti-discrimination provision
such as this one.
Another and largely overlapping category of
verbal abuse to which legal sanctions may be
applied is defined by the tort law concept of "in
tentional infliction of emotional distress." Much
of the conduct that we define as discriminatory
harassment might well give rise to a civil suit for
damages under the "emotional distress" rubric.
But that rubric has drawbacks as the legal basis
for a discriminatory harassment regulation. It is
less well established in free speech law than is

the fighting words concept. Further, taken as it
is from tort law, it focuses primarily on the vic
tim's reaction to abuse; the question is whether
he or she suffers "severe emotional distress."
We think it better in defining a disciplinary of
fense to focus on the prohibited conduct; we
prefer not require the victims of personal vilifica
tion to display their psychic scars in order to es
tablish than an offense has been committed.
6. What is included and excluded by the
provision requiring "symbols ... commonly un
derstood to convey direct and visceral hatred or
contempt?"
These terms in Section 4(c) provide the most
significant narrowing element in the definition of
the offense of discriminatory personal vilification.
They limit the offense to cases involving use of
the gutter epithets and symbols of bigotry: those
words, pictures, etc., that are commonly under
stood as assaultive insults whenever they are
seriously directed against members of groups
subject to pervasive discimination. The require
ment that symbols must be "commonly
understood" to insult or stigmatize, and so injure
"by their very utterance," narrows the discretion
of enforcement authorities; it means that partic
ular words or symbols thought to be insulting or
offensive by a social group or by some of its
members must also be so understood across
society as a whole before they meet the pro
posed definition.
The kinds of expression covered are
words or combinations of words (listed, not
exhaustively, and with apologies for the af
front involved even in listing them) such as
"nigger," "kike," "faggot," and "cunt;" sym
bols such as KKK regalia directed at
African-American students, or Nazi
swastikas directed at Jewish students. By
contrast, a symbol like the Confederate
flag, though experienced by many African-
Americans as a racist endorsement of
slavery and segregation, is still widely
enough accepted as an appropriate sym
bol of regional identity and pride that it
would not in our view fall within the "com
monly understood" restriction. The direc
tion of profanities or obscenities as such at
members of groups subject to discrimina
tion is also not covered by the interpreta
tion, nor is expression of dislike, hatred, or
contempt for these groups, in the absence
of the gutter epithets or their pictorial equiv
alents.
Making the prohibition so narrow leaves some
very hurtful forms of discriminatory verbal abuse
unprohibited. Substantively, this restriction is
meant to ensure that no idea as such is
proscribed. There is no view, however racist,
sexist, homophobic, or blasphemous it may be
in content, which cannot be expressed, so long
as those who hold such views do not use the
gutter epithets or their equivalent. Procedurally,
the point of the restriction is to give clear notice
of what the offense is, and to avoid politically
charged contests over the meaning of
debatable words and symbols in the context of
disciplinary proceedings.
7. Does not the narrow definition of vilification
imply approval of all"protected expression" that
falls outside the definition?
Free expression could not survive if institu
tions were held implicitly to endorse every kind
of speech that they did not prohibit. The Stan
ford community can and should vigorously
denounce many forms of expression that are
protected against disciplinary sanction. For ex
ample, while interference with free expression
by force or intimidation violates the Fundamental
Standard, less overt forms of silencing of diverse
expression, such as too hasty charges of rac
ism, sexism, and the like, do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful to individuals and bad
for education; as such, it is to be discouraged,
though by means other than the disciplinary
process.
Similarly, while personal vilification vi
olates the Fundamental Standard, even ex
treme expression of hatred and contempt
for protected groups does not, so long as
it does not contain prohibited insulting or
fighting words, and is not addressed to in
dividual members of the groups insulted.
Yet such extreme expressions of hatred
and contempt cause real harm. Members
of the university community have every
right to denounce them. At the same time,
however, respect for the right of free ex
pression — so critical to a university com
munity — requires that students tolerate
opinions which they find abhorrent. As
stated in Section I, intimidation aimed at
suppressing the exercise of this right
through violence, or the threat of violence,
constitutes a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In general, the disciplinary requirements that
form the content of the Fundamental Standard
are not meant to be a comprehensive account
of good citizenship within the Stanford commu
nity. They are meant only to set a floor of mini
mum requirements of respect for the rights of
others, requirements that can be reasonably
and fairly enforced through a disciplinary proc
ess. The Stanford community should expect
much more of itself by way of tolerance, diversi
ty, free inquiry and the pursuit of equal educa
tional opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.

PREAMBLE
The Fundamental Standard requires that stu
dents act with "such respect for... the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens." Some
incidents in recent years on campus have
revealed doubt and disagreement about what
this requirement means for students in the
sensitive area where the right of free expression
can conflict with the right to be free of invidious
discrimination. This interpretation of the Funda

FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETA
TION:
FREE EXPRESSION AND
DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of
free inquiry and free expression. Students have
the right to hold and vigorously defend and pro
mote their opinions, thus entering them into the
life of the University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this right
requires that students tolerate even expression
of opinions which they find abhorrent. Intimida
tion of students by other students in their exer
cise of this right, by violence or threat of
violence, is therefore considered to be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committed to principles of
equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each
student has the right of equal access to a Stan
ford education, without discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
Harassment of students on the basis of any of
these characteristics contributes to a hostile en
vironment that makes access to education for
those subjected to it less than equal. Such dis
criminatory harassment is therefore considered
to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard is intended to clarify the point at which
protected free expression ends and prohibited
discriminatory harassment begins. Prohibited
harassment includes discriminatory intimidation
by threats of violence, and also includes per
sonal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an indi
vidual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or in
dividuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols.
In the context of discriminatory harassment by
personal vilification, insulting or "fighting" words
or non-verbal symbols are those "which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and which are
commonly understood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt for human beings on
the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic
origin.

COMMENTS

This interpretation first restates, in Sections 1
and 2, existing University policy on free expres
sion and equal opportunity respectively. Stan
ford has affirmed the principle of free expression
in its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing
itself to support "the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with
which they disagree." The University has
likewise affirmed the principle of non
discrimination, pledging itself in the Statement of
Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national
and ethnic origin in the administration of its ed
ucational policies." In Section 3, the interpreta
tion recognizes that the free expression and
equal opportunity principles conflict in the area
of discriminatory harassment, and draws the line
for disciplinary purposes at "personal vilification"
that discriminates on one of the bases prohib
ited by the University's non-discrimination
policy.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment,"
rather than just plain harassment?
Some harassing conduct would no doubt vio
late the Fundamental Standard whether or not it
was based on one of the recognized categories
of individous discrimination — for example, if a
student, motivated by jealousy or personal dis
like, harassed another with repeated middle-of
the-night phone calls. Pure face-to-face verbal
abuse, if repeated, might also in some circum
stances fit within the same category, even if not
discriminatory. The question has thus been
raised why we should then define discriminatory
harassment as a separate violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the
reason why the particular kinds of discrimination
mentioned in the University's Statement on Non
discriminatory Policy are singled out for special
prohibition. Obviously it is University policy not
to discriminate against any student in the admin
istration of its educational policies on any arbi
trary or unjust basis. Why then enumerate "sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, and national and ethnic origin" as specially
prohibited bases for discrimination? The reason
is that, in this society at this time, these charac
teristics tend to make individuals the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination.
These characteristics thus tend to serve as the
basis for cumulative discrimination: repetitive
stigma, insult, and indignity on the basis of a fun
damental personal trait. In addition, for most of
the groups suffering such discrimination, a long
history closely associates extreme verbal abuse
with intimidation by physical violence, so that
vilification is experienced as assaultive in the
strict sense. It is the cumulative and socially per
vasive discrimination, often linked to violence,
that distinguishes the intolerable injury of
wounded identity caused by discriminatory har
assment from the tolerable, and relatively ran
domly distributed, hurt of bruised feelings that
results from single incidents of ordinary person
ally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard
protects against.
2. Does not "harassment" by definition re
quire repeated acts by the individual charged?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive pro
posal can constitute prohibited sexual harass
ment, so can a single instance of vilification
constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment.
The reason for this is, again, the socially pervas
ive character of the prohibited forms of discrim
ination. Students with the characteristics in
question have the right to pursue their Stanford
education in an environment that is not more
hostile to them than to others. But the injury of
discriminatory denial of educational access
through maintenance of a hostile environment
can arise from single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal
with a form of abuse that is repetitive to its vic
tims, and hence constitutes the continuing injury
of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit
the individual actions that, when added up,
amount to institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize re
quired?
Student members of groups subject to per
vasive discrimination may be injured by uninten
ded insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well as
by those made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes enforcement
of the prohibition of discriminatory harassment
more difficult, particularly since proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is required to establish
charges of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary
process should only be invoked against inten
tionally insulting or stigmatizing utterances. The
kind of expression defined in Section 4(c) does
not constitute "insulting or 'fighting' words" un
less used with intent to insult. For example, a
student who heard members of minority groups
using the standard insulting terms for their own
group in a joking way among themselves might
— trying to be funny — insensitively use those
terms in the same way. Such a person should
be told that this is not funny, but should not be
subject to disciplinary proceedings. It should
also not be a disciplinary offense for a speaker
to quote or mention in discussion the gutter ep
ithets of discrimination; it is using these epithets
so as to endorse their insulting connotations that
causes serious injury.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number

of individuals" prohibited, and how many are too
many?
The principle of free expression creates a
strong presumption against prohibition of
speech based upon its content. Narrow excep
tions to this presumption are traditionally recog
nized, among other categories, for speech that
is defamatory, assaultive, and (a closely related
category) for speech that constitutes "insulting
or 'fighting' words:" The interpretation adopts
the concept of "personal vilification" to help spell
out what constitutes the prohibited use of fight
ing words in the discrimination context. Personal
vilification is a narrow category of intentionally in
sulting or stigmatizing discriminatory statements
about individuals (4a), directed to those individ
uals (4b), and expressed in viscerally offensive
form (4c).
The requirement of individual address in Sec
tion 4(b) excludes "group defamation" — offen
sive statements concerning social groups
directed to the campus or the public at large.
The purpose of this limitation is to give extra
breathing space for vigorous public debate on
campus, protecting even extreme and hurtful ut
terance in the public contect against potentially
chilling effect of the threat of disciplinary
proceedings.
The expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) is meant to make clear that prohibited
personal vilification does not include "group
defamation" as that term has been understood
in constitutional law and in campus debate. The
clearest case for application of the prohibition of
personal vilification is the face to face vilification
of one individual by another. But more than one
person can be insulted face to face, and vilifica
tion by telephone is not (for our purposes) es
sentially different from vilification that is literally
face to face.
For reasons such as these, the exact contours
of the concept of insult to "a small number of
individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One limiting restriction is that the re
quirements of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that
a "small number" of persons must be no more
than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
5. What is the legal basis for the concept of
"insulting or fighting' words," and what is the
concept's relation to the actual threat of violence
on the one hand, and to the actual infliction of
emotional distress on the other?
In its unanimous decision in Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court
spoke of "certain well-defined and narrowly lim
ited classes of speech" which are outside the
protection of the First Amendment because their
utterance is "no essential part of any exposition
of ideas" and of such "slight social value as a
step to truth" that they can be prohibited on the
basis of "the. social interest in order and
morality." Along with libel and obscenity, this
category was said to include "insulting or 'fight
ing' words — those which by their very ut
terance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace."
In subsequent opinions, the Court has consis
tently reaffirmed the basic Chaplinsky doctrine.
At the same time, the Court has clarified the con
cept of "insulting or 'fighting' words" in two im
portant ways. First, where the state attempts to
punish speech for provoking violence, the threat
of violence must be serious and imminent
{ Gooding v. Wilson, 1972). Second, the "insult
ing or 'fighting' words" exception does not allow
prohibition of utterances offensive to the public
at large, but must be confined to insults or af
fronts addressed directly to individuals, or thrust
upon a captive audience (Cohen v. California,
1971).
The Supreme Court's phrase "insulting or
'fighting' words" is often shortened to simply
"fighting words," an expression which, while
roughly capturing the sort of personally abusive
language we mean to prohibit, may also have
certain misleading connotations. First, the ex
pression may imply that violence is considered
an acceptable response to discriminatory
vilification; but we prohibit these utterances so
that disciplinary proceedings may substitute for,
not supplement, violent response. Second, ex
clusive focus on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of controversial
speech can transform it into forbidden "fighting
words" by plausibly threatening violent re
sponse to it — the so-called "heckler's veto."
The speech, if it is to be subject to restraint, must
also be grossly insulting by the more objective
standard of commonly shared social standards.
Finally, the "fighting words" terminology might
be thought to imply that extreme forms of per
sona! abuse become protected speech simply
because the victims are, for example, such dis
ciplined practitioners of non-violence, or so
physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not, in context, pose
an actual and imminent threat of violent retalia
tion. Such a limitation might be appropriate un
der a breach of the peace statute, whose sole
purpose is to prevent violence, but does not
make sense in an anti-discrimination provision
such as this one.
Another and largely overlapping category of
verbal abuse to which legal sanctions may be
applied is defined by the tort law concept of "in
tentional infliction of emotional distress." Much
of the conduct that we define as discriminatory
harassment might well give rise to a civil suit for
damages under the "emotional distress" rubric.
But that rubric has drawbacks as the legal basis
for a discriminatory harassment regulation. It is
less well established in free speech law than is

the fighting words concept. Further, taken as it
is from tort law, it focuses primarily on the vic
tim's reaction to abuse; the question is whether
he or she suffers "severe emotional distress."
We think it better in defining a disciplinary of
fense to focus on the prohibited conduct; we
prefer not require the victims of personal vilifica
tion to display their psychic scars in order to es
tablish than an offense has been committed.
6. What is included and excluded by the
provision requiring "symbols ... commonly un
derstood to convey direct and visceral hatred or
contempt?"
These terms in Section 4(c) provide the most
significant narrowing element in the definition of
the offense of discriminatory personal vilification.
They limit the offense to cases involving use of
the gutter epithets and symbols of bigotry: those
words, pictures, etc., that are commonly under
stood as assaultive insults whenever they are
seriously directed against members of groups
subject to pervasive discimination. The require
ment that symbols must be "commonly
understood" to insult or stigmatize, and so injure
"by their very utterance," narrows the discretion
of enforcement authorities; it means that partic
ular words or symbols thought to be insulting or
offensive by a social group or by some of its
members must also be so understood across
society as a whole before they meet the pro
posed definition.
The kinds of expression covered are
words or combinations of words (listed, not
exhaustively, and with apologies for the af
front involved even in listing them) such as
"nigger," "kike," "faggot," and "cunt;" sym
bols such as KKK regalia directed at
African-American students, or Nazi
swastikas directed at Jewish students. By
contrast, a symbol like the Confederate
flag, though experienced by many African-
Americans as a racist endorsement of
slavery and segregation, is still widely
enough accepted as an appropriate sym
bol of regional identity and pride that it
would not in our view fall within the "com
monly understood" restriction. The direc
tion of profanities or obscenities as such at
members of groups subject to discrimina
tion is also not covered by the interpreta
tion, nor is expression of dislike, hatred, or
contempt for these groups, in the absence
of the gutter epithets or their pictorial equiv
alents.
Making the prohibition so narrow leaves some
very hurtful forms of discriminatory verbal abuse
unprohibited. Substantively, this restriction is
meant to ensure that no idea as such is
proscribed. There is no view, however racist,
sexist, homophobic, or blasphemous it may be
in content, which cannot be expressed, so long
as those who hold such views do not use the
gutter epithets or their equivalent. Procedurally,
the point of the restriction is to give clear notice
of what the offense is, and to avoid politically
charged contests over the meaning of
debatable words and symbols in the context of
disciplinary proceedings.
7. Does not the narrow definition of vilification
imply approval of all"protected expression" that
falls outside the definition?
Free expression could not survive if institu
tions were held implicitly to endorse every kind
of speech that they did not prohibit. The Stan
ford community can and should vigorously
denounce many forms of expression that are
protected against disciplinary sanction. For ex
ample, while interference with free expression
by force or intimidation violates the Fundamental
Standard, less overt forms of silencing of diverse
expression, such as too hasty charges of rac
ism, sexism, and the like, do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful to individuals and bad
for education; as such, it is to be discouraged,
though by means other than the disciplinary
process.
Similarly, while personal vilification vi
olates the Fundamental Standard, even ex
treme expression of hatred and contempt
for protected groups does not, so long as
it does not contain prohibited insulting or
fighting words, and is not addressed to in
dividual members of the groups insulted.
Yet such extreme expressions of hatred
and contempt cause real harm. Members
of the university community have every
right to denounce them. At the same time,
however, respect for the right of free ex
pression — so critical to a university com
munity — requires that students tolerate
opinions which they find abhorrent. As
stated in Section I, intimidation aimed at
suppressing the exercise of this right
through violence, or the threat of violence,
constitutes a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In general, the disciplinary requirements that
form the content of the Fundamental Standard
are not meant to be a comprehensive account
of good citizenship within the Stanford commu
nity. They are meant only to set a floor of mini
mum requirements of respect for the rights of
others, requirements that can be reasonably
and fairly enforced through a disciplinary proc
ess. The Stanford community should expect
much more of itself by way of tolerance, diversi
ty, free inquiry and the pursuit of equal educa
tional opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.
