## Cardinal senior shot putter closes career at NCAAs 
### Noah Blake 
At 6-foot-3, 245 pounds, senior
Brian Boggess has an ideal body
to throw a 16 pound metal ball
as far as or farther than 60 feet.
But national-caliber competitor
aside, Brian Boggess is also a fun
ny, intelligent, and articulate per
son well prepared to face life after
he leaves the circle for the last
time.
However, Boggess will have one
last meet and shot at glory as he
and four Stanford teammates will
compete in the NCAA Champion
ships which start today [see
related story].
Although he excelled in shot
and disc at El Capitan High School
in Lakeside, Calif., these weren't
the first track events in which
Boggess competed. "A coach in
high school got me out. He wanted
to see what I could do.
"He had me doing hurdles and
jumps and all kinds of things.
That's when I was a little bit
lighter, a little more athletic, and
could do more things. But I ran
one hurdles race, when I was a
freshman in high school. It was
my first and my last, and then I
pretty much stuck with the dis
cus, and became a thrower after
that."
The transition from high school
to college competition is at least
as difficult in the shot and disc
as in many other sports. For in
coming basketball players, the rim
is still ten feet high, and for base
ball players the bats are still the
same weight and length, but both
the shot and disc get larger and
heavier.
"Immediately, there's a transi
tion to a bigger implement. . ..
That was the first thing I had to
adjust to. . . . So what you did
with a high school discus and a

high school shot doesn't immedi
ately carry over, because it messes
up your timing. But if you're pa
tient and all, that comes into
place."
It all did come into place for
Boggess, especially in the shot
put, after he changed his tech
nique. "Throughout high school I
was a glider . . . you come straight
through — you don't spin around
at all. All the way through my
sophomore year here I did the
glide.. .. Last year I started the
spin and experimented with that
here and there, and finally I got
comfortable enough in it that I
stuck with it.
"I wouldn't go back, but there
was a point where I was debating
and switching back and forth as
to which technique I was going
to use."
With the spin, Boggess threw
60-1 at the NCAA's last year,
which placed him seventh and
earned him All-America honors.
However, injuries have slowed the
Cardinal competitor down this
season.
"I've been dealing with a lot of
injuries this year, relatively minor
things, but they stay around long
enough to nag at me and manage
to affect my throwing."
As a result, Boggess' best throw
this year was 59-9 at the Stanford
Collegiate Open in April. Late in
the season, it seemed that the
senior would be denied a berth in
the NCAAs as the standard for
an automatic berth was raised to
60-10V2. However, Boggess quali
fied under the provisional stand
ard because not enough
competitors reached the higher
mark.
No matter how he does at
NCAAs, after this season Boggess
is planning on taking a break from
shot and disc. "I think I'm going

to give my body a rest. I think it
needs it. It might even be foolish
to continue right away. ... If I'm
feeling good and I have nothing
else to do, then I probably will
get back into it. I don't know
where that would take me. I don't
think it'll be any time really soon,
but I know somewhere down the
road, I'm going to pick up the
shot again and get back into it."
However, Boggess will have
things to keep him busy after
NCAAs. He is majoring in Human
Biology, and has clearly thought
out his career plans. "I want to
get into physical therapy. My ex
posure to sports and my personal
experience with injury have given
me an interest in what the body
does in response to athletic activ
ity and how the body recovers
during injury and how to optimize
that recovery time.
"It would've been a great ad
vantage to me if I would've had
all that knowledge . . .but things
seemed to be more chronic with
me. When I got a muscle strain,
it wouldn't necessarily go away.
But there's always the paradox of
having to practice, having to keep
in shape, having to throw far
when you're injured and not being
able to rest that much."
Clearly Boggess is ready to meet
the next phase of his life head
on, with the same determination
he always showed inside the shot
and disc circle.


Al Green — Daily file
Brian Boggess will put the shot for one final meet as a collegian this week at the NCAA track meet,
which begins today. Boggess was seventh at last year's meet, but has been plagued by injuries in
the 1990 campaign.
