# Sports remains unique pastime for young and old alike
## 
### 
Last weekend, a record crowd came
out to Sunken Diamond for the
finale of the West I Regional. The
boosters were there. The students were
there. The locals were there.
And so were the children.
One of the great American rites of
passage takes place every time Mom and
Dad bring the kids to their first ballgame.
Experiencing the sights, sounds and
smells of baseball is as much a part of
growing up as learning to ride a bike or
tie a shoelace.
That isn't to say the youngsters are
always enthralled with their indoctrina
tion. Getting a 5-year-old to sit still for
nearly three hours is no easy task.
A boy sitting in front of me Monday
afternoon began to get restless soon after
the first pitch was thrown. He asked his
father, "How many more innings are
there?"
It was the bottom of the second.
When the child heard the bad news he
just rolled his eyes and started picking
around in the bag of food the family had
brought along. He found one of those
drinks that come in metal foil pouches,
punctured it with the straw and began
to play with it.
For a few moments, squeezing the juice
container and watching the liquid dribble

out was more interesting than the base
ball game. Eventually, though, his eyes
wandered back to the contest between
the Cardinal and the San Diego State
Aztecs.
Baseball has a certain lazy quality
about it. Because the game moves
along at more of an amble than a
canter, it allows your attention to wander
for a while without causing you to miss
too much.
When you're sitting home watching on
television, it's very easy to suddenly start
cleaning up the family room, making
lunch or dialing an old friend's phone
number.
Being at the park is no different. One
minute you're watching a showdown be
tween Dennis Eckersley and Ken Griffey
Jr. Then someone sitting three seats to
your left says he thinks Don Mattingly
is a better hitter than Wade Boggs be
cause he drives in more runs.
"You've got to be kidding," you re
spond, paying little attention to the fact
that Griffey has just singled to left center.
"Boggs has a .352 lifetime batting
average."
The argument gets mighty heated until
a third party chimes in with a vote for
Kirby Puckett. "Kirby Puckett?!?" you

and the Mattingly-ite shout. Foes quickly
becomes allies agfinst this argument in
terloper and the newly-formed coalition
decides it's time to get up and go for a
hot dog.
The kids back at Sunken Diamond
don't completely understand what
is happening in the game. One girl
asked her father: "Is this high school or
college?" Still, something deep in their
subconscious tells them it isn't necessary
to watch every pitch, to follow every foul
ball over the trees, to keep a constant
focus on the action.
As the children sit there, eyes wander
ing every which way, they are learning
a life lesson which is every bit as impor
tant as sitting in a kindergarten class
room and building a fortress out of
wooden blocks.

These youths are being trained as the
next generation of sports fans. "Baseball
101: How to appreciate our national pas
time" is just one of the courses.
Recently, I was out to dinner with a
party of about a dozen, including two
grade schoolers. While neither of them
could come formulate a single relevant
argument on world politics, both were
well versed in sports.
The topic of conversation was the NBA.
Specifically, the discussion centered on
centers: "Who is the best big man in the
league — David Robinson, Patrick Ewing
or Akeem Ol^juwon?"
Much to my surprise, the boys had
opinions groundly at least partially in
relevant facts. They were equally adept
at discussing who had the best post game
and the most shooting range as they were
at coming up with zingers like "I just
hate Patrick!"
Sports is, if nothing else, an escape.
Worrying about whether the
Dodgers have made up any ground
on the Reds is a way of avoiding life's
real concerns for a moment.
In this country, more people have cho
sen to escape into baseball than any other
sport. When spring training begins each
year, it is a renewal for millions. As the

season progresses, countless multitudes
make following the game their all
consuming passion.
Cable television has brought more
games rnto the home than anyone ever
could have imagined a few decades ago.
Rotisserie leagues have allowed everyone
to manage their own ballclub — to be a
big-time wheeler dealer.
The game is so firmly entrenched in
the American psyche, one still wonders
why Michael Dukakis couldn't answer
"Orel Hershiser" at a presidential debate
held two years ago when asked who the
heroes are in the United States today.
The debate was in Los Angeles, home
to Hershiser's Dodgers, and the pitcher
was in the midst of a record-breaking
streak.
All of this is beyond the comprehension
of the wide-eyed children on the grassy
hill in one of the most beautiful baseball
facilities on the planet.
Someday, though, it will all be perfectly
clear. They'll look back on the day they
spent watching Stanford earn a berth in
the College World Series and remember
it as the first date in a wonderful
romance.

Last weekend, a record crowd came
out to Sunken Diamond for the
finale of the West I Regional. The
boosters were there. The students were
there. The locals were there.
And so were the children.
One of the great American rites of
passage takes place every time Mom and
Dad bring the kids to their first ballgame.
Experiencing the sights, sounds and
smells of baseball is as much a part of
growing up as learning to ride a bike or
tie a shoelace.
That isn't to say the youngsters are
always enthralled with their indoctrina
tion. Getting a 5-year-old to sit still for
nearly three hours is no easy task.
A boy sitting in front of me Monday
afternoon began to get restless soon after
the first pitch was thrown. He asked his
father, "How many more innings are
there?"
It was the bottom of the second.
When the child heard the bad news he
just rolled his eyes and started picking
around in the bag of food the family had
brought along. He found one of those
drinks that come in metal foil pouches,
punctured it with the straw and began
to play with it.
For a few moments, squeezing the juice
container and watching the liquid dribble

out was more interesting than the base
ball game. Eventually, though, his eyes
wandered back to the contest between
the Cardinal and the San Diego State
Aztecs.
Baseball has a certain lazy quality
about it. Because the game moves
along at more of an amble than a
canter, it allows your attention to wander
for a while without causing you to miss
too much.
When you're sitting home watching on
television, it's very easy to suddenly start
cleaning up the family room, making
lunch or dialing an old friend's phone
number.
Being at the park is no different. One
minute you're watching a showdown be
tween Dennis Eckersley and Ken Griffey
Jr. Then someone sitting three seats to
your left says he thinks Don Mattingly
is a better hitter than Wade Boggs be
cause he drives in more runs.
"You've got to be kidding," you re
spond, paying little attention to the fact
that Griffey has just singled to left center.
"Boggs has a .352 lifetime batting
average."
The argument gets mighty heated until
a third party chimes in with a vote for
Kirby Puckett. "Kirby Puckett?!?" you

and the Mattingly-ite shout. Foes quickly
becomes allies agfinst this argument in
terloper and the newly-formed coalition
decides it's time to get up and go for a
hot dog.
The kids back at Sunken Diamond
don't completely understand what
is happening in the game. One girl
asked her father: "Is this high school or
college?" Still, something deep in their
subconscious tells them it isn't necessary
to watch every pitch, to follow every foul
ball over the trees, to keep a constant
focus on the action.
As the children sit there, eyes wander
ing every which way, they are learning
a life lesson which is every bit as impor
tant as sitting in a kindergarten class
room and building a fortress out of
wooden blocks.

These youths are being trained as the
next generation of sports fans. "Baseball
101: How to appreciate our national pas
time" is just one of the courses.
Recently, I was out to dinner with a
party of about a dozen, including two
grade schoolers. While neither of them
could come formulate a single relevant
argument on world politics, both were
well versed in sports.
The topic of conversation was the NBA.
Specifically, the discussion centered on
centers: "Who is the best big man in the
league — David Robinson, Patrick Ewing
or Akeem Ol^juwon?"
Much to my surprise, the boys had
opinions groundly at least partially in
relevant facts. They were equally adept
at discussing who had the best post game
and the most shooting range as they were
at coming up with zingers like "I just
hate Patrick!"
Sports is, if nothing else, an escape.
Worrying about whether the
Dodgers have made up any ground
on the Reds is a way of avoiding life's
real concerns for a moment.
In this country, more people have cho
sen to escape into baseball than any other
sport. When spring training begins each
year, it is a renewal for millions. As the

season progresses, countless multitudes
make following the game their all
consuming passion.
Cable television has brought more
games rnto the home than anyone ever
could have imagined a few decades ago.
Rotisserie leagues have allowed everyone
to manage their own ballclub — to be a
big-time wheeler dealer.
The game is so firmly entrenched in
the American psyche, one still wonders
why Michael Dukakis couldn't answer
"Orel Hershiser" at a presidential debate
held two years ago when asked who the
heroes are in the United States today.
The debate was in Los Angeles, home
to Hershiser's Dodgers, and the pitcher
was in the midst of a record-breaking
streak.
All of this is beyond the comprehension
of the wide-eyed children on the grassy
hill in one of the most beautiful baseball
facilities on the planet.

clear. They'll look back on the day they

the College World Series and remember
it as the first date in a wonderful
romance.
