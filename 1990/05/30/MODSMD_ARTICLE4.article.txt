# Obsessed With Food
## Eating disorders and self-esteem at Stanford 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first
in a series of three articles ex
amining eating disorders of Stan
ford students.

During Carol Freden's fresh
man year, three of her closest
friends were a bulimic, an
anorexic and someone completely
preoccupied with food. During her
sophomore year, Fred en became
bulimic, eventually throwing up
her food once or twice a day.
Junior Ellen Schur never had
trouble with food before she came
to Stanford. But after she saw
other female students running of
ten and eating little, she became
preoccupied with food.
Fred en and Schur represent a
larger problem at Stanford and
other campuses nationwide. Na
tional estimates of students with
eating disorders, the vast majority
of whom are women, range from

jS^EATING

5 to 20 percent.
Many Stanford students binge
and then purge their food; others
eat barely enough to survive; and
still others eat far more than is
healthy. The most common disor
der, however, is an obsession with
dieting.
"Certainly we know this popu
lation, the college age, is probably
at the highest risk," says Dr. Celia
Moreno, clinical coordinator of
Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center. Stresses from academics,
intimacy and leaving home be
come important issues of self
esteem that help lead to eating
disorders. *»
Many people who have come

through the Body-Image, Food
and Self-Esteem student support
group say that being at Stanford
has either started an eating dis
order or made one much worse.
The target group for eating dis
orders is upper-middle-class
women from stable families with
perfectionist tendencies and high
goals set by family and self. Many
Stanford women fit this descrip
tion.
Schur, who is the coordinator
of the support group, says she
has never talked with a resident
assistant who has not reported
eating disorders among residents.
Moreno says Counseling and
Psychological Services receives
several calls a quarter with ques
tions related to eating disorders.
Sophomore Maha Ibrahim, a
member of Body-Image, Food and
Self-Esteem, says she gets about
three or four calls a week from
students who are concerned about
either their or their friends' eating
habits.
But many people like Daphne
Edwards, a sophomore, do not get
help until they have severely
abused their bodies.
If Edwards did not run six miles
on a given day, she did not eat
more than an apple that day. After
going up a flight of stairs, she
would feel dizzy and be hard of
breath. She could not concentrate
in class.
Edwards was 5 feet 10 inches
and weighed 105 pounds. People
told her that it was horrible to
see her, but she saw fat in her
thighs and wasn't happy with her
body at all.
Feeling insecure and depressed,
she cut out her social life. She
kept seeing herself in a negative
light, that everything she did was
bad.
Edwards was anorexic.
Anorexia nervosa is an extreme
form of self-starvation which can
lead to severe medical complica
tions such as low blood pressure;
bone loss; loss of menstruation;
change in the color and texture
of existing hair, nails and skin;
and heart failure.
No matter what their weight,
anorexics still think they are fat.
Some women who do not have
the control to starve themselves
— who consider themselves failed
anorexics — often face an equally
severe problem: bulimia.
As a senior RA this year, Carol
Freden was glad to have her own
sink. For the past two years she
had to use the community bath

room to throw up and worry
whether someone would hear.
"Linda," a senior, oflen spent
$15 at the store on cookies, chips
and other junk food. She ate while
she read, and when she finished
the food, she couldn't concentrate
anymore. She was thinking about
what she would eat next.
That night, Linda would hate
herself, but the feeling would not
last long. She felt good the next
day because she would not eat
much at meals. Then she would
stay up to study and binge again.
Feeling guilty, Linda purged by
exercising four hours every day.
She would run several miles, walk
several, ride the exercise bike and
lift weights. "Basically, I got to
the point where I was either ex
ercising, sleeping or going to the
store to buy something to eat,"
she says.
Bulimia is characterized by hin
ging, which is eating a lot of food
in a short amount of time, and
purging. Purging can be vomiting,
using laxatives, or dieting and ex
ercising to an extreme.
Edwards, Freden and Linda
have extreme cases of eating dis
orders, but more subtle disorders
are prevalent at Stanford. Pat
Fabiano, director of the Health
Promotion Program at Cowell,
says many women think they are
OK just because they are not vom
iting, binging or starving them
selves.
However, Fabiano says, "Many
women are chronically dieting.
They are eating 500 to 700
calories a day (a fraction of the
recommended intake). All they
can think about is food and how
they can limit it. I think that is
a disorder. It may not fit the strict
definition of an eating disorder,

but there are so many women in
this warfare with their body and
what they put in it."
Cowell nutritionist Alice Bender
says, "Most who I see are people
who are obsessed with food, have
dieted a lot in the past and have
gone up and down — the yo-yo
syndrome. Many are just not
feeling comfortable with their
body, not feeling comfortable with
food, having a relationship of
looking at food as being bad or
good.
"They feel very restricted in
what they can eat and what they
should eat. They don't really eryoy
food. They have trouble eating in
front of people. They have a
skewed relationship with food."
Bender says even women who
think they eat too much often eat
only 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day.
During the first quarter of El
len Schur's freshman year, she
gained 15 pounds — the so-called
"freshman 15." She became de
pressed and began to withdraw
from social activities.
She started to cut out food
groups: sweets, white meat, red
meat, dairy products and cheese.
She learned how to count calories
and how to burn them. That sum
mer she focused on food and
dieting.
She constantly thought, "How
can I burn more calories?" If she
was sitting, she thought she
should be standing. If she was
standing, she thought she should
be moving around. Everything in
volved food — she was obsessed.

what she would eat next.
That night, Linda would hate
herself, but the feeling would not
last long. She felt good the next
day because she would not eat
much at meals. Then she would
stay up to study and binge again.
Feeling guilty, Linda purged by
exercising four hours every day.
She would run several miles, walk
several, ride the exercise bike and
lift weights. "Basically, I got to
the point where I was either ex
ercising, sleeping or going to the
store to buy something to eat,"
she says.
Bulimia is characterized by hin
ging, which is eating a lot of food
in a short amount of time, and
purging. Purging can be vomiting,
using laxatives, or dieting and ex
ercising to an extreme.
Edwards, Freden and Linda
have extreme cases of eating dis
orders, but more subtle disorders
are prevalent at Stanford. Pat
Fabiano, director of the Health
Promotion Program at Cowell,
says many women think they are
OK just because they are not vom
iting, binging or starving them
selves.
However, Fabiano says, "Many
women are chronically dieting.
They are eating 500 to 700
calories a day (a fraction of the
recommended intake). All they
can think about is food and how
they can limit it. I think that is
a disorder. It may not fit the strict
definition of an eating disorder,

but there are so many women in
this warfare with their body and
what they put in it."
Cowell nutritionist Alice Bender
says, "Most who I see are people
who are obsessed with food, have
dieted a lot in the past and have
gone up and down — the yo-yo
syndrome. Many are just not
feeling comfortable with their
body, not feeling comfortable with
food, having a relationship of
looking at food as being bad or
good.
"They feel very restricted in
what they can eat and what they
should eat. They don't really eryoy
food. They have trouble eating in
front of people. They have a
skewed relationship with food."
Bender says even women who
think they eat too much often eat
only 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day.
During the first quarter of El
len Schur's freshman year, she
gained 15 pounds — the so-called
"freshman 15." She became de
pressed and began to withdraw
from social activities.
She started to cut out food
groups: sweets, white meat, red
meat, dairy products and cheese.
She learned how to count calories
and how to burn them. That sum
mer she focused on food and
dieting.
She constantly thought, "How
can I burn more calories?" If she
was sitting, she thought she
should be standing. If she was
standing, she thought she should
be moving around. Everything in
volved food — she was obsessed.

Tomorrow: The causes of eating
disorders and how five Stanford
students became preoccupied with
food.
Editor's note: This is the first
in a series of three articles ex
amining eating disorders of Stan
ford students.

During Carol Freden's fresh
man year, three of her closest
friends were a bulimic, an
anorexic and someone completely
preoccupied with food. During her
sophomore year, Fred en became
bulimic, eventually throwing up
her food once or twice a day.
Junior Ellen Schur never had
trouble with food before she came
to Stanford. But after she saw
other female students running of
ten and eating little, she became
preoccupied with food.
Fred en and Schur represent a
larger problem at Stanford and
other campuses nationwide. Na
tional estimates of students with
eating disorders, the vast majority
of whom are women, range from

jS^EATING

5 to 20 percent.
Many Stanford students binge
and then purge their food; others
eat barely enough to survive; and
still others eat far more than is
healthy. The most common disor
der, however, is an obsession with
dieting.
"Certainly we know this popu
lation, the college age, is probably
at the highest risk," says Dr. Celia
Moreno, clinical coordinator of
Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center. Stresses from academics,
intimacy and leaving home be
come important issues of self
esteem that help lead to eating
disorders. *»
Many people who have come

through the Body-Image, Food
and Self-Esteem student support
group say that being at Stanford
has either started an eating dis
order or made one much worse.
The target group for eating dis
orders is upper-middle-class
women from stable families with
perfectionist tendencies and high
goals set by family and self. Many
Stanford women fit this descrip
tion.
Schur, who is the coordinator
of the support group, says she
has never talked with a resident
assistant who has not reported
eating disorders among residents.
Moreno says Counseling and
Psychological Services receives
several calls a quarter with ques
tions related to eating disorders.
Sophomore Maha Ibrahim, a
member of Body-Image, Food and
Self-Esteem, says she gets about
three or four calls a week from
students who are concerned about
either their or their friends' eating
habits.
But many people like Daphne
Edwards, a sophomore, do not get
help until they have severely
abused their bodies.
If Edwards did not run six miles
on a given day, she did not eat
more than an apple that day. After
going up a flight of stairs, she
would feel dizzy and be hard of
breath. She could not concentrate
in class.
Edwards was 5 feet 10 inches
and weighed 105 pounds. People
told her that it was horrible to
see her, but she saw fat in her
thighs and wasn't happy with her
body at all.
Feeling insecure and depressed,
she cut out her social life. She
kept seeing herself in a negative
light, that everything she did was
bad.
Edwards was anorexic.
Anorexia nervosa is an extreme
form of self-starvation which can
lead to severe medical complica
tions such as low blood pressure;
bone loss; loss of menstruation;
change in the color and texture
of existing hair, nails and skin;
and heart failure.
No matter what their weight,
anorexics still think they are fat.
Some women who do not have
the control to starve themselves
— who consider themselves failed
anorexics — often face an equally
severe problem: bulimia.
As a senior RA this year, Carol
Freden was glad to have her own
sink. For the past two years she
had to use the community bath

room to throw up and worry
whether someone would hear.
"Linda," a senior, oflen spent
$15 at the store on cookies, chips
and other junk food. She ate while
she read, and when she finished
the food, she couldn't concentrate
anymore. She was thinking about
what she would eat next.
That night, Linda would hate
herself, but the feeling would not
last long. She felt good the next
day because she would not eat
much at meals. Then she would
