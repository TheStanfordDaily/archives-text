# Obsessed With Food
## Eating disorders and self-esteem at Stanford

Editor's note: This is the first
in a series of three articles ex
amining eating disorders of Stan
ford students.

During Carol Freden's fresh
man year, three of her closest
friends were a bulimic, an
anorexic and someone completely
preoccupied with food. During her
sophomore year, Fred en became
bulimic, eventually throwing up
her food once or twice a day.
Junior Ellen Schur never had

order or made one much worse.
The target group for eating dis
orders is upper-middle-class
women from stable families with
perfectionist tendencies and high
goals set by family and self. Many
Stanford women fit this descrip

Schur, who is the coordinator
of the support group, says she
has never talked with a resident
assistant who has not reported
eating disorders among residents.
Moreno says Counseling and
Psychological Services receives
several calls a quarter with ques

Sophomore Maha Ibrahim, a
member of Body-Image, Food and
Self-Esteem, says she gets about
three or four calls a week from
students who are concerned about
