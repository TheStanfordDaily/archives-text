# Athletes of the week
## 
### 
Some athletes have an innate ability to
play their very best in the playoffs. Some
thing about the added significance of the
competition brings out these individuals' in
tense desire to win. Basketball superstar
Michael Jordan comes to mind.
You can add to the list headed by Jordan
the names of two Stanford athletes who
distinguished themselves last week in the
postseason. We here at The Daily would like
to recognize Adcle Moore and Mike Mussina
as the Athletes of the Week.
Moore, a sophomore from Dallas, Tex.,
has as much talent as any golfer on the
college circuit today. However, an injury her
senior year of high school had many in the

sport questioning whether she could play
again at the level that had made her the
No. 1 recruit in the country.
Despite flashes of brilliance, including a
tie for first in a tournament her freshman
year, Moore had not managed to show what
she could do against the country's best. That
is, until last weekend.
At the NCAA tournament in Hilton Head,
S.C., Moore exploded out of the gate. In
what is widely regarded as the top amateur
tournament in the country (many foreign
stars play for U.S. schools), Moore led the
field after two days of play. After falling to
fifth in the third round, Moore unfortu
nately stumbled in the final 18 to finish
22nd.
She still led the Cardinal team, and won
the respect of the world's best amateurs.
Moore also silenced the doubters, and served
notice that she will be a force to be reckoned
with in her final two years here.

Mike Mussina wanted the ball. Thanks
to a little help from Mother Nature, he got
it and pitched the Cardinal into the College
World Series.
Mussina, a junior from Montoursville,
Penn., got the call on Friday in the West I
regional tournament Stanford hosted over
the weekend. He responded by shutting
down Middle Tennessee State on only four
hits and one run.
But the Cardinal still had to win two
more games. Stan Spencer took care of one
win on Saturday, but who would start in
the championship? Mussina volunteered to
go — on one day's rest.
When the rains delayed it a day, this heroic
effort was not necessary. Still, two days rest
is half what the pros get between starts,
and another strong performance seemed to
be doubtful.

And Mussina wasn't as good as Friday —
he was better. He went the whole way, giving
up only three hits and two runs. His fastball
was the best it has been all year, according
to Coach Mark Marquess. The result: a trip
to Omaha for the Series.
Mussina i9 now 14-3 on the year. He,
Spencer, and the rest of the 56-10 Stanford
team will now travel to Omaha, Neb. for
the College World Series. But, no matter
how the team does, no one who was there
will ever forget Mussina's efforts at Sunken
Diamond last weekend.
