# Track sends six, no, five off to nationals

And then there were six.
Make that five.
As of a week ago, only three
Cardinal track and field athletes
had qualified for the NCAA
Championships, which begin
today. But since then, three more
have added their names to the
list. One of the original three has
now pulled out to compete over
seas instead, leaving the Cardinal
contingent at five.
That foreign invader is sopho
more Chryste Gaines, the 1990
100-meter Pacific 10 Conference
Champion. She currently holds
the No. 2 time in the nation at
11.31 seconds, and was considered
to be Stanford's best bet for an
individual NCAA title. However,
she has decided to rest this week
and run in the Six Nation Invi
tational instead.
The international meet will be
held on June 5-6 in Milan, Italy,
and features athletes from Bul
garia, Cuba, China and the Soviet
Union in addition to the United
States and host Italy Gaines will
not be the lone Cardinal repre
sentative, as Stanford Asst. Coach
Scott Chisam will assume the
duties of coach for the U.S. wom
en's team.
The latest additions to the
group going to nationals include
Kric Mastalir, Dave Strang, and
Brian Boggess. Mastalir achieved
his qualifying mark at the Long
Beach Last Chance Meet on Mav

24, while both Strang and Boggess
are in on provisional standards
set earlier in the season [see Card
note].
Mastalir surpassed the
provisional-qualifying standard in
the 1500-meter run with a time
of 3:42.22. Strang qualified in the
800-meters with his time of
1:47.83 at the Stanford Open. He
is the Pac-10 Champion in that
event. (For details on Boggess, see
related story.]
The other competitors for Stan
ford will be Peggy Odita in the
heptathlon and Bill Crowley in
the 1500-meter run. Both are Pac
-10 Champions in their respective
events. Odita finished 14th in the
heptathlon at last year's NCAAs,
and she is looking to greatly im
prove on that place. Crowley and
Mastalir may have the honor of
being the only teammates run
ning the 1500-meters, with the
possible exception of some
Arkansas Razorbacks.
Card notes
To clarify, here is how the NCAA's
qualification policy works: at the be
ginning of the season, the NCAA sets
two qualification standards in each
event. One is the automatic mark.
Surpass this and the athlete is guar
anteed a spot in the stadium at
NCAAs. The other is the provisional
mark, which is analogous to the wait
list policy for Undergraduate Admis
sions. If not enough athlete* make
the automatic mark, the NCAA will
invite those with provisional marks
to the prestigious meet
