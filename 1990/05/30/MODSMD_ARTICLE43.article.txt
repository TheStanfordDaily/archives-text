# Group still fighting for Dead
## Hopes to bring band back in '91 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
It's not easy to raise the Dead.
That's the lesson students in a
new organization known as "We
Need A Miracle" are learning over
and over.
The organization, founded by
four students after the April 24
White Plaza rally in support of
campus Grateful Dead concerts,
has been working hard to bring
together the various groups con
cerned with the benefits and
drawbacks of Dead concerts.
The four students are Kelly
Robertson, a graduate student;
and Steve Gunn, Colin Hubbard
and James Reichmuth, all sopho
mores. They form what Robertson
called "a facilitating group" to ne
gotiate a proposal to bring back
the traditional Dead concerts for
the 1990-91 school year.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said last month that the
Grateful Dead would not be al
lowed on campus in the future
because of drug problems that
have accompanied the band's con
certs.
"We Need A Miiacle" is working
to find a solution that will address
the needs of the University ad
ministration, the Concert Net
work, the Stanford Police, the
Grateful Dead, Stanford "Dead
heads" (not an organized group)
and Bill Graham Presents. Bill
Graham Presents is the producer
for Bay Area Grateful Dead
shows.
The student group was involved
in two recent meetings, each of
which made some progress toward
the ultimate goal of bringing back
the concerts.
On May 18 the group met with
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, bringing him a 14-point
proposal for improving the con
certs. Lyons said, "The student
committee made a proposal to
me. ... I simply said that they
could organize a concert, and that
they should do it through the Con
cert Network."
Lyons' previous opposition was
not to the concerts themselves,
but to drug and security concerns
which were apparently addressed
in the proposal. The students
declined to release the proposal
to The Daily, emphasizing that it
was tentative and preliminary.
Lyons said some of the ideas
included "organizing the concert
as drug-free" and "limiting the
number of Deadheads."

But Robertson disagreed with
both of those points, saying it
would be "impossible" to com
pletely eradicate drugs at the con
certs and that organizers wished
to limit the number of non-
Stanford students and non
ticketholders, but not necessarily
the number of Deadheads.
The other meeting took place
last Thursday between members
of "We Need A Miracle" and rep
resentatives of the Concert Net
work. Reichmuth called that
meeting "productive" but
"preliminary."
One of the biggest obstacles dis
cussed at the second meeting was
security, and Mary Escobedo, in
coming director of the Concert
Network, said the group is
exploring different security op
tions..
She said putting together a
show, which is now her responsi
bility, is a tricky balancing act —
but she is optimistic. "I'd like to

see the Dead back, and obviously
most Stanford students would. It's
a big Stanford tradition, and also
we're a part of [Grateful DeadJ
tradition," she said.
Nanci Howe, a staff adviser to
the Concert Network, saw little
progress toward a return of the
concerts, but she had praise for
"We Need A Miracle." She said
the group had reopened the com-!
munication channels on an issu§
that had been dormant since last
fall.
Howe said, "There are signifi
cant security and crowd control
issues that have to be controlled.
But the group's work makes it
more likely that we will come up
with a plan that can work."
Will the concerts happen next
spring?
Howe said she was only
cautiously optimistic, adding,
"Never say 'never.' "
