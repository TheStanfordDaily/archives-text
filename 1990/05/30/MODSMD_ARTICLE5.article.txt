# League recruitment deterred many
## Secretive process alienated dozens who were approached 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
A secretive recruitment process used by the
League of Revolutionary Struggle has alienated doz
ens of students involved in progressive politics over
the past few years, according to students interviewed
by The Daily.
Over the past several years, League members
have recruited elected student representatives and
potential candidates in the ASSU through the Com
mittee on Democracy in Education; MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group; the Asian American
Student Association and the Black Student Union.
Recruitment for the League is very selective. Most
students within these groups have not been recruited
and had not even heard of the League before The
Daily's recent stories on the League's influence at
Stanford.
Unlike many national Marxist organizations, the
League focuses its attention on people of color or
ganizations because of its theory of liberating op
pressed races in America through the creation of a
socialist state.
Recruitment is conducted for the League by past
and present Stanford students who are League mem
bers, as well as by various University staff members,
according to students who were recruited.
The Daily's information on recruitment comes
from interviews with more than 20 Stanford stu

dents who say they were recruited by the League.
Recruitment for the League by individual League
members at Stanford and other universities has
continued steadily to the present through various
study groups, according to a number of Stanford
students who were recruited.
Delia Ibarra, a former co-chair of MEChA, said
she was recruited by the League through Gina
Hernandez, who served as co-chair with Ibarra last
year. Hernandez was an original founder of MEChA
in 1985 and has been a leader in the community
since then.
Ibarra said that, last year as co-chair, she told
Hernandez she admired her for her dedication to
Chicano issues and wanted to be more like her.
Hernandez replied that if Ibarra really wanted to
be like her, she would join the League, Ibarra said.
When Ibarra refused to join the League, she was
excluded from the MEChA decision-making process
by Hernandez and other League members in the
organization, according to Ibarra. She said she was
never consulted by Hernandez on important deci
sions in MEChA because she did not join the League
even though she was still the co-chair of the organ
ization.
Hernandez said she had never heard of the
League. She could not be reached last night for
further comment.
