# League recruitment deterred many
## Secretive process alienated dozens who were approached 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
A secretive recruitment process used by the
League of Revolutionary Struggle has alienated doz
ens of students involved in progressive politics over
the past few years, according to students interviewed
by The Daily.
Over the past several years, League members
have recruited elected student representatives and
potential candidates in the ASSU through the Com
mittee on Democracy in Education; MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group; the Asian American
Student Association and the Black Student Union.
Recruitment for the League is very selective. Most
students within these groups have not been recruited
and had not even heard of the League before The
Daily's recent stories on the League's influence at
Stanford.
Unlike many national Marxist organizations, the
League focuses its attention on people of color or
ganizations because of its theory of liberating op
pressed races in America through the creation of a
socialist state.
Recruitment is conducted for the League by past
and present Stanford students who are League mem
bers, as well as by various University staff members,
according to students who were recruited.
The Daily's information on recruitment comes
from interviews with more than 20 Stanford stu

dents who say they were recruited by the League.
Recruitment for the League by individual League
members at Stanford and other universities has
continued steadily to the present through various
study groups, according to a number of Stanford
students who were recruited.
Delia Ibarra, a former co-chair of MEChA, said
she was recruited by the League through Gina
Hernandez, who served as co-chair with Ibarra last
year. Hernandez was an original founder of MEChA
in 1985 and has been a leader in the community
since then.
Ibarra said that, last year as co-chair, she told
Hernandez she admired her for her dedication to
Chicano issues and wanted to be more like her.
Hernandez replied that if Ibarra really wanted to
be like her, she would join the League, Ibarra said.
When Ibarra refused to join the League, she was
excluded from the MEChA decision-making process
by Hernandez and other League members in the
organization, according to Ibarra. She said she was
never consulted by Hernandez on important deci
sions in MEChA because she did not join the League
even though she was still the co-chair of the organ
ization.
Hernandez said she had never heard of the
League. She could not be reached last night for
further comment.
League members "like to
recruit people who are very im
pressionable, people who they
think they can manipulate,"
Ibarra said. At Stanford, the
League primarily recruits fresh
men and sophomores, according
to Ibarra and others who were
recruited.
Richard Suh, who resigned the
chair of AASA in October because
of the League's heavy influence
in progressive politics, said he was
recruited over the course of three
years by Elsa Tsutaoka, the office
manager of the Asian American
Activities Center.
Suh said he attended four study
groups, beginning as a freshman
and continuing into his junior
year, before being asked to join
the League.
Tsutaoka denied any involve
ment in recruiting for the League.
Study groups are usually led by
one or two League members. Stu
dents who are recruited discuss
issues of socialism, Marxist the
ory, people of color movements
and student activism.
"It's kind of like Marxism 101,"
according to Suh.
Students who are recruited are
generally not initially told that the
study groups are sponsored by the
League or given information on
the League until they are invited
to more advanced study groups,
according to several students. Dis
cussions at advanced study groups
generally center around the role
of the League in progressive
movements.
In addition, many study groups
deal with the individual experi
ences of League members outside
Stanford, according to Suh and
other students who say they were
recruited.
Students are generally required

1 didn't pick up on
what they were trying
to do, and that's prob
ably why I wasn't in
vited back.'

to go through a series of study
groups before being asked to join
the League, according to Suh and
other students who were
recruited.
Students who are recruited
usually have a single contact per
son within the League, a member
who invites them to the study
groups or other League events and
eventually gives them information
on the League.
Study groups are often held at
El Centro Chicano and in upstairs
rooms in the School of Education,
as well as at the houses or apart
ments of League members outside
Stanford.
Most students interviewed by
The Daily who were initially
recruited did not continue going
to study groups, often because
they did not agree with the
League's ideology. "This group
ideologically wasn't what I was
looking for," said one recruit in
AASA who asked not to be iden
tified.
In addition, many students who
are recruited are not invited to
further meetings, presumably be
cause League members do not feel
that they fit the political criteria
of the League.
Several students reported going
to these meetings without
knowing that they were League
meetings or that they were being
recruited by the League. "I didn't
pick up on what they were trying
to do, and that's probably why I
wasn't invited back," said a
MEChA member who was
recruited in his freshman year.

The League has been more open
about its recruitment practices in
MEChA because of the larger
degree of influence it has in the
group, according to MEChA mem
bers who say they were recruited.
Although the process is still secre
tive, a greater number of students
in MEChA are recruited than in
other student of color communi
ties or the ASSU.
Students are often asked to go
to other events, such as speeches
by League members, many of
them in Berkeley or Oakland,
where the League has greater
membership. League leaders such
as Amiri Baraka have spoken at
Stanford in recent years to stu
dents, including a number of stu
dents who were being recruited
by the League.
After going to a series of study
groups or other League-sponsored
events, students being recruited
may be asked to join the League
depending on whether they are
"politically correct," meaning that
they fit the ideological criteria of
the League, according to sources.
Recruited students are required
to write an essay on why they
want to be in the League before
they are offered membership in
the organization.
The League tries to recruit stu
dents who are coalitionists rather
than nationalists, meaning those
who believe that color groups
should work together for a com
mon goal rather than focusing on
only the problems of individual
color communities.
League theory states that the
United States is composed of
various "oppressed nations," such
as the black nation in the South,
the Chicano nation in the South
west and the Asian-American na
tion. These nations must work in
coalition to bring about a socialist
state in America, according to a
1986 book by the League titled
"Peace, Justice, Equality and
Socialism."

to go through a series of study
groups before being asked to join
the League, according to Suh and
other students who were
recruited.
Students who are recruited
usually have a single contact per
son within the League, a member
who invites them to the study
groups or other League events and
eventually gives them information
on the League.
Study groups are often held at
El Centro Chicano and in upstairs
rooms in the School of Education,
as well as at the houses or apart
ments of League members outside
Stanford.
Most students interviewed by
The Daily who were initially
recruited did not continue going
to study groups, often because
they did not agree with the
League's ideology. "This group
ideologically wasn't what I was
looking for," said one recruit in
AASA who asked not to be iden
tified.
In addition, many students who
are recruited are not invited to
further meetings, presumably be
cause League members do not feel
that they fit the political criteria
of the League.
Several students reported going
to these meetings without
knowing that they were League
meetings or that they were being
recruited by the League. "I didn't
pick up on what they were trying
to do, and that's probably why I
wasn't invited back," said a
MEChA member who was
recruited in his freshman year.

The League has been more open
about its recruitment practices in
MEChA because of the larger
degree of influence it has in the
group, according to MEChA mem
bers who say they were recruited.
Although the process is still secre
tive, a greater number of students
in MEChA are recruited than in
other student of color communi
ties or the ASSU.
Students are often asked to go
to other events, such as speeches
by League members, many of
them in Berkeley or Oakland,
where the League has greater
membership. League leaders such
as Amiri Baraka have spoken at
Stanford in recent years to stu
dents, including a number of stu
dents who were being recruited
by the League.
After going to a series of study
groups or other League-sponsored
events, students being recruited
may be asked to join the League
depending on whether they are
"politically correct," meaning that
they fit the ideological criteria of
the League, according to sources.
Recruited students are required
to write an essay on why they
want to be in the League before
they are offered membership in
the organization.
The League tries to recruit stu
dents who are coalitionists rather
than nationalists, meaning those
who believe that color groups
should work together for a com
mon goal rather than focusing on
only the problems of individual
color communities.
League theory states that the
United States is composed of
various "oppressed nations," such
as the black nation in the South,
the Chicano nation in the South
west and the Asian-American na
tion. These nations must work in
coalition to bring about a socialist
state in America, according to a
1986 book by the League titled
"Peace, Justice, Equality and
Socialism."
A secretive recruitment process used by the
League of Revolutionary Struggle has alienated doz
ens of students involved in progressive politics over
the past few years, according to students interviewed
by The Daily.
Over the past several years, League members
have recruited elected student representatives and
potential candidates in the ASSU through the Com
mittee on Democracy in Education; MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group; the Asian American
Student Association and the Black Student Union.
Recruitment for the League is very selective. Most
students within these groups have not been recruited
and had not even heard of the League before The
Daily's recent stories on the League's influence at
Stanford.
Unlike many national Marxist organizations, the
League focuses its attention on people of color or
ganizations because of its theory of liberating op
pressed races in America through the creation of a
socialist state.
Recruitment is conducted for the League by past
and present Stanford students who are League mem
bers, as well as by various University staff members,
according to students who were recruited.
The Daily's information on recruitment comes
from interviews with more than 20 Stanford stu

dents who say they were recruited by the League.
Recruitment for the League by individual League
members at Stanford and other universities has
continued steadily to the present through various
study groups, according to a number of Stanford
students who were recruited.
Delia Ibarra, a former co-chair of MEChA, said
she was recruited by the League through Gina
Hernandez, who served as co-chair with Ibarra last
year. Hernandez was an original founder of MEChA
in 1985 and has been a leader in the community
since then.
Ibarra said that, last year as co-chair, she told
Hernandez she admired her for her dedication to
Chicano issues and wanted to be more like her.
Hernandez replied that if Ibarra really wanted to
be like her, she would join the League, Ibarra said.
When Ibarra refused to join the League, she was
excluded from the MEChA decision-making process
by Hernandez and other League members in the
organization, according to Ibarra. She said she was
never consulted by Hernandez on important deci
sions in MEChA because she did not join the League
even though she was still the co-chair of the organ
ization.
Hernandez said she had never heard of the
League. She could not be reached last night for
further comment.
League members "like to
recruit people who are very im
pressionable, people who they
think they can manipulate,"
Ibarra said. At Stanford, the
League primarily recruits fresh
men and sophomores, according
to Ibarra and others who were
recruited.
Richard Suh, who resigned the
chair of AASA in October because
of the League's heavy influence
in progressive politics, said he was
recruited over the course of three
years by Elsa Tsutaoka, the office
manager of the Asian American
Activities Center.
Suh said he attended four study
groups, beginning as a freshman
and continuing into his junior
year, before being asked to join
the League.
Tsutaoka denied any involve
ment in recruiting for the League.
Study groups are usually led by
one or two League members. Stu
dents who are recruited discuss
issues of socialism, Marxist the
ory, people of color movements
and student activism.
"It's kind of like Marxism 101,"
according to Suh.
Students who are recruited are
generally not initially told that the
study groups are sponsored by the
League or given information on
the League until they are invited
to more advanced study groups,
according to several students. Dis
cussions at advanced study groups
generally center around the role
of the League in progressive
movements.
In addition, many study groups
deal with the individual experi
ences of League members outside
Stanford, according to Suh and
other students who say they were
recruited.
