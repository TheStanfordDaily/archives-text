# Kennedy announces support for Standard interpretation
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
yesterday announced his support for the
recently passed Fundamental Standard in
terpretation designed to protect victims of
discriminatory harassment.
Because Kennedy has authority to over
turn the Student Conduct Legislative
Council's proposal, his announcement
cleared the way for the interpretation to
take effect June 11.
In his statement, Kennedy said he
believes the SCLC's process of drafting the
revised interpretation was "thorough and
fair."
However, he said he recognized some
members of the community are dissatisfied

with the proposed interpretation, drafted
by Law Prof. Thomas Grey.
"Some members of the community fear
that the proposers (of the interpretation)
have gone too far, while others are dis
satisfied because they believe they have
not gone far enough," Kennedy said.
In its final form, the interpretation
makes it a violation of the Fundamental
Standard to use fighting words directed to
stigmatize an individual or a small number
of individuals on the basis of their sex,
race, color, physical disability, religion,
sexual orientation, or national or ethnic
origin.
The SCLC approved the interpretation
last Thursday by a vote of 8-3.
Kennedy, in his statement, said he can
use his "residual authority to intervene

Kennedy said he had some
problems with the wording
of parts of the interpretation
but that ultimately the inter
pretation stands on its
merits.

only under extraordinary circumstances"
according to Stanford's constitution.
Speaking on KZSU last night, Kennedy
said he had some problems with the wor
ding of parts of the revised interpretation,
particularly the definition of discrimina
tory harassment, but on the whole, the

interpretation stands on its own merits.
SCLC Chair and Law Prof. Robert Rabin,
who voted in favor of the proposed inter
pretation, said he was delighted that Ken
nedy supports the SCLC's decision.
Rabin noted he was pleased with the
overall process, even though there was
some disagreement about the proposal
among the members of the council.
"It was a difficult balance to strike,"
Rabin said.
Perry Friedman, an SCLC member who
was one of the more outspoken critics of
the proposed interpretation, said he was
disappointed by Kennedy's announcement,
though he was not surprised by it.
Friedman added that people will have to
wait for the first few cases tried under the
new interpretation to see how well it works.
