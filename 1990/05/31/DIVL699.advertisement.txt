You've got less than a month to decide. Which Mac is it going to be: the affordable Mac Plus; the
versatile Mac SE; or the powerful Mac SE/30? If you don't already own a Macintosh, now is the
best time to buy one. Don't blow this opportunity to take advantage of the lowest prices Apple
has ever offered on its Macintosh Computers. For those of you who are going into the "real"
world- make a sound investment and purchase a new Macintosh at a price you will never
see again Whether you're just going away for the summer, or are graduating and packing up for
good -do the smart thing. Pack a Mac away with you. At these prices, you can't afford not to!
