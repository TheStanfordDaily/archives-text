## Gorby's visit is a dream come true for capitalists 
### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
Since he can't be on campus for Gorbachev's
visit, David Donze of New Orleans wants the
next best thing.
He wants a Gorby commemorative T-shirt.
News of the Soviet leader's visit has set
hungry capitalists, including the University
itself, scrambling to make a quick buck.
The Office of Public Affairs, in charge of
handling Gorbachev's visit, is now selling the
"official" commemorative T-shirt. More than
100 of the 2,500 shirts were sold yesterday,
the first day of sales.
The cream-colored T-shirt reads, "Gorbac
hev at Stanford." The lettering on the shirt
is stylistically consistent with other official
memorabilia such as tickets, programs and
posters.
"Everybody wants a T-shirt when there is
an event like this," said Sandi Risser, assistant
to the vice president for public affairs.
The University hopes it can make a pretty
penny on these shirts to help defray the costs
of the Gorbachev visit.
The shirt is being sold in the main lobby
of the Hoover Institution, White Plaza, the
Quad's information booth and the News and
Publications Services office.
The Bookstore has also ordered Gorbachev
T-shirts. One design arrived at the store Tues
day, and another will arrive tomorrow or Mon
day.
The shirt in the store reads "Glasnost" and
features the Statue of Liberty with the Soviet
hammer-and-sickle symbol. So far, more than
a dozen T-shirts have been sold, according to
Bookstore clothing buyer Laura Dowling.
The other design will feature an American
flag, a Soviet flag and the Stanford seal.
Dowling expects this shirt to sell better than
the other.
The Bookstore was hardly taking a gamble
on this business venture. The store received
many phone calls immediately after the an
nouncement of Gorbachev's visit by people who
assumed it would have T-shirts. Dowling had
previously decided against purchasing any
shirts.
