## Gorby's visit is a dream come true for capitalists 
### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
Since he can't be on campus for Gorbachev's
visit, David Donze of New Orleans wants the
next best thing.
He wants a Gorby commemorative T-shirt.
News of the Soviet leader's visit has set
hungry capitalists, including the University
itself, scrambling to make a quick buck.
The Office of Public Affairs, in charge of
handling Gorbachev's visit, is now selling the
"official" commemorative T-shirt. More than
100 of the 2,500 shirts were sold yesterday,
the first day of sales.
The cream-colored T-shirt reads, "Gorbac
hev at Stanford." The lettering on the shirt
is stylistically consistent with other official
memorabilia such as tickets, programs and
posters.
"Everybody wants a T-shirt when there is
an event like this," said Sandi Risser, assistant
to the vice president for public affairs.
The University hopes it can make a pretty
penny on these shirts to help defray the costs
of the Gorbachev visit.
The shirt is being sold in the main lobby
of the Hoover Institution, White Plaza, the
Quad's information booth and the News and
Publications Services office.
The Bookstore has also ordered Gorbachev
T-shirts. One design arrived at the store Tues
day, and another will arrive tomorrow or Mon
day.
The shirt in the store reads "Glasnost" and
features the Statue of Liberty with the Soviet
hammer-and-sickle symbol. So far, more than
a dozen T-shirts have been sold, according to
Bookstore clothing buyer Laura Dowling.
The other design will feature an American
flag, a Soviet flag and the Stanford seal.
Dowling expects this shirt to sell better than
the other.
The Bookstore was hardly taking a gamble
on this business venture. The store received
many phone calls immediately after the an
nouncement of Gorbachev's visit by people who
assumed it would have T-shirts. Dowling had
previously decided against purchasing any
shirts.

"The whole idea [of capitalizing

American."
Small entrepreneur Maureen
Folz considers herself a trendset
ter rather than a follower; she
decided against ordering special
Gorby merchandise.
She and her husband have been
selling Soviet T-shirts for about
three years. Last week she re
turned to White Plaza after a
yearlong absence. Friday was her
second best sales day ever.
Folz is concerned that she
might not be able to set up her
stand Monday during Gorbachev's
visit due to security reasons.
"I'm not going to call up the
Secret Service and say, 'Did you
forget to call me?' " Folz said. "I
really hate to ask."
"Our concept of things has
never been pro-communist or pro-

Russian," Folz said. "We just want
to be positive without being corny.
This is our little contribution to
the end of the Cold War."
According to Folz, there has
been more media interest than
customers. However, as a result
of an article in the San Francisco
Examiner, the head of the Los
Angeles International and San
Francisco International airports'
gift shops called her expressing
interest in her T-shirts.
Folz and her husband carry 25
T-shirt styles, all of which are in
Russian. The most popular reads,
"God Bless America."
Folz agrees that her increased
success lately is ironic, but says,
"We're less capitalistic than the
reporters asking questions."
She and her husband are
branching out into environmental
T-shirts and hope to explore pos
sibilities in Europe. For now,
though, Folz just wants Gorba
chev to autograph "his picture,"
a T-shirt with a birthmarked
happy face.
Now that would be a big seller.
