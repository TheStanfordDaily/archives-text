# Student thefts on the rise at Bookstore
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
"George" was in a hurry.
He glanced through his pho
tographs at the Bookstore, and
he wasn't happy with them. He
didn't feel like waiting in line to
pay the less than $10 the pic
tures cost, so he simply walked
out of the store with them.
Mistake.
"This guy came up to me and
held out a badge," George said.
"He said he wanted to ask me
a few questions. I knew right
away what he wanted."
George handed the pictures
over to a Bookstore security
agent and accompanied him in
side. The agent, along with the
security manager of the Book
store, asked George several
questions about what he took
and why. They wrote a computer
report, and George waited for
the Stanford Police to arrive.
"The cop came and talked to
me," George said, adding, "I had
to promise to appear in court."
George spoke with a lawyer,

and a few months later he was
in court pleading guilty to petty
theft. The judge fined George
more them $200.
Like the overwhelming
mEyority of shoplifters arrested
at the Bookstore, George is a
Stanford student. His crime,
which he says he regrets, is part
of a growing pattern of at
tempted thefts from the Book
store — a problem the store's
15-person security force is work
ing hard to crack down on.
Two-thirds of the security
agents at the Bookstore are men,
and all but three are Stanford
students. There is always at least
one agent on the floor of the
store, and there are often six or
seven patrolling at a time.
To stay low-key, the security
officers have no uniforms — just
intimidating badges they use
when they stop someone. A uni
form could intensify the an
tagonism many people already
feel toward the store, according
to Ken Van Vleck, Bookstore se
curity manager.
When agents spot a suspect

Pens, shorts and
hats are some of the
most frequently
picked-up items.

picking up an item, they keep
track of the time it was taken
and watch everything the person
does while still in the store. If
the person leaves the store with
out paying, they wait until the
culprit is "well beyond the front
steps" of the store, in order to
give the potential shoplifter a
chance to change his or her
mind.
If the culprit does not decide
to return the item, as sometimes
happens, "anywhere between
one and five" agents stop the
shoplifter and ask him to come
inside. The agents try to get the
shoplifter's side of the stcry, and
if they still have a strong case,
Van Vleck makes a citizen's ar
rest.
Next, the Stanford Police is

sues a citation, and the Book
store submits a complaint form
and a report on the incident.
The store often chooses to pros
ecute, and the suspect can be
fined or even jailed.
The most popular items stolen
year-round are pens, but differ
ent items are "hot" at different
times of the year.
Van Vleck tracks these items
and posts them on an "Item
Watch" list in his office. Last
week the Item Watch listed
walkman stereos, technical
books and photos. During the
winter holiday season Van Vleck
lists tiny items which people
steal for "Secret Santa"-type gift
exchanges, and during spring
quarter shorts and hats are
picked up frequently.
Bookstore agents will stop a
suspect for taking an item as
small as a 5-cent Tootsie Roll,
because frequently the suspect
will admit to having taken other
items as well. Shoplifters rarely
take more than a few hundred
dollars' worth of items, but any
amount is a concern to the Book
store. Van Vleck said for every
dollar in stolen merchandise, the
Bookstore has to sell $30 to
make up the profit lost.
And that means they watch
everyone. Bookstore shoplifters
range in age from one 9-year-old
boy to a 73-year-old woman.
Eighty-five percent of shoplifters
are Stanford students, but there
are often some surprises.
For example, security agent
Elliot Brandt once had to arrest
a professor. The professor was
taking textbooks, and Brandt
didn't realize the shoplifter's
identity until he stopped him
outside the store.
But Brandt says the security
force is indifferent in its arrests.
"It goes the same for students
and staff and people from Palo
Alto," he said.
So if you're ever in a hurry
at the Bookstore, perhaps
George might have some advice
for you.
"Don't do it to begin with. It's
not worth it. You may think
you're going to save yourself a
few bucks, but if you get caught,
it's just too much agony and em
harassment that you were so stu
pid."
