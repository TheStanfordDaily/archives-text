Quake rocks Peru
LIMA, Peru (AP) — A strong earthquake
killed at least 115 people, iryured more than
800 and nearly destroyed several towns in
Peru's northeastern jungle, Civil Defense of
ficials said yesterday.
At least 42 people were missing after Tues
day night's quake, which was followed by a
number of aftershocks. One aftershock Wed
nesday morning measured 5.1 on the Richter
scale.
Civil defense officials declared a state of
emergency late yesterday in San Martin prov
ince, 400 miles north of Lima.
At least 35 of the confirmed 115 deaths
from Tuesday night's quake occurred in
Moyobamba, a farming center of 50,000 people
and the capital of San Martin, officials said.
The updated Civil Defense casualty counts
said at least 818 people were injured.
The quake occurred at 9:33 p.m. and lasted
45 seconds. It was centered in the jungle 75
miles northeast of Moyobamba, according to
the Peruvian Geophysical Institute.
Willis Jacobs, a spokesman for the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden,
Colo, said the quake measured 6.3 on the
Richter scale.
German compromise sought
OTTAWA (AP) — Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev said yesterday that the West's in
sistence on keeping a united Germany in
NATO sounds "like an old record," and indi
cated he would offer new ideas to break the
impasse.
"We do have some leeway to find an accom
modation. There are different scenarios that
might not be exactly what the West would
propose," he told reporters before he flew to
Washington for his summit with President
Bush.
Western leaders "are trying to dictate to a
certain degree," Gorbachev said. "There should
be no attempt to dictate a solution."
Gorbachev said he and Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney spent "a considerable part of our
time" discussing German unification, but said
they had not resolved a disagreement over
whether a united Germany could belong to
NATO.
Hostage releases frozen
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - A Lebanese Shiite
Moslem leader with close ties to groups holding
hostages said efforts to release six Americans
held in Lebanon remain frozen because of
negative U.S. positions.
Hussein Musawi, head of the Islamic Amal
faction based in east Lebanon, spoke a day
after the Bush administration announced it
had provided Iran with information on
Iranians missing in Lebanon as a gesture of
goodwill.
In an interview on the Lebanese Voice of
the People radio station, he said "those con
cerned in Iran and Syria are dismayed by the
negative American stands."
At a May 3 news conference, President Bush
said he hoped that providing Iran with infor
mation on the fate of the four missing Iranians
would satisfy Iran's request for a gesture of
thanks for its role in freeing two U.S. hostages.
Bush also said he remained firmly opposed to
negotiating for the release of the remaining
six American hostages in Lebanon.
Angolans propose talks
LUANDA, Angola (AP) — The government
and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels probably
will meet in coming weeks for another round
of negotiations aimed at ending the 15-year-old
civil war.
A cease-fire arranged June 22, 1989, with
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire as
mediateor, but it collapsed within days.
Direct negotiations broke down shortly af
terward. They resumed April 24 in Evora,
Portugal, with the Portuguese government as
host and go-between.
The way to peace talks was opened by re
gional peace accords signed by Angola, Cuba
and South Africa in December 1988 under
U.S. sponsorship. The agreement provide for
the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban soldiers from
Angola and an end to South African aid to
the rebels.
Contras resume disarming
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Contra
rebels yesterday agreed to resume disarming
in an accord with the government that gives
the rebels their own police force and a voice
in government.
Some Contra commanders could be sent to
Nicaraguan embassies abroad for their safety,
a government source said.
