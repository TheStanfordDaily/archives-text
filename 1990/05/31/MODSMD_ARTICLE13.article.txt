# 6.8 quake wreaks havoc in Eastern Europe
## 
### 
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - An
earthquake shook buildingß from Mos
cow to Istanbul yesterday and cut a
path of destruction across Romania,
where eight people were killed and
nearly 300 injured.
Chunks of concrete from high-rise
buildingß crashed to the ground and
crushed people in this capital city of
2.2 million, killing two. Tens of thou
sands of residents rushed into the
streets, many crying and screaming in
fear as ceilings fell, walls cracked and
books toppled from shelves.
Romanians leaped in panic from
windows and balconies, and some were
badly hurt, ambulance officials said.
It was the third mtyor earthquake
since 1977 with its epicenter in
Romania's Carpathian Mountains. Its
force was felt in the Soviet Union and
Bulgaria — where injuries were re
ported — and in Hungary, Greece,
Turkey, Yugoslavia and Poland.
The quake center was 190 miles
northeast of Bucharest, in the wooded
Vrancea range.
BBC monitors in London, quoting
the Bulgarian news agency BTA, said
one person died in Silistra of a quake
induced heart attack. Soviet legislator
Ilmars Bishers said initial reports in
dicated some Soviet deaths occurred,
but he gave no details.
Richter scale readings ranged from
6.5 to 7.5. Uppsala Seismological Cen
ter in Sweden said the quake was felt
so widely because it was about 63 miles
deep.
"I think it was this deafening sound
of cracking walls that scared people,"
said clerical worker Sica Burcea, 52.
"The building was swinging horizon
tally and vertically. We were lucky only
to have some cracks in the walls. I
shivered when I realized 1977 was
coming back."
More than 1,500 Romanians died in
a 1977 earthquake.
A communique from the General In
spectorate of Police said two people
died in Bucharest, two in the Danube
River port of Braila, and one each in
eastern Buzau, southeastern lalomita,
central Brasov and nearby Prahova
County.
Food shop clerk Petruta Lungu was
killed when she ran outside and was
hit by bricks and concrete falling from

an upstairs wall, Bucharest police said.
A man's body was pulled from rubble
outside the shop.
The inspectorate reported 296
people injured, 45 critically. It said 35
of the critically injured were in Buc
harest, where 102 people were hurt.
"I fell on the stairs as the earth
quake was reaching its peak and my
fingers went out of their sockets," said
Cristina Amza, 28, who was recovering
from an operation at Bucharest's
Emergency Hospital. "It was a night
mare."
The earthquake lasted for about 45
seconds, the Romanian news agency
Rompres said.
In Moscow, Soviet officials said the

quake was felt from the Crimea to the
Baltics and damaged dozens of build
ings in the southwest.
In Ottawa, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev said he was told shocks
shook Moldavia and Armenia but "no
devastation, no destruction." He said
he saw no reason to break off his trip
to return home, as he did in December
1988, when a quake killed an estimated
25,000 people in Armenia. The 1988
quake prompted him to cut short
travel plans and fly directly home from
New York.
In Soviet Moldavia, bordering on
Romania, six people in Kogul were
hospitalized for quake-related injuries,
Lt. Ivan Koltuk of the regional Interior

Department said by telephone.
Buildings were damaged in Izmail,
Bolgrad, Reni, Kogul and Komrat, So
viet officials said.
Buildings shook throughout Mos
cow, 1,000 miles east of Bucharest,
including the offices of The Associated
Press. The 10-story U.S. Embassy
building was evacuated. Telephone
lines were knocked out and buildings
shook in at least four Soviet republics.
In Istanbul, the Anatolia News
Agency said tremors were felt in east
em Thrace in Turkey and elsewhere
around the Marmara Sea region.
The quake also was felt in Hungary.
A nuclear power plant was shut
down in Kozlodoui, Bulgaria.
