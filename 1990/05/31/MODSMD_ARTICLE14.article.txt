# Yeltsin proposes secession of Russia in 100 days
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Newly elected
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
yesterday he will seek sovereignty for
the largest Soviet republic within his
first 100 days in office. He also
demanded that the Soviet premier
resign.
"We must turn this pyramid on its
head," Yeltsin told a news conference
one day after his election.
He said he would try to mend fences
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev, but he outlined a program far
more radical than Gorbachev's.
Under Yeltsin's plan, Russia and the
other 14 Soviet republics would
remain within a reconstituted Soviet
Union, but have far more power than
the central government in most mat
ters, excluding defense and national
security.
"We must withstand the dictate of
the center," Yeltsin said. "If we
withstand 100 days, if we are not

pulled down ... Russia will be indepen
dent in every respect. It will make its
own decisions. Russian laws must take
priority over the union (national) laws.
The Russian constitution must
precede the union constitution."
Russia accounts for 52 percent of
the Soviet population and three
quarters of its land.
Yeltsin spoke to reporters in the
Grand Kremlin Palace, where the Con
gress of Peoples' Deputies of the Rus
sian Federation named him president
Tuesday by a slim, four-vote mEyority.
Yeltsin said each Soviet republic
should have sovereignty, giving it the
right to overrule laws passed by the
central government and conclude
treaties with other Soviet republics
and foreign countries. Russia may
eventually seek membership in the
United Nations, he said.
Yeltsin said he would open treaty
negotiations immediately with the

secessionist Baltic republics. And he
said that if Lithuania suspends its
March 11 declaration of independence,
Gorbachev should end the sanctions
he imposed on the republic and engage
in a dialogue.
"I do think 100 days is sufficient to
do that," Yeltsin said, sketching out
the steps he planned to take early in
his term.
He said his first task was negotiat
ing with more moderate and conser
vative members of the Russian Con
gress to forge a working coalition, in
cluding nominating compromise can
didates as his deputies and as heads
of congressional committees.
He said he had consulted with 200
members of the Congress since his
election, seeking alliances.
Any declaration of Russian
sovereignty must be approved by the
Russian Congress, of which Yeltsin is
chairman, or president.

"Russia needs and I think it will
acquire genuine sovereignty . .. and
will at last have its own internal and
external policies," he said.
The Russian Congress is a newly
created body that is the highest au
thority in the Russian republic. As its
leader, tall, white-haired Yeltsin will
play a mtyor role in shaping his own
powers and duties.
He poses a mtyor challenge to Gor
bachev.
Yeltsin attacked the reform program
presented by Soviet Premier Nikolai
Ryzhkov, which touched ofT a round
of panic buying by calling for steep
increases in food prices.
"Regrettably, the ... (national) lead
ership and government at this point
is losing the trust of the nation," he
said.
"I do think we should demand its
resignation,"he said, referring to the
Council of Ministers.
