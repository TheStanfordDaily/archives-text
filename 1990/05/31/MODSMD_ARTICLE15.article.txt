Two jets collide
SPENCER, lowa (AP) - Two Air
National Guard fighter jets collided
in a ball of flame yesterday during
a training flight over northwestern
lowa but both pilots and a civilian
passenger parachuted to safety.
Debris from the two A-7 jets
tumbled to the ground over a wide
area in farm fields two miles north
of Royal. There were no reports of
damage on the ground.
"They just hit head on," said John
Schultz, who saw the collision from
his home in Spencer, eight miles

northeast of the crash site and about
70 miles southeast of Sioux Falls,
S.D.
"Each one exploded in a ball of
fire, and that was it. I didn't see the
parachutes."
Launch delayed
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -
Space shuttle Columbia will not take
off until next week at the earliest
after a fuel leak scrubbed yesterday's
launch, NASA officials said.
Columbia had been scheduled to
lift off at 12:38 a.m. EDT with a
$150 million observatory called

Astro. But it was called off about six
hours before launch time when hy
drogen began leaking while Colum
bia's external fuel tank was being
loaded.
Workers were expected to enter Co
lumbia's rear engine compartment
early today to search for the leak
and assess the problem. But first all
the hydrogen must be vented from
the external tank, and the system
must be purged with non-flammable
helium.
15 indicted
NEW YORK (AP) — Four compet

ing crime families worked together

The 15 people indicted in the al
leged scheme include the reputed
bosses of the Genovese and Luchese
crime families. The 69-count indict
ment alleges racketeering and other
charges.
"Today's indictment closes the cash
window on this lucrative enterprise,"
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said at a news conference.
