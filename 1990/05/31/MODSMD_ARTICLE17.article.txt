Recall election gives
students last chance
to voice dissatisfaction

THIS IS YOUR last chance.
After weeks of endless
debate and confusion, what
could be the final chapter in the
saga of the 1990 ASSU elections
will take place next Monday and
Tuesday, as a special recall election
is held that could remove Four Our
Future from office.
The students protesting the elec
tion followed due process in
gaining the 2,000 signatures re
quired to force the election, and
it's good to see that the ASSU is,
in this case, willing to be bound
by its own rules.
All of this, of course, is a result
of the massive unpopularity of the
decisions made in counting the
votes in the Council of Presidents
election last month which gave
Four Our Future a victory in an
extremely close race.
The decision in this one-item
election is not a recall in the tradi
tional sense that a recall is usually
meant to remove an unpopular, in
adequate or corrupt representative
from office.
Instead, it could more appropri
ately be called the third step in
the process of validating and cer
tifying the election results, as its
sponsor, Students United for Fair
Elections, is the group that fought

the senate's ratification of the
original election results.
Fee refunds Eire not contingent
on voting in this election, but ad
equate representation is.
For this reason, it is imperative
that everybody gets out and votes.
The ASSU is still a democracy, and
a student body that feels inade
quately represented has only itself
to blame.
Then comes the hard part: Stu
dents have to decide whether or
not to recall the COP.
This is not a choice between two
slates: The only options are to take
the new COP out of office or to
leave them in.
Several factors must be consid
ered in the decision, making it a
potentially difficult choice. If the
COP is recalled, there will be no
COP in office for the summer, no
one making plans for the next year.
In this case, another election will
be held in the fall to select a COP
that will take office immediately.
On the other hand, not recalling
the COP may still leave a group
of students feeling disenfranchised
and railroaded, disappointed by a
decision on election bylaws that 67
percent of students in a Daily poll
indicated they disagreed with.
Most importantly, this election
should mark the end of the entire
write-in vote controversy. If the
COP is not recalled, then they will
have their mandate to lead and
can get to work. If they are
recalled, then we can start the en
tire process over and get it right
this time.
Choose wisely, and vote.
