Gorbachev is not coming for multicultural lesson

I THINK THE Daily is a lot of fun,
and I always read the opinions
page to get my morning dose of
amusement. However, after ceasing to
guffaw over Friday's editorial column
about Gorbachev's visit to Stanford, I
felt that someone should try to inject a
little reality into the picture.
Does the editorial board really think
that Stanford's main offering to Gorba
chev should be "to convey its commit
ment to multiculturalism?" Multicul
turalism is a fine thing for Stanford
journalists, amateur politicians and
even the odd student to spend most of
their time going on about.
Someday they might discover the

irrelevance of it all to the different
ethnic, cultural and religious groups in
the rather less refined atmosphere of
Watts, the Bronx or Belfast. They
might even think about paying some
attention to other more mundane
problems that students here face, like
the cost of Food Service, the lack of a
bar on campus or the extortionate
mark-up that the Bookstore puts on
required textbooks.
Nonetheless, at Stanford the whole
multiculturalism thing is standard
student politics and rates quite highly
in amusement value.
In the Soviet Union a "commitment

to multiculturalism" means a civil war
between Armenia and Azerbaijan,
ethnic Russians being killed in other
Asian republics, Russian fascists
hounding Jews, and the Lithuanians
risking starvation and invasion in their
attempt to get out.
I assume that Gorbachev is coming
here to see experts on diplomacy and
economics, like George Shultz and Ed
Hewett. Presumably the editorial board
thinks they should tell him to set up
theme houses in Moscow for "people of
color," institute Culture, Ideas and
Values courses in Armenian high
schools or appoint a Georgian as his
successor â€” the last one (a Mr. Stalin)

had quite an impact.
It's only a wild guess, but he might
be slightly more interested in talking
to Stanford's experts about industrial
reconstruction or the introduction of
democracy. Perhaps the editorial board
could for once remove its "multicul
tural" blinkers and instead feel
"honored and excited" that there are
people of such caliber here that Gorba
chev wants to meet to help direct his
"venturing into uncharted waters."
On the other hand, I don't want to
be denied my daily chuckle.
