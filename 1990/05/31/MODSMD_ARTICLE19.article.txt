# Gorbachev should not be a welcome guest at Stanford
## 
### 
As Stanford University students, we
are outraged at the University's will
ingness to accept a visit from Mikhail
Gorbachev.
Gorbachev is a dictator, leader of a
government that has no regard for its
citizens' rights. Depite the highly
publicized "reforms," the Soviet Union
is still a totalitarian regime, controlling
every aspect of its citizens' lives, sup
pressing independent economic activity
and forcibly preventing people from
emigrating.
A dictator, who tramples human
rights, should be treated like the crimi
nal he is. Those who instead welcome
and honor Gorbachev are betraying his
victims, the millions of enslaved people
in the Soviet Union.
It is especially appalling that a uni
versity, supposedly devoted to academic
freedom, would honor the leader of a
country in which the government con

trols the expression of ideas, closes any
private press that goes too far out of
line and has the power to imprison
people for expressing dissenting views.
