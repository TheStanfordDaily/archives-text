# Study shows widespread discontent at SLAC

Widespread worker discontent
caused by an intimidating manage
ment style plagues operations at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, ac
cording to a recently released indepen
dent study.
Forty-three percent of the workers
surveyed in the study, conducted by
the Santa Cruz-based consulting firm
Frank Lee Associates, said they were
dissatisfied with an intimidating man
agement style that stifled individual
initiative.
The study, released Friday, was con

ducted in April after a number of SLAC
faculty and staff voiced concerns over
an oppressive management style. Lee
Lyon, SLAC personnel director, said
the study was not a direct response
to worker complaints but a routine
study done to evaluate organizational
effectiveness.
According to the report, many
workers saw SLAC as "a highly stress
ful, risk adverse, 'don't raise problems
or you will be punished' kind of envi
ronment, with many managers per
ceived as being insensitive and
demeaning, or managerially incompe
tent."
Responding to the survey results,

SLAC Director Burton Richter an
nounced to workers on Monday that
managers will be told to change their
management styles according to a new
set of guidelines. The report suggested
this new management style include
"supervisory and communications
skills, consultation and commitment
building skills, problem solving, tran
sition and change management skills."
Lyon said yesterday there will be a
follow-up survey within the next few
months to ensure that the manage
ment changes are implemented. Rich
ter estimated that the review will take
place over eight to 12 months. Lyon
said the process of changing managers'

habits will take much longer before
positive results are evident.
Lyon said, "There weren't any big
surprises" uncovered in the report,
and many of the findings validate
anecdotal information about worker
dissatisfaction. He said, however, that
morale at SLAC remains extremely
high.
"There's a lot of loyalty to the or
ganization," he said. "We have, as com
pared to Silicon Valley companies, ex
tremely low turnover rates."
Lyon estimated that SLAC has turn
over rates between 6 and 8 percent,
as compared to between 18 and
25 percent in industry. Silicon
Valley companies generally do not
conduct high-energy physics re
search.
After the report, Lyon said the
attitude among the upper man
agement is to move forward to
try to solve the problems identi
fied. "I think the general tone is
that the organization has taken a
big step in being willing to take
a look at itself. ... We want to
look at the future, not the past,
because you can't change the past
but you can change the future."

John Arthur, a research associ
ate at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory, said the
management styles at SLAC
would be different from smaller
labs like the radiation laboratory.
He said the smaller size of the
radiation lab allows conflicts to
be resolved face to face, while dis
putes would be more visible at a
large facilty like SLAC.
By necessity, high-energy
physics labs like SLAC are large,
involving enormous amounts of
resources directed at a few experi
ments. By contrast, small labs like
the radiation lab have 20 to 30
experiments running at the same
time, and the management style
is more decentralized.
