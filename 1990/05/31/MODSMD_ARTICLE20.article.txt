# Verbal attacks strike continual fear in women
## 
### 
One night I was walking from Old
Union to Tresidder. Normally that
little courtyard is deserted at night,
but that night there were three young
males (I hesitate to use the word
"men" or even adults) there, talking
and laughing and generally just clown
ing around. So far, so harmless.
As I passed them, they became
silent. Then one called out to me,
"Rape! Get away! Rape!" and all three
laughed.

But wasn't it a rich joke? That I, a
woman, was walking alone and un
afraid through a dark, fairly uni
nhabited section of campus? Gracious,
what is the world coming to if men
can't spice up women's lives with a
little gracious anxiety.
I'd really like to thank you, you
little boys, for not letting me forget for
a second those charming socialization
processes that attempt to make fear in
women the norm.
