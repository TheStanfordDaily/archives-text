# Recall leader used sexist language to describe women, sex

"I did get a recall," says Perry
Friedman on the front page of the
May 25 Daily, "but I still haven't got
ten a woman."
If he really "wants babes" as badly
as it appears, maybe he should petition
for 2,000 more signatures and ask for
donations.

Then he can buy as many life-sized,
stuffed woman-objects as he likes
(certain stores on Broadway in San
Francisco are a good place to start),
and put "MY BABE" labels on them.
Friedman thinks that "Stanford has
a stick so far up its ass it can't even
see straight, pun (hopefully) not in
tended." Perhaps he should also think
about the correlation between his
casually using images of anal rape and
his not "getting" a woman.
But then again, I'm sure stuffed
cotton dummies won't mind vio
lent/sexist language. They can't take it
to heart because they don't have one.
That's what they're made for.
