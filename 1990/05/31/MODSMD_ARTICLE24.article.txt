## Tips for future columnists 
### 
ONCE UPON A time, long long
ago, in the Daily office ...
Two staffers huddle around a
lonely, empty mailbox:
"Sniff, sniff. What are we gonna
do?"
"Geez, how should I know?"
"We've gotta fill pages four and five
somehow."
"Controversy. Yeah, that's what we
need."
"Hey, I know! We'll do an expos 6 on
the Marxist-Leninist League of Revolu
tionary Struggle!"
"Don't be ridiculous. Who'd be inter
ested in that sort of thing? Besides,
we're not that desperate."
"Yeah, yeah, you're right."
"What we need are new targets for
angry letter writers."
"Student voices .. . someone to tick
people off so they'll write letters. Hmm
And thus the birth of The Daily
columnist.
Actually, it's been fun, although I did
sort of shudder when the photographer
yelled, "Hey, it's your last chance to
back out now!" as he took my picture
(explaining my dubious smile).
In deference to all those interested
in renting out this space on page four
next quarter, here are some "Colum
nist Pros and Cons" you should con
sider before applying:
Why am I doing this? syndrome
Deadly if combined with Sophomore
Slump Syndrome, the "Why am I
doing this?" syndrome is known to

creep up some time after the third
column — around midterm season.
That "Yeah, I love to write!" eager
beaver attitude may disappear suddenly
on a Tuesday night with two problem
sets, a paper and a midterm staring
you in the face. As you gaze out of
your window and see hundreds of
Dailys with pictures of your face lying
dormant on the sidewalks, you may
despair and wither into .. .
Irrelevance syndrome
It's three hours till press time and
you don't have a topic. You panic. You
read Time, Release, The Review (if
you're that desperate) in search of The
Idea. You spend long grueling hours
debating between sending your Wizard
of Oz book report from fourth grade or
writing about food service. If you're
unlucky you degenerate into . . .
What would happen if I just didn't
turn it in? syndrome
It's a question that haunts every
journalist. Would they fill up your
space with a big ad, draw pictures to
ridicule you or leave the space blank
for the world to witness your flaki
ness? The possibilities are chilling.
Despite the stress that may accompany
column-writing it might be worth it
just for that ...
Gosh it's fun-to-get-mail feeling
Tired of grinning sheepishly into an
empty P.O. Box? This job's for you.
Mail ranging from appreciative notes
("really enjoyed your column") to hate
notes ("you dam Asians are never
satisfied" — By the way, whoever you

are, you spelled "damn" wrong.) to
angry letters (you'll discover just how
controversial you never really knew
you were) may pour forth.
The free speech — it's your forum
pitch
Ahem. As part of the great forum
that is the cornerstone of free speech
and democracy, you instigate intellec
tual discussion (hopefully). What more
could you ask for? Except total .. .
Artistic rein — you can thumb your
nose at anyone
Within protected speech, you are free
to taunt, criticize, rip on, praise,
provoke, shock, entertain, alienate,
befriend and comment on anything you
want. No paper topic constraints: you
can write poetry about sludge, contem
plate the wonders of toothpaste and
write odes to insects ... and all your
words will be immortalized by the . . .
Power of print
Okay, so it's not Time magazine, but
print somehow lends words a credence
and an audience. And when it's all
over, 16 columns and 5,600 words
later, you can sit back and heave a
sigh of relief. Whew.
