## The
						Stanford Community McCarthyite labels strip individuals of their humanity 
### 
ONE ONLY NEEDS to glance
over the annals of history to see
that nothing has stripped away
the humanity of individuals and com
munities of color more than McCar
thyism. By calling people
"manipulators," "deceptive," with
hidden agendas, etc., Daily articles
have stripped away my and other
people's humanity. It is this atmos
phere of fear of ourselves and others
around us that one can only escape by
turning on someone else and pointing
a finger at your friends.
Hardly an "infiltrator" to the Chi
cano movement, I was born into it.
Much like Delia Ibarra, I too was
thrust into Stanford's Chicano commu
nity as a frosh (and sophomore) mem
ber of El Centro Chicano's staff trying
to contribute to the advancement of
Chicano people. As a sophomore, I was
one of the co-founders of the current
MEChA and was the co-chair last year.
A very vocal (some might say loud)
Chicana female from a poor family
background (I was born to a Chicano
construction worker and factory
worker on 6th Street in East Los
Angeles), I have learned much since
that time, and my motivation for being
active and visions for Chicano students
and people have remained constant.
I don't want Chicanos or any other
people to face the humiliation that my
mother faced when speaking to her
kids in Spanish in the supermarket.
And I hope that no one's father ever

has to give up his dream of being a
musician or an artist (as my father
did) because of the ugly racism that
permeates our society and keeps
Chicanos from contributing all the
beautiful thingß that we are capable of
contributing.
Throughout my activism, my ideas,
"affiliations" and visions have always
been very public. Too many of our
people's lives have rotted away in
gangs, drugs and prisons for me to be
any less than public in my pursuit of a
better tomorrow. I have been asked to
speak at the National Chicano Student
Conference, statewide MEChA confer
ences, Ivy League schools (no pun
intended), community events up and
down this state and even was one of
the keynote panelists of this year's You
Can Make a Difference conference.
It is also no secret that I have long
read and distributed Unity newspaper
on campus and in the community. I
have been part of Student Unity Net
work in this capacity and will never
back down from my association with
Unity newspaper or anyone who works
for or with the paper. I have asked my
friends and other people in the move
ment, including Delia, to be a part of
SUN activities and workshops because
I openly share my ideas.
This does not constitute "recruit
ment" into anything "secret," as Delia
Ibarra claims. And just like with
anyone else, when the lack of interest
was evident, I stopped inviting. I fail

to understand how this action could
constitute "marginalization" or harass
ment. I have learned a lot from the
body of knowledge known as Marxism
— from professors, fellow activists and,
yes, even members of the League — all
of which has not "manipulated" me or
turned me into a monster.
The hysteria that currently plagues
Stanford would never occur if we were
to discuss the "influence" of the Hoo
ver Institution, what goes on behind
the closed doors and "secret" meetings
of the Office of the President, the
"manipulation" of public opinion by
The Daily or the "hidden agenda" of
Residential Education.
But if you are talking about commu
nists or socialists, then hysteria and
paranoia is exactly what occurs. How
can I adequately address charges of
being a member of a "secretive cult"
which, among other things, "manip
ulates" people, "intimidates," planned
the takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office or forced
someone to resign? (Which must, of
course, all be true since it was printed
in The Daily.) I'm guilty from the
start.
To begin, I find it hard to believe
that Delia Ibarra and Richard Suh or
any other Stanford student can be
"manipulated" by myself or anyone
else. I, like anyone else (Ibarra and
Suh included), participated in the
movement and put my ideas to the
vote and democratic process put in

place by MEChA and the movement.
When decisions were reached by the
mtgority, I decided to put all my en
ergy into carrying those decisions out.
I and many others take personal re
sponsibility for our actions, regardless
of whether they are currently viewed
as popular or not.
I must, of course, plead guilty to the
heinous crime of "influencing" others
with my own opinion. That my ideas
were influential is also no secret, how
ever, and was probably the reason that
I was elected co-chair of MEChA. I
suspect that everyone is influenced
everyday by many ideas and opinions
and assume that most people compare
those ideas to their own particular
experience and decide for themselves
what to do — we are all adults.
Rather than look for a boogy man (or,
in this case, woman) to blame for their
own past actions, Ibarra and Suh
should take full responsibility for
whatever they may have chosen to do.
But having said all this, if I am to
be persecuted, maligned, degraded and
dehumanized for my "affiliations" or
"associations" then the claim that
Stanford University is a free market
place of ideas is a lie. I refuse to
answer the "are you now or have you
ever been" question, or more ac
curately the "we know you are and
just admit it" question. I stand on my
contributions, judge others by their
contributions and commitment and
expect to be judged by others in the

same manner — not by my alleged
"affiliations," memberships or ideologi
cal beliefs. The Daily, Richard Suh and
Delia Ibarra are undermining this most
precious idea more than I ever "secret
ly" could.
I am stronger than ever in my
commitment to the Chicano people. I
know that, as Gorbachev has written
in "Perestroika": "People, human
beings, with all their creative diversity,
are the makers of history," not sup
posed League members (or anyone
else) pulling people's strings or manip
ulating people behind the scenes.
Where there are concerns, injustice,
homelessness or hunger, there will be
protest to halt these atrocities in our
world. And I will be there to play an
active role in any way I can and I
know that most people will rise to the
occasion along with me and confront
the ills in society.
Finally, I would like to share a quote
from Paul Robeson, African-American
playwright, activist, singer, etc. who
was summoned before the House
Un-American Activities Committee
(HUAC) and during the McCarthy era:
"I am not being tried for whether I
am a communist, I am being tried for
fighting for the rights of my people
who are still second-class. You want to
shut up every black who has the
courage to stand up and fight for the
rights of his people."
