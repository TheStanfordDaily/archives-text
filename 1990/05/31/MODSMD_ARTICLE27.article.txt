# League members work for positive change on campus
## 
### 
In a series of somewhat sen
sationalist articles, The Daily has been
uncovering the role of the League for
Revolutionary Struggle on campus. In
principle I think that it is good to
bring this matter to the public atten
tion, but I would caution strongly on
the way it couches the debate. Certain
presumptions are present in the arti
cles that should at least be made ex
plicit.
As someone who had been involved
in activist campus politics a few years
ago but is by no means an expert on
leftist politics in this country, I would
first like to comment on the League
itself.
Four years ago it was common
knowledge in the activist community at
Stanford that there were students in
volved who were members of "revolu
tionary" parties and, in particular, the
League.
To the American mainstream the
name of this organization may imply a
very sinister objective, but the League
itself was certainly relatively moderate.
Indeed its members are often activists
in the Democratic party, and I don't
mean as infiltrators. The League was a
far cry from, for example, the Revolu
tionary Communist Party Youth
Brigades, whose members always tried

to disrupt peaceful demonstrations.
Indeed at Stanford the League mem
bers were against student sit-ins at
that time.
The fact that the League was work
ing in parallel with other groups, in
cluding the Democratic Party
mainstream, the Democratic Socialists
and the anarchists was viewed as being
perfectly natural and part of the demo
cratic process. What was disturbing to
me about the League was their more
secretive style of operation, and this
eventually turned many people off as
appearing "conspiratorial." It seemed
like glasnost was needed in the
League.
But regardless of what one might
think of their mode of operation, I
think one should be cautious and give
these young people the benefit of the
doubt.
As I see it there are at least two
dangers that The Daily articles present.
One is the attempt, conscious or not,
to distill one's character purely to the
fact that he or she belongs to an or
ganization.
Thus a person is presented as a
member of the League and somehow
that is supposed to say everything
about that person. Another assumption
made here is that this person is really
a lackey of someone else and is acting
under outside direction. Certainly that
cannot be assumed here.
The other danger that I see stems
from The Daily's cursory presentation
of the League itself. For example, the
League is said to be pushing for a

"revolution." (Ronald Reagan was also
trying to bring about a revolution in
this country.) An assumption is implic
it, again conscious or unconscious, that
such revolutions work against the
public good.
In that context the effect of the arti
cle is to marginalize, dismiss and dis
credit any such ideology without a
discussion of the real issues.
Thus the reader of the article is
made to assume that the motives of
these people are sinister and that they
are working against the general public.
The fact that the League operates
semi-secretly of course doesn't help
them, and maybe a League member
can explain why this is so.
I feel that the motives of these
young people were good, and ultimately
we should judge every individual by
their deeds and not by association to
any group. Most of the League people
went on to contribute to various
campus issues and beyond, such as the
multicultural agenda and the Webb
ranch.
"Witch hunts" on League members
and incriminating by association with
the League will not advance campus
debate and will not help anyone. So
let's go beyond that. Let us instead
judge people as individuals and debate
the real issues, including, if you will:
should an orgainization be secret and
why; and what kind of socialism, if
any, is appropriate?
