# Students should be concerned if groups misrepresented aims

### 
Some observations on the "League"
business of last week:
The cries of red-baiting from the
"victims" sound to me like overblown
posturing. Almost all of the many
protest letters have raised the grim
spectre of McCarthyism, but there are
differences between the very
serious events of the 1950s and the
tempest in a teapot we have here.
One is that being accused of being a
communist today causes an individual
little or no harm — communists are
not blacklisted, harassed, discriminated,
etc. Another is that the smear cam
paigns of the 1950s were often rooted
in vendettas and fabricated evidence.
In contrast, the reporter apparently
has no personal biases, has made a
genuine and diligent attempt to gather
information (it is unfortunate, though
understandable given the circum
stances, that he has had to rely so
heavily on unnamed sources and un
proved assertions), and none of the
individuals named (not "accused") have
been prevented from responding in a
way conducive to "enlightened discus
sion of the issues."
I don't think students or anyone else
care much whether these people are
communists or not — that issue is a
red herring. What students do care

about is whether organizations are
misrepresenting themselves.
Leyton states that "I was elected to
the Council of Presidents in spring of
1988 not because I duped or manip
ulated voters, but because people like
the platform that we put forward ..."
I seem to remember that things that
the COP did after its election, like
partcipate in the takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's office
takeover and allocate itself ASSU
funds for the event, had considerably
less campus support than the COP did
in its election.
For someone who describes the same
ASSU that recently generated more
recall signatures than votes as being a
"relevant and dynamic institution,"
maybe it's hard to tell.
Lastly, I find extremely disturbing
the statement by The Daily staff mem
bers of color to the effect that the
allegations are a direct attack on the
self-determination, integrity and long
struggle and sacrifice of student of
color groups. If there is anything that
stands between Stanford and a relevant
multicultural education, it is the insis
tence that some ideas and groups are
beyond criticism.
Whether outside groups are operat
ing through student of color organiza
tions is an entirely legitimate question;
the insistence should be that an in
quiry be based on fact and objectivity,
not things like whether they are made
with the consent of interested parties.
