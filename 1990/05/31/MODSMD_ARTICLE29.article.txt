# Daily articles on League have left many questions unanswered
## 
### 
I write as a confused and concerned
graduating senior and freshman dorm
Resident Assistant. I want to address
and question three groups, some of
whose members may overlap, regarding
the recent explosion of dialogue about
the League of Revolutionary Struggle.
To the Daily reporters, editors and
managers who were involved in the
three month investigation of the
League: My main question is this:
what is the story?
I and many of the frosh in my dorm
do not understand the League stories
or their implications. We want to know
what the issues are and why they are
important.
Part of your job is to not only print
the news but to frame it so that the
news is comprehensible to your
readers. Is the story that a secret
group exists at Stanford and some
student government leaders are part of
that group? If this is the story, how
does that affect our lives and the Uni
versity?
Is the story is that a group exists
that uses the politics of intimidation,
harassment and manipulation? If this

is the story, who is doing the in
timidating, harassing and manipulat
ing, and how are they doing it?
Are the same people you mentioned
in your article the intimidators? Is the
story that a group of elected student
leaders have secret agendas? If this is
the story, how do the agendas stated
by these individuals differ from their
"real" agendas? If any of these, or a
combination, is the story, could you
please explain to the best of your abil
ity the consequences of this story for
our lives as Stanford students.
To members of the communities of
color and all those who have supported
the recent progressive changes at Stan
ford: I ask you to please think about
which battles you want to fight. If
there is an organization that is using
harassment, intimidation and manipu
lation to make changes here, we should
work to change this situation.
Manipulation or intimidation is not
progress.
Perhaps The Daily "powers that be"
did not include staff members of color
in the investigation of the League
story, but there is a huge difference
between that and the statement that

I and many of the frosh in my dorm do not
understand the League stories or their implica
tions. We want to know what the issues are and
why they are important.

members of The Daily staff were not
told because they are students of color.
More research and discussion should go
on in The Daily in order to find out
the reality of the situation. (There may
have been good reason to let as few
people at The Daily as possible "in" on
the story, especially when one of the
multi-cultural editors was specifically
mentioned in the article.)
Obviously, the Daily politics are an
important issue to students of color
and to us all, but please don't allow
the story of the League to become the
story of politics at The Daily â€” they
are different.
To members of The League of
Revolutionary Struggle: Now we have
Daily articles, named and anonymous
sources, and University administrators

attesting to the existence of the
League, but the people who allegedly
know about or are in the group say
they know nothing.
The League, so the articles say, is an
organization with secret membership,
at least until now. With knowledge of
the organization now spreading, claims
of ignorance on the part of alleged
members comes across as defensive
ness.
It is time to explain your organiza
tion and why you have chosen, or
needed, to be invisible. Granted, it has
not been well received in this country
to label yourself a socialist or a Marx
ist.
However if the Daily investigation is
correct and the League has supported
or been partially responsible for the

recent changes at Stanford, then many
students will still be supportive, no
matter how you label yourself.
Of course, there are and will be stu
dents who fear and chastise someone
for socialist or Marxist leanings, but
these students have never supported
the changes at Stanford.
What I worry about is a huge back
lash from students who have always
supported the community of color or
ganizations and who voted for The
People's Platform. If open dialogue
does not begin immediately, these stu
dents may change their minds and
Stanford will move in a very different
way in the upcoming years.
Intelligent, concerned and progressive
students want to know what is fact
and what is fiction about The League
of Revolutionary Struggle, not because
we are McCarthyites but because we
want full knowledge when we vote and
decide in which direction Stanford will
move in the 19905.
Hopefully, in the upcoming days and
weeks, these pages will be a forum for
honest, thorough information.
