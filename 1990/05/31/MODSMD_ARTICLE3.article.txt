## Image, comments drive disorders

Editor's note: This is the second
in a series of three articles ex
amining eating disorders of Stan
ford students.

For five years, Maha Ibrahim
ate only one meal a day, cried
three times a day and threw up
once a week. The 5-foot-7-inch
Stanford student reduced her
calorie intake from 800 to 600 to
400 a day.
At the beginning of her sopho
more year, Ibrahim's weight had
dropped from 150 to 95 pounds,
and she was miserable.
Ibrahim's one meal was usually
breakfast. If she was going out
for dinner Friday night, Thurs
day's breakfast would be her last
meal before a 36-hour fast.
"I just couldn't stop thinking
about food, yet I couldn't let
myself eat," she says.
Although most Stanford vic
tims, the vast majority of whom
are women, are informed of the
high risk of eating disorders, they
cannot rationalize and control
their preoccupation with food.
"We cannot give one reason why
someone develops an eating dis
order," says Celia Moreno, coor
dinator of Counseling and
Psychological Services at Cowell
Student Health Center. "There are
often many reasons for each per
son."
Factors such as self-esteem,
image, control and comments
from men and families are often
the driving forces behind eating
disorders.
Ibrahim received little attention
when she was younger, so she
decided to attract it by losing
weight. She lost 28 pounds in one
summer. Classmates noticed and

complimented her, and from that
day on she linked being thin with
getting attention.
"So the rest of my life I have
focused on my weight and my
body because that is how I
thought people would love me,"
says Ibrahim.
Many students like Ibrahim
come to Moreno frustrated with
their lack of self-esteem.
"I have no confidence, no self
esteem," says Carol Freden, a
senior. Although Freden excels
academically and athletically, she
says she did not believe she mea
sured up physically. As a result,
she thought she did not deserve
to eat.
Pat Fabiano, director of the
Health Promotion Program at
Cowell, says women are not
taught to "look inside themselves,
but instead to live in a corner of
the room and watch themselves."
They need to start thinking of
their bodies as part of themselves
and stop thinking of them as
something want to build,
sculpt and reduce, she says.
Fabiano says many women as
sociate with the stereotypes ap
plied to females in the American
culture; she believes "women start
to act out through their body
tissue what the culture expects of
them."
When Ibrahim dropped to 95
pounds, one friend said, "Oh,
Maha, you are so thin. You look
so good." She thought society had

condemned her to 400 calories a
day for the rest of her life — and
she couldn't believe it.
"Linda," a senior, was 5 feet 4
inches and 140 pounds. Wanting
to fit America's "ideal," she went
on a Weight Watchers diet. But
when she reduced her weight to
125 pounds, she stopped
menstruating. Six months with
out menstruation can lead to bone
loss.
Despite her unseen medical
complications, Weight Watchers
supervisors were happy with
Linda's weight loss and said,
"That's great, that's what you
should be."
When Daphne Edwards, a soph
omore, began to cut out food
groups, her friends said, "Aren't
you getting a little bit thin?" How
ever, those who did not know her
well said, "Gee, Daphne, you al
ways look so good in clothes; I
am so jealous."
Often men's intentional and un
intentional comments and actions
toward women and their figures
contribute to women's obsession
with dieting.
"Tammy," a junior, noticed

both her freshman and sopho
more years that more men paid
attention to her at fraternity par
ties fall quarter than winter quar
ter — fall quarter she weighed 10
pounds less.
"Heather," a graduate student,
became a compulsive runner her
junior year after her boyfriend
said she would look better if she
lost five pounds. Heather runs on
campus and notices that when she
is thinner she receives many
whistles from men, but with extra
pounds she does not.
Junior Ellen Schur remembered
her freshman year when a bony
female passed some male dorm
mates and they commented on
what a good body the female had.
A gymnast most of her life, Schur
had a lot of muscle mass. How
ever, she began to lose weight
quickly so she, too, would have a
"good" body.
Edwards feared she was going
to weigh more than her boyfriend.
To avoid this, she was determined
to control her weight and became
anorexic.
"It is an amazing feeling of
power you get from [anorexia],"
Edwards says. "Any anorexic will
tell you that." Just cutting out
desserts made her feel stronger.
However, when Ibrahim, an
other anorexic, did not control her

appetite, she felt horrible about
her lack of control, horrible about
herself. If she ate an extra cookie,
she would throw it up in disgust.
According to Moreno and
Fabiano, a sense of control is one
of the main reasons students
begin eating disorders at Stan
ford.
Moreno says that while many
students were the best in many
areas in high school, they often
are not at the top at Stanford.
Feeling they have lost control
since they cannot manage to be
number one anymore, they at
tempt to regain it by controlling
their weight.
This obsession with proving
control drives people to think if
they can lose five pounds, they
can lose five more. Most eating
disorders begin when someone
wants to lose a few pounds but
gets caught up with the numbers
on the scale.
Family members, in addition to
the media and society, supplant
these visions of the "ideal in
people's heads.
Young women today are the
daughters of the Weight Watchers
generation — the first generation
to be raised by highly weight
conscious mothers. Many of these
women, in adolescence, felt their

mothers were critical of their own
developing bodies. Moreno says
these young women have a higher
risk of eating disorders.
Edwards' father used to com
ment on how nice his daughters
looked. When they were 8 or 9
years old, he started commenting
that her sister had better start
watching what she was eating be
cause she had a tendency to put
on weight; he told her to be care
ful because it was unattractive.
As a result, Edwards internalized
early that it was unattractive to
gain weight, she said.
Edwards' disorder started early
because she knew that as she went
through puberty, she would gain
weight, and her metabolism would
slow down. In anticipation, she
began to eat a lot less.
Tammy's mother continually
told her she would look prettier
if she lost 10 pounds. When
Tammy gained 20 pounds her
first quarter at Stanford, she was
terrified to go home to her moth
er.
One time Tammy asked her
mother if she loved her less when
she was heavier; her mother kept
silent.

Tomorrow: Admitting the problem
and getting treatment.

senior. Although Freden excels
academically and athletically, she
says she did not believe she mea
sured up physically. As a result,
she thought she did not deserve
to eat.
Pat Fabiano, director of the
Health Promotion Program at
Cowell, says women are not
taught to "look inside themselves,
but instead to live in a corner of
the room and watch themselves."
They need to start thinking of
their bodies as part of themselves
and stop thinking of them as
something want to build,
sculpt and reduce, she says.
Fabiano says many women as
sociate with the stereotypes ap
plied to females in the American
culture; she believes "women start
to act out through their body
tissue what the culture expects of
them."
When Ibrahim dropped to 95
pounds, one friend said, "Oh,
Maha, you are so thin. You look
so good." She thought society had

condemned her to 400 calories a
day for the rest of her life — and
she couldn't believe it.
"Linda," a senior, was 5 feet 4
inches and 140 pounds. Wanting
to fit America's "ideal," she went
on a Weight Watchers diet. But
when she reduced her weight to
125 pounds, she stopped
menstruating. Six months with
out menstruation can lead to bone
loss.
Despite her unseen medical
complications, Weight Watchers
supervisors were happy with
Linda's weight loss and said,
"That's great, that's what you
should be."
When Daphne Edwards, a soph
omore, began to cut out food
groups, her friends said, "Aren't
you getting a little bit thin?" How
ever, those who did not know her
well said, "Gee, Daphne, you al
ways look so good in clothes; I
am so jealous."
Often men's intentional and un
intentional comments and actions
toward women and their figures
contribute to women's obsession
with dieting.
"Tammy," a junior, noticed

both her freshman and sopho
more years that more men paid
attention to her at fraternity par
ties fall quarter than winter quar
ter — fall quarter she weighed 10
pounds less.
"Heather," a graduate student,
became a compulsive runner her
junior year after her boyfriend
said she would look better if she
lost five pounds. Heather runs on
campus and notices that when she
is thinner she receives many
whistles from men, but with extra
pounds she does not.
Junior Ellen Schur remembered
her freshman year when a bony
female passed some male dorm
mates and they commented on
what a good body the female had.
A gymnast most of her life, Schur
had a lot of muscle mass. How
ever, she began to lose weight
quickly so she, too, would have a
"good" body.
Edwards feared she was going
to weigh more than her boyfriend.
To avoid this, she was determined
to control her weight and became
anorexic.
"It is an amazing feeling of
power you get from [anorexia],"
Edwards says. "Any anorexic will
tell you that." Just cutting out
desserts made her feel stronger.
However, when Ibrahim, an
other anorexic, did not control her

appetite, she felt horrible about
her lack of control, horrible about
herself. If she ate an extra cookie,
she would throw it up in disgust.
According to Moreno and
Fabiano, a sense of control is one
of the main reasons students
begin eating disorders at Stan
ford.
Moreno says that while many
students were the best in many
areas in high school, they often
are not at the top at Stanford.
Feeling they have lost control
since they cannot manage to be
number one anymore, they at
tempt to regain it by controlling
their weight.
This obsession with proving
control drives people to think if
they can lose five pounds, they
can lose five more. Most eating
disorders begin when someone
wants to lose a few pounds but
gets caught up with the numbers
on the scale.
Family members, in addition to
the media and society, supplant
these visions of the "ideal in
people's heads.
Young women today are the
daughters of the Weight Watchers
generation — the first generation
to be raised by highly weight
conscious mothers. Many of these
women, in adolescence, felt their

mothers were critical of their own
developing bodies. Moreno says
these young women have a higher
risk of eating disorders.
Edwards' father used to com
ment on how nice his daughters
looked. When they were 8 or 9
years old, he started commenting
that her sister had better start
watching what she was eating be
cause she had a tendency to put
on weight; he told her to be care
ful because it was unattractive.
As a result, Edwards internalized
early that it was unattractive to
gain weight, she said.
Edwards' disorder started early
because she knew that as she went
through puberty, she would gain
weight, and her metabolism would
slow down. In anticipation, she
began to eat a lot less.
Tammy's mother continually
told her she would look prettier
if she lost 10 pounds. When
Tammy gained 20 pounds her
first quarter at Stanford, she was
terrified to go home to her moth
er.
One time Tammy asked her
mother if she loved her less when
she was heavier; her mother kept
silent.

and getting treatment.

For five years, Maha Ibrahim
ate only one meal a day, cried
three times a day and threw up
once a week. The 5-foot-7-inch
Stanford student reduced her
calorie intake from 800 to 600 to
400 a day.
At the beginning of her sopho
more year, Ibrahim's weight had
dropped from 150 to 95 pounds,
and she was miserable.
Ibrahim's one meal was usually
breakfast. If she was going out
for dinner Friday night, Thurs
day's breakfast would be her last
meal before a 36-hour fast.
"I just couldn't stop thinking
about food, yet I couldn't let
myself eat," she says.
Although most Stanford vic
tims, the vast majority of whom
are women, are informed of the
high risk of eating disorders, they
cannot rationalize and control
their preoccupation with food.
"We cannot give one reason why
someone develops an eating dis
order," says Celia Moreno, coor
dinator of Counseling and
Psychological Services at Cowell
Student Health Center. "There are
often many reasons for each per
son."
Factors such as self-esteem,
image, control and comments
from men and families are often
the driving forces behind eating
disorders.
Ibrahim received little attention
when she was younger, so she
decided to attract it by losing
weight. She lost 28 pounds in one
summer. Classmates noticed and

complimented her, and from that
day on she linked being thin with
getting attention.
"So the rest of my life I have
focused on my weight and my
body because that is how I
thought people would love me,"
says Ibrahim.
Many students like Ibrahim
come to Moreno frustrated with
their lack of self-esteem.
