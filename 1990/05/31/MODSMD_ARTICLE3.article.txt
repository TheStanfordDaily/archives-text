Editor's note: This is the second
in a series of three articles ex
amining eating disorders of Stan
ford students.

For five years, Maha Ibrahim
ate only one meal a day, cried
three times a day and threw up
once a week. The 5-foot-7-inch
Stanford student reduced her
calorie intake from 800 to 600 to
400 a day.
At the beginning of her sopho
more year, Ibrahim's weight had
dropped from 150 to 95 pounds,
and she was miserable.
Ibrahim's one meal was usually
breakfast. If she was going out
for dinner Friday night, Thurs
day's breakfast would be her last
meal before a 36-hour fast.
"I just couldn't stop thinking
about food, yet I couldn't let
myself eat," she says.
Although most Stanford vic
tims, the vast majority of whom
are women, are informed of the
high risk of eating disorders, they
cannot rationalize and control
their preoccupation with food.
"We cannot give one reason why
someone develops an eating dis
order," says Celia Moreno, coor
dinator of Counseling and
Psychological Services at Cowell
Student Health Center. "There are
often many reasons for each per
son."
Factors such as self-esteem,
image, control and comments
from men and families are often
the driving forces behind eating
disorders.
Ibrahim received little attention
when she was younger, so she
decided to attract it by losing
weight. She lost 28 pounds in one
summer. Classmates noticed and

complimented her, and from that
day on she linked being thin with
getting attention.
"So the rest of my life I have
focused on my weight and my
body because that is how I
thought people would love me,"
says Ibrahim.
Many students like Ibrahim
come to Moreno frustrated with
their lack of self-esteem.
"I have no confidence, no self
esteem," says Carol Freden, a
senior. Although Freden excels
academically and athletically, she
says she did not believe she mea
sured up physically. As a result,
she thought she did not deserve
to eat.
Pat Fabiano, director of the
Health Promotion Program at
Cowell, says women are not
taught to "look inside themselves,
but instead to live in a corner of
the room and watch themselves."
They need to start thinking of
their bodies as part of themselves
and stop thinking of them as
something want to build,
sculpt and reduce, she says.
Fabiano says many women as
sociate with the stereotypes ap
plied to females in the American
culture; she believes "women start
to act out through their body
tissue what the culture expects of
them."
When Ibrahim dropped to 95
pounds, one friend said, "Oh,
Maha, you are so thin. You look
so good." She thought society had
