## What kind of CWS lineup is this? 
### 
Y'know, something about
the teams in the College
World Series just doesn't
make a heck of a lot of sense.
I mean, check these guys out:
First, you've got Georgia South
ern (isn't that redundant?
Never mind). How does a team
seeded fifth in its region get to
Omaha?
Or The Citadel. All the Bull
dogs did last weekend was beat
Miami twice at Miami, which
happens about as often as sleet
in Tahiti. That's not what really
bothers me, though: Tell me,
why "The" Citadel? Sure, it's a
military institution, and they
tend to march to their own beat,
but you don't ever hear about
the The Army-The Navy game.
Why not? Well, because it would
be stupid.

Wouldn't it be great if Stan
ford met up with these guys in
the title game? The Cardinal vs.
The Citadel for The national
title at The Rosenblatt Stadium
in The State of Nebraska on
The CBS TV Network in The
month of June.
And then there's Cal State-
Fullerton. No, not Fullerton
State, which would seem to
make sense. The folks down in
Fullerton are actually pretty
anal about this — they insist
that they be called C.S.-
Fullerton.
Regardless of their fetish for
inverse word order, though,
we're left with the fact that the
Titans beat Texas, at Texas,
twice to advance to the CWS.
And as if the school names
aren't bad enough, there are
three CWS teams — Georgia,
Mississippi State and The The
— whose mascots are Bulldogs,
which is gonna make things real
interesting (Bulldogs and Bull
dogs and Bulldogs, oh my!).
Is there a pattern here?
(Besides some definite problems
with names, that is.) Apparently
so: The Citadel, Georgia South
ern and Cal State-Fullerton
weren't given a Fighting Camel's
chance of winning their
regionals, but they all took out
teams ranked in the top eight
to get to Omaha. In fact, let's
take a look at the "best" teams
in the country, as determined
by the all-knowing Collegiate
Baseball poll.
No. 1 Stanford: No problem.
No. 2 Arizona State: Lost
twice at home to No. 9 Okla
homa State. Have a nice sum
mer, Devils.
No. 3 Florida State: Lost

twice to Mississippi State, but
the Seminoles at least had the
excuse of being on the road at
MSU.
No. 4 Miami: Lost twice to
The Citadel, which may have
been The upset of The tourna
ment (all right, I'll knock it off).
No. 5 Texas: Twice-lost to Cal
State-Fullerton home-at.
No. 6 LSU: Beat No. 7 USC
two out of three at home. The
Tigers are the only top-seeded
team besides Stanford to win a
regional.
No. 8 Arkansas: Lost their
first two games and went home.
The last top seed was North
Carolina, and the Tar Heels
didn't even make it to their re
gional championship.
We're left with several
theories here: (a) All these really
weren't that good, shouldn't
have been ranked that high, and
deserve to be watching the CWS
on ESPN; (b) There were a
whole lot o' upsets this weekend;
or (c) baseball is just a crazy
game.
Personally, I like choice (c),
which is known in cliche circles
as the "on any given day" the
ory. It's not that simple, how
ever. There's another reason the
favorites didn't do so well last
week, and it seems to explain
everything quite well:
It's the NCAA's fault.
This theory isn't anything
new, but hoo boy, does it
work well. Drugs in college foot
ball? Blame the NCAA. Student
athletes who can't read? Blame
the NCAA. Student football
seats that are in Guatemala?
Blame the Athletic Department.
Cheerleaders? Blame the NCAA.
(And please, just say no.)
In this case, blaming the
NCAA actually makes sense, be
cause they're the guano-heads
who set up the regional format.
In case you didn't check out the
regional at Sunken Diamond
(like you really had something
better to do!) the playoffs work
something like this:
Six teams play a semi-round
robin double-elimination tour
nament over the course of four
days. As soon as five teams have
two losses, the winner packs his
bags and hops on the next bus
for Nebraska.
That's no problem. Baseball
clearly shouldn't be a one-loss
and-out sport, so double
elimination makes perfect sense.
The problem is the "over four
days" part of the deal, which
means if you lose one game early
you're in unbelievably deep
doggy-doo.
The reason the manure runs
high after one loss is that a
team who loses faces the
prospect of having to play two
straight doubleheaders to win
the region. How many times
during the regular season do col
lege teams play twinbills? Rare
ly.

So what's the problem, you
ask? Well, let's take Stanford as
an example. After winning two
games last weekend, the Cardi
nal faced San Diego State on
Saturday morning. The winner
— which turned out to be Stan
ford — got the rest of the day
off and waited for the remaining
teams to pound on each other
to see who would get the chance
to play in the title game.
The losers got the pleasure of
coming back three hours after
the loss to play a must-win
game.
Now, that wouldn't be so hard
(yeah, right) if it weren't for the
tiny problem of pitching. L T nless
a coach wants his best pitchers
to throw on zero days' rest, he's
going to have to dig waaaaay
deep into his bullpen to get
starters for the four-games-in
-34-hours stretch. How many
teams have four decent starters?
Not Miami. Not ASU. Nor
Texas. Once they got that one
loss, they were pretty much
screwed. If Stanford had lost
that Saturday morning game,
the Cardinal would have had to
play again at 4:00 p.m., again
the next day (sans rain) at noon,
and then again at 4:00 p.m. to
make it to the CWS.
How important was that
game? Look at it this way: Sup
pose the Cardinal had lost. Stan
Spencer had pitched that game,
which meant he wouldn't ex
actly have been able to pitch
again that day or the next. Mike
Mussina? He'd pitched on Fri
day, which meant that at best
he'd have been able to throw a
few innings Sunday. John Reid?
He'd had one day's rest.
Who do you get to pitch Sat
urday afternoon? And then, as
suming the Cardinal wins that
game, who pitches on Sunday
after Mussina puts in the five
or six innings he can handle
before his arm falls off?
The bottom line is that a team
that loses once (before the final
day, that is) is going to need a
whole lot of great arms to win
the regional. Does this really de
termine who has the better
team? No. The team that wins
that Saturday game has an un
believable advantage, which
means the double-elimination
format — which I guess was
put in because of the "on any
given day" factor — hurts every
team but one.
The solution? Make it five
days long. Or six.
Don't even say classwork
would suffer: Yes, we're still
working, but how many other
universities have classes after
Memorial Day?
I'm not complaining this year:
No Miami, no Texas, no Florida
State and no ASU means the
Cardinal is looking fairly good
heading into Omaha.
If the Cardinal loses once in
the regionals next year, though,
I'll gripe for weeks.

few innings Sunday. John Reid?
He'd had one day's rest.
Who do you get to pitch Sat
urday afternoon? And then, as
suming the Cardinal wins that
game, who pitches on Sunday
after Mussina puts in the five
or six innings he can handle
before his arm falls off?
The bottom line is that a team
that loses once (before the final
day, that is) is going to need a
whole lot of great arms to win
the regional. Does this really de
termine who has the better
team? No. The team that wins
that Saturday game has an un
believable advantage, which
means the double-elimination
format — which I guess was
put in because of the "on any
given day" factor — hurts every
team but one.
The solution? Make it five
days long. Or six.
Don't even say classwork
would suffer: Yes, we're still
working, but how many other
universities have classes after
Memorial Day?
I'm not complaining this year:
No Miami, no Texas, no Florida
State and no ASU means the
Cardinal is looking fairly good
heading into Omaha.
If the Cardinal loses once in
the regionals next year, though,
I'll gripe for weeks.

Y'know, something about
the teams in the College
World Series just doesn't
make a heck of a lot of sense.
I mean, check these guys out:
First, you've got Georgia South
ern (isn't that redundant?
Never mind). How does a team
seeded fifth in its region get to
Omaha?
Or The Citadel. All the Bull
dogs did last weekend was beat
Miami twice at Miami, which
happens about as often as sleet
in Tahiti. That's not what really
bothers me, though: Tell me,
why "The" Citadel? Sure, it's a
military institution, and they
tend to march to their own beat,
but you don't ever hear about
the The Army-The Navy game.
Why not? Well, because it would
be stupid.

Wouldn't it be great if Stan
ford met up with these guys in
the title game? The Cardinal vs.
The Citadel for The national
title at The Rosenblatt Stadium
in The State of Nebraska on
The CBS TV Network in The
month of June.
And then there's Cal State-
Fullerton. No, not Fullerton
State, which would seem to
make sense. The folks down in
Fullerton are actually pretty
anal about this — they insist
that they be called C.S.-
Fullerton.
Regardless of their fetish for
inverse word order, though,
we're left with the fact that the
Titans beat Texas, at Texas,
twice to advance to the CWS.
And as if the school names
aren't bad enough, there are
three CWS teams — Georgia,
Mississippi State and The The
— whose mascots are Bulldogs,
which is gonna make things real
interesting (Bulldogs and Bull
dogs and Bulldogs, oh my!).
Is there a pattern here?
(Besides some definite problems
with names, that is.) Apparently
so: The Citadel, Georgia South
ern and Cal State-Fullerton
weren't given a Fighting Camel's
chance of winning their
regionals, but they all took out
teams ranked in the top eight
to get to Omaha. In fact, let's
take a look at the "best" teams
in the country, as determined
by the all-knowing Collegiate
Baseball poll.
No. 1 Stanford: No problem.
No. 2 Arizona State: Lost
twice at home to No. 9 Okla
homa State. Have a nice sum
mer, Devils.
No. 3 Florida State: Lost

twice to Mississippi State, but
the Seminoles at least had the
excuse of being on the road at
MSU.
No. 4 Miami: Lost twice to
The Citadel, which may have
been The upset of The tourna
ment (all right, I'll knock it off).
No. 5 Texas: Twice-lost to Cal
State-Fullerton home-at.
No. 6 LSU: Beat No. 7 USC
two out of three at home. The
Tigers are the only top-seeded
team besides Stanford to win a
regional.
No. 8 Arkansas: Lost their
first two games and went home.
The last top seed was North
Carolina, and the Tar Heels
didn't even make it to their re
gional championship.
We're left with several
theories here: (a) All these really
weren't that good, shouldn't
have been ranked that high, and
deserve to be watching the CWS
on ESPN; (b) There were a
whole lot o' upsets this weekend;
or (c) baseball is just a crazy
game.
Personally, I like choice (c),
which is known in cliche circles
as the "on any given day" the
ory. It's not that simple, how
ever. There's another reason the
favorites didn't do so well last
week, and it seems to explain
everything quite well:
It's the NCAA's fault.
This theory isn't anything
new, but hoo boy, does it
work well. Drugs in college foot
ball? Blame the NCAA. Student
athletes who can't read? Blame
the NCAA. Student football
seats that are in Guatemala?
Blame the Athletic Department.
Cheerleaders? Blame the NCAA.
(And please, just say no.)
In this case, blaming the
NCAA actually makes sense, be
cause they're the guano-heads
who set up the regional format.
In case you didn't check out the
regional at Sunken Diamond
(like you really had something
better to do!) the playoffs work
something like this:
Six teams play a semi-round
robin double-elimination tour
nament over the course of four
days. As soon as five teams have
two losses, the winner packs his
bags and hops on the next bus
for Nebraska.
That's no problem. Baseball
clearly shouldn't be a one-loss
and-out sport, so double
elimination makes perfect sense.
The problem is the "over four
days" part of the deal, which
means if you lose one game early
you're in unbelievably deep
doggy-doo.
The reason the manure runs
high after one loss is that a
team who loses faces the
prospect of having to play two
straight doubleheaders to win
the region. How many times
during the regular season do col
lege teams play twinbills? Rare
ly.

So what's the problem, you
ask? Well, let's take Stanford as
an example. After winning two
games last weekend, the Cardi
nal faced San Diego State on
Saturday morning. The winner
— which turned out to be Stan
ford — got the rest of the day
off and waited for the remaining
teams to pound on each other
to see who would get the chance
to play in the title game.
The losers got the pleasure of
coming back three hours after
the loss to play a must-win
game.
Now, that wouldn't be so hard
(yeah, right) if it weren't for the
tiny problem of pitching. L T nless
a coach wants his best pitchers
to throw on zero days' rest, he's
going to have to dig waaaaay
deep into his bullpen to get
starters for the four-games-in
-34-hours stretch. How many
teams have four decent starters?
Not Miami. Not ASU. Nor
Texas. Once they got that one
loss, they were pretty much
screwed. If Stanford had lost
that Saturday morning game,
the Cardinal would have had to
play again at 4:00 p.m., again
the next day (sans rain) at noon,
and then again at 4:00 p.m. to
make it to the CWS.
How important was that
game? Look at it this way: Sup
pose the Cardinal had lost. Stan
Spencer had pitched that game,
which meant he wouldn't ex
actly have been able to pitch
again that day or the next. Mike
Mussina? He'd pitched on Fri
day, which meant that at best
he'd have been able to throw a
few innings Sunday. John Reid?
He'd had one day's rest.
Who do you get to pitch Sat
urday afternoon? And then, as
suming the Cardinal wins that
