# Stanford competitors open NCAAs with lifetime best performances
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Despite the loss of perhaps its
top competitor, the Stanford track
and field team is doing just fine,
thank you very much, at the
NCAA Championships.
With star sprinter Chryste
Gaines bypassing the NCAA meet
to compete for the U.S. in an
international competition early
next week, the Cardinal only sent
five athletes to Durham, N.C., for
NCAAs. But if the first day of
the meet is any indication, those
five are prepared to overacheive.
The meet began yesterday at
Duke University, and the only two
Stanford athletes competing,
Dave Strang and Peggy Odita,
both opened the meet with
lifetime bests.

"They're both in position to be
All-Americans," Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson said. "They're
both doing exactly what we've
asked of them all year long — to
compete at a national-caliber
level. We're getting everything out
of them that we could hope for."
Strang was a late entry in the
800 meters as he just missed the
automatic qualifying standard for
the meet. But since fewer people
than expected met the mark, he
was allowed to compete and he is
making the best of it. Strang ran
a lifetime best 1:46.90 in the first
heat of qualifying, good for third
place.
No one in any of the other heats
ran as fast and Strang will be one
of the eight men competing for
the NCAA title in that event when
the finals are held tomorrow.
Odita also started off very
strong in her specialty, the hep
tathlon, running a season-best
14.51 in the 100-meter hurdles.
She then came up with another
lifetime best, high jumping 5 feet,
9 1/4 inches.
She recorded a toss of 36-5 in
the shot put and finished the day
with a season-best time of 25.88
in the 200 meters. Her one-day
total of 3,245 places her in eighth,
342 points behind the leader, Ar
izona State's Gea Johnson.
"She's on a p. r. (personal

record) pace," Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson said. "She should
do about a 5,600 if she has a good
day. ... She should move up to
sixth with an average day, third
or fourth with a good day."
Odita will finish the heptathlon
today while three other Cardinal
athletes will compete in prelimi
naries. Brain Boggess will com-

pete in the trials in the shot put
while Bill Crowley and Eric Mas
talir will run in the prelims of
the 1,500 meters.
Strang will run in the finals of
the 800 meters Friday while
Boggess, Crowley and Mastalir
will compete in the finals of their
respective events Saturday if they
qualify for the finals.
