# Card athletes share with local kids
## Volunteers for Youth provides means to have fun, give to community 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
There's more to life at The Farm
than school and sports.
This is the concept behind Volunteers
For Youth, a student-run program which
gives kids from various local elementary
and junior high schools the opportunity
to spend a few hours a week with a
Stanford student-athlete.
"Stanford athletes are kept extremely
busy between academics and athletics,"
co-director and tennis team member
Valerie Wilson said, "but many people
are still looking for something else."
Volunteers For Youth provides that
something else. Founded on the Farm
in 1969, the organization has spread to
over 50 universities across the country,
including Colorado, Duke, and much of
the Ivy League. Although the program
suffered a miyor blow nationally when
the NCAA withdrew its financial sup
port in 1988, VFY has remained strong
at Stanford.
One of the reasons for the organiza
tion's success here is that Stanford ath
letes ei\joy the experience as much as
the children do.
"What I like most about the program
is the opportunity to play and to do
fun stuff with my little," field hockey
player Caroline Clevenger said. "It
forces me to do things that I would
enjoy doing anyway."
"Littles" are children ages nine to 14
who are recommended to the program
by Hillview Middle School, Escondido
Lower School, and the Stanbridge Acad
emy. As opposed to most programs,
which focus on poor children, VFY ac
cepts children regardless of their socio
economic status.
"Poor people aren't the only ones who
can use the help we offer," Wilson said.
"Upper- and middle-class kids can gain

'Whether they're too
smart for their class or
they're not seeing their
parents or
whatever... we try to help
our littles with any social
adjustment that they're
unable to deal with.'

as well.
"Whether they're too smart for their
class or they're not seeing their parents
or whatever. . . we try to help our littles
with any social adjustment that they're
unable to deal with."
Although having a "big" can help a
child with many of his or her problems,
Wilson emphasizes that VFY members
do not serve as psychologists. "My job
is not to psychoanalyze my little," she
said. "All we do is try to have a good
time together."
The most popular activities include
trips to Great America, studying to
gether, bowling, movies, and sporting
events. However, anything involving
spending time together is a thrill for
the little.
"The littles are really interested in
anything that they do with their big,"
Wilson said. "That is part of the reason
that all bigs are athletes. Not only can
a little say that his or her friend is a
college student, but that he or she is a
star on a team as well. Littles are in
awe of the fact that their big is a college
athlete."
Aside from being a member of a var

sity or club team, the only other re
quirement for joining VFY is a
commitment of a few hours a week.
"For the time you put into the program,
you get a tremendous amount out of
it," swimmer Bill Merkle said. "Al
though the program's initial purpose
was simply to help out kids with low
self-esteem, it's really more than that .
.. you really develop a mutual friendship
as time goes by."
The friendship often extends beyond
the big's Stanford career. Although the
program no longer guides the contact
between the Stanford student-athlete
and his or her little, continuation of
the relationship is encouraged and often
takes place.
"I hope I can keep in touch with my
little in future years," tennis standout
Debbie Graham said. I'm really looking
forward to seeing what she's doing in
five or six years from now."
However, even if the friendship ends
upon the big's graduation, the benefits
that it yields for the little are im
measurable. "Programs like VFY are
ideal for junior high school students,"
child psychologist George Shepherd said,
"because it is a time when youths are
finding themselves socially, emotionally,
physically, and mentally and when good
role models can be very important."
Good role models must abound at
Stanford, as over 60 students participate
in the program. "The program is so
popular because it is a way that athletes
at Stanford can give something back to
the community without an enormous
time commitment," Wilson said. "The
rewards of knowing that you have made
a child's day are well worth it."
Thanks to the efforts of a few dozen
Stanford students, Volunteers For
Youth has been able to make a lot of
children's days.

program no longer guides the contact
between the Stanford student-athlete
and his or her little, continuation of
the relationship is encouraged and often
takes place.
"I hope I can keep in touch with my
little in future years," tennis standout
Debbie Graham said. I'm really looking
forward to seeing what she's doing in
five or six years from now."
However, even if the friendship ends
upon the big's graduation, the benefits
that it yields for the little are im
measurable. "Programs like VFY are
ideal for junior high school students,"
child psychologist George Shepherd said,
"because it is a time when youths are
finding themselves socially, emotionally,
physically, and mentally and when good
role models can be very important."
Good role models must abound at
Stanford, as over 60 students participate
in the program. "The program is so
popular because it is a way that athletes
at Stanford can give something back to
the community without an enormous
time commitment," Wilson said. "The
rewards of knowing that you have made
a child's day are well worth it."
Thanks to the efforts of a few dozen
Stanford students, Volunteers For
Youth has been able to make a lot of
children's days.
