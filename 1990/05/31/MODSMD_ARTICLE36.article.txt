# Two sophomores already had their moment in the sun with Gorbachev
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Today, many Stanford students
are poring anxiously over pages
6, 7 and 8 of The Daily, looking
for their names on the list of 4,050
students who will have a chance
to see Mikhail and Raisa Gorba
chev on Monday.
It's a good thing Bob Sternfels
and Emily Simas already got their
chance.
The two sophomores, whose
names do not appear on the ran
domly selected list, met the Soviet
president and his wife in Decem
ber 1987 at the Soviet embassy
in Washington, D.C.
Simas recalled that Gorbachev
was congenial, sincere and char
ismatic during the half-hour
meeting with 12 high school and
three college students. "He was
genuinely interested in what we
had to say," she said.
During that trip, Gorbachev
met with only one other small
group of people — business
leaders — for 20 minutes.
"He talked to us about the im
portance of youth communica
tion," Sternfels said. "He felt that
in order to break down notions
about 'them' vs. 'us,' you have to
meet 'them.' "
At the time, Simas was presi
dent of the California Association

Gorbachev 'felt
that in order to
break down no
tions about 'them'
vs. 'us,' you have
to meet 'them.''

of Student Councils, and Sternfels
was head of the association's gov
ernmental affairs committee. Dur
ing a summer leadership training
camp for high school students held
at Stanford, they produced a
videotape inviting Gorbachev to
come to California.
When the West Coast leg of his
1987 tour was canceled, the pair
flew to Washington to meet with
him before the summit's closing
press conference.
"Even though it was through
an interpreter, I could tell why
this man is such an effective
leader," Sternfels said.
"Raisa also was very charisma
tic," Simas said. "She made sure
that the students were the ones
being talked to," rather than
members of the press who were
covering the summit.
The visit to Stanford "rein

forces that he does believe in
young people and sees power in
the young, and that the meeting
with us in 1987 was not just a
piece of propaganda," said
Sternfels. "He's not going to Hoo
ver — he wants to see students."
Both Simas and Sternfels hoped
Gorbachev would address issues
of education while at Stanford. "I
would be interested in hearing
what he has to say about the
American educational system and
the Soviet system ... and im
provements he would like to see
for both," Simas said.
The 1987 meeting spurred nu
merous efforts to further commu
nication between U.S. and Soviet
youth. Simas and Sternfels were
instrumental in getting both the
California legislature and the U.S.
Congress to endorse educational
exchanges between the two na
tions in 1988.
In addition, a youth summit
was held in Helsinki with students
from the United States, the Soviet
Union and Finland. Proposals
written at that conference, ad
dressing issues such as the
environment and nuclear war,
were presented in Moscow, at the
United Nations in New York and
to former President Reagan in
Washington.
Simas added, "It's nice to see
he finally got to the West Coast."
