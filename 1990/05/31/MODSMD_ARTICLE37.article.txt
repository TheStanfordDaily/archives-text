# Students to share culture, insights in Chinatown
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Combining public service, inter
action with "high-risk" children
and the breaking down of cultural
barriers with the stroke of a pen
sounds like an impossible task.
However, senior Grace Chin in
tends to accomplish her goals in
one enormous creative blow.
This summer, she will gain and
share cultural insights with
Asian-American children in San
Francisco's Chinatown while
teaching them writing skills.
Chin, an English mtyor with a
creative writing emphasis, is one
of 12 summer fellows selected by
the Humanities Center. For the
first time in Stanford history, hu
manities students will have the
opportunity to participate in a

summer fellowship through the
Arts and Humanities Summer
Fellows program. The $1,500
grant provided to each fellow will
enable students to practice art
while performing public service.
Chin will work in conjunction
with the Chinatown Youth Center.
"The kids will concentrate on
writing about their experiences of
being an Asian-American and
growing up in a very special en
vironment," Chin explains.
Chinatown holds one of the high
est concentrations of Asian-
Americans in the United States.
"Chinatown is so unique in that
the community has retained so
much of the Asian culture, but at
the same time it retains the West
ern culture. This makes the ten
sion the kids feel almost
stronger."

The children, Chin says, "are
what some people call 'high risk' "
and range from 15 to 19 years of
age. Some will participate in the
summer program through the rec
ommendation of the juvenile court
system or through the recommen
dation of local high schools. Some
of the teenagers will be high
school dropouts and from broken
families. The Chinatown Youth
Center is coordinating the selec
tion process.
The teenagers will meet with
Chin in two separate groups of
eight, for 10 hours a week. Dis
cussion will dominate a mfigor part
of her curriculum; students will
also read works by Asian-
American writers and watch
videotapes.
Chin plans to have the

teenagers interview family and
community members in
Chinatown. "Hopefully, the proc
ess may even settle troubled re
lations in a family. Through the
interviews, the teenagers may be
able to understand their parents
better, and the parents will benefit
from being able to relate to their
kids."
The teenagers will then write
and publish two newsletters about
issues of concern in their commu
nity. Chin hopes the newsletters,
too, will remedy strained family
relationships.
"The newsletters will give the
kids a forum. They can reach out
in their work to their parents."
Chin also plans to publish a sep
arate collection of their creative
work.
