# Others in Bay Area reduce water usage
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
While Stanford awaits the June
17 commencement to officially
reduce its water consumption,
other communities around the
Bay Area are imposing harsh
rationing plans that include fi
nancial incentives for
homeowners and businesses to
reduce water usage.
"The drought is a very big
deal," said Debra Katz, program
coordinator for Palo Alto Water
Utilities. "We're on the verge of
a crisis situation. This is the
fourth year standing of the
drought, and no one can predict
when it will end."
The city of Palo Alto is urging
residents to reduce their indoor
water usage by 15 percent and
outdoor usage by 50 percent from
1987 pre-drought levels, said
Katz.
Residents who do not comply
with a standard 27 percent reduc
tion will be penalized with higher
rates and possibly contacted by
the city as part of a public out
reach program.
The harshest penalty for repeat
offenders involves a shut-off of
water service. In addition, certain
practices such as watering out
doors during midday and watering
down the sidewalk are prohibited.
San Francisco's Public Utilities
Commission has ruled that all of
its serviced communities must
reduce their water usage by more
than 25 percent or pay up to 10
times the rate on the additional
water, setting cities scrambling to
design plans to avoid the
penalties.
"I don't know what Stanford
has up its sleeve," said Katz.
However, Stanford officials say
the University complies with cur
rent water restrictions and will
reduce usage before the Public
Utilities Commission's financial
penalties take effect July 20.

During the past nine months,
Stanford has eased its water re
strictions because water authori
ties reduced the rationing level to
a recommended 15 percent. Con
sequently, Stanford has been ir
rigating and watering at only
slightly reduced levels, and most
of Stanford's fountains have been
operating since September, ac
cording to Cheryl Jensen, water
manager for Operations and
Maintainance.
Immediately following com
mencement weekend, Operations
and Maintainance plans to shut
off the "decorative" fountains,
reduce the frequency of irrigation
and use lake water rather than
fresh water whenever possible,
said David Kaye, utilities manager
at Operations and Maintainance.
"As of now, we appear to be
doing OK (regarding the neces
sary reduction)," Kaye said.
"What I plan to do is monitor the
situation and possibly change our
plans if I see us getting into trou
ble."
Kaye said Stanford has not
launched a massive public rela
tions campaign similar to Palo
Alto's to persuade people to cut
water usage.
"I doubt if there's anyone in
the Stanford community that
doesn't know there's a drought
situation going on in Northern
California," said Kaye.
At Stanford, "we have only a
limited ability to take positive
measures. . . . We're not Big
Brother," Jensen said.
