Gorby closes curtain
on Sunday Flicks
Leave it to Gorby to steal
the show. Literally.
The paper wads won't be
flying this Sunday in Memorial
Auditorium unless Secret Serv
ice agents get bored. The Sun
day Flicks, which was to
present the movie "Always"
this weekend, will not be
showing its film this Sunday
because of the visit of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev
to the auditorium the next day.
Instead, the Flicks will hold
a double-feature Monday night.
Students may see both "Al
ways," which will be shown at
7 p.m., and "This is Spinal
Tap," which will air at 9:30
p.m. "This is Spinal Tap" was
to be shown Monday night
before Gorbachev announced
his plans to spoil the show.
Plans underway for
health Conference
"Health Care and Poverty"
will serve as the topic for next
year's You Can Make A Differ
ence Conference, which will
take place Jan. 24 through Jan.
26.
More than 25 students are
presently involved in the con
ference planning. Junior
Waseem Noor will act as one
of the four conference direc
tors. He stresses the impor
tance of health care and
poverty: "The issues of the con
ference are extremely pressing.
They are opening the way to
the new century."
The conference will explore
topics such as doctors and eth
ics, sex education issues, nutri
tion and AIDS. Potential
speakers for the keynote ad
dress are Sen. Edward Ken
nedy, Massachusetts Gov.

Michael Dukakis and Dr. Louis
Sullivan, secretary of Health
and Human Services.
The conference is also plan
ning to ask news broadcaster
Tom Brokaw among others to
moderate the keynote panel.
As the date of the conference
falls on the year of Stanford's
Centennial, the conference's di
rectors hope to merge with the
Centennial Program. The direc
tors also hope to present edu
cational programs in dorms
and graduate schools before the
conference begins to generate
awareness.
Noor adds, "It promises to
be a conference of great intel
lectual fervor; an event that
will truly make a difference."
Five researchers win
investigator awards
Five Stanford researchers
have been named Presidential
Young investigators by the Na
tional Science Foundation.
The award was designed to
help universities attract and
keep young faculty members at
the beginning of their careers.
Each will receive up to
$100,000 per year for five years
in a combination of federal and
private funds to continue their
research. Some 211 researchers
were chosen this year from
around the country.
Forty-eight Stanford re
searchers have won the prize
so far. The five this year are:
• Anoop Gupta, computer
sciences.
• Dwight Nishimura, electri
cal engineering.
• Eric Shaqfeh, chemical en
gineering.
• Allison Smith, civil engi
neering.
• Frank Wolak, economics.
Wolak studies microeconomics
