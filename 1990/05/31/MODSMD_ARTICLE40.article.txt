## TOTAL RECALL? Hollywood hopes summer of 1990 as hot as summer of 1989 
### Chris McKenna Staff writer 
THE STANFORD DAILY'S WEEKLY

Ah, summertime, when young
men and women's fancies turn
from protesting to searching for
internships with big business cor
porations. It's also the time when
Hollywood pulls out the proverbial
big barrels, otherwise known as
the "Summer Blockbusters."
For years, the movie industry
has been quite cognizant of the
fact that a coordination between a
particular inclination of the Earth's
axis with respect to the sun and
the release of projected celluloid
images produces unprecedented
prodigious pecuniary profits.
In other words, big summer
movies mean big money.
This maxim has transformed
the summer box office into an
arena in which big films punch it
out for top receipts. Last summer
saw "Batman" ($251.2 million) as
the hands-down champ among
such heavyweight contenders as
"Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade" and "Lethal Weapon II."
Traditional summertime knock
out power is usually held by the
big budget action/adventure films.
This summer will prove to be no
different, with the studios gearing
up for the Main Event of the year.
The Heavyweights:
And in this corner, weighing in
at 240 lbs. and ready to pump you
up, Arnold Schwarzenegger in "To
tal Recall." After his last stint as
Mr. Nice Guy in the comedy
"Twins", Mr. Universe goes pretty
far to distance himself from that
cute and cuddly role — all the way
to Mars. It's 2084, and Arnie
doesn't know where his mind is.
Haunted by visions of the Red
Planet, the pumpitudiness Earthl
ing sets out on a futuristic odyssev
to retrieve lost memory and kick
some Martian butt.
Directed by "RoboCop'"s
violence-obsessed Paul Verhoeven,
the $55 million metaphysical ven
ture promises action galore, daz
zling special effects and of course
comedic breaks, possibly in the
form of those traditionally corny
Arnie one-liners, althougn most
sources say that this film is a so
phisticated (?) step up from the
typical Schwarzenegger vehicle.
Either way, "Total Recall" is sure
to be a ringer when it opens to
morrow.
—AivJ ifi chfS~£orrier, in ilic yellow
trenchcoat and "Reds" trunks,
Warren "Ishtar" Beatty as the
crime-stopping, square-jawed
flatfoot of the funny papers, "Dick
Ttacy."
With a story line in the true
flavor of the old Chester Gould
comic strip, the movie, produced
and directed by Beatty, features big
stars (boy toy Madonna as Breath
less Ma honey, A 1 Pacino as the

evil Big Boy Caprice, as well as
uncredited appearances by Dustin
Hoffman ana James CaanJ, dis
tinctly grotesque villains (Flattop,
Itchy, the Blank, the Brow,
Pruneface, to name a few), sensa
tional violence and a coldly expres
sionistic look with a touch of the
surreal.
But the question is, will the kids
and teens go for it? Well, Disney
is betting a bundle that they will.
Hoping that "Dick Tracy Fever"
will be as contagious as last sum
mer's "Batmanitis," the studio has
already begun its market
ing/merchandising blitz, from T
shirts to prom dresses.
Adding even more muscle to
fend off the competitors and bring
in the kids, Disney is teaming
Tracy with the premeire of the new
Roger Rabbit cartoon short,
"Rollercoaster Rabbit." "Dick
Tracy" opens June 15.
And back behind the controls is
Tom Cruise as a self-assured loner
out to prove that he is the best,
in "Top Gun II," or rather, "Days
of Thunder." This time, the hotdog
has the need, the need for automo
tive speed.
Cruise plays a wealthy young
entrepreneur who has a dream to
become not only a great stock car
racer on the NASCAR circuit, but
to prove he's the best by winning
the Daytona 500. Nicole Kidman
("Dead Calm") plays an Australian
physician who also plays doctor
with Cruise as his love interest.
If any of this sounds familiar,
well, it should. The $50 million
"Days of Thunder" is brought to
us by producers Don Simpson and
Jerry Bruckheimer, the duo who
gave us "Flashdance" and, yes,
"Top Gun." They insist that
"Thunder" is not a rehash of their
last endeavor with Cruise, but
rather something completely dif
ferent. Who knows? But either way
thunder will be rolling and people
will definitely storm the theaters
to watch Cruise do what he does
best: tire up that patented look of
intensity while battling against all
odds to prove himself. "Days of
Thunder" opens June 27.
And in the grimy T-shirt and
bare feet, Bruce Willis, with a ter
minal case of being in the wrong
place at the right time, climbs back
in the ring to once again pit himself
against a group of sadistic terrorists
in "Die Hard II: Die Harder." The
center of crisis is Dulles Airport
in Washington, D.C., which falls
victim to those übiquitous terrorist
attacks.
But the terrorists didn't count
on Bruno being thpre, whose wife
(Bonnie Bedelia, reprising her role)
is not only in danger of being
killed, she's stuck in a plane with
that annoying reporter from the
first movie! Can Roy Rogers save
the day twice in two films? You
better believe it, cowboy, or this

movie wasn't made for over $75
million. And he'll do it faster than
you can say "Yippee-Ki-Yay,
Mother Goose." Patriotically, "Die
Hard II" opens July 4.
The Middleweights:
While not packing the wallop of
the heavyweights, these movies
hope to go a few round with the
big boys.
And speaking of boys, let it be
known that the boys are back in
town. That's right, Eddie Murphy
and Nick Nolte are back in "Anot
her 48 Hours." In the first movie,
San Francisco cop Jake Cates
(Nolte) had con-man Reggie Ham
mond (Murphy) for 48 hours to
help catch a killer.
Now five years have passed, and
Cates has two days to clear his
name with the law with the very
reluctant help of Hammond. One
should expect a plethora of car
chases, guns, male bonding, street
brawls and, yes, another bar scene.
"Another 48 hours" opens June 8.
It seems as though they just
can't keep those cute little Grem
lins away from water or midnight
snacks, because once again they're
wreaking havoc on the populace.
In "Gremlins II: The New Batch,"
Gizmo (gremlin), Phoebe Cates,
Zach Galligan (people) and director
Joe Dante reteam to kill off a new
horde of mutated creatures which
is raising hell in a Manhattan of
fice building before they reach the
city water supply and, well, you
know. This one just might draw
enough kids to offer a stinging jab
to its June 15 premeiring neighbor,
"Dick Tracy".
Peter Weller reprises his role as
the cyborg with a badge in
"RoboCop II." The title not only
refers to the cinematic sequel but
to RoboCop's own replacement, a
new and improved robotic police
officer. As if playing second fiddle
wasn't bad enough, RoboCop is
still struggling to recover his
human past, battling a new street
drug called Nuke and facing off
against his mechanical nemesis.
Irvin Kcrshner ("Empire Stikes
Back") directs and Frank Miller
("The Dark Knight Returns") wrote
the screenplay. "Robocop II" opens
June 22.
Run for the hills! They're every
where! Big, bird-eating tarantulas,
hairy enough to give anybody
"Arachnophobia." Unfortunately,
Jeff Daniels ("Something Wild") al
ready has the affliction when a
South American arachnid breeds
hundreds of mutated, venomous
offspring in Daniel's barn. It's up
to him to save his family and town,
if only he can overcome that damn
case of arachnophobia. "Arachnop
hobia" opens July 20.
The champ of summertime is
back, but this time sans Millenium
