## Director Joe Dante looks to break sequel jinx with 'Gremlins II' 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Movie sequels are dangerous
things. No matter how successful
a movie is, those who attempt to
recapture the spirit with a sequel
almost always come up short.
In the summer of 1984, the two
biggest original movies were
"Ghostbusters" and "Gremlins."
Even with the return of the original
cast members, last summer's
"Ghostbusters II" flopped. Big.
Enter Joe Dante, a young, inno
vative director whose style and per
sonality parallels friend and
colleague Steven Spielberg. As di
rector, Dante was the creative force
behind the surprise hit "Grem
lins." With this summer's "Grem
lins II: The New Batch," Dante
thinks he can break the sequel jinx.
Dante's past projects reflect his
affinity for the unconventional mo
tion picture. After breaking into
the industry with 1976's "Hol
lywood Boulevard," Dante followed
with the horror flicks "Piranha"
and"The Howling." Dante did a
segment of 1983's "Twilight Zone:
The Movie" right before the
original "Gremlins," which soon
became one of the highest-grossing
pictures of all time.
In the last six years, Dante has
directed the science-fiction film
"Explorers," "Amazon Women On
the Moon," the successful Dennis
Quaid and Martin Short comedy
"Innerspace," and the Tom Hanks
comedy "The 'Burbs." His insight
on the child within all of us has
brough Dante critical acclaim as
a director.
Although Zach Galligan and
Phoebe Cates will return for
"Gremlins II," the fate of these

'Gremlins aren't
really bad, they're just
amusing.'

quel rests on Dante's shoulders;
Warner Bros, waited for Dante's
return before initiating the project.
Dante admits that he has a "soft
spot" in his heart for the gremlins.
If he can recapture Stripe's chaotic
spirit and Gizmo's cute fuzzy
warmth, Dante may very well
break the sequel jinx. J
"Gremlins II: The New Batch"
opens nationally June 15.
Intermission spoke with Joe
Dante in Los Angeles.
Intermission: What made you
take on a sequel to the original
"Gremlins?"
Joe Dante: The original "Grem
lins" took a long time to direct, it
was difficult and a pleasantly
surprising success. But I felt that
I had more or less made my state
ment with that movie. But two
years ago, Warner Bros, came back
to me, and said that the stock
holders were begging for a sequel.
I took the project with the con
ditions that we could use our own
script writer, our own crew and
the creative freedom to do what
ever we wanted. The final work
ended up quite a bit differently
than the original conception. But
at a recent advance screening in
Burbank, 75 percent of the audi
ence said that the sequel was better
than the first one.
I: How is "Gremlins II" different
from the original?
JD: I thought the first one was
more like a horror film. We

couldn't have the same things with
the gremlins as the first one. The
sequel is more like the second half
of the original, with the gremlins
totally let loose in a crazy comedy.
We identify with the original by
opening the movie in Chinatown,
but the bulk of the movie is the
gremlins wreaking havoc in New
York City.

We also added lots of new char
acters with this movie: Mohawk,
the Stripe-like leader; Daffy, the
lunatic; George, a smart gremlin,
and Lenny, a stupid one. Under
the guidance of Rick Baker
("Greystoke"), we ended up spend
ing three times as much on the
sequel (the original "Gremlins"
cost $11 million). The technology
is far better than seven years ago.
In the sequel, we see Gizmo
walking, running and jumping. We
spent $11 million on the gremlin
special effects alone.
I: With the exception of Gizmo,
are all of the new gremlins bad?
JD: Gremlins aren't really bad,
they're just amusing. They're the
human psyche gone wild, like
someone's kid brother. We haven't
changed the undisciplined, chaotic
character which we saw in the first
film. I think people really have a
love/hate relationship with the
gremlins.
I: Is it a love/hate relationship
for you?
JD: No, I have more of a
love/hate relationship with the
studio.
I: Was it easier to use actors
from the original cast?
JD: I like to use the same people
in front and behind the camera. It
gets a lot easier to work with people
whom you know. But although
Steven Spielberg is listed as the

executive producer, he wasn't as
closely related to this film. I think
he just got sick of them, too.
I: How do you think "Gremlins
II" will fare amidst the competition
this summer?
JD: This is going to be a tough

summer, with another blockbuster
film opening every weekend. The
good thing with a sequel is that it
uses known characters. But the flip
side is that people might not be
as excited about it. That's why we
made "Gremlins II" totally differ

ent from the original. I also think
it's better than the first one, and
I think that we'll attract a different
audience than the other films.
I: So what's your next project?
JD Believe me, nothing with rub
ber characters.

If he can recapture Stripe's chaotic
spirit and Gizmo's cute fuzzy
warmth, Dante may very well
break the sequel jinx. J
"Gremlins II: The New Batch"
opens nationally June 15.
Intermission spoke with Joe
Dante in Los Angeles.
Intermission: What made you
take on a sequel to the original
"Gremlins?"
Joe Dante: The original "Grem
lins" took a long time to direct, it
was difficult and a pleasantly
surprising success. But I felt that
I had more or less made my state
ment with that movie. But two
years ago, Warner Bros, came back
to me, and said that the stock
holders were begging for a sequel.
I took the project with the con
ditions that we could use our own
script writer, our own crew and
the creative freedom to do what
ever we wanted. The final work
ended up quite a bit differently
than the original conception. But
at a recent advance screening in
Burbank, 75 percent of the audi
ence said that the sequel was better
than the first one.
I: How is "Gremlins II" different
from the original?
JD: I thought the first one was
more like a horror film. We

couldn't have the same things with
the gremlins as the first one. The
sequel is more like the second half
of the original, with the gremlins
totally let loose in a crazy comedy.
We identify with the original by
opening the movie in Chinatown,
but the bulk of the movie is the
gremlins wreaking havoc in New
York City.

We also added lots of new char
acters with this movie: Mohawk,
the Stripe-like leader; Daffy, the
lunatic; George, a smart gremlin,
and Lenny, a stupid one. Under
the guidance of Rick Baker
("Greystoke"), we ended up spend
ing three times as much on the
sequel (the original "Gremlins"
cost $11 million). The technology
is far better than seven years ago.
In the sequel, we see Gizmo
walking, running and jumping. We
spent $11 million on the gremlin
special effects alone.
I: With the exception of Gizmo,
are all of the new gremlins bad?
JD: Gremlins aren't really bad,
they're just amusing. They're the
human psyche gone wild, like
someone's kid brother. We haven't
changed the undisciplined, chaotic
character which we saw in the first
film. I think people really have a
love/hate relationship with the
gremlins.
I: Is it a love/hate relationship
for you?
JD: No, I have more of a
love/hate relationship with the
studio.
I: Was it easier to use actors
from the original cast?
JD: I like to use the same people
in front and behind the camera. It
gets a lot easier to work with people
whom you know. But although
Steven Spielberg is listed as the

executive producer, he wasn't as
closely related to this film. I think
he just got sick of them, too.
I: How do you think "Gremlins
II" will fare amidst the competition
this summer?
JD: This is going to be a tough

summer, with another blockbuster
film opening every weekend. The
good thing with a sequel is that it
uses known characters. But the flip
side is that people might not be
as excited about it. That's why we
made "Gremlins II" totally differ

ent from the original. I also think
it's better than the first one, and
I think that we'll attract a different
audience than the other films.
I: So what's your next project?
JD Believe me, nothing with rub
ber characters.

The Gremlins meet the Muensters, or at least Grandpa Fred (Robert Prosky), In "Gremlins II: The
New Batch," a sequel to be released June 15. Director Joe Dante claims this will be his last movie
with rubber characters.
Movie sequels are dangerous
things. No matter how successful
a movie is, those who attempt to
recapture the spirit with a sequel
almost always come up short.
In the summer of 1984, the two
biggest original movies were
"Ghostbusters" and "Gremlins."
Even with the return of the original
cast members, last summer's
"Ghostbusters II" flopped. Big.
Enter Joe Dante, a young, inno
vative director whose style and per
sonality parallels friend and
colleague Steven Spielberg. As di
rector, Dante was the creative force
behind the surprise hit "Grem
lins." With this summer's "Grem
lins II: The New Batch," Dante
thinks he can break the sequel jinx.
Dante's past projects reflect his
affinity for the unconventional mo
tion picture. After breaking into
the industry with 1976's "Hol
lywood Boulevard," Dante followed
with the horror flicks "Piranha"
and"The Howling." Dante did a
segment of 1983's "Twilight Zone:
The Movie" right before the
original "Gremlins," which soon
became one of the highest-grossing
pictures of all time.
In the last six years, Dante has
directed the science-fiction film
"Explorers," "Amazon Women On
the Moon," the successful Dennis
Quaid and Martin Short comedy
"Innerspace," and the Tom Hanks
comedy "The 'Burbs." His insight
on the child within all of us has
brough Dante critical acclaim as
a director.
Although Zach Galligan and
Phoebe Cates will return for
"Gremlins II," the fate of these

'Gremlins aren't
really bad, they're just
amusing.'

quel rests on Dante's shoulders;
Warner Bros, waited for Dante's
return before initiating the project.
Dante admits that he has a "soft
spot" in his heart for the gremlins.
If he can recapture Stripe's chaotic
spirit and Gizmo's cute fuzzy
warmth, Dante may very well
break the sequel jinx. J
