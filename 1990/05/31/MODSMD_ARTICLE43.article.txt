# Charm over beauty
## Man forgoes beautiful wife for secretary 
### J.T.S. Moore Editorial staff 
Every night, Bernard Bar
thelemy comes home to a ded
icated wife of unparalleled
beauty. Everyday, Bernard goes
to work at his BMW dealership
where he is greeted by a very
plain-looking secretary.
Defying conventional logic,
he chooses to have an affair
with his secretary at the expense
of his relationship with his wife
— a decision which lies at the
heart of the unusual French film
"Too Beautiful For You."
Writer-director Bertrand Blier
has given his film an almost
"Twilight Zone" quality,
switching the roles of tiie tradi
tional wife and the traditional
mistress. As the film slips back
and forth into the past and pres
ent versions of the same scene,
it becomes difficult to separate
the imagined from the real.
Other peculiar aspects in
clude the appearance of charac
ters in unidentified locations as
they speak directly to the audi
ence and the music of Schubert,
which haunts Bernard wherever
he goes. Underlying the film's
offbeat nature is a cynical
humor that rears its head when
the scene becomes too idyllic
or too desperate.
In virtually every scene, the
camera continually moves
around, toward the characters
or away from them — giving
the normal, static conversation
scenes a physical tempo. The
camera becomes a roving eye
that constantly changes its spa
tial relationship to the actors in
the frame, constantly presenting
the audience with a different
perspective.
As the actors are slowly ex

plored by the camera, their first
rate performances reveal the
true nature of their characters.
Carole Bouquet's portrayal of
the spurned beauty, Florence,
evokes a guarded sympathy. She
comes across as arrogant be
cause of her beauty and frus
trated because her beauty is not
enough to hold her husband.
Josiane Balasko does an out
standing job portraying the "ot
her woman," Colette,
compensating for her average
appearance with a charming,
non-threatening personality.
Knowing that she can never
hold on to Bernard, she tries to
enjoy every moment with him
until the show is over.
The man whom Florence and
Colette pursue is the confused
Bernard. Acclaimed French ac
tor Gerard Depardieu plays his
two-timing character as a man
searching for fulfillment, wor
rying that he has nothing left
to desire. Wisely, Depardieu
retains a slight comic edge to
his character that makes his
performance all the more enjoy
able.
With the tide of summer
blockbuster-wanna-be's already
inundating the theaters, it is
easy to forget about quirky
foreign films. Believe me, I cer
tainly do.
However, if you are feeling a
little esoteric, or just plain ex
hausted, with this summer's
various versions of Armaged
don, all you need to do is re
member that "Too Beautiful For
You" is an alternative that is
too good to miss.
