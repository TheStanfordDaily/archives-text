# 'Back to the Future III' gets back to basics

Ah, the carefree days of late spring — a time
when Hollywood, giddy with anticipation, gears
up for the release of its highly profitable sum
mer blockbusters.
Memorial Day Weekend is traditionally the
time when the first of the summer
heavyweights enters the ring. This year was
no exception, as Universal opened the summer
season with its highly anticipated "Back to the
Future Part III."
- Part 111 picks up right where Part II left off.
Marty (Michael J. Fox) has just discovered that
Doc (Christopher Lloyd) has been accidently
transported back to the year 1885. Thanks to
an explanatory letter thoughtfully penned by
Doc and preserved for 70 years by Western
Union, Marty learns that a malfunction in the
DeLorean has left Doc stranded in the past.
Marty subsequently enlists the aid of the 1955

Doc and, disregarding the 1885 Doc's direct
orders not to follow him, goes back to retrieve
his friend.
The scenario is a familiar one. Once again,
Marty undergoes severe culture shock as he is
thrust into a strange environment. Once again,
he clashes with his arch-nemesis Biff
(hilariously portrayed by comedian Thomas F.
Wilson), who this time is incarnated as Biff's
gunslinging ancestor Buford "Mad Dog" Tan
nen. And once again, Marty finds himself tam
pering with the natural flow of history.
"Back to the Future III" is essentially an Old
West variation on Marty and Doc's experiences
in Parts I and 11. Still, it is an extremely witty,
very fun film which remains completely faithful
to the spirit of the original.

So what if the plot is a little predictable and
merely rehashes what occured in the first two
movies? The same can be said for "Return of
the Jedi."
Yet director Robert Zemeckis ("Who Framed
Roger Rabbit") and writer Bob Gale are not
trying to plumb any new depths in creative
filmaking; they're just out to tell a good story.
The script, wrought with clever, humorous
twists on familiar themes, moves briskly along
to a satisfying conclusion that ties up all the
lose plot ends raised by Part 11.
In addition, this time out, Zcmeckis and
Gale focus a little more on charactcf develop
ment, emphasizing the friendship between Doc
and Marty while introducing a love interest
for Doc.
In sum, "Back to the Future III" is that
rarest of commodities, a film sequel that
breathes new life into the potentially stale
themes generated by the original movie.
