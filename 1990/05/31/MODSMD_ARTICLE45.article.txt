# 'Firebirds' crashes and burns
## 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
One can truly appreciate a movie that
tries to do something never attempted
before.
Imagine this: a flight school, an arrogant
young pilot who thinks he knows everything,
a beautiful woman who successfully rejects
his amorous advances but only for the first
hour of the film, a sex scene between these
two with one color of light permeating the
set, tense training sequences (for flying, not
sex) and action-packed air-to-air combat
scenes against the bad guys. Novel, right?
Well, maybe back in 1986, when the
polished and exciting, albeit shallow, "Top
Gun" became a huge box office
moneymaker; however, "Firebirds," the 1990
Army version of "Top Gun," possesses none
of the qualities that made the Navy flick
provoking.
"Firebirds" does manage to take the al
ready weak storyline from "Top Gun" and
make it look most pitiable, pur hero Jake
Preston, played by Nicholas Cage (miscast
and not as good as Cruise), is a raging
AH-64A Apache attack helicopter pilot who
falls in love with Sean Young ("No Way

Out") while at the same time learning how
to kick butt.
However, as Gorbachev's visit to Stanford
helps to illustrate, it's not vogue to kick
commie butt anymore, so Cage gets to go
against the evil drug cartel lords, who are
conveniently massing to attack something,
somewhere, sometime.
So, they go down to Latin America and
get in some crazy shootouts with Eric Stoh
ler, some cheesy villain who's supposed to
be the best mercenary pilot around. All we
see of this guy is amazing intelligence photos
of him snarling and shoving guns down
people's throats. Not a lot of character de
velopment anywhere in this movie, believe
me.
If all that isn't enough to keep you away
from this movie, the music is lame, too.
What's a flying/action movie without a
throbbing Kenny Loggins soundtrack?
Overall, I emphatically urge you not to
see "Firebirds." Besides, finals are coming
up. You should be reading anyway.
