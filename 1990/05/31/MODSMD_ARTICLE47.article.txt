Nestled in the trees at Coyote Point Park in
San Mateo lies a quaint restaurant overlooking
the Bay. With a panoramic view stretching from
South San Francisco to the East Bay, one feels
as though dining on top of a desert island
surrounded by water.

Seafood

The restaurant with this beautiful natural
setting is appropriately called the Castaway.
Located just off Highway 101, the restaurant
offers a cozy yet elegant environment and de
licious, high-quality food.
The interior decor of the Castaway cleverly
sticks to the restaurant's theme. After entering
through a beautiful atrium, there is a warm
fireplace giving off just the right amount of
light to create a dim, comfortable setting.
Wood ceiling fans stir the leaves of hanging
plants and ferns surrounding the tables and
chairs. The seats, curtains and carpets are
deliberately made of unmatching materials and
patterns to give the restaurant the true air of
a castaway's abode. Ceramic statuettes, trinkets
and photos of sailboats add charm and character
to the cozy environment.
Manager Dee Swain attests that the food
quality is one of the restaurant's highest
priorities. The menu includes lighter foods in
addition to "real foods" like sirloin steak,
chicken, filet mignon, Alaskan crab and a large
variety of seafood and pasta.
The restaurant's new menu contains
specialties like mozzarella chicken, a tender
chicken breast filled with mozzarella cheese
and spinach poached in a light peppercorn
sauce. Other specialties include shrimp and
saffron angel hair pasta and steak and scampi
chardonnay. All house specialties are served
with enough fresh vegetables, fresh cracked
wheat bread and soup to fill even the hungriest
castaway.
The restaurant also boasts 15 appetizers,
ranging from the hearty cheese-filled potato
skins to the light shrimp cocktail.
Along with chocolate suicide, dark chocolate
cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate
sauce, the Castaway serves pecan pie, straw
berry cheesecake, amaretto mousse and choc
olate mousse cake.
The Castaway is not a restaurant to visit
dressed like Gilligan. Comfortable attire is rec
ommended, though, so you can loosen your
belt after eating. Prices range from $5 to $15
for appetizers and $11 to $30 for entrees.

Castaway Restaurant is located at Coyote Point
Drive in San Mateo. Call 347-1027 for more
