## Students' pieces form dance production 'Pieces' 
### Jill Antonides Staff writer 
Looking for a free-of-charge, ar
tistically sophisticated and highly
entertaining activity this weekend?
Head for Memorial Hall's Little
Theater at 8 p.m. Friday or Satur
day night for "Pieces," presented
by graduate students in dance Pam
Leith, Laurie Ratliff and Linda
Roberts. The production of the
show is derived from a graduate
student requirement to create two
contrasting works. The end result
is a combination of each student's
background and style, making a
quirkily disjointed selection of six
"Pieces."
Pam Leith will present a solo,
"Tenderly," danced by Dance Di
vision faculty member Stacey
Greenberg-Zonka. Leith describes
the piece as "tender and romantic,
yet private," with the movement
created as an emotional response
to the music.
Her second piece, the trio "10-
12-4-3-plunk," presents a radically
different style, using horizontal

lines and a play with balance,
"pushing and pulling," as the pri
mary determinants of the
movement.
Laurie Ratliff opposes lyrical jazz
to mixed-media in her two works.
Her "Passing Through on Highway
84," set to blues music and danced
by a group of six, offers images of
relationships born out of growing
up in a small town.
Ratliff's second piece, a trio,
combines dance and acting and a
variety of music.
Completing the program will be
Linda Roberts' two pieces, a solo
set to music by Meredith Monk
and "Moments," a two-part piece
about relationships which com
bines text and movement. The first
part, entitled "The Beggar," is a
narrative about a silent artist,
(Ratliff) and a talkative man,
played by Carmichael Blanken
ship, who tries to bring her out of
her shell. The second part, "The
Killing," explores further the rela
tionship between text and music
and dance.
All performances are free.
