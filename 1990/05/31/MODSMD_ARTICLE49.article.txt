# Disc explosion marks the death of vinyl LPs
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
A few months ago, while waiting for
a table at Chili's, I wandered into The
Wherehouse. My eyes searched around
looking for the record section.
After a minute or so I asked the
gentlemen behind the counter where
the LPs were kept. "We don't sell 'em
anymore," he replied curtly.
For an instant I was shellshocked. It
was almost as if we had lost the Cold
War, admitted capitalism was inferior
and decided to become a satellite of
the Soviet Union.
The tried and true, time tested, vinyl
long-playing record has been around
forever. The plasticized, rainbow
colored compact disc is small, insub
stantial, devoid of tradition and — get
ready to call me a Neanderthal — mu
sically inferior.
An exact technical explanation for
the LP's superiority is beyond my lim
ited tecnical knowledge, but. . . Records
are capable of recording changes as
subtle as 17 billionths of an inch. In
other words, they can record music —
and incredibly complex waveform —
and capture all of its richness.
Records are analog; CDs are digital.
Sound is analog. In order for sound to
be put on a CD at all it has to be
turned into a bunch of O's and l's at

some point in the recording process.
In the conversion from analog to dig
ital, information is lost. Period.
Whether that information is relevant
to the listener is the subject of much
debate.
Most people prefer CDs to records.
They are much harder to scratch, much
easier to clean and free from the effects
of warping. All good stuff. I will freely
admit that most people even think they
sound better.
The primary reason for that is they
hear records which are being played on
lousy equipment. A cheap turntable can
make a perfectly wonderful record
sound perfect awful. A cheap CD player,
on the other hand, sounds pretty good.
Records also suffer from nasty effects
like hiss and occasional snap, crackle,
pop. CDs skip now and again, but rarely
are victims of background interference.
Okay, then, what makes records bet
ter? Take an LP, put it on a Linn turn
table (like miner), dust it with an anti
static brush and lower the tonearm.
What you'll hear is a delightful, three
dimensional musical reproduction rich
with subtlety. Listen for the sound of
the bass guitarist humming and you
can pick it out.
Now take the same album, drop it
in a $250 Sony player CD player and
listen. The lead singer sounds like he's
standing inside the snare drum. That

The plasticized, rainbow
colored compact disc is
small, insubstantial,
devoid of tradition.

humming is suddenly muddled amid
the tamborine rattle. You're singing
along with this hodgepodge when sud
denly you'd swear the vocals came in
half a beat early.
To this pair of ears — and many
others — the best turntable sounds
clearly superior to the best CD player.
That hasn't stopped the little guy from
gaining an ever-increasing share of the
recorded music market.
There is no surprise there. Americans
prefer cassette tapes, which sound truly
lousy compared to records and compact
discs, because they are easy to carry,
work in Walkmans and automobiles,
and are good enough for the everyman's
tin ear.
CDs are also convenient, work in
portables and sound much better than
tapes. But their proliferation is actually
due more to a sinister industrial plot
than anything else. CDs were invented
by Phillips and Sony. Phillips owns a
number of the largest classical musical
companied; Sony owns CBS records —

the largest producer of general con
sumption music in the known universe.
Both companies also receive a royalty
on everv CD player sold. The profits
keep rolling in as consumers swallow
up the discs and the devices on which
to play to them.
A few days ago, I was in Tower
Records and did the same record search
I had done at The Wherehouse. Even
tually, I spied a few racks worth of LPs
off to the side. A sense of relief came
over me.
Turntable owners are not about to
be left out in the cold. Ninety-nine
percent of new music is still available
on vinyl. But records are clearly going
to become a little bit harder to find as
the years go by.
Unfortunately, no one in the next
generation will ever get a chance to
appreciate them. Our new culture is
too enamored with the CD to ever look
back.
I fell the CD craze sucking me in as
well. I know they don't sound as good.
I know they're more expensive. Yet, I'll
probably buy them by the bundle in
the future.
It's painful to admit, but inside I
know the long-playing record's long life
is in its twilight. Another piece of
Americana is on its way out. At least
I still have my Toller skates and hula
hoop in the closet to keep me company.

Okay, then, what makes records bet
ter? Take an LP, put it on a Linn turn
table (like miner), dust it with an anti
static brush and lower the tonearm.
What you'll hear is a delightful, three
dimensional musical reproduction rich
with subtlety. Listen for the sound of
the bass guitarist humming and you
can pick it out.
Now take the same album, drop it
in a $250 Sony player CD player and
listen. The lead singer sounds like he's
standing inside the snare drum. That

The plasticized, rainbow
colored compact disc is
small, insubstantial,
devoid of tradition.

humming is suddenly muddled amid
the tamborine rattle. You're singing
along with this hodgepodge when sud
denly you'd swear the vocals came in
half a beat early.
To this pair of ears — and many
others — the best turntable sounds
clearly superior to the best CD player.
That hasn't stopped the little guy from
gaining an ever-increasing share of the
recorded music market.
There is no surprise there. Americans
prefer cassette tapes, which sound truly
lousy compared to records and compact
discs, because they are easy to carry,
work in Walkmans and automobiles,
and are good enough for the everyman's
tin ear.
CDs are also convenient, work in
portables and sound much better than
tapes. But their proliferation is actually
due more to a sinister industrial plot
than anything else. CDs were invented
by Phillips and Sony. Phillips owns a
number of the largest classical musical
companied; Sony owns CBS records —

the largest producer of general con
sumption music in the known universe.
Both companies also receive a royalty
on everv CD player sold. The profits
keep rolling in as consumers swallow
up the discs and the devices on which
to play to them.
A few days ago, I was in Tower
Records and did the same record search
I had done at The Wherehouse. Even
tually, I spied a few racks worth of LPs
off to the side. A sense of relief came
over me.
Turntable owners are not about to
be left out in the cold. Ninety-nine
percent of new music is still available
on vinyl. But records are clearly going
to become a little bit harder to find as
the years go by.
Unfortunately, no one in the next
generation will ever get a chance to
appreciate them. Our new culture is
too enamored with the CD to ever look
back.
I fell the CD craze sucking me in as
well. I know they don't sound as good.
I know they're more expensive. Yet, I'll
probably buy them by the bundle in
the future.
It's painful to admit, but inside I
know the long-playing record's long life
is in its twilight. Another piece of
Americana is on its way out. At least
I still have my Toller skates and hula
hoop in the closet to keep me company.
