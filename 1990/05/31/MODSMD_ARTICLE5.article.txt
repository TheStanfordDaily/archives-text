# Artists to present Gorbachev with symbolic paintings
## 
### Brooke Hart Staff writer 
Bringing a theme of peace to Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit on Monday, a pair
of Bay Area artists will present the
Soviet president with two works
portraying harmonious colors and
graceful dolphins.
The works will be presented to Gor
bachev at the Stanford Art Gallery in
a ceremony led by Art Department
Chair Wanda Corn.
"Creation of Peace," a 6-by-4-foot
abstract enamel on wood by Hills
borough artist Cynthia Schuman, and

"The Peacemakers," a painting of dol
phins above the earth by George Sum
ner of Sausalito, were accepted
through the Soviet Consulate in San
Francisco.
"This painting has a life force of its
own," said Schuman of her work. It
"bursts with energy" when the color
is seen in the sunshine, she said, "like
the Big Bang, like the Creation."
Schuman, a Stanford alumna, has de
veloped her technique for the past two
years.
She first allows an enamel with a
sun-sensitive pigment to react with the
sun's rays, and then she bakes the

works. Schuman said Stanford Art
History Prof. Albert Elsen has been
instrumental in the development of her
abstract technique.
Sumner, who owns and displays his
work in a gallery in Sausalito,
describes himself as an "environmental
impressionist artist." The dolphins, ac
cording to Sumner, are symbolic of
peace as "one of the most friendly
animals on the planet."
Eugene Fokine, vice consul to the
Soviet consul general in San Francisco,
requested both artists to present their
paintings to Gorbachev during his Bay
Area visit. A friend of Schuman's

showed the painting to Soviet jour
nalist Vladimir Posner about six weeks
ago.
Posner then contacted Valentin
Kamenev, the consul general in San
Francisco; the two were arranging to
present the painting to Gorbachev in
Moscow when the Soviet president's
Bay Area itinerary changed to include
a visit to Stanford. Schuman was con
tacted last week about giving the paint
ing to Gorbachev on Monday.
Sumner completed "The
Peacemakers" painting two years ago
with the hope of presenting it to Gor
bachev in an earlier visit.
