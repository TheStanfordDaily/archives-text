## More than just New Kids: Summer promises quality new music 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
The signs are definitely ominous.
Madonna's "Vogue" is the number one
single in the country. New Kids on the
Block have another album coming out.
And Milli Vanilli and Paula Abdul just
put out remix albums of their top-40 hits.
In other words, for the true music
aficionado, it looks like it's going to be a
long, hot summer.
Well, the signs are wrong. This summer
promises an onslaught of new releases
and compact-disc reissues just waiting in
the wings before their bombardment. Get
out your wallets and checkbooks; this
summer's music releases have too many
gems to pass up.
Many artists who have hit it big in the
past are hoping that this summer will be
the prime time to catapult back onto the
charts. Roxy Music man Bryan Ferry fol
lows up his "Bete Noire" with a still
untitled work on August 28. Paul Young,
who hit number one with the mainstream
ballad "Every Time You Go Away," re
leases "Other Voices" on July 17. A-ha,
which set a music video standard with
1983's "Take On Me," releases a new
album September 25.
Some of these artists hoping to reclaim
the spotlight need a successful summer
album. In the music industry, careers can
be ruined by two consecutive poor-selling
albums. After a disappointing "Lovesexy"
album and tour, Prince is looking for a
comeback with the soundtrack to his
newest movie, "Graffiti Bridge," released
July 24. Talking Heads will release another
album this summer, following the pathetic

"Naked" and the commercially-quiet solo
project of David Byrne, "Rei Momo."
Bruce Hornsby and the Range will try
to come out of tneir sophomore slump by
following "Scenes from the Southside"
with a new album. Shopping-mall queen
Tiffany, whose second album flopped, will
probably go back to cover versions of
Beatles songs on her third album, due
August 20. And Crowded House and Hall
and Oates are also each due for another
album this fall.
Remember the bubble-gum pop group
Wham!? George Michael will try to recap
ture the success of "Faith" with a new
album this fall, and partner Andrew
Ridgeley will also release a solo album on
the same CBS label. Any bets on which
record sells more?
Modern rock fans will have a field day
this summer, as some of the alternative
standards present their summer releases.
Almost a year after the Smithereens' "11,"
the Stranglers will release "10" June 5. It
is "useless to resist" the second album

Ministry will release a still-untitled album
on August 14. Jane's Addiction releases
"Ritual De Lo Habitual" on August 28.
Despite rumors to the contrary, Sire
Records sources insisted that Morrisey will
release an album in late August. No in
formation on this work was available, but
a video collection of the ex-Smith's solo
works, entitled "Hulmerist," is due August
14.
The Ramones will release a huge com
pilation album, including six songs with
the word "wanna" in the title, on June
12, tentatively titled "All This Stuff (And
More) Volume I." Don't tell a soul about

28. Hothouse Flowers, bounding off their

bands are also plugging out new works in
upcoming months. The Call is scheduled

on Los Angeles' KROQ, releases "These

wheat Zydeco and Wild Swans are due

leases "Joy 1967-1990," an all-new album,
on June 19. Dave Stewart of the Euryth
mics goes solo August 15. And a new
band, Adamskie, described as "Nitzer Ebb
like house music," will release their debut
June 11.
Sick of "Dick Tracy" hype yet? Well,
even more albums are headed our way,
now that Madonna has led the pack.
Warner Bros, is relying on a "Batman' Mike
formula by releasing the "Dick Tracy
Original Soundtrack" along with Danny
Elfman's "Dick Tracy Original Score." The
soundtrack features k.d. lang, Take 6, Jerry
Lee Lewis, Brenda Lee, Tommy Page,
Erasure and Ice-T. But if Elfman's mas
terful work on the "Batman Score" is any
indication, I would score the score even
