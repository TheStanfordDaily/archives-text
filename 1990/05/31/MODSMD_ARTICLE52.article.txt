# Pretenders pretend to be the same, succeed

### Ari Richter Staff writer 
When "Pretenders" was released
in 1980, the album cover pictured
four band members — Chrissie
Hynde, Pete Farndon, Martin
Chambers and James Honeyman
Scott.
One decade later, a band by the
same name has released "Packed!"
But are these the same Pretenders?
Listening to the opening chords
of the first song, "Never Do That,"
one would suppose so. The sound
which first greets the listener is
that of Hynde's guitar, and the
next sounds are Hynde's vocals.
So what's different?
Well, unless a lot of people all

changed their names, everything
except Chrissie Hynde. John
Mckenzie, Blair Cunningham and
Billy Bremner have replaced
Farndon, Chambers and Scott, and
Mitchell Froom has replaced Chris
Thomas as producer.
In fact, all these changes have
little impact on a studio album.
As well as singing and playing
guitar, Hynde has written or co
written all tracks except for "May
This Be Love" — a cover of Jimi
Hendrix's "Waterfall."
This full digital recording is
indeed packed with great music.
"When Will I See You," "Criminal"
and "Sense Of Purpose," are per
haps the album's best tracks.
All too often, albums of the last

several years have been long on
rhythm boxes and short on
genuine music. By contrast,
Hynde's vocals and the rich mu
sical sounds which these songs
possess create a refreshingly honest
sound.
Of Hynde's many talents, per
haps her greatest girt is her ability
to give her songs musical depth.
Just when you think you've heard
all that a song has to offer, one of
the vocal or guitar parts changes
just enough to add a new dimen
sion to the song. In "Let's Make

A Pact," a varied guitar line and
a new melody line infuse extra life
into an already compelling track.
Again, not unlike "Pretenders,"
"Packed!" offers a mixture of slow
and fast songs. The 11 songs on
the album run the gamut from the
Hendrix ballad to "No Guarantee,"
a hard-driving track dominated by
its chaotic guitar and drum parts
as Hynde's vocals tend to be
screams more than singing.
Although Hynde is not quite
able to pull off the latter song,
allowing its coherence to get lost
among the angry guitars, the al
bum as a whole is a bright success.
And if Chrissie Hynde ever
decides officially to go solo, no one
will notice a difference.
