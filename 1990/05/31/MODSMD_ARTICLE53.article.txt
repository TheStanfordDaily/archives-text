# Modern English melts hearts with return

### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
When a band's new album in
cludes a new version of its classic
song, two concerns immediately
come to mind: that the album
needs a gimmick to sell and that
the song will be ruined by an in
adequate revision.
When the song is as great as
Modern English's modern rock
classic, "I Melt With You/' the
latter concern can become more
like an overwhelming fear.
Fortunately for Modern English

fans, those fears are unfounded.
The band does little to fix a song
that wasn't broke, simply adding
some soothing bass and guitar
lines to the song's already rich
tapestry.
The rest of the album proves
that the gimmick was probably not
needed, as the quintessential
modern rock band puts together
an enjoyably light mixture of soul
ful songs that are sure to find some
place in PopMusicLand.

centric combination of modern
rock and Kentucky bluegrass fid
dling.
Although most people only rec
ognize the hit song from 1982's
"After the Snow" album, Modem
English can claim two other al
bums before returning with "Pillow
Lips." Heavier instrumentals and

more spirited vocals characterized
the brilliant but overlooked debut
album, which gave way to a lighter,
more refined sound on later al
bums.
"Beauty" and "Care About You"
show Modern English's refined
sound, which has merged the
band's rough early style with the
carefree pop of When in Rome's
debut album.
As the developing trio continues
to soothe and satisfy, "Pillow Lips"
turns out to be an aptly descriptive
title.
