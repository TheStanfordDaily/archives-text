# Richards: Faculty of color face problems at elite universities

What could compel a newly
tenured professor with a promis
ing future at Stanford to leave?
After teaching drama and
directing the Committee on Black
Performing Arts at Stanford for
a decade, Sandra Richards ac
cepted a tenured position starting
this fall at Northwestern Univer
sity.
She is not bitter, but she points
out some of the problems elite
universities like Stanford some

times pose for faculty of color,
often making them feel they have
no choice but to accept other op
portunities.
Richards said that people had
warned her of tensions between
teaching, directing plays and
being director of the Committee
on Black Performing Arts, on the
one hand, and doing research,
publishing and ultimately earning
tenure, on the other.
But Richards had been one of
the founders of the committee as
a graduate student at Stanford in
drama in the early 19705, and she

felt connected to it. She did not
know how difficult it would be to
accomplish that array of tasks.
"I think, to a certain extent, for
a number of years the committee
has been seen as a service activity,
and service activities rank low on
the totem pole by which one is
tenured," she said.
Ron Davies, an administrator
in the Drama Department, agrees
that Richards as a junior faculty
member had too many responsi
bilities as administrator of the
performing arts committee while
simultaneously teaching, direct

ing and doing research.
"That's unfortunate. Junior
faculty should not have to do both
jobs," Davies said, adding that the
time spent directing the commit
tee "is not time that shows up on
the scorecard when you come up
for tenure."
Davies said the Drama Depart
ment has the option of hiring an
already tenured professor to
replace Richards, so that he or
she will not face the same diffi
culties. Davies said the depart
ment tried "in good faith to do
what it could to keep her" since

she was "a good colleague," but
members of the department sup
port her in her decision.
Richards also acknowledged cer
tain difficulties particular to mi
norities in a predominantly white
institution.
One of the biggest hurdles fac
ulty of color face is "that there
are so few of us on the campus
that they often may be the only
minority faculty in a department
. . . so there is a kind of loneli
ness," Richards said.
