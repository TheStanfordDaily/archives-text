# Richards: Faculty of color face problems at elite universities

What could compel a newly
tenured professor with a promis
ing future at Stanford to leave?
After teaching drama and
directing the Committee on Black
Performing Arts at Stanford for
a decade, Sandra Richards ac
cepted a tenured position starting
this fall at Northwestern Univer
sity.
She is not bitter, but she points
out some of the problems elite
universities like Stanford some

times pose for faculty of color,
often making them feel they have
no choice but to accept other op
portunities.
Richards said that people had
warned her of tensions between
teaching, directing plays and
being director of the Committee
on Black Performing Arts, on the
one hand, and doing research,
publishing and ultimately earning
tenure, on the other.
But Richards had been one of
the founders of the committee as
a graduate student at Stanford in
drama in the early 19705, and she

felt connected to it. She did not
know how difficult it would be to
accomplish that array of tasks.
"I think, to a certain extent, for
a number of years the committee
has been seen as a service activity,
and service activities rank low on
the totem pole by which one is
tenured," she said.
Ron Davies, an administrator
in the Drama Department, agrees
that Richards as a junior faculty
member had too many responsi
bilities as administrator of the
performing arts committee while
simultaneously teaching, direct

ing and doing research.
"That's unfortunate. Junior
faculty should not have to do both
jobs," Davies said, adding that the
time spent directing the commit
tee "is not time that shows up on
the scorecard when you come up
for tenure."
Davies said the Drama Depart
ment has the option of hiring an
already tenured professor to
replace Richards, so that he or
she will not face the same diffi
culties. Davies said the depart
ment tried "in good faith to do
what it could to keep her" since

she was "a good colleague," but
members of the department sup
port her in her decision.
Richards also acknowledged cer
tain difficulties particular to mi
norities in a predominantly white
institution.
One of the biggest hurdles fac
ulty of color face is "that there
are so few of us on the campus
that they often may be the only
minority faculty in a department
. . . so there is a kind of loneli
ness," Richards said.

The University "hasn't seemed
to be a place where faculty mem
bers could also be friends," Ric
hards said, adding that with so
few minority faculty members, it
is hard to support each other suf
ficiently.
"I don't want to suggest that
black faculty members nave not
been supportive," Richards added,
citing her strong ties with the
theater community. "For a long
time my friends or my real sup
port network was outside of
academia."
Richards added that like depart
ments at other elite universities,
Stanford's Drama Department
tends to have a Eurocentric ori
entation, another potential source
of alienation for minority faculty.
"Given that kind of orientation,
American drama is, I guess, a low
ranking cousin, and within this,
I'm seen as being a sort of sub
specialty of American drama,"
Richards said. "I certainly have
been aware of the situation in the
department that I am peripheral

to its mtyor concerns."
Richards said there is more of
a support network at Northwest
ern with more people working on
the same type of scholarship.
Northwestern also has more es
tablished institutions for African
and African-American studies.
Davies said Stanford's Drama
Department is committed to
teaching about the contributions
of non-Europeans to drama.
"Sandra was the primary person
who did this and because she did,
other people did not," Davies said,
adding that he knows this sounds
like the department is not making
enough effort to expand the focus
of the department.
He said part of the problem is
the small size of the department,
with only eight professoriate po
sitions and many members' back
grounds being in the vast
European tradition of drama. "I
don't think we're ahead of the
pack (of Ivy League schools), but
we're not behind the pack either."
Alice Rayner, an assistant pro
fessor of theory and literature in
the department, said that Ric
hards' departure constitutes "a
mtgor loss to the department and
the campus as a whole." She said

she was more saddened than sur
prised about Richards' decision.
"She's gone a long way in help
ing us break out of the canon in
Western Culture," Rayner said,
adding that Richards helped
broaden the focus of the depart
ment by challenging "the Euro
pean dominance of our
curriculum," as well as the male
dominance in the canon.
Though Richards sees better op
portunities at Northwestern, she
said things have improved at
Stanford over the past three
years. Richards said she was
gratified that more students have
been responsive to her classes,
which often incorporate issues of
identity and social protest from
the perspective of people of the
African diaspora.
"When one reads the history of
American drama, it really reads
as the history of the drama writ
ten by white American men," Ric
hards said. Because that group is
in fact a minority, the Drama De
partment should look at the other
contributors, she added.
Richards said Northwestern has
made more of a concerted effort
to change this kind of Eurocentric
orientation by funding institu

tions like iU Center for Advanced
Study for African Studies.
Though Stanford accepted a pro
posal for the Black Studies Re
search Institute in the early
19705, it never materialized.
"It's a real kind of loss. That
kind of loss will be compounded
in the era of budget cuts," she
said. "It's going to be that much
more difficult to put that kind of
thing together later on."
To attract and retain faculty,
Richards said the African and
Afro-American Studies Program
must first be strengthened. It
should offer more research and
interdisciplinary courses with fac
ulty and students working to
gether to create their own
aesthetic for the discipline, she
added.
"I think Stanford at some point
has to decide whether it wants to
be a site of excellence in relation
ship to African and African-
American Studies," Richards said.
"It's certainly a site of excellence
in other areas. If that's what it
wants it can bring intelligence and
resources to bear, or certainly it
can take it on as a challenge in
a way I don't think it has yet."

which often incorporate issues of
identity and social protest from
the perspective of people of the
African diaspora.
"When one reads the history of
American drama, it really reads
as the history of the drama writ
ten by white American men," Ric
hards said. Because that group is
in fact a minority, the Drama De
partment should look at the other
contributors, she added.
Richards said Northwestern has
made more of a concerted effort
to change this kind of Eurocentric
orientation by funding institu

tions like iU Center for Advanced
Study for African Studies.
Though Stanford accepted a pro
posal for the Black Studies Re
search Institute in the early
19705, it never materialized.
"It's a real kind of loss. That
kind of loss will be compounded
in the era of budget cuts," she
said. "It's going to be that much
more difficult to put that kind of
thing together later on."
To attract and retain faculty,
Richards said the African and
Afro-American Studies Program
must first be strengthened. It
should offer more research and
interdisciplinary courses with fac
ulty and students working to
gether to create their own
aesthetic for the discipline, she
added.
"I think Stanford at some point
has to decide whether it wants to
be a site of excellence in relation
ship to African and African-
American Studies," Richards said.
"It's certainly a site of excellence
in other areas. If that's what it
wants it can bring intelligence and
resources to bear, or certainly it
can take it on as a challenge in
a way I don't think it has yet."
What could compel a newly
tenured professor with a promis
ing future at Stanford to leave?
After teaching drama and
directing the Committee on Black
Performing Arts at Stanford for
a decade, Sandra Richards ac
cepted a tenured position starting
this fall at Northwestern Univer
sity.
She is not bitter, but she points
out some of the problems elite
universities like Stanford some

times pose for faculty of color,
often making them feel they have
no choice but to accept other op
portunities.
Richards said that people had
warned her of tensions between
teaching, directing plays and
being director of the Committee
on Black Performing Arts, on the
one hand, and doing research,
publishing and ultimately earning
tenure, on the other.
But Richards had been one of
the founders of the committee as
a graduate student at Stanford in
drama in the early 19705, and she

felt connected to it. She did not
know how difficult it would be to
accomplish that array of tasks.
"I think, to a certain extent, for
a number of years the committee
has been seen as a service activity,
and service activities rank low on
the totem pole by which one is
tenured," she said.
Ron Davies, an administrator
in the Drama Department, agrees
that Richards as a junior faculty
member had too many responsi
bilities as administrator of the
performing arts committee while
simultaneously teaching, direct

ing and doing research.
"That's unfortunate. Junior
faculty should not have to do both
jobs," Davies said, adding that the
time spent directing the commit
tee "is not time that shows up on
the scorecard when you come up
for tenure."
Davies said the Drama Depart
ment has the option of hiring an
already tenured professor to
replace Richards, so that he or
she will not face the same diffi
culties. Davies said the depart
ment tried "in good faith to do
what it could to keep her" since

she was "a good colleague," but
members of the department sup
port her in her decision.
Richards also acknowledged cer
tain difficulties particular to mi
norities in a predominantly white
institution.
One of the biggest hurdles fac
ulty of color face is "that there
are so few of us on the campus
that they often may be the only
minority faculty in a department
. . . so there is a kind of loneli
ness," Richards said.

The University "hasn't seemed
to be a place where faculty mem
bers could also be friends," Ric
hards said, adding that with so
few minority faculty members, it
is hard to support each other suf
ficiently.
"I don't want to suggest that
black faculty members nave not
been supportive," Richards added,
citing her strong ties with the
theater community. "For a long
time my friends or my real sup
port network was outside of
academia."
Richards added that like depart
ments at other elite universities,
Stanford's Drama Department
tends to have a Eurocentric ori
entation, another potential source
of alienation for minority faculty.
"Given that kind of orientation,
American drama is, I guess, a low
ranking cousin, and within this,
I'm seen as being a sort of sub
specialty of American drama,"
Richards said. "I certainly have
been aware of the situation in the
department that I am peripheral

to its mtyor concerns."
Richards said there is more of
a support network at Northwest
ern with more people working on
the same type of scholarship.
Northwestern also has more es
tablished institutions for African
and African-American studies.
Davies said Stanford's Drama
Department is committed to
teaching about the contributions
of non-Europeans to drama.
"Sandra was the primary person
who did this and because she did,
other people did not," Davies said,
adding that he knows this sounds
like the department is not making
enough effort to expand the focus
of the department.
He said part of the problem is
the small size of the department,
with only eight professoriate po
sitions and many members' back
grounds being in the vast
European tradition of drama. "I
don't think we're ahead of the
pack (of Ivy League schools), but
we're not behind the pack either."
Alice Rayner, an assistant pro
fessor of theory and literature in
the department, said that Ric
hards' departure constitutes "a
mtgor loss to the department and
the campus as a whole." She said

she was more saddened than sur
prised about Richards' decision.
"She's gone a long way in help
ing us break out of the canon in
Western Culture," Rayner said,
adding that Richards helped
broaden the focus of the depart
ment by challenging "the Euro
pean dominance of our
curriculum," as well as the male
dominance in the canon.
Though Richards sees better op
portunities at Northwestern, she
said things have improved at
Stanford over the past three
years. Richards said she was
gratified that more students have
been responsive to her classes,
which often incorporate issues of
identity and social protest from
the perspective of people of the
African diaspora.
