# Cutting to the Bone not backed by senate
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
Douglas Bone wants to give you
a dollar.
But the ASSU Senate told him
he couldn't.
Bone, a graduate senator,
brought a proposal to last night's
senate meeting that would have
cut the salaries of the Council of
Presidents and other student
leaders, along with travel and
other ASSU expenses, by $11,900.
The funds saved would have gone
to lower the mandatory ASSU
student fee next fall by one dollar.
"I think students would like to
lower the nonrefundable portion
of student fees," Bone said. He
emphasized that he felt several
areas in the budget such as travel
expenses and COP assistants'
salaries were unnecessary.
The proposal would have cut
COP salaries by $1,000 from their
current level of $5,125 per COP
member.
Undergraduate senator Naomi
Onaga supported the current
salaries, saying that by hourly
wages the salaries were "very,
very low."
But fellow undergraduate
senator Noel Maurer, who did not
state an opinion about the
salaries, pointed out that by his
calculations each COP member
makes $8.54 an hour.
In a protracted discussion that
often digressed into technicalities
of the rules of order, the senate

voted on each of Bone's nine pro
posed cuts separately, each time
choosing not to make the change.
Bone ultimately had to with
draw his amendment.
The senate did pass the entire
operating budget for the 1990-
1991 year and elected George
McKinney, a freshman senator,
deputy senate chair.
In other business during a
meeting that COP member-elect
Jamie Green called "the most mel
low I've been to," the senate dis
solved the ASSU dry-cleaning
service on an undivided voice vote.
ASSU Financial Manager
Sandra Leal said the business has
lost money for three consecutive
years, which she attributed to a
lack of quality contractors at good
prices. She said, "We can't provide
a decent service."
Leal also mentioned the possi
bility that the ASSU could "take
over the Student Directory." She
said the University was consider
ing producing the directory itself,
and that she had proposed to
make the directory an ASSU busi
ness instead.
The senate also approved the
purchase of a raster-image proc
essor for ASSU Typesetting. The
equipment will improve the ease
of communication between the
computer systems at the ASSU
Type & Design shop and help keep
some of its customers, such as
the newspaper of the Graduate
School of Business, the Reporter,
and The Daily.
