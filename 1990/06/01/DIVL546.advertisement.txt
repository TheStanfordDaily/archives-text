WELCOME TO THE BAY AREA,
PRESIDENT GORBACHEV
We Are Glad You Have Come.
We applaud the significant gains in human rights made under your leadership in the Soviet Union.
Improved emigration from your country, along with increased cultural freedom for Soviet Jews,
have contributed notably to the new era in Soviet-American relations.
We want you to know that we fully support the progress you have made possible.
But we also want you to know of our continued concern for the well-being of Soviet Jews. We urge
you to apply your leadership to make recent progress complete.
STRENGTHEN YOUR STAND AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM
In the interest of human rights, Perestroika, and continued improvement in relations between our
countries, we call on you to make a strong and explicit declaration against anti-Semitism before
the soviet public. Surely, the proliferation of anti-Semitic ideology and activity in the USSR must
be as abhorrent to you as it is to us.
LET THE LAST OF THE REFUSNIKS GO
We commend your government for allowing larger numbers of Soviet Jews to emigrate. Now we
urge you to end the refusnik problem by releasing the more than 1,000 Soviet citizens who are still
denied exit visas and by instituting an emigration law in compliance with international standards.
EASE THE TRANSIT OF EMIGRES TO ISRAEL
We call upon you to honor the agreement to permit direct flights carrying emigres from the USSR
to Israel.
Our Jewish community is raising funds to fly Soviet Jews to Israel and resettle them there through
a campaign called Operation Exodus. Your backing of the direct flights agreement will make this
historic emigration easier for gill concerned.
After decades of struggle on behalf of Soviet Jews, we are committed to closing that chapter and
moving toward further cooperation with your country.
Can we count on your help to achieve this goal together ?
