1990 ASSU RECALL ELECTION
ELECTION HANDBOOK
ISSUE ON THE BALLOT: "Do you wish to have the current COP, consisting
of Jamie Green, Goodwin Liu, Ingrid Nava, and J. Forrest Tucker, removed
from office, and to hold an election in the fall to fill the (COP) position?"
"THE ASSU has forgotten the students. Instead
of serving the interests of all students, it has served
only to further the interests of the party in power.
There has been no regard for democracy or fair play.
"In the recent election, the Senate went too far.
By installing 'Four our Future' as the COP-elect,
without the majority of the votes, the Senate showed
contempt for its own Bylaws and disenfranchised 273
students.
"That some of the 273 voted for cartoon
characters is irrelevant. Those voters are real
students whose votes count just as much as anyone
else's. And many of the 273 voted for real people.
Those ballots were not incorrectly marked; they were
legitimate expressions of opinion which cannot be
ignored simply because they threatened the power of
the ASSU incumbents.
"Now, the students have a chance to fight back.
By recalling the COP-elect, we can restore campus
democracy and send a message to the ASSU that
students have to come before politics.
"This recall is not intended to spite 'Four Our
Future.' We are not angry with them — only with
the way the Senate certified them as the winners.
Senators knew that a majority of the students wanted
write-in votes to count (the Daily poll showed
67.5%), but instead of counting those votes, they
decided to ignore their constituents' wishes. The
ASSU claims to represent democracy in education,
but apparently they must mean only certain kinds of
democracy.
"'Four Our Future' is free to run in another
election, if they are recalled, and if they win 50% of
that vote, only then should they be allowed to become
COP. It's understandable that 'Four Our Future'
wants to move forward. But before any COP slate
moves forward, it had better make sure that the
student body is moving forward along with it.
"It's time to show the ASSU that they can't just
do anything they want — when they put politics
ahead of people, the students must force them to
serve student interests and not their own partisan
interests.
"Send the Senate a message — play fair, or don't
play at all. Vote for responsible government that
follows the will of the students. Vote 'YES' in the
recall election."
— Stephen Schmidt, Students United for Fair Elections
"WHY YOU should vote NO on the recall:
"The Spring Elections were democratic. Elections
Commissioner Steve Krauss' ruling to throw out
votes for fictional characters was based on
consultation with past senate chairs, ASSU
Adminstrative Advisor Michael Ramsey-Perez, and
the California Registrar of Voters. Votes for fictional
characters have never been counted in Stanford
elections, nor are they counted in California election
procedures. Many students think that the ASSU
By-Laws need to be clarified on the issue of whether
or not votes for fictional characters should be
counted. We wholeheartedly agree. However, we
also believe that any clarification should not apply
retroactively.
"A recall is not a runoff. It is the democratic
means through which students can take a slate out of
office based on its performance. Four Our Future has
only been in office for a few weeks, performing its
expected duties such as staffing the Airport Shuttle,
helping the Nominations Commission to interview
students for University Committees, generating ideas
for next year, and coordinating our summer work
schedules.
"There would be no COP over the summer and a
costly new election. Recalling the COP would mean
that no one would serve as COP over the summer and
at the beginning of fall. Orientation, budgets,
financial aid info, Airport Shuttle, and Beat the
Bookstore would be neglected. A new election
would cost up to $8,000.
"Four Our Future is aware of our small margin of
victory and the need to build unity. After the
election, we started planning an ASSU Summit to
bring together ASSU staff, elected officials, and
campus leaders. The summit would serve as a forum
for discussing students' goals for the coming year,
ideas about building unity, and ways to make the
ASSU more effective. In the coming year, we want to
proceed with the summit, as well as initiate a COP
student advisory network and a student-run
Centennial task force.
"Four Our Future is qualified. As stated in the
Daily's April 16 endorsement of our slate, 'The
individual members of "Four Our Future" represent
an impressively diverse range of student interests.'
The spring election results indicated that the majority
of students who voted for real student leaders felt
that Four Our Future would do the best job as COP
Recalling Jamie, Goodwin, Ingrid, and Jay means
recalling 14 years of campus leadership experience.
"JUST SAY NO."
— Four Our Future
