BALTIC INDEPENDENCE ISNT A THREAT.
ITS AN ADVANTAGE.
The people of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia want to have good
relations with the Soviet Union. They want Americans to have good
relations with the Soviets. They also want peace, security and
prosperity throughout Europe.
But none of this is possible as long as the Soviet Union continues
its forcible occupation of the Baltic States.
That's why Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian independence is so
important for everyone.
?lease help us tell President Gorbachev that Baltic independence
isn't a threat. When you think about it, it's to everyone's advantage.
► It will enable the Soviet Union to focus on its real internal
problems. Like the economy. And political reform.
It will provide Moscow with three valuable new Western
trading partners. Free Baltic States will be productive and
cooperative neighbors.
It will pave the way for Most-Favored-Nation status and other
economic benefits from the United States. Good will from Moscow
deserves good will from Washington.
► And, it will end a political stalemate in US-USSR relations.
With independence restored to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,
Moscow and Washington will be able to work together for world
peace.
Join us on June 4th in a rally for peace, democracy and
independence in the Baltic States! It's to everyone's advantage.
