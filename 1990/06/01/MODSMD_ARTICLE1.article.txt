WHY STANFORD, Mr.
Gorbachev?
It's been more than
two weeks of drunken excite
ment since the University
heard of Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev's visit to Stan
ford on Monday.
But in the flurry of organ
izing for this Gorby-Stanford
love affair, one nagging ques
tion remains: Why on Earth
would the world's most promi
nent leader make a visit to the
Farm?
Mr. Gorbachev's San Fran
cisco lunch with U.S. business
leaders will give the top com
munist a chance to get some
tips from some of the most suc
cessful capitalists. The meet
ing, Mr. Gorbachev presumably
hopes, will build ties that will
allow the Soviet Union to
develop its economic muscles
as it struggles to find an eco
nomic identity.
But what does Stanford, of
all places, have to add to Mr.
Gorbachev's bag of desires?
Everyone knows it can't be
the chance to see the Hoover
Institution archives. He al
ready snubbed that opportu
nity.
And he surely doesn't think
he can use lessons learned from
the University's streamlining
to lift him from his domestic

economic quagmire.
One could make a convincing
argument that Mr. Gorbachev
is coming to build educational
ties with the United States. In
that case, Stanford would be
high on the list, if only for the
reason that most other schools
are out of session by now.
Perhaps Mr. Gorbachev just
wants to bask in what might
be short-lived glory. Indeed,
Mr. Gorbachev faces deep
troubles at home that could
spell the end to his rule in the
not-so-distant future.
But the Farm is a place
where the Soviet leader will
have his moment among this
nation's intellectual elite. He
will speak to a crowd of some
of the greatest thinkers in the
United States, as well as many
of the country's future leaders.
Via Soviet TV, radio and
newsprint, Gorbachev will get
an opportunity to shine above
the best that America has to
offer. He needs no better rea
son to visit the Farm.
We welcome you, Mr. Gorba
chev, with open arms.
