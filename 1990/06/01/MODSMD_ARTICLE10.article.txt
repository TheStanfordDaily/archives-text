# Med students try to combat racism
## Group hopes to rectify admissions policy for residents 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
Medical students from the Mi
nority Students Alliance met yes
terday to discuss strategies to
rectify what they consider racism
in the School of Medicine's admis
sions policy for hospital residents
and interns.
Milton Mills, former president
of the Stanford Medical Students
Association, said students have
been bringing up minority issues
to the Faculty Senate for the past
10 years, but nothing has been
accomplished.
"Basically, they committee us
to death," he said.
In a May 9 letter to The Daily,
Fernando Lopez, a member of the
alliance and president of the Stan
ford Raza Medical Association, a
Chicano/Latino medical student
group, stated, "Institutional rac
ism is openly supported, nurtured
and unashamedly practiced" in
the Medical School.
Lopez pointed out that the per
centage acceptance for minorities
whose first-choice school was
Stanford is substantially lower
than for white students.
At the meeting, the alliance
elected Mills to read the May 9
letter to the Faculty Senate next
Friday. The letter concludes that

The dean of the Medi
cal School objects to
'blunt, unjustified' al
legations but says he
will press for greater
minority recruitment.

"ethnicity is indeed a determining
factor" in the low percentage of
students of color in residency pro
grams.
Mills will also talk about the
struggles of minority students at
the Medical School in past years
and how their complaints have
often been ignored. The group is
urging all medical students to go
to the meeting.
Medical School Dean David
Korn said he does not believe ad
missions statistics support the
conclusion that discrimination
exists. In a letter addressed to all
medical students, Korn objected
to Lopez's "blunt, unjustified al
legation" and said he will press
for minority recruitment in all
areas of the Medical School.
Three groups at the Medical
Center have been at work since
January to build upon the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is-

Sues' recommendations for a
culturally diverse workplace,
Korn said.
Assoc. Dean for Graduate Med
ical Education Peter Gregory ex
plained that admissions
procedures for the more than 20
residency programs are so com
plex that merely looking at mi
nority acceptance percentages is
misleading.
For example, because a student
may not rank Stanford as first
choice, even if Stanford ranks a
student highly, he or she may not
end up at Stanford, Gregory said.
Currently, Gregory is chairing
the Planning Committee on
Recruitment of Minority Residen
ces and M.D. Postdoctoral
Fellows. One objective of the com
mittee is to research how affirm
ative action can be integrated into
the complicated admissions proc
ess, he said.
Gregory added that the percent
age of minority residents matches
the national pool, which proves
admissions procedures are color
blind. While affirmative action is
not effective for minority resident
admissions, Gregory asserted that
there is no discrimination either.
"Our goal is to increase minor
ity representation within five
years, so that the percentage will
represent the population at large."
