Arafat denies role in Israel raid
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Yasser Arafat said
yesterday that the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization was not involved in an attempted
guerrilla attack on Israel's coastline, but he
avoided condemning the act outright.
The Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO fac
tion, claimed responsibility for the attempted
raid Wednesday. Israeli forces foiled the raid
as the guerrillas headed for the Israeli coast
in six speedboats.
The PLF is headed by Mohammed Abbas,
who uses the nom de guerre Abul Abbas and
masterminded the Achille Lauro cruise ship
hijacking.
Asked whether he would expel Abbas from
the elected PLO Executive Committee for the
attempted raid, Arafat said: "He was elected
in a democratic way by the Palestine National
Council, and only the council has a say on
that."
Arafat, chairman of the PLO and recognized
by Arab countries as president of a state of
Palestine, said "we are a democratic organi
zation and decisions should be taken
democratically."
Israeli officials have urged the United States
to suspend its 17-month dialogue with the
PLO. They said the raid proved that Arafat
had violated his 1988 pledge to renounce ter
rorism. That pledge helped lead to the U.S.-
PLO dialogue.
The White House yesterday condemned the
failed guerrilla attack as a "cowardly attempt
to target innocent people."
But when asked if the dialogue with the
PLO was under review in light of the attack,
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
replied, "No, not at this point."
Labor unrest hits Belgium
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — Train traffic
was disrupted throughout the country yester
day as engine drivers began a two-day strike,
and air traffic controllers warned that they
would also strike.
The airport workers, set to begin interrmit
tent strikes today, and the railway workers
want better working conditions and more
money.
Teachers, also calling for better pay, dem
onstrated in the center of Brussels on yester
day, adding to the traffic mayhem caused by
the train strike.
Only a third of the trains were running,
causing delays of up to two hours during the
morning rush hour. It was the third
strike of train engine drivers since September.
Angolan civil war heats up
LIBBON, Portugal (AP) — Angolan rebels
and the Marxist government on yesterday re
ported clashes around the southern African
country, where fighting continues despite
peace talks aimed at ending the long civil war.
A rebel statement released in Lisbon said
the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, bombarded government
troops Tuesday in southern Cuando Cubango
province. Fifteen Angolan soldiers were killed,
the statement claimed.
Government units were forced out of their
positions Wednesday, the statement said.
In the central Huambo highlands, UNITA
claimed it captured the town of Alto-Hama on
Wednesday and killed 12 government fighters.
The Angolan state news agency ANGOP
claimed five rebels were killed in clashes Sun
day in Huambo province.
The same day, rebels killed five civilians
and wounded 24 in Cuando Cubango, and they
sabotaged water supplies to Huambo city, AN
GOP said.
UNITA receives about $50 million in U.S.
aid each year. It has been fighting to force a
power-sharing agreement with the Soviet-aided
government since shortly after Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
Peace talks to end the conflict resumed April
24 in Portugal, but a cease-fire has yet to be
signed.
Moldavia supports Lithuaina
MOSCOW (AP) — The legislature of Soviet
Moldavia on yesterday recognized Lithuania's
independence, the Tass news agency reported,
making it the first Soviet republic outside the
Baltics to do so.
The move by lawmakers in the southwestern
republic represented a direct challenge to So
viet President Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to
isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Soviet
Union.
According to the official news agency Tass,
deputies of the Moldavian Supreme Soviet,
meeting in the capital of Kishinev, favored
the establishment of direct diplomatic, eco
nomic, political and cultural relations with
Lithuania.
The legislature also proposed to exchange
"permanent missions" with the Lithuanian
parliament, or Supreme Council, Tass re
ported.
The news agency did not give vote totals on
the measure.
So far, only the Baltic republics of Latvia
and Estonia have formally acted to cooperate
on such levels with Lithuania. On May 12,
the three Baltic republics revived a 1934 po
litical alliance pledging mutual cooperation.
Like the Baltic states, the region that is
now Moldavia was forcibly annexed into the
Soviet Union by Josef Stalin in 1940.
Canada convicts coke smugglers
MONTREAL (AP) — Two Colombians and
a New Yorker, captured in Canada's largest
drug bust, were found guilty yesterday for
conspiring to traffic cocaine worth about $200
million.
The three face a maximum life sentence.
Moments before the jury's verdict was an
nounced, Ricardo Delgado Marquez, 24, of New
York, and Colombians Fernando William Men
doza Sala/ar, 27, and Flor E. Mery-Correa,
32, were seen laughing in the prisoners box.

Palestine, said "we are a democratic organi
zation and decisions should be taken
democratically."
Israeli officials have urged the United States
to suspend its 17-month dialogue with the
PLO. They said the raid proved that Arafat
had violated his 1988 pledge to renounce ter
rorism. That pledge helped lead to the U.S.-
PLO dialogue.
The White House yesterday condemned the
failed guerrilla attack as a "cowardly attempt
to target innocent people."
But when asked if the dialogue with the
PLO was under review in light of the attack,
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
replied, "No, not at this point."

Angolan civil war heats up
LIBBON, Portugal (AP) — Angolan rebels
and the Marxist government on yesterday re
ported clashes around the southern African
country, where fighting continues despite
peace talks aimed at ending the long civil war.
A rebel statement released in Lisbon said
the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, bombarded government
troops Tuesday in southern Cuando Cubango
province. Fifteen Angolan soldiers were killed,
the statement claimed.
Government units were forced out of their
positions Wednesday, the statement said.
In the central Huambo highlands, UNITA
claimed it captured the town of Alto-Hama on
Wednesday and killed 12 government fighters.
The Angolan state news agency ANGOP
claimed five rebels were killed in clashes Sun
day in Huambo province.
The same day, rebels killed five civilians
and wounded 24 in Cuando Cubango, and they
sabotaged water supplies to Huambo city, AN
GOP said.
UNITA receives about $50 million in U.S.
aid each year. It has been fighting to force a
power-sharing agreement with the Soviet-aided
government since shortly after Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
Peace talks to end the conflict resumed April
24 in Portugal, but a cease-fire has yet to be
signed.
Moldavia supports Lithuaina
MOSCOW (AP) — The legislature of Soviet
Moldavia on yesterday recognized Lithuania's
independence, the Tass news agency reported,
making it the first Soviet republic outside the
Baltics to do so.
The move by lawmakers in the southwestern
republic represented a direct challenge to So
viet President Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to
isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Soviet
Union.
According to the official news agency Tass,
deputies of the Moldavian Supreme Soviet,
meeting in the capital of Kishinev, favored
the establishment of direct diplomatic, eco
nomic, political and cultural relations with
Lithuania.
The legislature also proposed to exchange
"permanent missions" with the Lithuanian
parliament, or Supreme Council, Tass re
ported.
The news agency did not give vote totals on
the measure.
So far, only the Baltic republics of Latvia
and Estonia have formally acted to cooperate
on such levels with Lithuania. On May 12,
the three Baltic republics revived a 1934 po
litical alliance pledging mutual cooperation.
Like the Baltic states, the region that is
now Moldavia was forcibly annexed into the
Soviet Union by Josef Stalin in 1940.
