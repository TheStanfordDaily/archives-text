WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev grappled
over terms of German unity after an
opening round of summitry yesterday
that set the stage for mtyor agreements
on chemical and nuclear weapons.
Overall, Bush declared, "The mood is
very positive."
The two leaders began their talks
proclaiming a new era of cooperation
in spite of their differences. "The
trenches of the Cold War are disap
pearing," Gorbachev said.
Bush saluted Gorbachev's leadership
in a tacit boost for his plunging
popularity at home, and vowed to end
"decades of division and discord."
After nearly five hours of discus
sions, Bush and Gorbachev readily ac
knowledged they could not settle net
tlesome questions this week over the
military face of a unified Germany.
They instructed senior diplomats to
carry on the negotiations next week.
"It is not here that the German
question will be resolved," the Soviet
president told reporters as he left the
White House. Separately, Bush said,
"Certainly we're not going to solve the
whole issue at this summit."
Soviet and American officials said
new proposals will be discussed with
NATO allies and other countries.
"The ideas presented amount to a
way to meld the concerns of the United
States and the Soviet Union," White
House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said at a joint briefing with
Soviet spokesman Arkady Maslen
nikov. Neither spokesman would elab
orate on what Fitzwater called "new
ideas."
Secretary of State James Baker and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shev
ardnadze will take up the German
issue next week in Copenhagen during
a meeting of the 35-nation European
Security Conference and again in late
June at a gathering in Berlin.
Putting an upbeat spin on the sum
mit, Bush said, "I'd just say at the
end of a very interesting day that the
talks have gone reasonably well."
Gorbachev sprinkled the day with a
series of unexpected appearances that
have become his trademark.
As he did during his 1987 visit to
Washington, Gorbachev delighted a
downtown crowd by hopping out of
his limousine and shaking hands. The
throng of about 500 people cheered
and applauded. "Gorby, over here!"
some shouted.
Twice, he made a beeline to
reporters waiting in the White House
driveway for impromptu news confer
ences.
After largely ceding the limelight to

Gorbachev during the day, Bush made
an unscheduled appearance in the
Rose Garden to respond to questions.
"The talks have certainly gone as well
as I could have expected up to now,"
he said.
The White House said agreements
would be signed yesterday ending pro
duction of chemical weapons and
sealing the major elements of a treaty
to slash long-range nuclear arms. The
leaders will also commit themselves to
deeper cuts in the years ahead.
Hopes faded for progress on reduc
ing tanks and troops in Europe, an
issue intertwined with the thornier
question of German unity.
Bush said he had not changed his
demand that a united German be a
full member of NATO, the Western
political and military alliance. Just as
adamantly, Gorbachev has opposed
NATO membership for a new Ger
many, or alternately suggested that
the combined country's military forces
be reduced.
Bush said he spoke frankly with
Gorbachev. "He didn't seem to take
offense at anything. ... I feel very com

fortable with him. I feel very free to
bring up positions that I know he
doesn't agree with," Bush said.
Gorbachev said he and Bush "un
derstand each other's concerns better"
and the two sides exchanged new ideas.
The Soviet leader said he and Bush
discussed the subject in detail. "What
President Bush is doing is probably
defending his viewpoint. I think that
dictating is unacceptable," he said.
Gorbachev and Bush opened their
summit with 2 hours and 15 minutes
of private talks, accompanied only by
translators and note-takers. A second
meeting in the afternoon ran more
than two hours.
In a toast at a formal dinner in
Gorbachev's honor, Bush said the
various agreements they would sign
this evening were "proof that differ
ences can be resolved, even while
others remain."
Noting the changes sweeping East
ern Europe and the Soviet Union,
Bush said, "Such profound change is
unsettling but also exhilarating. We
do not shrink from the challenges
before us but welcome them, deter

mined to build the foundations of en
during peace and security."
The summit yeste/day began with
trumpet fanfares and a 21-gun salute
and ended with a gala black-tie dinner
at the White House featuring a menu
of Maine lobster and entertainment by
American opera singer Frederica von
Stade, one of the world's foremost
mezzo-sopranos.
Apart from the summit, Gorbachev
hosted American celebrities and think
ers at a Soviet embassy luncheon that
turned into a testimonial of the Soviet
leader's difficult tenure. Before an au
dience that included Frank Sinatra,
Jane Fonda, Jesse Jackson and Henry
Kissinger, Gorbachev spoke movingly
of his deepening economic and political
problems amid the reforms.
"This is a decisive moment," Gor
bachev said. "We have no other way
to proceed and there is no turning
back."
"We are now at a watershed," he
said. "We had different camps, differ
ent civilizations, but, well, we found
out that we live in one world, in one
civilization."
