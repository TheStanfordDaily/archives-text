# Thousands of U.S. Marines set sail for Liberia

### 
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - Rebel
troops advanced to within 25 miles of
the capital yesterday, and the Penta
gon announced that a U.S. navy flotilla
with more than 2,000 Marines was off
Liberia in case American citizens need
to be evacuated.
President Samuel Doe on Thursday
refused to resign despite the advance
of the insurgents, and vowed to be the
last person to l?ave the city.
"Tough times never last. Tough
people do," Doe told a group of foreign
ambassadors, according to one envoy
at the meeting.
His statements heightened fears of
a bloody conflict if the two armies
clash in the West African capital. So
far, more than 1,000 people have been
killed in the 5-month-old rebellion,
most of them civilians slain by gov
ernment troops.
Cmdr. David Thomas, a spokesman
for the Defense Department, said the
U.S. flotilla includes a destroyer, an
amphibious assault ship, a tank land
ing ship and other support vessels car
rying ammunition and combat sup
plies.
Also aboard are 179 Marine officers
and 2,102 enlisted men, Thomas said.
About 10,000 Americans, mostly
businessmen and missionaries, are in

Liberia.
The 11 U.N. expatriate workers in
Liberia evacuated the country yester
day for security reasons.
Terry Lewis, coordinator of the U.N.
Disaster Relief Organization, said they
were sad to leave. "We had a lot of
work to do here. People won't starve
yet, but there are going to be some
very hungry people."
Lewis said they hoped to return,
"possibly in a few weeks when the
security situation improves."
Doe spoke with diplomats who
protested an attack on the U.N. com
pound Wednesday by soldiers carrying
out reprisals against unarmed
civilians.
According to ambassadors at the
meeting, Doe promised to send troops
to protect diplomatic missions. But one
envoy told The Associated Press they
were trying to find a diplomatic way
to refuse the offer.
"The last thing we want is unruly
armed Doe soldiers. We would rather
have policemen," said the diplomat,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Doe was defiant during the meeting,
despite a promise he made to a rally
Friday that he would make any
sacrifice, including stepping down, if
it helped end bloodshed.

"He said he would not resign but
would be the last person to leave," the
diplomat said.
Doe's ministers appeared not to be
as resolute. Hotel owners said many
had moved into their establishments,
fearing to sleep in their houses where
they could be rebel targets.
Rumors in Monrovia said Doe forced
his ministers to hand in their pass
ports to prevent them from leaving
the country.
Rebel leader Charles Taylor said in
an interview with the British Broad
casting Corp. yesterday that he would
not be satisfied with Doe's resignation.
The rebels have accused Doe's admin
istration of corruption, economic mis
management and human rights
abuses.
Taylor, who said he was calling the
BBC from the port of Buchanan, said
his fighters would not stop until they
had taken Monrovia and formed their
own government. Taylor's fighter" cap
tured the country's main port of Bu
chanan, 95 miles east of the capital,
five days ago.
Rebels were reported to be ambush
ing troops within a few miles of
Robertsfield International Airport, 20
miles from the capital.
In Monrovia, there were reports that

members of Doe's Krahn tribe and
Mandingos, who are accused of sup
porting Krahns and exploiting other
tribes, were trying to evacuate for fear
that rebels would attack the capital.
Many of the rebels are members of
the Gio and Mano tribes, who last
week were the target of attacks that
killed 11 people.
U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani
said about eight soldiers wearing
masks forced their way Wednesday
into the U.N. compound in Monrovia,
where 1,000 refugees had gathered to
demand protection and safe conduct
out of the country.
Giuliani said the soldiers killed one
guard and wounded another, then ab
ducted about 30 people. The bodies of
three abducted men and a youth were
found later dumped outside the capi
tal. Doe denied responsibility and said
he would punish those responsible.
Doe seized power as a master ser
geant in a bloody 1980 coup that
ousted elitist descendants of slaves
who discriminated against native
Liberians. Liberia, a country of 2 mil
lion, was founded by freed American
slaves in 1847.
The rebellion began Dec. 24 with
an invasion of 200 rebels from Ivory
Coast.

In Monrovia, there were reports that

members of Doe's Krahn tribe and
Mandingos, who are accused of sup
porting Krahns and exploiting other
tribes, were trying to evacuate for fear
that rebels would attack the capital.
Many of the rebels are members of
the Gio and Mano tribes, who last
week were the target of attacks that
killed 11 people.
U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani
said about eight soldiers wearing
masks forced their way Wednesday
into the U.N. compound in Monrovia,
where 1,000 refugees had gathered to
demand protection and safe conduct
out of the country.
Giuliani said the soldiers killed one
guard and wounded another, then ab
ducted about 30 people. The bodies of
three abducted men and a youth were
found later dumped outside the capi
tal. Doe denied responsibility and said
he would punish those responsible.
Doe seized power as a master ser
geant in a bloody 1980 coup that
ousted elitist descendants of slaves
who discriminated against native
Liberians. Liberia, a country of 2 mil
lion, was founded by freed American
slaves in 1847.
The rebellion began Dec. 24 with
an invasion of 200 rebels from Ivory
Coast.
