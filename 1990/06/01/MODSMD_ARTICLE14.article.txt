Attacker pleads guilty
NEW YORK (AP) - An 18-year
old charged in the Central Park "wild
ing" case pleaded guilty to assault
yesterday in connection with an at
tack on a male jogger the same night
a female jogger was nearly killed.
The defendant, Michael Briscoe,
had not been charged in the infamous
April 19, 1989, gang rape and beating
attack on the woman investment
banker, who was left for dead.
Briscoe pleaded guilty to one count
of second-degree assault, the top
count in his indictment, before state
Supreme Court Justice Thomas Gal
ligan. The charge related to an attack
by a gang of youths on David Lewis,
31, a banker who was jogging in the
park the same night the woman was
attacked.
Galligan sentenced Briscoe to one
year in prison in connection with the
assault on Lewis. He could have been
sentenced to seven years in prison
on the second-degree assault charge.

At the same time, Galligan sen
tenced him to one year for his guilty
plea of May 7 to a charge of fifth
degree criminal sale of a controlled
substance. That charge related to
Briscoe's selling a small quantity of
PCP, or "angel dust," to an under
cover police officer on March 4.
Galligan ordered the sentences to
run concurrently.
Magi Can promo fizzles
ATLANTA (AP) - The Coca-Cola
Co. said yesterday it is ending its
"Magi Can" promotion after bad
publicity over mechanical problems
with some of the prize-filled soft
drink cans.
The company had intended to dis
tribute 750,000 of the special cans
throughout the summer, but spokes
man Randy Donaldson confirmed
that shipments had been halted.
About 200,000 cans have been
shipped so far, he said.
"We are winding it down early,"

Donaldson said.
The promotion, part of a $100 mil
lion "Magic Summer" campaign that
also includes prize-bearing cups and
an endorsement by the pop group
New Kids on The Block, has been
plagued by reports of defective cans.
Though only about 70 complaints
had been received by Coke,
Donaldson said, "There is the im
pression we don't like among our
consumers that there is a problem
with the promotion."
The randomly distributed prize
cans look like regular cans of Coca-
Cola Classic but contain a mechanism
that ejects either cash or prize cer
tificates. The bottom end of the can
was filled with chlorinated water to
make it feel like the real thing.
