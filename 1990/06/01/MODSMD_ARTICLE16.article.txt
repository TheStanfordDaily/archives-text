## SLACing off 
### 
WE HAVE A problem on our
hands. The recently re
leased study on working
conditions at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center is deeply trou
bling and reveals evidence of man
agement practices that are not
acceptable in our community.
For years, workers at SLAC have
voiced complaints about mistreat
ment by their supervisors.
Now, the study by an outside
consulting firm appears to validate
those concerns. The finding that
43 percent of the workers are dis
satisfied with an intimdating man
agement style is quite alarming.
In order to quickly rectify this
problem, immediate action is called
for. Given the pervasiveness of the
problem, outside supervision of the
reform efforts appears to be war

ranted. The University should an
nounce its acceptance of the study
and declare its intentions for bring
ing about reform.
The most productive working en
vironments are those where the
workers feel involved and
respected and part of a team. To
forge a sense of cohesion and to
rebuild trust with the management
in the future, the workers should
be integrally involved in developing
remedies to the current deplorable
situation.
Now that the problems have
been documented and proven, all
parties must put aside egos and
concern for image and make a good
faith commitment to moving for
ward.
Once change begins at SLAC, we
hope to see it rapidly accelerate.
