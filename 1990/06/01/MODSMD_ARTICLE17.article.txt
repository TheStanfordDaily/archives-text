# A 						new standard

### 
AND NOW, IT'S law. After
more than two years of
sometimes heated and con
troversial debate over how to
balance the right to freedom from
harassment with the right to free
speech, the University appears to
have settled on an interpretation
of the Fundamental Standard.
We sincerely hope that it works.
Stanford is not alone in trying
to grapple with this important
debate; much of the higher educa
tion community has sought to
fashion policies appropriate for
academic communities.
Other universities, like the Uni
versity of Michigan, have had prob
lems with implementation that
include white students distorting
the intent of the law and bringing
charges against students of color.
We trust that the lengthy delibera
tions and extensive involvement of
law professors will help us avoid

similar problems.
The end of the deliberation proc
ess really just marks the beginning
of our efforts to forge a model
campus climate. Legal proceedings
are no substitute for education, ra
tional discussion and mutual
sharing of ideas and cultures.
An important step in continuing
our progress is to develop some
mechanism to monitor the severity
of the problem of harassment and
discrimination. One idea that has
been previously raised is the es
tablishment of a Human Relations
Commission which would develop
policies and monitor practices of
the campus community.
We think this idea merits further
exploration.
These measures, if sincerely fol
lowed, will do much to create the
kind of community where no one's
rights are abridged and everyone's
dignity is respected.
