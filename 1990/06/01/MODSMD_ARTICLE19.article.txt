I REFUSE TO write anything about
the League of Revolutionary
Struggle. It's a matter of principle:
If everyone else is writing about it, I
won't. That's all there is to it.
Besides, I have no respect for any group
of people who believe they can achieve a
socialist state by taking over the ASSU.
Now there's a bunch of egregiously
deluded revolutionaries.
See, in the miserable annals of the
Earth, I can't imagine that this group is
even going to get a chapter. The Renais
sance, however, should definitely get a
chapter. If for nothing else, staying power.
The Renaissance has been on my mind
lately, because it keeps popping up where
I least expect it.
I'm talking specifically about three in
stances that I'm having trouble reconcil
ing. These come in the form of three
people: incoming ASSU Senate Chair
Solina Kwan, perennial resident assistant
and Stanford Law Review editor Shauna
Jackson and front-page prankster and
Council of Presidents recall-spearhead
Perry Friedman.
What these three people have in com
mon is that each described him or herself
as "a Renaissance man" or "a Renais
sance woman." This, in my mind, is an
affront to the Renaissance.
Now we all know what they meant
when each of them said this terrible
thing. They meant, "I am so very active
on campus that a mere Daily reporter
could not hope to successfully document
my extensive series of sallies and con
quests."

In other words, as Renaissance people
they are so multi faceted that they can
pay themselves compliments better than
almost anyone else, except maybe another
Renaissance person.
Which brings to mind an interesting
question: would Solina, Shauna and
Perry call one another Renaissance
people? My guess is yes, as long as each
of them could be certain that the other
two would reciprocate in kind.
It's not unreasonable that each of these
subjects questioned the Daily reporter's
ability to do them justice, but I do find
it obnoxious that they chose to associate
themselves with "a revival period of prog
ress and style in art and architecture."
Because I bet not even one of them
paints. Show me your fresco and you can
call yourself a Renaissance person. I'll
settle for an unfinished marble statue,
even.
But until that time I think that as a
description, "Renaissance person" should
be applied to you by someone other than
yourself. I can't imagine Leonardo Da
Vinci sitting in his studio in Italy going,
"Da Vinci: Renaissance Guy ... I like
the sound of that."
Being multifaceted is good. So is being
talented, ambitious and competitive.
Being self-aggrandizing and egomaniacal
to the point of complimenting yourself
in print is probably bad; if, for no other
reason, because others might mock you.
In print, even.
Here's another case: Stacey Leyton. In
her Viewpoint article of May 25, Stacey
never once called herself a Renaissance

woman. Hurray for Stacey!
She did, however, mention what I imag
ine occupies a substantial portion of her
resumS: Ex-COP member, ex-ASSU
senator, RA, Dean's Award for Service,
Phi Beta Kappa, et al., ad nauseam. Well
that's nice and all, but you never said
whether or not you were a communist
or a member of the League, Stacey —
you just talked about yourself a whole lot.
I don't think people care one way or
the other, to be perfectly honest: is being
a part of the People's Platform any less
pejorative than being a communist? Prob
ably more so — there are many brilliant
people I associate with communism, but
there aren't any I associate with the
People's Platform.
Damn. I said I wasn't going to talk
about the League and I did — I don't
know how it got in here but geez, I guess
it's everywhere.
The point I was making was do your
own thing, but don't toot your own horn.
Personally, all these self-described Re
. naissance people are confusing me, and
I think we could probably do with some
"Age of Reason" people to straighten
them out.
