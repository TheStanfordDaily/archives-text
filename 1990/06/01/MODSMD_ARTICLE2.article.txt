### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The budget repositioning steer
ing committee has accepted the
final list of budget cuts submitted
by the Office of Student Affairs,
clearing the way for their imple
mentation.
Although the final proposal
must still be approved by the
Board of Trustees, as it now
stands, the proposal will cut about
$1.4 million from the Student Af
fairs budget â€” meeting the target
goal of a 15 percent reduction. In
addition, 18 regular staff mem
bers and about 51 student staff
members will probably be laid off
over the next two years.

Student Affairs will also elimi
nate another 11 staff positions
through attrition, said Susan Em
pey, Student Affairs budget direc
tor. Empey said she hopes that
attrition next year will further
reduce the actual number of
layoffs.
The steering committee did not
change many of the cuts from the
proposal submitted by Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons June
18. However, Student Affairs now
faces the task of implementing the
cuts and the staff layoffs that will
accompany them.
The Student Affairs proposal
divides the cuts into 22 separate
actions, some of which will take
effect in September and others in

September 1991.
In the only mayor change from
Lyons' proposal, Student Affairs
will delay a proposed reduction in
childcare services, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Margaret Ann
Fidler said. "We hope to find a
better way" to cut these programs
during the next year, she added.
Eight of the 18 regular staff
layoffs will be made by reducing
and contracting out Tresidder
Union custodial services, begin
ning in September, according to
Tresidder director Bobbi Braden.
Braden noted the outside con
tractor will probably hire the
workers who are laid off by the
