## Only when disease is diagnosed will healing begin 
### 
I AM WRITING to express my
support for Delia Ibarra, Richard
Suh, Rudy Fuentes and others who
have gone public about their negative
experiences with the members of the
League of Revolutionary Struggle.
While I was never formally recruited
into the League, I did feel intense
pressure to conform to the group when
I was very involved in MEChA my
first year at Stanford. I walked away
from MEChA my sophomore year
because of that pressure, even though
1 did, and still do, believe in the goals
of MEChA as an organization.
There were other reasons why I left,
including the ambiguity of leadership
and responsibility (at the time, there
were no MEChA officers) and the
terrible treatment of students who
disagreed with some MEChistas. When

I don't have problems with League members because
they believe in Marxist/Leninist principles. My problem
with League members is their harsh treatment of
people who disagree with them.

I left MEChA, I experienced harrass
ment and ostracism similar to Delia's,
but I could not remain associated with
the organization and still retain my
self-respect.
I struggled with my decision to
speak to The Daily and again with my
decision to write this letter. I do not
want to hurt progressive politics at
Stanford. I have many friends who
strongly believe in Marxism, and they

would testify that I am quite progres
sive in my own politics.
I don't have problems with League
members because they believe in Marx
ist/Leninist principles. My problem
with League members is their harsh
treatment of people who disagree with
them.
No one should be subject to the
social and political pressure they im
pose on other students, especially when

those students are often other progres
sive students who are alienated from
the political forum at Stanford.
1 am glad Delia, Richard and other
students had the courage to speak out.
I can finally be honest about why I
left MEChA.
I, too, was silent because I was
afraid no one would believe me if I
told the truth, and I was also afraid of
what would be done to me or my
friends if I did speak out.
I am sick of being silent and afraid.
We have now diagnosed the disease,
and if people will only believe and
admit that the disease exists, we can
begin the process of healing.
