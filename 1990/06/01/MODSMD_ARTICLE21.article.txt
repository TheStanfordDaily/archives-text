# Students need to know true effects of League influence
## 
### 
Once again, The Daily has given a
lot of column space to those who enjoy
prating about the topic of current
debate.
This month it's the League of
Revolutionary Struggle and the recruit
ment policies of the same. We must
abandon the chaff involving journalistic
integrity, McCarthyism and bigotry and
ask what serious effects the League
has on our lives.
It is clear that the League is under
mining the student of color organiza
tions on this campus. The League's
thirst for power, its selective recruit
ment and ridiculous secrecy combine to
divide groups on this campus that fill
valuable societal needs and pursue

legitimate political goals.
This is a real concern, and in my
mind it is the only one.
The League may control the student
government, but given the effectiveness
of the ASSU Senate, it is difficult for
me to care. Because I choose not to
participate by voting, I cannot receive
fee refunds even though I never
receive services from the ASSU.
To me, this equates the ASSU with
the annoying mandolin player in the
Italian restaurant — you give him
money and he goes away and bothers
somebody else.
But by saying this I don't mean to
speak for the entire student body. If
you care where your ASSU fees have
been going, I highly recommend that
you make the People's Platform Coun
cil of Presidents account for every cent
they have been given.
Some students feel that the League's
agenda is a threat to the federal gov
ernment as well. Don't worry. It is
clear to me that these revolutionaries
don't have their act together enough to

achieve their nationalist goals.
We live in America, and here any
group like the League that does get its
act together is quickly infiltrated and
blown to bits by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
