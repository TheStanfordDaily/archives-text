# University should focus on truth, not good publicity
## 
### 
Universities are supposed to be in
the business of truth-telling, not put
ting the "correct" spin on stories when
things go wrong.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, duly supported by Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert Freelen,
denied to The Daily that my letter to
Mikhail Gorbachev influenced the can

collation of the Soviet President's visit
to Hoover.
How does Kennedy know? I cannot
say for sure that my letter had any
influence, but, if Kennedy was quoted
correctly, how can he say it didn't?
Unbecoming efforts to shape public
opinion are standard practice for corpo
rations. Universities charged with
educating students should uphold a
higher standard.
