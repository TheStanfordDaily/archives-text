## Elsa Tsutaoka Students should be remembered for changing society for the better 
### 
BY NATURE I am not a very
public person. Usually I am
content to work hard and con
tribute the bit that I can to building a
better University and a fairer society.
But since my name has recently been
splashed across the pages of The Stan
ford Daily, I feel that I am forced to
respond. I want to be remembered not
for some unproven allegations against
me but for all the work that I have
done and the respect and influence
that I have earned through my work.
It is ironic to me that this mess
with The Daily comes so close to
Memorial Day. Each year during
Memorial Day weekend in my home
town of Lodi, Calif., members of the
Japanese-American community gather
for a service at the cemetery. During
these times, I often remember my
Oji-chan (the Japanese term for grand
father) and how during World War II
he was arrested and villified for doing
nothing except seeking to build a
stronger Japanese-American communi
ty.
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
there was justified concern about
Japan that got unjustly transferred
onto the Japanese community here in
America. The United States govern
ment played upon the atmosphere of
racist hysteria and proceeded to round
up and place into jail all the respected
community leaders. My grandfather
was included in this grouping.
What had he done? He had demon
strated that he was someone the com
munity could count on and trust, and
he earned every ounce of respect and
influence accorded to him. For this, my
grandfather was imprisoned, classified
as "enemy alien" and labeled a threat
and subversive. He was imprisoned
without ever having been proven guilty

of doing something wrong. He died
never understanding why the United
States government could treat him as
if he were guilty when he was not.
Because of the recent articles in The
Daily, I now have a deeper sense of
the iryustices done to my grandfather
and have a deeper sense of gratitude
and respect for him. It is ironic that
nearly 50 years after my grandfather
was uryustly persecuted, I am in a
similar situation.
I came to Stanford unsure of
whether or not I wanted to really be
here. I often felt alone and alienated.
All around me, I felt I was being told
that Asian Americans had no place at
Stanford .. . not in the curriculum and
not in terms of University support for
our center (at the time, the Asian
American Activities Center received no
University support and was located in
what was a delapidated Old Firehouse).
In the ASSU one year, the Asian
American Student Association and the
student-run AAAC received a $0.00
recommendation from the Program
Board.
As I became involved in the Asian-
American community, I found a sense
that I did belong, that my experiences
in Lodi and my family's experiences
meant something. From my frosh year
here, I worked to increase the Univer
sity's commitment to the Asian-
American community.
During my time as a student and
continuing to today, I like and read
Unity newspaper because it covers
what people like me and my grandfa
ther are working on doing to make our
society more fair. I really liked the
socialist concept of a fair society where
people receive what they do based
upon how hard they worked. I talk a
lot about politics, then and today.

Richard Suh, I and others participated
in many discussions and even discus
sion groups where we talked about
racism in America, Marxism, socialism
and ideas for changing society.
After I graduated, a conscious part
of my decision to dciay going to medi
cal school and not to continue working
at a Biotech company was that I felt
that it was an exciting time for Asian-
Americans at Stanford and for Stan
ford University. In addition, there were
a number of students and friends
(including Richard Suh) who asked me
to stay on at Stanford because they
valued my opinions and experience. As
a staff person, I have continued to work
to strengthen the Asian-American
community and in turn Stanford.
My agenda has always been clear and
open, and my workstyle has been
demonstrated in what I do. I have
always worked for a fairer, equal soci
ety and have been willing to work with
everyone. Whether it meant working to
see the University divest South Africa,
working to establish the University
Committee on Minority Issues or a
University-supported Asian American
Activities Center and a full-time dean
position, opening up the ASSU, lobby
ing for Redress and Reparations for
interned Japanese Americans, working
on the 10,000-person education confer
ence, participating in the Asian Staff
Forum or raising money for the Uni
versity through the Stanford
Asian/Pacific American Alumni Club, I
have worked hard and gained valuable
experience and, yes, respect and influ
ence in the comunity. None of my
work stems from a peripheral agenda
and it is not a secret.
So if my beliefs are no secret and
my actions are no secret, why am I
guilty? The Daily article proves noth-

ing except that some people are willing
to find me guilty of being some kind
of monster to erase all the good work
that I and many others have done at
Stanford. This is not in the tradition
of the open and free Stanford commu
nity. In fact I was never even asked
about any of what I have just written.
The Daily merely wove an intricately
detailed web to trap me and others in
its stories. We were presumed guilty
from the beginning and it did not
matter what we said.
In one irresponsibly printed article,
The Daily has sought to erase every
thing that I have done and all who I
am. This is because for an attack like
this to work, the attackers must make
me into a monster. This is the only
thing that would justify treating an
other human being so callously. I must
say that it is beginning to take its toll
on me. Some people will not even
acknowledge the fact that I exist by
looking at me, speaking to me or just
even saying hello. I sense people want
to stay away from me and to distance
themselves from all that I have done
in the community. I don't blame these
people though, but rather the hysteric
atmosphere created by The Daily's
irresponsible reporting.
But once again I can remember and
draw strength from my grandfather.
During World War 11, other Asian
nationalities wore buttons such as "I
am Chinese" to distance themselves
from Japanese-Americans. My grandfa
ther did not seem to blame them, but
rather the hysteria of the time. He
sought to move on, to continue to
build the community as best he knew
how.
And despite what some may claim,
this is tearing apart our communities
and is hurting multiculturalism at

Stanford. I have seen individuals point
ing fingers at other individuals. I have
seen individuals beginning to question
why they supported the demand for
just ONE tenure-track Asian-American
history professor and start to imply
that perhaps it was OK that a History
Department faculty member told us
that the history of Asian-Americans is
not significant.
Students and staff may now be more
reluctant to advocate for change for
fear of being labeled a secret commu
nist. I am worried about how much
more some of us will have to deny our
own just motivations so we will not be
accused of being secretive communists?
In closing, I want to say that I want
to be remembered for my work, my
contributions and my commitment to
building a more just, equal and fair
society. My contributions at Stanford
have been to build a community of
friends, where all voices can be heard,
where each individual can realize his
or her fullest potential and the best in
each individual can shine through
despite racist stereotypes that try to
cast us all as the same.
I gain strength from the example of
my grandfather, and I know that I
stand in the tradition of a lot of un
sung, unknown individuals who will
seek to do the right thing to make the
lives of everyone better. For in the
end, those who care to will remember
people like Oji-chan and I out of re
spect for what we've done and with
compassion for our efforts to change
society for the better.

Elsa Tsutaoka graduated from Stan
ford in 1987. She is currently the office
manager for the Asian American Activ
