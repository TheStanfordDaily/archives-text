Out of 1,300 applicants, only
560 men and women received ac
ceptance letters from Stanford for
fall quarter 1927
Registrar J. P. Mitchell ex
pressed regret at the small num
ber of spaces open to the students,
especially the women. However,
he explained that vacancies for
women were becoming scarcer
every year, as fewer were disqual
ified and more came back for
graduate work.
I wonder what applications were
like in those days. They probably
asked corny questions like: Why
do you want to go to Stanford?
What makes you think you're so
qualified you could get in? And,
probably instead of writing "Good
Job" or "Excellent" on the letters
of acceptance, they probably wrote
something dull like "Hey dude,
you've been accepted."

In an attempt to surpass the
USC marching outfit in both size
and playing ability, the Stanford
Band purchased 120 new uni
forms. Although the designs of
the uniforms were still secret,
they were supposed to be even
flashier than those of the Trojans,
said manager Don Wells.
It looks like the Band has a
dark past it doesn't like to admit.
1 guess at one point it just gave
up trying to outdo the Trojans in
appearance and talent and
decided to become a subversive or
ganization of malcontents. After
all, why do they wear red?

Twelve sophomores from
Durand House visited the resi
dence of "San Francisco
Chronicle" columnist Herb Caen
to protest an alleged abuse of free
dom of the press. After tracking
Caen down, the students splashed
him with a pitcher of ice water.
The students were responding
to a bad joke about immoral "por

poises" published in Caen's
column. Since a student from
their residence had been thrown
in a shower twice for telling that
very joke, the students felt that
they had a precedent to uphold.
Repeating the joke may be dan
gerous especially if those people
are still around. Bad jokes are
undermining the fabric of our uni
versity. They obstruct the free and
open exchange of ideas and
threaten the sanity of community
members. Any new Fundamental
Standard interpretations should
deal with this important issue.

The ASSU Senate was kicked
out of its meeting place in the
Graduate School of Business be
cause of a pie fight at the previous
week's meeting.
According to incoming senate
chair Eric Berg, an altercation be
tween unidentified pie-throwers
and members of the senate caused
the Business School to evict the
senate.
Barbara Taddeo, the building
manager of the Business School
said the ASSU would "absolutely,
positively not be able to meet
there the next year."
Let's make this ASSU Appreci
ation Week. I would like them to
know how much I really would
miss the ASSU if it disappeared.
The ASSU Shuttle is real handy,
and the T-shirt shop loses all our
money, but it is all a fee refund
to me (sing to the tune of some
Billy Joel song).
