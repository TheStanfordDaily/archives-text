Dear Bug,
On the Stanford seal right below the
tree there is this saying in German that
reads "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht. * What
does it mean, why is it in German and
why is it there anyway?
— Curious in the Wurst way
Speaking of the Stanford seal, didn't
I read something recently in The Daily
about El Palo Alto, the tree that suppos
edly is the Stanford symbol? The article
told of a Spanish explorer named Gaspar
de Portola who "discovered" and
"named" the tree in 1769. I can just
picture that ...
"Que tal, Mr. Conquistador?" (This is
all translated, of course.)
"We had a good day today, Paco."
"Did you discover the Fountain of
Youth or ancient civilizations with peace
ful natives to slaughter and gold to steal
and make us sickeningly rich, seiior?"
"No, no. Something much more impor
tant, Paco. We discovered a redwood tree
in that forest over there and we named
it - The Tall Tree."
Anyways' back to the question. Before
I was admitted to Special Collections, I
had to produce a valid driver's license,
valid student ID, valid note from my
mother and a valid reason. It took the
lady behind the desk almost 20 minutes
to find the book that was "too
voluminous" to read over the phone.
The phrase "Die Luft der Freiheit

weht" came from the French phrase
"Payez plus pour moins." (translation:
pay more for less).
No, actually Ulrich von Hutten uttered
those words, or something like them,
when Luther was being prosecuted. He
said, "Don't you know that the winds of
freedom are blowing?" The first president
of Stanford, David Starr Jordan read that
phrase to Leland Stanford who was re
portedly "very impressed" with it. The
phrase is only on the President's seal and
not on the official seal. The Registrar's
Office has its own seal that replaces the
tree with a big dollar sign.
Dear Bug,
Has anyone ever gotten "an eye poked
out" by a paper airplane at Sunday flicks,
or is it still all fun and games?
— Cyclops
According to the man in charge of that
riotous and raucous Sunday event, the
most common ailment at the flicks is

paranoia. "We've had contacts popped out
and paper cuts on tongues," Jay Goldin
told me, "but no eyes poked out. We're
trying to make a kinder, gentler Sunday
Flicks by instituting pillow fights . . . and
if you take a date — go to the early
show." So it's still all fun and games
until somebody falls ofT the balcony. Oh
and by the way, the flick has been can
celed for Sunday. Don't miss the Monday
double feature of Always and Spinal Tap,
two shows that go "oh so well together."

your pillow.
Dear Bug,
A few years ago, red M & M's made
a comeback. However there are still no
light brown (or "tan") peanut M & M's,
although this color exists for the plain
kind. Why is this?
— DA
The Stanford Daily receives about
$25,000 annually from student fees, so
I figured spending about a buck fifty of
that as research costs was pretty mini
mal. Sure enough, there are tan plain M
& M's but no tan peanut M & M's. I
sorted them all by color and fed all the
green ones to the woman on the computer
next to me.
I then proceeded to spend some more
of that hard-earned student funding by
making a long distance phone call to the
M & M manufacturers. Bob, hereby
dubbed Mr. M & M, told me the weather
in New Jersey was pretty miserable. He
also said the colors were based on con
sumer preference tests.
Here's the breakdown: Peanut M &
M's have just in the past two weeks been
changed to 20 percent of all five colors
(brown, yellow, green, red, orange). The
plain M & M's are 30 percent brown, 20

percent yellow and green and 10 percent
orange, green and tan. So here's a good
party theme — buy more M & M's than
you feel is safe to consume, pour them
all over the floor, sort them by color and
sue the M & M manufacturers if the
percentages are wrong.
The woman next to me keeps asking
for more green M & M's.
Anyway, the decision is based on what
looks "appealing and appetizing." Placing
an orange pellet in my mouth about the
size of a rabbit terd is supposed to be
more appealing than, oh, say a blue rabbit
terd. "Consumers must have a problem
with tan peanut M & M's," according to
Mr. M & M. I told Mr. M & M this was
a boring answer. "I'm looking for some
thing more along the lines of deaths and
calamities associated with tan peanut M
& M's." To console me he said that from
1940 to 1949 there was a violet color
that was eventually replaced by the tan
color.
"That won't do," I said. "I want a
tragedy or a miracle."
"How about this. We produce 100 mil
lion M & M's a day."
"Call me back," I told Mr. M & M,
"when an apparition of the Madonna is
seen at a local 7-11 with a tan peanut
M & M in one hand while muttering
'Look, it melts in your mouth - not in
your hand!' " Then I hung up on him.
Dear Bug,
I was wondering about the two statues
that sit perched precariously at either
side of the Jordan Hall sign outside the
Psychology Department. Exactly how
securely are these guys attached to the
building? And in view of the recent quake,
how safe would I be if I were walking
underneath them and another big one
hit?
— Fearful

Mr. Bug,
How long has that yo-yo been dangling
from the finger of the statue on the third
floor facade of the Psych building? Rumor
has it the toy belonged to ol' Leland Jr.
himself.
— Don't leave me Hangin'
Fearful, you must be 1) a freshman or
2) a very inattentive non-Californian.
YOU'RE NOT SAFE UNDER ANY
THING DURING A BIG EARTH
QUAKE, YOU BOZO!
The statues look firmly attached, but
I thought I'd perform a few stability tests
— I started throwing rocks at the statues.
Unfortunately, I didn't get very far before
somebody came out of the building
screaming, "Just what the hell are you
doing!?"
"Is this a trick question?" I asked.
You see, I don't have very good aim,
and to make a long story longer, the one
time I did hit the statue it didn't topple
to the ground.
As for the yo-yo, according to Larry
at Operations and Maintenance, "That
yo-yo has been up there for years. I
thought it was part of the statue."
The yo-yo was placed on the finger of
the L. Agassiz statue by a bunch of "bored
graduate students late one night during
the fall of 1986," according to former
"bored" graduate student Connie. Agassiz
was chosen mainly because he had an
"available finger sticking out."
The yo-yo you see today is actually the
second yo-yo — the original fell oft. "It
is quite conceivable the person who did
it is still around," Stacey from the psycho
department told me. This makes me think
of those Friday the 13th movies .. . he's
still around ... So how about a frisbee
in the other hand?

Dear Bug,
On the Stanford seal right below the
tree there is this saying in German that
reads "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht. * What
does it mean, why is it in German and
why is it there anyway?
— Curious in the Wurst way
Speaking of the Stanford seal, didn't
I read something recently in The Daily
about El Palo Alto, the tree that suppos
edly is the Stanford symbol? The article
told of a Spanish explorer named Gaspar
de Portola who "discovered" and
"named" the tree in 1769. I can just
picture that ...
"Que tal, Mr. Conquistador?" (This is
all translated, of course.)
"We had a good day today, Paco."
"Did you discover the Fountain of
Youth or ancient civilizations with peace
ful natives to slaughter and gold to steal
and make us sickeningly rich, seiior?"
"No, no. Something much more impor
tant, Paco. We discovered a redwood tree
in that forest over there and we named
it - The Tall Tree."
Anyways' back to the question. Before
I was admitted to Special Collections, I
had to produce a valid driver's license,
valid student ID, valid note from my
mother and a valid reason. It took the
lady behind the desk almost 20 minutes
to find the book that was "too
voluminous" to read over the phone.
The phrase "Die Luft der Freiheit

weht" came from the French phrase
"Payez plus pour moins." (translation:
pay more for less).
No, actually Ulrich von Hutten uttered
those words, or something like them,
when Luther was being prosecuted. He
said, "Don't you know that the winds of
freedom are blowing?" The first president
of Stanford, David Starr Jordan read that
phrase to Leland Stanford who was re
portedly "very impressed" with it. The
phrase is only on the President's seal and
not on the official seal. The Registrar's
Office has its own seal that replaces the
tree with a big dollar sign.
Dear Bug,
Has anyone ever gotten "an eye poked
out" by a paper airplane at Sunday flicks,
or is it still all fun and games?
— Cyclops
According to the man in charge of that
riotous and raucous Sunday event, the
most common ailment at the flicks is

paranoia. "We've had contacts popped out
and paper cuts on tongues," Jay Goldin
told me, "but no eyes poked out. We're
trying to make a kinder, gentler Sunday
Flicks by instituting pillow fights . . . and
if you take a date — go to the early
show." So it's still all fun and games
until somebody falls ofT the balcony. Oh
and by the way, the flick has been can
celed for Sunday. Don't miss the Monday
double feature of Always and Spinal Tap,
two shows that go "oh so well together."

your pillow.
Dear Bug,
A few years ago, red M & M's made
a comeback. However there are still no
light brown (or "tan") peanut M & M's,
although this color exists for the plain
kind. Why is this?
— DA
The Stanford Daily receives about
$25,000 annually from student fees, so
I figured spending about a buck fifty of
that as research costs was pretty mini
mal. Sure enough, there are tan plain M
& M's but no tan peanut M & M's. I
sorted them all by color and fed all the
green ones to the woman on the computer
next to me.
I then proceeded to spend some more
of that hard-earned student funding by
making a long distance phone call to the
M & M manufacturers. Bob, hereby
dubbed Mr. M & M, told me the weather
in New Jersey was pretty miserable. He
also said the colors were based on con
sumer preference tests.
Here's the breakdown: Peanut M &
M's have just in the past two weeks been
changed to 20 percent of all five colors
(brown, yellow, green, red, orange). The
plain M & M's are 30 percent brown, 20

percent yellow and green and 10 percent
orange, green and tan. So here's a good
party theme — buy more M & M's than
you feel is safe to consume, pour them
all over the floor, sort them by color and
sue the M & M manufacturers if the
percentages are wrong.
The woman next to me keeps asking
for more green M & M's.
Anyway, the decision is based on what
looks "appealing and appetizing." Placing
an orange pellet in my mouth about the
size of a rabbit terd is supposed to be
more appealing than, oh, say a blue rabbit
terd. "Consumers must have a problem
with tan peanut M & M's," according to
Mr. M & M. I told Mr. M & M this was
a boring answer. "I'm looking for some
thing more along the lines of deaths and
calamities associated with tan peanut M
& M's." To console me he said that from
1940 to 1949 there was a violet color
that was eventually replaced by the tan
color.
"That won't do," I said. "I want a
tragedy or a miracle."
"How about this. We produce 100 mil
lion M & M's a day."
"Call me back," I told Mr. M & M,
"when an apparition of the Madonna is
seen at a local 7-11 with a tan peanut
M & M in one hand while muttering
'Look, it melts in your mouth - not in
your hand!' " Then I hung up on him.
Dear Bug,
I was wondering about the two statues
that sit perched precariously at either
side of the Jordan Hall sign outside the
Psychology Department. Exactly how
securely are these guys attached to the
building? And in view of the recent quake,
how safe would I be if I were walking
underneath them and another big one
hit?
— Fearful

Mr. Bug,
How long has that yo-yo been dangling
from the finger of the statue on the third
floor facade of the Psych building? Rumor
has it the toy belonged to ol' Leland Jr.
himself.
— Don't leave me Hangin'
Fearful, you must be 1) a freshman or
2) a very inattentive non-Californian.
YOU'RE NOT SAFE UNDER ANY
THING DURING A BIG EARTH
QUAKE, YOU BOZO!
The statues look firmly attached, but
I thought I'd perform a few stability tests
— I started throwing rocks at the statues.
Unfortunately, I didn't get very far before
somebody came out of the building
screaming, "Just what the hell are you
doing!?"
"Is this a trick question?" I asked.
You see, I don't have very good aim,
and to make a long story longer, the one
time I did hit the statue it didn't topple
to the ground.
As for the yo-yo, according to Larry
at Operations and Maintenance, "That
yo-yo has been up there for years. I
thought it was part of the statue."
The yo-yo was placed on the finger of
the L. Agassiz statue by a bunch of "bored
graduate students late one night during
the fall of 1986," according to former
"bored" graduate student Connie. Agassiz
was chosen mainly because he had an
"available finger sticking out."
The yo-yo you see today is actually the
second yo-yo — the original fell oft. "It
is quite conceivable the person who did
it is still around," Stacey from the psycho
department told me. This makes me think
of those Friday the 13th movies .. . he's
still around ... So how about a frisbee
