# Crying Out For Help
## Seeking counsel is difficult for bulimics, anorexics 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last
in a series of articles examining
eating disorders of Stanford stu
dents.

When Wilbur Hall staffers
showed up to work each day two
summers ago, they didn't know
whether they would find another
plastic Bookstore bag filled with
vomit.
Many bags were found in visible
locations that summer, sitting in
the main office, in the laundry
room and hanging on doorknobs.
The bags were a bulimic's cry
for help, but because her identity
was discovered only two days
before she went back to her home
country, the Wilbur staff could
not ensure that she would receive
treatment.
Seeking help for eating disor
ders is not easy because many
anorexics and bulimics, the
mtyority of whom are women, are
ashamed of their eating habits.
Admitting a problem and decid
ing to do something about it,
which usually involves telling
others, are two big stumbling
blocks students with eating disor
ders must pass on the long road

to recovery.
Though sophomore Daphne Ed
wards would eat only an ice cream
cone all day and would get a
headrush each time she stood up,
she did not think she had an
eating disorder. Edwards was
alarmed when little hairs began
growing on her arms and legs to
keep her body warm, but she did
not know it was because of her
eating habits.
During an emergency visit to
the infirmary after collapsing
while walking home from a high
school orchestra practice, she was
diagnosed as having an eating dis
order. For the rest of the year
doctors monitored her to make
sure she would not have a heart
attack or another heart complica
tion.
Edwards wonders how long she
would have continued her diet had
she not collapsed. "It's so funny
because you can hear so much
about [eating disorders! and be in
the middle of it, but it's so hard

to get the clue that 'Yeah, I'm
doing that, too.' "
She says she did not think she
had a disorder because "anorexics
and bulimics would know how
many calories are in everything
they eat, and I am not like that
because 1 have no idea."
Even though "Heather," a grad
uate student, always knew how
many calories she had eaten, how
many more calories she would eat
that day and exactly how she
would spend those calories, she
did not think she had a problem
with food.
She did not believe it was un
natural to deprive herself of a 35-
calorie rice cake when she had
hunger pangs. Although she
worried a little bit when her heart
beat 100 times per minute after
hinging, she did not think it was
due to a problem with food.
It took Heather more than a
year to convince herself she had
a problem. Then, it took her six
months to do something about it.
She began to go to the Body-
Image, Food and Self-Esteem sup
port group at the Bridge.
