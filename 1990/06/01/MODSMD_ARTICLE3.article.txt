# Crying Out For Help
## Seeking counsel is difficult for bulimics, anorexics 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last
in a series of articles examining
eating disorders of Stanford stu
dents.

When Wilbur Hall staffers
showed up to work each day two
summers ago, they didn't know
whether they would find another
plastic Bookstore bag filled with
vomit.
Many bags were found in visible
locations that summer, sitting in
the main office, in the laundry
room and hanging on doorknobs.
The bags were a bulimic's cry
for help, but because her identity
was discovered only two days
before she went back to her home
country, the Wilbur staff could
not ensure that she would receive
treatment.
Seeking help for eating disor
ders is not easy because many
anorexics and bulimics, the
mtyority of whom are women, are
ashamed of their eating habits.
Admitting a problem and decid
ing to do something about it,
which usually involves telling
others, are two big stumbling
blocks students with eating disor
ders must pass on the long road

to recovery.
Though sophomore Daphne Ed
wards would eat only an ice cream
cone all day and would get a
headrush each time she stood up,
she did not think she had an
eating disorder. Edwards was
alarmed when little hairs began
growing on her arms and legs to
keep her body warm, but she did
not know it was because of her
eating habits.
During an emergency visit to
the infirmary after collapsing
while walking home from a high
school orchestra practice, she was
diagnosed as having an eating dis
order. For the rest of the year
doctors monitored her to make
sure she would not have a heart
attack or another heart complica
tion.
Edwards wonders how long she
would have continued her diet had
she not collapsed. "It's so funny
because you can hear so much
about [eating disorders! and be in
the middle of it, but it's so hard

to get the clue that 'Yeah, I'm
doing that, too.' "
She says she did not think she
had a disorder because "anorexics
and bulimics would know how
many calories are in everything
they eat, and I am not like that
because 1 have no idea."
Even though "Heather," a grad
uate student, always knew how
many calories she had eaten, how
many more calories she would eat
that day and exactly how she
would spend those calories, she
did not think she had a problem
with food.
She did not believe it was un
natural to deprive herself of a 35-
calorie rice cake when she had
hunger pangs. Although she
worried a little bit when her heart
beat 100 times per minute after
hinging, she did not think it was
due to a problem with food.
It took Heather more than a
year to convince herself she had
a problem. Then, it took her six
months to do something about it.
She began to go to the Body-
Image, Food and Self-Esteem sup
port group at the Bridge.

EATING
DISORDERS
Health Center, says many stu
dents with eating disorders who
come to her are embarrassed.
"Matt," a 1988 graduate, found
it especially difficult to tell others
about his anorexia and bulimia
because few men have eating dis
orders. When he finally did seek
help in Southern California and
went to an informational meeting,
he was disappointed because he
was the only male among 20 wom
en.
Despite greater numbers,
women are embarrassed, too. "I
felt shame, guilt," Heather says.
"It disgusted me, and I felt hor
rible that I could do something
like this. I thought they (family
and friends) would be horrified,
but it was completely untrue."
Says Moreno, "I have seen this
sort of trend that these people
have to be struggling with this
for several years before they are
ready to come in."
Sophomore Maha Ibrahim
wanted to get help for a long time,
but she couldn't — something
held her back. Finally, when she
heard that continuing her scanty
diet might prevent her from being
able to have children, Ibrahim
sought help.
She now sees a private therapist
on a regular basis to talk about
self-esteem and other issues that
started and prolonged her disor
der.
Now, Ibrahim has stopped con
sidering what other people think
of her gaining weight. Instead, "it

'I try to help people
feel comfortable with
their body, rather than
worrying so much
about the number on
the scale.'

is coming from within this time,"
she says. She is feeling more com
fortable eating in social situa
tions, which she never did before.
Cowell nutritionist Alice Bender
gave Ibrahim a diet analysis eight
months ago. In the beginning she
was supposed to increase her
calorie intake to 1,000 a day; cur
rently she eats 1,600. Ibrahim
does not like having to follow a
set amount, but she must because,
as she says,"I can't tell when I
am full."
Says Bender, "I try to help
people feel comfortable with their
body, rather than worrying so
much about the number on the
scale."
She tries to make them focus
on how they feel and take time
to eat and enjoy what they eat.
This is hard for students who have
always been cautious about
eating.
Edwards spent six months in a
hospital at UCLA trying to learn
to eat normally again.
She says she still thinks about
her diet all the time. She looks
at herself and thinks, "How did
you get so you weighed so much?
You never needed to before."
She knows she could completely
be pulled back into anorexia, be

cause it wasn't until this year,
two years after she was diagnosed,
that she felt she could eat nor
mally and start to eat dessert
again.
"Still, sometimes, it's hard to
see someone really, really thin
running or eating a salad because
I think, 'That is so sad,' " but at
the same time she feels like she's
lost something. "I think, 'I used
to be that strong, too.' "
"It's difficult," she says,
"because part of me still as
sociates that behavior with some
thing so good, and at the same
time I know that it is so un
healthy, and I know how unhappy
I was."
Moreno says most students who
come to her with eating disorders
are compulsive overeaters or are
completely preoccupied with
dieting. "They may not fit the
definition of eating disorder, but
they see it as a problem," Moreno
says. They feel weak and out of
control.
"Linda" was preoccupied with
food. She began taking anti
depressants and participating in
Body-Image, Food and Self-
Esteem. Now she can eat like a
normal person, but she still thinks
about calories.
At dinner she sits with her
roommate, who is having a salad
as she eats an enchilada, and her
conscience nags at her. "It's still
there," she says, "but at least I
have been able to get on with my
life."

She says she did not think she
had a disorder because "anorexics
and bulimics would know how
many calories are in everything
they eat, and I am not like that
because 1 have no idea."
Even though "Heather," a grad
uate student, always knew how
many calories she had eaten, how
many more calories she would eat
that day and exactly how she
would spend those calories, she
did not think she had a problem
with food.
She did not believe it was un
natural to deprive herself of a 35-
calorie rice cake when she had
hunger pangs. Although she
worried a little bit when her heart
beat 100 times per minute after
hinging, she did not think it was
due to a problem with food.
It took Heather more than a
year to convince herself she had
a problem. Then, it took her six
months to do something about it.
She began to go to the Body-
Image, Food and Self-Esteem sup
port group at the Bridge.

EATING
DISORDERS
Health Center, says many stu
dents with eating disorders who
come to her are embarrassed.
"Matt," a 1988 graduate, found
it especially difficult to tell others
about his anorexia and bulimia
because few men have eating dis
orders. When he finally did seek
help in Southern California and
went to an informational meeting,
he was disappointed because he
was the only male among 20 wom
en.
Despite greater numbers,
women are embarrassed, too. "I
felt shame, guilt," Heather says.
"It disgusted me, and I felt hor
rible that I could do something
like this. I thought they (family
and friends) would be horrified,
but it was completely untrue."
Says Moreno, "I have seen this
sort of trend that these people
have to be struggling with this
for several years before they are
ready to come in."
Sophomore Maha Ibrahim
wanted to get help for a long time,
but she couldn't — something
held her back. Finally, when she
heard that continuing her scanty
diet might prevent her from being
able to have children, Ibrahim
sought help.
She now sees a private therapist
on a regular basis to talk about
self-esteem and other issues that
started and prolonged her disor
der.
Now, Ibrahim has stopped con
sidering what other people think
of her gaining weight. Instead, "it

'I try to help people
feel comfortable with
their body, rather than
worrying so much
about the number on
the scale.'

is coming from within this time,"
she says. She is feeling more com
fortable eating in social situa
tions, which she never did before.
Cowell nutritionist Alice Bender
gave Ibrahim a diet analysis eight
months ago. In the beginning she
was supposed to increase her
calorie intake to 1,000 a day; cur
rently she eats 1,600. Ibrahim
does not like having to follow a
set amount, but she must because,
as she says,"I can't tell when I
am full."
Says Bender, "I try to help
people feel comfortable with their
body, rather than worrying so
much about the number on the
scale."
She tries to make them focus
on how they feel and take time
to eat and enjoy what they eat.
This is hard for students who have
always been cautious about
eating.
Edwards spent six months in a
hospital at UCLA trying to learn
to eat normally again.
She says she still thinks about
her diet all the time. She looks
at herself and thinks, "How did
you get so you weighed so much?
You never needed to before."
She knows she could completely
be pulled back into anorexia, be

cause it wasn't until this year,
two years after she was diagnosed,
that she felt she could eat nor
mally and start to eat dessert
again.
"Still, sometimes, it's hard to
see someone really, really thin
running or eating a salad because
I think, 'That is so sad,' " but at
the same time she feels like she's
lost something. "I think, 'I used
to be that strong, too.' "
"It's difficult," she says,
"because part of me still as
sociates that behavior with some
thing so good, and at the same
time I know that it is so un
healthy, and I know how unhappy
I was."
Moreno says most students who
come to her with eating disorders
are compulsive overeaters or are
completely preoccupied with
dieting. "They may not fit the
definition of eating disorder, but
they see it as a problem," Moreno
says. They feel weak and out of
control.
"Linda" was preoccupied with
food. She began taking anti
depressants and participating in
Body-Image, Food and Self-
Esteem. Now she can eat like a
normal person, but she still thinks
about calories.
At dinner she sits with her
roommate, who is having a salad
as she eats an enchilada, and her
conscience nags at her. "It's still
there," she says, "but at least I
have been able to get on with my
life."

eating disorders of Stanford stu

When Wilbur Hall staffers
showed up to work each day two
summers ago, they didn't know
whether they would find another
plastic Bookstore bag filled with
vomit.
Many bags were found in visible
locations that summer, sitting in
the main office, in the laundry
room and hanging on doorknobs.
The bags were a bulimic's cry
for help, but because her identity
was discovered only two days
before she went back to her home
country, the Wilbur staff could
not ensure that she would receive
treatment.
Seeking help for eating disor
ders is not easy because many
anorexics and bulimics, the
mtyority of whom are women, are
ashamed of their eating habits.
Admitting a problem and decid
ing to do something about it,
which usually involves telling
others, are two big stumbling
blocks students with eating disor
ders must pass on the long road

to recovery.
Though sophomore Daphne Ed
wards would eat only an ice cream
cone all day and would get a
headrush each time she stood up,
she did not think she had an
eating disorder. Edwards was
alarmed when little hairs began
growing on her arms and legs to
keep her body warm, but she did
not know it was because of her
eating habits.
During an emergency visit to
the infirmary after collapsing
while walking home from a high
school orchestra practice, she was
diagnosed as having an eating dis
order. For the rest of the year
doctors monitored her to make
sure she would not have a heart
attack or another heart complica
tion.
Edwards wonders how long she
would have continued her diet had
she not collapsed. "It's so funny
because you can hear so much
about [eating disorders! and be in
the middle of it, but it's so hard

to get the clue that 'Yeah, I'm
doing that, too.' "
She says she did not think she
had a disorder because "anorexics
