## From junior college to College World Series Reid and Cardinal bury past, begin title hunt today 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
One year ago today, the mem
bers of the Stanford baseball team
were kicking back in their living
rooms, getting set to watch the
College World Series on TV.
They most likely weren't too
thrilled about it: the Cardinal
hadn't even been given a chance
to return to Omaha to defend its
two straight national titles, so the
players were understandably less
than happy about being at home.
Things could have been far worse,
however.
Just ask John Reid.
Hold up, you say. John Reid?
The junior-college transfer? He
wasn't even on the team last year!
How could he possibly have been
in a worse situation than the
Stanford players? How could he
possibly have been in more pain
than the two-time defending, non
invited champs?
Simple. Just ask.
So, John, what were you doing
during last year's College World
Series?
"I was laid up on the floor at
home, my body covered with
poison ivy, and I was watching
the games on ESPN," Reid says.
"How about that. I couldn't move
without itching myself some
where. It was terrible."
Ouch! Reid ran into the poison
ivy during his job as a weed
cutter, and hoo boy. ... "I
should've thought that my body
doesn't get along with weeds," he
says. "Wow! It was a nightmare!
.. . That was the worse case of
poison ivy I've ever had. ... I
knew I was allergic to it, but I
just dove into those weeds and
said 'Let me at 'em!' "
Wise move.
Oh, so you're still not con
vinced, huh? Look at the Stanford
media guide, you say. It says Reid
and his teammates at Meramec
Community College in St. Louis
went to the Junior College World

Series last year, so Reid didn't
have it all bad. Heck, Stanford
didn't even make the playoffs in
'89, so why have any sympathy
for J.R.?
Well, that seems to be a valid
argument, except for the tiny
problem that the media guide ...
is dead wrong.
"No, we didn't go," Reid says.
"We were one strike away, and
we had a three-run lead in the
last inning, and wound up losing
the game." Ouch again.
Still don't want to give him any
sympathy, huh? At least Reid
wasn't the one who lost it, right?
Sorry. "I was pitching," Reid
says."The problem was I was
coming off a 140-pitch outing the
day before." Oh, is that the only
problem? (Author's note: I've got
this all on tape if you still don't
believe it.)
By the way, it gets worse: "They
brought me back in the last in
ning, and it was one of those sit
uations where I was just throwing
the ball up there and hoping
they'd hit it (at someone)," Reid
says. "As it turned out, I beaned
a guy for the last run of the game,
because I had no control. I didn't
know what the heck was going to
happen." Ouch yet again. (Are the
Red Sox reading this?)
What a month. "It was a night
mare, and for about a week I
couldn't get it out of my head,"
Reid says. (A week? Has anyone
seen Calvin Schiraldi lately?) "It
was just the most haunting thing
that could ever happen to a ball
player, especially a pitcher."
"The coach told me that regard
less of what happened, I was
gonna be the one, because he had
no faith in anyone else," Reid
says. "To this day, he still doesn't
think he made a bad move. I dis
agree." So who wouldn't?
All in all, May 1989 just wasn't
the most banner month in the
life of John Reid. "What a differ
ence a year makes," Reid laughs.
"After that game my Dad and I

were talking and he said 'Well,
next year wouldn't you rather be
going to the big one than this
one?' and I said 'That's one way
to look at it, I guess.' "
It is indeed. For, even though
last May won't be up there with
Reid's favorite months, May '89
did have one redeeming factor:

that's when he found out he was
coming to Stanford.
And that's why, one year later,
he's headed to "the big one."
"Now that we're going, this is
the highlight of my baseball
career," Reid says. "This is what
it's all about."
Ironically, if Reid hadn't ever

gone to a junior college, he
wouldn't be getting this shot in
the CWS. For, even though he's
put up impressive numbers for
the Cardinal this season (6-1, 3.23
ERA), it's only because he worked
his tail off for two years. Coming
out of high school, well. . ..
"I wanted to come here out of
high school, but I just couldn't,"
Reid says."I wouldn't have gotten
any money (on a scholarship) be
cause I couldn't throw the ball
over 80 miles an hour when I was
coming out of high school, which
was pathetic."
"My junior college coach (Ric
Lessmann) told me 'Come here,
we'll get you stronger, we'll up
your value to other colleges, and
then we'll see what we can do for
you,' " Reid says."I decided to go
that route, and from the begin
ning of my sophomore year this
is where I wanted to come. They'd
won two titles, and I knew the

school was great. This is exactly
where I wanted to be."
It wasn't easy getting here,
however. "My junior-college coach
was saying 'You're not there, you
can't play for 'em, you can't do
it, you're not good enough,' " Reid
says. "That was a big slap in the
face, but that's the way he was
— he was a realist."
By the beginning of last year,
however, Reid had improved
enough for Lessmann to call the
Stanford coaches and ask that
they take a look at Reid during
a Meramec road trip to the Bay
Area. Coach Kirk Mason went to
watch Reid pitch at West Valley
C.C.and Reid did, well .. .
"I had a real shaky first two
innings, and the reason was they
were the first two innings of my
year," Reid says."The next two
innings I was okay. I gave 'em

the College World Series on TV this time last year. Today, Reid
and his Stanford teammates are the ones in the spotlight as they
begin their quest for a NCAA Championship.
