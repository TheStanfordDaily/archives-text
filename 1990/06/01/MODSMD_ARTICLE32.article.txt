# Athletes protest budget cuts in sports training department
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Imagine the Stanford women's tennis
team without 1990 NCAA singles cham
pion Debbie Graham. Or the men's tennis
team without its unbelievable trio of
freshmen, Jonathan Stark, Jared Palmer
and Alexis Hombrecher.
These athletes are only a small handful
of the many Cardinal athletes who have
incurred some form of serious injury this
year. The burden of getting thera healthy
is the responsibility of Stanford's training
department. Its seven full-time employees
are kept busy maintaining the health of
athletes from 35 club and varsity squads.
These individuals have been an enormous
factor behind the success of Stanford
sports teams throughout the years.

Unfortunately, if the required Athletic
Department budget cuts proceed accord
ing to plan, this vital part of Cardinal
sports will be decreased by one member.
Rickey Hayes, a well-liked and well
respected trainer who has worked here
for two years, stands to be a victim of
the cuts that Athletic Director Andy
Geiger is forced to make. The preliminary
decision to dismiss Hayes has met with
considerable resistance from athletes
from all sports. Tennis team member
Kylie Johnson has spearheaded an at
tempt to avert what she believes will be
a terrible mistake.
"[Firing Hayes] is not only a matter
of hurting one guy," Johnson said. "Every
athlete on every team will be affected
dramatically."
Hayes agrees with Johnson's assess-

'Ultimately, I feel that the athletes themselves are the
ones who will suffer, because the staff is already pretty
small. If our number is decreased by one, we 11... the
trainers will be scrambling.'

ment. "Ultimately, I feel that the athletes
themselves are the ones who will suffer
[from his absencel because the staff is
already pretty small," he said. "If our
number is decreased by one, well . . . the
trainers will be scrambling."
Apparently, they already are scram
bling to meet the current demand; an
athlete coming into the training room

can usually expect a 30- to 45-minute
wait before being treated.
Johnson also contends that firing
Hayes would not save the department
much money because Hayes is an orthodic
technician, meaning that he builds braces
himself. "The amount of money we save
by not having to order knee or ankle
braces from someone else is substantial,"

Johnson said. "By firing Rickey, the de
partment may save his salary, but they
will have to pay to have the braces made
for us."
As much as Hayes, Johnson and all
Stanford athletes stand to lose by Hayes'
departure, there is no resentment
towards Geiger.
"Andy Geiger is in a very difficult po
sition," Johnson said. "We're not saying
that he's done a bad job at all, but just
that he hasn't had the time to go as
in-depth as we [the athletes] have as to
the effects Hayes' firing will have."
Johnson, backed by a petition signed by
over 600 Stanford athletes, met with
Geiger yesterday morning in an attempt
to keep Hayes on the Farm.
