Somewhere between the Indy
500 and Gorbachev's visit lie the
exciting IM championships.
The Stanford Intramural De
partment wraps up another fun
filled year of competition Sunday
with the scheduled championship
games of the spring quarter
league sports — soflball, volley
ball, and Ultimate frisbee.
Also, all single-elimination
tournaments, posted on charts at
Encina Gym, must be completed
by Sunday as well.
An unofficial look at the 1989-
1990 IM leaderboard shows pe
rennial powerhouse Roble leading
relentless Biz 11, while a late surge
has allowed underdog Kappa
Sigma to thunder into third, bum
ping Biz I down to fourth place.
B-league softball is the spring
quarter IM "money sport,' and
only eight teams are still battling.

This week and weekend top
seeded Roble tackles the Vomit
Pigs, sentimental favorite Fat City
squares off against the Nads, and
the Burners play Sigma Chi. The
fourth quarterfinal pits grads
against grads as Biz I takes on
the Graduate Bums.
In B-league volleyball, three of
the four semifinalists are in place:
Roble, Sigma Chi, and the SLAC
Colliders. Roble awaits the winner
of a quarterfinal that pits Kappa
Sigma against tourney favorite
Fat City.
Jim Johnston, the IM staff
member in charge of volleyball,
said that recent threats of rain
were "a bloody nightmare," but
the playoffs should conclude "wit
hout a hitch." "The teams are
coping very well," he added.
The ever-expanding IM sport of
Ultimate frisbee also has three
semifinalists set in the B-league
playoffs. Slipped Disc, a highly
skilled Stanford Medical School
team, awaits the Fat City-Brad
Smith victor. The other semifinal
pits last year's champion, Missing
Rinc, against last year's runner
up, Los Bandidos. Talk about ex
citement.
These listed matchups only
scratch the surface of this quar
ter's IM playoffs. More action, in
these sports and others, is under
way at A-league, C-league, coed,
and women's levels. Contact the
IM office at 725-0753 to find out
who, when and where your favor
ite team is playing.
