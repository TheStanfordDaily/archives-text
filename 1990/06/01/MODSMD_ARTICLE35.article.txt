### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
A week ago, three Stanford
athletes had qualified for the
NCAA Track and Field Cham
pionships. Today, however, the
team has four potential Ail-
Americans.
Yesterday, Peggy Odita be
came the team's first 1990 Ail-
American at the meet, held at
Duke University in Durham,
N.C., placing seventh in the hep
tathlon. Odita stood in eighth
place after the first day but
moved up a place in the stand
ings in the final three events.
Odita placed 12th in the long
jump with a leap of 17 feet, 10V4
inches; grabbed fourth in the
javelin with a toss of 124-2 and
finished 11th in the 800 meters
with a personal bÂ«st of 2:18.82.
She finished with 5,394 points,
the second-best mark in school
history behind her own 5,406
set earlier in the season.
Arizona State's Gea Johnson
scored 6,132 points to win the
event. Johnson, who has a 4.0
grade point average, was No. 2
in the nation in that event last
year and was the favorite coming
in to the NCAA meet.
Bill Crowley and Eric Mastalir
also had good days for the Car
dinal last night. The two com
peted in the preliminaries of the
1,500 meters and both qualified
for the 12-man final, to be held
Saturday afternoon.

Crowley, the 1990 Pacific 10
Conference champion in the
event, placed fifth in his heat
with a time of 3:41.67 while
Mastalir placed eighth in
3:43.89. No one in the other heat
ran as fast so they will advance
to the final with the fifth- and
eighth-best times.
The only bad news for Stan
ford came in the shot put. There
Brian Boggess came up with a
heave of 56-7V-I, but it was not
good enough to advance him to
the finals.
Today, Dave Strang will com
pete in the finals of the 800
meters in an effort to achieve
All-America status. He recorded
the third-fastest time in Wed
nesday's qualifying.
Another top Stanford athlete,
sophomore sprinter Chryste
Gaines, had a great shot at All-
America honors but is not com
peting at the NCAA meet.
Gaines will instead compete with
a U.S. team in an international
meet in Milan, Italy, Tuesday
and Wednesday. Joining her will
be Stanford Asst. Coach Scott
Chisam, who was named the
U.S. women's coach for the meet.
Gaines was considered the
school's best threat to win an
individual title as she had the
nation's second-best time in the
100 meters going into the meet.
The top time in yesterday's qual
ifying for the 100 was 11.36;
Gaines has run an 11.31 and an
11.39 already this year.
