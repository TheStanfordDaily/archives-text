# Advertising for the Soviet president
## Corporation hopes full-page ad will capture Gorbachev's attention 
### Aaron Thode Staff writer 
Amid the roar of Bay Area busines
speople clamoring to meet with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, one com
pany is trying to attract his attention
by waving a red flag â€” so to speak.
Cypress Semiconductor Corp. has
placed a full-page, four-color advertise
ment in today's Daily in the hope that
it will catch the eye of the visiting Soviet
leader.
The ad welcomes Gorbachev and in
vites him to tour the company's head
quarters in San Jose in order "to see
life after Stanford' at an entrepreneur
ial Silicon Valley electronics company."

President T.J. Rodgers,
who obtained his doc
torate in electrical en
gineering at Stanford in
1975, appears along
with the invitation.
John Hamburger,
marketing communica
tions manager for the
7-year-old company,

said Rodgers came up with this public
relations brainstorm a week ago while
jogging.
Visiting the company would let the
Soviet leader experience the entrepre
neurial process in action, rather than
see any particular high-tech product,

Hamburger said.
The company chose to advertise in
The Daily, he said, because "a lot of
action related to the Bay Area summit
is taking place at Stanford.
Perhaps cost was also a factor.
Rodgers considered buying space in
Pravda, the Soviet Union's official news
paper. But when confronted with a price
of $50,000 per page, he decided to settle
for a Bay Area paper.
The San Jose Mercury News, with a
$7,780 price tag for a full-page ad, was
also a bit expensive compared to the
$1,700 The Daily charged.
The ad will also run in Sunday's Pen
insula Times Tribune.
