# Soviet grad student hopes to see his hero
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
When Leonid Vanyan gradu
ated from the Soviet State Uni
versity in Moscow in 1982,
Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev
was fighting the Cold War with
President Reagan.
Eight years later, both sides
have declared the end of the war.
And in the Soviets' eyes, the
United States has gone from
"some kind of evil" to "a candy
bar," says Vanyan, the only So
viet student at Stanford, a grad
uate student in geophysics.
What does Vanyan think of
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev's visit to Stanford? "I want
to see him in person. This is my
main purpose: to get a ticket to
see him," said Vanyan, who was
not among the students selected
to attend Monday's events.
"I respect him as an individual
who initiated all the changes
going on now," he added.
So, Vanyan, who will remain
in the United States until De
cember as part of a one-year pro
gram, has applied to the Soviet
consulate to see Gorbachev in
San Francisco later in the day.
Because there have never been
public political campaigns in the
Soviet Union, Vanyan compared
his desire to see the Soviet pres
ident in person to that of a fan
to see a famous celebrity "like
Arnold Schwarzenegger."
Vanyan, who is 30 years old,
worked for seven years at the
Institute of Physics of the Earth
in Moscow before his department
chief suggested he come to Stan
ford on the invitation of Geo

physics Prof. John Clarebout,
who serves as Vanyan's adviser.
In comparing life in the Bay
Area to that in Moscow, Vanyan
says there are "a great many
differences" between the two
areas. For example, he says most
research in the Soviet Union is
done through state institutes
rather than large universities.
"The main job at Soviet col
leges is teaching." Because all
students in a given discipline
take identical core courses, says
Vanyan, they have fewer choices
and learn less critical thinking.
As far as research is con
cerned, "People respect you here
for just your work. . . . You have
the freedom to concentrate on
your work without having to do
unrelated menial work."
Because low salaries create a
poor work ethic in the Soviet
Union, Vanyan says, "A lot of
people spend all their working
day drinking tea or coffee and
talking politics."
Vanyan says he and his wife,
who joined him here in March,
"are both enjoying life here."
However, despite the superior
working conditions, Vanyan says
his living conditions are better
in Moscow.
Although salaries are about
five times higher in California,
he says the rent is about 15
times as expensive.
"It's too costly to be living
with a family here," he says,
admitting he is not saving any
money at Stanford because he
is supporting his two children in
Moscow and his wife, who is not
permitted to work in the United
States.
