### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Are you anxiously wondering
how you can get to see Mikhail
Gorbachev?
Here's an answer that doesn't
involve large sums of money for
a scalped ticket: Become a jour
nalist and join the 5,000 other
reporters who will swarm over
Stanford Monday to cover the So
viet president's visit.
The newshounds will be bring
ing with them experience ranging
from the smallest of the small
town papers to the biggest
metropolitan "rags."
Reporters from more than 250
news sources will cover the floor
of "the Media Center," located in
Maples Pavilion. The Media Cen
ter will be filled with rows of
tables, telephones and computers
to assist reporters in sending their
stories to their respective organ
izations.
The three msyor TV networks,
along with CNN, will cover the
visit, as well as Time Magazine,
Newsweek, The New York Times,
the Los Angeles Times and many
others.
Stanford News Service has been
grappling with the "phenomenal
logistics" of the visit for two-and
a-half weeks, said reporter Karen
Bartholomew. "As much as you
prepare, there's always someone
who asks you a question you ha
ven't prepared for," she said.
Among many chores, News
Service has been coordinating or
ders for phone lines in the Media
Center. It hasn't yet received one
from the San Jose Mercury News,
the San Francisco Chronicle or

but the Toledo Blade placed an
order for one of its reporters yes
terday.
Mary Ann Seawell, another
News Service reporter, said ABC
requested a camera position on a
roof in the Quad and CBS has
followed suit.
Press credentials for the visit
have been coordinated by PBN, a
media network in San Francisco.
Who has applied for these general
Gorby-coverage access passes?
"Everyone you can imagine," said
Amy Pew, account assistant for
PBN.
The wide variety of news
sources includes The Beverly Hills
Courier, Alaska Newslink and The
Korea Daily News, she said. But
a more elite press pool, including
the networks, wire services
and newspapers, will be able to
tag along with the Soviet presi
dent.
Though Gorbachev's visit will
focus international attention on
Stanford, there are still some
groups that are clueless about the
University. Seawell said that one
major foreign newsmagazine
called the News Service to ask,
"Where is Stanford located?"
