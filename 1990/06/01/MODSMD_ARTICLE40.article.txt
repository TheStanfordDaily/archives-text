# The
						Gorbachev Visit
## 'Operation Gorbachev' full-time task for administrators, staff 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Senior staff writer 
"She's so busy, she can't even
give an interview."
Marlene Wine's secretary said
it all.
As a special assistant to Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy, Wine is responsible for what
happens at Stanford on Monday
between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
"I'm working on the actual
meeting between Gorbachev and
Kennedy," Wine said at the end
of a long day yesterday. "I'm
working with several different fac
ulty on that."
And several different University
staff members. Wine estimates
that 25 to 30 University admin
istrators — as well as their sup
port staff — have been focused
on the Gorbachev visit since Stan
ford got the word two-and-a-half
weeks ago.
"It's a full-time effort," Wine
said.
In fact, those handling the event
have waded through a flood of
phone calls — calls to and from
each other, from the media and
from the public. "The public
doesn't see the thousands of
phone calls and the hundreds of
pieces of paper that go back and

forth to puii this thing off," said
Bob Freelen, vice president for
public affairs.
According to Wine, Kennedy se
lected Freelen as his liaison with
the U.S. and Soviet governments.
"Now that Gorbachev is in Wash
ington, getting phone calls back
and forth to the Soviet Embassy
has been nigh impossible,"
Freelen said. "Instead of using the
phone, we use the fax and say,
'We're trying to return your
phone call.' "
"We've put in eight hours a day,
and we've done a lot of night work
and weekend work," he added. By
"we," he means administrators
and staffers from the Office of
Public Affairs, Stanford Police,
Stanford News Service, Events
and Services, the President's Of
fice and the Art Department.
Aesthetics are a key part of
Monday's events. Mikhail and
Raisa Gorbachev will spend 14
minutes in the Stanford Art
Gallery. For every minute the
Gorbachevs spend there, Art De
partment Chair Wanda Corn will
spend at least an hour preparing
for their visit.
Corn is the director of the
gallery. She will guide the Gorba
chevs on their seven-minute tour
and preside over the seven-minute

presentation which follows.
Corn said she didn't know the
Gorbachevs would be touring the
gallery until she read Tuesday's
papers. "I haven't had much time
to think about this," she said. "It's
all logistics at this point."
On the front lines of the battle
against pre-Gorbachev chaos is
Marvin Herrington. The Stanford
chief of police, Herrington says
he has spent "90 percent of my
time on security for Gorbachev."
Working closely with the Secret
Service, Herrington will begin im
plementing various security meas
ures over the weekend, including
the closure of all Quad buildings.
"It's fortuitous that Gorbachev
is coming on a Monday," Herring
ton said. "We can get in and deal
with all these buildings without
disrupting classes."
Many classes will be empty any
way, as thousands of students and
faculty crowd the Quad and fill
Memorial Auditorium.
With all those bodies to account
for, Herrington probably won't
get within yelling distance of Gor
bachev himself.
"Anybody would like the oppor
tunity to meet him, but frankly,
my focus will be on a whole bunch
of other problems that day," Her
rington said.
