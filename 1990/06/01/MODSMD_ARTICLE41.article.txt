# Demonstrators plan not-so-warm welcome

### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
While many scramble for tickets to see So
viet President Mikhail Gorbachev, others will
be holding signs of protest and waving national
flags in support of human rights and self
determination.
Armenian students, representatives of the
Baltic republics, Eritreans from Ethiopia and
Jewish students will hold rallies to ask Gor
bachev to take action for their respective eth
nic groups.
Today, Jewish students will demonstrate for
1,000 Soviet Jewish refusniks who have ap
plied to leave the Soviet Union but have been
denied exit visas.
At the noon vigil in White Plaza, organized
by the World Jewry Committee of Stanford
Hillel, demonstrators will call on Gorbachev
to make an official denunciation of anti-
Semitism.
According to Intern Director Jocelyn Reis
man, Hillel's program director, the rally is
not a protest of Gorbachev's visit to campus
but an educational presentation and a
solidarity vigil. "As president, Gorbachev
needs to make a statement to ease the climate
for Jews who do not decide to leave there,"
she explained.
Junior Rachel Oliker, co-chair of the World
Jewry Committee of Hillel, said she welcomes
Gorbachev to campus and is happy he is com
ing, but wants him to know that people sup
port the Jewish people in the Soviet Union.
"We are trying to raise awareness about things
that still need to be done," she said.
Held in conjunction with a rally in Moscow
today of Soviet refusniks, Stanford demon
strators will also call for the passage of The
New Soviet Law on Entry and Exit so that
free immigration will become a codified law.

The Baltic Alliance of Northern California
will rally on campus on Monday, calling on
Gorbachev to "just say yes to Latvia, Lithunia
and Estonia,* 1 according to Heino Jogis, a
member of the alliance.
Jogis, who immigrated from Estonia in
1949, said he expects a few Stanford students
to be at the demonstration, along with several
thousand from the Baltic group and East Eu
ropean countries.
Wearing colorful national costumes and car
rying placards and flags, people from the Bal
tic republics will ask Gorbachev not to view
independence as a threat but as something to
everyone's advantage.
In conjunction with this rally, close to 2,000
Eritreans from all over California will rally
from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Monday. Members
of the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front, who
organized the protest, say Gorbachev has al
lowed oppression of Eritreans in Ethiopia.
"The Soviet Union is supporting the Ethi
opian government to occupy our country,"
said Saleh Meky, the Western region repre
sentative of the group. Meky said the protest
aims to make people aware of the "hunger,
starvation and devastation directly because of
Soviet involvement."
Armenian students will hold a rally "in re
sponse to the anti-Armenian violence in the
Soviet Union," according to Aram Hajian, a
junior in mechanical engineering, but the
details of the location and time are still being
discussed.
"Chances are there will be some type of
demonstration or rally on campus, but the
details still need to be worked out," said
Hajian, who is a member of the Armenian
Students Association at Stanford.
"There are many instances where at the
local government level, the government has
been in on [the violence}," Hsyian explained.

"Gorbachev has let it happen or condoned it
without much of a preemptive effort."
Other students, who do not have ties to the
Soviet Union, object to Gorbachev's visit to
the campus because of what they call the
Soviet Union's human rights infringements.
Jim Ward, a senior in physics and philosophy,
said Gorbachev is a dictator and should not
be welcome at Stanford because of his repres
sive policies.
Eyal Mozes, a second-year graduate student
in computer science, is organizing a protest
at the Oval during Gorbachev's two-hour visit
on Monday in which a few students will hold
signs "protesting against dictatorship and for
individual rights."
"We think it is wrong that a university like
Stanford in a free country would honor a
dictator, a leader of a government who
tramples human rights," said Mozes, who is
from Israel.
While Ward, who will also participate in
this protest, admitted Gorbachev has done
some positive things, "At the same time, I do
consider him to be a criminal."
"The Soviet government oppresses all of its
people, which is a lot of people, and it represses
ideas which are crucial for social change,"
Ward said.
He likened Soviet policies to those in South
Africa, saying if South African president F.W.
DeKlerk visited campus, "people would not
welcome him with open arms because he is
the least oppressive of the recent leaders.
People would protest him as the leader of
apartheid."
John Overdeck, a statistics graduate student
who is of Lithuanian descent, said he plans
to carry a Lithuanian flag and "fly it at what
ever public gatherings there are."
