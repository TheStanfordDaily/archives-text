# Post office to sell Gorby envelopes
## 
### Allison Shue 
A picture is worth a thousand
words. And for those who are
not lucky enough to secure a
ticket to see Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, consolation
is just around the corner â€” at
the post office.
On Monday, the Stanford and
Palo Alto post offices will sell
special collector's envelopes and
issue original stamp cancella
tions to commemorate Gorba
chev's visit here.
A mobile postal unit will also

be set up in White Plaza.
At $2 each, the envelopes
might prove to be a bargain
compared to the price of a
scalped Gorbachev ticket.
Known as cachets, the envel
opes will bear a design featuring
Gorbachev's face above the word
"Stanford" written in the Cyril
lic alphabet used in the Russian
language.
For another souvenir, people
may bring a U.S. postage stamp
to one of the designated loca
tions on Monday and have it
canceled at no charge with a

special seal. Its design shows
two clasped hands along with
regular postal information, such
as date and location.
The cachet design was created
by Paula Murray and Sue
Cretarolo of Stanford Publica
tion Services.
According to Palo Alto
Postmaster Dick Lutzi, special
issues are created after historic
moments. Public demand and
stamp collectors' interests de
termine which events are com
memorated.
