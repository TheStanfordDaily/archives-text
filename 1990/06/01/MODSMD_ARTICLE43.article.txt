# Down, but not out
## Snubbed Hoover to display exhibit 
### Theresa Urist Staff writer 
The Hoover Institution is no
sore loser. Even though Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev
will not visit the Institution,
Hoover still plans to display a
Soviet exhibit to commemorate
his Stanford visit.
The exhibit, which opens
Monday, is titled "A Century
of Revolutions: Lenin to Gor
bachev" and illustrates the
transformation of Soviet
society from the revolutionary
movement in the early years of
the 20th century to the present.
The exhibit will feature all
of the items Hoover archivists
would have shown Gorbachev,
as well as other rare docu
ments, photographs and
posters from the Russian and
Soviet collections of the Insti
tution's library and archives.
Hoover's manager of public
affairs, • Gloria Walker,
describes the collection as an
array of "prestigious items."
The collection highlights
Gorbachev's role in transform
ing Soviet society and includes
posters and political literature
documenting recent changes.
One symbol in the exhibit of
the new ties between the

United States and the Soviet
Union is George Shultz's in
scribed copy of Gorbachev's
book "Perestroika."
The exhibit includes such
historical documents as the
first edition of Pravda on
March 5, 1917, the original
draft of Czar Nicholas ll's ab
dication document and an
original letter by Lenin written
to a comrade defending Lenin's
use of party funds, Walker said.
Also chronicled in the exhibit
is the system of slave labor
camps under Stalin, as ex
plored in Hoover fellow Robert
Conquest's book, "The Great
Terror." The book itself is an
example of glasnost, as it has
finally — after 20 years — been
translated and allowed to circ
ulate in the Soviet Union.
A photo album on display of
Okhrana, the czarist secret
police, contains more than just
family pictures. It is filled with
pictures of the Revolution and
a photo of Leon Trotsky, 19 at
the time.
The exhibit also features
Samizdat publications, which
are written by dissidents and
chronicle Russian underground
political movements.
