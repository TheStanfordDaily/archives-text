# Five students to give gift of art
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
Most Stanford students would probably love to
give Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a hand
shake or even a smile when he visits Stanford Mon
day. But five graduate art students will be able to
give him much more.
The students, who are all candidates for the degree
of Master of Fine Arts, are Matthew Chansky, Rich
ard Payne, Leslie Smith, Francesca Sundsten and
Daniel Tull. Each will present the Soviet leader and
his wife a small painting, drawing or photograph
created especially for the visit.
Two Bay Area artists are also planning to present
larger gifts of art.
Chansky, who has received numerous awards for
his work, is elated. He is eager to present the

Gorbachevs with a drawing called "Industrial
Landscape."
He said he hoped his work would find its way to
a "corresponding setting to Stanford," adding, "I
want Russian artists to see what we're doing."
Fellow student Tull was less optimistic about the
future of his painting, which features an olive
branch, a snake and a plaster child's head. "Maybe
it'll get put in a closet in the Kremlin," he said,
though he still called the opportunity "a great
honor."
Payne will present an oil painting with gold leaf
that features a Christ figure in silhouette.
Sundsten's work is also a painting, which depicts
a Utah desert scene she saw last summer.
The only photographer in the lot, Smith, plans
to give the Gorbachevs a black-and-white photo
graph she calls "Purses, South San Francisco."
