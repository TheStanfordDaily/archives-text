# Stanford Symphony raising money for tour of Eastern Europe
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
Planning an East-West excursion of its
own, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra
is raising money for a trip to Eastern
Europe.
In the summer of 1991, about 85 sym
phony members will perform in concert
halls and churches throughout Eastern
Europe. They will act as "cultural am
bassadors" for the United States and
Stanford, according to junior Alice Lee,
the incoming president of the members'
committee.
Plans for the tour have been underway
for several months now, and the tentative
itinerary includes concerts in Prague,
Budapest, Leipzig and "what is currently

East and West Berlin," according to grad
uate student Matt Springer, who is co
chair of the symphony's fund-raising
committee.
Fund raising is now one of the sym
phony's top priorities, since students
rejected its ASSU fee request in this
spring's elections.
The symphony is now exploring new
areas of fund raising, according to
Springer. By scheduling additional
campus performances — such as this
spring's "PDQ Bach" concert and the Hal
loween recital — and performing at out
side engagements, the symphony has
managed to raise $30,000 toward its
$200,000 tour budget.
Students and supporters will pay about
half of the costs themselves.

Springer added that candy sales have
already yielded $1,000 as well.
Playing extra concerts not only raises
money but also adds variety to the or
chestra's repertoire and "keeps every
one's musical mind alive," said visiting
Music Prof. Peter Jaffe, symphony con
ductor.
Jaffe, who earned his doctoral degree
in conducting from Stanford in 1981, said
the denial of ASSU funds was "a big
disappointment." He added, however, he
was "quite proud of symphony members'
dedication to and success in fund
raising."
"We still have a long way to go, but
I'm quite enthusiastic about the tour and
the symphony itself," Jaffe said. "I have
worked in several different university set

tings, and the musical talent, as well as
the organizational responsibility among
the students in the symphony here, is
quite unusual."
Jaffe is currently selecting the pieces
the symphony will perform next school
year and on its tour next summer; the
repertoire will include selections by both
Eastern European and American com
posers.
Last year, the symphony toured Japan,
Korea and Singapore on a summer tour.
Symphony members selected East Asia
because U.S. relations with the region
were rapidly gaining prominence at the
time, particularly in the realms of busi
ness and immigration.
The symphony's concerts in Kyoto
greatly raised awareness of Stanford in

Japan, according to Biological Sciences
Prof. Robert Simoni, who has taught at
the Stanford Kyoto campus and said he
is an enthusiastic supporter of the sym
phony.
Symphony members initially chose the
Soviet Union as their next destination
because of the tremendous changes being
initiated by Gorbachev under perestroika.
However, scheduling difficulties forced
them to look elsewhere, according to
junior Mari Shimizu, the outgoing pres
ident of the members' committee. This
winter's cataclysmic events convinced
symphony members to target Eastern
Europe for next year's cultural outreach.
The tour is scheduled for June 19
through July 3, 1991.
