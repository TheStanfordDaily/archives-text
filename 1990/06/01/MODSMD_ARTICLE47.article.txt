# Scholars debate Civil Rights Act of 1990
## 
### Ruben Garcia 
Two University scholars have taken differ
ent views of the proposed Civil Rights Act of
1990, which awaits President Bush's approval
or veto.
Proponents call the bill an attempt to res
tore civil rights compromised by recent Su
preme Court rulings which limited affirmative
action programs and grievance procedures for
employees claiming discrimination.
However, in an interview with The Daily,
senior Hoover Institution fellow John Bunzel
expressed his opposition to the act.
"The American People do not support pref
erential treatment for any race," he said.
Bunzel, who is a former member of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, testified
before the House Education and Labor Com
mittee last month against the proposed act.
A self-proclaimed supporter of the Civil
Rights Acts of the 19605, Bunzel said he saw
no connection between the 1990 bill, spon
sored by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and
the historic statutes of the 19605.
The original purpose of the 1964 act was
not only to end discrimination but also to
make employment opportunity independent of
race, color, religion, sex or national origin, he
said. The proposed act is not color-blind, he
asserted.
Bunzel called for a decrease in the role the
courts have played in setting affirmative ac
tion policy.
He also guessed most Stanford students

favor a system of "fair play, fair chance and
fair opportunity to prove they are good golfers,
violinists or academicians."
Numbers alone do not prove discrimination,
he said in reference to the recent controversy
regarding the underrepresentation of minority
faculty at Harvard Law School. The reason
for the lack of minority faculty correlates with
the dearth of minorities with doctoral degrees.
"For example, a couple of years ago, there
were only three or five black math Ph.Ds to
graduate here," he said.
Bunzel echoes the Bush administration's
concern that the bill would create the possi
bility of employers adopting hiring and promo
tion quotas for groups covered by the
legislation.
Supporters of the bill have proposed amend
ing it by eliminating the word "quota."
Education lecturer James Steyer, who
teaches a course called "Civil Rights and Civil
Liberties," called the emphasis on quotas "a
red herring, smokescreen issue" to cloud the
purpose of the bill. "I respect John Bunzel
in many regards, but he is dead wrong on
this issue."
The act is "nothing more than a restoration
of the basic rights that were there for 20
years," according to Steyer.
Bunzel said he was not "making a point
about affirmative action programs" in his tes
timony, although he said he believes they
"divide groups because of their color."
He likened his opinions to those set forth
by civil rights pioneers like Martin Luther

King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, who he said
also believed racial categories have "poisoned
our society."
Disregarding arguments that the United
States is not a color-blind society, Bunzel ex
pressed faith in the public's belief in equal
opportunity and free competition. "It's time
for the American people, through their legis
lators, to have a national debate on these
issues."
He added, "The change in policy has been
the work of courts and government agencies,
many of whose actions could never have taken
the form of legislation."
Steyer called the Act "consistent with every
single court decision until the string of cases
in 1989 which set back the cause of civil
rights."
"This will be a true test of President Bush's
commitment to civil rights. He has paid lip
service to civil rights, now we'll see if it will
be 'read my lips' or 'read my lip service,' "
said Steyer.
"The Supreme Court is probably more con
servative than the American people on this
issue," he added.
Steyer rejected the argument that the courts
are overextending the limits of their power.
"The courts have a right to uphold the 14th
Amendment," which bars discrimination by
race, he said.
He cited the historic 1954 Brown v. Board
of Education decision, which debunked the
concept of "separate but equal," as an example
of the Court taking the lead on such issues.
