# Holding steady at Hoover's helm
## Raisian hopes to display the 'real talent of the Institution' 
### Baldwin Lee Editorial staff 
Now that "acting" has been
dropped from his title, Hoover In
stitution Director John Raisian
hopes to move the Institution for
ward from the holding pattern he
has maintained in the past year.
Raisian, who has spent four
years in administrative posts at
Hoover, was named the perma
nent director last month. He said
he is still developing his long-term
goals because he took office so
recently, but he hopes to have "a
full-blown plan" by the end of the
calendar year.
Raisian, however, has already
established his basic philosophies
for his position. The Hoover di
rector should be a "spokesperson
for the [Hoover] fellows — the
real talent of the Institution," he
explained. He said he hopes to
work as a team leader who pro
motes Hoover rather than over
shadowing it.
As the leader, his two
responsibilities are to raise re
sources and to disseminate the
findings of Hoover scholars,
Raisian said.
W. Glenn Campbell, Raisian's
predecessor, was a particularly
; strong fund-raiser and continues
- to solicit donations as Hoover
counselor.
When Campbell was eased out
of the director's office last year,
the status of a $2 million gift
> from Japanese donors came into
question. However, this large do

nation came through, even though
Campbell's role had to be
renegotiated, Raisian said.
He claimed the amount and
number of donations have not
decreased during the transition
period after Campbell left office.
"Historically, we have done well
with private foundations,"
Raisian said. He therefore wants
to focus more on corporate sup
port.
Campbell made a trademark of
his high-powered fund-raising
strategies during his tenure as
Hoover director.
Raisian said he will work on
building good relations with pro
spective donors but will "let the
product sell itself, as opposed to

rather than over
shadowing it.

high-pitched intensity methods
that would give a one-shot but
not regular donating."
Fund-raising will be important
in Raisian's plans for as 2 million
television studio that can broad
cast outside Stanford. This is one
of several projects he hopes to
initiate that will build an interface
between the Institution and Uni
versity faculty and students.
"The television project will pro
mote an understanding of how to
team together," Raisian said.
"The ball is in our court right
now, because we need funding,"
he added.
Raisian said he also feels good
about the Institution's relations
with the University. While Hoover
has had stormy relations in recent
history with the Faculty Senate,
Raisian said he "couldn't be more
pleased [with present relations]
and will assume that things are
going well until convinced other
wise."
