# Kennedy's stepdaughter to attend Stanford of the East
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
"I wish Don Kennedy was my
stepdad."
That statement resonated fre
quently in the halls of Gunn
High School in April, when stu
dents were waiting to hear if they
had been accepted to Stanford.
Nothing makes Cameron
Hamill more furious. University
President Donald Kennedy is her
stepdad.
"It's like they're repudiating
my accomplishments," Hamill
says."It sort of takes some of
the glory away."
She will head for Harvard in
the fall, though she was also ac
cepted to Stanford, Princeton
and other top schools.
Hamill, who turned 18 last
week, is charming, poised and
quick to smile. Her resume
boasts accomplishments that put
her in the same league with her
future Crimson classmates — ac
complishments that have noth
ing to do with the fact that she
lives at Lou Henry Hoover
House.
Four years on the Gunn tennis
team. Editor of the school news
paper, the Gunn Oracle. Trips
to Israel, Kenya, England and
France. Weighted grade-point
average of 4.7. That's right, 4.7.
But being the daughter of
Robin Kennedy did affect
Hamill'B college application proc
ess.
When her Harvard interviewer
told her she seemed comfortable

talking with adults, Hamill ex
plained that her parents enter
tain a lot.
"I know who your parents
are," the interviewer replied.
Hamill was accepted "early ac
tion" to Harvard in December,
giving her until May to decide if
she wanted to attend.
While she was waiting to hear
from Stanford, she ran into Dean
of Freshman Admissions John
Bunnell. "My mom pointed him
out," Hamill says.
Bunnell told Hamill he
remembered her application well
and proceeded to mention several
points about it.
When her letters of admission
arrived in April, she had nar
rowed her choices down to Har
vard and Princeton. Hamill says
President Kennedy, who went to
Harvard himself, didn't pressure
her either way.
"Don was remarkably good
about not saying anything to
me" that would influence her
heavily one way or the other,
she says, adding, "He was very
balanced."
The night Hamill decided, she
announced, "I really want to go
to Harvard," and Kennedy had
tears of pride in his eyes.
"He was thrilled that I made
the decision that was best for
me," as well as about the con
tinuance of the legacy, Hamill
says with a smile.
Next year, she wants to study
social studies or public policy.
Outside the classroom, she hopes
to get involved with dance and

work against rape and sexual
harassment.
Hamill's story is replete with
ironies that entangle Harvard
and Stanford.
Each school's president atten
ded the rival university. And out
going Harvard president Derek
Bok's son Tom is currently a
junior here.
Hamill met the younger Bok
a few weeks ago at a Hoover
House dinner. The two were
seated next to each other and
had an opportunity to compare
notes.
"We have a lot of similar ex
periences," Hamill says. For in
stance, Hamill was blocked by
George Shultz's Secret Service
men while running through her
spacious home. During a visit
from the King of Spain, guards
stopped Bok, who was skate
boarding outside his home.
Of course, her situation does
have its advantages.
"It's really exciting meeting fa
mous people," Hamill says."It
makes political and famous
people much more real." She de
scribed one experience when she
told Shultz that was considering
attending Princeton, Shultz's
alma mater.
"He started to sing me Prince
ton fight songs," Hamill says.
When asked about her stepfat
her, Hamill simply gushes.
"It's just been a really great
experience to live with him. I
love him, and he's an incredible
stepfather."
