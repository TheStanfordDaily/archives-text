# Decision delayed on married housing for gays and lesbians
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Stanford has delayed creating a policy
to give gays and lesbians access to
married student housing.
A group of campus gays and lesbians
has been working to obtain domestic part
ner benefits since early fall. The group
expected campus administrators to make
a final decision on housing, health in
surance, campus health care and access
to University facilities at a meeting Wed
nesday. However, the decision has been
delayed indefinitely.
If approved, these policies would be
the first of their kind in a U.S. university.
The Administrative Council and the
Council of Administrative Deans of Un
dergraduate Studies discussed Wednes
day recommendations that would give gay
couples the same benefits as married cou

ples. Administrators plan to meet with
members of the group Tuesday.
"Things are really in a state of flux
right now," said David Bradfute, a
second-year graduate student who is a
member of the group. "We expected that
meeting to be some major watershed. In
fact, we do not know much more after
it than we did before."
Adding to the confusion is the pending
elimination of the Administrative Coun
cil, one of the committees considering
the issue, due to the University's budget
streamlining process.
Jean Kim, director of graduate resi
dences, said she does not know who will
make the final decision on domestic part
ner benefits. University President Donald
Kennedy and the Board of Trustees must
also approve all policy changes.
According to Kim, the deliberations are
an attempt to conform to the University's

nondiscrimination statement, which
prohibits discrimination due to sexual
orientation.
"Right now the policy is pro
heterosexual because it is for married
couples ... in marriages recognized by
California law," she said.
Although some religious institutions
conduct same-sex weddings, gay and les
bian marriages are not recognized in any
state, according to Bradfute.
However, Stanford gay and lesbian cou
ples have successfully petitioned for
married housing in the past. Still, said
Bradfute, "We want to be included as
first-class citizens of this community,"
rather than as exceptions to the rule.
In the housing debate, the issue
is what criteria will be used to determine
eligibility for the limited number of one
bedroom apartments. "We would like to
change it so that neither sexual orienta

tion nor marriage is playing a major role,"
Kim said.
According to Kim, all couples request
ing married housing have been accom
modated in the past. However, she said,
"If the decision is to open couples housing
to all domestic partners, same-sex or het
erosexual, then . . . the supply might not
meet the need."
Bradfute said "most people would be
happy to see heterosexual unmarried cou
ples" have access to married student
housing as well. But, he said, many in
the gay community feel that gays and
lesbians, who do not have the option to
marry, should be given priority.
Kim expressed optimism about the pos
sibility of extending some University
privileges to domestic partners, including
access to libraries, gyms, athletic events
and other University activities.
Domestic partners who request "cour

tesy cards" — currently known as "spouse
cards" — through the Registrar's Office
will be able to get them by next fall.
Cowell Student Health Center has al
lowed domestic partners of gays and les
bians access to its services since late fall.
Through a little-known policy, domestic
partners receive care under the same con
ditions as other dependents of students,
said Jane Meyer, Cowell's director of ad
ministration.
Domestic partners do not, however,
have access to health insurance as depen
dents of a student. Because Stanford's
insurance carrier would have raised the
insurance premium by more than 50 per
cent, Cowell's insurance committee
decided "that was unacceptable to pass
on to all dependents," Meyer said.
Stanford's three-year commitment to
the carrier ends in 1991.
