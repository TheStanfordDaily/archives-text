# Brest addresses Faculty Senate
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
In a well-received address to
the Faculty Senate, Law School
Dean Paul Brest yesterday
remarked on the changing face
of the legal profession and the
need to prepare Stanford stu
dents for a more technological
and globally oriented world.
Over the next two decades,
lawyers will be increasingly
called upon to solve complex
technical problems and deal
with people from different cul
tures, Brest said in his first
dean's address to the senate.
Brest emphasized the impor
tance of "permeable walls" be
tween departments and schools
and said he hoped to initiate
more interdisciplinary pro
grams.
He suggested that the Law
School, which now runs on a
semester system, might con
sider switching to a quarter sys
tem in order to facilitate
interaction with the rest of the

University.
University President Donald
Kennedy's response that other
schools and departments might
consider reverting to the semes
ter system was met with a num
ber of claps but a handful of
loud boos.
Brest also discussed the dif
ferences between today's stu
dents and law students of a
decade ago.
The average entering age of
last year's graduating class was
25, Brest said, much older than
classes from previous years.
In recent years, more students
have worked before entering law
school, though many have still
come straight from undergrad
uate institutions, he said. "Stu
dents who have more experience
bring more to the classroom and
take more away from it,"he
said.
A large percentage of gradu
ates continue to join private
firms, Brest said. Only 6 percent
of last year's class undertook
public interest or government

jobs, although this represents an
upward trend, according to
Brest.
He attributed the exodus to
large firms as a result of the
great disparity between starting
wages. The average starting
salary for Stanford law gradu
ates entering private firms was
$65,000, compared to $28,000
for public interest work.
In other business, the senate
continued its review of the
professoriate, voting to change
the titles and hiring standards
for the University's academic re
search staff.
The current title of senior re
search associate will be changed
to either senior research scien
tist, senior research engineer or
senior research scholar —
whichever is appropriate — to
"reflect professional achieve
ment and recognition con
siderably greater than that of
researcg associate."
