EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH FOR
STANFORD JUNIORS!
UNDERGRADUATE HONORS PROGRAM IN EDUCATION
The Stanford School of Education recently introduced an honors
program that will enable qualified undergraduates to engage in
EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH. Each student's work in Education, and
especially the honors thesis, will build upon the work done in the
undergraduate major department. (An average grade of B+ in the
major field is required for entry.) Thus, for example, a psychology
major would work with an educational psychologist, and a philosophy
major would work with one of the School's philosophers of education.
Most undergraduate majors can be catered to. Students just
finishing their sophomore year are encouraged to apply. (However,
enrollment in honors classes in Education is generally not restricted
to honors students.)
Further information, and application forms, are available in the Main
Office, School of Education.
Applications dose at noon on Monday, June 11th.
