ALLEN DRURY, '39
Pulitzer Prize-winner for Advise and Consent
HAS WRITTEN A NOVEL ABOUT STANFORD
AND THE WORLD WAR II GENERATION
TOWARD WHAT
BRIGHT GLORY?
It begins in a fraternity house at Stanford on the eve of
Munich in September, 1938. It ends with the start of World
War II in Europe in September, 1939. Its protagonists are
"Willie" Wilson, student-body president, his friends, their
girls, their teachers. On the broad canvas of what the
president of the University calls "this beloved place" they
mature and move toward oncoming war.
Some laugh. Some cry. One dies. One tries to die. Two
fight ethnic hostilities. One haunts the Quad in search of
furtive, fleeting relationships. One finds himself torn,
probably for life, between two worlds. Many others find
themselves joining the long wedding march down the
center aisle of Mem Chu. All grow up, each in his or her
own way, as war comes ever closer to their brief,
never-to-be-recaptured paradise ...
Come read about Willie Wilson and his friends, and how
they grew.
"In the season that breaks the heart the golden haze of
autumn lay upon the Santa Clara Valley ..."
ALLEN DRURY has for many years been America's leading
political novelist. Here he leaves the Washington scene he
knows so well to turn to the generation — his own — which
has seen a world disintegrate, a tense peace end in fantastic
changes in Europe and the Soviet Union, and a future
clouded and uncertain as it was on the eve of World War II
when TOWARD WHAT BRIGHT GLORY? begins.
ALLEN DRURY will be
at the Stanford Bookstore
Friday, June Bth, 12:30-2:00 p.m.,
to sign copies of
TOWARD WHAT BRIGHT GLORY?
