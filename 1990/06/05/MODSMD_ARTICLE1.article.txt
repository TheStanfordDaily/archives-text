# Gorbachev sweeps through Stanford
## 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
In a whirlwind of smiles,
speeches, camera flashes and
chants of protest, Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev extended an
open hand to the Stanford campus
yesterday on one of the final legs
of his five-day visit to the United
States.
Introduced by University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy as "the ar
chitect of a great world trans
formation," Gorbachev charmed
many during a visit that cul
minated in the Soviet leader's dec
laration to a cheering audience:
"The Cold War is now behind us.
Let us not wrangle over who won
it."
Gorbachev, arriving at the Oval
nearly an hour late, wasted no
time in plunging into the crowds
of the Quad to shake hands and
exchange greetings with the thou
sands of well-wishers there —
some of whom waited more than
four hours in the hot sun to catch
a glimpse of him.
The 47-car motorcade of the So
viet delegation raced down
Campus Drive and turned onto
Palm Drive at 11:50 a.m., just an
hour after Gorbachev concluded
a breakfast discussion with
former President Reagan in San
Francisco. Gorbachev and his wife
Raisa emerged from their car sur
rounded by a tight ring of Secret
Service and KGB agents and were
barely visible to television
cameras as they greeted Kennedy
and other members of the wel
coming party.
Rather than walking to the cen
ter of the Quad as scheduled, Gor
bachev immediately veered to the
right to greet the 10-row-deep
throngs of students, faculty and
staff, many of whom were cheer
ing wildly and pushing against a
metal barricade in front of them.
Surrounded by at least 50 dig
nitaries and Secret Service agents,
Gorbachev walked around the
perimeter of the crowd, stopping
several times to shake hands.
Kennedy, walking at Gorba
chev's side, attempted to describe
the Quad buildings and give a
brief tour, said Marlene Wine, an
aide to Kennedy. He soon gave
up, however, saying with some
humor, "This is out of control."
After circling the Quad, the en
tourage emerged through the
Quad entrance facing Green Li
brary. Responding to cheers, Gor
bachev waved and clasped his
hands triumphantly.
Though broadcast reports had
speculated that some part of the
Stanford agenda would have to be
dropped to make up time, the only
event cut short was a tour of the
