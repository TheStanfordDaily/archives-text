# Gorbachev sweeps through Stanford
## 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
In a whirlwind of smiles,
speeches, camera flashes and
chants of protest, Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev extended an
open hand to the Stanford campus
yesterday on one of the final legs
of his five-day visit to the United
States.
Introduced by University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy as "the ar
chitect of a great world trans
formation," Gorbachev charmed
many during a visit that cul
minated in the Soviet leader's dec
laration to a cheering audience:
"The Cold War is now behind us.
Let us not wrangle over who won
it."
Gorbachev, arriving at the Oval
nearly an hour late, wasted no
time in plunging into the crowds
of the Quad to shake hands and
exchange greetings with the thou
sands of well-wishers there —
some of whom waited more than
four hours in the hot sun to catch
a glimpse of him.
The 47-car motorcade of the So
viet delegation raced down
Campus Drive and turned onto
Palm Drive at 11:50 a.m., just an
hour after Gorbachev concluded
a breakfast discussion with
former President Reagan in San
Francisco. Gorbachev and his wife
Raisa emerged from their car sur
rounded by a tight ring of Secret
Service and KGB agents and were
barely visible to television
cameras as they greeted Kennedy
and other members of the wel
coming party.
Rather than walking to the cen
ter of the Quad as scheduled, Gor
bachev immediately veered to the
right to greet the 10-row-deep
throngs of students, faculty and
staff, many of whom were cheer
ing wildly and pushing against a
metal barricade in front of them.
Surrounded by at least 50 dig
nitaries and Secret Service agents,
Gorbachev walked around the
perimeter of the crowd, stopping
several times to shake hands.
Kennedy, walking at Gorba
chev's side, attempted to describe
the Quad buildings and give a
brief tour, said Marlene Wine, an
aide to Kennedy. He soon gave
up, however, saying with some
humor, "This is out of control."
After circling the Quad, the en
tourage emerged through the
Quad entrance facing Green Li
brary. Responding to cheers, Gor
bachev waved and clasped his
hands triumphantly.
Though broadcast reports had
speculated that some part of the
Stanford agenda would have to be
dropped to make up time, the only
event cut short was a tour of the

Art Gallery. Art Department
Chair Wanda Corn instead greeted
the Gorbachevs outside the
gallery, where several students
and two Bay Area artists pre
sented their works.
Then it was on to another ren
dezvous with cheering crowds,
holding cameras high above their
heads and clamoring for hand
shakes as Gorbachev made his
way to Littlefield Center. There,
he met with a group of 37 selected
faculty and students for a 20-
minute discussion.
The visit wrapped up with a
nationally televised address at
Memorial Auditorium. In his
speech, Gorbachev declared,
"Now, our common responsibility
is to make sure mechanisms of
East-West military confrontation
are dismantled as soon as possi
ble."
He further called for scientists
in both the United States and So
viet Union to join in determining
how nuclear weapons could be
destroyed without harming people
or the environment, and advo
cated a system of international
alliances that unites rather than
divides the world.
The 28-minute speech was
punctuated with several bursts of
applause from the 1,700-member
audience, and Gorbachev received
four standing ovations.
In perhaps the day's most sym
bolic act, Kennedy and Graduate
School of Business Prof. George
Shultz presented Gorbachev with
a framed 1921 Russian poster
from the Hoover Institution ar
chives. The poster depicts Russian
students learning to read and
bears an inscription from the Rus
sian poet Alexander Pushkin:
"Long live the sun! May the dark
ness be hidden!"
Perhaps the only clouds hang
ing over Gorbachev during his
visit were the hundreds of pro
testers lined along Palm Drive and
the Oval demonstrating support
for Baltic state independence and
an end to Soviet arms shipments
to Ethiopia.
As the motorcade passed and
later during the visit, the protest
ers waved flags and chanted. At
least one plane flying overhead

towed a sign reading, "Gorby, free
the Baltic states."
"The American public is so in
love with Gorby they are not
paying attention," said Vazken
Mousesian, a Cupertino resident
of Armenian descent. "We want
the Soviet army to stop the
bloodshed in Armenia. We don't
want independence at this point.
We just want to stop the killing
of innocent people."
Gorbachev appeared undis
turbed by the demonstrations,
which he has faced throughout
his North American trip during
the last week.
All in all, yesterday's visit ap
peared to go off without a hitch
— and it was the perfect public
relations opportunity for Stan
ford.
Television pictures of the sun
splashed Quad and a lavishly
decorated Memorial Auditorium
stage were broadcast across the
country last night. And Kennedy,
well aware of his larger audience,
introduced Gorbachev by listing
several of Stanford's attributes,
including "the country's longest
accelerator and its best women's
basketball team."
Raisa Gorbachev skipped out
early from the Stanford visit and
left sometime before her hus
band's Memorial Auditorium
speech began. Scheduled to go on
a minutely scheduled hour-long
tourist swing through San Fran
cisco, Mrs. Gorbachev instead
went on an impromptu trip that
included a chat at a mom-and-pop
grocery store and a chance to ring
the bell on a motorized cable car.
Her husband's motorcade left
the campus at 2 p.m. and headed
back to the City, where he later
addressed a gathering of top West
Coast executives.
Gorbachev ended his U.S. tour
in dramatic fashion in a meeting
with South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo. Just before Gorbachev
was to head home to his own
troubled country, he and Roh
agreed to work toward establish
ing full diplomatic relations —
which the two countries have not
enjoyed since the formation of
South Korea at the end of World
War 11.

band's Memorial Auditorium
speech began. Scheduled to go on
a minutely scheduled hour-long
tourist swing through San Fran
cisco, Mrs. Gorbachev instead
went on an impromptu trip that
included a chat at a mom-and-pop
grocery store and a chance to ring
the bell on a motorized cable car.
Her husband's motorcade left
the campus at 2 p.m. and headed
back to the City, where he later
addressed a gathering of top West
Coast executives.
Gorbachev ended his U.S. tour
in dramatic fashion in a meeting
with South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo. Just before Gorbachev
was to head home to his own
troubled country, he and Roh
agreed to work toward establish
ing full diplomatic relations —
which the two countries have not
enjoyed since the formation of
South Korea at the end of World
War 11.

In a whirlwind of smiles,
speeches, camera flashes and
chants of protest, Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev extended an
open hand to the Stanford campus
yesterday on one of the final legs
of his five-day visit to the United
States.
Introduced by University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy as "the ar
chitect of a great world trans
formation," Gorbachev charmed
many during a visit that cul
minated in the Soviet leader's dec
laration to a cheering audience:
"The Cold War is now behind us.
Let us not wrangle over who won
it."
Gorbachev, arriving at the Oval
nearly an hour late, wasted no
time in plunging into the crowds
of the Quad to shake hands and
exchange greetings with the thou
sands of well-wishers there —
some of whom waited more than
four hours in the hot sun to catch
a glimpse of him.
The 47-car motorcade of the So
viet delegation raced down
Campus Drive and turned onto
Palm Drive at 11:50 a.m., just an
hour after Gorbachev concluded
a breakfast discussion with
former President Reagan in San
Francisco. Gorbachev and his wife
Raisa emerged from their car sur
rounded by a tight ring of Secret
Service and KGB agents and were
barely visible to television
cameras as they greeted Kennedy
and other members of the wel
coming party.
Rather than walking to the cen
ter of the Quad as scheduled, Gor
bachev immediately veered to the
right to greet the 10-row-deep
throngs of students, faculty and
staff, many of whom were cheer
ing wildly and pushing against a
metal barricade in front of them.
Surrounded by at least 50 dig
nitaries and Secret Service agents,
Gorbachev walked around the
perimeter of the crowd, stopping
several times to shake hands.
Kennedy, walking at Gorba
chev's side, attempted to describe
the Quad buildings and give a
brief tour, said Marlene Wine, an
aide to Kennedy. He soon gave
up, however, saying with some
humor, "This is out of control."
After circling the Quad, the en
tourage emerged through the
Quad entrance facing Green Li
brary. Responding to cheers, Gor
bachev waved and clasped his
hands triumphantly.
Though broadcast reports had
speculated that some part of the
Stanford agenda would have to be
dropped to make up time, the only
event cut short was a tour of the

Art Gallery. Art Department
Chair Wanda Corn instead greeted
the Gorbachevs outside the
gallery, where several students
and two Bay Area artists pre
sented their works.
Then it was on to another ren
dezvous with cheering crowds,
holding cameras high above their
heads and clamoring for hand
shakes as Gorbachev made his
way to Littlefield Center. There,
he met with a group of 37 selected
faculty and students for a 20-
minute discussion.
The visit wrapped up with a
nationally televised address at
Memorial Auditorium. In his
speech, Gorbachev declared,
"Now, our common responsibility
is to make sure mechanisms of
East-West military confrontation
are dismantled as soon as possi
ble."
He further called for scientists
in both the United States and So
viet Union to join in determining
how nuclear weapons could be
destroyed without harming people
or the environment, and advo
cated a system of international
alliances that unites rather than
divides the world.
The 28-minute speech was
punctuated with several bursts of
applause from the 1,700-member
audience, and Gorbachev received
four standing ovations.
In perhaps the day's most sym
bolic act, Kennedy and Graduate
School of Business Prof. George
Shultz presented Gorbachev with
a framed 1921 Russian poster
from the Hoover Institution ar
chives. The poster depicts Russian
students learning to read and
bears an inscription from the Rus
sian poet Alexander Pushkin:
"Long live the sun! May the dark
ness be hidden!"
Perhaps the only clouds hang
ing over Gorbachev during his
visit were the hundreds of pro
testers lined along Palm Drive and
the Oval demonstrating support
for Baltic state independence and
an end to Soviet arms shipments
to Ethiopia.
As the motorcade passed and
later during the visit, the protest
ers waved flags and chanted. At
least one plane flying overhead

towed a sign reading, "Gorby, free
the Baltic states."
"The American public is so in
love with Gorby they are not
paying attention," said Vazken
Mousesian, a Cupertino resident
of Armenian descent. "We want
the Soviet army to stop the
bloodshed in Armenia. We don't
want independence at this point.
We just want to stop the killing
of innocent people."
Gorbachev appeared undis
turbed by the demonstrations,
which he has faced throughout
his North American trip during
the last week.
All in all, yesterday's visit ap
peared to go off without a hitch
— and it was the perfect public
relations opportunity for Stan
ford.
Television pictures of the sun
splashed Quad and a lavishly
decorated Memorial Auditorium
stage were broadcast across the
country last night. And Kennedy,
well aware of his larger audience,
introduced Gorbachev by listing
several of Stanford's attributes,
including "the country's longest
accelerator and its best women's
basketball team."
Raisa Gorbachev skipped out
early from the Stanford visit and
left sometime before her hus
band's Memorial Auditorium
speech began. Scheduled to go on
a minutely scheduled hour-long

cisco, Mrs. Gorbachev instead
