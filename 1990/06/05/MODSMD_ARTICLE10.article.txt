## Messenger should not be blamed for unwanted message

I THINK IT IS important to keep
The Daily's recent stories about the
League of Revolutionary Struggle
in perspective. It is becoming plain
that they did reveal some facts about
League involvement here that members
of this community have a right to
know.
It is equally plain that whatever
external influences may have been
involved, there is a deep and entirely
indigenous concern on the part of
Students here for multicultural values.
It would not be fair to dismiss that
concern as the invention of some out
side organization.
On the other hand, some troubling
questions are raised by the presence on
campus of a group that has secret
membership and a private agenda.
Why, one needs to ask, should it

choose to be secret — especially in an
environment that values and promotes
freedom of speech and openness? Per
haps more important, are there pat
terns of proselytizing or of acquiring
political power that exploit secrecy so
as to mislead others as to real pur
poses? These are questions that should
not be avoided.
In response to the article there has
been a wave of criticism of The Daily
itself — ranging from perfectly proper
disagreement with the content or con
clusions of the article to calls for
apologies by The Daily or dismissal of
a writer. The latter strike me as ex
treme. It is prefectly proper for the
campus media to undertake and to
publish a piece of investigative report
ing. Where the assertions are false,
then plainly a correction is warranted.

But where they are true, why should
anyone propose to shoot the mes
senger?
Of course the temptation to do that
is understandable. Like many of The
Daily's critics I am troubled when the
future of our multicultural agenda is
threatened. But in assessing the dam
age and fixing blame, it is important
to be fair and realistic.
On a number of occasions during the
past two years I have expressed con
cern that these important objectives for
our community are being laden with a
separate and distinct political agenda
that will prove too heavy for them to
carry. That fear has been borne out by
the experiences of many students who
are now coming forward to report that
to support multicultural objectives they
were asked to adopt accompanying

idealogies with which they found them
selves in disagreement. The Daily story
and its sequels have thus added signif
icantly to those concerns.
A final note: If anyone in this com
munity has experience with unfavora
ble treatment in The Daily, surely it is
I — along with my colleagues.
Had The Daily's coverage of the
League been directed at this more
usual target, I wonder how many
people would be demanding half-page
apologies, calling for suspensions or
likening the approach to "McCar
thyism" — a charge that only amuses
those of us who actually lived with the
real thing. Freedom of the press, like
other vital values in this society, must
be evaluated under a single standard.
