# Citizens should not be forced to reveal their affiliations

The distribution of anonymous
leaflets attacking Gordon Chang for his
political beliefs preceded by a similar
attack in The Stanford Review and
followed by a series of articles in The
Daily purporting to investigate the
activities of the League of Revolution
ary Struggle at Stanford threaten to
create an unhealthy climate of suspi
cion on campus.
Since many people regard The Stan
ford Review and the anonymous
leaflets as plain silly, there may be a
tendency to disregard them and hope
that they will be ignored. But those
with longer historical memories than
The Daily who may be innocently
pursuing what appears to be merely a
hot story cannot but be reminded of

the corrosive and destructive effects
that similar campaigns to expose politi
cal organizations and purify political
life from subversive influences have
had in the not too distant past.
We have been here before; it is called
McCarthyism. During the 19505,
similar witch hunts were conducted on
college campuses to ferret out commu
nists and "un-American" types so as to
prevent them from polluting the minds
of the young. Many professors, along
with others in all walks of life, lost
their livelihood and careers as anti
communist hysteria overcame the na
tion.
In retrospect, it is clear that the
infringement of personal liberty, the
denial of academic freedom, the atmos
phere of fear and the narrowing of the
minds of that generation were far
more dangerous to democratic political
life than anything communists or those
suspected of being communist could
have accomplished.
It is especially unfortunate that alle
gations about the League have been

focused on the activities of the minor
ity students on campus. Minority stu
dents are capable of running their or
ganizations without advice from others.
Political disagreements about how such
organizations should be run and what
tactics to adopt to pursue various ob
jectives are a normal and legitimate
part of their activity.
Accusations and innuendos about the
political beliefs and affiliations of stu
dents, faculty and staff at Stanford
should be met with a clear and un
equivocal response. In this country,
citizens have the right to reveal or not
reveal their membership in a political
organization, be it the League of
Revolutionary Struggle or the Republi
can Party. Membership or nonmember
ship in a political organization is not a
valid criterion for employment in any
position at Stanford University or
anywhere else.
