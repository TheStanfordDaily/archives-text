The recent uproar over the ASSU
recall makes us nauseous.
We find it ridiculous that resume
stuffing wanna-be politicians (i.e. all
the people involved with the ASSU)
are ripping each other limb from limb
for control of an organization whose
highest calling seems to be the forma
tion of an "Entertainment Shuttle" to
downtown Palo Alto.
Such turmoil and conflict over
pseudo-politics to the neglect of
legitimate student concerns only serves
to further discredit student government
in the eyes of Stanford students, most
of whom could now care less about
which bozos run the ASSU.
