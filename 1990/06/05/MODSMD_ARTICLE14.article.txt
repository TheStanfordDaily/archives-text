## David Brown People's Platform has done much to serve the student body 
### 
WHEN I ARRIVED at Stanford,
I never thought that I would
be involved in student politics
at all, much less in the midst of a
controversy over a supposed Marxist-
Leninist cult manipulating Stanford's
student government.
My freshman year I spent my time
swimming as a part of the varsity
swim team, training at UC-Berkeley in
the Navy ROTC, skimming my West
ern Culture readings and doing crazy
things with my dorm, Madera. I cared
about campus issues and participated
in a couple of things, but I didn't
really see what I could do.
But after seeing students around me
take action to counter injustices such
as racism and to shape the direction of
their own education, I decided that I
too wanted to be a part of the move
ment for democracy at Stanford. I
volunteered to help with the 1987 You
Can Make a Difference Conference,
which addressed "Institutional Racism:
The Struggle for Change." I also joined
the effort to bring about changes in
the Western Culture program.
Through this involvement, I met
other students who cared deeply about
issues and about one another. These
students put in numerous hours work
ing to change society and to make life
better not only for students at Stan
ford, but also for the outside communi
ty.
I tried to better understand the
world and in that process I partici
pated in numerous discussions and
attended several programs, including
some sponsored by Student Unity
Network. We discussed world and
national issues, ranging from Nicara
gua to Eastern Europe to the struggles

of Pittston coal miners in Virginia and,
yes, we discussed socialism. I am not
now, nor have I ever been, afraid of
discussing and understanding new
ideas.
And, yes, my politics and views do
guide my actions. I believe in govern
ment, on whatever level, that has an
eye for progress, addresses the most
crucial issues of its constituents and is
truly responsive to the needs of the
people. This is my vision for America,
and while I am at Stanford it is my
vision for the ASSU. Thus I am now
and have always been committed to
serving and representing the will of
Stanford students. And despite all the
euphoria and excitement surrounding
Gorbachev's visit to Stanford, the
ASSU is not now nor has it ever been
"manipulated" by any outside "com
munist" forces.
After two years of serving the stu
dent body as a member of the Council
of Presidents, I have learned a great
deal. In many ways, I really enjoyed it.
I got a chance to meet hundreds of
students, students who come from so
many different kinds of backgrounds
and offer so many varied and fascinat
ing perspectives. I had the opportunity
to work with students on issues rang
ing from the alchohol policy to ethnic
studies. And I can honestly say that I
learned something from just about
every student that I had a chance to
work with.
But, of course, two years of serving
on the COP is not all fun and games.
Spending late hours at the ASSU
offices planning "Beat the Bookstore"
for the sixth time takes a real commit
ment to service. So does enduring the
personal attacks that public figures

often undergo. Sometimes I find myself
wishing that I had never run for COP,
but when I work with students on
some kind of project or discuss impor
tant issues with them, I remember
why I decided to be involved again
next year as an ASSU senator.
Definitely the most difficult part of
my time as COP has been seeing
myself attacked in print so often.
Several months ago, The Review com
pared me to former Romanian dictator,
Nicolai Ceaucescu, a man responsible
for the deaths of thousands. On other
occasions, Review writers have called
me a "communist" and reported that I
have "apologized for being white."
Because these charges were in a publi
cation that so few people take serious
ly, I refused to dignify these attacks
with a response. In fact, several frosh
in my dorm told me in response that,
"any enemy of The Review is a friend
of mine. Keep up the good work,
Dave!"
But the attacks kept coming. Appar
ently The Review was so outraged by
the thought of a white male taking a
stand for multiculturalism that they
felt the need to mention my name
every week. But is it really so strange
that a white male supports affirmitive
action? Is it so strange that a white
male supported the CIV proposal? Is it
so strange that a white male supports
these issues that the only explanation
they can come up with is that I must
be a brainwashed communist?
The reality is that most white stu
dents care about these issues and want
to "do the right thing." So when The
Review attacks me for what I am
trying to accomplish, in many ways it
is also attacking all those students who

take issues of multiculturalism serious
ly, who want to examine their own
attitudes and feelings and who want to
work to build a society free of ills such
as racism, poverty and injustice.
While The Review openly (and un
justly) attacked myself and the People's
Platform, The Daily observed a media
blackout on the ASSU. In other words,
it refused to report on any of the
ASSU's positive work so students
wouldn't be informed of what we did.
Then after the elections, The Daily
proceeded to create a lot of hype about
cartoon characters and about the
ASSU not being an "open" organiza
tion. Following on the heels of these
distortions and half-truths, The Daily
has now attacked the ASSU for being
"infiltrated" by communists. (By the
way, I find it ironic that The Review
has not published during the past
three weeks. I guess they didn't need
to with The Daily doing such a fine
job of attacking the People's Plat
form!!)
So what's all the hype about? I
mean, what is so scary about the
People's Platform anyway? We're just
students like everyone else, and yes we
do care about making a difference! So
what have we done to serve the stu
dent body? Before we took office,
nobody had heard of student participa
tion in student government. Today,
hundreds of students are active in open
committees. Before we took office,
women and students of color had nary
a voice in the Senate, but over the
past four years we have changed that.
Before we took office, nobody could
believe that the ASSU could lead a
campaign around a relevant educa
tional issue. But just last year the

COP brought together grads and un
dergrads to win an 8 percent increase
in the budget for the under-funded
teaching assistant program. Before we
took office the majority of students
couldn't voice their opinion on impor
tant student issues. Now through the
use of Dorm Polls, students are able to
positively influence administrators to
alter their proposed alcohol policy.
I ask only that I be judged for my
stance on the issues and the contribu
tions I have made to this university. I
am accountable to students, and 1 will
always do what I feel is right. I am
honest about what I believe in and
about my "agenda." I certainly am not
manipulated by any kind of outside
force, and anything I do is with the
best of intentions and the most honest
of motivations.
If anyone wants to attack me for
what I have actually done or for what
I actually stand for, go right ahead. I
believe that student government leaders
must hold accountability as their most
important value, and I will listen to
what you have to say But I refuse to
take seriously people who instead
engage in unfair and unreasonable
smear campaigns to discredit me. In
some ways I regret having to take the
time to defend myself, but this year
has proven a bit too much for me. I
can only hope that next year The Daily
will be more interested in contributing
to a process of healing and moving
ahead, together, to build a better
Stanford.
