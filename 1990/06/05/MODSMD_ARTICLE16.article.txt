## Students hide away at Hopkins 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
Sitting by a north window in
Green Library, you might resent
the same old view of Hoover
Tower, passing bikers dashing
madly for class and perhaps a bird
or two. But if you were in the
glass-lined reading room of the
Harold A. Miller Library at Hop
kins Marine Station instead, you
would get quite a different view.
There, you might admire the
sight of waves gently beating
against the algae-covered rocks.
Or perhaps you would enjoy
watching sea gulls strolling on the
shore or even an occasional sea
otter, floating on its back and nib
bling on a starfish lunch.
Each year, a group of Stanford
students has a chance to go south
for a quarter on a spring get-away
in Monterey Bay. Instead of study
ing abroad, Hopkins offers stu
dents an opportunity to do
individual research in beautiful
surroundings.
Hopkins is part of the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences.
Though the spring course is
geared primarily for biology stu

dents, there are traditionally
several students mqjoring in other
related disciplines, says Mark
Denny, assistant professor at Hop
kins and coordinator of the
program.
"Each spring, around 22 stu
dents arrive at Hopkins, with in
terests in biology, human biology,
geology and psychology. We even
have a symbolic systems msyor
doing research on neural net
works," says Denny.
This year Denny is experiment
ing with the way this popular
course is taught. "We have
switched from a focus on specific
organisms, fish for example, and
focused instead on various scien
tific disciplines and concepts like
neurophysiology," says Dennis
Powers, director of Hopkins since
last year.
In the past, students initially
attended a series of lectures on a
chosen marine animal. Afterward,
they chose research projects that
used that particular animal as a
model. This spring, the students
are encouraged to focus on con
cepts, instead of a single marine
organism.
"Each professor gives a lecture

on a particular angle of biology
and the problems of marine re
search. Students then design proj
ects that attempt to solve these
problems and answer these ques
tions," says Sam Wong, a graduate
student at Hopkins and one of
the teaching assistants for the
course. "Some students have no
lab techniques. The aim is at least
understanding the problem they
are studying," Wong continues.
At the end of the quarter, each
student presents the results of his
or her research project at a sym
posium. "Around one-fourth of

the papers presented are pub
lished," says Wong.
The research projects chosen
depend on the interests of the stu
dents. James Biggs, an undergrad
uate in biology, is studying squid
egg cases. "It's interesting that
there is no fungal or bacterial
growth on them. They are sur
rounded by a mucus layer that
the bacteria cannot digest
through. It is a sort of antibiotic,"
says Biggs.
Another student, Simone Alin,
is measuring the distribution of
ion channels in the neudibranch
species, Melibe Leonina. "We are
using a molluskan preparation to
understand how single slug
neurons work," says Alin. "You're
doing a project that hasn't been
done before. It's really exciting to
know you're uncovering a piece
of knowledge," continues Alin.
Other projects include studying
how sharks swim and videotaping
the beha\ioral patterns of harbor
seals underwater.
Students come to Hopkins for
many reasons — whether it is
because they have a passion for
the sea or a hatred of the dull
view from Green Library.
