# Consumers find it's not easy being green
## 
### Jessica Hirst Staff writer 
Beware, the "greenness" of en
vironmentally safe products may
not go beyond the color of the
packaging. Case in point: a plastic
bag from Pay Less Drug Store
emblazoned with the words,
"Reduce, Re-Use, Recycle," on one
side, and touting "photode
gradeability" on the other.
Pay Less is undoubtedly aware
of the green consumerism craze
sweeping the nation. A July 1989
survey showed that 77 percent of
Americans make purchases based
in part on a company's environ
mental reputation. In the rush to
take advantage of a hot new mar
keting angle, many companies
have picked up the buzzwords of
the environmentally chic —
"biodegradeable," "green," "CFC
free," "recycled" and "non
polluting."
But well-meaning customers
may not realize that these words,
while highly marketable, do not
necessarily mean environmental
responsibility. There is little or no
light in a landfill, so the Pay Less
bag that decomposes "in a matter
of months leaving no unsightly

by-products" will probably still be
intact years after being thrown
away.
Furthermore, a study con
ducted by Greenpeace and the
Center of the Biology of Natural
Systems demonstrated that
"photodegradeable" plastics may
break down into very small pieces,
but it remains unproven whether
or not they are biodegradeable.
Unless the plastics can be
metabolized by microorganisms in
the soils they are not truly
biodegradeable. Rather, they are
little more than "environmentally
safe dust," to quote another shop
ping bag. On the way to becoming
that dust, the plastics may emit
toxic substances in the form of
additives and colorants.
Many companies have felt pres
sure to keep up with consumers
who demand the same high level
of convenience they have enjoyed
in the past coupled with the as
surance of a clean planet. They
advertise themselves in glowing
terms, using images of nature,
government regulations and facts
about the product's ecological
safety.

stream by removing the cor
rugated dividers from cold cup
shipping cases, cutting 2 million
pounds of packaging annually.
They have also begun a recycling
program in New England for their
polystyrene packaging.
Polystyrene? Doesn't that con
tain chlorofluorocarbons, the
ozone eaters? McDonald's antici
pated that question, so they pub
lished literature informing
customers that McDonald's was
the first restaurant chain to phase
out "fully halogenated CFCa" in
1987. They went on to describe
their polystyrene as 100 percent
recyclable, and as the only over
the-counter food packaging cur
rently recycled.
McDonald's legitimates their
claims of ozone protection with
Environmental Protection Agency
definitions of CFCs. The EPA says
that CFC-22, the blowing agent
used in McDonald's trays, is

"technically not a CFC."
With all the rhetoric and mixed
motivations it can be difficult for
consumers to make informed de
cisions. Most people care enough
about the environment to buy a
product that appears "green," but
few people are informed enough
to know the entire truth behind
the advertising.
One solution is to start inde
pendent or government organiza
tions to investigate products and
label them for consumers. That
can be an expensive process and
just as open to corruption as the
current system.
Another do-it-yourself solution
is to become more informed on
environmental issues and what
these claims actually mean. There
are some simple rules of thumb
to follow.
First, question whether you
need the product in the first place
— do you really need fabric sof
tener or a disposable camera?
Then try to buy the products with
the least packaging and avoid
styrofoam. Buy items in bulk.
When you shop, bring your own
bag and avoid the paper or plastic
question altogether.
