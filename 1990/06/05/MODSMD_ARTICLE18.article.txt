# Batteries keep cool

pv . / seem to remember that
vy • my dad used to keep used
batteries in the refrigerator.
Does this really do anything or
did 1 just grow up in a weird
family?
A. The bugs would have
• liked to address this ques
tion experimentally, but un
fortunately our refrigerator
here at Bug Research Park is
chock full of Purina Bug Chow
and whatever fungus it is that
likes it as much as we do.
Frankly, we are scared to go
anywhere near the thing.
Our telephone is in fine
working order though, and a
quick call was made to the
Eveready Corporation. After an
exhilarating game of hot potato
bug, we were passed ofF to the
very pleasant Angela Jordan.
Angela explained that put
ting your batteries in the
refrigerator can indeed do
something for them; it can
short them out. When room
temperature air hits the cold
surface of the battery casing
when the refrigerator door is
opened, condensation forms. If
enough condensation accum
ulates, current can flow be
tween the battery's terminals,
depleting it of charge.
Eveready recommends
storing your batteries in a cool
(but not cold), dry place. This
will ensure the best possible
performance from your boom
box's C-cells when you go to
the seashore this summer.
As to whether your family is
weird, the Bugs are not sure
whether caching batteries next
to last week's meat loaf
qualifies them for that distinc
tion. The Bugs would hate to
think what their fungus collec
tion qualifies them for.
. It seems that Physics 51
vJ/ • has poisoned my brain.
Whenever I drive on the curvy
parts of route 84 near Wood
side, I can't help wondering
how they decide what speeds
should be posted on the sharp
curves. Does Caltrans have a
staff physicist who calculates
the maximum safe speed?
A. Our non-nerdy friends
• laughed when we sugges
ted that Caltrans actually cal
culated the safe speeds. They

said that introductory physics
didn't apply to the real world,
and besides, it would be much
more exciting to drive those
corners faster and faster until
you wipe out, then post a
"wimp speed" 20 MPH slower.
We were sulking in the corner
with our slide rules when some
one suggested that we give
Caltrans a call.
Bob Halligan, Caltrans dis
trict public affairs officer, told
us that they do calculate the
advisory speed limits posted on
almost all highway curves. (So
much for the "cowabunga"
method.) The radial accelera
tion (g-force) a car experiences
while cornering is equal to the
square of the speed divided by
the radius of the turn. So the
faster you go or the tighter the
turn, the more G-force, the
more likely a wipeout.
The safe speeds are calcu
lated so that a car will not ex
perience enough radial
acceleration to lose traction.
For example, the average
freeway ofT-ramp has a radius
of 300 to 350 feet and an ad
visory limit of 35 MPH (about
0.25 g's — well within safe
limits). On route 84, where
curves can have a radius of 60
feet, the posted limits go down
to 15 MPH (also 0.25 g's).
In addition to Newtonian
Mechanics, Caltrans considers
how well you can see around
the corner and the quality of
the road surface, among other
things.
