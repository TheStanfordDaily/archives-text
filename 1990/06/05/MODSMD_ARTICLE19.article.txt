## 11-run inning shocks Card nine into loser's bracket 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — So much for
doing things the easy way.
The Stanford baseball team's
high-wire act took a massive fall
Sunday night, getting walloped,
whomped and pounded 16-2 by
the Georgia Bulldogs. The thrash
ing, which followed a precarious,
less-than-spectacular win against
Georgia Southern on Friday,
throws Stanford into the loser's
bracket of the College World Se
ries.
One more tumble, and the Car
dinal's 1990 show is over.

Cardinal 5, Eagles 4
Bulldogs 16, Cardinal 2

For the Cardinal to reach Sat
urday's NCAA championship
game, it must defeat Mississippi
State today at 1:07 p.m. (PST),
then beat Georgia tomorrow
night, and then beat Georgia
again on Friday. All Georgia has
to do is win one of its two games
against either the Cardinal or
MSU to get to the final.
"It won't be easy," a somber
Paul Carey said after Sunday's
fiasco. However, it has been done
before. "In '88 we lost this game
to Cal State-Fullerton, and in '87
we lost to Oklahoma State, and
we came back to win the national
title both times," Carey said. "We
just have to come together and
focus.
"I wouldn't count us out."
Neither would anyone else, but
a standing eight-count might be
in order. The Stanford bats are
in danger of slipping into a coma
— the team is batting a subter
ranean 13-for-67 (.194) so far in
the CWS — and its pitching staff,
which had cruised for a game and
a half, was pounded on for the
last four innings of Sunday's
game.
"We just got a good whipping,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "They beat us every which
way."
The weekend certainly hadn't
begun that way. Stan Spencer,
who started Friday's 5-4 10-inning
win over Georgia Southern, was
merely his same old self: nine in
nings, eight hits, 12 strikeouts
and no walks. After giving up a
quick run in the first, Spencer
mowed down nearly everyone in
the Eagle lineup. "Lately it seems
like it takes me a little while to
get going," Spencer said. "I don't
know what it is."
Whatever it is, it worked, and
it kept Stanford in the game long
enough for the Eagles to hand
them a win. Or, to be specific,

long enough for the Eagles to
throw them a win: three of the
Cardinal's runs were direct
results of throwing errors, which
were only a small part of perhaps
the most sloppily-played game
Stanford has been involved in this
year (see related story).
In the first, with Troy Paulsen
on third thanks to a monster
triple to right-center, David
McCarty hit the ball right back
to pitcher Joey Hamilton. Hamil
ton had Paulsen dead to rights,
hung up between third and home,
so he charged at him . .. whirled,
tried to throw out McCarty at
first, and tossed the ball halfway
to lowa.
Anyone home? "I don't know
what I was thinking," Hamilton
said. "I looked at him and I just
froze."
Roger Burnett made it 2-1 in
the second when he tripled in Da
vid Holbrook, and then scored
when second baseman Doug
Eder's relay throw dribbled into
the Cardinal dugout.
Spencer plus a two-run lead
equals a win, right? Nope. Georgia
Southern got back to 3-2 (thanks
to an error by Tim Griffin) and
then, in the sixth, seemed to take
the lead back with a two-run
homer by catcher Rob Fitzpatrick.

Or not. The ball, which
Fitzpatrick absolutely crushed to
center, hit off one of the outfield
advertising signs and bounced
back on to the field. The rule of
thumb at Rosenblatt Stadium is
that the lower tier of signs is still
in the park, while anything hit
off the second level is a home run.
In this case, if the ball hit the
Shop-Vac sign, it was a homer;

off the AAA sign, a double.
The problem was no one saw
where the ball actually hit. The
third-base umpire, who had re
sponsibility for the play, said he
lost the ball in the white back
ground of the signs and based his
call — double, ball still in play —
partly on center fielder Jeff Ham

monds' reaction. Hammonds has
assumed the ball was still live and
thrown it back to the infield in
a hurry.
So, Jeff, where'd it hit? "I put
my head down waiting for the
bounce, and the next thing I knew
the ball was at my feet," Ham
monds said. "To tell you the truth,
I didn't see where it hit."
The call stood, and the Eagles
had men at second and third with
no outs (Todd Greene, who had
been on second, had assumed
home run and jogged toward third
before realizing what was happen
ing). Two strikeouts and a horrid
squeeze-play attempt later, the
Eagles were done in the sixth —
with zero runs to show for it.
The Eagles weren't about to
blame the umpires, even though
they were later told that replays
on ESPN apparently showed the
ball hitting the upper fence. "Um
pires are paid to umpire," Eagle
Coach Jack Stallings said. "He
was out there in good position. . . .
People in the dugout probably
have the worst vantage point of
anyone. I'm not going to question
the umpires."
Griping would do no good, be
cause the Eagles ended up blowing
the game fair and square. After
Georgia Southern scored an error
assisted run in the top of the 10th
to make it 4-3, Burnett led off
with a single. Troy Tallman tried
to bunt him to second, but hit
the ball too hard. Hamilton picked
it up, threw to second, and then
watched Burnett scamper to third
when the ball rolled into the out
field. First and third, no outs.
Hammonds lined out to right,
too shallow to score Burnett, but
Greene launched a throw home
just to make sure. Oops! Burnett
had held up, but then saw the
ball flying off into space, nowhere
near the plate. Hamilton was
backing up the play, but never
even saw the ball (Can you say
"Asleep at the wheel?"). Burnett
scored standing up, and Tallman
motored down to second.
Two pitches later, Paulsen hit

a liner to center, Tallman flew
home, and pandemonium des
cended on the Stanford bench.
"We knew we could come back,"
said Paulsen, who finished 3-for
5. "The times we've needed to
come back, we've done it. You
can't hang your heads at that
point."
The mood was just a bit differ
ent two days later, even though
the game with Georgia had all
the makings of a blowout early.
Pitcher Mike Mussina picked up
where Spencer left off, striking
out six Bulldogs in the first two
innings, and nine overall through
five, thanks to his speed-of-sound
fastball and a curve that made
the Bulldogs look foolish.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Bulldog pitcher Mike Rebhan
wasn't letting anyone (except
Carey) do anything, either: After
five innings, Stanford had only
two hits — both by Carey — but
did have a two-zip lead thanks to
Carey's 16th home run and a
stumbling, bumbling, I'll-get
there-somehow run scored by
McCarty on an error.
Both pitchers were cruising —
Rebhan at a somewhat slower
speed, but cruising nonetheless —
until the sixth, which is when
Mussina slammed into a concrete
wall.
"Early on it looked like I'd have
good stuff, but then I faded away
faster than usual," Mussina said.
"It's just one of those things. .. .
I got tired a lot earlier than I'm
used to. Even when I was out
warming up for the sixth, I knew
I didn't have it."
That's putting it mildly: Mus
sina faced seven batters in the
inning, and six of them got hits
(including catcher Terry (.178)
Childers, who finished the game
4-for-5. Go figure). By the time
he left, with men on first and
third, it was 4-2 Georgia.
Eight batters and two Stanford
pitchers later it was 11-2, as the
Bulldogs tied a CWS record for
most runs in an inning. That, plus
a just-in-case five-run rally in the
ninth, took care of the evening's
business.
"[Mussinal went through the
lineup the first two times pretty

quickly," said Georgia's Doug Rad
ziewicz, "but once we adjusted,
we were fine. He was trying to
beat us with the high fastball be
cause he's probably the hardest
thrower we've faced all year —
the easiest pitch to see is the one
that's up near your eyes. As soon
as we started laying off the high
stuff, we got a couple hits and
started rolling."
It wasn't something the players
suddenly decided to do, however.
"It was the coaches — we'd come
back in after the third, fourth and
fifth innings and they'd say 'Lay
off the high stuff, lay off the high
stuff,' " Radziewicz said. "It fi
nally got through our thick
heads."
Georgia now gets to wait until
tomorrow to face the winner of
the Stanford-MSU contest. "It
doesn't matter who we face," Rad
ziewicz said. "We've beaten them
both, and that's enough for
anybody to get mad."
Card notes
An elderly Georgia fan joked toward
the end of Sunday's massacre that
"The bottom line is, you just can't
teach educated boys to play baseball."
Said fan was immediately asked by
the Daily's ever-objective baseball
writer how many NCAA, baseball titles
Georgia has won. He was then cour
teously told what he could do with
Georgia's first championship — if they
ever win one.
An ugly rumor has it that President
George Bush will be on hand for Fri
day's games. An even uglier rumor
has him staying at the Mariott hotel,
which is where the Stanford entou
rage has been squeezing. The rumors
may explain all the guys running
around in ugly suits and cheap sun
glasses.

In case you ever need to study in
Omaha, the public library closes at
8:30 p.m. weekdays, closed on Sun
days.
The wind at Rosenblatt has
averaged about 600 mph over the first
four days of the CWS, playing hell
with fly balls and the temperature.

The Stanford baseball team's

Sunday night, getting walloped,

Cardinal 5, Eagles 4
Bulldogs 16, Cardinal 2

For the Cardinal to reach Sat
urday's NCAA championship
game, it must defeat Mississippi
State today at 1:07 p.m. (PST),
then beat Georgia tomorrow
night, and then beat Georgia
again on Friday. All Georgia has
to do is win one of its two games
against either the Cardinal or
MSU to get to the final.
"It won't be easy," a somber
Paul Carey said after Sunday's
fiasco. However, it has been done
before. "In '88 we lost this game
to Cal State-Fullerton, and in '87
we lost to Oklahoma State, and
we came back to win the national
title both times," Carey said. "We
just have to come together and
focus.
"I wouldn't count us out."
Neither would anyone else, but
a standing eight-count might be
in order. The Stanford bats are
in danger of slipping into a coma
— the team is batting a subter
ranean 13-for-67 (.194) so far in
the CWS — and its pitching staff,
which had cruised for a game and
a half, was pounded on for the
last four innings of Sunday's
game.
"We just got a good whipping,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "They beat us every which
way."
The weekend certainly hadn't
begun that way. Stan Spencer,
who started Friday's 5-4 10-inning
win over Georgia Southern, was
merely his same old self: nine in
nings, eight hits, 12 strikeouts
and no walks. After giving up a
quick run in the first, Spencer
mowed down nearly everyone in
the Eagle lineup. "Lately it seems
like it takes me a little while to
get going," Spencer said. "I don't
know what it is."
Whatever it is, it worked, and
it kept Stanford in the game long
enough for the Eagles to hand
them a win. Or, to be specific,

long enough for the Eagles to
throw them a win: three of the
Cardinal's runs were direct
results of throwing errors, which
were only a small part of perhaps
the most sloppily-played game
Stanford has been involved in this
year (see related story).
In the first, with Troy Paulsen
on third thanks to a monster
triple to right-center, David
McCarty hit the ball right back
to pitcher Joey Hamilton. Hamil
ton had Paulsen dead to rights,
hung up between third and home,
so he charged at him . .. whirled,
tried to throw out McCarty at
first, and tossed the ball halfway
to lowa.
Anyone home? "I don't know
what I was thinking," Hamilton
said. "I looked at him and I just
froze."
Roger Burnett made it 2-1 in
the second when he tripled in Da
vid Holbrook, and then scored
when second baseman Doug
Eder's relay throw dribbled into
the Cardinal dugout.
Spencer plus a two-run lead
equals a win, right? Nope. Georgia
Southern got back to 3-2 (thanks
to an error by Tim Griffin) and
then, in the sixth, seemed to take
the lead back with a two-run
homer by catcher Rob Fitzpatrick.

Or not. The ball, which
Fitzpatrick absolutely crushed to
center, hit off one of the outfield
advertising signs and bounced
back on to the field. The rule of
thumb at Rosenblatt Stadium is
that the lower tier of signs is still
in the park, while anything hit
off the second level is a home run.
In this case, if the ball hit the
Shop-Vac sign, it was a homer;

off the AAA sign, a double.
The problem was no one saw
where the ball actually hit. The
third-base umpire, who had re
sponsibility for the play, said he
lost the ball in the white back
ground of the signs and based his
call — double, ball still in play —
partly on center fielder Jeff Ham

monds' reaction. Hammonds has
assumed the ball was still live and
thrown it back to the infield in
a hurry.
So, Jeff, where'd it hit? "I put
my head down waiting for the
bounce, and the next thing I knew
the ball was at my feet," Ham
monds said. "To tell you the truth,
I didn't see where it hit."
The call stood, and the Eagles
had men at second and third with
no outs (Todd Greene, who had
been on second, had assumed
home run and jogged toward third
before realizing what was happen
ing). Two strikeouts and a horrid
squeeze-play attempt later, the
Eagles were done in the sixth —
with zero runs to show for it.
The Eagles weren't about to
blame the umpires, even though
they were later told that replays
on ESPN apparently showed the
ball hitting the upper fence. "Um
pires are paid to umpire," Eagle
Coach Jack Stallings said. "He
was out there in good position. . . .
People in the dugout probably
have the worst vantage point of
anyone. I'm not going to question
the umpires."
Griping would do no good, be
cause the Eagles ended up blowing
the game fair and square. After
Georgia Southern scored an error
assisted run in the top of the 10th
to make it 4-3, Burnett led off
with a single. Troy Tallman tried
to bunt him to second, but hit
the ball too hard. Hamilton picked
it up, threw to second, and then
watched Burnett scamper to third
when the ball rolled into the out
field. First and third, no outs.
Hammonds lined out to right,
too shallow to score Burnett, but
Greene launched a throw home
just to make sure. Oops! Burnett
had held up, but then saw the
ball flying off into space, nowhere
near the plate. Hamilton was
backing up the play, but never
even saw the ball (Can you say
"Asleep at the wheel?"). Burnett
scored standing up, and Tallman
motored down to second.
Two pitches later, Paulsen hit

a liner to center, Tallman flew
home, and pandemonium des
cended on the Stanford bench.
"We knew we could come back,"
said Paulsen, who finished 3-for
5. "The times we've needed to
come back, we've done it. You
can't hang your heads at that
point."
The mood was just a bit differ
ent two days later, even though
the game with Georgia had all
the makings of a blowout early.
Pitcher Mike Mussina picked up
where Spencer left off, striking
out six Bulldogs in the first two
innings, and nine overall through
five, thanks to his speed-of-sound
fastball and a curve that made
the Bulldogs look foolish.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Bulldog pitcher Mike Rebhan
wasn't letting anyone (except
Carey) do anything, either: After
five innings, Stanford had only
two hits — both by Carey — but
did have a two-zip lead thanks to
Carey's 16th home run and a
stumbling, bumbling, I'll-get
there-somehow run scored by
McCarty on an error.
Both pitchers were cruising —
Rebhan at a somewhat slower
speed, but cruising nonetheless —
until the sixth, which is when
Mussina slammed into a concrete
wall.
"Early on it looked like I'd have
good stuff, but then I faded away
faster than usual," Mussina said.
"It's just one of those things. .. .
I got tired a lot earlier than I'm
used to. Even when I was out
warming up for the sixth, I knew
I didn't have it."
That's putting it mildly: Mus
sina faced seven batters in the
inning, and six of them got hits
(including catcher Terry (.178)
Childers, who finished the game
4-for-5. Go figure). By the time
he left, with men on first and
third, it was 4-2 Georgia.
Eight batters and two Stanford
pitchers later it was 11-2, as the
Bulldogs tied a CWS record for
most runs in an inning. That, plus
a just-in-case five-run rally in the
ninth, took care of the evening's
business.
"[Mussinal went through the
lineup the first two times pretty

quickly," said Georgia's Doug Rad
ziewicz, "but once we adjusted,
we were fine. He was trying to
beat us with the high fastball be
cause he's probably the hardest
thrower we've faced all year —
the easiest pitch to see is the one
that's up near your eyes. As soon
as we started laying off the high
stuff, we got a couple hits and
started rolling."
It wasn't something the players
suddenly decided to do, however.
"It was the coaches — we'd come
back in after the third, fourth and
fifth innings and they'd say 'Lay
off the high stuff, lay off the high
stuff,' " Radziewicz said. "It fi
nally got through our thick
heads."
Georgia now gets to wait until
tomorrow to face the winner of
the Stanford-MSU contest. "It
doesn't matter who we face," Rad
ziewicz said. "We've beaten them
both, and that's enough for
anybody to get mad."
Card notes
An elderly Georgia fan joked toward
the end of Sunday's massacre that
"The bottom line is, you just can't
teach educated boys to play baseball."
Said fan was immediately asked by
the Daily's ever-objective baseball
writer how many NCAA, baseball titles
Georgia has won. He was then cour
teously told what he could do with
Georgia's first championship — if they
ever win one.
An ugly rumor has it that President
George Bush will be on hand for Fri
day's games. An even uglier rumor
has him staying at the Mariott hotel,
which is where the Stanford entou
rage has been squeezing. The rumors
may explain all the guys running
around in ugly suits and cheap sun
glasses.

In case you ever need to study in
Omaha, the public library closes at
8:30 p.m. weekdays, closed on Sun
days.
The wind at Rosenblatt has
averaged about 600 mph over the first
four days of the CWS, playing hell
with fly balls and the temperature.

The Stanford baseball team's

Cardinal 5, Eagles 4
Bulldogs 16, Cardinal 2

For the Cardinal to reach Sat
urday's NCAA championship
game, it must defeat Mississippi
State today at 1:07 p.m. (PST),
then beat Georgia tomorrow
night, and then beat Georgia
again on Friday. All Georgia has
to do is win one of its two games
against either the Cardinal or
MSU to get to the final.
"It won't be easy," a somber
Paul Carey said after Sunday's
fiasco. However, it has been done
before. "In '88 we lost this game
to Cal State-Fullerton, and in '87
we lost to Oklahoma State, and
we came back to win the national
title both times," Carey said. "We
just have to come together and
focus.
"I wouldn't count us out."
Neither would anyone else, but
a standing eight-count might be
in order. The Stanford bats are
in danger of slipping into a coma
— the team is batting a subter
ranean 13-for-67 (.194) so far in
the CWS — and its pitching staff,
which had cruised for a game and
a half, was pounded on for the
last four innings of Sunday's
game.
"We just got a good whipping,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "They beat us every which
way."
The weekend certainly hadn't
begun that way. Stan Spencer,
who started Friday's 5-4 10-inning
win over Georgia Southern, was
merely his same old self: nine in
nings, eight hits, 12 strikeouts
and no walks. After giving up a
quick run in the first, Spencer
mowed down nearly everyone in
the Eagle lineup. "Lately it seems
like it takes me a little while to
get going," Spencer said. "I don't
know what it is."
Whatever it is, it worked, and
it kept Stanford in the game long
enough for the Eagles to hand
them a win. Or, to be specific,

long enough for the Eagles to
throw them a win: three of the
Cardinal's runs were direct
results of throwing errors, which
were only a small part of perhaps
the most sloppily-played game
Stanford has been involved in this
year (see related story).
In the first, with Troy Paulsen
on third thanks to a monster
triple to right-center, David
McCarty hit the ball right back
to pitcher Joey Hamilton. Hamil
ton had Paulsen dead to rights,
hung up between third and home,
so he charged at him . .. whirled,
tried to throw out McCarty at
first, and tossed the ball halfway
to lowa.
Anyone home? "I don't know
what I was thinking," Hamilton
said. "I looked at him and I just
froze."
Roger Burnett made it 2-1 in
the second when he tripled in Da
vid Holbrook, and then scored
when second baseman Doug
Eder's relay throw dribbled into
the Cardinal dugout.
Spencer plus a two-run lead
equals a win, right? Nope. Georgia
Southern got back to 3-2 (thanks
to an error by Tim Griffin) and
then, in the sixth, seemed to take
the lead back with a two-run
homer by catcher Rob Fitzpatrick.

Or not. The ball, which
Fitzpatrick absolutely crushed to
center, hit off one of the outfield
advertising signs and bounced
back on to the field. The rule of
thumb at Rosenblatt Stadium is
that the lower tier of signs is still
in the park, while anything hit
off the second level is a home run.
In this case, if the ball hit the
Shop-Vac sign, it was a homer;

off the AAA sign, a double.
The problem was no one saw
where the ball actually hit. The
third-base umpire, who had re
sponsibility for the play, said he
lost the ball in the white back
ground of the signs and based his
call — double, ball still in play —
partly on center fielder Jeff Ham

monds' reaction. Hammonds has
assumed the ball was still live and
thrown it back to the infield in
a hurry.
So, Jeff, where'd it hit? "I put
my head down waiting for the
bounce, and the next thing I knew
the ball was at my feet," Ham
monds said. "To tell you the truth,
I didn't see where it hit."
The call stood, and the Eagles
had men at second and third with
no outs (Todd Greene, who had
been on second, had assumed
home run and jogged toward third
before realizing what was happen
ing). Two strikeouts and a horrid
squeeze-play attempt later, the
Eagles were done in the sixth —
with zero runs to show for it.
The Eagles weren't about to
blame the umpires, even though
they were later told that replays
on ESPN apparently showed the
ball hitting the upper fence. "Um
pires are paid to umpire," Eagle
Coach Jack Stallings said. "He
was out there in good position. . . .
People in the dugout probably
have the worst vantage point of
anyone. I'm not going to question
the umpires."
Griping would do no good, be
cause the Eagles ended up blowing
the game fair and square. After
Georgia Southern scored an error
assisted run in the top of the 10th
to make it 4-3, Burnett led off
with a single. Troy Tallman tried
to bunt him to second, but hit
the ball too hard. Hamilton picked
it up, threw to second, and then
watched Burnett scamper to third
when the ball rolled into the out
field. First and third, no outs.
Hammonds lined out to right,
too shallow to score Burnett, but
Greene launched a throw home
just to make sure. Oops! Burnett
had held up, but then saw the
ball flying off into space, nowhere
near the plate. Hamilton was
backing up the play, but never
even saw the ball (Can you say
"Asleep at the wheel?"). Burnett
scored standing up, and Tallman
motored down to second.
Two pitches later, Paulsen hit

a liner to center, Tallman flew
home, and pandemonium des
cended on the Stanford bench.
"We knew we could come back,"
said Paulsen, who finished 3-for
5. "The times we've needed to
come back, we've done it. You
can't hang your heads at that
point."
The mood was just a bit differ
ent two days later, even though
the game with Georgia had all
the makings of a blowout early.
Pitcher Mike Mussina picked up
where Spencer left off, striking
out six Bulldogs in the first two
innings, and nine overall through
five, thanks to his speed-of-sound
fastball and a curve that made
the Bulldogs look foolish.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Bulldog pitcher Mike Rebhan
wasn't letting anyone (except
Carey) do anything, either: After
five innings, Stanford had only
two hits — both by Carey — but
did have a two-zip lead thanks to
Carey's 16th home run and a
stumbling, bumbling, I'll-get
there-somehow run scored by
McCarty on an error.
Both pitchers were cruising —
Rebhan at a somewhat slower
speed, but cruising nonetheless —
until the sixth, which is when
Mussina slammed into a concrete
wall.
"Early on it looked like I'd have
good stuff, but then I faded away
faster than usual," Mussina said.
"It's just one of those things. .. .
I got tired a lot earlier than I'm
used to. Even when I was out
warming up for the sixth, I knew
I didn't have it."
That's putting it mildly: Mus
sina faced seven batters in the
inning, and six of them got hits
(including catcher Terry (.178)
Childers, who finished the game
4-for-5. Go figure). By the time
he left, with men on first and
third, it was 4-2 Georgia.
Eight batters and two Stanford
pitchers later it was 11-2, as the
Bulldogs tied a CWS record for
most runs in an inning. That, plus
a just-in-case five-run rally in the
ninth, took care of the evening's
business.
"[Mussinal went through the
lineup the first two times pretty

quickly," said Georgia's Doug Rad
ziewicz, "but once we adjusted,
we were fine. He was trying to
beat us with the high fastball be
cause he's probably the hardest
thrower we've faced all year —
the easiest pitch to see is the one
that's up near your eyes. As soon
as we started laying off the high
stuff, we got a couple hits and
started rolling."
It wasn't something the players
suddenly decided to do, however.
"It was the coaches — we'd come
back in after the third, fourth and
fifth innings and they'd say 'Lay
off the high stuff, lay off the high
stuff,' " Radziewicz said. "It fi
nally got through our thick
heads."
Georgia now gets to wait until
tomorrow to face the winner of
the Stanford-MSU contest. "It
doesn't matter who we face," Rad
ziewicz said. "We've beaten them
both, and that's enough for
anybody to get mad."
Card notes
An elderly Georgia fan joked toward
the end of Sunday's massacre that
"The bottom line is, you just can't
teach educated boys to play baseball."
Said fan was immediately asked by
the Daily's ever-objective baseball
writer how many NCAA, baseball titles
Georgia has won. He was then cour
teously told what he could do with
Georgia's first championship — if they
ever win one.
An ugly rumor has it that President
George Bush will be on hand for Fri
day's games. An even uglier rumor
has him staying at the Mariott hotel,
which is where the Stanford entou
rage has been squeezing. The rumors
may explain all the guys running
around in ugly suits and cheap sun
glasses.

In case you ever need to study in
Omaha, the public library closes at
8:30 p.m. weekdays, closed on Sun
days.
The wind at Rosenblatt has
averaged about 600 mph over the first
four days of the CWS, playing hell
with fly balls and the temperature.

OMAHA, Neb. — So much for
doing things the easy way.
The Stanford baseball team's
high-wire act took a massive fall
Sunday night, getting walloped,
whomped and pounded 16-2 by
the Georgia Bulldogs. The thrash
ing, which followed a precarious,
less-than-spectacular win against
Georgia Southern on Friday,
throws Stanford into the loser's
bracket of the College World Se
ries.
One more tumble, and the Car
dinal's 1990 show is over.

Baseball

Cardinal 5, Eagles 4
Bulldogs 16, Cardinal 2

For the Cardinal to reach Sat
urday's NCAA championship
game, it must defeat Mississippi
State today at 1:07 p.m. (PST),
then beat Georgia tomorrow
night, and then beat Georgia
again on Friday. All Georgia has
to do is win one of its two games
against either the Cardinal or
MSU to get to the final.
"It won't be easy," a somber
Paul Carey said after Sunday's
fiasco. However, it has been done
before. "In '88 we lost this game
to Cal State-Fullerton, and in '87
we lost to Oklahoma State, and
we came back to win the national
title both times," Carey said. "We
just have to come together and
focus.
"I wouldn't count us out."
Neither would anyone else, but
a standing eight-count might be
in order. The Stanford bats are
in danger of slipping into a coma
— the team is batting a subter
ranean 13-for-67 (.194) so far in
the CWS — and its pitching staff,
which had cruised for a game and
a half, was pounded on for the
last four innings of Sunday's
game.
"We just got a good whipping,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "They beat us every which
way."
The weekend certainly hadn't
begun that way. Stan Spencer,
who started Friday's 5-4 10-inning
win over Georgia Southern, was
merely his same old self: nine in
nings, eight hits, 12 strikeouts
and no walks. After giving up a
quick run in the first, Spencer
mowed down nearly everyone in
the Eagle lineup. "Lately it seems
like it takes me a little while to
get going," Spencer said. "I don't
know what it is."
Whatever it is, it worked, and
it kept Stanford in the game long
enough for the Eagles to hand
them a win. Or, to be specific,

long enough for the Eagles to
throw them a win: three of the
Cardinal's runs were direct
results of throwing errors, which
were only a small part of perhaps
the most sloppily-played game
Stanford has been involved in this
year (see related story).
In the first, with Troy Paulsen
on third thanks to a monster
triple to right-center, David
McCarty hit the ball right back
to pitcher Joey Hamilton. Hamil
ton had Paulsen dead to rights,
hung up between third and home,
so he charged at him . .. whirled,
tried to throw out McCarty at
first, and tossed the ball halfway
to lowa.
Anyone home? "I don't know
what I was thinking," Hamilton
said. "I looked at him and I just
froze."
Roger Burnett made it 2-1 in
the second when he tripled in Da
vid Holbrook, and then scored
when second baseman Doug
Eder's relay throw dribbled into
the Cardinal dugout.
Spencer plus a two-run lead
equals a win, right? Nope. Georgia
Southern got back to 3-2 (thanks
to an error by Tim Griffin) and
then, in the sixth, seemed to take
the lead back with a two-run
homer by catcher Rob Fitzpatrick.

Or not. The ball, which
Fitzpatrick absolutely crushed to
center, hit off one of the outfield
advertising signs and bounced
back on to the field. The rule of
thumb at Rosenblatt Stadium is
that the lower tier of signs is still
in the park, while anything hit
off the second level is a home run.
In this case, if the ball hit the
Shop-Vac sign, it was a homer;

off the AAA sign, a double.
The problem was no one saw
where the ball actually hit. The
third-base umpire, who had re
sponsibility for the play, said he
lost the ball in the white back
ground of the signs and based his
call — double, ball still in play —
partly on center fielder Jeff Ham

monds' reaction. Hammonds has
assumed the ball was still live and
thrown it back to the infield in
a hurry.
So, Jeff, where'd it hit? "I put
my head down waiting for the
bounce, and the next thing I knew
the ball was at my feet," Ham
monds said. "To tell you the truth,
I didn't see where it hit."
The call stood, and the Eagles
had men at second and third with
no outs (Todd Greene, who had
been on second, had assumed
home run and jogged toward third
before realizing what was happen
ing). Two strikeouts and a horrid
squeeze-play attempt later, the
Eagles were done in the sixth —
with zero runs to show for it.
The Eagles weren't about to
blame the umpires, even though
they were later told that replays
on ESPN apparently showed the
ball hitting the upper fence. "Um
pires are paid to umpire," Eagle
Coach Jack Stallings said. "He
was out there in good position. . . .
People in the dugout probably
have the worst vantage point of
anyone. I'm not going to question
the umpires."
Griping would do no good, be
cause the Eagles ended up blowing
the game fair and square. After
Georgia Southern scored an error
assisted run in the top of the 10th
to make it 4-3, Burnett led off
with a single. Troy Tallman tried
to bunt him to second, but hit
the ball too hard. Hamilton picked
it up, threw to second, and then
watched Burnett scamper to third
when the ball rolled into the out
field. First and third, no outs.
Hammonds lined out to right,
too shallow to score Burnett, but
Greene launched a throw home
just to make sure. Oops! Burnett
had held up, but then saw the
ball flying off into space, nowhere
near the plate. Hamilton was
backing up the play, but never
even saw the ball (Can you say
"Asleep at the wheel?"). Burnett
scored standing up, and Tallman
motored down to second.
Two pitches later, Paulsen hit

a liner to center, Tallman flew
home, and pandemonium des
cended on the Stanford bench.
"We knew we could come back,"
said Paulsen, who finished 3-for
5. "The times we've needed to
come back, we've done it. You
can't hang your heads at that
point."
The mood was just a bit differ
ent two days later, even though
the game with Georgia had all
the makings of a blowout early.
Pitcher Mike Mussina picked up
where Spencer left off, striking
out six Bulldogs in the first two
innings, and nine overall through
five, thanks to his speed-of-sound
fastball and a curve that made
the Bulldogs look foolish.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Bulldog pitcher Mike Rebhan
wasn't letting anyone (except
Carey) do anything, either: After
five innings, Stanford had only
two hits — both by Carey — but
did have a two-zip lead thanks to
Carey's 16th home run and a
stumbling, bumbling, I'll-get
there-somehow run scored by
McCarty on an error.
Both pitchers were cruising —
Rebhan at a somewhat slower
speed, but cruising nonetheless —
until the sixth, which is when
Mussina slammed into a concrete
wall.
"Early on it looked like I'd have
good stuff, but then I faded away
faster than usual," Mussina said.
"It's just one of those things. .. .
I got tired a lot earlier than I'm
used to. Even when I was out
warming up for the sixth, I knew
I didn't have it."
That's putting it mildly: Mus
sina faced seven batters in the
inning, and six of them got hits
(including catcher Terry (.178)
Childers, who finished the game
4-for-5. Go figure). By the time
he left, with men on first and
third, it was 4-2 Georgia.
Eight batters and two Stanford
pitchers later it was 11-2, as the
Bulldogs tied a CWS record for
most runs in an inning. That, plus
a just-in-case five-run rally in the
ninth, took care of the evening's
business.
"[Mussinal went through the
lineup the first two times pretty

quickly," said Georgia's Doug Rad
ziewicz, "but once we adjusted,
we were fine. He was trying to
beat us with the high fastball be
cause he's probably the hardest
thrower we've faced all year —
the easiest pitch to see is the one
that's up near your eyes. As soon
as we started laying off the high
stuff, we got a couple hits and
started rolling."
It wasn't something the players
suddenly decided to do, however.
"It was the coaches — we'd come
back in after the third, fourth and
fifth innings and they'd say 'Lay
off the high stuff, lay off the high
stuff,' " Radziewicz said. "It fi
nally got through our thick
heads."
Georgia now gets to wait until
tomorrow to face the winner of
the Stanford-MSU contest. "It
doesn't matter who we face," Rad
ziewicz said. "We've beaten them
both, and that's enough for
anybody to get mad."
Card notes
An elderly Georgia fan joked toward
the end of Sunday's massacre that
"The bottom line is, you just can't
teach educated boys to play baseball."
Said fan was immediately asked by
the Daily's ever-objective baseball
writer how many NCAA, baseball titles
Georgia has won. He was then cour
teously told what he could do with
Georgia's first championship — if they
ever win one.
An ugly rumor has it that President
George Bush will be on hand for Fri
day's games. An even uglier rumor
has him staying at the Mariott hotel,
which is where the Stanford entou
rage has been squeezing. The rumors
may explain all the guys running
around in ugly suits and cheap sun
glasses.

In case you ever need to study in
Omaha, the public library closes at
8:30 p.m. weekdays, closed on Sun
days.
The wind at Rosenblatt has
averaged about 600 mph over the first
four days of the CWS, playing hell
with fly balls and the temperature.
