## 11-run inning shocks Card nine into loser's bracket 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — So much for
doing things the easy way.
The Stanford baseball team's
high-wire act took a massive fall
Sunday night, getting walloped,
whomped and pounded 16-2 by
the Georgia Bulldogs. The thrash
ing, which followed a precarious,
less-than-spectacular win against
Georgia Southern on Friday,
throws Stanford into the loser's
bracket of the College World Se
ries.
One more tumble, and the Car
dinal's 1990 show is over.

Cardinal 5, Eagles 4
Bulldogs 16, Cardinal 2

For the Cardinal to reach Sat
urday's NCAA championship
game, it must defeat Mississippi
State today at 1:07 p.m. (PST),
then beat Georgia tomorrow
night, and then beat Georgia
again on Friday. All Georgia has
to do is win one of its two games
against either the Cardinal or
MSU to get to the final.
"It won't be easy," a somber
Paul Carey said after Sunday's
fiasco. However, it has been done
before. "In '88 we lost this game
to Cal State-Fullerton, and in '87
we lost to Oklahoma State, and
we came back to win the national
title both times," Carey said. "We
just have to come together and
focus.
"I wouldn't count us out."
Neither would anyone else, but
a standing eight-count might be
in order. The Stanford bats are
in danger of slipping into a coma
— the team is batting a subter
ranean 13-for-67 (.194) so far in
the CWS — and its pitching staff,
which had cruised for a game and
a half, was pounded on for the
last four innings of Sunday's
game.
"We just got a good whipping,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "They beat us every which
way."
The weekend certainly hadn't
begun that way. Stan Spencer,
who started Friday's 5-4 10-inning
win over Georgia Southern, was
merely his same old self: nine in
nings, eight hits, 12 strikeouts
and no walks. After giving up a
quick run in the first, Spencer
mowed down nearly everyone in
the Eagle lineup. "Lately it seems
like it takes me a little while to
get going," Spencer said. "I don't
know what it is."
Whatever it is, it worked, and
it kept Stanford in the game long
enough for the Eagles to hand
them a win. Or, to be specific,

long enough for the Eagles to
throw them a win: three of the
Cardinal's runs were direct
results of throwing errors, which
were only a small part of perhaps
the most sloppily-played game
Stanford has been involved in this
year (see related story).
In the first, with Troy Paulsen
on third thanks to a monster
triple to right-center, David
McCarty hit the ball right back
to pitcher Joey Hamilton. Hamil
ton had Paulsen dead to rights,
hung up between third and home,
so he charged at him . .. whirled,
tried to throw out McCarty at
first, and tossed the ball halfway
to lowa.
Anyone home? "I don't know
what I was thinking," Hamilton
said. "I looked at him and I just
froze."
Roger Burnett made it 2-1 in
the second when he tripled in Da
vid Holbrook, and then scored
when second baseman Doug
Eder's relay throw dribbled into
the Cardinal dugout.
Spencer plus a two-run lead
equals a win, right? Nope. Georgia
Southern got back to 3-2 (thanks
to an error by Tim Griffin) and
then, in the sixth, seemed to take
the lead back with a two-run
homer by catcher Rob Fitzpatrick.

Or not. The ball, which
Fitzpatrick absolutely crushed to
center, hit off one of the outfield
advertising signs and bounced
back on to the field. The rule of
thumb at Rosenblatt Stadium is
that the lower tier of signs is still
in the park, while anything hit
off the second level is a home run.
In this case, if the ball hit the
Shop-Vac sign, it was a homer;

off the AAA sign, a double.
The problem was no one saw
where the ball actually hit. The
third-base umpire, who had re
sponsibility for the play, said he
lost the ball in the white back
ground of the signs and based his
call — double, ball still in play —
partly on center fielder Jeff Ham

The sight of Georgia players crossing the plate was a familiar one to Stanford catcher Troy Tallman and
the Cardinal on Sunday, as the Bulldogs tied a College World Series record for runs In one Inning.
