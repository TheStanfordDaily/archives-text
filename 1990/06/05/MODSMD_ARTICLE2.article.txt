## 
### Kim Freidberg Editorial staff 
Inspiring thundering waves of applause,
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev yes
terday praised Stanford scholars and ap
pealed to students as the new generation
of thinkers.
"The Cold War is now behind us. Let us
not wrangle over who won it," said Gor
bachev to the crowd of 1,700 students,
faculty and political dignitaries at Memorial
Auditorium.
Urging scientific cooperation in the
destruction of nuclear and chemical weap
ons, Gorbachev offered few new insights
but demonstrated his skill in charming the
audience, which repeatedly honored the So
viet leader with emotionally charged stand
ing ovations.
"In our country, we have opted for fun
damental changes," Gorbachev said, "but

I believe that all mankind is entering a
new age."
When he first walked onto the flower
adorned stage amid a burst of applause
from a crowd which had waited nearly two
hours, Gorbachev revealed a confident
smile and clasped his hands above his head.
He paused often for applause during his
speech, acknowledging the tremendous sup
port which accompanied many of his state
ments.
University President Donald Kennedy in
troduced the Soviet leader with a short
speech, heavily praising the merits of Stan
ford in front of an appreciative crowd and
the national media.
"We are an institution devoted to the
expansion of human understanding," said
Kennedy. "We are committed to making
the world better."
Gorbachev did his own share of crowd
pleasing with references to California and

specific University scholars he admired,
namely arms control experts and physicists.
"California is a special place even by
international standards," said Gorbachev,
drawing general laughter. He added he
believed California to be "the Mediter
ranean of the future" and a technological
capital.
At one point in the speech, Gorbachev
stressed the progress that California has
made in its defense policy.
"Santa Clara County [once] ranked first
in per capita military contracts," said Gor
bachev.
But, he added, California scientists were
the first to realize the importance of
demilitarization and the progress they
could make toward peace.
"The ideas and technologies of tomorrow
are born here in California," said Gorba
chev, who stressed the importance of sci
entific cooperation to work on disarmament

problems and technological solutions.
The Soviet leader named four Stanford
arms control experts — David Holloway,
Sidney Drell, William Perry and Wolfgang
Panofsky — as major contributors to in
ternational security.
Gorbachev also impressed upon the
crowd the increasing significance of the
United Nations, which was born in San
Francisco in 1945 and which he believed
would now be able to play a greater role.
In an interesting point, Gorbachev
stressed the economic efficiency of the
Pacific Rim countries, saying "new winds
are blowing in Asia" and the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. could learn lessons from such
people as the Japanese, the Koreans and
the Chinese by putting aside military
rivalries.
Although he saw the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
developing in different directions,
Gorbachev welcomed the improve
ments in superpower relations
and stressed the possibilites for
cooperation between the two na
tions.
"We need you," said former Sec
retary of State and Graduate
School of Business Prof. George
Shultz to Gorbachev in an emo
tional moment at the close of the
ceremony. Shultz and Kennedy
presented the Soviet leader with
a framed poster from the archives
of the Hoover Institution depict
ing Soviet students learning how
to read.
An inscription on the 1921 pos
ter from the great Russian poet
Alexander Pushkin reads, "Long
live the sun! May the darkness
be hidden!"
In a purely political sense, most
analysts remarked, the speech did
not signify any msgor shifts in
policy or propose anything radi
cally new.
"Part of me thought it was a
little bland," said Jack Koffman,
assistant director of the Center
for Russian and East European
studies. "But he is the first Soviet
leader in living memory who ex
presses ideas that the West can
identify with."
Rumors had spread throughout
campus last week that Gorbachev
would deliver a major foreign
policy address at Memorial Audi
torium, but Koffman dismissed
this as "wishful thinking."

Perhaps influenced by the
speculation, some students and
faculty said they were
disappointed with the political
content of the address. However,
the personal nature of the speech
impressed many.
"He didn't really say anything
new, but I thought it was nice
for him to personalize [the
speech]," said sophomore Peter
Meindl. "He said a lot of positive
things about the future."
Bob Hamrdla, an assistant to
Kennedy, commented on Gorba
chev's "presence of mind."
"He was very prepared in recog
nizing Stanford people. He talked
a little more than he should have
about Stanford. I would have liked
to hear about Germany," said
Hamrdla.
In a panel discussion after the
speech, several sovietologists gave
their views of the speech.
"It was a very gracious speech,"
said History Prof. Norman
Naimark. "He did not announce
any mgyor new policy, but it was
a very nice thing to have [Gor
bachev] directly talk to us — stu
dents, faculty and
administration."
Joked Richard Lyman, director
of the Institute for International
Studies, who was surprised by
Gorbachev's knowledge of Califor
nia issues, "He is a Soviet
politician who has learned to run
for the U.S. Senate."
"I heard lots of talk that I would
have liked to see put into action,"
said a skeptical Darrel Armstrong,
junior, but "I would not have sold
my ticket."

In a purely political sense, most
analysts remarked, the speech did
not signify any msgor shifts in
policy or propose anything radi
cally new.
"Part of me thought it was a
little bland," said Jack Koffman,
assistant director of the Center
for Russian and East European
studies. "But he is the first Soviet
leader in living memory who ex
presses ideas that the West can
identify with."
Rumors had spread throughout
campus last week that Gorbachev
would deliver a major foreign
policy address at Memorial Audi
torium, but Koffman dismissed
this as "wishful thinking."

Perhaps influenced by the
speculation, some students and
faculty said they were
disappointed with the political
content of the address. However,
the personal nature of the speech
impressed many.
"He didn't really say anything
new, but I thought it was nice
for him to personalize [the
speech]," said sophomore Peter
Meindl. "He said a lot of positive
things about the future."
Bob Hamrdla, an assistant to
Kennedy, commented on Gorba
chev's "presence of mind."
"He was very prepared in recog
nizing Stanford people. He talked
a little more than he should have
about Stanford. I would have liked
to hear about Germany," said
Hamrdla.
In a panel discussion after the
speech, several sovietologists gave
their views of the speech.
"It was a very gracious speech,"
said History Prof. Norman
Naimark. "He did not announce
any mgyor new policy, but it was
a very nice thing to have [Gor
bachev] directly talk to us — stu
dents, faculty and
administration."
Joked Richard Lyman, director
of the Institute for International
Studies, who was surprised by
Gorbachev's knowledge of Califor
nia issues, "He is a Soviet
politician who has learned to run
for the U.S. Senate."
"I heard lots of talk that I would
have liked to see put into action,"
said a skeptical Darrel Armstrong,
junior, but "I would not have sold
my ticket."
Inspiring thundering waves of applause,
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev yes
terday praised Stanford scholars and ap
pealed to students as the new generation
of thinkers.
"The Cold War is now behind us. Let us
not wrangle over who won it," said Gor
bachev to the crowd of 1,700 students,
faculty and political dignitaries at Memorial
Auditorium.
Urging scientific cooperation in the
destruction of nuclear and chemical weap
ons, Gorbachev offered few new insights
but demonstrated his skill in charming the
audience, which repeatedly honored the So
viet leader with emotionally charged stand
ing ovations.
"In our country, we have opted for fun
damental changes," Gorbachev said, "but

I believe that all mankind is entering a
new age."
When he first walked onto the flower
adorned stage amid a burst of applause
from a crowd which had waited nearly two
hours, Gorbachev revealed a confident
smile and clasped his hands above his head.
He paused often for applause during his
speech, acknowledging the tremendous sup
port which accompanied many of his state
ments.
University President Donald Kennedy in
troduced the Soviet leader with a short
speech, heavily praising the merits of Stan
ford in front of an appreciative crowd and
the national media.
"We are an institution devoted to the
expansion of human understanding," said
Kennedy. "We are committed to making
the world better."
Gorbachev did his own share of crowd
pleasing with references to California and

specific University scholars he admired,
namely arms control experts and physicists.
"California is a special place even by
international standards," said Gorbachev,
drawing general laughter. He added he
believed California to be "the Mediter
ranean of the future" and a technological
capital.
At one point in the speech, Gorbachev
stressed the progress that California has
made in its defense policy.
"Santa Clara County [once] ranked first
in per capita military contracts," said Gor
bachev.
But, he added, California scientists were
the first to realize the importance of
demilitarization and the progress they
could make toward peace.
"The ideas and technologies of tomorrow
are born here in California," said Gorba
chev, who stressed the importance of sci
entific cooperation to work on disarmament

problems and technological solutions.
The Soviet leader named four Stanford
arms control experts — David Holloway,
Sidney Drell, William Perry and Wolfgang
Panofsky — as major contributors to in
ternational security.
Gorbachev also impressed upon the
crowd the increasing significance of the
United Nations, which was born in San
Francisco in 1945 and which he believed
would now be able to play a greater role.
In an interesting point, Gorbachev
stressed the economic efficiency of the
Pacific Rim countries, saying "new winds
are blowing in Asia" and the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. could learn lessons from such
people as the Japanese, the Koreans and
the Chinese by putting aside military
rivalries.
Although he saw the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
developing in different directions,
Gorbachev welcomed the improve
ments in superpower relations
and stressed the possibilites for
cooperation between the two na
tions.
"We need you," said former Sec
retary of State and Graduate
School of Business Prof. George
Shultz to Gorbachev in an emo
tional moment at the close of the
ceremony. Shultz and Kennedy
presented the Soviet leader with
a framed poster from the archives
of the Hoover Institution depict
