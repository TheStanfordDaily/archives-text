Inspiring thundering waves of applause,
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev yes
terday praised Stanford scholars and ap
pealed to students as the new generation
of thinkers.
"The Cold War is now behind us. Let us
not wrangle over who won it," said Gor
bachev to the crowd of 1,700 students,
faculty and political dignitaries at Memorial
Auditorium.
Urging scientific cooperation in the
destruction of nuclear and chemical weap
ons, Gorbachev offered few new insights
but demonstrated his skill in charming the
audience, which repeatedly honored the So
viet leader with emotionally charged stand
ing ovations.
"In our country, we have opted for fun
damental changes," Gorbachev said, "but

I believe that all mankind is entering a
new age."
When he first walked onto the flower
adorned stage amid a burst of applause
from a crowd which had waited nearly two
hours, Gorbachev revealed a confident
smile and clasped his hands above his head.
He paused often for applause during his
speech, acknowledging the tremendous sup
port which accompanied many of his state
ments.
University President Donald Kennedy in
troduced the Soviet leader with a short
speech, heavily praising the merits of Stan
ford in front of an appreciative crowd and
the national media.
"We are an institution devoted to the
expansion of human understanding," said
Kennedy. "We are committed to making
the world better."
Gorbachev did his own share of crowd
pleasing with references to California and

specific University scholars he admired,
namely arms control experts and physicists.
"California is a special place even by
international standards," said Gorbachev,
drawing general laughter. He added he
believed California to be "the Mediter
ranean of the future" and a technological
capital.
At one point in the speech, Gorbachev
stressed the progress that California has
made in its defense policy.
"Santa Clara County [once] ranked first
in per capita military contracts," said Gor
bachev.
But, he added, California scientists were
the first to realize the importance of
demilitarization and the progress they
could make toward peace.
"The ideas and technologies of tomorrow
are born here in California," said Gorba
chev, who stressed the importance of sci
entific cooperation to work on disarmament

problems and technological solutions.
The Soviet leader named four Stanford
arms control experts — David Holloway,
Sidney Drell, William Perry and Wolfgang
Panofsky — as major contributors to in
ternational security.
Gorbachev also impressed upon the
crowd the increasing significance of the
United Nations, which was born in San
Francisco in 1945 and which he believed
would now be able to play a greater role.
In an interesting point, Gorbachev
stressed the economic efficiency of the
Pacific Rim countries, saying "new winds
are blowing in Asia" and the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. could learn lessons from such
people as the Japanese, the Koreans and
the Chinese by putting aside military
rivalries.
Although he saw the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
