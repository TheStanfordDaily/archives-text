To a casual observer, the Stan
ford track and field team didn't
appear to have a particularly good
NCAA Championships. In fact,
the men scored only one point
while the women scored two, plac
ing the Cardinal well back in the
pack.
Then again, what in the heck
does a casual observer know?
With only five athletes compet
ing, Stanford came up with
several lifetime bests and a few
more season bests as the NCAA
meet concluded Saturday at Duke
University.
"I think it was pretty good, con
sidering everything — our lack of

experience," Bill Crowley said.
"We had four Ail-Americans out
of five people who went. It was a
good showing. It wasn't a phe
nomenal showing but we all put
our effort into it."
Friday Dave Strang earned All-
America honors with an eighth
place finish in the 800 meters and
Saturday Crowley and Eric Mas
talir placed ninth and 11th,
respectively, in the 1,500.
While heptathlete Peggy Odita
was on her way to a seventh-place
finish Thursday, Strang ran a per
sonal best to qualify for the 800
meters final. Considering he
wasn't even sure he had made the
NCAA field until a week before
the meet, it was a fine perform
ance.

In the final Strang went out
hard and took the early lead but
could not hold on against the na
tion's best down the stretch. The
following day that scenario
repeated as Mastalir went out
hard in the 1,500 but didn't have
enough left at the end.
"I was in the lead with a lap
to go," he said. "I can't come from
last and win at the end.... I'm
just not ready to do that. I'm still
happy I went though. I was Ail-
American.
"I just need to get as much
experience as I can in the 5,000
and the 1,600 so I can win it next
year at NCAAs."

caught up running from the back

petition down the stretch. "I
changed my race plan, for what
ever reason," he said. "I just made
some stupid mental mistakes. . . .
He planned on staying near the

front and making his move with
500 meters to go, but it didn't
work out that way. "When I went
to make my move I was in the
back of the pack; the leaders were
already going," he said. "Then,
when I went to make my move,
I hestitated. . . . Everyone's good
there. Everyone has a good kick.
They're not going to come back
to you."
