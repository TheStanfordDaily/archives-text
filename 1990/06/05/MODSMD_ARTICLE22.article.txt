# Sloppy play mars opening win

OMAHA, Neb. - Ah, the Col
lege World Series. The best of the
best. The cream of the college
game. Baseball the way it was
meant to be played. Solid defense,
error-free execution and perfect
fundamentals.
Not quite.
Oh, so you didn't happen to
watch the opening game in the
CWS, Friday's Stanford-Georgia
Southern contest on ESPN?
You're lucky, because if ever a
game were meant to be wrapped
up and dumped in the garbage,
this was the one.
You want mistakes? This game
had it all: fielding flubs, throwing
travesties, baserunning boo-boos,
catching catastrophes, a plethora
of pickoffs, scorekeeping screwups
(Alliterators Anonymous, please
dial Omaha!), umpiring goofs, and
a sometimes-it's-right scoreboard.
By the time the whole mess was
over, the Eagles had six errors (it
should've been seven, but the of
ficial scorekeeper was in a good
mood), a bundle of mental mis
takes and a 5-4 loss. For their
part, the Cardinal had four errors
and a very bad taste in their
mouths.
"This is one of those games
where I think you just forget it
and go on," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said after the Cardinal
scored twice in the bottom of the
10th (thanks to two Eagle errors)
to take home the win.

That's good advice: Burn the
videotapes and purge your mem
ory, because the only thing a game
like this can teach anyone is that
baseball isn't always the most po
etic sport.
First, let's check out the stellar
baserunning. Three Eagle run
ners were picked ofT first base by
pitcher Stan Spencer. It should've
been four, but David McCarty al
most threw the ball away trying
to gun down the fourth.
Anything special, Stan? "Just
my normal pickoff move," Spencer
shrugged.
The pickoffs were forgivable,
but Georgia Southern's sixth
inning performance was straight
from a don't-do-this manual. Two
consecutive doubles led to zero
runs (don't ask), and then the
Eagles took themselves out of the
inning by forgetting to tell batter
Mike Yuro that they were running
a suicide squeeze.
"We made a lot of mental mis
takes," said right fielder Todd
Greene, who was tagged out at
the plate on the bungled squeeze
play. "Physical mistakes are going
to happen, but you can't have
mental mistakes."
The physical mistakes hap
pened quite often, as a matter of
fact. Stanford scored its first run
on a throwing error by pitcher
Joey Hamilton, its third on a
throw by second baseman Doug
Eder that ended up in the Cardi
nal dugout, and its fourth on â€”
