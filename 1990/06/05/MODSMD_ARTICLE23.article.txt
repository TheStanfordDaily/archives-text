# Mussina, Spencer drafted early
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — Mystery
clouded the first day of the mfyor
league draft for at least one Stan
ford baseball player last night, as
two Cardinal pitchers were
drafted early and one outfielder
was selected in the fourth round.
Maybe.
Stanford's Paul Carey spent
most of yesterday wondering
which mtyor-league team would
pick him in the draft. As of 1:00
a.m. (CST) last night Carey was
still waiting to receive a phone
call to hear the answer, but un
confirmed rumors said he was
picked early in the fourth round.
By whom? Well.. . .
It wasn't the Baltimore Orioles,
who had picked teammate Mike
Mussina in the first round with
the 20th overall pick.
And it wasn't the Montreal Ex
pos, who had tabbed Stan Spencer

in the first round of the supple
mental draft with pick No. 35.
In fact, if you were to guess 26
times, you still wouldn't be able
to guess who had supposedly
drafted Carey, because the ram
pant rumors had him picked by
.. . the Miami Miracle.
The Miracle is an independent,
non-affiliated single-A team that
plays in the Florida State League.
Players drafted by the Miracle
usually play until the beginning
of August, and can only move up
in class if a msyor-league team
decides to purchase their contract
from Miami.
Carey released a statement late
last night saying he was still clue
less as to what was going on. "At
this time I have not heard from
any professional baseball team,"
the statement said. "When I find
out who drafted me, I'll be happy
to comment on them."
Mussina and Spencer were al
ready more than happy to com
ment, however. Stanford Sports
Information Director Gary Migdol
gave Mussina the news during the
team's practice yesterday after
noon. "He told me I was the 20th
player drafted, and I knew Bal
timore had the 20th pick," said
Mussina, who was drafted by the
Orioles three years ago but turned
down a $250,000 bonus in favor
of coming to Stanford.
Mussina will most likely be
pitching for Class AA Hagerstown
(Md.) this summer. "I'd like to
start at Hagerstown," he said. "If

they sent me there I'd be pleased.
If they sent me to AAA (Rochester,
N.Y.) I'd be even more pleased."
The Expos took Spencer with
the ninth pick of the supplemental
draft, which is a compensation
round for teams that either fail
to sign a first-round pick or lose
a type-A free agent. Unlike Mus
sina, who will definitely be turn
ing pro, Spencer may return.
"I don't know whether I'll sign
or not," Spencer said. "This is
probably a good year for me to
sign, but I'll have to talk to them
and see how it turns out. I don't
want to count out my senior year
yet."
As of 1:00 a.m. Omaha time,
seniors Tim Griffin and Troy
Paulsen had yet to hear from any
team.

Stanford leaders Troy Paulsen and Paul Carey had very little to smile about after the Georgia Bulldogs destroyed the Cardinal 16-2 In
the second round of the College World Series. Carey homered early, but an 11-run outburst in the sixth inning erased a 2-0 lead and
sent the Cardinal to their first defeat in six postseason games.
