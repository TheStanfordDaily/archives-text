# Mussina, Spencer drafted early
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. â€” Mystery
clouded the first day of the mfyor
league draft for at least one Stan
ford baseball player last night, as
two Cardinal pitchers were
drafted early and one outfielder
was selected in the fourth round.
Maybe.
Stanford's Paul Carey spent
most of yesterday wondering
which mtyor-league team would
pick him in the draft. As of 1:00
a.m. (CST) last night Carey was
still waiting to receive a phone
call to hear the answer, but un
confirmed rumors said he was
picked early in the fourth round.
By whom? Well.. . .
It wasn't the Baltimore Orioles,
who had picked teammate Mike
Mussina in the first round with
the 20th overall pick.
And it wasn't the Montreal Ex
pos, who had tabbed Stan Spencer

in the first round of the supple
mental draft with pick No. 35.
In fact, if you were to guess 26
times, you still wouldn't be able
to guess who had supposedly
drafted Carey, because the ram
pant rumors had him picked by
.. . the Miami Miracle.
The Miracle is an independent,
non-affiliated single-A team that
plays in the Florida State League.
Players drafted by the Miracle
usually play until the beginning
of August, and can only move up
in class if a msyor-league team
decides to purchase their contract
from Miami.
Carey released a statement late
last night saying he was still clue
less as to what was going on. "At
this time I have not heard from
any professional baseball team,"
the statement said. "When I find
out who drafted me, I'll be happy
to comment on them."
