# Card can win across the board
## 
### 
There is a lot of talk around
this campus about Stan
ford's amazing athletic pro
gram. With people still rejoicing
the NCAA titles won by the men's
and women's tennis teams, with
the baseball team competing
(albeit not so well) at the College
World Series, and with the reali
zation that 17 national
championship trophies have come
to the Farm over the past five
years, Cardinal fans have a right
to be proud.
Although no school has won
more NCAA titles than Stanford
in any of the last four years, Stan
ford supporters should not be
satisfied.
Championships in sports like
tennis, swimming and water polo
are all fine and dandy, but to
make its mark on the national
sports scene, Stanford has to fare
better in the big two, football and
basketball.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
has said that there is little reason
to have a mediocre program and
he has done many things to pro
mote winning. But until the foot
ball team goes Bowling as often
as Lenny and Squiggy did, and
until the men's hoopsters can be
come a team that comes up in
conversations about office pools
almost every March, the average
sports fans in Muncie, Ind., will
associate Stanford with academ
ics, Soviet leaders or that city in
Connecticut.
Not that I feel that the NCAA
titles Stanford wins aren't impres
sive; on the contrary, an unbe
lievable amount of work has gone
into each and every one. They
just don't capture the public in
terest the way beating Notre
Dame in the Fiesta Bowl would.
There are a lot of reasons
people bandy about as to
why Stanford doesn't win
in the attention grabbing, revenue
sports.
For starters, people don't think
you can be good at those sports
while actually going to class and

attempting to study every now
and again. They cite places like
UNLV, Oklahoma, Missouri and
the entire Southeast Conference,
where it seems the only m£yor is
criminal justice. There, they say,
you can concentrate more on
sports because you can get B's by
going to class every month or so.
At Stanford, they say, the aca
demic load is too stringent for
students to be able to devote as
much time as those other guys
can.
The pundits are, however,
wrong. As usual.
Perhaps no sport requires as
much time, year-around, as swim
ming. National-caliber swimmers
work out 10 or 11 times a week,
three hours a time, for 45 or 50
weeks a year. Yet despite this in
tense time commitment, Stanford,
along with Texas, has dominated
collegiate swimming. So much for
that theory.
Another reason against winning
in these two sports is the fact
that Stanford has perhaps the
toughest admissions standards of
any school attempting to be a
athletic power. With many
top basketball and football players
coming from the inner-city areas
where college prep programs
aren't quite as prevalent, that can
be a problem.
The theory is that these
children of poor and less-educated
parents realize that sport is the
only way out of their situation.
Without positive academic role
models, grades can take a back
seat and many of these athletes
wind up lacking the qualifications
to attend Stanford.
The reason Stanford succeeds

in other sports is that those sports
don't have the lucrative profes
sional contracts out there in the
distance that attract these ath
letes.
Simply put, Stanford cannot
recruit enough good players to
succeed.
Once again, the theory is
wrong. Duke can usually find 12
guys smart enough to get in and
good enough to get to the Final
Four. Strong academic schools like
Notre Dame, Michigan and UCLA
have always been very good in
football.
So why can't Stanford do
that?
There isn't really a rea
son. True, the reason top basket
ball players go to Duke is because
Duke is known far and wide as a
basketball powerhouse, while
Stanford is known far and wide
as, um, as a ... (I will, at this
point, recount a conversation I
had with a cab driver in Austin,
Texas. He asked, "Where do you
go to school?" I said Stanford and
he responded, "Isn't that up
north?". So I said it was in Cal
ifornia and he was pretty darn
surprised.).
Of course, five years ago the
women's basketball and women's
soccer programs here were
stepped on by almost everyone
they competed against.
But thanks to a pair of dynamic
coaches, those programs have
gone from nowhere to national
prominence.
Not that that should be the
norm, but why not have high ex
pectations? There are way too
many alumni wandering around
going, "Six and five? That's a good
record. If we can do that every
year I'd be satisfied."
At the college level attitude gen
erally prevails over aptitude, and
there is no need for complacency.
