# Crew founders, takes seventh at nationals
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Parity reigned supreme for the
Cardinal women's crew team at
the nationals last weekend in
Madison, Wisconsin. Tornado
warnings and 70 mph winds can
celled the second qualification
round and allowed Stanford a free
ride into the finals, but that same
weather blinded the team once it
got there.
The result was a seventh place
finish out of an eight-boat final,
and possibly the boat's "worst
race of the season," according to
Coach John Davis.

"It was definitely a bad race,"
said Davis. "I can't explain it all.
It was really wild out there. We
just went stale; we had a good
start, but we just went stale."
Due to the presence of top
ranked Princeton in their opening
heat, the Cardinal knew it could
not win the automatic place in
the six-boat final, so according to
Davis, the boat "cruised" the race
in hopes of being one of the
qualifiers in the repechage, the

championship version of a losers
bracket.
The problem was that due to
the weather, the repechage was
cancelled, creating an all-inclusive
eight boat final. Stanford had
made it into the final but, once
there, its strategy was thrown off.
"Our whole weekend was based
on two races on Saturday, and
that was taken away," Davis said.
Mother Nature took away more
than just the team's race plans;
it also took away its sight. Because
a crew rows backwards, the
coxswain is used to steer and
coach the boat through the race.
But because of the poor weather,
it was very dark during the cham
pionship race and Stanford
coxswain Quentin Story could not
see very well.
"Some people have more trou
ble seeing in the dark than others,
and Quentin is one of those
people," Davis said. "The cox is
the eyes and ears of the crew.
When the coxswain is blinded, the
boat loses that info of the race."
With her vision limited to the
length of the boat, Story was un
able to accurately guide the Car
dinal through the course.
Stanford stayed in contention
through the first 500 meters, but
then fell back, finally finishing
seventh.
