You are in the San Francisco airport.
You receive a cardboard box and instruc
tions not to open it.
You know the package has a message
for you, but you don't know what it is or
how to find out.
Mission impossible? Not for competitors
in the Bay Area Race Fantastique (BARF)
— a marathon race based on problem
solving that can take participants from Gil
roy to Oakland and from Pinnacles
National Monument (south of Monterey)
to Union Square in San Francisco.
The game, created four years ago in
Madera House by Joe Belfiore, now a
senior, tests the mental dexterity, physical
endurance and team unity of a group of
teams racing to the finish line.
Belfiore and seniors Eli Ben-Shoshan,
Tom Harding, Steve Nagy and David
Rubinstein spent more than three-and-a
half months and thousands of dollars —
financed by entry fees, $15 per team mem
ber — preparing this, the sixth game.
Ten teams, a total of 77 participants,
began at 3:15 p.m. on Memorial Day and
ended in the late afternoon the next day.
The winning team solved 15 clues, com
pleting the task in about 21 hours.
At each stop, a team receives a clue in
its designated team color.
Teams figure out the next destination
by solving the riddle presented in the clue.
One clue in this race was a tape with a
message taped backward. The clue was de

signed so teams would go to a radio station,
tape the message onto a reel-to-reel tape
and manually roll the tape backward to
get the correct message.
But that's not all.
The tape sent the teams to a "beacon of
light" in the Stanford Foothills. The light
was concentrated in an old, beat-up shack
off the path to the Dish.
In the house, a member of the team
tossed flour in the air to reveal a laser
beam inscribing the next clue on a wall.
Clues can take up to three hours to
complete.
"There's something really valuable about
putting people in a state of duress, and
they have to reach far inside themselves
to get the physical endurance or knowledge
needed to do something they thought they
couldn't do," said Belfiore.
Teams having trouble with a clue can
call Game Control, the game's creators,
who may or may not give them a hint.
One clue on an island was contained in
a box sealed by a combination lock. To get
to the island, team members had to swim
across the water.
Once there, a pig was supposed to be
running around the island with the lock's
combination written on its side. By cap
turing the pig, a team could read the com
bination and open the box for the next clue.
Unfortunately, the pig swam off the is
land before teams arrived.
Why do Stanford students subject them
selves to this struggle when there is no
prize for victory except pride? "Entertain
ment," says Nagy.
