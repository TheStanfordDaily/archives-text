# Hundreds protest Baltic situation
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Besides the crowds of cheering Stanford students
yesterday, members of the Baltic Alliance, Eritreans,
Vietnamese, Jews, Armenians and others gathered
to remind Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that
he wasn't everybody's hero.
Showing their support for the independence move
ments in the "Baltic states" — Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania — hundreds of protesters lined Palm
Drive.
"The Lithuanians are not against the Soviet
Union and not against Gorbachev as the leader of
the Soviet Union, but they don't view themselves
as being under Soviet rule," Aldona Sehgal, a Lith
uanian who came to the United States in 1948,
explained.
Members of the Baltic Alliance — including two
busloads of Lithuanians from Los Angeles — began
assembling at 7 a.m., waving Estonian, Latvian and
Lithuanian flags and holding banners that read:
"Gorbi: Darling in U.S. but Bully in Baltics" and
"U.S.S.R. Hands Off the Baits." A commercial bi
plane also circled above the Quad trailing a sign
that read: "Gorby — Free the Baltic States."

Protesters at Stanford yesterday included several supporters of the Erltrean People's Liberation Front,
who urged the Soviet president to halt arms shipments to Ethiopian leader Halle Mariam Mengistu.
The Stanford demonstration
was the largest of seven held by
the alliance during the Soviet
president's short visit to the Bay
Area. The first demonstration
was a candlelight vigil Sunday
night and the last took place yes
terday at the Fairmont Hotel in
San Francisco.
The Soviet Union annexed Es
tonia, Latvia and Lithuania in
1940, but now the three Baltic
states are seeking independence.
Lithuania's declaration of inde
pendence on March 11 has been
a particularly troublesome thorn
in Gorbachev's side.
The Soviet leader has imposed
an economic blockade on Lithu
ania and has called in troops to
dampen nationalist spirit and to
keep Lithuania from joining the
East European flock of newly in
dependent nations.
Lithuanian independence has
been a key issue for Gorbachev's
strongest political rival, Boris
Yeltsin. Yeltsin, who was recently
elected president of the Russian

republic, supports a free Lithuan
ia.
Protesters from the Baltic
states were not the only ones
seeking the right to self
determination and freedom from
Soviet domination. Another thou
sand protesters lined the Oval and
called for the Soviet Union to re
spect Eritrea's right to self
determination by ending arms
shipments to Ethiopia.
Supporters of the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front, waving
blue and green Eritrean flags and
chanting "Stop Burning our
Children, Stop Killing our
People," called out to Gorbachev,
urging him to stop Soviet arms
shipments, which they say have
contributed to a massacre in
Eritrea. According to the Eritrean
protesters, the Soviet Union has
supplied Marxist Ethiopian leader
Haile Mariam Mengistu with $11
billion in arms since 1977.
"We are protesting against Gor
bachev's genocide of the Eritrean
people," Tewelde Stefanos, an
Eritrean who has lived in Sunny
vale for 15 years, said. "He ap
pears as a peaceful ruler, known
to the world, but in Eritrea things

have not changed. Soviet bombs
are still killing innocent children
and civilians."
Jewish students on campus had
their own message for Gorbachev.
Jocelyn Reisman, interim director
of Hillel, posted a 10-by-10 foot
banner that said in Russian, "In
perestroika there is no room for
anti-Semitism." When Gorbachev
stepped out of his limousine, Reis
man jumped in front of the police
barrier to catch the Soviet presi
dent's attention.
"It was amazing watching his
face look at it," she said. "The
whole idea was to get the message
to him, and we did."
Rich Frankel, a business stu
dent, carried a similar poster in
English inside the Quad. Also in
side the Quad, some people waved
Eritrean and Lithuanian flags.
One student carried a sign saying,
"China needs a Gorby."
Outside the Quad along Palm
Drive, another group of demon
strators seemed to agree that Gor
bachev could have a positive effect
in the Far East. About 100 people
from the Coalition of Nationalist
Vietnamese Organizations of
Northern California called on

Many of the protest
ers said they had
relatives who were
killed.

Gorbachev to use his influence to
encourage peace and freedom in
Vietnam.
"We are not protesting any
thing," Tri Nguyen, a second-year
Stanford medical student, ex
plained. "We hope Mr. Gorbachev
will help us do what he's trying
to do in his own country. If there
is glasnost and perestroika in the
Soviet Union, why not in Viet
nam? If Mr. Gorbachev wants de
mocracy, what does he think
about what the Soviets are sup
porting?"
A smaller group of about 50
people organized in conjunction
with the Stanford Armenian Stu
dents Association also lined up
along Palm Drive shouting
"Reunify Armenia" and carrying
signs, banners and flagß.
Junior Aram Hajian criticized
Gorbachev for condoning human
rights violations in Armenia. "If
democracy is going to succeed in

the Soviet Union, then Gorbachev
has to acknowledge the difference
between a pro -glasnost movement
and a racist pogrom."
Armenian demonstrator
Manassel Oskian said soldiers
shot 20 people he knew a block
away from his house last week.
Oskian, who arrived at 4 a.m.
from Los Angeles to protest, said
Gorbachev is "going to be remem
bered as another Hitler. He's still
a Communist."
After Gorbachev entered the
Quad, the Eritrean protesters
moved around and assembled in
front of Memorial Auditorium,
chanting loudly in a large group,
trying to convey the urgency of
their cause.
Set up as an independent fed
eration in 1950, Eritrea was ille
gally annexed by Ethiopia in 1962,
and Eritreans have been strug
gling for independence ever since.
Many of the protesters said they
had relatives who were killed in
the Eritrean conflict. One woman,
Tsighe Nemariam, described the
situation in Eritrea as a
"holocaust" and called Gorbachev
"a 20th century Hitler."
Many Eritreans, who were the

most vocal protesters during Gor
bachev's visit, were disappointed
with Stanford students. "If the
students really believed in democ
racy, they would not have invited
(Gorbachev) here," Idirs
Mohammed said.
Despite the efforts of the pro
testers, their message went
largely unnoticed by the crowd
assembled outside Memorial Au
ditorium to watch Gorbachev
leave.
"Most people don't care," said
Frans Alkemade, an engineer at
Stanford's Hensel Laboratories.
Alkemade said the protest was
"overdone a bit" and added "at
some point, (police officers)
should tell the protesters to
leave."
"Most people have never heard
of Eritrea before," according to
senior David Leal, who stood out
side the auditorium. Leal said the
protest was "a good thing" be
cause it would demonstrate to
Gorbachev "a side-effect of
democracy."

Yeltsin. Yeltsin, who was recently
elected president of the Russian

republic, supports a free Lithuan
ia.
Protesters from the Baltic
states were not the only ones
seeking the right to self
determination and freedom from
Soviet domination. Another thou
sand protesters lined the Oval and
called for the Soviet Union to re
spect Eritrea's right to self
determination by ending arms
shipments to Ethiopia.
Supporters of the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front, waving
blue and green Eritrean flags and
chanting "Stop Burning our
Children, Stop Killing our
People," called out to Gorbachev,
urging him to stop Soviet arms
shipments, which they say have
contributed to a massacre in
Eritrea. According to the Eritrean
protesters, the Soviet Union has
supplied Marxist Ethiopian leader
Haile Mariam Mengistu with $11
billion in arms since 1977.
"We are protesting against Gor
bachev's genocide of the Eritrean
people," Tewelde Stefanos, an
Eritrean who has lived in Sunny
vale for 15 years, said. "He ap
pears as a peaceful ruler, known
to the world, but in Eritrea things

have not changed. Soviet bombs
are still killing innocent children
and civilians."
Jewish students on campus had
their own message for Gorbachev.
Jocelyn Reisman, interim director
of Hillel, posted a 10-by-10 foot
banner that said in Russian, "In
perestroika there is no room for
anti-Semitism." When Gorbachev
stepped out of his limousine, Reis
man jumped in front of the police
barrier to catch the Soviet presi
dent's attention.
"It was amazing watching his
face look at it," she said. "The
whole idea was to get the message
to him, and we did."
Rich Frankel, a business stu
dent, carried a similar poster in
English inside the Quad. Also in
side the Quad, some people waved
Eritrean and Lithuanian flags.
One student carried a sign saying,
"China needs a Gorby."
Outside the Quad along Palm
Drive, another group of demon
strators seemed to agree that Gor
bachev could have a positive effect
in the Far East. About 100 people
from the Coalition of Nationalist
Vietnamese Organizations of
Northern California called on

Many of the protest
ers said they had
relatives who were
killed.

Gorbachev to use his influence to
encourage peace and freedom in
Vietnam.
"We are not protesting any
thing," Tri Nguyen, a second-year
Stanford medical student, ex
plained. "We hope Mr. Gorbachev
will help us do what he's trying
to do in his own country. If there
is glasnost and perestroika in the
Soviet Union, why not in Viet
nam? If Mr. Gorbachev wants de
mocracy, what does he think
about what the Soviets are sup
porting?"
A smaller group of about 50
people organized in conjunction
with the Stanford Armenian Stu
dents Association also lined up
along Palm Drive shouting
"Reunify Armenia" and carrying
signs, banners and flagß.
Junior Aram Hajian criticized
Gorbachev for condoning human
rights violations in Armenia. "If
democracy is going to succeed in

the Soviet Union, then Gorbachev
has to acknowledge the difference
between a pro -glasnost movement
and a racist pogrom."
Armenian demonstrator
Manassel Oskian said soldiers
shot 20 people he knew a block
away from his house last week.
Oskian, who arrived at 4 a.m.
from Los Angeles to protest, said
Gorbachev is "going to be remem
bered as another Hitler. He's still
a Communist."
After Gorbachev entered the
Quad, the Eritrean protesters
moved around and assembled in
front of Memorial Auditorium,
chanting loudly in a large group,
trying to convey the urgency of
their cause.
Set up as an independent fed
eration in 1950, Eritrea was ille
gally annexed by Ethiopia in 1962,
and Eritreans have been strug
gling for independence ever since.
Many of the protesters said they
had relatives who were killed in
the Eritrean conflict. One woman,
Tsighe Nemariam, described the
situation in Eritrea as a
"holocaust" and called Gorbachev
"a 20th century Hitler."
Many Eritreans, who were the

most vocal protesters during Gor
bachev's visit, were disappointed
with Stanford students. "If the
students really believed in democ
racy, they would not have invited
(Gorbachev) here," Idirs
Mohammed said.
Despite the efforts of the pro
testers, their message went
largely unnoticed by the crowd
assembled outside Memorial Au
ditorium to watch Gorbachev
leave.
"Most people don't care," said
Frans Alkemade, an engineer at
Stanford's Hensel Laboratories.
Alkemade said the protest was
"overdone a bit" and added "at
some point, (police officers)
should tell the protesters to
leave."
"Most people have never heard
of Eritrea before," according to
senior David Leal, who stood out
side the auditorium. Leal said the
protest was "a good thing" be
cause it would demonstrate to
Gorbachev "a side-effect of
democracy."

Besides the crowds of cheering Stanford students
yesterday, members of the Baltic Alliance, Eritreans,
Vietnamese, Jews, Armenians and others gathered
to remind Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that
he wasn't everybody's hero.
Showing their support for the independence move
ments in the "Baltic states" — Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania — hundreds of protesters lined Palm
Drive.
"The Lithuanians are not against the Soviet
Union and not against Gorbachev as the leader of
the Soviet Union, but they don't view themselves
as being under Soviet rule," Aldona Sehgal, a Lith
uanian who came to the United States in 1948,
explained.
Members of the Baltic Alliance — including two
busloads of Lithuanians from Los Angeles — began
assembling at 7 a.m., waving Estonian, Latvian and
Lithuanian flags and holding banners that read:
"Gorbi: Darling in U.S. but Bully in Baltics" and
"U.S.S.R. Hands Off the Baits." A commercial bi
plane also circled above the Quad trailing a sign
that read: "Gorby — Free the Baltic States."

Protesters at Stanford yesterday included several supporters of the Erltrean People's Liberation Front,
who urged the Soviet president to halt arms shipments to Ethiopian leader Halle Mariam Mengistu.
The Stanford demonstration
was the largest of seven held by
the alliance during the Soviet
president's short visit to the Bay
Area. The first demonstration
was a candlelight vigil Sunday
night and the last took place yes
terday at the Fairmont Hotel in
San Francisco.
The Soviet Union annexed Es
tonia, Latvia and Lithuania in
1940, but now the three Baltic
states are seeking independence.
Lithuania's declaration of inde
pendence on March 11 has been
a particularly troublesome thorn
in Gorbachev's side.
The Soviet leader has imposed
an economic blockade on Lithu
ania and has called in troops to
dampen nationalist spirit and to
keep Lithuania from joining the
East European flock of newly in
dependent nations.
Lithuanian independence has
been a key issue for Gorbachev's
strongest political rival, Boris
Yeltsin. Yeltsin, who was recently
