# Hundreds protest Baltic situation
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Besides the crowds of cheering Stanford students
yesterday, members of the Baltic Alliance, Eritreans,
Vietnamese, Jews, Armenians and others gathered
to remind Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that
he wasn't everybody's hero.
Showing their support for the independence move
ments in the "Baltic states" — Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania — hundreds of protesters lined Palm
Drive.
"The Lithuanians are not against the Soviet
Union and not against Gorbachev as the leader of
the Soviet Union, but they don't view themselves
as being under Soviet rule," Aldona Sehgal, a Lith
uanian who came to the United States in 1948,
explained.
Members of the Baltic Alliance — including two
busloads of Lithuanians from Los Angeles — began
assembling at 7 a.m., waving Estonian, Latvian and
Lithuanian flags and holding banners that read:
"Gorbi: Darling in U.S. but Bully in Baltics" and
"U.S.S.R. Hands Off the Baits." A commercial bi
plane also circled above the Quad trailing a sign
that read: "Gorby — Free the Baltic States."
