With all the attention surrounding
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
visit to Stanford, the California pri
mary election has garnered little stu
dent attention over the past few days.
Today, California voters will decide
the Democratic and Republican guber
natorial candidates. They will also
vote on 17 propositions and several
close races for state offices. Polls open
at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.
In the Democratic gubernatorial
race, former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein leads in the polls by
approximately 10 percent over state
Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
Republicans are expected to choose
State Sen. Pete Wilson, who visited
campus yesterday to see Gorbachev.
By drawing heavily on women
voters, who form 57 percent of the
primary electorate, Feinstein hopes to
become California's first woman
governor. She takes a strong pro
choice stand and has said that as
governor, half her appointments
would go to women.
Van de Kamp is pro-choice but per
sonally opposed to abortion. He points
to the high number of women in his
campaign and office staffs as a sign
of his commitment to women constit
uents.

By drawing heavily on women voters,
Feinstein hopes to become California's first
woman governor.

Generally, Feinstein is considered
more conservative, campaigning hard
for such issues as the death penalty.
Van de Kamp is seen as the better
environmentalist, having co-authored
a successful November initiative com
monly known as "Big Green."
The 17 propositions on the ballot
run the gamut from the controversial
to the mundane.
For example, Proposition 115,
which would expand the definition of
first-degree murder and increase
penalties for some murders, has come
under fire from pro-choice activists.
They oppose the amendment be
cause it could jeopardize a woman's
right to an abortion in the state by
eliminating the right to privacy, which
is guaranteed under the California
Constitution but not the U.S. Consti
tution. Proponents of the amendment
argue it is meant to apply strictly to
criminal trials and will not infringe
upon abortion rights.
Propositions 118 and 119 would
change the procedure for drawing

voting district lines, which is currently
done by the state legislature every 10
years based on census results. Along
with Proposition 112, Proposition 118
also attempts to address congressional
ethics and corruption.
With propositions 114 and 117,
voters will have the opportunity to
decide on protection for mountain
lions and on peace officers.
Seven of the propositions, if passed,
would require the state to sell $5.14
billion in government bonds.
Funding would be allocated for
building new schools and prisons,
repairing earthquake-damaged
government buildings and construct
ing homeless shelters.
Propositions 108, 111 and 116
would require the sale of bonds to
address transportation issues such as
pollution, traffic congestion and rail
ways.
Other propositions include regula
tion of chiropractors, tax exemptions
for the physically disabled and exten
sion of deadlines for the governor.
