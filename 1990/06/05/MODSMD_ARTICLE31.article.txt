# MEETING MR. GORBACHEV
## Thousands come out to see the Soviet president 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Thousands swarmed the Quad and the area
outside Littlefield Center yesterday, hoping
to catch a glimpse of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev — and maybe even "press the
flesh." And Gorbachev didn't disappoint
many of those who waited hours to meet him.
Students and staff began lining up behind
Memorial Church at 5:30 a.m., bringing breakfast,
books and newspapers.
"Being that we are competitive Stanford students,
we wanted to be first," said junior Steve Quake,
who was second in line behind freshman Heather
Weaver.
A contingent of seven freshmen from Branner
Hall, who arrived before 6:30 a.m., sat in line eating
Captain Crunch cereal and bagels from Food Service.
At the two entrances, nobody quite knew where
the line for one ended and the other began. "No
one has any idea what's going on," said freshman
Shari Levine.
At 8:23 a.m., after three uniformed Secret Service
agents walked past the line, the crowd stood up
and surged toward the police barrier tape. People
pushed toward the front, and those who got there
early in the morning lost their places in line.
But spirits were high, as crowd members joked
about the Secret Service agents and cheered when
a group of 25 members of the tactical team of the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department walked
behind Memorial Church. The men sported mous
taches and sunglasses, as well as green and blue
plaid berets with red pom-poms.
Just before 10 a.m., the crowd began to surge
past the police tape before Secret Service agents
could tear it down. When police officers yelled at
people to slow down, the crowd's pace only seemed
to pick up.
While Secret Service officials tried to check for
identification, few paused long enough to show even
their red Quad pass.
Almost ignoring the metal detectors, people of all
ages raced into the Quad to get the best view of
the path marked for Gorbachev's walk to Memorial
Church. Some climbed on walls and hung from
classroom windows, while others trampled the
planted trees and bushes in the islands around the
Quad.
At 10:05 a.m., University President Donald Ken
nedy came out to the middle of the Quad and was
greeted by shouts and cheers from the throngs of
people pressed up against the metal police barriers
waiting for another president to show.
Kennedy waved to the crowd and warned everyone
to "Be nice," then walked away to his spot at the
front of the Quad to wait for Gorbachev.
As time passed, the anxious onlookers, packed 15
to 20 deep behind the two rows of barricades,

a
amused themselves any way they could. One group
of students started a wave, while others began the
"Tastes great — Less filling" beer commercial chant
with the crowd opposite them.
People decorated the metal barricades with signs
in Russian reading, "We love Gorbachev," "Wel
come" and "Stanford Loves You, Gorbachev."
Students who scaled trees behind the barricades
to get a better view of the Soviet entourage were
quickly discovered and ordered down by the Secret
Service.
Across the way, on the left side of Memorial
Church, a group of schoolchildren with flowers and
gifts for Gorbachev gathered at the front of the
barrier, singing quintessential American songs such
as "This Land Is Your Land" and chanting "We
want Gorby! We want Gorby!" The children were
supposed to be at the Littlefield Center to greet
Gorbachev, but they were mistakenly rerouted to
the Quad by Secret Service agents.
As the time of Gorbachev's expected arrival
neared, the crowd was ready to cheer at just about
anyone who came through the arches from Memorial
Court. Slightly before 11 a.m., two police officers
on motorcycles roared up the ramps and into the
Quad, greeted by screaming Gorbachev admirers.
Just after noon, Gorbachev arrived in a convoy
of police cars, limousines and several large
Suburban-type trucks. After meeting the Kennedys
and the Shultzes, as well as other members of the
welcoming committee, Gorbachev headed straight
for the cheering crowd.
More than 20 Secret Service agents in dark suits
surrounded a much shorter Gorbachev, and most
of the crowd strained to catch a glimpse of the top
of his head. One woman yelled, "There he is."
Another responded, "No, they have hair," and her
friend responded, "But one guy doesn't have hair."
As Gorbachev headed toward the crowd to shake
hands with his admirers, the crowd strained to
touch him. The unattached metal barriers rocked
with the pressure, and people in the front row
found themselves fighting to keep the fences from
falling over, said sophomores Caroline Adair and
Bemie Isuani.
Junior Marci Andrews said, "By the time he came
over, there were crowds pushing us. I almost fell
into Gorbachev's chest, but I didn't, thank good
ness."
The rest yelled "Down in front" and pushed their
way forward. "Why don't they let everyone 65 inches
and under go to the front?" asked freshman Kim
Stephenson.
"Everyone was pushing and shoving, so even
though 1 was only two feet away from him, I didn't
even see his face," said freshman Andy Goldberg.
A student gave the Soviet president a Stanford
baseball cap, and he waved it in the air.
