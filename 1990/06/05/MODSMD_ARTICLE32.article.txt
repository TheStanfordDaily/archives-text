With the arrival of Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev, a tight
security network took the secret
out of the Secret Service. A swarm
of agents in blue blazers provided
a highly visible deterrent to any
wrongdoing.
Many of the agents were
grouped together in pairs. Dressed
in long-sleeved white shirts, and
black pants with a gold stripe up
the side and carrying Smith &
Wesson .38 special service revol
vers, uniformed U.S. Secret Serv
ice agents were stationed at all
entrance sites.
The plainclothes Secret Service
agents wore earpieces and microp
hones on the inside of their suit
sleeves. Stealing a scene out of
the upcoming movie "Dick Tracy,"
many agents could be seen talking
into their wrists and sporting
designer sunglasses — Ray Bans
appeared to the brand of choice.
In addition, all of the
plainclothes agents wore small
lapel pins designating their func

tion and agency.
When questioned about the spe
cific meaning of the pins, one Se
cret Service agent tersely
responded, "You're asking me to
give up our security system."
On the left lapel of his grey
suit he wore a rectangular black
and gold pin with the Secret Serv
ice badge engraved in the gold
portion. A small pin in the shape
of Texas with the Secret Service
badge engraved in the center was
affixed to his right lapel.
Beginning Sunday evening, the
Secret Service, along with other
agencies, enacted several security
measures. The middle of the Quad
was closed off with metal crowd
control fences; police tape was
strung around the perimeter of
the Quad, and several blue uni
formed Stanford Events Services
personnel patrolled the area. Sun
day night's Flick, "Always," was
canceled for security purposes.
People who left their bikes be
hind History Corner were proba
bly surprised to find both their
bikes and the entire bike rack
missing from the area.

Fortunately, signs posted on the
arches of the Quad informed stu
dents that all bikes and bike racks
had been taken to the Stanford
Police station as a precaution.
Early yesterday morning, the
area from the parking lot of
Memorial Auditorium to the west
side of the Quad was sealed off
from all unauthorized personnel.
Metal detectors were installed on
both sides of Memorial Church,
at the Serra Street entrance of
Memorial Auditorium, and at Lit
tlefield Center.
Look-alikes of Mr. and Mrs.
Gorbachev appeared with several
Secret Service agents at 8:10 a.m.
from the Lou Henry Hoover
Building and walked to the side
of Memorial Auditorium.
At 8:25 a.m., the technical crew
and photographers were cleared
through the Memorial Audito
rium entrance. Each of the Secret
Service agents shot at least one
frame in every camera to ensure
they were as they appeared. Su

While many Secret Service agents sported the conventional blue-blazer look, others wore very visible
uniforms. The deterrent was apparently effective as no incidents were reported.
were plainclothes Secret Service
agents.
Officers of the California High
way Patrol cordoned off Palm
Drive and the area around the
Oval. The police lines along the
Oval prevented spectators from
standing on the peripheral side
walk. Consequently, the fairly
heavy crowd was forced to stand
in the bushes, trampling them
down.
About five minutes prior to the
arrival of the motorcade, a pho
tographer from Stanford Police
Services took photos of the crowd,
which included numerous protest
ers.
Helicopters were constantly
flying overhead, and their fre
quency picked up as the Soviet
president's time of arrival neared.
Gorbachev's motorcade traveled
down Interstate 280, exited at
Page Mill Road, and sped along
Campus Drive before turning
down Palm Drive at about 11:50
a.m. Between 40 and 50 vehicles
comprised the motorcade, making
it twice the size of a regular pres
idential motorcade.
As Gorbachev's motorcade
traveled around the Oval, four

Zils, a type of Soviet limousine,
were clustered together. Blacked
out Chevrolet Suburbans carried
Secret Service agents to the front,
rear and sides of the limos.
Immediately upon stopping at
the entrance to the Quad, dozens
of security personnel swarmed out
of their vehicles and around Gor
bachev's limousine and the sub
sequent entourage.
Along with the California High
way Patrol and the Stanford
Police, more than two dozen of
ficers from the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department
crowd control unit watched over
the spectators. The deputies as
sociated with the unit wore dis
tinctive green and plaid berets
with red balls on top.
According to one deputy, the
berets were adopted in the 1960s
when the unit was formed. Pro
viding additional backup were
several Santa Clara deputy
sheriffs on horseback.
There were also police officers
present from the Los Altos, San
Jose, Campbell, Palo Alto and
Morgan Hill.
