# A 						veritable 'Who's Who'
## Pols, celebs flock to see Soviet leader 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
With his gregarious personality and in
ternational renown, Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev soaked up more media
attention than sunshine during his visit
yesterday.
So much that several influential U.S.
and Soviet dignitaries were forced into the
shadows.
The Soviet delegation included three
members of Gorbachev's recently created
presidential council, as well as the newly
appointed ambassador to the United States.
Two members of the Bush administra
tion who are Stanford faculty also attended
yesterday's events.
Graduate School of Business Prof, and
former Secretary of State George Shultz
and his wife, O'Bie, accompanied Gorba
chev and his entourage along with Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and his wife
Robin.
California Gov. George Deukmejian and
California senators Alan Cranston and Pete
Wilson were also part of the welcoming
committee.
One KRON-TV commentator speculated
that both Cranston and Wilson are "hoping
some of Gorbachev's popularity will rub
off" on them.
But not all of the public figures who
attended were important political officials.
Actress Morgan Fairchild watched the So
viet leader stroll through the crowded
Quad.
Stanislav Sergeevich Shatalin, one of the
three members of the presidential council
in Gorbachev's entourage, is one of the
Soviet Union's leading economists.
Shatalin, the head of the economic sec

tion of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
holds the title of academician, the highest
possible for a Soviet scholar.
According to Economics Assoc. Prof.
John Litwack, Shatalin's economic views
are slightly "to the left" of Gorbachev's
since he advocates a more radical shift
toward a market economy.
Because of his attitudes, he was
"silenced" under former Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev, Litwak said. However,
Shatalin has now become more prominent
and is "one of the three economists that
Gorbachev talks to most often," he added.
Economics Prof. John Shoven met with
Shatalin and several other Stanford offi
cials for about 35 minutes. Shatalin showed
great interest in developing a relationship
between scholars in the United States and
the Soviet Union, he said.
Yuri Andreevich Osypian is a vice pres
ident of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
and head of the Research Institute of Solid
Body Physics. He is the first scientist ap
pointed to the presidential council, accord
ing to Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter.
Osypian has visited Stanford several
times in the past four years, Fetter said.
In a five-minute meeting with a group
of physics professors, Osypian said he was
very interested in "building bridges" with
researchers in the United States.
Also present at the speech yesterday was
Y.M. Primakov, a former Soviet journalist
who later became the head of a foreign
relations institute.
Before being named ambassador to the
United States last month, Aleksandr Be
ssmertnykh, also a member of the delega
tion, was a high-ranking official in the
Soviet foreign ministry.
