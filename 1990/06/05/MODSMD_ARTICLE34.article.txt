### Kaarin Michaelsen 
While thousands thronging the
Quad considered themselves for
tunate if they got a glimpse of
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev yesterday, a group of 37 dis
tinguished faculty members,
scholars and students had the rare
opportunity to attend a private
conversation with the Soviet
leader at Littlefield Center.
After Richard Lyman, president
emeritus of Stanford, welcomed
Gorbachev, former Secretary of
State George Shultz ran the 30-
minute discussion.
Five scholars, four scientists
and one economist explained their
research to the Soviet president
and discussed the importance of
international cooperation and
technological exchange between
the two nations.
The group was selected by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
based on the recommendations of
faculty members and included five
Nobel laureates, professors from
various schools and disciplines
and a total of 10 graduate and
undergraduate students.
"The criteria for selection
shifted as we went through the
process, but we were mainly in
terested in getting individuals
from a variety of fields so that
we could best represent the di
verse intellectual horsepower that
we have here," Lyman said after
the meeting. "We were looking for
people who would help to make
an interesting conversation if that
was what [Gorbachev] wanted."
"I tried to select students that
I thought would best show Pres
ident Gorbachev the kind of spar
kling, diverse, intellectual student
body that we are lucky enough to
have here," said Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Ewart Thomas,
who was also involved in the se
lection process.
Shultz selected Biochemistry

Prof. Paul Berg, Civil Engineering
Prof. Haresh Shah, Developmen
tal Biology Prof. Lucy Shapiro,
Physics Prof. Arthur Schawlow
and Milton Friedman, a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution to
describe their work to Gorbachev,
who then responded to each of
them.
"I spoke to Gorbachev about
how genetics and our understand
ing of the sequencing of human
genomes will impinge in a key
way on the future of medicine
worldwide," said Shapiro, who
studies molecular genetics.
Genomes are the genetic makeup
of the human body.
She went on to say that Gor
bachev "agreed with me that

cooperation between our two
countries is crucial in this field.
Only by working together and
sharing our ideas can we have a
lasting impact on society," said
Shapiro.
Schawlow, who works with
laser technology, told Gorbachev
that in the United States, the
laser industry has developed
quickly because of the monetary
incentive for invention, according
to Schawlow.
Shah, who spoke about his re
search on earthquakes and other
seismic activity, said, "I was very
impressed with the amount of
knowledge that he has about spe
cific research going on in his
country. He was able to cite a

Soviet comparison for every ex
ample relating to my research that
I gave.
"I was also extremely impressed
with the fact that he could so
clearly identify the main problem
facing the Soviet Union in the
technological sphere: how to im
plement the knowledge that it has
to best benefit society," Shah said.
Due to time constraints, only
five professors were given the op
portunity to speak personally to
Gorbachev. Goodwin Liu, a junior
in biological sciences, was disap
pointed that no students were able
to speak. "It's almost too bad.. ..
It was such an opportunity for
