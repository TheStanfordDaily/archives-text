# Student describes chat that almost wasn't

### Susan McKean Special to The Daily 
In the end, we were simply
glad to see him.
We had heard reports all
morning speculating, then con
firming, then denying reports
that Gorbachev was late, was
heading directly to Memorial
Auditorium from the Quad or
would miss his meeting with
us in Littlefield Center entirely.
For several hours, those of
us who were supposed to get
closest to him were most distant
from the action. We waited,
milling around the Wattis
Room with the shades down,
discussing our work and re
search, tinkering with the si
multaneous translation
devices, eavesdropping on the
walkie-talkie conversations
and resigning ourselves to
snatching a glimpse of Mikhail
Sergeevich Gorbachev.
When at last he did arrive,
with very little ceremony and
a certain all-encompassing
stare, he quite abruptly ac
knowledged the frustration of
our situtation and the near im
possibility of our task — 35 of
us with 35 different stories to
tell, one of him, and 20 minutes
for all of it to happen.
Gorbachev is solid and self
contained. He speaks slowly
and deliberately, almost gently.
During the meeting, in good
Russian style, he sipped tea.
After a brief introduction by
George Shultz, Gorbachev
looked around and said, "Here
we sit, in a room with five
Nobel laureates and all the rest
of you, and I have to admit I
do not know what to do."
Seeing Gorbachev at a loss

was itself rather unusual, but
he spoke appropriately. The
agenda was unclear, and it was
certainly not an occasion for
shaking hands with the crowd.
Shultz then introduced an
economist, two geneticists, a
laser physicist and an earth
quake researcher. Gorbachev
listened to their remarks, and
responded with minimal emo
tion, but utter confidence in the
potential and success of joint
Soviet-American scientific re
search and exchange.
The "conversation," as the
meeting was dubbed, was not
spontaneous, and the limited
time allowed no room for
dialogue. It was mechanical.
No students were asked to
speak. The absence of the stu
dent voice in this meeting
slighted Gorbachev's introduc
tion to the Stanford communi
ty
Despite Gorbachev's un
avoidably superficial exchange,
no one would have left our
meeting the way the senators
in Washington last week
walked out of an hour-and-a
half meeting with Gorbachev,
outspokenly angry and disap
pointed at his long-winded,
stale rhetoric.
The popular attitude of those
in the Littlefield Center meeting
yesterday seemed basically
sympathetic, if not celebratory.
We had thought we would not
even get to see him at all.
