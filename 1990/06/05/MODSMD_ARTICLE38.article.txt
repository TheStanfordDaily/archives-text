# Visit should polish Stanford's image
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
If the Oct. 17 earthquake was a public
relations nightmare for the University, Gor
bachev's visit yesterday was a dream come
true.
Several spectators and participants in yes
terday's media hoopla speculated that the na
tional attention will help Stanford in every
thing from fund raising to freshman applica
tions.
"We will be for two hours the main news
story in the world," said Stanford News Serv
ice reporter Joel Shurkin yesterday morning.
Shurkin compared the image-boosting pos
sibilities of Gorbachev's speech to those sur
rounding Winston Churchill's 1946 "Iron Cur
tain" speech at Westminster College in Fulton,
Mo. Gorbachev's speech could be as pivotal
and as historic, Shurkin speculated.
The attention paid to Stanford during the
visit is likely to encourage students to apply,
according to Jean Fetter, dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions.
Fetter, who cited quality of education as

'Any high school student who
chooses to apply to a school
because of the number of
visiting dignitaries is making
decisions for very superficial
reasons.'

the primary reason students choose Stanford,
said, "Every tribute paid to the distinctions
of Stanford's faculty simply reinforces the
belief that this is a university where you will
receive a very good education."
She also pointed to the presence of several
thousand journalists on the campus, which
she called "significant exposure" for the uni
versity.
Fetter was quick to add, however, that in
her opinion "any high school student who
chooses to apply to a school because of the
number of visiting dignitaries is making de
cisions for very superficial reasons."

She said this isn't the first time people
have tied media exposure to greater numbers
of applicants. Applications did increase after
the internationally televised 1984 Olympic soc
cer tournament and the 1985 Super Bowl, as
well as after Queen Elizabeth's 1983 visit.
But Fetter does not anticipate a net increase
in the number of applicants next year. Because
of the shrinking pool of high school seniors,
she expects a drop each year through 1995.
Although observers such as Shurkin antic
ipated that the visit would help the Univer
sity's fund-raising efforts, the official word
from the Development Office was far more
circumspect.
David Fulton, director of communication,
emphasized that most large gifts come from
long-term contact with the University. "I
doubt very much that there will be any per
ceptible effect on fund raising," he said.
Yet speculation was widespread that Gor
bachev's visit would counter any negative
publicity about the earthquake.
And, of course, many Stanford patriots
found it hard not to gloat.
As Shurkin put it,"He ain't at Harvard."
