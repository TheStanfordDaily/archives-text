# Media circus
## Boat load of journalists descends on Bay Area 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
The circus came to town with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, and its over
eager members were willing to jump
through hoops and perform tightrope walks
— as long as it meant a good story.
All to get the perfect soundbite, quote
or footage, the Gorbachev media extrava
ganza drew a reported 5,000 journalists to
the Bay Area.
"Gorbachev's visit is getting big play
around the world," Reuters correspondent
Dean Lokken said. "His speech at Stanford
will be on the front page of every European
paper."
Jay Mathews of The Washington Post
said Gorbachev's visit would definitely be
front-page news. "The Post is planning to
run three or four stories about his Stanford
visit," Mathews said. "The scientists of the
country will be pleased with Gorbachev's
speech."
Reporters from Cable News Network,
The Associated Press and United Press
International all reiterated that Gorba
chev's historic visit will indeed be the day's
top news story for papers across the coun
try.
"Gorbachev's visit is a huge event," San
Francisco Chronicle reporter John Wilder
muth said. "It's not quite as big as the
Democratic National Convention was, but
definitely bigger than the Pope's recent
visit." The Chronicle sent 30 reporters to
Stanford, the San Jose Mercury News a
mere 29 reporters.
KZSU, the campus radio station, was in
a particularly awkward position with the

Television stations brought live coverage of the Gorbachev visit to homes throughout the United States and the Soviet
Union. More than 5,000 journalists descended upon the Bay Area to cover yesterday's events.
Gorbachev coverage. The station
found out from the Secret Service
last Thursday that it would be
"evicted" from its studio in the
basement of Memorial Audito
rium for security measures.
News director Claire Greene
was even called at home and ques
tioned previous to the visit. Nick
named the "Radio in Exile" for
the occasion, KZSU broadcast
from Maples Pavilion.
Joel Shurkin of Stanford News
Service said jokingly that prepar
ing for the Gorbachev visit was
"two-and-a-half weeks of non-stop
chaos. So far it's been a lot of
fun." Shurkin is the same person
who was quoted — out of context,
he is quick to point out — in the
national media as saying that the
people involved in the recent
ASSU election protests were
"anal-retentive."
The News Service has heard re
quests for media coverage from
all over the world.
TV Asahi from Tokyo, Japan,
sent two reporters to cover the
historic visit. Reporter Yuri Shirai

said, "As soon as he leaves the
campus, I'm going to feed cover
age from Stanford back to Tokyo.
It will make it just in time for
the 6 a.m. network news."
One could hear a few irritated
sighs as one television station
made the announcement that
Gorby would be half an hour to
an hour late.
John Boykin, acting editor and
manager of Stanford Magazine,
said it was a case of "hurry up
and wait." He rushed to Maples
Pavilion at 7:20 a.m. yesterday to
get his press credentials so that
he could be herded like an animal
into a press pen at History Corner
where he would wait for the next
few hours.
"You spend all this time pre
paring for the opportunity to get
a three-second glimpse," Boykin
said. "There is nothing the guy
can do of any consequence in the
short time he's here. He can't get
anything meaningful from Stan
ford and he can't give anything
meaningful to Stanford in the
short time he's here, except for
something in the speech."
