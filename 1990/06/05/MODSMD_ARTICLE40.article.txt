# Hobee's taken to lunch by imposter

When sophomore Steve Escamilla's
alarm woke him up yesterday morn
ing, he heard Soviet President Mikail
Gorbachev on the radio — live from
Hobee's Restaurant in Palo Alto.
Or so he thought.
Around 7 a.m. in the morning,
radio station KSJO began a live in
terview at Hobee's when what ap
peared to be nine Secret Service men
entered the restaurant, according to
Camille Finch, a manager at the Town
& Country Hobee's.
"From our end, we had no idea
what was going on. Somebody who
looked like Raisa and Gorbachev came
in. Then they put him on the air."
Many people, including Escamilla,
hurried over to Hobee's when they
heard on the radio that he was there.
"I only saw Gorby through the tinted
window, but I saw Raisa through a
crack in the door, and she looked very
real," Escamilla recalled.
But 45 minutes later, the restau
rant owner's daughter called to tell
the staff that it was all a big hoax,
Finch said.
KSJO hired Gorbachev look-alikes
as a part of a joke, according to Finch.
KSJO had no comment yesterday.
