# Gorbachev's late arrival fails to throw University for a loop
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
University officials didn't quite know
what to expect when they planned the
schedule for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit.
Although the published itinerary lent
the visit an air of precise timing, the trip
was "actually planned with the idea of
many possible configurations and out
comes in mind," according to Public Af
fairs official Richard Kurovsky, who
worked with the Soviet consulate to coor
dinate the day's events.
"We were ready for anything,"
Kurovsky said.
When planning the visit, a steering

committee headed by Bob Freelen, vice
president for public affairs, needed to
consider not only the myriad of uncon
trollable factors — such as the weather
and traffic delays — but also the unpre
dictable nature of Gorbachev himself.
The Soviet president is known for
spending a great deal of time meeting
and talking to people in crowds. "He likes
to shake hands," Kurovsky said.
Upon arriving at the Quad, Gorbachev
delighted several thousand students, fac
ulty and staff by shaking hands and ex
changing brief words with many of them.
The planned itinerary "was pretty
much blown apart," because of the
amount of time Gorbachev spent with
fans, Kurovsky said. The soviet President

had also arrived 50 minutes late to
campu9.
The Soviet Consulate never contacted
the University to schedule changes after
the delay. As a result, Associate Vice Pres
ident for Public Affairs Stephen Peeps,
the coordinator of Gorbachev's visit, did
not know what the Soviets were planning.
Peeps could only speculate all day on
where Gorbachev would go next and what
stops he might omit.
The University's flexibility in planning
allowed for uncertainty, but some prob
lems caused by lack of communication
did turn up.
Some examples of these included Quad
spectator entrances that were poorly
marked and a last-minute change in plans

concerning the Art Gallery visit.
One minute before Gorbachev was
scheduled to appear at the Art Gallery,
Art Prof. Wanda Corn was informed that
the Soviet president and his wife would
not have time to tour the building and
that the gift presentations of seven works
of art had to be done outside.
In less than one minute, the seven
artists rushed inside, removed their
pieces from the wall, and went back out
side to present them, according to Corn.
The work of one artist, Richard Payne,
was damaged during the transition.
According to Corn, "the visit went as
well as might be expected under the
surprise circumstances."
"The Gorbachevs were very receptive;

they said a word about each word of art,
and really personalized the stop," said
Corn.
Payne said he spoke to Raisa Gorbachev
for several minutes about his work, but
was disappointed that the stay was shor
tened, since it was the only cultural
aspect of Gorbachev's Stanford visit.
The Office of Public Affairs worked
closely with the Secret Service on security
for this event, which went smoothly, ac
cording to both Kurovsky and many of
ficers.
One Secret Service officer stationed in
the Quad reported with a smile that the
only problem he ran into that day "was
a shortage of bathroom facilities."
