# Camping out at Tresidder Some spend two days hoping to glimpse Gorby
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
For the first time in weeks, the penetrat
ing rays of sunshine beat relentlessly
against my skin. My complexion cried out
for the bronze kiss of the sun. It was a
day for frisbee, a day for swimming. It was
a day for relaxation. It was the day to
camp out for Gorbachev tickets.
June 2, 1990
2:10 p.m.: Incredulous Tresidder employ
ees and bystanders line up to gawk at the
two morons who decided to wait for tickets
42 hours in advance of Gorbachev's
Memorial Auditorium speech.
2:14 p.m.: "I admire your . .. stamina,"
snickers a bystander. Even skateboarders
from Paly High are sniggering. More people
arrive.
7:04 p.m.: By now, at least 11 people are
present; card games begin.
7:17 p.m.: "There's a sucker born every
minute," chortles a girl who had just sold
her ticket to see Gorbachev in the Quad
for $70. She also reports that a Mem Aud
ticket was just sold for $1,000.
7:19 p.m.: Students break out with cal
culators and begin to tabulate the odds of
receiving a Mem Aud ticket.
9:46 p.m.: Excitement surges through the
Line, as students begin to fantasize about
the possibility of setting up a TV and a
VCR.
9:47 p.m.: Fellow linemates, juniors Jason
Tankel and Veronica Gomez, set up a Mac

intosh SE, and make enormous progress
on their Poli Sci papers for Prof. David
Abernethy. Gomez states her reasons for
camping out: "I didn't get picked. I'm get
ting my work done. I didn't have anything
else to do and I have a good chance of
seeing him. I also want the chance to laugh
at my professor when he arrives Monday
morning to try and get a ticket."
9:59 p.m.: Our first KGB impersonator
arrives. A man, about s*B" with glasses,
sandals and a worn Stanford sweatshirt,
declares himself to be from the "advance
team," in a warped, Ukranian accent. An
enormous wave of stragglers join our Line.
11:00 p.m.: A TV and VCR arrive from
Wilbur. The Line celebrates.
11:20 p.m.: An unidentified man wanders
inside Tresidder, offering to sell three Mem
Aud tickets for astronomical sums. No
takers.
11:30 p.m.: "Predator" begins. Sighs arise
from female viewers as Schwarzenegger's
pecs flex and ripple.
June 3, 1990
1:14 a.m.: First blatant sign of delirium
surfaces. Tankel, musing over his dedica
tion to Gorbachev, murmurs, "I'll wake
up, and I'll see his birthmark in my face,
and I'll say: 'You've come, you've come,
Mikhail!' "
1:20 a.m.: We take roll of the people
signed up on the list, to ensure no one has
signed the list and gone home until Monday

Students took up temporary residence in the Tresidder ticket office as early as two days before Mikhail Gorbachev's
visit. They were hoping to pick up any tickets that became available at the last minute.
