# Anything for a ticket
## Making fakes, selling to highest bidder quite common 
### Jock Friedly Theresa Urist Staff writers 
The scene: Kinko's copy shop,
229 California Ave. The crime:
forgery. The motive: Gorby
Mania.
The copy center has been head
quarters for students who wanted
the red cardboard Quad passes to
see Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev, but were not lucky enough
to get them through the random
draw. With ordinary red card
stock and a photocopier, the Quad
passes could be replicated with
ease.
That's what two seniors, who
both asked for anonymity because
they did not have an affinity for
dealing with irate Secret Service
agents, were doing the night
before Gorbachev was to arrive
on campus. Their passes worked,
and so did fake passes for dozens
of other students who forged tick
ets.
Other students who resorted to
more legal means of getting tick
ets paid for scalped tickets. Be
cause they were transferable,
tickets to see Gorbachev in the
Quad, Littlefield Center and
Memorial Auditorium were being

sold throughout the weekend at
a fast and furious pace. Quad tick
ets typically sold for about $20 or
$25 per ticket.
Littlefield tickets, which al
lowed students onto the lawn out
side the building, sold for slightly
higher figures than the Quad. But
in desperation, and maybe confu
sion, one student bought a Lit
tlefield ticket for $1,000. He may
have thought the ticket would
grant him admittance to the small
meeting inside Littlefield, not just
to the lawn out front.
He was devastated when he
learned Gorbachev was thinking
of canceling his trip to Littlefield
after arriving to campus nearly
an hour later than scheduled. Gor
bachev, who likes roaming in
crowds, went to Littlefield as
scheduled, but he cut his visit
short.
In Memorial Auditorium, tick
ets reportedly went for even more
money. Widespread but uncom
firmed reports put $1,800 as the
price for one ticket close to the
stage. Fifteen hundred dollars was
another uncomfirmed price paid
for a student ticket.
High scalping prices gave some
students a hard choice.
Said junior Mike Fee as he stood

in line at Tresidder Union to pick
up unclaimed tickets, "Now we're
here with a big moral dilemma
— whether to see the most im
portant man on earth or to sell
them for $1,000."
Eric Lee, a sophomore, had a
ticket for Memorial Auditorium,
but he was waiting in line for
another one. "I know it's a once
in-a-lifetime opportunity to see
the man, but for all practical pur
poses" money is better, Lee said.
In an interview after he
schmoozed with the Soviet's top
dog, University President Donald
Kennedy said, "I'm not very com
fortable with the whole thing."
"It does bother me," he said,
"but I suspect that the amount
(of scalping) that went on was less
than suspected."
Many students, particularly
those who did not want to pay
money for a scalped ticket, sug
gested that a better way could
have been found to hand out the
tickets.
Said Lee, "Maybe a different
method should have been used to
allot tickets — priority by inter
est."

Tickets to see the Soviet leader were such a hot item that scalpers were able to command hundreds
of dollars for the precious ducats.
