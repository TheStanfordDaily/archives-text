# First ladies friendly, frictionless, feudless

No Feud of the First Ladies
marred the Gorbachevs'
picture-perfect visit to Stan
ford yesterday.
Robin Kennedy, First Lady
of the Farm, seemed uni
ntimidated by the presence of
her Soviet counterpart, Raisa
Gorbachev. Although the two
women spent most of their time
yesterday walking beside their
husbands, at one point they
walked side by side, arms
barely touching as they smiled
and exchanged a few words.

Mrs. Kennedy exuded a
warmth and friendliness that
must have charmed Mrs. Gor
bachev after her late breakfast
with her reputed rival Nancy
Reagan. Local news media
covering the Reagan-
Gorbachev meeting in San
Francisco yesterday added to
the long-running commentary
on the friction at work between
the women.
But First-lady friction
created no seismic waves yes
terday on the Farm. Both Mrs.
Gorbachev and Mrs. Kennedy
seemed at ease amid the cheer
ing crowds and nattily dressed
Secret Service agents.
