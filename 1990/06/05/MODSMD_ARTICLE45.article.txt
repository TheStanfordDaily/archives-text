### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
Dozens lined up to share their
wealth with Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev yesterday, offering
the leader of the communist world
items ranging from T-shirts to
artwork.
Besides the poster which was
presented to Gorbachev after his
speech in Memorial Auditorium,
another official University gift to
Gorbachev was a series of eight
photographs. The pictures, taken
by Zeni Cieslikowski, a Rancho
Mirage resident, featured such
Stanford scenes as the Quad and
Memorial Church.
According to Mary Bartlett, as
sistant director of University re
lations, the photographs were
taken last month and were chosen

because they depict the place
where Gorbachev visited yester
day.
The University wanted to give
a unique gift, Bartlett added. The
photographs will be encased in
containers that bear the Univer
sity's seal, she said.
The Soviet president also re
ceived a number of items from
the Stanford community.
The Graduate School of Busi
ness invited Gorbachev to
nominate a Soviet citizen to at
tend its Stanford Executive Pro
gram during either this year or
next, with all fees waived.
This highly selective educa
tional program on general man
agement, which costs $22,600 this
year, attracts approximately 200
senior executives from around the
world annually. During the eight

weeks of the program, the partic
ipants study economics and man
agement theory and practice
under the guidance of leading pro
fessors from the Business School.
Another gift for Gorbachev was
this year's dormitory T-shirt of
Slavianskii Dom, the Russian and
East European theme house. The
design, which was created by
sophomore Aram Irwin and other
residents, spells out "Stanford" in
Cyrillic and includes the Soviet
hammer and sickle.

The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion awarded Gorbachev a life
membership. A certificate that
accompanied his membership card
mentioned his country's
"generous hospitality to upwards
of 1,000 travelers in 11 delega
tions of Stanford Alumni Associ
ation visitors to the U.S.S.R."
Gorbachev's gift box will also
be spilling out books from promi
nent writers. Lazar Fleishman, on
behalf of the Stanford University
Libraries Slavic Collections,
prepared a publication, "Poetry
and Revolution in Russia 1905-
1930, An Exhibition of Books and
Manuscripts," for Gorbachev.
Fleishman said the publication
is about an exhibition last October
of materials from the Hoover In
stitution and the library. "It con
sists of unique materials of social
institutions," he said.
Professor of Biological Sciences
Paul Ehrlich and senior research
associate Anne Ehrlich gave Gor
bachev a copy of their book "The
Population Explosion," which is
about over-population and the en
vironment.
The authors signed the book
"with great admiration and many
thanks for all you are doing for
the world."
Grant Barnes, director of the
Stanford University Press, gave
Gorbachev a copy of "The Stan
ford Album" in "a beautiful hand
carved redwood holder," said
Bartlett.
