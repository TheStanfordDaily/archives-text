A 1921 Soviet poster nearly brought
Mikhail Gorbachev to tears, as former
Secretary of State George Shultz pre
sented it to the Soviet president after
his historic Stanford speech yesterday.
Gorbachev said, emotionally: "It was
difficult to imagine that our meeting
could be completed in such a marvelous
way, and that we could hear the words
of Pushkin: 'Long live the sun! May the
darkness be hidden!' n
These lines of Alexander Pushkin
(1779-1837), famous Russian poet and
novelist, make up the caption of the
poster, which endorses literacy and en
lightenment. It depicts a bright sun com
ing up in the background and students
reading in the front, with dark clouds
dispersing on the sides.
The poster was originally to be exhib
ited as part of the Hoover Institution
Russian and Soviet Collection before
Gorbachev deleted Hoover from his

itinerary.
Since it was already beautifully
framed, Shultz arranged for it to be
given to Gorbachev on behalf of the
Stanford community, said Charles Palm,
associate director of Hoover.
Palm said the sun symbolizes knowl
edge and the dark clouds represent ig
norance, which is dispersing. "It really
links glasnoBt to the revolutionary her
itage of [Gorbachev's] country," Palm
added.
The poster "symbolizes for all of us
the power of knowledge to enrich our
lives and bridge our differences," said
John Raisian, director of Hoover.
According to Michele Horaney of Hoo
ver's Office of Public Affairs, Hoover
has 5,000 posters from the 1920s in its
Soviet archives. The collection was gath
ered by Frank Golden, Stanford histo
rian and professor. Golden had personal
friends in the Soviet government, and
the posters were just given away at that
time, Horaney said.
