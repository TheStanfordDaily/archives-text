# Soviet president skips tour, but picks up many paintings

"Life isn't about moving boundaries, or
what machines of war could be made —
it's about creativity." Gorbachev's itinerary
yesterday put Stanford graduate art stu
dent Robert Payne's maxim to the test.
Struggling to remain within the moving
boundaries of his schedule, Gorbachev
scrapped his original plans to tour the Stan
ford Art Gallery and view the works of
Payne and four other Stanford artists.
"We were going to present our works,
and they were going to see the graduate
art shows," said artist Dani Tull. "It would
have been incredible."
Instead, Payne, Tull and fellow graduate
students Matthew Chansky, Leslie Smith,
and Francesca Sundsten settled for a brief
conversation with the Gorbachevs outside
the gallery. There the five students each
presented the Soviet leader with a repre
sentative piece of their works.
Despite the last-minute change of plans,
the students felt thrilled to meet the Gor
bachevs. According to Chansky, meeting
the Soviet president was "a very powerful

moment."
Raisa Gorbachev brought her interpre
tive powers to bear during the brief meet
ing. "She took the time with each one of
our works to make a personal judgment
about what it means," said Payne. "She
really took the time to think about it for
herself."
Smith was pleased with Mrs. Gorbachev's
interest in the students' artistic vision.
"She looked at my photograph and ... she
wanted to know if it was real life, or if I
had altered the thing I had found." Smith's
photograph depicted discarded purses in
South San Francisco.
Smith told Mrs. Gorbachev that she did
not alter the subject of her photograph, to
which Gorbachev replied, "It's the way life
should not be."
According to Payne, Mrs. Gorbachev
decided finally that his work — a crucified
Christ surrounded by a halo of the words
"Lord, have mercy" in Spanish — was both
"a warning and a blessing." Perhaps the
vision of these five Stanford students will
inspire Mrs. Gorbachev's husband to con
tinue struggling to recreate the world as
it should be.
