# Overwhelmed Gorbachev greeters get thrill of a lifetime
## 
### Ruben Garcia 
Junior Rana Bhadury didn't plan to
say much to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev in his greeting on the front
steps of the Quad. Even if he had some
thing prepared, he wouldn't have been
ready for the conversation that occurred.
"I was wearing my maroon [Stanford]
sweatshirt, and he asked, 'Is that a Stan
ford football sweatshirt?' and I told him
it wasn't. Then he asked, 'What do you
think of the Stanford-Cal game? Who
will win?' "
Stunned, Bhadury replied, "Stanford,
of course," to which the Soviet leader
rejoined, "I think so, too."
Gorbachev's remarks were a fitting be
ginning to a brief visit that focused fairly
heavily on Stanford's own attributes and
traditions.

"It was definitely not what I would
have expected," said Bhadury, who was
chosen to greet the Gorbachevs because
of an obscure invitation he sent to Gor
bachev to speak at Stanford.
Bhadury, director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, and assistant director
Beth Howe presented a bouquet of irises
and roses to Raisa Gorbachev in the Quad
after the Soviet president met the pri
mary welcoming committee. The Soviet
president gave Howe a big hug after she
said, "Welcome to Stanford" in Russian.
"I don't think our invitation is the
only reason he's coming, but it may have
had something to do with it," said
Bhadury, who is a junior in electrical
engineering and economics.
Apparently, the Office of Public Affairs
thought so too when it asked Howe and
Bhadury to be a part of the official wel

coming committee.
Bhadury and Howe invited Gorbachev
to campus at the beginning of the school
year and re-extended the invitation in
April when they heard about Gorbachev's
summit meeting with President Bush.
While Gorbachev was not as talkative
as past speakers such as NBC News
anchor Tom Brokaw, renowned psychol
ogist Dr. Joyce Brothers and former pres
idential aide Larry Speakes, Bhadury and
Howe seemed to agree that meeting the
leader of the Soviet Union was the high
light of the year, possibly of their
lifetimes.
Howe, a sophomore, called it "one of
the best days of my life." She said, "He
was very warm and friendly."
Bhadury said he wanted to take his
Stanford sweatshirt off then and give it
to Gorbachev, but he had been warned

by the Secret Service not to make any
rapid movements.
Now Bhadury is considering sending
it to the Soviet president on behalf of
the Speakers Bureau.
He characterized Raisa Gorbachev as
"being really quiet," standing behind her
husband and graciously accepting the
flowers with a short "thank you."
While Bhadury was anxious about
meeting Gorbachev, all nervousness was
lost in talking to him. It was "like talking
to a father or grandfather," he said.
Spontaneity was not on the agenda for
the Public Affairs Office or the vast se
curity force working at the Quad.
Bhadury and Howe were required to at
tend a rehearsal on Saturday where they
were told "what to do" and "what not
to do," Bhadury said.
"We were supposed to avoid contact of

any kind unless he initiated it, and
definitely no kissing," Bhadury said. "We
weren't supposed to reach into our pocket
while near him, either."
Public Affairs officials also discouraged
people from saying too much outside of
the usual "welcome" and "thank you"
courtesies to help Gorbachev keep to his
tight schedule.
Tight schedules are a big obstacle to
the Speakers Bureau. Invitations ex
tended to such figures as former Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, President George
Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle
have all been rejected for this reason.
Will the Gorbachev visit bring even
bigger names to Stanford? "It can't hurt,"
said Bhadury. "When we find out some
one famous will be in the area, we extend
an invitation for them to speak here,"
Bhadury said.
