# Rewording welcomes and witticisms
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Imagine your ears hearing a
sentence of one language, your
brain translating it and your
mouth speaking it in another lan
guage while you are simultane
ously listening for the next
sentence.
Now imagine performing this
task for one of the world's most
prominent leaders. Slavic Studies
Prof. Andrew Wachtel bore this
honor as Mikhail Gorbachev's per
sonal translator throughout yes
terday's visit.
Wachtel participated in what he
called the "spontaneous" part of
the tour, as opposed to the written
translation of Gorbachev's speech
which was done by the Soviet
president's personal translators.
Wachtel translated during the
meetings and greetings, the
walking tour of the Quadrangle,
the presentation of the paintings
outside the Art Gallery and the
walks to Littlefield Center and
Memorial Auditorium.
Much of his work consisted of
introductions, he said. Former
Secretary of State George Shultz
and his wife O'Bie were the only
people Gorbachev knew on a per
sonal level, since they had visited

together in Moscow a few times
before.
In contrast to most of the of
ficial statements he translated,
Wachtel relayed some of
Gorbachev's witticisms. Through
Wachtel, Gorbachev told the
group, "You should all have to
pay a tax on this weather."
Wachtel said the Soviet presi
dent is very "headstrong" and
that his demeanor commands re
spect. He added, "Gorbachev has
that politician's way of flashing a
smile when a crowd is getting
ready to clap."
While it was a thrill to meet
the Soviet president, it was also
"mentally tiring," Wachtel said,
adding that professional trans
lators cannot get behind. If they
do, "they just chop something out,
or they're totally lost."
Wachtel said he believes that a
person cannot learn to translate,
either translating on the first try
or never at all.
Wachtel has learned not to wor
ry, however, noting, "You learn
where there will be a pause" or
how to identify the beginning of
a "platitude." In conversation, he
said, no one usually talks for very
long, and if they do, "They rarely
say continually interesting
things."

He received his training in si
multaneous translation while
traveling through the Soviet
Union in 1985 and 1987. He was
writing two books with a pair of
San Francisco photographers and
conducted many interviews in
Russian.
He first learned Russian as a
freshman in college in 1977. He
said he was inspired to take the
language because he has a Rus
sian grandmother, but his interest
in the "fascinating" culture has
kept him going.
He came to Stanford in the fall
of 1988, leaving behind a position
as a junior fellow in the Harvard
University Society of Fellows.
Wachtel has a Berkeley doctorate
in Slavic languages.
In 1981 he visited the Soviet
Union for four months and has
been there many times since.
"Once you're there, you know
what it's all about," he said, re
ferring to some of the "horren
dous living conditions" and
poverty that the government had
once tried to hide.
However, he said that many
parts of the Soviet Union — such
as the Caucuses, the Baltics and
Central Asia — are very colorful
and diverse.
