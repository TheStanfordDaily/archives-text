# Gorbachev's speech in Memorial Auditorium
## 
### 
The following are excerpts from Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's address
yesterday in Memorial Auditorium:
Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased
that within the framework of my state visit to
the United States, I am here among you within
the walls of the world famous Stanford Univer
sity. Thank you for your warm hospitality.
I think that those who would go to such a
university are doubly lucky. It is in California,
and California is a special place even by inter
national standards, (laughter)
And I am saying this not just by way of a
compliment to say pleasant things to the gover
nor of this state, who is here with his wife; I
think I am just stating a fact.
They say that only five countries in the world
produce a greater gross output than your state.
The ideas and technologies of tomorrow are
born here in California. California is closely
linked economically with Europe, Asia and Latin
America. So this is an appropriate place, a
good place, for discussing how the Soviet Union
and United States have positioned themselves
on the dividing line between the two centuries
and two eras on the coast of the Pacific which
Alexander, our great countryman, prophetically
described as the "Mediterranean of the future."
It is appropriate now to ponder the destinies
of the world, since it was here in San Francisco
that the United Nations was founded approxi
mately 45 years ago. This was the city that
was selected as the place where to proclaim
the foundation, the establishment of this organ
ization whose efficiency we all need very much.
Let us look at the conclusions that were
made at that time, right after the horrible war.
The United Nations was set up to "maintain
peace and security and remove the political,
economic and social causes of war; to promote
justice and international law; to promote rela
tions among nations based upon the principle
of equal rights and self-determination
(unintelligible).
Respect for human rights and for fundamental
freedoms without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion.
Marvelous words, marvelous appeal. But,
alas, it is only now that we are coming closer
to addressing these tasks in practical terms.
It is only now that international politics is
really starting to adjust itself to these ideas and
principles.
And all of us must have felt how much we
need the United Nations if we really are to
move towards a new world, a new kind of
relationships in the world in the interests of all
countries and all nations.
For a long time, the Pacific was the theater
of confrontations and the arms race. On oppo
site shores, we found ourselves on opposite
sides of Asian revolutions. But new winds are
now blowing in Asia.
And 4t has been developing dynamically ac
cording to own logic. Several examples of
economic efficiency and international interac
tion.
The Koreans and Chinese and other Asian
peoples have lessons for the entire world to
learn, including lessons for us and for you.
And to avoid finding out from the sidelines,
we ought to work expeditiously to abolish po
litical and military rivalry.
Let us think about the future. Our two coun
tries have more than enough reasons to be
partners in building it and should bring new
security structures in Europe and in the Asian
Pacific region.
And that's why we are on the threshold of a
truly global economy, indeed, and the creation
of a new civilization.
I am under no illusions as to the possibilities
of a faster (unintelligible) convergence of our
two societies. They are quite different.
For many years they were developing in dif
ferent directions. They probably will never be
fully alike.
There is no need for that.
It is important to see the thrust of what is
happening as we move toward a world without
wars, a world of equality and freedom. And our
cooperation to build a better future
(unintelligible) the fact that the Cold War is now
behind us.
Let us not wrangle over who won it, who
won the cold war. There is no winner in a cold
war, just as in nuclear war. This truth has always
been established. Each of the Cold War coun
tries knows that
Talk about the cold war being useful to some
countries, I think is just political (unintelligible)
and irresponsibility. Those of us who know the
burden of the arms race because of the Cold
War know that particularly well.
The cold war was nurturing our political
(unintelligible) and we came to the political

choice that (unintelligible) opened the way to
cooperation between our two great nations, two
great peoples.
Through our two countries there is a share
of responsibility for the fact that the post-war
period in the history of mankind takes on the
character of an exhausting and dangerous con
frontation.
It is now, and it's quite logical to say, that it
is now our common responsibility to make sure
that the mechanisms of military confrontation
are dismantled as soon as possible.
There was a time when military procurement
orders were considered by some as an incentive
for economic and technological progress. There
was a time, I have been told, you (Californians)
were the first to realize that a military economy
is ultimately a dead end.
Even from the standpoint of practical benefit.
It is symbolic that as early as the 1970's
Santa Clara County, which then ranked first in
per capita military contracts began to look for
ways of demilitarizing the local economy. I hope
that as Soviet-American relations improve, mil
itary procurement and participation in the arms
race will become a thing of the past, but for
both our great powers.
Science has played a major role in the arms
race. Yet science was the first to speak out
against this disease ... This we credit to the
joint efforts of Soviet and American scientists
to which Stanford University scientists have
made a very substantial contribution.
I am referring to the development of the basic
principles for such concepts as international
security and (unintelligible). Without a serious
and objective approach to finding stability and
mutual security, without a scientific analysis
taking into account all matters — political, sci
entific, military-technical and political-military —
it is impossible to make the right decision on
cardinal issues, nuclear and conventional arms
reduction.
Scientists of our two countries make the nec
essary estimates and discuss them over and
over again. They approached this work as a
scientific project. And put aside the political
and military convictions which had long stood
in the way of a solution.
Thus they helped to arrive at major political
decisions, including those adopted over these
days in Washington. So we are pleased to
mention the names of some Stanford university
scientists who for many years have worked with
patience and perseverance on this important
project. All of them have very high academic
reputations and all believe in the need for peace
and triumph of reason and sanity .... Among
them I would like to mention (Wolfgang)
Panofsky, Sidney Drell, William Perry, David
Holloway and others from the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control.
It is better that they are with ... colleagues
on the committee of Soviet scientists adjusting
nuclear threat, Drs. (Y.M.) Primakov, (Yuri)
Osypian, (S.S.) Shatalin . .. They and others
have been doing much to build the bridge of
trust between our countries. I take advantage
of this opportunity to thank all of them most
warmly, and I hope that you will join me in this.
Stanford scientists have also done much to
initiate contact between both countries' defense
industries on the problem of conversion. This
promising area in our relations can bring sub
stantial dividends to all of us. New steps in
disarmament require nations and business
(unintelligible). Soviet and American scientists
will have a lot of work to do in this area, too,
in order to identify the borderline between per
missible modernization and (unintelligible). I
think we should keep in mind this ... because
we don't want new weapons to come to replace
nuclear weapons because those new weapons
would still be weapons of mass destruction.
It is quite necessary and quite appropriate
and timely at this moment.
We would like scientists and engineers to
work on these issues and on other disarmament
problems, such as the proposition of chemical
weapons, and short-range nuclear weapons.
For scientists to work on those problems we
need more, not less, ingenuity than in devel
opment weapons.
President Bush and I had to note that it is
not that easy ... to destroy those weapons
once we decided to scrap them. We need
technologies for destroying those dangerous
weapons, and I think we have to work together
to make sure that there is no damage done to
the environment and to people's health. So he
(Bush) may have problems too, but I hope that
we will work with those problems by joining
our efforts.
I have heard that Stanford scientists would
like to cooperate closely with their Soviet col
leagues on the problem of the environment.
This too is an area of importance for the world
development. Thanks in part to Stanford's con

tributions to Soviet-American cooperation ...
our two countries are leaders in this field. I
would like to mention Stanford (applied physics)
professors (Malcolm) Beasley and (Ted) Geballe
for organizing last summer's world conference
on superconductivity in which more than 30
Soviet scientists took part.
The Soviet Union and the United States are
leaders in such areas as the fundamental prop
erties of matter, solid state physics, mathemat
ics, physical chemistry, astronomy and space
research and biological sciences.
Cooperation between universities would also
be of great interest. I know of the Stanford
library in the Hoover tower, the rich collection
of materials on the Russian revolution. For our
part, we could invite Stanford researchers to
work on projects in historical and literary ar
chives in the Soviet Union.
We are in favor of wide-ranging cooperation,
free and forceful minds who are aware of their
responsibility for our common future and who
are open to join in creating a free and
unimpeded exchange of their results.
Ladies and gentlemen, in our country we
have opted for fundamental changes. Our
perestroika is a result of profound trends taking
place in our society. In five years, in the last
five years, our country has had to become
different, But I believe that all mankind is en
tering a new age, and that the world is begin
ning to obey new laws and logic to which we
have yet to adjust ourselves.
Fifty-eight years ago the great Russian scien
tist Vladimir (unintelligible) wrote, and I quote,
"Mankind is a single entity. This light, the whole,
the diversity has become whole and indivisible.
(Unintelligible) is reflected and has repercus
sions everywhere on the earth's surface.
I continue quoting ... Television, telephone,
radio, airplanes, and airships cover the entire
globe. Communications are becoming easier
and more rapid. With each passing week they
become more organized and ... this process
of man's total (unintelligible) is determined by
an historical development of human thought
and is associated most closely with the in
creased speed of communications. Advances
in transportation technologies and the availa
bility of immediate dissemination and simulta
neous discussion of ideas throughout our entire
planet. I admire these thoughts because all of
this was said 50 years ago. Now we are facing
an evolution of international relations. Increasing
open and mass-scale human communications.
This greatly increases the role of creative and
positive policies. But it raises the price we must
pay for adherence to outdated dogmas, routine
and the old.
For a new type of progress throughout the
world, to come to reality, everyone must
change. Tolerance is the alpha and omega of
the new world order. Without tolerance and
respect for one's partner, without understanding
of his concerns and problems, we are bound
to fail.
That calls for the development of a new ap
proach to the subjects of security and coopera
tion and even alliance-building. Until now,
alliances have been built on a selective and,
in fact, discriminatory basis. They were based
on setting countries against each other. They
divided countries and peoples much more than
they united them.
This system was perfected during the years
of the Cold War.
Now we are approaching a time when the
very principle of alliance building should be
come different. It should mean dignity and con
ditions for a life worthy of a human being. A
protected environment, combating diseases,
drug addiction and ignorance.
It is in the common interest of all countries
and nations not to fight this (unintelligible)
toward new cooperation, but rather to promote
it. And I think (unintelligible) if they understand
the need for this and if they really work together
and contribute in a decisive way toward moving,
placing our entire civilization on the road of
genuinely peaceful development.
I see many young people here. There are
many more young people outside this room,
of course, and I am glad that I was able to
greet them too. And so, concluding my remarks,
I would like to address them: I would like to
address young people.
Your generation will not only be creating a
new world, but will also live in it. Much of it
you know will certainly be different from what
ever we can imagine now and even from what
I have been saying to you here, from this
rostrum. The challenge is to make sure that
people in that new world live a better life in
greater freedom.
But much will depend on you, the men and
women of science, in this great and unprece
dented undertaking. Thank you.
