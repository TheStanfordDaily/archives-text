# Soviet vendors laud U.S. freedom

Although all White Plaza vendors looked for
ward to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
visit, two in particular had reasons other than
capitalism.
Igor and Liliyana Yunerman, along with their
5-year-old son, arrived from Kiev nine months
ago and are hopeful about the Soviet leader's visit.
"I hope his visit helps both countries live in
peace and helps the Russian people live better,"
Liliyana said.
"He's trying to do what he can," Liliyana said.
"One person cannot change the world, especially
a big country like Russia with 70 years of wrong."
The Yunermans have an uncle in the Bay Area
who, along with the strong Russian Jewish com
munity, helped them adjust to life in America.
"The people [in the United States] are very
nice and helpful," Liliya said.
The couple took about one year to emigrate.
They had to obtain parental signatures and per
mission from Komsomol, the mandatory youth
league.
Both Igor and Liliya are structural engineers,
although they have not yet found work here.
Liliya learned English in the Soviet Union, but

her husband did not.
Liliyana began selling Russian merchandise
part-time a few weeks ago in White Plaza. She
sells Russian T-shirts, dolls, lacquer boxes,
watches, Soviet pins, sand jewelry, posters and
crystal figurines. The things on sale either belong
to the Yunermans or are on consignment from
other Russian emigres.
Liliyana and her husband both admire the
American economic system and its opportunities.
"This system is very right," Liliyana said. "I
see real freedom here. They should make the
same system in Russia if they want to better
life. Now the Soviet government is starting to
understand that their system is not right for the
people."
According to Liliya, the older generation, her
grandfathers, believed in communism. The sec
ond generation, her fathers, do not believe in
communism. "Our generation," Liliya said,
"hates communism."
The Yunermans say they escaped discrimina
tion from the Soviet government.
"When we graduated from the University [Kiev
State], we wanted to work in the Science and
Research Institute," Liliya said. "They said you
can't because you're Jewish. They said they had
enough Jews at 5 percent."
