## 
### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
The action reached a frenzied
climax due to Gorbachev's visit.
The players varied from the Uni
versity to the federal government
to youthful entrepreneurs. The
name of the game was capitalism,
and the goal was profit.
T-shirts were by far the most
popular products sold on campus
yesterday, although posters and
stationery were also sold.
"Today's our day to shine," said
Michael Folz, one White Plaza en
trepreneur who sold T-shirts.
The University's T-shirts, offi
cial commemorative Gorby T
shirts, have been selling like
hotcakes. The initial shipment
last week of 2,500 shirts sold out,
and six shipments were delivered
over the weekend. As of yesterday,
5,900 shirts had been sold, includ
ing those being held for staff
members.
"We are incredibly busy," said
senior Dan Vatanaviggun, a tour
guide who helped sell the T-shirts
for the University.
The lettering of the cream
colored shirts is stylistically con
sistent with the tickets and
Memorial Auditorium programs
distributed yesterday.
The University also sold Hoover
Institution posters advertising its
extensive Russian archival collec

tion.
The Bookstore, too, was strug
gling to meet public demand for
its commemorative T-shirt. Ac
cording to clothing buyer Laura
Dowling, the Bookstore sold out
of last week's initial shipment, and
four additional shipments were
delivered throughout the week
end.
Dowling said the Bookstore has
sold more than 2,000 shirts, which
feature a Soviet flag, an American
flag and the Stanford seal. Several
hundred customers filled out or
der forms for today's shipment,
which she "knows will be sold
out."
She said the Bookstore plans to
order extras at the end of this
week or next week.
David Bienn opened a small
stand yesterday selling shirts with
Gorbachev's portrait which read
"Gorby!" underneath. Bienn sold
about 10) shirts during the past
several days, but said yesterday
was the best sales day all week.
"Since it was the day for
the man to be here, it was nat
urally the best for business,"
Bienn said.
Bienn said he does not mind
the competition from the other
vendors.
My shirt "is an all-purpose
design, and a lot of people like
the portrait of Gorbachev," he
added.

Bienn sold the shirts to raise
money for an arts exchange pro
gram in Leningrad sponsored by
the Foundation for Social Inno
vation.
Although Folz's T-shirts were
not commemorative, he said that
did not really affect sales.
"Sales have been great all week
end," he said.
Folz sold plenty of T-shirts writ
ten in Russian, saying the lan
guage barrier was not much of a
problem.
"Well, since nothing makes any
sense any more, why not make
T-shirts that no one can read?"
he asked. "We thought it was
about time somebody put the fun
back into dialectical materialism."
His most popular item? The
Gorbachev happy face T-shirt.
An employee for T-shirt entre
preneur Gary Freed said "natural
ly, sales were better" yesterday.
His most popular shirt was the
"Totally Unofficial Gorbachev T-
Shirt."
The U.S. Postal Service also got
in on the action with various com
memorative Gorby cachets, post
cards and holographs.
The cachets featured a portrait
of Gorbachev either plain or in
red ink and were stylistically con
sistent with other official
mementos. Some 7,500 cachets
were printed.
