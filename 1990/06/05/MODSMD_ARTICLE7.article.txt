## For a common goal 
### 
Concept of perestroika
reaches beyond
national boundaries

AS STANFORD brings its
first 100 years to a close, a
historic visit from the "man
of the decade" offers us new ideas
and insights for the future.
The leaders of the United States
and the Soviet Union, as well as
thousands of citizens across the
country, met this week for a free
exchange of ideas.
And although Mikhail Gorba
chev returned to his native country
last night, the ideas remain.
The concept of perestroika has
captured the interest and imagina
tion of people throughout the
world. Its relevance reaches beyond
national boundaries.
perestroika means a restructur
ing of all levels of society. It
depends upon the creativity and
ideas of each individual working
together for the benefit of all.
perestroika is a call for people to
unite in order to achieve a common
goal: creating a world where every
human being will live a worthwhile
life.
One of the major problems
facing the United States is declin
ing involvement in the political
process. Only one-third of the
eligible voting population is ex
pected to vote in the upcoming Cal
ifornia elections. Even Stanford,
whose students are "the best and
the brightest," exhibits a relatively
low level of civic awareness and
political participation.
The need for perestroika, both
within our national boundaries
and on our own Stanford campus,
is painfully evident.

In the Stanford community, new
ideas need to be explored that will
tap into the creative energy of the
student body and involve people in
charting the direction of the Uni
versity.
Gorbachev speaks about how a
new world order can come into
being: "I had an idea â€” an idea
to change our society on the inside
and also to change what was going
on ouside, around our country, and
to do so on the basis of new
realities," he said yesterday in
Memorial Auditorium.
We all have a responsibility to
develop and discover appropriate
ideas for our reality.
Within the Stanford community,
people need to exercise glasnost
and speak openly about ideas for
shaping and living in the changing
world. For a new type of progress
to become a reality, everyone must
change.
In addressing the challenges of
the present age, perestroika follows
the same road as multiculturalism.
Both recognize the interconnec
tions around the world. Both are
ideas that move toward creating a
new world order where all cultures
are valued and respected.
In a symbolic gesture yesterday,
University President Donald Ken
nedy offered Gorbachev a poster
inscribed with the words of Alex
ander Pushkin, the famed Russian
poet. The gift expressed an appre
ciation of the cultures of people of
color, for Pushkin was a Russian
who was also a black man.
The dialogue between Stanford,
a leader in multiculturalism, and
the Soviet Union, the international
leader of perestroika, needs to con
tinue.
At the same time, with the par
ticipation of all members of the
Stanford community, our visions
for our own university and nation
can move toward a reality.
