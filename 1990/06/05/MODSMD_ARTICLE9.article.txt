## Stories yet to be told 
### 
I HAVE A STORY to tell.
Audre Lorde said "Love and speak
with courage, with the knowledge
that we were never meant to survive."
Black people. Gay people. We were never
meant to survive.
I have a story to tell.
My story is about courage and knowl
edge and survival. If I didn't tell my
story, don't you know that I would die.
I have a story to tell and I'm going to
tell it the way I want to tell it. I'm going
to use my own language, with and with
out a motherf— in' copula. Girlfriend. I.
Ain't. Done. Testifyin'. Is. Ya'll. Shit! (Z
snap!)
I have a story to tell.
My story is the story of Bigger Thomas,
Pecola, Walter Lee and Clay Williams. Of
being a "nigger," "tar baby," "spook" and
an "Uncle Tom." Of being a shade too
dark and a little too nappy-headed. Of
being perceived as ugly just because I
didn't have blonde hair and blue eyes.
I have a story to tell.
My story is the story told by Rosa
Parks, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tub
man, Crispus Attucks, Frederick
Douglas, Martin Luther King Jr., Mal
colm X, Marcus Garvey, Fanney Lou
Hamer and countless other Black folks
that didn't make the history books.
I have a story to tell.
My story is enriched by the stories of
the beautiful and courageous Black gays
and lesbians who've gone before me, in

cluding James Baldwin, Alvin Ailey,
Patrick Kelley, Pat Parker, Joseph Beam,
Ma' Rainey, Bessie Smith, Bayard Rustin,
Gladys Bentley and countless others
who've been closeted by time and custom.
I have a story to tell.
My story is about history and culture.
About a history and culture so beautiful
and so powerful that it can't be captured
by a lowercase "b." About a history and
culture that is constantly being ap
propriated by white America, while at
the same time I am told I don't have a
history or culture.
I have a story to tell.
My story is about a journey. A personal
and cultural journey I thought I would
never survive. A story of alienation, des
peration and planned suicide attempts.
A story of not being Black enough, and
then being too Black, and finally becom
ing comfortable with who and what I am.
I have a story to tell.
My story is about love and happiness.
About a man loving, wanting and needing
another man. Of two men sharing mind,
body and soul. About kisses and hugs
from Michael. Of jammin' times at The
Box and Bella's.
I have a story to tell.
My story is about fear. About late-night
death threats. Of scared "men" threat
ening to kill me. Of losing old friends.
Of not being able to make new ones. Of
growing tired to the point where I don't
care anymore.

I have a story to tell.
My story is about Black Women. About
beautiful Black women with big booties,
big hips and big lips. About momma, sis
and granny. Black Women who didn't let
any man beat them down. Black women
with power — the power to write and
tell their own stories.
I have a story to tell.
My story is about living in a world
that is divided between black and white.
About Bensonhurst, Howard Beach and
South Africa. About "First Worlds" and
"Third Worlds." Of wondering if Black
people will ever be free.
I have a story to toll.
My story is about making new friends.
About good times with Bob, Dave and
Anne. Of not having to play white to be
liked. Of fun times with Mustafa,
Valquita and the TV Crew. Of being Black
to the fullest degree. Of getting to know
John Patrick and late night talks with
Steve. Of trying to build a truly multi
cultural society that is based on respect
for differences in race, religion, sex and
sexual orientation.
I have a story to tell, and I wanna
thank y'all for letting me share it with
you.
