For the record
In last Friday's Daily, a quar
ter-page article profiled Don
Kennedy's "charming, poised
and quick to smile" step-aaugh
ter, Cameron Hamill, and her
plans to attend Harvard in the
fall. The Daily mistakenly
thought that anyone would give
a rat s ass.
In Corey Davis' column last
week, Corey made no reference
to ethnicity or sexual orienta
tion. This was an error.
Alex Grant s column last week
was interesting. This too was an
error.
