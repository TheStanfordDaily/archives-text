LIGHT BULBS
How many LRS members does it take
to screw in a light bulb?
What light bulb?
Three But no one knows who they are.
Well, even if there was a lightbulb,
which there isn't, why should it be in
sulting to imply that the League mem
bers would be the ones who would be
hardest workiers and actually go and
change it?
One. But that person don't know it is
being changed
Four. But they're not sure of the watt
age and can't contact their superiors to
find out for sure.
