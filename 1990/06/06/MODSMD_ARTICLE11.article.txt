# New Chappie mocks Daily
## Imitation not necessarily flattery, says new Old Boy 
### Di S. Claymor Staff writer 
"Now that I'm in charge around here,"
declares David Hyatt, the brash and
ambitious new Editor-in-Chief of the
Stanford Chaparral, "things aren't going
to be that much different.'
For starters, says Hyatt, the Chappie
is publishing this parody of the Stanford
Daily.
"The Daily will be pretty ticked off, but
so what? Why publish a humor maga
zine but for that very reason?" explains
Hyatt, an undeclared sophomore in po
litical science. "But don't forget about
all those young, nubile humor magazine
groupies..."
The Stanford Chaparral is Stanford
University's humor magazine, founded
in 1899. Its latest endeavor, this parody
issue, is distributed in Daily boxes and
dormitories around campus.

"The trickiest part of this parody was
the advertising," says Hyatt. "To make
this look like the Daily, we needed to
include most of the same ads. Luckily,
when we called the Daily's advertisers,
they were enthusiastic about the idea
and gave us permission to use their
usual Daily ads."
Research by the Daily has found
Hyatt's assertion to be true; indeed, every
Dailv advertiser had given permission
for their display to be included. So don't
be a smarty-pants and go calling your
lawyers.
"Actually, we didn't get permission for
those little 'Give Blood' and 'Don't Fart
in an Elevator' public service messages,"
adds Hyatt. "We put those in because
we're good people who also happened to
need space filler.
"Besides, if anyone sued us for all we
were worth, they'd wind up taking a
loss."

In the past, the Chaparral has found
itself in trouble for publishing issues of
questionable taste. Does Hvatt have
any fears about putting out this issue?
"We did try to tone down the dirty stuff
because this issue would be distributed
so widely. There might be the occasional
shit' here and there in this issue, but
then again, the Daily is always full of
that stuff."
Hyatt ascended to the "Old Boy-ship"
in April, following in the footsteps of
now-reallv-Old-Boy Victor Payan. Payan
was best Known for being Hispanic.
Although he claims no gift for story
telling, Hyatt recalls that the funniest
thing ne ever saw was when two Daily
editors were softly tossing an orange
back and forth. "By the time they were
done, the orange was soft and mushy! I
was rolling on the floor in a dervish of
crazed and maniacal laughter."
Guess you had to be there.
