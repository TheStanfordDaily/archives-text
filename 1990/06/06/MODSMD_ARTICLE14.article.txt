Berlin Unemployment
Runs High
BERLIN (AP) — Unemployment in Berlin
hit a ten-year high as glasnost and German
re unification take their toll on the espionage
and spy-novel writing industries here.
Publishing experts say that Berlin resi
dents are overreacting to the recession. "There
are still other villains to spy on," said one.
Colombian drug lords. Fascist dictators and
blood-thirsty insurgents in underdeveloped
nations. Big, high-tech corporations. With
these new chances coming in Europe, keep in
mind that anytning coula happen. I always
tell my writers, the sky's not the limit— Reich
for the stars!"
Vietnam Sells Rights
to Vietnam
HANOI (AP) — The Republic of Vietnam
today publicized an offer to three major Hol
lywood studios. By the terms of the deal, the
studios would agree to purchase all movie
rights to the Vietnam war, for an undisclosed
dollar amount. In return, Vietnam would
give the studios full permission to film all
movies set during the Vietnam war and lo
cated in Vietnam here in Vietnam itself.
"We're only asking for a modest sum," said
a spokesperson for Vietnam. He pointed out
that by so purchasing the movie rights the
studios would protect themselves for copy
right-infrigement lawsuits. "When you look
at the box office profits brought in by movies
like 'Rambo,' it truly is a small price to pay,"
he continued.
One Vietnamese official, pleased with the
deal, commented that "imperialist American
movie studios have been infringing upon our
copyright on the war for years now." Trade
consultants in Los Angeles pointed out that
the influx of American movie-makers would
help revitalize the Vietnamese economy.
Another official said that the deal would
"lend that extra-special touch of authenticity
to Vietnam war movies. Our government
deplores the fact that many so-called Viet
nam war movies are now shot in Indonesia,
like' Casualties of War,' or even in England —
like Full Metal Jacket!"'
A studio executive, found on the Universal
back lot, would only comment, 'The horror!
The horror!"
Frees Die in Europe
BONN (AP) — Today more trees died in
Europe.
Communist Plot
Uncovered in USSR
MOSCOW (chA-P) —Kremlin officials were
briefly alarmed when word leaked out of a
Communist conspiracy to infiltrate all levels
of the government, society, as well as the bu
reaucracy.
The Supreme Soviet was hastily reconve
ned in an emergency session, where outraged
delegates railed against the plotters, calling
the communist system "outmoded" and "obso
lete." "I had thought we had eradicated Com
munism from the face of this planet," cried
one delegate, "except at American universi
ties!"
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
touring abroad, made plans to fiy back to
Moscow in response to the crisis, but canceled
them when everyone remembered that the
USSR had been communist since 1917.
Citizens, who wished to remain anony
mous, were shocked by the sudden reversion
to McCarthyist tactics. "Everyone going to
work was questioned, 'Are you, or have you
ever been, a member ofthe Communist party?'
until they started asking the police that same
question."
Oddly enough, only administrators and
students who had been recruited but who had

refused membership in the party acknowl
edged ever having heard of the Communist
Party.
However, Foreign Minister Eduard
Schevardnaze belittled the significance of the
sudden identity crisis, saying, "People simply
forgot that being communist was a main
stream thing, that's all."
Harvard
celebrates 700 th
CAMBRIDGE, MASS. (chA-P) — Follow
ing the lead of Britain's Eton College, which
recently celebrated its 550 th year of existence
several months before the anniversary of its
founding, Harvard University today cele
brated its 700 th birthday, several centuries
before the 700 th anniversary of its founding.
It easily makes me the longest-serving
university president ever,'' saidcurrent Presi
dent Derek Bok, who is due to retire nextyear.
When asked to explain the abrupt anni
versary celebration, Stanford University
President Donald Kennedy, a graduate of
Harvard College, said, "It's basically a length
thing. Harvard's used to being thought of as

the oldest, the best, blah blah blah. When
Eton went off and publicized its 550 th anni
versary, Harvard had to respond, even though
Eton's only a bloody prep school in England.
This way, Harvard regains its prominence as
the oldest educational institution, and so on,"
he explained. "It just comes down to your
measurements: how tall, how long, how big,
how thick you are." Gesturing at Hoover
Tower, he asked, "What do you think at
tracted me to Stanford?"
Bok concurred with Kennedv. Besides the
university's first president, Bok, who was an
undergraduate at Stanford, is the only other
1 larvard president who did not graduate from
Harvard College, and "hence, tne best."
Congress attempts
to break tax deadlock
WASHINGTON, D C. (AP) — After an
hours-long session, Democratic congressmen
announced that they had devised a way to
break the tax and budget deadlock.
Democratic Speaker of the House Tom
Foley explained to reporters. "It's simple. All
we have to do is pass a law declaring that

George Bush must go before the public and
announce that taxes nave to be raised." Party
leadership at Democratic headquarters were
reportedly pleased with the elegance of the
solution: with Bush's approval, Congress
could then increase taxes, with neither side
being hurt by public backlash.
No one officially stepped forward to de
scribe the penalties Busn would face for dis
obeying the directive, but several rumors
circulated in Washington circles.
One Democratic spokesperson, speaking
ofT the record, said that she felt that "Bush
should have plenty of ideas on how to put this
across to the public. He should look at what
political cartoonists are doing." She added, "If
he watched SNL he d probably have a good
idea how to say it."
