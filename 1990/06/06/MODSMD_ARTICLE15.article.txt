fat, leader ofthe Palestinian Liberation
Organization, annouced that the PLO
would begin pursuingactive operations
in Northern Ireland.
Mr. Arafat called this move a "diver
sification." Mr. Arafat cited that in
creased competition, largely from unin
corporated rock-throwing Palestinian
youths, had prompted a re-evaluation
of PLO policy.
"Government regulation of the
smaller rock-throwing businesses has
been unsuccessful; we've been forced
out by the upstarts," elucidated Arafat.

"The growing U.S. world hegemony
may be Bad news for the Soviet Union,
but it's opening up a boom market for
us," beamed a spokesman for one cell of
the Filipino Communist group. "This is
going to be a period of explosive growth

alone is raking in dynamite profits."
