# Canada split in twain as Quebec secedes

### 
QUEBEC CITY (AP)—The
French Providence of Quebec has
voted to break away from the
rest of Canada by the year 1992.
Brian Mulroney, Canadian
Prime Minister, was angered by
the vote. "Those arrogent
French. They're still think they
are the only civilized race on the
planet. We never should have
bailed them out during those
World Wars."
Oui," the French party that
campaigned for the split, was
delighted. "Now we can tell those
grimey limeys what we think of

them!"' said one frog. "We fart in
their general direction!'"
It is still uncertain what ef
fects the Canadian split will
have internationally. During
his afternoon power-walk, Presi
dent Bush dryly observed, "Now
let's hope those fucking Canuks
will be too busy to hassle us
about the acid rain bullshit.
That's off the record, of course."
Vice President Quayle, offi
cially speaking for the White
House, was unsure as to the
exact location of Quebec but as
sured press that "it is a place

with which we are concerned
and familiar, all the many ac
tively native Canadian-French
Canadians being of great inter
est to them."
Margret Thatcher issued a
formal statement urging re
straint in the matter. "We are
watchingtheevents unfold with
great caution. But if there's
anything we can do to help, just
let us know. I've got a few great
nephews who need 'copter train
ing but were too young for the
Faulklands."
A spokesman for the >Frpnch

government related that France
was pleased with the develop
ment and was prepared to rec
ognize Quebec as its own
sovreign power. One trade min
ister expressed excitement over
the new developments, saying,
"We're looking forward to new
trade talks ... in French." He
then proceeded to ramble on in
some unrecognizable foreign
gobbledygook.
It is unknown weither Can
