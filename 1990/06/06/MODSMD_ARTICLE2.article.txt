### Kimberly Ball Staff writer 
Kimball Hall, the 200-bed
dormitory planned for construc
tion on Escondido Road, is the
latest victim of budget reposi
tioning, according to University
Provost James Rosse.
In an interview with the Daily.
Rosse revealed that revised
budgetestimations indicated the
University must abandon the
Kimball Mall project.
"This was one of the hardest
decisions we've faced in the
entire process," said Rosse. "The
construction funds are sufficient,
but the long-term costs like
maintenance, heating, food serv
ice, and landscaping simply
cannot be met in this period of

budget con
straints," ac
cording to
Rosse.
Until now,
the University
had promised
that the Kim
ball Hall proj
ect, designed to
help guarantee
four years of

campus housing for all under
graduates, would be immune
from the budget cuts. "A revised
assessment of our financial po
sition, regrettably, has forced us
to rescind that promise," said
Rosse.
The revised estimations in
clude two million more dollars of
earthquake damage not included

in the original damage report.
Rosse emphasized that the
decision was "not etched in
stone." The public is asked to
commentregardingthe decision
by June 10, at which point the
decision will be finalized. "We
want to make sure the Univer
sity body understands why we
cannot go ahead with the proj
ect," said Rosse, who plans to re
spond to as many letters regard
ing the project as possible.
' We realize this will be a highly
unpopular decision, and it was
made with a heavy heart," said
Rosse.
The $10 million currently
slated to go toward construction
will be redirected toward the
project to build a retractable
dome over Stanford Stadium.
