# Congratulations

### 
ONCE AGAIN, the Daily offers
its congratulations to the
many NCAA and division
championship teams on the Farm,
including Women's Basketball, Base
ball, Women's Tennis, and Men's
Tennis. Your winning ways and
team spirit are an example for all of
us. On the field and court, as well as
in the classroom, you've all truly
lived up to the term "winners".
And as for those teams that have
n't won so much recently, such as
Cycling, Field Hockey, Wrestling,
Cross Country, Lacrosse, Crew, and
Football (to name only a few), we
have one message: get with the pro
gram, you jerks.
It's high time that Stanford's lesser,
floundering teams took after their
more successful counterparts. Five
years ago, the Women's Basketball
team won fewer than five games in a
season; this year they only lost one
en route to a national championship.
Five years ago, the tennis team be
gan a dynasty of NCAA dominance;
in that time, the football team has
only had one winning season. And a
crummy bowl game in Jacksonville,
Florida. What's more, we lost the
damned thing. Who wants to go to
Jacksonville? To lose? Not us, that's
for sure. We want Pasadena.

Most of these teams are hardly at
a loss for facilities. Stanford boasts
some of the finest training facilities
in the world. Maybe our athletes
can't find time to adequately train.
They probably just need to reassess
their priorities.
The Althletic Department needs
to reward the teams that excel. We
cannot understand how the athletic
department manages to trade 80+
Honda scooters for two or three
football wins a year. If the field
hockey team can t maintain a tradi
tion of consecutive NCAA champi
onship seasons, then Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger has every right to
fire their coach and slash their fund
ing.
The Daily's sports department has
written too many "they just came up
short" articles, too many "gave it
their best shot" tributes, too many
"rebuilding season" pieces. As our
own Cameron Mackey once said, "If
they're not going to win, to hell with
'em!" And he's right; we're sick and
tired of second-rate performances.
We deserve better. Much better.
As we see it, Stanford's molly
coddled sports teams have had it too
easy for too long. The message
should be clear: win or die.
