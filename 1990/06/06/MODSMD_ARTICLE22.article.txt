"Viewpoint" article of May 25 re
garding Mike Friedly's "League"
article of May 22, following up his
"Flier" article of May 18, concerning
Gordon Chang, a teacher previously
discussed by four students reacting
to the front page article in the
Stanford Review, which printed
alongside its "Maoist Cult" piece a
report on fraternities, the focus of
which was later attacked by Jay Jay
Kuo, later to be commented on oy
columnist Corey Davis, who sparked
controversy by glorifying "black
bootie," reviving discussions of how
to define offensive speech, feeding
into the Fundamental Standard
debate, a direct result of the
Beethoven flier incident, related to
the CIV curriculum changes, budget
cuts, and Webb Ranch controversy, I

have this to say: it's not good.

With outrage, I condemn the bla
tant attack perpetrated by the Daily's
exposd-style articals about alleged se
cret campus organizations. Our
anonymous members have the right
to remain free from harassment by ir
responsible newspaper reporters.
After all, this isn t tne Third Reich!
The witch hunt to discover which
professors belong to our organization
highlights just how ridiculous this
campaign has become. So what if
some Stanford faculty support our
agenda? They should be judged

solely on their academic performance,
not their personal politics.
Thanks to the Daily's yellow jour
nalism, our cause has been ridiculed.
Our goals of racial revolution and
true majority rule in America have
been seriously compromised. What
would our forefathers think?

On letters
In the spirit of true multicultural
ism, the Daily should stop discrimi
nating against certain letters and
begin to treat all letters equally. It
is unfair that e's, r's, and s's get used
so much more than, say, q's and z's.
All letters should be used with equal
frequency and all letters should be
treated equally.
In fact, some affirmative action

program may need to be put in place
through which we can make up for
the traditional discrimination
against q's and z's.
Furthermore, it is unfair that q's
must always be grouped with u's.
We must strive for greater diversity.
However, it may be uncomfortable
for q's to be suddenly grouped with
letters it is unfamiliar with. There
may need to be a theme section of
the paper where q's can be placed in
a comfortable environment to ease
the stress associated with being
thrust into a new situation.
Additionally, in the spirit of true
pluralism, the Daily should consider
tacking s's on to the ends of all
nouns.
