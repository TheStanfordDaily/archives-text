As I write this, I am choking in
anger. I arn writhing in disgust. I am
agnast with ire. My fingers shudder
with newfound fear. My ears pop in
utter abhorrence. I hiccuping in in
dignation. I make farty sounds with
my hand cupped under my underarm
in a demonstration of my wrath.
Inside, I deep-fat fry. My pulse
beats at a frenzied pace. My nose
hairs are curling of their own accord.
My heebies have jeebies on top of their
jeebies. But still, I must do my best to
keep typing through the tears, keep
wiping the dandruff from my brow,
keep fighting the dull, throbbing,
numbing, debilitating pain.
Once I thought Stanford would be
the place for me to grow without
fetters. I was believed that I would
be able to live here, to learn here, to
flourish and reproduce. But now I
shall never be able to regain that
original comfort, that innocent state,

that unborn nirvanna, that shielded
paradise that I had so long hoped for.
I thought the Daily, arbiter of truth
and justice, would use its influence to
squash all malevolence and preserve
the pristine state of affairs.
I am disappointed, disgusted,
disillusioned, and ... and ... oh, will the
madness never end?
