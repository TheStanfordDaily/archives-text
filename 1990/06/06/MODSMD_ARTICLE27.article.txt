## Mesquite-boiled year! 
### 
It's the end of yet another SCALDIN' year at Stanford, and looking back, it's
easy to get all fired up about some of the DEEPEST-FRIED happenings
this side of Hell!
Remember when RELEASE, Stanford's HOT entertainment weekly
premiered its first fashion supplement? My fingers were COVERED
with blisters after checking out all the HIP threads on some of Stanford's COOLEST
beatniks! And remember the searing, passionate, budget-conscious dining reviews in
RELEASE? We had an OUTRAGEOUS time going to all those restaurants, and I
know our HOT advertisers appreciated it, too! And how can anyone forget Samer
Hamadeh, radioactive RELEASE peon and ultimate PARTY FOOL OF THE
DECADF""hhhhh
So here s to all you party-goers! Like a magnifying glass focusing the sun's rays on a
lowly ant, may Tone "Have Nickname Will Travel" Vivona focus his camera on YOU
for PARTY FACES! Welcome the new super-fresh Prince of Fire Matt Hansen and
look forward to another CHARRED year 0f... HOT ... HOT ... HOT!!!!!!!!!!
Flushed with excitement,
