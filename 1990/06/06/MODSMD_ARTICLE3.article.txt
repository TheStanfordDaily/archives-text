# Another off-campus League is the cause of much intrigue
## 
### Mike "the Spike" Friedly Staff reporter 
A secretive nationwide organiza
tion called the LRS has been a little
known factor in student politics at
Stanford for several years, a Daily
investigation has found.
The League ofßhymingSentences
has been able to influence aspects of
campus life by placing its members
in leadership positions in the ASSU,
communities of color, staff positions,
and several a capella singinggroups.
The presence of the League hag
been responsible for dramatic ef
fects at Stanford. These range from
such innovations as the increased
usage of the catchphrase "Hey / Hey
/ Ho / Ho" to the growing presence of
poetic license in rhyming ("The stu
dents / united / will never be / de
feated").

Recruitment
The League finds prospective re
cruits in Freshman English and
Beginning Poetry classes. These
students are invited to the League's
Rhyming Shack," to "study and
snack." Students who are success
fully recruited by the League are
then able to further the League's
goals by running for student offices
and organizing student demonstra
tions. Successful candidates are also
invited to a large'banquet at which
older members of the League get
drunk and tell dirty limericks.
The League has been able to re
cruit students in a manner so secret
that the recruiters are unaware who
they are recruiting, or sometimes
even that they are recruiting at all,
according to several students who
said they thought they might have

been recruiting but had never, to
their knowledge, been recruited, and
were not members.
I used to be a regular student, you
know, with no particularly unusual
speech patterns," said Jill' the thrill"
Fillbert, a sophomore who wished to
remain anonymous. "Then I did
some snack' at the 'shack', and sud
denly it's Hey Hey' this, 'Ho Ho'
that, and an occasional 'There once
was a man from—'. It's really pretty
scary."
ASSU Influence
The League has considerable in
fluence in the ASSU, and many stu
dents are suspected to hold power in
both organizations. These include
such campus politicians as David
(ask me again and I'll knock va' down)
Brown, (hold the phone, it's) Douglas

Bone, (stop red baitin') Stacev
Leyton, Mike (please, more gruel)
Canul, Ingrid (Ingrid Ingrid Bo
Bingrid Banana Fanna Fo Fingrid
Me Mi Mo Mingrid Ingrid) Nava,
and J. Forrest Tucker.
Although there is no indication
that she has joined the League, COP
member Ingrid Nava's answering
machine did play the message: Hey
hey / Heep heep / Leave a message /
at the beep." Neither Nava nor her
answering machine were available
for further comment.
Police involvement
Stanford Police Captain Raoul S.
Niemeyer said that there was no
police interest in the LRS's activity:
Since they haven't committed a
crime, we shouldn't investigate at
this time." Later, he suggested off

the record that we drop the story,
leading us to suspecthim as a leader
of the LRS.
'Like a lackey'
One student interviewed revealed
that he had quit the LRS, saying
that he felt "like a lackey. They
would sit me down with a pencil and
paper and demonstrate against me
until I came up with cute little
rhymes. And they've got this in cred
ible group mentality; to them, the in
dividual is worthless. Remember
Self determination / for our educa
tion? That one was mine. Did I get
any credit for it? Of course not."
Another student expressed her dis
gruntlement with the LRS's narrow
agenda. 'They were focused too much
on rhyme and rhythm. They left no
room for prose, creative scansion, or
for any other alternative viewpoints."
