An exciting new book written
by Prof. Cameron Fowler of Stan
ford's History department is
challenging popular notions
about everyday life in medieval
Europe.
While most medieval scholars
believe that the average person
during the Middle Ages was poor,
starving, and liable to get his or
her head chopped offby passing
knights, Fowler contends in
Lives of Quiet Contentment that
life for the typical serf was actu
ally pleasant and secure. Many,
in fact, had achieved self-actu
alization.
As part ofhis research, Fowler
studied thousands of documents
in dusty archives across Europe.
"Their handwriting was pretty
bad, and they used stilted Eng
lish," he said from his office in
History corner. "But, compara
tively speaking, their lives were
superior to ours.
"Tl.ey didn't worry about

things like nuclear argameddon,
oral nygiene, or social mobility.
It was, for all intents and pur
poses, a heaven on earth. I sin
cerely wish I could have lived
back then."
Fowler, who holds a Nobel
Prize in Alchemy and is consid
ered the world's foremost expert
on phlogiston also relied on re
cently uneartned anthropologi
cal evidence that proves myo
pia, halitosis, and iron-poor blood
were virtually absentamongthe
hardy peoples.
Like his earlier, well-received
books Mysteries of the Bermuda
Triangle and The Secrets of Loch
Ness, Quiet Contentment is no
disappointment. Fowler weaves
a colorful tapestry with graceful
prose and lyrical accounts that
make history come alive.
In one scene, a family visits
town to enjoy a day at the gal
lows. In another, a group of
farmers sport drunkenly around
a windmill until onefalls,laugh
ing "like a hyena," into a well.
The close attention to detail in
Quiet Contentment is incredible.
However, the book has elic
ited crticism from some of
Fowler's colleagues.

"[Fowler] is a ... charlatan.
Everyone knows that life in the
Middle Ages was nasty, brutish,
and short," stated P. Jeff Welby,
professor of medieval history at
Harvard. "Those people lived
lives of quiet, desperate
pointlessness, not contentment."
Juanita Salinas, professor of
sociology at Berkeley, suggested
that Fowler's researcn was
flawed by "creative revisionism."
According to Salinas, Fowler is
a "pitiful fraud."
"I object to this character as
sasinationfrom theacademices
tablishment," responded Fowler
over the telephone. "My book is
openingnew frontiers in histori
cal analysis."
Despite the underhanded at
tacks by jealous critics, Quiet
Contentment is a definite must
buy for the well-educated Stan
ford student. It's also a great
gift for the history major who
thinks he or she knows it all.
Fowler succeeds in making all of
us pause and question what we
learn. Watch for his next book,
Black Plague! Exposing the Lie,
sure to be a best-seller.
