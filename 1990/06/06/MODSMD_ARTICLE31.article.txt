# The
						Bug delights again with more of his many witticisms

I was walking around campus yester
day. I bumped into an old friend of mine.
He said, "How are you doing?" I was glad
to see him, so to mark the occasion, I
turned to him and said something very,
very witty.
Ah, but enough of this gay banter.
Send your questions to the Bug (BUG
ME@Macbeth) or drop them on in the
box out front of The Daily! Or, if you're
really bored, come to the Dailv and take
all the Bug's questions out of the Bug's
box; it opens from the right side.
Dear Bug,
Explain the political events that led up
to the Scientific Revolution, as well as all
the implications for life and science in
the Twenty-first Century. Be sure to
include numerous examples from the

coarse reader and from lecture. You
have fifty minutes.
—Vernal Thomas Simon Smithson
I, too, have often wondered about the
word "bollard." I decided to look it up in,
a dictionary, to which you presumably
have no access:
bol*lard / 'bal-erd, Brit also -ard/ n
[perh. irreg. fr. bole] (ca. 1795) 1: a post
of metal or wood on a wharf around
which to fasten mooring lines 2: BITT 1
3 chiefly Brit : any of a series of short
posts set at intervals to delimit an area
(as a traffic island) or to exclude vehicu
lar traffic. (Webster's Ninth)
So there you have it! The bug comes
through once again.
Dear Bug,
I know you 're not the science bug, but
let's pretend you are for the purposes of

this parody. Can you please explain
how Van Der Waals forces work ? 1
really don't understand them.

Van Der Waals forces? I can answer
any question you have about science
and you ask me about piddling Van
Der Waals forces??
Come on, don't you want to know
why urine smells so weird after you eat
asparagus? Or why some pieces of shit
float and others don't? Or how fast
phlegm is moving when it flies out of
your mouth when you cough?
Do you mean to say thatyou'd rather
learn about Van Der Waals forces than
knowhowfastpubichairgrows? What
blister pus is made of? Trie origins of
dandruff? Where toe cheese and ear
wax comes from? Why some shits are
different colors than others? Why
people would want to put live gerbils

inside themselves? The world
record for continuous urination?
What it's like to gag on one's own
vomit?
Why bother with Van Der
Waals forces when there are so
many more wonderous and
mysterious discoveries to be
made out there? People like you
disgust me.
Until next week, the bug has
farted.
