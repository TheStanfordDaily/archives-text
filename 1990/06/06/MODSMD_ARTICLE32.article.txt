Shouting "We wantyour shoul
der pads, we wantyour shoulder
pads," a wild gn>up of Stanford
men raided all-women Roble
Hall in the last recorded instance
of shoulderpad-raiding at any
American university.
Panty-raiding as such was not
discovered by Stanford men un
til the next year, when one par
ticularly bright freshman ob
served that snoulderpads were
neither interesting nor kinky.
As a result of the incident, the
Zeta Beta lota fraternity was ,
placed on probation for the next
thirty years.

Wow! Imagine what they would
think of today's diaphragm
raids! Pretty weird.

A male Stanford sophomore
was rushed to the emergency
room of the Stanford Medical
Center early yesterday morning
where doctors removed a tennis
ball from his colon.
I really didn't think I was
going to get it up that far," said
a chagrined Scott Reed. "But
when it kept going deeper, I felt
like I just couldn't stop."
When asked why he tried the
stunt in the first place, the so
phomoric Reed replied,"lt was
pretty late. I was working on an
engineering problem set in my
room when I started playing witn
the tennis ball, you know, toss
ingitaround,bouncingitagainst
the floor, stuff like that. One
thing led to another and, we 11...1

guess I was in a weird mood. I
think it was all thatbau I had at
the Teahouse. Hey, what's in
those things anyway?"
The Teahouse had no com
ment.
Hey, if curiousity killed the cat,
then Scott was lucky to limp away
from that maneuver! Boy, I
wonder what kind of stunt he
would have pulled if he had
gotten the potstickers! Sticking
a tennis ball up his butt was
pretty stupid, even for the seven
ties. I mean, the biggest thing
I've ever shoved up my ass was a
golf ball, and 1 had mono!
Wow. Pretty weird.

A campus criminal was foiled
yesterday by a roving band of
teenage detectives, according to
Police chief Jose Oscarmever.
hil Hadley, a former Stanford
administrator, was arrested for
stealing computers from the
bookstore.
Hadley had stolen the the
computers while pretending to
be the ghost of Leland Stanford.
Hadley was booked and
charged on one count of robbery
and on one count of impersonat
ing the corpse of a railroad baron.
Wnen asked to comment on the
situation, a disgruntled Hadley

muttered,"My plan would have
worked if it wasn't for those
meddling kids."
The group of young private
eyes werelast seen drivingtheir
p-oovy floral-printed van to a
local pizza parlor.
As a much needed comical end
ingtoan evening oftension, the
group's large mumbling dog ate
all of another shaggy-haired
kid's pizza. The canine report
edly replied,"Rorry Raggy.
In a gut-wrenching display of
catharsis, all got a goocf, long
laugh. Later, the two known as
Fred and Daphne made out in
the back of the van.
Wow! Pretty weird.
