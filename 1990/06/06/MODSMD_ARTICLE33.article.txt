Cardinal wins Pac-10s
by a hefty twelve pushers.
That was a pretty big margin to
make up. I wasn't sure our guys
could come through, considering our
lack ofplayoff experience," said Stan
ford coach Karen Ploucquet.

Arid she wasn'tkiddingaboutinex
§erience. This year's curling team is
tanford's first ever, created thanks
to a large alumni donation earmarked
especially for that purpose.
Through the day's test match
against tne Bruins, the lead of twelve
pushers began to shrink.
First, freshman Jake Illych won
his harangue against number one
ranked Bruin curler Bob Slaminko.
In an exciting contest, Illych thrilled
the crowd with his deft jibbers and
adroit qailbaits. Slaminko fought
back in the lip of the match, posting
Illych with four blowpots, but the
talented freshman from Anchorage
took the match at the last moment
with an astounding six-ribbed mi
dofT.
Illych's victorious harangue set the
tone for the rest of the day's test.
Number two curler Jay Lozada put
away Bruin Deryck O'Brien with a

five-ribbed midofT and a post at the
edge. Number three curler Keith Orr
outlasted UCLA's Albert Chang in a
nail-biter, taking the contest in an
extra kilt tie-breaker, eleven poles to
four.
And when number four curler Alex
Williams put the finishing wimmy on
Bruin Chris White, the test was over
and Stanford was the Pac-10 cham
pion by a margin of two pushers, one
bonus.
"This [the victoryj says a lot about
our team. What we lack in experience
we really make up for with... with...
what was I saying?" said Couch
Ploucquet. "Plus, the wind really
helped our kiltering and the smooth
ice really lent itself to our style of pole
setting. '
The Cardinal will go on to the Na
tional NCAA Tournament to be held
in Honolulu in June.
