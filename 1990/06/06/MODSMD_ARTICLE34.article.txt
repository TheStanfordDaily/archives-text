# Christians Clubbed
## New cross to bear for ICBS 
### Joan Offarck Monsignor staff writer 
As a result of the recent University
cutbacks, Inter-varsity Christian
Bible Studies has been relegated to
Club Sport status. This change will
result in the elimination of road trips
and funding for team uniforms. The
cuts will also deprive the team of
scholarships and will halve the
number of ICBS recruiting scouts.
These latest blows capped a frus
trating year. Not only did the team
show poorly at the Pac- 10s, but there
were also a number of disagreements
over recruiting philosophies. Said
one team memoer, "The scouts found
alotofhotnew talent, but most ofthe
kinds were Jewish!"
Additionally, the Bible Studies
tourney was rocked by rule changes.
"It was a real mess," said the team's
coach, John Paul Peter Matthew Luke
Friendly. "Fistfights broke out when
we contended that the Bible's words
transcended the fallacious interpre

tations of temporal human agen
cies." Friendly was hit with three
technicals for using the Lord's name
in vain during the spat.
Many team members said they
were most dismayed by the elimina
tion of road trips. "In the past, we
went to tournaments in places like
Salt Lake City and Heritage Park
U.5.A.," said team member uurnsey
Blansey. "It's refreshing to visit a
place full of intense religious fervor,
even if the inhabitants belong to a
sect of Christianity that you feel is
so blasphemous and heretical that
every last one of its followers should
be annhilated from the face of the
planet."
Meanwhile, freshman Augustine
Santillas said that he would miss
the uniforms the most.
ICBS president Chris Chin was
downcast about the cuts. "Th is never
would have happened if Jesus had
gotten in to Stanford. Unfortunately,
ne got nailed on the boards."
