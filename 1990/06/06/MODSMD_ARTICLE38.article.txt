# Cheerleader OK after freak golf accident
## 
### Debbie Spoho Sports editor 
Surgeons at Stanford Children's Hos
pital operated for two hours last night to
remove a 9-iron golf club from the fore
head of Stanford yell-leader Tiffany
Rotweiller. As of midnight, she was
expected to survive, although doctors
were unsure whether her brain function
would be significantly reduced.
Rotweiller was injured by a golf club
which slipped from the hands of Bob
Smith, a member of the Stanford golf
team. Witnesses say that the yell-lead
ers, who were cheering along the fair
way as Smith attempted a difficult chip
shot, were attacked by Smith shortly
after he shot into the bunker. "We were
just cheering, you know," said yell-leader
Stacy Olsen, "and he blew the shot,
ripped off his hat and came after us."
Smith told police "those pinheads
wouldn't be quiet when I was trying to
shoot. They just went on with their
stupid cheers. When I saw I was in the
sand trap, something snapped in my
head ana I don't know what happened
next... I guess ... I guess I was trying to
kill her or something."

The attack was the latest setback for
the cheerleading squad, which was cre
ated under the aegis of the Athletic De
partment in April. In an effort to warm
up for football season, the squad has
been instructed to cheer for every team
competing this quarter.
Four cheerleaders were treated and
released for minor injuries sustained on
May 15 when they inadvertantly caused
a 12-bike collision at a cycling meet by
forming a human pyramid on the track.
Another two cheerleaders almost
drowned May 29th in an ill-advised
attempt to cneer for the synchronized
swimming team from two small row
boats.
Spectators at yesterday's golf match
said that the cheerleaders had been
yelling "Put it in, put it in, put it in in, in
in in, in in in in!' just before Smith at
tacked them. Other cheers included
"three hundred yards / it ain't that far /
we'lL still end up / under par" and "ay,
putter, putter, ay, putter, putter, putter,
swing!"
The surviving cheerleaders are set to
debut before the general public at the
first home football game next Septem
ber.
