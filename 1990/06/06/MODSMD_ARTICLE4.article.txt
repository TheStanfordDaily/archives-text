# Recall votes are in: the C.O.P. is out
## New elections slated for next fall 
### Brent Biglie Staff writer 
The results are ir\, and "Four
Our Future" C.O.P. has been
recalled from office by a student
vote of 1012 to 532. A new elec
tion will be held next fall to
determine the 1990-91 ASSU
Council of Presents.
Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss was pleased with the
voter turnout, but was disap
pointed that new elections will
have to be run, at a cost to the
Association of over $8,000. "I'm
a little surprised," said Krauss.
"I knew there was a lot of disap-
Eointmentoverthe lastelections,
ut I didn't think that over one
thousand students would getout
to vote, especially without a fee
refund."
Two thirds of the votes cast
were needed to remove the
C.O.P. from office. Krauss said
that over fifty of the votes cast
were improperly marked with
write-in votes and could not be
counted in establishing a ma
jority. "I just hope this doesn't
start another controversy,"
quipped Krauss. "That's all I
need right now."
Many People's Platform sup
porters were upset about the
election result. "It's an outrage!"
charged Vince Ricci, former
People's Platform senator. "I
can't believe the students went
and did this. The question on
the ballot must have been mis
leading."
Louis Jackson, another former
People's Platform senator,
agreed. "There's no way the
Senate will certify the results".
Students First party, how
ever is delighted with the
results. Tim Marklein, who ran
for COP with Students F*irst in
April, said "This is a great ex

ample of democracy in action.
They should have named the
slate Four Hour Future."'
Mike Canul, another Students
FirstC.O.P. hopeful, was excited
about the results. "Hopefully,
we can win in the fall. Then it
wouldfinally beourturn tobleed
the students dry."
Members ofthe "Four Our Fu
ture" slate are understandably
dismayed. "This just isn't fair,"
says Jay Tucker, one of the
removed C.O.P. "Now I have got
go and change my resume."
Perhaps the most outspoken
about the results was Ingrid
Nava, former and ex-current
C.O.P. member. "This is com
pletely unfair -- we didn't even
get a chance to serve. You would
think I was caught embezzling
funds or something."
When asked if her alleged
membership in the secret Marx
ist-Leninist League of Revolu
tionary Struggle may have con
tributed to tne C.O.P.'s defeat,
Nava stated emphatically, "Ab
solutely not! Everyone knows
the League is no big secret. Why
should it be? Besides, I never
even heard of it."
Stacy Ley ton, a former
People's Platform C.O.P. mem
ber, senator, and Dean's Service
Award recipient, was equally fu
rious. "This is all the doing of
that conservitive with a mo
hawk, Perry Friedman. I hope
he's happy.'
And what does Perry Fried
man, the ASSU protester* and
recall activist, have to say? "I'm
happy," says the leader of Stu
dents United for Fair Elections.
I'm very happy. This has made
my day."
The new elections this fall are
open to any new slates who might
wish to run.
