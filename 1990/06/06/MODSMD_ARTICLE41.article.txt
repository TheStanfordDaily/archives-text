Bowling Alley Returns
The Tresidder Union bowl
ing alley, removed six years
ago to make room for com
puter facilities, will be rein
stalled next year.
The Tresidder Union Space
Committee voted 7-2 last night
to construct a 8-lane bowling
alley in the empty space adja
cent to the Tresidder Recrea
tion Center. The space was
made available when comput
ers were moved to the second
floor AlRport.
Construction on the project
will begin in July, with com
pletion scheduled for early
September. The new facility
will cost approximately
$600,000 and will include
state-of-the-art computer scor
ing machines and new high
fashion bowling shoes.

Stanford Receives Bid
For Entire Campus
Citing Stanford's "interna
tional reputation forresearch-,
development, and number one
good time family fun," the

Mariumika Corporation of
Japan yesterday placed a bid
to buy the university for eighty
billion dollars.
The company says it is espe
cially attracted by the Rodin
sculpture garden, the golf
course, and Stanford's dedi
cation to multiculturalism.
President Kennedy said the
trustees were carefully con
sidering the offer.
"This is a great opportunity
for us to get out of the educa
tion business for good," said
Stanford Merchandizing Di
rector Richard Rich.
