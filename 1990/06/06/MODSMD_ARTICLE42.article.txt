### Vincent Van Stop Staff art critic 
In the spirit of peace and global unity,
four Stanford students presented
Mikhail Gorbachev (or his double) with
works of art during his Monday visit to
the Stanford Art Gallery.
The first work given to the Soviet
President was a photograph by fresh
man Leslie Smitn. "Hang in There,
Baby!", a 6-by-4 foot color photograph of
a kitten hanging from a small branch,
was intendedas a vote of confidence for
Mr. Gorbachev," explained the fresh
man from Cedro. "It says, 'Don't give
up! You're doing great!'"
"Frowny the Clown", a touchingpaint
ing on black velvet, depicting a clown
with a tear rolling down its cheek, was
the next work given to Mr. Gorbachev.
"It's an indictment of war and the hor
rendous pain and suffering which it
causes," said artist Rosa Salazar, an un
declared junior.
The third offering, an untitled enamel
by senior Tom Phanco, was described by
its artist as a "pictorial essay of peace
and friendship." A depiction of a group
of dogs smoking cigars and playing poker,
the painting represents what the artist
calls "a vision of a global community
living in harmony."
The final piece given to the Soviet
president was a drawing of the the back
of someone's head, by artist Franny
Sundstrom, simply entitled, "CIV class."
President Gorbachev warmly received
the works of art, exclaiming that he
couldn't wait to hang them up in the
Royal Basement.
