# Review bites the big one, at last
## 
### Chris Adamson 5th-year Senior Staff Writer 
After a brief history of contro
versy, alienation, IM sports, and
substandard editing, the editors
of the conservative Stanford Re
view have decided to give up the
ghost.
In their aborted final issue,
the editors intended to refer to
an "ongoing campaign of har
assment, misquotation and
mockery" as the cause for their
decision to leave the realm of
campus publishing. The cover
of the planned issue featured a
drawing that appeared to be a
pair of slit wrists, although it
could also be interpreted as a
map of Tucson, AZ or perhaps
even a chemical diagram for
Twinkies.
The final editorial claimed that
the magazine has been "forced
out of business due to lack of
funds." "Advertisers are intimi

dated by the "Looney Left" into
not buying any of our plentiful
advertising space," said Adver
tisingManagerGideon Yu. Busi
ness staffer and ocassional psy
chotic John Abbot told the Daily
"those slimeballs in the League
of Super-Friends or whatever
are behind this, I just know it.
Dude! Box! Man!"
When interviewed by the
Daily, Editor-in-Chief Kather
ine Hemela said that the Re
view's termination was mostly
the result of "a massive short
ace of red ink for our cover page."
Sne said that the editors were
faced with the decision of chang
ing the distinctive, retina-sear
ing red cover in favor of a more
modest black-and-white alter
native. "They all said they'd
rather be red and dead," quipped
Hemela.
The first indication of the Re
view's trouble was when the
magazine failed to print any

issues after the April 30th "Bart
Simpson ASSU Special."
Daily News Editor Janine De
Fao, in a curious stupor on the
night of May 12, said "I'd be in
seventh heaven if the slimy bas
tards finally got the message
that everyone nates them." De
Fao, in an interview yesterday,
said that she did notbelieve that
quotes made at that time were
on the record.
Smaller publications saw the
Review's demise as a mixed
blessing. Former Release pub
lisher Don Lee said thathe would
miss the Review, adding "they
were the only magazine capable
of making us look good by com
parison. Mike Chen, editor of
Dial Tone, simply said "we've
got dibs on their hard-disk space
and that's that."
A viking funeral for the un
used4o,ooo copiesofthe Review
will be held tomorrow in the
Lagunita lakebed.


An exhibition by controversial photographer Robert Maplethorpe will be displayed
at the Stanford Art Museum from today until June 10. This work, entitled "Butt Naked",
is one of the featured photographs.
