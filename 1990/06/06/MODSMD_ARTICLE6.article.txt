## Misha meets Manley 
### Kay G. Bei staff writer 
Following the visit of Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev on Monday, it was revealed that the man who met
with University President Donald Kennedy and spoke on
campus was actually a Gorbachev double.
According to top Soviet advisors, President Gorbachev
decided not only to skip a tour of the Hoover Institute, but
to change his Bay Area itineraiy altogether. To avoid an
international incident, KGB officers scrambled to find
someone who could adequately stand in for him.
While the look-a-like greeted Don Kennedy, accepted
gifls from the Stanford Art Museum, toured the Quad,
and spoke at Memorial Auditorium, the real Gorbachev
lurked at the Palo Alto Creamery with good buddy and
pen pal Professor John Manley.
Tne President had a wonderful time with Comrade
Manley," said an advisor. He was very pleased to receive
the letter inviting [Gorbachev] to join [Manleyl at the
Creamery instead of touring the archives."
Yeah, we had a real harasho time," said a euphoric
Manley.
Apparently, the two chums wreaked havoc on the
Medical Center by prying open the eyes of cadavres and
crazy gluing bedpans to geriatric patients.
The pair then stole several traffic signs
and broke open the display case at the El
Camino Kentucky Fried Cnicken to swipe
the statue of the Colonel.
There was no commentfrom Gorbachev s
advisors or the KGB about the incidents.
Several sources claimed to have seen
Gorbachev partying in the evening at the
U.N. in downtown Palo Alto (see picture).
He was last seen dancing the Lambada
with Manley.
Hoover officials had no comment about
any of the day's events.
