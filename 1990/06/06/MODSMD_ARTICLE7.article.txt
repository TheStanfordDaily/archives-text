# Another flier rocks campus
## 
### Tom Teller Staff writer 
Only weeks after inflammatory fliers attacking Asian-
American scholar Gordon Chang were removed from
campus, a new round of damaging and anonymous fliers
has appeared.
The Daily will not legitimate the allegations made in the
flier by reprinting it or bv even repeating its content.
Students were shocked and outraged by the flier. Many
said that the piece of paper could setnack certain agendas
bv vears.
