Price-fixing investigation
While investigating charges of
price fixing at several top univer
sities, the U.S. Department of Jus
tice requested detailed financial
information dating back to 1985
from Stanford.
* By February, Stanford had
complied, compiling tens of thou
sands of pages of documents, a
40-foot-tall stack.
- At least 50 schools have re
ceived similar requests to provide
information on tuition, salaries
and financial aid packages. There
Js nothing unlawful about ex
changing information on these
subjects, but exchanging them
with the purpose of making a for
malized agreement constitutes a
Violation of antitrust laws.
* Twenty-three of the schools un
der investigation belong to the
Overlap Group which meets reg
ularly to discuss salaries, tuition
and financial aid. The group's
purpose is to prevent bidding wars
for top students by offering
similar tuition and financial aid
so students choose institutions
based on merit and not cost, mem
bers say.
Stanford has "explicity refused"
to join the group, according to
University General Counsel John
Schwartz.
The Justice Department's re
quest includes information rang
ing from contracts, letters and
telegrams to speeches, conversa
tions and computer printouts.

Loma Prieta earthquake
A devastating earthquake shook
the Bay Area, causing as much
as $160 million in damage to ac
ademic buildings and residences
at Stanford.
The so-called Loma Prieta

earthquake, which registered 7.1
on the Richter Scale, was the lar
gest in the area since the 1906
temblor that destroyed much of
San Francisco.
The earthquake, centered just
north of Santa Cruz, caused ex
tensive damage throughout the
Bay Area, including the collapse
of a section of the Bay Bridge and
the crumbling of a stretch of In
terstate 880 in Oakland, causing
dozens of deaths.
Although there were no serious
injuries at Stanford, hundreds of
students were displaced as Bran
ner Hall was closed overnight for
a gas leak, and four Row houses
were closed for the remainder of
the year because of damage to the
foundations.
Stanford faculty and adminis
trators were turned away from
their offices as many buildings in
the Quad were closed. Many sci
entists lost weeks of research as
the quake overturned their labo
ratories.
The University quickly erected
three temporary modular com
plexes to house offices and class
rooms damaged by the earth
quake and relocated students
whose houses were temporarily
closed.
Roble Hall and the Lou Henry
Hoover House, which had just
opened after undergoing construc
tion to make it more safe in an
earthquake, survived the temblor
with no major damage.
NOV, 29
Louis Jackson saga closes
Junior Louis Jackson was sen
tenced to a six-month probation
period and 70 hours of community
service for his role in the May 15,
1989, takeover of Unviersity Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's office.
Jackson's sentencing ended a
five-and-a-half month legal saga
during which the Black Student
Union and many others on
campus rallied behind Jackson,

claiming he had been unfairly sin
gled out for prosecution by the
district attorney.
Jackson originally faced six mis
demeanor charges, including in
citing to riot and battery. Four of
the charges against Jackson, in
cluding the two most serious,
were eventually dropped as part
of a plea bargain.
During the fall, Kennedy re
ceived a lot of heat from the BSU
for failing to intervene in Jack
son's case. Kennedy maintained
that it was not the University's
role to influence the legal process.
Jackson maintained after his
sentencing that his legal saga was
a small price to pay for furthering
multicultural goals at Stanford:
"I hope that this price is enough
to buy more black faculty, more
black courses and a greater com
mitment to the issues of multi
culturalism."
FEB, 8
Budget cuts
Facing a budget deficit for the
second year in a row and increas
ing gloom on its financial horizon,
the University announced a mas
sive $22 million slash in its op
erating budget.
Provost James Rosse said the
cut, to be made over 18 months,
was necessary because of a decline
in government-sponsored re
search, limitations on the student
tuition rate and indirect cost rate
for researchers, and the uncertain
nature of earthquake repair costs.
Rosse has since chaired a com
mittee that is working with Uni
versity departments to identify
budget cuts and "streamline" op
erations to eliminate overlap and
inefficient structures. Student Af
fairs was assigned a budget cut
of 15 percent; other departments,
such as Human Resources, faced
cuts of up to 30 percent.
The threat of staff layoffs has
hung over employees throughout
the process. Rosse announced that
150 to 200 University employees
would likely lose their jobs, and
those who did not find other jobs
in the University would be laid
off, some as soon as Sept. 1.
The Athletics Department, also
facing poor financial prospects,
slashed several of its programs
beginning in February.
Women's field hockey, sailing
and wrestling were all dropped
from varsity to club sports, and
25 full scholarships for track and
field athletes were cut. Athletic
Director Andy Geiger also an
nounced that eight to 10 admin
istrative and support staff posi
tions in the department would be
cut.
Meanwhile, Stanford Hospital
was having money troubles of its
own. The hospital announced a
$27 million budget cut Jan. 12
because of increased operating
costs and lower than expected oc
cupancy levels.
The announcement was fol
lowed by a 7 percent rate hike
effective March 1 and the April 5
announcement that at least 100
hospital employees would be laid
off.
MARCH t2
Hospital nurses' strike
Senior-level nurses at Stanford
Hospital became the highest paid
in California, receiving $25.42 per
hour, after the nurses' union
ratified a new two-year contract
with University.
The agreement came after a
weeklong strike threat and several
standstills in the negotiations be
tween the nurses' union, the Com
mittee for Recognition of Nurses'
Achievement, and the hospital.
Tensions were so high that two
federal mediators were called in
to facilitate negotiations.
Three issues were debated in

the dispute:
• A two-tiered wage system in
which new nurses received larger
increases than more experienced
nurses;
• A proposed decrease in nurse
patient ratio; and
• Mechanisms by which nurses
could petition for consulting with
a nursing manager when required
to perform procedures they
believed unsafe for patients.
The new contract maintained
the two-tier system, with first
year increases set at 10.5 percent
for entry-level nurses, 8 to 9 per
cent for mid-level and 7 percent
for senior nurses. Second-year in
creases were set at 7 percent
across the board.
The nurses accepted the con
tract because they believed it did
not compress the wage scale
enough to diminish incentives for
nurses to stay at the hospital.
There was a mutual agreement
on the use of joint conferences
between union representatives
and management to address staff
ing limits and mechanisms for
filing nurses' complaints about
procedures jeopardizing patient
safety.
APRIL 4
Webb Ranch agreement
In a historic breakthrough after
a year of deadlocked negotiations,
Webb Ranch and the United Stan
ford Workers signed a five-year
contract for ranch workers.
The contract was signed a year
after ranch workers voted to uni
onize with the USW to gain sup
port in the controversy over
workers' living conditions.
The agreement, approved 23-1
by ranch workers, provided for
increased wages, recognition of
seniority in hiring and layoffs and
greater influence for the workers
in decisions of what crops to plant.
The most important provision
in the contract from the stand
point of the workers was an agree
ment to turn control of the
housing units over to the workers.
Under the new contract, rent will
be collected by a tenant corpora
tion composed entirely of workers
and would be used to fund im
provements in the housing units.
Such a provision for worker
control of housing had never
before been included in an agricul
tural contract, according to union
officials.
Housing had been the most
divisive issue in the negotiations
between ranch officials and the
USW since November 1989, when
Webb Ranch threatened to elimi
nate the housing altogether.
Webb family attorney Terrence
O'Connor cited liability reasons

for the proposal to evict the
workers and offered up to $300
to each worker to resettle in the
area.
The deadlock in negotiation
ended less than a month after
University President Donald Ken
nedy issued a statement warning
Webb Ranch that the land leased
to the Webbs "may be put to ac
ademic use" if the controversy
was not settled.
The lease between Stanford and
Webb Ranch expired in August of
last year and was extended on a
month-to-month basis. The exten
sion was a "temporary arrange
ment" that could be ended if Webb
Ranch did not comply with "com
monly accepted standards for fair
and lawful agricultural employ
ment," according to the state
ment.
APRIL 5
Alcohol policy
University President Donald
Kennedy approved several revi
sions of Stanford's alcohol policy
just three months after they were
drafted. The new policy, which
prohibits alcohol at at all public
events in athletic facilities, went
into effect immediately.
The broadening of the proposal
to include more than just athletic
events was one change Kennedy
made before approving it.
Other restrictions adopted are:
• Alcholic beverages may not be
promoted or advertised at events
or in enterprises under the control
of the Department of Athletics.
This does not include programs
produced by the Pacific 10 Con
ference or radio or television
broadcasts of Stanford games.
• Persons convicted of driving
while intoxicated on the Stanford
campus are ineligible to receive a
parking permit for a year after
their conviction.
The fourth proposal, which
would have banned the purchase
of alcohol with University
collected fees, was dropped after
unfavorable community response.
In one of the first implementa
tions of "dorm democracy," the
ASSU polled students and found
79 percent were opposed to the
fourth proposal.
The recommendations were au
thored by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger and Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
They were drafted after what
some called the worst Big Game
in 15 years. Police had to don
helmets at halftime to protect
themselves from hurled rocks and
full cans of beer. They made 27
alcohol-related arrests that day.

APRIL 5
Stanford in 2010
Expressing his vision for Stan
ford's second century, University
President Donald Kennedy called
for a rededication of faculty to
teaching over research to a packed
crowd at Kresge Auditorium.
"It is time for us to reaffirm
that education — that is, teaching
in all its forms — is the primary
task, and that our society will
judge us in the long run on how
well we do it," Kennedy said.
The speech marked a decided
shift in the University's lack of
emphasis on teaching. The Fac
ulty Senate in May followed
through with proposals that al
tered the tenure process to bring
researchers down from an
elevated status over teachers.
In his speech, Kennedy also
called for a streamlining of the
University's bureaucracy, which
threatens "a feeling of collegiality,
a pace that is hospitable to reflec
tion, an informal kind of contact
with one another."
Kennedy said the University
would announce budget cut tar
gets, but added "the pruning
shears have yet to close on a single
twig."
The speech was "emotionally
uplifting and studded with hints
and ideas a manager can use,"
said Ewart Thomas, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. "Kennedy is required
reading."
Rut some faculty members crit
icized Kennedy for an apparent
contradiction between the goals
outlined in his speech and the
massive budget cuts.
"You can't cut that sort of
money by making yourself more
efficient," said Education Prof.
Denis Phillips. "It's not going to
add up."

ASSU elections
The year's over, and so, say the
pollsters, is the 1990 ASSU elec
tion.
This was the year of the never
ending election, one in which the
controversy was so high that more
than 2,000 students signed peti
tions demanding a recall election
to remove the victorious People's
Platform Council of Presidents
slate from office.
So controversial was their slim
victory and the subsequent after
math that nearly two-thirds of
those voting in the recall election
asked for an ouster before they

damage to Stanford was estimated to be $160 million.
