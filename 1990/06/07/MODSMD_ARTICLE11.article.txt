even Bet foot into the COP office.
Shrouded in the controversy
was the ultimate in ASSU silli
ness. Bart Simpson, the popular
cartoon "dude," was voted into
office as a graduate senator.
Simpson declined the position,
but before he could, Elections
Commissioner Steve Krauss made
himself an instant celebrity on
campus by tossing out all write-in
votes in the election. Simpson was
upset and so were the "Nurk
Twins" and the "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles," who also received
write-in votes. He declared them
to be incorrectly marked ballots,
thus making it impossible for a
run-off election.
Krauss's decision would hardly
cause a stir among the apathetic
voters, but Perry Friedman, nor
mally a jokester, showed the
People's Platform that he meant
business. Feeling disenfranchised,
Friedman and dozens of cohorts
staged a two-week sit-in of the
ASSU offices, led a walkout of
the ASSU Senate when it voted
to certify the controversial elec
tion and pushed for the recall elec
tion.
The People's Platform has been
on the defensive for weeks as it
has been trying to rebuff these
blows. The four slate members
will take office next year under
the cloud of the recall election in
which about 63 percent of the elec
torate gave no-confidence votes.
At least it's over.

APRIL 30
Ohlone bones
In a precedent-setting case, the
University returned 300 skeletal
remains to members of the Bay
Area Ohlone tribe for reburial last
summer.
The decision that was carried
out in April, making Stanford the
first institution in the country to
return native remains, came after
nearly a year of debate over the
destiny of the 5,000-year-old
bones.
Several Ohlones asserted the
bones were sacred and study of
them was disrespectful. Other
Ohlones, however, believed the
bones should have continued to
be studied for historical and med
ical information.
Phillip Walker, an outside
anthropologist asked by the Uni
versity to conduct a report of the
bones' scientific value, concluded
the remains could be further
studied for archaeological, paleon
tological and medical purposes.
Research could shed light on spe
cific hereditary diseases in
modern people, he said.
There are an estimated 4,000
to 5,000 Ohlones living in the Bay
Area, but many are unaware of
their heritage; no full- or half
bloods are still living.
The return of the remains may
have pleased some, but many Oh

lones and scientists alike were dis
pleased with the decision. Anthro
pology Prof. Bert Gerow, who dis
covered the remains between 1959
and 1969, chastised the Univer
sity for the "loss of an irreplacable
collection."
Economics Prof. Kenneth Ar
row, representing 143 members
of the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors, called the Univer
sity's decision "basically flawed"
and questioned the "serious con
sequences" of giving up the re
mains.
MAY 24
Fundamental Standard
After a year of relative silence
about free speech, the Student
Conduct Legislative Council ap
proved a revised interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard that
outlaws discriminatory harass
ment.
The passage of the revision was
a First Amendment landmark for
Stanford. Students and faculty
had enthusiastically debated
merits and drawbacks of the pro
posal. The debate is being closely
watched by campus administra
tors across the country and is ex
pected to help spawn spinoff pro
posals at other schools.
The revised interpretation,
drafted by Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, calls for stringent limits on

what kind of speech is allowed on
campus. Students who intimidate
other students through violence
or threat of violence or who harass
students "on the basis of the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or na
tional and ethnic origin" will be

in violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
Supporters of the Grey proposal
argue that it is necessary to
punish and prevent discrimina
tory harassment and that the pro
posal is not a significant infringe
ment on the speaker's First
Amendment rights.
Opponents say the Grey pro
posal is a purely punitive, rather
than educational, proposal that
will restrict a student's freedom
of speech.
Because the U.S. Supreme
Court has not ruled extensively
on this aspect of speech, Grey
drew upon the 1942 ruling
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire to
shape his proposal.
JUNE 4
Gorbachev visit
In a whirlwind tour of Stanford,
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev met with students and fac
ulty and gave a historic speech in
Memorial Auditorium.
Thousands of students, staff
and faculty members thronged to
the Quad under tight security to
greet the Soviet leader. Gorbachev
was met there by University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, California
Gov. George Deukmejian and U.S.
Senators Alan Cranston and Pete
Wilson.
Gorbachev was then presented
with works of art from students
and two Bay Area artists in a
brief visit to the Art Gallery that

was cut short by Gorbachev's late
arrival.
In a speech to the Stanford com
munity that was televised nation
wide, Gorbachev declared the Cold
War to be over, saying "I believe
that all mankind is entering a new
age."
Gorbachev praised California as
the "Mediterranean of the fu
ture." Stressing the importance
of science and technology, Gorba
chev said "the ideas and technol
ogies of tomorrow are born here
in California."
The two-hour tour was marked
by hundreds of protesters who
demonstrated to give the Soviet
leader a different message than
the thousands of supportive mem
bers of the Stanford community
who lined his path. The protesters
included Lithuanians, Lativians,
Eritreans, Jews, Vietnamese and
numerous, other groups.
