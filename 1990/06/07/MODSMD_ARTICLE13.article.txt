## Editor's farewell 
### 
JUST MORE THAN four
months ago, I used this space
to assert that during my ten
ure as editor in chief, The Stanford
Daily would both question author
ity and question those who ques
tion authority — that The Daily
would harbor a healthy skepticism
toward all, and harbor a healthy
skepticism toward all who advise
us to harbor a healthy skepticism
toward others.
Taken as they were presented,
as abstract principles, what I of
fered was warmly endorsed by
many people of various ideological
stripes.
Over the course of the past four
months, it has become painfully
apparent that on this campus the
abstract doesn't always translate
too comfortably into the concrete.
; Perhaps of all the criticism The
Daily has received during my
'volume, the charge that troubles
! me most is that, by publishing ar
ticles on the League of Revolution
ary Struggle, The Daily has
damaged the multicultural agenda
• at Stanford.
» Such arguments give me reason
to pause and rigorously question
those making such charges as to
what role they feel The Daily
should be playing in the commu
nity.
I offer the following thoughts on
Jthe subject as my own, and not as
Daily policy per se. I'm on the way
out, and it is by no means appro
priate for a single individual to
mandate the relationship between
The Stanford Daily and the Stan
ford community.
First of all, the only agenda that
should be driving The Daily is a
firm commitment to presenting a
comprehensive depiction of Stan
ford's reality in a manner that is
accurate, thorough and fair. All we
do should follow from that com
mitment.
Because The Daily is committed

to covering an increasingly diverse
community, The Daily should
strive to build a diverse staff.
Building a diverse staff empowers
The Daily to better cover a plural
istic community.
It is appropriate for The Daily
to run stories which highlight the
accomplishments of the communi
ties of color. Doing so is an editorial
decision in line with the principle
that the pages of The Daily should
be a comprehensive diary of the
Stanford community.
However, it cannot be The Dai
ly's role to act as a guardian of
any other particular agenda, re
gardless of how good, how right or
how just that agenda seems to how
ever many people.
In the stories The Daily ran on
the League, several students in
volved in progressive politics on
campus raised questions about the
League's influence on student gov
ernment and the secrecy with
which the League exercises that
influence.
The Daily cannot shield from
criticism those working toward
multiculturalism or any other goal.
To do so is to enshrine an agenda
in a way which advocates blind
faith and prevents healthy ques
tioning.
When The Daily is no longer free
to print stories which implicitly
question ail those who have au
thority, it is no longer fulfilling its
mission. In the words of Thomas
Storke, for whom the building in
which we work is named. The Daily
must continue to "publish the
news that is public property with
out fear or favor of friend or foe."
