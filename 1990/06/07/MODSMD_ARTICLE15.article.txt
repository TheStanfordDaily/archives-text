## Parting words of advice 
### 
IT'S SAD TO say, but there aren't
any satisfying endings, only begin
nings to make up for them.
I realize that sounds terribly preten
tious, but I am graduating with a degree
in English, so I might as well get some
use out of it.
Jane Austen said, "It is a truth uni
versally acknowledged that a single man
in possession of a good fortune, must be
in want of a wife." Ha. That's not true
at all. This, ladies and gentleman, is Cal
ifornia — where a single man in posses
sion of a good fortune wants a Porsche.
At least that's what I thought, until I
received a wedding invitation — from a
friend who's the same age as I am (and
who does not own a Porsche). Soon after,
I started bumping into people here on
campus who are also getting married in
the near future — students, undergrad
uates: a junior, a senior, my screw-your
roommate date from freshman year . . .
Please, someone tell me, did I miss a
distribution requirement here, "Betrothal
101" or "Matrimony And You" or some
thing?
It's disturbing, to say the least. But I
refuse to feel old because of it. I will not
feel old until the day I unthinkingly ad
dress someone as "young man." On that
day I will acknowledge that I am old. If
that someone happens to be female, I
will acknowledge that I am both old and
stupid.
Despite such occasional disturbances,
though, Stanford has been a pretty good
place to spend four years; good enough,
in fact, that it doesn't take much for me

to understand how so many people end
up spending long, long periods of time
here beyond graduation (even Gorbachev
stayed longer than he had planned).
Nevertheless, if you do stay to work
or to play (or because you somehow
swindled the bookstore into selling
'Leland's Choice' granola), I highly rec
ommend that at some point you get the
hell out before you're dragged down into
the swirling Cardinal vortex.
Because before you know it you'll be
wearing red polyester pants, sitting on
the shady side of the stadium and begin
ning sentences with "when I was at Stan
ford ..." — and that's no way to go
through life.
The important thing is to use (or to
have used) the limited legitimate time
you have at Stanford by spreading your
self as thinly as possible without having
a nervous breakdown.
Yes, I am advocating doing 'too much.'
To all those people who spend more time
studying than being productive in other
academic and non-academic arenas: you
suck. See, I figure the reason Stanford
professors inflate our grades is so that
we have time to do things outside the
classroom; if you don't, you're not hold
ing up your end of the bargain.
Maybe this passivity comes from the
valediction "take it easy." It bugs me
when people say this because I'm afraid
that they mean it more as "get away
with doing as little as possible" than they
do as "don't stress."
My advice to you is don't take it easy,
don't take it too seriously and don't "Just

Do It." Do think about it, do have fun
with it and do work hard at it, whatever
'it' is for you at that moment.
There. I'm done with it.
Well, you've heard the saying that it's
better to keep your mouth shut and be
thought a fool than to open it and remove
all doubt. And, no argument here, that
makes me a fool.
If, that is, you believe the saying. I
don't. Because instead of remaining
quietly irrelevant, I'd rather risk being
a fool (and I'd rather know the truth
about others than hang around a bunch
of dubiously mute idiots) in the hope
that maybe I'll strike a chord with some
one.
So with any luck you'll be hearing,
rather than reading the next words I
write. Maybe it will be in a cinema, a
theater or your living room. Then again,
it may well be from me personally as I
jingle a cup outside a bus station some
where and hope you've got some spare
change.
Thanks very much for listening; you've
been a great audience. Have a good night
and drive safely.
