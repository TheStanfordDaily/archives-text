League critics have endured harassment by peers

I WRITE THE following open letter
to Delia Ibarra, Miguel Canales,
Michael Canul, John Cuerva, Daniel
Luna, Monica Martinez, Rebecca
Flores, Marcela Renteria, Jerilyn
Lopez-Mendoza, Richard Suh and the
many other students of color who have
endured more than three years of
intimidation and harassment by their
peers and whose cries for justice have
been ignored by those of us entrusted
to see that this campus lives up to the
ideals of honesty and fair play.
I have watched with troubled fas
cination as The Daily's coverage of the
League of Revolutionary Struggle and
the League's impact upon student and
University politics has unfolded over
the past few weeks. I am shaken by
the mode of denial that permeates the
thoughts and actions of many.

You and I are well aware that the
debate, at times out of ignorance and
at other times by design, has been
derailed by unfounded claims of rac
ism, political persecution and McCar
thyism. You and I know that in the
mistaken clamor for many to frame
the discussion in the context of free
dom of speech and freedom of assem
bly, they have glossed over your rights
to be free of intimidation and harass
ment.
Throughout the past three years I
have struggled for the appropriate
words and actions to help the Stanford
community understand the unpleasant
burden that has been thrust upon you.
Perhaps many would change their
perspectives if they had experienced
personally those things that you and I
have experienced. Perhaps their views

would change if it were they who had
been physically encircled and in
timidated by their peers. Perhaps their
self-righteousness would diminish if
they were the recipients of degrading
and menacing phone calls because they
engaged in the right to speak their
minds at public meetings. Perhaps
their attitudes would change if their
places of work were repeatedly van
dalized. Perhaps they would have a
change of heart if they and their 4-
year-old daughter encountered
decapitated birds on their doorstep at
home.
For my part, I deeply regret and
apologize to you for the fact that I was
not able to stop the harassment and
find the right words and actions to
make this community understand the
real injustices that you have endured.

In the remaining days that I have at
Stanford, I pledge to you that I will do
all within my power to help lift this
veil of ignorance and indifference.
Sadly, my actions will come too late
for your pain to be eased. I will under
take them, however, in hopes that
future students will never again have
to silently, and without support from
their elders, endure the tyranny of
other students because of a misguided
and divisive political agenda.
I commend each and every one of
you for your courage in the face of
unwarranted criticism and hostility.
Although others in the University may
not realize it yet, I thank you for
being the conscience of an entire com
munity.
Juan Ynigucz
Assistant dean of student affairs
