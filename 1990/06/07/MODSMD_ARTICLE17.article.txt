# University president has supported secret groups in past

### 
It seems a little disingenuous of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy to
rail against organizations with secret
memberships and secret agendas in the
June 5 Daily.
Is he really so forgetful as not to
recall that, just a couple of years ago,
he was forced to admit — after some
initial denial — that Stanford had for
years been subsidizing a secret group
of faculty and administrators to the
tune of their membership fees in the
Bohemian Club, an organization that
has the League of Revolutionary
Struggle beat all hollow when it comes
to secrecy of membership and agenda?
And how about the CIA, which finds
hospitably open doors at Stanford
every time it comes around to recruit?

Speaking of secrecy of membership and
agenda!
Neither, of course, can be accused of
being a left-leaning organization. Is it
only then that secrecy becomes a sin?
