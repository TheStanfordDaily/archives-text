# Gorbachev must miss walks alone, without crowds
## 
### 
I took a tour of the Stanford campus
today.
I cruised through White Plaza,
chatted with friends and listened to
people sing horribly in front of the
Bookstore for cans of Ban anti
perspirant.
I strolled through the Quad admiring
the beautiful architecture (I could actu

ally see it), the wonderful weather and
the uplifting serenity of the spring
afternoon.
There were no students mugging me,
no media harassing me and no "G
-men" escorting me around.
Sometimes I think Mikhail Gorba
chev is the unluckiest person in the
world.
