# COP recall effort fails
## 63 percent vote to remove 'Four Our Future'

Landing on its feet after another close
call, the Council of Presidents-elect will
remain in office next year, with no new
election slated for the fall.
A total of 62.55 percent of students voting
in Monday and Tuesday's recall election
chose to remove the "Four our Future"
slate from office, an amount just under
the two-thirds of all votes required to re
move the current slate from office. Another
143 votes was necessary for the recall to
pass.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss expressed surprise at the close out
come of the election. He called the result
"impressive," considering the difficultly of
the process for recall required by the ASSU
Constitution and Bylaws.
He also said voter turnout exceeded his
predictions, with 3,471 students arriving
at the polls, despite the Dead Week voting
dates. The voter turnout does not include
ballots from Stanford centers in Berlin,
Washington and Oxford. Krauss said he
expected to have those ballots by today.
Perry Friedman, organizer of Stanford
United for Fair Elections and a main force
behind the recall vote, said the best thing
for the COP to do would be to resign, start
over, and "try to restore the faith of the
community."
According to Friedman, there would be
no useful purpose in continuing the crusade

to recall the COP at the moment, and next
year the COP will have to address students
who will be "very wary of voting for them"
in spring elections.
Expecting a somewhat close election, re
turning COP member Ingrid Nava said one
reason for the narrow outcome was stu
dents' protest of the whole election process,
rather than of the COP specifically. She
stated that anti-People's Platform senti
ment also contributed to the outcome, and
that next year the COP "will work hard
to incorporate many people and make them
feel represented."
According to Nava, it was significant that
People's Platform supporters did get out
to vote despite "misinformation" surround
ing the election.
Students First member Michael Canul,
citing the 63 percent of voters in support
of a recall, said there is no mandate for
the current COP to be in power.
"If the People's Platform represents the
people, and if they have an ounce of the
moral integrity that they say they do, then
'Four Our Future' would step down from
office and ask for a new election in the
fall." he said.
The narrow victory of "Four Our Fu
ture" in the recall election this week fol
lowed the hotly contested ASSU elections
earlier this spring. On April 20, the Elec
tions Commission disqualified 275 wrtie-in
votes that would have necessitated a run
off election between the COP slates-
