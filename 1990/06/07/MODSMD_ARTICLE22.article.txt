## Stephen Ostrander League members, unwilling to share power, malign opponents 
### 
ASKIA MUHAMMAD, AN old
friend of mine and a ranking
member in the Nation of Islam,
once told me "Stephen, always remem
ber to question everybody." "Even
Minister Farrakhan?" I asked. "Even
Minister Farrakhan." he answered.
This is something I have always
remembered. It is the reason why I
have questioned and subsequently
opposed the League of Revolutionary
Struggle.
The League exists on this campus,
and a lot of people are desperately
lying to personal and political friends
in a vain attempt to maintain power
on this campus.
Many of these friends have ap
proached me to ask for my information
about the League. The disillusionment
that I have witnessed on their faces
after telling them the truth and my
sources is something I never want to
see again. What sense of morality leads
to these lies?
My commitment to progressive/liberal
politics is well known. My involvement
in the ASSU Committee on Democracy
in Education, the People's Platform,
the takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office and the Cali
fornia Progressive Student Alliance
speaks for itself. While my work in
these organizations represents a signifi

cant part of my life, my commitment
to progressive politics comes from my
parents.
In the 19605, my father worked in
the Washington, D.C. civil rights move
ment as an assistant minister in a
black church. As a result of his work
with such movement figures as Stokely
Carmichael, James Bevel and Martin
Luther King Jr., the Federal Bureau of
Investigation tapped the telephone
lines in his church office and in our
house. As a result of the FBl's "coun
terintelligence program"
(COINTELPRO), my father was inter
viewed several times about his and
others' activities.
I heard stories about this from a
very early age. Through this, I believe
I understand subversion and red
baiting, as well as political commit
ment.
I first became suspicious of outside
influence during and after the
takeover. Many strangers suddenly
appeared. A lot of information was
never clarified.
But it was the overwhelming rheto
ric that led me to question individuals
I thought were my friends. In one of
our many meetings after the takeover,
Council of Presidents member David
Brown, who was leading the meeting,
constantly substituted "The Enemy"

for "The Administration" in his re
marks. When I objected to this, several
people, who I now know to be League
members, verbally assaulted me.
Every time I suggested that we
needed to work with the administra
tion in order to secure the demands of
the takeover, League members would
scream at me that I was naive and
would publicly question my politics. I
am still proud that I took part in the
takeover, even though I resent that it
was secretly controlled by the League.
As a resident assistant in an all
frosh dorm, I have tried to get people
involved in issues of multiculturalism.
While some of them will never fully
appreciate other cultures, most have
simply become disillusioned. They feel
like they must be "politically correct"
or else they will be considered to be
racist.
This eventually leads to the belief
that multiculturalism is inherently
political. It is not. The League, in its
quest for revolution, has used the
struggle for multiculturalism as a
front. As a result of their commitment
to politics rather than people, they
have done more damage to multicul
turalism at Stanford than anyone else.
The reason why the League is im
portant is that it is a powerful secret
organization on this campus. Its mem

bers are unwilling to share power.
Neither are they willing to share credit
for the many gains that havbe been
made at this university.
This attitude can be found in Steve
Phillips' assertion that "The Daily
articles represent an attack on the
progress made at Stanford in the '80s.
To attack those of us named in the
article is to attack that progress."
Phillips' political vanity attests to the
League's assumed ownership of pro
gressive politics at Stanford.
League members who have written
letters to the editor over the past few
weeks have illustrated this arrogance
of power. Behind a shield of "smear
campaign," "racism" and "red-baiting,"
they have proposed that information
on the League is untrue (which it is
not) and represents a "McCarthyist"
attempt to subvert the student of color
communities. Anyone who has dealt
with the the League knows that they
are the foremost experts on defamation
of character on this campus.
An excellent example of this can be
found in former COP member Canetta
Ivy. Canetta, like most members of the
Black Student Union, opposed the
tactics of the takeover. For taking this
reasonable stance, those of us in the
takeover were told by the League
members that Canetta was a "blacker

than-thou" sellout, who was also racist.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I
believed the hype.
When I participated last March in a
trip with BSU members to Selma,
Alabama, to observe the 25th anniver
sary of the Selma-to-Montgomery
Voting Rights March, I got to know
the real Canetta. The real Canetta is
the baddest, most dedicated and loving
sister I know.
Many people associated with the
League members have been led to
believe that Canetta is the ultimate
evil at Stanford. This is just one small
example of the League's power.
I would like to ask League members
to stop lying. I often wonder if they
can. While much of the information
about the League remains out of print,
I am thankful that the basic fact is
out: The League is here.
Even with the intimidation of League
members, I have faith that activists on
this campus now know what time it is
and hopefully will not be afraid to
question their political environment.
To the members of the League of
Revolutionary Struggle, I have only
one thing to say: try to keep your
integrity, because in the end, it's all
you got.

house. As a result of the FBl's "coun
terintelligence program"
(COINTELPRO), my father was inter
viewed several times about his and
others' activities.
I heard stories about this from a
very early age. Through this, I believe
I understand subversion and red
baiting, as well as political commit
ment.
I first became suspicious of outside
influence during and after the
takeover. Many strangers suddenly
appeared. A lot of information was
never clarified.
But it was the overwhelming rheto
ric that led me to question individuals
I thought were my friends. In one of
our many meetings after the takeover,
Council of Presidents member David
Brown, who was leading the meeting,
constantly substituted "The Enemy"

for "The Administration" in his re
marks. When I objected to this, several
people, who I now know to be League
members, verbally assaulted me.
Every time I suggested that we
needed to work with the administra
tion in order to secure the demands of
the takeover, League members would
scream at me that I was naive and
would publicly question my politics. I
am still proud that I took part in the
takeover, even though I resent that it
was secretly controlled by the League.
As a resident assistant in an all
frosh dorm, I have tried to get people
involved in issues of multiculturalism.
While some of them will never fully
appreciate other cultures, most have
simply become disillusioned. They feel
like they must be "politically correct"
or else they will be considered to be
racist.
This eventually leads to the belief
that multiculturalism is inherently
political. It is not. The League, in its
quest for revolution, has used the
struggle for multiculturalism as a
front. As a result of their commitment
to politics rather than people, they
have done more damage to multicul
turalism at Stanford than anyone else.
The reason why the League is im
portant is that it is a powerful secret
organization on this campus. Its mem

bers are unwilling to share power.
Neither are they willing to share credit
for the many gains that havbe been
made at this university.
This attitude can be found in Steve
Phillips' assertion that "The Daily
articles represent an attack on the
progress made at Stanford in the '80s.
To attack those of us named in the
article is to attack that progress."
Phillips' political vanity attests to the
League's assumed ownership of pro
gressive politics at Stanford.
League members who have written
letters to the editor over the past few
weeks have illustrated this arrogance
of power. Behind a shield of "smear
campaign," "racism" and "red-baiting,"
they have proposed that information
on the League is untrue (which it is
not) and represents a "McCarthyist"
attempt to subvert the student of color
communities. Anyone who has dealt
with the the League knows that they
are the foremost experts on defamation
of character on this campus.
An excellent example of this can be
found in former COP member Canetta
Ivy. Canetta, like most members of the
Black Student Union, opposed the
tactics of the takeover. For taking this
reasonable stance, those of us in the
takeover were told by the League
members that Canetta was a "blacker

than-thou" sellout, who was also racist.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I
believed the hype.
When I participated last March in a
trip with BSU members to Selma,
Alabama, to observe the 25th anniver
sary of the Selma-to-Montgomery
Voting Rights March, I got to know
the real Canetta. The real Canetta is
the baddest, most dedicated and loving
sister I know.
Many people associated with the
League members have been led to
believe that Canetta is the ultimate
evil at Stanford. This is just one small
example of the League's power.
I would like to ask League members
to stop lying. I often wonder if they
can. While much of the information
about the League remains out of print,
I am thankful that the basic fact is
out: The League is here.
Even with the intimidation of League
members, I have faith that activists on
this campus now know what time it is
and hopefully will not be afraid to
question their political environment.
To the members of the League of
Revolutionary Struggle, I have only
one thing to say: try to keep your
integrity, because in the end, it's all
you got.

ASKIA MUHAMMAD, AN old
friend of mine and a ranking
member in the Nation of Islam,
once told me "Stephen, always remem
ber to question everybody." "Even
Minister Farrakhan?" I asked. "Even
Minister Farrakhan." he answered.
This is something I have always
remembered. It is the reason why I
have questioned and subsequently
opposed the League of Revolutionary
Struggle.
The League exists on this campus,
and a lot of people are desperately
lying to personal and political friends
in a vain attempt to maintain power
on this campus.
Many of these friends have ap
proached me to ask for my information
about the League. The disillusionment
that I have witnessed on their faces
after telling them the truth and my
sources is something I never want to
see again. What sense of morality leads
to these lies?
My commitment to progressive/liberal
politics is well known. My involvement
in the ASSU Committee on Democracy
in Education, the People's Platform,
the takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office and the Cali
fornia Progressive Student Alliance
speaks for itself. While my work in
these organizations represents a signifi

cant part of my life, my commitment
to progressive politics comes from my
parents.
In the 19605, my father worked in
the Washington, D.C. civil rights move
ment as an assistant minister in a
black church. As a result of his work
with such movement figures as Stokely
Carmichael, James Bevel and Martin
Luther King Jr., the Federal Bureau of
Investigation tapped the telephone
lines in his church office and in our
house. As a result of the FBl's "coun
terintelligence program"
(COINTELPRO), my father was inter
viewed several times about his and
others' activities.
