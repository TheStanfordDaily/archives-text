# Stanford goes wild
## Farm becomes an official game refuge 
### 
The Stanford Daily
June 6, 1927
The Fish and Game Commis
sion signed a bill making Stanford
an official game refuge. The area
designated for the refuge included
all of the campus and the foothill
and mountain properties of the
University — a total of over 7,500
acres.
The bill stated that any person
who hunts, takes, kills or has in
his possession any species of bird
or mammal, or any fire arms, is
guilty of a misdemeanor. The
crime is punishable by fine of not
less than $25 or exceeding $500
or by imprisonment in the county
jail for a period of time not less
than 25 days or more than 150
days or by both fine and imprison
ment.
An extra reason to avoid squir
rels with your bicycle. I found it!
The way to shut food service
down! According to this bill, those
funky mystery meat dishes Uni
versity Food Service serves are il
legal. I don't know about you, but
the only game or wildlife I've seen
on campus are mosquitoes, blue
birds, ground hogs and freshmen.

The lecture note service, pro
posed by recently elected ASSU
President Mike Herman, was to
be implemented in the upcoming
winter quarter.
Herman said that student at
tendance in classes covered by the
program would probably not drop
significantly.
He added that the ASSU was
considering copyrighting the
notes, either to the ASSU or the
professors themselves, to prevent
having the notes used un
scrupulously.
Can you think of 1,001 ways to
use lecture notes unscrupulously?
l)split them among all your
friends 2)not go to lecture 3)sell
them for exorbitant prices 4)cook
food s)wrap fish 6)kill mosquitoes
7)draw ugly faces of person sitting

next to you in Stats 60 lecture
B)throw at unsuspecting person at
Flicks 9)blow your nose 10) have
some fun lDpublish in Pravda
.. . How would a copyright help?
Those were the days! I bet students
back then didn't have nightmares
about yapping, nagging, annoy
ing, mud-slinging ASSU mem
bers.

The Stanford Daily
June 7, 1978
Palo Alto magazine "War
fare/Defense Electronics" re
ported that Soviet spies possibly
enrolled in "colleges such as Stan*
ford University" were conducting
industrial espionage in local
electronic businesses.
According to the magazine's
"informed sources," spying was
occurring in the Santa Clara Val
ley "where a daily data dump
[was] made to orbiting Soviet
satellites and where KGB agents
[had] been conducting industrial
espionage for several years."
OOoopps! Imagine, and we let
Gorby come to Stanford. I think
I saw the KGB on campus Monday
disguised as Stanford mounted
police. And, didn't Gorbachev meet
with the grand leaders of Silicon
Valley capitalists ? Is Tetris a form
of Soviet mind control? Should
we stop the Soviets before they get
cream colored Macs to play Crys
tal Quest? What do we have to
gain from the Cold War being,
over? Who was that 6-year-old
Mrs. Gorbachev spoke to? Is he a
future Stanford student ? What did
Gorby really say? What if his
translator was lying?
