# The 						Bug offers some advice to those panicked about graduating

### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
Okay, let's have one big oh-my-god-the
year-is-over-some-of-my-friends-are-
graduating-or-maybe-I'm-graduating-
I-can 't-believe-this-is-the-end-I'm-going
to-fail-my-finals sigh, please. Now that
that's out of the way, I'd like to update
everyone on the fact that I'm still un
employed and if anyone would like to
hire me please contact me before I run
out of cash. So long ...
Dear Bug,
Why do I have to graduate? Why can't
I stay here forever?
— Curious
This question is truly the product of
a twisted mind. It is quite ironic that
I'm answering this question on Friday,
June 1, just moments before I make a
dash for my car (which I fondly refer to
as The Juggernaut) and head to the hills
to begin my new life as a hermit — far
away from Stanford. As a matter of fact,
as you're reading this I'm probably en
joying a good book with a beer in my
hand somewhere in the Sierras.
Nevertheless, if you are really intent
on staying here forever, my suggestion
is to a) dig a hole in the ground in front
of Meyer Library and have your friends
bury you, or b) become a graduate stu
dent in math.
I suppose, Curious, you're interested
in more of an "official" opinion on the

matter. Kim, in the Graduation Office,
suggested you try switching majors
forever. Somebody might eventually
wonder why your transcript is fourteen
pages long, but "it might be a while
before the adminstration caught up with
you." She didn't say what might happen
when they "caught up with you." Prob
ably suspend your library privileges . . .
The person in the Bursar's Office said,
"provided you can keep coming up with
the money, I suppose you could stay
forever ..." And that brings us back to
reality. If you have that much money,
you'll eventually be booted for selling
drugs.

Dear Bug,
Is it true that the sculpture constructed
of pipes and cables just outside Meyer
library was built to recreate musical
notes? And if so, have any tunes been
played on it?
— Beethoven
It's a fortunate thing that this is my
last issue. My friends have been avoiding
me and trying to persuade me to seek
professional help. Why? Because of ques
tions like this one that cause me to sit
in front of Meyer at 11 p.m. with a har
monica in one hand and a tire iron to
bang on pipes in the other.
Paul Turner, a member of the Outdoor
Arts Commitee, told me he'd "never
heard that one before." Although the
name of this structure is something like
"Mozart 2," if it's supposed to recreate
musical notes, the guy who made it must
have been tone deaf.
I don't know if any tunes have been
played on it, but if there have been, I'm
sure they sounded like shit and were
completely unrecognizable.
Dear Bug,
We here in the otherwise desolate and
barren world of Manzanita love "Leland's
Place." However, one unanswered ques
tion still nags at us: what the hell is the
deal with the top of Leland's head?
— Chris
Here's Leland to answer that one for
you:
