## Card nine battles back from CWS elimination 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — If you want
a mule to move, sometimes you've
just gotta kick him in the butt.
The Stanford baseball team,
after stubbornly refusing to play
a decent-looking game in its first
two tries at the College World Se
ries, finally got its behind in gear
Tuesday afternoon.
The Cardinal, which had its col
lective caboose kicked by the
Georgia Bulldogs on Sunday,

rebounded for an elimination
game win over Mississippi State
on Tuesday and then came back
to hand Georgia its first loss of
the tournament last night, 4-2.
The Cardinal win means the
two teams will play again tomor
row for a spot in the NCAA title
game Saturday. Game time on Fri
day will depend on the outcome
of tonight's Louisiana State-
Oklahoma State game: If the
Tigers win, Stanford will play in
the first game of a doubleheader
at 1:07 p.m. (PST). If Okie State

wins, Stanford and Georgia will
play at 4:37 p.m. (PST).
No matter the time, the Cardi
nal will be in good shape if it gets
a pitching performance anything
like the ones turned in by John
Reid and Brian Sackinsky over
the last two days. Reid, making
his first appearance in the CWS
on Tuesday, and Sackinsky, who
was last night's surprise starter,
both had their best games of the
year just when Stanford needed
it most.
"This is probably the biggest

game I've pitched in in my life,"
Reid said after giving up eight
measly singles and a homer in
Tuesday's 6-1 victory over Missis
sippi State. "We had our backs
against the wall. ... I was
definitely nervous, but I just went
out and did what I needed to do."
What he needed to do was keep
the Bulldogß completely muzzled,
and he came one gopher ball away
from doing so. Even that run was
pretty weak: MSU's Scott
Mitchell, who hadn't hit a homer
all year, got the ball up in the
wind in the third and watched it
hit the "Wilson — Official Ball"
sign in right.
Actually, Mitchell didn't see it
hit, because he simply assumed
there was no way he could hit
one out and sprinted the whole
way around the bases. "I couldn't
tell if it'd gone out or not with
the white wall," Mitchell said.
When he finally figured out what
had happened, Mitchell came close
to ripping some teammates' arms
off with his high fives.
That was all the celebrating the
Bulldogs would do, as Reid got
out of jams in the seventh and
eighth with his trademark sinker.
In the seventh MSU loaded the
bases with a pair of hits and a
walk, but Rex Buckner then hit
a sharp grounder right at third
baseman Tim Griffin. Over to sec
ond for one, on to first for two,
double play, and Reid pumped
both arms in the air all the way
to the dugout.
"I was fortunate to get that
double-play ball, because it wasn't
a very good pitch," Reid said.
"That was pretty much the story
of the game: When they hit the
ball, they hit it right at someone."
The Cardinal batters, however,
finally stopped hitting the ball at
people, racking up almost as many
hits against the Bulldogs (11) as
they had in the previous two

games (13). Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess shook up the lineup a
little before the game, moving the
slumping Griffin (l-for-29 in the
postseason) to the eighth spot in
the order and putting Ryan
Turner at No. 5. Turner
responded with his fifth homer of
season — a no-doubt-about-this
one shot that cleared both levels
of advertising in right field —
which made Marquess more than
a little happy with the switch.
"We just needed something dif
ferent," Marquess said. "We may
change more, but we won't go
back to the old one."
Ironically, it was GrifTin who
started a rally in the seventh to
put the game away. With Stanford
up 2-1, Griffin opened the inning
with a walk — the first time in
three games he'd gotten to first
base — and then moved to third
on Troy Tallman's single. Jeff
Hammonds then hit a roller right
at third baseman Burke Masters,
who made sure Griffin wasn't
going anywhere, turned towards
second, and proceeded to hit a
perfect topspin lob to right field.
"It was one of those routine
double-play balls," Masters said.
"I felt bad for (pitcher) Bobby

(Reed) and the team — he threw
a great game, and that kind of
opened the door."
Yup. Griffin scored on the E5,
Tall man came in on a sacrifice
fly by Troy Paulsen, and then Da
vid McCarty capped off the inning
by drilling the ball down the third
base line. Left fielder John Cohen,
who had been playing in left
center, took about a week to get
to the ball, and by the time he
did McCarty was at second, Ham
monds had scored, and the game
was history.
"We got back to what we did
all year," Paulsen said. "It does
a lot for our confidence — we
want another shot at Georgia, be
cause they spanked us pretty good
last time."
There would be no spanking in
the rematch, as Sackinsky turned
his surprise start into a complete
game, six-hit, 10-strikeout mas
terpiece. After the first inning —
when he gave up four hits, two
runs and looked quite shaky —
Sackinsky let only three Georgia
batters reach base.
"After the first inning,
(Sackinsky) just did a great job,"
