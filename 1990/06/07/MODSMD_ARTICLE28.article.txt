## Card nine battles back from CWS elimination 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — If you want
a mule to move, sometimes you've
just gotta kick him in the butt.
The Stanford baseball team,
after stubbornly refusing to play
a decent-looking game in its first
two tries at the College World Se
ries, finally got its behind in gear
Tuesday afternoon.
The Cardinal, which had its col
lective caboose kicked by the
Georgia Bulldogs on Sunday,

rebounded for an elimination
game win over Mississippi State
on Tuesday and then came back
to hand Georgia its first loss of
the tournament last night, 4-2.
The Cardinal win means the
two teams will play again tomor
row for a spot in the NCAA title
game Saturday. Game time on Fri
day will depend on the outcome
of tonight's Louisiana State-
Oklahoma State game: If the
Tigers win, Stanford will play in
the first game of a doubleheader
at 1:07 p.m. (PST). If Okie State

wins, Stanford and Georgia will
play at 4:37 p.m. (PST).
No matter the time, the Cardi
nal will be in good shape if it gets
a pitching performance anything
like the ones turned in by John
Reid and Brian Sackinsky over
the last two days. Reid, making
his first appearance in the CWS
on Tuesday, and Sackinsky, who
was last night's surprise starter,
both had their best games of the
year just when Stanford needed
it most.
"This is probably the biggest

game I've pitched in in my life,"
Reid said after giving up eight
measly singles and a homer in
Tuesday's 6-1 victory over Missis
sippi State. "We had our backs
against the wall. ... I was
definitely nervous, but I just went
out and did what I needed to do."
What he needed to do was keep
the Bulldogß completely muzzled,
and he came one gopher ball away
from doing so. Even that run was
pretty weak: MSU's Scott
Mitchell, who hadn't hit a homer
all year, got the ball up in the
wind in the third and watched it
hit the "Wilson — Official Ball"
sign in right.
Actually, Mitchell didn't see it
hit, because he simply assumed
there was no way he could hit
one out and sprinted the whole
way around the bases. "I couldn't
tell if it'd gone out or not with
the white wall," Mitchell said.
When he finally figured out what
had happened, Mitchell came close
to ripping some teammates' arms
off with his high fives.
That was all the celebrating the
Bulldogs would do, as Reid got
out of jams in the seventh and
eighth with his trademark sinker.
In the seventh MSU loaded the
bases with a pair of hits and a
walk, but Rex Buckner then hit
a sharp grounder right at third
baseman Tim Griffin. Over to sec
ond for one, on to first for two,
double play, and Reid pumped
both arms in the air all the way
to the dugout.
"I was fortunate to get that
double-play ball, because it wasn't
a very good pitch," Reid said.
"That was pretty much the story
of the game: When they hit the
ball, they hit it right at someone."
The Cardinal batters, however,
finally stopped hitting the ball at
people, racking up almost as many
hits against the Bulldogs (11) as
they had in the previous two

games (13). Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess shook up the lineup a
little before the game, moving the
slumping Griffin (l-for-29 in the
postseason) to the eighth spot in
the order and putting Ryan
Turner at No. 5. Turner
responded with his fifth homer of
season — a no-doubt-about-this
one shot that cleared both levels
of advertising in right field —
which made Marquess more than
a little happy with the switch.
"We just needed something dif
ferent," Marquess said. "We may
change more, but we won't go
back to the old one."
Ironically, it was GrifTin who
started a rally in the seventh to
put the game away. With Stanford
up 2-1, Griffin opened the inning
with a walk — the first time in
three games he'd gotten to first
base — and then moved to third
on Troy Tallman's single. Jeff
Hammonds then hit a roller right
at third baseman Burke Masters,
who made sure Griffin wasn't
going anywhere, turned towards
second, and proceeded to hit a
perfect topspin lob to right field.
"It was one of those routine
double-play balls," Masters said.
"I felt bad for (pitcher) Bobby

(Reed) and the team — he threw
a great game, and that kind of
opened the door."
Yup. Griffin scored on the E5,
Tall man came in on a sacrifice
fly by Troy Paulsen, and then Da
vid McCarty capped off the inning
by drilling the ball down the third
base line. Left fielder John Cohen,
who had been playing in left
center, took about a week to get
to the ball, and by the time he
did McCarty was at second, Ham
monds had scored, and the game
was history.
"We got back to what we did
all year," Paulsen said. "It does
a lot for our confidence — we
want another shot at Georgia, be
cause they spanked us pretty good
last time."
There would be no spanking in
the rematch, as Sackinsky turned
his surprise start into a complete
game, six-hit, 10-strikeout mas
terpiece. After the first inning —
when he gave up four hits, two
runs and looked quite shaky —
Sackinsky let only three Georgia
batters reach base.
"After the first inning,
(Sackinsky) just did a great job,"


Michael Topolovac — Dally file
Jeff Hammonds went 2-for-4 with a RBI to help Stanford hold off Georgia 4-2 yesterday to stay alive
In the World Series.
Georgia Coach Steve Webber said.
"He had us off-balance the whole
time."
Except for the first inning, of
course. Sackinsky, who has been
used mainly as a reliever in the
last third of the season, let the
first two Bulldog batters score,
which earned him an early visit
from Marquess. "I asked Brian
how he felt, and he said he felt
good, so I said 'Let's get it going,
then!' " Marquess said.
"Brian's big problem was
leaving the ball up, and if you do
that hitters are going to hit it all
over the park," catcher Troy Tall
man said. "He settled down after
that.... That's been the story all
year for him: Once he gets over
that hump and settles down, he's
as tough as anyone we have. From

the second on he was tough as
nails."
So was Georgia's Dave Fleming,
who only gave up one run in the
first six innings. Hammonds
picked that one up when he led
off the fourth with a single and
then scored on a double by Paul
sen. Actually, "scored" doesn't do
the play justice.
The following is from the next
Webster's definition of "speed":
Paulsen hit a rope down the third
base line, Hammonds screamed
past second, was at third before
the ball hit the wall, crossed the
plate before left fielder Ray Suplee
threw the ball back to the infield
and then had so much trouble
slowing down he almost dove
headfirst into the stands before
coming to a stop. (Well, not really,
but you get the idea.)
That was it until the seventh,
when Tallman crunched a one-out
double to left. Roger Burnett
worked Fleming for a walk, and

then Griffin was hit by a pitch to
load the bases for designated hit
ter Mike Eicher.
Eicher, who was taking the
place of the injured David
Holbrook, hit a 1-2 pitch off the
front of the plate and hauled off
down to first. The ball dribbled
a few feet toward third, Tallman
raced home, and Fleming dove to
pick up the ball. By the time he
got it Tallman was in, everyone
was safe, the game was tied, and
Eicher had the world's cheesiest
RBI.
"I thought I had a shot, but on
the last hop it took a kick to the
right, and I didn't have enough
time," Fleming said.
Fleming's time ran out one
pitch later, as Hammonds laced
the ball under third baseman Jeff
Cooper's glove for two more runs.
So, JefT, what pitch were you
looking for? "To tell you the truth,
I was back in the clubhouse fixing
my contact when I should have

been in the on-deck circle, so I
didn't know what he was throw
ing that inning," Hammonds said.
The two-run lead was more
than enough with Sackinsky
mowing everyone down. The Bull
dogs had a man on second in the
bottom of the seventh — the only
time a Georgia runner got that
far after the first — and left him
there when Sackinsky struck out
Joey Alfonso with a sloooow
breaker over the outside corner.
In the eighth Cooper hit a deep
fly ball to left-center, but Turner
made the most spectacular defen
sive play of the week on it, racing
over, diving, catching the ball
while flying through the air and
then turning a somersault upon
hitting the ground. Everyone in
the field gave a fist-pump, the
bench went nuts, and an inning
later the Cardinal had set itself
up for a Friday rematch with Bull
dogs.
