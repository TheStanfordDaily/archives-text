# Sitting on the edge of forever
## 
### 
A timid 5-year-old. The first day of kinder
garten. "Mommy, help me!"
, Unfamiliar faces everywhere. A lack of
self-confidence. No sense of what the future will
bring.
More than three years ago, a new writer begins
his journalism career innocently enough as a
member of the editorial board and a news reporter
willing to cover nearly anything.
The Daily is a hobby, he thinks. Eventually,
he will come to see it as a long and sinewy
journey. The early days are the first steps down
a road fraught with frustration, yet made easier
to traverse by moments of adulation.
Time passes. The youth slowly matures. Peers
express admiration.
A change in course. Sports writing. A new
niche on life. A dream come true.
Back in Brooklyn, two brothers sat around
years ago watching the New York Mets on tele
vision. They would open the windows and "broad
cast" the game to anyone who might be lurking
in the backyard.
A decade later, one of the brothers finds himself
chronicling the annals of sport. He sits, stands
and jumps around cheering in awe of Stanford
athletics.
His work isn't always revered, but is often
talked about. Some think he's a fool; others think
he has a certain flair. For his own part, he feels
ready to try to make a living doing something
he loves.
A crossroads appears all too suddenly. Grad
uation is near. The real world beckons. The man
must say farewell.
An exciting future. New challenges. A past that
won't socn be forgotten.
The kaleidoscope of images is always in flux.
Today, something might be the memory to
end all memories. Tomorrow, it might as
fleeting as a sand castle soon to be washed away
by high tide.
Still, some of the moments — and the people
that made them possible — have been perma
nently engraved and placed in a mental file
marked "Unforgettable" . . .
Jennifer Azzi is shooting three-pointers. Over
and over, she swishes them through the net.
Alongside her stands Katy Steding. Like Azzi,
Steding simply can't miss.
After cutting down the net, Azzi throws a pass
to Brad Muster. Brad Humphreys stops Gaston
Green cold as Muster charges over the goal line.
There the burly fullback meets A 1 Osuna and
places the ball in his glove. Osuna puts eight
goose eggs on the scoreboard, which then reads
"STANFORD WINS."
On the court, Howard Wright celebrates the
victory by hugging Todd Lichti. Paul Carey has
just rounded t he bases after hitting a grand slam
and joins in the celebration.
Lisa Green isn't involved in the festivities. She
doesn't even realize her forehand has just clinched
yet another national championship.
Los Angeles. Pullman, Wash. Eugene, Ore.
Gainesville, Fla. Seattle. Los Angeles.
Knoxville, Tenn. Los Angeles. Greensboro,

N.C. Honolulu. The White House. A travel
itinerary that tells a story of truly thrilling vic
tory and equally agonizing defeat. If only I'd
kept the frequent flyer miles.
Twice, it almost included trips home to the
Big Apple. The first chance was the NCAA men's
basketball East Regional in 1989. This year, the
hope rested on a shot at the NIT Final Four. If
I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.
The travel isn't what it's cracked up to be.
Airplanes, hotels and fast food are things anyone
can live without. Coming back to Stanford has
always been a relief, a return to normalcy. What's
normal about staying up till 3 a.m. to put out a
newspaper.
While all the faraway places have their merits,
most of the favorites are right here. Third row,
center court at Maples. The hill at Sunken Dia
mond. Any seat in cozy Burnham Pavilion. The
bleachers outside Court 7 at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
Ten years from now, revisiting those venues
will be a chance to recapture what is soon to be
lost youth. To be carefree. To escape for just a
few precious hours.
Next year, instead of having the Band select
new Dollies, maybe the Dollies will select
a new Band.
Next year, maybe Denny Green and the football
team will finally start doing all that winning
everyone wants them to do so badly.
Next year, the women's volleyball team just
might win that elusive national title.
Next year, women's tennis will face its toughest
challenge since its dynasty began five years ago.
If they become the first team to win NCAAs on
their home courts, Coach Frank Brennan will
have to start putting championship rings on his
other hand.
Next year, assuming Jared Palmer and Jona
than Stark don't have sensational summers and
turn professional, Coach Dick Gould will have
an unbelievable team as he tries to capture his
fourth straight title.
Next year, Adam Keefe will lead the men's
basketball team into the NCAA tournament. The
squad's postseason losing streak will come to an
end at three.
Next year, Jennifer Rowland, completely recov
ered from knee surgery, and women's soccer will
Rocket into the postseason for the first time.
Julie Foudy and Elise Edwards will supply much
of the fuel.
Next year, sophomores Janet Evans and Janel
Jorgensen will again capture six NCAA individual
championships between them. But they won't
care because they'll win the team title that some
how slipped through fingers as freshmen.
Next year, Chryste Gaines will smash her own


Mark
Rogowsky
school records. At night, she'll
dream of passing Flo Jo in the
last 20 meters.
Next year, field hockey will be
a club sport. Few people will
notice. Few people will care. For
some reason, that bothers me.
Still, Stanford will field more var
sity sports than any school west
of the Mississippi. And the Car
dinal may win more national titles
than anyone in the country —
again.
Next year, Alan Grant, Rob
Hinckley and Lester Archambeau

will join Muster, Dave Wyman and
Toi Cook in the NFL. Wright may
join Lichti in the NBA. Stan Spen
cer, Mike Mussina, Paul Carey
and Tim Griffin will begin their
quest to join Jack McDowell, Jeff
Ballard and Steve Buechele in the
meyors. Who says top athletes
can't be good students as well?

Next year, I'll be somewhere
else. It's been a great ride.

Mark Rogowsky is The Daily's
senior sports writer. He hopes his
future includes Sports Illustrated.
Or The National. Or the LA..
Times. Or at least a beachfront
condo with a satellite dish.
