# Gorbachev visit provides 'boost of confidence' for Stanford
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Amid all the hype concerning the Mikhail
Gorbachev visit, Stephen Peeps offered a
bit of rare understatement.
"I don't think it hurt Stanford at all,"
said the associate vice president for Public
Affairs, weary from several days of little
sleep.
Other administrators more heartily
agreed that although a detailed cost
benefits analysis is impossible — since all
the different costs have not been analyzed

— the University came out ahead from the
Soviet president's visit.
Though they could not place even a rough
estimate on the cost Stanford incurred for
the visit, administrators said they will be
able to make estimates in about 10 days.
"The immediate benefits are incalcul
able," Peeps said, calling the visit "a won
derful endorsement of what is going on
here" at Stanford.
University President Donald Kennedy
agreed, saying, "You can't calculate things
like that." He added it is very
important for the University to
look good on millions of television
screens around the world, "par
ticularly when the ground isn't
shaking."
World attention has centered on
Stanford in the last few months,
beginning with the October earth
quake. Kennedy, along with
former Secretary of State and
Business Prof. George Shultz,
made Centennial trips to meet
Mexican President Carlos Salinas
in February and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney in
March.
With the Gorbachev visit under
the University's belt, Peeps said
the recent international focus on
Stanford "isn't by accident." The
University is actively seeking to
raise its international image and
to create stronger ties outside the
United States.
He hinted there may be "more
to come" next year.
"There's no doubt [Gorbachev's
visit] helped us," said Provost
James Rosse. The visit had a pos
itive effect on faculty and staff
morale and provided a "boost of
self-confidence," he said.
"Just as it improves the way
the nation thinks about us," he
said, "it improves the way we
think about ourselves."
But this increased prestige is
not free. According to Director of

University Relations Richard
Kurovsky, the administration
tried to keep its "foot tight on
the brakes" of spending.
However, he added, "The whole
process went by so quickly we
couldn't get a complete handle"
on the costs, and he could not
estimate the total cost.
The University, in many cases,
"spun off the costs" to outside
organizations, he said. For exam
ple, Kurovsky noted, the Univer
sity funded the Media Center in
Maples Pavilion, but the individ
ual news groups paid for the tele
phone lines and live television
feeds.
The elaborate staging of
Memorial Auditorium for Gorba
chev's speech, however, was
funded by the University. Costs
included the simultaneous trans
lation, the bullet-proof shield in
front of the podium and the Soviet
seal on its front, Kurovsky said.
Marv Harrington, director of
Police Services, said many differ
ent departments contributed, in
cluding the California Highway
Patrol and the San Jose and Sun
nyvale Police departments. But,
he added, the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department and the
Stanford Police will bear the
brunt of the bill.
About 95 percent of the cost
stems from overtime pay for the
more than 150 officers who
watched over the visit, he said.
According to Larry Davidson,
associate director of Events and
Services, his department handled
most of the logistics for the visit.
