# No one's laughing at Sackinsky now

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — Fifty-five
minutes before last night's
Stanford-Georgia game, several
members of the ESPN
broadcasting team were sitting in
a section of the upper press box
at Rosenblatt Stadium, having
themselves a ball.
The ESPN producers, tech
nicians and announcers had just
been told that Stanford's Brian
Sackinsky would be starting on
the mound for the Cardinal, and
they thought that was the fun
niest news they'd heard all week.
"Sackinsky? You've got to be
kidding!" one of them chuckled.
"How many runs did he give
up the other night? Five?" Sack
insky had worked one-third of an
inning in Georgia's 16-2 mauling
of the Cardinal, giving up five
runs on four hits. The thought
of him starting against the Bull
dogs, they thought, was more
than a little ridiculous.
The ESPN crew weren't the
only ones having a good laugh.
All over the press box, the words
"Sackinsky? You mean the one
who pitched on Sunday?" could
be heard.
It was a joke. It had to be,
everyone thought. How could this
guy possibly survive? Stanford's
giving up, right?
Wrong. Four hours, nine in
nings, 10 strikeouts and only six
hits later, an ecstatic Brian Sack
insky walked into the post-game
interview room after pitching the
game of his life.
The ESPN folks were nowhere
to be found.
Let's put Sackinsky's perform
ance in perspective: All he did last
night in the final eight innings
was let exactly three Georgia bat
ters reach base — on a single, a
double and a walk. All he did was
let only one Bulldog get as far as
second after inning No. 1. All he
did was set down 12 batters in a
row at one point. All he did was
strike out a career-high 10 hitters
(his previous best was seven). And
all he did was pitch the first com
plete game of his career, in the
biggest game of his career.
That's pretty funny.
It's also pretty good for some
one who found out he was pitch
ing one hour before the game.
Stan Spencer had been scheduled
to pitch, but woke up yesterday
morning with sore ribs. Spencer
received treatment during the day
and tried to throw during pre
game warmups, but couldn't get
rid of the pain.
"Stan told me in the elevator
at the hotel that he was sore, and
he asked me 'Have they talked to

you?' and I said no," Sackinsky
said. "Maybe that was the key
thing," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said.
Sackinsky didn't have much
time to think last night, but he
still got off to a rocky start, giving
up two runs on four hits in the
first inning. After that, things
were beautiful.
"We should've waited until 10
or 15 minutes before the game,"
Marquess joked afterward. "Stan

opened his big mouth, so we had
to tell him."
Marquess said there was never
even any consideration of going
with Spencer, because everyone
had confidence in Sackinsky.
"Brian Sackinsky at 100 per cent
is better than Stan Spencer at 75
per cent," Marquess said.
He's also good for a few laughs
every now and then. And some
times, he even gets to laugh back.
