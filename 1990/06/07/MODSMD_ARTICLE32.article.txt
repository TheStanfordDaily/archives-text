## Jennifer Azzi — National Player of the Year 
### 
Four years ago, Jennifer Azzi
received some bad advice from
the home folks in Oak Ridge,
Tenn.
They told her, in no uncertain
terms, "Don't go West, young
woman!"
Fortunately, she ignored
them.
When she arrived here, wom
en's basketball was nothing more
than a curiosity. The team
wasn't very good and had a very
small following.
But the 5-foot-9 guard worked
hard to change that. Each year
she got better, and the team im

proved as well. Finally, in 1990,
the Cardinal won its first-ever
national championship in wom
en's basketball.
At the end of last season, Azzi
established herself as one of the
nation's elite. She was named
Pacific 10 Conference Player of
the Year and a first-team Ail-
American.
This season, she received both
honors again — and more. Azzi
won the Wade Trophy and the
Naismith Award. Both recog
nized her as the best player in
the country.
Her tendency to play big in

the big games also led to her
being named the Most Outstand
ing Player in the NCAA tourna
ment.
Azzi graduates as the second
leading scorer in school history
and sits atop the all-time lists
for assists and steals.
Though her collegiate career
is over, Azzi hopes to continue
playing basketball. She is a
finalist for the U.S. National
team.
For all of this, Jennifer Azzi
is — for the second-straight time
— the Daily's female Athlete of
the Year.
