# Stan Spencer — First-team All-American
## 
### 
A life in athletics is often cruel.
One moment you can be on top
of the world, but 15 minutes
later your time has passed you
by and you fall. Only a lucky
few ever make it back to the top
again.
Stan Spencer is one of the few.
Spencer, a 6-foot-3 junior out
of Vancouver, Wash., was con
sidered a good prospect out of
high school, but no one expected
he would have the season he
had. He earned a spot in the
Cardinal's starting rotation as a
freshman and went on to get
credit for the victory in both the

regional championship game and
in the championship game of the
College World Series.
The following year, however,
Spencer and the team slumped.
The Cardinal failed to make the
postseason for the first time
since 1980 and Spencer posted
a losing record.
Coming into 1990 no one knew
what Spencer would do.
He got off to a 12-0 start,
losing for the first time April 27
at Arizona State.
That is still his only loss.
He is currently 14-1 on the
year and has tied the school

record for single-season wins. He
has led the Cardinal to the Col
lege World Series again this year,
and if the Cardinal wins tomor
row, CWS viewers will see a
familiar sight: Stan Spencer will
once again be on the mound in
the NCAA championship game.
He was named a first-team
All-American last week and was
the 35th player selected in the
league draft earlier this
week. For these remarkable ac
heivements, and for his contri
butions to the Cardinal's return
to glory, Stan Spencer is The
Daily's male Athlete of the Year.

Dame, the women's soccer team
was successful in carrying out its
task of equal proportions.
The once unhearaided Cardinal
squad was put to the test when
top-ranked and undefeated North
Carolina journeyed to the Farm
to close out its perfect season with
its 23rd consecutive victory . The
Tar Heels overlooked one tiny fact
before they took to the field, how
ever: Stanford is no longer a door
mat of collegiate soccer.
Boy was North Carolina in for

a big surprise.
At the end of regulation time
the Tar Heels had yet to put the
ball through the goal. Thanks to
the heroic play of goalie Elise Ed
wards the dangerous squad never
did.
At the end of a 15-minute over
time, the feared team still hadn't
converted a single score. And
Stanford had tied the eight-time
defending NCAA champions.
Stanford 0, North Carolina 0.
Even Stanford Coach Berhane
Andeberhan revealed that he had
given his team no chance of stop
ping the Tar Heels before the con
test.
Stanford soccer had arrived.
