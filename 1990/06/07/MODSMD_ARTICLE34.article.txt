NCAA crown is
in the Cards
IThe dream became
reality.
Brimming with poten
tial and under the
tuteladge of basketball
genius Tara VanDerveer
the Cardinal women's
basketball team had the tools to
go all the way: A returning Ail-
American, two other All-American
candidates, a top recruit and a
deep bench. The squad even had <
a reminder of its goal posted on
the locker-room walls. But aca- I
demic schools just don't win bas
ketball crowns very often these
days.
But after beating nemesis Ten
nessee for the first time ever (see
realted story) and cruising
through the Pacific 10 season —
dropping only one game in con
ference play — the nation's
second-ranked squad was poised
to make its move.
Although the West Regional
consisted of four of the top 10
teams in the country, host and
No. 1 seed Stanford kept focused,
coming through with fast breaks,
steallar shooting and amazing de
fense to down Hawaii, Mississippi
and Arkansas to earn its first trip
to Nashville.
But the Card's personal March
Madness wasn't quite complete.
A semifinal match-up with Vir
ginia was no contest. It was all
Cardinal and White, as Stanford
cruised to a 77-65 victory over
the pesky but not threatening
Cavaliers.
Auburn eliminated the neces
sity of playing No. 1 Louisiana
Tedi, but the Lady Tigers were
no house cats. Afler falling behind
by 10 right before halftime, the
Cardinal clawed its way back into
contention, reeling off nine points
in a row to knot the score at
41-41 at the buzzer. The second
half belonged to Jennifer Azzi,
Katy Steding, Trisha Stevens,
Sonya Henning and Val Whiting.
Stanford 88, Auburn 81.

The top frosh

Wrong.
The squad swept through the
season, aropping nary a contest
along the way Annihilating oppo
nents every which way, the Car
dinal completed its second, con
secutive undefeated season, ex
tending its school-record winning
streak to 61 before NCAAs even
rolled around. Talk about
dominating — Stanford needed
doubles to win only three times
the entire year.
For the second year in a row it
was a 26-0 dual meet season.
'Georgia, here we come!' was the
message Florida, UCLA, Cal and
the rest of the field received.
And it was no contest. No one
could touch the torrid Card. The
Stanford six shut-down every op
ponent in singles — goose-egging
two of its four hapless opponents.
Second round: Stanford 6, Ari

All's well in
Indian Wells
Like its sister
squad, the men's
tennis team was
coming off multi
year championship
seasons. And like
the women, the
squad opened the season ranked

No. 1 and gunning towards ex
tending its title-streak.
Yet despite being loaded with
talent — two of the nation's top
recruits in addition to returning
Ail-Americans filled in the start
ing lineup — it was anything but
smooth sailing for the Cardinal.
After opening its year with 16
straight victories — including the
national indoors title over Cali
fornia in Feb. — Stanford was
forced to dig deep to locate its
true determination. No. 1 singles
palyer Jonathan Stark was
sidelined with a stress fracture,
and No. 2 Jared Palmer joined
him on the sidelines-
With a much-aligned lineup the
squad was out-battled by the
Golden Bears at home.
Chances of a third-consecutve
title did not seem bright.
Critics, however, forgot to in
clude the Stanford mystique or
the team's true character when
prognaticising the eventual NCAA
victor.
A gutsy 5-4 downing of Cal at
Berkeley hearalded things to
come. Entering the tournament
seeded second but with a healthy
— if somewhat rusty — lineup,
Stanford would not be denied.
Downings of Oklahoma State,
Texas, USC and No. 1 seed Ten
nesse brought home Coach Dick
Gould's third consecutive national
crown.

#■ ter of intent last

| Stanford, Coach
Mark Marquess had
high expectations
for the Plainfield, N.J native.
However, nobody could have an
ticipated what happened on April
7. t
Hammonds stepped to the plate
against UCLA's Tim Lindsay with
two men on and the Cardinal trail
ing 3-1. He proceeded to stroke a
3-2 change-up into the left field
seats to put Stanford ahead for
good.
So what, you ask. Clutch hits
are to be expected from a .360
batter, especially one who was
good enough to get drafted out of
high school by the Toronto Blue

Jay 9. Well, not only did Ham
monds' blast propel the Cardinal
to victory, but it also extended his
phenomenal hitting streak to 29
games, a Pacific 10 Southern Con
ference record. He broke the mark
previously held by teammate Troy
Paulsen.
Hammonds would extend his
hitting streak to a Pac-10 record
37 games before being shut down
on April 21 by Arizona Wildcat
pitchers Lance Dickson and Jim
Richardson. Hammonds batted
.385 during the streak.

Card brings down
house Wooden built
5 One could hardly
fault the Stanford
basketball team if
they were begining
to feel a bit like the
Washington
Generals. Although
the Cardinal's losing streak was
not in the thousands, the UCLA
Bruins seemed a little like the
Harlem Globetrotters and Pauley
Pavilion was Stanford's personal
hell.
Until Feb. 18, 1990, that is.
The Cardinal had never won in
Pauley and hadn't won a game
at UCLA since 1947 but all that
changed. Despite the fact that the
Bruins were madder than heck
about losing to the Cardinal ear
lier in the year, and the time
before that, and the time before
that.
The visitors took the lead at
7-5 and never relinquished it.
Freshman Marcus Ixillie drew a
charge with 3:51 to go and calmly
stepped to the line for a one-and
one. His first offering rolled
around the rim beforefinally fall
ing, then he swished the second
to give Stanford a 67-56 lead.
Things seemed to be all in favor
of the Cardinal, but that wasn't
actually the case. Four Stanford
played had four fouls each, and
UCLA was pressing Ixillie and his
freshman backcourtmate, Peter
Dukes, mercilessly UCLA ripped
into the lead and Lollie again
found himself at the free throw
line. This time it was 68-66, and
there were 43 seconds left.
Lollie iced the pair, and Stan
ford's defense held on for the 70-
69 win. After the game, Coach

Mike Montgomery said every
thing that needed to be said about
the tremendous win:
"Wow."

Card nine finds
No. 1 is fine
Stanford
baseball was ranked
No. 1 most of the
second half of the
season, double
elimination playoff
format is made for
upsets — as most of the other
top regional seeds discovered.
The Card nine, however, were
not going to let Omaha slip away.
True to its play throughout the
entire season, Stanford dominated
the West 1 Region, dropping nary
a contest on the way to its regional
title. Breaking the school baseball
record for most victories in a
season, the team picked up its

53rd, 54th, 55th and 56th wins
in earning its first berth to the
College World Series in two years.
The Pac-10 Southern Division
Champ earned its ticket with solid
play — highlighted by spectacular
pitching and stellar defense. While
overall offensive production was
average, Mike Mussina, Stan
Spencer, and J. R. Reid combined
for a 1.25 ERA to down Campbell
7-1, Midle Tennessee State 6-1,
and San Diego State 6-2 twice.
For pitching the Card to two
victories Mussina was named
Most Outstanding Player. Joining
him on the all-regional team were
center fielder Jeff Hammonds, left
fielder Ryan Turner, Spencer,
first baseman David McCarty and
shortstop Roger Burnett.

Sports
Doubles the key
for tennis victory
-n.Going into the
last match of the
season, the Cardi-
Jgr' nal men's tennis
team was reeling.
They started the
season by winning
their first 16 matches. They rarely
played doubles. And not only were
they in position to win their third
consecutive NCAA title, but
people were calling them the best
Cardinal squad ever.
But Stanford then lost a tough
match to California, suffered two
key injuries, and went on to get
hammered by both UCLA and
use.
Stanford's final match of the
regular season was at Cal and the
Cardinal was in dire need of es
tablishing momentum going into
NCAAs.
Stanford did just that. Palmer
returned to action and fell to
Bent-Ove Pedersen, but Alex
O'Brien posted a win at No. 2.
While two other Stanford players
were losing, Alexis Hombredier
used his big serve and crisp
groundstrokes to pull out a three
set win at No. 5 singles.
Once again the decision came
down to doubles.The pressure was
on Hombrecher and Jeff Cathrall,
who were in a tense third set with
Pedersen and Chang. Hombrec
her's big play kept the Cardinal
on serve, and with Chang serving
at 5-5, Stanford broke him.
The freshman served five con
secutive faults to make it 40-30,
but came back with one last big
serve and a couple of shots later
it was game, set, match and team
victory to Stanford.

Hoops Volunteers
a landmark win
8 Before the
Stanford women's
basketball team
could be consid
ered serious con
tenders for the
NCAA title, they had to get by
Tennessee. While the rest of the
school was preparing for Autumn
Quarter finals, Jennifer Azzi and
company were busy getting ready
for a much tougher test, the Ten

nessee Lady Vols.
The defending national cham
pions came to Maples Pavilion
eager for the chance to defeat the
unbeaten and No. 2-ranked Car
dinal, who had not yet faced an
opponent with Tennessee's talent
and reputation.
A crowd of over 5,000 highly
partisan fans attended the event
— the largest crowd at Maples
for a women's event at that time.
The Lady Vols were hungry for
an upset and looked as if they
might pull it off when, after trail
ing for the entire game, they
pulled to within a single point
with a few minutes gone in the
second half.
The Cardinal would have none
of it. Paced by 23 points from
Sonja Henning and 20 from
Trisha Stevens, Stanford charged
to an 85-71 victory that upped
the team's record to 11-0, pushed
the women's cagers into national
prominence and gave them the
confidence they needed to capture
the national title.

Spikers rise
to the occasion
9 Part of the attrac
tion that sport holds
over people is the
black-and-white na
ture. Someone wins,
someone loses and
there usually isn't
much of an argument to be made.
That was the way the regular
season ended for the Stanford
men's volleyball team. Going into
the last weekend of the season,
the Cardinal had two matches left
and a simple scenario: Win both
and go to the playoffs or lose one
and stay home.
After begining the season as the
nation's top-ranked squad, Stan
ford didn't expect thingß to be so
interesting. But an injury to set
ter Parker Blackman and a very
competitive division of its league
made things go down to the wire.
In front of a jam-packed
Burnham Pavilion crowd of 1,412
and a national ESPN audience,
the Cardinal came out of the
blocks on fire.
But the Trojans weren't the na
tion's top team on the basis of
neat uniforms. USC got into a
rythm and ground out games
three and four.
The fifth set was it. After falling
behind 9-4, the Card took over.
A Keefe kill gave Stanford the
lead at 14-13 and served match
point. USC set the nation's top
player but Duncan Blackman
came up with a dig to his brother.
Parker set it back to Duncan who
hit it ... to victory.

All's well in

Like its sister
squad, the men's
tennis team was
coming off multi
year championship
seasons. And like
the women, the
squad opened the season ranked

No. 1 and gunning towards ex
tending its title-streak.
Yet despite being loaded with
talent — two of the nation's top
recruits in addition to returning
Ail-Americans filled in the start
ing lineup — it was anything but
smooth sailing for the Cardinal.
After opening its year with 16
straight victories — including the
national indoors title over Cali
fornia in Feb. — Stanford was
forced to dig deep to locate its
true determination. No. 1 singles
palyer Jonathan Stark was
sidelined with a stress fracture,
and No. 2 Jared Palmer joined
him on the sidelines-
With a much-aligned lineup the
squad was out-battled by the
Golden Bears at home.
Chances of a third-consecutve
title did not seem bright.
Critics, however, forgot to in
clude the Stanford mystique or
the team's true character when
prognaticising the eventual NCAA
victor.
A gutsy 5-4 downing of Cal at

Stanford would not be denied.

Mark Marquess had
high expectations
for the Plainfield, N.J native.
However, nobody could have an
ticipated what happened on April
7. t
Hammonds stepped to the plate
against UCLA's Tim Lindsay with
two men on and the Cardinal trail
ing 3-1. He proceeded to stroke a
3-2 change-up into the left field
seats to put Stanford ahead for
good.
So what, you ask. Clutch hits
are to be expected from a .360
batter, especially one who was
good enough to get drafted out of
high school by the Toronto Blue

Jay 9. Well, not only did Ham
monds' blast propel the Cardinal
to victory, but it also extended his
phenomenal hitting streak to 29
games, a Pacific 10 Southern Con
ference record. He broke the mark
previously held by teammate Troy
Paulsen.
Hammonds would extend his
hitting streak to a Pac-10 record
37 games before being shut down
on April 21 by Arizona Wildcat
pitchers Lance Dickson and Jim
Richardson. Hammonds batted
.385 during the streak.

Card brings down

5 One could hardly
fault the Stanford
basketball team if
they were begining
to feel a bit like the
Washington
Generals. Although
the Cardinal's losing streak was
not in the thousands, the UCLA
Bruins seemed a little like the
Harlem Globetrotters and Pauley
Pavilion was Stanford's personal
hell.
Until Feb. 18, 1990, that is.
The Cardinal had never won in
Pauley and hadn't won a game
at UCLA since 1947 but all that
changed. Despite the fact that the
Bruins were madder than heck
about losing to the Cardinal ear
lier in the year, and the time
before that, and the time before
that.
The visitors took the lead at
7-5 and never relinquished it.
Freshman Marcus Ixillie drew a
charge with 3:51 to go and calmly
stepped to the line for a one-and
one. His first offering rolled
around the rim beforefinally fall
ing, then he swished the second
to give Stanford a 67-56 lead.
Things seemed to be all in favor
of the Cardinal, but that wasn't
actually the case. Four Stanford
played had four fouls each, and
UCLA was pressing Ixillie and his
freshman backcourtmate, Peter
Dukes, mercilessly UCLA ripped
into the lead and Lollie again
found himself at the free throw
line. This time it was 68-66, and
there were 43 seconds left.
Lollie iced the pair, and Stan
ford's defense held on for the 70-
69 win. After the game, Coach

Mike Montgomery said every
thing that needed to be said about
the tremendous win:
"Wow."

Card nine finds
No. 1 is fine
Stanford
baseball was ranked
No. 1 most of the
second half of the
season, double
elimination playoff
format is made for
upsets — as most of the other
top regional seeds discovered.
The Card nine, however, were
not going to let Omaha slip away.
True to its play throughout the
entire season, Stanford dominated
the West 1 Region, dropping nary
a contest on the way to its regional
title. Breaking the school baseball
record for most victories in a
season, the team picked up its

53rd, 54th, 55th and 56th wins
in earning its first berth to the
College World Series in two years.
The Pac-10 Southern Division
Champ earned its ticket with solid
play — highlighted by spectacular
pitching and stellar defense. While
overall offensive production was
average, Mike Mussina, Stan
Spencer, and J. R. Reid combined
for a 1.25 ERA to down Campbell
7-1, Midle Tennessee State 6-1,
and San Diego State 6-2 twice.
For pitching the Card to two
victories Mussina was named
Most Outstanding Player. Joining
him on the all-regional team were
center fielder Jeff Hammonds, left
fielder Ryan Turner, Spencer,
first baseman David McCarty and
shortstop Roger Burnett.

Doubles the key
for tennis victory
-n.Going into the
last match of the
season, the Cardi-
Jgr' nal men's tennis
team was reeling.
They started the
season by winning
their first 16 matches. They rarely
played doubles. And not only were
they in position to win their third
consecutive NCAA title, but
people were calling them the best
Cardinal squad ever.
But Stanford then lost a tough
match to California, suffered two
key injuries, and went on to get
hammered by both UCLA and
use.
Stanford's final match of the
regular season was at Cal and the
Cardinal was in dire need of es
tablishing momentum going into
NCAAs.
Stanford did just that. Palmer
returned to action and fell to
Bent-Ove Pedersen, but Alex
O'Brien posted a win at No. 2.
While two other Stanford players
were losing, Alexis Hombredier
used his big serve and crisp
groundstrokes to pull out a three
set win at No. 5 singles.
Once again the decision came
down to doubles.The pressure was
on Hombrecher and Jeff Cathrall,
who were in a tense third set with
Pedersen and Chang. Hombrec
her's big play kept the Cardinal
on serve, and with Chang serving
at 5-5, Stanford broke him.
The freshman served five con
secutive faults to make it 40-30,
but came back with one last big
serve and a couple of shots later
it was game, set, match and team
victory to Stanford.

8 Before the
Stanford women's
basketball team
could be consid

tenders for the
NCAA title, they had to get by
Tennessee. While the rest of the
school was preparing for Autumn
Quarter finals, Jennifer Azzi and
company were busy getting ready
for a much tougher test, the Ten

nessee Lady Vols.
The defending national cham
pions came to Maples Pavilion
eager for the chance to defeat the
unbeaten and No. 2-ranked Car
dinal, who had not yet faced an
opponent with Tennessee's talent
and reputation.
A crowd of over 5,000 highly
partisan fans attended the event
— the largest crowd at Maples
for a women's event at that time.
The Lady Vols were hungry for
an upset and looked as if they
might pull it off when, after trail
ing for the entire game, they
pulled to within a single point
with a few minutes gone in the
second half.
The Cardinal would have none
of it. Paced by 23 points from
Sonja Henning and 20 from
Trisha Stevens, Stanford charged
to an 85-71 victory that upped
the team's record to 11-0, pushed
the women's cagers into national
prominence and gave them the
confidence they needed to capture
the national title.

the Cardinal had two matches left
and a simple scenario: Win both
and go to the playoffs or lose one
and stay home.
After begining the season as the
nation's top-ranked squad, Stan
ford didn't expect thingß to be so
interesting. But an injury to set
ter Parker Blackman and a very
competitive division of its league
made things go down to the wire.
In front of a jam-packed
Burnham Pavilion crowd of 1,412
and a national ESPN audience,
the Cardinal came out of the
blocks on fire.
But the Trojans weren't the na
tion's top team on the basis of
neat uniforms. USC got into a
rythm and ground out games
three and four.
The fifth set was it. After falling
behind 9-4, the Card took over.
A Keefe kill gave Stanford the
lead at 14-13 and served match
point. USC set the nation's top

came up with a dig to his brother.
Parker set it back to Duncan who

Mark Marquess had
high expectations
for the Plainfield, N.J native.
However, nobody could have an
ticipated what happened on April
7. t
Hammonds stepped to the plate
against UCLA's Tim Lindsay with
two men on and the Cardinal trail
ing 3-1. He proceeded to stroke a
3-2 change-up into the left field
seats to put Stanford ahead for
good.
So what, you ask. Clutch hits
are to be expected from a .360
batter, especially one who was
good enough to get drafted out of
high school by the Toronto Blue

Jay 9. Well, not only did Ham
monds' blast propel the Cardinal
to victory, but it also extended his
phenomenal hitting streak to 29
games, a Pacific 10 Southern Con
ference record. He broke the mark
previously held by teammate Troy
Paulsen.
Hammonds would extend his
hitting streak to a Pac-10 record
37 games before being shut down
on April 21 by Arizona Wildcat
pitchers Lance Dickson and Jim
Richardson. Hammonds batted
.385 during the streak.

5 One could hardly
fault the Stanford
basketball team if
they were begining
to feel a bit like the
Washington
Generals. Although
the Cardinal's losing streak was
not in the thousands, the UCLA
Bruins seemed a little like the
Harlem Globetrotters and Pauley
Pavilion was Stanford's personal
hell.
Until Feb. 18, 1990, that is.
The Cardinal had never won in
Pauley and hadn't won a game
at UCLA since 1947 but all that
changed. Despite the fact that the
Bruins were madder than heck
about losing to the Cardinal ear
lier in the year, and the time
before that, and the time before
that.
The visitors took the lead at
7-5 and never relinquished it.
Freshman Marcus Ixillie drew a
charge with 3:51 to go and calmly
stepped to the line for a one-and
one. His first offering rolled
around the rim beforefinally fall
ing, then he swished the second
to give Stanford a 67-56 lead.
Things seemed to be all in favor
of the Cardinal, but that wasn't
actually the case. Four Stanford
played had four fouls each, and
UCLA was pressing Ixillie and his
freshman backcourtmate, Peter
Dukes, mercilessly UCLA ripped
into the lead and Lollie again
found himself at the free throw
line. This time it was 68-66, and
there were 43 seconds left.
Lollie iced the pair, and Stan
ford's defense held on for the 70-
69 win. After the game, Coach

Mike Montgomery said every
thing that needed to be said about
the tremendous win:
"Wow."

Card nine finds
No. 1 is fine
Stanford
baseball was ranked
No. 1 most of the
second half of the
season, double
elimination playoff
format is made for
upsets — as most of the other
top regional seeds discovered.
The Card nine, however, were
not going to let Omaha slip away.
True to its play throughout the
entire season, Stanford dominated
the West 1 Region, dropping nary
a contest on the way to its regional
title. Breaking the school baseball
record for most victories in a
season, the team picked up its

53rd, 54th, 55th and 56th wins
in earning its first berth to the
College World Series in two years.
The Pac-10 Southern Division
Champ earned its ticket with solid
play — highlighted by spectacular
pitching and stellar defense. While
overall offensive production was
average, Mike Mussina, Stan
Spencer, and J. R. Reid combined
for a 1.25 ERA to down Campbell
7-1, Midle Tennessee State 6-1,
and San Diego State 6-2 twice.
For pitching the Card to two
victories Mussina was named
Most Outstanding Player. Joining
him on the all-regional team were
center fielder Jeff Hammonds, left
fielder Ryan Turner, Spencer,
first baseman David McCarty and
shortstop Roger Burnett.

Sports
Doubles the key
for tennis victory
-n.Going into the
last match of the
season, the Cardi-
Jgr' nal men's tennis
team was reeling.
They started the
season by winning
their first 16 matches. They rarely
played doubles. And not only were
they in position to win their third
consecutive NCAA title, but
people were calling them the best
Cardinal squad ever.
But Stanford then lost a tough
match to California, suffered two
key injuries, and went on to get
hammered by both UCLA and
use.
Stanford's final match of the
regular season was at Cal and the
Cardinal was in dire need of es
tablishing momentum going into
NCAAs.
Stanford did just that. Palmer
returned to action and fell to
Bent-Ove Pedersen, but Alex
O'Brien posted a win at No. 2.
While two other Stanford players
were losing, Alexis Hombredier
used his big serve and crisp
groundstrokes to pull out a three
set win at No. 5 singles.
Once again the decision came
down to doubles.The pressure was
on Hombrecher and Jeff Cathrall,
who were in a tense third set with
Pedersen and Chang. Hombrec
her's big play kept the Cardinal
on serve, and with Chang serving
at 5-5, Stanford broke him.
The freshman served five con
secutive faults to make it 40-30,
but came back with one last big
serve and a couple of shots later
it was game, set, match and team
victory to Stanford.

a landmark win
8 Before the
Stanford women's
basketball team
could be consid
ered serious con
tenders for the
NCAA title, they had to get by
Tennessee. While the rest of the
school was preparing for Autumn
Quarter finals, Jennifer Azzi and
company were busy getting ready
for a much tougher test, the Ten

nessee Lady Vols.
The defending national cham
pions came to Maples Pavilion
eager for the chance to defeat the
unbeaten and No. 2-ranked Car
dinal, who had not yet faced an
opponent with Tennessee's talent
and reputation.
A crowd of over 5,000 highly
partisan fans attended the event
— the largest crowd at Maples
for a women's event at that time.
The Lady Vols were hungry for
an upset and looked as if they
might pull it off when, after trail
ing for the entire game, they
pulled to within a single point
with a few minutes gone in the
second half.
The Cardinal would have none
of it. Paced by 23 points from
Sonja Henning and 20 from
Trisha Stevens, Stanford charged
to an 85-71 victory that upped
the team's record to 11-0, pushed
the women's cagers into national
prominence and gave them the
confidence they needed to capture
the national title.

9 Part of the attrac
tion that sport holds
over people is the
black-and-white na
ture. Someone wins,
someone loses and
there usually isn't
much of an argument to be made.
That was the way the regular
season ended for the Stanford
men's volleyball team. Going into
the last weekend of the season,
the Cardinal had two matches left
and a simple scenario: Win both
and go to the playoffs or lose one
and stay home.
After begining the season as the
nation's top-ranked squad, Stan
ford didn't expect thingß to be so
interesting. But an injury to set
ter Parker Blackman and a very
competitive division of its league
made things go down to the wire.
In front of a jam-packed
Burnham Pavilion crowd of 1,412
and a national ESPN audience,
the Cardinal came out of the
blocks on fire.
But the Trojans weren't the na
tion's top team on the basis of
neat uniforms. USC got into a
rythm and ground out games
three and four.
The fifth set was it. After falling
behind 9-4, the Card took over.
A Keefe kill gave Stanford the
lead at 14-13 and served match
point. USC set the nation's top
player but Duncan Blackman
came up with a dig to his brother.
Parker set it back to Duncan who
hit it ... to victory.

to give Stanford a 67-56 lead.
Things seemed to be all in favor
of the Cardinal, but that wasn't
actually the case. Four Stanford
played had four fouls each, and
UCLA was pressing Ixillie and his
freshman backcourtmate, Peter
Dukes, mercilessly UCLA ripped
into the lead and Lollie again
found himself at the free throw
line. This time it was 68-66, and
there were 43 seconds left.
Lollie iced the pair, and Stan
ford's defense held on for the 70-
69 win. After the game, Coach

Mike Montgomery said every
thing that needed to be said about
the tremendous win:
"Wow."

Card nine finds
No. 1 is fine
Stanford
baseball was ranked
No. 1 most of the
second half of the
season, double
elimination playoff
format is made for
upsets — as most of the other
top regional seeds discovered.
The Card nine, however, were
not going to let Omaha slip away.
True to its play throughout the
entire season, Stanford dominated
the West 1 Region, dropping nary
a contest on the way to its regional
title. Breaking the school baseball
record for most victories in a
season, the team picked up its

53rd, 54th, 55th and 56th wins
in earning its first berth to the
College World Series in two years.
The Pac-10 Southern Division
Champ earned its ticket with solid
play — highlighted by spectacular
pitching and stellar defense. While
overall offensive production was
average, Mike Mussina, Stan
Spencer, and J. R. Reid combined
for a 1.25 ERA to down Campbell
7-1, Midle Tennessee State 6-1,
and San Diego State 6-2 twice.
For pitching the Card to two
victories Mussina was named
Most Outstanding Player. Joining
him on the all-regional team were
center fielder Jeff Hammonds, left
fielder Ryan Turner, Spencer,
first baseman David McCarty and
shortstop Roger Burnett.

Doubles the key
for tennis victory
-n.Going into the
last match of the
season, the Cardi-
Jgr' nal men's tennis
team was reeling.
They started the
season by winning
their first 16 matches. They rarely
played doubles. And not only were
they in position to win their third
consecutive NCAA title, but
people were calling them the best
Cardinal squad ever.
But Stanford then lost a tough
match to California, suffered two
key injuries, and went on to get
hammered by both UCLA and
use.
Stanford's final match of the
regular season was at Cal and the
Cardinal was in dire need of es
tablishing momentum going into
NCAAs.
Stanford did just that. Palmer
returned to action and fell to
Bent-Ove Pedersen, but Alex
O'Brien posted a win at No. 2.
While two other Stanford players
were losing, Alexis Hombredier
used his big serve and crisp
groundstrokes to pull out a three
set win at No. 5 singles.
Once again the decision came
down to doubles.The pressure was
on Hombrecher and Jeff Cathrall,
who were in a tense third set with
Pedersen and Chang. Hombrec
her's big play kept the Cardinal
on serve, and with Chang serving
at 5-5, Stanford broke him.
The freshman served five con
secutive faults to make it 40-30,
but came back with one last big
serve and a couple of shots later
it was game, set, match and team
victory to Stanford.

Hoops Volunteers
a landmark win
8 Before the
Stanford women's
basketball team
could be consid
ered serious con
tenders for the
NCAA title, they had to get by
Tennessee. While the rest of the
school was preparing for Autumn
Quarter finals, Jennifer Azzi and
company were busy getting ready
for a much tougher test, the Ten

nessee Lady Vols.
The defending national cham
pions came to Maples Pavilion
eager for the chance to defeat the
unbeaten and No. 2-ranked Car
dinal, who had not yet faced an
opponent with Tennessee's talent
and reputation.
A crowd of over 5,000 highly
partisan fans attended the event
— the largest crowd at Maples
for a women's event at that time.
The Lady Vols were hungry for
an upset and looked as if they
might pull it off when, after trail
ing for the entire game, they
pulled to within a single point
with a few minutes gone in the
second half.
The Cardinal would have none
of it. Paced by 23 points from
Sonja Henning and 20 from
Trisha Stevens, Stanford charged
to an 85-71 victory that upped
the team's record to 11-0, pushed
the women's cagers into national
prominence and gave them the
confidence they needed to capture
the national title.

Spikers rise
to the occasion
9 Part of the attrac
tion that sport holds
over people is the
black-and-white na
ture. Someone wins,
someone loses and
there usually isn't
much of an argument to be made.
That was the way the regular
season ended for the Stanford
men's volleyball team. Going into
the last weekend of the season,
the Cardinal had two matches left
and a simple scenario: Win both
and go to the playoffs or lose one
and stay home.
After begining the season as the
nation's top-ranked squad, Stan
ford didn't expect thingß to be so
interesting. But an injury to set
ter Parker Blackman and a very
competitive division of its league
made things go down to the wire.
In front of a jam-packed
Burnham Pavilion crowd of 1,412
and a national ESPN audience,
the Cardinal came out of the
blocks on fire.
But the Trojans weren't the na
tion's top team on the basis of
neat uniforms. USC got into a
rythm and ground out games
three and four.
The fifth set was it. After falling
behind 9-4, the Card took over.
A Keefe kill gave Stanford the
lead at 14-13 and served match
point. USC set the nation's top
player but Duncan Blackman
came up with a dig to his brother.
Parker set it back to Duncan who
hit it ... to victory.
