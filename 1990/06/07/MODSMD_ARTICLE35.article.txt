# Sailors travel to NCAAs
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Each year, nerds from all over
the country flock to the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
to partake of its alleged academic
excellence. However, this week
end, decided non-techies from
various U. S. schools will gather
there to vie for the National Sail
ing Championship. Stanford will
help represent the west in a 12-
team competition, which sets sail
on the Charles River Friday.
To qualify for nationals, the
Cardinal sailors had to place in
the top two in the district finals.
Joining them will be UC-Irvine,
who emerged victorious in the
western district and is one of the
favorites to take the overall na
tional title. Other serious con
tenders include Old Dominion,
Brown University, and the Naval
Academy.
Because the sailing team has
endured a season filled with set
backs, most notably a drastic re
duction in funding, qualifying for
nationals has been an especially
sweet victory.
"I'm really proud of our team,"
captain Robert Brown said. "The
cuts in the sailing program gave
us reason to concentrate on the
future rather than the present,
but we were able to stay focused

and make it [to nationals]."
Brown will be one of three Car
dinal skippers at this week's event.
Rick Rosen and Scott Dale will
handle the remaining boats,
which will be ere wed by Brady
Sih, Rebecca Bryson, and Julia
Novy.
"Brady is a top candidate for
the Olympics as a skipper," Brown
said. "The fact that he's crew in
this race shows that we have a
lot of talent on this team."
That talent will be put to the
test as the best teams from each
of the seven U. S. sailing districts
will compete. Contrary to popular
belief, the race is not simply won
by whoever has the most ad
vanced boat.
"Sailing races are very tactical,"
Brown said. "It really will boil
down to who has the best sailors,
not who has the best boats."
Each team will race 11 times
over the weekend, once against
each of the other squad. The
school with the best dual-race
record at the end of the competi
tion will be crowned the national
champion.
Brown thinks that the Cardinal
sailors have a good chance of win
ning the title. "We should finish
in the top three, but our goal is
to win," he said. "Rick [Rosen]
and I have had experience at Na
tionals before.
