# Team nets top recruits
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
After losing to Stanford in the
semifinals of this year's NCAA
Tennis Championships, USC
men's tennis coach Dick Leach told
a packed room of newspaper
reporters, "Wait till next year.
We'll get them next year."
But barring the unexpected,
Leach, his Trojans and the rest
of the NCAA, for that matter, may
be running for cover when Stan
ford announces its 1991 lineup.
Leach called this year's Cardinal
squad "one of the best three or
four teams ever assembled."
UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett
agreed.
With three of the top-six ranked
recruits in the United States com
ing to the Farm and only one of
the Cardinal's top-seven graduat
ing, Leach and Bassett may have
a tough time finding words to
describe the 1991 team.
Indeed, Stanford Coach Dick
Gould pulled off another recruit
ing coup, this time garnering
three of the top-six players in the
country including No. 1-ranked
Chris Cocotus of West Palm
Beach, Fla.
The other two recruits, ranked
No. 4 and No. 6 in the United
States, cannot be named because

neither has of yet signed a letter*
of intent. _
More importantly, Stanford's
No. 1 and No. 2 players at the
end of this year, freshmen Jona'
than Stark and Jared Palmer,
have both said they will put ofP
joining the professional tour and*
come back for the 1991 season.
All-Americans Alex O'Brien and*
Jason Yee also will return as
No. 5 player Glenn Solomon, No.
6 player Alexis Hombrecher, dou->
bles specialist Dan Turbow, Ketf>
Pedroza and Roman Sydorak. }
Stanford is losing seniors Jeff
Cathrall, John Connolly, Barrf
Richards and Eric Peus to grad-'
uation. Cathrall started in botlv
singles and doubles on the past"
three NCAA Championship'
teams, playing No. 4 on this year'di
title-winning squad.
Richards, who has been a team*
captain for the past two years,
started in singles on two champiC
onship teams, playing at No. 6P
last year. £
Peus played at No. 2 doubled
for one championship squad£
while Connolly played at No.
for most of this year.
"Barry Richards. Jeff Cathrall#
Eric Peus. John Connolly. Thos%
are big losses, no doubt about it£
Those four guys have contributed*
immensely to our program.^
