# Students try to get their stadium section returned
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
In the latest game of "musical chairs"
in Stanford Stadium, sophomore Dan
Levi and junior Erik Jorgensen are
hoping everybody will win.
Levi, an ASSU senator, and Jorgensen,
Interfraternity Council president, had
separate meetings with Athletic Director
Andy Geiger and ticket manager Konn
Rauschenbach last week. During the ses
sions the students urged Geiger and
Rauschenbach to move the student
section for this fall's football season back
to their longtime location, which in
cludes choice seats along the 50-yard
line.
Levi plans to introduce a bill support
ing the old section at Saturday's ASSU
Senate meeting, and both students are
meeting with Rauschenbach again today.
Rauschenbach said a decision on the
seats will come within the next two
weeks, possibly as soon as today.
The old student section occupied only
the seats closest to the field, with the
seats directly behind them sold to the
public. This rectangular section
stretched from past the 50-yard line to
beyond the east end zone.
Out of concern over tension between
students and the public, Geiger decided
last fall to move the students to a new
square-shaped section, which reaches up
to within three rows of the top of the
stadium. However, these seats begin at
the 35-yard line and end at the east end

zone.
Levi and Jorgensen, who are room
mates, say they represent many stu
dents' concerns that the new section —
which has fewer seats close to the field
and no seats on the 50-yard line — is
less appealing.
The possibility of moving the student
section back to the old configuration
was first raised May 30, when Levi and
Jorgensen met with Geiger for about
two hours. Levi said the meeting was
conciliatory.
To counter the argument about ten
sion and fighting with the public, the
pair asked Geiger for a trial year in the
old arrangement under the new policy
which bans alcohol in the stadium.
Geiger suggested to the pair that grad
uate students and non-fraternity mem
bers would like the new section better.
While Jorgensen said fraternity mem
bers are "overwhelmingly in favor of
the old section," the pair was not sure
if Geiger's idea about the preferences of
the rest of the students was accurate.
So Levi and Jorgensen took to the
streets Tuesday and yesterday, asking
students in White Plaza, as well as Green
and Meyer libraries.
They targeted non-fraternity mem
bers, but otherwise tried to ask "ran
domly," Levi said.
Of the more than 200 students they
interviewed, 88 percent were in favor of
the old seats. The percentage of graduate
students in favor of the old seats was
also more than 80 percent.
