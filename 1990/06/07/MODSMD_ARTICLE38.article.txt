# Chinese singer studying at Stanford
## Education student Agnes Chan compares cross-cultural roles of women 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
"There's an unconscious force within
ourselves preventing us to see and
choose. Sometimes we see the choices
but do not dare to take them. Some
times we choose and are made to feel
guilty." This, according to Agnes Chan,
is the biggest problem facing Japanese
women today.
Chan, a leading pop singer in Japan
and Hong Kong, mother of two and
first-year student at the School of Ed
ucation, came to Stanford last fall to
study education, gender and cross
cultural issues — after raising a huge
controversy in Japan about breast
feeding her son at work.
In February 1987, Chan took her in
fant son to the television studio where
she worked because she wanted to
breast-feed and spend time with him.
This created an uproar in the conser
vative society and prompted Chan to
embark on a study of how educated
Japanese, Chinese and U.S. women
blend family and work demands.
Chan, a Chinese born in Hong Kong,
started her career in the British colony
as a folk singer. At 17, she broke into
the Japanese pop market and later
married her Japanese manager. The
furor she created over her first son
Kazuhei Arthur is still sending ripples
across Japanese society.
"The problem is not resolved yet for
women, but some companies are now
promoting more welfare for mothers,
and a lot of conversation is taking place
among groups. It will be nice if some
good answers come out of it."

'I would have to find a
comfortable feminism
that will work back
home, tying in tradi
tional values and the
whole issue of
caring...
— Agnes Chan

Chan said although more than half
of Japanese mothers work, women are
undervalued. But she is confident the
situation can be changed.
She added that Japanese companies
should provide welfare for working
mothers and their children. In return
for this arrangement, children will even
tually inherit the responsibility of
taking care of the older generation. She
said even a lot of socialist countries
have child care in the work place, and
Japanese companies can definitely af
ford to do the same.
Chan clarified that such a system is
actually very capitalistic because of its
efficiency. "It takes worries off [mot
hers'] backs. The country will be re
sponsible for the kids at the age of six
[when they go to school]. The companies
will only chip in for the first few years."
In Japan, Chan is heavily involved in
educational issues and is the author of
more than a dozen books. She has lec
tured on cross-cultural communication

in a Japanese university and found the
classroom scene at Stanford quite dif
ferent from home.
"I did hold discussion sections, but
[the students] don't respond as well. I
guess they really think inside their own
minds."
"Here, it is a whole different process
— more emphasis on critical thinking
and different ways to look at the world."
Chan is an energetic individual who
still sings, makes television appearances
and does segments for Japanese news
programs while here at Stanford, jug
gling work and her two boys. She gave
birth to her second son Alexander at
Stanford Hospital in November, and he
is now learning his first words.
Chan said she wants her children to
experience different cultures and make
the best use of their opportunities. "If
they do well in adjusting, it will be
something special to them."
Chan's husband just returned to
Japan after visiting her. While she ad
mitted she is sometimes lonely, she said
her experience here is a liberating one.
"I don't have to stand behind my hus
band all the time."
Chan realized western feminism may
not work for Asian women. "I would
have to find a comfortable feminism
that will work back home, tying in tradi
tional values and the whole issue of
caring, cooperation and keeping children
as close to the parents as possible in
public and private places."
Chan is in her second quarter at Stan
ford and plans to finish her studies by
the end of next year. Later this year,
she will record an album in Japan and
release it in Hong Kong.
