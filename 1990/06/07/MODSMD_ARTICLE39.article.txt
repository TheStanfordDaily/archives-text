The prez scores big in Newsweek

Apparently someone out there really likes Don.
Newsweek reports in the June 11 issue that
the University president scored some big points
with Gorby's visit. In its weekly Conventional
Wisdom Watch box, Newsweek reports about Ken
nedy: "Power host got Gorbachev to show up at
Stanford. Very impressive."
Kennedy received a thumbs up for his well
publicized performance.
Other top educators did not fare as well. Amer
ican University's president got a thumbs down
for his guilty plea for making obscene phone
calls. Yale's president also got snubbed because
the "media show horse" has a higher profile in
The New York Times than he does on campus.
Derek Bok, who manages the Stanford of the
East, was given a neutral rating. "No fin
gerprints," his Newsweek report card reads.
"Resigns after 20 years as Harvard's Gerald
Ford."
While he was somewhat cool to being given all
the credit for bringing the Soviet president to
campus, Kennedy was furious when he heard
Bok's characterization in Newsweek.
"Jesus Christ. That is just so stupid," he said
in anger. "He was just such a wonderful presi
dent."
You gotta figure Bok can't be all bad. He's a
Stanford alum.

Six Macs stolen from Sweet
Six Macintosh II computers with color
monitors, worth more than $20,000, were likely
stolen from the first floor Sweet Hall late last
week.
The computers, which were locked down, dis
appeared sometime between 3:30 a.m. and 10
a.m. Friday morning. Other equipment, such as
a videodisk plater and a television monitor, were
left in the room.
Police found no evidence of a forced entry.
Although they thought it highly unlikely, Sweet
Hall personnel could not rule out the possibility
that the manager of those computers, who has
been away on vacation since last week, lent the
computers to someone else.
"It seems that more people had access to the
room than should have had," said George
Drapeau, a system programmer.
Chevron gives big money
Chevron Corporation has pledged $1 million
over four years to Stanford for student fellow
ships, faculty research and earthquake recovery.

According to University President Donald Ken
nedy, $300,000 of the grant will will be used for
earthquake repair and construction by the School
of Earth Sciences. After the Oct. 17 earthquake
damaged the old geology building, 52 students
and professors lost their offices and had to move
into temporary modulars.
The remaining $700,000 will go toward faculty
research and student fellowships.
W. Gary Ernst, dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, expressed appreciation for the Chevron
pledge, adding Chevron has long supported the
geosciences at Stanford. Chevron has not only
donated money, but has had scientists serve as
adjunct faculty and executives serve on the School
of Earth Sciences' Advisory Board.
15 named public service fellows
Instead of tanning at the beach or working at
McDonald's this summer, 15 Stanford students
will participate in jobs ranging from creating
programs for young Indian women distributing
AIDS information to working with the homeless.
They are recipients of Public Service Summer
Fellowships, a 7-year-old program that offers
funding to students who develop and implement
innovative community service projects that ad
dress needs in underserved communities.
Fellows are freshman Shannon Bard, coter
minal student Christine Brady, sophomore Chris
tina Godinho, sophomore Rachel Hartshorn,
sophomore Ariane Hoy, freshman Angelique Jack
son, senior Thanakorn Jirasevyinda, sophomore
Helen Kim, junior Rena Kramer, sophomore Om
phemetse Mooki, junior Elan Nguyen, freshman
Giselle Perez de la Garza, freshman Wai Poc,
senior Christie Riggins and junior Belen
Rodriguez.
U.S. Census Bureau needs help
The U.S. Census Bureau is struggling to find
enough workers to cover the Stanford, Palo Alto,
Mountain View and Cupertino area.
The reason for the need is that only about 70
percent of those living in the area have returned
their census forms. The government will person
ally visit all those who do not fill out forms.
The need is so bad that the Census Bureau is
looking to hire more than 100 such enumerators
in the county for part-time or full-time employ
ment. "It's a dire need," said Rick Carreiro, a
Santa Clara census employee.
The bureau is looking for people who can work
until August, starting as soon as possible, at pay
of at least $7.50 per hour. Anybody interested
should call (408) 748-2800.
