# Apparent mistranslation explains heavy praise for science

### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
When Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev spoke in Memorial Auditorium
Monday, he upset many social science
scholars and students because he con
centrated so much praise on scientists
and scientific research.
But did he really say what most people
heard?

The answer, say scholars who speak
Russian, is no. Gorbachev was appar
ently the victim of a mistranslation
which may have depicted him as a
humanities-hater.
Gorbachev hailed nauchnyi research
and uchenyi, which was translated as
scientific research and scientists. How
ever, people listening to a more accurate
translation would have heard Gorba
chev praising scholarly research and

scholars.
"If there's a translator's error, that's
terrific," said University President
Donald Kennedy, who said he has heard
rumblings that humanities scholars felt
slighted.
Among those who were listening to
Gorbachev's speech in Russian and
noticed the gaffe were junior Susan
McKean and Political Science Prof. Da
vid Holloway.
