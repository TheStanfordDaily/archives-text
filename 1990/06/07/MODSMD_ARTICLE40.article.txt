# Missing tests reappear in Spain

### David Bianco Staff writer 
Twelve qualifying examinations
that disappeared from the Statis
tics Department May 21 surfaced
in Valencia, Spain and have since
been returned to the Farm. Both
the disappearance and the reap
pearance are shrouded in mystery.
The five-hour tests, which ar
rived in the department's Monday
mail, are a mandatory step on the
road to a doctoral degree. A retest
scheduled for Saturday was not
canceled because at the time the
department did not have the tests
in hand, according to Statistics

Chair Jerome Friedman.
Friedman said an unknown per
son sent the tests overseas to Jose
Bernardo, who taught in the de
partment during the summer of
1987. Bernardo received the tests
with a note that he should send
them back to the department
before July, after he was
"finished" with them. Friedman
said it was unclear what Bernardo
was supposed to do to the tests,
but he said they were not tam
pered with when they were re
turned.
Both the original tests and the
retests, along with other criteria,
were used to determine who

passed, a decision that was an
nounced Tuesday.
Friedman said it is "still a mys
tery" why they were stolen and
why they were sent to Spain. But
he was relieved that the tests were
found and the department could
move on. "This was an unfortu
nate episode, but I'm glad we got
through it,"he said.
Adi Wyner, one of the students
who took the test twice, said he
wasn't angry about the mix-up.
He said he was prepared the first
time and did not have to study
for the second test. "I just wanted
the whole thing to blow over," he
said.
