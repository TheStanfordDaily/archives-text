The quarterly Dean's Award for Service has been
renamed the James W. Lyons Award for Service.
Lyons, who will retire at the end of August, created
the award in 1981 to recognize students who have
made extraordinary contributions to the Stanford
community.
This spring's 10 recipients include three Arroyo
House resident assistants who worked to bring civil
rights activist Rosa Parks to campus winter quarter.
Seniors Eric Loh, Matthew McLeod and Ashley Ryan
organized the "Thank You Sister Rosa Parks" pro
gram, held in Memorial Auditorium Feb. 19.
Juniors Jennifer Steele and d'Layne Kerr were
honored for their role in strengthening the Together
Each Accomplishes More program, as coordinators.
Corey Davis, a junior nuyoring in drama and
African and Afro-American studies, was recognized
for a variety of accomplishments.
Michael Rubenstein, a senior history major, was
recognized for his leadership role in organizing the
Kappa Alpha Mud Volleyball Classic.
The Daily received an award, presented jointly to
three of its editors in chief, for "providing a spirited
and principled op-ed page, terrific sports coverage
and cartoons, content-free weather reports and even
generic news ... and for its more elusive role in
creating a campus community by identifying and
uniting the members through its pages."
