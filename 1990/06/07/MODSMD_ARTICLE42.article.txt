A man posing as a graduate student
researching muscle fibers has made sexual
advances toward several student athletes, in
cluding wrestlers, gymnasts, and track and
field athletes.
The man, whom students described as a
polite 5-foot-8-inch black, entered students'
rooms and locker rooms, claiming he was
researching muscle fibers. He had at least a
basic familiarity with muscle fiber structure.
"He sounds like he's really a physiology stu
dent," said one top student athlete.
Jason Robinson, a freshman track and field
athlete, said the man approached him in his
room, locked the door behind him and said
Robinson could earn as much as $1,500 by
participating in the study of muscle fiber. After
asking a few preliminary questions about
height, weight and body-fat percentage, the
man asked to "test" a few of Robinson's
muscles.
After feeling his chest and calf muscles, the
"researcher" said some of the experiments in
volved Robinson's flexing certain muscles while
he lie on top. At least three other students
reported the same experience with the man.
The unidentified man warned the athletes
that his research was weird. "Your girlfriend
may not appreciate this," the man said to one
student.
