# Afro-American chair selected

### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
After months of uncertainty,
the search committee for a new
African and Afro-American
Studies chair has selected Horace
Porter, associate professor of Eng
lish and Afro-American studies at
Dartmouth College, to fill the va
cancy.
Porter has not formally ac
cepted the offer, but committee
chair and Assoc. Linguistics Prof.
John Rickford said he expects the
confirmation this month.
Porter was not available for
comment yesterday.
Rickford said the committee has
heard excellent reports on Porter's
teaching. Committee member
Clayton Bates, professor of mate
rials science and electrical engi
neering, said Porter possesses a
combination of talents that other
candidates lack.
"His interests and scholarship
are more toward Afro-Americans
as opposed to Caribbeans or
Africans," which helped make him
a strong candidate, according to
Bates.

Porter joined the Dartmouth
faculty in 1979. He holds three
degrees in American Studies: a
B.A. from Amherst College in
1972, a masters in 1975 and a
Ph.D. in 1981. He earned his
masters and Ph.D. from Yale Uni
versity, where he specialized in
19th- and 20th-century American
literature.
He is also associate dean of the
faculty for academic programs at
Dartmouth and is responsible for
the college's interdisciplinary ac
ademic programs such as African
and Afro-American Studies, Asian
Studies, Comparative Literature
and Environmental Studies.
In 1989, Porter published his
first book, "Stealing the Fire: The
Art and Protest of James
Baldwin." Many regarded Porter's
work as the best on Baldwin so
far, said Rickford. Baldwin was
an Afro-American novelist.
Bates said Assoc. History Prof.
Kennell Jackson, who had been
director of the program for many
years, stepped down a year ago
because it was a drain from his
other scholarly activities. "There's
probably a need for fresh ideas,"

he added.
The committee advertised the
position last fall in a number of
academic publications, in the
African and Afro-American
Studies departments of various
universities and in the School of
Humanities and Sciences at Stan
ford.
Rickford said there were about
80 applications, and in the end
three candidates were invited to
Stanford for interviews. The offer
to Porter was made this quarter,
but Rickford said he anticipates
strenuous efforts on Dartmouth's
part to retain him because of the
excellent positions he holds there.
Should Porter accept the offer,
he will be placed in the English
Department. "The department is
very excited to have him come,"
Bates said.
Members of the 13-person
search committee include Political
Science Prof, and Director of
African Studies David Abernethy,
Afro-American and African
Studies Coordinator Earl Black,
Assoc. History Prof. Richard
Roberts and Sociology Prof. Mor
ris Zelditch.
