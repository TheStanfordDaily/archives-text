# Not all are pleased with Gorbachev
## 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
As they parted with the Soviet members of
the Stanford-Soviet Exchange Project, Stan
ford members of the project thought they had
heard their last few Russian phrases until
September. But a month later, they heard the
familiar zdrastwujte (welcome) again — this
time from Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev.
But Tatyana Kletskova, an exchange stu
dent from Novosibirsk State University in
Siberia, would not have been on the welcome
wagon.
One of the first things she said about Gor
bachev during her stay at Stanford was that
not many people like him. Five years ago,
everyone was optimistic about the Soviet
leader; now they are skeptical.
Students from Novosibirsk probably would
not have bought scalped tickets to see him.
Gagik Mkrchan, professor of economics at

Novosibirsk, was the adviser for the group of
15 Soviet students. Asked about Gorbachev's
visit to Stanford, he said, "Before we came
over, no one heard about the University. The
exchange gave people a much better idea of
what Stanford is all about."
The reason for Gorbachev's visit was un
certain. "If he's not going to Hoover, I'm not
sure why. Perhaps he's going to develop cul
tural ties," said Mkrchan.
Mkrchan also said there is talk in Moscow
of making reforms in the organization of
higher education.
"If 1 were to ask him a question, I would
ask, 'Will there be serious changes in the
structure of higher education, not just cos
metic ones?'" Mkrchan said.
Carolyn Frazier, a Stanford exchange par
ticipant, said that had the Soviets still been
at Stanford, they probably "would have been
interested in seeing Gorbachev and amused
at the whole-hearted reception that the stu
dents gave him."

But the Soviets would not have been
satisfied with shaking his hand. "The Soviets
felt that Americans were quick to accept him
and turn him into a hero. Soviets would have
been more demanding and wanted concrete
words," said Frazier.
After working on the exchange for a year,
Pete Hopkins, director of the project, did not
receive a ticket. "I wouldn't stay in line to
get one, and I would never buy a scalped
ticket," he said. "I think Gorbachev is a master
politician. As we sit and praise him as cheer
leaders, we must not lose sight of the issues.
There are still dissidents in jail, no complete
freedom of speech and still no travel abroad."
While Gorbachev left California after just
another business trip, Kletskova left having
experienced much more. In a letter to Stanford
students, she wrote, "When we were flying
home, I didn't care whether the plane will
fall and break or not. I had a feeling that the
most important part of my life have gone —
I mean these two weeks in America."
