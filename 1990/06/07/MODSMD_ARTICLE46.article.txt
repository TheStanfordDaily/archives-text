# The
						founder of glasnost has his own history

The man who arrived on the
front steps of the Stanford Quad
Monday has been dramatically
reshaping history for the past five
years as the leader of the Soviet
Union.
No less interesting is the story
of Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev's ascent through the ranks
of the Communist Party prior to
1985.
The son of a Russian peasant,
Gorbachev was born in 1931 and
first worked at a machine-tractor
station in his home region of Stav
ropol, near the Black Sea. At the
age of 21 he entered the Moscow
State University law school and
joined the Communist Party. In
a significant move, Gorbachev
then became an organizer for
Komsomol, a communist youth
organization, in the Khruschev
era.
Gorbachev rose steadily
through the ranks of the party
and demonstrated a deep interest
in the theories and realities of

agriculture, much in the spirit of
Leo Tolstoy's popular fictional
character Nikolai Levin.
Gorbachev distinguished him
self with a degree in agricultural
economics which he earned
through a correspondence course.
In 1970, his work was rewarded;
he was named first secretary of
the Stavropol region and was
thereby brought into the Central
Committee.
The next great change in Gor
bachev's life was his 1978 move
to Moscow, where he took on the
post of party secretary for agricul
ture. In 1980 he became a full
member of the Politburo, the only
member with legal training and
the only graduate of the pres
tigious Moscow University.
Gorbachev's subsequent rise to
power was greatly aided by the
policies of his mentor, former So
viet President Yuri Andropov.
Andropov used Gorbachev in
many of his strategies, including
a tough campaign against high
level corruption.
Eventually, nine of 23 Central
Committee department heads and

one-fifth of regional first secre
taries were brought down on cor
ruption charges with the help of
Gorbachev, who remained
Andropov's main ally until the lat
ter's death in 1984.
According to most reports, as
he neared death Andropov
delegated more of his responsibil
ities to Gorbachev. When
Andropov died, the Politburo
decided against moving up the
comparatively young Gorbachev
until after the death of the ailing
Chernenko.
Although it was not clear what
political positions the 54-year-old
Gorbachev would take at the start
of his reign, he soon made an
impact on Western leaders and
gave promise of fundamental
changes.
In a surprisingly successful trip
to Britain in 1985, Gorbachev
showed a side many Western
leaders did not expect from a
leader of the Soviet Union but
would learn to appreciate. His
candor, sense of humor and in
quisitive manner caused British
Prime Minister Margaret

Thatcher, one of the most conser
vative Western leaders, to com
ment prophetically, "I like Mr.
Gorbachev. We can do business
together."
His twin policies of glasnost,
openness, and perestroika, eco
nomic restructuring, at the fore
front of a new intellectual
movement in Soviet policy, have
stirred hope around the world for
more peaceful relations.
Significant improvements in So
viet prosperity have yet to be
made, however, and Gorbachev
still faces major opposition from
both conservatives and liberals,
who see him as either too permis
sive or not permissive enough.
In February Gorbachev virtu
ally ended the political monopoly
of the Communist Party as he
transferred greater powers to the
Presidency. However, he has in
creasingly come under fire from
hard-liners and reformers such as
Boris Yeltsin, who have recently
been gaining power.
In addition, Gorbachev faces
strong independence movements
in the Baltic States.
