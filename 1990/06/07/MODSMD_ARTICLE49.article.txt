# For the record

### 
In a letter to the editor in the
May 31 issue, The Daily inadver
tently left out brackets in a quote
by coterminal student Perry
Friedman. Sairus Patel's letter
should have quoted Friedman:
"Stanford has a stick so far up
its ass it can't even see straight,
[pun (hopefully) not intended.)"
The Daily regrets the error.
