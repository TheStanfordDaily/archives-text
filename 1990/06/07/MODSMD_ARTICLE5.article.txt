# Paint in hand, seniors tackle Quad eyesores

Since the Oct. 17 earthquake, many have viewed
the wooden arch supports around the Quad as
eyesores. Seven Stanford design students decided to
do something about it.
By Commencement on June 17, the students .hope
to finish painting 14 structures in the Quad, in
cluding 12 arch bracings. The supports will be in
place until the necessary structural repairs can be
made over the next several years, according to senior
Scott Weiss, the project's organizer.
Senior Kristin Ding is painting an arch adjacent
to Memorial Church with an enlargement of a detail
from the Church's facade. "I have always been fas
cinated by the mosaic," she said. "This is my chance
to do something with it."
Although many passers-by last weekend thought
the arches were being painted for Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit, Weiss said the project
was meant as a Commencement gift to the campus.
Senior David Menninger said, "We did hope to
have more painted by the [Gorbachev] weekend, but
it is taking surprisingly long." Each arch is expected
to take about 20 to 25 hours to complete.
The artists began painting two weeks ago and
will receive academic credit for their work. They
started seeking the necessary funding, equipment
and permission more than a month ago, according
to Weiss.
The project will cost more than $1,000. Funding
will come mainly from a Design Fund established
last year by Art Prof. Matt Kahn. Kahn used his
commissions from selling his works at a gallery
show last year to set up the fund.
The students formulated the idea for the project
in Kahn's Design Synthesis class. Menninger said
design synthesis is "exploring where different
aspects of art, design and architecture meet and
overlap."
Menninger's arch, which he designed on a com
puter and printed on a color printer, will have green,
yellow and orange "geometric shapes imitating some
of the aspects of Hoover Tower," he said.
The group encountered some problems finding
equipment, particularly ladders which were tall
enough. The ladders also needed to be self
supporting, to protect the sandstone of the Quad
and the supporting columns.
