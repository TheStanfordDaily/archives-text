# Budget-cutting plan close to completion
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
After more than four months
of work, the budget repositioning
steering committee is close to
completing the first stage of its
plan to trim $22 million from
Stanford's budget.
Provost James Rosse an
nounced yesterday the committee
has approved most of the budget
cuts proposed by individual de
partments.
However, the details of the im
plementation of the repositioning
effort, including the exact number
of staff members that will be laid
off, have not yet been worked out.

Rosse said layoffs will generally
not be announced before June 15,
and none will be made before
Sept. 1.
In one of the few changes from
preliminary budget cut proposals,
the Stanford Overseas program
in Tours will probably not be
closed, Rosse said.
The Overseas Studies program
suggested closing Tours as a
means of cutting a budget deficit
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Rosse said the committee
decided to postpone a decision on
Tours because it needed more
time to assess alternatives to
closing it.
Because the committee has not
finished examining the proposals,
few details about other budget
cuts have been released.
In addition to the specific mon
etary cuts, the committee also has
been contemplating several Action
Plan for Change proposals to re
organize parts of the University
administration.
One of the departments that
will undergo msyor changes is the
office of Administrative Re
sources, and in particular, the of
fice of Human Resources.
In addition to facing a 30 per
cent budget cut, one of the largest
in the University, Human Re
sources is also the subject of a
reorganization proposal by an Ac
tion Plan for Change task force.
Because the reorganization pro
posal was only recently completed,
the Human Resources staff has
not yet addressed all the specifics
of meeting the budget cut, accord
ing to Human Resources Director
Sally Clevenger.
The Action Plan for Change
proposal recommends the creation
of the position of a vice president
for Human Resources and the
decentralization of some of its
functions, said Vice President for
Administrative Resources Su
SchafTer.
In creating the new position,

the committee hopes to pull to
gether all of the elements of
Human Resources, SchafTer said.
"There isn't anyone (on the vice
presidential level) who speaks just
for employee issues," she added.
The position would give human
resources "the same weight as fa
cilities, and money," Clevenger
noted.
The decentralization of Human
Resources would involve sending
some of the Human Resources
specialists into the field, where
they can work more directly with
the individual departments,
Clevenger said.
Clevenger said she hopes spe
cialists in the field will deal with
most of the day-to-day personnel
and employee relations issues now
handled by the central Human Re
sources office. Computerizing
some of the record keeping would
also help streamline the central
office, she added.
The central office will be more
responsible for overall policy de
velopment and analysis, Clevenger
said. It will continue to handle
Human Resources staff training.
Most of these changes will prob
ably take place over the next few
years, if they are approved by the
committee and the Board of Trus
tees, Clevenger said.
Although their changes may not
be as dramatic as those in Human
Resources, the other departments
of Administrative Resources will
undergo some changes.
In the Office of Housing and
Food Service, the food service in
Wilbur, Stern and Florence Moore

Halls may be converted to a point
system like the one currently at
Ricker Dining Center. This change
would not take effect until Sep
tember 1991, Schaffer said.
At the same time, weekend food
services and weekday breakfast
would be consolidated. The man
agement and support staff might
also be restructured, Schaffer
said.
In Operations and Mainte
nance, Schaffer said maintenance
staff might be reorganized into
teams responsible for particular
groups of buildings. Under the
new system, the maintenance
staff would be more efficient be
cause it would be more familiar
with the buildings, she said.
Cuts in other Administrative
Resources departments will
mostly involve consolidating man
agement and eliminating vacant
staff positions.
The committee is also reviewing
three other Action Plan for
Change proposals for reorganizing
the library management, the con
troller's office and facilities man
agement.
Rosse said he expects most of
these recommendations to be in
place by next fall.
Overall, these changes will
make the University more
streamlined, Rosse said. Although
the University may create two
new positions — vice presidents
for Student Resources and
Human Resources — the number
of high-level administrators will
ultimately be reduced, he added.
One of the goals of the

repositioning effort has been to
make the individual deans assume
more responsibility for their own
units and for the University as a
whole, Rosse said.
As part of this effort, University
President Donald Kennedy plans
to abolish the current Adminis
trative Council of vice presidents
and replace it with a University
cabinet of department deans.
Rosse said he feels the commit
tee has been successful in meeting
its five original goals. In addition
to cutting $22 million from the
budget and beginning the reor
ganization process, the committee
has limited the rate of tuition in
crease and limited the indirect
cost rate for research to 78 per
cent.
The committee also has slowed
the University's building pro
gram, except for the construction
of Kimball Hall, the new under
graduate dorm, and earthquake
repairs, Rosse added.
However, Rosse said he does not
feel that the budget repositioning
process is finished. How well the
reorganization is implemented
will determine the ultimate suc
cess of the process.
"If we can't complete the job
of reorganization, (the budget
cuts) will be a short-term fix," he
said. "In three to five years, we'd
have to do it again."
But "if we spend the next six
to 12 months putting into place
the changes, we could be good for
five to 10 years, maybe longer,"
he added.

closed, Rosse said.
The Overseas Studies program
suggested closing Tours as a
means of cutting a budget deficit
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Rosse said the committee
decided to postpone a decision on
Tours because it needed more
time to assess alternatives to
closing it.
Because the committee has not
finished examining the proposals,
few details about other budget
cuts have been released.
In addition to the specific mon
etary cuts, the committee also has
been contemplating several Action
Plan for Change proposals to re
organize parts of the University
administration.
One of the departments that
will undergo msyor changes is the
office of Administrative Re
sources, and in particular, the of
fice of Human Resources.
In addition to facing a 30 per
cent budget cut, one of the largest
in the University, Human Re
sources is also the subject of a
reorganization proposal by an Ac
tion Plan for Change task force.
Because the reorganization pro
posal was only recently completed,
the Human Resources staff has
not yet addressed all the specifics
of meeting the budget cut, accord
ing to Human Resources Director
Sally Clevenger.
The Action Plan for Change
proposal recommends the creation
of the position of a vice president
for Human Resources and the
decentralization of some of its
functions, said Vice President for
Administrative Resources Su
SchafTer.
In creating the new position,

the committee hopes to pull to
gether all of the elements of
Human Resources, SchafTer said.
"There isn't anyone (on the vice
presidential level) who speaks just
for employee issues," she added.
The position would give human
resources "the same weight as fa
cilities, and money," Clevenger
noted.
The decentralization of Human
Resources would involve sending
some of the Human Resources
specialists into the field, where
they can work more directly with
the individual departments,
Clevenger said.
Clevenger said she hopes spe
cialists in the field will deal with
most of the day-to-day personnel
and employee relations issues now
handled by the central Human Re
sources office. Computerizing
some of the record keeping would
also help streamline the central
office, she added.
The central office will be more
responsible for overall policy de
velopment and analysis, Clevenger
said. It will continue to handle
Human Resources staff training.
Most of these changes will prob
ably take place over the next few
years, if they are approved by the
committee and the Board of Trus
tees, Clevenger said.
Although their changes may not
be as dramatic as those in Human
Resources, the other departments
of Administrative Resources will
undergo some changes.
In the Office of Housing and
Food Service, the food service in
Wilbur, Stern and Florence Moore

Halls may be converted to a point
system like the one currently at
Ricker Dining Center. This change
would not take effect until Sep
tember 1991, Schaffer said.
At the same time, weekend food
services and weekday breakfast
would be consolidated. The man
agement and support staff might
also be restructured, Schaffer
said.
In Operations and Mainte
nance, Schaffer said maintenance
staff might be reorganized into
teams responsible for particular
groups of buildings. Under the
new system, the maintenance
staff would be more efficient be
cause it would be more familiar
with the buildings, she said.
Cuts in other Administrative
Resources departments will
mostly involve consolidating man
agement and eliminating vacant
staff positions.
The committee is also reviewing
three other Action Plan for
Change proposals for reorganizing
the library management, the con
troller's office and facilities man
agement.
Rosse said he expects most of
these recommendations to be in
place by next fall.
Overall, these changes will
make the University more
streamlined, Rosse said. Although
the University may create two
new positions — vice presidents
for Student Resources and
Human Resources — the number
of high-level administrators will
ultimately be reduced, he added.
One of the goals of the

repositioning effort has been to
make the individual deans assume
more responsibility for their own
units and for the University as a
whole, Rosse said.
As part of this effort, University
President Donald Kennedy plans
to abolish the current Adminis
trative Council of vice presidents
and replace it with a University
cabinet of department deans.
Rosse said he feels the commit
tee has been successful in meeting
its five original goals. In addition
to cutting $22 million from the
budget and beginning the reor
ganization process, the committee
has limited the rate of tuition in
crease and limited the indirect
cost rate for research to 78 per
cent.
The committee also has slowed
the University's building pro
gram, except for the construction
of Kimball Hall, the new under
graduate dorm, and earthquake
repairs, Rosse added.
However, Rosse said he does not
feel that the budget repositioning
process is finished. How well the
reorganization is implemented
will determine the ultimate suc
cess of the process.
"If we can't complete the job
of reorganization, (the budget
cuts) will be a short-term fix," he
said. "In three to five years, we'd
have to do it again."
But "if we spend the next six
to 12 months putting into place
the changes, we could be good for
five to 10 years, maybe longer,"
he added.
After more than four months
of work, the budget repositioning
steering committee is close to
completing the first stage of its
plan to trim $22 million from
Stanford's budget.
Provost James Rosse an
nounced yesterday the committee
has approved most of the budget
cuts proposed by individual de
partments.
However, the details of the im
plementation of the repositioning
effort, including the exact number
of staff members that will be laid
off, have not yet been worked out.

Rosse said layoffs will generally
not be announced before June 15,
and none will be made before
Sept. 1.
In one of the few changes from
preliminary budget cut proposals,
the Stanford Overseas program
in Tours will probably not be
closed, Rosse said.

suggested closing Tours as a
means of cutting a budget deficit
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
