After more than four months
of work, the budget repositioning
steering committee is close to
completing the first stage of its
plan to trim $22 million from
Stanford's budget.
Provost James Rosse an
nounced yesterday the committee
has approved most of the budget
cuts proposed by individual de
partments.
However, the details of the im
plementation of the repositioning
effort, including the exact number
of staff members that will be laid
off, have not yet been worked out.

Rosse said layoffs will generally
not be announced before June 15,
and none will be made before
Sept. 1.
In one of the few changes from
preliminary budget cut proposals,
the Stanford Overseas program
in Tours will probably not be
closed, Rosse said.
The Overseas Studies program
suggested closing Tours as a
means of cutting a budget deficit
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Rosse said the committee
decided to postpone a decision on
Tours because it needed more
