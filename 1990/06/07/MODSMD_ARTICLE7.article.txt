# Class of 1994 compiled

### David Bianco Staff writer 
After going to its wait list twice,
Stanford has finally reached its
target of 1,600 freshmen entrants
for next fall, according to Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter.
Due largely to a sharp increase
in the number of Asian-
Americans entrants, the class has
the largest percentage of minority
students in the history of Stan
ford. But many in the University
are concerned that the number of
blacks in the class has fallen sig
nificantly.
Fetter, who emphasized that all
her numbers are preliminary and
subject to change over the sum
mer, said that as of Monday the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions had confirmations from
1,607 graduating high school sen
iors, with almost 50 still not
reporting their decisions.
She said she was "very pleased"
the Admissions Office had
reached its target. Fetter and her

staff admitted
200 students
from the wait list
in two 100-
student "batches"
during a year in
which speculation
was widespread
that the earth
quake had hurt
the University's

efforts to admit a top-notch class.
Fetter said the preliminary
class is 54.2 percent white, 23.5
percent Asian-American, 11.3 per
cent Mexican-American fcnd other
Hispanic, 6.6 percent black, 3.1
percent foreign and 1.2 percent
Native American. In all, 42.6 per
cent of the class of 1994 is made
up of minority students, the lar
gest number ever.
Much of the increase in minor
ity admissions comes from Asian-
American students, who made up
18.1 percent of 1989's entering
class and 16 percent of 1988's en
tering class. The news of this in


Fetter
crease of Asian-Americans at
Stanford has been met with en
thusiasm in the Asian-American
community here.
Glsa Tsutaoka, staffer at the
Asian American Activities Center,
called the increase "great" and
said it showed an improvement
over the "policy of unconscious
bias" she said guided admissions
at Stanford a few years ago. But
she warned that Stanford should
also be concerned with Asian na
tionalities and socio-economic
groups that are underrepresented
here.
Tsutaoka pointed to the Filipino
community, which she said is the
largest Asian group in the United
States. Filipino students are ad
mitted at a much lower rate than
students of Chinese, Korean, Jap

anese or Vietnamese descent, she
said. "It has to do with the fact
that Filipinos and Pacific
Islanders tend to be in lower socio
economic brackets."
The increase in Asian-American
students is likely to have a
profound effect on the Stanford
community, Tsutaoka said. She
said the community is "very com
plicated" and that the more than
30 organizations for Asian-
American students here are likely
going to need more money and
staff help. She also said organi
zations are likely to form as more
Asian-American students attend
Stanford.
Asian American Student Asso
ciation chair Ed Morimoto sug
gested the increase was a result
of "people hearing that Stanford
is making more efforts toward
being a more truly multicultural
university."
But multiculturalism includes
a wide variety of ethnic groups,

and many students and staff are
concerned that the increase in
Asian-American and Chi
cano/Latino students in the Class
of 1994 is accompanied by a con
tinued decrease in the number of
black students.
Fetter expressed concern about
this drop. She said almost every
school, including the University
of California system, was express
ing concern about a nationwide
decline in black applications and
blacks enrolling in college.
Reaction in the black commu
nity was largely one of disappoint
ment.
"We're very concerned about
this trend," said Keith Archuleta,
director of the Black Community
Services Center.
"It's kind of scary," said Nelda
Brown, an officer of the Black
Student Union. Brown and Ar
chuleta both identified recruit
ment and financial aid as two
main causes of the declining black

enrollment.
Archuleta said the Admissions
Office needs to expand its recruit
ment efforts beyond "the prep
schools and large high schools" it
currently targets to include
schools more blacks attend, such
as those in the South and in "non
traditional pipelines" such as city
colleges, community colleges and
all-black areas.
But Fetter said the Admissions
Office faces a 13 percent budget
cut, which could lead to less travel
by the admissions staff, along
with a mayor reduction in the bro
chure "Stanford Today."
Archuleta also said one way the
Admissions Office could increase
black enrollment would be to "find
and admit black students who ac
cording to sheer numbers don't
look like they can make it here,
but are qualified in all other ways
to be here."
He cited "persistence" as the
single most important factor in

academic success and suggested
the University admit more black
students whose persistence could
outweigh deficiencies in their past
academic preparation.
"I don't think the Admissions
Office is willing to take the risks
that are necessary to bring in
greater numbers of black stu
dents," Archuleta said.
He also mentioned publicity
over the Western Culture debate
two years ago and last year's
Ujamaa incident — which in
volved the posting of a racially
offensive flier in the black theme
house — as deterrents to black
applicants. Admitted students, as
well as their parents, worry about
"the issue of safety and respect
for black students."
The Admissions staff is cur
rently on a two-and-a-half-day
retreat during which it will decide
next year's essay questions, as
well as other details of the admis
sions process.

thusiasm in the Asian-American
community here.
Glsa Tsutaoka, staffer at the
Asian American Activities Center,
called the increase "great" and
said it showed an improvement
over the "policy of unconscious
bias" she said guided admissions
at Stanford a few years ago. But
she warned that Stanford should
also be concerned with Asian na
tionalities and socio-economic
groups that are underrepresented
here.
Tsutaoka pointed to the Filipino
community, which she said is the
largest Asian group in the United
States. Filipino students are ad
mitted at a much lower rate than
students of Chinese, Korean, Jap

anese or Vietnamese descent, she
said. "It has to do with the fact
that Filipinos and Pacific
Islanders tend to be in lower socio
economic brackets."
The increase in Asian-American
students is likely to have a
profound effect on the Stanford
community, Tsutaoka said. She
said the community is "very com
plicated" and that the more than
30 organizations for Asian-
American students here are likely
going to need more money and
staff help. She also said organi
zations are likely to form as more
Asian-American students attend
Stanford.
Asian American Student Asso
ciation chair Ed Morimoto sug
gested the increase was a result
of "people hearing that Stanford
is making more efforts toward
being a more truly multicultural
university."
But multiculturalism includes
a wide variety of ethnic groups,

and many students and staff are
concerned that the increase in
Asian-American and Chi
cano/Latino students in the Class
of 1994 is accompanied by a con
tinued decrease in the number of
black students.
Fetter expressed concern about
this drop. She said almost every
school, including the University
of California system, was express
ing concern about a nationwide
decline in black applications and
blacks enrolling in college.
Reaction in the black commu
nity was largely one of disappoint
ment.
"We're very concerned about
this trend," said Keith Archuleta,
director of the Black Community
Services Center.
"It's kind of scary," said Nelda
Brown, an officer of the Black
Student Union. Brown and Ar
chuleta both identified recruit
ment and financial aid as two
main causes of the declining black

enrollment.
Archuleta said the Admissions
Office needs to expand its recruit
ment efforts beyond "the prep
schools and large high schools" it
currently targets to include
schools more blacks attend, such
as those in the South and in "non
traditional pipelines" such as city
colleges, community colleges and
all-black areas.
But Fetter said the Admissions
Office faces a 13 percent budget
cut, which could lead to less travel
by the admissions staff, along
with a mayor reduction in the bro
chure "Stanford Today."
Archuleta also said one way the
Admissions Office could increase
black enrollment would be to "find
and admit black students who ac
cording to sheer numbers don't
look like they can make it here,
but are qualified in all other ways
to be here."
He cited "persistence" as the
single most important factor in

academic success and suggested
the University admit more black
students whose persistence could
outweigh deficiencies in their past
academic preparation.
"I don't think the Admissions
Office is willing to take the risks
that are necessary to bring in
greater numbers of black stu
dents," Archuleta said.
He also mentioned publicity
over the Western Culture debate
two years ago and last year's
Ujamaa incident — which in
volved the posting of a racially
offensive flier in the black theme
house — as deterrents to black
applicants. Admitted students, as
well as their parents, worry about
"the issue of safety and respect
for black students."
The Admissions staff is cur
rently on a two-and-a-half-day
retreat during which it will decide
next year's essay questions, as
well as other details of the admis
sions process.
After going to its wait list twice,
Stanford has finally reached its
target of 1,600 freshmen entrants
for next fall, according to Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter.
Due largely to a sharp increase
in the number of Asian-
Americans entrants, the class has
the largest percentage of minority
students in the history of Stan
ford. But many in the University
are concerned that the number of
blacks in the class has fallen sig
nificantly.
Fetter, who emphasized that all
her numbers are preliminary and
subject to change over the sum
mer, said that as of Monday the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions had confirmations from
1,607 graduating high school sen
iors, with almost 50 still not
reporting their decisions.
She said she was "very pleased"
the Admissions Office had
reached its target. Fetter and her

staff admitted
200 students
from the wait list
in two 100-
student "batches"
during a year in
which speculation
was widespread
that the earth
quake had hurt
the University's

efforts to admit a top-notch class.
Fetter said the preliminary
class is 54.2 percent white, 23.5
percent Asian-American, 11.3 per
cent Mexican-American fcnd other
Hispanic, 6.6 percent black, 3.1
percent foreign and 1.2 percent
Native American. In all, 42.6 per
cent of the class of 1994 is made
up of minority students, the lar
gest number ever.
Much of the increase in minor
ity admissions comes from Asian-
American students, who made up
18.1 percent of 1989's entering
class and 16 percent of 1988's en
tering class. The news of this in
