After going to its wait list twice,
Stanford has finally reached its
target of 1,600 freshmen entrants
for next fall, according to Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter.
Due largely to a sharp increase
in the number of Asian-
Americans entrants, the class has
the largest percentage of minority
students in the history of Stan
ford. But many in the University
are concerned that the number of
blacks in the class has fallen sig
nificantly.
Fetter, who emphasized that all
her numbers are preliminary and
subject to change over the sum
mer, said that as of Monday the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions had confirmations from
1,607 graduating high school sen
iors, with almost 50 still not
reporting their decisions.
She said she was "very pleased"
the Admissions Office had
reached its target. Fetter and her

staff admitted
200 students
from the wait list
in two 100-
student "batches"
during a year in
which speculation
was widespread
that the earth
quake had hurt
the University's

efforts to admit a top-notch class.
Fetter said the preliminary
class is 54.2 percent white, 23.5
percent Asian-American, 11.3 per
cent Mexican-American fcnd other
Hispanic, 6.6 percent black, 3.1
percent foreign and 1.2 percent
Native American. In all, 42.6 per
cent of the class of 1994 is made
up of minority students, the lar
gest number ever.
Much of the increase in minor
ity admissions comes from Asian-
American students, who made up
18.1 percent of 1989's entering
class and 16 percent of 1988's en
tering class. The news of this in
