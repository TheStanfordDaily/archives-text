A RIB-TICKLING SUGGESTION
FROM PARK.
Take out a box of ribs. And
not just any ribs. The best ribs
in the Bay Area, as voted by
San Francisco Focus maga
zine readers. The leanest,
juiciest baby back ribs
marinated for 24 hours, oak
wood smoked, and sizzled
over a hot mesquite fire. So
drop by or call ahead. We'll
even supply the extra nap
kins.
