Stanford Bachelors - Not
Your Typical Group of Guys
Who are we? Single entrepreneurs, professionals, engineers,
doctors, lawyers, graduate students. Men with some of the
highest student debts in the country, and one of the most active
groups of Stanford alumni in the Bay Area.
If you're going to be graduating this Spring and living in the
Bay Area, or are a single graduate student and wish to become
involved with activities outside of campus, we invite you to
consider applying to join the Stanford Bachelors.
We offer:
• An opportunity to keep in touch with Bay Area Stanford
graduates.
• An opportunity to meet and network with other single
professionals in the Bay Area.
• 2 to 3 events per month, including — dance parties with live
music and/or DJ's, theatre, symphony, ballet, tennis
tournaments, backpacking trips to Yosemite, and Stanford
football games.
• Smaller functions at country clubs, members' homes, and
art galleries.
• A reason to miss "Dallas" on Friday evenings.
Does any of this sound interesting? For more information, write
us at Stanford Bachelors, P.O. Box 2345, Stanford, CA 94309,
Attn.: DAL. Please provide a phone number where we can
reach you and photocopied proof of Stanford affiliation.
