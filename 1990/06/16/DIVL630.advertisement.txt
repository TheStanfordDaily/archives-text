Graduating
Students,
you've got one last decision to make-- which
Macintosh Computer to buy. Take advantage of
the lowest prices Apple has ever offered;
savings of up to 62% off suggested retail
prices. Make a sound investment in your future
by purchasing a new Macintosh at a price you
will never see again. Before you pack up for
good, leave Stanford on the right track. Pack a
Mac away with you - you
can't afford not to.
SE/30
Graduating students
have until June 25,
1990 to buy a
Macintosh at these
great prices.
