Brittle Breakthrough!
Haagen-Dazs announces the arrival
of the new Brittle Bar.
This extraordinary new ice cream bar begins with
rich, golden caramel swirled into the finest
vanilla ice cream in the world. Then it's dipped
in imported Belgian chocolate and
covered with nuggets of crunchy peanut brittle.
Its an outrageous combination of tastes
that promises to drive you nuts!
