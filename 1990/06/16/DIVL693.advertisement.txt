Hey Bryan (BVl),
Congratulations. You completed your dream of graduating from
Stanford. I'm very proud to have you as my brother. You've done
many great things and I know that there will be many more. Who
sounds like a big brother now? Thanks for all the late night
homework help and advice. I'm so excited about seeing you again.
It'll be lots of fun. I guess it's time for you to take off, you hoser.
Have fun and relax now!!
Love, Scott
