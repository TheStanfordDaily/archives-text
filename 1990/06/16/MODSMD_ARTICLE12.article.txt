# Conflict and change have led to common ground
## Transition to CIV took time, followed much discussion 
### Holly Hacker 
When we came to Stanford in 1986, "Conflict
and Change" was just a name for one of eight
Western Culture tracks fulfilling Area One.
As we leave Stanford in 1990, the words
"Conflict and Change" aptly describe the dy
namic processes at work in this diverse com
munity in transition.
The following articles discuss different ways
in which conflict has both divided and united
Stanford University over the past four years.
• Holly Hacker's article chronicles the "Wes
tern Culture/CIV debate," in which the West
ern Culture program itself became a center of
conflict and a casualty of change.
• Liz Lempert's piece provides a balanced
history of conflict-riddled relations between
the University and the Hoover Institution.
Also included in this retrospective analysis
are two personal columns written by gradu
ating seniors.
• Steve Phillips reflects upon the political
gains made over the past few years by Stan
ford's communities of color.
• Alicia Kent relates how her investigative
articles on rape at Stanford, printed in The
Daily earlier this year, have both increased
student awareness of "women's issues" and
empowered rape survivors.
Looking back, one sees how each of these
issues has been a testing ground for the Class
of '90. Looking forward, one hopes that we
will remember, years from now, now conflict
and change can lead us to common ground.

Imagine arriving at Stanford as
a freshman, only to find that one
of your required classes was about
to become the subject of more
than two years of heated discus
sion and debate on campus and
across the nation.
Such was the case for members
of the Class of 1990. They arrived
at Stanford just as the contro
versy surrounding the content of
the Area One distribution require
ment — more commonly known
as Western Culture — began. Now
they leave as the incoming Class
of 1994 calmly accepts the study
of "Cultures, Ideas and Values."
The move to add non-European
cultures and works by women and
minorities to the Area One re
quirement actually began when
the Class of '90 arrived. In Octo
ber 1986, several panelists at an
open forum in Memorial Audito
rium argued that the content of
Western Culture classes remained
"narrow and old-fashioned."
