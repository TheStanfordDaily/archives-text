# Conflict and change have led to common ground
## Transition to CIV took time, followed much discussion 
### Holly Hacker 
When we came to Stanford in 1986, "Conflict
and Change" was just a name for one of eight
Western Culture tracks fulfilling Area One.
As we leave Stanford in 1990, the words
"Conflict and Change" aptly describe the dy
namic processes at work in this diverse com
munity in transition.
The following articles discuss different ways
in which conflict has both divided and united
Stanford University over the past four years.
• Holly Hacker's article chronicles the "Wes
tern Culture/CIV debate," in which the West
ern Culture program itself became a center of
conflict and a casualty of change.
• Liz Lempert's piece provides a balanced
history of conflict-riddled relations between
the University and the Hoover Institution.
Also included in this retrospective analysis
are two personal columns written by gradu
ating seniors.
• Steve Phillips reflects upon the political
gains made over the past few years by Stan
ford's communities of color.
• Alicia Kent relates how her investigative
articles on rape at Stanford, printed in The
Daily earlier this year, have both increased
student awareness of "women's issues" and
empowered rape survivors.
Looking back, one sees how each of these
issues has been a testing ground for the Class
of '90. Looking forward, one hopes that we
will remember, years from now, now conflict
and change can lead us to common ground.

Imagine arriving at Stanford as
a freshman, only to find that one
of your required classes was about
to become the subject of more
than two years of heated discus
sion and debate on campus and
across the nation.
Such was the case for members
of the Class of 1990. They arrived
at Stanford just as the contro
versy surrounding the content of
the Area One distribution require
ment — more commonly known
as Western Culture — began. Now
they leave as the incoming Class
of 1994 calmly accepts the study
of "Cultures, Ideas and Values."
The move to add non-European
cultures and works by women and
minorities to the Area One re
quirement actually began when
the Class of '90 arrived. In Octo
ber 1986, several panelists at an
open forum in Memorial Audito
rium argued that the content of
Western Culture classes remained
"narrow and old-fashioned."

Many members of the Black Student Union were vocal advocates of changing Western Culture to a requirement which
Incorporated more works by women and people of color.
Values, Technology, Science and
Society track, asked people to con
sider if Western Culture "ig
nored) non-whites" or "the little
people who experience the hard
edge of history."
That night, Clay Carson, asso
ciate professor of history and
Afro-American studies, said the
establishment of a "World Cul
ture" track "is a goal toward
which we should move."
However, those in favor of ex
panding the horizons of Western
Culture were not without their
opponents. Philosophy Prof. John
Perry called the current program
"terrific," and said adding works
by women and minorities would
"cram too much into too little
time."
Later that month, Provost

James Rosse appointed a task
force to comprehensively review
the Western Culture program and
recommend specific reforms in re
sponse to increasing criticism that
the program did not address the
contributions and concerns of
women and minorities.
Yet some professors spoke
against the proposal to change the
curriculum. English Prof, and
Vice Provost William Chace
argued to preserve the Western
Culture requirement as it was. "If
it's not broke, don't fix it," Chace
said.
But in a January 1987 visit to
Stanford, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
urged the University to make the
suggested changes to Western
Culture. "No one can be truly ed
ucated in the world, limited to
one language and obsessed with
that language," he told a crowd
at Memorial Auditorium. "There's
more to culture than Western Cul
ture."

In April 1987, the University's
Western Culture Task Force re
leased a report calling for mqjor
reforms in the Western Culture
requirement and recommended
that its main purpose be a study
of diverse cultures.
The task force said the focus
of the new requirement should
encompass non-European cul
tures, women and minorities. In
addition, the task force recom
mended that the core reading list
be abolished and the course's
name be changed to Cultures,
Ideas and Values.
Several professors, however, as
sailed the report. Western Culture
Programming Committee Chair
Paul Robinson argued for the
group, saying, "We think the re
quirement ought to remain the
requirement in Western Culture."
The Western Culture issue did
not come up again until October
1987. The task force issued a
report calling for all Western Cul

ture tracks to study at least one
non-Western culture, abolish the
core reading list, and "increase
the representation of women and
minorities."
Some students urged that the
Western Culture changes be
firmly implemented. Amanda
Kemp, vice chair of the Black Stu
dent Union, said she feared the
report's weak wording would al
low some tracks to escape with
only "token changes."
In October 1987, the recom
mendations of the task force to
alter the Area One requirement
met with general approval among
members of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. The com
mittee had to approve the task
force's recommendations before
they could be considered by the
Faculty Senate for implementa
tion.
At an open forum in October,
the BSU, MEChA, and the Asian
American Student Association

supported the proposal but said
it required "more concrete foun
dation" and should advocate the
active recruitment of qualified mi
nority faculty to teach the pro
gram.
While Chace said that "very few
faculty members are for the new
legislation," Keith Archuleta, as
sistant director of Residential Ed
ucation, countered that Stanford
should "face the reality that the
U.S. is not a European nation and
that it is a great disservice to
education to ignore that fact."
In November 1987, more than
200 students supporting the pro
posed changes held a rally at
White Plaza. Said freshman Na
omi Martin, "We are here to send
a message .. . that racism in our
education will not be tolerated."
Later that day, 100 students
marched to Building 170, where
the committee was meeting to dis
cuss the Western Culture revi
sions. Members of several

student-of-color organizations
chanted, "Down with racism,
down with Western Culture, up
with diversity."
In December, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies unani
mously approved a slightly
modified version of the task force
proposal.
Yet the controversy was far
from over. In January 1988, the
Faculty Senate opened discussion
on the Western Culture issue.
Chace and 24 other faculty mem
bers attempted to block passage
of the plan and presented a
counter-proposal, which would
add works to the existing core list.
Also that month, students in
support of the current Western
Culture program lobbied the Fac
ulty Senate under the name of
"Save the Core." The group, led
by Lora Dawn Headrick, pre
sented the Faculty Senate with a
petition containing several hun
dred signatures in support of
maintaining the core list of works.
On March 31, 1988, 200 stu
dents supporting the proposed
changes chanted, "Vote now, we
want change" outside the Law
School before the day's Faculty
Senate meeting.
That day the Faculty Senate ap
proved an amended form of the
task force proposal 39-4 with five
abstentions. The Senate dropped
the core list, replacing it with a
more flexible system providing a
yearly core list.
The final bill said the aim of
the Area One requirement was
"to provide students with common
intellectual experience of broaden
ing their understanding of ideas
and values drawn from different
strands of our own culture."
Under the Carson-Chace
amendment, the program would
"give substantial attention to the
issues of race, gender and class
each academic quarter, with at
least one of these issues to be

addressed explicitly in at least one
reading each quarter."
However, in an April 1988 visit
to Stanford, former U.S. Secre
tary of Education William Ben
nett accused the University of
caving in to "pressure politics and
intimidation" of student cam
paigns.
"For a moment," Bennett said,
"a great university was brought
down by the very forces which
modern universities came into
being to oppose — ignorance, ir
rationality and intimidation."
On April 19, Bennett and Ken
nedy met head-to-head nation
wide for 15 minutes on
MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour on
PBS. While Bennett said Stanford
was "trashing Western Culture,"
Kennedy said "the study of West
ern Culture will be made more
valuable by the introduction" of
works from other cultures.
Yet even in the fall of 1988,
The Daily reported, "What re

mains is a transitional year for
the new Cultures, Ideas and
Values legislation, to be imple
mented in the fall of 1989." Fresh
men from the Class of '92 had
the choice of taking a class from
the traditional Western Culture
tracks or enrolling in the "ex
perimental" 48-person track,
"Europe and the Americas."
History Prof. Paul Seaver, head
of the VTSS track, said if the CIV
classes were fully developed, Stan
ford would have made "the first
successful attempt in the coun
try" of bringing a world perspec
tive to Western classes.
In November 1988, instructors
and students of the experimental
track said it was proving an ex
cellent model for the following
year's CIV tracks.
Works in the course included
those of Latin-American writers
Juan Rulfo and Sandra Cisneros
and African-American woman
writer Zora Neale Hurston. The

"canon" works included the
writings of St. Augustine, Karl
Marx and Sigmund Freud.
According to CIV instructors
Mary Pratt and Renato Rosaldo,
the only remaining hurdle before
implementing the new program
was to find qualified faculty to
teach the courses next year.
As Robinson told the Faculty
Senate in March 1989, "the mul
ticultural ideals of the new legis

lation will not be fully realized
until there is a larger pool of mi
nority faculty and faculty with ex
pertise outside of the European
field from which potential CIV
faculty can be drawn."
All in all, the change, once im
plemented, came smoothly for
freshmen in the course. As
freshman Brad Nieder said, "I
don't know if they taught [about
feminism and foreign cultures]

before, but if not, they should
have."
Even less than a year later,
many seem glad of the change.
With no additional mqjor changes
expected in CIV in the future,
Stanford can credit itself for up
dating a course once criticized for
requiring only readings by "dead,
white, European males" to a mul
ticultural perspective on what
living in America is all about.
