# A 						thawing between Hoover, Stanford?
## 
### Liz Lempert 
A bitter fight over a presiden
tial library, a thwarted skirmish
to bring the think tank under
faculty control, a forced change
in management — for the Hoo
ver Institution, the past four
years have brought tremendous
conflict and dramatic change.
University President Donald
Kennedy and other administra
tors have blamed the bad rela
tions between Stanford and its
think tank on the outspoken and
abrasive personality of W. Glenn
Campbell, Hoover's former di
rector.
Now Hoover is under different
leadership, and Kennedy has
thrown his support behind the
new director, John Raisian, a
cool-headed peacemaker who
shares little of his predecessor's
flamboyancy.
But while Kennedy sees a new
era of harmony between the
think tank and Stanford,
longtime Hoover critic, Political
Science Prof. John Manley, fears
that regardless of leadership,
Hoover's conservative ties dam
age the University's reputation.
The Campbell legacy
Described by enemies as a
"curmudgeon," by allies as a
"rude and not a terribly schol
arly intellectual," and by him
self as "cuddly," Campbell
directed the Hoover Institution
for nearly 30 years until he
stepped down in 1989 under
pressure from Kennedy and


Damlan MarhefVa — Daily
Stanford's Board of Trustees.
Despite bad relations with Stan
ford's administration and faculty,
Campbell made Hoover what it is
today — the nation's top conser
vative think tank.
During his tenure, Hoover's en
dowment grew from $2 million to
a current level of more than $120
million, a direct result of Camp
bell's ability as a fund-raiser.
This money funds the Institu
tion's collections — which have
grown from 600,000 volumes to
1.6 million under Campbell's
directorship — and its extensive
archives, which have quadrupled.
More controversial was Hoo
ver's emergence as the premiere
think tank of the Reagan admin
istration.
Campbell, a friend of former
President Reagan since his days
as California's governor, touts the
relationship. "It is not only Hoo
ver that can boast of a 'Reagan
connection,' but the entire Uni
versity," Campbell wrote in his
1986 annual report.
Hoover is home-base to several
of Reagan's former cabinet mem
bers and advisers, including
former Secretary of State George
-Shultz, economic advisers Martin
Anderson, John Dogan and
iThomas Gale Moore, and health
jadviser Rita Ricardo-Campbell.
• Former Attorney General Ed
iwin Meese also holds a position
lat Hoover as a Distinguished
jVisiting Fellow.
Reagan himself has been an
honorary fellow since 1975.
' At a 1988 White House recep

tion for Hoover's scholars and its
Board of Overseers, Reagan sin
gled out a Hoover public policy
guide titled "The United States
in the 1980s," produced under
Campbell's direction, as influenc
ing and even originating many of
the policies of his presidency.
"Not only did I and my admin
istration study it, but so did Gen
eral Secretary Gorbachev,"
Reagan said. He quoted the Soviet
leader as saying, "We have read
this book and have watched all of
its programs become adopted by
the Reagan administration."
Manley/Rebholz opposition
But while Campbell boasted of
Hoover's influence on the nation's
conservative political agenda,
Manley and English Prof. Ronald
Rebolz argued that the institu
tion's partisan bent harms Stan
ford's academic principles.
Since 1983, Manley and Rebholz
have been campaigning for Stan
ford to either sever Hoover's
"political arm" or to bring the
institution under normal aca
demic governance.
Hoover exists within the
framework of the University, but
unlike other policy centers and
academic departments, its ap
pointments do not need the ap
proval of the Faculty Senate.
"Hoover is a think tank with a
mission and a political bent, and
this is why its continued indepen
dence is so vital to the Institu
tion," Manley said. A think tank
with such ardently conservative
views and goals has no place on
a university campus, he said.
In a joint memo to the senate
in 1988, Manley and Rebolz
argued that as long as Hoover's

political arm operates from Stan
ford, the University "will continue
to allow its good name to foster
political causes and will continue
to become embroiled in damaging
political controversies."
The Reagan Library
The tensions between Hoover
and Stanford came to head in the
early '80s when Campbell pro
posed the Ronald Reagan Presi
dential Library and Public Affairs
Center in the rolling, undeveloped
Foothills.
The public affairs center, to be
administered by Hoover, was later
separated from the library and
museum proposal following the
University's insistence that a
campus-based policy center be
governed by Stanford, not Hoover.
In 1984 Reagan accepted the
offer.
A huge battle ensued . ..
From the beginning, the rela
tionship between Stanford and
the Reagan foundation was tense
and often hostile as the University
endeavored to limit the library to
a research center, while the foun
dation pushed for a memorial to
President Reagan.
In 1987, after protests were

mounted on both political and en
vironmental fronts, the library
proposal was withdrawn.
Many at Hoover still remain bit
ter, especially Campbell.
"Motivated by petty partisanship
and political intolerance," he said
in his last annual report as direc
tor, "the faculty critics spewed
venom hardly becoming to a great
academic institution."
Manley and Rebholz are two of
the most vocal advocates of a
Stanford-Hoover divorce. They
hope to see Hoover become a re
search facility with no political
mission.
But talk of divorce has not been
limited exclusively to critics of
Hoover. A committee formed to
evaluate the relationship between
Hoover and .Stanford, headed by
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dorn
busch, released a report in 1985
recommending against immediate
divorce. But if relations failed to
improve in the next several years,
the report said, "divorce should
be reconsidered."
Early in the summer of '88, one
of Hoover's most prominent re
search fellows, Milton Friedman,
also suggested splitting ties.
"I cannot believe that if the

Stanford faculty have been spend
ing two-thirds or three-quarters
of their time jousting with Hoo
ver, that this is a productive use
of their time."
But Kennedy has strongly
urged against such drastic action.
"I cannot envision a situation un
der which the Board of Trustees
should consider a divorce that
would spin those extraordinary
academic assets off of this Uni
versity," he said. "And I cannot
conceive of a set of circumstances
under which I would advocate it."
In the spring of 1988, nearly
20 professors, headed by Alexan
der George, signed a petition ur
ging the Faculty Senate to debate
the issue of bringing Hoover un
der normal academic governance.
When the topic came before the
senate in October 1988, after the
urgings of Kennedy, the senate
decided to postpone its discus
sions until after new director had
been selected.
A year later, when the issue
was resurrected, the senate shot
it down.
A New Era?
Last February, Raisian ad
dressed the Faculty Senate.

The event was significant be
cause it was the first time in his
tory the director of Hoover ever
came before the body of tradition
ally antagonistic faculty.
His address focused on the In
stitution's wealth of documents
and archival material, not on the
loss of the Reagan Library and
other past sore spots. His
demeanor was in striking contrast
to his predecessor's.
Manley, however, is uncon
vinced of a radical change at Hoo
ver. He fears that because Raisian
is less outspoken about his polit
ical beliefs than Campbell, out
siders might not notice Hoover's
true mission.
"A politically active think tank
and a non-partisan university
make a bad marriage," Manley
said.
Manley's proposal to reopen dis
cussion on the think tank's posi
tion within the framework of the
University, however, was glossed
over.
The senate greeted Raisian's ad
dress with claps and smiles.
Whether this is a dawning of a
new era remains to be seen, but
it seems the battles of the '80s
have subsided for the moment.

hope to see Hoover become a re
search facility with no political
mission.
But talk of divorce has not been
limited exclusively to critics of
Hoover. A committee formed to
evaluate the relationship between
Hoover and .Stanford, headed by
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dorn
busch, released a report in 1985
recommending against immediate
divorce. But if relations failed to
improve in the next several years,
the report said, "divorce should
be reconsidered."
Early in the summer of '88, one
of Hoover's most prominent re
search fellows, Milton Friedman,
also suggested splitting ties.
"I cannot believe that if the

Stanford faculty have been spend
ing two-thirds or three-quarters
of their time jousting with Hoo
ver, that this is a productive use
of their time."
But Kennedy has strongly
urged against such drastic action.
"I cannot envision a situation un
der which the Board of Trustees
should consider a divorce that
would spin those extraordinary
academic assets off of this Uni
versity," he said. "And I cannot
conceive of a set of circumstances
under which I would advocate it."
In the spring of 1988, nearly
20 professors, headed by Alexan
der George, signed a petition ur
ging the Faculty Senate to debate
the issue of bringing Hoover un
der normal academic governance.
When the topic came before the
senate in October 1988, after the
urgings of Kennedy, the senate
decided to postpone its discus
sions until after new director had
been selected.
A year later, when the issue
was resurrected, the senate shot
it down.
A New Era?
Last February, Raisian ad
dressed the Faculty Senate.

The event was significant be
cause it was the first time in his
tory the director of Hoover ever
came before the body of tradition
ally antagonistic faculty.
His address focused on the In
stitution's wealth of documents
and archival material, not on the
loss of the Reagan Library and
other past sore spots. His
demeanor was in striking contrast
to his predecessor's.
Manley, however, is uncon
vinced of a radical change at Hoo
ver. He fears that because Raisian
is less outspoken about his polit
ical beliefs than Campbell, out
siders might not notice Hoover's
true mission.
"A politically active think tank
and a non-partisan university
make a bad marriage," Manley
said.
Manley's proposal to reopen dis
cussion on the think tank's posi
tion within the framework of the
University, however, was glossed
over.
The senate greeted Raisian's ad
dress with claps and smiles.
Whether this is a dawning of a
new era remains to be seen, but
it seems the battles of the '80s
have subsided for the moment.
A bitter fight over a presiden
tial library, a thwarted skirmish
to bring the think tank under
faculty control, a forced change
in management — for the Hoo
ver Institution, the past four
years have brought tremendous
conflict and dramatic change.
University President Donald
Kennedy and other administra
tors have blamed the bad rela
tions between Stanford and its
think tank on the outspoken and
abrasive personality of W. Glenn
Campbell, Hoover's former di
rector.
Now Hoover is under different
leadership, and Kennedy has
thrown his support behind the
new director, John Raisian, a
cool-headed peacemaker who
shares little of his predecessor's
flamboyancy.
But while Kennedy sees a new
era of harmony between the
think tank and Stanford,
longtime Hoover critic, Political
Science Prof. John Manley, fears
that regardless of leadership,
Hoover's conservative ties dam
age the University's reputation.
The Campbell legacy
Described by enemies as a
"curmudgeon," by allies as a
"rude and not a terribly schol
arly intellectual," and by him
self as "cuddly," Campbell
directed the Hoover Institution
for nearly 30 years until he
stepped down in 1989 under
pressure from Kennedy and


Damlan MarhefVa — Daily
Stanford's Board of Trustees.
Despite bad relations with Stan
ford's administration and faculty,
Campbell made Hoover what it is
today — the nation's top conser
vative think tank.
During his tenure, Hoover's en
dowment grew from $2 million to
a current level of more than $120
million, a direct result of Camp
bell's ability as a fund-raiser.
This money funds the Institu
tion's collections — which have
grown from 600,000 volumes to
1.6 million under Campbell's
directorship — and its extensive
archives, which have quadrupled.
More controversial was Hoo
ver's emergence as the premiere
think tank of the Reagan admin
istration.
Campbell, a friend of former
President Reagan since his days
as California's governor, touts the
relationship. "It is not only Hoo
ver that can boast of a 'Reagan
connection,' but the entire Uni
versity," Campbell wrote in his
1986 annual report.
Hoover is home-base to several
of Reagan's former cabinet mem
bers and advisers, including
former Secretary of State George
-Shultz, economic advisers Martin
Anderson, John Dogan and
iThomas Gale Moore, and health
jadviser Rita Ricardo-Campbell.
• Former Attorney General Ed
iwin Meese also holds a position
lat Hoover as a Distinguished
jVisiting Fellow.
Reagan himself has been an
honorary fellow since 1975.
' At a 1988 White House recep

tion for Hoover's scholars and its
Board of Overseers, Reagan sin
gled out a Hoover public policy
guide titled "The United States
in the 1980s," produced under
Campbell's direction, as influenc
ing and even originating many of
the policies of his presidency.
"Not only did I and my admin
istration study it, but so did Gen
eral Secretary Gorbachev,"
Reagan said. He quoted the Soviet
leader as saying, "We have read
this book and have watched all of
its programs become adopted by
the Reagan administration."
Manley/Rebholz opposition
But while Campbell boasted of
Hoover's influence on the nation's
conservative political agenda,
Manley and English Prof. Ronald
Rebolz argued that the institu
tion's partisan bent harms Stan
ford's academic principles.
Since 1983, Manley and Rebholz
have been campaigning for Stan
ford to either sever Hoover's
"political arm" or to bring the
institution under normal aca
demic governance.
Hoover exists within the
framework of the University, but
unlike other policy centers and
academic departments, its ap
pointments do not need the ap
proval of the Faculty Senate.
"Hoover is a think tank with a
mission and a political bent, and
this is why its continued indepen
dence is so vital to the Institu
tion," Manley said. A think tank
with such ardently conservative
views and goals has no place on
a university campus, he said.
In a joint memo to the senate
in 1988, Manley and Rebolz
argued that as long as Hoover's

political arm operates from Stan
ford, the University "will continue
to allow its good name to foster
political causes and will continue
to become embroiled in damaging
political controversies."
The Reagan Library
The tensions between Hoover
and Stanford came to head in the
early '80s when Campbell pro
posed the Ronald Reagan Presi
dential Library and Public Affairs
Center in the rolling, undeveloped
Foothills.
The public affairs center, to be
administered by Hoover, was later
separated from the library and
museum proposal following the
University's insistence that a
campus-based policy center be
governed by Stanford, not Hoover.
In 1984 Reagan accepted the
offer.
A huge battle ensued . ..
From the beginning, the rela
tionship between Stanford and
the Reagan foundation was tense
and often hostile as the University
endeavored to limit the library to
a research center, while the foun
dation pushed for a memorial to
President Reagan.
In 1987, after protests were

mounted on both political and en
vironmental fronts, the library
proposal was withdrawn.
Many at Hoover still remain bit
ter, especially Campbell.
"Motivated by petty partisanship
and political intolerance," he said
in his last annual report as direc
tor, "the faculty critics spewed
venom hardly becoming to a great
academic institution."
Manley and Rebholz are two of
the most vocal advocates of a
Stanford-Hoover divorce. They
hope to see Hoover become a re
search facility with no political
mission.
