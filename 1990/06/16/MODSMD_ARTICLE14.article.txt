# College journalism can make a difference
## 
### 
DURING MY FOUR years
at Stanford, I have seen the
power that journalism can
have.
I heard people cheer as they
read about the Stanford women's
basketball team climb to the top
and take its first national cham
pionship.
I saw people look for The Daily
after a campus election to find
out the results.
I heard people laugh as they
read Andrew Berkowitz's weekly
humor columns.
I felt people's frustration when
there was a factual error or misin
terpretation in a story.
I watched people take stacks of
the special Gorbachev section to
keep as a memoir.
And as I look back, I realize

that a series of articles I wrote
had a profound impact on people
and this university.
After I finished my job as a
news editor of The Daily last year,
I decided that I had put in enough
hard work for this paper. The
Daily had given me a lot of expe
rience, and I had given The Daily
a lot of my time and sanity.
Then a woman approached me
with her story about a rape. We
sat down on the grass outside of
the Daily office one afternoon,
and she told me how six months
before she had woken up in a
man's bed with semen running
down her leg. And until now
everyone had ignored her story.
At first I could not stomach it.


Alicia Kent
Why was she telling me this?
What was I supposed to do? And
most of all, why couldn't she just
move on with her life?
Then this woman asked me if
I would print her story. I didn't
know what I could do, but I knew
I had to do something to help, so
I promised her that I would give
the story everything I had.
That was October of this year.
At the end of February, The Daily
ran my series about acquaintance
rape between Stanford students
and the failure of the University
judicial process to deal with these
cases.
Four long months of stress,
work, paranoia and lack of sleep:
When the series finally ran, I
realized that I had done the best

job I possibly could have.
What I hadn't realized was the
response I would get afterward.
At lunchtime on the day the
first story appeared, I walked in
on a heated debate about what
constitutes rape. People I never
imagined would be interested in
so-called "women's issues" were
suddenly quoting my articles and
arguing about these very issues.
When they saw me, they wanted
to know how to define rape. I was
attacked by questions: "If we're
both drunk and we have sex, is
that rape?"
"If she's not sure, what should
I do?"
"How do I know when to stop?"
"Do people ever say they've
been raped to get back at some
one?"
And most of all, people asked
me, "How do I know if I've been
a rapist?"

People in my dormitory wanted
to know what I was trying to
prove by writing the series. Was
I a radical feminist with a hidden
agenda? Did I have friends who
were raped? Had I been raped?
(If people want to know the an
swer to these questions, then I
would have to say no to all three.)
These questions troubled me,
but at the same time, I was en
couraged by the debate that was
going on. People were finally
talking about a crime that hap
pened around here but had been
ignored for so long.
I watched one woman in class
read the final story, skimming it
to find the graphic rape scenarios.
At least she's reading it, I thought
to myself. Now if anyone comes
to her with a similar experience
or if such an experience ever hap
pens to her, she will know to call
it rape.

AND THEN one day, a hor
rible and wonderful thing
happened. A woman ap
proached me and told me that
after reading one of the rape
scenarios, she realized that what
had happened to the woman in
my story had happened to her.
She had told one other person
about her experience, but she had
never called it rape.
Now, she was ready to accept
that she was a survivor of ac
quaintance rape.
We sat in my room and both
cried. It was horrible because she
now had to deal with the fact that
she was raped by someone she
knew. It was wonderful because
she was finally confronting what
had troubled her for so long.
Soon after, the ASSU asked me
to help draft a resolution recom
mending changes in the Univer
sity's judicial procedures. A
producer at XTV consulted me for

a show about acquaintance rape.
People demanded that Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
make a statement defining and
condemning rape. And during
Rape Awareness Week, he did.
I do not list all of these things
to pat myself on the back or to
justify why I wrote the articles.
After all, I didn't need a special
reason for wanting to write about
a woman who had been raped by
a medical student who is now on
his way to becoming a
gynecologist.
I didn't need a reason for wan
ting to include a situation where
it was not clear whether a rape
had occurred because the woman
had consented to sex after being
coerced.
I only needed to talk to these
students to understand how im
portant it was to educate others
about the reality of rape.
I only needed the first woman

to ask me not to be the hundredth
person to ignore her.
By writing my series, 1 had
given a voice to the silent sur
vivors. In my 21 years, 1 never
knew I had the power to change
things, but I realized I did and I
do now. People listened to what
I had to say and learned from the
stories I told.
And I'm telling this story now
to demonstrate the power of jour
nalism to change people and in
stitutions.
For that one person who
realizes that she or he has been
raped, for that one person who
realizes they have the right to say
no and for that one person who
respects that right, everything
was worth it.

I watched people take stacks of
the special Gorbachev section to
keep as a memoir.
And as I look back, I realize

that a series of articles I wrote
had a profound impact on people
and this university.
After I finished my job as a
news editor of The Daily last year,
I decided that I had put in enough
hard work for this paper. The
Daily had given me a lot of expe
rience, and I had given The Daily
a lot of my time and sanity.
Then a woman approached me
with her story about a rape. We
sat down on the grass outside of
the Daily office one afternoon,
and she told me how six months
before she had woken up in a
man's bed with semen running
down her leg. And until now
everyone had ignored her story.
At first I could not stomach it.

Why was she telling me this?
What was I supposed to do? And
most of all, why couldn't she just
move on with her life?
Then this woman asked me if
I would print her story. I didn't
know what I could do, but I knew
I had to do something to help, so
I promised her that I would give
the story everything I had.
That was October of this year.
At the end of February, The Daily
ran my series about acquaintance
rape between Stanford students
and the failure of the University
judicial process to deal with these
cases.
Four long months of stress,
work, paranoia and lack of sleep:
When the series finally ran, I
realized that I had done the best

job I possibly could have.
What I hadn't realized was the
response I would get afterward.
At lunchtime on the day the
first story appeared, I walked in
on a heated debate about what
constitutes rape. People I never
imagined would be interested in
so-called "women's issues" were
suddenly quoting my articles and
arguing about these very issues.
When they saw me, they wanted
to know how to define rape. I was
attacked by questions: "If we're
both drunk and we have sex, is
that rape?"
"If she's not sure, what should
I do?"
"How do I know when to stop?"
"Do people ever say they've
been raped to get back at some
one?"
And most of all, people asked
me, "How do I know if I've been
a rapist?"

People in my dormitory wanted
to know what I was trying to
prove by writing the series. Was
I a radical feminist with a hidden
agenda? Did I have friends who
were raped? Had I been raped?
(If people want to know the an
swer to these questions, then I
would have to say no to all three.)
These questions troubled me,
but at the same time, I was en
couraged by the debate that was
going on. People were finally
talking about a crime that hap
pened around here but had been
ignored for so long.
I watched one woman in class
read the final story, skimming it
to find the graphic rape scenarios.
At least she's reading it, I thought
to myself. Now if anyone comes
to her with a similar experience
or if such an experience ever hap
pens to her, she will know to call
it rape.

AND THEN one day, a hor
rible and wonderful thing
happened. A woman ap
proached me and told me that
after reading one of the rape
scenarios, she realized that what
had happened to the woman in
my story had happened to her.
She had told one other person
about her experience, but she had
never called it rape.
Now, she was ready to accept
that she was a survivor of ac
quaintance rape.
We sat in my room and both
cried. It was horrible because she
now had to deal with the fact that
she was raped by someone she
knew. It was wonderful because
she was finally confronting what
had troubled her for so long.
Soon after, the ASSU asked me
to help draft a resolution recom
mending changes in the Univer
sity's judicial procedures. A
producer at XTV consulted me for

a show about acquaintance rape.
People demanded that Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
make a statement defining and
condemning rape. And during
Rape Awareness Week, he did.
I do not list all of these things
to pat myself on the back or to
justify why I wrote the articles.
After all, I didn't need a special
reason for wanting to write about
a woman who had been raped by
a medical student who is now on
his way to becoming a
gynecologist.
I didn't need a reason for wan
ting to include a situation where
it was not clear whether a rape
had occurred because the woman
had consented to sex after being
coerced.
I only needed to talk to these
students to understand how im
portant it was to educate others
about the reality of rape.
I only needed the first woman

to ask me not to be the hundredth
person to ignore her.
By writing my series, 1 had
given a voice to the silent sur
vivors. In my 21 years, 1 never
knew I had the power to change
things, but I realized I did and I
do now. People listened to what
I had to say and learned from the
stories I told.
And I'm telling this story now
to demonstrate the power of jour
nalism to change people and in
stitutions.
For that one person who
realizes that she or he has been
raped, for that one person who
realizes they have the right to say
no and for that one person who
respects that right, everything
was worth it.

DURING MY FOUR years
at Stanford, I have seen the
power that journalism can
have.
I heard people cheer as they
read about the Stanford women's
basketball team climb to the top
and take its first national cham
pionship.
I saw people look for The Daily
after a campus election to find
out the results.
I heard people laugh as they
read Andrew Berkowitz's weekly
humor columns.
I felt people's frustration when
there was a factual error or misin
terpretation in a story.
I watched people take stacks of
the special Gorbachev section to
keep as a memoir.
And as I look back, I realize

that a series of articles I wrote
