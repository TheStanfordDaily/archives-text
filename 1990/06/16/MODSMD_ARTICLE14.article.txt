# College journalism can make a difference
## 
### 
DURING MY FOUR years
at Stanford, I have seen the
power that journalism can
have.
I heard people cheer as they
read about the Stanford women's
basketball team climb to the top
and take its first national cham
pionship.
I saw people look for The Daily
after a campus election to find
out the results.
I heard people laugh as they
read Andrew Berkowitz's weekly
humor columns.
I felt people's frustration when
there was a factual error or misin
terpretation in a story.
I watched people take stacks of
the special Gorbachev section to
keep as a memoir.
And as I look back, I realize

that a series of articles I wrote
had a profound impact on people
and this university.
After I finished my job as a
news editor of The Daily last year,
I decided that I had put in enough
hard work for this paper. The
Daily had given me a lot of expe
rience, and I had given The Daily
a lot of my time and sanity.
Then a woman approached me
with her story about a rape. We
sat down on the grass outside of
the Daily office one afternoon,
and she told me how six months
before she had woken up in a
man's bed with semen running
down her leg. And until now
everyone had ignored her story.
At first I could not stomach it.
