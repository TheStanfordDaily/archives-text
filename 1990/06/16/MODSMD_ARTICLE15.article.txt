# Progressive struggle has sparked change

### 
IN 1986, I faced a dilemma. It
was my senior year at Stan
ford, and I was wrestling with
how best to bring about progres
sive change in this country. At
that time, I wrote the following
words:
"Have my four years at Stan
ford come to this â€” offering
myself to the highest bidder so
that I can go out and grease the
wheels of America's economic ma
chine? The same economy that
cannot provide employment for 10
million people and allows 34 mil
lion people to live in poverty?
What road will I take? Is there
any alternative to committing my
very being and essence to the crea
tion of a more just social order?"
Given the national prominence
and prestige of this institution, I

concluded that my efforts would
have the greatest proportional im
pact if I stayed here and worked
to improve Stanford. In that '86
column, I explained that "I cannot
ignore the pain of the people. I
must act. The job is secondary,
the struggle is primary."
After eight total years here as
a registered student, stopped-out
student, and staff member, I am
happy to report that Stanford is
a very different place today than
it was in 1982.
What has changed? Well, to give
you a little perspective, when I
first arrived here the Macintosh
hadn't been invented yet, and we
did all of our papers on
typewriters. While I didn't have
