# Progressive struggle has sparked change
## 
### 
IN 1986, I faced a dilemma. It
was my senior year at Stan
ford, and I was wrestling with
how best to bring about progres
sive change in this country. At
that time, I wrote the following
words:
"Have my four years at Stan
ford come to this — offering
myself to the highest bidder so
that I can go out and grease the
wheels of America's economic ma
chine? The same economy that
cannot provide employment for 10
million people and allows 34 mil
lion people to live in poverty?
What road will I take? Is there
any alternative to committing my
very being and essence to the crea
tion of a more just social order?"
Given the national prominence
and prestige of this institution, I

concluded that my efforts would
have the greatest proportional im
pact if I stayed here and worked
to improve Stanford. In that '86
column, I explained that "I cannot
ignore the pain of the people. I
must act. The job is secondary,
the struggle is primary."
After eight total years here as
a registered student, stopped-out
student, and staff member, I am
happy to report that Stanford is
a very different place today than
it was in 1982.
What has changed? Well, to give
you a little perspective, when I
first arrived here the Macintosh
hadn't been invented yet, and we
did all of our papers on
typewriters. While I didn't have


Steve Phillies
anything to do with bringing the
Mac to campus, I was privileged
to participate with hundreds of
other students in key struggles
that changed the campus culture.
Through years of mass organ
izing, we helped to produce the
following reforms:
• Convincing the Board of Trus
tees for the first time in history
to divest stock from companies
with operations in South Africa;
• Challenging the eth
nocentricity of the Western Cul
ture program and helping to
create and win successful passage
of Cultures, Ideas, and Values;
• Hiring faculty of color and in
creasing University support for
academic programs focusing on
people of color;
• Instituting a dialogue about
University policies protecting stu
dents of color from racial harass
ment and intimidation; and
• Beginning the University
Committee on Minority Issues.
Clearly, Stanford has not been
alone in undergoing changes in

the 1980s. Our efforts here were
part of the worldwide revolution
for democracy, justice, and
equality. We drew inspiration
from the courageous youth of
South Africa, Jesse Jackson's bold
and historic forays into the pres
idential arena, the example of stu
dents of color across the country
sitting in for multicultural
changes. Observation of and par
ticipation in those events
produced a new generation of stu
dents committed to working for
change.
Because the students and
leaders of this institution were
able to glimpse a bit of the future
and recognize the developing so
cial trends, Stanford has the
honor of being internationally
recognized as a leader in the
movement to prepare for the
multicultural future. In Time
magazine's cover story on
"America's Changing Colors,"
Stanford was the one university
they used as an example of how
higher education is evolving.
While we have tried to bring a
fitting conclusion to Stanford's
first century, there is an impor
tant lesson for those who will
carry on after us. It is the lesson

of hope and fear.
Political struggle is the ultimate
expression of humanity's hope.
There is an inherent conviction
that the mtyority of people do care
and will support changing the
status quo once they understand
the severity of the problem and
see an opportunity to make
amends.
Our desire for a socially respon
sible campus that embraced and
celebrated the cultures of all stu
dents motivated us to challenge
the status quo and petition for
change. Our hope that people
would support our cause sus
tained us through days of diffi
culty.
If hope has been the driving
force of change, fear has been the
principal obstacle. Those people
who hold power or benefit from
the current status quo occasion
ally lashed out through hostile
words and actions at those of us
trying to make change. I am con
vinced that that behavior sprang
from fear and insecurity about
what would happen if power were
shared or changed hands.
I am reminded of a little white
boy in lowa who said that his
mother told him if Jesse Jackson

became president, then all whites
would be made slaves. While
somewhat amusing and distant
from our own lives, I suspect that
some of that sentiment affects
more people than are willing to
admit it.
Since change is only just begin
ning to occur in this country and
many people graduating this
weekend will go on to hold posi
tions of influence, let me say for
the record that you have nothing
to fear from the empowerment of
people of color. This movement is
not about vengeance but justice
and equality, and the new society
will be better for everybody.
History has shown that stu
dents and people of color are two
of the most dynamic engines of
social progress in this country.
From the civil rights movement
to the Vietnam War to the Free
South Africa movement to the
multicultural movement in higher
education, people of color and
young people of all ages have chal
lenged the status quo and worked
on the frontlines of struggle to
improve our country.
As the world enters a new era,
and we go forth from this Uni
versity, we have both a tremen

dous opportunity and a serious
responsibility. As President Gor
bachev said in his visit here, we
have the opportunity to create a
new world order. Such a historic
opportunity carries with it a
heavy burden of responsibility as
well — the responsibility to act
with the maturity and care ap
propriate to the enormity of the
task before us.
I have been carefully watching
the example of such world leaders
as Gorbachev, Nelson Mandels,
and Jesse Jackson, and they are
all expressing a similar message.
They are challenging advocates of
change to use all of their talents,
energies and skills to construct a
new world order.
And they are stressing the need
to be disciplined and well
educated as we build for the fu
ture.
Given the enormity of the chal
lenge and the sophistication and
recalcitrance of the status quo,
we need all of the friends we can
get. Rigid and ideological defini
tions of friends and enemies are
no longer appropriate in this new
age. Allies can have different back
grounds, cultures and relation
ships to the means of production.

What counts is a commitment to
working for change that benefits
the broad majority of people. We
must move from class struggle to
common ground and then on to
the promised land.
Eight years is a long time in
the life of a University. My
freshman-year friends are gradu
ating from law school and medical
school and making $70,000 a year.
Was my sacrifice and effort worth
it? Without a doubt. We made his
tory and were swept along in one
of the most revolutionary periods
in this century. We touched many
lives and inspired many people. I
am grateful to all those who lent
assistance along the way.
As I search for words to con
clude this column and this chapter
of my life, I keep coming back to
one of my favorite phrases. It can
serve as a charge to those of us
leaving and a challenge to those
who remain. The world awaits our
work. In the darkest hours and
most difficult days, let's remem
ber one simple phrase: KEEP
HOPE ALIVE!

happy to report that Stanford is
a very different place today than
it was in 1982.
What has changed? Well, to give
you a little perspective, when I
first arrived here the Macintosh
hadn't been invented yet, and we
did all of our papers on
typewriters. While I didn't have


Steve Phillies
anything to do with bringing the
Mac to campus, I was privileged
to participate with hundreds of
other students in key struggles
that changed the campus culture.
Through years of mass organ
izing, we helped to produce the
following reforms:
• Convincing the Board of Trus
tees for the first time in history
to divest stock from companies
with operations in South Africa;
• Challenging the eth
nocentricity of the Western Cul
ture program and helping to
create and win successful passage
of Cultures, Ideas, and Values;
• Hiring faculty of color and in
creasing University support for
academic programs focusing on
people of color;
• Instituting a dialogue about
University policies protecting stu
dents of color from racial harass
ment and intimidation; and
• Beginning the University
Committee on Minority Issues.
Clearly, Stanford has not been
alone in undergoing changes in

the 1980s. Our efforts here were
part of the worldwide revolution
for democracy, justice, and
equality. We drew inspiration
from the courageous youth of
South Africa, Jesse Jackson's bold
and historic forays into the pres
idential arena, the example of stu
dents of color across the country
sitting in for multicultural
changes. Observation of and par
ticipation in those events
produced a new generation of stu
dents committed to working for
change.
Because the students and
leaders of this institution were
able to glimpse a bit of the future
and recognize the developing so
cial trends, Stanford has the
honor of being internationally
recognized as a leader in the
movement to prepare for the
multicultural future. In Time
magazine's cover story on
"America's Changing Colors,"
Stanford was the one university
they used as an example of how
higher education is evolving.
While we have tried to bring a
fitting conclusion to Stanford's
first century, there is an impor
tant lesson for those who will
carry on after us. It is the lesson

of hope and fear.
Political struggle is the ultimate
expression of humanity's hope.
There is an inherent conviction
that the mtyority of people do care
and will support changing the
status quo once they understand
the severity of the problem and
see an opportunity to make
amends.
Our desire for a socially respon
sible campus that embraced and
celebrated the cultures of all stu
dents motivated us to challenge
the status quo and petition for
change. Our hope that people
would support our cause sus
tained us through days of diffi
culty.
If hope has been the driving
force of change, fear has been the
principal obstacle. Those people
who hold power or benefit from
the current status quo occasion
ally lashed out through hostile
words and actions at those of us
trying to make change. I am con
vinced that that behavior sprang
from fear and insecurity about
what would happen if power were
shared or changed hands.
I am reminded of a little white
boy in lowa who said that his
mother told him if Jesse Jackson

became president, then all whites
would be made slaves. While
somewhat amusing and distant
from our own lives, I suspect that
some of that sentiment affects
more people than are willing to
admit it.
Since change is only just begin
ning to occur in this country and
many people graduating this
weekend will go on to hold posi
tions of influence, let me say for
the record that you have nothing
to fear from the empowerment of
people of color. This movement is
not about vengeance but justice
and equality, and the new society
will be better for everybody.
History has shown that stu
dents and people of color are two
of the most dynamic engines of
social progress in this country.
From the civil rights movement
to the Vietnam War to the Free
South Africa movement to the
multicultural movement in higher
education, people of color and
young people of all ages have chal
lenged the status quo and worked
on the frontlines of struggle to
improve our country.
As the world enters a new era,
and we go forth from this Uni
versity, we have both a tremen

dous opportunity and a serious
responsibility. As President Gor
bachev said in his visit here, we
have the opportunity to create a
new world order. Such a historic
opportunity carries with it a
heavy burden of responsibility as
well — the responsibility to act
with the maturity and care ap
propriate to the enormity of the
task before us.
I have been carefully watching
the example of such world leaders
as Gorbachev, Nelson Mandels,
and Jesse Jackson, and they are
all expressing a similar message.
They are challenging advocates of
change to use all of their talents,
energies and skills to construct a
new world order.
And they are stressing the need
to be disciplined and well
educated as we build for the fu
ture.
Given the enormity of the chal
lenge and the sophistication and
recalcitrance of the status quo,
we need all of the friends we can
get. Rigid and ideological defini
tions of friends and enemies are
no longer appropriate in this new
age. Allies can have different back
grounds, cultures and relation
ships to the means of production.

What counts is a commitment to
working for change that benefits
the broad majority of people. We
must move from class struggle to
common ground and then on to
the promised land.
Eight years is a long time in
the life of a University. My
freshman-year friends are gradu
ating from law school and medical
school and making $70,000 a year.
Was my sacrifice and effort worth
it? Without a doubt. We made his
tory and were swept along in one
of the most revolutionary periods
in this century. We touched many
lives and inspired many people. I
am grateful to all those who lent
assistance along the way.
As I search for words to con
clude this column and this chapter
of my life, I keep coming back to
one of my favorite phrases. It can
serve as a charge to those of us
leaving and a challenge to those
who remain. The world awaits our
work. In the darkest hours and
most difficult days, let's remem
ber one simple phrase: KEEP
HOPE ALIVE!

Steve Phillips is graduating with
a bachelor's degree in African and
Afro-American Studies.
IN 1986, I faced a dilemma. It
was my senior year at Stan
ford, and I was wrestling with
how best to bring about progres
sive change in this country. At
that time, I wrote the following
words:
"Have my four years at Stan
ford come to this — offering
myself to the highest bidder so
that I can go out and grease the
wheels of America's economic ma
chine? The same economy that
cannot provide employment for 10
million people and allows 34 mil
lion people to live in poverty?
What road will I take? Is there
any alternative to committing my
very being and essence to the crea
tion of a more just social order?"
Given the national prominence
and prestige of this institution, I

concluded that my efforts would
have the greatest proportional im
pact if I stayed here and worked
to improve Stanford. In that '86
column, I explained that "I cannot
ignore the pain of the people. I
must act. The job is secondary,
the struggle is primary."
After eight total years here as
a registered student, stopped-out
student, and staff member, I am
happy to report that Stanford is

it was in 1982.
