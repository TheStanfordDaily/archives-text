Advice for graduating seniors
from Prof. Ron Rebholz
Anti-advice for graduating sen
iors from Prof. Rob Polhemus
In so far as you can, do work
that you love even if it means
earning less money.
Generally, you're paid well for
the jobs that are most fun to do;
that's why it's hard to get those
jobs.
Continue to learn, because
learning is the work and joy of a
lifetime.
Try to remember what you knew
before you started learning in the
public schools.
Love and accept yourselves as
you are, which is the meaning of
humility.
To accept yourself as you are is
to give up.
Love means seeking the well
being of others as well as your
selves. Love those with whom you
are intimate and those who have

hurt you and will continue to hurt
you because of your race, class,
gender or sexual orientation.
It's tough to do. You can try.
Be good citizens in every kind
of community in which you live:
the place you work, the town or
city you live in or near, the state,
the nation and the world.
People who think of themselves
as citizens often end up guil
lotined.
Reflect on the relationship be
tween community and capitalism.
There is no community for more
than a few weeks where people
are poor.
Be activists on behalf of political
and social causes.
Be advocates for kindness. Point
out as sinners all who are unkind
for any reason.
Do not be disillusioned with
government. It can be a powerful
instrument for creating a more
just society.

Government is like your parents
and the people you know: in debt,
forgetful and highly neurotic.
Do not respect figures of au
thority unless they have earned
your respect.
Truckle. That's the way to get
ahead. No amount of flattery
seems implausible to anyone above
you.
You are not gods, but neither
are they.
No, but Robin Kennedy i» a
goddess. So's Michelle Pfeiffer.
Never underestimate the value
of play, which is action that has
no end but itself. Play.
Yes, but do not play alone. Also,
remember people hate anyone who
seems to be having very much fun.

Ron Rebholz, Professor of Eng
lish, is a Giants fan who believes
Shakespeare was a socialist.
Rob Polhemus, also Professor
of English, is an A's fan who
doesn't believe anything.
