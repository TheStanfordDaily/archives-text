# 'We two must soon be twain,' say several Stanford twins
## 
### E.E. Waff 
Several things I have seen Stan
ford seniors doing in the past
three months:
• Looking pale;
• Displaying theses of absurd
heft and dropping them, like
stones, on desks of reckoning in
various departments;
• Strategically manipulating
the margins and fonts of their
resumes, for a few final laser
printed editions.
I've seen them detailing which
portions of the globe they will live
in or travel through in the next
few months, or years, while they
are 'young' (i.e, unabashedly in
solvent). I've seen them rendering
themselves therapeutically insen
sate.
And I've seen them rehearsing
— with varying degrees of con
viction — the way in which they
will say, to themselves and to
others, that certain relationships
will change or be put on hold or
even terminate along with their
registration.
Finals week in June contains a
statistically significant proportion
of uncomfortable senior-year
realizations. "It's time we sepa
rate," Mark Mastalir says, and he
says it twice in the course of a
10-minute conversation.
His voice is measured and con
fident, as when he says that he
is graduating on time, that he

may apply to law school in a year,
that he would like to live some
where other than California,
where he has grown up. "We're
going our separate ways," he em
phasizes.
Mark is not discussing a rela
tionship which scrutiny has
revealed to be drawing its
strength from convenience —
though proximity has indeed been
a real factor. He is talking about
his twin brother, Eric, from whom
he has never been apart for longer
than two weeks.
There are at least five sets of
twins in the graduating class. All
of those interviewed, however,
were amused to be considered in
this way. They smile as if one had
just reminded them of a nickname
they were given in junior high,
an anachronism from childhood.
At home, Janice Keen observes,
she and her identical sister, Joyce,
answered to "Twin."
Mark Mastalir, who is on the
University cross country team
with his brother Eric, says that
the two of them were always con
sidered as a single phenomenon;
as a "publicity angle" it was a
convenient way in which to
describe them.
In college, however, these
brothers and sisters have taken
routes which may run parallel,
but which are decidedly indepen
dent. Lisa and Corey Okada, prod
uct design and design majors,

respectively, see each other fre
quently, but they have not lived
together until this quarter.
Each of the women has a niche
in which the other is not an in
tegral part. Corey remarks that
it is "nice not to be considered
part of a set here." Corey said
she felt tension with her sister
during their first year in college,
but the tension has been resolved.
The two women have managed
to maintain a closeness that in
cludes a necessary distance. One
friend of Corey's was shocked, re
cently, to see her with her sister,
exclaiming tactfully: "Oh my God,
there's two of you!"
Christie Gregorak, describing
her relationship with her sister,
Joani, observes: "We live our sep
arate lives here, definitely." She
believes that she is "fundamen
tally the same" as Joani, in that
the two have similar traits, but
that these traits have been
"expressed differently."
But independence is not a newly
acquired trait for any of the twins.
Each of the twins I spoke with
chose to come to Stanford inde
pendently of his or her sibling.
"We never really did make deci
sions in tandem," Joyce Keen
states.
Eric and Mark Mastalir were
each considering different Ivy
League schools, but decided on
Stanford. "It just happened to
work out that way," as Mark puts

it.
The coincidence has been a
happy one; each person I spoke
with admitted to being very glad
to have gone through college with
his or her sibling. Most agree that
the element of competition has
helped them to improve them
selves and each other — in ath
letic achievement for the Mastalir
twins, inartistic development for
the Okadas.
At a rally last year, Joyce and
Janice Keen, vocal and visible pro
life activists, demonstrated that
the family that is arrested to
gether, stays together. They
pursue their interests and support
their convictions in each other's
company: "We never, never com
pete," Janice asserts.
Christie Gregorak says that she
is "supportively competitive" with
her sister. Joani agrees that this
element in their relationship is
"incredibly positive."
Mark Mastalir explains that the
challenge of living with a person
who is always capable of matching
one's level of talent and intensity
has helped the performance of
both in running: "It brings out
the best in each one of us."
When asked if being continually
mistaken for one's sibling causes
tension in their relationship, most
bore the look, again, of slight
amusement. In each case, it

Joyce and Janice Keen are one of at least five pairs of twins
graduating in the Class of 1990. The Keen sisters are thinking in
terms of days left together, and making their own plans for after
graduation independently.
