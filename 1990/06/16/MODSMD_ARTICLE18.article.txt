# 'We two must soon be twain,' say several Stanford twins
## 
### E.E. Waff 
Several things I have seen Stan
ford seniors doing in the past
three months:
• Looking pale;
• Displaying theses of absurd
heft and dropping them, like
stones, on desks of reckoning in
various departments;
• Strategically manipulating
the margins and fonts of their
resumes, for a few final laser
printed editions.
I've seen them detailing which
portions of the globe they will live
in or travel through in the next
few months, or years, while they
are 'young' (i.e, unabashedly in
solvent). I've seen them rendering
themselves therapeutically insen
sate.
And I've seen them rehearsing
— with varying degrees of con
viction — the way in which they
will say, to themselves and to
others, that certain relationships
will change or be put on hold or
even terminate along with their
registration.
Finals week in June contains a
statistically significant proportion
of uncomfortable senior-year
realizations. "It's time we sepa
rate," Mark Mastalir says, and he
says it twice in the course of a
10-minute conversation.
His voice is measured and con
fident, as when he says that he
is graduating on time, that he

may apply to law school in a year,
that he would like to live some
where other than California,
where he has grown up. "We're
going our separate ways," he em
phasizes.
Mark is not discussing a rela
tionship which scrutiny has
revealed to be drawing its
strength from convenience —
though proximity has indeed been
a real factor. He is talking about
his twin brother, Eric, from whom
he has never been apart for longer
than two weeks.
There are at least five sets of
twins in the graduating class. All
of those interviewed, however,
were amused to be considered in
this way. They smile as if one had
just reminded them of a nickname
they were given in junior high,
an anachronism from childhood.
At home, Janice Keen observes,
she and her identical sister, Joyce,
answered to "Twin."
Mark Mastalir, who is on the
University cross country team
with his brother Eric, says that
the two of them were always con
sidered as a single phenomenon;
as a "publicity angle" it was a
convenient way in which to
describe them.
In college, however, these
brothers and sisters have taken
routes which may run parallel,
but which are decidedly indepen
dent. Lisa and Corey Okada, prod
uct design and design majors,

respectively, see each other fre
quently, but they have not lived
together until this quarter.
Each of the women has a niche
in which the other is not an in
tegral part. Corey remarks that
it is "nice not to be considered
part of a set here." Corey said
she felt tension with her sister
during their first year in college,
but the tension has been resolved.
The two women have managed
to maintain a closeness that in
cludes a necessary distance. One
friend of Corey's was shocked, re
cently, to see her with her sister,
exclaiming tactfully: "Oh my God,
there's two of you!"
Christie Gregorak, describing
her relationship with her sister,
Joani, observes: "We live our sep
arate lives here, definitely." She
believes that she is "fundamen
tally the same" as Joani, in that
the two have similar traits, but
that these traits have been
"expressed differently."
But independence is not a newly
acquired trait for any of the twins.
Each of the twins I spoke with
chose to come to Stanford inde
pendently of his or her sibling.
"We never really did make deci
sions in tandem," Joyce Keen
states.
Eric and Mark Mastalir were
each considering different Ivy
League schools, but decided on
Stanford. "It just happened to
work out that way," as Mark puts

it.
The coincidence has been a
happy one; each person I spoke
with admitted to being very glad
to have gone through college with
his or her sibling. Most agree that
the element of competition has
helped them to improve them
selves and each other — in ath
letic achievement for the Mastalir
twins, inartistic development for
the Okadas.
At a rally last year, Joyce and
Janice Keen, vocal and visible pro
life activists, demonstrated that
the family that is arrested to
gether, stays together. They
pursue their interests and support
their convictions in each other's
company: "We never, never com
pete," Janice asserts.
Christie Gregorak says that she
is "supportively competitive" with
her sister. Joani agrees that this
element in their relationship is
"incredibly positive."
Mark Mastalir explains that the
challenge of living with a person
who is always capable of matching
one's level of talent and intensity
has helped the performance of
both in running: "It brings out
the best in each one of us."
When asked if being continually
mistaken for one's sibling causes
tension in their relationship, most
bore the look, again, of slight
amusement. In each case, it

seems, similarity breeds content:
No one is troubled by the issue.
Most will answer to acquain
tances and even friends when
called by their twin's name, with
out bothering to correct the caller.
This is in order, Corey Okada ex
plains, to avoid the extended
round of apologies offered by the
person who has confused her with
her sister.
Some twins enjoy the element
of ambiguity, and even invisibility,
which such situations afford
them. Janice and Joyce Keen ad
mit to "switching off" a good deal;
they even grant each other favors
by assuming an unpleasant re
sponsibility or task given to the
one but not the other.
Joyce admits that even with
close friends who occasionally con
fuse her with her sister at first
glance, she will "play Janice," al
though, she says, "they can easily
tell the difference I think they
know the difference."
Regardless of others' confusion,
Janice asserts, being a twin has
not created any difficulties in
terms of her sense of self. Occa
sionally she is asked whether
being a twin has caused a sort of
identity crisis, but she usually
shrugs off the question.
The impression that emerges in
discussion with each twin inter
viewed is one of an extremely sup
portive and helpful relationship

which is strong enough to remain
so in changing circumstance. All
are excited about branching out |
on their own and pleased to know
they have their sibling's support.
Christie is not the only one to
note that she gets along better
with her twin when they don't
live together, and she believes her
relationship with Joani will
change for the better when they
leave Stanford and go their sep
arate ways: "We will develop more
as individuals when we're not in
the same physical place."
Most admit to feeling "strange"
about taking leave of their twins.
The longest any of those inter
viewed had been separated was
nine months. "Our phone bills will
be pretty big," Joani says.
Nonetheless, Joyce Keen ex
presses a decision common to all
of them: "We don't plan to make
a concerted effort to stay to
gether."
Joyce Keen emphasizes that her
sister and she are slowly adapting
to a new way of living. "We're
weaning each other for it," Janice
explains. "It's about time that we
split." The two are thinking in
terms of days left together, and
making their own plans for after
graduation independently.
"She will always be my best
friend," Joani says of her sister
with assurance. In these uncan
nily aimless days fraught with
strange tension, as we wait to don
our caps and tassels, this sort of
intimacy — which requires no
sudden re-evaluation — is surely
something to envy.
