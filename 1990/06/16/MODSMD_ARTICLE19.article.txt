# Senior writes essays in many media — and with junked cars

### Martha Brockenbrough 
Not every abandoned *64 Dodge Rambler
gets a second lease on life. Even fewer are
reborn as works of art.
Yet, to David Menninger, a senior moor
ing in photography and design, projects
such as this creative resurrection seem to
come naturally.
When he was assigned to create a
photographic essay about a social condition
this spring for a design synthesis class,
Menninger went straight to the junkyard.
He bought the Dodge for about $130 and
had it towed to Manzanita Park, where he
lives.
He took out the front seats and spray
painted all the windows black — except
♦,he windshield, which he shrouded in a
white sheet. He completed his project by
hooking up two video monitors under the

dashboard, as well as a pair of speakers.
Sitting outside the car in one of the front
seats he had removed, Menninger con
trolled the three elements of his essay —
music, video and slides — for the pas
sengers of his sensory odyssey.
What the students in his class experi
enced, three at a time, is a reflection of
Dave's unique style. First, he piped Bul
garian choir music through the speakers.
"You could hear that there were words,"
Menninger said, "but you couldn't under
stand them."
The videotapes of junkyards full of cars
in "an awful state of disrepair" began next,
Menninger continued. He carried the
images one step further by projecting slides
of advertisements for new cars through the
white-sheeted windshield. After the slides
ended, Menninger turned off the video
cameras and then the music, reversing the

way the piece began.
Other students and the course professor,
Matt Kahn, were astounded. "It was a
most complex undertaking that came off
without a hitch," Kahn said. "The project
is not awe-inspiring in its nature," he con
tinued, "but it deals with the prosaic in
very insightful ways."
Breathing new life into the everyday
seems to be Menninger's primary strength.
But, characteristically, he understates this
talent, saying only, "I'm into the idea of
pattern and repetition."
One reason Menninger may look for
something new in the midst of pattern and
repetition is his family background. His
parents both graduated from Stanford in
1953. Menninger followed their pattern,
along with three of his five siblings.
Yet, as the only art msyor in a family
that includes multiple physicians and a

doctoral candidate, David struggled with
his own identity. He admits he felt "pres
sure to find somehow, somewhere that I
might fit in."
This has not made his experience at Stan
ford easy. On the contrary, when he was
a freshman, Menninger says he "just
wanted to go home." He added that he
"totally changed directions his sophomore
year" after taking math, physics and chem
istry in the fall.
"I crashed and burned at the end of that
quarter," he said. "I was on academic
probation. I could only take 12 to 15 units,
and I had to pass 12."
Dave started taking art and photography
courses again, as he had done in high
school. When he looked in "Courses and
Degrees" and saw he could mjyor in pho-
