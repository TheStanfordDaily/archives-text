# Senior writes essays in many media — and with junked cars
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough 
Not every abandoned *64 Dodge Rambler
gets a second lease on life. Even fewer are
reborn as works of art.
Yet, to David Menninger, a senior moor
ing in photography and design, projects
such as this creative resurrection seem to
come naturally.
When he was assigned to create a
photographic essay about a social condition
this spring for a design synthesis class,
Menninger went straight to the junkyard.
He bought the Dodge for about $130 and
had it towed to Manzanita Park, where he
lives.
He took out the front seats and spray
painted all the windows black — except
♦,he windshield, which he shrouded in a
white sheet. He completed his project by
hooking up two video monitors under the

dashboard, as well as a pair of speakers.
Sitting outside the car in one of the front
seats he had removed, Menninger con
trolled the three elements of his essay —
music, video and slides — for the pas
sengers of his sensory odyssey.
What the students in his class experi
enced, three at a time, is a reflection of
Dave's unique style. First, he piped Bul
garian choir music through the speakers.
"You could hear that there were words,"
Menninger said, "but you couldn't under
stand them."
The videotapes of junkyards full of cars
in "an awful state of disrepair" began next,
Menninger continued. He carried the
images one step further by projecting slides
of advertisements for new cars through the
white-sheeted windshield. After the slides
ended, Menninger turned off the video
cameras and then the music, reversing the

way the piece began.
Other students and the course professor,
Matt Kahn, were astounded. "It was a
most complex undertaking that came off
without a hitch," Kahn said. "The project
is not awe-inspiring in its nature," he con
tinued, "but it deals with the prosaic in
very insightful ways."
Breathing new life into the everyday
seems to be Menninger's primary strength.
But, characteristically, he understates this
talent, saying only, "I'm into the idea of
pattern and repetition."
One reason Menninger may look for
something new in the midst of pattern and
repetition is his family background. His
parents both graduated from Stanford in
1953. Menninger followed their pattern,
along with three of his five siblings.
Yet, as the only art msyor in a family
that includes multiple physicians and a

doctoral candidate, David struggled with
his own identity. He admits he felt "pres
sure to find somehow, somewhere that I
might fit in."
This has not made his experience at Stan
ford easy. On the contrary, when he was
a freshman, Menninger says he "just
wanted to go home." He added that he
"totally changed directions his sophomore
year" after taking math, physics and chem
istry in the fall.
"I crashed and burned at the end of that
quarter," he said. "I was on academic
probation. I could only take 12 to 15 units,
and I had to pass 12."
Dave started taking art and photography
courses again, as he had done in high
school. When he looked in "Courses and
Degrees" and saw he could mjyor in pho-

tography, he realized that was
what he wanted to do. And when
he took a course in basic design
from Kahn, he decided to simul
taneously pursue both fields. "I'm
trying to get my diploma to say
photography and design," Men
ninger said, "but I have to swing
some things unit-wise."
And as it is, Menninger will not
officially graduate until he com
pletes the language requirement,
as well as the non-Western culture
distribution requirement.
His mother, Connie Libbey
Menninger, is proud of him any
way. "David is just one of these
multiply talented kids who's also
very personable and outgoing and
relates to people well. He's an en
trepreneur," she said. "He's will
ing to try anything."
Mrs. Menninger, a former busi
ness manager for The Daily,
recalled an example of her son's
enthusiasm. "A Christmas and a
half ago we decided to plunge and
get him a video camera," she
began. "We all went to dinner at
this really nice restaurant."
(According to Mrs. Menninger,
taking the "wild and woolly"
bunch out to dinner is the best

way to get everyone together.
And, while they used to be
satisfied with any restaurant, she
med how they now "want a really
swell meal.")
"We were eating in what is also
their conference room, so there
were video monitors hooked up.
David got the camera out, set it
all up and filmed the dinner, in
cluding the cook and the waiters."
Menninger has put his camera
to use in projects since then. To
create his show "The Art of the
Dive," which was on display at
the Coffee House during March,
he videotaped divers and then
made screened photographs from
the videotape.
This sort of technical artwork
is a strong interest of Men
ninger's. Currently, he is
employed at a Palo Alto computer
graphics firm. His card, which he
proudly shares, reads "Animated
Systems and Design — Profes

sional Presentations on Diskette
— David Menninger, Il
lustrator/Designer."
"I am at ease with the techie
types," he said. "I work with cur
riculum that is technical in na
ture," he said of his job. "I can
at least fathom some of that."
He certainly related with the
"techie types" at Stanford well.
Dave said he liked living in Cedro
House because people were inter
ested in the projects he was work
ing on in the dorm. "I'd be making
some foam core model or some
thing. It was fun to let other
people experience this. It was neat
to let other people know [that art]
is here."
And he found Stanford to be
relatively supportive of the arts.
"A lot more money goes into sci
ence just because it commands it,
but the Art Department likes its
size. It's a comfortable place, not
too prominent," he said.
And he said he has enjoyed
"finding a place" for himself, "get
ting a relatively large amount of
attention, and giving back to the
system."
"I tried to put a lot into it,"he
explained.
His efforts did not go unap
preciated. "David was a teacher's
dream," Kahn said. "He is indeed
a student that I'm close to and
proud of and will miss."
