# Caps and gowns? No thanks
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz 
Take a look around this Sunday at the academic
tradition wrapped up in the caps and gowns worn
by the graduating students. Now imagine a gradu
ating class without this garb.
The "No Cap and Gown" movement which
changed the look of Stanford's Commencement cer
emonies in 1970 seems very distant from today.
While this year's graduates puzzle over how to
smuggle champagne into the Stadium under their
robes (not hard to do, folks), graduates puzzled over
more serious concerns in 1970 — the year America's
campuses turned into a battleground.
It was that year that more than 300 Stanford
students passed up graduating in the traditional
cap and gown to protest the United States' presence
in Southeast Asia.
The events of 1970 must seem like a dream —
or a nightmare — to today's Stanford students. In
May of that year, the University was virtually shut
down for two weeks as club-wielding, rock-throwing
students protested the presence of the Air Force
ROTC at Stanford. The protests came as then-
President Richard Nixon was sending troops to Cam
bodia. Protesters battled police and shattered
windows across campus.

Other campuses were hit even harder. Four pro
testing students were killed by National Guardsmen
at Kent State in Ohio. In California, Governor
Ronald Reagan ordered the entire University of
California system closed for four days so students
could reflect on the violence of the past weeks on
various UC campuses around the state.
Some schools, such as Boston University, simply
canceled the final weeks of school, sending students
away from campus and even scrapping graduation
ceremonies.
Eventually the rioting at Stanford gave way to a
more peaceful strike. But classes were canceled or
virtually empty as students concerned with the war
continued to protest the presence of ROTC on
campus. It was not until University President Ken
neth Pitzer announced that the ROTC programs
would be moved off campus in 1971 that classes
were fully able to resume.
Still, Stanford students remained intensely polit
ical, and as a part of that activism the "No Cap
and Gown" movement was started by the senior
class. Seniors had the opportunity to commit the
rental fee for their graduation vestments to a fund
which would be used during the upcoming elections
to support candidates committed to peace.
