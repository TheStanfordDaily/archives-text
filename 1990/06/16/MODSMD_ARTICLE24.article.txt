A formula, a phrase remains —
but the best is lost.
— Edna St. Vincent-Millay
DON'T REMEMBER the
landmarks at the expense
of the landscape.
Go take a look at the postcards
on sale in the Bookstore — you
know, gold-tinged Memorial
Church, the shaded outer Quad,
the sun-blanched walls of Stan
ford's sandstone tower. That's
how visitors remember Stanford.
Of course, we'll remember it
that way, too. Stanford's Spanish
Mission-style architecture is un
forgettable. If it's sunny for Com
mencement and the sky is a very
clear, very dark blue, then glance
up at Hoover Tower — doesn't it
look like it was etched right onto
the surface of the sky? Despite
Hoover's ugly politics, Hoo Tow
does make a beautiful landmark.
Commencement is also a
landmark and a milestone, com

memorating for most of us the
end of our years at Stanford. Yet
far more important to you than
this milestone are the roads you
traveled to get here, and the
people who traveled them with
you.
At your departmental cere
mony, look around at your class
mates. You will see most of them
again only in another 20 or 25
years — and some of them, never
— so you'll want to remember
them as they are now, young and
fresh and hopeful. But they're all
wearing funny black hats. Do you
want to remember them in funny
black hats?
Remember instead how the girl
sitting across from you looked
every morning when she came
down to breakfast. Remember
how the guy behind you would
paint a red "S" on his chest for
every football game. Remember
the girl you saw go whizzing by
on a skateboard, barefooted.

And whenever you think about
your favorite profs, don't remem
ber them sweltering in their heavy
doctoral robes like caged macaws.
Remember instead their dumb
jokes, their stirring lectures, their
hair-raising finals.
I'll never forget the time last
October when Ron Rebholz inter
rupted his lecture to ask me the
score of a Giants game. I'll never
forget the day last March when
Rob Polhemus concluded his lec
ture by singing to the entire class.
I'll never forget how Leslie Cal
houn started to weep in Great
Works as she lectured on the
death of Aeneas.
ALL GOOD THINGS must
come to an end. But it's so
hard to turn the page —
the work seems unfinished. I
want to go back and rewrite my
entire freshman year. I want to


Lora Dawn
Headrick
add a chapter to my sophomore
and junior years — something
like, "How I Made a Difference
at Stanford."
I like my senior year just the
way it is — writing for The Daily
was the best thing I ever did at
Stanford. But I was so busy. I'd
like some more time ...
Instead of time, though, I have
a little space in which to write
my conclusions. Here's what I
want to say: Be kind to children,
walk barefooted as often as pos
sible, listen to jazz music, recycle,
never put ideology ahead of
people, always be grateful to God
for the life that you have.
