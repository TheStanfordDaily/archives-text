They're avuncular.
University President Donald
Kennedy said so himself: "I think
Jean (Fetter) and I can be avun
cular without being parental."
(For those of you who haven't
taken the SAT test in several
years, "avuncular" means "uncle

Kennedy sees himself and Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter as images "of the
adult who doesn't shrink from

before the student body.
"I think we're probably the first
two people that students meet at

For both Kennedy and Fetter,
the world outside their respective
office doors is delightfully refresh
ing. "It never ceases to amaze me
â€” the breadth and depth of talent
here," said Fetter.
In a single week this month,
she says, she heard the Stanford
Orchestra's spring concert, spoke
to the Society of Women En
gineers, observed the unveiling of
a solar car in the Quad, heard an
impromptu concert by the Men
dicants, and went to the track and
field awards. A typical week.

to class, I could be busy every
