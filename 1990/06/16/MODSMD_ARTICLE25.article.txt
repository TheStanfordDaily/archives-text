# He's avuncular. She's indescribable. They're unforgettable.

They're avuncular.
University President Donald
Kennedy said so himself: "I think
Jean (Fetter) and I can be avun
cular without being parental."
(For those of you who haven't
taken the SAT test in several
years, "avuncular" means "uncle
like.")
Kennedy sees himself and Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter as images "of the
adult who doesn't shrink from
delivering friendly advice on the
basis of experience, but doesn't
think of himself as a controlling
parent either."
"That's the perfect niche," Ken
nedy said.
He and Fetter fill it perfectly.
Known as "Don" and "Dean
Jean," the two are often billed as
a pair at public appearances
before the student body.
"I think we're probably the first
two people that students meet at
Stanford," said Fetter. "We appear
as a pair at Orientation, and we're
probably the pair that's most
visible in the dorms."
Fetter says that, except for "the
reading period" when she reviews
freshman applications, she visits
dorms about once a week. "The
best thing about this job is the
opportunity to get personally in
volved with individual students."
Kennedy agrees. His constant
contact with students "is one of
the great joys of my life," he said.
"You know, if you just sit in your
office and wait for things to come
to you, all the stuff that comes
through the door is gonna be ter
rible," Kennedy said.
For both Kennedy and Fetter,
the world outside their respective
office doors is delightfully refresh
ing. "It never ceases to amaze me
— the breadth and depth of talent
here," said Fetter.
In a single week this month,
she says, she heard the Stanford
Orchestra's spring concert, spoke
to the Society of Women En
gineers, observed the unveiling of
a solar car in the Quad, heard an
impromptu concert by the Men
dicants, and went to the track and
field awards. A typical week.
"Just as you could be busy
every minute of the day not going
to class, I could be busy every

minute of the day not doing the
job that I'm paid to do," she said.
Luckily, both Fetter and Ken
nedy love the jobs they're paid to
do. In addition to reading thou
sands of applications, Fetter also
serves as a freshman/sophomore
adviser every year. She says her
advisees "are people who have
touched my life in ways that will
be long-lasting."
Kennedy as well has developed
a fondness for members of every
graduating class. "My memories
of students here are special and
individual," he said.
Neither Kennedy nor Fetter
would venture to characterize the
Class of '90 as a group. "Stanford
is about individuals," Fetter said.
However, she said, she does re

member certain statistical char
acteristics of classes. "I remember
this class that's graduating is the
second-highest applicant pool
ever," she says, adding with a
laugh, "and there's nobody from
West Virginia."
Fetter's sense of humor has
stood her in good stead during
Big Game week; she makes an
annual appearance in "Gaieties,"
the student-written production
celebrating the battle for the Axe.
Last fall, Fetter appeared in the
sketch "Admission: Impossible."
Kennedy, who usually makes a
guest appearance in Gaieties, was
in Japan during this year's fes
tivities. However, theater-goers
were treated to a brief audio-taped
"cameo" appearance.
The script called for the four
Gaieties heroes to meet up with
Kennedy and his wife Robin in
the steam tunnels under Green
Library. When the students ex

pressed surprise at meeting Stan
ford's "first family" underground,
Kennedy replied, "I have needs,
Robin has needs, and that's why
we're down here spelunking."
Kennedy, of course, didn't write
the script. But his willingness to
play along with the act is a mea
sure of his faith in Stanford stu
dents' sense of humor. "Whimsy
is an absolute endemic character
istic around here," he said.
It's nice to know Kennedy is
such a good sport — maybe he
won't mind getting beaned by a
few illicit champagne corks. "I
think by and large, Stanford stu
dents are pretty good at working
and playing," he said.
That healthy playfulness and
refreshing spirit makes it hard
for Fetter and Kennedy to bid
farewell to the Class of '90. "It's
very hard to say goodbye," Fetter
says. "So I don't ever say goodbye.
It's au revoir."

second-highest applicant pool
ever," she says, adding with a
laugh, "and there's nobody from
West Virginia."
Fetter's sense of humor has
stood her in good stead during
Big Game week; she makes an
annual appearance in "Gaieties,"
the student-written production
celebrating the battle for the Axe.
Last fall, Fetter appeared in the
sketch "Admission: Impossible."
Kennedy, who usually makes a
guest appearance in Gaieties, was
in Japan during this year's fes
tivities. However, theater-goers
were treated to a brief audio-taped
"cameo" appearance.
The script called for the four
Gaieties heroes to meet up with
Kennedy and his wife Robin in
the steam tunnels under Green
Library. When the students ex

pressed surprise at meeting Stan
ford's "first family" underground,
Kennedy replied, "I have needs,
Robin has needs, and that's why
we're down here spelunking."
Kennedy, of course, didn't write
the script. But his willingness to
play along with the act is a mea
sure of his faith in Stanford stu
dents' sense of humor. "Whimsy
is an absolute endemic character
istic around here," he said.
It's nice to know Kennedy is
such a good sport — maybe he
won't mind getting beaned by a
few illicit champagne corks. "I
think by and large, Stanford stu
dents are pretty good at working
and playing," he said.
That healthy playfulness and
refreshing spirit makes it hard
for Fetter and Kennedy to bid
farewell to the Class of '90. "It's
very hard to say goodbye," Fetter
says. "So I don't ever say goodbye.
It's au revoir."
