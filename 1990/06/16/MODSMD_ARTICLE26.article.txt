# The
						colors of Commencement
## Academic fashion rooted in tradition 
### Mia Manzulli Lora Dawn Headrick 
Ever wonder why University President
Donald Kennedy makes his grand march to
the Commencement podium bedecked in a
crimson-lined hood edged in golden yellow,
and a velvet-trimmed robe? His elaborate
dress might seem a little pompous — even
for a president — when compared to the
boring-black, hood-not-included gowns seniors
wear.
Well, Kennedy's not out to bedazzle the
Commencement crowd; he's simply following
an age-old graduation tradition. Those colors
in the president's academic dress identify not
only the college or university that granted his
degree (in Kennedy's case, Harvard Universi
ty), but also the subject in which the degree
was granted (biological sciences).
Now, seniors are probably crinkling their
brows and saying, "Well, I'm graduating from
Stanford. Shouldn't I at least get to add a
cardinal stripe to my gown?" The answer,
dear graduates, is no. You see, only doctoral
gowns and robes have trimmings. So unless
you cram in some Ph.D. coursework before
graduation, your options are — well — black.
The Dress of Ages
Academic dress is rooted in tradition. Dating
back to the Middle Ages, caps and robes were
worn by scholars at early European univer
sities. Since scholars were also clerics, they
adopted robes similar to those of their monas
tic order. Drafty buildings necessitated caps
and capes with hoods for warmth.
And why the brighter colors, like Kennedy's
bold crimson gown? The Catholic Church had
something to do with that.
When the Church began losing control of

universities, academic costume began employ
ing brighter colors and a variety of patterns
for the gowns and accompanying head-dresses.
Everybody just got tired of wearing black all
the time.
Academic dress has been worn in the United
States since colonial times, but it was not
until 1893 that an intercollegiate commission
recommended the uniform code of academic
costume still followed today.
Design by degree
The design of the gowns worn in academic
ceremonies varies with the degree held. The
bachelor's gown, for all graduating seniors, is
very simple — long, pointed sleeves are its
only distinguishing feature.
For master's degree recipients, the gown
has an oblong sleeve with the rear part cut
square. The front part of the sleeve features
a cutaway arc, to distinguish it from gowns
worn by bachelor's degree candidates.
Only the doctor's gown, by far the most
elaborate academic costume, bears any trim
mings. These are velvet panels down the front
and three velvet bars across the sleeves. The
velvet is usually black, or it may be a color
designating the subject in which the wearer
holds a degree. Some American universities
also have doctoral robes, which are a color
other than black.
At Stanford, these doctoral robes are black
and red with sleeves lined in a color indicating
the academic field of the wearer. A specially
designed hood and a velvet academic bonnet
are worn with these distinguished robes.
Hoods have an even larger symbolic mean
ing. The width of the trimming indicates the
level of the degree; the colors of the lining
are those of the college or university which
granted the degree. The Cardinal is used for

Stanford. The color of the binding or edging
heralds the mtyor field of study.
Full spectrum of colors
White stands for the humanities; the sci
ences use golden yellow; crimson is for com
munication students; copper represents
economics; orange is for engineering; dark
blue is philosophy; pink is for music; brown
for the fine arts; the law graduates wear
purple; light blue is for the School of Educa
tion; green for medicine; and drab (yes, drab)
for the Graduate School of Business.
So the chances of even a double-majoring
Phi Beta Kappa honors student being mis
taken for anything but a lowly undergraduate
are slim. This complex system of color coding
simply leaves bachelor's degree candidates in
the dark.
At least the "mortarboard" cap is the same
for everyone. Black with a cloth cover, the
cap sports a standard black tassel, although
those worn with doctoral robes may have a
gold tassel. All in all, though, the identical
mortarboards lend a unifying visual motif to
the diverse colors of academic dress visible
during Commencement.
Unless, of course, you happen to be grad
uating from the Civil Engineering Department
with a concentration in construction. These
graduates wear hardhats at their departmen
tal ceremony.
Departmental differences
Dress is not the only trait distinguishing
Stanford graduates. Although everybody takes
part in the University ceremony held at Stan
ford Stadium, special departmental ceremo
nies honor the graduates individually.
