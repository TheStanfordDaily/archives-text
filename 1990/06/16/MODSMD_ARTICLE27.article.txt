# Eyeing the future
## Seniors leave gift of abstract art 
### Robert L Jamieson Jr 
As the graduating Class of
'90 marches forward into the
future, it leaves behind a gift
that will keep a watchful gaze
over Stanford for years to
come.
"The Sculptor's Eye
(Homage to Giacometti)," an
abstract work of art, was un
veiled on Wednesday afternoon
at Meyer Library as part of an
annual spring tradition — the
presentation of a Senior Class
gift to the campus community.
The oval-shaped structure,
which resembles an eye, is com
posed of welded stainless steel
and silicon bronze. It stands
four feet high and is 35 inches
wide.
"Eye" creator Roger Barr of
Santa Rosa, Calif., said his
sculpture was a "challenging
labor of love." He cited the dif
ficulty of working with welded
steel as a hurdle to be overcome
throughout the creative proc
ess. But Barr was able to com
plete the sculpture, honoring
Swiss sculptor and artist Al
berto Giacometti, in just under
three years.
Giacometti, who died in
1966, created sculptures which
reflected surrealist influences.
His works were characterized
by deformed naturalism — the
use of exaggeration, elongation

and irrational, dreamlike
detail.
"The Sculptor's Eye is my
way of paying homage to
Giacometti's legacy," Barr said.
"This is my gift to Giacometti
and my gift to Stanford stu
dents," he added.
Barr, a Pomona College grad
uate, said that a university set
ting was most appropriate for
the sculpture. He wanted Stan
ford to be the site for the piece
because of his "great respect
for the school." Barr added that
a personal admiration for the
work of professors in the Stan
ford Art department also
figured in his decision.
Senior Class president
Patrick Devine was delighted
and surprised that Barr singled
out Stanford for his sculpture.
"Originally when [Barr]
finished it, he didn't want to
sell it." Devine said. "The piece
really meant a lot to him," he
added.
According to Devine, the
sculpture was costly. But the
Senior Class is not paying the
full worth of the piece. Michael
Roark, another Senior Class
president, said that Barr is ex
tending a philanthropic hand
to Stanford's first graduating
class of the decade. "He is sel
ling [the work] to us far below
what it's worth," Roark said.
