# Seniors include Bart, Gorby memorabilia in expanded capsule
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr 
Bart Simpson won't go down
in the world's history books as a
famous American politician. But
when the Class of '90 time capsule
is sealed in a main Quad ceremony
this week, the "cartoon bad boy"
will join Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev as part of Stanford his
tory.
Filling and sealing the capsule
is a time-honored rite of passage
for the graduating class. Tradi
tionally, the capsule contains
items that reflect campus trends
and events which occurred during

the class's four-year tenure on the
Farm.
But according to Senior Class
president Leslie Hatamiya, this
year's capsule is enjoying
perestroika of sorts. "Last year's
class only had 25 items," she said.
"We have 72."
The number of items in the
capsule has been increased to
embrace a wide array of cultural
and social phenomena affecting
America off the Farm.
Seniors selected items for the
capsule based on a questionnaire
circulated earlier this year.
Hatamiya said the wide spec

tram of items show that students
are concerned with more that just
life on the Farm. "The pop culture
stuff is more a reflection of the
time that we are here, rather than
some specific stuff about Stan
ford," she stressed.
Joining a bumper-sticker of the
Simpsons and a program from
Gorbachev's June 4 address is a
cornucopia of items — the people's
choice. Items placed in the time
capsule vary from a Pacific Bell
telephone bill and a Big Game
ticket to a Western Culture Great
