Amid all the joy and celebration after
the Stanford women's basketball
team returned home with the
NCAA title, it had to have been easy to
avoid thinking about. But it cannot be
wished away.
Sometime, maybe this week at gradu
ation, maybe when school starts again,
maybe not till the season begins, every
body will remember that Jennifer Azzi,
Stacy Parson and Katy Steding will never
again suit up in Stanford uniforms.
With all the great memories those three
have provided, with all they have done
for women's basketball here, it seems
almost impossible to say goodbye. But
we must do just that.
As they have written a most exceptional
chapter in the annals of Stanford Uni
versity, they will never be forgotten. Nor
will they ever forget what they accom
plished.
A look at the school's record books gives
one some idea of the impact they made.
Points scored: Azzi is second, Steding

third. Rebounds: Steding is second, Azzi
11th. Assists: Azzi is first, Steding
seventh. Games played: Steding is first,
Azzi second and Parson fourth.
Their impact, of course, cannot be mea
sured in mere statistics. When those three
committed to Stanford, the team was not
a winner. As freshmen, they had to beat
Hawaii in the season finale to finish .500;
as seniors they won a national title.
Azzi became the symbol of the team's
success. As a junior she was named the
Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year
and was tabbed as an All-American. This
season she received those two honors
again in addition to the two most pres
tigious national player-of-the-year
awards: the Wade Trophy and the Nais
mith.
Two days after returning from Tennes
see, Azzi sat in an empty Maples Pavilion.
She talked about her collegiate career
ending and the fact that she would never
again play there in front of her classmates
and friends. "All year I've sort of been
preparing myself," she said. Winning the
NCAA crown has made it easier for her
to deal with things.

"If we had gone out any other way,
I'd be sad. But we did all that you could
possibly do," she added. "I'm ready to
do something new."
With all the media attention she re
ceived during the Final Four, Azzi did
not have a chance to let it all sink in.
"While it was going on I don't think I
realized what was happening.
"I didn't have time to enjoy it. I was
doing, doing, doing stuff all the time,"
she said. Finally, back in the gym in
which she gave so many people so many
memories, she began to savor the feeling.
"I'm just amazed. I just feel a really
incredible sense of satisfaction."
Steding was equally ebullient. "It
doesn't feel like it's over," she explained.
"We're all still celebrating. It was prob
ably the best day of my life. It was the
culmination of 12 or so years of hard
work.
"It didn't always look like it was going
to pay off."
Parson was just starting to put things
in perspective. "It's kind of setting in a
little more. You kind of realize the sig
nificance of it. I don't think I had many

expectations coming in (four years ago),"
she said.
Neither did Steding. When Tara Van-
Derveer recruited her, Steding said she
listened to the coach talk about building
a national power and nodded her head
while thinking, "Yeah, right." It's not
that the idea wasn't attractive to her;
it's just that she had trouble seeing it
reach fruition.
Steding said since she was not a big
time player in high school she had trouble
believing what she was hearing. "Tara
thought we all had the ability to be a
team that could make it to the Final
Four," Steding remembered.
"That sounds great but it's kind of like
a pipe dream. I guess we should have
had more faith."
Azzi saw things differently. "I was
maybe overconfident. I envisioned us in
the Final Four three out of my four years
here," she said, adding that maybe the
team would have won two national titles
along the way.
Still, Azzi is anything but disatisfied.
As she was reminded time and time again
at the Final Four, her return to Tennessee

provided the perfect storybook ending for
her career.
It wasn't lost on her either. "Personal
ly, I'm not going to lie. It felt great to
win in Tennessee," she said, because it
was a chance to prove the naysayers
wrong. "They said 'y° u shouldn't go to
Stanford; you're not going to win there.'"
In her triumphant return, all that was
in the past. Azzi is from Oak Ridge, 20
miles from Knoxville, the site of the Final
Four. After the championship game, the
mayor stopped by her house to present
Azzi with the key to the city. The local
TV station showed highlights from the
victory party.
Azzi would have been just as happy if
the focus were elsewhere. "It makes me
feel bad. I drew a lot of attention away
from the real story, which is our team,"
she said.
Self-effacing to the end, Azzi took time
to credit her close friend and backcourt
mate, Sor\ja Henning, one of the many
overlooked stars on the team. "If I could
give it all to her, I would. I used to run

the point and there's no way I
would be free to do the things I
have without a great point guard,"
she said.
Azzi related a story from an
interview she had this year in
which a reporter told Azzi her
statistics were really not that im
pressive. It annoyed her not be
cause she cared about the num
bers, Azzi said, but because she
didn't ask to be interviewed and
there she was, being put down.

'If we had gone out
any other way, I'd
be sad.

Meanwhile, without a spectac
ular scoring average or shooting
percentage, Azzi collected the big
gest honors in her sport. "If
there's anything I take pride in,
it's that they recognize a team
player and team play. That's what
basketball is all about."
And it's certainly what the Car
dinal is all about. "Unity is some
thing we've stressed as long as
we've been here," Steding said.
"Even when we were a terrible
team. This year, especially, we've
made a conscious effort to remain
close."
They can stay together because
there is no division between
starters and reserves, between up
perclassmen and underclassmen.
Parson, perhaps better than
anyone, symbolizes the Stanford
magic. She played a reserve role
for four years without ever com
plaining.
VanDerveer has stressed the
"team-first" concept since she ar
rived her. "Stacy Parson sets the
tone for that more than anyone
else," the coach said.
And she and her classmates
have set a standard for all Stan
ford teams in the future. They
will be dearly missed and fondly
remembered.

and was tabbed as an All-American. This
season she received those two honors
again in addition to the two most pres
tigious national player-of-the-year
awards: the Wade Trophy and the Nais
mith.
Two days after returning from Tennes
see, Azzi sat in an empty Maples Pavilion.
She talked about her collegiate career
ending and the fact that she would never
again play there in front of her classmates
and friends. "All year I've sort of been
preparing myself," she said. Winning the
NCAA crown has made it easier for her
to deal with things.

"If we had gone out any other way,
I'd be sad. But we did all that you could
possibly do," she added. "I'm ready to
do something new."
With all the media attention she re
ceived during the Final Four, Azzi did
not have a chance to let it all sink in.
"While it was going on I don't think I
realized what was happening.
"I didn't have time to enjoy it. I was
doing, doing, doing stuff all the time,"
she said. Finally, back in the gym in
which she gave so many people so many
memories, she began to savor the feeling.
"I'm just amazed. I just feel a really
incredible sense of satisfaction."
Steding was equally ebullient. "It
doesn't feel like it's over," she explained.
"We're all still celebrating. It was prob
ably the best day of my life. It was the
culmination of 12 or so years of hard
work.
"It didn't always look like it was going
to pay off."
Parson was just starting to put things
in perspective. "It's kind of setting in a
little more. You kind of realize the sig
nificance of it. I don't think I had many

expectations coming in (four years ago),"
she said.
Neither did Steding. When Tara Van-
Derveer recruited her, Steding said she
listened to the coach talk about building
a national power and nodded her head
while thinking, "Yeah, right." It's not
that the idea wasn't attractive to her;
it's just that she had trouble seeing it
reach fruition.
Steding said since she was not a big
time player in high school she had trouble
believing what she was hearing. "Tara
thought we all had the ability to be a
team that could make it to the Final
Four," Steding remembered.
"That sounds great but it's kind of like
a pipe dream. I guess we should have
had more faith."
Azzi saw things differently. "I was
maybe overconfident. I envisioned us in
the Final Four three out of my four years
here," she said, adding that maybe the
team would have won two national titles
along the way.
Still, Azzi is anything but disatisfied.
As she was reminded time and time again
at the Final Four, her return to Tennessee

provided the perfect storybook ending for
her career.
It wasn't lost on her either. "Personal
ly, I'm not going to lie. It felt great to
win in Tennessee," she said, because it
was a chance to prove the naysayers
wrong. "They said 'y° u shouldn't go to
Stanford; you're not going to win there.'"
In her triumphant return, all that was
in the past. Azzi is from Oak Ridge, 20
miles from Knoxville, the site of the Final
Four. After the championship game, the
mayor stopped by her house to present
Azzi with the key to the city. The local
TV station showed highlights from the
victory party.
Azzi would have been just as happy if
the focus were elsewhere. "It makes me
feel bad. I drew a lot of attention away
from the real story, which is our team,"
she said.
Self-effacing to the end, Azzi took time
to credit her close friend and backcourt
mate, Sor\ja Henning, one of the many
overlooked stars on the team. "If I could
give it all to her, I would. I used to run

the point and there's no way I
would be free to do the things I
have without a great point guard,"
she said.
Azzi related a story from an
interview she had this year in
which a reporter told Azzi her
statistics were really not that im
pressive. It annoyed her not be
cause she cared about the num
bers, Azzi said, but because she
didn't ask to be interviewed and
there she was, being put down.

'If we had gone out
any other way, I'd
be sad.

Meanwhile, without a spectac
ular scoring average or shooting
percentage, Azzi collected the big
gest honors in her sport. "If
there's anything I take pride in,
it's that they recognize a team
player and team play. That's what
basketball is all about."
And it's certainly what the Car
dinal is all about. "Unity is some
thing we've stressed as long as
we've been here," Steding said.
"Even when we were a terrible
team. This year, especially, we've
made a conscious effort to remain
close."
They can stay together because
there is no division between
starters and reserves, between up
perclassmen and underclassmen.
Parson, perhaps better than
anyone, symbolizes the Stanford
magic. She played a reserve role
for four years without ever com
plaining.
VanDerveer has stressed the
"team-first" concept since she ar
rived her. "Stacy Parson sets the
tone for that more than anyone
else," the coach said.
And she and her classmates
have set a standard for all Stan
ford teams in the future. They
will be dearly missed and fondly
remembered.
Amid all the joy and celebration after
the Stanford women's basketball
team returned home with the
NCAA title, it had to have been easy to
avoid thinking about. But it cannot be
wished away.
Sometime, maybe this week at gradu
ation, maybe when school starts again,
maybe not till the season begins, every
body will remember that Jennifer Azzi,
Stacy Parson and Katy Steding will never
again suit up in Stanford uniforms.
With all the great memories those three
have provided, with all they have done
for women's basketball here, it seems
almost impossible to say goodbye. But
we must do just that.
As they have written a most exceptional
chapter in the annals of Stanford Uni
versity, they will never be forgotten. Nor
will they ever forget what they accom
plished.
A look at the school's record books gives
one some idea of the impact they made.
Points scored: Azzi is second, Steding

third. Rebounds: Steding is second, Azzi
11th. Assists: Azzi is first, Steding
seventh. Games played: Steding is first,
Azzi second and Parson fourth.
Their impact, of course, cannot be mea
sured in mere statistics. When those three
committed to Stanford, the team was not
a winner. As freshmen, they had to beat
Hawaii in the season finale to finish .500;
as seniors they won a national title.
Azzi became the symbol of the team's
success. As a junior she was named the
Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year
and was tabbed as an All-American. This
