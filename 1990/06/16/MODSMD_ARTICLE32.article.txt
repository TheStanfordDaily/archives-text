# Olesen's long journey nearly ended at the start

After redshirting her freshman
year at Stanford, Laura Olesen
was ready to quit.
"I was scared of everything,"
said Olesen, a fifth-year senior
and the captain of Stanford's
women's volleyball team in 1989.

"I didn't feel ready physically, I
didn't know anyone, and I was
afraid of everybody."
Yet of all her accomplishments
as a five-year member and a four
year starter for the Cardinal,
Olesen remains most proud of her
decision at that early point in her
career to remain with the club —
an action taken despite her own

characteristic insecurity.
It has been to the immeasurable
benefit of the team that she opted
to remain. Guiding Stanford to
the NCAA regionals four consecu
tive years, Olesen has proved to
be both an instrumental force of
cohesion for the Cardinal and a
feared foe for the squad's oppo
nents.
It has been a gradual growth
in mental strength that enabled
Olesen to appear in the 1987
NCAA championship match, to
break the school career record in
block assists previously held by
1988 U.S. Olympic captain Kim
Oden, and to unify a 1989 team
that was in the midst of a difficult
transition from youth to experi
ence.
Building this confidence,
though, was never really an easy
task with the La Jolla, Calif., na
tive initially considered a project
by the Cardinal coaching staff.
"On the first day of preseason
practice during her freshman
year," Coach Don Shaw recalls,
"Laura was so scared and in
timidated that on the first serving
drill she couldn't serve the ball
over the net."
"I cried the whole drive up to
preseason camp," Olesen admits.
"I pictured myself getting
destroyed every day in practice."
While identifying this intense
inferiority complex was easy,
resolving it, however, proved ex
ceedingly difficult. "For the whole
first year I was scared to death
to play for the team," Olesen said.
"I didn't know what to expect."
Olesen attributed her eventual
boost in confidence to a conver
sation she had the following sum
mer. "A friend told me to just go
for it because I had nothing to
lose," Olesen explained. "For some
reason, that really clicked with
me. It made a huge difference."
Concrete results immediately
followed. During the preseason
practice before her sophomore
year, Olesen claimed a starting
position she would never relin
quish and went on to play in the

NCAA final four.
Since then, Olesen emerged as
a consistent, steadying force on a
young, up-and-down team. De
spite her own perception of not
being a very "glorious, dazzling"
player, Olesen established herself
as a standard of reliabilty.
Hitting over .280 for her career,
recording 134 blocks in her junior
season alone and starting for two
final four teams, Olesen is justly
lauded by Shaw for her stellar
performance.
"When you look at the course
of four years and what Ole has
done," he said, "you just have to
be pleased with the results."
As the team entered the post
season yet again this year, fresh
man middle-blocking counterpart
Bev Oden said simply, "Ole has
been playing awesome."
Perhaps Olesen's most steadfast
contribution to the Cardinal was
the ability she showed to meld
the team together in 1989. Start
ing frequently in a lineup includ
ing three freshmen and a sopho
more, Olesen found herself as by
far the most experienced player
on the court. She took charge of
an unnerving situation.
"Laura has very high expecta
tions of herself and the team,"
Shaw noted, "but she has
definitely put the team before her
own personal goals."
Olesen, as captain, was respon
sible for organizing the team's ac
tivities, deciding practical issues
such as which uniforms the team
will wear, addressing any prob
lems, calling team meetings and
serving as a liaison between her
teammates and Shaw.
It is with this capacity that
Shaw is most impressed. "Al
though Laura's basically a shy
person," he said, "more so than
any other captain I've had, she's
come in and told me what's on
her mind. She's always commun
icated well."
"If something's bothering me,"
Olesen concurred, "I'll let him
know."
As the vigilant guardian of this

year's squad, Olesen was forced
for the first time to deal with an
inconsistent season.
"Laura has played on teams of
the present. Last year the team
went 28-3," Shaw said. "It's tough
now on her, Jennifer Chaffee and
Lara Asper (Stanford's three sen
iors) because this seems to be a
team of the future. It's been very
frustrating for them but they
have held up very well."
One unfortunate side-effect of
Olesen's persistent emphasis on
team and her innately reserved
character traits has been an ab
surd lack of recognition. Often
overshadowed by acclaimed team
mates such as Kim Oden, Wendi
Rush, Nancy Reno and Kristin
Klein, she has taken the attitude
that it is "nothing to be upset
over." Regardless, Shaw feels it is
unjust that Olesen has "not re
ceived the recognition she has
deserved."
Rarely riled up, Olesen simply
sticks to fundamentals, shrugs the
fame issue off and just continues
to extend her pacifying influence
about the team. "Ole's always the
one to calm us down/' Bev Oden
said. "She just has a way of
slowing things dovrn so that
everything seems better."
But while she always appears
collected to her teammates,
Olesen constantly finds herself
battling internally. It was never
a certainty, in fact, that the in
ternational relations magor would
return this year for her final
season of eligibility.
"[l9BBl was a hard year for
me," she said. "It's really hard to
play a college sport because when
I didn't succeed on the court, it
carried over to my studies. It
stemmed from my insecurity. I
just didn't want to go through all
that again."
After the season ended Olesen
went to Barcelona to finish her
studies and undertake a new goal:
learning Spanish. This time she
didn't shed a tear on the way.

Laura Olesen seriously considered leaving the volleyball team after
her freshman year. Instead, she went on to be a four-year starter
and broke the school record in block assists.
