# A 						Cardinal dynasty colored Green
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Behind every sports dynasty
there are special athletes
who make the winning pos
sible. As a rule, these athletes are
blessed with innate ability, put in
extra hours to improve them
selves and are tenacious compet
itors.
Look at Magic Johnson. Or Joe
Montana. Or Wayne Gretzky.
There is no question each has
God-given talent, a tremendous
work ethic and a burning desire
to win. The ultimate measure of
their success is in the champion
ships they bring home.
As the Stanford women's tennis
team has pieced together it's 65-
match consecutive victory streak
and captured five straight na
tional crowns, the closest thing
to a constant among the personnel
has been senior Lisa Green.
But while a Magic or a Gretzky
grabs all the headlines, Green has
rarely been the focal point of her
team. When she was a freshman,
Patty Fendick played No. 1 singles
and won the NCAA individual
championships. The next two
years, Tami Whitlinger took the
top spot in the lineup before
heading for the professional tour.
This season, defending NCAA
singles champion Sandra Birch
garnered all the attention until
Debbie Graham went on to take
the national title herself.
All the while, Green has been
winning nearly all of her matches
regardless of where she has played
in the lineup. She has compiled
a 93-17 career record in team play.
For good measure, Green reached
the semifinals of the NCAA
singles tournament her first three
years.
Her career has been character
ized by brilliant play under pres
sure, most notably at the 1988
national championships when the
Cardinal was an overwhelming
underdog to top-seeded Florida.
An injury to Whitlinger moved
Green into the No. 1 spot, where
she was thought to be over
matched.
Instead, she beat Florida's Halle
Cioffi, the nation's top-ranked
player, in the finals of the team
competition to lead Stanford to
victory.
The memory stands out in her
mind. "For me, of the nationals
that we won, that second year
was the most rewarding," she
says. "We weren't supposed to
win. Just to beat Florida wa3 so
great. Everyone said we couldn't
beat them." Foremost among the
Cardinal's detractors was Gator
Coach Andy Brandi.
He was confident Stanford
could not win with Green at No.
1. But Brandi made an error in
his calculations. Not only did he
underestimate Green's ability, he

underestimated her desire. The
Gators were one of just two teams
to defeat the Cardinal in 1988.
Green wanted nothing more than
to avenge that defeat and was able
to lift her game to achieve that
goal.
Fast forward to 1990. A
casual fan of Stanford ten
nis stops by to see the Car
dinal in action. The fan looks up
at the scoreboard to see who the
team's lone senior starter is play
ing today. "Who's Lisa got?"
The eyes look at the No. 1
matchup. Not there. "No surprise,
, maybe number two." Nope.
"Hmmm ... Where is she?" Fi
nally, one line from the bottom,
the board reads: Green vs. Sil
veria. "Number five? What's Lisa
Green doing playing five?"
An excellent question, and, as
is often the case, one with a couple
of answers. First, the Cardinal ar
guably has the most talented team
ever assembled. Green, Birch,
Graham, Meredith McGrath and
Teri Whitlinger could each play
No. 1 for any team in the country
— and win nearly every match.
Second, when the lineup was
being determined through inter
squad challenge matches in the
preseason, Green was not playing
very well — and she wasn't win
ning either. What had gone
wrong? "I think I just lost my
confidence," she says."In chal
lenge matches, I was not playing
well.
"Finally, I just wanted to prac
tice and figure out what was going
wrong," Green continues. "So

much of it was mental. I wasn't
really motivated."
Not surprisingly, playing near
the bottom of the lineup did little
to get her going. Sometimes,
Green says, she knew she could
go through the motions and win
anyway. The ability to coast much
of the time hurt her when she
met up with better opponents.
"When I'd play a tough match,
I wasn't match tough," she says.
There is something missing
from this picture of Green — and
it has nothing to do with her play.
A key player on ail those cham
pionship teams. A three-time
NCAA sngles semifinalist. A
SENIOR! If anyone could go to
Coach Frank Brennan and
demand to play higher in the
lineup, it would be Green.
And so she stormed into the
coach's office and did just that,
right? Wrong. All Green asked of
Brennan was to help her figure
out why she wasn't winning. In
the bigger picture, it did not mat
ter to her where she was playing
as long as the team continued to
do well.
It was in part her selflessness
that led her teammates to select
Green as team captain. At the
same time, part of what makes
her a good leader is that she isn't
consumed by the sport she plays.
"Tennis is just part of what I
do at school," Green says. "I've
loved being on a national cham
pionship team but the outside-of
tennis things have been really re
warding.
"I've just met so many incred
ible people here. I've really en

joyed my time here. The people
I've met and the experience I've
had are not replaceable."
Given all that, it seems hard to
believe Green almost didn't come
here at all. A native of San Jose,
she thought long and hard about
Brennan, the academic load and
being so close to home.
"I got the complete different im
pression of what Frank is really
like when I came on my recruiting
trip. He was very intimidating,"
she says.
The real Frank Brennan is a
polar opposite. "I can talk to him
about anything. He has a great
sense of humor. He knows what
to say. He can tell if you are
having problems outside of ten
nis," Green explains.
As for the academics, she has
done just fine. And, while the par
ents are just 40 minutes away,
she says,"I never go home."
As she struggled in the middle
of the season, Green disappeared
from the top tier of the collegiate
rankings and hardly seemed to be
a threat at NCAAs. A couple of
weeks before the tournament, she
was asked if a fourth straight
semifinal appearance might be in
the offing.
Green wouldn't make any pre
dictions but did say: "I can be
playing well enough. It's just a
matter of putting it all together.
I never think beforehand, 'Oh, I
have to get to the semis.' "
Oh, how close she came. Green
marched to the quarterfinals
before bowing out to Florida's
Nicole Arendt in a heartbreaking
three-setter.

Cioffi, the nation's top-ranked
player, in the finals of the team
competition to lead Stanford to
victory.
The memory stands out in her
mind. "For me, of the nationals
that we won, that second year
was the most rewarding," she
says. "We weren't supposed to
win. Just to beat Florida wa3 so
great. Everyone said we couldn't
beat them." Foremost among the
Cardinal's detractors was Gator
Coach Andy Brandi.
He was confident Stanford
could not win with Green at No.
1. But Brandi made an error in
his calculations. Not only did he
underestimate Green's ability, he

underestimated her desire. The
Gators were one of just two teams
to defeat the Cardinal in 1988.
Green wanted nothing more than
to avenge that defeat and was able
to lift her game to achieve that
goal.
Fast forward to 1990. A
casual fan of Stanford ten
nis stops by to see the Car
dinal in action. The fan looks up
at the scoreboard to see who the
team's lone senior starter is play
ing today. "Who's Lisa got?"
The eyes look at the No. 1
matchup. Not there. "No surprise,
, maybe number two." Nope.
"Hmmm ... Where is she?" Fi
nally, one line from the bottom,
the board reads: Green vs. Sil
veria. "Number five? What's Lisa
Green doing playing five?"
An excellent question, and, as
is often the case, one with a couple
of answers. First, the Cardinal ar
guably has the most talented team
ever assembled. Green, Birch,
Graham, Meredith McGrath and
Teri Whitlinger could each play
No. 1 for any team in the country
— and win nearly every match.
Second, when the lineup was
being determined through inter
squad challenge matches in the
preseason, Green was not playing
very well — and she wasn't win
ning either. What had gone
wrong? "I think I just lost my
confidence," she says."In chal
lenge matches, I was not playing
well.
"Finally, I just wanted to prac
tice and figure out what was going
wrong," Green continues. "So

much of it was mental. I wasn't
really motivated."
Not surprisingly, playing near
the bottom of the lineup did little
to get her going. Sometimes,
Green says, she knew she could
go through the motions and win
anyway. The ability to coast much
of the time hurt her when she
met up with better opponents.
"When I'd play a tough match,
I wasn't match tough," she says.
There is something missing
from this picture of Green — and
it has nothing to do with her play.
A key player on ail those cham
pionship teams. A three-time
NCAA sngles semifinalist. A
SENIOR! If anyone could go to
Coach Frank Brennan and
demand to play higher in the
lineup, it would be Green.
And so she stormed into the
coach's office and did just that,
right? Wrong. All Green asked of
Brennan was to help her figure
out why she wasn't winning. In
the bigger picture, it did not mat
ter to her where she was playing
as long as the team continued to
do well.
It was in part her selflessness
that led her teammates to select
Green as team captain. At the
same time, part of what makes
her a good leader is that she isn't
consumed by the sport she plays.
"Tennis is just part of what I
do at school," Green says. "I've
loved being on a national cham
pionship team but the outside-of
tennis things have been really re
warding.
"I've just met so many incred
ible people here. I've really en

joyed my time here. The people
I've met and the experience I've
had are not replaceable."
Given all that, it seems hard to
believe Green almost didn't come
here at all. A native of San Jose,
she thought long and hard about
Brennan, the academic load and
being so close to home.
"I got the complete different im
pression of what Frank is really
like when I came on my recruiting
trip. He was very intimidating,"
she says.
The real Frank Brennan is a
polar opposite. "I can talk to him
about anything. He has a great
sense of humor. He knows what
to say. He can tell if you are
having problems outside of ten
nis," Green explains.
As for the academics, she has
done just fine. And, while the par
ents are just 40 minutes away,
she says,"I never go home."
As she struggled in the middle
of the season, Green disappeared
from the top tier of the collegiate
rankings and hardly seemed to be
a threat at NCAAs. A couple of
weeks before the tournament, she
was asked if a fourth straight
semifinal appearance might be in
the offing.
Green wouldn't make any pre
dictions but did say: "I can be
playing well enough. It's just a
matter of putting it all together.
I never think beforehand, 'Oh, I
have to get to the semis.' "
Oh, how close she came. Green
marched to the quarterfinals
before bowing out to Florida's
Nicole Arendt in a heartbreaking
three-setter.

Lisa Green, the captain of the women'a tennla team In 1990, led Stanford to national titles In each
of her years here. She plans on giving professional tennis a ahot after graduation.
Behind every sports dynasty
there are special athletes
who make the winning pos
sible. As a rule, these athletes are
blessed with innate ability, put in
extra hours to improve them
selves and are tenacious compet
itors.
Look at Magic Johnson. Or Joe
Montana. Or Wayne Gretzky.
There is no question each has
God-given talent, a tremendous
work ethic and a burning desire
to win. The ultimate measure of
their success is in the champion
ships they bring home.
As the Stanford women's tennis
team has pieced together it's 65-
match consecutive victory streak
and captured five straight na
tional crowns, the closest thing
to a constant among the personnel
has been senior Lisa Green.
But while a Magic or a Gretzky
grabs all the headlines, Green has
rarely been the focal point of her
team. When she was a freshman,
Patty Fendick played No. 1 singles
and won the NCAA individual
championships. The next two
years, Tami Whitlinger took the
top spot in the lineup before
heading for the professional tour.
This season, defending NCAA
singles champion Sandra Birch
garnered all the attention until
Debbie Graham went on to take
the national title herself.
All the while, Green has been
winning nearly all of her matches
regardless of where she has played
in the lineup. She has compiled
a 93-17 career record in team play.
For good measure, Green reached
the semifinals of the NCAA
singles tournament her first three
years.
Her career has been character
ized by brilliant play under pres
sure, most notably at the 1988
national championships when the
Cardinal was an overwhelming
underdog to top-seeded Florida.
An injury to Whitlinger moved
Green into the No. 1 spot, where
she was thought to be over
matched.
Instead, she beat Florida's Halle
Cioffi, the nation's top-ranked
player, in the finals of the team
competition to lead Stanford to
victory.
