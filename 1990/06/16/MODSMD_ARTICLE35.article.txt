# Bruton learns a lesson not measured in numbers
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
College is supposed to be a learning
experience, and that is exactly
what it's been for fifth-year senior
Derek Bruton.
When he came to Stanford, he was
very optimistic about his basketball fu
ture. He had finished his senior season
averaging 22 points and 14 rebounds a
game. He twice had 40 points and 25
rebounds in one game and felt that
after a brief adjustment period he would
be a top college player.
He didn't become a star, however, but
he's done something more lasting. He's
been instrumental in building the Stan
ford program, and this year his experi
ence and ability to lead by example pro
pelled an overachieving Cardinal to its
third consecutive postseason berth.
"I guess I had higher hopes about
playing a lot more and making a bigger
contribution to the team," he said. "As
I began to see the level of competition
and the adjustment I'd have to make,
the goals changed a bit, and it went
more from individual to team goals.
Winning became more important, which
is how it should be."
Bruton'a freshman year wasn't very
rewarding in either individual or team
goals. He redshirted that season under
then-Coach Tom Davis and the Cardinal
went 14-16.
"Freshman year, redshirt year, was
really frustrating," he said. "Redshirt
ing was really frustrating. Working that
hard and having no reward for it, not
playing in games. ... I was kind of frus
trated with the Davis system. He's a
really good coach and a good guy, but
it really wasn't my type of system."
Davis' idea of basketball was pressing
full court for 40 minutes and scoring
in the 90s every night. For a 6-foot-10,
235-pound center, that was clearly not
the system of choice.
But after Bruton's freshman year,
Davis left to coach at lowa, and Mike
Montgomery came to the Farm. Mont
gomery stresses a deliberate offense and
working the ball into post players.
"The system fits my type of game
better," Bruton said. "It's more like the
one we had in high school."
Bruton got a little playing time his
sophomore and junior years but was

hopes about playing a
lot more.'

behind Eric Reveno and Howard Wright
at center. His junior year, however,
Stanford went 21-12 and played in the
National Invitation Tournament.
"Last season, I knew what my role
was before the season started," Bruton
said. "Basically it was the year the whole
team thing set in my mind.
"I just set my goals on being able to
contribute when I could, knowing I'd
have limited minutes," he said. "I tried
to make other players better in practice.
It was a great year."
But while he enjoyed having the team
post win after win, he wished he was
playing more minutes.
"I don't think anyone can say they're
not bummed when they don't play," he
said. "You feel part of the losses, because
you think maybe you could have done
something about it. But you don't feel
part of the wins as much.
"That's where the team thing moves
in," Bruton said. "You have to think,
'Maybe I didn't contribute this time to
the win, but maybe next time I will.' "
With Reveno and Wright graduating
after last season, Bruton knew he would
have a bigger role to fill this year. Also,
as the only senior on a team with 10
guys who didn't play collegiate basket
bail last year, he knew he would have
to serve as a leader.
"I feel there's some amount of respect
they have for me as a senior," he said.
"I know what's wrong with their game
even if I couldn't do it myself, and they'll
listen to me. I can take pride in that.
"We have a lot of guys who can be
g00d.... When (teammate) Kenny Am
mann's All-Pac-10, I can say I helped.
I'm not the only one who had an in
fluence on him, but what I say helps."
Bruton earned a starting role thi«
season and jumped center the Cardinal's
first 13 games. While his field goal per
centage was very good, Montgomery felt
Bruton wasn't scoring enough or pulling
down enough rebounds. So the coach
inserted Deshon Wingate into the start

ing lineup for Bruton. It was a change
that was not undone the rest of the way.
"It was tough when I lost the starting
position for exactly one day," Bruton
said. "You can tell yourself that's the
end of it, I've given my all, or you can
come out and work your butt ofT, which
is what I did. I thought coming off the
bench I could give the team a lift and
put up some number that way. . . .
Whatever makes the team better, that's
what it boils down to."
Bruton was successful in achieving
his goals. He averaged 3.9 points per
game, but more impressively he shot
55.4 percent from the floor. The Cardi
nal went 18-12, including a game in the
NIT, and exceeded almost everyone's
expectations.
"Once you know how to win, you can
keep going," he said. "We may lack tal
ent or experience, but the feeling for
knowing how to win can make up for
some things."
He also feels that the success is not
fleeting, that the program is poised on
the brink of becoming a national power.
"I thought there were two divisions in
college basketball," he said. "There was
the top one, with the teams you see all
the time, and there was the second one
with Stanford in it. I could never see
us breaking that barrier and being seen
with that top group, being with North
Carolina, Duke, Oklahoma.
"People might consider Stanford and
Duke to have about the same academics,
but Duke had a better basketball pro
gram when I came here. Now, with the
success we've had, recruits are going to
come our way a little more."
And even though things didn't work
out the way he thought they might,
Bruton is glad he chose Stanford. "It's
been a really good experience. It's been
a heck of a learning experience. Some
times it hasn't been satisfying, but other
times it has — everything I've learned,
not just about basketball: confidence,
leadership, responsibility, what it takes
to be successful. That's boiled over to
life.
"It's been a good experience. Who
knows — it probably would have been
a better experience if I was a 22-point
scorer, the Pac-10's leading rebounder.
But whatever. That's not there You
can't use 'ifi.' It's been a great experi
ence at face value."

Derek Brut on had visions of being a collegiate star upon arrival here. While those
visions didn't come true, Bruton contributed to the amazing growth of the men's
