# Coming out a little bit every day
## 
### 
I CAME TO Stanford as a
transfer student during my
junior year. I didn't know
anyone at all. I didn't have the
friends from freshman year that
all the people on my floor did. My
roommate, also a transfer, didn't
have those friends either, but he
was straight. I'm not straight; I'm
.
My roommate fit in a lot
quicker than I did. I was pretty
"out," meaning that I had ac
cepted my being gay. I had even
become somewhat comfortable
with the idea. But I knew that
not everyone accepted homosexu
ality, and I did not know the
people around me very well at all.
Needless to say, I was very un
comfortable around all these
strangers.
Being a gay person in a pre
dominantly straight society has
its disadvantages. Most minority
members are noticeable, and at
Stanford there is a significant ef
fort. to celebrate diversity But
that celebration often doesn't ex
tend to invisible minorities, espe
cially gay people.

Gay people, like any other mi
nority, like to hang out with other
people who are like them.
Gradually I came to realize that
other people in my house were
gay, but it took a while — not
everyone was as comfortable with
their homosexuality as I was. I

had to seek other ways of making
friends.
The easiest way for a person to
get to know people in a new place
is to start being active in the com
munity. What's a gay person to
do? The Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center was just
forming then, but GLAS, the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford,
was hosting a lot of events at the
Old Fire Truck House.
I would make excuses to leave
my dorm each week to go to events
there, for I did not want any of
my dorm-mates to know that I
am gay. I was "out" then, but
there are varying degrees to being
out. Many have said that one
comes out a little bit every day,
and I would pretty much agree
with that assertion.
Stanford is one of the most
benign places to be gay, but it is
still an oppressive place. When I
learned about the Gay and Les
bian Speakers Bureau, whose
members lead dorm discussions
about gay and lesbian life at Stan


Scott Weiss
ford, I asked my resident assis
tants to put in a request for our
dorm.
My RAs said that people in our
dorm had seen their share of the
gay speakers bureau and were not
interested in seeing another pre
sentation. Maybe they should
have been, for during the first
few weeks of school all of the Na
tional Coming Out Day stickers,
posted in support of the gay cause,
were torn down. Later in the year
fliers for a program about homo
sexuality were also defaced.
It is very hard to be out at all
in our world, even at the softly
padded Stanford campus.
Recently I began wearing a pink
triangle button on my backpack.
Originally, the pink triangle was
used to label gay men in Nazi
concentration camps. Now it is
worn by people who support the
gay cause. The pink triangle is a
powerful political symbol that ex
presses the gay community's un
willingness to be oppressed.
Even though many non-gay
people wear the triangles to show
their support, those who wear
them are often assumed to be gay.
During the Gay And Lesbian
Awareness Week this spring it
suddenly became chic to wear the
buttons, and hundreds of them
were sold to eager Stanford stu
dents.
Unfortunately, the support of
many of those students wavered
as soon as GALA week was over.
Now I feel like I am the only one
wearing a button, and instead of
it not being noticed, I feel like
eyes are upon it all the time. I
get a lot more clearance in crowds
these days. Less people say hello
to me in my dorm. Men apologize
when they accidentally brush
against me in class. Sometimes
they even move away if I acciden
tally brush against them.
IF THAT'S all it takes to make
others realize that gay people
exist at Stanford, I'm cer
tainly willing to endure it. I would
rather have self-respect and pride
than feel ashamed to be gay. I
realize that it isn't the most
popular thing to do, but I get
satisfaction from doing something
that I feel is beneficial to my com
munity, the gay community.
My parents know that I'm gay.
I told them this summer, the time
that I finally was ready to tell
them. I had been out for three

years, dating, befriending and
living with gay people. My parents
suspected my homosexuality, I'm
sure, but they still asked if I was
dating any new women.
Coming out to parents is a
tricky thing. Often parents are the
last people to be told, and they
are typically the hardest to tell.
People can always find new
friends, new roommates, even new
jobs. But they can't find new par
ents — they only get one set of
those.
I finally told my parents, and
I'm sure they weren't thrilled
about it, but they reacted
amazingly well. We talk about it
a great deal now, and my love for
them has only grown because of
the encouragement they've given
me since I told them.
Graduation will be an exciting
time for all of us, but for the gay
student population at Stanford,
there will be a lot of tension. I
wonder how my parents will feel
if they know about the sexuality
of most of my friends. Will I be
spoiling their joy by including my
gay friends on family outings?
What about my boyfriend —
will they be able to deal with him?
It's not as simple as when a man
brings his girlfriend to dinner. Or
even to graduation dinner. My
boyfriend doesn't just have to be
intelligent, friendly, considerate,
and attractive; he has to help my
parents overcome their reticence
to accept him as my gay lover.
My parents are not the only
ones with a lot of adjusting to do.
Some of my friends are not out
to their entire families, and I have
been asked to "be on my best
behavior" while around their rela
tives.
There's a fine line between
being considerate and being rude
here, but not in the usual way: I
can be considerate and not "act
gay" (How does one act gay?), but
isn't it rude of my friends to ask
me such a thing? I don't do or
say anything that I feel is un
natural or unlike me. My friends
like me for that. Can I like myself
for curtailing what I say and do?
That remains to be seen.
Ultimately, graduation will be
a wonderful experience for the en
tire Class of '90, gay and straight.
Years of hard work will culminate
in a weekend-long celebration
with family and close friends. By
being open to difference, people
can be educated during Com
mencement, just as I was educated
during my time at Stanford.

padded Stanford campus.
Recently I began wearing a pink
triangle button on my backpack.
Originally, the pink triangle was
used to label gay men in Nazi
concentration camps. Now it is
worn by people who support the
gay cause. The pink triangle is a
powerful political symbol that ex
presses the gay community's un
willingness to be oppressed.
Even though many non-gay
people wear the triangles to show
their support, those who wear
them are often assumed to be gay.
During the Gay And Lesbian
Awareness Week this spring it
suddenly became chic to wear the
buttons, and hundreds of them
were sold to eager Stanford stu
dents.
Unfortunately, the support of
many of those students wavered
as soon as GALA week was over.
Now I feel like I am the only one
wearing a button, and instead of
it not being noticed, I feel like
eyes are upon it all the time. I
get a lot more clearance in crowds
these days. Less people say hello
to me in my dorm. Men apologize
when they accidentally brush
against me in class. Sometimes
they even move away if I acciden
tally brush against them.
IF THAT'S all it takes to make
others realize that gay people
exist at Stanford, I'm cer
tainly willing to endure it. I would
rather have self-respect and pride
than feel ashamed to be gay. I
realize that it isn't the most
popular thing to do, but I get
satisfaction from doing something
that I feel is beneficial to my com
munity, the gay community.
My parents know that I'm gay.
I told them this summer, the time
that I finally was ready to tell
them. I had been out for three

years, dating, befriending and
living with gay people. My parents
suspected my homosexuality, I'm
sure, but they still asked if I was
dating any new women.
Coming out to parents is a
tricky thing. Often parents are the
last people to be told, and they
are typically the hardest to tell.
People can always find new
friends, new roommates, even new
jobs. But they can't find new par
ents — they only get one set of
those.
I finally told my parents, and
I'm sure they weren't thrilled
about it, but they reacted
amazingly well. We talk about it
a great deal now, and my love for
them has only grown because of
the encouragement they've given
me since I told them.
Graduation will be an exciting
time for all of us, but for the gay
student population at Stanford,
there will be a lot of tension. I
wonder how my parents will feel
if they know about the sexuality
of most of my friends. Will I be
spoiling their joy by including my
gay friends on family outings?
What about my boyfriend —
will they be able to deal with him?
It's not as simple as when a man
brings his girlfriend to dinner. Or
even to graduation dinner. My
boyfriend doesn't just have to be
intelligent, friendly, considerate,
and attractive; he has to help my
parents overcome their reticence
to accept him as my gay lover.
My parents are not the only
ones with a lot of adjusting to do.
Some of my friends are not out
to their entire families, and I have
been asked to "be on my best
behavior" while around their rela
tives.
There's a fine line between
being considerate and being rude
here, but not in the usual way: I
can be considerate and not "act
gay" (How does one act gay?), but
isn't it rude of my friends to ask
me such a thing? I don't do or
say anything that I feel is un
natural or unlike me. My friends
like me for that. Can I like myself
for curtailing what I say and do?
That remains to be seen.
Ultimately, graduation will be
a wonderful experience for the en
tire Class of '90, gay and straight.
Years of hard work will culminate
in a weekend-long celebration
with family and close friends. By
being open to difference, people
can be educated during Com
mencement, just as I was educated
during my time at Stanford.

I CAME TO Stanford as a
transfer student during my
junior year. I didn't know
anyone at all. I didn't have the
friends from freshman year that
all the people on my floor did. My
roommate, also a transfer, didn't
have those friends either, but he
was straight. I'm not straight; I'm
.
My roommate fit in a lot
quicker than I did. I was pretty
"out," meaning that I had ac
cepted my being gay. I had even
become somewhat comfortable
with the idea. But I knew that
not everyone accepted homosexu
ality, and I did not know the
people around me very well at all.
Needless to say, I was very un
comfortable around all these
strangers.
Being a gay person in a pre
dominantly straight society has
its disadvantages. Most minority
members are noticeable, and at
Stanford there is a significant ef
fort. to celebrate diversity But
that celebration often doesn't ex
tend to invisible minorities, espe
cially gay people.

Gay people, like any other mi
nority, like to hang out with other
people who are like them.
Gradually I came to realize that
other people in my house were
gay, but it took a while — not
everyone was as comfortable with
their homosexuality as I was. I

had to seek other ways of making
friends.
The easiest way for a person to
get to know people in a new place
is to start being active in the com
munity. What's a gay person to
do? The Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center was just
forming then, but GLAS, the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford,
was hosting a lot of events at the
Old Fire Truck House.
I would make excuses to leave
my dorm each week to go to events
there, for I did not want any of
my dorm-mates to know that I
am gay. I was "out" then, but
there are varying degrees to being
out. Many have said that one
comes out a little bit every day,
and I would pretty much agree
with that assertion.
Stanford is one of the most
benign places to be gay, but it is
still an oppressive place. When I
learned about the Gay and Les
bian Speakers Bureau, whose
members lead dorm discussions
about gay and lesbian life at Stan


Scott Weiss
ford, I asked my resident assis
tants to put in a request for our
dorm.
My RAs said that people in our
dorm had seen their share of the
gay speakers bureau and were not
interested in seeing another pre
sentation. Maybe they should
have been, for during the first
few weeks of school all of the Na
tional Coming Out Day stickers,
posted in support of the gay cause,
were torn down. Later in the year
fliers for a program about homo
sexuality were also defaced.
