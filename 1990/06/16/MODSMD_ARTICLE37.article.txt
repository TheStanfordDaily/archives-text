# Coming out a little bit every day
## 
### 
I CAME TO Stanford as a
transfer student during my
junior year. I didn't know
anyone at all. I didn't have the
friends from freshman year that
all the people on my floor did. My
roommate, also a transfer, didn't
have those friends either, but he
was straight. I'm not straight; I'm
.
My roommate fit in a lot
quicker than I did. I was pretty
"out," meaning that I had ac
cepted my being gay. I had even
become somewhat comfortable
with the idea. But I knew that
not everyone accepted homosexu
ality, and I did not know the
people around me very well at all.
Needless to say, I was very un
comfortable around all these
strangers.
Being a gay person in a pre
dominantly straight society has
its disadvantages. Most minority
members are noticeable, and at
Stanford there is a significant ef
fort. to celebrate diversity But
that celebration often doesn't ex
tend to invisible minorities, espe
cially gay people.

Gay people, like any other mi
nority, like to hang out with other
people who are like them.
Gradually I came to realize that
other people in my house were
gay, but it took a while â€” not
everyone was as comfortable with
their homosexuality as I was. I

had to seek other ways of making
friends.
The easiest way for a person to
get to know people in a new place
is to start being active in the com
munity. What's a gay person to
do? The Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center was just
forming then, but GLAS, the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford,
was hosting a lot of events at the
Old Fire Truck House.
I would make excuses to leave
my dorm each week to go to events
there, for I did not want any of
my dorm-mates to know that I
am gay. I was "out" then, but
there are varying degrees to being
out. Many have said that one
comes out a little bit every day,
and I would pretty much agree
with that assertion.
Stanford is one of the most
benign places to be gay, but it is
still an oppressive place. When I
learned about the Gay and Les
bian Speakers Bureau, whose
members lead dorm discussions
about gay and lesbian life at Stan
