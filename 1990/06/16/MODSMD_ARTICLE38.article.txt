# Riding the tide of revolutionary change
## 
### 
IT'S AN OLD song and dance.
It's been said a thousand times
before in a thousand different
ways: The biggest changes in the
world begin with a single thought.
Love your enemies. Now, there's
a thought.
America is the New World. An
other one.
Humans look an awful lot like
apes, maybe ... There's another
one.
What if we tried to split that
atom? Well, I think you get my
point.
A big thought that is shaping
the world today is glasnost. Four
years ago, when I came to Stan
ford as a frosh, Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev and
then-President Ronald Reagan
were gearing up for a meeting in
Iceland, the second meeting be
tween the two leaders. At the
Reykjavik "mini-summit,"
superpower arms reduction plans
were stalled by Reagan's insis
tence on developing a "Star Wars"
anti-ballistic missile system.
Just two weeks ago Gorbachev
ended his second tour of the
United States with a stop at Stan
ford during which he declared
that "the Cold War is over."
The world really has changed
in four years. Eastern European
nations have gained their inde
pendence, the Berlin Wall is down,
Germany is reunifying, students
are struggling for democracy in
China, Nelson Mandela is free and
weekly newsmagazines are using
graphics that show the hammer
and sickle of the Russian flag

breaking apart to go with stories
about Boris Yeltsin and the Baltic
States.
It is enough to make your head
spin. No one knows what
longterm effects these changes
will have on the world, but one
message rises clearly from the
ashes of the old order: We are
living in an international commu
nity now.
It is a community that we must
shape. The events of the past year
have proven that the impossible
may just be possible. They have
given us hope that we can really
make a difference. They have
given us hope that maybe some
of our thoughts will be the big
thoughts of the future. Now is a
time for idealism.
WE NEED EVERYONE,
women and men, people
from all countries and all
backgrounds, to shape the new
international community.
In this new community, differ
ences in religion, economic sys
tems and political structures must
be viewed as experiments, not
reasons for war. Our overriding
value must be the common good
and that "common" must take
everyone into account. Competing
value systems must give way to
the common good of the interna
tional community.
We must focuB on our
similarities as humans on this
planet and appreciate, not
begrudge, our differences.
We were all born from some
where. We all need to eat, to sleep

and to be loved. We all need shel
ter. We are all vulnerable and in
secure, living on this planet for
now, but knowing that we will
die. We are a people surrounded
by mystery and wonder.
Our common insecurity does
not have to be a reason for us to
lash out at others. It can be a
strong force that binds us to
gether. Together, we can face the
problems of today and tomorrow,
because even problems that may
not seem to affect us, affect US.
In the past year, we've seen that
a million people in Czechoslovakia
can take to the streets and change
their lives forever. If the people
of the world want something,
nothing can stand in our way.
All the weapons could be

destroyed tomorrow. What else
could the leaders of the world do
if the people of the world all took
to the streets and marched for
peace? What are we waiting for?
The standard of living could be
raised in all poorer countries of
the world. What could leaders in
less fortunate nations do if food
and clothes kept streaming in
from Japan, the United States,
West Germany, the Soviet Union
and Europe and if the people in
their countries kept demanding
that their needs be met?
Wouldn't the killing stop if
people stepped back, examined
what they were fighting for,
looked into the eyes of the men
and women they were fighting
and realized they were looking
into their own eyes?
Then, we could all tell our
stories and offer our visions of
the world. We have a lot to learn
from one another and we can
learn a lot from one another with
out sacrificing who we are.
It could all happen like the
rising tide of an East European
revolution and riding it would be
amazing. No one would be able
to believe it. It would grip the
world as the changes over the past
year have. I feel it happening al
ready. It may just be the heady
daze of graduation, but I feel that
we are all coming together.

Frank Quaratiello, a senior
majoring in English and
idealism, is looking forward to a
life after graduation where each
day is better than the one before it.

ences in religion, economic sys
tems and political structures must
be viewed as experiments, not
reasons for war. Our overriding
value must be the common good
and that "common" must take
everyone into account. Competing
value systems must give way to
the common good of the interna
tional community.
We must focuB on our
similarities as humans on this
planet and appreciate, not
begrudge, our differences.
We were all born from some
where. We all need to eat, to sleep

and to be loved. We all need shel
ter. We are all vulnerable and in
secure, living on this planet for
now, but knowing that we will
die. We are a people surrounded
by mystery and wonder.
Our common insecurity does
not have to be a reason for us to
lash out at others. It can be a
strong force that binds us to
gether. Together, we can face the
problems of today and tomorrow,
because even problems that may
not seem to affect us, affect US.
In the past year, we've seen that
a million people in Czechoslovakia
can take to the streets and change
their lives forever. If the people
of the world want something,
nothing can stand in our way.
All the weapons could be

destroyed tomorrow. What else
could the leaders of the world do
if the people of the world all took
to the streets and marched for
peace? What are we waiting for?
The standard of living could be
raised in all poorer countries of
the world. What could leaders in
less fortunate nations do if food
and clothes kept streaming in
from Japan, the United States,
West Germany, the Soviet Union
and Europe and if the people in
their countries kept demanding
that their needs be met?
Wouldn't the killing stop if
people stepped back, examined
what they were fighting for,
looked into the eyes of the men
and women they were fighting
and realized they were looking
into their own eyes?
Then, we could all tell our
stories and offer our visions of
the world. We have a lot to learn
from one another and we can
learn a lot from one another with
out sacrificing who we are.
It could all happen like the
rising tide of an East European
revolution and riding it would be
amazing. No one would be able
to believe it. It would grip the
world as the changes over the past
year have. I feel it happening al
ready. It may just be the heady
daze of graduation, but I feel that
we are all coming together.

Frank Quaratiello, a senior
majoring in English and
idealism, is looking forward to a
life after graduation where each
day is better than the one before it.
