# Flashback — It all started four years ago with Orientation
## 
### Brent Bigler 
It all started on Thursday, Sept. 25, 1986
at 8 a.m.
You see, on that date and at that time
"Frosh Orientation 1986" officially began: the
Class of 1990, 1,575 freshmen representing
49 states and 12 foreign countries, converged
upon the Farm.
For those of us motivated enough to get
here at 8 a.m., our six-day, whirlwind intro
duction to the campus began with a bang.
First things came first (as they always do)
— we had to find where we lived. And, funny
thing, when we showed up at our dorms, here
were all of these strangers greeting us by
name. At that moment maybe we all felt like
Richard Reader, who found himself "really
taken aback."
Reader remembers thinking to himself,
"Who are these people to know my name?"
(These people turned out to be our resident
assistants.) "What magic did they have at
their disposal?" Reader wanted to know.
"[But] it was kind of cool," Reader said. "It
was a good feeling to know that you weren't
just a number," he added.
Soon our RAs gave us keys, and then for
the first time we entered a room that would
be decorated by us alone, that we would return
to at sometimes bizarre hours in the morning,
and that would occasionally be the scene of,
well ... maybe we should leave that to our
memories!
After checking into our rooms, we spent
the next five days being jostled to and from
house meetings, speeches, parties, placement
tests, debates, a talent show and meals.
On our first night at the Farm, we heard
University President Donald Kennedy tell us
that Stanford is "very heterogeneous." Ken
nedy encouraged us to take full advantage of
its diversity.
Kennedy also told us to make the most of

the intellectual opportunities available to us.
"You don't have to have a degree to play,"
he said.
But for most of Orientation, play is all we
would do.
Friday night we partied in our residences.
Saturday night we went to the Quadrangle
to ei\joy "Fiesta on the Farm 1986." We salsa
ed with the Ballet Folklorico de Stanford, and
after we wore out the mariachis, we spent
the rest of the evening dancing to the newer
sounds of rock.
Sunday we participated in "Fun in the Sun"
and did a little of everything — swimming,
gaming, dunking, picnicking and dancing.
Monday night we saw the talent show, which
featured the best the Class of 1990 had to
offer. Sarah Dohi recalls a few "real good
performers. ... I remember this one guy who
was a real good guitar player," she said.
Sarah also remembers that her "dorm
(Trancos) got kicked off the stage because
someone opened a can of beer."
When we weren't playing, we only pretended
at working.
On Friday we tried our hand at our first
test at Stanford. Although the test didn't
really count, the quality of our high school
skills in a foreign language became apparent
when we sat down in front of a University
placement exam.
Friday also saw others of us stretching our
intellectual mettle while discussing the "as
signed" summer reading. Jim Knox remem
bers that his dorm's discussion was "pretty
good," although he hadn't finished the
reading.
Knox's dorm was assigned to read "Great
Expectations" by Charles Dickens. Knox re
members feeling a little intimidated. "I didn't
speak up when there were potential English
majors just going off about the reading," he
said.
Other days brought other things intellectu

al. On Saturday the math placement test
showed us where we fit in mathematically.
On Sunday our advisers showed us what we
could fit in academically.
Speeches and discussions introduced us to
the intellectual side of the University as well.
On Tuesday night several panelists urged
us to think critically about Western Culture,
and to ask ourselves "what's missing" from
such courses. Barry Katz, one of the panelists
who would later encourage future changes in
Western Culture, told us to consider whether
the different tracks "ignore non-whites" as
well as "the little people who experience the
hard edge of history."
On Friday, several debates challenged us to
consider whether "We should have manned
space flights," whether "Third World Poverty
is America's Fault," and whether "Christianity
has been a Good Thing for Western Culture."
But whether or not the debates were a good
thing for the students, it is hard to say. Frank
Quaratiello says he doesn't remember that
they even happened, "and I'm kinda glad I
don't remember."
But one thing Quaratiello hasn't forgotten
is the first time we saw the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band. They were
tooting their horns and banging their drums
between the Claw fountain and the Bookstore.
The Class of '90 was thus introduced two
great traditions of campus life — the Band
and the Bookstore.
Maybe the memory of the Band gave us
the courage and the spirit to go into the
Bookstore the next day and watch it swallow
up our hard-earned summer cash ... In any
case, perhaps the blaring memories of out-of
tune saxophones and trumpets drowned out
the ringing of the cash register.
Words, too, were a main focus of Orienta
tion. But they weren't the SAT variety. Rather

Orientation '86 was packed with parties like the one above.
"Co Po," "Fro Yd," "Co Ho," "Pro
Fro," "Flo Mo," "Hoo Tow,"
"Mem Chu" and "Mem Aud" oc
cupied our minds as we tried to
figure out what they meant.
(Kathy Mottley says she remem
bers one fellow who decided to
name himself "Mem Chuck" be
cause he thought himself to be a
Stanford tradition!)
Words and language played a
bigger role for international stu
dents. Not only did they have to
earn the intricacies of Stanford
lingo, they also found themselves
trying to figure out whether
"How's it going?" is a greeting or
a question.
Fortunately, international stu

dents were able to attend different
activities designed to help ac
quaint them with the exotic world
of Stanford.
Ethnic students, too, had
orientations within Orientation.
People of all colors saw a multi
tude of activities designed to show
them the diverse resources and
services available to them.
When those six exciting days
were over — when we went to
our first classes, when we finally
learned the names of our RAs (!),
when we got lost for the last time
between our dorms and Meyer Li
brary — only then did we realize
that all that fun was just a way
of preparing us to be students.
But Orientation didn't prepare
us to be just any students — it
prepared us to be Stanford stu
dents. And that's something to

space flights," whether "Third World Poverty
is America's Fault," and whether "Christianity
has been a Good Thing for Western Culture."
But whether or not the debates were a good
thing for the students, it is hard to say. Frank
Quaratiello says he doesn't remember that
they even happened, "and I'm kinda glad I
don't remember."
But one thing Quaratiello hasn't forgotten
is the first time we saw the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band. They were
tooting their horns and banging their drums
between the Claw fountain and the Bookstore.
The Class of '90 was thus introduced two
great traditions of campus life — the Band
and the Bookstore.
Maybe the memory of the Band gave us
the courage and the spirit to go into the
Bookstore the next day and watch it swallow
up our hard-earned summer cash ... In any
case, perhaps the blaring memories of out-of
tune saxophones and trumpets drowned out
the ringing of the cash register.
Words, too, were a main focus of Orienta
tion. But they weren't the SAT variety. Rather

Orientation '86 was packed with parties like the one above.
"Co Po," "Fro Yd," "Co Ho," "Pro
Fro," "Flo Mo," "Hoo Tow,"
"Mem Chu" and "Mem Aud" oc
cupied our minds as we tried to
figure out what they meant.
(Kathy Mottley says she remem
bers one fellow who decided to
name himself "Mem Chuck" be
cause he thought himself to be a
Stanford tradition!)
Words and language played a
bigger role for international stu
dents. Not only did they have to
earn the intricacies of Stanford
lingo, they also found themselves
trying to figure out whether
"How's it going?" is a greeting or
a question.
Fortunately, international stu

dents were able to attend different
activities designed to help ac
quaint them with the exotic world
of Stanford.
Ethnic students, too, had
orientations within Orientation.
People of all colors saw a multi
tude of activities designed to show
them the diverse resources and
services available to them.
When those six exciting days
were over — when we went to
our first classes, when we finally
learned the names of our RAs (!),
when we got lost for the last time
between our dorms and Meyer Li
brary — only then did we realize
that all that fun was just a way
of preparing us to be students.
But Orientation didn't prepare
us to be just any students — it
prepared us to be Stanford stu
dents. And that's something to
say.
It all started on Thursday, Sept. 25, 1986
at 8 a.m.
You see, on that date and at that time
"Frosh Orientation 1986" officially began: the
Class of 1990, 1,575 freshmen representing
49 states and 12 foreign countries, converged
upon the Farm.
For those of us motivated enough to get
here at 8 a.m., our six-day, whirlwind intro
duction to the campus began with a bang.
First things came first (as they always do)
— we had to find where we lived. And, funny
thing, when we showed up at our dorms, here
were all of these strangers greeting us by
name. At that moment maybe we all felt like
Richard Reader, who found himself "really
taken aback."
Reader remembers thinking to himself,
"Who are these people to know my name?"
(These people turned out to be our resident
assistants.) "What magic did they have at
their disposal?" Reader wanted to know.
"[But] it was kind of cool," Reader said. "It
was a good feeling to know that you weren't
just a number," he added.
Soon our RAs gave us keys, and then for
the first time we entered a room that would
be decorated by us alone, that we would return
to at sometimes bizarre hours in the morning,
and that would occasionally be the scene of,
well ... maybe we should leave that to our
memories!
After checking into our rooms, we spent
the next five days being jostled to and from
house meetings, speeches, parties, placement
tests, debates, a talent show and meals.
On our first night at the Farm, we heard
University President Donald Kennedy tell us
that Stanford is "very heterogeneous." Ken
nedy encouraged us to take full advantage of
its diversity.
Kennedy also told us to make the most of

the intellectual opportunities available to us.
"You don't have to have a degree to play,"
he said.
But for most of Orientation, play is all we
would do.
Friday night we partied in our residences.
Saturday night we went to the Quadrangle
to ei\joy "Fiesta on the Farm 1986." We salsa
ed with the Ballet Folklorico de Stanford, and
after we wore out the mariachis, we spent
the rest of the evening dancing to the newer
sounds of rock.
Sunday we participated in "Fun in the Sun"
and did a little of everything — swimming,
gaming, dunking, picnicking and dancing.
Monday night we saw the talent show, which
featured the best the Class of 1990 had to
offer. Sarah Dohi recalls a few "real good
performers. ... I remember this one guy who
was a real good guitar player," she said.
Sarah also remembers that her "dorm
(Trancos) got kicked off the stage because
someone opened a can of beer."
When we weren't playing, we only pretended
at working.
On Friday we tried our hand at our first
test at Stanford. Although the test didn't
really count, the quality of our high school
skills in a foreign language became apparent
when we sat down in front of a University
placement exam.
Friday also saw others of us stretching our
intellectual mettle while discussing the "as
signed" summer reading. Jim Knox remem
bers that his dorm's discussion was "pretty
good," although he hadn't finished the
reading.
Knox's dorm was assigned to read "Great
Expectations" by Charles Dickens. Knox re
members feeling a little intimidated. "I didn't
speak up when there were potential English
majors just going off about the reading," he
said.
Other days brought other things intellectu

al. On Saturday the math placement test
showed us where we fit in mathematically.
On Sunday our advisers showed us what we
could fit in academically.
Speeches and discussions introduced us to
the intellectual side of the University as well.
On Tuesday night several panelists urged
us to think critically about Western Culture,
and to ask ourselves "what's missing" from
such courses. Barry Katz, one of the panelists
who would later encourage future changes in
Western Culture, told us to consider whether
the different tracks "ignore non-whites" as
well as "the little people who experience the
hard edge of history."
