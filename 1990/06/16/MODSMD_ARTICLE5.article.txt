# Edelman to offer vision of equality
## 
### Ruben Garcia 
With more than 25 years of
public service behind her, Marian
Wright Edelman's past work
reflects her vision for the future
— a time when all of America's
children have an equal opportu
nity for survival.
In her speech to graduates Sun
day, she will most likely encourage
them to consider the effect of
childhood poverty and poor edu
cation on the future of the
country. Edelman has written
several works on the subject, in
cluding her book "Families in
Peril: An Agenda for Social
Change," based on her 1986 Har
vard University lecture series. In
1985, she spoke at Stanford's "You
Can Make a Difference Confer
ence" on hunger.
Edelman has worked during the
last quarter-century to ameliorate
the suffering of undernourished,
poorly educated children through
the Children's Defense Fund, an
organization she has led since
1973. Before founding that organ
ization, she worked as an attorney
for the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
"Children cannot eat rhetoric,
and they cannot be sheltered by
commissions," she wrote in"I
Dream a World," a collection of
biographies about influential
black women in the United States.
"We lose about 10,000 children to
poverty each year. That's more
kids than we lost to the Vietnam
War, [but] where's the outrage?"
Edelman's list of publications
on children in poverty matches
her dedication to their cause. Be
sides "Families in Peril," she has
written books on education, in
cluding 1974's "Children Out of
School in America,"and on
poverty, most notably 1980's
"Portrait of Inequality: Black and
White Children in America." In
additon, Edelman has written ar
ticles in law and educational jour
nals.
Edelman holds a bachelor's
degree from Spelman College in
Atlanta; she received her law
degree from Yale University in
1963. As a black woman growing
up in South Carolina, Edelman
faced many obstacles to her edu
cation and to her many ac
complishments.
Edelman also served as Director
of Harvard's Center for Law and
Education from 1971 to 1973,
before becoming president of the
Children's Defense Fund.

She has also received numerous
awards and honorary degrees
from Swarthmore College, Colum
bia Teachers College and Syracuse
University. Edelman has received
several prestigious awards and
honors since 1959, from being
named Outstanding Young
Woman of America in 1965 to
being named to the President's
Commission for a National
Agenda for the '80s in 1979.
Edelman's travels around the
world reflect a commitment not
only to the domestic problems of
children but also to international
concerns. In the early '60s, she
participated in student exchanges
to Eastern Europe and Africa, and
she is currently on the U.S. Com
mittee for UNICEF. In 1979, she
served on the National Commis
sion established to observe the In
ternational Year of the Child.
Edelman's selection as this
year's commencement speaker
was met with opposition by some
students because of her relative
anonymity compared to past
speakers such as Garry Trudeau,
Tip O'Neill, and Mario Cuomo.
Several seniors believed that her
choice was simply another part of
Stanford's "multicultural
agenda."
Edelman is the fourth woman
selected as commencement
speaker and the first black wom
an.
