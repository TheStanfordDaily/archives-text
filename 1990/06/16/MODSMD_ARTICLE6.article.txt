"Just as it is true that the reso
lution of problems of race in our
society has just begun, so it is
true that the full participation of
women in our society has only
just begun."
— Robert Maynard, 1988

"I warn you against the false
values represented by all the glit
tering achievements so cele
brated by the media, precisely
because of who and what you
are. You are the best, the most
able and accomplished among
your peers, and the most likely
to succeed and become the envy
of your generation."
— Ted Koppel, 1986

"America is still very much a work
in progress, and one of the things
that has always distinguished it
from most other countries is that
we have never been afraid to
challenge our most cherished as
sumptions, to ask the impertinent
question. We have always been
willing to reinvent ourselves for
the common good."
— Garry Trudeau, 1989

"Investing In education is as cri
tical to the economic infrastruc
ture of this nation In the 21st
century as investing in railroads
was in the 19th century.'
- Tip O'Neill, 1987

The Governor of New York.
The Speaker of the House of
Representatives. The nation's
top television journalist. A
leading black newspaper pub
lisher. A cartoonist.
One of these things is not like
the others.
As last year's Commencement
speaker, Garry Trudeau —
creator of the editorial comic
strip "Doonesbury" — seems to
stand apart from the more
prosaic politicians and newsmen
who delivered past addresses.
Despite Trudeau's unique
career, however, he was as
weighty as Tip O'Neill when it
came to challenging graduates
to abandon apathy and embrace
a moral commitment to become

better citizens of a world com
munity. "If ours becomes a so
ciety intolerant of failure and
uncompassionate in the face of
suffering, then surely we are all
lost," he said.
Trudeau said he hoped the
Class of '90 would "prevail in
repudiating the callousness that
you see around you."
Just days after the Chinese
government massacred student
protesters in Bering's Tianan
men square, Trudeau observed
to the Class of '89, "How as
tonishing to see the democratic
freedoms we have cherished for
over 200 years thrown into high
relief by the incandescent
courage of those who had never
experienced them. How hum
bling to be reintroduced to the
power of our own ideals."

Robert Maynard en
couraged graduates
to open their eyes to
the wealth of diversity
surrounding them.

Several past commencement
speakers stressed the impor
tance of applying democratic
ideals to society democratically.
Ted Koppel urged graduates not
to be hypnotized by the world
which television glamorizes, but
to transcend the best by seeking
out the humble, by "finding
those whom television ignores."
Robert Maynard, a distin
guished journalist and the first

black person to publish a mayor
newspaper, encouraged gradu
ates to open their eyes to the
wealth of diversity surrounding
them. Overcoming racial bar
riers in the United States is just
the beginning, he said. Maynard
expressed hope that the gradu
ates would recognize and en
courage women's "rich potential
for making us a better society."
In 1987, Thomas P. "Tip"
O'Neill urged graduates to help
bring about that society. "We
cannot afford to have another
generation of Americans reject
public service," he said. "Our
government needs public inter
est, public support, and most of
all public trust."
