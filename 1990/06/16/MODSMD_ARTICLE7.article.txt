# Class of '90 will celebrate Commencement ceremonies sober
## 
### Geoff Goldman 
University President Donald
Kennedy says that hitting him
with a champagne cork at Com
mencement has always been a
"very difficult ballistic challenge."
But because of changes in Stan
ford's alcohol policy, this year's
graduating seniors will never get
the chance to try.
Under the new policy, alcohol
is no longer allowed in any ath
letic facilities, including Stanford
Stadium, even at non-athletic
events. As a result, alcohol will
not be allowed into the stadium
for Commencement.
In a letter sent to all graduating
seniors, Kennedy explained the
reasoning behind the decision.
Citing the fact that "a third or
more" of the parents, relatives
and friends at Commencement
ceremonies have probably "had
some sort of tragic personal or
family experience with alcohol
abuse," Kennedy urged graduat
ing seniors to refrian from
drunken behavior that would lend
"the taint of bitter remembrance
over what ought to be a time of
joy."
Kennedy also expressed concern
that excessively drunk graduates
would have no "recollection of
what ought to be one of life's
landmarks."
Historically, "no two years have
been quite the same" in terms of
alcohol at Commencement, ac
cording to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
In some years, there has been
a "a fairly substantial number of
students with champagne," he

said.
"I don't know that it haa been
a problem," Lyons added, "but
[once] when a person passed out
in the front row, it attracted at
tention."
Lyons described Commence
ment as a "family affair that is
fun and not staid." However,
"what becomes fun for some is
an embarrassment for others," he
said.
Lyons also noted that prevent
ing drunkenness at Commence
ment was not the primary reason
for changing the aJcohol policy. It
made sense to make this rule
while re-evaluating the campus'
alcohol policy as a whole, he said.
Some students, however, are of
fended by the new policy.
Dave Martinez, a senior gradu
ating in English, said it was "kind
of asinine that people need to have
their behavior regulated."
"What happened to personal re
sponsibility?" he asked.
Most people will probably not
be drinking anyway in front of
their families, Martinez noted.
"Everyone puts on his commence
ment face," he said. However, he
added, people should be able to
"pop a cork" at Commencement.
Will Stocker, a senior graduat
ing in computer science, agreed
with Martinez. "I think it's a con
tinuation of what I've seen in the
last few years, that Stanford is
becoming more conservative,"
Stocker said.
While he noted the new rule
does not affect him personally be
cause he does not want to get
drunk in front of his family and
friends, Stocker also said he

believes people should be allowed
to drink at Commencement.
"Hopefully, people will be re
sponsible," he added.
Stocker said he found Ken
nedy's letter "almost demeaning"
because it was "telling us why we
weren't responsible enough to be
able to drink."
In addition, Stocker said he is
unsure of how well the policy will
limit drunkeness at Commence
ment. "People who want a drink
will do it beforehand."
However, not all students be
lieve the new rule is a bad idea.
"I'm in favor of (the new rule),"
said Karin Kimbrough, a senior
graduating in English and French
Literatures and Economics. She
said the rule attempts "to avoid
people getting messy."
"There's no need to get so
drunk that (people) don't remem
ber [Commencement]," she added.
"It's not saying you can't drink
— it just makes sure things don't
get out of hand."
Kimbrough said she was sur
prised that Kennedy sent a letter
to all of the graduating seniors.
"It had more of an effect to get
a letter from him" than just to
read an announcement, she said.
In the debate surrounding al
cohol policy changes, the Senior
Class presidents did not take an
official stand on the decision.
Michael Roarke, one of the
presidents, said the four officers
were divided on the issue.
However, Roarke said he per
sonally agrees with the new rule.
"This is not the time to get
smashed, he added. "It seems the
wrong way to end."

Last call for alcohol
Due to a new policy which prohibits alcohol at athletic facilities, Including Stanford Stadium, scenes
such as this one will not exist at Commencement 1990.
