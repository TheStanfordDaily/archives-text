# For futon-bound fuzzies, 'useful' learning can occur outside class

WE FUZZIES are used to
The Question.
Someone asks you your
major and then politely coos,
"Sooo, what are you going to do
with that?"
Translation: "Sooo, you've
resigned yourself to sleeping on
a lumpy futon and washing your
clothes at a laundromat for the
rest of your life?"
This has been an issue for me,
and not just because I pas
sionately hate both futons and
laundromats. I have devoted
myself to two academic fields,
American studies and feminist
studies, for four years, but on my
pessimistic days I worry that I
haven't learned anything at all,
let alone anything useful. "Take
some computer science," my dad
would always urge me. "It'll be
useful someday."
On those days, I envy my friend
who studied not merely computer
science, but a very specific form
of computer science combined
with graphic design, which cur
rently is in such great demand
that he will probably own several

homes and an Acura Integra
before I own a couch. (He didn't
even choose his field solely for
financial reasons; he genuinely
enjoys it.)
Most days I'm much more san
guine, and I know that I have
gained an understanding of Amer
ican history and culture — par
ticularly the role of women and
other marginalized people in that
history and culture — that will
be useful in whatever I decide to
do.
I tend to believe in the saying
"Do what you love; the money
will follow."
And I know that if I couldn't
even get Karel the Recalcitrant
Robot to go over the little moun
tain in CS 106 A, then computer
science beyond the word
processing level is probably not
for me.
I also know that I entered every
class I have taken here with a
genuine desire to learn about the
subject, rather than a "preprofes
sional" interest. (The one excep
tion was statistics, which I took
to satisfy a distribution require

ment and ended up, to my great
surprise, really enjoying.) I used
to joke that I was mcyoring in
"Elizabethan studies": whatever
is of interest to Elizabeth.
So I know the correct answer
to The Question.
What am I going to do with
that? Whatever I want to.

THAT SAID, I HAVE hedged
my bets somewhat by learn
ing a trade: journalism.
Working on The Daily has taught
me much more in the way of tan
gible (and potentially marketable)
skills than any of my classes —
and that's fine with me.
I have never taken a course
from the Communication Depart
ment; I preferred to learn jour
nalism the fun way, by jumping
in and doing it. No grades, no
safety net, just a bunch of stu
dents (almost all undergraduates)
publishing a 25,000-circulation
paper five days a week and run
ning the $1.1-million corporation
that owns it. Pretty wild.
Working at The Daily can be a
tremendously exciting experience,
and on a day-to-day basis, it's
usually a lot more fun than study
ing. For that reason — and be
cause the top seven or so jobs
require upwards of 40 hours of
work per week — many staffers
neglect their classes, take incom
pletes, stop out or even develop
PSS — perpetual student
syndrome.

I have a relatively mild case —
I'll be graduating for real at the
end of next fall quarter, only a
little late. That's mainly because
I was news editor last fall and
couldn't take three required
classes that are only offered in
the fall — it was all I could do
to keep up with the one I did
take. But getting a blank
sheepskin this weekend is well
worth it.
As news editor, I was at The
Daily 40 to 50 hours per week, I
rarely could drag myself out of
bed before 11 a.m., my friends
saw me so seldom they thought
I had gone overseas, my love-life
deteriorated. But I loved every
minute of the work.
When the Oct. 17 earthquake
hit, I couldn't crawl out from un
der the news-office desk when the
shaking stopped and go have a
much-needed anxiety attack —
there was a paper to put out. But
I wouldn't have wanted to be
anywhere else.
I loved devoting myself single
mindedly to something. I loved
knowing everything of note going

I loved devoting
myself single
mindedly to some
thing.

on at Stanford, and I loved
knowing that I was making a dif
ference (hopefully for the better)
in how well it was being covered.
There were some things about
The Daily I could have done with
out. For the first time in my life,
I was unpleasantly aware of being
treated differently because I was
a woman. But I don't think this
and other problems at The Daily
are impossible to solve — I figure
they give me a chance to test in
an almost-real-world setting some
of the feminist ideas I've learned
in my classes.
And so, next fall, guess what?
I'll be working at The Daily again.
