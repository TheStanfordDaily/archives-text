# Life won't unravel the moment Commencement ends
## 
### 
No, I don't know what I'm
doing with my life. My
friends laugh because in
the same breath I speak of teach
ing in New Orleans one moment
and exploring Mexico City the
next. And I took a bartending
course this spring, just in case I
couldn't find a job.
It sounds pathetic that my par
ents spent $80,000 so their
daughter could bartend. But a
career is not the sole objective of
an education. I am lucky that they
realize this, and they will not be
disappointed whatever I choose to
do.
Because I am unsure exactly
what I want to do, I am eager to
explore. Our options in this coun
try, with the added bonus of a
Stanford degree, are almost over
whelming. I want to take my time
experimenting, to inform myself
before making any commitments.
Maybe I'm a slow developer, but
I'm not quite ready to launch into
a full-scale professional project
like other people.
For a while, I thought I was
alone. This autumn I watched my

friends buy LSAT prep books, at
tend Stanley Kaplan seminars and
research the job offers at the
Career Planning and Placement
Center more thoroughly than any
paper they'd ever written. It
seemed like my classmates had
their entire futures mapped out
along paths I couldn't follow.
Something in the process of
tests and applications was remi
niscent of high school, when I
knew precisely what I wanted: ac
ceptance to a fine university. My
mind was completely focused on
that goal, and it's easier to get
what you want when you have a
plan. I had very concrete objec
tives: high SAT scores, plentiful
extra-curricular activities, student
leadership, good grades.
Now, my objectives are
slightly less defined in
light of all the possibilities.
I could go trekking through Tibet
with some photographer or build
houses for our homeless in the
South. I could intern for a news
paper anywhere in the country
(and bartend on the side before I

convinced the paper to pay me),
but I'm more interested in work
ing for some public-interest or
ganization in Mexico City.
I realize now that a large per
centage of our class feels as con
fused as I do. Graduating from
one of the most powerful univer
sities in this country, we really

do have a great advantage and
privilege not available to most
people. (I could expound here on
the implicit responsibility in this
privilege, but that's too great a
digression, even for this article.)
It's just a matter of refining our
desires in order to best choose in
what field to concentrate.
Sorting out what is important
to us as individuals takes time.
We are burdened with impatience
in this country, and demand in
stant results. But our lives will
not unravel instantaneously the
moment Commencement ends.
The experience of life is a process
â€” gradual, continual. Remaining
open to the options keeps me from
limiting myself. I'm not comfort
able leaping from goal to goal,
having every second planned. Part
of the excitement of Commence
ment is the sheer ambiguity of
my future, not being able to an
ticipate what might happen. Be
cause if I don't know, it certainly
could be amazing.
Josh Rowland, a fellow senior,
explained that "Right now, I feel
ambitionless. I have to get out

and see what people do with their
lives before I'm sure where I want
to fit in. And that's going to take
time. Coming out of this school,
a lot of people feel more pressure
to perform, whether it's because
of their parents' expectations or
loans, or just because they are
achievers. I think some people are
insecure with a humanities
degree. But I feel prepared, for
whatever I decide to do. I feel like
we could do anything."
