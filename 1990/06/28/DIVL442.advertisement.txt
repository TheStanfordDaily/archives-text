Unlike other financial institutions,
Stanford Federal Credit Union is not in
business to make a profit. We are here
to serve you. SFCU is a financial
cooperative, owned and operated by
our 25,000 members.
SFCU members turn to their Credit
Union for:
■ Interest-earning checking
■ Free Touch-Tone Phone Access
■ VISA Cards with 15% interest
■ Automated teller machines
■ Computer loans
■ Lifetime membership
If you would like more information
from the financial institution you could
own, give us a call at
(415) 694-1000.
