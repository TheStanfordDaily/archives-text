SUMMER at Stanford is
usually a quiet time.
Many students venture
off into the real world to
travel or work at summer
jobs. The proud University
transforms itself into a hotel,
hosting conferences and offer
ing outsiders a glimpse at the
Stanford mystique. But this
summer has already started
off on a different, discordant
note with a labor dispute
brewing and a rape in the
Foothills.
As spring quarter came to
a close and the student pop
ulation dwindled, the Board
of Trustees passed a proposal
that will cause the number
of workers on campus to
quietly dwindle as well while
many students are away. The
proposal will allow Tresidder
to contract out the work of
a veteran eight-person crew,
which includes an outspoken
former United Stanford
Workers leader, and in effect
lays these workers off.
Then, on the same weekend
that many students were
joining together to celebrate
Commencement, on the eve
ning before the Commence
ment ceremony, a woman was
raped at gunpoint in the Foot
hills. The woman was jogging
at 7:45 p.m. on a main path
and the attacker came up
from behind her and dragged
her into the woods.
Many graduating students
had not even heard the news.
Students preparing to leave
the "Disneyland of the
North" and head out into the
real world missed a message
that lingers on with those of
us who remain here, the mes
sage that this campus is part
of the real world and the real
world has some big problems.
The Commencement week
end rape, the first reported
rape on campus since 1983,
is only the most recent in a
series of sexual assaults. The
number of sexual assaults on

campus is nothing short of
alarming.
When we were planning the
focus of The Weekly this
spring, we hoped to shift its
emphasis from feature stories
to more in-depth news
analyses, but we worried
about whether there would
be enough news to keep us
busy over the summer
months. That concern has
quickly evaporated.
Our hope is that the prob
lems this University faces
over the summer will be dealt
with as decisively as problems
that arise during the normal
academic year.
The University should
work with its employees to
minimize the shocks of Uni
versity budget cuts. The
workers are individuals too
and the University should lis
ten to their concerns as well
as treat them with the respect
they deserve by honoring
their contracts. The standard
must be what the University
should do, not what it can
get away with.
This summer the Univer
sity should work to inform
visitors about the dangers of
running in the seemingly
harmless and serene Foot
hills. In the fall, the
University should make rape
education a priority. It is
tragic that problems have to
really hit home before we rec
ognize shortcomings in our
priorities.
The main mission of this
University is to teach individ
uals and prepare them for the
world. The University should
teach by example in dealing
with its employees and, in
dealing with threats to the
community, the University
must respond swiftly.
