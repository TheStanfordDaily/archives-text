Keep Wanat as
CTL instructor
We are writing out of concern
that Stanford might allow one
of its most devoted teachers to
slip through the cracks opened
by the recent financial crisis and
budget cuts. We hope that this
blow to the Stanford student
community can be avoided.
Stan Wanat plays a unique
role in the Stanford undergrad
uate community, one which
might not be apparent to those
who are uninvolved with the ed
ucational process at Stanford.
His job description of lecturer
at the Center for Teaching and
Learning does not do justice to
the role he plays and the edu
cational support he provides for
Stanford students.
We have found Wanat to be
one of the most accessible teach
ers on campus; he frequently
opens up his free time during
lunch and after hours for ap
pointments with students who
need assistance with academic
and even personal matters.
Wanat's role is unique in that

he helps students put their ed
ucation in perspective by teach
ing how to learn.
Wanat was extensively in
volved as both an instructor and
consultant for the Stanford
Medical Youth Science Program
for three years. In fact, he was
the first instructor to support
the project which will be suc
cessfully running for the third
year at Stanford this summer.
The important part of this is
that our own experiences are in
no way unique. When one
realizes how many students
Wanat helps every year, a
clearer picture of his importance
to the Stanford community
emerges.
Because Wanat puts the pri
ority of student welfare first; we
fear his efforts on behalf of stu
dents, and Stanford itself, might
go overlooked.
It is understandable that the
administration might not notice
those staff who give more atten
tion and energy to student wel
fare than to furthering their
own careers, but once Stanford
finds them, it should not let
them go.
We understand that Univer

sity President Donald Kennedy
has pledged not to sacrifice ac
ademic positions during reor
ganization. Given the intent of
this imperative, it is clear to us
that Wanat should fall well
within this safety net for assur
ing the continued quality of
Stanford's undergraduate
education.
Wanat is directly involved
with the heart of the educational
process at Stanford, a front-line
warrior on behalf of the stu
dents. While we understand that
the army at Stanford may need
to cut its overhead, it is unfor
tunate that anyone in Wanat "s
Eosition would not be protected
y those who give more than lip
service to undergraduate educa
tion.
Stanford needs to retain its
heroes. Cutting one's overhead
and cutting off one's head
should not be synonymous.
We sincerely hope Stanford
will see fit to keep staff who
directly benefit Stanford stu
dents as much as Wanat does.

Swimmers have
been ignored
Yep, just another ho-hum year
down at the ol' swimming pool.
The women*B swimming team
just went 8-0 in dual meets, won
the Pac-10 Championships for
the fourth year in a row, broke
six school records, won seven in
dividual and two relay titles on
the way to a narrow (9.5 points)
second-place finish at the NCAA
Championships
And the men's swimming
team merely won their ninth
straight Pac- 10 Championship,
finished in the top three at
NCAA's.
I find it difficult to believe
that not one of these ac
complishments merited mention
in The Daily's Top-10 sports
stories of the year. Perhaps we
should have tried shooting
three-pointers, hitting home
runs or smashing a winner down
the baseline.
