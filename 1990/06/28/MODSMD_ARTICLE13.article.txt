## Workers demand fair treatment 
### 
It has been the best of times;
it has been the worst of times.
How else can I describe work
ing as a laborer on Tresidder's
maintenance crew for ten years?
How has it been the best of
times? Well, first there is Henry
Battle, a black crew leader who
has worked here for 24 years.
Then, there's Paul Ortega, a Na
tive American custodian who
has worked here for about 30
years. There are seven cus
todians and one laborer on the
crew. We have been of every age,
from 23 to 87, and we are all
"minorities" if you include as a
minority Clyde Cookson, a 27-
year worker of Irish descent.
Because our uniforms look a
little shabby and are mis
matched, some might say our
crew looks "motley." But ap
pearances deceive. For 10 years
I have had the honor of working
with the most distinguished,
proudest, toughest group of cus
todians that ever graced our
campus.

For 10 years I have watched
the high-paid, well-dressed, all
white directors of Tresidder try
to bring this small, outspoken
crew to its political knees by
eliminating us, by doubling our
workloads and by threatening to
make day workers start their
shifts in the middle of the night.
For 10 years I have seen this
crew fight off attack after attack
and retain its dignity, outspoke
ness and survival as a group.
For 10 years I have also
watched the directors mis
manage Tresidder.
Their decisions have led to a
spiraling financial decline. The
downward trend is clear to
anyone with eyes.
We can remember 10 years
ago when the upstairs hall and
lobby were bustling with stu
dents. Now they are empty. We
can remember when the patio
was so crowded at noon, we
couldn't find one seat. Now
whole tables are empty.
And now they are now using

the consequences of their mis
management to justify getting
rid of us while preserving their
own positions.
How can we convince students
that it is not cost-effective to
get rid of productive workers
while retaining managers who
are paid two to three times as
much, and convince the staff
that if this happens, all staff
will be that much less secure?
In this commentary we can't.
Our crew, however, has faith in
the community's capacity to see
issues clearly, and to stand up
against anything this unfair.
Tresidder management has
been trying to get rid of us for
10 years. Can we win this fight
during an era of budget cuts?
It is a far, far tougher fight
than we have ever fought, but
the crew is in it all the way.
Yes, with your support we can
win.
