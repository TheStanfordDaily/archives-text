# Affirmative action mired in unjust criticism
## 
### 
I am a product of affirmative
action. Unfortunately, not too
many people can make that
claim with pride. There's a
stigma attached to affirmative
action. But I am not surprised.
Affirmative action was estab
lished two decades ago to rem
edy past ii\justices in education
and employment. Affirmative
action had as much of a stig
matized name in its beginnings
as it does now.
Opponents of affirmative ac
tion, such as Shelby Steele, a
black associate professor of Eng
lish at San Jose State Univer
sity, believe that affirmative
action socially and economically
weakens blacks and makes them
less efficient, more dependent on
the government and more iso
lated from mainstream America.
Critics claim that affirmative ac
tion exacerbates discrimination
and induces tension.
Indeed, there has been in

creased racial tension as a result
of affirmative action. Whites
have begun to complain that af
firmative action is reverse dis
crimination, resulting in such
legal victories as the 1978 Bakke
Supreme Court victory. Racial
tensions on college campuses
around the country have also
increased.
The backlash and the so
matization of affirmative action
does not surprise me. Every
thing that's associated with
black people or blackness as
defined by white America has a
stigma attached to it, including
the way we comb our hair, the
music we listen to, and what
and how we worship. Even the
terms used to describe the evil
things in life stigmatize that
which is black: blacklist, black
sheep, black plague, Black Mon
day, etc.
The attacks on affirmative ac
tion, established to increase the

power and representation of
blacks, is only an extension of
the stigmatization to which
blacks have always been subject.
I believe the stigmatization of
affirmative action (and of black
people), and not affirmative ac
tion itself, is responsible for the
backlash. The saddest part is
that some black people have con
tributed to that backlash.
I think the stigmatization of
affirmative action has played a
role in the alarming drop-out
rate of black college students.
Most black college students
don't drop out because they lack
the intelligence to do the course
work. They drop out because
they lack enough emotional and
economic support to feel wel
comed at a college or university.
Black students grow tired of bat
tling a racist system which con
stantly challenges their
existence on campus.
It's been shown that if a par

ent constantly tells his/her child
that he/she is stupid, then that
child will develop a low self
esteem and self-confidence.
Similarly, if black students are
told, either verbally or through
institutional neglect, that they
are not welcomed, that they are
not smart enough, and that the
only reason they're enrolled is
because of affirmative action,
then black students are not
going want to stick around.
Despite its stigmatization, I
do not think that affirmative
action should be abolished, but
constitutionally strengthened.
Affirmative action, like the Bill
of Rights, guarantees that the
U.S. will remain accountable to
its citizens of color. Affirmative
action is an affirmation of the
existence and contributions of
people of color in this country.
I am a product of affirmative
action. I do not view myself as
less than white students or un

deserving of being admitted to
Stanford. I think my academic
accomplishments and commu
nity service speak for them
selves.
I agree with law professor
Charles Lawrence of Stanford
in that I think it is important
for black people, particularly
black students, to acknowledge
affirmative action and to infuse
it with a positive connotation as
our parents did with the word
"Black" in the 1960'5.
We should not view affirma
tive action as a "hand-me-out"
from the government, but as
part of the civil rights that our
parents and grandparents
fought very hard to win for us.
As a product of affirmative ac
tion, I am proud to be a product
of that strong and determined
heritage.
