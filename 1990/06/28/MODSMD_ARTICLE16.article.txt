## Summer movies: hits or just hype? 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
Summer is here once again, and
with it come lazy mornings of
sleeping late, leisurely days of
sports and tanning and long
nights of revelry. Summer is the
time when students let their
minds float away, when they live
for the moment, free of the guilt
that ignoring class reading brings,
and liberated from the pressure
of midterms, finals, and papers.
For most of us on campus this
summer, this description does not
accurately depict our "lazy sum
mers," fully occupied by jobs,
classes and internships. However,
even those of us who are keeping
busy will probably find the time
to go out and catch a few movies.
At least, that's what the movie
industry is counting on.
Hollywood, ever eager to pro
vide an excuse for people to go to
the movies, has once again media
blitzed the summer lineup with
various potential blockbusters de
signed to use up the extra money
and time that summer usually
brings to viewing audiences.
In the process of examining
movie hypes and hopes, Enter
tainment presents some of the
movies you should consider — or
not consider — for this summer:
Leading the pack of hyped-up
summer movies is clearly "Dick
Tracy." Using publicity that mir
rors that of the somewhat disap
pointing "Batman," Touchstone
Pictures has overwhelmingly
promoted "Dick Tracy." An all
star cast — including Warren
Beatty as the man in yellow,
Madonna as the voluptuous

blonde bombshell Breathless Ma
honey, and A 1 Pacino and Dustin
Hoffman as part of an assortment
of bad guys — ensures great
public interest regardless of the
quality of the rest of the movie.
These names are sure to bring
audiences running, so overall
Touchstone seems to have struck
a gold mine.
However, even with such estab
lished stars, and though it may
be a better movie, "Dick Tracy"
is, surprisingly, not achieving the
box office success that "Batman"
did last year. Ironically, the type
of inundating media blitz that
caused "Batman" to be such a
success may be the very reason
that "Dick Tracy" is not doing as
well as expected. The public seems
to be tired, or even disgusted, with
this promotional overload and is
not responding as enthusiastically
as last summer.
A second potential summer hit,
"Robocop II," relies more upon
the success of its predecessor than
its incorporation of big names for
publicity. Actors like Peter Weller
do not really maintain the public
following that the more famous
stars do; still, those who liked the
first movie are likely to go to the
second, and that's quite a follow
ing in itself. "Robocop II" prom
ises the same intense action,
superlative special effects, and
satirical humor that the first
"Robocop" provided.
"Die Hard 2: Die Harder" is
another movie that is relying on
previous success to draw the
teeming movie hordes into the
theaters. The previews promise a
first-rate action-packed movie
based on the formula that
audiences devoured in the

original.
In "Die Harder," Bruce Willis
is back as John McClane, the cop
who always seems to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.
Also returning this sequel are
Bonnie Bedelia, who plays Mrs.
McClane, Reginald Veljohnson,
who plays the L.A. cop A 1 Powell,
and William Atherton, the annoy
ing reporter from the first movie.
Although all these actors did a
good job with their characters in
the first film, it might seem just
a little too coincidental that they
are all reunited in a similar situ
ation in Washington, D.C.
Although this recipe of duplica
tion may be tiresome to some
viewers, Twentieth Century Fox
is counting on the action scenes
to bring in both a huge following
and a huge profit.
On June 28, "Days of
Thunder," the new Tom Cruise
movie, makes its long-awaited
debut. For several months, bill
boards and previews have been
promoting this grounded version
of "Top Gun" by using Cruise's
name in slogans such as "Cruise
Like Thunder." Even though little
has been emphasized about the
movie itself, "Days" is still guar
anteed to attract a substantial au
dience based upon Cruise's
following alone.
A few movies this summer are
being promoted with the same
techniques as those mentioned
above, but on a much lesser scale.
For example, there is "The Ad
ventures of Ford Fairlane," star
ring Andrew Dice Clay, Wayne
Newton, Vince Neil, and a slew
of cameo performances by actors
anyone would recognize.
Capitalizing upon the tarnished

image of "The Diceman," this
movie — while certainly no block
buster — is counting on its mul
titudinous big names and the cult
following of Clay to reap profits.
"Young Guns II" brings back
the "brat pack" of the Wild West:
Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Suther
land, and Lou Diamond Phillips.
Also appearing are Christian
Slater of "Heathers" fame, and
James Coburn. The names in this
movie and its general action
theme are sure to do well in at
tracting audiences unless the plot
is wholly abysmal.
High visibilty and extensive
publicity do not, however, ensure
high quality. "Wild at Heart," a
film starring Nicholas Cage in
what is purported to be his best
role yet, was the winner of the
1990 Cannes film festival, but has
had little promotional coverage.
Other films with minimal hype

but maximum potential are
"Presumed Innocent," starring
Harrison Ford as the protagonist
of the screen adaptation of Scott
Turow's (a Stanford alum, by the
way) best-selling novel of the
same name, and "My Blue Heav
en," featuring Steve Martin, Rick
Moranis, and Joan Cusack in
what could be the best comedy of
the summer.
There's nothing wrong with the
massive publicity campaigns that
Hollywood utilizes to promote its
films. What is important is that
the public maintains a realistic
appraisal of what a movie is really
offering and resist being sucked
into the miasma of flashy images
and vague promises that many
hype campaigns rely upon in order
to bring people into the theater.
If the movie is great, lose yourself
in it, but don't misplace your
mind before you even get to the
theater.
