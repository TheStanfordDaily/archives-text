# 'The Band Wagon' rolls along
## Vincente Minelli's 1953 film still pleases modern audiences 
### Dionne Scott 
The Stanford Theatre is hold
ing a six-week film festival this
summer honoring Vincente
Minelli (June 22-August 2).
Many of his films feature such
greats as Judy Garland, Gene
Kelly, Fred Astaire, Elizabeth
Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Kather
ine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.
Generally, Minelli's films are
known for their sophisticated
background scenes, their viva
cious colors, and their fluid
camera movement. His musicals
give the audience light comedy,
catchy tunes and lively dance
routines. "The Band Wagon"
maintains this tradition.
"The Band Wagon" was first
released in 1953. Starring Fred
Astaire and Cyd Charisse, this
movie was produced by the writ
ers of "Singin' in the Rain."
"The Band Wagon" is about
former song-and-dance man
Tony Hunter, who is trying to
make a comeback in the enter
tainment world. Played by Fred
Astaire, Tony is witty, light

hearted, optimistic and always
smiling. Although the character,
like most of Minelli's cast, does
not have much depth, Tony is
integral to the musical enter
tainment and contributes to the
humorous aspects of the film.
Tony goes to New York and
runs into some old friends, Lily
and Lester Martin (Nanette
Fabray and Jack Buchanan),
who have written a script with
him as the lead. Minelli seems
to have chosen these actors to
play Lily and Lester for com
edy's sake, and they do a good
job.
The Martins convince a pro
minent drama director, Jerry
Cordova (Oscar Levant), to
direct their play. Since much at
tention is paid to his develop
ment, Cordova is the most
interesting character in the film.
In addition to his musical and
dramatic talent, Cordova is ec
centric, cunning and extremely
melodramatic. He walks around
wearing a smoking jacket with
a silk scarf, and is always
smoking a cigarette. These types

of characterizing mannerisms
enhance the viewer's apprecia
tion of the character.
Of course, our lead has to
have a leading lady. Her name
is Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd
Charisse). Gabby is a ballerina
whom Cordova selects as Tony
Hunter's leading lady in the
Martins' play.
As for Charisse's perform
ance, she does an awful job of
ballet dancing; her pliees and
pirouettes are stylistically inept
even though she is supposed to
be a wonderfully talented ballet
dancer. She can, however, dance
with inspiration in the jazzy
routines with Astaire.
Essentially, "The Band
Wagon" is entertaining - noth
ing more, nothing less. Despite
the relative shallowness of the
plot and characters, it's a light,
fun movie, and if it is any in
dication of what's to come in
the Vincente Minelli film festi
val - and if you enjoy musicals
- I suggest taking in one or two
of his movies.
