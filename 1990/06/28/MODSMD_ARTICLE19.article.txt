# The
						Sundays charm with beautiful basics

When The Sundays re
leased their debut album and
struck a hit chord with the
single "Here's Where the
Story Ends," you could see
the comparisons coming —
10,000 Maniacs, Edie Brickell
and the New Bohemians, the
Cocteau Twins, etc.
Lead singer Harriet
Wheeler may have the same
style as her predecessors in
the pop female vocalist cate
gory, but she is no carbon
copy. Whereas Brickell took
to the popular and Sinead
O'Connor took to the politi
cal, Wheeler takes to the ar
tistic with an equally
impressive and less preten
tious flair.
Don't expect any high-brow
moralism or obligatory polit
ical statements from this
British quartet.

Wheeler's observations
range from the simplistic
"Hideous towns/Make me
throw/Up" to more pensive
questions about life: "What
is so wrong with voicing your
doubt when I'm on my
own/It's perfectly fine to sleep
in a chair from Monday til
Saturday/What is so wrong
with talking out loud when
I'm all alone."
Wheeler sings over a back
pound of richly textured
back-to-the-basics pop,
featuring some of the most
pleasing acoustic guitar
sounds since Johnny Marr
left the Smiths. All ten songs
find the right mix of essential
sounds, always complete but
never overbearing.
With this cathartic combi
nation, The Sundays have put
together an album of funda
mental music that's as basic
as mußic — and life — should
be.
