# Erasure pleases crowds with a show of flash and fashion
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
To the uplifting music of Tchaikovsky's
"Nutcracker" and the slow movements of a large
crawling snail, the polar ice cave thaws, revealing
a psychedelic rainforest, complete with magic mush
rooms, dancing bumblebees and Andy Bell, dressed
as a giant green sunbird.
A bizarre look at the end of the ice age? Alice in
Wonderland meets the destruction of the ozone
layer?
No, it's Erasure, the progressive rock group from
England, coming true to their advertising promise
to match flash with fashion.
The flamboyant duo, together with four backup
singers, came back to the Bay Area for the second
time this year on their "Wild!" tour, with shows at
the Shoreline Amphitheater and Concord Pavilion.
Lead singer Bell, together with songwriter/
keyboardist Vince Clarke, lit up the stage with a
spectacular performance of catchy dance numbers
interspersed with slower ballads.
If the beat of their music is fashionably flashy,
then the parade of costumes and the neon stage
set are definitely flashy fashion.
Clarke, covered from head to toe in a sequin
jumpsuit and cap, stood stoically behind his syn
thesizer throughout the entire show, never cracking
a smile.

Clarke's solemn demeanor was in sharp contrast
to Bell's antics, which led him through three costume
changes and numerous showy dance moves with
his four backup dancers. At one point, Bell mounted
the large snail and hopped with it across the stage.
Bell's costumes were not for the squeamish.
He began as a sunbird, soon shedding his wings,
cape and crown, until he was left wearing a skimpy
sequined outfit, reminiscent of a Speedo with shoul
der straps.
He then changed into a red satin version of the
same outfit, complete with satanic bull horns ex
tending from his head and crotch.
For the encore, he changed into white, exchanging
his horns for "angelic" wings and a matching G
string.
Erasure began in 1985 after Clarke, formerly with
Depeche Mode and Yaz, placed an ad for a singer
in a British music magazine.
Bell emerged out of the scores of applicants, and
the two, together with their backup singers, imme
diately hit the charts in the United States with
their single "Who Needs Love Like That."
Now, five years and six albums later, Erasure
continues to produce quality dance hits and enter
tain crowds with their energetic performances.
They are sure to be back for another Bay Area
appearance, and for all those interested in flash,
fashion or the ozone layer, Erasure is not to be
missed.
