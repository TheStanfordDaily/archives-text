# New Cajun addition spices up Palo Alto
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
Let's face it: most American
food is pretty bland.
Our taste buds, in general, have
been turned into desensitized
mush by flavorless fast-food
burgers.
If you're tired of munching on
food that must be worse than
what the Army eats (especially if
you're eating University Food
Service), then you'll definitely
want to try out Crawdad and
Company on 626 Emerson in Palo
Alto.
As the name implies, the focus
of this restaurant is New Orleans
Csyun cooking, which means food
with some spicy kick to it. How
ever, unlike many Mexican es
tablishments which are able to
pass off bad food because it's too
hot for anyone to tell through
their scorched lips, Crawdad and
Company utilizes spice in an art
ful manner.
Under the direction of Chef
Duane Meares, who served with
the award-winning Elite Restau
rant of San Francisco for seven
years, the food has been "toned
down" a little from its hot Loui
siana origins. "Instead of strictly
Cajun," Meares explains, "we've
opted for a Creole style that's
more European."
This is no Paris Bistro, though.
Instead, the atmosphere is casual,
so that one would feel comfortable
eating there in a tux, suit, or even
a sweatshirt and jeans (like me).
General Manager Collene
McDaniel claims that they are
striving for a "social" atmosphere
where people are friendly and
happy to go to eat and talk.
In this effort, Crawdad and
Company seems to have
succeeded. The tables are pretty
close to one another, often
prompting couples at adjacent

tables to meet and talk with one
another. McDaniel claims that
she's even seen several couples
sharing food with the table next
to them so they can try some of
the other dishes.
If you're made this offer, accept
it. The food I had was excellent.
The appetizer, intriguingly named
"Oysters in Hell," consisted of
half a dozen deep-fried oysters
served in a marvelous sauce
refined by Chef Meares. More of
an outer ring of Dante's hell than
an inner Bolgia, it was spicy
enough to tantalize the tongue,
yet it did not scorch the taste
buds into oblivion.
This manner of gradually in
creasing the heat is intended by
Chef Meares, who points out that
"if you scorch someone's tongue
right away, they're not really
going to taste the rest of it. They'll
know it's hot, but they won't
really appreciate it."
This approach was duplicated
in the barbecued shrimp I had as
an entree. The first victim of the
ten to twelve plump, unpeeled
(don't get them on a first date,
you won't impress anyone with
your hands and face covered with
sauce) shrimp was mild. In fact,
I was almost disappointed; how
ever, as I delved deeper into the
entree, each shrimp was a little
more immersed in the sauce and
possessed greater flavor.
After vigorously utilizing the
hot napkin the waiter brought to
cleanse my hands, and the lemon
brought to cleanse my palate, I
treated myself to the dessert tray
and some cappuccino. The
cheesecake was delicious, melting
in the mouth and not too rich.
Other desserts included two pecan
items, one a pecan pie and the
other involving chocolate. Al
though I'm not usually a pecan
fan, both of these were good, as
was the bread pudding.
The ambiance of the restaurant
helps to magnify the excellence of
the dishes. As proprietor Ray
Talai, part-owner of the Elite res
taurant for nine years, em
phasizes, "More than just coming
to fill their stomachs, we want
people to leave here feeling good
in general. With good food, serv
ice, and atmosphere we want this
to be a place people come to enjoy
themselves."
Asked about his personal eval
uation of the restaurant, Talai
rates it presently an eight out of
ten, and he is working tirelessly
to make it that ten. Presently only
able to accomodate some forty-six
patrons at once, the restaurant
will soon expand to a second floor,
thereby doubling the space avail
able but maintaining the atmos
phere. With Louis Armstrong and
other blues and jazz tunes playing
softly across the wooden walls and
ceiling fans, that atmosphere is
very enticing. While not a place
you'd bring a date for an intimate,
romantic occasion, there is still
privacy in your conversations and
a general feeling of relaxation that
completes the enjoyment of the
experience.
While certainly not cheap, the
entrees are reasonably priced be
tween eight and fifteen dollars.
The fifteen dollar dish, by the way,
is blackened filet mignon which
Chef Meares claims is extremely
succulent, tender and flavorful.
That sounds like something worth
returning for.
Overall, Crawdad and Company
is a wonderful addition to Palo
Alto dining opportunities.
