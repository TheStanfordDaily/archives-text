"Betsy's Wedding," written
and directed by Alan Alda, tries
to grapple with modern prob
lems such as mixed marriage,
the generation gap, cheating and
financial finagling. Unfortu
nately, it forgets about the
basics: character development
and plot cohesiveness.
Betsy (Molly Ringwald) is a
supposedly-unconventional
daughter who would rather have
a small family wedding than the
grand ceremony her father,
Eddie Hopper (Alan Alda),
wants to give her. Eddie con
vinces Betsy and his wife Lola
(Madeline Kahn) to have the
fantastic wedding - several hun
dred people, a big reception

under a tent, a dance band -
despite his lack of funds to
finance such an event. He tries
to borrow the necessary money
from his unscrupulous brother
in-law Oscar (Joe Pesci), who in
turn gets Eddie into a "pencil
and eraser" deal with his pals
in the mob, one of whom is
Stevie (Anthony LaPaglia), the
overseer on Eddie's building
construction site.
Stevie "respectfully" falls in
love with Eddie's older daughter
Connie (Ally Sheedy) and tries
to woo the good will of Eddie
too. Stevie is the quintessential
slick Italian who dresses in ex
pensive suits, drives a red
sportscar, and listens to the
"classical" Frank Sinatra.
Connie, who is a cop because

she "likes to arrest people," sud
denly becomes the weepy and
emotional female at the sight of
her sister trying on a wedding
gown.
There are a few pleasurable
moments in "Betsy's Wedding,"
mostly those involving Eddie's
meditations with his dead father
(Joey Bishop). Yet, the jokes and
insights have all been heard
before.
What is not overly simplified
and predictable in this film is
vague (such as an unexplained
shootout). Its star-studded cast
is overshadowed by uninterest
ing characters. It is too bad that
Alda does not even make the
most of his own engaging per
sonality. "Betsy's Wedding" is a
disappointment.
