# 'Deathlok' takes hold of comic book fans
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
Imagine being forever re
quired to do the one thing in
the world that you find incred
ibly loathsome and hate with
your whole being.
If you can conceptualize that
feeling, you can come close to
what the scientist Michael Col
lins experiences in "Deathlok."
"Deathlok," a new four-part
series released by Marvel Com
ics, goes beyond the realm of
the everyday comic superhero
and into the mentality and
morals behind his actions. This
introductory story relates the
tale of Collins and how he is
forced to serve as the "human
software" in a cyborg built to
kill and destroy for its twisted
corporate master.
Collins is a happy family man
who discovers that the technol
ogy he's been working on is
being used to develop the ultim
ate lulling machine. He tries to
enlist the help of his supervisor,
Ryker, in stopping the project,
but Ryker shoots him and places
Collins' brain in the Cyborg for
"data storage."
While this sounds much like
the "Robocop" theme we've seen
in two movies, writers Dwayne
McDuffie and Gregory Wright
portray the inner torment of a
moral man trapped in an evil
casing more effectively than
other such stories have done.
Their talents, combined with
excellent artwork, enable the
reader to fully immerse himself
in the interaction between Col
lins' irrational, emotional

human psyche and that of the
super-intelligent computer that
pervades his every thought.
These two conflicting facets of
the mentality of the Deathlok
cyborg must attain some man

ner of symbiosis, and it is this
internal struggle that makes the
tale so riveting.
Along with this intriguing
mental battle come various en
gaging action scenes where the

cyborg wreaks havoc, at first fol
lowing the evil directions of its
programmer, but later following
the moral dictates of its human
half.
Overall, "Deathlok" is a
refreshing, innovative step off
the beaten track of comic lore.
One can only hope that this
four-part series will be followed
by a regularly released work. I
applaud Marvel for taking a
chance and publishing "Death
lok."

"Deathlok" tells the story of scientist Michael Collins who discovers his work is being used to
develop the ultimate killing machine. The four-part graphic novella artfully depicts the struggle
between human and computer when Collins' brain is placed in the cyborg he unwittingly created,
and he is programmed to kill.
