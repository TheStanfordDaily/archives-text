# 'Dick Tracy' succeeds despite Beatty's lead
## 
### Bill Thomas 
The "Dick Tracy" hype is
everywhere, and everywhere
it is big and irritating. "Bat
man" has set a precedent
which it seems we, a media
consuming population, must
deal with. This time, Daring
Dick is here in all of his
resplendent hard-nosed
courage to sweep us away into
detective fantasyland. Or not.
Beatty both stars and
directs this piece of eye candy
and the result falls into a cat
egory that is technically in
teresting but easily
forgettable. Beatty's
portrayal of the comic strip
hero is plain and boring; as
a director, he shows a great
aptitude for keeping the
camera focused very closely
on his hunk-of-yore face. Yet,
without the trademark Dick
Tracy yellow hat and coat, he
might well have disappeared
from the movie all together.
With Tracy out of the way,
Big Boy Caprice (A 1 Pacino)
could have owned the whole
flick. Beneath what must
have been several pounds of
prosthetic make-up, Pacino is
full of roguish energy. He is
a source of character and
humor. Dustin Hoffman
turns in an excellent perform
ance as Mumbles, the
seemingly inarticulate
gangland informant for
Tracy. Far too brief, Hoff
man's appearances allow him
once again to show off his
physical skill and control as

If Madonna insists on at
tempting an acting career, she
has found her niche as a car
toon actress. Playing Breath
less Mahoney, she is a sultry,
if not downright horny,
nightclub singer and
paramour of powerful
gangsters. Thanks to excel
lent camera work and
audience- melting body
motion, Madonna simply
aches with sensuality at
times.
The thin plot surrounds
Big Boy's bid for power in
gangland. The way it works
out, Big Boy is more involved
than Tracy in taking action
within the plot. This is just
as well as it allows the audi
ence to revel in Pacino's ran
ting antics.
"Dick Tracy" is an enter
taining movie, but not be
cause of Beatty or his
character, who have little to
do with the enjoyment of the
audience. Thanks to the ex
cellent supporting actors, in
novative camera work, and
well-planned technical pres
ence, "Dick Tracy" is an over
all success. The technical
crew masterfully use film
techniques to simulate a
comic strip, the bad guys are
deformed with magnificently
grotesque prosthetic make
up, and the colorful sets pos
sess a surreal quality which
intrigues the viewer.
All in all, go see it, but
don't be fooled by the hype
and title.
