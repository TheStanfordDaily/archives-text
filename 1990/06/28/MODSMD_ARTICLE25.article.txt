# 'Robocop 2' is a mechanical mess

Non-stop violence, gallons of blood, and pieces
of metal splattering across the screen characterize
yet another Hollywood sequel, "Robocop 2."
The second installment of the 1987 hit once
again stars Peter Weller as the cop-turned-cyborg.
This time around, Robocop must stop a drug
lord, Cain, from spreading his extremely addicting
"Nuke" across the streets of Detroit. To compl
icate matters, the police force is currently on
strike and unable to combat the increased drug
related crime, while Omni Consumer Products
(OCP) is attempting to foreclose on Detroit be
cause of unpaid loans.
Amidst all these dilemmas, Robocop himself
encounters problems as he attempts to reconcile
his past human life as Officer Alex J. Murphy
with his current status as a law enforcement
machine, created and owned by OCP In addition,
OCP, under the guidance of the power-hungry
Doctor Juliette Faxx, is producing a second
Robocop, which is innovatively named Robocop 2.
If all this sounds like too much to tackle in a
single two hour movie, it is. All these plots and
subplots amount to nothing more than a filler
to bridge the gap between the shoot-em-up-dead
sequences . As if the gunfire is not enough to
gross the viewer out, there are additional
gratuitous scenes such as a graphic removal of
a brain from a skull and a cutting open of person's
chest to repulse just about everyone.
The special effects, highlighted by a battle be
tween Robocop and Robocop 2, also seem a bit
old and unimpressive. At times, so much metal
is interwoven together that the two robots cannot
be distinguished. Thus, what is supposed to be
the climactic thrill of the film ends up being a
confusing eyesore.
The only interesting thing this movie has to
offer is the occasional glimpse of futuristic tele
vision advertisements. One of the funniest of
these is for a "Sunblock 5000" product, in which
a bikini clad woman tells the television audience,
as she applies the blue flourescent lotion on her
skin, that the product gives maximum protection
now that the ozone layer has been destroyed.
Even though these are not that relevant to the
story, they do provide a jocular respite from the
usual mayhem and gunfire.
Perhaps if the film had centered around
Robocop's problems exclusively, or focused pri

marily on the greed perpetuated by the over
ambitious executives at OCP, it might have com
pared to the original. But director Irvin Kershner
("Empire Strikes Back") puts all his efforts into
non-stop violence and special effects, and ends
up sacrificing any real emotion the viewer has
with the film.
While the original "Robocop," directed by Paul
Verhoeven ("Total Recall"), presented a well
developed story with both satire and thrilling
action sequences which made it a box office hit,
the sole purpose of "Robocop 2" is to cash in on
the success of its predecessor. In fact, many of
the problems presented in the film are never
resolved, undoubtedly leaving room for a
"Robocop 3" and making the film overall un
satisfying and inconclusive.
