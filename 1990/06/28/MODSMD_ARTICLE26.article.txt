## McEnroe, Mayotte upset at Wimbledon 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
John McEnroe, sadly older but no wiser, won
a meaningless war of words while staggering
wearily to a first-round loss on Wimbledon's worst
day ever for seeded players.
In addition to McEnroe, ex-Stanford player Tim
Mayotte, the tournament's sixth seed, also fell,
while 1986 graduate Jim Grabb upset the fifth
seed, Andres Gomez. Gomez was coming off the
first Grand Slam title of his career after winning
the French Open earlier this month, but on grass
he had no answers for Grabb.
But McEnroe's match was clearly the day's
biggest news. Once again, his mouth got in the
way of his talent, breaking his concentration and
wasting his energy.
"If I knew the answer to why I did those
things, I'd probably be senator of New York right
now, at a minimum, if not the president of the
United States," the 1978 NCAA champion said
with a shrug.
McEnroe's moments of glory on Centre Court
in three Wimbledon championships seemed far
away Tuesday as he absorbed a relentless assault
of volleys and serves by fellow ex-Cardinal Derrick
Rostagno in a 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 loss.
Mayotte was upset by Gary Muller, 4-6, 7-6
(7-1), 7-5, 6-3 while Grabb posted a 6-4, 6-2, 6-2
win over Gomez. Grabb will play Paul Chamber
lain, a four-set winner over Mark Petchey, in the
second round.
Rostagno, who held two match points before
losing to Boris Becker at the U.S. Open last year
and lost a tough five-setter to Jimmy Connors
here two years agof will face Jeremy Bates in
the second round. Bates lost the first two sets
in tiebreakers before coming back to post a five
set victory over Peter Lundgren Tuesday.
Five months after getting thrown out of the

Australian Open, McEnroe's earliest Wimbledon
exit since 1978 forced him to take a hard look
at his tennis future.
"I feel pretty strongly that this is just the
beginning but if I take a couple of steps in the
wrong direction, in my opinion I'll be out of the
game in six months," McEnroe said.
Other former Stanford stars received mixed
results in the first round of the world's most
prestigious tournament. David Wheaton, who led
Stanford to the 1988 NCAA title, started on the
right foot by defeating Magnus Larsson 7-6 (7-3),
6-4, 6-2. He will play Paul Annacone.
Dan Goldie, the 1986 NCAA singles champion,
handled Ralph Kok 7-5, 6-1, 7-5 and will next
play Ken Flach, a straight-sets winner over Mic
hiel Schapers.
Jeff Tarango, who turned pro after the 1989
season, fell to the big serve of Kevin Curren, 6-1,
6-4, 6-1.
On the women's side, 1987 and 1988 NCAA
singles champ Patty Fendick opened with a 7-5,
7-5 win over Hu Na. She will next play Susan
Sloane, a three-set victor over Linda Ferrando.
Tami Whitlinger and Meredith McGrath, who
ended 1989 and 1990, respectively, as the nation's
top-ranked player, then turned pro, also won.
Whitlinger handled Robyn Field 6-3, 6-2 and ad
vances to face Joanne Faull, a 6-2, 6-1 winner
over Petra Langrova.
McGrath, the 1990 NCAA doubles champion
with Whitlinger's twin sister, Teri, defeated Elena
Brioukhouvets 6-1, 6-2. She earns the privlege
of meeting top-seeded and two-time defending
champion Steffi Graf, who beat Claudia Porwik
by an identical score.
On the downside, Marianne Werdel, who played
here in 1986, fell to Ann Henricksson 7-5, 6-2;
Elise Burgin lost to fourth-seeded Gabriela
Sabatini 6-3, 6-3; and Anna Ivan, who competed
for the Cardinal in 1985, fell to Nathalie Her
reman 7-5, 6-3.
