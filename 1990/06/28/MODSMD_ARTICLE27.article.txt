Card netters nab
postseason honors
After the Stanford men's
and women's tennis teams
both won the NCAA title this
year, it seems only fitting that
some Cardinal players should
win postseason honors. And
while sometimes the obvious
is disregarded when awards
are passed out, that was not
the case this year.
Sophomore Debbie Graham
and freshman Jonathan Stark
were both named the Pacific
10 Conference Players of the
Year, while Stark and
Meredith McGrath were
named the national Freshmen
of the Year.
Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan was also named the con
ference's women's Coach of the
Year.
Stark, from Medford, Ore.,
played No. 1 singles and No.
1 doubles for the Cardinal. De
spite suffering from a stress
fracture in his foot during the
latter part of the season, Stark
posted a 20-2 record in singles.
In doubles, Stark combined
with Jared Palmer to form the
nation's top-ranked doubles
team.
Graham, however, had an
even better season. The Foun
tain Valley, Calif, native was
25-0 in dual-matches singles
play and is now 52-0 for her
career. Despite playing at No.
3 singles all year for Stanford,
Graham came on strong at the
end of the season to win the
Pac-10 singles title.
Proving that win was not a
fluke, Graham then went on
to win the NCAA singles title.
She and Sandra Birch also ad
vanced to the NCAA doubles
final for the second consecu
tive year.

McGrath, from Midlands,
Mich., played No. 2 singles for
the Cardinal all season long.
When Birch, Stanford's No. 1
player, hit a late-season slump,
McGrath took over the na
tion's No. 1 ranking for several
weeks. She and Teri Whit
linger defeated Graham and
Birch to win the NCAA dou
bles crown.
Stark, Palmer and sopho
more Alex O'Brien were selec
ted to the All-Pac-10 men's
team while Graham, McGrath,
Birch, Whitlinger and Lisa
Green were chosen for the
women's team.
Two on academic
All-America list
Boosting Stanford's reputa
tion as the top athletic and
academic school in the nation,
two Cardinal athletes were
named to the GTE Academic
All-America team.
Sandra Birch was named to
the first team while Karen
Kraemer was selected to the
second team.
Birch, a junior from Hun
tington Bay, N.Y., started the
season as the defending NCAA
singles champion. She played
No. 1 singles all year long and
led the Cardinal to its fifth
consecutive NCAA Women's
Tennis Championship.
She compiled a 30-7 individ
ual record for the Cardinal in
singles and played No. 2 dou
bles with Debbie Graham.
Birch and Graham reached the
NCAA doubles final for the
second consecutive year, fall
ing to teammates Meredith
McGrath and Teri Whitlinger
in the final.
Birch, an economics mtyor,
has a 3.7 GPA and is a member
of the Stanford Athletic Honor
Roll.

Kraemer, a sophomore
swimmer from Palo Alto,
helped the Cardinal to a
second-place finish at the
NCAA championships after
Stanford won the title last
year.
Kraemer placed fifth in the
200-yard freestyle, seventh in
the 500 freestyle and 10th in
the 1,650 freestyle. She also
swam a leg on the NCAA
champion 800 freestyle squad
and the third-place 400 free
style relay team.
Kraemer has a 3.8 GPA in
mathematical and computa
tional sciences and is also a
member of the Athletic Honor
Roll.
Men's soccer coach
resigns from post
After six years at Stanford,
men's soccer Coach Sam Koch
has decided to leave to pursue
other interests.
Koch, who compiled a 58-
53-16 record here, was named
the Pacific Soccer Conference
Coach of the Year in 1987.
That season the Cardinal
posted four consecutive wins
against three top-20 — and
two top-five — teams.
The Cardinal went 8-11-2
last year but defeated No. 9
SMU and No. 16 Old
Dominion and took top-ranked
Virginia to overtime.
"I feel the soocer program
is in a good situation," Koch
said in a statement. "The pro
gram is on the threshold of
attaining great heights and I
must admit that I will be dis
appointed not being the one
to take this team one final
step to consistent top-20
status."
A search for a successor has
already begun.
