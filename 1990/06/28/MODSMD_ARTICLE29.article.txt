# New DRs feature multiculturalism
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
If next year's Faculty Senate
approves the recent proposals
for revising the University's dis
tribution requirements, Stan
ford's Class of '95 could face
more requirements for courses
exploring multiculturalism and
fewer for classes in the tradi
tional social and behaviorial sci
ences.
The recommendations, pre
sented to the senate during its
June 14 meeting, call for the
introduction of three new re
quired areas — World Cultures,
American Cultures and Gender
Studies; and the collapsing of
the current Area 4: Human De
velopment, Behavior and Lan
guage and Area 5: Social Pro
cesses and Institutions into a
single requirement. The gender
studies requirement could be
fulfilled at the same time as an
other requirement, like the cur
rent non-Western culture re
quirement.
Members of the senate, while
sympathetic with the intentions
of the recommendations, raised
concerns about the growing
number of requirements, the
cutbacks in social science re
quirements, and the prominence
of multiculturalism in the cur
riculum.
Several social science profes
sors questioned the proposal to
combine the social and behav
ioral sciences into one require
ment and asked why the math,
science and technology require
ments were not condensed in
stead.
Dean of Undergraduate Stu
dies Thomas Wasow responded
that the three courses were the
absolute minimum to prepare
students for scientific literacy in
today's technological society.
But Education Prof. Denis
Phillips countered that since all
Stanford students are going to

be living in society, a basic un
derstanding of the social and be
havioral sciences was also a ne
cessity.
"I would have thought there
was an equally strong argument
for collapsing the science re
quirements," he said.
Wasow explained that while
engineers will take humanities
and social science courses on
their own initiative, most hu
manities students will only take
math and science courses when
forced to by requirements.
Most of the courses satisfying
the new World Cultures, Amer
ican Cultures and Gender
Studies requirements would fall
within the existing Areas 4 and
5.
But faculty members raised
concerns that the new require
ments would limit students in
the scope of their course selec
tions.
History Prof. Peter Duus,
who headed the requirement
revising committee, defended
the recommendations, arguing
that any set of requirements in
volves "some type of trade-off."
While students may lose
breadth in subject matter
through the new requirements,
Duus said they will gain breadth
in a geographical and cultural
sense.
In another line of questioning,
Political Science Prof. David
Abernathy challenged the spe
cial attention given to multicul
turalism in the new require
ments.
"You could also argue that it
is important to deal with euch
issues as the environment, world
peace [and] urbanization," he
said. "I'd like to hear why some
things are important, why they
are so substantive and others
are not."
Abernathy suggested broaden
ing the requirement to include
all courses dealing with issues
pertinent to good citizenship.
Duus said the recommenda
tions dealt heavily with multi
culturalism because this was the
subject of the proposals brought
before them.
Some of the faculty members
were hesitant about increasing
the number of requirements.
The proposed recommendations
would increase the number of
required courses from ten to
eleven.
History Prof. Peter Stansky
asked whether the University,
by requiring an increasing num
ber of courses, was playing "too
much the role of a nanny."
Phillips agreed. "Solving the
problems of society is not done
by adding more courses to the
curriculum," he said.
The senate will not take offi
cial action on the proposals until
it reconvenes next fall.
