# Commencement 1990
## Into the future... 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
Chanting "Rap! Rap! Rap!" Stanford's
graduating class of 1990 brought the
Fleet Street Singers back on stage to
perform their informal version of "The
Stanford Hymn." Much to the graduates'
delight, the singers turned our solemn
alma mater into a final denunciation of
the Golden Bears.
From the Fleet Street rap to frisbres
and water guns, the June 17 commence
ment screamed "Stanford."
"It sure as hell was not Cambridge,"
said James McCoy, uncle of graduating
senior Deborah Brear, remarking on the
spontaneity of Stanford's 99th com
mencement.
However, there were also serious mo
ments during the ceremony. Welcoming
a proud audience of nearly 30,000, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy urged
graduates to recognize the sacrifice and
support of those who had made the day
possible. With gratitude, graduates
turned to salute families, friends and
faculty.
Recognizing the contributions of
twenty retiring professors and six re
cently named to endowed professorships,
Kennedy thanked them for their
"influence on generations of Stanford
students."
The Commencement address, delivered
by Marian Wright Edelman, President of
the National Children's Defense Fund
and a former attorney for the NAACP
Legal Defense and Education Fund, en
couraged students to struggle for Amer
ica's conscience and future. Edelman
exhorted students to be moral examples
and to define success as common good
instead of personal gain.
Kennedy addressed the 1990 graduates
for the last time after the conferral of
degrees. Recounting many happenings at
Stanford and in the world in the past
four years - the "battle" of Western Cul
ture, Gorbachev's visit, environmental
crises and the fall of the Berlin Wall -
he said the only thing certain about life
after Stanford is that it will be full of
change.
"At this particular time in the history
of our planet, [change] is both necessary
and inevitable," said Kennedy. He added
that, drawing on experiences at Stanford,
graduates should be able to adapt to
changes and to make changes, he added.
Kennedy stressed that personal devel
opment is as important as intellectual
development. "They have learned, after
all, in an environment that is anything
but an ivory tower," he said.

For the first time in Stanford's history,
alcohol was not allowed at commence
ment, due to the new policy which
prohibits alcoholic beverages in the sta
dium. Graduate Sam Schwartz said the
alcohol policy was ' coo bad" and that he
wished the University had more trust in
students
Sociology Prof. Szor\ja Szelenyi said
she was told by marshals that the absence
of alcohol "made a tremendous differ
ence" and that this year's commencement
was much more organized.
"I didn't notice the difference. People
had fun either way," said graduate Tracy
King.
Indeed students had fun. There were
open gowns, cartwheels, bubbles and dis
orderly lines. To Szelenyi, this seemed
inappropriate until she remembered
Stanford has a reputation for breaking
rules. "No problem, just another rule is
being broken," she said.
