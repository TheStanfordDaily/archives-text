At its June 15 meeting, the
Board of Trustees approved a
proposal to construct a new out
patient care building for the
Stanford Clinic and finalized
plans to complete Kimball Hall
by September 1991.
The board accepted the pro
posal for the medical building
only in concept; a final decision
on the project will not be made
until December.
The medical building, which
is expected to cost between $5
million and $6 million, will be
located at 851 Welch Rd. Con
struction is projected to begin
next January, and the building
could be operational as early as
next year, according to Donald
Tower, executive director of the
clinic.
The Stanford Clinic, located
at the Boswell Building Clinics,
is operated by the Faculty Prac
tice Program. The FPP runs
programs through which
doctors at the School of Medicine
provide expertise in their med
ical fields to outpatients.
The decision to expand the
clinic was prompted by an un
expected increase in outpatient
visits. "We've gone from 140,000
outpatient visits a year to
220,000," said Tower.
The increase was caused by

shifting from hospitals to clinics,
as well as overall changes in the
practice of medicine.
The Boswell Building Clinics
can accommodate only 140,000
patients. Planners did not an
ticipate the increase during a
1980 renovation of the building.
In other business, the board
also made the final decision
needed to proceed with Kimball
Hall.
Construction on the $10.8
million project is expected to
begin within days, and should
be fully underway by mid- to
late July.
Kimball Hall, a 200-bed dor
mitory, will be located next to
Branner Hall and will displace
20 of the 116 trailers in Man
zanita Park.
It is expected to be completed
in time for occupancy in fall
1991.
Five new trustees have been
added to the 32-member board.
Four of them were elected by
the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion by a process which takes
place every two years.
The fifth new trustee, Roger
Clay, was appointed by the mem
bers of the board. Roger Clay is
an attorney in Oakland, and is
also on the Stanford Alumni Ex
ecutive Board.
Two of the new trustees are
women, and three are black.
