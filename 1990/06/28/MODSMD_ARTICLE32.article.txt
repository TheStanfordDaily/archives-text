# New network quickens communication links

This summer, Stanford, in col
laboration with Pacific Bell, will
be the first to test a new high
speed, fiber-optic data transmis
sion system that promises users
rapid access to distant super
computers and information re
sources.
Bill Yundt, director of Stan
ford's Networking and Commu
nication systems, called the
Switched Multimegabit Data
Service a "new approach by the
telephone companies to support
high-speed data transmission
over telephone facilities." He
said the increased speed could
be a boon to researchers.
The service utilizes digital
transmission techniques, which
are the same as those used by
the telephone system to carry
calls across the country. The
current campus networking sys
tem is based on Ethernet which
connects to the outside world
using lines that run at a speed
of 1.5 million bits per second.
The speed of the new digital
technologies is 44.5 million bits
per second and future improve
ments are expected to deliver
speeds from 150 million to more
than 1 billion bits per second.
Currently, a single Stanford
user with a powerful IBM PC,
Macintosh or engineering
workstation can interact with
other computers at speeds as
high as a million bits per second.
However, if, for example, two
people try to access the Cray
supercomputer at NASA-Ames
concurrently, each trying to send
a million bits per second over a
line incapable of handling the
combined load, one or both are
forced to slow down. Just a few
high-speed applications can clog
the network, rendering it un
usable. Higher speed links
promise the only relief.
The trial will connect multiple

experimental locations on the
Stanford campus to each other
and, by fiber-optics, to the
Pacific Bell research and devel
opment labs in San Ramon —
over 25 miles away.
When used to carry voice, the
high-speed digital transmission
channels are divided into many
smaller subchannels of fixed
size, one for each conversation.
When used for transmitting
data, the high-speed transmis
sion channel may be divided
among its users according to the
speed at which they are able to
transmit data.
The service promises long
distance improvements since
people will no longer have to
drive to a work station to access
a supercomputer. "A lot of time
is spent with people traveling to
remote supercomputers and
high-speed workstations that
are connected to them, instead
of having the efficiency and con
venience of being able to work
from their office," Yundt said.
The data service could expand
the capabilities of the Stanford
computer network, SUNet, to
include computers throughout
the Bay Area and aid in campus
interactions. Yundt said, "In the
short term, it [the new technol
ogy] would be most useful for
the connections between Hop
kins Marine Station, or other
affiliated off-campus offices,
and the Stanford main campus."
It will also include experi
ments in areas such as image
compression and medical image
transmission conducted by
Robert Gray, a professor of elec
trical engineering. This technol
ogy would allow a doctor at
Stanford Medical Center to
transfer a radiogram or other
clinical outputs routinely over
the network to another doctor
at another location, such as the
Veterans' Administration
Hospital.
