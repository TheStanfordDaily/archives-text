"Old slave woman, I don't
care any more about your old
anti-slavery talk than I do for
an old flea bite."
[Sojourner Truth] snapped
back at him, and said, "That's
alright, but the Lord willing, I'm
going to keep you scratching."
"You just need to be a flea
against injustice," said Marian
Wright Edelman, president of
the Children's Defense Fund in
Washington, D.C., in her Com
mencement address June 17.
"Enough committed fleas biting
strategically can make even the
biggest dog uncomfortable and
transform even the biggest na
tion."
Edelman continued, "The
1990s struggle is for America's
conscience and future."
She urged graduates to be
moral examples. Warning them
not to confuse legality with
morality, she told them not to
lie or cheat, "... even if every
Milken, Boesky, North, Secord
or public official does."
Encouraging graduates to im
prove the world, Edelman chal
lenged them to redefine the
standard for success as common
good â€” not personal greed. She
told them to ask "How much
can I do without and share?"
rather than "How much can I
get?"
Success for the common good
will only happen through dedi

cation, persistence and hard
work, Edelman said. "There is
no free lunch."
Wanting changes is not
enough, she insisted. One has
to be willing to juggle competing
demands by making hard
choices and sacrifices in order
to "rebuild family and commu
nity and build for the future,
as we must," she added.
Speaking of present-day
stagnation, Edelman said,
"Many whites favor racial jus
tice as long as things remain
the same." She noted Americans
want to lower the deficit "as
long as somebody else's taxes
are raised and somebody else's
program is cut."
"This country needs more
wise and courageous shepherds
and fewer sheep, who borrow
from integrity to fund ex
pediency," she said.
James McCoy, a Menlo Park
resident, said Edelman was an
excellent speaker. "She makes
you feel lazy," he added.
"It was a message we could
all implement in our lives," said
Deborah Turner of Washington,
D.C. Agreeing with Turner,
Amanda Cole of Menlo Park said
she would like Edelman's words
to give to her children.
She sounded "like someone's
mom," said Michael Gordon,
who received a Ph.D. in mechan
ical engineering. He said her
speech was a more personal mes
sage than past commencement
speeches.
