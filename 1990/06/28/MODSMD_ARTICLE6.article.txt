for four previous rape attempts because
his physical description and methods of
attack are similar to those reported in
the other cases.
However, police have not ruled out the
possibility that there could be a copycat
rapist involved in the attacks.
The first of the four similar incidents
took place on July 8, 1989 at 10:30 a.m.
by a gate on Alpine Road. The woman
was struck in the head with a rock but
managed to run away.
The second attack occurred on Oct.
25, 1989 at about 8:30 p.m. on the main
road near the Stanford Solar Obser
vatory. The woman entered the roadway
at the gated entrance near the intersec
tion of Junipero Serra and Santa Maria
Street. Not far from there she was ac
costed by an assailant with a knife.
The third attack occurred on Nov. 27,
1989 just after sunset at an undisclosed
location in the Foothills. That assailant
also had a knife.
The fourth attack occurred in Decem
ber 1989 at a parking lot near the Sharon
Heights Safeway. The assailant attacked
a lone woman at night. His description
and method of attack matched those of
the suspect in the other incidents.
In all of the attacks, the women saw
the man before he assaulted them from
behind. "He's visible. They have all seen
him," Niemeyer said.
In each of the cases, the suspect used
a bar or neck hold to try to obtain control
over the woman.
Police have increased their presence in
the Foothills by patrolling in vehicles,
on horseback, and on motorcycles. "We're
up there, we have visibility," said
Niemeyer.
However, he added that it is difficult
to patrol the large area at all times since
the police have limited resources.
The police are urging joggers to run

The serenity of the Stanford Foothills
was brutally disturbed on June 16, when
a woman was raped and robbed at gun
point.
Police are searching for a man they
believe may be responsible for this crime,
as well as four previous rape attempts,
and they are urging people not to walk
or run alone in the Foothills.
According to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, the victim — a local
resident who was unfamiliar with the
area — was walking along a paved road
when she became disoriented and asked
the assailant for directions.
The man, who had been following her,
led her off the main road onto a dirt
path and down a ravine. As he stopped
to tie his shoe, the victim passed in front
of him.
The suspect then came up from behind
and employed either a bar hold or a
headlock to overpower the woman. She
reported seeing a handgun.
After the assault, the woman made
her way down the hill where she met a
couple who took her to Stanford Medical
Center's emergency room.
Niemeyer said the victim sustained no
serious bodily injuries but was severely
traumatized by the incident.
The attack occurred at approximately
7:45 p.m., well before sunset.
The suspect is a white male, 25 or 26
years of age, 6 feet 2 inches tall, 190
pounds with an athletic build.
He was wearing a red baseball cap, a
white sweatshirt, possibly with red let
tering, dark gray walking shorts and ten
nis shoes. This attire is similar to that
worn by many who run or walk in the
Foothills.
Although they cannot be certain, police
believe the suspect may be responsible

the suspect has previously struck around
sunset, there is "no guarantee he will
stick to the same pattern," according to
Niemeyer. He pointed out that the first
attack occurred in the morning.
Although the police have received a
dozen calls providing information, they
still have no solid leads. They request
that anyone who notices anything sus

911.

added that this is how suspects are often
apprehended.

According to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, the victim — a local
resident who was unfamiliar with the
area — was walking along a paved road
when she became disoriented and asked
the assailant for directions.
The man, who had been following her,
led her off the main road onto a dirt
path and down a ravine. As he stopped
to tie his shoe, the victim passed in front
of him.
The suspect then came up from behind
and employed either a bar hold or a
headlock to overpower the woman. She
reported seeing a handgun.
After the assault, the woman made
her way down the hill where she met a
couple who took her to Stanford Medical
Center's emergency room.
Niemeyer said the victim sustained no
serious bodily injuries but was severely
traumatized by the incident.
The attack occurred at approximately
7:45 p.m., well before sunset.
The suspect is a white male, 25 or 26
years of age, 6 feet 2 inches tall, 190
pounds with an athletic build.
He was wearing a red baseball cap, a
white sweatshirt, possibly with red let
tering, dark gray walking shorts and ten
nis shoes. This attire is similar to that
worn by many who run or walk in the
Foothills.
Although they cannot be certain, police
believe the suspect may be responsible

the suspect has previously struck around
sunset, there is "no guarantee he will
stick to the same pattern," according to
Niemeyer. He pointed out that the first
attack occurred in the morning.
Although the police have received a
dozen calls providing information, they
still have no solid leads. They request
that anyone who notices anything sus

picious report it immediately by calling
911.
"If people see anything hanging around
the bushes, don't slough it off but call
it in immediately," urged Niemeyer. He
added that this is how suspects are often
apprehended.
