# Sexual assault pervasive at Stanford
## 
### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
Although the June 16 rape in the Foot
hills is the first rape to be reported to
the Stanford Police Department since
1983, statistics show that sexual assault
and harassment are persistent problems
at Stanford.
Sexual offenses occur with alarming
frequency on campus. According to Stan
ford Police records, there were three
sexual assaults in both 1988 and 1989,
all six of which were attempted rapes.
Police define the category of sexual as
sault as physical assaults of a sexual
nature, including rapes.
Although no rapes have been reported
in the past seven years, there were six
rapes in the three years between 1980
and 1982. Overall, there are 19 reported
cases of sexual assault throughout the
1980s.
Police group sexually related incidents
other than assault and rape into a "mis
cellaneous sexual offenses category"

which includes indecent exposure and in
cidents of "peeping toms." There were
19 such offenses in 1988 and 38 in 1989.
Sexual harassment also occurs fre
quently over the phone. According to
police records in 1989, there were more
than 34 complaints of harassing phone
calls, the meyority of which were obscene
in nature. From 1979 to 1988, 254 such
complaints were filed.
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer observed that increases in the
number of reported incidents are often
cyclical. An individual may choose to
make the campus his stalking ground,
causing the crime rate to increase during
his stay, Niemeyer explained. He pointed
out that the large number of rapes that
occurred between 1980 and 1982 were
probably committed by one individual.
Although the rate of sexual assault at
Stanford is lower than other communi
ties of the same population, the number
of incidents is still alarming. This is par
ticularly true since most sexual offenses
and obscene phone calls are not reported

to the police.
Niemeyer said most incidents of in
decent exposure are never reported be
cause people do not consider them
serious. Although 35 cases of indecent
exposure were reported in 1989, there
may well have been over 50 incidents,
Niemeyer said.
He said although people should not
become hysterical with fear, they should
nonetheless be aware of their surround
ings. "As opposed to 30 years ago, you
can't leave your doors unlocked. People
need to be aware of their personal safety.
People should not jog alone up in the
hills. It's just not a good idea, particularly
after dark," he said.
The most under-reported type of as
sault is acquaintance rape. A 1988 survey
of 1190 Stanford students by the Stan
ford Rape Education Project revealed
that 32 percent of women and 12 percent
of men at Stanford have been forced into
intercourse.
According to the survey, large numbers
of Stanford students are sexually coerced
by people they know. Of those coerced,
98 percent of the women and 94 percent
of the men knew their assailant. The
survey also revealed that only 2 percent
reported their experiences to the police
while only 4 percent received counseling.
Sexual assault is not confined to Stan
ford. According to a report published by
the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center
titled "What Can Colleges Do," sexual
assault is present on college campuses
nationwide.
Despite the pervasiveness of sexual as
sault on campuses, the authors of the
report, Aileen Adams and Gail Abarbanel,
are optimistic that the number of inci
dents on campus can be drastically
reduced. In a May 14 speech at Stanford,
Adams recommended that Stanford take
the following steps to reduce the fre
quency of sexual assaults and to educate
people about these issues.
She recommended the implementation
of massive educational programs about
rape on campus, including a mandatory
one-hour presentation during orientation
about sexual assault. Adams also pro
posed to revise the student conduct code
to specifically prohibit sexual assaults.
