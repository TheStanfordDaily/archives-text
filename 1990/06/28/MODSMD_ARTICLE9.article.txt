# Union workers fear job loss, protest layoffs slated for fall
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
On Friday, June 15, a group
of Tresidder Memorial Union
workers marched to Littlefield
Center where a Board of Trus
tees meeting was being held, and
openly protested the possible
layoff of eight Tresidder main
tenance crew members.
Linda Crouse, one of the
eight, said the noon rally was
"step one" in an effort to or
ganize University workers
against what she termed had
been "inept, wasteful manage
ment for the last ten years."
Crouse, former USW chief
steward, attributed the layoffs
to the ineptitude of Tresidder
directors who contract out the
work to outside corporations
and then "get locked into the
contraints" of these contracts.
In response, management has to
fire its own workers, which is
neither moral nor cost-effective,
Crouse explained.
"We want to know whose head
is going to roll when service
declines," she said.
Layoffs and contracting out
To the disbelief of custodians
in the Tresidder maintenance

crew, they
learned from the
June 1 Daily
that they will be
laid off in the
fall. Tresidder
Director Bobbi
Braden at that
time said eight
staff layoffs

would be made by reducing and
contracting out Tresidder cus
todial services.
Contracting out refers to the
process of hiring an outside
company to provide labor for
specialized tasks. Tresidder
occasionally uses the services of
Manpower, a local labor organ
ization, to help clean the build
ing, most recently during
Commencement.
The contracting out proposal
was made by a Tresidder plan
ning committee as part of a
campus-wide effort to cut the
University's operating budget by

$22 million. Each department
developed its own recommenda
tion of how to streamline and
consolidate its operations.
The custodians claim they
learned about the layoffs from
The Daily. However, Tresidder
Assoc. Director Paul Szczesiul
maintained the custodians
should have known about what
was being considered because
Crouse was part of the planning
committee.
Braden said the workers were
fully informed of their options,
including the right to take the
jobs of more recently hired
workers.
But Crouse said she never saw
the recommendations that the
committee proposed to former
Dean of Students Affairs James
Lyons, even though she sat on
the committee. Her protest
against the contracting plan,
which was "raised, proposed and
supported by [Tresidder Service
Manager] Jeanette Smith-
Laws," was to no avail, she
added.
Crouse said she opposed the
idea of contracting out during

the negotiations because she has
seen Tresidder "decline since the
management contracted out the
Coffee House and then the
Store." She said the contractors'
"over-projected revenues, over
estimated services and under
estimated prices" resulted in the
current financial crisis and
decline in customers.
Crouse explained there are
hidden costs to contracting out.
She said contractors use up
management time, take up
room-space and have free access
to University supplies — costs
which are hidden.
But Szczesiul said contracting
out will save over $100,000 in
Tresidder's operating budget.
He said all the bids from con
tractors have appraisals which
require fewer people in the
cleaning stafT. "They're expert
cleaning companies" that can be
trusted, he added.
Crouse, however, pointed out
what she sees as the dangers of
being locked in a bid. She said
contractors will often under-bid,

John Cuerva - Daily
Workers from Tresidder Memorial Union protest the upcoming
layoffs of several staff members. The termination of these jobs is
the result of a proposal — approved by the Board of Trustees in
May — which will allow Tresidder to contract out workers from
outside agencies.
but when they fail to make prof
its, they will either raise prices
or reduce services.
Crouse said there was no
mcyority support for the Tres
idder proposal. She said the
final recommendations were
made unilaterally by the man
agement.
The 1988 USW contract stip
ulates that if workers are laid
off because of contracting out,
"the University will provide by
contract that the contractor is
obligated to offer employment
at substantially equivalent
wages" to the laid-off workers.
Tresidder workers believe
Tresidder's multi-level manage
ment should be cut instead.
They claim that any Stanford
graduate who knows the school
will do as a supervisor. "What
do these outside [the current
management] people know?"
asked Paul Ortega, a thirty-year
veteran custodian.
Ortega and three other
workers currently work the
night shift, which begins at
10:30 pm. Charles Blunt, the
custodial supervisor, comes to
work early in the morning. "We
clean during the night and he
gets all the credit," remarked
Henry Battle, the head cus
todian.
"We know about the students.
We know how to treat the stu
dents. We don't need someone
to tell us," Battle said.
Tresidder management is
being consolidated, according to
Szczesiul. In addition to a 50
percent reduction of the ac
counting staff, there are other
major cuts throughout Tresid
der's operation, he said.
Earlier this year, the workers
made their own proposal to
streamline management by con
solidating two directorships.
"There will be far less disrup
tion or reduction in services
than laying off custodians,"
Crouse said.
The custodians' plan was
rejected by the committee,
Crouse said.
"We can't do much anymore.
We are getting old. It's up to
the students to fight. This is
the students' union," Ortega
said.
Szczesiul predicted that serv
ices in Tresidder will improve if
all the custodians work the
night shift, customarily called
the "graveyard" shift. Tresidder
can stay open longer at night,
and the dining area may be able
to serve students until midnight,
he said.
But workers and management

are still uncertain of the fate of
the Tresidder custodians.
Emery Teranishi, University
acting manager of employee re
lations, who is in charge of the
layoffs, said the proposal is still
being reviewed. He said he was
not certain when a final decision
would be made on the workers.
Eugene Alvarado, a custodian
who has served for 27 years,
said Smith-Laws called him and
other workers after the June 1
Daily article appeared to tell
them her plan had been ap
proved and Tresidder would
start contracting out in the fall.
In a June 11 letter to the
Stanford community, Provost
James Rosse announced that all
layoffs would be effective Sep
tember 1. According to the USW
contract, the union has to be
notified by the University 120
days before any layoff action re
sulting from contracting out.
Crouse said the union has re
ceived no formal notices.
The past and the future
The USW, officially known as
Local 680 of the Service Em
ployees International Union,
has been actively involved with
labor disputes at Stanford since
its inception.
The union was formed in 1974
to represent technical, service
and maintenance workers on
campus, at the Stanford Medical
Center and at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. At
present, the union represents
about 1,300 workers.
Since the union's formation,
the USW and the University
have weathered numerous
strike threats and representa
tion disputes. As University
President Donald Kennedy told
the Daily in October 1988, ten
sion builds up once every three
years during contract negotia
tions, and labor grievances are
not atypical.
Although new contract nego
tiations are not scheduled until
after the end of the 1990-91
school year, the union is already
planning activities to raise stu
dent awareness of the workers'
concerns. The recent layoff pro
posals and staff cuts in the past
year contributed to this activ
ism.
The union has been involved
in a number of labor disputes
with the University since the
beginning of the academic year.
In October, Tressider manage
ment, facing a $210,000 deficit,
decided to reduce a ten-member
custodial staff to seven. The po
sition of program coordinator
was also temporarily eliminated
and the job of marketing coor
dinator reduced by 60 percent.
Tensions heightened in April
when Vice President of Admin
istrative Resources Su Schaffer
fired Ralph Buchanan, director
of Operations and Maintenance,
over a personal disagreement on
whether Buchanan has the abil
ity to lead O & M through the
budget repositioning process.
This act greatly incensed the
USW, which viewed the firing
as an indication that O & M
will be contracting out more in
the future. The union is also
concerned that workers' voices
will not be heard anymore with
Buchanan's departure.
Buchanan was widely seen
among union members as being
sympathetic to labor issues, ac
cording to USW representative
Rodney Barnette.
In May, University Food Serv
ice laid off 21 temporary em
ployees, some of whom have
been in service for over three
years. Barnette told The Daily
last month those workers should
have been given permanent
status long ago, and that the
layoffs signaled some unhealthy
budgetary problems.
The labor struggle at Stanford
has been going on for 16 years,
and as we live out our years on
the Farm, the administration
labor saga continues.
