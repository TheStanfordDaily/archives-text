# Union workers fear job loss, protest layoffs slated for fall

### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
On Friday, June 15, a group
of Tresidder Memorial Union
workers marched to Littlefield
Center where a Board of Trus
tees meeting was being held, and
openly protested the possible
layoff of eight Tresidder main
tenance crew members.
Linda Crouse, one of the
eight, said the noon rally was
"step one" in an effort to or
ganize University workers
against what she termed had
been "inept, wasteful manage
ment for the last ten years."
Crouse, former USW chief
steward, attributed the layoffs
to the ineptitude of Tresidder
directors who contract out the
work to outside corporations
and then "get locked into the
contraints" of these contracts.
In response, management has to
fire its own workers, which is
neither moral nor cost-effective,
Crouse explained.
"We want to know whose head
is going to roll when service
declines," she said.
Layoffs and contracting out
To the disbelief of custodians
in the Tresidder maintenance

crew, they
learned from the
June 1 Daily
that they will be
laid off in the
fall. Tresidder
Director Bobbi
Braden at that
time said eight
staff layoffs

would be made by reducing and
contracting out Tresidder cus
todial services.
Contracting out refers to the
process of hiring an outside
company to provide labor for
specialized tasks. Tresidder
occasionally uses the services of
Manpower, a local labor organ
ization, to help clean the build
ing, most recently during
Commencement.
The contracting out proposal
was made by a Tresidder plan
ning committee as part of a
campus-wide effort to cut the
University's operating budget by

$22 million. Each department
developed its own recommenda
tion of how to streamline and
consolidate its operations.
The custodians claim they
learned about the layoffs from
The Daily. However, Tresidder
Assoc. Director Paul Szczesiul
maintained the custodians
should have known about what
was being considered because
Crouse was part of the planning
committee.
Braden said the workers were
fully informed of their options,
including the right to take the
jobs of more recently hired
workers.
But Crouse said she never saw
the recommendations that the
committee proposed to former
Dean of Students Affairs James
Lyons, even though she sat on
the committee. Her protest
against the contracting plan,
which was "raised, proposed and
supported by [Tresidder Service
Manager] Jeanette Smith-
Laws," was to no avail, she
added.
Crouse said she opposed the
idea of contracting out during

the negotiations because she has
seen Tresidder "decline since the
management contracted out the
Coffee House and then the
Store." She said the contractors'
"over-projected revenues, over
estimated services and under
estimated prices" resulted in the
current financial crisis and
decline in customers.
Crouse explained there are
hidden costs to contracting out.
She said contractors use up
management time, take up
room-space and have free access
to University supplies — costs
which are hidden.
But Szczesiul said contracting
out will save over $100,000 in
Tresidder's operating budget.
He said all the bids from con
tractors have appraisals which
require fewer people in the
cleaning stafT. "They're expert
cleaning companies" that can be
trusted, he added.
Crouse, however, pointed out
what she sees as the dangers of
being locked in a bid. She said
contractors will often under-bid,

John Cuerva - Daily
Workers from Tresidder Memorial Union protest the upcoming
layoffs of several staff members. The termination of these jobs is
the result of a proposal — approved by the Board of Trustees in
May — which will allow Tresidder to contract out workers from
outside agencies.
