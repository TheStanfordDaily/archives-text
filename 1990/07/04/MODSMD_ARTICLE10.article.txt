## Editorial Happy birthday 
### 
WHEN THE United
States was born 214
years ago, the nation
was like a special child. Born
out of the hearts and minds
of strong individuals who
were willing to fight for their
freedom, it was thought of as
a fresh beginning a new na
tion, where the seeds of hun
dreds of years of European
intellectualism and idealism
could be brought to bear fruit.
Looking back on our na
tion's 214 years, we can cel
ebrate its successes and look
with hope to the future, but
we must face the fact that
America was born with cer
tain birth defects.
For instance, our Founding
Fathers were not all fathers
and, after many years of
struggle, we can look back
and say that "all men were
created equal" really should
have been something like "all
individuals regardless of their
race, color, creed, gender or
sexual orientation were
created equal."
Over the past 214 years,
America has had to come to
grips with its birth defects
and problems that have
arisen over time or spiralled
outward from our founders'
original sins of omission. But
within a very limited scope,
we are a nation built on good
intentions. When applied
fairly to all, the principles of
freedom, tolerance and justice
which are among the cor
nerstones of this nation can
be fused together to create a
society.
On America's birthday it is
important to look back at all
the ground we have covered
as a nation and look ahead
to where we should be going.
The world is changing rapidly.
What role are we playing as
a nation? What role could we
be playing?
Our nation was founded on
ideas that, at the time, were

revolutionary, especially in
the Western tradition. Today,
our revolutionary heritage
has given way to a reaction
ary reality.
As we celebrate the United
States' birthday, we can look
ahead realistically to a future,
perhaps not in our lifetimes,
when the United States will
cease to be. Or cease to be
necessary.
A new world order is evolv
ing and the experiences of all
nations must be drawn upon
to help form the new inter
national community. As the
East/West conflict of
ideologies thaws, we cannot
afford to get caught up in the
excitement and exclude na
tions of the Southern hemi
sphere from the new world
order.
Many political theorists be
lieve that as the East/West
conflict diminishes, the
North/South conflict will in
tensify. But that does not
have to happen and it won't
happen if we widen the scope
of our vision today.
The world will not be able
to survive, on a grand scale,
convulsions that are similar
to those America has suffered
from its sins of omission.
Our leaders have to think
about the problems that could
happen, not just react to the
things that are going wrong.
As a nation in which much
ink is spilled over whether
people should be able to burn
the flag and much hot air is
spent expressing uptight con
cerns about where artists
should draw the line when it
comes to depicting the human
form, we should all chip in
to buy our leaders a birthday
present.
We should put it in a box
and wrap it up nicely — the
gift of a little common sense
and forethought. Then, if
they dare to open it, we'll see
what mischief it causes.
