Student unity
should be goal

When I look back over the
year it is easy for me to remem
ber the earthquake, the budget
cuts and the ASSU election. As
a freshman, I did not expect
these welcomes from the Farm.
Now that I review the year
in my head these three seem
insignificant compared to all
that I have learned in Otero
with my friends, in my classes
and on campus in general.
I address this letter to the
Stanford community as a whole
and not just to the Class of 1993.
There has been much talk about
uniting the campus, so much so
that I fear the word "unity" has
become a buzzword.
As a firm believer in unity at
Stanford, I don't want the con
cept to get lost in the clamor as
some might say happened to
multiculturalism.
As an ASSU senator and a
member of the Stanford Unity
Party, I want to explain what
unity can mean on this campus.

Unity can be the synthesis of
our diversity and community.
We need not sacrifice our in
dividualism, our culture or our
political views for unity to be
come a reality. What we must
do is unite behind a common
goal of uniting Stanford.
This goal is our common
ground. We can all strive to
make Stanford, as the Army
says, be all it can be.
I want to clarify that I don't
for one minute think that we
are all in agreement as to exactly
what way, shape and form a new
and improved Stanford should
take.
However, an integral part of
working toward that goal is lis
tening to each other and trying
to forge an atmosphere that is
most conducive to all.
I recognize that there are
many ways to forge unity at
Stanford. We should not neglect
any avenue because an improved
Stanford is in our own self
interest.
Thus, I urge the students to
take an active role in the ASSU.
Let the senate know how you
feel, but more importantly, get
involved with what matters to

you.
If you are dismayed, do some
thing constructive about it. If
you are content, help the ASSU
continue to serve you. Those of
you who are apathetic, I ask
that you give the ASSU a try.
Over the summer, think about
the role the ASSU should be
playing and then let the senate
know what constructive advice
you have for it. And in the fall,
please remember to judge the
members of the senate on their
merits and not on what past
senates have done.

Group provides
services for cats

The Stanford Cat Network—a
group of Stanford faculty, stu
dents, staff and community
members—was organized in
January 1989 to resolve the cat
overpopulation problem which
existed on campus.
Members of the network pres
ently care for over 200 cats, and

continue to trap, neuter, collar
and tag cats.
We would like to remind stu
dents who may be caring for
cats or other pets on campus of
their responsibilities and urge
them not to abandon their pets
when they leave campus.
Contrary to popular belief,
domesticated cats that are fed
regularly will generally not sur
vive on their own, and un
neutered animals contribute to
pet overpopulation.
If you would like more infor
mation on the network, please
contact the Palo Alto Humane
Society at 327-0631.
