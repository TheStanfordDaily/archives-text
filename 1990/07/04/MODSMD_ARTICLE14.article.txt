## Virility starts with Cosmopolitan 
### 
I have decided to become
virile.
You see, for far too long I
have tried to be a sensitive
man—or at least, I have been
trying to pass for sensitive when
often, in fact, I was simply being
meek and deferential.
All I know is that this summer
everything is going to change.
According to my present
timetable, by mid-September I
should be able to swagger up to
a woman and, with an Elvis-like
curl of the lip, induce swooning.
Or if not an actual swoon, then
perhaps, at least, sweaty palms.
The lip-curl/swagger method
would certainly be a shift away
from some of my former tech
niques of approaching women,
approaches that usually run
along the lines of leaving a paper
sack filled with homemade muf
fins outside of a woman's door,
and then running away.
Based on experience, I can tell
you that not even a crunchy nut
meg topping will induce swoon

ing.
This is where virility comes
in. Virility apparently does not
have much to do with baked
goods.
So I have forsaken the kitchen
to work on the lip-curl/swagger.
And while at this point, it's more
of a sneer/lurch, I still have a
couple of months to perfect it.
Meanwhile, I am also trying to
develop the proper accompany
ing attitude.
An important part of this
testosterone-charged mental
rigor has been a change in my
reading habits. I have started
with Cosmopolitan—a magazine
that may not exactly be virile,
but remember, I'm still a begin
ner at all this—and hope that
shortly I will be able to move
on to GQ and Sports Illustrated.
But even at this early stage,
I have already begun to reap
some unexpected benefits. For
instance, July's issue of Cos
mopolitan ran an article on the
"exciting career opportunities"

that one can find working in a
library.
Imagine! My summer job
("Student Assistant," Special
Collections Division, Cecil H.
Green Library), one which I had
feared would stand in the way
of my quest for virility, has sud
denly become glamorous and
(dare I say?) slightly sexy.
You see, what I found wedged
there between the horoscopes
and the sexual therapy column
was more than just occupational
advice. No, it was a page and a
half of media justification!
And the only place where I've
found muffin-baking is Better
Homes and Gardens.
Oops. I wasn't supposed to
mention that I read BH&G. Oh
dear. I guess I still have a long
way to go with this virility thing.
Sigh. If you'll excuse me, I think
I have to go work on my swag
ger.
