## Community should act to prevent sexual assault 
### 
The Stanford Foothills Freedom
March held Friday June 29 was
a demonstration of anger, com
passion and concern by the
members of our community who
have been incensed by a rapist's
attacks on women over the past
year.
The Freedom March was a
chance to fight back against the
outrage, but the struggle has
only begun.
The Freedom March was an
affirmation of the right of all
people to experience the ex
hilaration of the unspoiled
beauty of the Foothills, and to
go where they please without
intimidation. The breathtaking
views, the abundant wildlife and
the colorful landscapes are
treasures that will be denied to
no one.
A jaunt in the Foothills is a
chance for exercise, meditation
and escape from the stresses and
pressures of day-to-day life. The
march allowed people to assert
their rights to these simple
freedoms and pleasures.
For many who participated,
this walk/run through the Foot
hills was an important opportu
nity to express feelings of rage,
violation and frustration result

ing from the June 16 rape of a
woman at gunpoint near the
Dish. How easily it could have
been me, not her!
It was also a time to think
about the pervasive attitudes in
our society that perpetuate such
acts of violence against women.
Rape is the most unreported
crime in society today even
though one third of all women
will be raped during their
lifetimes.
Stanford students are partic
ularly reluctant to report rape
for many reasons. Perhaps a vic
tim's parents would make her
leave Stanford.
Perhaps there is pressure to
protect the University's idyllic
reputation or even the reputa
tion of the rapist. There is
definitely pressure to appear
perfect and invulnerable.
Finally, studies show that
female students tend to blame
themselves when adversity
strikes even when circumstances
are beyond their control. In con
trast, male students tend to
blame external forces when they
experience misfortune.
So even though five attacks
have been attributed to the rap
ist, there is a strong possibility

that more attacks have occurred
and gone unreported.
No one can judge a woman's
decision not to report a rape.
But we all have an obligation
to remove the barriers that
prevent her from doing so. As
more rapes are reported, the
possibility of eliminating the
crime increases.
Rape is difficult for most
people to talk about because the
subject can be embarrassing,
threatening and frightening.
The subject of rape strikes at
the place in our beings where
our worst nightmares lie.
For some of us, it tears at
unhealed emotional scars buried
deep in our psyches.
But when a rapist strikes so
close to home, we must steel
ourselves against our personal
discomfort and join together as
a community to eliminate the
atmosphere of repression and
fear created by his crimes.
This atmosphere damages
everyone's lives, not just the
lives of women. The recent
desecration of both the Foothills
and a woman's life hurts all to
whom freedom, beauty and
serenity are vital elements of
life.

We must join to
gether as a commu
nity to eliminate the
atmosphere of re
pression and fear

Remember these facts about
the assaults. They have oc
curred both during daylight and
after dark. The suspect carries
a knife or a gun. The police
suspect he is a local resident.
Now is the time to intensify
the effort to capture him.
First, make sure everyone you
know is aware of the rapist's
description. Post fliers with his
pictures throughout the
campus.
This not only informs people
and reduces their vulnerability,
but also increases the chances
that the rapist will be recognized
and apprehended.
Report any suspicious circum
stances to the Stanford Police
at 911 or 723-9633.
Secondly, be sensitive to
people's reluctance to admit vul
nerability. Don't wait to be

asked to escort a friend to her
destination. Show that you care
by offering your companionship
up front.
Plan ahead to reduce the risk
of attack. And although you
have every right to run or walk
alone, please choose not to.
Finally, work to increase rape
awareness in the community.
You could join SURE, the Rape
Education Project or you could
help me organize a rape infor
mation program for incoming
freshmen.
Alternatively, just discussing
the issues with your friends will
raise the level of community
awareness and drive out fear
and oppression.
As I ran by the Dish during
the Freedom March, I con
templated the incongruity be
tween the serenity of the setting
and the violence of the act that
occurred there just over two
weeks ago.
I applaud the spirit shown by
everyone who participated, and
thank each of you for your dem
onstration of caring and con
cern.
