## How to beat the summer blues 
### Sunil Perkash 
As summer progresses here in Palo
Alto, it is possible to experience some
degree of boredom. The most salient
symptom of this is when you look in the
paper and realize you have seen every
movie playing at Century 10.
An even greater indication that sum
mer boredom has risen to an almost un
bearable level occurs when you go to rent
a movie, and after four hours of walking
back and forth through the aisles of
Blockbuster Video, rent "Howard the
Duck," the only movie you and your
friends have not seen.
It is at this point that you should shut
off the TV, return all the rented movies,
and set forth into Palo Alto and the
surrounding Bay Area for some real sum
mer excitement.
One of the best ways to break the
daily routine is to go out to eat. Some
places to start with are the ever-popular
Stanford hangouts like Miyake (sushi)
and Compadres (Mexican food). Both are
loud, festive restaurants always over
flowing with Stanford students and local
high school kids competing for tables.
For a slightly different dining experi
ence, Max's Opera Cafe in the Stanford
Shopping Center presents singing waiters
and waitresses along with its menu high
lighted by its famous desserts. It is
definitely not the place for the dieter.
Gordon Biersch in downtowti Palo Alto,
with its overabundance of aspiring
yuppies, is known for its brewery beer,
which even non-beer drinkers might en
joy. Both of these places promise an up
beat environment for the relatively older
crowd.
The Stanford Pub is another place that

serves surprisingly good food. Known pri
marily to the Stanford community as a
place to party after most other places
have closed, "The Pub," with its big
screen TVs, loud music and better-than
average pizza, is a great place to unwind
after a hot summer day.
For the late-nighters, a good alterna
tive to the vinyl doldrums of Lyon's or
Denny's is Frankie, Johnny & Luigi Too
which is located in Mountain View. Open
until 1 a.m. Monday through Thursday,
2 a.m. Friday and Saturday, and mid
night on Sunday, this restaurant offers
some of the best Italian food around,
not to mention their mouth-watering piz
za.
For the weekends, a leisurely Sunday
brunch is always a good way to change
your pace of life. While everyone else
you know is waiting for a table at
Hobee's, why not try the all-you-can-eat
brunch at Pedro's? Their prices are rea
sonable and, due to the relaxed and
casual ambience, you do not need to limit
your visits to special occasions. Further
more, the buffet includes both traditional
Mexican and American favorites, making
Pedro's brunch a sure pleaser in a crowd
with diverse tastes.
If lunch has lost its flavor for you, a
visit to Royal Palace for Dim Sum could
be just the thing to bring it back. Dim
Sum is the Chinese equivalent to the
British tradition of tea. In the restaurant,
waiters push carts carrying a different
snack from table to table. You pick what
ever grabs your fancy, and everything is
priced reasonably.
The Perfect Recipe in the Stanford
Shopping Center is an excellent place to
stop by during the day for a cud of tea,
coffee and a pastry. Fashioned like a

British tea shop, its quaint atmosphere -
makes it a quiet place to relax and per
haps read a book or catch up with some
old friends.
Another place you can sit down and
enjoy some fresh brewed coffee and
bakery desserts is, surprisingly, at the
Century 10 Cinema in Mountain View.
Oflen, if you arrive at a theater too early,
you have to endure waiting in a lobby
or sitting in your seats. However, the
new coffeehouse inside the theater com
plex allows you to relax in a comfortable
setting with your friends, giving you an
incentive to arrive at the movie an hour
or so early and relax before the excite
ment.
For those with a little more time, pack
ing a picnic and going to the beach can
always be exciting. The Picnic Supplies
store in the Stanford Shopping Center
has a large assortment of various deli
goods perfect for a summer outing.
Whether you're looking for caviar or a
turkey sandwich, this is a place where
you will be sure to get whatever you
want.
Another fun summertime activity is
driving down to Carmel for the day. For
literally the cost of gas, the two hour
drive will take you to a place which re
sembles a small European town, right
on the beach. It gives you the feeling of
having travelled to a faraway place while
allowing you to return and go to work
the next day.
Also down south is the Monterey Bay
Aquarium. Even though the thought of

an aquarium might sound boring, this
really is an interesting experience and
worth investing a day of your summer.
In addition, the surrounding town of
Monterey has a unique coastal atmos
phere in which it is entertaining to shop
or just to walk around.
An attraction linking Monterey and
Carmel is the famous 17 mile drive,
which takes you from one town to the
other along a beautiful stretch of Cali
fornia coastline. Plan to see a sunset
there; it can be a sight of beauty.
For the more adventurous, there is
always Great America Amusement Park.
For some reason, people often forget that
when there is nothing to do on a weekend,
a day at Great America could be just the
right thing.
Or, if it is really hot outside, Raging
Waters' waterslides in San Jose will
definitely cool things off.
If animals are more your interest,
Marine World Africa USA in Vallejo is
worth the drive.
So during the summer days here in
Palo Alto, there really is no excuse for
being bored. With a little motivation
(motor transportation helps, too) to find
those off-campus places, your summer
experience at Stanford will be infinitely
more interesting and exciting.
