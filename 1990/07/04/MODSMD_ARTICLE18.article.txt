# Thai City offers the key to a new culinary fad

### Sunil Perkash 
There was probably a time when Chi
nese food was served in only a few places
in the area. Now, however, Palo Alto has
more Chinese restaurants than one can
count. And the same holds true for sushi.
Five years ago, who would have thought
that every vacant hole-in-the-wall would
be serving raw fish accompanied by rice
and seaweed? Now? Just take a look
around.
The latest entry into this ever
changing world of exotic foods is the
cuisine from Thailand.
Because Thai food is becoming an in
creasingly popular fad, giving spicy food
lovers a tasty alternative to Chinese and
Japanese food, it is no surprise that new
restaurants offering this cuisine are ap
pearing everywhere.
The most recent Thai restaurant to
open in Palo Alto is Thai City. Located

in the building that was previously China
Delight, this restaurant, with its reason
able prices and pleasant atmosphere, may
well become a popular hangout for mem
bers of the Stanford community.
As in a Chinese restaurant, the menu
is arranged by specific categories includ
ing an exotic selection of appetizers and
a large seafood section. And fortunately
for its patrons, the food descriptions
specify whether the dish is hot, medium
or mild.
We began our dinner with an order of
the Angel Chicken Wings, which are deep
fried boneless chicken wings stuffed with
ground seasoned pork, prawns, garlic and
pepper. These were so delicious that we
almost wanted to order more of them
and forego the rest of dinner.
However, we finally decided to branch
out and explore other items on the menu,
so we tried Tom Ka Kai which is a chicken
soup based on coconut milk. For our

main course, we shared an order of beef
with hot pepper, chicken with Thai basil
and Thai fried rice with prawns.
After we finished, we were hit by the
most noteworthy aspect of the meal —
we ordered, and subsequently ate, far
too much. Even though the portions ap
peared to be on the small side, the rich
ingredients used in Thai food filled our
stomachs quickly. This is almost a shame
because the food is such a refreshing
change from the ordinary that we wished
we could have eaten more.
However, financially speaking, this
serves to be an advantage for the budget
— conscious student. If two people, for
example, order an appetizer, a soup, a
main dish and fried rice, the entire bill
will be under $25.00 — not bad for a
restaurant of this caliber.
It should also be noted that the menu
does offer the option of adding $2.00 to
any of the main dishes to convert it into

a complete dinner, which includes soup,
salad, steamed Jasmine Rice and fresh
fruit. In this manner, a complete dinner
for one can be obtained for about $7.50,
well within the student budget.
Another nice touch this restaurant of
fers is the manner in which the food is
served. For example, the steamed rice is
brought to the table in a large silver
bowl, almost making you feel as if you
are being served in a royal court. The
overall atmosphere is pleasant and fresh
as well, making this a good restaurant
for almost any occasion.
Undoubtedly, this is not going to be
the last Thai restaurant to open in Palo
Alto. Thai food could well end up being
just another passing fad. Whether or not
it is here to stay, however, Thai City is
a nice place to get away from raw fish
and experience the latest trend in culi
nary culture.
