# 'Ghost Dad' â€” truly a scary film
## 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
There are at least three kinds
of comedies: the semi-realistic
human relationship kind, the
kind that is so stupid and un
believable that you love it, and
the kind which fails because of
pure pointlessness.
Imagine a movie which tries
to wade into each of the first
two categories but only makes
it knee- (or possibly ankle-) deep
and you will have discovered the
main problem with "Ghost
Dad."
This latest effort from Bill
Cosby tries to be both an en
dearing story of a father's rela
tionship with his children, and
a crazy, silly adventure on a su
pernatural scale. In the mean
time, it sinks into the depths of
that third category, the truly
stupid movie.
The film begins with Cosby,
a widower, working hard to get
a promotion that will secure
himself and his three children
in their yuppie lifestyle forever.
He is working so hard, in fact,
that he is too busy to spend
time with them. Plot Part I.
After avoiding several ridic
ulous deathtraps, (the pro
ducer's all-too-obvious attempt
at foreshadowing), Cosby
plunges over the side of a bridge
in a taxi on his way to secure

the deal which would insure his
promotion.
So, the Coz drowns. Well, at
least part of him does: enter Plot
Part 11. The rest of him, (not
quite alive, but not quite dead
either), emerges unscathed and
proceeds home to discover that
he is a ghost. His suspicions are
confirmed by a summons from
Sir Edith, the world-renowned
and more than slightly eccentric
British supernatural expert.
Back at home, Cosby, knowing
that he only has a short time
left on earth, continues to
pursue that promotion. His new
condition, however, presents
some new problems, the most
apparent of which is that he
can't be seen except in the dark.
The bulk of the plot is spent
showing how Cosby deals with
these "inconveniences": all the
typical Cosby stunts are there,
all the strange faces and noises.
But while they can be hilarious
at times, they can't carry a
feature-length film the way they
can a TV show, and Cosby is
given so much screentime that
any worthwhile performances
by the other actors and actresses
are overshadowed.
The result is disaster. Rela
tionships with his children
crumble, his budding romance
with his sexy next-door
neighbor fizzles, and of course,
the deal, the promotion, and his

job fall through.
But the real disaster is the
inane resolution of the plot it
self. Just when you've forgotten
about him, Sir Edith pops back
in to determine that Cosby's
state is genetic, and he is not a
ghost at all. Cosby is quickly
reunited with his body, the fam
ily is reunited, the lovers are
reunited, and the movie ending,
meant to be both heart
wrenching and hilarious, turns
out to be just plain sappy and
stupid.
There are a few enjoyable mo
ments in the film, times when
zaniness overrides the sentimen
tality that ruins the rest of the
movie. There is a psycho, devil
worshipping cab driver who
believes that Cosby is Satan, and
the trip to the doctor's office
where Cosby must convince the
physician that "everything is
perfectly normal."
These moments are few and
too far between, though. On the
whole, I'd say that "Ghost Dad"
is the clear "must-NOT-see"
movie of the summer.
