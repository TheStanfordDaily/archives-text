# 'Vendetta' depicts neo-Nazi England

### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
The Houses of Parliament
in Great Britain stand as a
symbol of democracy and
freedom for the Western
World. When these edifices
were nearly demolished by ex
plosives set by Guy Fawkes
in 1605, fierce British loyalty
fomented a Protestant con
demnation of this man and
of the Catholic conspiracy
which assaulted this proud
symbol of the freedom of the
nation.
In the graphic novel com
pilation "V for Vendetta,"
written by Alan Moore and
David Lloyd, both the Houses
of Parliament and Guy
Fawkes are important to the
path of British liberty; how
ever, their traditional roles

have been reversed.
Set in 1997 after a limited
nuclear war, "V for Vendetta"
describes a Britain radically
different from its contempo
rary democratic structure.
When the novel opens, the
chaos resulting from the war,
and the inability of the dem
ocratic government to main
tain order, has led to the rise
of a fascist ruling order.
This new totalitarian
regime quickly interns all
blacks, Jews, and Arabs into
"resettlement" camps justi
fied by the propaganda
"Strength through Purity,
Purity through Faith."
Hailing to the slogan
"England Prevails," the Or
wellian nation is now watched
by the übiquitous and omnis
cient branches of government re
sponsible for internal security
— the Eye, the Ear and the
Nose.
With the corrupt and brutal
strongarm branch, the Finger,
to enforce its rules, the Party
has has cowed society, which no
longer any desire to reinstate
its democratic traditions.
At least, not until V appears.
Dressed in a long black cape,
black top hat and white Guy

Fawkes mask (which resembles
a Greek comedy mask with its
permanent smile, rosy cheeks
and eye slits), V acts against the
fascist regime, blowing up the
Houses of Parliament in
defiance of the repression to
which England is subjected.
"V for Vendetta" combines
the best of graphic novel ele
ments: it has dark, intriguing
artwork; intelligent, flowing
dialogue; and a believable, grip
ping plot. Although it is some
what expensive ($14.95), "V for
Vendetta" would make an inter
esting, valuable contribution to
any thinker's library.
