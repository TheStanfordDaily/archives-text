# 'Die Hard 2' proves formulas work

Generally, sequels are disappointing.
Although many of us crave seeing the charac
ters we eryoyed in a good movie return for an
encore, we are often left unfulfilled because se
quels frequently lose the magic of innovation and
stick monotonously to whatever successful for
mula was established in the original.
"Die Hard 2: Die Harder" is no exception to
this rule. It relies upon everything that "Die
Hard" established several years ago. However,
"Die Harder" is by no means monotonous.
Bruce Willis is back as John McClane, the cop
who can't enjoy a Christmas. Bonnie Bedelia is
back as Mrs. McClane, and William Atherton
returns as the self-serving reporter who annoys
everyone.
Does it seem like an overwhelming coincidence
that all three of these people manage to work
their way back into a super-crisis situation?
Perhaps it is. The plot centers around John
McClane, who is waiting in Washington, D.C.'s
Dulles airport for a flight from Los Angeles.
Travelling aboard this flight are his wife and,
coincidentally, the irritating reporter.
What is gradually revealed to the audience,
and to the people in the airport, is that a crack
military unit fanatically devoted to General
Esperanza, a drug lord/dictator, has taken over
the airport. Knowing that Esperanza is being
extradited to Dulles, the commandos shut down
all airport operations, forcing the planes to circle

overhead until the General lands.
Naturally inclined to break up such plots,
McClane is given an extra incentive when he
realizes that his wife's plane will be crashing in
a little under two hours. Thus, the one man
anti-terrorist squad is back in action.
And what action this movie has! I was skeptical
of it being able to compare to the action-packed
sequences of the first, but all my doubts were
dispersed. This film is virtually non-stop excite
ment. If you can suspend your disbelief about
the characters involved and McClane's incredible
capacity for survival, you will enjoy the fast-paced
excitement immensely.
Fortunately, the movie provides the viewer with
the means to ignore the unbelievable odds and
just eryoy the flick. McClane lightens the film
with utterances such as "how could this happen
to the same guy twice?" These and other incidents
where McClane throws out some humorous one
liners show that the movie does not take itself
too seriously and is made for pure viewing sat
isfaction alone.
Overall, "Die Hard 2: Die Harder" was much
better than I thought it would be. Although
relying basically on the formula established in
the first movie, "Die Harder" has captured the
essence of the former's success and utilized it to
make the sequel at least equal to its predecessor.
Graphically violent at times, the movie is not for
the faint-hearted and does not contain a moral
message about the use of violence. Still, "Die
Hard 2" is a rollicking good time, full of surprises
and breathtaking action.
