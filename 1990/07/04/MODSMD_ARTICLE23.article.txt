# Racing footage keeps 'Days of Thunder' from crashing
## 
### William Thomas 
"Days of Thunder" might just get you
cheering and applauding and gasping
within five minutes — the movie lives
and dies with racing footage.
This makes sense when you keep in
mind that we have all experienced the
Tom Cruise formula before — a strong
male (Cole Trickle) becomes involved in
a trying situation, flexes his cheekbones
in dismay, and then overcomes huge per
sonal obstacles.
Relying heavily on the Tom Cruise tra
dition and image, this movie provides
the viewers with just enough substance
to cause the audience to feel that it has
something invested in the action.
Cruise's career overall has been an at
tempt to portray the stubborn, narrow
pride of the American male again and
again.
"Days of Thunder" furthers this series
of portrayals, studying the deficiencies
that such male pride obscures. Cruise
plays a talented young stock-car driver
attempting to prove his abilities.
The movie relies upon this to motivate
all the human relationships. Unfortu
nately, this means that relationships are
portrayed in various little quick resolu
tions that lack supporting matter. It is
as if while all the bitchin' race footage

is commanding attention, the characters
are elsewhere building the close relation
ships that underpin the movie.
For example, Cole Trickle turns his
greatest rival, Rowdy Bums (Michael
Rooker), into his best friend over the
course of a racing scene between the two
in rental cars. He is seduced by the beau
tiful and alluring Dr. Claire Lewicki
(Nicole Kidman) after a medical exam
ination. The triangle of Coie, Tim Daland
(Randy Quaid), and Harry Hogge (Robert
Duvall) is full of supposedly powerful,
meaningful events that never become
clear to the audience.
Although many of the interesting
human elements go unexplained, viewers
are willing to take much of this on faith,
mostly because these relationships are
punctuated by the racing footage.
The racing scenes are enthralling, grab
bing the viewer and not letting go. Since
they have to carry the movie, it is for
tunate that they are of such high quality.
Despite Dr. Lewicki's admonition that
stock-car racing is for infantile egoman
iacs, the rush this activity provides, even
on screen, is worth putting up with in
adequate character development.
Basically, it is worth your time to go
and see this movie, even if you can't
have those cute little dimples that Tom
displays so well.

Robert Duvall plays mechanic to Tom Cruise's race car driver in "Days of Thunder."
The film has a similar formula to that of many of Cruise's other movies, but
nevertheless succeeds in capturing the audience's attention — thanks mostly to the
racing footage.
