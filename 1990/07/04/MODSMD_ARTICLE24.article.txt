## Wheaton, Fendick lose in fourth round Graf upends Capriati 6-2, 6-4 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
Jennifer Capriati felt the
power of The Forehand, faced
The Serve without flinching,
and learned how far she must
go to beat Steffi Graf.
The surprising answer: Not
very far.
Capriati, 14 years old and to
tally unfazed by pressure — "It
was great. .. . Even Princess
Fergie came" — won the
opening point Monday against
Graf in their first clash on Wim
bledon's Centre Court.
It was a magical moment in
tennis history, a rapid-fire ex
change of more than a dozen
shots between the game's latest
prodigy and the two-time
champ, each chasing balls from
corner to corner until Graf fi
nally yielded with a forehand
too long.
Legends are made of such
stuff and heroines are created.
"Little Mo," Maureen Connolly,
was one of those, bouncing in
from California in 1952 to cap
ture hearts and a championship
in her Wimbledon debut.
But Graf was not about to let
Capriati dictate the ending of
this tale. Graf ripped a cross
court forehand to take the next
point, won the game on a
double-fault and two errors by
the nervous teen-ager — "I was
kind of hyper before the match
because I was so excited,"
Capriati said — and marched
defiantly into the quarterfinals
with a 6-2, 6-4 victory.

Graf, playing after a weekend
trip home to West Germany to
treat a sinus problem that will
require surgery later this year,
left the court impressed by
Capriati's strength, serve and
steadiness.
Capriati, buoyant in defeat as
she was in victory, sounded as
if she survived a shootout and
loved every minute of it.
"I finally got to hit against
her forehand. Now I know why
they call it The Forehand,"
Capriati said, her eyes wide in
amazement. "It was just a bul
let. And she moves so quick.
There was always another ball
that came back. She almost aced
me two times a game. I thought
(her serve) was a great weapon.
I couldn't break her. If I could
have broken once, maybe it
would have been different. But
it was just too explosive — I
mean, powerful."
While Capriati and Graf were
stealing all the headlines at
Wimbledon, a pair of up-and
coming Americans quietly made
their presence felt. Patty Fen
dick, class of 1987, and David
Wheaton, who left after the
1988 season, both reached the
round of 16 before falling.
Fendick easily defeated Susan
Sloane 6-2, 6-4 and Angelica
Gavaldon 6-1, 6-1 to reach the
fourth round. But 13th-seeded
Jana Novatna was too much for
her there, posting a 6-2, 6-4 win.
Wheaton took his time along
the way. He defeated Paul An
nacone 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 6-7 (3-7),
6-4 before upsetting lOth-seeded
Jonas B. Svensson 2-6, 6-7 (6-8),

6-1, 6-0, 6-4. In the fourth
round, however, his fifth-set
magic ran out in a 6-7 (8-10),
3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 13-11 loss to
seventh-seeded Brad Gilbert.
In other singles results from
the last week, Dan Goldie beat
Ken Flach before losing to Boris
Becker in a tough four-setter;
Derrick Rostagno beat Jeremy
Bates then lost to Goran

Ivanisevic; and Jim Grabb took
out Paul Chamberlain in a five
setter before falling to Christian
Bergstrom.
On the women'b side, Fendick
was the only former Stanford
player remaining after last
Wedenesday, when Tami Whit
linger lost to Joanne Faull and
Meredith McGrath fell 6-3, 6-0
to Graf.

In doubles, the lOth-seeded
tandem of Grabb and McEnroe
reached the third round before
losing to No. 8 Flach and Robert
Seguso. Fendick and Zina Gar
rison, the 10th seeds, are into
the fourth round, however, and
McEnroe and McGrath defeated
Lan Bale and Jane Thomas 6-3,
7-5 in the first round of the
mixed doubles.
