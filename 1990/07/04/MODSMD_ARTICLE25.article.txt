# Yankee outfielders commit a no-no

When he went out to the mound Sunday
for the New York Yankees, Andy Hawkins
decided to be a copy-cat. After watching
both Dave Stewart and Fernando Valen
zuela pitch no-hitters two days earlier, Haw
kins followed suit.
It's just too bad his teammates forgot to
help out.
Hawkins became only the second player
in mtyor league history to pitch a complete
game no-hitter and lose.
After getting out 23 White Sox without
giving up a hit, Sammy Sosa got onboard
thanks to an error by third baseman Mike

Blowers. Hawkins, who is now 1-5 on the
year, then got himself in trouble by walking
Ozzie Guillen and Lance Johnson to load
the bases.
Left fielder Jim Leyritz then dropped
Robin Ventura's fly ball and three runs
scored. Right fielder Jesse Barfield then
dropped an Ivan Calderon fly ball to allow
Ventura to score.
The Yankees, who are the imyors' worst
team at 28-45, managed only four hits them
selves in the loss.
"You dream about pitching a no-hitter,"
Hawkins said. "You think about your team
mates charging out to you and partying
after the game." But it was the White Sox
who were partying.
Stewart opened this crazy weekend by

no-hitting Toronto Friday night. The A's
ace had lost five of his last six decisions
going into the game and was excited to
right himself.
In Los Angeles, Valenzuela finished up
his first-ever no-no a couple of hours after
Stewart, a former teammate with the
Dodgers, hurled his first-ever. Each walked
three and Stewart struck out 12 while
Valenzuela fanned seven.
Coincidentally, Valenzuela had also lost
five of his last six starts.
The gems by Stewart and Valenzuela
brought the total of no-hitters
in June to four, an all-time record. There
have been six no-nos already this year in
the mtyors, one short of the record, and it
isn't even the all-star break.
