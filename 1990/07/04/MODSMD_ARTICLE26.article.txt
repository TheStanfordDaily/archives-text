# Milla magic runs out against England
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
It is only so far that a 38-year-old man
can carry an entire nation on his back.
Cameroon found out just how far by be
coming the first African country to reach
the quarterfinals of the World Cup. The
team nearly advanced to the semifinals Sun
day, but finally their Milla Magic wore out.
Roger Milla, a 38-year-old striker who
came out of retirement for the World Cup
after a personal plea from the President of
Cameroon, had become the folk hero of the
world's greatest sporting event by scoring
four goals to lead his team to the third
round. There, facing a superior English
team, the Indomitable Lions' luck was sup
posed to run out.
Despite having Milla set up two goals in
a span of four minutes, and despite actually
outplaying the English, Cameroon's remark
able run finally came to an end, 3-2 in
overtime.
England will meet favorite West Germany
in one semifinal while host Italy will play
defending champion Argentina in the other
semifinal.

The England-Cameroon game drew the
most world wide attention before the game,
both because of the Cinderella story
Cameroon was living out and because of
the English hooligans. But Sunday there
was no hooliganism and the African upstarts
played like anything but underdogs.
Cameroon had the better of the play
throughout the game, but English
goalkeeper Peter Shilton, who, at 40, is the
only player older than Milla in the Cup this
year, kept the game even.
England took the lead later in the first
half on a perfect header, then played a
defensive game, content to post a 1-0 win.
But Milla had other ideas. After coming
in as a substitute at halftime, he picked up
the pace for Cameroon immediately. He took
a fine through ball and was tripped in the
English penalty box. Emmanuel Kunde
made the penalty kick to tie it up.
Three minutes later Milla hit a perfect
pass to Eugene Ekeke, who beat Shilton to
make it 2-1. But the English attack finally
got going. Paul Gascoigne took a ball from
Gary Lineker and was fouled in the penalty
box. Lineker, the leading scorer in the 1986
World Cup, converted the penalty to tie it

up.
Both teams continued to attack, but no
one scored in the final seven minutes. In
overtime, Lineker got pulled down in the
box after a pass from Gascoigne, and the
English had another penalty kick. Lineker
converted again and 17 minutes later the
English were through to the semis.
There they will meet the Germans, who
totally outplayed Czechoslovakia but won
only 1-0.
The other semifinal appears to be as much
of a mismatch. Italy has not allowed a goal
in 450 minutes of play in the tournament
and Salvatore Schillaci has come out of
nowhere to become a national hero.
Italy will be facing Argentina, the least
impressive of the four teams remaining.
With star forward Diego Maradona suffer
ing from injury and constant attention from
two and three defenders, Argentina has been
outplayed in both of its elimination games.
But against Brazil, Maradona drew four
defenders to him and found an open Claudio
Caniggia for the sole goal in a 1-0 win.
Saturday they were outplayed by Yugos
lavia, but came back to win on penalty
kicks.
