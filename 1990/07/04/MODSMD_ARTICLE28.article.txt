Take back the Dish
Forty women and men march through the Foothills where a woman was raped Commencement
Weekend. Held last Friday, the Freedom March brought together concerned members of the
community who protested the growing violence in an area long cherished as a favorite jogging
spot. One of the marchers remarked, "There's a sanctuary synonymous with being a student,
and It's been violated." Police are continuing the search for the rapist and are analyzing material
collected from the scene. They are currently pursuing several leads, but are encouraging people
to call In with Information at 723-9633.
