Three of the recipients of the

Davis was selected by the
Stanford Black Alumni Club to

such community arts programs.
"Theater is an important polit

role in society, as well as being
a lot of fun," he said.
Davis said he will focus his
attention at the theater project
on community outreach and will

also assist in directing the mu

system of lay advocates among
the residents.
