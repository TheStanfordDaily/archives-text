# Mandela urges continued economic sanctions
## University divestment from corporations to continue on case-by-case basis 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
Thousands cheered for Nelson Man
dela when he spoke last weekend at the
Oakland Coliseum. But despite the South
African hero's inspiring plea for wide
spread economic sanctions, the Univer
sity has no intention of changing its cur
rent case-by-case divestment policy.

Stanford maintains investments only
in companies that take a public stance
against apartheid. According to a reso
lution passed by the Board of Trustees
last year, corporations must engage in
anti-apartheid activities ranging from
discontinuing sales used to support
apartheid to offering legal assistance to
South African employees under political
arrest and providing financial support
for their families.
The board plans to continue its selec
tive divestment policy until apartheid has
ended, said Gary Malone, director of the
Commission on Investment Responsibil
ity.
The commission, made up of students,
faculty, staff and alumni, monitors and
evaluates the performance of portfolio
companies and presents its recommen
dations for policy and action to the Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsi
bility, an arm of the board charged with
examining a variety of investment
related issues.
The commission was formed in 1971
by the University as an advisory to the
Board of Trustees. The trustees created
the special committee in 1977.
Malone argued that Stanford's current
policy encourages the presence of pro
gressive firms. "It's a good policy because
those are the firms you want around in
a post-apartheid South Africa," he said.
But the University's willingness to
divide firms into good and bad camps
contrasts sharply with Mandela's demand
for unilateral disinvestment, or compan
ies pulling out of South Africa.
Mandela claimed that democracy and
freedom for all races in South Africa
would come about only through the con
tinued pressure caused by widespread
economic sanctions against the South
African government.
Mandela specifically commended stu
dents at UC-Berkeley and the University
of California regents for leading the di

vestment drive, but omitted Stanford
from his thank-you list.
"It is you, the people of Oakland, the
people of the Bay Area, who have given
me and my organization the strength
and hope to continue the struggle," Man
dela told the crowd on Saturday.
"On behalf of the the African National
Congress and its entire membership, we
thank you for your solidarity," he said.
"It is a great honor for us because in
fact it is a tribute to the fighting spirit
of our people."
According to Operations Research
Prof. Frederick Hillier, former chair of
the commission, the trustees tend to
draw their conclusions based on input
from many sources.
"I hope they will take Nelson Man
dela's view into account," said Hillier,
who is a supporter of total divestment.
But he added, "I don't think they'll be
making a decision based solely on his
views."
Even if the trustees were to consider
Mandela's recommendations, it is un
likely any action would be taken before
fall quarter, since the trustees and the
commission have no scheduled meetings
over the summer.
By then, Hillier predicted, the issue of
divestment could become outdated by the
rapid pace of events.
"With events occurring so rapidly in
South Africa, I am optimistic that the
ANC and other black groups will move
into negotiations with the government,"
Hillier said.
Despite rumors that the strain of the
trip was draining for the 71-year-old
Mandela, the South African leader said
he planned to return to the United States
next fall.
"I feel like a young man of 35," he
said. "I feel like an old battery that has
been recharged . . . and it is the people
