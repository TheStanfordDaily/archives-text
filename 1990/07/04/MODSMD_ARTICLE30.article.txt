# Hoover hosts Israeli conference
## Major political and economic reforms needed to rectify instability 
### Jessica Tan 
The Israeli government must initiate mqjor
political and economic reforms to rectify Israel's
political instability and to prevent a crisis which
could endanger the nation's existence, a panel of
experts concluded at a Hoover Institution con
ference on Israeli democracy.
However, the 45 participants in last weekend's
conference, "Israeli Democracy Under Stress,"
could not agree on which specific reforms ought
to be instituted.
Ephraim Kleiman, from the Hebrew University
in Jerusalem, discussed his paper, "The Political
Economy of Israel: Statism at the Crossroads,"
which outlined the impact of Israel's economy on
its government. He argued that there is too much
governmental intervention in Israeli life, and this
has led to manipulation by government officials
who wish to achieve political goals.
However, his proposal to implement a free
market economy encountered criticism. Oppo
nents reasoned that the government could not
cease providing aid while a growing number of
immigrants to Israel needs housing and jobs.
A paper titled "Electoral System, Government,
and Democracy," written by Israeli political scien
tist Vernon Bogdonor, who was not at the con
ference, was the center of numerous debates about
the Israeli election system and government.
Supporters of Bogdonor asserted that the pres
ent Israeli electoral college forces voters toward

extremes. They called for direct prime minister
elections which would force the parties to present
more moderate candidates who would appeal to
the majority of the public. Opponents to Bog
donor's paper disagreed, expressing fear that
direct elections would usurp too much power
from the parties.
All participants were concerned about the cur
rent stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
Former U.S. Secretary of State and Business
Prof. George Shultz pointed out an imminent
danger of the stalemate: the loss of Egyptian
support for Israel.
If Israel continues to appear unwilling to
cooperate, Egypt may adopt a strong anti-Israel
sentiment against which Israel would probably
be unable to defend itself, according to Shultz.
With the recent disintegration of Israel's coa
lition government, the conference aimed to "probe
the root causes of the stresses Israeli democracy
is experiencing today and develop a set of pro
posals for reform and improvement of Israel's
democratic institutions," stated conference coor
dinator Larry Diamond, a senior research fellow
at Hoover.
While no agreements were made on specific
proposals, the general consensus at the conference
was to adopt more moderate solutions rather
than one of the two extreme positions represented
by the dominant parties in Israel.
The conference was cosponsored by Hoover and
the Israel-Diaspora Institute in Tel Aviv.
