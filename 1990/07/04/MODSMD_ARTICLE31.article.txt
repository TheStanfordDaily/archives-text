Much of the success of Stan
ford's African and Afro-
American Studies program can
be attributed to its founding di
rector, the late St. Clair Drake.
Drake's contributions as a
leading African-American
scholar went beyond his career
as professor of anthropology and
sociology at Stanford. His two
mqjor areas of interest were the
discourse between African and
American culture and the study
of race relations in the United
States.
Drake, whose full name was
John Gibbs St. Clair Drake, died
June 14 at his Palo Alto home.
He was 79.
Drake was appointed to head
the program in 1969, after
James Gibbs, then chair of the
Anthropology Department, se
cured $100,000 to create an in
terdepartmental African and
Afro-American Studies pro
gram. It was the first program
of its kind in the United States
at a large private university.
Former Afro-American
Studies Chair Kennell Jackson
called Drake the single most
knowledgeable scholar on black
studies, emphasizing the fact
that Drake was extremely
learned about black culture in
America, Africa, Asia, Australia
and Europe.
"There are others who are
really knowledgeable in one spe
cific area, but I do not think

there is anyone else who knows
as much about black culture as
Drake," Jackson said. "He was
a living encyclopedia."
Senior Dereca Blackmon, a
former Black Student Union of
ficer who is researching the
African origins of Greek
thought, praised Drake for
having done some of the most
substantial work in that area.
She believes his writings should
be taught on a more widespread
basis.
"There are huge contributions
that Africans gave to Western
society," Blackmon said. "When
his works can be instituted in
our core curriculum, his
struggles will be realized."
Sandra Drake, his daughter
and an assistant professor of
English, said Drake will leave a
legacy as "a committed activist
and a committed public educa
tor, inside and outside of
academia."
From a scholarly viewpoint,
she said that he will probably
be best remembered for his early
works, "Black Metropolis" and
"Black Folk Here and There,"
completed shortly before his
death.
Drake also published numer
ous articles, including "The
Black University in the Ameri
can Social Order," "Race Rela
tions in a Time of Rapid
Change," "The American Dream
and the Negro: 100 Years of
Freedom?" and a chapter in the
book "Negro Americans."
