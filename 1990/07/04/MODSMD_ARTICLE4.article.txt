# Public service pays for students of law
## 
### Wendy Bjerknes 
For law students who value
doing good more than doing
well, the Law School has some
welcome news: there's a
chance your financial
sacrifice could be less painful.
The school has instituted a
new Public Interest Fellow
ship for second- and third
year students who plan to
enter into public service
careers. Six lucky students
will receive full-tuition fellow
ships for the upcoming school
year through the program.
Students interested in
public service, such as legal
service to the poor, govern
ment service or work for non
profit organizations, were
previously discouraged be
cause of the Law School's
high tuition — currently
$14,168 a year — and the
relatively low pay of public
service careers, especially
when compared to the
salaries of private sector jobs
with law firms and corpora
tions.
The fellowships will be
awarded on the basis of "the
students' demonstrated com
mitment to public service,
their intention to seek per
manent employment in public
service and academic achieve
ment in their first year of law
studies," according to an an
nouncement released by Paul
Brest, dean of the Law
School.
Students receiving the fel
lowships are expected "to
pursue a curriculum that in
cludes a significant compo

nent of public interest law
courses, to spend at least one
summer working in public
service, and to plan to make
their careers in public serv
ice," the announcement said.
In addition to the new pro
gram, the law school has
other funding efforts to
reduce the economic barriers
encountered by students. The
main difference between the
existing programs and the
newly instituted fellowship is
the amount and kind of as
sistance — full tuition grants
in place of limited grants or
forgiven loans.
Even though the fellowship
is limited to six students,
Frank Brucato, manager of
financial services for the Law
School, emphasized that "the
Law School actively encour
ages all its students, even
those who enter the private
sector, to make public service
an integral part of their
careers."
Other Law School pro
grams to encourage and
reward public service include:
• The Public Interest Low
Income Protection Plan,
which has existed for five
years and has 26 participants.
• The Montgomery Sum
mer Public Interest Grant
Program.
• The Stanford Public In
terest Law Foundation, an in
dependent organization of
students and alumni that
raises money from several
sources for a variety of activ
ities. The foundation gives 10
students summer grants for
their services.
