# Excerpts from Oakland speech
## 
### 
On my release from, jail last Feb
ruary 11, we walked out of the
prison gate to a tumultuous and
joyous welcome. Our people in their
multitudes had come from all cor
ners of South Africa to receive us
back into our ways of struggle. The
heavens rained with their chants of
joy.
But we still have a long road to
travel before reaching our destina
tion: freedom. As long as apartheid
is in place, we appeal to you to
maintain sanctions. That is a cer
tain way to reach our objective. We
must keep the pressure on apartheid
until victory is achieved.
I can assure the leaders of the
Indian community that I will return
in October. With the permission of
my organization, which I am sure
I will get, I will visit the Indian
community. We will exchange views
as to what I can do to help them
in their struggle.
Let me assure you that, despite
my 71 years, at the end of this visit
I feel like a young man of 35. I feel
like an old battery that has been
recharged. And, if I feel so young,
if 1 feel like an old battery that has
been recharged, it is the people of
the United States of America that
are responsible for this. It is you,
the people of Oakland, the people
of the Bay Area, who have given
me and my delegation strength and
hope to go back and continue the
struggle.
