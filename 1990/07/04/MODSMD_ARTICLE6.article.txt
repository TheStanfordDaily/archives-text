# Med School gains top scientists
## Cardiologist and geneticist named new department heads 
### Ram Duriseti 
Two prestigious doctors will join Stanford Med
ical School this summer as the chairs of the
Departments of Genetics and Cardiology.
Victor Dzau, who chairs the Cardiology Depart
ment as of July 1, is a native of Shanghai. He
received his M.D. from McGill University in
Canada, and has served on the faculty of Harvard
Medical School since 1984. Dzau was also named
the William G. Irwin professor of cardiology, an
endowed professorship.
Dzau, a prominent medical scientist, is noted
for his research in vascular medicine and car
diology. His work has helped to successfully bridge
the gap between clinical medicine and fundamen
tal biological research.
Cardiology is one of the largest departments
of the Medical School, with an annual research
budget of $6.4 million and 5,800 outpatient clini
cal visits per year.
David Botstein, who will head the Department
of Genetics beginning August 1, is a native of
Switzerland and received his Ph.D. in 1967 from
the University of Michigan. For 10 years, he was
a professor of genetics in the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology's Department of Biology.
In 1988 Botstein left MIT to serve as the acting
vice-president of science at Genentech Inc. of
South San Francisco. His return from industry
to academics is relatively rare, according to the
Medical Center News Bureau.
Botstein is internationally recognized for his
support of the national effort to map the entire
human genome. He is credited with developing
and pioneering the technique of restriction frag
ment length polymorphisms.
This technique subjects the genome of a given
population to a series of enzymatic digestions to
isolate a fragment. This fragment contains the
gene or genes that probably produce the proteins
which are responsible for a targeted trait.
This strategy will be integral to the isolation
of genes for not only every genetically determined
human trait, but also for every human malady
with a genetic basis — the ultimate goal of the
massive effort to map the entire human genome.
The human genome project has come under
heavy criticism on financial and ethical fronts.
Projected government spending for the project
will run upwards of $3 billion over 15 years.

Specifically, the plan calls for $200
million per year with a steady in
crease in successive years.
Many researchers, in industry
as well as academia, feel this huge
concentration of grant money into
one effort detracts from other
highly relevant and pressing re
search. Some of these critics argue
that the human genome will be

pieced together as the results of various projects
are synthesized.
But proponents of the genome project do not
believe the process can be completed without a
centralized and directed effort. According to
Botstein, "The technology required for a real
assault on the undertaking will not exist unless
we expressly create it for the purpose, and this
requires a lot of funding."
Although Botstein has not been an uncritical
supporter of the project, he said "the amount of
resources allocated to the project is appropriate
and represents a reasonable compromise" between
the proponents and opponents of the project.
Botstein pointed out that the money being
allocated for the genome project is above and
beyond current National Institutes of Health
funding. The primary fear is that if Congress
repealed the additional funding and the project
continued, it would cut into NlH's limited re
sources.
On the ethical front, opponents of the project
fear that such gene-by-gene assignment of human
traits may strengthen prevalent public miscon
ceptions of genetics and genetic effects on people's
individuality.
The popular — and incorrect — conception is
that a genetic basis for a trait implies inevitability
rather than potentiality. Critics fear that such a
genetic assignment of all traits may provide ide
ological ammunition for researchers pushing ge
netic inevitability and their own agendas,
including arguments that endorse racial superi
ority.
Proponents of the project usually respond by
stating that the benefits far outweigh the costs
in terms of locating and resolving the genes for
certain human diseases. According to these sup
porters, ideologies on both sides will always exist
and will push their agendas with or without the
project.
