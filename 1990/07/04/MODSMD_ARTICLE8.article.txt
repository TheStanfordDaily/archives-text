# Lesbian psychologist will counsel at CAPS
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Editorial staff 
Counseling and Psychological
Services has hired the author of
a recently released lesbian needs
assessment to follow through
with the study's recommenda
tions, according to Doug Daher,
acting director of CAPS.
Psychologist Trudie Heming,
who is openly lesbian, will work
at CAPS two days a week be
ginning Sept. 15. Her position
will parallel that of Carlos
Greaves, a CAPS psychiatrist
who primarily serves Stanford's

gay male community.
The position, which will last
for at least one year, was made
possible by the retirement of
Charlotte Siegel, a CAPS social
worker. The CAPS staff decided
to split the hours between a re
placement social worker and a
lesbian therapist, in response to
the needs assessment.
Fleming's time will be divided
between direct patient care and
training graduate students in
clinical psychiatry who wish to
specialize in issues of sexual ori
entation, Daher said. The exact
division of time has not yet been
decided.
She also plans to launch an
outreach program, working
closely with students and faculty
who are likely to encounter stu
dents who could use her serv
ices.
As a lesbian counselor, she
hopes to provide "an important
role model that has been missing
in the isolation that these
women are facing," Heming
said. "It is hard to make a de
cision if you cannot see all the
options working."

Debbie Jue, an officer of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center and a 1988 grad
uate, hailed the decision as an
important step in meeting the
needs of lesbian and bisexual
women on campus.
Fleming led a CAPS support
group from January 1987 to
June 1989 for lesbians, bisexual
women and women exploring
their sexual identity. She has
been a consultant for CAPS for
the past two years, and has
worked in a gay counseling pro
gram at UC-Berkeley.
"It has taken us a while, but
we are very committed to pro
viding this service," Daher said.
