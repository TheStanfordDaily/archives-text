# Former dean reflects on career
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Editorial staff 
When Jim Lyons came to
Stanford, Flo Mo was on stilts,
Res Ed did not exist and the
Stanford Powwow was only a
small event.
During his 18 years as dean
of student affairs, Lyons over
saw the filling-ir. of Florence
Moore Hall's first floor, creat
ing more than 100 student
rooms. Designed as a women's
dorm, Flo Mo originally was
built on stilts to discourage
window peepers.
He also coined the term Res
idential Education, now a Uni
versity institution and a model
for schools nationwide. And he
watched the annual Powwow
grow into the West Coast's lar
gest Native American gather
ing.
These are but a few of the
changes in student life that
Lyons, who announced his re
tirement last summer, experi
enced during his tenure as
dean.
Lyons said he believes con
stant innovation and revision
of existing structures are the
University's greatest
strengths. "Stanford is not a
place that rests comfortably on
its laurels," he said.
An encouraging trend Lyons
has seen in recent years is a
"resurgence of interest" in
public service and volunteer
ing, he said. In 1981, he
created the Dean's Award for
Service, which this year was
renamed the James W. Lyons
Award for Service.
As head of the University
department with the most
direct contact with students,
Lyons sees the role of dean of
student affairs as that of an
educator rather than an ad
ministrator. His administra
tive philosophy is one of
"simple caring, the mark of a
good human community," he
said.
Student Affairs encom
passes Residential Education,

Student Organization Services
and other services for stu
dents. Lyons said he is pleased
a University committee is
studying the best way to
restructure Student Affairs.
He noted that no significant
changes in the way the office
relates to the rest of the Uni
versity have taken place in at
least 18 years.
Whatever the final outcome,
"It is important for this
cluster of programs and serv
ices to have strong ties to our
educational mission," Lyons
said. "Learning in a university
is more than that which hap
pens in the classroom."
While Lyons has changed
Stanford in many ways, he ad
mits that Stanford has also
taught him "some powerful
lessons," especially on racial
issues.
"Multiculturalism or plural
ism will be a big issue for all
of our lifetimes," Lyons said,
adding that "Stanford turned
a very important corner last
year" with the report of the
University Committee on Mi
nority Issues.
The UCMI report was

highly critical of Student Af
fairs, saying the office "clearly
eschews providing visible, pro
active leadership on racial and
ethnic issues."
"We were missing an oppor
tunity — and I think it is an
obligation — to develop a
model of what an integrated
multicultural community
should be," Lyons said.
Another issue Lyons said
will remain important is find
ing the proper balance be
tween research and under
graduate education. He cites
Stanford in Washington,
Structured Liberal Education
and the Program in Human
Biology as examples of "reach
ing out to undergraduates."
Such interdisciplinary
teaching, he said, leads to "our
very best programs — those
in which students take a sig
nificant responsibility for
their own education."
Lyons' favorite memories of
Stanford are of "the quality
of things that students collec
tively do here." High on the
list are theatrical and musical
performances, he said.
