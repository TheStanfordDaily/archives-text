NEW FROM STANFORD
PUBUCATION SERVICES -
CAPPUCCINO*
AND COPIES
*
We're pleased to announce the opening of our new
copy center in Tresidder Memorial Union.
We now offer three convenient campus locations:
Tresidder, rear patio
Law School, room 824
Business School, room 72 (upper lounge)
*Ok - youve got us. We don't really sell cappuccino. But
it is offered at the Coffee House â€” just around the corner
from our new location!
What we do offer are excellent quality copies, free
pick-up and delivery, and overnight turnaround.
Give us a call at 723-3132 or stop by any of our
locations.
