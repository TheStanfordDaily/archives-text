# 'New' parking report suggests fewer spaces
## 
### Wendy Witt 
Parking spaces may soon be
scarcer than ever if University
President Donald Kennedy
adopts the recommendations of
a "refined" parking report that
has been called everything from
"a ray of light" to "simply lu
dicrous."
The revised report is almost
identical to the one the Com
mittee on Parking and Trans
portation issued on March 26;
the majority of members is still
recommending that the Univer
sity "reduce parking demand by
10 percent over the next decade
to match an expected loss of
3,000 parking spaces to new con
struction."
The committee has concluded
that Stanford cannot afford to
continue to provide convenient
parking at affordable rates. At
the same time, committee mem
bers have acknowledged that

any changes in the parking pro
gram must not be made at the
expense of personal safety or ef
ficiency.
Therefore, less convenient
parking must be accompanied
by substantial improvements to
alternate modes of transporta
tion.
The committee, however, is
not in unanimous agreement on
these conclusions. Committee
member Diana Diamond sub
mitted a minority report* in
which she said she agrees that
other forms of transportation
should be encouraged, but not
in the place of providing ade
quate parking.
The committee majority
advised that Stanford's new
parking policy have three pri
mary objectives: to reduce the
cost of providing parking; to
make getting to and around
campus safe and "fairly easy";
and to reduce traffic congestion
and preserve the environment.
To these ends the report in
cludes three phases of imple
mentation, beginning with
carpool incentives, an experi
mental shuttle service from
campus housing and at least one
Eeripheral lot in operation
efore September 1990.
For the 1990-91 school year,
some of the committee's recom
mendations include a more eq
uitable permit fee structure,
bicycle incentives and shuttle
services to residential neighbor
hoods that have concentrations
of Stanford students and em
ployees.
Long-term suggestions in
clude the improvement of the
Marguerite shuttle service and
lobbying state and county agen
cies for improved regional tran
sit.

"It will not be easy to bring
about the changes in behavior
and expectations we are suggest
ing here," the report concludes.
For many employees, "The
automobile is not a luxury; it
is a necessity," due to poor
public transit systems in their
area or because they need to
use their cars during the day
for personal or job-related
reasons, Diamond says in her
report.
The split within the commit
tee reflects the divisions in the
Stanford community at large.
One person at the public hear
ings called the report "simply
ludicrous" and urged the Uni
versity "to check this novel idea
of reducing demand by reducing
supply with some of the award
winning minds in our economics
department."
Another congratulated the
committee for "encouraging
more healthful alternatives,
calling the report "a ray of light
in a very smoggy transit corri
dor."
