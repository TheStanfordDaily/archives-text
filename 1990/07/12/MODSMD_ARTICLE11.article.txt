# 'New' parking report suggests fewer spaces

### Wendy Witt 
Parking spaces may soon be
scarcer than ever if University
President Donald Kennedy
adopts the recommendations of
a "refined" parking report that
has been called everything from
"a ray of light" to "simply lu
dicrous."
The revised report is almost
identical to the one the Com
mittee on Parking and Trans
portation issued on March 26;
the majority of members is still
recommending that the Univer
sity "reduce parking demand by
10 percent over the next decade
to match an expected loss of
3,000 parking spaces to new con
struction."
The committee has concluded
that Stanford cannot afford to
continue to provide convenient
parking at affordable rates. At
the same time, committee mem
bers have acknowledged that

any changes in the parking pro
gram must not be made at the
expense of personal safety or ef
ficiency.
Therefore, less convenient
parking must be accompanied
by substantial improvements to
alternate modes of transporta
tion.
The committee, however, is
not in unanimous agreement on
these conclusions. Committee
member Diana Diamond sub
mitted a minority report* in
which she said she agrees that
other forms of transportation
should be encouraged, but not
in the place of providing ade
quate parking.
The committee majority
advised that Stanford's new
parking policy have three pri
mary objectives: to reduce the
cost of providing parking; to
make getting to and around
