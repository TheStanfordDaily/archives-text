# Debate over cold fusion remains a hot topic

The cold fusion controversy
has attracted negative press and
intense skepticism within the
scientific community — opposi
tion that may be frustrating
constructive research that could
reveal an invaluable energy
resource, according to Materials
Science Engineering Prof.
Robert Huggins.
Huggins first attracted con
troversy when his group of re
searchers confirmed a portion
of the original observations of
Stanley Pons and Martin
Fleischmann at the University
of Utah.
A relatively low-profile sup
porter of the Pons and
Fleischmann findings, Huggins
still receives periodic hate mail.
He speculates that many scien
tists may be reluctant to accept
an entirely new set of principles
for what may be a previously
undiscovered and unconven
tional nuclear reaction.
Nuclear fusion is the principle
behind the hydrogen bomb and
the sun's energy. The only fusion
reactions currently known occur
under very high temperatures.
Cold fusion is the theoretical
event in which two nuclei are
fused together at low tempera
tures. The ensuing mass differ
ence is released as energy.
Emotional resistance?
Huggins feels that the nega
tive stigma attached to the cold
fusion experiments may impede
constructive research into the
topic. Whatever the reasons for
what he sees as highly emotional
resistance to the concept, Hiig
gins does not think that resis
tance as conclusively resolves
the issue.
The controversy has genera
ted such a negative atmosphere
that funding opportunities for
such research are almost non
existent within the United
States.
Despite the recently an
nounced early retirement of
President Chase N. Peterson of
the University of Utah — sus

pected to be related to his back
ing of cold fusion research —
and the latest efforts to discredit
cold fusion supporters as frauds,
the cold fusion controversy has
once again claimed the public
spotlight.
The disputes that have
erupted sinc6 the original cold
fusion claims made by Pons and
Fleischmann have left many
Utah faculty, students and ad
ministrators embarrassed about
the University of Utah's involve
ment. To these people, the cold
fusion episode has been a dis
credit to the university's repu
tation.
Although Peterson has been
surrounded in controversy out
side of his support of the cold
fusion effort, Huggins says
there is an unspoken under
standing that his involvement
with the cold fusion project
precipitated his decision to
retire early.
The president allocated half a
million dollars for a visiting
scientist program at the univer
sity's Cold Fusion Institute
while projecting the impression
that the funds were from an
anonymous source. This surrep
titious donation of funds was
not totally ethical, but
feels the negative atmosphere
on the Utah campus compelled
Peterson to act as he did.
In the past, critics of cold fu
sion findings have attacked the
techniques used by scientists
who report confirmations of the
cold fusion observations. But
the latest wave of criticism, in
cluding a recent article in the
journal Science, imply that the
scientists' reported results are
fraudulent, according to Hug
gins.
Even though three different
research groups within the De
partment of Energy have con
firmed the findings of Pons and
Fleischmann, the official posi
tion of the DOE is that the
results are invalid, Huggins
notes.
According to Huggins, the
major efforts directed at ex
amining "fusion in a jar" are

being conducted abroad in coun
tries like Japan and India. He
is convinced that if the issue is
resolved and some great new
knowledge is revealed, it prob
ably won't occur in the United
States.
Nuclear or not?
The evolution of the criticism
of cold fusion claims is interest
ing in itself. Initially, the criti
cisms dealt with possible
problems with even temperature
distribution or mistakes in the
temperature measurements.
However, further ex
perimentation seems to have
shown the temperature distri
bution in the Pons-Fleischmann
cells to be within .01 degrees.
According to Huggins, the ex
cess heat observed in some of
the experiments is real, and at
this stage, those who don't be
lieve this have very little
evidence to support themselves.
"The calorimetry has been

done very carefully," says Hug
gins. In addition, he points out
that micrographs of the pal
ladium electrode clearly demon
strate heat stress.
According to Huggins, the
three elements needed to prove
that the Pons and Fleischmann
observation is indeed a fusion
reaction are recordings of heat,
tritium generation and neutron
flux.
Theoretically, in a conven
tional fusion reaction, tritium
generation and the creation of
high energy neutrons should oc
cur in a 1-to-l ratio. In the Pons-
Fleischmann experiment,
however, there is a very low
neutron flux and thus a very
high tritium-to-neutron ratio.
Therefore, one of the main
objections to the possibility of a
nuclear reaction is that the
neutron flux is very small. Ac
cording to Huggins, this doesn't
discount anything except that
the reaction observed is

definitely not a conventional nu
clear reaction. If one assumes
the expected reaction where
deuterium fusion yields tritium
nuclei plus neutrons, one would
expect to see a sizeable neutron
flux.
However, if one considers the
possibility of a "neutron sink"
where the excess neutrons com
bine with the electrode element
to form isotopes, one would not
expect to see a large flux. There
are traces of evidence for such
an isotopic reaction with lithium
that would yield large quantities
of energy.
In fact, in the case of some
novel fusion-type reaction, the
low neutron flux is a "definite
blessing" since, according to
Huggins, one of the greatest dif
ficulties involved with
developing conventional fusion
energy is the enormous neutron
flux generated by the reactions.

This neutron flux is known to
be extremely detrimental to
most structural materials and
produces a serious radioactive
waste problem.
Another basis for skepticism
about so-called cold fusion ex
periments is that they are
sporadic and unpredictable. Ac
cording to Huggins, this re
mains the major basis for
criticism.
While the cold fusion contro
versy is interesting as a purely

scientific phenomenon, the po
tential "economic implications
are enormous," says Huggins.
Current fission reactors rep
resenting decades of research
generate approximately 50 watts
per cubic centimeter. Using the
so-called cold fusion process,
people have reported outputs up
to 100 watts per cubic centime
ter.
Huggins' lab has generated
15-20 watts per cubic centime
ter. He points out that, "being
within an order of magnitude
with such a crude set-up is phe
nomenal." He quickly adds that
this power output is coupled
with a very low neutron flux.
