# Spence gets down to business
## Former Harvard dean welcomes change of pace 
### Mary B. Haban 
It is Monday afternoon. A. Mi
chael Spence sits at the head of
a long walnut conference table,
calendar in one hand, lunch in
the other. His office overlooks
the picturesque Quad where
students are scurrying to class.
The day outside is sunny, quite
different from the snow-covered
campus he is used to seeing.
Glancing up over his dark
rimmed spectacles, Spence
focuses on the window, pauses,
then smiles. He's glad to be back
at Stanford, this time as dean
of the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
Spence, 46, left his post as
dean of Harvard's Faculty of
Arts and Sciences to become the
seventh dean of Stanford's na
tionally ranked business school
on July 2. He succeeded Robert
Jaedicke, who stepped down as
dean after six years to return
to teaching and research. And
although Spence has only been
at Stanford for a week, he al
ready feels right at home.
"That's probably because I
was an associate professor of
economics here from 1973
through 1975 while my wife,
Ann, was earning her MBA,"
Spence said, adding that Stan
ford will be a welcome change
from his position at Harvard.
"The size and scope of my
duties at Harvard were very
wide and broad. Overseeing 700
faculty members and 9,000 stu
dents didn't allow me as much
time as I would have liked to
spend with them or my family,"
said Spence. "That's what I'm
looking forward to here at Stan
ford - quality time with faculty
and students. And of course
spending time with my wife and
three children."
Spence's responsibilities at
Stanford will be much more con
ducive for this quality time.
Being responsible for only 120
faculty members and 800 stu
dents will leave more time — as
well as more opportunities.
"Teaching is something I
really enjoy doing," Spence said.
"It is my hope that somewhere
down the line I can incorporate
that back into my life."
Born in New Jersey and raised
in Canada, Spence was sur

rounded by the academic flavor
long before his college years.
His father taught business
policy at York University, ana
his mother holds a master's in
biology from the University of
Minnesota.
But it was during his years
at Princeton University, where
Spence earned his degree in eco
nomics, that he made the deci
sion to enter the world of
academia.
"I wanted to give being a
teacher, an academic, a try," said
Spence. "I wasn't sure if it
would be the right thing — or
that I would succeed at it — so
I just tried."
He not only tried, but
succeeded in attaining his goals
in academics. After Princeton he
went on to Oxford University as
a Rhodes Scholar and earned
bachelor's and master's degrees
in mathematics. Then it was off
to Harvard, where he earned his

Ph.D. in economics.
From that point on, it was
upward and onward for Spence,
who went on to win Harvard's
John K. Galbraith Prize for Ex
cellence in Teaching, as well as
the John Bates Clark Medal,
awarded to an economist under
age 40 for contribution to eco
nomic research.
Three books and 50 articles
later, Spence is here at Stanford,
back where he began his teach
ing career — a place he's still
very much a part of.
Catherine Hay, an MBA stu
dent on the search committee
that selected Spence, said she
was pleased with the commit
tee's choice. "We students sat
down with him for two hours
and ... we felt that our concerns
were his concerns," she said.
"He knows what it's like to be
an MBA student at Stanford in
a way that no faculty member
can understand."
