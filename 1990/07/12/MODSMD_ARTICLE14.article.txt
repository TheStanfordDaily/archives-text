# Clinic in Palo Alto treats the homeless
## 
### Dionne Scott 
Eric Stark, a native of Palo
Alto and a second-year med
ical student at Stanford, has
organized the opening of a
free clinic for the homeless
in the Palo Alto, Redwood
City and Menlo Park areas.
The Arbor Free Clinic is
located at the Palo Alto Red
Cross and is staffed by Stan
ford faculty, medical students
and community volunteers. It
provides members of the com
munity living at the poverty
level — the homeless or res
idents of single-room oc
cupancy hotels — with free
health care, consultation and
medication every Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The
clinic welcomes anyone and
will ask no questions.
On the opening Sunday, the
staff of the clinic helped six
patients. With the distribu
tion of fliers by the Urban
Ministry, and by word of
mouth, Arbor Free antici
pates many more in the fu
ture.
Stark said he is confident
that one day they will "look
back at our day of six people
and laugh." Unfortunately,
the clinic only has resources
for the first 15 people who
arrive in one day because of
the limited facilities and the
small number of physicians.
The idea of establishing a
free clinic originated from
two third-year medical stu
dents and the Medical
School's emergency director,
Dr. Michael Eliastam. Stark
adopted the idea as a project
in conjunction with the Med

ical Scholars Program, a
funding system which assists
medical students conducting
research.
Stark sees the clinic as a
necessary departure from
Stanford's concentration on
"high-tech" issues in
medicine to the "more impor
tant" issue of distribution of
health care.
According to Stark, work
ing in the Arbor Free Clinic
will give students the experi
ence of helping people who
have not had regular access
to health care. Presently, no
such opportunity exists in the
Medical School.
One of the difficulties
Stark faced in setting up the
clinic was obtaining malprac
tice insurance. Stark and
others made several negotia
tions with the Medical School
and eventually received sup
port.
However, the agreement
states that only Stanford fac
ulty physicians belonging to
the Faculty Practice Plan can
work in the clinic, limiting
the clinic to a small number
of practitioners.
Stark and his associates
also had to find a location for
the clinic. Initially, they
planned for the clinic to be
in the First Baptist Church
in Menlo Park, but there were
too many problems in making
arrangements with the city of
Menlo Park.
Fortunately, Stark said, the
Red Cross turned out to be
a better location because of
the larger space and more
available medical facilities.
