# Summertime visitors check into Stanford
## 
### Tarrant Mahony 
The Russians aren't coming,
but just about everyone else is:
some 185 confeience groups
with 16,000 participants will
spend time on the Farm this
summer, and their presence will
help defray costs that would
otherwise be paid by full-time
students.
"Every Stanford student is
the direct beneficiary of the
summer programs: the part we
take in above expenses goes
right back to Housing and Food
Services, and that helps to
reduce their room and board
bills," said Kathy Warren, as
sistant manager of conferences.
For three months every year,
Stanford becomes host to a wide
variety of academic conferences,
athletic camps and alumni
reunions, and this year is no
exception.
"The (U.S.) Olympic Develop
ment Team (for soccer) is com
ing here for the first time," said
Carol Knestrick, acting manager
of conferences, "in order to have
opportunities for competitive
matches in the Bay Area."
"A group of Canadian judges,
which comes every two years,
will also be here, as will the
Stanford Executive Program, an
annual eight-week conference,"
she added.
The scheduled groups include
English teachers from Taiwan
and Japan, the International
Symposium on Rebuilding after
Earthquakes and the Bay Area
Global Education Program.
These programs, which run
from June 24 to Sept. 17 and
bring both a diverse campus
population and welcome revenue
to Stanford, are growing ever
more popular, according to War
ren.
"When I first came here 24
years ago there were two people
in the office and we handled 33
conferences. Now we have seven
and a half full-time employees,
and close to 50 for the summer,
and are handling 185 confer

ences," she said.
"What I like to see is happy
customers, clients who return,
and jthe income for the Univer
sity," she added.
The Office of Conferences,
which is a part of Housing and
Food Services, arranges room
and board, while the sponsoring
group, which must be affiliated
with the University, takes care
of the content of the program.
The Athletic Department is
the largest single sponsor of
summer programs — responsi
ble for nearly a third of the total
number — and is involved in
dance, fencing and rowing pro
grams as well as the more visible
tennis, basketball and football
camps.
Another sponsor, Volunteers
in Asia, is bringing several of
the more unusual groups to
Stanford this summer.
Two of the organization's pro
grams involve groups of college
students from Japan and Tai
wan who will come to Stanford
to study English and learn about
American culture, said VTA co
ordinator Cliff Chan.
A third program will bring
English teachers from Japan
and Taiwan to study techniques
of teaching English as a foreign
language. These teachers will
also be meeting with Bay Area
social studies teachers to discuss
how to present Japan and Tai
wan in American classrooms,
said Chan.
The fourth program is per
haps the most unique of all: a
women's group from Taiwan
which is coming here to learn
about the women's movement in
America. The group will be
meeting with members of the
Palo Alto National Organization
of Women, the League of Women
Voters and organizations of
Asian-American women.
"They are coming here to
learn and exchange ideas," said
Chan, "and at the same time it
is also a learning experience for
people here."
