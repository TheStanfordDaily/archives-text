## Editorial The 						value of art 
### 
THE VOCAL anti
obscene" art con
stituency is a threat to
our society. Behind all the
rhetoric, what groups like the
American Family Association
and others are really fighting
for is the right to censorship.
The AFA is gaining atten
tion by protesting National
Endowment for the Arts
funding of artists whose work
they call "pornographic," and
the underlying assumption
that Americans need someone
to shield them from "offen
sive" material is, at best, in
sulting.
This notion was carried to
its most ridiculous extreme
when, two years ago, mem
bers of the AFA and other
groups protested the
"sacrilegious" movie "The
Last Temptation of Christ"
without even having seen it.
Instead of the blind leading
the blind, it was a case of the
blind leading anyone who
would listen. But now, sur
prisingly, more and more
people are listening.
Political rhetoric aside, the
current debate centers on an
age-old question about the
role of art in society. Current
ly, the review panels of the
NEA make recommendations
for grants to artists. Even if
we assume that these panels
can discern "good" art from
"bad" art, it is extremely dan
gerous to add the further
restriction that the NEA
must fund only "socially ac
ceptable" art.
But is any art really a
threat to society, as members
of the AFA and other groups
claim? Are people as impres
sionable as Dante's Paolo and
Francesca, who, upon reading
the story of Lancelot and
Guinevere, were overcome by
emotion and went off into the
forest to ... ahem, whatever?
Is it more dangerous for our
children to watch a film or
to follow the example of a

minister who is protesting
against a film he hasn't even
seen?
It is true that in this in
creasingly complex world
where we are bombarded by
information, it is becoming
harder and harder to main
tain a consistent value sys
tem. Few of us blindly believe
in a Supreme Being or a long
list of absolute wrongs. Even
if we do have vague beliefs,
they often play a very second
ary role as we live out our
fast-paced, secular lives.
The AFA and other groups
are trying to bring back a
value system where the fam
ily is at the core. But the"I
Can't Get No Satisfaction"
code of our society has made
a return to this way of life
as unlikely as unilateral dis
armament. Advertising and
the spirit of capitalism have
appealed to people's natural
desire to try to find meaning
in life and formed the basis
of our high divorce rate, dis
posable society.
Modern society is made up
of many interlocking pieces
with people performing func
tions and not always seeing
themselves as part of a larger
picture. Innovations, ideas,
thoughts die in the minds of
many people because they do
not fit into the narrow
framework of their function
in society. Art allows people
to, in a magical world, express
those thoughts and ideas so
that they do not die.
Art is put forth for us to
judge on an individual basis.
If we like something, it has
value for us. If we do not like
something, it may still have
value for someone else, but
we should not cower beneath
the weight of the art es
tablishment and say that we
like it as well. In a similar
way, we should not cower un
der the weight of the AFA's
claims to a moral higher
ground.
