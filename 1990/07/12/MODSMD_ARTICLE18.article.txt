Stanford should hire integrated contract labor

One of the difficulties I expe
rience going to and from work
every day is passing construc
tion sites on campus and seeing
the composition of the work
force.
In spite of promises about im
proving the racial composition
of the construction work forces
by University administrators
over the past two decades, those
work forces remain as pale as
ever — at least as far as African-
Americans are concerned.
Therefore, my anger is no less
than it was two decades ago.
Of particular concern to me
at the present time is the new
athletic facility being annexed
to the Encina Gym. I see young
white men who were born with
a guaranteed job based on their
race, born with seniority, born
on "third base" without ever
having been at bat.
I recall bringing this problem
to the attention of the president
and senior officers at Stanford
in the late 19605, long before
some of those workers were even
born. The contractors say they

have to take whoever the union
sends. The union says African-
Americans do not have seniority.
On and on the excuses run.
Like many in response to
apartheid, all are opposed to it,
but the inevitable "however... "
is where the disputes begin in
discussing remedies.
Never has Stanford favored
exercising economic sanctions or
stiff standards against contrac
tors who do not hire people of
color in any significant num
bers.
Let us be exact and dramatic
about this. There can be no bet
ter symbol for this than the ren
ovation of Memorial Church.
Several million dollars will be
spent to restore this landmark.
How many of those dollars will
find their way in the pockets of
all of God's children?
My estimate is that about $5
out of every $100,000 spent may
go to people of color. That is
the reason I told the previous
president of the University that
this is the same as financing
racism.

The external affirmative ac
tion program has been treated
like an orphan by Stanford since
its feeble inception. The current
Vice- President for Administra
tive Resources does not want
the responsibility, and neither
does the Affirmative Action Of
ficer.
In addition, this same vice
president has stopped initial ef
forts by a special task force of
the Affirmative Action Council
to establish an effective program
that would have been based on
analyses of University-wide ex
penditures and strategic plan
ning.
Efforts to give some emphasis
to the external affirmative ac
tion program in the self-study
by the recently established An
nual Review Panel were
thwarted by none other than the
Affirmative Action Office. The
office's compromise was to pro
vide one sentence in the total
evaluation document!
So, the external Affirmative
Action Program is homeless,
fragmented and headless, and

the amount of money Stanford
contracts out annually is too
much not to be monitored ef
fectively.
Any organization that en
dorses the concept of social re
sponsibility would not allow
such irresponsibility to con
tinue. I have said it before, and
I shall say it again for the
record, for the centennial record,
that the University has ignored
this issue negligently and
deliberately, and that it is the
moral equivalent of financing
racism.
