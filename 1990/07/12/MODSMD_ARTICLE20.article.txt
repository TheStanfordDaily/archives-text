## Standardized tests discriminate 
### 
Standardized tests have a way
of making you feel really stupid.
And if you're black, the feeling
can be even further intensified.
A recent government report
conducted by the National Com
mission on Testing and Public
Policy revealed that the Ameri
can educational system relies
too heavily on standardized
tests. Tests such as the Scholas
tic Aptitude Test were found to
contain cultural biases that dis
criminate against women and
people of color.
The report also says that stan
dardized tests, particularly mul
tiple choice exams, restrict
rather than promote educa
tional opportunity.
Allow me to commit a Stan
ford faux pas by telling you that
I only scored 998 on my SATs.
Every time somebody asked
me what I got on my SATs, I'd
say "Oh, around 1200," knowing
good and well I was lying
through my teeth. Giving my
real score always made me feel

and look stupid. But I have re
cently come to an understanding
of how standardized tests oper
ate in this country.
The more one has in common
with the creator of the test, the
better he/she is going to do on
the test.
I'm not denying that some
black people have scored well on
standardized tests (Lord knows
we've been taught plenty about
white culture), but traditionally,
standardized tests are used to
maintain white (and male) dom
inance.
Standardized tests, as they
are currently utilized, classify
people as "unable to learn" and
"able to learn." Already stan
dardized tests are being used to
classify children as young as
three or four.
However, as the commission
said, "Tests should be used to
identify and cultivate human
talent, rather than being used
solely for purposes of weeding
individuals out of the opportu

nity marketplace."
If standardized tests go un
changed, and if America contin -
ues its heavy reliance on these
tests, our educational system
will resemble that of many com
munist nations in which people's
career paths are determined by
a "comprehension" test taken in
childhood.
And if standardized tests go
unchanged and continue to
maintain their cultural biases,
they will continue to perpetuate
the racist myth that black
people are unable to learn, by
providing "proof" (low test
scores) of their inability.
More importantly, if America
continues its heavy reliance on
standardized tests, I fear such
tests will be used to lock people
of color into menial labor and
shut them out of positions of
power.
