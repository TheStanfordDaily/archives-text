## Flirting with death for fun 
### Rita Roca 
When one is gripped by over
powering terror while looking
down over the edge of a
skyscraper, the feeling experi
enced is described as a fear of
heights. Why is it then, that one
can travel in an elevator up to
the 25th story of a building and
not be paralyzed by horror until
a glimpse down shreds all reason
and bravado?
One possible answer is that
the height itself is not at the
root of the phobia; that fear is
caused by one's desire to jump.
Who has not peered over the
edge of the Empire State Build
ing, the Golden Gate Bridge or
even the roof of a house, and
not wondered what it would feel
like to fall into empty space like
a high-diver?
If you combine this impulse
to jump into the void with the
security of mountain climbing
equipment and larger-than-life
bungee cords, you get the mag
netic attraction of bungee
jumping.
Bungee-jumping outfits
derived their sport from a con
test of manhood of an
Australian aboriginal tribe. In
this competition, men jumped
from trees with vines attached

to their ankles. The one who
came closest to hitting the
ground was declared the man
liest.
Although not linked to
proving one's social status any
more, this unsanctioned sport
has attracted the attention of
daring people of both genders
in California, who pay from
about $40-$9O per jump to fulfill
their impulse to hurl themselves
into space.
I myself have bungee-jumped
twice from abandoned bridges
near Lake Tahoe. Below the
bridges flowed small rivers; I
was assured repeatedly that
bungee-jumping was quite safely
designed, utilizing thick cords,
mountain-climbing equipment
and plenty of physics.
Nevertheless, before jumping
I was required to sign a long
waiver that released the com
pany from any responsibility.
On the one hand, this contract
could be seen as the company's
attempt to avoid legal problems;
but on the other, it could be
viewed as a device to increase
my already growing terror. If it
was intended to increase my ter
ror, it worked.
I was initiated into the
bungee-jumping cult by a friend
who is a veteran of the sport,
having bungee-jumped approxi
mately thirty times. Once he
even jumped off the Golden Gate
Bridge.
(Incidentally, jumping off
bridges is illegal, but companies
circumvent that "trivial" detail
by operating out of hot-air bal
loons which, apparently, is le
gal.)
When people hear that I've
been bungee-jumping, after ini
tial disbelief and fear, their
curiosity gets the better of them
and they want to know exactly
how the fall felt, if I was scared
and what it was like to bounce.
Basically, the jump can be
divided into four stages: prepar
ing to jump, falling, the bounce
and the postjump.
For the first stage, I was
hooked up in various harnesses
and attached to three long bun
gee cords. It was at this point
that the significance of what I
was going to do hit me.
While ten people counted
down my jump, I climbed over
the rail of the bridge and stood
on the outer ledge. I was looking
down at the rushing water, re
alizing that I would dive
through the air towards the
rocks with nothing in between
myself and a messy death.
In a surrealistic daze, I
despaired aloud, "I can't believe
I'm doing this." A jumping com
panion later pinpointed that
feeling of terror as one as in
stinctive as hunger; or more ap
propriately, I felt, as the same
feeling one experiences a split
second before getting into a car
accident.
The most primitive part of my
psyche was telling me that there

was no way on earth that I
should be doing what I was
doing, but my conscious brain,
which had put me on the outer
edge of a 110-foot bridge in the
first place, took over. I crouched
down and, with eyes wide-open,
hurled myself into the open air.
During later jumps, I had the
presence of mind to visually ex
plore the trees, the water and
the sky, all of which change po
sitions and size while gravity
sucks one downwards. Yet dur
ing the first fall, the sheer
novelty of dropping head over
heels towards rocky water for
ninety feet robbed me of the
ability to think or to feel any
terror.
The intensity of being freed
from the burden of stability was
the most pleasurable and un
matchable sensation that I had
ever experienced. There was
simply no room for fear during
those few seconds.
On the other hand, other
jumpers' first free-falls can be
significantly different experi
ences. My veteran friend's first
leap was "pure unadulterated
mind-gripping terror." He
jumped at night into pure black
ness, towards rushing water
with the wind whipping around
his falling body. This leads one
to wonder how he possibly did
the next 29 jumps. The ex
hilarating feeling just ensnares
you, I guess.
The third stage of the jump,
bouncing, initiates a sharp
return to reality, a rupture in
the trance of pleasure — or ter
ror, as the case may be.
It is sudden, but not painful,
because the cords stretch
gradually during the free fall.
Many people enjoy bouncing
most of all, perhaps because it
is an affirmation that the cords
have held together.
Some people feel "really
psyched" to feel the cords pull
ing at their body; it is a return
to reality that makes them very
happy. I, however, fear the first
bounce, because as I rocket up
wards at the bridge like a person
in a high-speed glass elevator,
it grows exponentially and I
can't help but wonder if I will
be the unlucky one to crash into
it. Since my knowledge of
physics is sketchy at best, reas
surances by the bungee-jumping
people do not quiet my inner
fears.
Post-jump adrenalin is the
most memorable sensation of
the experience. For approxi
mately a half hour after my first
time, I wore a permanent grin
and mentally rehearsed over and
over again the timeless moments
of free-fall.
While dangling at the end of
the cord waiting to be pulled up
by the rest of the bungee group,
I was filled with exuberance
from the realization that I had
fallen head-first from a bridge
the height of a ten-story build
ing and still survived.
The post-jump adrenalin high
passed eventually, and the eager
fear of falling that initiated the
whole bungee experience set in
again. I awaited my second jump
wondering if 1 would have the
insane courage to fall from a
bridge all over again. Of course,
I did.

feeling one experiences a split
second before getting into a car
accident.
The most primitive part of my
psyche was telling me that there

was no way on earth that I
should be doing what I was
doing, but my conscious brain,
which had put me on the outer
edge of a 110-foot bridge in the
first place, took over. I crouched
down and, with eyes wide-open,
hurled myself into the open air.
During later jumps, I had the
presence of mind to visually ex
plore the trees, the water and
the sky, all of which change po
sitions and size while gravity
sucks one downwards. Yet dur
ing the first fall, the sheer
novelty of dropping head over
heels towards rocky water for
ninety feet robbed me of the
ability to think or to feel any
terror.
The intensity of being freed
from the burden of stability was
the most pleasurable and un
matchable sensation that I had
ever experienced. There was
simply no room for fear during
those few seconds.
On the other hand, other
jumpers' first free-falls can be
significantly different experi
ences. My veteran friend's first
leap was "pure unadulterated
mind-gripping terror." He
jumped at night into pure black
ness, towards rushing water
with the wind whipping around
his falling body. This leads one
to wonder how he possibly did
the next 29 jumps. The ex
hilarating feeling just ensnares
you, I guess.
The third stage of the jump,
bouncing, initiates a sharp
return to reality, a rupture in
the trance of pleasure — or ter
ror, as the case may be.
It is sudden, but not painful,
because the cords stretch
gradually during the free fall.
Many people enjoy bouncing
most of all, perhaps because it
is an affirmation that the cords
have held together.
Some people feel "really
psyched" to feel the cords pull
ing at their body; it is a return
to reality that makes them very
happy. I, however, fear the first
bounce, because as I rocket up
wards at the bridge like a person
in a high-speed glass elevator,
it grows exponentially and I
can't help but wonder if I will
be the unlucky one to crash into
it. Since my knowledge of
physics is sketchy at best, reas
surances by the bungee-jumping
people do not quiet my inner
fears.
Post-jump adrenalin is the
most memorable sensation of
the experience. For approxi
mately a half hour after my first
time, I wore a permanent grin
and mentally rehearsed over and
over again the timeless moments
of free-fall.
While dangling at the end of
the cord waiting to be pulled up
by the rest of the bungee group,
I was filled with exuberance
from the realization that I had
fallen head-first from a bridge
the height of a ten-story build
ing and still survived.
The post-jump adrenalin high
passed eventually, and the eager
fear of falling that initiated the
whole bungee experience set in
again. I awaited my second jump
wondering if 1 would have the
insane courage to fall from a
bridge all over again. Of course,
I did.

When one is gripped by over
powering terror while looking
down over the edge of a
skyscraper, the feeling experi
enced is described as a fear of
heights. Why is it then, that one
can travel in an elevator up to
the 25th story of a building and
not be paralyzed by horror until
a glimpse down shreds all reason
and bravado?
One possible answer is that
the height itself is not at the
root of the phobia; that fear is
caused by one's desire to jump.
Who has not peered over the
edge of the Empire State Build
ing, the Golden Gate Bridge or
even the roof of a house, and
not wondered what it would feel
like to fall into empty space like
a high-diver?
If you combine this impulse
to jump into the void with the
security of mountain climbing
equipment and larger-than-life
bungee cords, you get the mag
netic attraction of bungee
jumping.

to their ankles. The one who
came closest to hitting the
ground was declared the man

Although not linked to
proving one's social status any
more, this unsanctioned sport
has attracted the attention of
daring people of both genders
in California, who pay from
about $40-$9O per jump to fulfill
their impulse to hurl themselves
into space.
I myself have bungee-jumped
twice from abandoned bridges
near Lake Tahoe. Below the
bridges flowed small rivers; I
was assured repeatedly that
bungee-jumping was quite safely
designed, utilizing thick cords,
mountain-climbing equipment
and plenty of physics.
Nevertheless, before jumping
I was required to sign a long
waiver that released the com
pany from any responsibility.
On the one hand, this contract
could be seen as the company's
attempt to avoid legal problems;
but on the other, it could be
viewed as a device to increase
my already growing terror. If it
was intended to increase my ter
ror, it worked.
I was initiated into the
bungee-jumping cult by a friend
who is a veteran of the sport,
having bungee-jumped approxi
mately thirty times. Once he
even jumped off the Golden Gate
Bridge.
(Incidentally, jumping off
bridges is illegal, but companies
circumvent that "trivial" detail
by operating out of hot-air bal
loons which, apparently, is le
gal.)
When people hear that I've
been bungee-jumping, after ini
tial disbelief and fear, their
curiosity gets the better of them
and they want to know exactly
how the fall felt, if I was scared
and what it was like to bounce.
Basically, the jump can be
divided into four stages: prepar
ing to jump, falling, the bounce
and the postjump.
For the first stage, I was
hooked up in various harnesses
and attached to three long bun
gee cords. It was at this point
that the significance of what I
was going to do hit me.
While ten people counted
down my jump, I climbed over
the rail of the bridge and stood
on the outer ledge. I was looking
down at the rushing water, re
alizing that I would dive
through the air towards the
rocks with nothing in between
myself and a messy death.
In a surrealistic daze, I
despaired aloud, "I can't believe
I'm doing this." A jumping com
panion later pinpointed that
feeling of terror as one as in
stinctive as hunger; or more ap
propriately, I felt, as the same
feeling one experiences a split
second before getting into a car
accident.
