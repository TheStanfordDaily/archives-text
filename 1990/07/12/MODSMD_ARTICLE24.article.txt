# Musical about Galileo's life should be silenced
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
The musical "Galileo" is now making
a full-scale West Coast premier at the
Lucie Stern Theatre in Palo Alto, under
the direction of Robert Kelley.
The order of events and cast of char
acters are strikingly similar to Bertolt
Brecht's "Galileo," which was written in
1938.
Brecht's work focuses on the actual
historical events in the Italian physicist's

life that led to his imprisonment in 1633.
Galileo invents the telescope, discovers
the moons around Jupiter, and then
publicly states that the earth revolves
around the sun, causing outrage in the
Church of Rome. His belief that the earth
— and therefore man — is not the center
of the universe is viewed as heresy and
he is sentenced to prison until death.
Brecht's Galileo is cowardly and frus
trated as he retracts his scientific dis
coveries to avoid physical torture. Plot
twists are developed through the char

acters of his religious daughter and a
double-crossing student.
However, the modern musical version
by Keith Levenson, Alexa Junge and
Jeanine Levenson focuses more upon the
familial aspect, and the play is more
about Galileo's love for and conflict with
his daughter Mara than about the 16th
century and the Inquisition.
Still, the historical aspects that are
included bog down the script with nu
merous slow-moving scenes filled with
overwhelming musical numbers and
solemn, intellectual dialogue.
Paul Harmon's masterful performance
as Galileo enables us to feel Galileo's
excitement at discovering the universe.
Harmon injects enthusiasm into every
thing he does; his powerful and incisive
characterization almost salvages the
show. His voice is rich and melodious,
and he creates a few magical moments
with his engaging interpretation of the
astronomer.
In the final scene, after he has
retracted his statement that the earth
revolves around the sun and he is visited
by his daughter in prison, Harmon is
able to project a strong sense of the
scientist's magnificent vision, and the ac
companying horror of having it silenced.
Valerie DePena is charming and intel
ligent as his daughter Mara, who is
trapped between her love and respect for
her father and his work, and her devotion
to God and the Church.
This conflict is central to the play, but
her torment is cerebral, and we never
really feel her sense of confusion.
To add mystery to an otherwise stag

nant script, the character of the double
crossing male student has been changed
to that of a beautiful woman (Livia
Genise) with a secret agenda and a ro
mantic interest in Galileo.
These personal touches help create
movement amid the weighty moral and
philosophical themes, but every interac
tion leads to the inevitable ending, and
very few moments in "Galileo" are
savored for their emotional content.
With its complex music and clever, but
unwieldy, lyrics, "Galileo" gets stuck in
its own intricacy. The production stays
earth-bound, and with the exception of
the relationship between Galileo and his
daughter, there is little personal drama
to draw us into the characters' lives.
It is obvious that director Kelley tries
to approach this script with a balanced
hand and leave it up to the viewer to
comment upon the ignorance of the age.
Yet merely tracing the fate of a man
whose genius was nearly broken only
manages to leave the audience with an
unfulfilling feeling of distance from the
characters.
Even in a little scene when the Cardinal
and the Pope sing "A Little Tea," they
are resigned to the fact that their friend
Galileo has committed heresy and will
go to prison. The human aspect isn't
revealed — we don't experience their fear
that Galileo will incite a riot, nor do we
see their omnipotence, guilt or remorse.
"Galileo" plays through July 22 at the
Lucie Stern Theatre, 1305 Middlefield
Road, Palo Alto. For information call the
CAPA Box Office, (415) 329-2623.
