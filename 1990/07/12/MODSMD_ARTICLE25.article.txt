# Cafe Pro Bono: It is far better than bene
## 
### Sunil Perkash 
One of the most refreshing
things about Cafe Pro Bono
is its ambience. The back
ground music fits well with
the clean, comfortable decor
of the restaurant. As we sat
down, "As Time Goes By,"
from "Casablanca," was fil
tering its way into the dining
area. The slowly turning
ceiling fans added to the
Bogart-era atmosphere.
With this mood, we began
our dining experience. Both
the menu and the wine list
seemed to offer a variety of
different items suitable for
just about every price range.
We started with an appetizer
of Tortelloni & la Cafe Pro
Bono — pasta stuffed with
swiss chard and ricotta
cheese, served with fresh sage
and melted parmesan cheese.
Aside from the exquisitely
artful manner in which it was
served, which included a rose
shaped tomato garnish, the
dish was a true culinary tour
de force.
Our next course, the Heart
of Palm Vinaigrette with Bay
Shrimp Salad, was also art
fully displayed on our plates,
and had an equally satisfying
taste.
For our main course, I
chose the Lamb Shish Kebab
while my companion ordered
the Linguine Con Vongole.
My charbroiled, marinated
portions of lamb were cooked
and seasoned to perfection —
a nice surprise since most
places do not know how to
serve lamb correctly.
The linguine — covered
with a white wine, clam juice,
garlic and olive oil sauce, and
served with baby clams —
tasted unmistakably fresh,
also a welcome change from
the boxed pasta so many of
us live on during the summer.
For dessert we had the
Chocolate Decadence and the
Creme Caramel. Once again,
the talent the chef had for

arranging food on a plate was
obvious, exemplified by the
way the Decadence was sur
rounded by a raspberry sauce
with delicate flower impres
sions in it. The Decadence
was a true chocolate-lover's
fantasy, making it a great
danger for those trying to lose
a few pounds this summer.
Their desserts, it should be
noted, are prepared by their
own kitchen, and are not
brought in from another
bakery.
The prices on the menu
vary quite a bit. The shish
kebab, along with all the
other entries, is served with
fresh vegetables, potatoes and
soup or a mixed green salad,
and costs $13.95 while the
linguine is priced at $7.95 —
reasonable considering the
large portion served. The
grilled breast of chicken is
available at $7.95 while the
highest-priced items on the
menu are $14.95, such as the
steak.
In other words, given the
quality of both the food and
the surroundings, the prices
are relatively reasonable.
The menu also offers a va
riety of vegetarian dishes, in
cluding fettucine with fresh
vegetables and marinara
sauce, that serve to round out
the offerings and facilitate
dining for people with diverg
ing tastes and budgets.
Overall, Cafe Pro Bono,
with its assortment of pastas,
meats, salads and fresh
seafoods, is one of those rare
places where both food and
atmosphere are created with
great care.
at 2437 Birch St.,
off of California Avenue,
parking is always easily avail
able, making this a wonderful
alternative to the hustle and
bustle of downtown. The res
taurant is open for lunch and
dinner Monday through Sat
urday. Humphrey Bogart
would have been impressed!
