# African a capella group offers inspirational, religious sound
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Paul Simon has given us
plenty of music to be thankful
for, but his greatest gift so far
has not been his own creation.
With the success of his
"Graceland" album, Simon
opened America's ears to the
rhythms of Africa and created
a new market for the previously
ignored music of the Dark Con
tinent. Most record stores now
have separate shelves stocked
with discs from across the globe,
and African acts have found
themselves a greater part of the
world music scene.
The biggest benefactor of the
"Graceland" gift has been Lady
smith Black Mambazo, the ten
member South African a capella
group that inspired Simon and
gerformed on most of his album,
ince providing the highlights
of the "Graceland" tour, Lady

smith has been able to sustain
its own American touring
schedule and release several al
bums in the United States.
The latest release, "Two
Worlds, One Heart," features
the familiar vocal interplay that
has been Lady smith's trade
mark. An intimate knowledge of
his songfellows* talents enables
ringleader Joseph Shabalala to
compile a rich texture of backing
choruses, sparkling solos and
sporadic chants. Often employ
ing the basic technique of sing
ing rounds, Ladysmith proves
that even singers learn all they
really need to know in kinder
garten.
A deeply religious offering,
the album rejoices about God
and the "amazing events hap
pening in the world today." Most
of the lyrics are in Ladysmith's
native tongue, but alternate
song titles and liner notes are
available for anyone who needs

more than the music to find the
meaning.
Among other things, Lady
smith urges all people to "do
the gumboots dance" on
"Township Jive," poets and
scholars to "Count and Write"
about incredible world events,
and musicians to "Scatter the
Fire "
But perhaps the most inspi
rational statement — especially
in the wake of Nelson Mandela's
long-awaited release from prison
— comes in "Ngomnyango (By
the Door)." As the liner notes
translate, "There are no short
cuts; if anyone tries to come in
through the window, chase them
away and tell them that the only
way in is through the door."
Although South Africa and
the United States may be two
separate worlds, this is a mes
sage that people of both coun
tries should take to their "one
heart."
