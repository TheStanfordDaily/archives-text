# 'Fairlane' is worse than it sounds
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
The immortal bard Shake
speare once wrote that "a rose
by any other name would smell
as sweet."
If we hold such a statement
to be true, then its converse
should also be valid. Perhaps it
could be expressed something
like this: "Crap by any other
name, no matter how dressed
up, would still be crap."
No, it's not quite as eloquent
as Shakespeare's words, but it's
not meant to apply to a beautiful
play like "Romeo and Juliet."
Rather, it indicates the general
feelings conveyed by Andrew
Dice Clay's debut movie appear
ance in"The Adventures of Ford
Fairlane."
"Ford Fairlane" has it all: hot
babes, action, multiple cameos
by recognizable stars and hot
babes. While this may not be
everyone's dream-movie-come
true, it is even worse than it
sounds.
Basically, Andrew Dice Clay
has taken his crude stage act
and transformed it into a movie
character, Ford Fairlane — "The
Rock' N' Roll Detective." His
character, who "came from
Brooklyn to save the world," is
a raunchy private investigator
who specializes in the music in
dustry.

This entitles him to emotion
ally and verbally abuse the
hordes of women — all obviously
with high senses of self respect
— who fight over the chance to
sleep with him and his paunch
nightly. Additionally, he has the
power to call anyone that he
happens to dislike a "snapper
head." Does it sound unbearably
witty so far?
Well, you should try to follow
the plot. Director Renny Harlin,
who directed the hit "Die Hard
2: Die Harder," has really com
promised himself with this
movie. The film's storyline is
ridiculous, full of incredible,
idiotic twists like something
from an R-rated "Muppets"
movie.
In fact, one of the principal
stars is a stuffed koala who not
only sips mixed tropical drinks
but is also the target of the bad
guys, who hang him from a rope
attached to a ceiling fan. Even
Fairlane expresses some emo
tion in this pitiful attempt to
draw some emotional reaction
from the audience. Needless to
say, it is not — I repeat not —
a touching movie.
However, it does touch on
some important moral issues.
For example, Lauren Holly from
"All My Children" plays Fair
lane's receptionist/sidekick Jazz,
who secretly loves Fairlane
(don't all women?) but demands

respect from him. Thus, she
does whatever she can to help
his investigations, leaping into
a bosomy black dress at the
slightest hint that Fairlane is
interested in her romantically.
This magical study of human
relationships does not end there,
however. Bimbos and bozos
abound throughout this flick in
the various cameo performances
given. Wayne Newton, the "king
of Las Vegas entertainers,"
delivers a riveting performance
as bad guy Julian Grendel.
Other famous (infamous?)
names are Priscilla Presley, Ed
O' Neill from "Married with
Children," (Now there's an in
telligent show!), Morris Day,
Robert Englund, (who plays
Freddy Krueger in the
"Nightmare on Elm Street"
movies), and Gilbert Gottfried.
Actually, although the acting
is weak and the time on screen
is short, the cameos are the only
reason to even consider seeing
this movie, because it's interest
ing to see how all these people
make fools of themselves.
Admittedly, there are some
genuinely funny scenes in the
movie, yet often one can not
shake a sense of guilt because
Clay typically attains laughs at
the expense of some race, creed,
gender or way of life. Generally,

humor, lousy acting and virtually no plot, Clay's debut role will hopefully be his farewell performance as
well.
the humor is at sewer-level and,
though it is good to let loose
once in a while and see a dumb
movie that doesn't tax your
mind at all, this movie injects

more close-minded idiocy than
your relaxing mind may be will
ing to view.
Overall, "The Adventures of
Ford Fairlane" is a lousy at
tempt at a "comic thriller." The
acting is bad, the story is bad
and the jokes are bad. Save your
money and your brain, and stay
away from "Ford Fairlane."

the humor is at sewer-level and,
though it is good to let loose
once in a while and see a dumb
movie that doesn't tax your
mind at all, this movie injects

more close-minded idiocy than
your relaxing mind may be will
ing to view.
Overall, "The Adventures of
Ford Fairlane" is a lousy at
tempt at a "comic thriller." The
acting is bad, the story is bad
and the jokes are bad. Save your
money and your brain, and stay
away from "Ford Fairlane."
