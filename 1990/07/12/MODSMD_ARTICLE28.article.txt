# 'Ghost' is a ghastly flop of a film
## 
### Sarah Laurence 
What do you get when you cross Patrick
Swayze with Whoopi Goldberg? Demi Moore
knows, since her character Molly dances with
the ghost of her dead boyfriend Sam (Swayze)
while he is in tjie body of Goldberg, who plays
a psychic. Bizarre.
But don't be put off; the rest of the movie
is normal. In fact, it is far too normal. "Ghost"
feels hauntingly familiar, probably because Di
rector Jerry Zucker, the jet engine that
powered "Airplane," opts this time to ensure
a safe landing at the box office instead of a
thrilling ride.
What he ends up with is a series of unin
spired scenes that recall previous Swayze or
Goldberg films. The movie's only other dance
scene echoes "Dirty Dancing," updated only by
some hanky-panky with modeling clay and by
Moore's supposedly liberated character Molly,
who looks and acts more like a ten-year-old
boy than a mature woman.
Swayze better learn some new tricks soon,
since his high-school looks aren't going to last
forever. In the movie's final scene, Swayze,
bathed in unflattering light as he ascends to
heaven (no kidding!), looks positively
moribund.
Though Goldberg manages to inflate her flat
role a little, even she doesn't really act, since

she's one of those stars who always plays her
self.
The rare occasions that Zucker does use the
supernatural usually work. For instance, Sam's
ghost conquers the New York subway system
by jumping through the walls of one moving
train into another. But in less creative scenes,
such as when the bad guys' spirits get dragged
off by translucent Jawa-shaped demons, you
wish there were no such thing as ghosts.
If you watch "Ghost" in Cute Summer Movie
mode — which is the only way to eryoy the
flick — it's not easy to accept the fact that
Sam really is dead at the end of the film. His
death is especially hard to swallow since he
gets killed at the beginning of the film and
still manages to flit around for nearly two
disillusioning hours.
In sum, it's hard to say whether "Ghost" is
a tragedy you have to laugh at or a comedy
that fails tragically.
One thing, however, is clear: "Ghost" is
ghastly. The story of a deceased yuppie whose
spirit sticks around the world of the living to
avenge himself and slow-dance with his
girlfriend, "Ghost" makes more use of the my
thology surrounding its cast than of the infi
nitely more interesting supernatural.
This film slides neatly into the grave of this
summer's "ghost" movies. The best thing to
do with this film is quietly cover it with shovel
fuls of earth and forget about it.
