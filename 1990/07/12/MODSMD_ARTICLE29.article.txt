# Cenzo's appeals to all the senses
## 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
My first impression of
Cenzo's was determined pri
marily by my nose. The sensa
tional smell that hit me as I
rounded the corner of Uni
versity Avenue drew me to
the little restaurant — com
plete with green awnings —
which nestled unobtrusively
in a row of brick buildings.
This pleasant invasion of
the senses by no means stops
with the nose. Eyes and ears
can find a touch of romance
in the warm, soft; lighting,
Italian music and pastel
colors. Curtained half-walls
make the room cozy and
quiet, creating little niches
for tables, and mirrored
panels make sure that no one
feels claustrophobic.
A perusal through Cenzo's
extensive menu reveals that
this desirable setting is ac
companied by desirable —
and authentic — Italian
cuisine. The menu includes
selections of pizza, pasta,
chicken, veal and seafood, in
cluding a fresh fish special
every day. Enough of the
menu is written in Italian to
make you feel important, but
enough is in English to help
you out in case you don't
quite know your funghi from
your fettucine.
At $7-14 for an entr6e,
Cenzo's is reasonable for the
quality of the restaurant.
There is also a sizeable wine
list and even some Italian
beers for the adventurous to
try.
But how does Cenzo's hold
up to the test of the taste
buds? As with everything else
about the restaurant, beauti
fully.
Arriving as soon as we did
to our table were warm strips
of pizza dough topped with
butter and parmesan cheese,
a nice change from the usual
boring bread rolls.
From the large array of ap
petizers, we chose the thick,
rich onion soup — cheese
oozing over the side of the
crock — which was not too
salty, as is typically the case.
We also delighted in the
calamari, a heaping plate of

lightly breaded curls of squid,
dashed with lemon.
Choosing an entree was an
agonizing decision, because I
would have been happy with
any dish from the menu.
But then I remembered a
few weeks ago when, walking
randomly by Cenzo's, I heard
a woman tell her friends, "I
could have kissed the chef,
the scampi was so good, and
he made it especially for me!"
Well, with that kind of rec
ommendation, how could I
turn down the opportunity to
experience such culinary eu
phoria?
I was not disappointed. I
cannot remember ever eating
anything as good as these
jumbo prawns in creamy
white champagne sauce. My
partner tried the fresh fish
special of the day, grilled sal
mon, which was also excellent
and cooked to perfection,
flaky under a light coat of
herbs and lemon.
The side dishes were un
remarkable, but it didn't mat
ter since we didn't have room
to finish them. That is, of
course, because we wanted to
save that last inch of space
for dessert.
After perusing yet another
tantalizing array of tradi
tional Italian and other
delicious-sounding choices,
we tried the Tartuffo, which
is chocolate and vanilla Ital
ian ice cream encased in a
chocolate shell.
It was very good, though a
little too icy and not creamy
enough for my taste.
Better, however, is the
Chocolate Mousse Cake,
which was our waiter's favor
ite and is now one of mine.
With a thick layer of mousse
on top of a layer of chocolate
cake, it is not too rich after
a big meal, and is perfect to
enjoy with a cup of cappuc
cino.
Cenzo's is a versatile res
taurant where couples linger
to chat, where an old man
sits and finishes a crossword
puzzle or where a family
toasts some special event. Its
comfortable atmosphere and
incredible food bring the best
of Italian cuisine closer for
everyone.
