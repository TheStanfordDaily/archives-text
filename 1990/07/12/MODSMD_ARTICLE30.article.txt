# Chapman show is superb, yet somber

Tracy Chapman, mouth
piece for the politically con
cerned and the lost in love,
is the quintessential singer
for today's college student.
And Berkeley's Greek
Theater, an outdoor amphi
theater attracting Birken
stock-clad clientele, is the ul
timate spot for a university
gathering.
Hence, it was the perfect
setting for the perfect con
cert. As the sun slipped below
the horizon, leaving a trail of
pink fog, Chapman, with her
jeans and guitar, sang of so
cial oppression and relation
ships gone sour.
The concert, held last Sat
urday night, was the last in
Chapman's "Crossroads"
tour. It had originally been
set for May, but was res
cheduled because of rain.
Chapman, a black, self
proclaimed lesbian, sings
songs with an appeal that
crosses over all boundaries of
age, gender and sexual orien
tation. The universality" of
her music was evident in the
broad spectrum of people at
tending the concert — young
and old, black and white, male
and female, heterosexual and
homosexual.
Instead of opening with a
song from her new album,
"Crossroads," Chapman sur
prised the crowd with "Across
the Lines," a song from her
self-titled debut album, re
leased in 1988.
The concert was divided

into three parts. In the first
20-minute segment, Chap
man played both old and new
songs with her backup band,
which consisted of two per
cussionists, one bass player
and one electric guitarist.
Their music complemented
Chapman, who played an
acoustic guitar, but the most
powerful element in the en
semble was clearly her voice.
The next segment, a solo
set, featured Chapman's
strong voice, as she sang a
collection of old songs, includ
ing "Baby Can I Hold You,"
a classic ballad about unre
quited love, and "Fast Car,"
a song about dreams of escape
from inner-city poverty.
The crowd was soon at its
feet, with screams of "We love
you, Tracy!"
Chapman, however, seldom
spoke to the audience; it was
only through her music that
she connected to the crowd.
She also performed songs
which did not appear on
either of her two albums.
She also sang an emotion
ally charged version of
"Why?," a song filled with un
answered questions about
world injustice.
As a final note, be advised
to take your own beverages
when attending events at the
Greek Theatre. On all other
counts, prices at Berkeley
may run cheaper than at the
Farm, but a cup of tap water
will cost you $1.75 at the con
cession stand of this other
wise idyllic concert spot.
