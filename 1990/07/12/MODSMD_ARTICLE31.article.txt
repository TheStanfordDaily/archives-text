# 'The Sandman' reads like a dream
## 
### Greg: Douglas Editorial staff 
The world of dreams is a strange and incom
prehensible place. Whenever we enter its gates
we are in unfamiliar, sometimes entrancing,
sometimes frightening territory.
The realm of dreams and their creation is the
focus of interest in Neil Gaiman's "The Sandman:
The Doll's House." Published by DC Comics, it
is a graphic novel which follows Dream, the
master of his domain, through several different
experiences in the dream world.
Dream is not your ordinary hero. Although he
possesses a likable sense of morality, he is
dominated by an adherence to The Rules — a
code which the immortal beings, the Endless,
follow in shaping the lives of humans.
Dream's siblings, however, are bored with The
Rules. As members of the Endless beings, his
relatives Desire, Destiny and Despair try to break
The Rules a little bit in order to have some fun.
Dream seems to be the only one of them who
has a sense of purpose and responsibility.
Dream'B underlings also create problems for
the smooth operation of the dream realm. The
entities that Dream creates to serve him by per
forming different roles in human dreams rebel
against his rule, wreaking havoc in the dreams
— and therefore the realities — of humankind.
Dream's swift retribution illuminates the pos
sibilities inherent in this world of tangible images:
He tells two of his insubordinate creations, Brute
and Glob, that he won't destroy them for their
disobedience, although they "probably won't enjoy
the next few thousand years."
At the center of all the stories is a young
woman, Rose Walter, who is the "dream vortex"
of this era. A dream vortex is a person who has
the power to reach, unknowingly, beyond the
scope of her own dreams and link all the dreams
of the world together.
Such a merging, however, has catastrophic con
sequences. When it happened once before, it
destroyed a whole world's population because
everyone saw the innermost desires and fears of
everyone else, and the pressure of such knowledge
killed the entire race.
Thus, it is Dream's duty to kill the vortex,
even though she is a very innocent and lovely
woman. This weighs heavily upon his heart, yet
he is prepared stoically to uphold the Rules.
Fortunately for Dream, but unfortunately for
the novel, an easy solution is found that detracts

from the intrigue of the ordeal through which
Dream and Rose would have gone. This is the
underlying problem with this work: despite good
art, well-developed and interesting characters and
an intriguing storyline, the tale concludes too
easily in a mostly happy manner.
Don't be fooled, though; there is a lot that is
unhappy about this comic as well. Several of the
nightmares that Dream has created are depicted,
often quite graphically, in the course of the story.
For example, a nightmare named The Corinthian
has left the dream world and sustains a penchant
for devouring the eyes of young boys. This kind
of material definitely requires a mature reader.
Generally, "A Doll's House" is very good; how
ever, something is lacking in the conclusion. At
$12.95 for a 250 page work, it's a good buy, and
there is a lot of potential in the framework of
"The Sandman" which is untapped as of yet.
Look forward with anticipation to upcoming
"Sandman" stories.
