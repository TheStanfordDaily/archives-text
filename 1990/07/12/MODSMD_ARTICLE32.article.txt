## Evans bests East Germans in Santa Clara Backstroker Rouse also triumphs in warmup meet 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. - A
lot has changed in East Ger
many over the past two years.
The Berlin Wall has come down,
a political and economic bond is
being formed with West Ger
many and capitalism is taking
root.
But while the changes are
taking place, there remains one
constant: The East German
3wim team is very strong, but
cannot beat Janet Evans.
The Stanford sophomore, who
won three gold medals in the
1988 Olympics, won two events
at the Alamo Invitational over
the weekend at the Santa Clara
International Swim Center.
Her perfomance was over
shadowed by that of the Ger
mans, making their first appear
ance at the meet in 16 years.
East Germans combined to win
seven events over the three-day
meet, including wins by Nils
Rudolph in both the 50-meter
and 100-meter freestyle.
Rudolph upset favored Ameri
cans Matt Biondi and Tom Jager
in both races.
While the competition was
high, the times were not that
fast, as most of the competitors
were using the meet as prepera
tion for other meets. The East
Germans and others will be
competing in the Goodwill
Games in Seattle, beginning a
week from tomorrow. Most of
the Americans, including almost
the entire Stanford contingent,
will participate in the U.S. Long
Course Championships in Aus
tin, Texas, the first week of Au
gust.
Evans won the 400-meter in
dividual medley Friday and the

-400-meter freestyle Saturday
before taking third in the 200-
meter IM Sunday. The winner
of that race was Summer
Sanders, who will join Evans on
the U.S. squad at the Goodwill
Games. Sanders, from Roseville,
Calif., will be a Cardinal fresh
man in the fall.
"It was an outstanding 200
IM," said Richard Quick, the
Stanford and Goodwill Games
women's coach.
Evans, who concentrates on
longer races than the 200 IM,
agreed. "I think she's swimming
great," Evans said of her
teammate-to-be. "I think she'll
have a great summer."
Evans was also pleased with
her own performances. "I was
really happy with my 400 free
style because Heike Friedrich
(the runner-up from East Ger
many) is one of the top swim
mers in the w0r1d.... I'm ex
cited to swim (at the Goodwill
Games) against the East Ger
mans and the Australians and
everybody. It'll be the first time
I'll swim against the East Ger
mans tapered and shaved since
the Olympics."
In one of the biggest upsets
of the meet, USC's Terri
O'Loughlin edged sophomore
Janel Jorgensen in the 100-
meter butterfly. Jorgensen
defeated O'Loughlin to win that
event at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships and at the
NCAA Championships, but
O'Loughlin surprised the Car
dinal Olympian Saturday.
"I didn't like it and she didn't
like it," Quick said of Jorgen
sen's defeat, "but she's going to
go great at the Goodwill
Games."
Jorgensen and O'Loughlin are
the two U.S. entrants in the 100-

meter butterfly at that meet.
For the Cardinal men, junior
Jeff Rouse was the meet's high
light. He defeated two top East
Germans to win the 100-meter
backstroke in 57.26 Friday and
swam a phenomenal 56.17 to
lead off the Cardinal 400-meter
medley relay team Sunday.
Junior Jason Plummer
reached the finals in three
events, junior Andy Lloyd
finalled twice and junior Alex
Kostich placed fourth in both
the 1,500-meter freestyle and
the 400-meter IM. Kostich will
swim both the 800- and 1,500-
meter freestyles at the Goodwill
Games.
On the women'B side, Sanders
added a second in the 200-meter
butterfly and a fifth in the 100-
meter backstroke. June gradu
ate Bethanne Lambert placed
third in the 200-meter breast
stroke and junior Karen
Kraemer had four top-six
placingß in the three days.
June graduate Jill Johnson
placed sixth in the 200-meter
breaststroke, an event she will
swim for the U.S. in Seattle,
and junior Dede Trimble placed
fourth in both backstroke
events. She will swim the 200-
meter backstroke at the Good
will Games.
Card notes
Texas senior Leigh Ann Fetter
has been the best sprint freestyler
in the nation for two or three years
now but that doesn't mean her
coach still doesn't under-estimate
her. Longhorn Coach Mark
Schubert apparently promised her
a powdered doughnut for every
hundredth she swam under 26.78.
Considering she went 26.97 in qual-
