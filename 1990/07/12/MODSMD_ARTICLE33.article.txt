## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
While a lot of Stanford baseball
play era spend the summer in class to
get ahead in their studies, three Car
dinal juniors are doing their learning
elsewhere.
Shortstop Roger Burnett, first base
man David McCarty and catcher Troy
Tallman are all playing for the U.S.
national team this summer and the
squad is off to a fine start. The U.S
team is currently 11-4 and is unde
feated in its home country.
The Americans handily won their
first four games in Tennessee before
traveling to Japan for a five-game tour.
The Cardinal players joined the team
right before the Japan trip, where the
Americans pulled out only one of five
close games.
The U.S. Bquad then returned to its
home base in Tennessee and played
several more games. The team is cur
rently 3-0 after completing the first
round of a double round-robin tour
nament in Tennessee.
After finishing that tournament the
U.S. team will travel to the Goodwill
Games to represent the U.S. there.
The squad will open with an historical
game against a team from the Soviet
Union.
After concluding the Goodwill
Games the team wili venture farther
north to meet the world's best at the
World Championships. That tourna
ment, held in August in Edmonton,
Alberta, will be used to determine
which teams qualify for the Olympic

games in 1992.
Baseball will be a full medal sport
in Barcelona after being an exhibition
sport in the 1988 Games. Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess coached the
1988 U.S. team to a gold medal in
Seoul.
Burnett, McCarty and Tallman were
three big reasons the Cardinal had its
best season ever in 1990. After posting
a 30-28 record the previous year with
those three players often in the line-up
as freshmen, Stanford rebounded to
go 59-12 this year.
The team lost to eventual NCAA
champion Georgia in the semifinals of
the College World Series.
Burnett has already proven himself
to be the best defensive shortstop in
school history. He made almost every
Elay look easy this season and hit .270.
Ie hit eight home runs and stole seven
bases in seven tries.
McCarty started every game at first
for Stanford this season and hit .336.
He was second on the team in RBIs
with 69 and hit 12 homers.
Tallman was the team's top signal
caller. Despite batting low in the order,
he had a strong final two-thirds of
the season, hitting over .300 in that
period. He hit 10 homers and drove
in 33 runs in 58 starts.
Card notes
Stanford freshman center fielder Jeff
Hammond* was named the Baseball Amer
ica Freshman of the Year earlier this week.
Hammonds set school records with 48
stolen bases, 83 runs and a 37-game hitting
streak, and hit .355 to lead the Cardinal.
