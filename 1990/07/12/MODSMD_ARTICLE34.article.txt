# Whiting's West squad takes festival silver

In her Olympic Festival debut last
year, basketball player Val Whiting was
a nervous high school senior who just
wanted to help her team. This year, she's
back as a confident college star who's
expected to lead her team.
That's what playing for a national
champion can do for you.
Whiting, a key figure on Stanford's
1990 NCAA championship team, dis
played her value in a big way Saturday,
scoring 22 points in sparking the West
to an 87-76 victory over the South in
the opening round of Olympic Festival
basketball competition.
The West is currently 2-1 after round
robin play and will meet the East for
the gold medal.
"I didn't score as well at the festival
last year, but I don't put playing well
and scoring in the same basket," Whiting
said.
"I think if you play well, you can help
the team by doing other things, like
rebounding and playing defense. That's
what I tried to do last year. The difference
this year is that my offensive game has
come together."
And how.
Whiting scored 10 points in the first
3 minutes, 9 seconds of the game to give
the West a quick lead it never relin
quished. And the 6-foot-3 center was just
as strong at the end, scoring six points
in the final minute.
"Playing a year of college helps,"
Whiting said. "Being at a Top 10 school,

having a great coach, all of that makes
you a better player. It gave me confidence
as an individual.
"But I didn't think that just because
I came from a national championship
team that I would do better than anyone
else here."
The truth of the matter is, she was
better than anyone else, especially at the
start of the game when she was simply
unstoppable.
Less than 30 seconds into the game,
Whiting took a pass 10 feet from the
basket, wheeled on Marsha Williams and
banked in a basket as Williams fouled
her. Whiting sank the free throw to com
plete the three-point play, then posted
up for another inside basket at the 19:18
mark.
Forty seconds later, she stole the ball
at the South end and dribbled three
fourths of the court for a layup to make
it 7-1. With 16:41 left. Whiting rebounded
a teammate's miss, scored while drawing
another foul from Williams and con
verted a second three-point play.
"That did set the tempo for the game,"
said West Coach Trish Roberts of Maine.
"Our offense is not designed for any one
particular person. It just so happened
that she was open."
Sunday, the West fell to the undefeated
East 64-62. It was the second straight
close call for the East, which beat the
North 81-80 in overtime Saturday.
Tammi Reiss of Virginia led the East
with 19 points afler scoring 20 on Sat
urday. Whiting scored 14 for the West.
The meeting was revenge of sorts for
Reiss as her Cavalier team fell to
Whiting's Cardinal squad at this year's
