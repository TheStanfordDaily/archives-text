# Germans dominate Argentina in Cup
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After opening the World
Cup with a loss to unheralded
Cameroon, after scoring only
two goals in three single
elimination games and after
having four players
suspended in the champion
ship game, it seemed it was
only a matter of time before
Argentina's luck ran out.
As it was, it ended up being
about 84 minutes.
The Argentines were totally
outplayed by West Germany
in the world's most widely
watched sporting event Sun
day, but the defending cham
pions had been able to dodge
every bullet. But with only
about six minutes remaining
in the game Robert Sensini
tripped Rudi Voeller in the
penalty box. Andreas
Brehme's penalty kick darted
just between the left post and
the outstreched arms of
goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea,
and the Germans had their
third World Cup champion
ship.
West Germany, Italy and
Brazil are the only teams to
have won soccer's top prize
three times. Argentina has
taken home the title twice.
The game seemed the per
fect end to the World Cup of
the penalty kick. Both teams
used the oft-criticized tie
breaking method to advance
to the final and it looked as
though the championship
game might also be decided
by the best-of-flve shootout.
The Germans, much as
they did in their semifinal
contest against England, con
trolled the ball and got many
opportunities but seemed un
able to find the goal. Against
Argentina they sent nearly a
dozen shots over or around
the goal.
On the other end, however,
Argentina could manage only
one shot, a free kick Diego
Maradona sent well over the
crossbar. In fact, Argentina's
best scoring chance came
when Brehme passed the ball
back to his goalkeeper, Bodo
Illgner. The pass looked more
like a shot, high and towards
the left corner of the German
goal, but Illgner corralled it.
The Germans seemed to
win every free ball and always

had more players around the
action, especially after Argen
tine defender Pedro Monzon
received a red card and was
ejected midway through the
second half. It was the first
red card ever in a World Cup
championship game.
After the penalty kick, Gus
tavo Dezotti was also red
carded, and the Argentines
finished the game two men
down.
German Coach Franz Be
ckenbauer became the first
person to be both the captain
and the head coach for a*
World Cup winner. He cap
tained the German squad
that won in 1974. The na
tion's first World Cup tri
umph was in 1954.
West Germany had lost the
two previous World Cup
finals, to Italy in 1982 and
to Argentina in 1986.
In the third-place game Sal
vatore Schillaci also scored on
a penalty kick with six
minutes remaining in the
game to give Italy a 2-1 vic
tory over England. The goal
was Schillaci's sixth of the
tournament, giving him the
Golden Boot Award as the top
goal-scorer.
He scored once in each of
Italy's games except for the
1-0 victory over the United
States. Five of six goals were
game-winners to set an all
time record.
Italy opened the scoring
when English goalkeeper
Peter Shilton, the most expe
rienced player ever in World
Cup play, allowed Roberto
Baggio to steal the ball from
him. Baggio passed to Schil
laci, who then fed Baggio in
front of the open net in the
70th minute.
The English soon
responded, however. With
only 10 minutes remaining in
the game, Steven Piatt took
a cross and headed it into the
upper left corner. It was only
the second goal Italy's Walter
Zenga gave up in seven games
in the World Cup.
The 1994 World Cup will
be played at sites throughout
the United States. While the
specific 12 sites have not been
determined, the U.S. Soccer
Federation has expressed an
interest in using Stanford
Stadium.
