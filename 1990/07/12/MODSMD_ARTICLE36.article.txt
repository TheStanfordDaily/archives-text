The Raychem Stanford Diving
Cup meet was designed to iden
tify the best divers of the West
Coast, and it did just that over
the weekend.
It also showed that most of
them dive for Rick Schavone's
Stanford club team.
Schavone has been the diving
coach at Stanford since 1979 and
has taken the Cardinal varsity
from anonymity to near the top
of the national heap. He has
done the same with his club pro
gram and his divers won eight
of the 13 titles at the meet this
weekend.
The meet, which was held at
deGuerre Pool Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, was the first time
ever that age-group divers com
peted in a cup format. Eight
divers entered each competition
and the top four advanced to
the semifinals. The top two
there then advanced to the
finals where they went head-to
head.
While watching the competi
tion in the senior category,
Schavone may have realized that
his club program has been too
successful. In the finals of both
the men's and women's three
meter competition Schavone
coached divers defeated Stan
ford students.
SMU'B Sean Briscombe
defeated sophomore Mark
Kraus to win the men's title
while on the women's side Brig
ham Young's Courtney Nelson
defeated junior Kristin Jensen
for the top spot.
Nelson won the NCAA plat
form title for the Cougars this
past March.
Briscombe, Nelson and Jensen
then flew to Minneapolis to com
pete in the Olympic Festival.
Nelson will go from there to the
Goodwill Games in Seattle,
where she will compete in the
three-meter event. Schavone is
one of three coaches selected to
the U.S. Goodwill Games staff.
