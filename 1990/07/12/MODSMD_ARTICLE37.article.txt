# Navratilova, Edberg are the best at Wimbledon again
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
The numbers added up to a
coveted place in tennis history
for Martina Navratilova.
A follower of numerology, the
left-hander grabbed her record
ninth Wimbledon singles cham
pionship Saturday and set her
sights on the best figure of all
- No. 1.
Navratilova said her latest
title was the toughest of the
bunch. But she also said that,
at almost 34 years old, she's
playing some of the best tennis
of her life.
"In a way, I'm a better player
than I was was in '84 when I
was dominating," she said. "I
think I would beat myself from
'84 or '85. I know I've added
some shots, but I really under
stand the game a lot better
now."
The 6-4, 6-1 victory over fifth
seeded Zina Garrison before
eight former champions and
13,000 other fans on Centre
Court earned Navratilova
$352,000. But more importantly
for her was the position it se
cured — the winningest singles
champion in the most pres
tigious tournament in tennis.

She had previously been tied
with Helen Wills Moody at eight
Wimbledon singles titles apiece.
Sunday Stefan Edberg rallied
fron 3-1 down in the final set
to defeat Boris .Becker 6-2, 6 2,
3-6, 3-6, 6-4 in the men's singles
final. It was the third consecu
tive Wimbledon final between
those two players, the first time
that had happened in the 20th
century.
Edberg played some of the
best tennis he had ever played
to blaze through the first two
sets, but then the 22-year-old
Becker began to show why he
has already won three Wimble
don titles. Becker broke Edberg
to go up 3-1 in the fifth and it
appeared to be curtains for the
Swede who makes his home in
London.
But Edberg broke right back
and broke again at 4-all before
serving out the set. It was his
second Wimbledon crown with
the earlier one also coming over
Becker in 1988.
"This tops it all," Nav
ratrilova said. "I worked so long
and so hard for it. They say
good things are worth waiting
for and this one definitely was."
Garrison, playing for a Grand
Slam title for the first time —
compared with 30 for Nav

ratilova — found it difficult to
understand just what had been
accomplished.
"I can't even comprehend one
(championship)," she said.
"That's unrealistic. That's just
amazing that someone can do
that. She really believes that
this is her court and that no
one can take it away from her."
It was all in the numbers,
Navratilova said: "I'm 33, and
three times three is nine."
Tennis is increasingly
dominated by young players.
Monica Seles, 16, is third in the
world and right on Navratilova's
tail. A 14-year-old, Jennifer
Capriati, ranked 12th in the
world, reached the semifinals at
the French Open and the fourth
round here, and is already
judged a future champion. And
the top-ranked player, Steffi
Graf, is barely 21.
But in a year when 43-year
old Nolan Ryan pitched his sixth
no-hitter and 45-year-old Hale
Irwin won the U.S. Open, Nav
ratilova is another old-timer
turning the tables on the kids.
And she's not about to stop.
"I'm going for double digits.
Why not?" Navratilova said.
A 10th singles victory here
would leave her two champion
ships behind Billie Jean King's

Wimbledon record of 20, in
singles and doubles. King has
helped coach Navratilova for the
last 14 months.
"I don't know how much
longer she's going to want to be
helping me now," Navratilova
said. "She may just pick up her
rackets and play some. She's got
some goals and she can play dou
bles."
Navratilova's own immediate
goal is to win the U.S. Open in
September. A four-time winner
in New York, she lost in the
final there to Graf last year and,
with the West German reeling
from problems on and off the
court, sees a chance
to regain the top spot in the
rankings.
"It would be nice to win in
the States," she said. "If I do
that, I'm No. 1 for the year, so
that would be nice, too."
Graf had defeated Navratilova
in the Wimbledon final the past
two years and many had ex
pected them to meet again this
time. Garrison upset Graf in the
semifinals, but Navratilova said
that took none of the edge off
her victory.
"It would have been more fit
ting (to play Graf), but at the
same time obviously Zina earned
her place there," the champion

said. "I think the event over
takes the person that you end
up beating, so it doesn't take
anything away from the incred
ible joy that I have about win
ning it."
Garrison won the first game
at love and had a break point
for 2-0 before Navratilova
turned the match around. She
held for 1-1 and allowed only
one more break point in the
match, saving that in the third
game of the second set on three
backhand errors.
Garrison had problems with
her backhand all day, making
22 errors on the stroke. The
final point of the match came
on a Garrison backhand that
sailed over the baseline; Nav
ratilova watched it fly past,
thrust her fists in the air and
beamed. The victory she wanted
most of all finally was hers.
Garrison did find some solace
in winning the mixed doubles
title along with Rick Leach.
Leach and Jim Pugh won the
men's doubles title and Jana
Novatna and Helena Sukova
took the women's doubles.
Stanford graduate Patty Fen
dick advanced to the women's
doubles semifinals along with
Garrison before finally bowing
out.
The numbers added up to a
coveted place in tennis history
for Martina Navratilova.

dick advanced to the women's
doubles semifinals along with
Garrison before finally bowing
out.
The numbers added up to a
coveted place in tennis history
for Martina Navratilova.
A follower of numerology, the
left-hander grabbed her record
ninth Wimbledon singles cham
pionship Saturday and set her
sights on the best figure of all
- No. 1.
Navratilova said her latest
title was the toughest of the
bunch. But she also said that,
at almost 34 years old, she's
playing some of the best tennis
of her life.
"In a way, I'm a better player
than I was was in '84 when I
was dominating," she said. "I
think I would beat myself from
'84 or '85. I know I've added
some shots, but I really under
stand the game a lot better
now."
The 6-4, 6-1 victory over fifth
seeded Zina Garrison before
eight former champions and
13,000 other fans on Centre
Court earned Navratilova
$352,000. But more importantly
for her was the position it se
cured — the winningest singles
champion in the most pres
tigious tournament in tennis.

She had previously been tied
with Helen Wills Moody at eight
Wimbledon singles titles apiece.
Sunday Stefan Edberg rallied
fron 3-1 down in the final set
to defeat Boris .Becker 6-2, 6 2,
3-6, 3-6, 6-4 in the men's singles
final. It was the third consecu
tive Wimbledon final between
those two players, the first time
that had happened in the 20th
century.
Edberg played some of the
best tennis he had ever played
to blaze through the first two
sets, but then the 22-year-old
Becker began to show why he
has already won three Wimble
don titles. Becker broke Edberg
to go up 3-1 in the fifth and it
appeared to be curtains for the
Swede who makes his home in
London.
But Edberg broke right back
and broke again at 4-all before
serving out the set. It was his
second Wimbledon crown with
the earlier one also coming over
Becker in 1988.
"This tops it all," Nav
ratrilova said. "I worked so long
and so hard for it. They say
good things are worth waiting
for and this one definitely was."
Garrison, playing for a Grand
Slam title for the first time —
compared with 30 for Nav

ratilova — found it difficult to
understand just what had been
accomplished.
"I can't even comprehend one
(championship)," she said.
"That's unrealistic. That's just
amazing that someone can do
that. She really believes that
this is her court and that no
one can take it away from her."
It was all in the numbers,
Navratilova said: "I'm 33, and
three times three is nine."
Tennis is increasingly
dominated by young players.
Monica Seles, 16, is third in the
world and right on Navratilova's
tail. A 14-year-old, Jennifer
Capriati, ranked 12th in the
world, reached the semifinals at
the French Open and the fourth
round here, and is already
judged a future champion. And
the top-ranked player, Steffi
Graf, is barely 21.
But in a year when 43-year
old Nolan Ryan pitched his sixth
no-hitter and 45-year-old Hale
Irwin won the U.S. Open, Nav
ratilova is another old-timer
turning the tables on the kids.
And she's not about to stop.
"I'm going for double digits.
Why not?" Navratilova said.
A 10th singles victory here
would leave her two champion
ships behind Billie Jean King's

Wimbledon record of 20, in
singles and doubles. King has
helped coach Navratilova for the
last 14 months.
"I don't know how much
longer she's going to want to be
helping me now," Navratilova
said. "She may just pick up her
rackets and play some. She's got
some goals and she can play dou
bles."
Navratilova's own immediate
goal is to win the U.S. Open in
September. A four-time winner
in New York, she lost in the
final there to Graf last year and,
with the West German reeling
from problems on and off the
court, sees a chance
to regain the top spot in the
rankings.
"It would be nice to win in
the States," she said. "If I do
that, I'm No. 1 for the year, so
that would be nice, too."
Graf had defeated Navratilova
in the Wimbledon final the past
two years and many had ex
pected them to meet again this
time. Garrison upset Graf in the
semifinals, but Navratilova said
that took none of the edge off
her victory.
"It would have been more fit
ting (to play Graf), but at the
same time obviously Zina earned
her place there," the champion

said. "I think the event over
takes the person that you end
up beating, so it doesn't take
anything away from the incred
ible joy that I have about win
ning it."
Garrison won the first game
at love and had a break point
for 2-0 before Navratilova
turned the match around. She
held for 1-1 and allowed only
one more break point in the
match, saving that in the third
game of the second set on three
backhand errors.
Garrison had problems with
her backhand all day, making
22 errors on the stroke. The
final point of the match came
on a Garrison backhand that
sailed over the baseline; Nav
ratilova watched it fly past,
thrust her fists in the air and
beamed. The victory she wanted
most of all finally was hers.
Garrison did find some solace
in winning the mixed doubles
title along with Rick Leach.
Leach and Jim Pugh won the
men's doubles title and Jana
Novatna and Helena Sukova
took the women's doubles.
Stanford graduate Patty Fen
dick advanced to the women's
