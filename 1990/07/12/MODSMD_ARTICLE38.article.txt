# Americans two-hit NL for 2-0 win
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Not even rain could water
down what American League pitching did in the
All-Star game. In the year of no-hitters, the Na
tional League simply had no hitters.
The Nationals were held to a record-low two
hits and Julio Franco followed a 68-minute rain
delay by lining a two-run double in the seventh
inning Tuesday night as the Americans won 2-0
for their third straight victory and fourth in five
years.
The Americans managed just seven hits, but
that was enough for their longest winning streak
since 1946-49 as they narrowed the gap in the
series to 37-23-1.
Never before had an All-Star team been held
to fewer than three hits, but Bob Welch, Dave
Stieb, Bret Saberhagen, Bobby Thigpen, Chuck
Finley and Dennis Eckersley combined to do it
for the AL's second shutout, the first coming in
1946.

"You're not going to beat too many people with
two hits," said NL manager Roger Craig who
used a record nine pitchers.
Will Clark's line-drive single to center field
with two outs in the first and Len Dykstra's
leadoff single in the ninth was all the Nationals
could muster.
The start of the game was delayed 17 minutes
by rain and Franco's go-ahead hit off Rob Dibble
came after a wait of more than an hour.
Loser Jeff Brantley, who retired Cecil Fielder
on a fly ball with the bases loaded to end the
sixth, gave up singles to Sandy Alomar, who slid
into first to beat shortstop Shawon Dunston's
long throw, and Lance Parrish to start the
seventh.
With the rain coming down harder, the umpires
stopped the game. When it resumed, Dibble
relieved and Franco hit an 0-2 pitch up the right
center field alley.
