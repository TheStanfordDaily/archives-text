# For Suzanna Mak, service has been a way of life

Marian Wright Edelman was a particularly in
spiring commencement speaker for Class of 1990
graduate Suzanna Mak.
"'Service is the rent that everyone pays,'" Mak
quoted Edelman as saying. "I really believe that."
Mak, the 1990 recipient of the J. E. Wallace
Sterling Award for Service, has contributed a
great deal during her four years at Stanford.
The citation on the award, given to Mak by
the Stanford Alumni Association on June 16,
praises her "articulateness, persuasiveness and
energies as a coalition builder, whatever the au
dience."
Mak's activism began during her sophomore
year when she started the Athlete's Fund for the
Individual Recognition of Excellence (AFIRE). In
high school, Mak was a nationally-ranked
equestrian, but because of the high cost of at
tending Stanford, her family could not afford to
let her continue with the sport.
Although the Department of Athletics funded
team sports and club sports, prior to AFIRE,
funding for individual athletes did not exist. Be
cause of Mak's efforts, the department gave
$20,000 to establish AFIRE.
"We were very successful," Mak said. "In our
first year, AFIRE sent two of its athletes to the
Olympics."
As a junior, Mak became interested in the issue
of rape, primarily acquaintance rape.
"I wanted to work with an issue that was really
affecting people at Stanford," Mak said. "I
realized that there was a huge population that
needs to know about sexual assault issues."
Mak started Project HEAR (Heighten Educa
tion on Acquaintance Rape), a group that presents
hour-long workshops to residences about the is
sues surrounding acquaintance rape.
The workshops contain two role plays in which
a male presenter and a female presenter re-enact
a dating situation that ends in rape. The members
of the audience are asked to raise their hands
when they feel there is danger of rape in the
situation.
After the scene is completed, the presenters
discuss the role-playing excercise with the audi

ence, exploring the different interpretations that
men and women might have of tne situation.
The six-member group gave 43 presentations
during the 1989-90 school year. Mak estimated
that the group reached over 1,000 students.
Project HEAR also distributed cards printed
by the Stanford Police Department, giving infor
mation about what to do if one is raped.
Sergeant Chris Lefferts praised Mak, calling
her "hard-working and dedicated." He noted that
due to Project HEAR's education, more members
of the Stanford community became aware of
sexual assault issues, which contributed to more
women reporting rapes to the police.
Mak said she believed the University should
work to educate the community about attempted
assaults in order to avoid more rapes like the
June 16 incident in the Foothills.
Mak became recognized around campus for her
efforts with Project HEAR. "I would go to a
formal and the people there would say, 'Aren't
you the rape girl?" Mak laughed.
Mak also served as a member of the Task Force
for the Prevention and Education of Sexual As
sault. Through the organization, she worked to
convince the University to provide an advocate
for rape victoms. In January, she was in charge
of the proposal — which outlines three options
for rape victims — that the task force released.
Pat Fabiano, director of the student health
program at Cowell Student Health Center, who
nominated Mak for the Sterling Award, observed
that Mak's contribution to the task force was
invaluable.
"Stanford will remain proud of Suzanna," she
said.
Mak was also active in other forms of public
service, participating as a Big Sister in the Friends
for Youth program, tutoring a blind girl in
geometry and working with the San Francisco
AIDS foundation.
She served as a Resident Assistant in Mirrielees
during her junior year, and became head RA
during her senior year.
This fall Mak, who maiored in East Asian
Studies, will begin law school at the University
of Hawaii. She said she plans to pursue a career
in public-interest law.
