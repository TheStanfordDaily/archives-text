# A 						summertime chat with President Kennedy
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
As Stanford celebrates its
100 th year, Donald Kennedy
completes the first decade of his
term as the University's presi
dent.
In his ten years at the helm,
Kennedy has witnessed the re
placement of Western Culture
with Culture, Ideas and Values,
a change in management at the
Hoover Institution and massive
construction on campus. He has
also watched Stanford rise to
the top of the college rankings.
Now Kennedy is presiding
over a $22 million budget re
duction and repositioning move
ment that has been hailed by
some as foresighted and pro
gressive, and cursed by others
as debilitating.
Slightly graying, but still re
ported to run the Dish every
morning at 6 a.m., Kennedy
speaks seriously but has no
problem with letting down his
guard to crack a joke.
Yesterday morning Kennedy
talked to The Daily about issues
facing the University this sum
mer: the budget, drug use
among employees, campus
safety and his future.
How severe are Stanford's
budget problems, really? There
was a story in The New York
Times which indicated that it
isn't so much of a crisis now,
but Stanford is preparing for
the future.
Well, I think that's exactly
right. I think that The New York
Times reporter understood the
problem very well. We have to
be foresighted and we have to
be tough on ourselves. The
Times, I think, correctly identi
fied us as preparing for the fu
ture and that's what we think
we're doing.
With these budget cuts come
the proposed layoffs of over 100
employees ....
We don't know exactly how
many people we're going to have
to lay off. A lot depends on
people thinking about their own
futures and making decisions in
advance on what happens
through normal attrition.
We believe at the moment that
we are going to have to do some
of that, but all we have in front
of us so far are estimates.
When will you know the
precise figures?
It will be a moving target, as
normal attrition and people's
own choices run along expecta
tions.
Do you see departments biting
the bullet on the cuts or drag
ging their feet ?
There's all sorts of responses.
I would say that most adminis
trators have been very good
about recognizing the reality
and planning intelligently for it.
We have been offered very few
Washington Monuments.
It's an old government joke
that when there are budget cuts
demanded by OMB [Office of
Management and Budget], the
departments put up tneir cut
items. And the joke is that the
National Park Service always
listed at the top of their cut list
staffing [at] the Washington
Monument, which of course
would infuriate all those coming
to visit their senators and con
gressmen and taking a tour of
the capitol. And nobody would
dare cut that.
So Washington Monument
strategy is a metaphor for of
fering to cut something you

know they won't let you cut. In
other words, it's a gaming of
the system, and there's been
very little gaming of the system.
Several of the RFs have ques
tioned the massive cuts intended
for Residential Education ....
They protested them and a
whole bunch of hearings were
held and a lot of the cuts were
restored in the end. There have
been some program reductions
and in a few cases a reduction
in the number of RAs, but the
resident fellows' programs are
really in pretty good shape.
I've met with the resident fel
lows and we had a frank discus
sion of their needs. Already by
that time there was some step
ping back from the cuts. And
while I won't sit here and tell
you that they're all satisfied
now, certainly they're much less
dissatisfied than they were after
the first rounds of announce
ments.
I think we try to be responsive
to arguments on the other side,
arguments that say, "Look,
we're performing a vital func
tion and there's too high an in
stitutional risk if you ait us this
much."
And those arguments have
been particularly compelling
when they've been accompanied
by really thoughtful assess
ments of the institutional risk
or the cost.
"If you cut me this much,"
the director of campus security
says, "we'll have to reduce these
patrols. That involves an ac
ceptable risk. But if we had to
reduce safety investment by this
much then it would, in our
judgement, put the community
at risk."
And if you look at our rank
set of cuts that way, you're able
to make a more reasonable de
cision. And we have gone back
and changed targets in response
to arguments of that kind. So
we've not been inflexible.
How do you see your Teaching
Plan fitting into all of this?
I think that most of the things
that I think are necessary to do
to improve teaching are revenue
neutral. I'm not proposing that
we trade research activity for
teaching activity. That was
never part of the proposal.
We simply want to increase
the emphasis given, the respect
and recognition given, the eval
uation of, the role of the pro
motions and appointments
process in teaching. I think that
we can have very substantial im
provements in the regard given
in this culture given to teaching
without any additional expendi
tures.
Are you planning to come out
with something more specific?
There's a whole series of re
sponses planned. First I sent an
updated letter to the faculty at
the end of spring quarter with
another essay. I plan to complete
an evaluation of the comments
in response to my April 5 speech
and some further explanation
and description of where we
plan to go this summer.
In the fall I hope to have a
set of proposals put before the
committee with respect to eval
uation of teaching and the use
of such evaluations in the ap
pointments and promotions
process. And then later in the
fall I hope to have a series of
announcements to support
teaching and undergraduate ed
ucation.
Do you have any comment on
the Diana Conktin case?

This is just not a presidential
matter at this moment. Norm
Robinson is speaking for us.
You asked whether what a
university officer does off
campus in private time is some
thing that the University would
take no interest in, and the an
swer is no. Obviously there is
some relevance of private ac
tions to one's employment at the
institution under some circum
stances. Whether this is such a
circumstance, nobody can tell.
The right question to ask is
whether what turns out to be
the case here would impair her
effectiveness in her job.
Let me only add to that that
I have a very high regard for
her in all of her work for Stan
ford. She's been a terrifically
valuable person.
How extensive do you think
the drug problem is among em
ployeesf
This is a large community
with a large number of people,
and in this day and age, anyone
who tends to have an accurate
understanding of that is proba
bly kidding himself. But cer
tainly my impression is not very
extensive.
There's been a lot of commu
nity concern about the rape in

the Foothills over Commence
ment weekend. Is there anything
the University is doing to make
the campus safer?
This particular incident was
obviously very troubling and
we're certainly doing things to
try to prevent that sort of oc
currence and in terms of the
security area, I can't be very
specific because I think it's wiser
not to be.
Obviously a lot of education
is going on. We're attempting to
do more of that. The march up
there and other things that the
community has taken charge of
and done are very beneficial.
A lot of comparisons have been
made between you and Har
vard's president Derek Bok. He's
now retiring after 20 years.
You've just finished your tenth
year. Do you see this as the half
way point?
No, you have to remember
that I not only started later than
Derek, but also at a more ad
vanced age. For me to do twenty
years would take me to age sev
enty, or just about, so I don't
think in terms of half-way
points.
I do, however, feel very tho
roughly committed to this job
and to all the parts of the agenda

that I tried to lay out in April,
including the Centennial Cam
paign, planning for the next
stages of providing the resources
that Stanford needs, continuing
to solidify our place at or near
the very very top, making sure
that we structure our work and
control our ambitions so that
we can make good on our com
mittments as we have started
to do with these budget cuts.
All of that is a pretty imposing
agenda. It's not something that
you complete overnight. And
I'm very committed to it. So I
feel pretty solid about the future
and am looking forward to it
very much.
But a lot of presidencies are
turning over. John Branimus
announced yesterday that he
was going to step down* after
ten years as president of NYU.
Johns Hopkins has just turned
over Carter.
Why is that? Do people often
retire in mass?
Oh, no. It's all statistical aber
ration. But after Bok steps
down, there will only be two
presidents in the Pac 10 and one
in the Ivy League that have been
in office as long as I have.
So I read all this stuff about
growth hormone in 60 year old
men and it gets me real ex
cited. ...

many people we're going to have
to lay off. A lot depends on
people thinking about their own
futures and making decisions in
advance on what happens
through normal attrition.
We believe at the moment that
we are going to have to do some
of that, but all we have in front
of us so far are estimates.
When will you know the
precise figures?
It will be a moving target, as
normal attrition and people's
own choices run along expecta
tions.
Do you see departments biting
the bullet on the cuts or drag
ging their feet ?
There's all sorts of responses.
I would say that most adminis
trators have been very good
about recognizing the reality
and planning intelligently for it.
We have been offered very few
Washington Monuments.
It's an old government joke
that when there are budget cuts
demanded by OMB [Office of
Management and Budget], the
departments put up tneir cut
items. And the joke is that the
National Park Service always
listed at the top of their cut list
staffing [at] the Washington
Monument, which of course
would infuriate all those coming
to visit their senators and con
gressmen and taking a tour of
the capitol. And nobody would
dare cut that.
So Washington Monument
strategy is a metaphor for of
fering to cut something you

know they won't let you cut. In
other words, it's a gaming of
the system, and there's been
very little gaming of the system.
Several of the RFs have ques
tioned the massive cuts intended
for Residential Education ....
They protested them and a
whole bunch of hearings were
held and a lot of the cuts were
restored in the end. There have
been some program reductions
and in a few cases a reduction
in the number of RAs, but the
resident fellows' programs are
really in pretty good shape.
I've met with the resident fel
lows and we had a frank discus
sion of their needs. Already by
that time there was some step
ping back from the cuts. And
while I won't sit here and tell
you that they're all satisfied
now, certainly they're much less
dissatisfied than they were after
the first rounds of announce
ments.
I think we try to be responsive
to arguments on the other side,
arguments that say, "Look,
we're performing a vital func
tion and there's too high an in
stitutional risk if you ait us this
much."
And those arguments have
been particularly compelling
when they've been accompanied
by really thoughtful assess
ments of the institutional risk
or the cost.
"If you cut me this much,"
the director of campus security
says, "we'll have to reduce these
patrols. That involves an ac
ceptable risk. But if we had to
reduce safety investment by this
much then it would, in our
judgement, put the community
at risk."
And if you look at our rank
set of cuts that way, you're able
to make a more reasonable de
cision. And we have gone back
and changed targets in response
to arguments of that kind. So
we've not been inflexible.
How do you see your Teaching
Plan fitting into all of this?
I think that most of the things
that I think are necessary to do
to improve teaching are revenue
neutral. I'm not proposing that
we trade research activity for
teaching activity. That was
never part of the proposal.
We simply want to increase
the emphasis given, the respect
and recognition given, the eval
uation of, the role of the pro
motions and appointments
process in teaching. I think that
we can have very substantial im
provements in the regard given
in this culture given to teaching
without any additional expendi
tures.
Are you planning to come out
with something more specific?
There's a whole series of re
sponses planned. First I sent an
updated letter to the faculty at
the end of spring quarter with
another essay. I plan to complete
an evaluation of the comments
in response to my April 5 speech
and some further explanation
and description of where we
plan to go this summer.
In the fall I hope to have a
set of proposals put before the
committee with respect to eval
uation of teaching and the use
of such evaluations in the ap
pointments and promotions
process. And then later in the
fall I hope to have a series of
announcements to support
teaching and undergraduate ed
ucation.
Do you have any comment on
the Diana Conktin case?

This is just not a presidential
matter at this moment. Norm
Robinson is speaking for us.
You asked whether what a
university officer does off
campus in private time is some
thing that the University would
take no interest in, and the an
swer is no. Obviously there is
some relevance of private ac
tions to one's employment at the
institution under some circum
stances. Whether this is such a
circumstance, nobody can tell.
The right question to ask is
whether what turns out to be
the case here would impair her
effectiveness in her job.
Let me only add to that that
I have a very high regard for
her in all of her work for Stan
ford. She's been a terrifically
valuable person.
How extensive do you think
the drug problem is among em
ployeesf
This is a large community
with a large number of people,
and in this day and age, anyone
who tends to have an accurate
understanding of that is proba
bly kidding himself. But cer
tainly my impression is not very
extensive.
There's been a lot of commu
nity concern about the rape in

the Foothills over Commence
ment weekend. Is there anything
the University is doing to make
the campus safer?
This particular incident was
obviously very troubling and
we're certainly doing things to
try to prevent that sort of oc
currence and in terms of the
security area, I can't be very
specific because I think it's wiser
not to be.
Obviously a lot of education
is going on. We're attempting to
do more of that. The march up
there and other things that the
community has taken charge of
and done are very beneficial.
A lot of comparisons have been
made between you and Har
vard's president Derek Bok. He's
now retiring after 20 years.
You've just finished your tenth
year. Do you see this as the half
way point?
No, you have to remember
that I not only started later than
Derek, but also at a more ad
vanced age. For me to do twenty
years would take me to age sev
enty, or just about, so I don't
think in terms of half-way
points.
I do, however, feel very tho
roughly committed to this job
and to all the parts of the agenda

that I tried to lay out in April,
including the Centennial Cam
paign, planning for the next
stages of providing the resources
that Stanford needs, continuing
to solidify our place at or near
the very very top, making sure
that we structure our work and
control our ambitions so that
we can make good on our com
mittments as we have started
to do with these budget cuts.
All of that is a pretty imposing
agenda. It's not something that
you complete overnight. And
I'm very committed to it. So I
feel pretty solid about the future
and am looking forward to it
very much.
But a lot of presidencies are
turning over. John Branimus
announced yesterday that he
was going to step down* after
ten years as president of NYU.
Johns Hopkins has just turned
over Carter.
Why is that? Do people often
retire in mass?
Oh, no. It's all statistical aber
ration. But after Bok steps
down, there will only be two
presidents in the Pac 10 and one
in the Ivy League that have been
in office as long as I have.
So I read all this stuff about
growth hormone in 60 year old
men and it gets me real ex
cited. ...


Hilary Smith â€” Dally
Kennedy takes a break from his duties to talk with The Dally about issues facing Stanford. During
the ten years that he has been president, Kennedy has witnessed many changes as the University
has risen to the top of college rankings.
As Stanford celebrates its
100 th year, Donald Kennedy
completes the first decade of his
term as the University's presi
dent.
In his ten years at the helm,
Kennedy has witnessed the re
placement of Western Culture
with Culture, Ideas and Values,
a change in management at the
Hoover Institution and massive
construction on campus. He has
also watched Stanford rise to
the top of the college rankings.
Now Kennedy is presiding
over a $22 million budget re
duction and repositioning move
ment that has been hailed by
some as foresighted and pro
gressive, and cursed by others
as debilitating.
Slightly graying, but still re
ported to run the Dish every
morning at 6 a.m., Kennedy
speaks seriously but has no
problem with letting down his
guard to crack a joke.
Yesterday morning Kennedy
talked to The Daily about issues
facing the University this sum
mer: the budget, drug use
among employees, campus
safety and his future.
How severe are Stanford's
budget problems, really? There
was a story in The New York
Times which indicated that it
isn't so much of a crisis now,
but Stanford is preparing for
the future.
Well, I think that's exactly
right. I think that The New York
Times reporter understood the
problem very well. We have to
be foresighted and we have to
be tough on ourselves. The
Times, I think, correctly identi
fied us as preparing for the fu
ture and that's what we think
we're doing.
With these budget cuts come
the proposed layoffs of over 100
employees ....
We don't know exactly how
many people we're going to have
to lay off. A lot depends on
people thinking about their own
futures and making decisions in
advance on what happens
through normal attrition.

been some program reductions
and in a few cases a reduction
in the number of RAs, but the
resident fellows' programs are
really in pretty good shape.
I've met with the resident fel
lows and we had a frank discus
sion of their needs. Already by
that time there was some step
ping back from the cuts. And
while I won't sit here and tell
you that they're all satisfied
now, certainly they're much less
dissatisfied than they were after
the first rounds of announce
ments.
I think we try to be responsive
to arguments on the other side,
arguments that say, "Look,
we're performing a vital func
tion and there's too high an in
stitutional risk if you ait us this
much."
And those arguments have
been particularly compelling
when they've been accompanied
by really thoughtful assess
ments of the institutional risk
or the cost.
"If you cut me this much,"
the director of campus security
says, "we'll have to reduce these
patrols. That involves an ac
ceptable risk. But if we had to
reduce safety investment by this
much then it would, in our
judgement, put the community
at risk."
And if you look at our rank
set of cuts that way, you're able
to make a more reasonable de
cision. And we have gone back
and changed targets in response
to arguments of that kind. So
we've not been inflexible.
How do you see your Teaching
Plan fitting into all of this?
I think that most of the things
that I think are necessary to do
to improve teaching are revenue
neutral. I'm not proposing that
we trade research activity for
teaching activity. That was
never part of the proposal.
We simply want to increase
the emphasis given, the respect
and recognition given, the eval
uation of, the role of the pro
motions and appointments
process in teaching. I think that
we can have very substantial im
provements in the regard given
in this culture given to teaching
without any additional expendi
tures.
Are you planning to come out
with something more specific?
There's a whole series of re
sponses planned. First I sent an
updated letter to the faculty at
the end of spring quarter with
another essay. I plan to complete
an evaluation of the comments
in response to my April 5 speech
and some further explanation
and description of where we
plan to go this summer.
In the fall I hope to have a
set of proposals put before the
committee with respect to eval
uation of teaching and the use
of such evaluations in the ap
pointments and promotions
process. And then later in the
fall I hope to have a series of
announcements to support
teaching and undergraduate ed
ucation.
Do you have any comment on
the Diana Conktin case?

This is just not a presidential
matter at this moment. Norm
Robinson is speaking for us.
You asked whether what a
university officer does off
campus in private time is some
thing that the University would
take no interest in, and the an
swer is no. Obviously there is
some relevance of private ac
tions to one's employment at the
institution under some circum
stances. Whether this is such a
circumstance, nobody can tell.
The right question to ask is
whether what turns out to be
the case here would impair her
effectiveness in her job.
Let me only add to that that
I have a very high regard for
her in all of her work for Stan
ford. She's been a terrifically
valuable person.
How extensive do you think
the drug problem is among em
ployeesf
This is a large community
with a large number of people,
and in this day and age, anyone
who tends to have an accurate
understanding of that is proba
bly kidding himself. But cer
tainly my impression is not very
extensive.
There's been a lot of commu
nity concern about the rape in

the Foothills over Commence
ment weekend. Is there anything
the University is doing to make
the campus safer?
This particular incident was
obviously very troubling and
we're certainly doing things to
try to prevent that sort of oc
currence and in terms of the
security area, I can't be very
specific because I think it's wiser
not to be.
Obviously a lot of education
is going on. We're attempting to
do more of that. The march up
there and other things that the
community has taken charge of
and done are very beneficial.
A lot of comparisons have been
made between you and Har
vard's president Derek Bok. He's
now retiring after 20 years.
You've just finished your tenth
year. Do you see this as the half
way point?
No, you have to remember
that I not only started later than
Derek, but also at a more ad
vanced age. For me to do twenty
years would take me to age sev
enty, or just about, so I don't
think in terms of half-way
points.
I do, however, feel very tho
roughly committed to this job
and to all the parts of the agenda

that I tried to lay out in April,
including the Centennial Cam
paign, planning for the next
stages of providing the resources
that Stanford needs, continuing
to solidify our place at or near
the very very top, making sure
that we structure our work and
control our ambitions so that
we can make good on our com
mittments as we have started
to do with these budget cuts.
All of that is a pretty imposing
agenda. It's not something that
you complete overnight. And
I'm very committed to it. So I
feel pretty solid about the future
and am looking forward to it
very much.
But a lot of presidencies are
turning over. John Branimus
announced yesterday that he
was going to step down* after
ten years as president of NYU.
Johns Hopkins has just turned
over Carter.
Why is that? Do people often
retire in mass?
Oh, no. It's all statistical aber
ration. But after Bok steps
down, there will only be two
presidents in the Pac 10 and one
in the Ivy League that have been
in office as long as I have.
So I read all this stuff about
growth hormone in 60 year old
men and it gets me real ex
cited. ...


Hilary Smith â€” Dally
Kennedy takes a break from his duties to talk with The Dally about issues facing Stanford. During
the ten years that he has been president, Kennedy has witnessed many changes as the University
has risen to the top of college rankings.
