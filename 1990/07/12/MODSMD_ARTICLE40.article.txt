DURBAN, South Africa — On
July 2, three million workers
stayed away from work in an
overwhelming show of support
for the African National Con
gress, which called for the na
tional stay-away.
Despite speculation that the
action would be a political
blunder for the ANC because
some other black organizations
did not support the call, the day
proceeded more calmly than any
other stay-away in South
African history.
The day kicked off a week of
national action to pressure the
government to end the violence
in Natal. The call to stay at
home was coordinated by the
Congress of South African
Trade Unions, the United Dem
ocratic Front and the South
African Youth Congress, as well
as the ANC.
The organizers' demands in
cluded the disbanding of the
KwaZulu police, the arrest and
prosecution of Inkatha "war
lords," the lifting of the state
of emergency in Natal, neutral
policing, freedom of association,
and a commission of inquiry
into injustices committed by au
thorities in the region.
It was the first time a stay
away had been called to focus
national attention on a regional
issue. Natal is the only part of
South Africa still in a state of
emergency. The region includes
the heart of Inkatha territory,
KwaZulu.

Since 1987, more than 3,000
people have been killed in the
violence in Natal, most in
clashes between Inkatha "war
lords" and ANC "comrades."
The ANC has pressured
South African President F.W. de
Klerk to strip Buthelezi — who
is both chief minister of
KwaZulu and head of the
KwaZulu police — of his state
appointed authority.
In the week before the stay
away, Inkatha firmly showed his
opposition, as did the Inkatha
backed United Workers' Union
of South Africa.
Also opposing the stay-away
was the Pan-Africanist
Congress-backed National
Council of Trade Unions.
Council spokespersons said they
had not been consulted about
the action and believed it was
an inappropriate measure to end
the violence. They said the ANC
and Inkatha should meet di
rectly with each other.
But despite the disunity be
hind the call to action, an esti
mated three out of four workers
in Natal stayed home, and less
than a handful of violent inci
dents occurred in the townships.
In other parts of the country,
even greater numbers of
workers stayed home: 80 percent
in the Transvaal, 85 percent in
the Eastern Cape and 80 percent
in the Johannesburg-
Witswatersrand region.
The peace of the day demon
strated not only the numerical
support for the ANC, but also
the discipline of the supporters.
Whereas previous stay-aways
had been marked by violent acts
such as stoning buses and bar
ricading roads, July 2 was free
of such incidents.
