# Libraries must slash budgets
## 
### Wendy Bjerknes 
Between 15 and 25 employees will be laid
off to help accomplish the 16 percent budget
cut ordered for the Stanford University Libra
ries system, according to library director David
Weber.
The library reduction target set by Provost
James Rosse was among the most controversial
of the cuts. Many argued, unsuccessfully, that
the libraries deserved the same "protection"
from severe budget cuts as did academic de
partments and other areas deemed vital to
maintaining Stanford's excellence in research
and education.
However, Rosse rejected the argument be
cause, "the evidence we have is pretty clear
that the library is a more expensive library to
run than it needs to be. If the library is going
to continue to innovate into the future, we
are going to have to find some way to run it
more economically than we run it."
Funding to renovate Meyer Library was cut
back from $19 million to $2.7 million and used
only to repair damage caused by the October
earthquake. In addition, the library has cut
subscriptions to scientific journals, and nearly
700 titles have been removed from the shelves
in the past two years.
But the libraries will still have to cut 16
percent of their operating budget. The plan to
do this consists of two phases.
Phase I saves $1,859,000 for the academic
year 1990-91 and $392,000 for 1991-92 for a
combined 13.5 percent budget reduction over
the next two years.
Of these cutbacks, 80 to 90 percent will
come in the form of layoffs. One-sixth of the
current staff, which took approximately 15
years to build, will be eliminated, Weber said.
Most of the positions to be terminated are
in middle management, including the associate
director for Instructional and Research Serv
ices, at least four department chief or assistant
chief positions, and six administrative support
staff positions. "It will be at least a month
before most administrative actions are ade
quately worked out and the probable functional
consequences are known," Weber said.
Weber said this could translate into more
work for the remaining administrative staff,
thinner public service, and reduced capacity

and quality of the libraries' "extra" services,
but Rosse emphasized he "will not let the
quality of the library deteriorate."
Weber stressed that students will not notice
much change in the quality or quantity of
library service. He said there will be minimal
change in the number of service hours and
student jobs will not be cut.
Also protected within the library system is
its materials budget, which is the allotment of
funds provided to purchase new books and
other research material, and the preservation
department, which repairs and protects books
already in circulation.
The automated computer system, which will
allow for automated library circulation in two
to-three years time, will also be free from cuts.
The technical processing staff, which controls
the acquisition of new materials, and the
reconstruction of the West Wing of Green Li
brary, which was heavily damaged in the
earthquake, will also be protected.
The remaining amount of the budget which
needs to be cut in order to achieve the total
16 percent, an additional $408,000, will take
place in Phase 11. The form it will take is still
unclear.
"Too many of the recommendations that I
have read and discussed have been more in
the mold of budget-cutting than in the spirit
of the repositioning effort," Rosse said, refer
ring to the Phase I cuts.
"The repositioning effort is primarily driven
by a need to simplify the work of the library
itself. It means designing jobs, processes, and
working relationships to get the work done
more cost-effectively and productively," he
added.
The brunt of the Phase II reductions will
fall on the shoulders of the libraries catering
to the humanities and science departments,
while the law, business and medical schools
will be relatively unaffected.
Rosse's recommendations to achieve the
Phase II goals include the consolidation of the
Food Research Library and Cubberley Educa
tion Library into Green, saving $209,000; the
combination of the Biology with the Chemis
try/Chemical Engineering Libraries, saving
$68,000; and the Physics Library with the
Math/Computer Science Library, saving
$51,000.
