# Tour guides offer wit, wisdom to Stanford visitors
## 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
In their line of duty, courageous Stan
ford tour guides have hit curbs, puddles,
poles, people, parked vehicles and the
übiquitous reflectors in the middle of
the road. Walking backward all the way,
the guides present Stanford to the public.
Everyone has tripped and some guides
have even fallen down completely, says
second-year tour guide Chris Shuttles
worth, adding, "You learn to pick up
your heels and practically stab the
ground with your toes."
On Shuttlesworth's first admissions
tour, she told the group she would be
walking backward and asked them to tell
her if she was about to fall off a cliff or
be run over by a herd of buffalo. To
which a father replied, "Depends on how
the tour is."
Summer is the busiest time for Stan
ford public tours. Tricia Chang, program
coordinator of the Guide and Visitors'
service, said 129 tours are scheduled for
July. The guides greet as many as 300
visitors per day.
"Stanford is viewed as a tourist at
traction," said Chang.
People ask if there is a sign that says
"Stanford" where they can pose for a
picture, added third-year tour guide Dan
Vatanaviggun.
* Shion Nishin of Japan said she visited
the campus "just to see [it]," adding, "Of
course everyone knows of Stanford in
Japan." Christian Hvelplund, a business
person from Denmark, came especially
to look at the Business School. Stanford
as a "historical place" brought Robert
Shrader to the campus from McLean, Va.
Thousands of tourists, many from
foreign countries, visit each summer. A
number of guides speak languages other
than English, and have given tours in
German, Spanish, Chinese and French.

Vanavaniggun remembered a group of
100 that requested seven guides who
spoke mandarin Chinese.
Individual tour guides can give "en
tirely different tours," said Shuttles
worth, although all information comes
from a 60-page manual. For example,
Shuttlesworth does not take her groups
to the "techie" side of campus, unlike
the many tour guides who are engineers.
Regardless of where a group spends
most of its time, all of the tours present
an overall picture of what Stanford was,
and is, like.
Speaking of Stanford's rich history,
guides tell of the death of Senator Leland

Stanford's young son, who was accepted
to Harvard at 15. The Stanfords then
decided to "make all of California's
children their children" by building the
University. One woman cried after
hearing this story, said Shuttlesworth.
Many people, however, have heard a
different story of the University's found
ing, she continued. In this version, the
Stanfords brought a suitcase of money
to donate to Harvard, which would not
accept it. As a result, the Stanfords built
their own university. People are
"amazed" to find out this story is not
true, Shuttlesworth said.
Aside from important names and dates,
visitors learn a lot of trivia which can't
be found in official histories of the Uni
versity.
Jane Stanford had an umbrella with
a one-inch tip, said guide Nik Ormseth.
During the construction of Memorial
Church, she would poke the tip into
column carvings. If it did not fit, she
told workers to redo them.
The "female 500" refers to the limit
on female admissions that was in effect
until 1933. Although Jane Stanford
wanted female students, she felt having
too many women would not be an ap
propriate memorial to her son, Ormseth
explained. When the cap was lifted, the
male-female ratio was five to one.
In addition to learning history and
trivia, tourists learn about student life
today.
"F\ill moon in the Quad" and the labels
"fuzzy" and "techie" usually get big
crowd reactions, said Vatanaviggum.
Some alumni are "appalled" that dor
mitories and some campus bathrooms
are coed now, said Chang. Others recol
lect their parents saying they picked up
rubble after the 1906 earthquake, she
added.
Many people are curious about the Oc
tober 1989 earthquake, said Vatanavig
gum, and are upset that Memorial
Church is closed.

Shuttlesworth said some people would
stay in the church 15 minutes, and"it
was all I could do to get them out." Now
she spends more time telling about Stan
ford traditions such as fountain-hopping,
the Stanford Band, paper fights at Flicks,
the Big Game bonfire and windsurfing
on Lake Lag.
"Is all you do here play?" a visitor
once asked Shuttlesworth. Some people
are still surprised at the attitude of
having a good time while learning, she
said.
Ormseth tells his group about the an
nual event at "The Claw" during Big
Game week. The smallest member of the
band climbs to the top and impales a
teddy bear, symbolizing a Berkeley
Golden Bear.
"Is it true the band blocks for the
football team?" Larry Pelletier of Wich
ita, Kan. asked.
Shuttlesworth said the strangest ques
tion she has been asked is "Are you in
the math department and do not meet
many women? I noticed on the tour a
lot of young men said 'hi' to you."
Personal questions are popular — "Do
you like it here?" and "What is one thing
you regret about being at Stanford?"
Such questions are difficult to answer,
Shuttlesworth said, because, "All I can
do is say what it is for me, but sometimes
that is not good enough."
To some people the tour guide is Stan
ford because that is the only person on
campus they meet, according to Chang.
She said she believes a determining fac
tor in her decision to attend Stanford
was her tour guide.
"It was our favorite school visit," said
high school student Jon Luchs of Can
berra, Australia. He and his brother
Mark agreed that especially after the
tour, they want to attend school here.
The tour defeated the "Bill and Ted"
stereotype but reinforced the "laid-back,
friendly, easy-going" image, they ex
plained.

second-year tour guide Chris Shuttles
worth, adding, "You learn to pick up
your heels and practically stab the
ground with your toes."
On Shuttlesworth's first admissions
tour, she told the group she would be
walking backward and asked them to tell
her if she was about to fall off a cliff or
be run over by a herd of buffalo. To
which a father replied, "Depends on how
the tour is."
Summer is the busiest time for Stan
ford public tours. Tricia Chang, program
coordinator of the Guide and Visitors'
service, said 129 tours are scheduled for
July. The guides greet as many as 300
visitors per day.
"Stanford is viewed as a tourist at
traction," said Chang.
People ask if there is a sign that says
"Stanford" where they can pose for a
picture, added third-year tour guide Dan
Vatanaviggun.
* Shion Nishin of Japan said she visited
the campus "just to see [it]," adding, "Of
course everyone knows of Stanford in
Japan." Christian Hvelplund, a business
person from Denmark, came especially
to look at the Business School. Stanford
as a "historical place" brought Robert
Shrader to the campus from McLean, Va.
Thousands of tourists, many from
foreign countries, visit each summer. A
number of guides speak languages other
than English, and have given tours in
German, Spanish, Chinese and French.

Vanavaniggun remembered a group of
100 that requested seven guides who
spoke mandarin Chinese.
Individual tour guides can give "en
tirely different tours," said Shuttles
worth, although all information comes
from a 60-page manual. For example,
Shuttlesworth does not take her groups
to the "techie" side of campus, unlike
the many tour guides who are engineers.
Regardless of where a group spends
most of its time, all of the tours present
an overall picture of what Stanford was,
and is, like.
Speaking of Stanford's rich history,
guides tell of the death of Senator Leland

Stanford's young son, who was accepted
to Harvard at 15. The Stanfords then
decided to "make all of California's
children their children" by building the
University. One woman cried after
hearing this story, said Shuttlesworth.
Many people, however, have heard a
different story of the University's found
ing, she continued. In this version, the
Stanfords brought a suitcase of money
to donate to Harvard, which would not
accept it. As a result, the Stanfords built
their own university. People are
"amazed" to find out this story is not
true, Shuttlesworth said.
Aside from important names and dates,
visitors learn a lot of trivia which can't
be found in official histories of the Uni
versity.
Jane Stanford had an umbrella with
a one-inch tip, said guide Nik Ormseth.
During the construction of Memorial
Church, she would poke the tip into
column carvings. If it did not fit, she
told workers to redo them.
The "female 500" refers to the limit
on female admissions that was in effect
until 1933. Although Jane Stanford
wanted female students, she felt having
too many women would not be an ap
propriate memorial to her son, Ormseth
explained. When the cap was lifted, the
male-female ratio was five to one.
In addition to learning history and
trivia, tourists learn about student life
today.
"F\ill moon in the Quad" and the labels
"fuzzy" and "techie" usually get big
crowd reactions, said Vatanaviggum.
Some alumni are "appalled" that dor
mitories and some campus bathrooms
are coed now, said Chang. Others recol
lect their parents saying they picked up
rubble after the 1906 earthquake, she
added.
Many people are curious about the Oc
tober 1989 earthquake, said Vatanavig
gum, and are upset that Memorial
Church is closed.

Shuttlesworth said some people would
stay in the church 15 minutes, and"it
was all I could do to get them out." Now
she spends more time telling about Stan
ford traditions such as fountain-hopping,
the Stanford Band, paper fights at Flicks,
the Big Game bonfire and windsurfing
on Lake Lag.
"Is all you do here play?" a visitor
once asked Shuttlesworth. Some people
are still surprised at the attitude of
having a good time while learning, she
said.
Ormseth tells his group about the an
nual event at "The Claw" during Big
Game week. The smallest member of the
band climbs to the top and impales a
teddy bear, symbolizing a Berkeley
Golden Bear.
"Is it true the band blocks for the
football team?" Larry Pelletier of Wich
ita, Kan. asked.
Shuttlesworth said the strangest ques
tion she has been asked is "Are you in
the math department and do not meet
many women? I noticed on the tour a
lot of young men said 'hi' to you."
Personal questions are popular — "Do
you like it here?" and "What is one thing
you regret about being at Stanford?"
Such questions are difficult to answer,
Shuttlesworth said, because, "All I can
do is say what it is for me, but sometimes
that is not good enough."
To some people the tour guide is Stan
ford because that is the only person on
campus they meet, according to Chang.
She said she believes a determining fac
tor in her decision to attend Stanford
was her tour guide.
"It was our favorite school visit," said
high school student Jon Luchs of Can
berra, Australia. He and his brother
Mark agreed that especially after the
tour, they want to attend school here.
The tour defeated the "Bill and Ted"
stereotype but reinforced the "laid-back,
friendly, easy-going" image, they ex
plained.

In their line of duty, courageous Stan
ford tour guides have hit curbs, puddles,
poles, people, parked vehicles and the

the road. Walking backward all the way,
the guides present Stanford to the public.
