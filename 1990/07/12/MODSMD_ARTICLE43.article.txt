# Sierra Camp offers summer work, play

The publicity brochure says,
"at Stanford Sierra Camp you
will find family fun and adven
tures for children, athletic and
intellectual pursuits, individual
and team sports, and artistic en
deavors." But for 54 Stanford
students, the camp is a summer
job that involves hard work,
serious commitment and the ex
perience of a lifetime.
Purchased in 1966 by the
Stanford Alumni Association,
the Sierra Camp was established
to provide a resort area for Stan
ford faculty, staff, alumni and
their families.
Located about one mile south
west of South Lake Tahoe on
the beaches of Fallen Leaf Lake,
the camp is isolated from
civilization, making it a desira
ble summer destination.
Holding the camp together are
students who choose to forego
the more common routine of a
summer internship to tough it
out at South Lake Tahoe. There
is a competitive application
process for jobs at Sierra Camp.
This summer, for example, 220
applications were submitted for
the 54 positions offered.
The only requirement for the
job is that the person must be
a Stanford student and must
have attended Stanford for at
least two quarters. When choos
ing from the applicants, Sum
mer Staff Director Kurt Triplett
says Sierra Camp looks for
"people who are highly energetic
— the job is a lot like being a
resident assistant."
Senior Chrissy D'Angelo, who
worked at Sierra Camp last
summer as a sailing and art in
structor, said the job was
definitely a lot of hard work,
but doing it with others made
even cleaning or working in the
kitchen a lot of fun.
One point D'Angelo stressed
was that some people have the
misconception that Sierra Camp
is Stanford's version of Club
Med. "People who expect it to
be a resort are disappointed,"
she said, "but most really love
it."
Puring the summer there are
12 week-long sessions in which
about 60 families stay at the
complex. Triplett describes the
accommodations as comparable
to "a nice hotel," but without
televisions or telephones.
Despite the lack of some
modern luxuries, demand to at
tend the camp is greater than

ever. Triplett said that for the
last four years, the entire camp
has been booked as early as Jan
uary, with an additional 30
families per week on the waiting
list.
The students do not share the
same accommodations as the
other guests. D'Angelo said,
"our cabin was grungy, but that
didn't bother me."
She added that for at least a
couple of nights per week, most
of the students slept outside.
Over the course of the summer,
D'Angelo saw about 15 shooting
stars, something she had never
seen prior to working at Sierra
Camp.
The camp's guests, unlike the
staff, are not limited to Stanford
people. All members of the
Alumni Association — which
anyone can join — can attend.
Many of the families who go
there do so every year. Some,
according to Triplett, have been
attending for 15 consecutive
summers.
The camp's popularity stems
largely from its offerings of out
door activities such as waterski
ing, hiking, tennis, sailing,
volleyball, arts and crafts, and
relaxation at an "undeveloped
mountain wilderness of extraor
dinary natural beauty."
In addition, the camp hosts
two faculty speakers each week.
Some past speakers have in
cluded Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter; men's tennis Coach Dick
Gould, who leads a tennis clinic
with his wife; University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy; and His
tory Assoc. Prof. Judith Brown.
Triplett said one of the biggest
problems the camp faces every
summer is illness. Because each
student is hired for a specific
job, a sudden outbreak of the
stomach flu, for example, can
seriously affect the pace of the
program.
Illness nonwithstanding,
visitors tend to give high ratings
in the camp evaluations.
Triplett said on a 10-point scale,
the camp receives mostly nines
and 10's. Perhaps this is due to
the fact that, as D'Angelo said,
"We pamper the guests."
The costs of such pampering
vary with the size of the family
and whether the stay will be in
a cabin, a lodge room or a room
with a view of the lake. For two
people, staying in a lake-view
lodge room, for instance, the
cost is $1,070 per week, while
an eight-person, four-bedroom
cabin with two baths is priced
at $3,050 per week.
