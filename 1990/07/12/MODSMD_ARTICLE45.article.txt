# Duo rings Hoover Tower bells
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Not 7.1 earthquakes, nor out
of-tune bells nor even lack of
funds can keep two dedicated
men from their self-appointed
task of playing Hoover Tower's
carillon.
The carillon is a set of 35
bells kept in a metal cage on
the tower's observation deck.
"I probably would not have
come to Stanford if it did not
have a carillon," said James An
gell, professor emeritus of elec
trical engineering, who has
played the instrument for 30
years.
Angell and Timothy Zerlang,
a music lecturer who became
involved with the carillon in
1984, play the bells about once
a week.
The musicians operate the
three-octave carillon by pound
ing on large wooden pegs with
their fists and stomping on
wooden block pedals with their
feet, often in very rapid succes
sion.
"It's not as good [a workout]
as a game of squash, but it's
better than a game of tennis,"
said Angell.
Before the Oct. 17 earth
quake, the carillon rang twice a
day, thanks to a built-in auto
matic player. But because Angell
has not had time to check the
player for earthquake damage,
the carillon is now only operated
manually. However, he plans to
inspect it this summer.
The bells are out of tune from
years of use, but to retune them
would mean melting them down
and recasting them, a difficult
and expensive task.
Despite this, Zerlang said, "It
is still a good carillon. [The bel
ls] are nice-sounding."
Zerlang and Angell take on
full responsibility for the instru
ment's - upkeep by choosing to
play it. Neither the University
nor Hoover Institution provide
funds for its maintenance and
playing, because the carillon
came as a gift.
The bells were originally part
of the Belgian exhibition at the
1939-40 World's Fair in New
York. In 1941, the year the
tower was completed, the caril
lon was donated to the Institu
tion to thank Herbert Hoover
for his relief work for Belgium
after World War I.
Recently, Angell and Zerlang
performed a special Indepen
dence Day concert, which fea-

game of tennis.'

tured such songs as "The Battle
Hymn of the Republic" and
"The Star-Spangled Banner."
The pair's best known per
formance is probably their an
nual Halloween concert, which
includes themes from TV shows
such as "The Addams Family,"
"Bewitched" and"The Twilight
Zone."

Zerlang said he plans to con
tinue playing the carillon as long
as he remains in the Bay Area.
He noted that being a profes
sional musician helped him
learn to play the carillon in
about six months of playing
twice a week.
But Angell said that for him
"the novelty has worn off," and
he will only continue to play
Stanford's carillon for a few
more years.
"The beauty of Stanford's
campus deserves an even finer
carillon," Angell said, who hopes
that someday it will become a
four-octave instrument.
