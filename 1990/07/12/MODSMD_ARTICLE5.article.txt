# Stanford prepares for cuts to become reality
## 
### Jeremy Weinberg 
With budget cuts now becom
ing a harsh reality in offices
throughout the University,
Stanford employees this sum
mer are bracing for sweeping
layoffs, sharp cutbacks in serv
ices and uncertain new job re
sponsibilities.
As many as 130 employees are
facing layoffs by Sept. 1 because
of the $7.2 million budget re
duction proposed for the current
fiscal year. Overall, the
repositioning effort announced
by Provost James Rosse in Feb
ruary will lead to a $22 million
cut in the operating budget by
September 1991.
"People are biting the bullet,"
Rosse said. "It's not a four
months I'd like to repeat. But
I think it*B worth the effort."
Rosse acknowledged that low
morale is "a serious problem"
in some areas of the University
that are experiencing their first
real staff cutbacks after a 23
percent growth in personnel
over the past decade.
"I don't see a full match as
to what the academic purposes
of the University are and where
the cuts are being made," said
Denis Phillips, professor of ed
ucation and resident fellow in
Twain. The residential educa
tion program faces significant
cuts.
Mary Escobedo, who works in
the Tresidder Programs Office,
is keeping her job but is forced
to take on the responsibilities
of other employees who have
been laid off. "The staffs getting
overworked," she said.
Sweeping cuts
Virtually no University de
partment or division has been
left unscathed by the budget
knife, with the average budget
reduction for non-academic
areas set at 15 percent. The Of
fice of Human Resources is ear
marked for the largest cut, 30

percent, while the Offices of the
President and Provost, Finance,
and Legal Affairs are slated for
cuts of 20 percent.
Budget cuts for academic
areas, such as the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, are in the
4 to 6 percent range. No faculty
positions are being eliminated.
Of the $400 million annual
operating budget, only $175 mil
lion was liable to be cut because
academic areas were largely off
limits.
Among the reductions that
have stirred the most contro
versy are a 16 percent cut for
libraries and a 15 percent cut
for Student Affairs. These
moves may force cutbacks in li
brary hours and the elimination
of resident assistant positions.
Cowell Student Health Center's
overnight infirmary will be
closed this fall as a result of the
budget cuts.
Overall, the budget plans call
for the elimination of approxi
mately 450 staff positions by
September 1991. About half of
this will be achieved by not fill
ing vacancies when employees
leave the University, the other
half achieved through layoffs.
The employee relations divi
sion of Human Resources is
helping displaced employees
find other jobs within the Uni
versity and is organizing job
skill instructional programs for
those looking for other work.
Escobedo said the 15 percent
cut in Tresidder's budget is forc
ing the student union to aban
don many programs that "were
not necessary, but enhanced the
job Tresidder's supposed to do."
Rosse acknowledged that
some services for students and
faculty will be curtailed and
eliminated, but said the Univer
sity can adjust with minimal
discomfort.
"I think that we'll have to do
without some services, but
frankly I think a year from now
we'll wonder how we ever spent

so much to accomplish so little,"
he said.
"Rubber-band effect"
University officials stress that
administrative reorganization
— repositioning — is accompa
nying the budget cuts.
"We're changing the way we
do things around here," said
John Lillie, a Stanford trustee
and member of the Reposition
ing Steering Committee. "In
budget-cutting you push things
down for a year and then they
pop back — it's the rubber band
elastic effect.
"Hopefully [repositioning!
will eliminate the pop-back."
Perhaps the most significant
administrative change is the
formation of a cabinet of ad
visers to University President
Donald Kennedy, consisting of
the deans of Stanford's seven

schools, the provost, the dean
of research, the director of the
Hoover Institution and the di
rector of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.
The new cabinet will replace
the Administrative Council,
composed of the University vice
presidents and other top admin
istrators. By reasserting the role
of academicians over adminis
trators, Stanford will stress its
committment to fulfilling its ac
ademic mission of teaching and
research, Rosse said.
Some, however, are uncon
vinced that the effort will have
a significant effect on the ad
ministration of the University.
"Repositioning — what a
farce," said one employee who
did not wish to be identified.
"Wh}' don't they just call it cut
ting back?"
Phillips said he fears the

repositioning effort is not going
to address the real problem of
a bloated Stanford bureaucracy.
"I just don't think the admin
istrators are opening up for cut
ting the areas they need to, their
own bubbles of administration,"
he said. "I think a lot of people
are wondering whether
[repositioning] is going to be
business as usual with different
names."
Carolyn Lougee, associate
dean of Humanities and Sci
ences and a member of the steer
ing committee, said she was "a
little dismayed that [the com
mittee] hasn't found a lot of
economies at the upper levels."
Nevertheless, she said units
have been successful in cutting
many middle-level positions
without making excessive
