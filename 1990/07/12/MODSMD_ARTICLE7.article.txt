# Kennedy to elaborate on teaching mission
## 
### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
University President
Donald Kennedy is following
up on his call to emphasize
and improve undergraduate
education while maintaining
Stanford's committment to
research through a series of
essays and statements.
Kennedy first called for
strengthening undergraduate
education in his April 5 ad
dress to the Academic Council
and general community, in
which he discussed his vision
of Stanford in its second cen
tury.
In that address, Kennedy
asked the community "to
reaffirm that education is the
primary task [of Stanford],"
stating that his vision of im
proved undergraduate educa
tion "is faithful to Stanford's
character" and the Universi
ty's tfriginal purpose.
Since then, Kennedy has
expanded on these ideas in
an essay entitled "Learning,
Thinkings and Believing,"
which was mailed to all fac
ulty members on June 13.
The essay, a mission state
ment for the University,
details a philosophy for im
proving undergraduate edu
cation.
In the June 13 essay, Ken
nedy underscores what he
believes will be the main chal

lenge facing the University in
its next 100 years: "to
strengthen and preserve, in
the midst of one of the world's
greatest research univer
sities, an undergraduate col
lege that is selective,
distinctive, rigorous and in
spiring."
According to Kennedy, de
veloping the best possible un
dergraduate program will
facilitate the University's
"central purpose," which is
"the preparation of new lead
ership in this society."
Kennedy points out, how
ever, that this improved un
dergraduate education would
not prepare students for
"some particular set of pro
fessions or economic niches,
but for a whole range of roles
that are important to our
country."
According to the essay,
Kennedy envisions an under
graduate education where
teaching and research are
complementary, creating an
"active kind of learning, one
through which students
wrestle not only with texts
but with real problems."
In addition, Kennedy also
plans to complete an evalua
tion of the responses he has
received about his address to
the Academic Council and to
release a report later this
summer.
