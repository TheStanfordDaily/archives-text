## Colleagues praise Conklin for contributions to Stanford 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Diana Conklin, who was
cited by the police June 24 for
being under the influence of
cocaine in her Palo Alto resi
dence, resumed work Monday
after a vacation in Alabama.
Conklin told The Daily she
was advised by her lawyer, Tom
Nolan of Palo Alto, not to dis
cuss her case with the press un
til legal proceedings are
finished. She added that she is
"doing fine."
Conklin is facing a mis
demeanor charge and is sched
uled to appear in Santa Clara
County Municipal Court Aug.
13. If convicted, she could face
a $1,000 fine and up to a year
in county jail.
According to Patrol Officer
Steve Herrera of the Palo Alto
Police Department, on the day
of the incident, Conklin herself
called the police because she was
having "some sort of reaction"
to a substance she had taken.
She told the police it was
cocaine, Herrera said.
Herrera said Conklin was
treated at Stanford Hospital and
then placed under arrest. The
police found a vial with some
white powder residue in her res
idence, he added.
Bill Tipton, supervisor of the
police department's support
services division, said there is
not enough probable cause to
charge Conklin with possession
of cocaine.

Norm Robin
son, acting dean
of student af
fairs, released a
statement last
week stating
that although
"the University
is deeply con
cerned with the

problem of drug use and is com
mitted to maintaining a drug
free workplace ... the principles
of due process, not making judg
ments without knowing the
facts and considering all pertin
ent factors are also basic to the
University culture."
University President Donald
Kennedy said Conklin's case is
"not a presidential matter at the
moment." He added that al
though there may be some
relevance of one's private life to
the institution under certain cir
cumstances, it is too early to
draw a conclusion.
Kennedy said the right ques
tion to ask now is whether Con
klin's alleged use of drugs would
impair the effectiveness of her
job. "I have high regard for her
for all her work at Stanford.
Conklin was formerly an as
sistant dean of student affairs
for Residential Affairs, director
of the Row and director of the
residence deans.
Jack Chin, who is currently
acting director of the Row, said
he has known Conklin since
1982 on both a professional and
personal level. "I have nothing
but utmost respect for her. She's
one of the reasons why I came

There may be some
fault on [Conklin's]
part, but we're all

back [to Stanford] to work," said
Chin, who returned to Stanford
last April after giving up a po
sition at Oberlin College in
Ohio.
"There may be some fault on
[Conklin's] part, but we're all
human. It's not going to
diminish my opinion of her,"
Chin said. "We respect Diana's
contribution — that is the pri
mary basis for evaluating her
job status."
Jean Kim, residence dean of
Escondido Village, said Conklin
"has done an excellent job" in
the two years that they have
worked together.
Robinson called Conklin an
absolutely wonderful person,
"held in high regard" by her
colleagues.
Students also respect Conklin
for her contributions. Jason
Lewis, a senior living in Theta
Chi House, said Conklin "really
had things under control" after
the earthquake. He said he does
not believe Conklin's private life
"has anything to do with her
job."
Lewis added that he knew
many people, himself included,
who have gone to Conklin when
they had academic problems and
found her very helpful.
