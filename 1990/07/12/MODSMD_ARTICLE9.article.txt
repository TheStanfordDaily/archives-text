# Stanford, copes with drought
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
The current drought situation
in the Bay Area is the worst in
recorded history, according to
public utility officials. As a
result, many local communities
are imposing stiff penalties for
excess water usage. Stanford,
however, remains an exception.
The University claims that it
is different from other commu
nities since it leases the land it
owns and pays for the utilities.
At Stanford, where no one had
envisioned severe water
shortages until 15 years ago,
means for accurate measure
ment of water consumption is
lacking.
Now, in face of the current
drought, officials are planning
long-term conservation for the
University, including the meter
ing of previously unregulated
areas on campus. In addition,
fountains have been turned off
and plant watering has been
reduced for the summer.
Four years of drought
"We're in a really bad state,"
said Cheryl Jensen, Operations
and Maintainence manager for
Stanford's water resources. If
present conditions continue,
said Jensen, "at the end of the
year there will be almost no
reserves."
The University, which is ser
viced by two different agencies
for its water needs, has been
told to reduce its water usage
by 25 percent from its 1987 pre
drought usage. If it does not, it
will be forced to pay up to ten
times the usual rate on water
usage exceeding the limit.
"During the last eighty years
we've never had four dry years
in a row," said Leo Bauer, man
ager of San Francisco Water and
Power Resources for the Hetch
Hetchy Reservoir. The San
Francisco Public Utilities Com
mission serves over 30
communities in the Bay Area
with drinking water from the
reservoir in northern Yosemite
Park.
According to Norm Lougee, a
manager at the San Francisco
Water Department, about
760,000 acre-feet of rainwater
are collected during the typical
year at Hetch Hetchy. However,
since July 1986, only 550,000
total acre-feet have been collec
ted.
Lougee said that if current
drought conditions continue for
the next year, "we will just
squeak by." However, the next
year might require a 50 percent

reduction in water usage
throughout the Bay Area to
maintain water reserves, said
Lougee.
While most of Stanford's
water is channeled from the
Sierra Nevadas in eastern Cal
ifornia, local rainfall is collected
in underground wells at Stan
ford, said Jensen. Although
Stanford's groundwater supply
is "healthy," it is under the con
trol of the Santa Clara (County)
Water District and thus is also
subject to rationing.
Although the Stanford area
collects about 16 inches of rain
during the average year, during
the last four years Stanford has
received fewer than 11 inches.
Two prominent, though unof
fical, indicators of the severity
of the drought are Lake Lagu
nita and the campus' seven
fountains. The lake has not been
filled completely since 1987 and
has remained dry since spring
1988.
Meanwhile, Stanford's seven
fountains have been turned off
for more than half of the last
three-year period.
Stanford: Odd man out?
Other communities in the Bay
Area, facing heavy fees from San
Francisco FUC if they do not
reduce their water usage, are
passing on heavy penalties to
homeowners and businesses
that do not conserve water.
In May, Palo Alto announced
its new water-rationing plan,
prompting residents to flood
City Hall with phone calls ask
ing for details. The plan includes
financial disincentives, an agres
sive public outreach program
and, as a last resort, a shut-off
of customer water service.
At Stanford, no such strong
arm techniques have taken
place. Officials like David Kaye,
utilities manager at O & M, cite
"major differences" between
mostly residential communities
like Palo Alto and large research
universities with athletic facili

ties such as Stanford.
Although there are a large
number of residential home
owners on Stanford property,
the land on which the houses
are built belongs to the Univer
sity. Thus, "Palo Alto can send
a water bill to individual home
owners, but Stanford has to
send the bill to itself," said Jen
sen.
Nevertheless, Jensen said that
Stanford has done probably
more than other communities
in the Bay Area in conserving
water. She said that "people are
doing a lot individually," citing
a 40 percent reduction in water
usage at the Peter Coutts homes
south of campus.
In addition, over the past
three years the Grounds and
Custodial branch of O & M has
been introducing new planting
and watering techniques to
reduce water use.
University policy slow to change
O & M's David Kaye, respon
sible for the distribution of
water on campus, is developing
a general conservation policy for
Stanford that would limit water
usage in labs, dorms and con
struction sites, even in periods
of non-drought, he said.
Kaye said he sees the instal
lation of water-monitoring
meters throughout the campus
as a fundamental change neces
sary for Stanford's water man
agement.
Currently about two-thirds of
the campus is metered for water
use, said Herb Fong, grounds
manager for O & M. Areas cur
rently regulated include about
200 meters in the Athletics fa
cilities, some academic build
ings, some student residences
and most irrigated areas on
campus, added Kaye.
According to Fong, newer
buildings such as houses in
Governor's Corner, Rains
Houses, Kimball Hall and the
new biology building are or will
be metered.
While Kaye plans to install an
additional 500 meters around
campus, installation would not
take place until after identifica
tion and logistics problems are
worked out, he said.
Kaye declined to comment on
the locations of the new meters.
However, he said the meters
would be considered for revenue
first and water conservation sec
ond.
"No program is good unless
people follow guidelines," Kaye
concluded. "I think Stanford has
always had a good handle on
thing√ü."
