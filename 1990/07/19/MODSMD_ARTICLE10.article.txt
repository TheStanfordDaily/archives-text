### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
Police are still searching for the man
who robbed and raped a woman in the
Foothills on June 16 and who also may
be responsible for four previous at
tempted rapes in the Stanford area.
The police have received numerous
phone calls from people providing the
names of individuals who resemble the
composite drawing of the suspect, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Photographs of these individuals have
been shown to the victim, Niemeyer said,
but she has not identified any of them
as her assailant.
One of the many calls police have
responded to in their search for the as

sailant occurred on July 16 when resi
dents of Trancos reported seeing an
individual who resembled the description
of the suspect.
Trancos currently houses students par
ticipating in Stanford's summer program
for high school students.
Trancos resident Richard Chang said
he noticed a man leaving Soto and en
tering Trancos on the first floor some
time between 10 and 11 p.m. Monday.
Standing in the dorm's lobby, Chang was
in a position to look at a flier with the
suspect's composite while the man
walked down the hall toward him.
Chang said the man was wearing dark
blue jeans, a dark baseball cap and a
blue jeans, a dark baseball cap
black leather jacket, and that
his face and hair resembled
those in the composite of the
assailant.
"He just looked suspicious,"
said Chang.
Carter Cohn, another Trancos
resident who saw the individual,
agreed. "He didn't look like a
normal person to be in the dorm.
He failed to make eye contact,"
said Cohn.
The sighting frightened many
Trancos residents. One female
resident, who wished to remain
anonymous, said she was
"petrified" after learning that
the rapist may have walked
through the house.
On Monday night, she said,
the young men from the first
floor came up to the all-female
second floor and slept on the
floor in the young womens'
rooms, although all the students
already had roommates.
Resident assistants in Wilbur
secured their buildings after
being notified of the incident by
the Trancos RAs.
Police request that people
with any information call the
Investigations Information Line
at 725-2136. If anyone sights
the suspect, police ask that they
call 911 immediately.
