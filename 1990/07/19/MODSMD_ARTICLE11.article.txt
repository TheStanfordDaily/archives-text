# Bionic limb technology may be a decade away

### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Stanford scientists are working on
nerve chips which may one day help
people with severed limbs perform
everyday functions with robotic limbs
controlled by impulses from their own
brains.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bernard
Widrow is pursuing this study in col
laboration with Asst. Prof. Joseph Rosen
from the School of Medicine's plastic and
reconstructive surgery division and elec
trical engineering/medical doctoral can
didate Greg Kovacs.
According to Widrow, the first part of
this interdisciplinary research is to
develop silicon nerve chips with holes
that allow nerve fibres, or axons, to grow
through their surfaces. The wiring on
the nerve chips can then make electrical
contact with the axons, which carry the
body's natural impulses.
The second part, said Widrow, is to
construct an "artificial neural network"
capable of translating the body's thou
sands of signals generated by the "compl
icated firing pattern" of the brain into
about ten signals which can be com
prehended by an artificial system in the
robotic limb.
The process can be accomplished by
utilizing what is known as the "phantom
limb" phenomenon, in which a person
who has lost a limb can still sense the
presence of the missing part. A computer
will chart individual patterns of nervous
impulses when they try to control their
phantom limbs as instructed.
A computer program can then be con

structed and incorporated into the
robotic limb, allowing the patient's ner
vous impulses to control the electronics
embedded in it.
The neural network is a personalized
feature of the artificial limb, since it has
to "learn" the pattern of nervous im
pulses which is unique to every individ
ual. The durability of the nerve chips is
therefore of special importance because
replacement would mean a whole new
"relearning" process.
The medical part of the research —
implanting nerve chips into the body so
that axons can grow through the holes
— has been demonstrated by superfluous
nerves in rats' feet. The severed nerves
penetrated the holes and are still alive
after a year.
Widrow said that signals can be de
tected from the brain through the chips,
and a "two-way communication'' of elec
trical impulses can be stimulated. He
said that it is a promising sign that the
rats' bodies did not reject the chips. Al
though a year may seem a short time,
it represents a significant portion of the
rat's lifetime, he added.
Widrow said the micro-chips necessary
for the neural network have yet to be
developed, and the application of the re
search in humans is still at least a decade
away.
Widrow objected to speculations that
his research will help develop super
humans. "It's crazy — putting chips into
brains to pick up signals. I can't imagine
anyone submitting to this kind of sur
gery," he said.
Widrow's research is funded by the
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
