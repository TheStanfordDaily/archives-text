Inpatient program closed
Citing pressure from insurance companies to
provide cheaper outpatient care, the University
has closed its inpatient drug and alcohol treat
ment center.
The 13-bed inpatient center, which had
operated for four years, was among the region's
most expensive.
The University will continue to operate an
outpatient program from the hospital.
Korean scholars meet
The first Conference on Peace and Security
on the Korean Peninsula was held at Stanford's
Center for International Security and Arms Con
trol July 5 through 7.
Not since the Korean War have North and
South Koreans met to discuss arms control issues,
according to center co-director John Lewis.
Since this was the first time the United States
had met with the two Koreas to discuss security
topics, the purpose of the conference was mainly
to exchange ideas and open communication, Lewis
said.
As a result, a transcript of the conference's
presentations and discussions was not made
public, infuriating a large contingent of South
Korean reporters who had traveled to Stanford
for the event, hoping to hear news of a reunifica
tion proposal or treaty draft.
Ehrlich awarded Mac Arthur prize
Biology and Population Studies Prof. Paul
Ehrlich, known for his warnings against the
devastating effects of the world's growing popu
lation on resources and the environment, was
awarded one of 36 Mac Arthur Fellowships Tues
day.
Ehrlich said he will use the grant money, an
unrestricted $345,000 over the next five years,
to support the operations of Stanford's Center
for Conservation Biology. He also will use part
of it to help buy several acres of the Uruguai
Provincial Park, a tropical rain forest in Argen
tina.
Solar Car sails into seventh place
Stanford's solar-car team was running seventh
overall in a field of 32 after 10 days of the
General Motors Sunrayce USA, a race of student
designed solar powered cars.
Michigan has stayed in the lead for most of
the race, with Western Washington University
and the University of Maryland running second
and third overall.
Fate of broadcast facility unsure
The Hoover Institution recently received a
$500,000 grant to develop television broadcast

capability.
The grant, given by the Starr Foundation over
a three-year period, will be added to an earlier
grant of $150,000 from the John M. Olin Foun
dation.
W. Glenn Campbell, Hoover counselor and
former director, received the grant during a recent
visit to New York City.
Campbell estimates Hoover will need $1.5 mil
lion to build a television broadcast facility that
would allow Hoover scholars to be interviewed
via satellite on network news programs.
Campbell said such a facility could be used by
Stanford scholars outside of Hoover, "but we'd
make them pay."
Hoover Institution Director John Raisian, how
ever, says that the institution has not yet decided
exactly how it will spend the grant money.
"It's an issue of whether to rent or buy," Raisian
said. "The money could be used to purchase
broadcast services instead of building our own
facility."
Raisian said the fate of the broadcast grant
money will be discussed during the Board of
Overseers meeting today.
Stanford prepares for next quake
After the next mcyor earthquake, Stanford
should concentrate on making sure everyone is
safe, resuming its academic schedule and provid
ing service to outside communities, according to
a University commission's recently released
report.
The appointed commission, which has been
meeting since January, has simply formulated
University goals for the next earthquake. This
fall, however, another report will be released
which will explain how the list of goals will be met.
The first goal, life safety, includes the strength
ening and repair of buildings; the relocation fac
ulty, staff, and students; and the education of
Stanford's community on proper conduct during
and after an earthquake. Expenses for the mtyor
focus of life safety, upgrading buildings, will be
$134 million.
Second, the University hopes to be able to
resume academic programs within seven days of
a tremblor of 7.5 magnitude. Unfortunately, the
necessary funds for such preparation are not
available.
Therefore, the commission's co-chair, Asst.
Provost John Hughes, says the University should
focus on the reparation of "academically essential
buildings" damaged in an earthquake. The com
mission has also specified amounts of space that
will be needed for classes, administrative staff,
housing and food service.
The third goal is the preservation of aid for
off-campus communities, which will include med
ical care, emergency shelter, technical expertise
and the use of unneeded classroom space.
