# Infirmary is closed due to budget cuts

Don't get sick after 11 p.m.
next year.
As part of the University's
massive effort to cut budgets,
Cowell Student Health Center
officially announced last week
that it has closed its overnight
infirmary to meet mandated
spending reductions.
Cowell will continue to pro
vide free urgent care and bed
rest for students during the day
and evening, but after 11 p.m.
patients will have to choose be
tween gritting it out in their
rooms and going to Stanford
University Hospital for emer
gency services and overnight
stays.
"I think this was a reasonable
area to take a look at given the
lack of utilization," Cowell Act
ing Director Jane Meier said,
explaining that only one or two
students typically used the 12-
bed facility on any given night.
"It was costing several hundreds
of dollars a night per person . ..
to keep open."
Meier said the University is
negotiating with the hospital,
which currently charges $1,300
per night, to provide lower-cost,
infirmary-type care, in the
range of $400 a night. The cost
should be picked up by insur
ance companies, she added.
The closing is expected to save
Stanford $130,000 a year by
shifting the costs of overnight
medical care from the Univer
sity to the students and their
insurance companies. Four full
time and two part-time employ
ees will lose their jobs as a
result.
In moves expected to save an
additional $70,000 a year,
Cowell will also start charging
for aerobics classes and physical
therapy and has reduced the
amount it will pay for students'
diagnostic tests at hospitals.
Overall, the savings represent
5.5 percent of Cowell's $3.6 mil

lion annual budget — much less
than the average 15 percent re
duction facing Stanford offices
as the University cuts $22 mil
lion from its operating budget
over the next 15 months.
Meier said she expects that
most students the infirmary
treats during the day will return
to their rooms at night since
their ailments are not serious
enough to require hospitaliza
tion. Students requiring urgent
care after 11 p.m. will be
referred to the hospital emer
gency room, and those with
chicken pox will be kept isolated
in their residences, Meier said.
Of the 182 overnight stays
last year — out of more than
6,000 visits to Cowell for med
ical treatment — most were for
intestinal flu, observation of
head injuries, post-operative
recovery, viral infections and
mononucleosis.
Junior Jason Moore said the
infirmary's closure is "not that
big a deal, but it's a hassle." If
somebody feels sick, he said,
"you'll be forced to decide really
how sick you are, and maybe go
back to your room when you're
really not well enough."
While Moore said he has never
stayed in the infirmary, "I
would want to be able to go
there instead of all the way to
the hospital if I needed to."
Ruth Herzstein, a nurse on
the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. "graveyard
shift" at Cowell for 11 years,
was sorry to see her position
eliminated by the closure, al
though she will retain a job at
Cowell, filling a vacancy on the
evening shift.
"We've been seeing it coming,
but it's still a disappointment,"
she said. "It'll be tough on stu
dents when they come back in
September . . . and it'll be
tougher for me because no
longer can we help them" after
11 p.m., she added.
