# Author dishes out advice for new, healthy world
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Whether or not you give a darn about
your health, there is someone out there
who is determined to better it. That per
son is Marilyn Diamond, and her latest
effort at changing the health habits of
the world — especially those of Ameri
cans — is "The American Vegetarian
Cookbook from the Fit for Life Ititchen."
If you are at all familiar with fitness

literature, or with The New York Times'
bestseller lists, you have heard of
Marilyn, as she likes to be called. She
joined her husband Harvey in co
authoring "Fit for Life" and "Fit for Life
II," the top-selling health and fitness
books in history. To get some idea of
their popularity, consider this: "Fit for
Life" outsold every work of fiction pub
lished in the past decade. Stephen King,
eat your heart out.
"Fit for Life," the book, evolved into
Harvey and Marilyn Diamond's Fit for
Life, the health and fitness program.
They publish a free newsletter which
contains: the "recipe of the month," a
section called "Tips for the Kitchen,"
various information about health, and
coupons for products endorsed by the
program.
The American Vegetarian Cookbook is
the natural continuation of the Fit for
Life phenomenon. Previously, Fit for
Lifers — as adherents are called — had
recipes for only 28 days. The cookbook
expands that indefinitely.
But the book is more than just a list
of recipes. It is a kind of vegetarian's
handbook, containing all sorts of helpful
hints for healthy food preparation. The
first chapter presents a barrage of per
suasive arguments as to why animal
products are unhealthy, and gives other
healthful information on food. The next
two chapters give tips on kitchen items
and food supplies. The rest of the 15
chapters are dedicated to the recipes.
Although she obviously wrote the book
for a broad audience, Diamond — a Phi
Beta Kappa — uses the scholarly tech
nique of citing papers and articles from
which she has obtained information. She
does not do this to the extent of true
scholarly publications, but the citations
do impart a level of credibility helpful
to those who are skeptical, or ignorant,
of vegetarianism.

It should be noted that, as Diamond
says, the cookbook is not for vegetarians
only. It is simply a collection of recipes
to help those who wish to cut down their
meat intake to one degree or another.
However, in an interview with The Daily,
Diamond urged people of all dietary
creeds to check out the Cornell-China-
Oxford paper of May 8, which concluded
that humans are naturally herbivorous.
Diamond expressed special concern for
the dietary habits of college students.
She told of how sick she had been in
college, and said that changing her diet

played a major role in turning her health
around. Recently, she looked into the
menus of college cafeterias. "I was hor
rified," she said.
"Our priorities are totally off-base
when we don't provide the best food for
our young people," she added. But Dia
mond wants to improve the diets of more
than just young people. She wants to
change the ways of the entire "human
family." She has a plan.
"We can't start by changing the world,"
she said. "We have to change ourselves
... . This is what we can control."
