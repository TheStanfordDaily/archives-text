## 
### 
One of Diamond's suggested
recipes for college students is a
sandwich substitute. She calls it the
"goodwich."
1) Have your filling ingredients
ready. (The cookbook contains
recipes for making tasty, healthy
condiments and fillings.)
2) Heat a no-stick skillet over
medium-high heat. Drop one whole
wheat tortilla or chapati — an In
dian type of bread — on the hot,
dry skillet. Code for 15 seconds,
rotating the tortilla in a circular
fashion with your fingers to prevent
sticking. Flip the tortilla over and
heat in the same way on the other
side for 10 to 15 seconds.
3) Place the hot tortilla on your
work surface. Spread it generously
with condiments of your choice.
4) In the center of the tortilla,
place a line, end to end, of your
desired filling ingredients.
5) Tuck the lower half of the
tortilla around the fillings and roll
tightly, like a burrito or cr&pe. Eat
immediately while still warm, or
store it in the refrigerator.
