THERE IS a fundamen
tal problem with a so
cial and economic sys
tem that could breed the
sentiment — unfortunately
an increasingly popular senti
ment — that homeless people
do not deserve help.
Before you join the band
wagon of flag-wavers who ac
cuse homeless individuals of
laziness and call for police
sweeps of public parks where
many homeless people live,
imagine something.
Imagine having no home.
Imagine having no place to
take a shower. Imagine
having only one pair of
clothes. Imagine living a life
in which your mind is fully
occupied with trying to figure
out where you are going to
get your next meal or how
you are going to find a place
to go to the bathroom. There
is no time to think about
Vaclav Havel's plays and no
time to plan for the future.
Imagine going to bed every
night and waking up every
morning on a park bench or
a sidewalk grate. We're not
talking about students going
for a few days without show
ering while touring Europe.
Imagine that this is your
whole life.
But what about homeless
shelters, you say. Well, home
less people haven't really cor
nered the market on hope.
Imagine putting a whole lot
of people who feel alienated
from society and without
hope under one roof. Does
this sound like a solution?
Anyone who can rise from
these conditions deserves
credit for overcoming enor
mous obstacles. How many
people in the world today
could overcome these odds?
But why don't these people
just find jobs, you say. A
homeless person can't get a
good night's sleep, shower,
don a business suit and zip

off to a job interview.
Well then, what about jobs
at McDonald's and Burger
King, you say. After all, fast
food restaurants have become
a type of safety net for the
unlucky who suffered under
the guiding hand of Grandpa
Reagan. But adding the
homeless population to the
burgeoning ranks of the
working poor is not the an
swer. A job at McDonald's is
not going to bring in enough
money for a person to pay
rent and buy food.
There is a vicious cycle in
society and the answer is not
to crack down. The answer is
to lift up. The only solution
is people helping other people.
Perhaps we would all un
derstand our world better if
we spent time working with
people who are homeless. We
would certainly get a different
view of America.
It might even be fruitful
for the government to require
public service. Imagine if
people had to spend a certain
number of hours performing
public service each week and
if those hours were propor
tional to the person's income
level. That seems crazy. But
imagine people deciding to
help other people without
government pressure. Now
that seems way out in left
field.
It's true that many home
less people have been in trou
ble with the law. It's true that
many homeless people have
a drug problem. It's true that
many homeless people have
psychological problems. But
it's also true that every home
less person is a human being.
And it's true that you and I
could be homeless if it weren't
for a bit of luck and the love
of people who took care of us
when we couldn't quite take
care of ourselves. Be one of
those people for someone who
is homeless.
