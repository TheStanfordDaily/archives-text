## Pro-choice paper exemplifies media censorship 
### 
When a newspaper — partic
ularly one with the influence
and the reputation of The Wash
ington Post — openly advocates
and justifies censorship, an "I
smell a rat" reaction should
come as the quickest of reflexes.
According to The Post's
editors, the issue of abortion
need not be subjected to further
commentary. The official dictate
of the openly pro-choice news
paper claims that the issue has
been "exhausted."
Discussion of abortion has
been censored from the editorial
pages. Abortion-related
editorials occur no longer;
columnists avoid the subject and
letters to the editor are not per
mitted to be published.
Upon first glance, the decision
to censor might solicit relief
from the more pragmatic pro
lifers: It is better to have no
discussion than The Post-style
discussion on the subject.
A more thoughtful analysis,
however, reveals the dangerous
precedent which the Post is ar
rogantly setting.

Those who value fairness
ought to be alarmed by the no
tion that it is permissible for
the news media to select the
content of public discussion.
Those who refuse to justify the
media's cohesive left-of-center
ideology should be doubly
alarmed.
Despite this new concern
among advocates of news media
objectivity, those who see The
Post's decision as an exception
are mistaken. Internal censor
ship has become practically as
commonplace in the news indus
try as are headlines
With the abortion issue the
public has already encountered
countless instances of internal
censorship via selective presen
tation of the news.
When S. Robert Lichter and
Stanley Rothman conducted
studies by interviewing 240
leading journalists about their
views, 90 percent claimed they
were pro-choice.
To its credit, The Los Angeles
Times recently admitted it had
shown an ongoing bias toward

the pro-choice sect in its cover
age of issues related to abortion.
While these and other facts
are affirming, they are hardly
necessary. One need only weigh
the number of times a coat
hanger horror story has been
preferred to stories that dwell
on the possibility that prodding
or suctioning a fetus to its
demise might be a bad thing.
The widespread sense that it
is "taboo" to allow abortion to
be equated with death is at
tributable to internal news cen
sorship. At the hands of our
society's communication indus
try, abortion has endured a swift
transformation from an issue
rooted in the question of life or
death to an issue of "rights"
alone.
This alteration took place
before the mighty decree of The
Washington Post. It came about
independent from any actions
made by the general population,
the politicians or the courts.
The Post's action also invites
speculation as to why abortion
is the only issue unworthy of

editorial commentary. Why not
capital punishment as well?
The issue of capital punish
ment parallels the abortion issue
in several ways. Both are essen
tially moral issues that question
whether or not human beings
should be allowed to live.
There is little middle-ground
for either issue. Capital punish
ment discussion has been "ex
hausted" to a similar degree as
that of abortion. Both are cur
rently legal in America (capital
punishment in selective states).
We have been conditioned —
particularly by television news
— to take for granted media
that subtly shape the world in
the way that they see fit. The
pro-life contingent holds that
with freedom there must be re
sponsibility.
The Post's philosophy might
instead state that "the paper
that brought down a president"
can bring down just about any
thing it chooses.
