## Life is too short to be nasty 
### 
Gentle Readers: The subject
of this week's column is man
ners.
Admittedly, I may not be the
best person in the world to talk
of such a subject — until just
recently, I thought a "formal
dinner" meant that the drinks
were served with tiny paper
umbrellas — but what I lack in
technical expertise, I try to com
pensate for with common sense.
It has always seemed fairly
obvious, even to a cretin like
myself, that a smile and a
friendly word when dealing with
others is preferable to, say,
snorting repeatedly and calling
them a "lunkhead."
I realize that this is nothing
new: Moses came up with a
catchy way of putting it several
thousand years before I did
when he said, "Do unto
others. ..." (Although there is
no ancient Hebrew equivalent to
"lunkhead," so the meaning in
my case is subtly different.)

Of course, as guidelines for
polite living go, mine still has
its flaws — it hasn't helped me
figure out what to do with the
knife after I've buttered my
bread, for instance — but in
general it has worked fairly well
in helping me live a moderately
courteous life.
So, with the basics of polite
ness so laughingly easy that
even I can grasp them, it con
tinues to puzzle me that there
are still so many people wan
dering about in the world who
seem incapable of treating
others nicely.
I'm not even talking about
those who consider plastic ex
plosives and semi-automatic
weapons to be integral to their
interpersonal communication. (I
try not to annoy those kinds of
people anyway, so the less said
about them the better.)
No, it's the people who pop
into your life like an ingrown
toenail — not fatal, but irritat

ing and difficult to ignore —
that are mystifying. You know,
the kind of people who will yell
at a cashier for five minutes
about a fifty-cent mistake.
So just stop and consider for
a moment: Almost every day,
Mother Nature throws earth
quakes, floods, swarms of killer
bees (they're expected to reach
the U.S. later this summer), and
other such miseries at people all
over the world. And if that
weren't enough, people get
ground up, shot up, blown up,
burnt up ... in short, things
can be mighty unpleasant.
So, was that fifty-cent mistake
when they rang up your Thai
Salad really all that important?
Life is already fairly short: Why
make it nasty and brutal? Just
try to be a little nicer next time.
Please.
