## Summer theater adds drama to your lunch 
### Sarah Laurence Editorial staff 
The Stanford Summer Theater Festi
val is bringing a dramatic improvement
to lunch hours this month. Produced in
connection with the Stanford Drama De
partment, the Festival's noon shows in
the Old Union's Nitery Theater offer a
different play for almost every day of
the week.
Directed toward a working audience,
the performances end just in time for
you to return to the office or classroom
by 1:00.
As Festival Publicity Manager Nancy
Wallace points out, "Instead of just going
over to Tresidder [Union] and eating a
sandwich, you can eat your sandwich and
watch a play at once."
Admittedly, the scenery at Tresidder

is often far from dull. But if you can
tear yourself away from sunshine and
people-watching for a day or two, you
may find yourself well-rewarded.
This year's four rotating productions,
"12 Pound Look," "Dogg's Hamlet,"
"Chaos Come Again" and"The Shawl,"
though written at different times, all ad
dress modern issues. Belying its 1912
vintage, "12 Pound Look" candidly ex
amines gender roles.
"Dogg's Hamlet," by Tom Stoppard,
experiments with language and cul
minates in a 15- minute version of
William Shakespeare's "Hamlet." "Chaos
Come Again," written and directed by
Drama Department graduate student
Humphrey Gyde, is the story of two
women who are best friends and pursue
the same man.
Finally,"The Shawl," a story about a

psychic of Questionable integrity, ven
tures into the little-charted terrain of
the occult.
As in many of Stanford's summer pro
grams, a wide range of people work on
the Festival.
In addition to the noon performances,
two different plays run back to back each
evening at 8:00. And the festivities will
by no means fade with July's moon. The
lunchtime and evening performances
continue through Aug. 10.
The Festival's major production,
Shakespeare's "Tempest," to be per
formed in Memorial Hall's Little Theater,
will begin on Aug. 2nd and run through
Aug. 12. "Tempest" Director David Saltz,
a Stanford graduate student, remarked
that the production will feature original
jazz music and that the set will have "a
Matisse look."
