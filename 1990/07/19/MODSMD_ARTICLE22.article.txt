# Double bill starts theater season
## '12 Pound Look' and 'Dogg's Hamlet' begin the summer right 
### William Thomas 
I can always tell summer is
really here when the Stanford
Summer Theater begins. Sum
mer theater is characterized —
like so many other summer
things — by its occurrence dur
ing the summer, hence the name
"summer theater." Specifically,
these are the three warmer
months — June, July and Au
gust — of the year. But only in

the Northern Hemisphere. In
the Southern Hemisphere,
everything is backward, and
these are the three colder
months. But that doesn't mat
ter. We live here, not there.
Anyway, back to the point.
This year's summer theater has
begun and the Stanford Drama
Department is starting the
season with a double bill of J.
M. Barrie's "The Twelve Pound
Look," and Tom Stoppard's

"Dogg's Hamlet."
"The Twelve Pound Look"
recounts the events of a day in
the life of Victorian Age Harry
Sims, an upper-middle-class
man whose life is devoted to
success. On this particular day,
Harry Sims receives the official
word that he is to be knighted.
