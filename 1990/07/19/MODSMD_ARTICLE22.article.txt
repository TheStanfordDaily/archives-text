# Double bill starts theater season
## '12 Pound Look' and 'Dogg's Hamlet' begin the summer right 
### William Thomas 
I can always tell summer is
really here when the Stanford
Summer Theater begins. Sum
mer theater is characterized —
like so many other summer
things — by its occurrence dur
ing the summer, hence the name
"summer theater." Specifically,
these are the three warmer
months — June, July and Au
gust — of the year. But only in

the Northern Hemisphere. In
the Southern Hemisphere,
everything is backward, and
these are the three colder
months. But that doesn't mat
ter. We live here, not there.
Anyway, back to the point.
This year's summer theater has
begun and the Stanford Drama
Department is starting the
season with a double bill of J.
M. Barrie's "The Twelve Pound
Look," and Tom Stoppard's

"Dogg's Hamlet."
"The Twelve Pound Look"
recounts the events of a day in
the life of Victorian Age Harry
Sims, an upper-middle-class
man whose life is devoted to
success. On this particular day,
Harry Sims receives the official
word that he is to be knighted.
In preparation for the numer
ous congratulatory notices to
which he will undoubtedly need
to respond, Harry commissions
the services of a professional
typist. This turns out to be his
first wife, Kate, who had left
him abruptly years before. As
the one-act drama unfolds, we
discover the reasons behind her
hasty departure and recognize
the play's condemnation of Har
ry's self-absorbed climb to
heights of respectability.
The play is an interesting, if
biting, social commentary as
self-empowered Kate gently at
tempts to avoid poking and
prodding at Harry's ego, a proc
ess that belies the gouges she
leaves in it. It is a production
that makes a calculated attempt
at presenting every ounce of Vic
torian stodginess allowed by the
script.
If Victorian stodginess were
compelling (it isn't), "12 Pound
Look" could perhaps also be
compelling. But this play is
theater from the past that can
only speak to us in the '90s
indirectly.
The second half of the double
feature is "Dogg's Hamlet." Its
program states, "The incest of
the rarified and the ridiculous
is manifest in Tom Stoppard's
'Dogg Language."' Whatever. It
is best to put intellectualism
aside, sweet prince, and to sit

back and chuckle at this coked
up, peppy set of antics and non
sequiturs.
The timing and choreo
graphed movement of this high
energy show create a pre
packaged cartoon. Very little on
stage smacks of angst or
tragedy: The stage consists of
blocks with phosphorescent let
tering; the music is a hodge
podge of LSJtJMB, rock and
baroque classics; and the cast is
a dose of cute, smiling, happy
people. It is a version of Shake
speare's "Hamlet" only because
the script contains a selection
of the great bard's lines.
The show begins with a seg
ment of nonsensical lines
delivered by a bustling crew of
Stanford students, a robed dean
and a posh Dean Jean figure.
This scene meanders into a flip,
hip version of "Hamlet" with
casual scene changes and
slapstick sight-gags. When, in
the tradition of Shakespeare,
the stage is strewn with corpses,
the cast proceeds to perform a
well-known, one-minute version
of the true "Hamlet."
Blazing through the moments
of "Hamlet," the show really
does present a tale told by
'toons, signifying nothing. But,
as always with Stoppard,
whether or not you have a palate
for existential trauma, this car
toon will have something for you
to enjoy.
