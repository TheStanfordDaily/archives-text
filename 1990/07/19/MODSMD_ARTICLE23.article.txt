# Mamet's 'Shawl' â€” it's very captivating
## 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
David Mamet's play, "The
Shawl," will wrap you up in
stantly.
This summer at the Nitery,
the lights come up to reveal the
first meeting between John, a
supposed psychic, and Miss A,
a woman distraught over her
mother's will. As the session
goes on, John amazes Miss A
with his "magic." How does he
know? How can he guess so
much information about her?
We encounter a second side of
John in his relationship with
his lover Charlie, to whom John
presents himself as a business
man who makes money by
relying on his powers of close
observation and his ability to
get people to trust him. Still,
Charlie and the audience feel
uneasy about this explanaton.
Does John's "power" truly stem
just from archives, photographs
and brilliant inferences?
Tension builds as the two
women pull John in different
directions. If all these "super
natural powers" are simple ma
nipulation, reasons Charlie,
then John should use them to
get Miss A to turn over all of
her mother's money to herself
and John. Yet John falters as
he delves deeper into Miss A's
past, leading us to wonder if
John's power is really just a
scam, or if he actually can see

into this woman's life.
Ultimately, Mamet uses the
discussion of a certain red shawl
to embody both the woman's
questions about her mother and
the audience's questions about
John. The play ends with all
these questions unanswered, re
sulting in a spooky confusion of
appearances and reality.
The three actors' perform
ances are as captivating as the
script. Ryan Page, who directs
the play, portrays the two sides
of John fluently, alternating mo
ments of intensity and coolness.
Linda Roberts is a quirky,
manipulative Charlie, and
Susan Imhoff supports the ten
sion throughout the play by cap
turing Miss A's nervous
demeanor and frequent displays
of emotion.
Directing and acting in the
same play was a new experience
for Ryan, a graduate student in
the Drama Department. "It was
hard to do both," he said, "but
fun in a small show. There were
lots of places where I'd like to
have been able to stand back
and watch, instead of trying to
see everything with a third eye."
Susan Imhoff, another drama
graduate student, also helped
direct.
An interesting twist in Page's
version is the relationship be
tween John and Charlie. In
Mamet's script, Charlie is played
by a man.
