# 'Chaos' doesn't waste one precious minute
## 
### Ted Wong 
In a play that is only a half
hour long, there's little room for
waste, and in "Chaos Come
Again," playwright Humphrey
Gyde doesn't waste a single line.
From the moment the stage
lights come up, Gyde draws us
straight to the issues at the
heart of his play. Julia,
portrayed by Alicia Miller, di
rectly tells the audience to
wonder whether she's crazy or
not. As I watched, she seemed
about as crazy as the person
sitting next to me. But by the
time the play had ended, I found
myself asking not only whether
Julia was crazy, but whether my
neighbor — and even whether
I — was quite as sane as I had
thought.
Julia tells us that she has a
habit of involving herself in

destructive relationships. "It's a
reflex," she says, but as we
watch one of these relationships
evolve, it's becomes hard to
decide whether it is as much of
a reflex as it is a cruel streak.
Julia meets Bertie (Ray
O'Neal) at a party, and they
seem to like each other, until
Julia's good friend Emma
(Rebecca Clyde) enters the pic
ture. Emma latches on to Bertie
and soon lures him away from
Julia.
At first Julia wonders
whether to engage in "damage
control" or simply to "smack"
her friend. Julia's eventual re
sponse is surprising in its cold
ness and cruelty. I walked out
of "Chaos" feeling vaguely like
I did after watching "Fatal At
traction": I wondered how many
of the people I meet each day
are really monsters underneath.
