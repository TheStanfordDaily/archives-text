# Searching for intelligence?
## Look no further than Lily Tomlin's one-woman show 
### William Thomas Staff writer 
One of Lily Tomlin's characters muses, "I worry
that whoever thought up the term "quality con
trol" thought that if we didn't control it, it might
get out of hand."
She may as well have been targeting the current
ego-masters of comedy — such as Eddie Murphy
and Andrew Dice Clay — who get their "Raw"
stuff cooked and their crap games ended in the
face of Tomlin's enlightened humor.
Tomlin's "The Search for Signs of Intelligent
Life in the Universe" does not use the old, tired
stand-up comedy format, nor does it oppressively
attack, or present, ignorance for cheap laughs.
The performance reveals how much these adoles
cent games perpetuate a pimpled, putrid naivete.
This was an especially appropriate revelation
for Saturday night, as the show was a benefit
performance to support The San Francisco AIDS
Foundation, Pets Are Wonderful and Project Open
Hand.
The comedy is a one-woman show, with Tomlin
playing all the roles. At one point, Tomlin has
three women up on stage, moving around, cpn
versing and physically interacting. The physical
control she exhibits is astounding. Each character
possesses his or her own mannerisms and
uniquely utilizes the space on the stage. And you
can recognize each one as he/she leaves and re
enters the stage throughout the evening.
As if this alone were not enough, each character
expresses his or her own range of emotions
through individual vocal quality; it is as if each
of the eight characters were created from a sep
arate palette of vocal textures and ranges. Each
character is fleshed out into a complete, if ex
treme, person. In spite of a potentially show
stopping spotlight failure on Saturday, Tomlin
presented eight people for the audience to empa
thize with and experience.
The closest thing to a narrator Tomlin's show
has is Trudy, the bag-lady who has gone insane

in spite of a history that includes electroshock
treatment. Trudy presents a worldly point of view
that is poingnant because it is marginalized by
her sanity.
During her sudden, intense hallucinations,
Trudy is privy to the lives of an angst-ridden
15-year-old whose parents have locked her out
and changed the lock on the front door, a woman
bored with boredom, a woman too afraid to com
mit suicide, and a pair of L.A. prostitutes.
Samuel Beckett, after insisting that humans
are always doomed to fail, urged humanity to
fail again but fail better. "The Search for Signs
of Intelligent Life in the Universe" adds liberal
political correctness and existential hedonism to
this. Through the waves of energy Tomlin exudes
toward the crowd, a confused metaphysics of the
modern world is constructed. The final message
is that any claim to explain the meaning of ex
istence is guaranteed to be a load of garbage.
The important thing is that we should enjoy
manufacturing and refining this garbage.
Jane Wagner's script is moving even as it con
tinuously delivers tremendous one-liners. My
guest at the show informed me that at no point
was there an absence of laughter for more than
45 seconds. At the same time, however, the au
dience was moved to gasps and terrible silences
as characters faced life-rending moments.
A sudden smack of nihilism floors the audience
at one point as the idealistic feminist past of one
character falls away in her attempts to support
twins in the face of job loss, divorce and the
death of a dear friend. Of course, her psychiatrist
thinks her depression is caused by an aberration
in her monthly cycle.
Chrissy, a character worried to the point of
suicide yet too anxious about the consequences
to try it, says, "All my life I've wanted to be
somebody. But I see now I should have been
more specific." It is a corny thing to say, but I
must say it: If Lily Tomlin were not already
somebody, which I suppose she is, she is somebody
as a result of this performance alone.
