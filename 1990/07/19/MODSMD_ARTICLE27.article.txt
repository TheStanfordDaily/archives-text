# Masterful drama for 'Hire'
## 
### Sarah Laurence Editorial staff 
"I'm not a thug; I'm Mon
sieur Hire," pleads the little
man in the beautifully cut
suit. Yes, but who is Monsieur
Hire? Bald, gracious, gentle
killer of white mice and quiet
voyeur, this title character re
mains a mystery throughout
"Monsieur Hire" and presents,
along with the movie's other
characters, the enigmas on
which this French film thrives.
In "Monsieur Hire," no one
is two-dimensional, and no one
is sane. Idiosyncrasies in the
characters' personalities ren
der them both believable and
fascinating. Hire (Michel
Blanc) always plays a certain

rhythmic piano concerto on
his record player when he
peeps through the window at
Alice (Sandrine Bonnaire),
who lives across the street.
Alice herself doesn't mind; she
even asks Hire to lunch be
cause "it's agreeable to be
watched."
But it isn't agreeable to be
watched when you're dispos
ing of evidence that you killed
someone. It never becomes
clear whether Alice really loves
Hire or is seeing him only to
protect her fianc6. Emile (Luc
Thuillier), a punk who has ac
cidentally killed a girl while
robbing her.
The plot of "Monsieur Hire"
and the psyche of its charac
ters are so twisty that by the
end of the movie you can't see

straight. But what you do see
in the dizziness of this film is
impressive. Director Patrice
Leconte creates masterful
shots, like the stormy scene in
which Alice first sees Hire
watching her when a flash of
lightning illuminates his
strange little face in the win
dow opposite hers.
Themes carried throughout
the film, from Hire's affinity
for scarves to the ambivalence
displayed in every love affair,
enhance but don't explain the
story.
This is no summer movie.
It isn't comfortable or funny,
and the ending isn't happy.
But "Monsieur Hire" is worth
seeing.
