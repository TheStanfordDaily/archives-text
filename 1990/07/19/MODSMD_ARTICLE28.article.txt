# 'Jungle Book' is a natural fantasy
## 
### Robert Abrams 
"The Jungle Book" opens to the audience a
rich fantasy about the virtue of nature. This is
one of those rare movies worth paying six dollars
to see.
Inspired by Rudyard Kipling's "Mowgli" stories,
"The Jungle Book" is more of a moving painting
than a cartoon. Realistically textured thatched
roofs on village huts and a very wet-looking water
fall are among the more striking images. The
film's background, styled by A 1 Dempster, imparts
a sense of depth rarely seen in animated films.
Mowgli, an infant "man-cub," is found in the
jungles of India by Bagheera the Panther. Mowgli
is lost in the jungle because his parents' boat
was ripped in half sometime before the movie
begins. Bagheera, ignoring his better instincts,
is attracted by a "sound one never hears" in the
jungle and ends up taking Mowgli to a wolf pack
to raise him.
About ten years later, Shere Khan the Tiger,
who hates all men because they kill with their
guns, returns to Mowgli's part of the jungle.
Fearing for Mowgli's safety, the wolves have Bag
heera take him back to a man-village. Getting
to the man-village takes longer than Bagheera
expects because the party runs into a singing
menagerie of elephants, monkeys, vultures and
a snake.
"The Jungle Book" espouses the idea of nature's
purity. The jungle is good. The world of men is
a world of guns and evil. Baloo the Bear, Mowgli's
second protector, worries that "the man-village
will ruin" Mowgli. In the jungle, life is as simple
as pulling a banana off a branch and crawling
up a tree at night to snooze.
While it would be prudent to regard this mes
sage with a little caution — this is an animated
film, after all — the vision is not entirely off the
mark, since hunter-gatherer societies do, in
reality, have a lot of time to converse and amuse
themselves.
As well as being an antithesis of the world
outside the movie theater, the jungle is painted

as a reflection of Mowgli'fi mood. When he is sad,
the air is dark and rainy. When he is happy, the
forest is bright.
"The Jungle Book" is a like-it-in-your-gut flick,
as well as a technically magnificent film. Every
moment, from the climbing of a tree to the knot
ting of Kaa the Snake, is imbued with wit. Each
character has been given a distinctive movement
with a voice to match.
This exuberant film has only one flaw. At the
very end, when Baloo and Bagheera have finally
brought Mowgli to the edge of the man-village,
The Girl, (this is how she is described in the
credits, which is appropriate as she is the only
female in the entire movie, with the exception
of Col. Hathi the Elephant's wife), approaches
the river singing, "My father is out hunting in
the jungle. My mother is in the village cooking.
I have come to fetch the water, and when I grow
up I will be cooking, and have a daughter who
I will send to fetch the water while my husband
hunts." Since the film was made in 1967, these
conditioned gender role-expectations should be
taken with a grain of salt.
I would, however, like to suggest a way to
interpret this scene which removes its sexist con
notations. The Girl sees Mowgli. She clearly wants
him, so she bats her eyes at him. The Girl realizes
that Mowgli is a product of the jungle, where no
one has to work very hard.
She obviously can't reveal that in her village
the women make the men do all the work, so
The Girl sings about how the women cook and
fetch the water. Mowgli follows her into the village
with blissful ignorance in his eyes. Just after the
movie ends, The Girl slams shut the village gate,
and Mowgli spends the rest of his days slaving
over a hot stove.
The Park Theater in Menlo Park, where "The
Jungle Book" is playing, boasts a pleasant absence
of cinemuck (all that soda popcorn gunk that
often sticks to the floor of movie theatres). This
