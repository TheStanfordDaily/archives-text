## TSAP does 'Merchant of Venice' with a modern touch 
### William Thomas Staff writer 
The Stanford Actors Project
(TSAP) bills "The Merchant of
Venice" as a "dark comedy of
greed, love and hypocrisy." The
play is certainly all of these
things. And the artistic director
of TSAP is apparently of the
opinion that some fascist black
shirts on stage augment these
qualities, since the show is set
in Mussolini's Italy of 1936.
Nazis, inserted in the roles of
Salerio and Solanio, add youth
ful, exuberant malevolence to
the show. However, their pres
ence is so downplayed and their
violence so subtle that they are
overpowered by the rest of the
play, and the potential for a fiery
confrontation between them and
Shylock, the Jewish
moneylender, is never realized.
Lewis Sims plays a crotchety
Shylock, yet one with a spry
manner, intent on achieving
deserved revenge. Antonio, a
merchant with a penchant for
anti-semitic commentary, be
comes indebted to Shylock with
the collateral of one pound of
flesh. Sims' performance is in
triguing as he brings a sense of
righteousness to Shylock's insis
tence on the terms of this agree
ment.
At the same time as this
dealing is going on, the play fea
tures three couples who traverse
rocky ground as each goes
through a process of asserting
and reinforcing their love, all
made possible by the money

from Antonio's debt.
As far as I know, all of Shake
speare's comedies end happily,
and this is no exception. Yet, as
a result of a well-coordinated
effort among the actors, an ar
tistic vision and a time-wizened
script, the final feel-good scene
does not actually feel good.
The insidious suppression of
Shylock's equally insidious
revenge occurs on a legal tech
nicality. As a result, all of the
Jew's beloved property is for
feited to Antonio, his one-time
debtor.

Shylock's beliefs are stripped
from him as well. The law de
mands that he become Chris
tian. His dear daughter has
already gone this route, having
run off with a Christian and a
large share of Shylock's fortune.
Erased by his defeat, the Jew
no longer exists at all.
Along with "The Merchant of
Venice," this year's program in
cludes an original script called
"Getting to Know Your Mecha
nism," and the children's pro
ductions, "Shakespeare Alive"
and"The Little Prince."
