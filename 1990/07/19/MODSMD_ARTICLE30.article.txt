# Dine in the open air, for a price

One of the highlights of living in California is
being able to spend much of the day outdoors.
Dinner at The Gatehouse Restaurant is an elegant
ending to a day of fun in the sun.
Decorated with flower pots, candlelit tables and
a picturesque fountain in the corner, The
Gatehouse's large garden patio is the ideal place
to spend a summer evening. Although the res
taurant has a large indoor dining hall, most
dinner-goers opt for the outside seating.
After one glance at the menu, I knew it would
take at least 15 minutes to decide what to order.
While menus at some restaurants seem to narrow
your choices, the offerings at The Gatehouse all
looked incredibly appetizing.
I finally decided to begin dinner with an ap
petizer of calamari strips, which were deep-fried
and served with homemade cocktail sauce. Unlike
other restaurants which serve calamari in rings,
or sometimes in large clumps that still have
tentacles attached, these were large, tender pieces
of* seafood cooked to perfection.
Next I ordered the Tenderloins of Chicken
Jerusalem, tender pieces of boneless chicken cov
ered with artichoke hearts and mushrooms and
covered with a wine-based sauce. My companion

chose poached halibut which came in a special
vinegrette sauce.
For a restaurant of this caliber — especially
considering its moderate to expensive prices (a
dinner for two can cost anywhere from $30 to
$80) — you expect fresh, high-quality, tasty
dishes. Both the chicken and the halibut
pleasantly met my expectations, and I enjoyed
the dinner tremendously.
Even after a filling dinner, all the desserts on
the menu looked so tempting that it seemed a
crime not to order any. After a few minutes of
debating between the Amaretto Cheesecake and
the Pecan Pie, we chose the latter. Along with
the freshly brewed coffee, the homemade pie
topped the dinner off perfectly.
After the restaurant stops serving dinner, the
bar continues to serve drinks. On a summer
Friday or Saturday night, the outside patio is
usually packed well past midnight. On Thursday
to Saturday nights, all year round, there is live
entertainment in the bar and no cover charge.
Overall, The Gatehouse is a great place to enjoy
dinner and drinks under a star-studded sky. It
is truly what living in California is all about.
The Gatehouse, located on 265 Lytton Avenue,
is open Monday through Saturday for lunch and
dinner, Sundays for champagne brunch ($14.95
a person), and dinner.
