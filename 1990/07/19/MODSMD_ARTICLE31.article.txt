# Mexico's 'little star' shines bright

### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
Is it only me, or does it also
bother you that the best
Mexican food in Palo Alto is at
Taco Bell? Well, my prayers —
or at least the growls in my
stomach — have been answered.
And all because of a venture to
Estrellita Restaurant, in Los
Altos.
Originating in a private house
during the '50s, Estrellita —
"little star" in Spanish — has
expanded to its present location
at 971 N. San Antonio Road. In
1978, sisters Nancy Corlay and
Beatrice Clark took over, and
they say the service and the food
have never been better. Be sure
to come early on Friday and Sat
urday nights, or else be prepared
to wait your turn!

As soon as we walked in, a
huge table covered with large
and tempting entries confronted
us. These, we soon learned, are
the specials, a favorite part of
the Estrellita menu. Rotating
every few weeks, the dishes rep

many regions of Mexico. "We're
trying to do a lot of different
things here," explained Beatrice,
"to present the best of Mexico."
Around holidays, such as Christ
mas, the sisters strive even
harder to outdo this already ex

dining room, I took a look
around at the decorations that
make the restaurant not fancy,
but festive: posters of Mexico,
strings of straw and paper orna
ments, and colorful tablecloths.
However, I focused most of my

attention on the menu because
the variety that Beatrice had
mentioned was clearly evident
in the selection of dishes: ap
petizers such as nachos and
quesadillas and lots of excellent
burrito choices and combination
plates, all at prices ranging from
about $5 to $8.50.
A quesadilla (which was ex
cellent) and a salad later, my
friend and I dove into the main
course, sampling the best of
both worlds. While M mi amigo"
chomped the spicy Chicken
Oaxaca from the specials list
with a pitcher of water in hand,
I decided to stay a little further
north and devoured a chicken
taco and enchilada combination
from the regular menu.
Both plates, at first sight,
