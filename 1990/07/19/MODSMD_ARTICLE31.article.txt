# Mexico's 'little star' shines bright
## 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
Is it only me, or does it also
bother you that the best
Mexican food in Palo Alto is at
Taco Bell? Well, my prayers —
or at least the growls in my
stomach — have been answered.
And all because of a venture to
Estrellita Restaurant, in Los
Altos.
Originating in a private house
during the '50s, Estrellita —
"little star" in Spanish — has
expanded to its present location
at 971 N. San Antonio Road. In
1978, sisters Nancy Corlay and
Beatrice Clark took over, and
they say the service and the food
have never been better. Be sure
to come early on Friday and Sat
urday nights, or else be prepared
to wait your turn!

As soon as we walked in, a
huge table covered with large
and tempting entries confronted
us. These, we soon learned, are
the specials, a favorite part of
the Estrellita menu. Rotating
every few weeks, the dishes rep
resent the traditional cooking of
many regions of Mexico. "We're
trying to do a lot of different
things here," explained Beatrice,
"to present the best of Mexico."
Around holidays, such as Christ
mas, the sisters strive even
harder to outdo this already ex
otic selection.
After being seated in the large
dining room, I took a look
around at the decorations that
make the restaurant not fancy,
but festive: posters of Mexico,
strings of straw and paper orna
ments, and colorful tablecloths.
However, I focused most of my

attention on the menu because
the variety that Beatrice had
mentioned was clearly evident
in the selection of dishes: ap
petizers such as nachos and
quesadillas and lots of excellent
burrito choices and combination
plates, all at prices ranging from
about $5 to $8.50.
A quesadilla (which was ex
cellent) and a salad later, my
friend and I dove into the main
course, sampling the best of
both worlds. While M mi amigo"
chomped the spicy Chicken
Oaxaca from the specials list
with a pitcher of water in hand,
I decided to stay a little further
north and devoured a chicken
taco and enchilada combination
from the regular menu.
Both plates, at first sight,
were HUGE. If you are going
to go to Estrellita, which I sug
gest you do at the first oppor
tunity, do not violate Beatrice's
number one rule, "Don't you
think you can come to my res
taurant unless you are very,
very hungry!"
Feeling a little smaller than
my meal, but nonetheless un
daunted, I plunged into the de
licious red sauce and light corn
tortilla of the enchilada, follow
ing that with a few mouthfuls
of beans and Spanish rice. After
chatting with several other cus
tomers, Beatrice came over to
help me with the taco, wrapping
it in a napkin like she would do

for one of her own "bambinos,"
so that I could gobble up the
zesty chicken topped, surpris
ingly enough, with parmesan
cheese. Talk about service!
Believe it or not, we even
found room to taste Estrellita's
traditional Mexican desserts: a
flan and some sopapillas, which
are fried tortillas coated with
sugar. We didn't want Beatrice
to think we were wimps!
The next time you want to
make a run for the border, drive
that extra mile and get a real
taste of Mexico. Estrellita not
only meets my basic require
ments — good chips, good salsa
(two kinds!), good tortillas and
good guacamole — but the se
lection of favorites and unique
choices, as well as the friendly
atmosphere, make this "little
star" shine especially bright.
