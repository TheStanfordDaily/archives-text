# New comic series is worthy of attention

### Sarah Laurence Editorial staff 
Bearing the name of the first
First Lady, Martha Washington,
the main character in Frank
Miller and Dave Gibbons' new
comic book series, "Give Me
Liberty: An American Dream,"
is a heroine of a different color.
Born a black girl in a Chicago
housing project, in a 1995 no
one should live to see, Martha
is street-smart and computer
wise and her adventures are far
from comic.
Miller, the man who restored
the mystery of Batman in his
graphic novel, "The Dark
Knight Returns," and co-wrote
the screenplay of "Robocop 2,"
spins a taut yarn in "Homes
and Gardens," the premier issue
of "Give Me Liberty." Miller in
terweaves his story with
drawings by Gibbons, artist of
the famed "Watchmen" 6eries,
to form an intricate, albeit
blood-stained, tapestry of social
commentary.
The "home" in this issue's
title is The Green (Martha's
name for Cabrini Green, the

housing project in which she
lives). In this vision of the fu
ture, the project's three original
buildings have been walled into
a colossal box that spans several
city blocks. There is no vegeta
tion to justify calling this prison
like structure The Green, but
Gibbons appropriately tints all
the frames that take place there
an institutional shade of olive.
A ravaged tropical rain forest
is the "garden" where Martha,
who joins the oxymoronic Peace
Force after escaping from a men
tal institution, fights in a saucy
combat between hamburger
companies and the U.S. govern
ment.
Though the story tends
toward heavy-handedness in its
treatment of today's fashionable
issues, the comic is insightful
and powerful enough to redeem
this shortcoming. Gibbons' in
spired art conveys strong emo
tions within the restrictions of
the cartoon medium.
If you want to take a peek at
upcoming decades, or if you just
like comic books, "Give Me
Liberty" is worth looking over.
