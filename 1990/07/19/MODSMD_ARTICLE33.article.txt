## Stanford athletes fare well at Olympic Festival 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The U.S. Olympic Festival
was begun 12 years ago as a
showcase for up-and-coming
Olympic stars. If that pattern
holds true there should be a lot
of Stanford graduates faring
well in Barcelona in 1992.
A large number of Stanford
athletes, both past and present,
fared well at this year's festival
in Minneapolis, giving the rest
of the NCAA, and the world,
reason to be alarmed.
Two graduates won individual
goal medals at the event, which
ended Sunday, and two others
nearly did. Erica Wheeler won
the women'B javelin competition

with a track-record throw of 174
feet, 10 inches. Jennifer Yu, an
other graduate, cruised to the
title in the women's foil division
of the fencing competition, win
ning 5-1, 5-4 in the final.
Conrad Voorsanger, who grad
uated last month, earned silver
medals in both the parallel bars
and the high bar and placed
third in the pommel horse event
at the gymnastics competition.
Graduate Pam Dukes also took
home a silver, in the shot put,
and junior Kristin Jensen placed
sixth in the platform diving.
In team sports, three Cardinal
soccer players came home with
gold medals. Junior Rhett Harty
and sophomore Lance Killian
helped the West team to a 1-0

win over the North in the men's
gold medal game.
On the women's side, sopho
more Julie Foudy scored a pair
of goals to propel the North to
a 10-0 victory over the South.
Foudy had earlier scored her
team's first goal in the festival,
scoring off Stanford goalkeeper
Elise Edwards in the first game
of round-robin play.
Foudy's team was basically
the U.S. national teem while the
South, coached by Stanford
Coach Berhane Andeberhan,
was partially comprised of mem
bers of the under-19 national
team. Andeberhan is the U.S.
under-19 national team coach.
In women's volleyball, junior
Amy Cooper led the West team

to an undefeated record in pool
play but they fell to the North
15-13, 15-6, 12-15, 15-3 in the
championship game. Cooper was
a first-team All-Pacific 10 Con
ference selection as a freshman
in 1988.
On the men's side, juniors
Duncan Blackman and Robert
Hillman squared off in the final
with Hillman's South team com
ing out on top. They defeated
the North 15-13, 9-15, 11-15, 16-
14, 15-13 to clinch the gold
medal. Both Hillman and Black
man, starting outside hitters for
the Cardinal in 1990, starred
for their respective teams.
Junior John Hribar also
played in the festival. His team,
the West, finished fourth.

Card notes
Val Whiting, who led her West
team to the silver medal, was se
lected as one of 16 finalists for the
U.S. junior national team. Whiting,
a 6-foot-3 sophomore center,
averaged 16.5 points and 9.0
rebounds in four festival games.
The team is for athletes who are
20 or younger.
Twelve players will be selected
from the list of 16 to comprise the
U.S. team which will play a series
of exhibitions against the Canadian
developmental team in late July and
early August. Fifteen of the players
selected competed in the Olympic
Festival. The 16th is Morningside
High School's Lisa Leslie, the Na
tional High School Player of the
Year.
