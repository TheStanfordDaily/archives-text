# Card swimmers set to spread Goodwill
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The need for the name of the event
is becoming obsolete, ticket sales are
well below expectations and a plane
of athletes nearly caused a military
panic, but four years after they began,
the Goodwill Games are back.
After opening in 1986 as an effort
to get the athletic teams from the
U.S. and the Soviet Union to meet,
the second edition of the made-for-TV
sporting event begins tomorrow in
Seattle and several surrounding com
munities.
With goodwill between the two
countries becoming the rule instead
of the exception, the original purpose
behind the games may be disappear
ing. But with world-class fields com
peting in almost every event, the value
to sports fans continues to rise.
A Soviet plane carrying athletes was
intercepted by U.S. fighters last week
after entering American airspace a day
before expected, but that problem was
quickly solved. And while first
plane of Soviets made a well
publicized entrance, several Cardinal
stars found a more quiet route to the
Pacific Northwest.
Stanford is very well represented
in swimming, where seven athlete and
a coach will be at the competition.
Cardinal women's Coach Richard
Quick will head the U.S. women's
squad and the odds are good he will
see some familiar faces when he looks

at the medal platform. The swimming
competition begins Friday and runs
through Tuesday in Federal Way,
Wash.
The biggest name is Stanford soph
omore Janet Evans, who will swim
four events at the Goodwill Games.
Evans currently holds the world
record in the 400-, 800- and 1,500-
meter freestyle and won three events
at the NCAA championships in March.
Evans will compete in the three
events in which she holds world
records as well as the 400-meter in
dividual medley.
Evans' teammate and classmate
Janel Jorgensen will swim three
events for the U.S. this weekend. Jor
gensen will swim the 100- and 200-
meter butterflies as well as the 200-
meter IM, the three events she won
at the NCAA meet.
Summer Sanders, who will enroll
at Stanford this fall, will swim two
events for the U.S. squad. The
Roseville, Calif., native will compete
with Evans in the 400-meter IM and
with Jorgensen in the 200-meter but
terfly.
Jill Johnson, who capped her senior
season by winning the 200-yard
breaststroke at the NCAA champion
ships, will swim the 200-meter breast
stroke this weekend. Junior Dede
Trimble will swim the 200-meter
backstroke for the U.S.
On the men's side, junior Alex Kos

1,500-meter freestyle.
Incoming freshman Derek Weather
ford of Ft. Myers, Fla., will swim the
200-meter backstroke for the U.S.
The diving competition will also be
held in Federal Way. Dr. Rick
Schavone, the Stanford coach, is one
of three members of the U.S. coaching
staff for the competition.
Two other Stanford athletes who
will have a shot at gold medals are
Jennifer Azzi and Sor\ja Henning. The
two are currently in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, playing for the U.S. wom
en's basketball team at the world
championships. The team defeated
Senegal 106-36, South Korea 87-55
and Czechoslovakia 86-59 in the
opening round of pool play.
The Americans then defeated Cuba
87-78 in the second round of pool
play Tuesday.
After that tournament Azzi, Hen
ning and Co. will travel to Seattle to
play in the Goodwill Games. That
competition begins Aug. 1.
Three Cardinal juniors will also be
in the running for medals. Roger Bur
nett, David McCarty and Troy Tall
man are all starting for the U.S. base
ball team that has been playing the
last month. The team is playing three
games against Cuba, including a con
test from Havana that will be televised
live Saturday afternoon.
The Americans will open Goodwill
Game competition with an historic
contest against a team from the Soviet
Union July 26.
