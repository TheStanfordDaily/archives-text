# Hombrecher joins pro tour
## 
### 
Alexis Hombrecher, a key performer on
the 1990 NCAA champion men's tennis
team, has decided to forego his final three
years of eligibility and join the professional
tour.
Hombrecher, from Suisun, Calif., played
at No. 5 and No. 6 singles for the Cardinal
as a freshman this year. He compiled a 20-5
singles record as the Cardinal won its third
consecutive NCAA title. Hombrecher
teammed with Jeff Cathrall to post a 9-1
record at No. 2 doubles.
"Stanford tennis was fortunate to have

Alexia this past year," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said.
"He was most instrumental
in our national champion
ship season and performed
well at the NCAAs. We will
miss him but we wish him
well on the (pro) circuit."
Hombrecher won three of
his four singles matches in

the NCAA tournament this past May in
Indian Wells, Calif. He defeated Toby Brown
6-4, 6-4 in Stanford's 5-1 win over Oklahoma
State; Scott Stewart 6-4, 6-4 in the Cardi
nal's 5-1 win over Texas; and Paul Brandt
6-1, 6-3 in a 5-3 win over USC in the team
semifinals. He and Cathrall lost 7-6 (7-4),
2-6, 7-6 (8-6) at No. 2 doubles against USC
as well.
In the final Hombrecher fell to John Gib
son 6-4, 6-4 as the Cardinal beat Tennessee
5-2. Cathrall and Hombrecher won their
first-round match in the doubles competi
tion before losing in straight sets in the
second round.
Hombrecher made his announcement last
Friday after losing in the first round of the
Hall of Fame Classic in Newport, R.I. He
won three matches in the qualifying before
the tournment in order to enter the main
draw.
Going into the tournament Hombrecher
was ranked 457 th in the world but he
defeated players ranked 437, 163 and 404
to reach the main draw. There he lost to
Richard Matuszewski 1-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0.
Hombrecher had a fine junior career
before coming to Stanford. The highlight
was his winning the 1989 USTA National
Hardcourts champion in the 18-and-under
category. He was ranked fifth in the nation
in the 18s that year.
This is the third consecutive year that a
Cardinal player has elected to leave school
early to pursue a pro career after winning
the NCAA team title. David Wheaton turned
pro after his freshman season in 1988 while
junior Jeff Tarango and sophomore Martin
Blackman both left the Farm after the 1989
NCAA championships.
Wheaton and Tarango both played mainly
at No. 1 singles for Stanford while Blackman
played at No. 3 his final year.
Stanford finished 1990 with a 25-3 record
and finished second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with a 7-3 mark. The national title,
the school's third of the year, was the 11th
for the men's tennis team. The titles have
come in 1973, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981,
1983, 1986 and 1988-90.
