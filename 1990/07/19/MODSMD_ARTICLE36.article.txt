# Osumare dances to Africa
## Stanford instructor to train Malawi troupe 
### Minal Hajratwala Editorial staff 
A dancer by trade, Halifu
Osumare is used to moving
rapidly in the world. And occa
sionally, her leaps even span
continents.
Osumare, program coordina
tor of the Committee on Black
Performing Arts and a lecturer
in the dance division of the Ath
letic Department, left Stanford
Tuesday for the Southeast
African nation of Malawi.
Her month-long commission,
sponsored by the Malawi and
U.S. governments, is part of a
cultural exchange program
called Arts America.
In Malawi, Osumare will help
train the national Kawcha Cul
tural Troupe for international
touring, shaping it into a world
class dance company. Currently,
Senegal is the only African na
tion with a troupe that tours
internationally, according to
Osumare.
Because the West tends to
view Africa as culturally
homogeneous, touring dance
troupes allow "the rest of the
world to know more intimately
about the countries and cultures
of Africa," Osumare said.
At the same time, she added,
"dance is a way in which a coun
try can establish unity among
ethnic and language groups."
Nationalism is only one of the
ways that dance can express po
litical commentary. For example,
one Malawian dance involves
the use of masks and invokes
the spirits of ancestors. But
within this context, Osumare
said, "they have added on cur
rent events, new elements [relat
ing to] political issues,
institutions and figures."
Osumare came to Stanford in
1982. As program coordinator
of the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts, a position she has
held since 1986, she coordinates
classes and special workshops.
Last year she oversaw well
known choreographer Katherine
Dunham's visit to Stanford, as
well as this summer's "Con
versations with Katherine Dun
ham" discussion series. The
final lecture in the series, "A
Black Choreographer's Perspec
tive: Problems of Making

Dances," will also include New
York post-modern choreog
rapher Ralph Lemon, and will
be held Tuesday.
In addition to planning
campus activities, Osumare also
teaches dance-lecture classes
such as African-Caribbean Roots
of American Jazz, and African-
Caribbean Dance Techniques.
"The holistic interaction with
the students, where we dance
together along with the lecture,
is very rewarding," Osumare
said.
To teach these classes,
Osumare has done extensive re
search which she views as "part
of a multicultural trend in the
arts." Much of contemporary so
cial and performance dance has
African origins, and is "a prod
uct of the Atlantic slave trade,"
she said.
"America is a multicultural
society," Osumare said. "There

is cultural diversity in every sec
tor of society, from the univer
sity to the corporate world."
Thus, the integration of
African aesthetics into Western
dance has been the subject of
much attention in recent years,
according to Osumare, who
noted that many scholars are
working on the issue, and
books are being published.
Another academic trend
Osumare has noticed is a more
mature view of world dance.
Critics are increasingly realizing
that what was previously known
as "ethnic dance" is "not just
exotic but has very strong aes
thetic principles," Osumare
said. "The critics are having to
deal with these forms more and
more, and are developing a new
paradigm for looking at them
. . . from a knowledgeable point
of view."
