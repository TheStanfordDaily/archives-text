# Campus reacts to abortion rulings
## 
### Eleni Kirkas 
While high school and college
students around the country
were welcoming the carefree
days of summer, serious deci
sions were being made in high
places, decisions which could
have a profound effect on stu
dents' lives â€” especially on the
lives of the women.
Late last month, the U.S. Su
preme Court announced its de
cisions on two parental
notification abortion statutes
from Ohio and Minnesota. And
in Louisiana, a bill was passed
by the state legislature which
would make it a crime to per
form an abortion, except to save
the life of the mother or in cases
of rape or incest. If signed into
law by the governor, the mea
sure will be the most restrictive
abflKion law in the country, and
could serve as a challenge to
abortion rights in general.
These events, important to
both sides of the abortion
debate, take on an even greater
significance when viewed
against the backdrop of the

landmark Webster v. Reproduc
tive Health Services decision an
nounced a year ago. That
Supreme Court ruling gave the
states greater power to regulate
a woman's right to abortion,
which had been established in
the 1973 Roe v. Wade case.
Although not direct challenges
to the Roe case, the laws now
in the spotlight set important
precedents in the ongoing
debate. The Minnesota and Ohio
statutes both require parental
notification before a minor may
obtain an abortion.
Both statutes were upheld as
constitutional by the court,
though the Minnesota ruling
proved a surprise to activists on
both sides of the issue. One
provision of the law required
that girls notify both parents
before getting an abortion.
Departing from her usual
stance, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor provided the swing
vote which found that provision
alone to be unconstitutional be
cause the state interest would
be equally served by notifying
only one parent. In past abortion
cases, O'Connor has been reluc
tant to label provisions as undue
burdens to women seeking abor
tions.
However, the court also
declared that any notification
law must have a judicial bypass
procedure for girls who do not
wish to inform their parents of
their decision. Because another
provision in the Minnesota
statute provided for such a pro
cedure, the two-parent notifica
tion law as a whole was found
to be constitutional.
Reactions to these rulings on
campus were varied. Those on
the pro-life side of the debate
hailed the decisions as a victory,
while pro-choice advocates saw
them as a serious defeat.
Janice Keen, a member of
Stanford Students for Life,
praised the rulings because
teens, she said, are not emotion
ally mature enough to make
such an important decision
alone, particularly when "emo
tions are running high" during
an unplanned pregnancy.
Moreover, Keen added, all
surgical procedures on minors
require parental consent before
being performed.
Elizabeth Ward, founder of
the Pro-Choice Alliance, also a
Stanford student group, had ob
jections to the rulings. Conced
ing that individual opinions
differ on this difficult issue,
Ward said that most pro-choice
organizations, including the one
she founded, oppose parental
notification and consent
statutes because they "make as
sumptions about family struc
ture which may not be true."
Most girls, she said, do tell at
least one parent of their deci
sion, and those who don't have
legitimate reasons, such as fear
of an abusive parent. To require
these girls to go through a court
procedure, Ward added, simply
makes the decision more har
rowing, and frequently causes
delays that push the pregnancy
into the second trimester, in
creasing the risks of the abor
tion procedure.
"The only good side [of the
Minnesota ruling!," Ward con
cluded, "is that Justice
O'Connor finally found one
provision which she considered
too burdensome."
Keen and Ward also expressed
conflicting opinions of the Lou
isiana bill. "If it saves one more
baby," Keen declared, "it's
great," adding that parents
would also be spared future
"heartache" over the loss of
their children.
However, Keen opposes the
exception for victims of rape and

incest. Abortion, she said,
"doesn't diminish the violation
against the woman," and is still
the taking of a life. To favor
such exceptions, Keen said,
would be wholly inconsistent
with her line of reasoning in the
abortion debate.
Ward, on the other hand, was

"horrified" by the bill, not only
because it could give the court
an opportunity to overturn Roe
if challenged, but also because
"it shows a re-emerging
misogyny" in America."The un
derlying presumption is that
women aren't capable of making
these decisions," she said.
