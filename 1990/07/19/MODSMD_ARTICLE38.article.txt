The shelves in Jeff Raines'
Palo Alto home are overflowing
with books of all sorts. But com
ing up with names for the char
acters in his novels is difficult
nonetheless.
"It's not as easy as you think,"
Raines said. "Sometimes I look
through phone books; other
times, if I'm really stuck, I flip
through the student directory
of Stanford University for inter
esting names."
Last year, Raines, who is 32,
received his master's in engi
neering from Stanford — a place
he never quite forgot. While
writing his second book, a police
thriller called "Unbalanced

Acts," he had an idea.
"Why not name the characters
after Stanford dormitories?" he
thought. "After all, they would
make great psychopaths."
"Unbalanced Acts" begins
with the newly-named psycho
paths taking over the streets of
New York City. Familiar dorms
such as Stern, Wilbur and
Florence Moore Halls suddenly
come to life.
"The food at Stern Hall was
always pretty bad, so I named
the poisoner Lucy Stern,"
Raines said.
A sadistic surgeon was named
after Wilbur Hall, where a med
ical student he knew lived. "I
would never go to [him] for med
ical care," Raines said, chuckling

as he spoke.
Raines named his prison for
the criminally insane after
Toyon Hall, based on his mem
ories of students who lived
there, he said.
Other characters include
Florence Moore, a sex criminal,
and Roble, a psychopathic insur
ance salesman who is named
after the oldest dorm on
campus.
Some may think Raines has
a strange sense of humor, but,
as he said, "There's nothing
wrong with a little revenge."
Raines' future plans include
writing screenplays for Holly
wood, and awaiting the publica
tion of his fourth novel.
