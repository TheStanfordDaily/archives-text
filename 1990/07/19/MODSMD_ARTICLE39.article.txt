# Rains students create summer fun
## 
### Mary B. Haban 
A cut in the budget has not
cut out summer fun for students
in Rains. For the first time in
Rains' two-year history, resi
dents have joined forces to or
ganize a variety of programs —
with no compensation.
In the past, resident assistants
have planned activities at Rains.
But this summer, due to
University-wide budget cuts,
summer RA positions were
eliminated.
Five dollars in house dues
from each resident provided the
necessary funding for a corp of
volunteers to keep the program
running.
"We put out a call for volun
teers and the response was tre
mendous," said Chris Griffith,
assistant director of graduate

residences. "So many people
came forward to really take over
every aspect of planning these
events."
Graduate student Laura Flax
explained that she wanted to
plan activities because there is
so much to see in the Bay Area.
"It took me four years to get
up to see Napa Valley," she said.
Flax, who will be leaving Stan
ford at the end of the summer,
is one resident who has taken
the opportunity to get involved.
In the past few weeks she and
other students have organized a
bowling/pizza trip and a pre-
World Cup champagne brunch.
Students are also planning
events such as a trip to the Ex
pos 6 concert at Great America,
an outing to the water theme
park Raging Waters and square
dancing.

"When graduate students
leave Stanford, they always wish
they had the chance to meet
new people," said Flax. "The vol
unteer program is so special be
cause it is bringing people
together."
The philosophy of staff mem
bers at Rains is "bottom-up," or
"democracy for all." This began
with students attending a casual
dinner and voting for what they
wanted to do and see during the
summer.
The program, said Griffith, is
unique because "students are
not getting paid, but are doing
this because they 'want to' —
and that really says a lot."
Flax said, "Stanford has given
me so much, so many fond mem
ories. This is my way of giving
something back."
