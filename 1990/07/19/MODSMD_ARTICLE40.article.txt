# Irvine grant funds new ethnic courses
## 
### Wendy Bjerknes 
Stanford has decided what it
will do with the first of six in
stallations of a $1 million dollar
grant from the Irvine Founda
tion, members of the grant ad
visory committee said.
The Irvine Multicultural Cur
riculum Development Grant will
enable the University to expand
the existing curriculum to in
clude the history and perspec
tives of American minorities not
traditionally highlighted in
Stanford's course offerings,
goals first put forth by the 1989
Univeristy Committee on Mi
nority Issues report.
The grant will allow the Uni
verisity to address the UCMI
report's recommendations at a
time when funding for anything
new is unlikely because of Stan
ford's commitment to trim $22
million from its operating
budget.
"Despite the good intentions
of the faculty and administra
tion, there is often not enough
time or money to make substan
tial changes to the curriculum;
but this grant will now allow us
to really make some progress,"
said Andrew Lisac, associate
dean of graduate studies and a
member of the advisory com
mittee.
For the upcoming academic
year, the grant will be used for
three new courses, the modifi
cation of six others and the ap
pointments of a visiting
professor in education and a
postdoctoral teaching fellow in
ethnic and religious studies.
Over the remaining five years,
the money will allow Stanford
to ultimately create 18 new
courses and modify 18 existing
ones in several departments.
The committee charged with
distributing the grant evaluated
submissions from professors
who wanted to include ethnic
studies in their courses, and
decided to target the four ethnic
groups listed in the UCMI
report — the African-American,
Asian-American, Native Ameri
can and Chicano/Latino commu
nities.
Incorporating ethnic studies
into the curriculum is "a neces
sary component for the transi
tion from numerical diversity to
an interactive community," said
Tom Wasow, dean of Undergrad
uate Studies and chair of the
advisory committee.
In addition to expanding the
curriculum, the grant will be
used for faculty to attend con
ferences and do research to im
prove their own education,
because "they too were only
taught the accomplishments of

the white male in Western cul
ture," Wasow said.
Although most of the empha
sis for change is on the under
graduate level, some grant
money will go to the Law School
where it will be utilized toward
presenting multiculturical per
spectives that are under
represented in casebooks and in
the classroom. Of the three new
courses to be instituted through
grant money, two will be taught
at the Law School.
The new courses, designed to
confront specific problems
within particular racial and eth
nic groups, will be offered by
various departments.
"Film Images of African-
American Culture," an anthro
pology course taught by
Professor James Gibbs, will ex
amine a series of films to en
courage the discussion and
understanding of African-
American culture.
The "Law School Curriculum
Project" will be implemented to
develop a series of readings,
questions and other materials
to address issues in the standard
first-year law school curriculum.
Another Law School course,
"The Impact of Immigration
Law and Policy on Asian-
American and Mexican-
American Communities," will be
taught by Law Profs. Gerald
Lopes and Bill Hing.
These courses will supplement
existing opportunities for stu
dents to gain interracial experi
ence and understanding.
Currently, racial awareness is
promoted by presentations dur
ing Freshman Orientation, pro
grams sponsored by Residential
Education and annual cultural
events.
In addition, visiting profes
sors covered by the grant will
introduce fresh ideas to Stan
ford's curriculum as well as
work with other professors to
develop existing courses. They
will also increase the percentage
of minority faculty members at
Stanford.
Despite the new course offer
ings, students who avoid ethnic
studies topics cannot be forced
to broaden their knowledge
about other cultures. In order
to confront this problem, the
Faculty Senate will debate this
fall whether to establish an
American Cultures distribution
requirement.
The grant is administered by
an advisory committee made up
of professors from the Law
School, the School of Humani
ties and Sciences and the School
of Education, as well as deans
in Undergraduate and Graduate
Studies.
