# Faculty homes robbed, officers warn residents
## 
### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
A series of "cat burglaries" in the Stan
ford residential area known as the
"faculty ghetto" has prompted the Stan
ford Police to warn residents to secure
their homes at night.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said that four such thefts have occurred
since early May, the last on July 11. In
all four incidents the suspect, or suspects,
entered the house through an open win
dow or door in the early morning, while
the residents were still asleep.
When in the house, the thieves rifled
through purses, stealing petty cash and
car keys, Niemeyer said. On two separate
occasions the individuals drove a car out
of the driveway, later returning it to the
house but in a different spot — minus
half a tank of gas.
According to Niemeyer, all four bur
glaries have occurred on Esplanada Way
and Mayfield Drive.
Police have mailed letters to all resi
dents in that area, asking them to make
sure that all doors and windows are
locked before retiring to bed.
Niemeyer noted in the letter that the
police believe the suspects may be local
juveniles. He requested that parents ask
their children if they have heard anything
"through the grapevine" about the inci
dents, explaining that "young individuals
who commit these crimes often brag

about their exploits."
Niemeyer also requested that residents
call 911 immediately if they even think
they hear someone inside or outside their
homes. In one of the burglaries, a woman
woke her husband and told him she heard
a noise outside. Her husband told her
she was imagining things, Niemeyer said.
The burglaries are part of a larger
crime wave that has swept through
campus.
Police are reporting an increase in van
dalism since early May, as well as many
computer thefts on campus. So far this
year, $144,355 worth of personal com
puters and computer-related equipment
has been stolen from campus according
to the Stanford News Service.
According to Niemeyer, "The problem
with most of the thefts is that the se
curity was not sufficient."
Niemeyer is urging employees to the
Stanford Police Department's Special
Services Unit at 723-9633 about its Of
fice Protection Project. The project will
provide information on computer secu
rity systems.
