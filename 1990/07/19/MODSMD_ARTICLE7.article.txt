# Medical School ranks low in national survey
##

While Stanford School of Medicine is
generally recognized as excellent, it does
not enjoy the prestige of the University's
other professional schools.
Granted, rankings are fickle, but in
the most recent U.S. News and World
Report survey of professional schools, the
Stanford Schools of Business, Engineer
ing and Law were rated first, second and
third respectively while the Medical
School garnered 12th place.
This is not reason for great embar
rassment or regret, but the discrepancy
between the Medical School and the other
professional schools is not simply a
statistical aberration.
In the past, the Medical School has
been criticized by some, and highly
praised by others, for its dedication to
research. Critics, including some matric

ulated students, feel that the concentra
tion on research necessarily detracts
from a thorough clinical education for
students.
According to Medical School Dean Da
vid Korn, the Medical School was origi
nally moved from San Francisco to the
Stanford campus in order to generate an
atmosphere for integrated bio-clinical re
search. "It has more than amply fulfilled
that original purpose," says Korn.
Korn points out that Stanford is by
far the smallest of the top 12 medical
schools in terms of the number of affil
iated hospitals. This results in a smaller
patient population available for class
room experience, and Korn admits that
less quantity usually implies less variety.
However, Korn adds that national as
well as school-sponsored surveys of Stan
ford Medical School graduates have
yielded "very positive feedback." Accord-

ing to Korn, once alumni are in an en
vironment in which they can compare
their knowledge with that of others, they
are usually satisfied.
Korn also points out that "evaluations
of Stanford Medical School graduates
during their residencies typically reveal
the high regard in which they are held.
There does not appear to be evidence of
an education that is lacking."
Although he recognizes that some stu
dents have problems with their Medical
School experience, Korn does not feel
there is a "systematic problem." Surveys
reveal that "there is not an inadequacy
in clinical experience," he says.
Some other medical schools recognized
specifically for their research capacity
are consistently ranked in the top 10. In
particular, UC-San Francisco and Johns
Hopkins are both included in the top 4
of the most recent survey by U.S. News

and World Report. This suggests dedica
tion to research is not the only factor
affecting the Medical School's image.
Another possible factor is what Korn
refers to as "the great myth" — the
Atlantic Coast perception of Stanford as
a "sun-bathed playground" where people
play tennis and swim year-round.
However epic the myth has become,
Korn does not believe it detracts from
the quality of the student body. Stan
ford's perennial competitors are Harvard,
UC-San Francisco, Yale and Johns Hop
kins.
Says Korn, "Although this is somewhat
snide and not meant to suggest that there
are no real problems, we compete effec
tively for the best applicants. They will
then come here and complain like all
medical students have and always will,
and leave satisfied once they can compare
what they have learned."
