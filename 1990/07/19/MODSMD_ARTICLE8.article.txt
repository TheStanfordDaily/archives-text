# Research at Stanford could save many lives

Recent breakthroughs in med
ical science and technology have
demonstrated that researchers
at the Stanford Medical Center
are occupying the forefront of
their respective fields. Promis
ing developments in brain dis
order and cancer treatment are
receiving recognition by some of
the nation's leading medical
journals.
Cyclotron treatment for AVMs
On July 11, the New England
Journal of Medicine published a
study directed by Stanford
neurosurgeon Dr. Gary Stein
berg on the use of cyclo
tron-generated radiation beams
to treat patients with ar
teriovenous malformations
(AVMs), which are life
threatening tangles of blood ves
sels in the brain.
Steinberg said his study has
been getting a lot of publicity
lately. A person whose wife has
an AVM called from his car in
Los Angeles after learning about
the research from a national
radio broadcast, he said.
Steinberg added that he has
been "inundated" with requests
for the new treatment. He said
he has treated four patients
from Sweden, one from Italy,
one from South America and nu
merous people from all over the
U.S.. He expects to see aboutlOO
patients a year, he estimated.
The study, a collaborative ef
fort between Stanford and Uni
versity of California scientists,
is the first to follow and analyze
a large group of patients for
several years after treatment
with cyclotron-generated beams
of heavy charged particles. Com
bined with advanced imaging
techniques, the treatment has
achieved satisfactory results in

94 percent of the 86 cases.
The scientists found out that
the technique can best be ap
plied to treat AVMs located deep
in critical brain structures, cases
which have been virtually im
possible to treat before due to
the risks posed by surgery,
Steinberg said.
Steinberg and his team also
concluded that cyclotron treat
ment works best on small AVMs.
He said every one of the AVMs
that was smaller than an inch
in diameter was obliterated
within three years after initial
treatment. The large AVMs "are
the challenge for the future," he
said.
The new procedure, which
uses angiography — an X-ray of
the brain — to target the AVMs,
does not require brain surgery
and, in most cases, not even
hospitalization. Patients are
scanned at Stanford Hospital
and then sent to the University
of California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory for treat
ment with the cyclotron's
helium-ion beam.
Cyclotron treatment costs
about the same as having an
operation, but hospitalization
costs are saved, said Steinberg.
The procedure is now covered
by all insurance companies,
which means it is not an expe
rimental treatment anymore, he
added.
Hope for cancer patients
Equally impressive develop
ments have been achieved in the
field of oncology. Cancer
patients who cannot be treated
successfully by chemotherapy
because their cancer cells have
developed a resistance to such
drugs may in the future be
helped by new drugs which
reverse or modulate this resis
tance.

Dr. Branimir Sikic, associate
oncology professor at the Stan
ford School of Medicine and head
investigator of the five-year
study, "Expression and Modula
tion of Multidrug Resistance,"
said current laboratory models
indicate that drug resistance can
be reversed.
Drugs being tested include
cyclosporine, a drug used to sup
press rejection in transplant
patients. Sikic said the drug can
bind to the protein that protects
the cancer cells and thus act as
"an effective inhibitor of the
[cells'] outward transport of
anti-cancer drugs."
Potential side effects of the
drug include possible kidney or
liver damage, in addition to sup
pression of the immune system.
The 14 researchers in this study
found that they must use higher
dosages of cyclosporine than are
used on transplant patients, but
at lower frequencies.
Sikic said the physicians have
been able to increase cy
closporine dosages to a level
"very close" to the amount that
worked in laboratory tests with
out any adverse side effects on
the patients.
Patients participating in this
study are diagnosed as "not
curable by other treatments,"
meaning that standard treat
ments have either failed or are
not available, Sikic said.
The study is supported by a
$1.6 million grant from the Na
tional Institutes of Health and
a related grant from the Amer
ican Cancer Society.
Education lowers heart risk
Published yesterday in the
Journal of the American Medical
Association is a ground
breaking study which shows
that inexpensive educational
programs involving the interac

tion of whole communities can
significantly reduce the risk of
heart disease in the population.
This five-year study, called
the Stanford Five-City Project,
compared Monterey and Salinas,
the treatment cities, with
Modesto, San Luis Obispo and
Santa Maria, which served as
control cities. Dr. John Far
quhar, director of the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease
Prevention and leader of the
study, enlisted the help of com
munity leaders to develop his
program.
After five years of concen
trated health education in the
treatment cities — which in
cluded television and radio ad
vertisements on "healthy heart"
habits, workshops and school
based programs — researchers
detected significant drops in
blood pressure, blood choles
terol, resting pulse rates and
smoking rates in the communi
ties. The decline in smoking rate
— 13 percent — is especially
impressive.
The decrease in the number
of heart risk factors can be
translated into an overall
decrease in the risk of coronary
heart disease and the risk of
death. Researchers calculated
the percentage reduction to be
16 and 15 respectively in the
two treatment cities.
Reseachers estimated that
during the five years, each adult
in the treatment cities was ex
posed to the health messages
for an average of 26 hours. Far
quhar noted that the program
was delivered at an annual cost
of $4 per person — only about
4 percent of the annual per
capita expenditure for cigarettes
in the country.
This study may pave the road
to cost-effective community

wide prevention efforts. "Local
informational efforts can effect
positive behavioral change," said
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan, whose agency
funded the project.
James Mason, assistant sec
retary for health, said wide
spread application of these
methods could have an enor
mous impact on public health.
Malaria vaccine in sight
Another ongoing research
project is the effort of Immunol
ogy Prof. Leon Rosenberg to
develop a vaccine against
malaria.
The vaccine, however, is not
intended to protect humans.
People innoculated will carry an
antigen that will kill mosquitoes
that bite them.
Rosenberg got this idea from
a series of studies on cattle and
parasitic ticks. Researchers
found that injecting cattle with
crushed ticks causes them to
develop antibodies that interfere
with the digestive processes of
the ticks, which in turn cause
the ticks to eventually drop off.
Rosenberg is currently apply
ing this concept to fleas and
mice. If injecting mice with
crushed fleas causes the fleas to
die, Rosenberg will be ready to
move on to the problem of
mosquitoes and malaria.
Rosenberg envisions that the
greatest difficulty with the vac
cine will be to convince people
to be ii\jected with something
that will not help them. "None
of this is going to pass until the
world becomes much more so
cially conscious than it is now,"
he said.
Rosenberg's research is
funded by Stanford's Office of
Technology and Licensing.
