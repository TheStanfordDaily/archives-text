# University issues layoff notices to 48 employees

The long-awaited layoffs are now a
reality for the eight members of the
maintenance crew at Tresidder Memorial
Union who received formal notice July
10 that their jobs will be eliminated as
of Sept. 1.
As part of a campus-wide budget
repositioning process aimed to reduce the
University's operating budget by $22 mil
lion, at least 48 layoff notices have been
issued to Stanford employees.
The Tresidder custodians have been
speculating on the status of their jobs
since the beginning of June. Tresidder
management has announced it will con
tract out the custodians' work to an out
side company in the fall, but the United
Stanford Workers, which represents the
eight workers, did not receive formal
notice until last week.
According to the 1988 contract between
Stanford and the USW, the University
is supposed to notify workers of layoffs
resulting from contracting out 120 days
before they take effect. Linda Crouse,
former chief steward of the USW and
one of the laid-off workers, said the union
has filed a grievance with the National
Labor Relations Board because the Uni
versity failed to meet this deadline.
Crouse said the union has filed a sec
ond grievance with the board because
the workers do not have sufficient time
to make career decisions which may
"influence the rest of their lives." The
workers are eligible to "bump," or dis
place, more recently hired Stanford
workers, but cannot do so if they do not
know what the outside contractor may
offer, she said.
Crouse said the crew has until Friday
to exercise their bumping eligibility. The
decision will have to be made without
knowledge of which outside company will

be offering jobs, what the pay may be,
possible benefits and other important in
formation, she said.
"[The management] is really playing
games. People are supposed to have a
choice," Crouse remarked.
The current contract reads, "After the
University determines the job to be filled
and advises the worker eligible to bump,
the worker shall have 10 calendar days
to accept the opportunity to bump after
which the worker shall be deemed to
have declined to bump."
Emery Teranishi, acting manager of
employee relations, said workers can
decide to bump and later change their
mind. "We won't force anybody to take
the job," he said, adding that the bum
ping right is guaranteed by the current
contract.
Tresidder Service Manager Jeanette
Smith-Laws said the winning bid for the
outside contractor will probably be
decided by the end of the week, and the
staff will be the first to be notified.
She said it is not necessary to know
which company is getting the bid to make
the bumping decision. If rehired, the
workers will be getting existing wages
and benefits, she said.
The 1988 contract stipulates that if
workers are laid off because of contract
ing out, "the University will provide by
contract that the contractor is obligated
to offer employment at substantially
equivalent wages" to the laid-off workers.
Crouse said there is a "lack of
morality" on Tresidder's part in not in
forming the workers who the new con
tractor is. "Tresidder is already trying
to do the contractor a favor. Because
people will be forced to bump, the con
tractor can hire fewer workers," she
added.
Crouse said in a few weeks the USW
