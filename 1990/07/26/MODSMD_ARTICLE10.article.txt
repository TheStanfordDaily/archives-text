# In the Bear's Lair: Is Stanford cheaper than Cal?
## 
### Tarrant Mahony Staff writer 
It was a cold and foggy morn
ing when the phone rang. "Let
modern technology earn its
keep," I thought to myself as I
heard my answering machine
start its familiar litany. "See
what the world has to say for
itself."
"This is your editor," droned
the voice on the other end, not
preparing me in the least for
the bombshell that was to come.
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it, is to go to
Berkeley, enter the Bear's Lair,
and find out how much it all
costs ..."
Stunned, I lay on my bed,
oblivious to what followed. Had
the tape not self-destructed with
a loud popping noise, I might
still be there. "This is no ordi
nary assignment," I mused, as
I swung my legs to the floor
and began the shower ritual that
signalled the start of a day that
would be like no other.
Years earlier, when I was still
young and impressionable, my
Uncle Lewis, a Cal alum, had
given me a blue and gold
windbreaker, which hung in my
closet for ages. At the time I
could not fathom why anyone
would wear such colors, yet I
had always had a strange fas
cination for the jacket, as if it
possessed the key to my destiny.
"So that's it," I realized with
a start. "It will be my cloak of
cover on this mission of untold
dangers and unknown dimen
sions."
As I rode the train north, I
did some basic research about
the land of legend I was about
to enter. "Facts not rumors," I
reminded myself, "are the es
sential thing."
The University of California
was created in 1868 and, five
years later, opened its doors in

Berkeley to the first 191 stu
dents. In keeping with the prin
ciple of saving the best for last,
Stanford was founded in 1885
and held its first classes in 1891.
Cal's library system is the sec
ond largest university library in
the country, with about 6.1 mil
lion volumes. The Farm, in
keeping with the principle "good
things come in small packages,"
has but 5.7 tomes.
As far as tuition is concerned,
however, it is well-known that
"bigger is better." Cal students
get to pay but $1,682 per year
($7,481 for out-of-staters),
whereas Stanford students have
the privilege of forking over the
impressive sum of $14,280 per
year.
Armed with this information,
I arrived at the Berkeley campus
and immediately spied Sather
Tower. For only a quarter, a
visitor can ride in its elevator.
Stanford's Hoover Tower
charges a buck, except for those
with current student IDs who
get to go to the top without
paying a cent.
From the top of "Sa Tow,"
one can see the 178 acres of the
central lair, surrounded by a
total of 1,282 acres of bear
infested woods. The Farm, on
the other hand, has over 8,000
acres on which students can
roam without fear of furry four
legged creatures.
Since the heart of any great
university is its bookstore, I
made that the next stop on my
mission. Upon entrance to the
Bear's Lair Bookstore, one is im
mediately confronted by "The
Book of the Dead: Celebrating
25 Years of the Grateful Dead,"
for $15.95. The Stanford Book
store shows its visitors "The
Stanford Album: A Photo
graphic History, 1885-1945," for
$45.
The sign of intellectual and
spiritual awareness, of course,

is the number of works by C.
G. Jung that a store carries.
Berkeley did well with 13 titles,
but Stanford did even better
with 51.
In the more mundane areas,
Berkeley offers a "Graduat'n
Bear Class of 1990" T-shirt for
$10.25, while Stanford offers a
"Women's Basketball National
Championship 1990" shirt for
only 70 cents more.
It was at this point that I
came across a mystery of epic
proportions — both stores sell
bears! Berkeley, fortunately,
keeps them in a cage and a pur
chaser must first part with
$25.50 before one is released.
The Stanford Bookstore,
strangely enough, leaves their
bears uncaged and unattended
and will let you have one for
only $19.95.
I later found out from a Stan
ford Bookstore employee, Stan-

I #jjr ford sells bears because
they are cuter than stulT
ed trees," to which I replied,
"Impaled upon a claw they're
cuter than stuffed trees!"
All this excitement gave me
quite an appetite and I headed
off to find some food. The Bear's
Lair remembered to sell a whole
range of Pepperidge Farm
cookies and goldfish. "Bor
deaux" go for $1.79 there, but
I later learned that at Tresidder
Express (formerly The Store),
Stanford students only have to
pay $1.69 for the same. "That
evens out the difference in tui
tion," I thought, while munch
ing away.
One cannot, of course, eat
cookies without coffee, and so
the following advice is for all
the caffeine fiends out there: Go
to the Coffee Spot in Berkeley
for your small fixes, 65 cents as
opposed to 69; but come to the

Coffee House if you need a large
mega-dose, 84 cents to their 95.
I saved the most dangerous
part of my prowling for last, a
visit to that spot famous in
Berkeley history, the dreaded
Sproul Plaza. Stanford also has
a plaza, the great expanse of
blacktop known as White Plaza,
yet all comparison begins and
ends with the name.
For its fans, Sproul is
"unique" and has "culture."
Critics say it is "weird" and has
"weirdos." Let's just call it a
"nice place to visit," and leave
it at that.
Tired from the nerve-racking
day, and possessing much irrel
evant and irreverent informa
tion, I boarded the train for the
ride back to civilization and pon
dered what I would get for good
old Uncle Lewis' upcoming 70th
birthday. A bear, of course!

pay $1.69 for the same. "That
evens out the difference in tui
tion," I thought, while munch
ing away.
One cannot, of course, eat
cookies without coffee, and so
the following advice is for all
the caffeine fiends out there: Go
to the Coffee Spot in Berkeley
for your small fixes, 65 cents as
opposed to 69; but come to the

Coffee House if you need a large
mega-dose, 84 cents to their 95.
I saved the most dangerous
part of my prowling for last, a
visit to that spot famous in
Berkeley history, the dreaded
Sproul Plaza. Stanford also has
a plaza, the great expanse of
blacktop known as White Plaza,
yet all comparison begins and
ends with the name.
For its fans, Sproul is
"unique" and has "culture."
Critics say it is "weird" and has
"weirdos." Let's just call it a
"nice place to visit," and leave
it at that.
Tired from the nerve-racking
day, and possessing much irrel
evant and irreverent informa
tion, I boarded the train for the
ride back to civilization and pon
dered what I would get for good
old Uncle Lewis' upcoming 70th
birthday. A bear, of course!
From the Stanford Bookstore.

It was a cold and foggy morn
ing when the phone rang. "Let
modern technology earn its
keep," I thought to myself as I
heard my answering machine
start its familiar litany. "See
what the world has to say for
itself."
"This is your editor," droned
the voice on the other end, not
preparing me in the least for
the bombshell that was to come.
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it, is to go to
Berkeley, enter the Bear's Lair,
and find out how much it all
costs ..."
Stunned, I lay on my bed,
oblivious to what followed. Had
the tape not self-destructed with
a loud popping noise, I might
still be there. "This is no ordi
nary assignment," I mused, as
I swung my legs to the floor
and began the shower ritual that
signalled the start of a day that
would be like no other.
Years earlier, when I was still
young and impressionable, my
Uncle Lewis, a Cal alum, had
given me a blue and gold
windbreaker, which hung in my
closet for ages. At the time I
could not fathom why anyone
would wear such colors, yet I
had always had a strange fas
cination for the jacket, as if it
possessed the key to my destiny.
"So that's it," I realized with
a start. "It will be my cloak of
cover on this mission of untold
dangers and unknown dimen
sions."
As I rode the train north, I
did some basic research about
the land of legend I was about
to enter. "Facts not rumors," I
reminded myself, "are the es
sential thing."
The University of California
was created in 1868 and, five
years later, opened its doors in

Berkeley to the first 191 stu
dents. In keeping with the prin
ciple of saving the best for last,
Stanford was founded in 1885
and held its first classes in 1891.
Cal's library system is the sec
ond largest university library in
the country, with about 6.1 mil
lion volumes. The Farm, in
keeping with the principle "good
things come in small packages,"
has but 5.7 tomes.
As far as tuition is concerned,
however, it is well-known that
"bigger is better." Cal students
get to pay but $1,682 per year
($7,481 for out-of-staters),
whereas Stanford students have
the privilege of forking over the
impressive sum of $14,280 per
year.
Armed with this information,
I arrived at the Berkeley campus
and immediately spied Sather
Tower. For only a quarter, a
visitor can ride in its elevator.
Stanford's Hoover Tower
charges a buck, except for those
with current student IDs who
get to go to the top without
paying a cent.
From the top of "Sa Tow,"
one can see the 178 acres of the
central lair, surrounded by a
total of 1,282 acres of bear
infested woods. The Farm, on
the other hand, has over 8,000
acres on which students can
roam without fear of furry four
legged creatures.
Since the heart of any great
university is its bookstore, I
made that the next stop on my
mission. Upon entrance to the
Bear's Lair Bookstore, one is im
mediately confronted by "The
Book of the Dead: Celebrating
25 Years of the Grateful Dead,"
for $15.95. The Stanford Book
store shows its visitors "The
Stanford Album: A Photo
graphic History, 1885-1945," for
$45.
The sign of intellectual and
spiritual awareness, of course,

is the number of works by C.
G. Jung that a store carries.
Berkeley did well with 13 titles,
but Stanford did even better
with 51.
In the more mundane areas,
Berkeley offers a "Graduat'n
Bear Class of 1990" T-shirt for
$10.25, while Stanford offers a
"Women's Basketball National
Championship 1990" shirt for
only 70 cents more.
It was at this point that I
came across a mystery of epic
proportions — both stores sell
bears! Berkeley, fortunately,
keeps them in a cage and a pur
chaser must first part with
$25.50 before one is released.
The Stanford Bookstore,
strangely enough, leaves their
bears uncaged and unattended
and will let you have one for
only $19.95.
I later found out from a Stan
ford Bookstore employee, Stan-

I #jjr ford sells bears because
they are cuter than stulT
ed trees," to which I replied,
"Impaled upon a claw they're
cuter than stuffed trees!"
All this excitement gave me
quite an appetite and I headed
off to find some food. The Bear's
Lair remembered to sell a whole
range of Pepperidge Farm
cookies and goldfish. "Bor
deaux" go for $1.79 there, but
I later learned that at Tresidder
Express (formerly The Store),
Stanford students only have to
pay $1.69 for the same. "That
evens out the difference in tui
tion," I thought, while munch
ing away.
