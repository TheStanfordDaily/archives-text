# Stanford wins $393,000 in court
## 
### Wendy Witt 
A year ago, when a wealthy
widow left her entire estate to
Stanford as a scholarship fund
for needy students, the Univer
sity also inherited a legal battle
that just ended Friday, when a
New Mexico jury awarded Stan
ford $393,000.
Julia Peterson, 89, was a
widow who lived alone in Las
Cruces, New Mexico. She told
friends that she was the only
daughter of an Austrian army
officer and that her husband,
Del Peterson, an El Paso
rancher, died 40 years ago.
She also told friends she
wanted to leave her money to
Stanford University, where she
said she had earned her degree
in music, according to the El
Paso Herald Post.
However, the Stanford
Alumni Directory does not list
her as an alumna, and the Music
Department said its records do
not go back that far.

In the 1970s Peterson met
Carleen Bach, a claims represen
tative with the Social Security
Administration, and her hus
band Leland Bach, a naval vet
eran.
In February 1988, Peterson
suffered a stroke that left her
unable to speak or write and
incapable of caring for herself.
The Bachs filed a civil lawsuit
seeking legal guardianship over
Peterson. However, pending the
judge's decision, the court ap
pointed an attorney, Manuel
Lopez, as conservator of Peter
son's estate.
Lopez discovered that large
amounts of money had been
transferred from Peterson's ac
count to a joint account with
Carleen Bach.
Between Feb. 4, 1986 and
Nov. 18, 1988, Carleen Bach
withdrew nearly $162,000 from
the account.
Lopez filed a lawsuit seeking
an accounting of Peterson's as
sets and a restraining order pre

venting the Bachs from using
Peterson's money as their own.
The suit contended that the
Bachs used the money to pur
chase a new home, a car, mu
nicipal bonds and improvements
on their former home, which
they sold for $88,000.
Bach said he and his wife, "are
not criminals by any stretch of
the imagination. We were just
trying to help people. Julia put
my wife on a joint account," ac
cording to the El Paso Herald
Post.
After Peterson's death in July
1989, Stanford, as her sole ben
eficiary, inherited the lawsuit
Lopez filed on Peterson's behalf.
Last Friday the jury awarded
Stanford $193,094 in compen
satory damages and $200,000 in
punitive damages, according to
Robert Fourr, the attorney who
supervised the case for Stanford.
Fourr said he was uncertain
whether Stanford would be able
to collect from the Bachs. The
Bachs could appeal the decision.
