THE KEY to political
success is obscurity.
Don't make waves. Be
smart. Don't draw attention
to yourself. And, most impor
tantly, don't leave a paper
trail.
That way when people ask
you something you can tell
them what they want to hear
and they can't look back
through your past and find
anything that makes you look
like a liar.
It doesn't matter whether
you really are a liar. You just
can't let anyone make you
look like one.
Now, if this is true, suc
cessful politicians are people
without charisma or strong
convictions, and the weak
values they hold dear have
been the same throughout
their entire lives. They never
change their minds, grow or
expand their viewpoints.
These sound like qualities
that a Raggedy-Ann doll
would stress in a cover letter,
but it seems to work.
Hold on a minute. Perhaps
the media establishment is
giving itself too much credit.
Perhaps George Bush does
not really care what people
dig up about David Souter.
Perhaps Bush just picked the
person who he thought would
be best for the job and the
question of a paper trail never
entered into the decision
making process.
But, more likely, Bush was
pulling another Quayle. Bush
was trying to throw people
off-guard and stay in control
of the situation. He was
making sure that the press
did not have the opportunity
to pick a nominee for him.
Unfortunately for Bush,
Vice President Dan Quayle
was not the obscure Godsend
that he seemed to be. Though
few people think he is the
best person for the job,
Quayle was a smart political

choice. He deflected a lot of
criticism away from Bush.
Whether Souter is con
firmed by the Senate
Judiciary Committee remains
to be seen, but the sneaky
power play is history. If Bush
wants someone on the Court
who will overturn Roe v.
Wade, as many suspect, then
he should come clean. By
picking someone who has not
had to decide cases that relate
to some of the more crucial
issues facing the nation, Bush
is trying to sneak in the back
door.
If Bush's nominee were a
more vocal and outspoken
person, the Senate Judiciary
Committee hearings that
sunk Robert Bork might have
been more difficult than they
promise to be for Souter, but
at least people would have
known what they were going
to get and would have had
an opportunity to do some
thing about it.
If Souter joins the Court
without too much opposition
because his views cannot be
pinned down, it will be too
late.
Brennan's departure itself
is a frightening sign that the
Court's backslide on key in
dividual rights issues will ac
celerate. But Bush's
nomination of a "safe" indi
vidual for Brennan's spot only
underscores the fact that the
winds of change are blowing.
If Souter does join the
court and Roe v. Wade is over
turned, Bush will probably
wash his hands of the matter
and pass the buck, claiming
that he was unsure of
Souter's position on abortion
to pro-choicers and, behind
his back, whispering to pro
lifers that he knew Souter
would get the job done all
along. Like Quayle, Souter
could be a perfect political
foil.
