Boys' behavior
raises concerns
Earlier this summer at the
post office I heard a group of
teenage boys harassing a wom
an. I was shocked and surprised,
but I did nothing.
Having thought about it
more, I would like to take this
opportunity to tell Stanford
summer visitors that Stanford
is a small community in which
we usually watch out for each
other. There are troubles
enough in the outside world; we
try not to add to them.
Stanford is a great place to
try new ways of doing things
and to test our strength of char
acter. For men, how much
strength does it take to find a
new way of relating to women?
For men and women, how
much strength does it take to
confront a group of people who
are doing something you know
is wrong?
I heard several of the young
men say they were ashamed to
be seen with this group. Are you
strong enough to leave this

group? Can you confront the
leaders?
And to the leaders of the
group, how creative are you?
Can you think of a different way
to relate to women?
And my challenge to myself:
Am I brave enough to stand up
for my beliefs? Next time, will
I stand up for this woman, (and
my community), rather than
pretend she doesn't exist?
I hope all members of the
Stanford community will join
me in asking these questions.

Letter's author
misidentified
In an essay I wrote that ap
peared in last week's Stanford
Weekly, ("Pro-choice paper ex
emplifies media censorship") my
opinions were incorrectly asso
ciated with those of the Hoover
Institution.
While it is true that I hold a
student-level summer position
at the Institution, the sugges
tion that my essay had anything

to do with my workplace is er
roneous.
It should be noted that my
being identified as an employee
of the Hoover Institution Public
Affairs department came about
entirely under The Weekly's voli
tion, not mine. I identified
myself to The Weekly only as a
student at St. Mary's University
who is working on the Stanford
campus this summer.

Kennedy stance
on drugs unfair
I was pleased to read that Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy thinks the question to ask
about Assoc. Dean Diana Con
klin is whether her alleged drug
use "would impair her effective
ness in her job."
Of course, when Kennedy and
Conklin forced every pledge of
every Stanford fraternity to sign
a promise not to use drugs, I
don't recall anybody asking
whether students' alleged drug
use impaired their performance

in a classroom.
