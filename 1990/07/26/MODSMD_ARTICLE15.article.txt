## 'I'm sorry' isn't good enough 
### 
Have you ever said "I'm sor
ry"? Of course you have. No
other phrase passes across our
lips more than "I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry" comes in many
forms, from the short and to
the point "sorry," to the guilt
ridden hyperbole of "I'm very
very sorry" or "I'm truly sorry,"
to the more formal, and usually
insincere, "I apologize."
From the time we are children
until our dying days, we are
taught the power of "I'm sorry."
"Sorry" is the do-all, cure-all,
say-all and, for the more pa
thetic folks, be-all of mankind.
We can't go through one day
of our lives without hearing
"I'm sorry" in one form or an
other. From tired Hallmark
sayings: "Love means never
having to say I'm sorry."
From impersonal computer
ized operators: "I'm sorry your
call cannot be completed as
dialed." From friends you hardly
ever hear from: "I'm sorry I

can't come to the phone right
now."
And from jive fellas always
ready with an excuse: "Aww
baby, I'm sorry." Patsy Kline
was the only one who said it
with sincerity.
"And now we have two more
"I'm sorry's" to add to our list.
From Senator David Duren
berger (R-MN) following the
Senate's recommendation that
he be reprimanded for breaking
Senate rules on personal finan
cial gain: "Of all the the thou
sands of words that have been
written or spoken during 23
months of investigation, news
coverage and commentary, only
three are appropriate today: I
am sorry."
And from our very own Stan
ford University (who is always
formal and often insincere), in
a letter alerting 48 staff mem
bers of their layoffs: "As you
are aware, the total number of
staff positions at Stanford will

be reduced as a result of the
budget cutting and reposition
ing efforts."
"Your position has been af
fected by this effort and this
letter is to inform you of your
layoff. I regret that this action
has become necessary. We have
all benefitted from your service.
I wish you every success in your
future career." In other words,
"I'm 8-o-o-r-r-y-y."
"Sorry" has to be the only
word that can both describe and
explain (?) the actions of a lying,
money-stealing, no-count
politician and a mismanaged,
centennial-celebrating, self
indulging, lawn-sprinkling
university.
With Senator Durenberger
and Stanford University joining
the list of "sorries," it leaves a
lot of folks wondering: "Who's
sorry now?"
