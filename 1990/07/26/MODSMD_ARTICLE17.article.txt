## Photography exhibits show life in black and white 
### Lisa Nellor Editorial staff 
Even in today's world of split-second
video images, the traditional black-and
white photograph grabs our attention.
Elegant in its simplicity, the photograph
continues to wield the power of commu
nicating the vision of the artist behind
the lens to the btMolder.
Probably the most accessible art form,
photography can be enjoyed by almost
everyone. Three San Francisco photo
graphic exhibitions make it easy to enjoy
photography — even if your camera vo
cabulary is limited to the phrase "point
and shoot."
The exhibitions include "Like a One-
Eyed Cat: Photographs by Lee
Friedlander 1957-1988," "Yosemite: A
Lifetime, Seven Decades of Photographs
by Ansel Adams" and "Curator's Choice,"
a compilation exhibit of photographs
from three artists, including Stanford
University senior photography lecturer
Joel Leivick.
All three exhibitions can be found in
the newly-opened Ansel Adams Center
located at 250 Fourth Street in San Fran
cisco.
Friedlander is one of the most signif
icant American photographers of the past
three decades. Known for his surprising
way of seeing the commonplace on the
street, he has been making pictures of
the world around him nearly every day
for 30 years.
Friedlander's subject matter varies,
but his style is consistent. In 1963
Friedlander described his focus as "the
American social landscape and its con
ditions," a theme to which he brings wit
and style.
His current retrospective exhibition,
"Like a One-Eyed Cat," is named for his
sneaky practice of photographing un
suspecting people in mirrors and reflec
tions. It includes 150 photographs
organized by the Seattle Art Museum.
Friedlander's humorous style emerges
in his recent series called "Workers from
M.1.T," which points an unsympathetic
eye at the modern professional's rela
tionship with the computer screen.
His award-winning 1960s work is also
represented, including unnerving looks
through the eye of his camera at the
assassination of President Kennedy and
Southern racial tensions.
This exhibit is open until September
30.
"Curator's Choice" features works of
three Northern California photogra
phers, including Stanford's Leivick.
A popular instructor of the history
and practice of photography, as well as
the curator of photography at the Stan
ford Museum of Art, Leivick has just
returned to the Bay Area from Italy,
where he spent several months
photographing marble quarries.
This series of photographs demon
strates Leivick's strength as a landscape
photographer. Leivick wrote that his
portfolio focused on "the structure of
natural things and on the effects of
civilization — subtle and salutary or
gross and unreasonable — on the natural
scheme."

Leivick's photographs often look down
from above, animating his careful com
positions and eliciting emotional re
sponses to the landscapes. His most
compelling photographs of this series
capture the quiet elegance of the Italian
Alps, which are covered with a marble
like powder that appears to be a paper
thin layer of snow.
"I found myself stunned by the spec
tacle," wrote Leivick. In the presence of
these monumental landscapes, the viewer
cannot help but feel much the same.
In addition to this recent look at the
Italian landscape scarred by centuries of
human contact, the current exhibition
features work of Leivick's that spans a
period of ten years and includes
landscapes of nature, and of the urban
environment in California and Connecti
cut.
Leivick's work will also appear at the
Stanford Art Gallery this spring.
Other artists featured in the
"Curator's Choice" exhibition include
video and performance artist Matias
Jaramillo and photojournalist Lou
Dematteis.
Jaramillo's work includes six life-size
photographs of himself dressed as ar
chetypal figures. Though generally a per
formance artist, his "Still Performance,"
as the collection is titled, engages the
viewer as a participant.
The solitary standing figures of the
artist surround the walls and confront
the viewer, drawing attention to the
tenuous relationship between the photo
graph and the full human body by the
unexpected combination of the two.
The work of Palo Alto native Dematteis
illustrates an additional approach to pho
tography, as his photojournalistic photo
graphs chronicle the five years he has
spent exploring the political and social
upheaval in Nicaragua.
Dematteis' powerful photographs have
been seen on the front pages of The New
York Times, Time and Newsweek, and
his current exhibition further demon
strates his ability to capture in one frame
the emotional and psychological turmoil
of the human condition.
Together, the three artists in
"Curator's Choice" represent three very
different photographic styles that can be
achieved by an artist and a camera. Their
work will be on exhibit until Aug. 26.
A third exhibition, "Yosemite: A
Lifetime, Seven Decades of Photographs
by Ansel Adams," features the work of
this well-known artist. Presented in
celebration of the 100 th anniversary of
Yosemite National Park, this exhibit
highlights Adams' long photographic in
volvement with Yosemite.
It includes both his popular and lesser
known images, such as his last Yosemite
photographs from the spring of 1983.
These photographs capture Adams' dra
matic vision of the beauty of the wilder
ness, as well as his incredible talent.
This exhibition is open until October
14.

tography, as his photojournalistic photo
graphs chronicle the five years he has
spent exploring the political and social
upheaval in Nicaragua.
Dematteis' powerful photographs have
been seen on the front pages of The New
York Times, Time and Newsweek, and
his current exhibition further demon
strates his ability to capture in one frame
the emotional and psychological turmoil
of the human condition.
Together, the three artists in
"Curator's Choice" represent three very
different photographic styles that can be
achieved by an artist and a camera. Their
work will be on exhibit until Aug. 26.
A third exhibition, "Yosemite: A
Lifetime, Seven Decades of Photographs
by Ansel Adams," features the work of
this well-known artist. Presented in
celebration of the 100 th anniversary of
Yosemite National Park, this exhibit
highlights Adams' long photographic in
volvement with Yosemite.
It includes both his popular and lesser
known images, such as his last Yosemite
photographs from the spring of 1983.
These photographs capture Adams' dra
matic vision of the beauty of the wilder
ness, as well as his incredible talent.
This exhibition is open until October
14.

Even in today's world of split-second
video images, the traditional black-and
white photograph grabs our attention.
Elegant in its simplicity, the photograph
continues to wield the power of commu
nicating the vision of the artist behind
the lens to the btMolder.
Probably the most accessible art form,
photography can be enjoyed by almost
everyone. Three San Francisco photo
graphic exhibitions make it easy to enjoy
photography — even if your camera vo
cabulary is limited to the phrase "point
and shoot."
The exhibitions include "Like a One-
Eyed Cat: Photographs by Lee
Friedlander 1957-1988," "Yosemite: A
Lifetime, Seven Decades of Photographs
by Ansel Adams" and "Curator's Choice,"
a compilation exhibit of photographs
from three artists, including Stanford
University senior photography lecturer
Joel Leivick.
All three exhibitions can be found in
the newly-opened Ansel Adams Center
located at 250 Fourth Street in San Fran
cisco.
Friedlander is one of the most signif
icant American photographers of the past
three decades. Known for his surprising
way of seeing the commonplace on the
street, he has been making pictures of
the world around him nearly every day
for 30 years.
Friedlander's subject matter varies,
but his style is consistent. In 1963
Friedlander described his focus as "the
American social landscape and its con
ditions," a theme to which he brings wit
and style.
His current retrospective exhibition,
"Like a One-Eyed Cat," is named for his
sneaky practice of photographing un
suspecting people in mirrors and reflec
tions. It includes 150 photographs
organized by the Seattle Art Museum.
Friedlander's humorous style emerges
in his recent series called "Workers from
M.1.T," which points an unsympathetic
eye at the modern professional's rela
tionship with the computer screen.
His award-winning 1960s work is also
represented, including unnerving looks
through the eye of his camera at the
assassination of President Kennedy and
Southern racial tensions.
This exhibit is open until September
30.
"Curator's Choice" features works of
three Northern California photogra
phers, including Stanford's Leivick.
A popular instructor of the history
and practice of photography, as well as
the curator of photography at the Stan
ford Museum of Art, Leivick has just
returned to the Bay Area from Italy,
where he spent several months
photographing marble quarries.
This series of photographs demon
strates Leivick's strength as a landscape
photographer. Leivick wrote that his
portfolio focused on "the structure of
natural things and on the effects of
civilization — subtle and salutary or
gross and unreasonable — on the natural
scheme."

Leivick's photographs often look down
from above, animating his careful com
positions and eliciting emotional re
sponses to the landscapes. His most
compelling photographs of this series
capture the quiet elegance of the Italian
Alps, which are covered with a marble
like powder that appears to be a paper
thin layer of snow.
"I found myself stunned by the spec
tacle," wrote Leivick. In the presence of
these monumental landscapes, the viewer
cannot help but feel much the same.
In addition to this recent look at the
Italian landscape scarred by centuries of
human contact, the current exhibition
features work of Leivick's that spans a
period of ten years and includes
landscapes of nature, and of the urban
environment in California and Connecti
cut.
Leivick's work will also appear at the
Stanford Art Gallery this spring.
Other artists featured in the
"Curator's Choice" exhibition include
video and performance artist Matias
Jaramillo and photojournalist Lou
Dematteis.
Jaramillo's work includes six life-size
photographs of himself dressed as ar
chetypal figures. Though generally a per
formance artist, his "Still Performance,"
as the collection is titled, engages the
viewer as a participant.
The solitary standing figures of the
artist surround the walls and confront
the viewer, drawing attention to the
tenuous relationship between the photo
graph and the full human body by the
unexpected combination of the two.
The work of Palo Alto native Dematteis
illustrates an additional approach to pho
tography, as his photojournalistic photo
graphs chronicle the five years he has
spent exploring the political and social
upheaval in Nicaragua.
Dematteis' powerful photographs have
been seen on the front pages of The New
York Times, Time and Newsweek, and
his current exhibition further demon

the emotional and psychological turmoil
