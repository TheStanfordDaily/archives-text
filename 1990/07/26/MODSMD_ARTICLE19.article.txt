# Keillor's 'Sweet Corn Show' is sweet, not corny
## 
### Doug Davis Staff writer 
Few people can enthrall an
audience with the gustatory
details of savoring sweet corn;
but then, few people are Gar
rison Keillor.
Not only fresh sweet corn, but
also lots of down-home humor
and foot-tapping music were on
the menu for last Friday's
"Sweet Corn Show" at the Con
cord Pavilion. Garrison Keillor,
storyteller, author and long
time host of his "A Prairie Home
Companion" radio show, united
with guitar virtuoso Chet Atkins
for an evening of hominy and
harmony.
For fans of "A Prairie Home
Companion," or Keillor's new
show, "The American Radio
Company of the Air," "Sweet
Corn Show" was a real feast,
for it was much in the tradition
of Keillor's popular perform
ances, replete with bogus com
mercials, poetry, traditional
American music and "News
from Lake Wobegone." Inter
spersed with the new material
were some of the best songs and
bits from previous broadcasts.
The show was sponsored, as
Keillor reminded us, by Powder
milk Biscuits, ("they give shy
persons the strength to get up
and do what needs to be done"),
and by Bertha's Kitty Boutique,
("for all your cat needs").
The show opened simply, with
Keillor unpretentiously strolling
out to center-stage for a per
sonal, take-your-time, Midwes
tern greeting. He was soon
joined by three of his old Prairie

Home Companion friends, Kate
MacKenzie and Robin and Linda
Williams, for a short set as the
"Hopeful Gospel Quartet,"
whose enthusiasm and tight
harmonies set the stage for what
was yet to come.
Robin and Linda Williams also
offered up some duets with the
"high lonesome sound" of their
home state of Virginia and later
in the show returned as the
garishly dressed Marvin and
Mavis Smiley, plugging their
newly-released eight track,
"Broadway Hits — Bluegrass
Style." This hilarious "commer
cial" was complete with stirring
anthems like "You'll never walk
alone" done to the hard-driving
rhythm of "Rocky Top."
Keillor soon gave the stage
over to Chet Atkins, the
guitarist who makes all other
guitarists lean forward in their
seats. Atkins, along with his
four-piece back-up band, per
formed some of the tunes which
he has made his own, such as
his "Beatles Medley" (in which
he plays both bass and treble
parts of "Lady Madonna" simul
taneously — no mean feat) and
a dropped-C version of Don Mac-
Clean's "Vincent."
Not just a musician, Atkins
is a storyteller in his own right,
breaking up the audience with
stories of his father and how, if
it weren't for the guitar, he
would be "out walking the street
... as a lawyer or doctor."
Keillor continued to mix it up
with the audience throughout
the evening, occasionally leaving
the stage altogether to a musical

guest, sometimes launching
spontaneously into poetry (like
"Men with Low Blood-Pressure
Die Every Day"), and other
times sliding into song ("Cat,
Come Back!").
All of Keillor's musings and
music were trademarked with
that homespun humor and
whimsy that so many listeners

have grown to expect and ap
preciate. An evening with Keil
lor and Atkins is like an evening
with old friends (albeit very
talented ones), who charm and
disarm with stories of a town
that time forgot, and music of
a tradition that shouldn't be for
gotten.
No laser show, no fog ma

chines. Just good times.
Abraham Lincoln once
reviewed a book by saying, "this
is the sort of thing you'll like,
if you like that sore of thing."
Judging by the response of the
large and appreciative audience
at the "Sweet Corn Show," there
are still many folks who "like
that sort of thing."
