# 'Jetsons' is a disappointment
## 
### Sunil Perkash Staff writer 
With such violent summer releases as "Robocop
2," "Die Hard 2" and "Total Recall," you would
think that the arrival of "Jetsons: The Movie"
would be a welcome change for children of all ages.
Unfortunately, this is not so.
What made "The Jetsons" so much fun as a
television series was the show's humorous ap
proach to living in a futuristic society. The satire
and witty dialogue were entertaining for the entire
family, and the silly escapades of Elroy and his
dog Astro provided added humor for younger
audiences.
While the film does contain some insightful
dialogue about the 21st century, it tends to bypass
clever situations characteristic of the series in
an attempt to capture the viewers' emotions.
When the story begins, George Jetson's com
pany, Spacely Sprockets, is experiencing financial
difficulties.
To increase revenues, the company's president
and chief executive — good old Mr. Spacely —
has built a new factory on a faraway asteroid
which utilizes minimal labor for production. How
ever, the past four vice presidents of the new
plant have all quit for mysterious reasons.
Spacely decides to appoint the "expendable"
George as his new vice president. George wel
comes the promotion and makes his family move
to the asteroid. Once there, the whole family
must adjust to a new environment, while George
figures out who is trying to sabotage Spacely's
plant.
In order not to reveal too much more of this

fairly unoriginal plot, I will say only that the
adventures that "take off' in the Jetsons' new
home hardly take off at all.
There is also a sub-plot about the love life of
Judy Jetson, played by pop singer Tiffany.
This is so contrived and underdeveloped that
it ends up being nothing more than boring. When
Judy sings endlessly as she strolls through a
shopping mall, I noticed that parents in the
theater used the opportunity to take their children
to the bathroom.
Since people are not going to see the "Jetsons"
for its plot, I wonder why the writers have tried
so hard to develop an intriguing and suspenseful
story.
As if the point of the story were not obvious
enough, George blatantly states it, followed by a
few direct words of wisdom, to the audience, at
the end of the film. Parents with children under
eight or nine might find this a good movie for
their kids to watch because it ultimately provides
an moral story.
But for older generations, especially those who
grew up with the Jetsons, or watch the reruns
today, this film will be nothing more than a
disappointment.
While an animated film such as "The Little
Mermaid" emerged as an instant classic, "The
Jetsons" is nothing more than a summer diver
sion parents can take their young children to see
without exposing them to gratuitous violence.
If you really want to see ninety minutes of
"The Jetsons," taping three episodes from the
television series would be much more enjoyable
than watching the movie.
