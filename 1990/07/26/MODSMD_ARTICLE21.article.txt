# 'Without You' really is nothing
## 
### Sarah Laurence Editorial staff 
A film that makes the audi
ence laugh while making a sober
statement about American soci
ety is rare indeed. "Without You
I'm Nothing," a movie co
written by and starring com
edienne Sandra Bernhard,
attempts to do both and
succeeds at doing neither.
"Without You" is a musical
mock-documentary that resem
bles the early-80s heavy-metal
"This Is Spinal Tap." However,
lacking the hilarity of its
predecessor, Bernhardt film
fills its slow two hours with
pretension instead.
What few laughs this film
does inspire are due entirely to
Bernhardt talent onstage. She
clearly enjoys wearing two-inch
fingernails, fake eyelashes,
ultra-pink lipstick and clothes
that could easily grace the cover
of Cosmopolitan.
Bernhard — who could be
conventionally beautiful if she
kept her large mouth shut in a
fashion-model pout instead of
using it as the driving force be
hind her formidable impersona
tions — is immediately
intriguing.
It is unfortunate that some
one with her tremendous poten
tial as an actress should be
bogged down by a dull screen
play, especially one that she
helped write.
Though Bernhard's represen
tations of women singers of dif
ferent ages, races and religions
are inspired, and at times shock
ingly realistic, the humor of
lyrics such as "My skin is black"
quickly wears out.
The movie manages to ward
off the yawns it justly deserves
only by keeping you so confused
that you're afraid to look away
from the screen for fear of miss
ing an awaited clarifying or
amusing detail.
Neither of the two ever comes.
Besides failing to create
humor, "Without You I'm Noth
ing" fails to articulate whatever
social statement it attempts to
literally scream at you during
the show. At the end of the
movie, you not only remain ig
norant of director John Bos
kovich's "Word," but you also
have been deafened by all the
yelling in your ear.
The film's coupling of a

sketchy, self-conscious screen
play with cinematography that
jumps from Bernhard's
nightclub act to mysterious
shots of an elegant black wom
an, whose identity is never dis
closed, ends up being frustrating
rather than enlightening.
Don't be surprised if you leave
this movie feeling cheated. But
don't be dismayed either: Free
Bernhardt buttons proclaiming
that you are "one of the initi
ated," and bookmarks crammed
with hype about the film will

make up materially what the
movie lacks in spiritual
gratification.
The title, presumably in
tended to condemn the past dec
ade's lack of substance, actually
denounces the film itself. With
out your blind faith that this
movie is saying something im
portant that you alone are miss
ing, and that it is delivering
terrific jokes that you alone
don't get, "Without You I'm
Nothing" is truly nothing.
