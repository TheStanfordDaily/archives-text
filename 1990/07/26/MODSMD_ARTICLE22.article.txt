In its West Coast premier last
Saturday at the Burgess
Theater in Menlo Park, South
African playwright Athol
Fugard's "My Children! My
Africa!" brought the audience to
its feet. Supported by strong act
ing and thoughtful direction un
der Clinton Turner Davis, this
nearly flawless production was
terrifically captivating.
Many of Fugard's plays have
been banned in his homeland,
because he writes realistically of
the South African blacks'
struggle for individuality.
"My Children! My Africa! is
no exception.
Writing naturally and without
gimmicks, Fugard manages to
create a chilling sense of danger.
Theatre Works newcomer Mi
chael Chinyamurindi is expres
sive and visceral in his portrayal
of Thami, the young student at
odds with his schoolteacher over
the best way to liberate South
African blacks.
Thami is a pupil of Mr. M, a
teacher who gives his all to his
students, yet whose old
fashioned methods of bringing
about change do not satisfy the
increasingly rebellious Thami.
Isabel is another student —
from a nearby white school —
who becomes acquainted with
Mr. M and his classroom. The
audience soon learns of Isabel's
limited contact with blacks: She
knows only the family maid and
one of her father's employees.
Though she has had a
secluded upbringing, Isabel
develops a deep friendship with
both men. The story is beauti
fully told by these three char
acters, and their relationships
with one another.
In her role as Isabel, Amy
Prosser consistently portrays a
white South African confused
and dismayed by social unrest.
Isabel wants to help the black
cause, but does not condone vi

olent methods.
Anthony Haney is moving as
Mr. M, the teacher faced with
loss and misunderstanding at
every turn.
Mr. M is a forceful and en
thusiastic man, strongly devoted
to teaching, who wants his stu
dents to overcome the class
struggle through education. His
love of knowledge is the only
thing that keeps his hope alive
in the face of violence in the
streets.
Thami is a promising pupil,
Mr. M's favorite. But as he
reaches adulthood, Thami is no
longer willing to accept slow
change while watching his
people suffer.
Thami doesn't believe that ed
ucation is the key to freedom.
Fed up with Mr. M's conserva
tive approach, he joins a sub
versive group and takes part in
a boycott of the school.
These alternate perspectives
on the class and race struggle
in South Africa provide a bal
ance to the play's explosive sub
ject matter. Rather than forcing
us to take sides on South

Africa's racial policies, Fugard
prompts us to understand the
part of human nature that
rebels against repression and
loss of individuality.
The characters in the play
have high aspirations and good
intentions, yet are trapped in a
situation beyond their control.
At first, violence and unrest stay
outside the classroom door, but
they inevitably disrupt Mr. M's
teachings.
And because he blocks out
this encroaching reality, Mr. M
loses influence over Thami.
While the initially close bond
between Thami and Mr. M
deteriorates, Thami and Isabel
struggle to hold on to their
friendship. Their peaceful lives
have been changed forever by
the time the play reaches its
powerful conclusion.
