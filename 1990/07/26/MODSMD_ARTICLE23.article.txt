# 'Arachnophobia' gives the creeps

If you are not already scared of spiders, you
will be after viewing "Arachnophobia." This film,
which opened last week, is probably the scariest
two hours of all of 1990.
The story begins in Venezuela, where a scien
tific expedition discovers a new breed of spiders
which possess a fatal poison.
A photographer gets bitten by one of these
spiders, and dies. However, no one suspects that
the spider caused his death.
When the dead body is placed in a wooden box
to be shipped to the United States, the spider
sneaks in — and becomes the most unwelcome
illegal alien ever to enter the country.
In the same California town to which the pho
tographer is being shipped, Dr. Ross Jennings
(Jeff Daniels) and his family have recently arrived,
hoping to exchange the pressure of San Francisco
for the peace and quiet of a small town.
As the family begins unpacking and setting up
house, the spider does likewise in their barn.
And that's when the fun and thrills begin.
Jennings' severe arachnophobia makes the sit
uation especially interesting.
The rest of movie consists of numerous scenes
in which the spider and its offspring prey upon
naive townspeople.
Other characters in the film include an idiotic
exterminator played by John Goodman, co-star
of the television show "Roseanne," and an over
zealous scientist played by Julian Sands of "A
Room With a View."
A necessary component of good scary movies
is the creation of a bond between the characters
and the audience. Without this bond, no one
really cares who lives and who dies.
"Arachnophobia" succeeds in giving you a sense
of personal attachment to Jennings and his family,
and is far more effective than most thrillers.
Given the meticulous direction of Frank Mar

shall and production by Steven Spielberg, all un
der the command of Hollywood Pictures (Disney),
it is no surprise that there is a certain air of
quality throughout the picture.
Because ads label this film a "thrill-omedy,"
unsuspecting viewers might not be prepared for
the degree of terror this film inspires. And, in
certain scenes — such as that of gooey egg sacks
pulsating prior to releasing thousands of baby
spiders — the film could even be classified as
grotesque.
"Arachnophobia" is a light-hearted thriller in
the same league as "Aliens" and "Jaws." With
the combination of fine acting, precise direction,
breathtaking cinematography and a well-written
screenplay, "Arachnophobia" is summer enter
tainment at its best.
