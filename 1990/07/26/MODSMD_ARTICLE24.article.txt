# 'Marshal Law' comic rules

### Sarah Laurence Editorial staff 
Look out, everyone. San Fran
cisco has been placed under
"Marshal Law," and the city as
we know it is now a thing of
the past.
"Marshal Law," a graphic
novel by Pat Mills and Kevin
O'Neill, concerns itself with a
theme many of us know too well
— the post-earthquake blues.
The year is 2020, and the Big
One has hit. Besides flattening
the city, the quake has set off
a tidal wave and caused a nu
clear power plant to melt down.
Good things, after all, come in
threes.
As if all of this weren't
enough, our ever-so-useful gov
ernment has been engaging in
genetic engineering and anti
pain research whose result is a
new breed of soldier.
These freaks of science — or
perhaps of politics — are as
varied as humanity itself. We
first meet Colonel Buck Caine
(a.k.a the Public Spirit), an over
built, undersexed, evangelistic
hero of the masses.
Then there's Sorry, the Nearly
Man, whose bright green cos
tume likens him to a grotesque
leprechaun.
Marshal Law, our protag
onist, is the only Super Hero
whose integrity equals his
physique. Leading the perfect
Clark Kent existence, Marshal
spends half his life roaming the
cadaver of San Francisco as a
one-man police force. The rest
of the time this formidable cop,
who wears bracelets of barbed

wire and a mask, is just "Joe
Gilmer, unemployed blue collar
worker living in the inner city."
Of course there's a Lois Lane
character. Her name is Lynn,
and she's bright, opinionated
and ignorant of Joe's alter ego.
"I met Lynn during the Big
One," Marshal/Joe says, "when
the wall between our apartments
fell down. We've been partying
ever since."

The plot of this witty, creative
comic is Marshal's pursuit of a
mysterious rapist and murderer.
The crime's intricate solution
ties up the story's loose ends.
Kevin O'Neill's art, high
lighted by effective, symbolic
coloring, completes Pat Mills'
inspired story.
Even for comic book non
readers, "Marshal Law" makes
a great read.
