# Sushi restaurant is a cut above the rest

Mediocre Japanese restau
rants seem to be everywhere
these days.
For this reason, my visit to
Fuki Sushi was a welcome
change from what I had ex
pected. The atmosphere is a
pleasant complement to a
tasty summer meal.
Newly remodeled, the res
taurant boasts fresh,
Japanese-style decor, with
perfectly spaced tables and
waiters and waitresses
dressed in traditional Japa
nese clothing.
The menu contains a large
variety of Japanese
specialties. For sushi lovers,
there is a tempting array of
delicacies, which can be eaten
either at the sushi bar or at
a table.
Fuki Sushi also has a grand
assortment of other tradi
tional favorites. We started
with Chicken Kushiyaki
($3.75), chicken skewered
with vegetables and served
with a small flame broiler at
the table. This made a great
appetizer, perhaps especially
delicious because we cooked
it ourselves.
Next we had an order of
Gyoza ($4.50), Japanese-style
potstickers. They were
noticeably homemade and
much better than the
potstickers served at many

Chinese restaurants.
We then tried an order of
California Rolls. Even people
who cringe at the mere
thought of sushi might enjoy
these.
For a main course we had
the Chicken Teriyaki & As
sorted Tempura Dinner
($13.50). Once again, I could
taste a marked difference
from the food at other res
taurants in both the teriyaki
and the tempura. The bone
less chicken, smothered in a
delicious teriyaki sauce, was
cooked perfectly. The tem
pura, highlighted by the large
pieces of prawns, was fresh
and not too greasy.
All the dinners are served
with steamed rice and a
choice of miso soup or green
salad.
Although we sampled some
of the more typical dishes, the
menu includes a variety of
vegetarian dishes and an as
sortment of broiled seafood.
They also serve "Nabemono,"
meat and vegetables cooked
at your table in a pot of spe
cial broth.
Naturally, high-quality
food, combined with a good
atmosphere and this restau
rant's amenities, does not
come for free. Prices are
moderate to high.
Fuki Sushi, open for both
lunch and dinner, is located
at 4119 El Camino Real in
Palo Alto.
