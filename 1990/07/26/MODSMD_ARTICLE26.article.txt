## Evans and Jorgensen gather Goodwill gold Incoming freshman stars as well 
### Chris Grader Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
After receiving great reviews
in the spring, the Janet and
Janel show has found a new
arena and a new crowd to play
to.
Sophomore swimmers Janet
Evans and Janel Jorgensen, who
each won three events at the
NCAA championships in March
to claim high-point honors, com
bined for five gold and three
silver medals at the Goodwill
Games over the weekend. De
spite top-flight international
competition coming from fast
Germany and just about every
where else, the two Cardinal
swimmers highlighted a meet
that proved America once again
rules the pool.
And, in a sight other schools'
coaches would rather not see,
incoming freshman Summer
Sanders also got into the act,
winning three gold medals of
her own in the 200-meter and
400-meter individual medleys
and the 200-meter butterfly.

Sanders beat Evans, the defend
ing NCAA and Olympic cham
pion, in the 400 IM.
But despite suffering her first
loss in one of "her" events in
three years, Evans still was the
meet's top star, winning a full
house of medals: three golds and
two silvers. She opened the meet
with a win in the 800-meter
freestyle Friday, defeating East
German Anke Moehring by five
seconds.
But the following day she met
her match in Sanders, a 17-year
old from Roseville, Calif.
Sanders, an outstanding but
terflier, opened up a sizable lead
in the opening butterfly leg of
the 400-meter IM. Evans, who
is a world-ranked backstroker,
expected to catch her on the sec
ond leg but could not. Evans
got to within one second on the
backstroke leg but Sanders
gained on the breaststroke and
held off Evans on the freestlye
to win the gold by .70 seconds.
The two finished well over
nine seconds ahead of the rest

of the field.
Sanders swan a 4:39.22, 7.68
seconds faster than she had ever
swam the event before but still
a second and a half off Evans'
American record.
"I knew in the back of my
mind that yeah, I can do it, be
cause we're both here and I was
right next to her and I wouldn't
be here if I wasn't just as good,"
Sanders said. "But I really
didn't think it would happen.
"I just said 'Great swim' (after
the race). Then I said, 'You're
No. 1. You'll always be No. I.' "
"Summer Sanders came up
with just a fantastic perform
ance," Stanford and U.S. Coach
Richard Quick said. "Take no
credit away from her. She was
just outstanding. Janet was very
good. She beat a very good Janet
Evans."
"I'm happy with that time and
everything," Evans said. "I al
ways have said that I swim for
myself, and that still holds true.
I don't really listen to what
anyone else says, that, well,
'She's won so many 400 IMs in
a row,' and that stuff. I never
really listen to that.
"I mean, you win a few, you
lose a few. That's life, isn't it?
I mean, that's competition and
that's why I compete. You travel.
You make friends all through

the world. That's what it's all
about, I think.
"I mean, the sun will shine
tomorrow, right?"
Evans won a second silver
later on that day by swimming
the anchor leg of the 800-meter
freestyle relay. She gained a sec
ond and a half on East Ger
many's Heike Friedrich on that
leg but could not overcome the
three-second advantage the East
Germans had built on the first
three legs.
Sunday Evans won the 400-
meter freestyle by five seconds
and Monday she cruised to vic
tory in the 1,500-meter freestyle
to close out her meet. Evans
swam a 15:54.23 to win the race
by 18 seconds. It was the second
fastest time in history, trailing
her own world record by 2.13
seconds. Evans is the only
women ever to break 16
minutes.
Jorgensen also started the
meet on the right foot, winning
her specialty, the 100-meter but
terfly, Friday. She swam a
1:00.98, defeating USC's Terri
O'Loughlin by .41 seconds.
Sunday Jorgensen earned a
silver medal in the 400-meter
freestyle relay. She swam the
third leg for an American team
that lost to the East Germans
by .40 seconds.
Sanders second gold in as
many events came Monday night
in the 200-meter IM. She was
not originally on the U.S. team
in that event but was added be

cause there were only seven
entrants. Sanders swam a
2:14.06 to defeat Mary Ellen
Blanchard by 1.6 seconds.
Jorgensen, who was not
feeling well at all Monday,
placed seventh in the 200-meter
IM.
Sanders made it three-for
three by taking the 200-meter
butterfly Tuesday night. She
swam a 2:09.46, good for the
fifth-fastest time in history. Jor
gensen, still not at 100 percent,
placed fourth at 2:16.39.
And while the U.S. could not
beat the East Germans in the
first two relays of the meet, they
finally did in the third. Betsy
Mitchell, Tracey McFarlane,
Jorgensen and Nicole Haislett
swam an American-record time
of 4:06.94 to take the gold in
the 400-meter medley relay. It
was .81 seconds better than the
old American record and it al
lowed a U.S. women's relay to
defeat an East German team for
the first time since 1978, when
Haislett was five.
While the kids were having
their way in Seattle, several
other Stanford swimmers fared
well. June graduate Jill Johnson
just missed medalling with a
fourth-place finish in the 200-
meter breaststroke and junior
Dede Trimble did the same in
the 200-meter backstroke.
Johnson did swim a personal
best and beat Blanchard, the
American record-holder in the
200-yard breaststroke.

to close out her meet. Evans
swam a 15:54.23 to win the race
by 18 seconds. It was the second
fastest time in history, trailing
her own world record by 2.13
seconds. Evans is the only
women ever to break 16
minutes.
Jorgensen also started the
meet on the right foot, winning
her specialty, the 100-meter but
terfly, Friday. She swam a
1:00.98, defeating USC's Terri
O'Loughlin by .41 seconds.
Sunday Jorgensen earned a
silver medal in the 400-meter
freestyle relay. She swam the
third leg for an American team
that lost to the East Germans
by .40 seconds.
Sanders second gold in as
many events came Monday night
in the 200-meter IM. She was
not originally on the U.S. team
in that event but was added be

cause there were only seven
entrants. Sanders swam a
2:14.06 to defeat Mary Ellen
Blanchard by 1.6 seconds.
Jorgensen, who was not
feeling well at all Monday,
placed seventh in the 200-meter
IM.
Sanders made it three-for
three by taking the 200-meter
butterfly Tuesday night. She
swam a 2:09.46, good for the
fifth-fastest time in history. Jor
gensen, still not at 100 percent,
placed fourth at 2:16.39.
And while the U.S. could not
beat the East Germans in the
first two relays of the meet, they
finally did in the third. Betsy
Mitchell, Tracey McFarlane,
Jorgensen and Nicole Haislett
swam an American-record time
of 4:06.94 to take the gold in
the 400-meter medley relay. It
was .81 seconds better than the
old American record and it al
lowed a U.S. women's relay to
defeat an East German team for
the first time since 1978, when
Haislett was five.
While the kids were having
their way in Seattle, several
other Stanford swimmers fared
well. June graduate Jill Johnson
just missed medalling with a
fourth-place finish in the 200-
meter breaststroke and junior
Dede Trimble did the same in
the 200-meter backstroke.
Johnson did swim a personal
best and beat Blanchard, the
American record-holder in the
200-yard breaststroke.
After receiving great reviews
in the spring, the Janet and
Janel show has found a new
arena and a new crowd to play
to.
Sophomore swimmers Janet
Evans and Janel Jorgensen, who
each won three events at the
NCAA championships in March
to claim high-point honors, com
bined for five gold and three
silver medals at the Goodwill
Games over the weekend. De
spite top-flight international
competition coming from fast
Germany and just about every
where else, the two Cardinal
swimmers highlighted a meet
that proved America once again
rules the pool.
And, in a sight other schools'
coaches would rather not see,
incoming freshman Summer
Sanders also got into the act,
winning three gold medals of
her own in the 200-meter and
400-meter individual medleys
and the 200-meter butterfly.

Sanders beat Evans, the defend
ing NCAA and Olympic cham
pion, in the 400 IM.
But despite suffering her first
loss in one of "her" events in
three years, Evans still was the
meet's top star, winning a full
house of medals: three golds and
two silvers. She opened the meet
with a win in the 800-meter
freestyle Friday, defeating East
German Anke Moehring by five
seconds.
But the following day she met
her match in Sanders, a 17-year
old from Roseville, Calif.
Sanders, an outstanding but
terflier, opened up a sizable lead
in the opening butterfly leg of
the 400-meter IM. Evans, who
is a world-ranked backstroker,
expected to catch her on the sec
ond leg but could not. Evans
got to within one second on the
backstroke leg but Sanders
gained on the breaststroke and
held off Evans on the freestlye
to win the gold by .70 seconds.
The two finished well over
nine seconds ahead of the rest

Sanders swan a 4:39.22, 7.68
seconds faster than she had ever
swam the event before but still
a second and a half off Evans'
American record.
"I knew in the back of my
mind that yeah, I can do it, be
cause we're both here and I was
right next to her and I wouldn't
be here if I wasn't just as good,"
Sanders said. "But I really
didn't think it would happen.
"I just said 'Great swim' (after
the race). Then I said, 'You're
No. 1. You'll always be No. I.' "
"Summer Sanders came up
with just a fantastic perform
ance," Stanford and U.S. Coach
Richard Quick said. "Take no
credit away from her. She was
just outstanding. Janet was very
good. She beat a very good Janet
Evans."
"I'm happy with that time and
everything," Evans said. "I al
ways have said that I swim for
myself, and that still holds true.
I don't really listen to what
anyone else says, that, well,
'She's won so many 400 IMs in
a row,' and that stuff. I never
really listen to that.
"I mean, you win a few, you
lose a few. That's life, isn't it?
I mean, that's competition and
that's why I compete. You travel.
You make friends all through

the world. That's what it's all
about, I think.
"I mean, the sun will shine
tomorrow, right?"
Evans won a second silver
later on that day by swimming
the anchor leg of the 800-meter
freestyle relay. She gained a sec
ond and a half on East Ger
many's Heike Friedrich on that
leg but could not overcome the
three-second advantage the East
Germans had built on the first
three legs.
