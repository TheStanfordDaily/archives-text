### Chris Grader Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
After receiving great reviews
in the spring, the Janet and
Janel show has found a new
arena and a new crowd to play
to.
Sophomore swimmers Janet
Evans and Janel Jorgensen, who
each won three events at the
NCAA championships in March
to claim high-point honors, com
bined for five gold and three
silver medals at the Goodwill
Games over the weekend. De
spite top-flight international
competition coming from fast
Germany and just about every
where else, the two Cardinal
swimmers highlighted a meet
that proved America once again
rules the pool.
And, in a sight other schools'
coaches would rather not see,
incoming freshman Summer
Sanders also got into the act,
winning three gold medals of
her own in the 200-meter and
400-meter individual medleys
and the 200-meter butterfly.

Sanders beat Evans, the defend
ing NCAA and Olympic cham
pion, in the 400 IM.
But despite suffering her first
loss in one of "her" events in
three years, Evans still was the
meet's top star, winning a full
house of medals: three golds and
two silvers. She opened the meet
with a win in the 800-meter
freestyle Friday, defeating East
German Anke Moehring by five
seconds.
But the following day she met
her match in Sanders, a 17-year
old from Roseville, Calif.
Sanders, an outstanding but
terflier, opened up a sizable lead
in the opening butterfly leg of
the 400-meter IM. Evans, who
is a world-ranked backstroker,
expected to catch her on the sec
ond leg but could not. Evans
got to within one second on the
backstroke leg but Sanders
gained on the breaststroke and
held off Evans on the freestlye
to win the gold by .70 seconds.
The two finished well over
nine seconds ahead of the rest
