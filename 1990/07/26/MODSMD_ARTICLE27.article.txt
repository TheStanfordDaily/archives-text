### Chris Grader Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
One title down, one more to go.
The U.S. women's basketball team captured its
second consecutive world title by defeating Yugos
lavia 88-78 at the World Championships in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia. The Americans, who defeated
Yugoslavia to win the 1988 Olympics and also
won the 1986 World Championships, now travel
to Seattle to compete in the Goodwill Games.
Women's basketball begins Saturday there.
June graduate Jennifer Azzi is a starter for
the U.S. team and Sonja Henning was also on
the squad. Last year Azzi won the Wade and
Naismith Awards as the nation's top collegiate
player while Henning, who will be a senior, is a
top All-America candidate for this upcoming
season.
After easily winning its preliminary pool of
four teams, things got a little tougher in the
second round. The U.S. needed to come from 10
points down to defeat Cuba 87-78 in the second
round opener last week. The U.S. then handled

Canada 95-70 last Wednesday and beat Bulgaria
93-72 last Thursday. Azzi had a team-high 13
points in that contest.
The team then advanced to the semifinals,
meeting Czechoslovakia, the runner-up in the
other second-round group. Azzi scored 10 points
in that game Saturday to help the Americans to
an 87-59 victory and a berth in the final. There
they met Yugoslavia, a 74-66 winner over Cuba
in the other semifinal.
Katrina McClain, a Georgia graduate who
played on the 1988 Olympic team, had 23 points
and Teresa Edwards, another 1988 Olympian and
former Bulldog, added 17. The Yugoslavians had
difficulty slowing down the American's up-tempo
style and became disorganized when captain
Sladana Golic left the game with an injury.
The U.S. won the title without losing a single
game and appears to be the favorite in Seattle.
The team is coached by Rutgers Coach Theresa
Grentz and features 12 of the nation's top players.
Five have Olympic experience and Henning is the
only player who has not yet graduated from col
lege.
