## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Men's basketball Coach Mike Montgomery has
spent four years trying to build the Cardinal
program into a consistent winner and now he is
finding out success doesn't always bring rewards.
For the third time in the last three years
Montgomery finds himself needing to replace an
assistant coach who left to take a head coaching
position elsewhere.
Last week Saint Michael's College, a small
school in Winooski, Vermont, announced that
former Cardinal assistant coach Tom Crowley
had been named the head coach. He follows Barry
Parkhill, who resigned from the position. The
Purple Knights are a Division II school but play
in the Northeast-10 Conference, one of the divi
sion's stronger leagues.
"I'm very excited about this opportunity,"
Crowley said. "It's always been a dream of mine
to be a head coach, and with Saint Michael's
being a good school with a strong basketball
tradition . .. let's just say I'm really looking for
ward to it."
"I'm very happy with both the search commit
tee's choice and Tom's decision," Saint Michael's
Athletic Director Edward Markey said. "Tom has
all the qualities we were looking for. I feel con
fident that he'll be able to continue to build and
improve our program."
Crowley had been at Stanford two seasons.

assisting the Cardinal to a 44-19 record and two
postseason berths. He had previously been an
assistant at Rutgers University from 1985-88 and
coached at Pennsylvania from 1982-85.
Crowley graduated from Penn in 1978. He let
tered in basketball for three seasons there and
was named the South Jersey College Player of
the Year after leading the Quakers to the NCAA
Tournament his senior season. He served one
year as an assistant at his alma mater, then
coached for three years at Xavier before returning
to Penn.
"I'm really excited for Tom and this opportunity
for him," Montgomery said. "We're sorry to see
him leave, but it's a natural progression in Tom's
career."
Crowley plans on keeping both Purple Knight
assistants, Tom O'Shea and Mark Schmidt, and
is excited about his first head coaching job. "I'm
sure there will be a lot of adjusting for me and
my assistants, but my philosophy on basketball
is this: that the game is for the players and that
the basketball program is for the students and
the community. A successful program is a source
of pride and friendship for the campus and the
surrounding community. As coaches we are here
to teach and motivate, but the game has to be
fun for everybody."
Two years ago Stanford assistant Denny Hus
ton left to become the head coach at Weber State
while Barry Collier left to become the top man
at Butler University last summer.
