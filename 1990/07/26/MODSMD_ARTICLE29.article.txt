No school has had three
award-winners since 1982,
but Stanford almost certainly
will. Tennis players Debbie

Sandra Birch and Teri Whit
linger were all nominated for
their sport's award. Graham,
a junior, won the NCAA
singles title and finished the
year ranked No. 1; McGrath,
who turned pro after winning
the NCAA doubles crown in
her freshman season, was
ranked No. 1 much of the
year and finished No. 2;
Birch, a senior, was the 1989
NCAA singles champ and
finished this year ranked
third; and, Whitlinger, a
senior, was ranked in the top
dozen and combined with
McGrath to win the doubles
title.
Birch and swimmer Jenna
Johnson won Honda-
Broderick Awards last year.
Johnson graduated and
served as an assistant for the
swim team this past season.
