# LeMond wins third Tour
## 
### Daniel Picker Staff writer With AP wire reports 
Proving that he relishes the
role of underdog, American Greg
LeMond came from behind to
win his third Tour de France.
With his second consecutive
come-from-behind triumph,
LeMond joins an elite group of
riders who have won three or
more of the greatest of all bike
races.
Not only is LeMond the first
American to win the grueling
event, but he has come to dom
inate this European sport,
riding into the Champs-Elysee
as the overall leader of this
year's 2,112-mile event. It was
literally an uphill battle for
LeMond who was behind by
more than 10 minutes for many
of the early stages of the Tour.
LeMond can now look to bask
in the glory previously reserved
for European conquerors Ber
nard Hinault, Eddy Merckx, and
Jacques Anquetil — the only
riders to win more than three
Tours. These heroes were all tri
umphant five times, and it is
their company in posterity
LeMond will attempt to join in
the years to come.
This year LeMond outrode a
relatively unknown Italian rider,
Claudio Chiappucci, by 2
minutes and 16 seconds. Last
year LeMond crushed

Frenchman Laurent Fignon by
a mere eight seconds. His first
victory came in 1986. In the
interim LeMond battled illness
and a near fatal hunting acci
dent which left shotgun pellets
in his body.
LeMond gained the leader's
jersey for the first time while
racing in Saturday's time trial
through the verdant country
side at Lac Vassviere. There he
established an insurmountable
lead of 2 minutes 16 seconds,
the same margin of victory he
held over Chiappucci at Sun
day's finish. Eric Breukink of
the Netherlands was third, 2:39
back.
In addition to his time-trialing
ability, another important, albeit
lesser-known, key to LeMond's
victory was his performance
during the mountain stage from
Lourdes to Pau a week ago Wed
nesday. On this stage LeMond
was hampered by a Hat tire and
lost *12 miles to Chiappucci. The
Italian, and other race leaders,
abandoned any thought of
mercy and attempted to increase
their margin over the defending
champion.
But by playing a game of
leapfrog, LeMond's Z teammates
enabled him to regain contact
with the leaders by allowing him
to draft off them up to the pack.
With this help, LeMond com
pleted the stage without losing
a second to the Italian.
