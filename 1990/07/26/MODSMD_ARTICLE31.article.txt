# Fono's floral art blossoms
## Monotypes draw upon tradition for inspiration 
### Wendy Witt 
Andrea Fono sits at a table
in Cafe Andrea, sipping iced cof
fee. Outside, beneath a canopy,
a player piano entertains a hand
ful of diners escaping the heat
and the Saturday crowds at
Stanford Shopping Center.
Fono's first Bay Area show,
"Monotypes 1990," a collection
of floral monotypes, runs
through July 30 at Smith An
dersen Gallery in Palo Alto.
Monoprinting is a technique in
which the artist paints directly
on glass and then transfers the
painting to paper.
Fono, 26, runs her fingers
through her thick brown curls
and says,"I never thought of
not being an artist, but I didn't
think it would happen so soon."
When Fono graduated from
Sarah Lawrence College four
years ago, she intended simply
to come home and work in her
parents' restaurants. "But," she
explains, "someone was inter
ested in buying a painting from
me and the next week I got a
commission."
Fono's parents immigrated to
the United States in 1957,
fleeing the Hungarian revolu
tion. Since then, her parents
have opened the Magic Pan res
taurant chain, a Hungarian res
taurant in Ghiradelli Square in
San Francisco and four restau
rants in the Stanford Shopping
Center, including the cafe named
after Andrea.
Fono's art career is similarly
moving with the speed of light
ning. She began exhibiting her
work in her parents' restaurants
as a teenager and since then has
shown her work in France,
Spain and at Sarah Lawrence.
Andrea was named San Fran
cisco's official artist for the 50th
anniversary of the Golden Gate
Bridge in 1987, and her work
can be found in numerous col
lections, including those of
gubernatorial candidate Dianne
Feinstein, San Francisco Mayor
Art Agnos and opera singer
Beverly Sills.
Fono credits her success in
part to watching her parents.
"With the restaurants and doing
a lot of traveling with them to
Europe, I was able to see how
vision can come into reality with
work and borrowing money,"
she says.
Fono feels artists sometimes
neglect the pragmatic aspects of
their careers. "I don't think it
occurs sometimes to creative
people that you need money to

move ahead with an art career.
It is the same as a medical
career," she says.
"There's just such a negative
attitude about making a living
from art, and I think that for
me the breakthrough was
changing my attitude about it.
It wasn't just painting; it was
making a living and being inde
pendent."
Fono sits beneath one of her
oil paintings, done in her char
acteristically colorful and spon
taneous style. Next to it hangs
a traditional portrait her par
ents brought from Hungary.
This mixture of tradition and
self-expression is the main force
that shapes Fono's art and life.
Fono majored in history in
college and values her Hun
garian heritage. "Hungarian
was my first language. I visited
Europe regularly growing up
and my parents always took me
to a lot of museums and
galleries," she says.
Fono spent the summer before
her senior year in high school
studying photography with Leo
Holub at Stanford. After, she
took a five-week trip with her
father to Hungary, Romania and
Transylvania. She remembers
"taking lots of pictures in Tran
sylvania and coming back with
a lot of photographs of flowers
and women selling flowers, a lot
of pastoral scenes."
"In Transylvania . . . people
hand-carve gates, do tapestry,
and paint. There's this whole
sense of folklore maintained.
They use lots of flowers and
hearts. I recently noticed some
antique furniture from Transyl

vania we have in our house that
has that floral design. I think
these floral images have influ
enced me growing up."
Fono explains how this floral
tradition manifested itself in her
work, quite unconsciously. "I
went to my studio one day in
San Francisco and looked
around and said, 'Oh, I forgot
my flowers,' because I like to
have flowers around me. And I
thought to myself, 'Why not
create your own photo
flowers?' "
"I didn't plan it. I had been
doing a lot of botanical illustra
tions in high school, so I had
experience looking at flowers.
But it really just became a part
of me."
Fono turns her attention to a
tiger lily sitting in a small glass
vase on the table, carefully
touching the petals. "We are just
as fragile as these are, and as
tender. I guess what I'm saying
is that I want to speak to the
soul, to the spirit that just wants
to live and be itself."
Monoprinting is a relatively
new experience for Fono, who
in the past has worked with
more traditional painting styles
and with sculpture and photog
raphy. She was introduced to
the technique two years ago.
"It was exhilarating," she
says."I never had that kind of
freedom before, of letting go.
There's something about work
ing with paper — it's not as
intimidating as working on
canvas.
"My dream is to be able to
do on canvas what I've been
doing with my monoprinting."

and paint. There's this whole
sense of folklore maintained.
They use lots of flowers and
hearts. I recently noticed some
antique furniture from Transyl

vania we have in our house that
has that floral design. I think
these floral images have influ
enced me growing up."
Fono explains how this floral
tradition manifested itself in her
work, quite unconsciously. "I
went to my studio one day in
San Francisco and looked
around and said, 'Oh, I forgot
my flowers,' because I like to
have flowers around me. And I
thought to myself, 'Why not
create your own photo
flowers?' "
"I didn't plan it. I had been
doing a lot of botanical illustra
tions in high school, so I had
experience looking at flowers.
But it really just became a part
of me."
Fono turns her attention to a
tiger lily sitting in a small glass
vase on the table, carefully
touching the petals. "We are just
as fragile as these are, and as
tender. I guess what I'm saying
is that I want to speak to the
soul, to the spirit that just wants
to live and be itself."
Monoprinting is a relatively
new experience for Fono, who
in the past has worked with
more traditional painting styles
and with sculpture and photog
raphy. She was introduced to
the technique two years ago.
"It was exhilarating," she
says."I never had that kind of
freedom before, of letting go.
There's something about work
ing with paper — it's not as
intimidating as working on
canvas.
"My dream is to be able to
do on canvas what I've been
doing with my monoprinting."

Local artist Andrea Fono poses in a self-portrait. Her exhibit,
"Monotypes 1990," is showing at Smith Anderson Gallery, 200
Homer Avenue, Palo Alto, through July 30.
Andrea Fono sits at a table
in Cafe Andrea, sipping iced cof
fee. Outside, beneath a canopy,
a player piano entertains a hand
ful of diners escaping the heat
and the Saturday crowds at
Stanford Shopping Center.
Fono's first Bay Area show,
"Monotypes 1990," a collection
of floral monotypes, runs
through July 30 at Smith An
dersen Gallery in Palo Alto.
Monoprinting is a technique in
which the artist paints directly
on glass and then transfers the
painting to paper.
Fono, 26, runs her fingers
through her thick brown curls
and says,"I never thought of
not being an artist, but I didn't
think it would happen so soon."
When Fono graduated from
Sarah Lawrence College four
years ago, she intended simply
to come home and work in her
parents' restaurants. "But," she
explains, "someone was inter
ested in buying a painting from
me and the next week I got a
commission."
Fono's parents immigrated to
the United States in 1957,
fleeing the Hungarian revolu
tion. Since then, her parents
have opened the Magic Pan res
taurant chain, a Hungarian res
taurant in Ghiradelli Square in
San Francisco and four restau
rants in the Stanford Shopping
Center, including the cafe named
after Andrea.
Fono's art career is similarly
moving with the speed of light
ning. She began exhibiting her
work in her parents' restaurants
as a teenager and since then has
shown her work in France,
Spain and at Sarah Lawrence.
Andrea was named San Fran
cisco's official artist for the 50th
anniversary of the Golden Gate
Bridge in 1987, and her work
can be found in numerous col
lections, including those of
gubernatorial candidate Dianne
Feinstein, San Francisco Mayor
Art Agnos and opera singer
Beverly Sills.
Fono credits her success in
part to watching her parents.
"With the restaurants and doing
a lot of traveling with them to
Europe, I was able to see how
vision can come into reality with
work and borrowing money,"
she says.
Fono feels artists sometimes
neglect the pragmatic aspects of
their careers. "I don't think it
occurs sometimes to creative
people that you need money to

move ahead with an art career.
It is the same as a medical
career," she says.
"There's just such a negative
attitude about making a living
from art, and I think that for
me the breakthrough was
changing my attitude about it.
It wasn't just painting; it was
making a living and being inde
pendent."
Fono sits beneath one of her
oil paintings, done in her char
acteristically colorful and spon
taneous style. Next to it hangs
a traditional portrait her par
ents brought from Hungary.
This mixture of tradition and
self-expression is the main force
that shapes Fono's art and life.
Fono majored in history in
college and values her Hun
garian heritage. "Hungarian
was my first language. I visited
Europe regularly growing up
and my parents always took me
to a lot of museums and
galleries," she says.
Fono spent the summer before
her senior year in high school
studying photography with Leo
Holub at Stanford. After, she
took a five-week trip with her
father to Hungary, Romania and
Transylvania. She remembers
"taking lots of pictures in Tran
sylvania and coming back with
a lot of photographs of flowers
and women selling flowers, a lot
of pastoral scenes."
"In Transylvania . . . people
hand-carve gates, do tapestry,
and paint. There's this whole
sense of folklore maintained.
They use lots of flowers and
hearts. I recently noticed some

vania we have in our house that
