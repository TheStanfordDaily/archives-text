# Tresidder chooses outside contractor

### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The management of Tres
idder Memorial Union not
ified most of its maintenance
workers on Tuesday of the
contracting company to
replace them in the fall, ac
cording to Tresidder Service
Manager Jeanette Smith-
Laws.
The decision has been
awaited since July 10, when
the workers received layoff
notices, as did 40 employees
in other University depart
ments.
United Stanford Workers
field representative Rodney
Barnette said he learned yes
terday morning of Tresidder
management's decision to
contract out the custodial po
sitions to American Building
Maintenance.
The Tresidder workers
have until next Monday to
decide whether they want to
"bump," or replace, workers
of lesser seniority, a right
guaranteed to all workers
being laid off by the 1988
USW contract with the Uni
versity.
Workers have the option of
either bumping other USW
members or applying to the
contractor for the same Tres
idder positions at comparable
wages.
Barnette said the crew has
not been told what benefits
the company may be offering.
Tresidder management an
nounced its decision in June
to lay off the custodians and
contract the work to an out
side company. The workers
were originally faced with a
July 20 deadline to decide
whether they would bump
other workers or sign with
the contractor.

The USW filed a grievance
with the National Labor Re
lations Board last week com
plaining that the deadline was
unfair because it required
workers to make the decision
without knowing what
benefits the new contractor
might offer.
Barnette said the union
negotiated with Employee Re
lations and obtained an ex
tension for the workers.
Smith-Laws said the con
tractor's proposal calls for
fewer workers in the mainte
nance crew. But the final
number of custodians will
depend on the workers' deci
sions on whether to bump or
not, she said.
Smith-Laws added that
Linda Crouse, a laborer in
charge of setting up rooms
for banquets and conferences,
will be rehired by the con
tractor — if at all — as a
custodian.
She added that Crouse will
get the same salary as the
custodians if rehired. Cur
rently, laborers are on a
higher pay scale than cus
todians.
Crouse objected to the
change in job classification,
which may lower her wages.
The Stanford-USW contract
stipulates that if workers are
laid off because of contracting
out, "the University will pro
vide by contract that the con
tractor is obligated to offer
employment at substantially
equivalent wages" to the laid
ofT workers.
Crouse said Tresidder man
agement is being unfair.
"Someone has to do the set
ups. It's a laborer's work, and
they call it a custodian's."
"I'm fighting all the way
on that one," she added.
