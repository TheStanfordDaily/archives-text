# Two lawyers court news profession

Julie Birkel graduated from Stanford in
1979 with a degree in American studies.
Eleven years and a successful law career
later, Birkel is back — this time to pursue
a new profession.
Birkel was surprised to find she was not
the only lawyer changing professions. On
her first day of Stanford's Mass Media In
stitute, she met Michael Roe, a criminal
prosecutor who had the same idea.
Birkel and Roe are two lawyers who have
decided to venture beyond the courtroom
and enter the field of television news. Their
starting place is Stanford's eight-week work
shop in broadcast news.
"I liked a lot of things about law, but
what I did not like was always having win
ning or losing on the line," said Birkel, 32,
a commercial litigation lawyer.
Birkel started to think about how she
could apply her background in law in a
different way. "Coming to Stanford was the
perfect chance to use my research skills,
keep up with what is happening legally and

utilize my public speaking skills," she said.
Roe, 30, was involved with media long
before coming to Stanford. Throughout high
school and college, he worked as a disc
jockey.
"As I was finishing up my degree at Notre
Dame, I began sending off law school ap
plications, and at the same time, demo tapes
to radio stations," he said.
Roe ended up with acceptance letters to
law schools and a job offer as a disc jockey.
He chose law, but is now bringing his skills
full circle.
"The desire to be an effective com
municator brought me into criminal law.
And now, I am taking that knowledge one
step further and applying it to broadcast
news," Roe said.
Both Birkel and Roe saw a void in legal
reporting on TV, and felt they could help
fill it."I would watch the news and see
that certain reporters didn't have the back
ground to understand legal issues," Roe
said.
Birkel and Roe have added a new dimen
sion to the course, according to classmates.

Eric Pierce, a senior majoring in commu
nication, said, "Having the lawyers in the
class has set a good example. They really
know how to speak and present themselves
with an authority that comes across so
well."
John Doolittle, instructor of the broadcast
workshop, said broadcast students often
pursue law careers, and the lawyers in his
classroom show the trend reversing.
"An experienced trial lawyer will be
familiar with having to appeal to an audi
ence of a jury, and tell a story in a succinct,
precise manner," Doolittle said. "And a good
journalist has to do that too — take a
complicated story and make it easy for the
average person to understand."
Lawyers, having dealt with such issues,
are at an advantage, Doolittle said. "This
is a competitive profession and you have to
be good. These professionals are making it
even more clear that you have to be good."
Both lawyers plan to take their newfound
profession as far as possible. "If it turns
out I have what it takes, I really want to
give this a shot," Birkel said.
