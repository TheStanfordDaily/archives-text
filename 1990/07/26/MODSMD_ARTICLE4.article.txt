# Redwood Summer protest divides Fort Bragg
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Editor's Note: Three Weekly staff
members travelled to Fort Bragg
last weekend to cover a demon
stration that drew national atten
tion to what will be an important
ballot issue for Californians this
November.

Environmentalists seeking to
protect old growth redwood
forests and logging families
wearing yellow ribbons to show
solidarity divided the coastal
town of Fort Bragg into green
and yellow camps Saturday as
the two groups squared off at
the corner of Redwood Avenue
and Main Street.
The action, which was more
peaceful than expected, started
early in the morning in this log
ging town, home of the Georgia
Pacific Lumber Company head
quarters. More than 1,000 en
vironmentalists gathered for a
rally on Georgia Pacific land in
the northwestern part of town.
They came from all over the
west coast and represented
several different environmental
groups. They listened to songs
and speeches about logging and
the ancient forests, ate free Ben
and Jerry's ice cream and
prepared to get arrested as the
overcast day wore into after
noon.
On the other side of the town,
logging families and lumber
company supporters held a
parade and later a large rally in
the football field outside Red
wood Elementary School. The
rally was a sea of signs and yel
low T-shirts which read: "Log
ging families: An endangered
species."
All day in this town of 6,000
— where about 2,000 are di
rectly employed by the logging
industry — cars drove down the
streets with yellow ribbons tied
to their antennas as a sign of
their support for the logging

companies.
At city hall, officials scurried
to accomodate more than 150
journalists who had converged
upon the town in anticipation
of a massive demonstration to
be followed by many arrests.
City hall was also the command
center for the 300 police officers
who had come from as far south
as San Jose and as far north as
Del Norte to keep the peace.
As the afternoon wore on,
townspeople began to line Main
Street and rows of police officers
gathered by the front gate of

Georgia Pacific. At about 2:30
p.m. the environmentalists, led
by a pickup truck with
musicians in the back that
served as a mobile stage, headed
south toward the center of town
and Georgia Pacific headquar
ters.
A few townspeople came
north to watch the environmen
talists or to stride defiantly in
front of them with signs reading
"We Support Our Timber Indus
try," but the situation remained
peaceful.
Earth First!, the main group
organizing Redwood Summer
activities — a series of demon
strations aimed at raising
awareness about logging prac
tices that threaten California's
old growth forests — has been
criticized in the past for radical,
sometimes militant, defense of
trees.
But last Saturday's demon
stration was very peaceful and
well-organized. According to
Earth First! spokespeople, the
protesters went through several
hours of non-violence training
before the event and the theme
of non-violence was stressed
throughout the day.
By the time the environmen
talists marched down Main
Street, their ranks had swelled
to more than 2,000. The police

formed a line across the road at
Redwood Avenue. The demon
strators' truck stopped.
The block of Redwood Avenue
west of Main Street was filled
with demonstrators who
chanted and sang in front of the
high wire fences which enclose
the Georgia Pacific lumberyards
that take up almost all the
waterfront property in Fort
Bragg.
Police stood behind the fences
and large redwood logs, or "tree
cadavers" as one environmen
talist called them, that were
used to block the protesters'
way.
Right in front of the gate,
many of the young people in the
demonstration, which was atten
ded by people of all ages, mostly
white, danced in a circle holding
hands and sang "Ring around
the redwood! Ring around the
redwood! Clearcut! Profits! We
all fall down!"
As the singing over the loud
speakers on the truck continued,
it helped attract large numbers
of pro-lumber townspeople who
came westward from the center
of town along Redwood Avenue.
Fortunately, the pro-lumber
rally was far enough away that
the almost 2,000 townspeople
there were not drawn to the
corner of Redwood and Main.

As more timber industry sup
porters arrived, the police, in
full riot gear with their clubs
out, decided to split the crowd.
The police created a no man's
land about six feet wide between
the two crowds. To get from one
group to the other, one had to
walk a block and a half north
up Main Street and around be
cause police would not let
anyone cross the artificial gulf
fearing that the crowds would
stream together.
The speeches and songs of the
environmentalists were met
largely with taunts and curses
from the pro-lumber side. The
tension between the groups was
high and the three-hour dem
onstration seemed to drain
everyone, especially police who
had to remain on the alert the
whole time. Police on the ground
and from rooftops videotaped
the crowd.
Earlier in the demonstration,
the environmentalists had sung
a song complaining about the
FBI, which some Redwood Sum
mer demonstrators see as an in
visible foe working behind the
scenes just as it did during the
Freedom Summer of 1964.
Halfway through the demon
stration, the environmentalists
