# Environmentalists, loggers can't agree
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The rally that erupted Saturday
in the little coastal town of Fort
Bragg mirrors the larger contro
versy between environmentalists
and timber workers over the issue
of logging in ancient redwood
forests.
Yelling "Go home" to the sup
porters of the "Forests Forever"
initiative, residents displayed fear
and distrust of the movement that
threatens their jobs. Despite the
attempt of Earth First!'s organi
zers to label the efforts to preserve
ancient redwood forests as a
global concern, the issue hits
home in Fort Bragg and other
logging towns, where families,
stability and security are at stake.
Logging for a living
A town of 6,000 people, Fort
Bragg's main industry is logging.
Many families boast of more than
three generations of timber
workers. If logging is halted, how
would the town survive?
Equally important is the ques
tion of how the state economy
will be affected by reduced log
ging. According to a booklet, "The
State of the Redwoods Today,"
forest products, a $1.2 billion in
dustry in California, dominate the
North Coast's economy.
The booklet is a joint publica
tion of the American Forest Coun
cil, the California Redwood
Association, the Redwood Region
Conservation Council and the
Timber Association of California.
In November, California resi
dents will vote on Proposition 130,
the so-called "Forests Forever" in
itiative; Proposition 138, the
"Global Warming and Clearcut
ting Reduction, Wildlife Protec
tion & Reforestation Act of 1990"
and Proposition 128, the "En
vironmental Protection Act of
1990." Most of the current con
troversy centers around the first
two initiatives.
Proposition 130 earmarks $710
million for ancient forest acquisi
tion, bans all clearcutting, man

dates that no more forests can be
cut than are grown and includes
provisions aimed at protecting
wildlife habitats.
Clearcutting is defined by the
initiative as logging more than 60
percent of the timber volume of
an area greater than two and a
half acres.
Proposition 130 is sponsored by
mainstream environmental
groups such as the Sierra Club
and the National Resources De
fense Council.
According to a flier sponsored
by Califomians for New Forestry,
the state cannot afford the initi
ative because the measure would
reduce timber harvesting by 70
percent and result in 100,000
layoffs of timber industry-related
employees.
It also states that the proposi
tion will "dramatically increase"
prices for lumber, paper products
and homes.
Consequently, the timber indus
try is lending its support to
Proposition 138, which is called
the "New Forestry Initiative" by
the lumber industry and "Big
Stump" by the environmentalists.
Supporters of this measure
claim that it strikes a balance be
tween the public's call for envi
ronmental protection and the
livelihoods of loggers by banning
clearcutting while only reducing
the timber harvest by about 15
percent.
But environmentalists claim
that Proposition 138 has so many
loopholes that it will not restrict
lumber companies at all and will
mean the end of ancient forests
and eventually all forests in Cal
ifornia.
Community Solidarity Coali
tion, a Fort Bragg organization,
was founded in part to oppose the
"Forests Forever" initiative. Co
founder Don Nelson, who is also
a representative of International
Woodworkers of America, said the
group plans to start a counter
movement throughout California.

more than 1,500 supporters, was
organized by the coalition to
counter the Earth First! demon
strators.
Though Earth First! is not one
of the sponsors of Proposition
130, the lumber industry has been
getting a lot of political mileage
from labeling the initiative as the
"Earth First! Initiative." Lumber
industry supporters have relied
on the group's tarnished image to
help discredit the initiative.
Warner Chabot from the Sierra
Club called the tactic a "shameful
and deliberate lie."
Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif.,
said environmental issues have
been discussed for 15 years, but
it is the timber industry and
workers who are taking the initi
ative to preserve the forests. "The
area is the way it is because of
the people, not despite them," he
said.
Renewable resources
The timber industry has been
claiming that redwood is a very
renewable resource available for
harvesting.
According to "The State of the
Redwoods Today," redwood is the
fastest growing softwood tree in

the United States, and many
young-growth acres have more
wood now than was in the original
forests harvested in the 1880s.
Proposition 130 bans clearcut
ting and mandates selective har
vesting. The booklet defends
clearcutting as the most effective
practice for renewing a redwood
stand, as the site "can be left
undisturbed throughout the en
tire growing cycle."
The booklet claims that red
wood forests are growing at a
"phenomenal" rate and that "tim
ber growth on lands owned by
small tree farmers and ranchers
is running at three times the rate
of harvest," refuting the environ
mentalists' charges that the in
dustry is depleting the nation's
forest.
Responsible practices
Timber industry leaders are
saying that current management
is able to reconcile logging prac
tices with the preservation of the
forests. The industry owns 20.3
percent of the productive forest
land in California.
The California Forest Practice
Act currently demands reforesta
tion. According to "The State of
the Redwoods Today," five
companies are operating tree nur
series with a total output of 4.5
million redwood seedlings ajj

nually to support their reforesta
tion programs.
Many industry supporters be
lieve that the lack of facts about
ancient forest, and not bad man
agement of lumbering practice, is
causing the environmentalists'
hostile reaction to logging.
"People need wood, the owl needs
its habitat â€” all that is available.
It's a matter of management.
"A very rational, dignified sci
entific approach is the best so
lution" to the logging problem,
National Trees Society Presi
dent Greg Davis said.
On both sides of the issue
people are using facts and figures
that contradict one another and,
in many cases, a rational discus
sion of the facts quickly gives way
to a passionate argument about
people vs. trees.
Earth First! spokesperson
Anne-Marie Stenberg said that a
small group of environmentalists
and loggers were meeting to try
to find a common ground, but so
far the dialogue has been going
slowly. The issue has been char
acterized more by two passionate
monologues.
At last weekend's rally in Fort
Bragg, a former logger took the
microphone and gave a moving
speech about the need for Amer
icans to become smarter consum
ers. He advocated 100 percent
recycling of goods. He closed the
speech by addressing both sides.
"Sit at the table and let's get
talking. Tomorrow is too late.
That's all I have to say today,"
he said.
