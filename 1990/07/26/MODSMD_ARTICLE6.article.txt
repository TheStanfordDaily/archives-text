# Hoover restructures budget, research divisions

### Jeremy Weinberg 
As Hoover Institution fellows study
ways of restructuring economies in East
ern European countries, they also are
looking at restructuring a little closer to
home.
Faced with a $1 million operating
budget deficit, Hoover Director John
Raisian is cutting funds for some re
search programs and grouping the con
servative think-tank's scholars into
"research clusters" — a "repositioning"
effort in line with that throughout Stan
ford.
Raisian, who presented his plans to
Hoover's Board of Overseers at its bian
nual meeting last week, also will name
a steering committee of fellows to help
him formulate a five-year strategic plan
for the Institution by the end of this year.
The budget reductions will mean Hoo
ver will sponsor fewer academic confer
ences, hire fewer visiting scholars,
disband two advisory boards and publish
fewer articles and books.

While he hopes these
cuts will be enough to ar
rest Hoover's financial
problems, Raisian has
prepared a "disaster
plan" which will slash $2
million more if fund
raising does not meet ex
pectations in the next two
years — a plan that in-

cludes "looking at the ranks" of the In
stitution's fellows.
The budget cuts come at the same
time the Institution is seeking to raise
$10 million for initiatives exploring
changes in Eastern Europe. In fact, Hoo
ver's budget will grow from $17.5 million
to $19 million next year because of new
projects — such as training visiting
diplomats from Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia this fall — but the budget
base will be cut by $1 million.
"While we're tightening our belts,
we're also lifting weights and bulking
the rest of our body up," Raisian ex
plained. "It's a time when we have to

devote resources to the thing we spe
cialize in ... social changes in the world."
Hoover's budget cuts will not affect its
library acquisitions, but a 10 percent re
duction in Stanford's contribution to the
library will mean layoffs and cutbacks
in reading room hours, said Charles
Palm, associate director for library and
archives.
The research clusters will replace the
old grouping of fellows into the areas of
domestic, international and national se
curity affairs. The 10 to 12 clusters will
have names such as Statecraft, Democ
racy in Developing Nations, American
Institutions and Human Resources.
"From what I've heard, it makes a lot
of sense," senior research fellow Charles
Hill said. "International and domestic
matters are sort of blurred. It's a lot
better to have topics grouped that don't
stop at the water's edge."
Raisian also hopes better definition of
the Institution's research projects will
help attract contributions from founda
tions and other private donators, which

now total approximately $5 million a
year. He says more support is needed to
help solve problems that have been
"coming on for several years" because
new initiatives the Institution undertook
were not adequately funded.
But W. Glenn Campbell, Raisian's
predecessor whose long-running battle
with Stanford ended with his forced re
tirement in May 1989, disagreed with
Raisian's assessment.
"All I know is what I did," he said.
"My last year there might have been a
$200,000 deficit, if that. That's it."
Campbell, who is now counselor to the
director, also criticized his former deputy
for not seeking his advice. Raisian is "a
good man," he said, but "he's never had
any experience and he's never come to
me to ask for help."
Raisian downplayed reports of differ
ences between the two. "I do appreciate
his input," he said. "I think that some
times there's the conception that we dis
agree on lots of things and I think that's
not accurate."
