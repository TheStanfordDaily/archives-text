# Solar car finishes in top ten
## 
### Rowena Mallari 
On July 19, the Stanford
University Solar Car Project's
"SUnSUrfer" finished the 11-
day General Motors Sunrayce
USA in seventh place.
The race began in Lake
Buena Vista, Fla., and took the
solar cars through eight states
to the finish in Warren, Mich.
The top finisher was the car
from the University of Michi
gan, followed by those from
Western Washington Univer
sity and the University of Mar
yland.
Stanford's car had an
average speed of 17 mph over
the 1,625-mile course.
The SUnSUrfer had a rocky
start on the 75-mile course the
first day of the race. It shorted
out its controller after 104
minutes, causing it to finish
in 31st place out of 32. On
the second day, however, Stan
ford finished in second place
and was one of the six univer
sities to complete the second
day's 192-mile course in the
maximum time allotted for
that day. Stanford's position
moved up from 31st to 15th.
Many teams did poorly the
second day because of rain.
Showers continued over the
next three days, during which
Stanford's SUnSUrfer dis
played its aquatic abilities and
climbed to seventh place.
After the sixth day, Stanford
maintained its seventh-place
position for the rest of the
race. The final time for Stan
ford was 93 hours, 56 minutes
and 53 seconds. The top team
finished the race in 72 hours,
50 minutes and 47 seconds.
One of the things the team
members believe could have
helped their chances of win
ning was to have more time
prior to the race to road-test
the car and discover its
shortcomings in road perform
ance.
The team members began
their days by waking up and
rolling the SUnSUrfer out of
its battery-charging area at
6:45 a.m.
One member of the Stanford
team drove the SUnSUrfer,
and the other 16 were in four
support vehicles travelling
either in front of or behind
the solar car. There were six
drivers for the 11 days.
Driving was slow, especially
when it rained. The course was
primarily composed of second
ary roads, often lined with
spectators.
The 32 different solar

vehicles entered in the race
were from universities in the
United States, Canada and
Puerto Rico. "There were so
many interesting, good ways
to build things that if one
could put them together one
could make a wonderful car,"
said Stefan Heck, a sophomore
in symbolic systems and the
general coordinator of the
Stanford Solar Car Project.
The Stanford SUnSUrfer
was designed, produced and
managed completely by stu
dents over a period of 18
months beginning in fall 1988.
The students did their own re
search and fund raising and
got significant donations from
such companies as Ciba-Geigy,
Exxon and U.S. Van Lines.
The car's motor is a brush
less 20-horsepower DC motor
which weighs 50 pounds. The
controller and motor are con
sidered the best available
today and together cost
$10,000.
"The solar array is made up
of solar cells which were cho
sen for their size, efficiency
and cost," said David Caditz,
a graduate student in astro
physics, who researched the
cells, took part in the design
of the solar array, and was one
of the drivers.
One portion of the array is
composed of Electrical Engi
neering Assoc. Prof. Richard
Swanson's recently developed
Swanson cells, making the
SUnSUrfer the first product
to utilize them. Swanson cells,
the highest-yield solar cells
available today, are able to
achieve a 23 percent conver
sion efficiency, as opposed to
the 14 percent efficiency of
most solar cells.
The total weight of the car
is around 600 pounds, and it
is approximately 22 feet long.
Its total cost was roughly

$250,000.
"One of the most outstand
ing things about the Stanford
effort is that the student con
tent of the car — from design,
production, funding and man
agement — was unparalleled
on the racecourse," said Joe
Krovoza, associate director of
external relations for the En
gineering School.
"They started completely
from scratch. The Stanford
group was hungry to get out
and talk to people who really
know about parts of the car.
Unlike most teams, they
didn't go to these companies
and ask to buy their expertise.
They asked, 'Teach us how to
do this.' "
In addition, the team is com
posed mostly of undergradu
ates from a wide range of
majors — history to astro
physics — not just engineer
ing. "It was in the best of the
Stanford tradition for these
students to put their minds
together and build this car,"
said Krovoza.
And what about the future
of solar cars? Many team
members believe that instead
of solar cars, it is more real
istic to imagine solar-powered
houses which use some of the
sun's power to charge the bat
teries of electric cars.
Many of the members of the
team agree that the SUnSUr
fer is "just a vehicle that
proves it is all possible," said
Illah Nourbakhsh, a sopho
more in computer science and
chemistry who was responsi
ble for the design of the car
and was one of its drivers.
Hcwever, because of the cost
and number of solar cells
needed to collect enough en
ergy for a car relative to the
cars' size, the future large
scale use of solar cars seems
possible, but not very likely.

prior to the race to road-test
the car and discover its
shortcomings in road perform
ance.
The team members began
their days by waking up and
rolling the SUnSUrfer out of
its battery-charging area at
6:45 a.m.
One member of the Stanford
team drove the SUnSUrfer,
and the other 16 were in four
support vehicles travelling
either in front of or behind
the solar car. There were six
drivers for the 11 days.
Driving was slow, especially
when it rained. The course was
primarily composed of second
ary roads, often lined with
spectators.
The 32 different solar

vehicles entered in the race
were from universities in the
United States, Canada and
Puerto Rico. "There were so
many interesting, good ways
to build things that if one
could put them together one
could make a wonderful car,"
said Stefan Heck, a sophomore
in symbolic systems and the
general coordinator of the
Stanford Solar Car Project.
The Stanford SUnSUrfer
was designed, produced and
managed completely by stu
dents over a period of 18
months beginning in fall 1988.
The students did their own re
search and fund raising and
got significant donations from
such companies as Ciba-Geigy,
Exxon and U.S. Van Lines.
The car's motor is a brush
less 20-horsepower DC motor
which weighs 50 pounds. The
controller and motor are con
sidered the best available
today and together cost
$10,000.
"The solar array is made up
of solar cells which were cho
sen for their size, efficiency
and cost," said David Caditz,
a graduate student in astro
physics, who researched the
cells, took part in the design
of the solar array, and was one
of the drivers.
One portion of the array is
composed of Electrical Engi
neering Assoc. Prof. Richard
Swanson's recently developed
Swanson cells, making the
SUnSUrfer the first product
to utilize them. Swanson cells,
the highest-yield solar cells
available today, are able to
achieve a 23 percent conver
sion efficiency, as opposed to
the 14 percent efficiency of
most solar cells.
The total weight of the car
is around 600 pounds, and it
is approximately 22 feet long.
Its total cost was roughly

$250,000.
"One of the most outstand
ing things about the Stanford
effort is that the student con
tent of the car — from design,
production, funding and man
agement — was unparalleled
on the racecourse," said Joe
Krovoza, associate director of
external relations for the En
gineering School.
"They started completely
from scratch. The Stanford
group was hungry to get out
and talk to people who really
know about parts of the car.
Unlike most teams, they
didn't go to these companies
and ask to buy their expertise.
They asked, 'Teach us how to
do this.' "
In addition, the team is com
posed mostly of undergradu
ates from a wide range of
majors — history to astro
physics — not just engineer
ing. "It was in the best of the
Stanford tradition for these
students to put their minds
together and build this car,"
said Krovoza.
And what about the future
of solar cars? Many team
members believe that instead
of solar cars, it is more real
istic to imagine solar-powered
houses which use some of the
sun's power to charge the bat
teries of electric cars.
Many of the members of the
team agree that the SUnSUr
fer is "just a vehicle that
proves it is all possible," said
Illah Nourbakhsh, a sopho
more in computer science and
chemistry who was responsi
ble for the design of the car
and was one of its drivers.
Hcwever, because of the cost
and number of solar cells
needed to collect enough en
ergy for a car relative to the
cars' size, the future large
scale use of solar cars seems
possible, but not very likely.

On July 19, the Stanford
University Solar Car Project's
"SUnSUrfer" finished the 11-
day General Motors Sunrayce
USA in seventh place.
The race began in Lake
Buena Vista, Fla., and took the
solar cars through eight states
to the finish in Warren, Mich.
The top finisher was the car
from the University of Michi
gan, followed by those from
Western Washington Univer
sity and the University of Mar
yland.
Stanford's car had an
average speed of 17 mph over
the 1,625-mile course.
The SUnSUrfer had a rocky
start on the 75-mile course the
first day of the race. It shorted
out its controller after 104
minutes, causing it to finish
in 31st place out of 32. On
the second day, however, Stan
ford finished in second place
and was one of the six univer
sities to complete the second
day's 192-mile course in the
maximum time allotted for
that day. Stanford's position
moved up from 31st to 15th.
Many teams did poorly the
second day because of rain.
Showers continued over the
next three days, during which
Stanford's SUnSUrfer dis
played its aquatic abilities and
climbed to seventh place.
After the sixth day, Stanford
maintained its seventh-place
position for the rest of the
race. The final time for Stan
ford was 93 hours, 56 minutes
and 53 seconds. The top team
finished the race in 72 hours,
50 minutes and 47 seconds.
