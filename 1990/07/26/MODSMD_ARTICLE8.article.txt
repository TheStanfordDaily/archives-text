# COP leaves its office empty over summer
## 
### Jill Sporleder Staff writer 
Though the Council of Presi
dents was not recalled in the
spring, their office on the second
floor of Tresidder Union re
mains empty this summer.
The current COP members
faced a difficult election, and
narrowly escaped being ousted
in a recall. Sixty-three percent
of the students voting chose to
recall the slate, but two-thirds
of the vote was needed to re
move the slate from office.
During the time of the recall
election, the COP members cir
culated flyers urging voters not
to recall them because there
would be no COP to work for
the students during the sum
mer, Orientation and early fall.
None of the COP members is
in the immediate Stanford area,
but there is a number where
they can be reached posted on
their office door.
Torrence Boone, Financial
Manager of the ASSU, ex
plained, "The job is only
part-time during the summer.
We've budgeted for a maximum
of 20 hours per week for the
council as a whole."
Though the ASSU has allotted
$2,000 in salaries for the COP
during the summer, the mem
bers are not in the area, there
fore, they will not receive the
money.

Goodwin Liu, who is working
in San Francisco, plans to come
to campus weekly to check on
things in the office. He will be
paid an hourly wage, says
Boone.
The controversy surrounding
the election began when the
Elections Commission decided
not to count the 275 write-in
votes in the total. If these votes
had been counted, the current
slate would not have had a
majority of the votes, and a run
off election would have oc
curred.
Boone says that although the
COP traditionally has at least
one member on campus during
the summer, the recall election
forced the current COP mem
bers to change their summer
plans.
Liu is working for California
Tomorrow, a non-profit ad
vocacy group that deals with
multicultural issues.
Liu reports that his fellow
COP members are outside the
Bay Area, with Jamie Green in
Los Angeles, Ingrid Nava in
Washington D.C. and Jay
Tucker in New York.
Boone said that although
Green is not in the area, "she's
been really good about calling
in to take care of administrative
details and giving me projects
to research."
