## 
### John Cuerva Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
The Foothills rape suspect re
mains at large despite a barrage
of calls to the police. Several
sightings of supicious-looking
individuals in dorms have left
residents and staff uneasy.
Last week in Madera House
in Wilbur Hall, a female resident
showering on the all-female sec
ond floor heard someone pound
ing on the locked bathroom
door, according to Elizabeth
Howton, the resident assistant
in Madera.
A man demanded to be let
into the women's bathroom, but
left after the woman refused to
open the door. Shortly after that,
the woman opened the door to
see the police running down the
hall, Howton said. No residents
saw the man, and because the

police did not find him, they do
not know whether he fits the
rape suspect's description.
The Madera incident came
soon after a man fitting the rape
suspect's description was
spotted in Trancos.
Madera and Trancos are not
the only dorms to report sight
ings of suspicious individuals.
According to George Cuevas, the
night assistant at Theta Delta
Chi, on July 6, a man was seen
climbing a tree in an attempt
to gain entry to the house.
Theta Delta Chi houses high
school students participating in
the Summer Institute for Lead
ership and Computer Aware
ness.
Cuevas said that on July 6, a
student opened the curtains of
his window to find a man
staring into his room. The
frightened student immediately
informed Cuevas, who called the
police. The police came and
searched the premises but found
nobody.
In Arroyo House, a man who
has been expelled from Univer
sity housing harassed two
female residents July 16 and 17,
coming by their room late at
night and making jokes about
his resemblance to the rape
suspect, according to Arroyo RA
Matt Eldridge. The man, whose
first name is Ali, has been
barred from the dormitory areas
and police and residents have
been alerted.
Another spotting occured July
19 in the Crothers Memorial
lounge, according to Stanford
Police Sergeant Christopher
Lefferts. A man fitting the des
cription of the rape suspect
stared at a woman seated in the
lounge, making her so uncom
fortable that she left and called
the police. By the time the police

arrived, the suspect had fled.
There were also unconfirmed
reports of a sighting of the rape
suspect in Otero the week of
July 9.
On Friday evening, Residence
Deans Jack Chin and Juan Yni
quez called a meeting with all
Wilbur RAs. According to
Yniguez, the meeting was held
primarily to "exchange informa
tion and dispel rumours," as
well as to provide safety tips.
The meeting was held Friday
night in order to make sure
everybody knew what was going
on before the weekend came, he
said.
Yniguez and Chin went over
the Thursday incident, warning
the RAs to be cautious and
aware of strangers in the dorms.
According to Yniguez, security
measures should be maintained
at all times. Specifically, all
dorm doors and first-floor win
dows should remain locked at
all times.
Women should avoid shower
ing alone in unlocked bath
rooms. Staff and residents
should notify the police via 911
immediately if they see anybody
suspicious.
When asked whether people
in his dorm are afraid, Eldridge
said, "the women are con
cerned," but not necessarily
afraid.
Monica Martinez, an RAin

Trancos, said her residents, stu
dents participating in Stanford's
high school program, are not as
fearful as they were the night
of the July 16 incident when an
individual resembling the rape
suspect was spotted on the first
floor of the dorm.
Martinez said some of her
young residents do not believe
such a serene place as Stanford
can be dangerous. Martinez
noted that this naivete could be
harmful and that women should
be cautious.
