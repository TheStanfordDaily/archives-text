# Conklin's statement

### 
Many people have questions concern
ing events of June 24 which have been
widely reported in the press. According
ly, I have prepared the following des
cription.
My summer vacation began on Satur
day, June 23. Around noon the next day,
as I was packing to go out of state, I
came across a small plastic vial about
the size of a perfume sample. The vial
contained a small amount of very old
cocaine (at least nine years old). It had
turned up several days before when my
husband of 12 years, as part of the proc
ess of moving out and getting a divorce,
was cleaning out a closet. Impulsively,
I decided to use what was in the vial.
Moments later, I began to feel ex
tremely dizzy and short of breath. Within
a few minutes, the symptoms were so
severe that I was sure I was poisoned
and dying. I struggled to the front door
and unlocked it, retrieved the vial from
the trash and threw it on to a table
where paramedics would be able find it,
dialed 911, spoke a few words, and lost
consciousness. Palo Alto paramedics and
police responded, treated me at the scene,
and took me to the Stanford Hospital
emergency room. Police cited me at the
hospital for a misdemeanor, being under
the influence of a narcotic.
The incident has raised questions
about my experience with cocaine. On
infrequent occasions in the past, I had
tried it. The most recent time was over
nine years ago. I never used it in the
presence of students, or at work, or
anywhere on campus. 1 never provided
it to students or had it provided to me
by them. None of this is intended to
mitigate my actions of June 24, but
merely is an answer to questions that
may have occurred to some who have
heard about what happened.
I deeply regret what I did. It has
brought grief to my family, friends and

colleagues, and to Stanford itself. I have
devoted my professional life to serving
students and the broader Stanford com
munity, and to see the harm 1 have done
with this one act is almost more that I
can bear. As 1 often encourage students
to do, I have sought the help of a pro
fessional counselor to understand what
happened and why, and to ensure that
it will never happen again. I am com
mitted to doing all I can to put a terrible
experience to good use, making it a
catalyst for my own and others' educa
tion. Whether in workshops, talks, pub
lications or other settings, I hope to be
able to share critically important infor
mation and insights about the dangers
of experimenting with illegal and poten
tially lethal drugs.
Through the court system, as a first
time offender I have been placed in a
diversion program. That means that I
will attend drug-related and other coun
seling sessions for the next six months
to two years. For the duration of diver
sion, the charge against me will be held
in abeyance. When I have successfully
completed requirements of the program,
the charge will be dropped. I have re
ceived a letter of formal reprimand from
the University.
1 have learned so much from this ex
perience — about the danger of even one
ingestion of an illegal drug, the obliga
tions that come with being part of some
thing bigger than oneself, the anguish
of failing in those obligations, the
humiliation of being arrested, the mean
ing of real friendship, and many other
things. The outpouring of support and
compassion from alumni, faculty, ad
ministrators and students has given me
hope that I might yet be able to redeem
myself in the eyes of others and continue
to contribute to the institution that I love
so much.
