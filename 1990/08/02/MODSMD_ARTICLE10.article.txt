# Safe sex put on hold at Wilbur
##

You're thoughtful enough to
make that long trip to the bath
room to purchase a condom.
You're fortunate enough to have
two quarters stashed. Too bad.
You still won't be able to fulfill
your safer sex responsibility —
at least not if you live in Wilbur
Hall.
My trials began in Arroyo.
After having to be let into the
bathroom because I didn't have
a key, I wandered around the
stalls trying to find the one that
held what I was looking for. How
I was I supposed to know where
it was? I'd never had any reason
to look for it.
When I finally discovered it,
I carefully read the directions
posted on the front, which told
me to place my quarters in the
slot, take hold of the knob, and
TURN TO THE RIGHT. I tried
but, despite my rather pas
sionate tug, the dispenser would
not even let me turn the dial.
So I tried the men's bathroom.
No luck there either.
I ventured out. I was on a
mission.
In my odyssey through the
eight houses of Wilbur Hall, I
found that seven had no func
tional condom machines in
either the men's or the women's
bathrooms — Okada had no ac
cessible machines at all.
A machine in Trancos ate one
of my quarters and — rather
suspiciously, I thought — had
no coin return knob.
The morning after, I talked
to Laurette Beeson, the Wilbur
Hall office coordinator. "The
company who operates the mac
hines was here last week," she
said. "The condoms in the mac
hines were past expiration, so
they took them out."
"They haven't come back,"
she added.
But no one really knows how
long the machines have been
empty. Keith Guy, director of
housing and food services, said
if there is "an unusually heavy
demand" for the condoms, the

reordering schedule can run
late.
He assured me, however, that
his staff had called that day for
a new shipment to be sent and
it is now on the way.
An exhausted supply of con
doms in the California division
of Far West, the company that

supplies prophylactics to the
Stanford vending machines,
caused a delay in the refilling
of Wilbur's empty machines, ex
plained Jan Regan, a spokes
woman for the company.
But she said a shipment
