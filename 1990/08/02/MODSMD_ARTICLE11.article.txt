# Voucher system is riddled with fraud
## 
### Jack Sparks Staff writer 
Sign up for an American
Express card and receive a
$118 round-trip travel
voucher on Northwest Air
lines. Sounds like a great way
to get to the family reunion
in Duluth, right?
Maybe. Everyone con
nected with the program —
from Stanford to Northwest's
corporate headquarters in
Minneapolis to American Ex
press' corporate headquarters
in New York — agrees there
are a lot of problems with it.
Several Stanford students
have had trouble obtaining
their vouchers from Ameri
can Express. They received
their cards and waited the
four to six weeks customary
with this program, but their
vouchers did not come.
What they had to do then
was a big hassle. The students
called American Express and
told them they had not re
ceived the vouchers. Ameri
can Express' computers
showed they were sent. The
company therefore required
that the students sign an af
fidavit saying they never re
ceived the vouchers. That
process costs time and money
— $20 to $30, although the
ASSU offers a free notary
service.
But according to Gail
Wasserman of American Ex
press' public affairs office, the
affidavit process is a way to
ensure that the company does
not "send too many" vouch
ers. Wasserman says the com
pany has had a big problem
with fraud.
According to people at the
student marketing depart
ment of American Express,
the people are very tricky and
will try everything to make
it to Aunt Susie's birthday in

Boise, Idaho. Workers told of
one man who used nine
vouchers.
But is any of this American
Express' fault? Once they
send the vouchers, isn't it up
to the post office to deliver
them? And if the wrong per
son should get a hold of a
voucher and try to use it, isn't
it up to the Northwest ticket
people to catch the crook?
Ray Chun, the station man
ager of the Stanford post of
fice, says there have not been
any complaints about the
voucher program to his office.
But he said there may be
a "fragmentary address"
problem. That is, places that
mail items in mass quantities
often have a problem with
some of those items getting
their addresses chopped off.
He estimated that about 3
percent of the mail is lost that
way.
A more glaring problem is
the Northwest ticket counter.
According to Northwest Cus
tomer Relations Supervisor
Glen Leonberger, the cus
tomer must show a photo I.D.
when using the vouchers. But
that does not always happen.
However, "It is very likely,
at least during some portion
of the trip, that the
[fraudulent traveler] will get 1
caught," he said.
The voucher program is an
attempt by American Express
to broaden its customer base.
According to Business Week
Magazine, no card makes
more money in the United
States than the American Ex
press card, but in 1988 they
were seventh on the list in
number of card holders, with
24 million.
But the biggest problem is
the one that American Ex
press is far from solving and
may never solve — making
people honest.
