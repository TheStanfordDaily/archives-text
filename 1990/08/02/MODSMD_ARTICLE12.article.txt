# Meese addresses Junior Statesmen of America
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
When former Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese addressed a
group of high school students
on campus July 26, he seemed
more like an old civics teacher
than a retired top-level bureau
crat, with his down-to-earth
demeanor and anecdotes about
Washington goings-on.
Meese spoke to the students
about the issues of the 1980s,
the Reagan era, and the decade's
historical impact. But he also
offered personal insights into
the legacy left by former Pres
ident Ronald Reagan, with
whom Meese claims to have
spent more than half of each
working day.
Instead of lecturing to a room
of gum-smacking, inattentive
adolescents, Meese, a distin
guished visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution, faced a bar
rage of penetrating questions
from the Junior Statesmen of
America, high school students
from around the nation who are
at Stanford to study government
and debate in an intensive four
week non-partisan summer pro
gram.
Meese himself graduated from
the program in 1948.
In his address, Meese called
the heavy dependence on the
cabinet system in forming policy
the most important innovation
of the Reagan presidency. Not
since President Dwight Eisen
hower has the cabinet system
been so vital to policy-making,
he said.
Meese also touched upon cur

rent events, calling Bush's nom
ination of David Souter to the
Supreme Court "probably one
of the speediest appointments"
in recent history.
He explained that the lengthy
confirmation process forced
Bush to act quickly so the empty
seat on the bench would be filled
by the time the court resumed
business in October.
Meese predicted that the Sen
ate would "try to intimidate
[and] coerce [Souter] in inap
propriate ways" into answering
questions about issues on which
he might later have to rule.
But Souter will not answer
general questions about his
views on abortion and other
timely issues, Meese said. In
stead, the judge will wait until
he has the facts of the particular
case.
In answer to students' ques
tions, Meese addressed some of
the problems which faced the
Reagan administration, includ
ing the budget deficit, the Iran-
Contra Affair and Meese's own
departure from office.
Reaganomics — the economic
theory which says the United
States can revitalize its economy
through tax deductions,
regulatory reforms and reduc
tions in federal spending — is
not responsible for the budget
deficit, Meese said. The deficit
comes as a result of excess
spending, and Reagan shares the
blame with Congress in his in
ability to cut back expenditures.
Looking back, Meese said
there were three things that
went wrong which, in turn,
caused the savings and loan

crisis: management errors in
granting loans, failures to en
sure loans that were paid back,
and illegal deals that skimmed
money out of savings and loans.
The Reagan administration
made the mistake of doing min
imal regulation, he said. Mini
mal regulation is usually sound
policy, Meese explained, but
when the government is the
guarantor of loans as well as
the regulator, it should be much

stricter.
One student asked him if he
compromised his ethics by
trying to sell defense contracts
to the government.
"Definitely no," he said, citing
his vindication by an indepen
dent counsel who reviewed his
case.
Meese also shared stories
about Reagan's personal side, re
vealing that "even President
Reagan was not above telling
lawyer jokes."

He acknowledged that Nancy
Reagan saw an astrologist —
"after [Reagan's] assassination
attempt she was grasping for
anything," he explained. But
Reagan never consulted an
astrologist, Meese said.
"I was with him one-half to
three-fourths of every working
day," Meese said.
Meese, who said he attended
almost every cabinet meeting,
also said Reagan never slept
through them.
