CRITICS of environmen
talism claim that
water, trees and clean
air are renewable. They're
wrong.
It is true that natural pro
cesses act to rejuvenate the
world's supply of water and
clean air. It is even true that
reforestation efforts are
growing. But these efforts of
nature and humankind to re
plenish the Earth are dwarfed
by the day-to-day environ
mental abuse perpetrated by
millions of people who don't
even realize what they're
doing.
The actions of today's en
vironmental villains are more
like those of the pilots of the
Enola Gay than those of the
hand-to-hand combatants of
the Middle Ages. The pilots
who dropped the bomb on
Hiroshima did not have to
look into the eyes of the thou
sands of people they killed
and, in the same way, today's
environmental villains may
not see the trees being cut
down, or the hole in the ozone
layer getting larger or the fish
and animals dying.
But almost everyone is
using up Earth's natural re
sources and testing the limits
of its life-support systems
without even thinking about
it. It is the same kind of blind
ing distance that was ushered
into modern warfare by the
atomic bomb. The disaster is
not close by. People don't see
the effects of their actions
and they are fooled into
thinking that they don't have
to live with them.
On the environmental
front, all people hear are pre
dictions of large-scale
catastrophes that they don't
really take seriously or take
the time to try to understand.
But environmental problems
are real.
From the corporate execu

tive's point of view it makes
sense to base decisions on the
balance sheet. In our econ
omy, the success or failure of
a company is judged by the
bottom line.
In a better system with
more information and less
consumer apathy, the power
of the consumer and concern
for social good could be
brought to bear on compan
ies, so a decision's effect on
the environment and people's
quality of life could have real
value. Then the effect on
quality of life would have to
become a factor in the corpo
rate executive's decision
making process.
There are a few investment
responsibility committees
which address this issue to
some degree now, but on
many fronts the quality-of
life effects of corporate
decision-making is limited
only by the social conscious
ness and conscience of the
decision-makers themselves.
Sometimes these decisions
are made by people who are
well-meaning, but misin
formed. Other times,
decision-makers are not even
well-meaning.
We at the Weekly are trying
to change the way we do
things in light of growing en
vironmental problems. The
Weekly is being published on
20-60 percent recycled paper.
From now on, The Weekly
will also be ordering recycled
paper products for all of its
office uses.
In addition, this month
staff members at The Weekly
will make a special effort to
reduce, reuse and recycle.
The Weekly has become a
waste-free zone. We challenge
University departments, local
businesses and members of
the community to join us and
help make Stanford a waste
free zone.
