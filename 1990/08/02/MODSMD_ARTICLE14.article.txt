Headline tries
to censor play
I am writing to express my
dismay at the lack of profes
sionalism shown by a headline
in The Weekly's July 12 issue:
"Musical about Galileo's life
should be silenced."
Although my company is as
sociated with the presenting
theater, our disagreement comes
not with your reviewer's cri
tique, but with the censorship
advocated in the headline.
Is The Weekly aware of the
struggle arts groups currently
face regarding de facto censor
ship by the government through
the National Endowment for the
Arts? Could your headline
writer seriously be suggesting
that any public performance —
whether to the taste of the
reviewer or not — should be
silenced?
The review thoughtfully
looked at the musical from
several aspects, citing this
original show's strengths and
weaknesses in an even-handed,

intelligent manner. At no point
did she suggest that the piece
should never have been per
formed on the stage.

Stanford must
conserve more
As Stanford begins to adopt
more water conservation meas
ures to cope with the continuing
drought, I have a suggestion
that I think is timely.
Why not install spring-loaded
handles on faucets in bathrooms
— the kind that turn themselves
off automatically? They would
probably pay for themselves,
and their installation, in a short
time in the water they would
save.
I have witnessed many in
stances in which they would
save a significant amount of
water, not the least of which are
those in which people turn on
faucets and neglect to turn them
off after they finish using them,
leaving water running until

someone else comes along and
turns it off.
Since we have no indication
that the drought will end in the
near future, it may even be time
to consider installing spring
loaded shower heads.
I have also seen a practice in
Tresidder Union that is worthy
of attention and evaluation. Em
ployees bussing tables in the
cafeteria regularly pick up doz
ens of newspapers in the process
and stuff them into trash bins,
even though half-empty news
paper recycling bins are con
veniently located nearby.
The garbage disposal and
landfill problem in Santa Clara
County is well-known and we
don't need to have any more
trees cut down than are abso
lutely necessary. In what is sup
posed to be an enlightened
community, we should be doing
all we can.
It is time for us to call on
managers to educate employees
and for all of us to make elemen
tary efforts at doing what we
can to save what environment
we have left.

Campus Drive
needs bike path
An adequate bicycle path
should be constructed alongside
the eastbound lane of Campus
Drive East between Junipero
Serra Road and the Chi Theta
House. Currently a path exists
between Junipero Serra and
Mayfield Avenue, but it is very
slim and has a precipitous drop
off the pavement.
No path or sidewalk exists
past Mayfield, which forces
bicyclists to make dangerous
merges with autos. I hope the
University addresses this issue
promptly.
