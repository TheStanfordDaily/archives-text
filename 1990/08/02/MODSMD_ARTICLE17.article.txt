## Midwesterners belong here too 
### 
I have a confession to make:
I'm a Midwesterner. I came to
California three years ago from
a smallish town in central Illi
nois called Normal. Really. And
don't think that joke you're
about to make is original: I've
heard it already.
When I first came to Stanford,
I was surrounded by intelligent
and interesting people from ex
otic, far-off, sophisticated lands,
places like Los Angeles and New
Jersey.
These were the smiling,
confident-looking people that
were pictured in those little
guidebooks We got when we were
freshmen; the pictures with the
captions that usually read, "17-
year-old synthesizes DNA after
winning six gold medals at the
Olympics: plans to major in clas
sics and micro-biology."
Had there been any pictures
of me printed at the time, they
would have shown a puzzled,
clean-cut young man and the
caption would have been some
thing like, "Guy gets pretty good
grades in high school: plans to

spend first several weeks at
Stanford getting lost."
The smiling, confident
looking people were the ones
who often stopped to give me
directions while they were on
their way to water-polo practice
or bionics lab.
I soon learned that being Mid
western was a serious hindrance
to becoming suave and self
confident like all of those people
from the Coast (either one) who
seemed to know what they were
doing.
Whenever I got into a discus
sion with somebody about the
finer things — those sophisti
cated topics that I had come out
to California to discuss, like
Truth, Beauty or Foreign Films
— and through some error on
my part let slip my mid-
American origins, there would
be a decided pause in the con
versation, and the subject would
suddenly shift to baseball or
commodities futures.
I suppose they were only
trying to make me feel more at
home, but it was somewhat em

barrassing to have people as
sume that coming from the
middle of a land-locked state
meant Heidigger was beyond my
grasp.
Faced with such resistance, I
began trying to disguise my
background. But now — a pair
of Birkenstocks and several
funny haircuts later — I begin
to feel like I've betrayed some
thing. Sure, I can slip into the
most pretentious of conversa
tions with ease ... but at what
cost?
Perhaps it is only a healthy
dose of romanticism that makes
me pine for those green flatlands
of my childhood. But in this
little niche of multiculturalism
and diversity, it seems a bit
ironic (a word I didn't use until
I came here) that my own cul
tural roots — who I was and
where I came from — had to
be killed.
