# Former Daily multicultural editor bids farewell
## 
### 
Today is my last day at Stan
ford.
After eight years on campus,
I am leaving to work with Public
Advocates, a public interest law
firm and advocacy organization,
on a project designed to turn
around low-achieving schools in
the San Francisco school dis
trict.
This is a day that many people
— my mom and a host of
creditors included — thought
would never come. But it has.
I leave proud of what people
of conscience and conviction
have accomplished and confi
dent in the institutional direc
tion of the University. From the
anti-apartheid movement to the
Western Culture struggle to the
multiculturalism movement, we
affected campus debate and
helped shape Stanford's agenda.
The issues of multicul
turalism, equality and social re
sponsibility are now high on the
University's agenda. This was

not the case when I first arrived
— a clueless freshman from
Cleveland — in 1982.
The most significant develop
ment at Stanford of the 1980s
was the stimulation in the social
conscience of a generation of
young people. Long before most
Americans had ever heard of
Nelson Mandela, we joined our
brothers and sisters in 1985 in
putting our bodies on the line
in support of the South African
freedom struggle.
We unleashed public service,
volunteering ana political ac
tion, and, in doing so, provided
a shining alternative and a bea
con of hope during the dark days
of the Reagan regime.
The rest of the country is now
acknowledging the leadership
role we have played. In Time
magazine's cover story on Amer
ica in the 21st century, Stanford
was the one school they cited as
an example of an institution
making adjustments to prepare

its students for the future.
This is a special place — a
truly international and multi
cultural community where
young people can learn about
the world and emerge as aware
and active citizens. In its cen
tennial year and beyond, Stan
ford can play a leadership role
in a rapidly changing world.
Extending an invitation to
Mandela and playing host to
Gorbachev are just a couple of
examples of how we can play a
useful and constructive role in
furthering social progress. Our
position of prestige and influ
ence gives us both an opportu
nity and a challenge to make a
difference.
In the process of streamlining,
we must be careful not to cut
away people and programs that
are vital to our institution. I am
concerned about the possibility
of losing workers at Tresidder
— and elsewhere — who have
faithfully served Stanford for

years.
As we seek to navigate the
unpredictable waters of the
19905, we would do well to in
volve more people of color in
helping to guide the institution.
Historically locked out of soci
ety, people of color displayed
during the Civil Rights
movement a humanistic and
embracing vision of a better so
ciety.
I saw a glimpse of the unifying
power of the communities of
color at the April reception for
Justice and Hope, my book on
the Black Student Union. At
that gathering, the entire Stan
ford family — from students of
color to staff to workers to trus
tees — came out and sat to
gether as equals.
What bound those sometimes
conflicting constituencies to
gether was solidarity with the
BSU's vision of a community
based on genuine equality, re
spect and justice.

Over the past eight vears, we
have been through many
struggles — the BSU's African
History Committee (Kusema
Ukweli), the '84 and '88 Jackson
campaigns, the Free South
Africa movement, Western Cul
ture and UCMI, to name a few.
I want to extend my love and
appreciation to everyone who
participated in and supported
those efforts and who, at any
point along the way, has lent
me a helping hand or a word of
advice. Too numerous to list,
you know who you are.
Together, we have ushered in
a new era. I'm sure our paths
will cross again as we continue
to travel toward a better future.
Don't worry about me. I will
be an informed and active
alumnus; I plan to write more
consistently for publication; and
San Francisco isn't that far
away. You'll be hearing from me.
