## Winding through Napa Valley 
### Sophie Romillat 
I am French, I am *21 years
old and I love wine. Because of
these things, I went to Napa
Valley with the idea of learning
about California winemaking
while having fun. And I did.
I had a great time — and
without spending too much
money. The quality and the di
versity of the wines surprised
me. I strongly recommend going
— especially now, while the
campus is empty and there is
little else to do. If you don't
want to be bored this summer,
come along!
Let's start this tour at the
Hess Collection near the town
of Napa. First of all, the archi
tecture is absolutely beautiful:
Donald Hess — the owner, a
Swiss entrepreneur — has
remodeled the two historic stone
buildings, originally built in
1903. The mix of contemporary
and old architecture at this
winery is comparable to its
winemaking practices: tradi
tional methods with modern

adaptations.
Wine tasting here costs $2.50.
The white wine (Chardonnay)
is light and pleasant, but the
red one (Cabernet Sauvignon)
is quite astringent due to its
youth.
What makes this winery even
more special is the art exhibit
that contains paintings and
sculptures by contemporary Eu
ropean and American artists.
Your next stop must be the
Peju Winery, on the way to
Saint-Helena. The owner, Tony
Martin, will make you feel at
home.
Unfortunately, the wine is not
as good as one would hope. In
my opinion, wine has to be aged
for several years. However,
other people think 1988 Char
donnay and 1982 Cabernet are
good enough to win awards, as
they did at the Reno West Coast
Competition. And, the 1986 Peju
Cabernet was voted "the best in
the region" at the California
State Fair. Go and decide for
yourself.
Now, let's talk about Califor
nia champagne. The owners of
Schramsberg Champagne invite
you to visit their cellars (by ap
pointment only). You should —
it is really interesting. There,
you will learn all about specific
winemaking techniques.

This winery is beautiful, with
a charming garden and an in
formative exhibit room full of
pictures and articles about the
famous champagne. One of the
interesting tidbits this room
presents is that the wine has
been served at important inter
national meetings between the
United States and the Soviet
Union.
Although they will not let you
taste their champagne, if you
can afford it, you should buy a
bottle of "Blanc de Noirs",
which is rare and really worth
the expense (about $20).
On your way back to Napa,
you should stop by the Christian
Brothers Winery. There is a tour
every 15 minutes during the
summer. The female tour guides
are entertaining, and they ex
plain the Christian Brothers his
tory and just about everything
about their winemaking.
According to their brochure,
"At the Christian Brothers,
winemaking is an art, blended
with advanced technology." The
use of genuine French oak bar
rels reflects this commitment.
The effect of wood aging on wine
flavor is one of the most impor
tant aspects of winemaking and
also the least understood.
After you have learned about
the tradition of Christian Broth
ers, you will be able to taste
their wine (for free!). They will
train you in the art of wine ap
preciation. You must consider
appearance, smell, taste, overall
impression, etc.
If you are not tipsy by now,
you may want to finish your
tour at the Beringer Winery. It
is a nice place and very close to
Christian Brothers. The tour
begins every 30 minutes and in
cludes a walk on the beautiful
grounds, a little historical lesson
and a cellar visit.
After the tour, you can taste
wine in the wonderful house of
the founder. If you know how
to pronounce Gewurztraminer,
they will let you taste it. I am
sure you will enjoy this wine,
which was the best of all I tasted
in Napa Valley.
By now, you may not be able
to walk a straight line, so you
should take a nap before driving
back home. Do not forget to eat
something between visits. Have
fun!
