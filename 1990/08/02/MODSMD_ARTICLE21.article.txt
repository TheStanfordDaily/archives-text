# 'Tempest' production showcases best of Shakespeare
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Shakespeare's "The Tempest" is a play
that unites all of his talents as a
playwright, including a clear understand
ing of human behavior, dynamic charac
ters, beautiful verse, political intrigue
and elements of both comedy and tragedy.
Set on an enchanted island, "The
Tempest" engages our imaginations and
asks us to accept magic and illusion as
everyday occurrences.
The diversity of elements and potential
for creativity in this work intrigued Stan
ford doctoral student David Saltz,
causing him to choose "The Tempest"
as his final project.
Saltz is an intense and energetic young
director who received his undergraduate
degree at Yale, where his first production
was "Julius Caesar." He leans toward
the avant garde as well as the classics,
and last year directed a successful version
of "Marat Sade" on campus. He prefers
scripts that "play with our ideas of what
theater is and what it can do," rather
than "kitchen sink naturalistic plays."

To him, the most exciting aspect of
directing is working with actors and
making every single moment specific. He
claims that "digging out the dramatic
interaction between characters, what's
happening through the lines, between the
lines, and why a certain character needs
to say what they're saying at that mo
ment and what the effect of it is," is
extremely important in a Shakespearean
production.
Saltz is inspired by "The Tempests"
assortment of characters, especially
Prospero, the overthrown Duke of Milan
who lands on the deserted island and
discovers magical powers there. In ex
ploring the twofold aspects of Prospero
that make him a fascinating character,
Saltz says there's a fine line between
making Prospero strictly "a saint figure,
or a pure villain who exploits poor
Caliban."
"Prospero is one of the most intrigu
ing, wonderful, and also likable charac
ters in Shakespeare. He's actually
neurotic and that's what makes him so
funny," professes Saltz. "It's very clear

that he's insecure and desperately cling
ing to the sense of power. My sense of
Prospero is that in a lot of ways he's
like a child desperate for approval and
for the sense that he has some control
over the world."
The characters in"The Tempest" show
varying qualities of intelligence. Prospero
is very bright in terms of book learning,
but shows a sorry lack of pragmatism.
In a Machiavellian sense Antonio,
Prospero's usurping brother, is the
shrewdest character. Gonzalo, an honest
old councilor, is incredibly pedantic and
is constantly being made fun of, but on
the other hand, he is always right. And
Caliban is the "wild child" â€” super
stitious, grounded in the here and now,
and unable to think in abstractions at all.
One of the trickiest obstacles to staging
"The Tempest" has been how to deal
with Ariel, Prospero's airy spirit, and
the other fairies. The text supports the
idea that Ariel is not a corporeal figure,
though some productions make the mis
take of treating Ariel as a human being.
Saltz solves this dilemma by turning

Ariel into "pure sound and light," and
is using a kaleidoscope light to produce
a shimmering effect along with a device
that changes the pitch of Ariel's voice.
Sometimes Ariel's pitch is higher so he
sounds like a woman; sometimes it's low
and horrifying, as in the scene when he
becomes a harpy and frightens the
nobles. The music associated with Ariel
is written by Stanford graduate Tom
Linblade, who chose a contemporary,
jazzy style.
The components of a marvelous script,
a good cast, original music and creative
special effects are coming together for
tonight's opening of "The Tempest."
When it's all over, Saltz will continue to
work on his dissertation on the theory
of acting, a chapter of which is being
published in the Fall 1990 issue of "The
Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism."
"The Tempest" runs Aug. 2 through
Aug. 12 in the Little Theater. Perform
ances are at 8:00 p.m. Thursday through
Sunday, with 2:00 matinees on weekends.
