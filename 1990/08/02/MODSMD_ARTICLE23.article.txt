# Escape from El Camino
## China Valley's cuisine offers a pleasant surprise 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
More often than not, a yearning for
Chinese food means a visit to the con
crete jungle that is El Camino Real.
The recent opening of China Valley
Restaurant, however, has provided a wel
come diversion from the congested life
style along the royal road.
China Valley is nestled among the res
taurants and boutiques that dot the
newly-revitalized Los Altos.
China Valley's menu offers a broad
spectrum of Hunan and Szechuan
cuisine, including several vegetarian
dishes.
From the very first appetizer to the
final entree, one theme became apparent.
Both the meats — whether beef, chicken
or shrimp — and the vegetables were
very fresh.
My companion and I started with the
shredded chicken salad ($5.50). Our
waiter presented the familiar bed of
tossed lettuce, carrots, cucumbers and
cilantro, topped with strips of warm,
breaded chicken.
The chicken was pleasantly moist and
the vegetables chopped to a manageable
size while still remaining recognizable.

The only negative was the dressing, a
dark broth handicapped by a bit too much
sweetness.
The pot stickers we sampled ($3.95)
were standard, with the exception that
the pork filling was remarkably fresh.
Of the three entries we selected, the
kung pao prawns ($7.50) was the most
pleasing. The prawns were prepared in
a light batter, combined with fresh
chunks of bell pepper and water
chestnuts, and mixed in a hot and spicy
Szechuan sauce.
Chef/owner Jack Chen manages to bal
ance flavors well, so that neither the
spicy sauce nor the fresh prawns over
power one another. Reminiscent of the
chicken salad, the moo-shu chicken
($6.95) turned out to be a standard mix
ture of very fresh vegetables and suc
culent chicken. Both the pancakes and
the duck sauce complemented the mix
ture well. In fact, the duck sauce was
quite delicious.
Though the Mongolian beef ($6.25)
was very tender, it was somewhat dis
appointing. The dark sauce lacked zing,
especially in comparison to the sauce
dressing the kung pao prawns.
China Valley is located at 355 State
Street in Los Altos.
