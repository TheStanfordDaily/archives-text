# Mumtaj is a dining adventure

Mountain View never seemed very
far away before. But as soon as I set
foot in Mumtaj Restaurant at 126
Castro Street, I was suddenly a
stranger in a strange land.
Like all great explorers, I took along
a trusty guide — my freshman room
mate, who just happens to be from
Bombay. With an adventurous spirit
and anxious taste buds, I began my
trek through this foreign world of In
dia cuisine.
We got a feel for the country as
soon as we entered through the purple
arched doorway and sat amidst the
dark colors of Indian tapestries and
murals. There were so many people
dining — Americans and Indians alike
— that I would recommend reserva
tions, especially on weekends.
A turbaned waiter brought us
menus, which are handily divided into
sections for appetizers, meats, vegeta
bles, and so on. There is even a division
for vegetarians. And, just in case you
can't read Hindi, each dish is con
veniently explained in English.
We started of with an assortment
of appetizers, your typical finger foods

done Indian-style. These tasted far dif
ferent than what one would expect
from reading their descriptions.
Pakoras, which are pieces of
cauliflower (or other vegetables) fried
in a chickpea batter, are pretty basic.
However, samosas, which are pockets
of mashed potatoes and peas also
dipped in the chickpea batter, had an
interesting spicy orange taste, which
was enhanced by the accompanying
chutney and hot (very hot) sauces.
My favorite of these introductory
dishes was the papadum, sliced lentil
wafers which are roasted to give them
a great texture of little bumps and
holes.
By this time my taste buds were
really aroused, and I wanted to try a
variety of dishes for my main course.
Little did I know how challenging it
would be.
Although forks are provided, Indi
ans traditionally eat by scooping their
food up with pieces of a round, soft,
flat bread called nan. (If you are really
good, you won't even get your hands
dirty!) The plain kind is delicious, but
there are also lots of other flavors like
garlic.
