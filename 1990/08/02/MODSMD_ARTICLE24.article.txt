# Mumtaj is a dining adventure
## 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
Mountain View never seemed very
far away before. But as soon as I set
foot in Mumtaj Restaurant at 126
Castro Street, I was suddenly a
stranger in a strange land.
Like all great explorers, I took along
a trusty guide — my freshman room
mate, who just happens to be from
Bombay. With an adventurous spirit
and anxious taste buds, I began my
trek through this foreign world of In
dia cuisine.
We got a feel for the country as
soon as we entered through the purple
arched doorway and sat amidst the
dark colors of Indian tapestries and
murals. There were so many people
dining — Americans and Indians alike
— that I would recommend reserva
tions, especially on weekends.
A turbaned waiter brought us
menus, which are handily divided into
sections for appetizers, meats, vegeta
bles, and so on. There is even a division
for vegetarians. And, just in case you
can't read Hindi, each dish is con
veniently explained in English.
We started of with an assortment
of appetizers, your typical finger foods

done Indian-style. These tasted far dif
ferent than what one would expect
from reading their descriptions.
Pakoras, which are pieces of
cauliflower (or other vegetables) fried
in a chickpea batter, are pretty basic.
However, samosas, which are pockets
of mashed potatoes and peas also
dipped in the chickpea batter, had an
interesting spicy orange taste, which
was enhanced by the accompanying
chutney and hot (very hot) sauces.
My favorite of these introductory
dishes was the papadum, sliced lentil
wafers which are roasted to give them
a great texture of little bumps and
holes.
By this time my taste buds were
really aroused, and I wanted to try a
variety of dishes for my main course.
Little did I know how challenging it
would be.
Although forks are provided, Indi
ans traditionally eat by scooping their
food up with pieces of a round, soft,
flat bread called nan. (If you are really
good, you won't even get your hands
dirty!) The plain kind is delicious, but
there are also lots of other flavors like
garlic.
Nan not only replaces silver
ware, it also saves an inexperi
enced tongue like mine from
burning with the spices from
the main dishes
Now for the important part
— what do these complements
actually complement?
First came a huge sizzling
platter of grilled pieces of
chicken, lamb and prawns cov
ered in a red yogurt sauce, bar
bequed, and served on a bed of
onions. Zingy, but not too spicy,
this dish was probably my fa
vorite because the meat, espe
cially the chicken, was so tender
it practically fell apart in my
mouth.
We also tried chicken tika

masala, chicken in a red sauce
heated up with the Indian spice
masala. This dish is hard to
describe, but delicious to eat.
We couldn't have a complete
dinner without tasting daal, a
hearty side dish of lentils and
other vegetables and spices that,
in its many forms, is an Indian
staple.
Mumtaj is relatively
moderately priced, with each
main dish running from $4 to
$9. Though some of the portions
looked a little small to my Amer
ican sense of proportion, the
food is so rich and filling that
you will definitely not leave
hungry.
If you're tired of the same old
restaurants, and you have a
taste for a little adventure and
a lot of delicious food, brave a
new world at Mumtaj restau
rant.
