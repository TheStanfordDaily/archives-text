# 'Navy Seals' doesn't float
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Let's not beat around the
bush. "Navy Seals" is bad. I
have never felt so cheated before
in my life, and I saw the movie
for free.
I don't even want to search
through the press kit to see ex
actly how much time I wasted
watching this movie. If you are
thinking of going to see it, and
your neighbor calls over the
fence and yells, "Hey, come on
over and let's watch the grass
grow," I would give the grass
watching plan a thumbs-up.
About 15 minutes into this
movie, I realized I had seen this
film at least 5 times before and,
about 15 minutes after that, I
realized that it had been better
every other time.
I kept thinking to myself,
"The people who made this
movie must have been intelli
gent human beings. They must
have realized what they were
doing."
Positive qualities. It must
have had some good points,
right? Wrong. The movie is
about a top-secret, elite United
States military fighting force,
the Navy Seals. Michael Biehn
and Charlie Sheen star in this
"Top Gun" takeoff with Charlie
Sheen playing the careless, reck
less Tom Cruise role.
For all of Cruise's faults, he
seems like Marlon Brando when
compared to Sheen. In "Navy
Seals," Sheen's character is

poorly developed at best. There
is no closeness between any of
the characters in this movie, but
Sheen's Dale Hawkins is so bad
he can only be compared to a
piece of food you get stuck be
tween your teeth and spend two
hours trying to remove.
Matt Biehn's character James
Curran is the only ray of hope
in this movie. The character is
fair. That's it.
When an immature and ir
responsible act by Sheen's char
acter gets one of the members
of the Seal team killed, you don't
believe Sheen when he says he
cares. That's OK, though, since
you don't care about the char
acter yourself, or Sheen or any
of the Seals.

And you know the funny one
liners that usually make
retarded action-violence films
like these almost bearable? Well,
all of the one-liners in this movie
fail. All of them. It is almost
like someone tried to edit the
film so that the timing was off
on purpose, you know, to play
a joke on the audience.
I think the joke will be on the
producers of this movie. If you
have anything better to do this
summer (including sleep), don't
go see "Navy Seals." If you do
see it, I'm sorry. And if you have
seen it and thought it was OK,
call your local mental hospital
and admit yourself. There's
something wrong with you.
