# 'Quick Change' is a nice change

Just when it seemed that all the clever comedic
ruses in the world had been used up and sup
planted with the ever-so-intellectual wit of
Andrew Dice Clay, "Quick Change" opened and
restored my faith in Hollywood's laughter factory.
Starring Bill Murray, Geena Davis and Randy
Quaid, "Quick Change" tells the tale of three
people fed up with New York City. In order to
escape the Big Apple, they devise an almost per
fect plan to rob a bank and dash off to Fiji.
This scheme involves Murray's dressing up as
a clown and holding hostage all the people inside
the bank at the time of the stickup.
Already very unconventional, this caper gets
even stranger when the clown demands a helicop
ter, a tour bus, a Harley-Davidson motorcycle
and a monster truck from the police before he
releases any hostages.
You certainly wouldn't want me to give away
the manner in which he escapes the bank amidst
hundreds of police officers, so I'll just say that
it's quite surprising and funny.
Even more entertaining, however, is the "es
cape" afterward. As the trio attempts to get to
the airport to board a plane for the Caribbean,

they find that everything they are trying to leave
is impeding their progress. Everything from
Yuppie criminals that look like Barbie's boyfriend
Ken to bus drivers that won't accept a hundred
dollar bill in lieu of exact change stand in their
way.
Overall, the acting is superb in this film. In
addition to Murray's superlative effort, Davis and
Quaid deliver excellent supporting performances.
Quaid in particular finds himself in some ex
tremely amusing situations, including his frantic
verbal altercation with an Arabian cab driver
who understands no English and can only repeat
the same unintelligible phrase over and over.
Davis supplies the love interest in the movie,
who is also somewhat disillusioned by Murray's
deep infatuation with his planned felony. She is,
however, the weakest link in the film, as her
emotional relief doesn't stand up realistically
amidst the highly unlikely — but believable —
situations of which the movie is composed.
Okay, so my written translation doesn't exactly
make your sides split with laughter.
All I can say is that I urge you to see this
movie for some truly hilarious situation comedy
with great acting and witty dialogue. "Quick
Change" is well worth an hour and a half of
your time and the price of admission.
