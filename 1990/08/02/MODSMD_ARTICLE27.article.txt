# 'Innocent' offers suspense, drama

Looking for a suspenseful
movie in the sea of ac
tion/adventure summer films?
Harrison Ford's new movie,
"Presumed Innocent," is low in
action but high in drama.
Ford plays Rusty Sabich, a
prosecuting attorney assigned to
find the murderer of his col
league and former lover. The
story takes place in the fictional
Chicago-like Kindle County.
Sabich is the county's chief dep
uty district attorney. His boss,
Raymond Horgan (Brian Den
nehy) is running for re-election
against the shady Nico Delia
Guardia.
Ten days before the election,
one of the assistant district at
torneys, Carolyn (Greta
Scaachi), is brutally murdered
in her home. Horgan assigns
Sabich to find someone to pin
the murder on quickly so it
won't damage his re-election

hopes.
Sabich is incredibly upright
and moral, which makes it really
fascinating when he becomes the
chief suspect, on trial for the
murder. The prosecutor be
comes the prosecuted.
At first Ford seems stiff, cer
tainly not his dashing "Indiana
Jones" self. But then you realize
that his character is a really
straight-laced guy who takes
justice and the law very
seriously. Ford's blank expres
sions are a mask for his power
ful emotions, which explode in
the steamy flashback scenes
with Scaachi.
Scaachi as the murdered as
sistant district attorney brings
across her character's seductive
deceit. You understand exactly
why Sabich becomes obsessed
with her.
Raul Julia is marvelous as
Sandy Stern, the slick and artful
lawyer Sabich hires to defend
him. He operates on the edge

of the law, using his tricks and
insider's knowledge to manipu
late the judge and the jury. He
doesn't really know, or care, if
his client is innocent.
The movie is faithful to Scott
Turow's best-selling novel of the
same title. The part of the movie
that seems most staged, the end
ing, is the part that was
reworked from the book.
Overall, the movie gives a re
alistic glimpse into the inner
workings of a DA's office, and
the interplay with the police de
partment. The courtroom scenes
seem especially authentic, owing
both to author Turow's knowl
edge as a prosecuting attorney
and director Alan J. Pakula's
experience directing courtroom
scenes such as those in "All The
President'B Men."
A great book becomes a great
movie. Neither the book's fans
nor movie-goers will be disap
pointed with "Presumed Inno
cent."
