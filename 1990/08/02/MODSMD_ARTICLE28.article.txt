# 'Swamp Thing' is not merely muck
## 
### Warren Scherffius Staff writer 
"Sophisticated suspense" is an
often unattainable goal. How
ever, the "Swamp Thing,"
created for DC Comics in 1972
by writer Len Wein and artist
Berni Wrightson, proclaimed on
its covers that it was defined by
this very phrase and has, in the
comic form, fulfilled this prom
ise.
The story of biologist Alec
Holland's life as a muck
encrusted mutated creature
wandering the Louisiana bayou
after a chemical explosion
hurtled him into the swampy
waters surrounding his labora
tory, the tragic tale of the
Swamp Thing was the rarest of
hybrids — a genuinely scary
horror comic with a continuing
cast of characters.
Unfortunately, most people
who have heard of "Swamp
Thing" know it as a 1982 campy
cult film written and directed
by Wes Craven before he hit the
cinematic jackpot with
"Nightmare on Elm Street."
Last year's lackluster, laugh
able sequel, "Return of the
Swamp Thing," was produced
and written by "Psycho"
screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Al
though it apparently did well
enough to inspire a USA Cable
television series which debuted
last Friday night, the movie was
an incoherent mishmash of
tenuously-related scenes, unin
spired cinematography and poor
acting.
Those wondering what might
have inspired such heights of
mediocrity are in for a treat by
looking no farther than the
readily available trade paper
back "Saga of the Swamp
Thing," written by Alan Moore.
This book reprints issues 21-
27 of the series, for which it

garnered comicdom's coveted
Eagle Awards for "Best Comic
Book Series" and "Best Writer"
in 1984.
Particularly chilling is the col
lection's second storyline in
which a group of autistic
children is menaced by "The
Monkey King," a shape-shifting
demon that preys on its victim's
individual fears. In the midst of
this, the Swamp Thing struggles
with the revelation that he is
not and never was Alec Holland,
while his best friend Matt Cable
slowly bleeds to death in a car
wreck while being taunted by
an alcohol-induced hal
lucinatory creature.
Moore, author of "The Watch
men" and"V for Vendetta," is
arguably the best writer the
medium has produced, and his
words are brought to eerie life
by intricate gnarled shapes and
feathered shadings from John
Totleben's pen. Together, these
men, with pencillers Stephen
Bissette and Rick Veitch, create
a moodily poetic yet stunningly
visceral tapestry of terror.
While the paper stock and
color separation process used in
printing the trade paperback
replace the subtle, muted
linework and tinting of the
original books with an often
garish explosion of primary
colors and muddy inks, the cover
price of $12.95 makes the book
a more affordable option than
locating the hard-to-find
original seven issues, command
ing upwards of $70 for the same
package.
Completists will be pleased to
note that a companion volume
"Swamp Thing: Love and
Death," due out in October, will
reprint issues 28-34 of the series
and include the very first Wein-
Wrightson "Swamp Thing"
story from "House of Secrets
#92."
