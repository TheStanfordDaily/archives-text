## Three juniors lead U.S. to Goodwill bronze 
### Shana McNally 
Stanford University athletes
are doing their best to ensure
the United States wins its fair
share of medals at the 1990
Goodwill Games in Seattle.
Three Cardinal baseball mem
bers are a prime example of this
determination, despite the
team's defeat at the hands of
eventual winner, Cuba.
Current or former Stanford
athletes also have fared well in
women's basketball and volley
ball, men's volleyball and water
polo.
In spite of losses to Cuba and
Japan, the U.S. baseball team
advanced to the medal round in
Tacoma with wins against the
Soviet Union and Mexico on
Tuesday the team defeated
Canada 10-4 to clinch a bronze
medal beating Canada Tuesday
10-4 to clinch the bronze.
Gearing up for the World
Championships next month in
Edmonton, Alberta, their record
on this world tour now stands
at 20-9.
Cardinal first baseman David
McCarty is leading the way for
the Americans, hitting well over
.400.
Against Cuba Tuesday, a 16-2
loss, McCarty drove in Univer
sity teammate Troy Tallman in
the top of the seventh inning.
Despite this, the game was
called in the middle of the
seventh inning because of the
"mercy rule" that stops the
game two innings early if a team
has a 10-run lead.
The main source of anguish
for the U.S. was 22-year-old
amateur sensation Omar
Linares, who was 4-for-5 with
four doubles, one single, three
RBI and two runs scored.
The tell-tale inning for the
Cubans, winners of 19 of the
last 22 world championships,
was the second where they sent

13 batters to the plate, produc
ing seven runs.
Japan also played spoiler for
the Americans, defeating them
7-6 Saturday in 14 innings.
McCarty led the way with a 4-
for-5 performance of his own
that produced a run and two
RBI off a double and a home
run.
McCarty also came through
Sunday in a 15-2 victory over
Mexico. In that contest he had
a triple, two runs scored and an
RBI. Stanford teammate Roger
Burnett added a run to ensure
another "mercy rule"-called
game for the Americans.
The U.S. opened the Goodwill
Games with an historic contest
against baseball newcomers
from the Soviet Union. Despite
the successful execution of a
double play, the Soviets fell to
their more experienced counter
parts 17-0.
In contrast to the baseball
team's busy schedule, the U.S.
women's basketball team had a
week of rest in Hawaii before
traveling to Seattle. They ar
rived in Hawaii after winning
the world championship in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
The task facing them in
Seattle also should be easy with
the absence of perennial powers
China, Cuba and Yugoslavia.
The rest and the partial lack
of competition should help them
in their quest for gold that
began Tuesday night with a 94-
70 victory over South Korea.
South Korea, despite the play
of five-foot four-inch guard Choi
Kyung-Hee who had three five
pointers and 27 points, could not
handle the Americans' power
and quickness. The U.S. went
on a 20-3 first-half run and saw
South Korea get no closer than
10 points the rest of the game.
June graduate Jennifer Azzi
is a starter for the Americans
and had seven points and a

team-high nine assists. Senior
Sonja Henning came off the
bench to score one bucket.
Last night the Americans
overcame a 14-point first-half
defecit to defeat the Soviet
Union 86-78.
The women's volleyball team,
unlike their basketball counter
parts, got off to a slow start in
the tournament last week. They
fell to the powerful Soviet team
then suffered a tough loss to an
unspectacular Canadian team.
But led by team captain and
1986 graduate Kim Oden, the
women finished pool play with
a solid victory over Brazil. The
U.S. women then defeated both
Cuba and Japan to take fifth
place.

Men's volleyball opened Good
will Games play with a 3-1 vic
tory over France Monday.
THiesday the U.S. recovered
from a bad start to defeat a fine
Soviet squad in five games, win
ning the quick-scoring fifth
game by a very decisive 15-6
margin. Jon Root, a 1987 grad
uate, has been a starter since
the 1988 Olympics and played
a key role for the U.S. in the
win.
The turning point for the
Americans, however, came when
Scott Fortune, a 1989 graduate,
and USC senior Bryan Ivie were
inserted. They entered the
match with the Americans trail
ing 13-4 in the second game and
led the U.S. to 11 unanswered

points and the game.
In water polo, former Stan
ford great Craig Klass was one
of four Americans to score two
goals in an 11-5 U.S. victory
over Cuba that gave the team
fifth place. He also scored the
winning goal the 4-3 win over
Italy that got the U.S. into the
fifth-place game.
The Americans fell to the So
viet Union (7-6), Australia (9-8)
and Spain (10-7) in pool play
before posting the two wins for
fifth.
Klass added two goals in de
feating the Australians while
former Stanford players Eric
Fischer and David Imbernino
had two and one, respectively.
