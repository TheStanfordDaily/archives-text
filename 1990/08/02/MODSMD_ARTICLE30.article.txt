# Cardinal swimmers earn trip to world championship meet
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Competing in the world championships is
the goal of every aspiring athlete. But while
the goal was the same, Stanford swimmers
found several different ways to accomplish it
this week.
After the first four days of the U.S. Swim
ming Long Course National Championships,
Cardinal athletes had found many different
ways to secure spots on the U.S. team that
will compete at the world championships next
January in Australia.
The long course championships, which run
through Saturday at the University of Texas
Swimming Center, double as a selection meet
for the world championships, where Stanford
Coach Richard Quick will coach the U.S. squad.
The swimmers with the top two times in each
event recorded at either the long course meet
or at the Goodwill Games last week comprise
the U.S. team.
Through last night incoming freshman Sum
mer Sanders, sophomore Janet Evans, junior
Jeff Rouse and graduated senior Jill Johnson
had all earned their way onto the team. All
but Rouse had the advantage of competing at
both meets and the four women all posted
good times in their top events at the Goodwill
Games.
Johnson had the top U.S. time after placing
fourth in the 200-meter breaststroke in Seattle,
then grabbed her spot in the world champion
ships by placing second in Texas Monday night.
Both she and Mary Ellen Blanchard, who beat
her by .27 seconds Monday, swam faster in
Texas than Johnson did in Seattle and will
represent the U.S. on the basis of those faster

times.
Evans, meanwhile, will likely swim four
events in Australia. She began the meet in
Texas by placing second to Erika Hansen in
the 400-meter IM, but Hansen's winning time
was slower than those recorded by both
Sanders and Evans at the Goodwill Games.
Thus Sanders and Evans will compete for the
U.S. in that event.
Evans rebounded from that defeat to set a
1990 world best in the 200-meter freestyle, an
event she does not normally swim, the follow
ing night, and handily won the 400-meter free
style Tuesday.
On the men'B side, junior Jeff Rouse swam
the third-fastest time in U.S. history to win
the 200-meter backstroke Tuesday. Rouse, who
was ranked No. 1 in the world for 1989 in
the 100-meter backstroke, swam the 200 in
2:00.13 and will join schoolmates Evans and
Johnson in Australia in four months.
Incoming freshman Derek Weatherford just
missed making the world championships team
in the 200-meter backstroke by placing fourth
in that event and placed fifth in the 400-meter
IM in Texas. Junior Alex Kostich finished
eighth in the latter event.
Janel Jorgensen, the Goodwill Games champ
in the 100-meter butterfly, discovered she has
mononucleosis and did not compete in Texas.
Unfortunately for her, three swimmers beat
her Goodwill Games time in Texas last night,
causing her to miss a trip to the world cham
pionships by .12 seconds.
Also last night, Sanders finished third in
the 100-meter butterfly, just missing a world
championships spot for that event. Incoming
freshman Pam Minthom was fifth.
