# Kemp brings hope, not money to E. Palo Alto
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Jack Kemp went to East Palo Alto,
bringing a message of hope for the
troubled community three miles from
Stanford — but no promise of financial
aid.
The secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development spoke
at a press conference Saturday morning
at City Hall, after touring East Palo Alto
encouraging youths involved in local
sports programs.
Although he pledged to create a million
new homeowners in the United States
by 1992, Kemp made no specific guaran
tees of financial support for East Palo
Alto.
"I didn't bring any money," Kemp said,
when asked about immediate results. "I
was here to fact-find." However, he added
it would be a "matter of days, not
months" before the city's application for
funding would be processed.
A football-star-turned-politician, Kemp
was joined by congressmen from Stanford
and San Mateo, local politicians, business
leaders, former NFL players and mem
bers of the Stanford football team to
urge a unified effort throughout the Pen
insula to "make democracy work in East
Palo Alto."
According to San Mateo County Su
pervisor Tom Nolan, East Palo Alto res
idents have fewer job opportunities and
less spending money than their neighbors
in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.

Nolan said that while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto and Menlo Park far
exceeds the number of residents, East
Palo Alto contains around 2,000 jobs for
about 25,000 residents. In addition, while
the two more affluent communities
generate between $180 and $200 per
capita in annual sales tax, East Palo Alto
generates $7 per capita each year.
"It is a disgrace to allow inner cities
to decay so that people can no longer
live in decency," Kemp said to enthusi
astic applause. His message of self
empowerment for the people involved two
steps: creating more low-income housing
and encouraging private entrepreneur
ship.
"His enthusiasm is infectious," said
Nolan, who after the conference de
scribed Kemp as a "high-level cheerleader
[for East Palo Alto]." Nolan said he had
hope for a major grant proposal for the
city, adding "if he [Kempl is not able to
produce .. . lots of people will want to
know why not."
However, others were skeptical about
real changes in East Palo Alto despite
Kemp's message of unity and hope.
"I want to see results," said Barbara
Mouton, a local activist and East Palo
Alto city council member. Kemp was
visibly irritated during the press confer
ence when Mouton suggested Kemp was
ignoring city residents' concerns in favor
of "outsiders" from the press.
"His reaction seemed to me like the
same old boys' network we had before,"
said Mouton.
