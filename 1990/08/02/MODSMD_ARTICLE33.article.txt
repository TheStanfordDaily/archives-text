# Med School to release plan to diversify faculty
## 
### Ram Duriseti Staff writer 
School of Medicine Dean David Korn
is expected to release a list of recom
mendations soon after studying three
committee reports aimed at diversifying
house staff and faculty at the Medical
School.
The committees, established by Korn
in response to the 1989 University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report, have
been at work since January.
While the Medical School maintains a

strong minority representation in its stu
dent body, some minority students feel
there is active discrimination at the level
of Stanford's residency programs and
postdoctoral and faculty appointments.
In June, a representative of the mi
nority students read a letter expressing
their concerns to the Faculty Senate.
The letter, written by second-year med
ical student Fernando Lopez, president
of the Stanford Raza Medical Association,
said racism is "openly supported, nur
tured and unashamedly practiced" at the
Medical School.

In particular, Lopez expressed his con
cerns over the low minority representa
tion in residency programs, postdoctoral
programs and the faculty.
While minorities represent approxi
mately 20 percent of the student body
at the Medical School, the current house
staff and faculty representations are
much lower, at 7 percent and 2 percent
respectively.
Although the statistical significance of
these figures is questionable, due to the
extremely small sample size, there is a
noticeable difference between minority

and non-minority success rates among
Stanford residency applicants.
Korn has said he does not believe ad
missions statistics support the allega
tions of discrimination.
The students contend there is a defi
nite interest among Stanford minority
students in staying at the University, but
they are not awarded positions.
Senior Assoc. Dean of Education and
Student Affairs Charlotte Jacobs pointed
out that minority composition of the
Medical Center's house staff is
similar to the national average.
But she acknowledged there
is room for improvement. "The
problem at the Stanford School
of Medicine is that it's not as
multicultural and certainly not
as optimal as needed for mutual
understanding," she said.
"The students are not asking
that we hire people solely on
consideration of race," Jacobs
said. "I think the students feel
that if there is a group of can
didates in which all are equally
qualified, the final selection
should be made in consideration
of ethnicity — and I support
this totally."
However, Jacobs added that
not everyone is as committed to
affirmative action in postdoc
toral and house staff selection.
"We need to raise awareness,"
she said, adding, "There are
some faculty here committed to
affirmative action who are frus
trated with the low number of
minority applicants to their par
ticular program."
Certain programs don't even
ask for racial status or photo
graphs, according to Jacobs.
Therefore, in some cases, the
applicant has no explicit oppor
tunity to reveal his or her eth

nicity.
Currently, said Jacobs, at least
four new minority faculty are
in line for appointment.
The committees' reports are
in review by Korn, and his rec
ommendations are due soon. Ac
cording to Jacobs, Korn is
intensely committed to affirma
tive action and has asked the
committee for action-oriented
suggestions.
Some students have expressed
irritation at being "committeed
to death." Jacobs said she recog
nizes this frustration, but the
students' perception of inaction
may be a product of "lack of
appreciation for University
process."
"The dean can set the tone.
He can influence the faculty's
decisions, but he doesn't control
the actual process of house stall
selection," Jacobs said. "Much
of the student frustration is
from having too many groups
tell them it's not their province.
Regardless, the dean's report
will be action-oriented.
"Not everyone will be happy
with the recommendations,"
Jacobs acknowledged. "Some
students may feel that much
more radical measures are nec
essary. Whatever the reaction,
though, the dialogue must con
tinue. I appreciate the intense
student commitment — it keeps
me aware."
