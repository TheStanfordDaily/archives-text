# Med School to release plan to diversify faculty

### Ram Duriseti Staff writer 
School of Medicine Dean David Korn
is expected to release a list of recom
mendations soon after studying three
committee reports aimed at diversifying
house staff and faculty at the Medical
School.
The committees, established by Korn
in response to the 1989 University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report, have
been at work since January.
While the Medical School maintains a

strong minority representation in its stu
dent body, some minority students feel
there is active discrimination at the level
of Stanford's residency programs and
postdoctoral and faculty appointments.
In June, a representative of the mi
nority students read a letter expressing
their concerns to the Faculty Senate.
The letter, written by second-year med
ical student Fernando Lopez, president
of the Stanford Raza Medical Association,
said racism is "openly supported, nur
tured and unashamedly practiced" at the
Medical School.

In particular, Lopez expressed his con
cerns over the low minority representa
tion in residency programs, postdoctoral
programs and the faculty.
While minorities represent approxi
mately 20 percent of the student body
at the Medical School, the current house
staff and faculty representations are
much lower, at 7 percent and 2 percent
respectively.
Although the statistical significance of
these figures is questionable, due to the
extremely small sample size, there is a
noticeable difference between minority

and non-minority success rates among
Stanford residency applicants.
Korn has said he does not believe ad
missions statistics support the allega
tions of discrimination.
The students contend there is a defi
nite interest among Stanford minority
students in staying at the University, but
they are not awarded positions.
Senior Assoc. Dean of Education and
Student Affairs Charlotte Jacobs pointed
out that minority composition of the
