## Students cycle to raise awareness of hunger, poverty

writer's experiences while cy
cling across the country with
Bike-Aid.

HANNIBAL, Mo. — Midday
was approaching as I, and 19
others like me, cycled down the
road to Reno. The heat was op
pressive, but we felt liberated
when we caught sight of a sign
which read, "Bordertown: 1/2
mile," and spotted the Nevada
state line in the distance.
Passing motorists slowed to
stare at us as we threw off our
helmets and crowded around the
sign, hugging each other and
taking pictures.
I am traveling with a program
called Bike-Aid, and crossing the
Nevada border was the first
milestone of our trip — one
state down, 10 more to cross
before reaching our East Coast
destination.
Bike-Aid is an annual cross
country trek aimed at raising
awareness of the problems of
global hunger and poverty, as
well as raising money for the
Overseas Development Net
work, the sponsor of the trip.
Four of the five Bike-Aid
groups, which consist of about
20 riders each, left from West
Coast cities June 20. The fifth
began in Austin, Texas, in mid-
July, and will finish, like all the
others, in Washington, D.C., at
the end of August.
My group departed from San
Francisco, and over the nine
week trip we will cross Califor
nia, Nevada, Utah, Colorado,
Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, In
diana, Ohio, West Virginia and
Virginia before reaching our
final destination.

Like the other routes, we pass
through both small towns and
major cities, spending nights in
churches, schools, city parks,
campgrounds and occasionally
private homes.
In order to participate, each
rider is required to raise $2,000
in pledges for the Overseas De
velopment Network. Some
riders — myself included — are
still in the process of raising
funds.
The network was founded in
1983 by two brothers from
Bangladesh who attended Stan
ford and Harvard and felt U.S.
students were not adequately
educated about Third World is
sues.
The organization has chapters
at colleges across the nation
which are involved in educa
tional and fund-raising activi
ties. The money raised by
Bike-Aid and the individual
chapters is used mainly to pro
vide funds for grass-roots
community projects around the
world that meet certain criteria.
To qualify for funding, a proj
ect must be small-scale, self
sustaining and, most
importantly, initiated by the
community members them
selves. The network's
philosophy is that people best
know how to help themselves.
For instance, federal farm
policy and huge agricultural
business corporations are
threatening the way of life of
many small-scale farmers in
western Missouri. To remedy

this, citizens have created the
Missouri Rural Crisis Center,
which builds coalitions between
various farmer groups, provides
emergency assistance to family
farmers, and educates farmers
on technology and current
legislative action.
On our rest days, which come
about once a week, we volunteer
to help with such community
projects and learn more about
them.
In Salt Lake City, for example,
we hammered nails and
shoveled dirt on the construc
tion site of a house designed for
a non-profit low-income housing
project. In Boulder, Colo., we
picked spinach and hoed at a
community food garden, where
organic produce is raised to sup
plement the diets of people on
welfare, who mostly eat donated
canned goods and starchy foods
available through local food
banks.
It often amazes me how a
small gesture on our parts can
make such a great difference for
these programs. Knowing this,
it is difficult to imagine not con
tinuing such efforts once the
summer is over.
Throughout the Midwest,
people have opened their homes
to us, cooked us potluck dinners
and enthusiastically shared
their experiences and histories
with us.
From Teddi Sweker — the
only vegetarian in Winnemucca,
Nev. — who made us tofu
burgers, to Vesta Lyne, who
grew up on a small farm in
Kansas and made us pecan pie
from her mother's original rec
ipe, each person we meet gives
us a taste of her town's culture
and personalizes the visit for us.
