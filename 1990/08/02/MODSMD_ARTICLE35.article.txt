# Student rebates may pay for Bookstore remodeling
## 
### Jeremy Weinberg Staff writer 
The scaffolding and sawdust
that have surrounded the Book
store since last fall will mean a
greatly expanded selection of
titles for customers next year.
However, it may also mean a
significant reduction in stu
dents' rebate checks for the sec
ond year in a row.
The Bookstore's seven
member board meets next
Thursday to set the rebate rate
for the past year and to discuss
the $3 million expansion of the
building, slated to be completed
by January.
Board member Agnes Peter
son, a curator at the Hoover
Institution, said the board has
not yet decided exactly how to
pay for all the expansion, but
"it seems to be reasonable" to
use funds from the store's
reserve that otherwise would be
allocated to rebates.
"The whole point is to get bet
ter services, and in the long run
that will help the whole Stan
ford community, especially the
students," Peterson said.
In the short run though, stu
dents may see the rebate on
their purchases at the store drop
below 12 percent, the rate for
1988-89. That figure was lower
than the 16 percent of the year
before because funds were used
to pay for the first phase of

renovations, Bookstore General
Manager Eldon Speed explained.
Speed did not predict how
much next year's rebate rate
might fall, saying it depends on
how much the board wishes to
rely on borrowing from banks.
Stanford's rate still compares
favorably with that of some
other schools. The cooperative
at Yale University, which sells
books, clothes and other mer
chandise, refunds only about 5
percent of sales to members.
"If it's just a one-year thing
and would really help the stu
dents, it wouldn't be bad,"
junior Costanza Cocilovo said
about the prospect of a rebate
cut.
Ken Shark, manager of retail
operations, emphasized that the
expansion is aimed strictly at
enhancing the store's book se
lection. Overall, he said, the
volume of titles will increase
from about 135,000 to as many
as 300,000 over the next few
years.
But senior Torrence Boone,
the ASSU financial manager,
criticized the idea of reducing
rebates to pay for the project.
"I think the expansion is good
but they should find other ways
of financing it,"he said.
And students aren't the only
ones who may pay for the ex
pansion. Employees at the book
store earn money from the same
reserve fund from which rebates

are awarded.
"We fear for the worst," cus
tomer service representative
Alice Oberg said. "You guys get
rebates, we get profit-sharing."
The renovations are convert
ing the three-story building into
four levels; textbooks and com

puters will be sold on the two
underground levels, other books
on the ground floor, and clothes
and various non-clothing mer
chandise on the top level.
Since the entire project is not
scheduled to be completed

before the end of the year, the
fall rush to buy textbooks may
be a little hectic, Speed said.
"It'll be manageable and we
hope to make it as pleasant as
possible, but the project will not
be complete," he said.
