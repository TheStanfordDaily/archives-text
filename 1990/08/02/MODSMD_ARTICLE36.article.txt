# Youth program fosters 'earning and learning'

Yvonne Juarez, like 1,599
others, will enter Stanford's
class of 1994 in the fall. Unlike
most, however, she has already
held her first campus job.
Juarez is among the 115 stu
dents who are part of Stanford's
Youth Opportunity Program.
For over 20 years, the program
has brought economically disad
vantaged, disabled and minority
students, ages 14 to 21, to work
at a variety of campus jobs.
"The program was a chance
to get into the Medical Center,"
said Juarez, who works as a lab
assistant in the School of Med
icine. "It opened doors in the
field that I want to go into."
During the school year, 30 to
40 youths work at Stanford
through the program, according
to coordinator Luis Viniegra. In
summer the demand increases,
both from the students seeking
jobs and the departments
seeking students.
The program's twin goals are
to promote success and promote
diversity, said Viniegra, who
summarizes its benefits with the
phrase "earning and learning."
High school senior Anthony
Bradford said his favorite part
of the program is the paycheck.
"But," he is quick to add, "a lot
of new students look at it as

nothing but a paycheck. If you
really take advantage of the pro
gram, you can learn a lot."
In addition to on-the-job
training, weekly "success skills
workshops" address work
related issues, such as writing
resumes and understanding
taxes, as well as personal success
skills, such as goal-setting and
time management.
The program also takes stu
dents on tours of other univer
sity campuses. "We attempt to
demystify what seems impossi
ble for some students — going
to college," Viniegra said.
Lilly Lim went through the
program as a high school stu
dent. For five years, she has
overseen YOP students who
work in the Office of Develop
ment, where she is now a re
search supervisor. "It is a good
experience to work at a Univer
sity setting," she said. "It helps
you decide what you want to do.
I wish it was available for all
kids."
At 14, Candida Jamison of
Menlo Park is one of the pro
gram's youngest students. She
has worked in the Office of De
velopment for almost two
months, using the computers,
filing records and looking up in
formation about alumni. "The
best thing is for young kids to
get experience working, so we
can learn what's going to go on

'These students have a lot of potential,
and it is just a matter of realizing it....
We have students getting accepted to
colleges when before they were practi
cally dropping out of high school.'

when we grow up," she explains.
"It has helped build her self
esteem," said Marsha Meinel, a
secretary who works closely
with Jamison. "She looks at her
self in a more positive attitude."
The program boasts more tan
gible achievements as well.
Senior Priscilla Reza, lead stu
dent counselor for the program,
said, "We have students getting
accepted to colleges when before
they were practically dropping
out of high school."
But not all of the youth are
successful. "Some students are
not doing so well — that is
reality," Viniegra said. "They
are facing different kinds of
challenges. Our philosophy is
not to kick people out, but to
keep them in."
The Stanford student coun
selors serve as peer advisers,
counseling students on work and
personal problems. Juarez said

her counselor is also a friend.
"I asked him to help me next
year, when I am a Stanford stu
dent, to not sit in a corner by
myself," she said. "That's when
I get homesick."
Grimes said that as a coun
selor, he encourages students to
look toward the future. "I try
to get them thinking about their
career, about what they have to
do now to achieve what they
want in life," he said. Coun
selors also speak of the program
as a learning experience. "I have
learned that these students have
a lot of potential, and it is just
a matter of realizing it," Reza
said. "Some of them just need
a little push."
Cooperation from department
supervisors is essential to the
program's success. "Some of
these students come in with zero
experience, zero skills," Viniegra
said. "The supervisors teach

them basic skills and often play
the role of mentor."
Joy Wagner, business mana
ger for the Department of
Developmental Biology, said her
experience as a YOP supervisor
has been positive. "The students
are very responsible, conscien
tious and hard-working," she
said. "I have learned how capa
ble students are at this age, and
how independent they can be.
They bring enthusiasm and
brightness to the office."
Grimes said, "I have seen a
couple of supervisors break into
tears because they get so much
out of working with the kids."
The program accepts youth
from Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties. More than 40 percent
of the students are black, about
one-third are Hispanic or Latino
and 15 percent are Asian-
American. Ten of the students
are physically or learning dis
abled.
Students are paid a minimum
stipend of five dollars per hour,
and positions range from
groundskeeper to lab assistant,
depending upon the student's
age and previous work experi
ence. Money comes from Uni
versity departments who
request students as well as from
donations from corporations
and private foundations.
University-wide budget cuts
have put a strain on the pro
gram. "There is a lot of red tape,
but the students make it all
worthwhile," Reza said.
"I hope the program does not
suffer from the University's
streamlining," Grimes said. "It
is important to the future of
Stanford, and this is one of the
most real ways that Stanford is

helping the surrounding com
munities."
"The community has certain
needs from the University," said
former YOP coordinator Elnora
Webb, now Human Resources
recruitment and development of
ficer for employment. "There is
a need for the University to be
a model, to be a service."
Students, counselors and su
pervisors expressed hope that
the program would be strength
ened and expanded. As Wagner
said, "I hope it lasts forever."
