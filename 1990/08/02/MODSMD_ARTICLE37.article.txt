# Grants fund undergrad research
## 
### Sunil Perkash Staff writer 
Professors are not the only
ones conducting research over
the summer. With the Under
graduate Research Opportuni
ties program, which began
awarding grants in 1985, many
students have undertaken their
own summer projects.
This summer, students have
ventured all over the world to
pursue their projects, according
to Director Laura Selznick.
One recipient went to India
to study how sick children in
that country are treated in
hospitals, in comparison to the
West. Another went to the So
viet Union to study agriculture
on the outskirts of Leningrad.
And yet another student went
to Japan to study its traditional
paper-making process.
Senior Serena Spudich was
awarded a grant to go to Eng

land this summer to conduct re
search for her humanities honor
thesis. She is studying a 19th
century movement in England
that contributed to the modern
"material conception of the
mind."
Spudich spent a month in
England examining, among
other things, archived medical
journals. "I had never done re
search like that before," Spudich
said. "It was a fantastic experi
ence."
Funding is not limited to stu
dents who complete written
reports. In the past, one student
produced an ethnographic film
on Native Americans. Another
wrote a fictional story on loca
tion.
The grants are not need
based, but students who nor
mally need to work over the
summer can qualify for in
creased financial aid for the next
academic year.

Most students who apply
receive some funding. Students
can apply for a small grant, up
to $500 each quarter, or a msyor
grant, up to $2,500 once a year.
This past year, the research pro
gram received 231 applications,
of which 222 were approved.
According to Selznick, 75 per
cent of applicants apply for a
grant to help with their honors
theses, although writing a thesis
is not a required. Some students,
she said, apply purely out of
interest in an area.
Selznick said applications
were up 20 percent this year
and is optimistic that the pro
gram's popularity will increase.
She is confident that the re
search program will be able to
"raise money to meet the stu
dents' needs."
The application deadline for
minor grants for fall quarter is
Nov. 2. Major grant applications
are due spring quarter.
