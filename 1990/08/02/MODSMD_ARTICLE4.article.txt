"Students — students whom
I don't even know — have called
and offered their support, and
that has meant so much because
that is why I'm here — to work
with the students. That's what
my life is about," said Diana
Conklin, acting associate dean
of Student Affairs, in an inter
view Tuesday.
Conklin was arrested June 24
for being under the influence of
cocaine. She was issued a letter
of reprimand from the Univer
sity July 25, but will not face
any other disciplinary action
from Stanford.
With tears of gratitude, Con
klin talked about her experience
and the supportive response she
received from friends, family
and the University.
"The feeling that I get from
virtually everyone is real sym
pathy, affection and support. It
has reassured me so deeply
about the goodness of people,
that you can make a bad mistake
and people will understand and
let you recover from it," Conklin
said emotionally.
"It's a lot of what this place
is about. It's the kind of position
that we take with students, that
this is a place where you learn.
I am just grateful that a similar
attitude is extended to non
students, staff and faculty mem
bers of the community," she
added.
Shelly Stewart, a June grad
uate and former resident assist
ant on the Row, praised Conklin
for her contributions to Stan

ford. "She's touched more lives
... [and] availed herself to more
students than many deans," she
added.
Stewart said she disagrees
with the University's reprimand
because Conklin was on vaca
tion at the time of the arrest.
"It's her time; it's her iife," she
said.
Conklin's misdemeanor
charge will be dropped pending
the successful completion of a
drug diversion program which
can run from six months to two
years. She was placed in the pro
gram by the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court on July 25.
The program consists of drug
related counseling and involves
talking through her experience,
Conklin explained. According to
her attorney, Tom Nolan, first
time offenders are entitled to
such a program if they have not
been previously convicted of any
felony, and if the crime does not
involve violence, or possession
or sale of drugs.
Conklin had already sought
help from a professional coun
selor after her arrest "to under
stand what happened and why,
and to ensure that it will never
happen again." She said the di
version program allows her to
continue working with her pres
ent counselor.
She said she now has a pretty
good idea of why she took the
cocaine, although it is some
thing that she and her counselor
are not finished talking about.
"It's personal," she told The
Weekly, regarding the contents
of her counseling sessions.
In a statement released July

-25, Conklin recounted the cir
cumstances that led to her ar
rest. She said she came across
a small vial of old cocaine when
her husband was cleaning out
a closet before moving out. The
Conklins are in the process of
getting a divorce.
"Impulsively, I decided to use
what was in the vial," she said.
Conklin explained that she
was not charged for possession
of cocaine because the vial was
empty when the police found it.

She added that prior to the
arrest, she had not taken cocaine
for nine years, and only "very,
very infrequently" before that.
"Someone probably offered it to
me," she said.
Norm Robinson, acting dean
of student affairs, issued a state
ment July 25 explaining the
University's position. He said
Conklin's situation is of partic
ular concern "because she is in
a position that has a great deal
of responsibility for and influ

ence over student life."
He said, however, that Con
klin has established an enviable
record of exceptional service to
Stanford, and that he hopes
"her willingness to share the
details [of the circumstances
surrounding this event] will dis
suade others from unlawful
drug use."
Conklin admitted part of her
job is to be a role model for

plans to turn the Incident Into a constructive lesson.
