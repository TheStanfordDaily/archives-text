# Conklin explains circumstances behind arrest

### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
"Students — students whom
I don't even know — have called
and offered their support, and
that has meant so much because
that is why I'm here — to work
with the students. That's what
my life is about," said Diana
Conklin, acting associate dean
of Student Affairs, in an inter
view Tuesday.
Conklin was arrested June 24
for being under the influence of
cocaine. She was issued a letter
of reprimand from the Univer
sity July 25, but will not face
any other disciplinary action
from Stanford.
With tears of gratitude, Con
klin talked about her experience
and the supportive response she
received from friends, family
and the University.
"The feeling that I get from
virtually everyone is real sym
pathy, affection and support. It
has reassured me so deeply
about the goodness of people,
that you can make a bad mistake
and people will understand and
let you recover from it," Conklin
said emotionally.
"It's a lot of what this place
is about. It's the kind of position
that we take with students, that
this is a place where you learn.
I am just grateful that a similar
attitude is extended to non
students, staff and faculty mem
bers of the community," she
added.
Shelly Stewart, a June grad
uate and former resident assist
ant on the Row, praised Conklin
for her contributions to Stan

ford. "She's touched more lives
... [and] availed herself to more
students than many deans," she
added.
Stewart said she disagrees
with the University's reprimand
because Conklin was on vaca
tion at the time of the arrest.
"It's her time; it's her iife," she
said.
Conklin's misdemeanor
charge will be dropped pending
the successful completion of a
drug diversion program which
can run from six months to two
years. She was placed in the pro
gram by the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court on July 25.
The program consists of drug
related counseling and involves
talking through her experience,
Conklin explained. According to
her attorney, Tom Nolan, first
time offenders are entitled to
such a program if they have not
been previously convicted of any
felony, and if the crime does not
involve violence, or possession
or sale of drugs.
Conklin had already sought
help from a professional coun
selor after her arrest "to under
stand what happened and why,
and to ensure that it will never
happen again." She said the di
version program allows her to
continue working with her pres
ent counselor.
She said she now has a pretty
good idea of why she took the
cocaine, although it is some
thing that she and her counselor
are not finished talking about.
"It's personal," she told The
Weekly, regarding the contents
of her counseling sessions.
In a statement released July

-25, Conklin recounted the cir
cumstances that led to her ar
rest. She said she came across
a small vial of old cocaine when
her husband was cleaning out
a closet before moving out. The
Conklins are in the process of
getting a divorce.
"Impulsively, I decided to use
what was in the vial," she said.
Conklin explained that she
was not charged for possession
of cocaine because the vial was
empty when the police found it.

She added that prior to the
arrest, she had not taken cocaine
for nine years, and only "very,
very infrequently" before that.
"Someone probably offered it to
me," she said.
Norm Robinson, acting dean
of student affairs, issued a state
ment July 25 explaining the
University's position. He said
Conklin's situation is of partic
ular concern "because she is in
a position that has a great deal
of responsibility for and influ

ence over student life."
He said, however, that Con
klin has established an enviable
record of exceptional service to
Stanford, and that he hopes
"her willingness to share the
details [of the circumstances
surrounding this event] will dis
suade others from unlawful
drug use."
Conklin admitted part of her
job is to be a role model for

students, and she is aware that
her obligations subject her con
duct to high standards. In her
statement, she talked about the
"anguish in failing in those
obligations" and the hope that
she might redeem herself in the
eyes of others.
"I think students understand
that people can make mistakes,
and the important thing ... is
that you learn from your mis
takes. How I respond to it would
be very important," Conklin
said.
"I don't want to sound like
I'm making light of it — this
was a big mistake," she added.
Conklin said that had The
Weekly not found out about her
arrest, the matter would have
been strictly between herself and
the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment.
However, after her case was
made public, Conklin has been
dealing with this "unfortunate
event in a constructive way" said
Robinson, even authorizing him
to disclose the University's ac
tion. The University usually
keeps disciplinary actions con
fidential.
Conklin said her statement
and Robinson's will be distrib
uted to RAs, resident fellows
and probably orientation volun
teers "to make sure everybody
knows what happened." She
added that she will discuss her
experience at some point during
RA training, but she is not sure
in what format.
Rodger Whitney, assistant
dean of student affairs and di
rector of the Housing Center,
said he appreciates Conklin's
candor in responding to the sit
uation. Although he
acknowledged that the arrest
was made off-campus and was
not work-related, he said both
Conklin and the University's re

sponse were "calibrated appro
priately to the situation."
Robinson said the University
has no standard policy concern
ing disciplinary measures for ac
tions committed outside
Stanford. Each case is evaluated
on an individual basis, and
depends on the person's position
and offense, he said.
Given her unpleasant experi
ence with cocaine, Conklin has
her own insights into drug use
on campus and in the United
States. While she is sure that
there is some drug use among
faculty and students "in a pop
ulation this size," she said she
is not sure how extensive it is.
Conklin said faculty and staff
with drug problems can seek
counseling at the Help Center,
the equivalent of Counseling
and Psychological Services,
which serves students. She
added that most University in
surance policies for employees
cover drug counseling or even
inpatient treatment for al
coholism and other drug prob
lems.
Conklin said she has no idea
whether people feel comfortable
using the Help Center or CAPS.
"They should — it's totally con
fidential," she said.
Conklin also acknowledged
that drug use is a serious prob
lem in the United States. "I'm
from Florida, and I hear from
[my familyl horror stories about
the crime rate in southern Flor
ida, and it all seems to be drug
related," she said.
She said she is not sure
whether legalizing drugs would
be the right solution to the prob
lem. Another way of thinking
about it, she said, is asking
whether alcohol or cigarettes
should be made illegal, since
they are damaging drugs as well.
"I would not want to make it
any easier for anyone to develop
a drug problem, whether it is
alcohol, or tobacco, or illegal
drugs," she said.
"Students — students whom
I don't even know — have called

and the University.
"The feeling that I get from
virtually everyone is real sym
pathy, affection and support. It
has reassured me so deeply
about the goodness of people,
that you can make a bad mistake
and people will understand and
let you recover from it," Conklin
said emotionally.
"It's a lot of what this place
is about. It's the kind of position
that we take with students, that
this is a place where you learn.
I am just grateful that a similar
attitude is extended to non
students, staff and faculty mem
bers of the community," she
added.
Shelly Stewart, a June grad
uate and former resident assist
ant on the Row, praised Conklin
for her contributions to Stan

ford. "She's touched more lives
... [and] availed herself to more
students than many deans," she
added.
Stewart said she disagrees
with the University's reprimand
because Conklin was on vaca
tion at the time of the arrest.
"It's her time; it's her iife," she
said.
Conklin's misdemeanor
charge will be dropped pending
the successful completion of a
drug diversion program which
can run from six months to two
years. She was placed in the pro
gram by the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court on July 25.
The program consists of drug
related counseling and involves
talking through her experience,
Conklin explained. According to
her attorney, Tom Nolan, first
time offenders are entitled to
such a program if they have not
been previously convicted of any
felony, and if the crime does not
involve violence, or possession
or sale of drugs.
Conklin had already sought
help from a professional coun
selor after her arrest "to under
stand what happened and why,
and to ensure that it will never
happen again." She said the di
version program allows her to
continue working with her pres
ent counselor.
She said she now has a pretty
good idea of why she took the
cocaine, although it is some
thing that she and her counselor
are not finished talking about.
"It's personal," she told The
Weekly, regarding the contents
of her counseling sessions.
In a statement released July

-25, Conklin recounted the cir
cumstances that led to her ar
rest. She said she came across
a small vial of old cocaine when
her husband was cleaning out
a closet before moving out. The
Conklins are in the process of
getting a divorce.
"Impulsively, I decided to use
what was in the vial," she said.
Conklin explained that she
was not charged for possession
of cocaine because the vial was
empty when the police found it.

She added that prior to the
arrest, she had not taken cocaine
for nine years, and only "very,
very infrequently" before that.
"Someone probably offered it to
me," she said.
Norm Robinson, acting dean
of student affairs, issued a state
ment July 25 explaining the
University's position. He said
Conklin's situation is of partic
ular concern "because she is in
a position that has a great deal
of responsibility for and influ

ence over student life."
He said, however, that Con
klin has established an enviable
record of exceptional service to
Stanford, and that he hopes
"her willingness to share the
details [of the circumstances
surrounding this event] will dis
suade others from unlawful
drug use."
Conklin admitted part of her
job is to be a role model for

plans to turn the Incident Into a constructive lesson.
students, and she is aware that
her obligations subject her con
duct to high standards. In her
statement, she talked about the
"anguish in failing in those
obligations" and the hope that
she might redeem herself in the
eyes of others.
"I think students understand
that people can make mistakes,
and the important thing ... is
that you learn from your mis
takes. How I respond to it would
be very important," Conklin
said.
"I don't want to sound like
I'm making light of it — this
was a big mistake," she added.
Conklin said that had The
Weekly not found out about her
arrest, the matter would have
been strictly between herself and
the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment.
However, after her case was
made public, Conklin has been
dealing with this "unfortunate
event in a constructive way" said
Robinson, even authorizing him
to disclose the University's ac
tion. The University usually
keeps disciplinary actions con
fidential.
Conklin said her statement
and Robinson's will be distrib
uted to RAs, resident fellows
and probably orientation volun
teers "to make sure everybody
knows what happened." She
added that she will discuss her
experience at some point during
RA training, but she is not sure
in what format.
Rodger Whitney, assistant
dean of student affairs and di
rector of the Housing Center,
said he appreciates Conklin's
candor in responding to the sit
uation. Although he
acknowledged that the arrest
was made off-campus and was
not work-related, he said both
Conklin and the University's re

sponse were "calibrated appro
priately to the situation."
Robinson said the University
has no standard policy concern
ing disciplinary measures for ac
tions committed outside
Stanford. Each case is evaluated
on an individual basis, and
depends on the person's position
and offense, he said.
Given her unpleasant experi
ence with cocaine, Conklin has
her own insights into drug use
on campus and in the United
States. While she is sure that
there is some drug use among
faculty and students "in a pop
ulation this size," she said she
is not sure how extensive it is.
Conklin said faculty and staff
with drug problems can seek
counseling at the Help Center,
the equivalent of Counseling
and Psychological Services,
which serves students. She
added that most University in
surance policies for employees
cover drug counseling or even
inpatient treatment for al
coholism and other drug prob
lems.
Conklin said she has no idea
whether people feel comfortable
using the Help Center or CAPS.
"They should — it's totally con
fidential," she said.
Conklin also acknowledged
that drug use is a serious prob
lem in the United States. "I'm
from Florida, and I hear from
[my familyl horror stories about
the crime rate in southern Flor
ida, and it all seems to be drug
related," she said.
She said she is not sure
whether legalizing drugs would
be the right solution to the prob
lem. Another way of thinking
about it, she said, is asking
whether alcohol or cigarettes
should be made illegal, since
they are damaging drugs as well.
"I would not want to make it
any easier for anyone to develop
a drug problem, whether it is
alcohol, or tobacco, or illegal
drugs," she said.
"Students — students whom
I don't even know — have called
and offered their support, and
that has meant so much because
that is why I'm here — to work
with the students. That's what
my life is about," said Diana
Conklin, acting associate dean
of Student Affairs, in an inter
view Tuesday.
Conklin was arrested June 24
for being under the influence of
cocaine. She was issued a letter
of reprimand from the Univer
sity July 25, but will not face
any other disciplinary action
from Stanford.
With tears of gratitude, Con
klin talked about her experience
and the supportive response she
