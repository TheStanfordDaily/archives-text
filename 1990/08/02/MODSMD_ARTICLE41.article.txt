# For the record

### 
In the July 26 issue of The
Weekly, a story about suspicious
men in dorms describes an in
cident in Arroyo inaccurately.
The man in question visited two
female residents of Arroyo twice
on July 17, once at about 1:30
a.m. and once at about 11 p.m.
More importantly, this individ
ual was not and has never been
barred from all dormitory areas
as the story claims.
