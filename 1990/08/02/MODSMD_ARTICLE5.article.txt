### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
As part of the continuing effort to trim
$22 million from a $175 million budget base
by September 1991, the University has ap
proved the layoff of 97 employees.
The layoffs are part of the University's
budget reduction plan, which calls for the
elimination of 131 jobs by Sept. 1.
According to Keith Smith, acting manager
of employee relations, 97 of the 119 layoff
recommendations submitted for review by
Aug. 1 had been approved.
Of the 97 positions eliminated, 30 were
exempt and 67 were non-exempt, Smith said.
Exempt positions are salaried professional,
managerial or administrative jobs. Non
exempt positions include secretarial, office
and food service jobs.
Layoffs are occurring across the board
and are not concentrated in one particular
area, Smith said. He did not know the num
ber of United Stanford Worker employees
being put out of work.
Recommendations for layoffs are submit
ted by departmental managers to a panel
composed of members from the Affirmative
Action Office, the Legal office and Human
Resources.
According to Smith, the panel then at
tempts to determine "whether there is just
cause for laying off people and whether or
not the right person is being laid off." Smith
emphasized there is no set formula to the
process but rather the panel must take into
account all the factors in each individual
recommendation.
The 97 layoffs are part of the first of
several groups planned. The University in
tends to eliminate 300 to 400 jobs by 1991.
He pointed out, however, that although
300 to 400 jobs will be eliminated, that does
not necessarily mean that 300 to 400 people
will be laid off.
Many jobs will be terminated through
"natural attrition," said Smith. He explained
that jobs can be phased out when graduate
students holding staff positions graduate,
when staff members leave the area volun
tarily or when employees retire.
