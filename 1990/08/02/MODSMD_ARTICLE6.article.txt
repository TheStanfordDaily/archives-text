# Custodians' fate is still in question

### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The fate of the Tresidder Union
maintenance crew remains unclear as
its eight members, who received layoff
notices July 10, have been given yet
another extension to decide whether
or not to "bump," or replace, workers
of lesser seniority.
The original deadline for the deci
sion was July 20. The United Stanford
Workers, which is handling negotia
tions for the custodians, obtained an
extension until July 30. At the time
of the extension request, the outside
contractor had not been announced
and workers declared it unfair for
them to be expected to make the de
cision without knowing what benefits
the new company might offer.
Tresidder management announced
in June that the custodial work would
be contracted out to an outside com
pany beginning Sept. 1.
Tresidder's Building Service Mana
ger Jeannette Smith-Laws announced
to the workers July 24 that the new
company would be American Building
Maintenance. As of yesterday, Robert
Ramirez, ABM's Vice President of the
college and university division, said
he had not received any confirmation
from Tresidder that ABM won the bid.
Bobbi Braden, director of Tresidder,
said the University's procurement de
partment approved the company
Tuesday but has not issued a contract.
According to Rodney Barnette, field
representative of the USW, a letter
signed by Bobbrie Brown from Em
ployee Relations granted the cus
todians an extension until Aug. 8,
claiming "the internal process for se
lecting the contractor has not been
completed."
Smith-Laws said she handed a cus
todian a contract between the San
Mateo County Building Maintenance
Contractors Association, of which she
believes ABM is a member, and the
Service Employee's Union (Local 1877
of the AFL-CIO) about two weeks ago.
She said this contract would cover
the benefits of the Tresidder cus
todians should they decide to work
for the contractor.

contract and the current USW-
Stanford agreement lies in paid leave
time and holidays. USW workers ob
serve 11 holidays per year. Under the
Local 1877 contract, workers only ob
serve nine.
Stanford's contract also guarantees
12 days of sick leave per year. These
days can be accrued and no maximum
is imposed. According to Local 1877's
contract, workers get five days of sick
leave, and only a maximum of 25 can
be accrued.
Braden said ABM has an excellent
record and is one of the largest con
tractors of its kind. Bamette, how
ever, said he has heard stories of
mistreatment of workers and that
ABM is "a notoriously bad company
to work for."
Braden said she is not sure how
much money the company will save
Tresidder, but that the minimum is
$112,000, assuming the company
hires back the current custodians at
current wages. She said the company
proposed to hire 5.7 workers, which
means some of the custodians may
have to work part-time.
According to the current USW con
tract, the University has to ensure
that the contractor will offer employ
ment "at substantially equivalent
wages to the workers laid off' if the
layoffs result specifically from con
tracting out.
Eugene Alvarado, a custodian for
27 years, said he may either bump
or work for the new contractor. Ho
said he is going to attend the programs
that the University is offering for laid
off workers to see if he can find an
other University job.
Alvarado currently works the night
shift. If he gets a daytime job, he will
have to give up a part-time job that
he holds, he said.

Linda Crouse, a laborer who has
worked at Tresidder for 20 years, is
in charge of setting up for banquets
and conferences. Braden said ABM's
proposal did specify the job of setting
up, which will now be considered a
custodial job.
Because of the change in job clas
sification, Crouse said she may choose
not to work for the new company.
"The obvious thing would be to join
the labor crew at Operations and
Maintenance, but that would mean
bumping a guy I know," she said re
gretfully.
"What's been done is wrong. It's a
double standard — getting rid of eight
workers instead of consolidating two
managerial positions, a plan which we
proposed," Crouse said.
Barnette said he and Crouse had a
"grievance meeting" with Smith-Laws
yesterday morning, during which they
asked her to reconsider Tresidder's
decision of contracting out. He said
the meeting was fruitless.
Crouse said ABM is a union con
tractor and that Local 1877 is a good
union. "Tresidder has their hands full
now. They're going to be dealing with
two unions," she said.
Braden said Tresidder originally
asked eight companies to submit pro
posals, five of which were owned by
minorities. Of these five, only one
submitted a proposal, in conjunction
with three other companies owned by
whites. ABM is a "white-owned" com
pany.
Barnette said custodial work is one
of the few businesses that has minor
ity owners, and the fact that ABM is
not one such company, while not being
"definite discrimination," is a failure
on Tresidder's part to "meet its own
commitment" of affirmative action.

Eugene Alvarado, a custodian for
27 years, said he may either bump
or work for the new contractor. Ho
said he is going to attend the programs
that the University is offering for laid
off workers to see if he can find an
other University job.
Alvarado currently works the night
shift. If he gets a daytime job, he will
have to give up a part-time job that
he holds, he said.

Linda Crouse, a laborer who has
worked at Tresidder for 20 years, is
in charge of setting up for banquets
and conferences. Braden said ABM's
proposal did specify the job of setting
up, which will now be considered a
custodial job.
Because of the change in job clas
sification, Crouse said she may choose
not to work for the new company.
"The obvious thing would be to join
the labor crew at Operations and
Maintenance, but that would mean
bumping a guy I know," she said re
gretfully.
"What's been done is wrong. It's a
double standard — getting rid of eight
workers instead of consolidating two
managerial positions, a plan which we
proposed," Crouse said.
Barnette said he and Crouse had a
"grievance meeting" with Smith-Laws
yesterday morning, during which they
asked her to reconsider Tresidder's
decision of contracting out. He said
the meeting was fruitless.
Crouse said ABM is a union con
tractor and that Local 1877 is a good
union. "Tresidder has their hands full
now. They're going to be dealing with
two unions," she said.
Braden said Tresidder originally
asked eight companies to submit pro
posals, five of which were owned by
minorities. Of these five, only one
submitted a proposal, in conjunction
with three other companies owned by
whites. ABM is a "white-owned" com
pany.
Barnette said custodial work is one
of the few businesses that has minor
ity owners, and the fact that ABM is
not one such company, while not being
"definite discrimination," is a failure
on Tresidder's part to "meet its own
commitment" of affirmative action.
The fate of the Tresidder Union
maintenance crew remains unclear as
its eight members, who received layoff
notices July 10, have been given yet
another extension to decide whether
or not to "bump," or replace, workers
of lesser seniority.
The original deadline for the deci
sion was July 20. The United Stanford
Workers, which is handling negotia
tions for the custodians, obtained an
extension until July 30. At the time
of the extension request, the outside
contractor had not been announced
and workers declared it unfair for
them to be expected to make the de
cision without knowing what benefits
the new company might offer.
Tresidder management announced
in June that the custodial work would
be contracted out to an outside com
pany beginning Sept. 1.
Tresidder's Building Service Mana
ger Jeannette Smith-Laws announced
to the workers July 24 that the new
company would be American Building
Maintenance. As of yesterday, Robert
Ramirez, ABM's Vice President of the
college and university division, said
he had not received any confirmation
from Tresidder that ABM won the bid.
Bobbi Braden, director of Tresidder,
said the University's procurement de
partment approved the company
Tuesday but has not issued a contract.
According to Rodney Barnette, field
representative of the USW, a letter
signed by Bobbrie Brown from Em
ployee Relations granted the cus
todians an extension until Aug. 8,
claiming "the internal process for se
lecting the contractor has not been
completed."
Smith-Laws said she handed a cus
todian a contract between the San
Mateo County Building Maintenance
Contractors Association, of which she
believes ABM is a member, and the
Service Employee's Union (Local 1877
of the AFL-CIO) about two weeks ago.
She said this contract would cover
the benefits of the Tresidder cus
todians should they decide to work
for the contractor.

contract and the current USW-
Stanford agreement lies in paid leave
time and holidays. USW workers ob
serve 11 holidays per year. Under the
Local 1877 contract, workers only ob
serve nine.
Stanford's contract also guarantees
12 days of sick leave per year. These
days can be accrued and no maximum
is imposed. According to Local 1877's
contract, workers get five days of sick
leave, and only a maximum of 25 can
be accrued.
Braden said ABM has an excellent
record and is one of the largest con
tractors of its kind. Bamette, how
ever, said he has heard stories of
mistreatment of workers and that
ABM is "a notoriously bad company
to work for."
Braden said she is not sure how
much money the company will save
Tresidder, but that the minimum is
$112,000, assuming the company
hires back the current custodians at
current wages. She said the company
proposed to hire 5.7 workers, which
means some of the custodians may
have to work part-time.
According to the current USW con
tract, the University has to ensure
that the contractor will offer employ
ment "at substantially equivalent
wages to the workers laid off' if the
layoffs result specifically from con
tracting out.
