# Playful City designs fun for urban youth
##

At precisely 8 p.m., a steel
drum band beat out a tentative
rhythm, then burst into a lively
Carribean melody which set the
tempo for the events that were
to follow.
Sunday night's festivities at
Governor's Corner kicked off the
Playful City, a working confer
ence which attempts to
ameliorate the plight of children
and their families in urban set
tings.
Architects, teachers, urban
planners, child care providers,
developers, officials and
teenagers from around the coun
try spent four days in
brainstorming sessions,
workshops and presentations.
Their goal: to help urban com
munities better meet the needs
of children.
But nobody worked that eve
ning, for the Playful City Car
nival was about getting into the
spirit of play. Grown-ups and
children alike rode giant rocking
horses, bounced on a red in
flated platform next to a human
size bowling pin and beach ball,
played games with lengths of
rope and created balloon sculp
tures.
Red and white striped booths
and plastic arches lined the
perimeter of the impromptu
gathering place on the Suites'
lawn. Representatives from
schools, design firms and public
agencies shared experiences and
disseminated information to
anyone who wanted it.
A primary goal of the confer
ence was to get teenagers in
volved in planning and creating
their own environments. In one
alcove, Nancy Eletto, coordina
tor of the youth participants,
encouraged a group of 13- and
14-year-olds from the Oregon
Episcopal School to "let the
adults at the conference know
what's happening."
Manuel Lares, a 1990 high

school graduate, is a spokes
person for Kid City, a Santa
Monica youth empowerment
program. He advocates a youth
center "built by kids, with ma
terials from kids and ideas for
kids."
Although the underlying mes
sage of the conference was
serious, a spirit of fun prevailed.
Those who had arrived wearing
jackets and ties discarded them
in favor of T-shirts, shorts and
top-siders. Popcorn, pretzels,
lemonade and red licorice sticks
were served in place of the usual
conference fare.
But when the delegates split
into 10 teams, they tackled real
world issues like transportation,
child and teen care facilities, in
formation systems and schools.
The fruits of their labor were
visions of a world that could be.
The transportation group,
which renamed itself
"Transp/aytation," proposed
"incredible, edible" streets, with
pumpkins, blackberries and
fruit trees growing out of the
public rights-of-way; "calm"
streets, free of vehicular traffic,
which would be conducive to
watching, resting and thinking;
and "readable" streets with
painted curbs and matching
signs so that young people could
identify bus routes and places
they wanted to go.
The "Housing and Neighbor
hoods" team encouraged a
return to smaller communities
with shops, restaurants and
services within walking or bicy
cling distance, street closures
for neighborhood festivals and
youth-friendly businesses which
would operate on a barter sys
tem.
Although conceived with
children in mind, Playful City
also appeals to adults. "When
you lose the ability to play, you
lose part of yourself," said con
ference participant Carolyn
Draa. "And if the child in you
dies, a part of you dies."
