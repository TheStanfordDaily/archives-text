# Toxic waste upsets neighbors
## Leak from Stanford Research Park contaminates nearby areas 
### Eleni Kirkas 
Sometimes it takes more than
just good fences to make good
neighbors.
For Stanford, being a good
neighbor to the residents of Bar
ron Park, and other com
munities surrounding the
Hillview-Porter toxic waste site
at Stanford Research Park, is
also going to involve a consid
erable amount of time, money
and effort.
Eight years ago, toxic chemi
cals, presumably from storage
tanks belonging to companies
leasing the land from Stanford,
were found to have leaked into
the groundwater and soil at
Hillview-Porter.
In 1986, Matadero Creek and

wells in the nearby Barron Park
neighborhood were also found
to contain traces of the contam
inants. Ever since, a fierce battle
has been waged to determine
who is responsible for the leaks
and who should pay for the
cleanup.
After years of avoiding in
volvement with the site, Stan
ford has agreed to join 13 other
companies in a preliminary in
vestigation of the site ordered
by the state Department of
Health Services to determine
the extent of the damage and
the responsible party.
According to Peter Johnson,
the third-party administrator
and spokesperson for the parties
involved, both the companies
and the community at large are

"gratified that Stanford is
taking part" in the study, al
though "there's been no decision
on [Stanford's] participation be
yond the investigation stage."
The tests now being con
ducted will determine the extent
of the contamination and the
best methods for cleaning it.
Once these tests are completed,
a new analysis will be required
to determine which groups are
responsible and what percentage
of the cleanup costs those
groups will pay.
"We don't know how big it is,
we don't know what it will take
to clean it up. Right now it is
impossible to say what Stan
