# Toxic waste upsets neighbors
## Leak from Stanford Research Park contaminates nearby areas 
### Eleni Kirkas 
Sometimes it takes more than
just good fences to make good
neighbors.
For Stanford, being a good
neighbor to the residents of Bar
ron Park, and other com
munities surrounding the
Hillview-Porter toxic waste site
at Stanford Research Park, is
also going to involve a consid
erable amount of time, money
and effort.
Eight years ago, toxic chemi
cals, presumably from storage
tanks belonging to companies
leasing the land from Stanford,
were found to have leaked into
the groundwater and soil at
Hillview-Porter.
In 1986, Matadero Creek and

wells in the nearby Barron Park
neighborhood were also found
to contain traces of the contam
inants. Ever since, a fierce battle
has been waged to determine
who is responsible for the leaks
and who should pay for the
cleanup.
After years of avoiding in
volvement with the site, Stan
ford has agreed to join 13 other
companies in a preliminary in
vestigation of the site ordered
by the state Department of
Health Services to determine
the extent of the damage and
the responsible party.
According to Peter Johnson,
the third-party administrator
and spokesperson for the parties
involved, both the companies
and the community at large are

"gratified that Stanford is
taking part" in the study, al
though "there's been no decision
on [Stanford's] participation be
yond the investigation stage."
The tests now being con
ducted will determine the extent
of the contamination and the
best methods for cleaning it.
Once these tests are completed,
a new analysis will be required
to determine which groups are
responsible and what percentage
of the cleanup costs those
groups will pay.
"We don't know how big it is,
we don't know what it will take
to clean it up. Right now it is
impossible to say what Stan
ford's role will be," Johnson
said.
Indeed, this question has been
at the center of the controversy
since the problem was discov
ered. "What's been perplexing all
along the way has been ... the
true role of Stanford," said John
Joynt, president of the Barron
Park Neighborhood Association,
which has put pressure on Stan
ford, the companies involved
and the Department of Health
Services to look into the situa
tion.
The public, Joynt said, ex
pected Stanford to take the lead
in addressing this issue in the
community, and was disap
pointed at Stanford's late agree
ment to comply with the
department's orders.
"It signals to the community
that Stanford really doesn't care
to be the good corporate citizen
that the [Hewlett-Packardsl of
the world are," he concluded,
referring to the active role HP
has taken in the cleanup effort.
But Andrew Doty, Stanford's
director of community relations,
maintains the University has
acted appropriately. Stanford,
he says, has been involved with
the community from the begin
ning when, "as a good neighbor,"
the University volunteered to
test the wells in Barron Park
for contaminants after the
chemicals were first discovered.
Neighborliness aside, the
more pressing issue is payment
for the actual cleanup. Federal
and state laws stipulate that the
owner of property contaminated
by a chemical spill is responsible
for the cleaning. Stanford main
tains that the land was clean
when it was leased to the various
companies. "We haven't con
taminated the land; those re
sponsible should pay," said Doty.
Joynt is unconvinced by that
argument. As manager of the
land, he said, it is Stanford's

responsibility to know that
major companies leasing Stan
ford land use toxic chemicals
and how they dispose of them.
Furthermore, Stanford is com
pelled by law to cooperate in the
effort.
There no longer seems to be
any doubt that Stanford will
participate in the preliminary
study of the Hillview-Porter
site. Despite this decision, Joynt
and others remain skeptical of
the University's commitment to
the cleanup cause.
