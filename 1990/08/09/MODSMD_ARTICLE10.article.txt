# What happens after the cuts have been made?
## 
### Wendy Bjerknes Staff writer 
Ironically, the man who is now
responsible for coordinating
Stanford's layoff strategy during
the budget crisis is a layoff vic
tim himself.
As director of administrative
development, Keith Smith had
to decide where budget cuts
would occur in his office. Faced
with the choice of terminating
the jobs of five employees or his
own, Smith opted for the latter
and recommended that his po
sition be absorbed by the asso
ciate dean.
He was later offered a position
as manager of employee rela
tions.
Despite Smith's efforts, people
in his former office were put
out of work, including Maria Pa
checo, supervisor of data entry,

who was laid-off after 20 years
of service, during which she had
been promoted twice.
Although Pacheco considers
herself lucky because she can
now take advantage of a long
awaited opportunity to study
{jainting, she admits she was "a
ittle hurt."
Pacheco said she will miss
Stanford's environment, with its
diverse student body, beautiful
campus, cultural events and
sense of community.
The University realizes that
being laid off can be traumatic,
according to Jeremy Warren,
human resources development
manager.
The University contracted
Wright Associates, a career
counseling and placement firm,
to create counseling workshops
to help laid-off employees adjust
to life after Stanford, he said.

Pacheco attended one of this
counseling meetings and found
it helpful. "It gave me the
chance to hear other people and
their situations," she said.
"Some of us became friends and
formed a kind of support sys
tem.
"But," she was quick to add,
"some people at the workshop
were devastated."
Pacheco related the story of
a divorced woman who, after
yfears of service, was let go. The
woman was upset because she
has children in college and
feared that Stanford would ter
minate the grants that help
finance her children's education.
According to Pacheco, the
woman accepted a job at Stan
ford, even though it paid less
than comparable jobs, for the
benefits gained in the long run.
Now she fears she will lose them

and is unsure as to what she is
going to do.
Joyce Cook, a receptionist at
Memorial Church, also attended
the counseling session and de
scribed the meeting as "very
business-like.
"Some people were very frus
trated and angry, but the coun
selor leading the meeting
refused to let them vent their
emotions," she added.
Pacheco had similar feelings
about the session. "It seemed
as though everything they were
saying was rehearsed out of a
procedural manual. I felt like I
was part of a herd, rather than
an individual with real prob
lems."
However, they both felt an
other workshop, led by Marilyn
Bechtold, a hired specialist in
Stanford's Human Resources
services, was helpful.
"I know that every job ends
at some point," Pacheco said.

"Though I was surprised to find
out that I was being laid off, I
must say Stanford is really
trying to help.
"In addition to the workshops,
I will receive severence pay and
retirement benefits. I just hope
others will be able to manage,"
Pacheco added.
After the initial orientation, a
laid-off employee can attend a
second workshop on skills and
interests assessment. The day
long session includes checklists
and questionnaires designed to
identify skills, interests, person
ality traits and personal values.
After assessing what each per
son's "dream job" would be, the
final workshop titled, "Job Cam
paign/Effectives Workshop,"
helps participants obtain new
employment. The workshop
coaches the participants in writ
ing resumes, exploring the job
market and handling interviews.
