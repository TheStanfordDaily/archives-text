# Surgeons are highest-paid Stanford workers
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
As the University begins to
slash $22 million from its
budget and trim more than 100
employees from its payroll, most
top administrators still enjoy the
benefits of the higher-than
average pay raises they received
last year.
But those spearheading the
cuts are putting their money
where their mouth is. Provost
James Rosse took a .07 percent
cut in pay last year. And Robert
Street, the chair of the
repositioning task force, re
ceived less than the average 5
percent raise.

John Ford, who was promoted
to vice president of development
in 1988, earned the highest per
centage raise. His salary jumped

from $96,375 in the 1987-88 ac
ademic year to $117,875 in 88-
89, a 22.3 percent increase —
more than four times the
average.
Surgeons at the Medical
School remain the University's
highest-paid employees.
Cardiovascular Surgery Chair
Norman Shumway earned the
most last year — $460,221. He
is followed by Cardiovascular
Surgery Profs. Edward Stinson,
Phillip Oyer and D. Craig Miller,
who made $369,732, $351,075
and $305,147 respectively.
John Hanberry, chief of
neurosurgery, who recently
retired, made $282,991 in 1988-
89.
And University President
Donald Kennedy was sixth on
the list, with an annual income
of $194,375.
