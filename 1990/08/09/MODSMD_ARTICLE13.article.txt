# Eminent author exalts the erotics of eating
## 
### Todd Pierce Staff writer 
The morning before I met
M.F.K. Fisher, I found six
dappled plums, the color of nec
tarines, at a local farmers' mar
ket. When I arrived at her house
in the lolling, vine-bearing hills
of Sonoma, she sat on a couch,
extending her hand to me,
wearing a long Chinese dress of
the same color. Two goldfish
earrings with ruby drops hung
from her ears and penciled-in
eyebrows perched over fierce
eyes.
She ran her hand through the
bag of fruit, picked out the two
ripest, and smelled them deeply.
"Plums," she whispered, sinking
her teeth into the flesh. "Spring
plums. Good."
Such was the latest judgment
from the author of "With Bold
Knife and Fork," "An Alphabet
for Gourmets" and "How to
Cook A Wolf." A pioneer in the
art of eating, Fisher, 82, has
been writing about humans and
their appetites since the 19305,
when her first book, "Consider
the Oyster," appeared.
Fisher has an ace memory for
people and for food. From the
age of 4, when she tasted "the
grayish-pink fuzz grandmother
skimmed from a spitting kettle
of strawberry jam," she has
remembered what she tasted
and has remembered to write it
down.
Fisher embraces the fruits
and wines of the table with more
than a touch of lust. "It seems
to me that our three basic needs,
for food and security and love,
are so mixed and mingled and
entwined that we can not
straightly think of one without
the others," she writes in the
preface to "The Gastronomical
Me," the memoirs of her early
years.
"I tell about myself," she con
tinues, "and how I ate bread on
a lasting hillside, or drank red
wine in a room now blown to
bits, and it happens without my
willing it that I am telling too
about the people with me then,
and their other deeper needs for
love and happiness."
Fisher's writing spans a broad
range, both in time and in style.
During World War 11, when
rationing hit kitchens hard, she
wrote "How to Cook a Wolf,** a
guide to cooking with a limited
supply of ingredients and money.
It became a best-seller.
For two years Fisher worked
at translating Brillat-Savarin's
"The Physiology of Taste," pub

lishing the definitive modern
translation in 1949. She
considers this one of her
greatest achievements, and
writes in the preface, "Perhaps
we can sip that potion, even
vicariously, in the slow reading
of a few books like this one, and
can feel ourselves encouraged
and renewed by the knowledge
that . . . Brillat-Savarin could
outride the wild storms of revo
lution and intrigue and not let
them trouble his digestion."
Currently Fisher is working
on a book about Dijon, where
she spent the early 19305. There
she learned, with apprehension
and thrill, the complexities of
the French table and sideboard.
Of her work on this latest
project, Fisher said, "Memory is
the fourth tense. There is past,
present and future, and there is
memory working through
them."
Fisher's recollections are like
the visions of poet William
Blake: not at all vague or smoky,
but alive with rich and acutely
observed detail. Her five senses

are well-honed, and the sixth is
alert for any occasion.
In this respect, and in her
fascination with Chinese lac
quer red, the figure she resem
bles most is the late, great Diana
Vreeland, former editor-in-chief
of Vogue. Those who mistake
either of their books for chic
chatter will be surprised.
For instance, an entry from
1936 in"The Gastronomical
Me" reads, "That early spring I
met a young servant in northern
Burgundy who was almost fa
natical about food, like a
medieval woman possessed by
the devil. Her obsession en
gulfed even my appreciation of
the dishes she served, until I
grew uncomfortable."
Writing for Fisher is "like
dope," she said, adding, "There
are five generations of newspa
per people in my family. And I
never wrote to get published."
She has a long-standing vow
not to read anything she has
written. "Never read a word of

it," she mused as she flipped
the pages of my copy of "The
Gastronomical Me."
Fisher's three marriages have
each had an impact on her writ
ing and life. Her first husband,
A 1 Fisher, was the man whose
graduate work took them to
France, to the provincial town
of Dijon.
Later she married the painter
Dilwyn Parrish, whose works fill
the walls of her home. Many
are still-lifes and portraits, in
moody colors with broad
strokes.
After his death, she lived in
New York City's Greenwich Vil

lage, and was married for a few
years to a publisher named
Donald Friede. "A very charm
ing man, but he was a snake,"
Fisher said.
She recalled moving back to
California and raising her two
daughters in Whittier, in the
house where she had grown up.
Fisher then worked as a
freelance reporter, both at home
and abroad.
"The only things I have ever
been able to do well are write
letters and cook," she writes in
"Dubious Honors," a collection
of prefaces she has written for
other authors.
After the interview, I still see
Fisher as a cipher, an agreeable
puzzle. She has the arresting

presence of highly articulate
women who are well-versed in
the arts of power and creation.
I tell her the first book of
hers I read was "Alphabet." A
friend, who is a Slavophile, in
vited me for a dinner of cold
soups at her villa, which was
undergoing construction. The
house was empty but for the
two of us and a cat, and the red
lamp hanging over the kitchen
table gave our meal a revolu
tionary taste. Soon we heard,
from not far away on campus,
the notes of a bagpipe, and my
benefactor passed the book to
me with few words. For this
reporter, Fisher's prose has
retained the flavor of samizdat
â€” exciting and to be relished.

plums. Good."
Such was the latest judgment
from the author of "With Bold
Knife and Fork," "An Alphabet
for Gourmets" and "How to
Cook A Wolf." A pioneer in the
art of eating, Fisher, 82, has
been writing about humans and
their appetites since the 19305,
when her first book, "Consider
the Oyster," appeared.
Fisher has an ace memory for
people and for food. From the
age of 4, when she tasted "the
grayish-pink fuzz grandmother
skimmed from a spitting kettle
of strawberry jam," she has
remembered what she tasted
and has remembered to write it
down.
Fisher embraces the fruits
and wines of the table with more
than a touch of lust. "It seems
to me that our three basic needs,
for food and security and love,
are so mixed and mingled and
entwined that we can not
straightly think of one without
the others," she writes in the
preface to "The Gastronomical
Me," the memoirs of her early
years.
"I tell about myself," she con
tinues, "and how I ate bread on
a lasting hillside, or drank red
wine in a room now blown to
bits, and it happens without my
willing it that I am telling too
about the people with me then,
and their other deeper needs for
love and happiness."
Fisher's writing spans a broad
range, both in time and in style.
During World War 11, when
rationing hit kitchens hard, she
wrote "How to Cook a Wolf,** a
guide to cooking with a limited
supply of ingredients and money.
It became a best-seller.
For two years Fisher worked
at translating Brillat-Savarin's
"The Physiology of Taste," pub

lishing the definitive modern
translation in 1949. She
considers this one of her
greatest achievements, and
writes in the preface, "Perhaps
we can sip that potion, even
vicariously, in the slow reading
of a few books like this one, and
can feel ourselves encouraged
and renewed by the knowledge
that . . . Brillat-Savarin could
outride the wild storms of revo
lution and intrigue and not let
them trouble his digestion."
Currently Fisher is working
on a book about Dijon, where
she spent the early 19305. There
she learned, with apprehension
and thrill, the complexities of
the French table and sideboard.
Of her work on this latest
project, Fisher said, "Memory is
the fourth tense. There is past,
present and future, and there is
memory working through
them."
Fisher's recollections are like
the visions of poet William
Blake: not at all vague or smoky,
but alive with rich and acutely
observed detail. Her five senses

are well-honed, and the sixth is
alert for any occasion.
In this respect, and in her
fascination with Chinese lac
quer red, the figure she resem
bles most is the late, great Diana
Vreeland, former editor-in-chief
of Vogue. Those who mistake
either of their books for chic
chatter will be surprised.
For instance, an entry from
1936 in"The Gastronomical
Me" reads, "That early spring I
met a young servant in northern
Burgundy who was almost fa
natical about food, like a
medieval woman possessed by
the devil. Her obsession en
gulfed even my appreciation of
the dishes she served, until I
grew uncomfortable."
Writing for Fisher is "like
dope," she said, adding, "There
are five generations of newspa
per people in my family. And I
never wrote to get published."
She has a long-standing vow
not to read anything she has
written. "Never read a word of

it," she mused as she flipped
the pages of my copy of "The
Gastronomical Me."
Fisher's three marriages have
each had an impact on her writ
ing and life. Her first husband,
A 1 Fisher, was the man whose
graduate work took them to
France, to the provincial town
of Dijon.
Later she married the painter
Dilwyn Parrish, whose works fill
the walls of her home. Many
are still-lifes and portraits, in
moody colors with broad
strokes.
After his death, she lived in
New York City's Greenwich Vil

lage, and was married for a few
years to a publisher named
Donald Friede. "A very charm
ing man, but he was a snake,"
Fisher said.
She recalled moving back to
California and raising her two
daughters in Whittier, in the
house where she had grown up.
Fisher then worked as a
freelance reporter, both at home
and abroad.
"The only things I have ever
been able to do well are write
letters and cook," she writes in
"Dubious Honors," a collection
of prefaces she has written for
other authors.
After the interview, I still see
Fisher as a cipher, an agreeable
puzzle. She has the arresting

presence of highly articulate
women who are well-versed in
the arts of power and creation.
I tell her the first book of
hers I read was "Alphabet." A
friend, who is a Slavophile, in
vited me for a dinner of cold
soups at her villa, which was
undergoing construction. The
house was empty but for the
two of us and a cat, and the red
lamp hanging over the kitchen
table gave our meal a revolu
tionary taste. Soon we heard,
from not far away on campus,
the notes of a bagpipe, and my
benefactor passed the book to
me with few words. For this
reporter, Fisher's prose has
retained the flavor of samizdat
â€” exciting and to be relished.
The morning before I met
M.F.K. Fisher, I found six
dappled plums, the color of nec
tarines, at a local farmers' mar
ket. When I arrived at her house
in the lolling, vine-bearing hills
of Sonoma, she sat on a couch,
extending her hand to me,
wearing a long Chinese dress of
the same color. Two goldfish
earrings with ruby drops hung
from her ears and penciled-in
eyebrows perched over fierce
eyes.
She ran her hand through the
bag of fruit, picked out the two
ripest, and smelled them deeply.
"Plums," she whispered, sinking
her teeth into the flesh. "Spring
plums. Good."
