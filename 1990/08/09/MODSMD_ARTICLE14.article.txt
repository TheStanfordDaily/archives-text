# Excerpts from Fisher's writings

This is an excerpt from M.F.K. Fisher's "An Alphabet for
Gourmets:"
There is for me a special lure in the names of English
puddings: the Steamed Spotted Dog my aunt Gwen used to
make for our delectation, and the Chocolate Mud. They have
a realistic ugliness about them which sums up my whole
finicky adult approach to something inseparable from the
unquestioning, lusty appetite of childhood.
When I was little I was happy in the presence of unlimited
Treacle Sponge. Now I would pull away from it and agree
with the old proverb, "Cold pudding settles one's love" â€”
right to the pit of one's stomach, I could add.
M.F.K. Fisher married Dilwyn Parrish in the mid-19405,
and his fictional persona Chexbres lives in her books as one
of the most romantic men of the 20th century. In"The
Gastronomical Me," she writes:
That afternoon I'd found a big sheet of drawing paper on
my desk, heavy with scrolls and banners and phoenixes: I
was invited to Chexbres' studio at midnight, for an Easter
supper. I made myself look as beautiful as I could, and then
as a non-existent clock chimed twelve I went on tiptoe up the
stairs to the attics where Chexbres lived, carrying a nest I'd
made of grasses, with some painted eggs in it. They were
very pretty, and I knew they'd please him.
Inside the studio there were many candles, and the upper
part where the big bed and the armoires and such things
were had meadow flowers everywhere. We stayed in the lower
part.
He had hung all my favorite pictures, and there was a
present for me on the low table, the prettiest Easter present
I have ever seen. It was a big tin of Beluga caviar, in the
center of a huge pale-yellow plate, the kind sold in the market
on saints' days in Vevey, and all around the tin and then
the edge of the plate were apple blossoms. I think apple
blossoms are perhaps the loveliest flowers in the world, because
of their clarity and the mysterious way they spring so delicately
from the sturdy darkness of the carved stems, with the tender
green leaves close around them. At least they were the loveliest
that night, in the candlelight, in the odd-shaped room so full
of things important to me.
Chexbres was dressed as I was, very specially, and we
whispered as if our friend two thick stone floors below us
might at any moment suspect our skulduggery and march
furiously up the stairs, and pound on the door to shame us.
There was a bottle of smooth potent gin, unlike any I'd
ever tasted. We drank it in glasses Chexbres had bought for
then, shaped like crystal eggs almost, and with the caviar it
was astonishingly good. We sat whispering and laughing
and piling the pungent little black seeds on dry toasted bread,
and every swallow of the liquor was as hot and soft as the
candle flames around us.
Then, after we had eaten almost all of the caviar and
drunk most of the gin, and talked as Chexbres and I always
talked, more and better than we ever talked with anyone else,
I stood up, thanked him very politely for the beautiful surprise,
and walked toward the door to the stairs.
For a minute he was too startled to do anything. Then he
leaped to his feet, and got there in front of me.
"You are leaving now?" His voice was polite as mine had
been.
"Yes." I said. "Goodnight, and thank you."
"Goodnight," he said calmly, and I knew as I went silently
down the stairs to my own room that he was watching me
with incredulity.
I felt amazed myself; but suddenly there in the softly lighted
studio with the two of us in our best clothes and the formal
secret invitation still in my mind, I'd seemed to become a
timid young girl watching her behavior in the apartment of
a man of the world.
