## Lessons of history 
### 
THE ONGOING crisis in
the Persian Gulf has
led many individuals to
compare Hussein with Hitler.
These jingoistic writers have
all but declared war on Iraq
and their comparisons have
fueled the fervor which has
landed many young American
men and women in the desert
sands to "keep history from
repeating itself."
But does the Hussein/ Hit
ler parallel tell the whole
story, or are writers focusing
our attention only on the
chapters of history which feed
their arguments?
There are a few other his
tory lessons that we should
think about, other than the
1930s lesson that appease
ment is not the smartest
policy to follow when dealing
with a ruthless dictator.
There is the lesson of the
late 19605. Let's call it the
teaching of Vietnam. These
days the United States seems
to be sending a lot of troops
to distant parts of the world
— parts of the world where
they are not really prepared
to fight. And as we learn more
about U.S. troop deploy
ments, it is becoming increas
ingly clear that our forces will
be tremendously outnum
bered .
Though we are told the
world is uniting against Hus
sein, so far the U.S. is sending
in most of the troops. And
while America's hands are
tied when it comes to using
certain weaponry, Hussein
has chemical weapons which
he has used before.
The U.S. press has depicted
Hussein as a power-hungry,
ruthless dictator who has no
regard for life.
But Hussein is still viewed
as a hero by many people in
the Arab world. Imagine a
leader overpowering a sover
eign nation in a few days and
still being respected by his
supporters. It shouldn't be

that hard. You don't even
have to think back to Hitler.
Just think back to December
1989 and the U.S. invasion
of Panama.
But of course, that was dif
ferent because Noriega was a
monster just like Hussein;
Bush is one of the good guys.
Now that Bush is sending
troops into Saudi Arabia,
Americans are jumping on
the war wagon. This is a sign
that things haven't really
changed as much as we might
have thought. We are still
living in a world where might
makes right.
Under these rules, Hussein
should not be underes
timated. He was smart
enough to take Kuwait. He
was smart enough to force
America's hand. The question
now is whether America has
a better hand or not. And the
answer is certainly not an un
qualified "yes."
A question worth consider
ing is why many Americans
have agreed almost overnight
that it is worthwhile — and
even necessary — to prepare
for war.
At least part of the answer
is our need for oil. The U.S.
failed to learn the oil crunch
lesson of the early 19705.
Failing to switch to alterna
tive fuels has become a na
tional security issue.
Now, in 1990, our need for
oil is still so strong that con
cerns about the supply of that
resource are enough of a rea
son to go to war.
This crisis is the first test
of a new international politi
cal order. Each action that
nations take will lay the foun
dation for the future.
Above all, we must realize
that, while history can offer
us guidance, the only history
that is ultimately important
is the history we are making
each day as this conflict es
calates. This is the year that
anything can happen.
