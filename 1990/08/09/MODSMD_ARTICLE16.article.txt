Amendment does not abridge freedom of speech

In his August 1 column, which
ran under the alarmist headline,
"Free speech is now pass 6 at
Stanford," Nat Hentoff of New
York's Village Voice argued that
a recent amendment to Stan
ford's century-old Fundamental
Standard has compromised the
University's integrity.
Although I agree that the
amendment may be too narrowly
applied — protecting blacks and
not whites from racist speech
— HentofTs article went too far
in suggesting that Stanford has
compromised its integrity as a
university, and that the amend
ment patronizes those it at
temps to protect.
The amendment restricts only
that speech which has gone be
yond the free expression'of ideas
and has become harassment.
The carefully crafted code only
allows a person to be punished
if his or her speech is intended
to directly stigmatize another
through "the use of fighting
words or non-verbal symbols."
As written, the amendment
can hardly be considered a

restriction of free expression or
the beginning of Stanford's
decline and fall as a university.
It is merely a clarification of
the Fundamental Standard that
all students agree to abide by
when they enter.
The Standard states: "Stu
dents are expected to show both
within and without the Univer
sity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded
of good citizens. Failure to ob
serve this will be sufficient cause
for removal from the Universi
ty."
The new policy merely
clarifies the Standard and puts
Stanford's full weight behind
something that should be self-

Fighting words are not part of the free trans
mission of ideas and therefore do not really
constitute 'speech' in the Constitutional
sense.

evident at any university; the
use of "nigger," "faggot" or any
other epithet to directly insult
another individual on the basis
of an immutable characteristic
will not be tolerated.
Although he mentions the
"fighting words" aspect of the
policy in his article, Hentoff
misses the clause's relevance in
protecting free expression. In
Chaplinshy v. New Hampshire,
the Supreme Court held that,
like obscenity, fighting words do
not contain expressive content
worthy of First Amendment
protection.
In short, fighting words are
not part of the free transmission
of ideas and therefore do not

really constitute "speech" in the
Constitutional sense. A restric
tion on fighting words, there
fore, does not have a bearing on
the exchange of ideas and does
not violate the spirit of the First
Amendment.
Ilentoff criticizes Stanford for
not taking on the burden of
defining "fighting words."
Fighting words, however, have
been clearly defined by the Su
preme Court as "words that by
their very utterance inflict in
jury or tend to incite an imme
diate breach of the peace."
Free speech is far from passe
at Stanford. The new policy,
which Hentoff calls an absurd
and destructive enterprise, does
nothing more than allow stu
dents to engage in open dis
course and live in the Stanford
community with the knowledge
thafc verbal or symbolic harass
ment can no longer hide behind
the First Amendment's protec
tion of the free transmission of
ideas.
