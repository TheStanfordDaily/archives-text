## Stanford culture gets a critique 
### 
All my life (or at least since
I was a teen-ager), I've wanted
to be a critic. Not just any critic,
but a social critic, the kind who
decides what is "in"and "out"
of style.
For years I religiously studied
the bible of popular culture —
People magazine. And recently
I moved one step closer to
achieving my dream by receiving
my degree in social criticism
from the National Enquirer In
stitute of Popular Culture.
The following In/Out list is
taken from my honors thesis
titled, "Stanford in the 1990-91
School Year: A Cultural Cri
tique."
In: University phone system.
Out: phone sex.
In: condom machines. Out:
Coke machines. (Beware: There
may be a slight difference in
taste.)
In: administrators on drugs.
Out: students on drugs.
In: Diana Conklin. Out: Mi
chael Jackson.
In: the Faculty Senate. Out:

the League of Revolutionary
Struggle.
In: honesty. Out: political cor
rectness.
In: Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford socials. Out: "screw
your roommate" parties.
In: Leland Stanford, Jr. Out:
Gorbachev (Let's hope Junior
can make it to some of the fes
tivities that will be held in his
honor.)
In: the Bookstore. Out: the
Coffee House.
In: GLAS socials. Out: frat
parties (Obviously, I'm trying to
push those GLAS socials, be
cause they are in need of some
serious reviving.)
In: white women with braids.
Out: black women with braids.
In: XTV. Out: Sunday Flicks.

And recently I moved one step closer to
achieving my dream by receiving my degree
in social criticism from the National Enquirer
Institute of Popular Culture.

In: Leontyne Price. Out: Stan
ford a capella groups (Let's hear
it for Lively Arts for bringing
Ms. Price — the black diva of
opera — to the Farm.)
In: White Plaza stench. Out:
earthquakes.
In: lesbians. Out: everyone
else.
In: Centennial Celebration.
Out: 108 Stanford employees.
In: some other black (and
gay?) columnist. Out: Corey
Davis. (After writing a column
for two quarters and receiving
a Dean's Award for Service and
a profile in "Stanford Today,"
this tired queen has finally run
his course.)

Corey Davis is a senior in drama
and Afro-American studies.
