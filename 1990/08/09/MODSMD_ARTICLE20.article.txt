# 'May Fools' is foreign fun
## 
### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
Everyone knows that the
French know how to eat.
They're also known for their
bizarre interpersonal relation
ships — or is that just in the
movies?
Whichever, it's certainly true
about Louis Malle's new film,
"May Fools." In this movie
Malle turns away from the som
berness of his other works, such
as "Au revoir les enfants," and
works from a new recipe that's
less filling but tastes great.
"May Fools," though light, is
far from empty. Besides being
stuffed with food, wine, politics,
greed, implicit sex, explicit drugs
and even love, this movie is fun
ny.
A film as jam-packed with
touchy human issues would
have to try hard not to be funny.
Especially when it's the late '60s
on a rural French estate where

the matriarch of a family has
just died. You'll love watching
the heirs scramble for the
jewelry and silverware.
Meanwhile, the kids and old
folks have a grand time of their
own. The youngest girl in the
family, Frangoise (Jeanne
Herry-Leclerc), is intrigued by
the adult world and continually
asks her grandfather questions.
She wants to know why Aunt
Claire (Dominique Blanc) ties
her female friend to the bed.
Grandfather Milou, played by
Michel Piccoli, answers that it's
probably to keep her from
leaving in the middle of the
night. And when Frangoise asks,
"What's the pill?" Milou
responds a little more honestly
that it's "progress."
Progress is not the only aspect
of life in the '60s to penetrate
the sleepy wine-country
funereal setting of "May Fools."
While the deceased great
grandmother, in accordance

with tradition, lies in a candlelit
room in the house until the fu
neral, a radio blares — in the
same room — with news of a
changing world.
Broadcasts of "revolution"
range from a grave speech in
which President Charles De
Gaulle threatens to resign, to
stories of sit-ins staged by irate
professional soccer players.
Between interruptions the
family goes about its business
of eating, drinking and bickering
until a scare sends them all up
in the hills for a cold, hungry
night. Silverware notwithstand
ing, by the time the family
returns to the villa, their
opinions of each other have im
proved.
Unlike many so-called good
movies, "May Fools" is not
deliberately deep. Unlike many
so-called good directors, Malle
would rather entertain you than
make a statement.
