# 'Mage' offers action, surprises
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
Many tales are created these days, in every
possible medium, that blandly play upon the clas
sic themes of heroism and adventure. Grasping
for storylines that are merely opaque variations
on the themes established in literature since the
Golden Ages, these adventures are pale shadows
of the original works.
However, in the graphic novel "Mage: The Hero
Discovered," author and artist Matt Wagner
creates a tale that transcends the standard hero
epic by both forging into new ground and drawing
upon the best of the ancient material.
Wagner's hero, Kevin Matchstick, is a disillu
sioned 20th-century big-city denizen with a des
tiny beyond his knowledge and comprehension.
His guide through his self-realizing processes is
the World Mage, a powerful magic-wielding ally.
Along with some other colorful characters, in
cluding Edsel, the black teenage girl who under
stands Kevin's destiny and swears to protect him
selflessly, and Sean, a ghost among the living
who didn't realize his own lack of tangibility,
Kevin sets out to fulfill whatever fate lies in
store for him.
Herein lies some of the attraction of Wagner's

work. The hero, unaware of his own abilities and
future, provides surprises that alternate between
incredible feats of bravery, laughable antics of
unpreparedness and understandable periods of
self-doubt. He seems very realistic and multi
dimensional.
With good character depiction and a provoking
plot, this work is further complemented by the
excellent artwork. At first glance somewhat dis
appointingly simple, Wagner's art grows upon the
reader. Its simplicity enables the reader to focus
on that which is most important, and its bold,
striking colors (on high-quality paper) quickly
endear themselves to the reader.
All of these qualities, plus a surprising conclu
sion that incorporates that "ancient" tale hinted
at above, combine to make this three-volume
work worthy of purchase and perusal at $12.95
to $14.95 a book. An added bonus is the excellently
done "Interlude" added to the end of the third
part.
Although this work's continuation is currently
under contest as Comico, the original publisher,
was bought out by Starblaze Graphics, one can
hope that Wagner will have the desire and op
portunity to utilize his talents in producing more
stories with Kevin Matchstick at the center.
