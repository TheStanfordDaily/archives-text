## Flying isn't just for the birds 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
There is something serenely divine about two
birds sailing aloft the currents of the wind, defying
the laws of gravity which keep human beings
earthbound.
It has always been a dream of human beings,
with birds as inspiration, to fly. And, in this
century, human beings have reached new heights
and taken the air as part of their realm.
It was this dream of flight and the desire to
join in the spirit of aviation that brought me to
the office of the Stanford Flying Club for my
first lesson.
The lessons are expensive: instructors charge
between $20 to $30 an hour, flight time costs
another $30 to $40 dollars an hour and club
membership runs about $20 to $30 a month. If
you can afford it, however the experience is some
thing else.
I had never flown a plane before and knew
only the rudimentary concepts behind aeronau
tics. But I flew a plane during my first lesson.
My lesson was about two hours long. For the
first hour, I learned some basic concepts of flying
and my instructor prepared me for what it would
be like in the plane. He explained what the dif
ferent controls did and when to use them.
Then we crossed the street to the airfield and

got acquainted with one of the club's Cessna 150
planes. We walked around the plane and did a
pre-flight check, filled it up with gas and taxied
out onto the runway.
You use foot pedals to taxi the plane, not the
yoke, and there are also foot brakes. Though I
didn't land the plane — which is supposed to be
a challenge — I can tell you that it is much
harder to taxi than to fly.
We waited our turn at the edge of the runway
and then finally took off. It was a little nerve
racking, but very easy. You just push in on the
throttle to build up speed, keep the plane pointed
straight and pull back slightly on the yoke as
you get to the right speed. The plane takes off
by itself and, before you know it, you are among
the birds.
We Hew over the Bay toward Newark and it
was very beautiful. But most of the time I was
concentrating on what I was doing and trying to
steer the plane.
I learned a lot. First, the instruments are ex
tremely sensitive. Second, lift and speed are
related in a way that you would not expect. While
the yoke controls the angle at which the plane
goes through the air and the throttle controls
how much gas the engine is given, to change
altitude you use the throttle and to change speed
you use the yoke. It takes a little bit of getting
used to, but after a while it starts to make sense.
Flying above the bay and a canyon beyond
Newark, I barely had time to notice the view. I
did some turns and learned how to use the yoke
and the throttle.
Flying the plane was really a thrill. The Cessna
150 is so small that it is almost like an extension
of your body. It feels as if you are flying like a
bird. And it is a totally different experience from
being a passenger in a commercial plane. Even
though the Cessna 150 is so stable it can almost
fly itself, you can still feel every air current.
I was up in the air flying for about an hour,
but it seemed like only a few minutes before it
was time to land.
My instructor took over the controls and landed
the plane. It is a little bit more difficult than
taking off and most first-time fliers don't land
the plane.
My instructor said that people who are really
bitten by the flying bug dream about how to land
the plane and spend time working it out in their
minds before their next lesson. I had a great
time, but I haven't been dreaming about any
landings so perhaps I'm not the flying type.
But for those of you who think you are, it
usually takes about 10 to 20 hours of flying time
before you can fly solo and it takes another 20
to 30 hours in the air before you can get a
national license that will allow you to take pas
sengers aloft.
If you have the money, taking to the skies is
the way to go.
