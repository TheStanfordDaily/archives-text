# Nicholson's 'The Two Jakes' is elusive, intriguing
## 
### William Thomas Staff writer 
"The Two Jakes" is subtle,
careful and cerebral.
This statement raises the
question of how similar the
movie is to a crossword puzzle.
In spite of the fact that I never
involve myself with such quasi
phonetic diversions, I will assert
that "The Two Jakes" is not a
crossword puzzle.
Rather, it is an immaculately
constructed jigsaw, set within a
complex mixture of emotion and
tragedy. Moreover, this movie
has far better acting and
cinematography than any word
game ever imagined.
Jack Nicholson was
nominated for an academy
award for his first appearance
as Jake Gittes, a private inves
tigator who specializes in in
fidelity cases, in the 1974 film
"Chinatown." "The Two Jakes"
places Nicholson in the same
role, 10 years later in Gittes' life.
This time around, however,
Nicholson is directing as well as
starring in the movie. And he
performs both roles with the
gusto and quality of the talented
veteran he ift.

Gittes is once again the savvy
detective with a code of ethics
established by his experiences
with the corrupted justice of so
ciety. He has changed — some
what — and Nicholson
masterfully portrays the influ
ences that World War 11, age
and the events of "Chinatown"
have had on his character.
The movie that Nicholson
creates as director follows a
similar pattern of developmental
themes.
No holds are barred in the
recreation of the Los Angeles of
1948. Nicholson carefully il
lustrates the differences be
tween his L.A. and the L.A. of
"Chinatown" (1938) and even
the L.A. of today. Camera
angles, set pieces and costumes
interact to capture the fleeting
beauty of L.A. even while they
portray the corrupting effects of
the human exploitation that
takes place here.
Nicholson*B movie is about the
land as much as it is about the
people. The plot and action are
intertwined with the fate of the
land and the profits to be made.
To those who have seen
"Chinatown," this sounds
familiar; hopefully this

familiarity is enough to permit
a successful grasp of this intri
cate plot.
The earlier movie is a prere
quisite for total appreciation of
the subtleties of "The Two
Jakes." Without it, bits of the
plot are complete non sequiturs
and characters are confusing
and motivated by forces that can
only be guessed at.
Nicholson states that "The
Two Jakes" is a thinking man's
mystery, and I would add that
it is a mystery for the thinking
veteran of "Chinatown."
On the other hand, this movie
is excellent even if the viewer
has not seen, or does not re
member, "Chinatown." As an
intrigue-laden mystery, "The
Two Jakes" receives a thumbs
up on its own merits.
The potential non sequiturs
are not necessary for a complete
understanding of the plot. Nor
are the character motivations
frustrating without a knowledge
of past events. A quick briefing
by someone in the know will
grant the novice viewer a
greater sense of completion.
The strongest aspect of the
flick, however, is in its human
interactions. I have mentioned

Nicholson's studied and inspired
performance already. Eli Wal
lach, Ruben Blades, Frederic
Forrest, David Keith, Richard
Farnsworth, and especially Har
vey Keitel and Meg Tilly all per
form to perfection.
Together they complete the
convoluted world of greed, love,
spite and memory in which
erotic relations and betrayals
amongst the characters are con
stantly revealed. The greys and

charcoals of the human soul are
on parade without any claim of
a good-evil polarity.
Once again I have typed a
statement with all the truth and
pretention of a good crossword;
once again, this is not anything
similar to "The Two Jakes." Go
see it, ride the plot even as it
attempts to slither away, and
see why I felt as if I were deci
phering something that is not
a crossword puzzle at any point.
