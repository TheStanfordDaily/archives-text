# Farmer's Market provides fare for French feast
## 
### Sophie Romillat 
If you want to make a good meal for
your friends at a low price, you should
go to the Farmer's Market in Palo Alto.
It takes place on Gilman Street (between
Forest and Hamilton avenues) every Sat
urday from 8:00 a.m. to noon through
the summer (from May to November).
The swirling colors of brightly colored
fruits and vegetables, fancy umbrellas
and bright clothing are an inviting and
intriguing sight at the market. Every
thing is moving, and you will be attracted
by this wonderful and natural ambience.
A small band plays violin and banjo
music, and a dignified old man can be
heard playing the hammer dulcimer.
However, the products are what make
this market really interesting. The
quality and the diversity of the vegetables
and fruits will surprise you. They are
all grown in California. The prices are
very cheap and change every week, based
on whether the produce is in season.

A map shows where the produce comes
from (you will find garlic, nuts and per
simmons from Palo Alto). Meat and
cheese are not available, since they might
spoil in the sun. However, fresh fish
from Half Moon Bay is so popular that
people are willing to wait in line for it.
Let's cook a French meal using all these
healthy products. To begin with a French
snack, ypu should buy raw almonds
($2.75 per lb.) and pistachios ($4.50 per
lb.) to give you energy. You may add to
this appetizer pieces of a small
cauliflower (50 cents each) with a real
French dressing (mustard and olive oil).
The meal could start with a big healthy
mixed salad, which is actually an inter
national hors d'oeuvre. For instance, you
could get vine-ripened tomatoes (only 50
cents per lb.), mushrooms (closed caps
at $1.75 per lb. or buttons at $1.60 per
lb.), artichokes (50 cents each), lettuce
heads (40 cents each) and avocado (50
cents for a small, 75 cents for a medium
and $1.25 for a jumbo). Mix all these

ingredients together and serve with a
simple dressing (Italian wine vinegar and
virgin olive oil).
Now, let's cook the French entree. You
have to get fresh fish: English Soles
($5.50 per lb.) or King Salmon ($7.50
per lb.), if you can afford it.
Put the fish in a sheet of aluminum
foil and add garlic (naturally from Gil
roy), slices of lemon, sweet basil and
pepper. Then add some real "creme
fraiche" as much as you like. Do not use
sour cream. Close the aluminum sheets
into a packet and put each one in the
oven. Fifteen or 20 minutes later, you
will have Salmon "en papillotes." You
can cook green and yellow summer
squash (25 cents per lb.) with red grilled
peppers to make a colorful and flavorful
accompaniment.
To finish this wonderful meal, you
could buy pies from B. J. Bull's English
Pastries, which can be found at the en
trance of the market. His pies have been
honored as the"The Bay Area's Best."

Small pies cost $2.75 each and big pies
cost between $7.50 and $10.00 each. The
flavors change with the seasons, and I
tasted the peach/raspberry and strawber
ry/rhubarb pies, both of which were
really delicious.
You could also have berries for dessert.
They are good, inexpensive and you will
get them on the left when you come into
the market. You can choose raspberries
($1.50 a box), blackberries ($2.00) and/or
strawberries ($2.00).
If you feel like gardening — and if you
have enough space — you can get straw
berry plants from Sebastopol ($2.50)
from the same area of the market. Very
important: I advise you to not to forget
to choose a good wine (preferably white)
to go with this meal. You could also dress
up your table with beautiful flowers
(between $2.00 and $4.50 a bunch).
So, here is an outline to cook this
simple French meal using only the best

much money.
