# Nataraja is a hot alternative

Indian restaurants are ev
erywhere these days. Some
serve mediocre food; others of
fer delicious cuisine artfully
prepared by a chef originally
from India.
Nataraja, with its impres
sive array of gourmet Indian
food, belongs to the latter
group.
Prior to 1985, the restau
rant served simple Indian food
in a family-style setting. After
a fire destroyed the restau
rant, new management and
construction led to substantial
changes.
A new chef was hired from
a five-star hotel chain in India.
The menu was revised to boast
a wide variety of Indian
delicacies highlighted by tan
doori — Indian clay oven —
specialties.
Redecoration took place,
giving way to candlelit tables,
Indian art and green plants,
and making the restaurant a
pleasant place to dine.
And speaking of dining,
there are two ways of ordering
food at Nataraja. The first is
to order one of the complete
dinners, which, along with a
main dish, is served with naan
(leavened flour dough cooked
in the tandoor), rice, yellow
daal (lentils), vegetables and a

relish tray.
All of these are priced be
tween $14.95 and $17.95, but
are more than enough for one,
if not two, people.
We chose the second way to
have our dinner, which is to
order a variety of different
dishes & la carte to comprise
a true feast, the same way one
might order at a Chinese res
taurant.
Our dinner began with an
order of samosas, which are
spicy potatoes and peas stuffed
inside a pastry shell and then
deep-fried. Along with the
samosas, we had an order of
assorted pakoras, which are
batter-fried assorted vegeta
bles. Served with mint chut
ney, they were both delicious
preludes to our dinner.
For our next course we
chose an assortment of grilled
meats — fresh fish, lamb
chops, tender chicken and
shish kebab — marinated with
appropriate spices and
mesquite broiled in the tan
door. With this, we had an or
der of onion kulcha (naan
stuffed with spiced onions).
I have eaten tandoori dishes
at different restaurants all
over the Bay Area, as well as
in England and India, and I
discovered right away what
was served to us equalled the
best of what I've tasted.
Next, we tried goa prawn

curry with rice pulao. Once
again, the curry was spicy and
the prawns were cooked per
fectly, creating an absolutely
magnificent dish. By mixing it
with rice and yogurt, you can
regulate the degree of spici
ness, allowing those weary of
spices to enjoy the flavor with
out the heat.
For dessert, we had badam
kheer (a rice pudding) and pis
tachio "saffron" kulfi —
homemade Indian ice cream
flavored with saffron, pistac
hio and cardomon. Both were
delicious and, along with the
masala tea, made a great end
ing to a great meal.
Although the prices are not
cheap, you get what you are
paying for. Indian food is rela
tively new to many people, so
some might not know the dif
ference between a chefs prep
aration versus a more homes
tyle meal.
Once you have tried the food
at Nataraja, not only will you
be experiencing great Indian
food, but great food period.
For these who want to try
the food at Nataraja without
paying the full price for a din
ner, me restaurant does offer
a daily 6-item buffet lunch
with naan and salad for $6.95.
Nataraja, located at the cor
ner of University and Alma,
is open Tuesday through Sun
day for lunch and dinner.
