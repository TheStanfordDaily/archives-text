# Distillery is hard to find and hard to like
## 
### Chrissy D'Angelo Michael Londgren 
Have you ever gone out to
dinner and gotten lost on your
way to the restaurant? And
then, an hour and a half later,
ended up eating at a McDonald's
or 7-Eleven? The Moss Beach
Distillery turned out to be one
of those restaurants that would
have been better left unfound.
Located about 7 miles north
of Half Moon Bay along High
way 1, and a mile dowr> a wind
ing road, the Moss Beach
Distillery is situated on the top
of a small cliff overlooking the
picturesque Pacific.
Unfortunately, a large dirt
mound was located outside our
window, and this view therefore
escaped us.
Forget any visions of crashing
waves, foaming sea mist or
flecks of silvery moonlight on
the ocean. From our seat we
were able to study, in depth, a
large mass of dirt which had
been stationed outside the build
ing for quite some time. As a
lovely side feature, the light
from the deck of the restaurant
shone brightly on the little
mountain, highlighting all its
curvaceous features.
Our intuitions told us to turn
back as we walked through the
entrance.
But we did not, and soon

found ourselves seated in the
bar awaiting our table. Maybe
we went in with expectations
that were too high, but the
formica-topped tables, the
Spuds McKenzie atop a shelf
and the beer mirrors located
throughout were not what we
were expecting.
Nonetheless, we ordered two
appetizers: home-made clam
chowder and potato skins. The
clam chowder, actually, was ex
cellent, and the potato skins
could rival any other potato
skins.
Okay — we thought to our
selves — perhaps we were too
quick to judge. After all, we were
only in the bar, and the first
things we ate gave hope for the
rest of the evening.
This hope proved short-lived.
After eating the appetizers, we
moved into the dining room. The
stained paneling on the walls
was impressive, except for the
fact that these walls, like the
walls in the bar, were adorned
with beer mirrors. Our table was
okay — quaint sitting for two
at a table for four next to a
window that overlooked the
aforementioned mound.
The menu provided a wide as
sortment of entrees, ranging
from Australian lobster to
breast of duck and babv back
