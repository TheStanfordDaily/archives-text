# 'Young Guns II' is a misfire
## 
### Sunil Perkash Staff writer 
The Hollywood western died
about 20 years ago. Still, some
film makers seem to think they
can make another one worthy
of public approval.
As if "Young Guns" hadn't
been enough, this summer we
get "Young Guns II."
The story, if you can call it
that, reunites Billy the Kid
(Emilio Estevez) with the rest
of the surviving Regulators:
"Doc" Scurlock (Kiefer Suther
land) and Chavez Y Chavez
(Lou Diamond Phillips).
Joining them to complete the
new Regulators is Arkansas'
crazy Dave Rudabaugh
(Christian Slater), a 15-year-old
orphan (Balthazar) and farmer
Hendry French (Alan Ruck).
The group of young outlaws,
with The Kid as their leader,
head toward Mexico. The rest
of the movie deals primarily
with their adventures, which in
clude a row with the law and
a stop at a whorehouse.
The first thing that comes to
mind after viewing this film is
this: Why was it ever made?
While the original "Young

Guns" did well at the box office,
it didn't achieve such status
which deserves a sequel. If all
movies with similar success
spawned sequels, there would be
no new material coming to
theaters.
The production seems to be a
muddled attempt to make a
quick dollar based on the
mediocre-at-best success of its
predecessor. Most of the city
shots look like the fake Western
cities everyone has seen at Uni
versal Studios. There are
enough costumed townspeople
to satisfy the director, but they
look like the hired, tired extras
they are.
The movie simply doesn't look
like it takes place in the Old
West at all.
Furthermore, the actors don't
adjust to their roles. Maybe this
can be attributed to the fact that
westerns are just not that
prevalent anymore, so they ha
ven't before experienced such
acting. Estevez, for example,
gives more of a comedian's im
itation of an outlaw rather than
an actor's, adding to the lack of
credibility of the movie.
The screenplay tries to imitate

the witty dialogue that made
previous westerns such as
"Butch Cassidy and the Sun
dance Kid" and "How the West
Was Won" popular and critical
successes. However, it doesn't
work in this film for no other
reason than it's not well thought
out.
Another problem with this
film is the mess created with
almost all of the shoot-'em-dead
action scenes. Aside from the
fact that they're hard to watch
and could give viewers serious
headaches, they aren't even im
portant to the story — they
seem to be there only for the
sake of violence.
And speaking of violence, this
film is much more violent than
one would expect from a PG-13
rating. At times it is even gro
tesque, as in the scene where
Phillips graphically pulls a knife
out of his arm.
For those who have a summer
thirst for a good Western,
"Young Guns II" is not the
movie to see. Not even a theme
song by Bon Jovi can save this
picture. You would do much bet
ter to check out the "Westerns"
section of your local video store.

Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips return with new "Regulators" to rampage
through the Old West as an outlaw brat pack in "Young Guns II." Despite a plot centered on the
exciting life of Billy the Kid, this movie doesn't deliver the adventure it promises.
