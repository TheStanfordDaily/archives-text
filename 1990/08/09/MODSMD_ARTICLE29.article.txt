# 'The Freshman' does not pass
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
Life as a college freshman is usually not nearly
as exciting as the experiences Matthew Broderick
has in"The Freshman."
However, if I recall correctly, it was better than
most of the time I spent watching this movie.
"The Freshman" stars Marlon Brando, Mat
thew Broderick and Bruno Kirby in a lighthearted
tale about a newcomer to college — and New
York — who gets caught up with the Mafia.
Broderick, as Clark Kellogg, the freshman from
Vermont, is picked up for a taxi ride from Grand
Central Station by Kirby, who steals all his money
and clothing. Welcome to the beginning of every
freshman's first-day-at-school nightmare.
As if things weren't bad enough, Kellogg soon
discovers his film school director has no feelings
of pity or sympathy for him, and the required
textbooks for the class (all coincidentally written
by the professor himself), will cost about seven
hundred dollars. This part seems believable to
me. I wonder why?
Strangely enough, Kellogg runs into his original
malefactor, Kirby, and chases him down. All Kirby
can offer to make up for the fact that he lost
all of Kellogg's money gambling is a job. Of
course, our adolescent hero is interested.
This chance for employment to reconstitute his

depleted funds brings Kellogg in contact with
Carmine Sabatini, played by Marlon Brando.
In one of the funniest scenes of the movie,
Brando plays off his earlier "Godfather" work to
parody this head of the Mafia family. He uses
the same voice and mannerisms that made Don
Corlione such a memorable character.
Of course, Brando carries a lot more weight
now than he did then, and I don't mean as an
actor. This guy rivals Dom DeLuise in the spare
tire department.
Despite his lack of physical youth, Brando's
acting is adequately vigorous. In all the
actors perform decently. One must surmise, there
fore, that the inadequacies of this film lie in its
plot and screenplay.
Despite the amusing characterization of Car
mine Sabatini as a jolly Don Corlione and the
comedic talent of Bruno Kirby, much of the movie
drags along, unable to elicit more than a Tew
chuckles here and there.
As a whole, "The Freshman" is mediocre. As
has happened before, Hollywood has managed to
restrain the talent of a high-powered cast by
giving it bland material.
While I wouldn't say that this flick is bad, I
wouldn't really recommend it. But, if you'd like
to see Marlon Brando poke fun at himself, and
you've got spare time and money, you might want
to give it a try.
