# The 						Time returns, and it's about time

In 1984, Morris Day "pledged
allegiance to The Time," or so
he claimed in a song on the
band's breakthrough "Ice
Cream Castles" album.
By 1985, Day broke that
pledge and declared a new alle
giance — to himself. The block
buster success of Prince's
"Purple Rain" — and Day's sup
porting role in that film — led
him to believe that acting and
solo music careers were his cho
sen paths.
While Day spent five years not
landing many movie roles and
only producing one aimost-hit
song, his former bandmates
were becoming powerhouses in
the music industry. Jimmy Jam
and Terry Lewis became one of
the hottest musical pairs,
thanks to their work with Bobby

Brown, Janet Jackson and many
others. Jellybean Johnson found
similar success with dance
mixes.
Now that the boys are big
enough to share the stage with
Day, it is time once again for
The Time. Brought together in
part for Prince's new film,
"Graffiti Bridge," the Minneap
olis party-dance band has
released possibly their best al
bum to date.
From the bass groove of "Jerk
Out" to the dance metal
"Blondie" and silky smooth
"Donald Trump (Black Ver
sion)," Day et al. have assembled
a strong collection kept afloat
by solid music rather than at
tempts to create new dance
crazes (& la past hits "The Bird"
and"The Walk.")
It appears that time off has
been good to The Time.
