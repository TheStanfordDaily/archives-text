# Local ‘Tempest' is creative

Watching the Stanford Drama Department's
production of "The Tempest" isn't unlike going
to an eccentric costume party, where each new
character who makes an entrance is a little more
outrageous than those we've already met.
A tempest strikes a ship at sea, and the crew
is miraculously tossed onto an island unharmed
and with their clothing dry.
Prospero, who resides there, has taken charge
of the island after discovering the magical powers
available to him. His companions are his radiant
daughter Miranda, the friendly spirit Ariel and
Caliban, the inarticulate beast whom Prospero
has adopted and enslaved. Antonio, who has
usurped the throne of Milan from his brother
Prospero, is on the ship, along with Alonso, the
King of Naples, and Sabina, the King's sister.
Director David Saltz highlights the buoyant
qualities of this complex play, and is consistent
with his original approach. He doesn't let the
actors become mired down in the language, and
the few times they do, as in the difficult scene
when Antonio (David Kurtz) entices Sabina (Mari
Tamburo) to murder her brother and steal his
crown, Saltz is careful to convey the events
through visual action.
Instead of staging the traditional wedding
masque scene, he boldly chooses to have it take
place only in the minds of the young lovers Fer
dinand and Miranda. They envision the ceremony
of their marriage, and then don straw hats and
do a hoedown to celebrate.
At first this appears anachronistic, but with
the bizarre way the other characters behave at
the mercy of Ariel's spells and Prospero's magic,
it's evident that this is an island where anything
can happen.
As Prospero, veteran actor Frank Widman is
lighthearted and full of mischief. He takes joy in
watching the effect of his magic on the
shipwrecked newcomers. Widman expresses
Prospero's complex emotions in a subtle way.

Ariel, played by David Thompson, never ap
pears on stage in human form. We recognize his
presence through light, music and a voice that's
manipulated with special effects that sometimes
resemble the voice o r Mercedes McCambridge in
"The Exorcist."
John Wilson's 18th century-style costumes are
flattering, but his set, painted in thick, multi
colored strokes, distracts from the flow of action.
While the design invokes a magical setting, the
bright oranges and yellows are an obstruction to
believing the island is a real place.
"The Tempest" plays through Aug. 12 in the
Little Theater. For ticket information, call the
Stanford Drama Department at 723-2576.
