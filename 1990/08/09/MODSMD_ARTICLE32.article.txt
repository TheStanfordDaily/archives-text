## Azzi, Henning, rebounding lead U.S. to another title Americans crush Soviets 82-70 in Goodwill finale

Another tournament, another gold medal.
Such is the life of the U.S. basketball team.
No, not the men's squad that once dominated
international competition; they've lost three
major international events in the past three years.
It's the U.S. women that are the sport's current
dynasty.
After cruising to the gold medal at the Goodwill
Games, crushing the Soviet Union in the finals,
the Americans have now gone 42-0 since the
1984 Olympics. And the world doesn't show any
signs of catching up.
At least no team at the Goodwill Games showed
signs of catching up, or even keeping up, with
the wide-open style of play the U.S. team used.
The Americans, led by star rebonder Katrina
McClain, outmuscled the opposition inside. Then
they got the ball to point guards Jennifer Azzi
and Sonja Henning, or maybe off guards Cynthia
Cooper and Teresa Edwards. Then, before anyone
knew what happened, it was usually a layup, and
two more points on the scoreboard.
The U.S. beat the Soviets 82-70 in the final
Sunday in a game that was not nearly as close
as the score indicated. The home team took a
43-33 lead into halftime and went on a 16-1 spree
early after intermission.
When Henning, a Stanford senior, hit a two
pointer from right inside the three-point line
with five and a half minutes remaining, the Amer
icans led by 25. The U.S was held without a field

goal the rest of the way, but their defense — the
Soviets shot only 35 percent — and rebounding
kept the game firmly out of reach.
McClain had 15 points for the U.S. and set
the tone with 14 rebounds. "That's my strong
point," she said. "I like to think I can dominate
a game on the boards."
Soviet center Natalia Zassoulskaia, who had 23
when the two teams met in pool play (an 86-78
U.S. win), agreed that McClain was dominant.
"She's a very strong player and some of the time,
it was very unpleasant," she said.
The team can now add the Goodwill Games
gold medal to their 1986 Goodwill Games title,
their 1988 Olympic gold medal and the World
Championship they won three weeks ago in
Malaysia. But they continue to look for ways to
improve.
"We've won all the things we can possibly win,
but that's not enough for us. We want to win it
again," said Cooper, a veteran of two Olympic
gold-medal teams.
Edwards, who was awesome in the open court,
led the way with 16 points.
Azzi had nine points and Henning added a pair.
While Henning will return to Stanford in an
attempt to lead the Cardinal to back-to-back
NCAA titles, Azzi will take her degree to Italy,
where she will play professionally.
The Americans reached the gold medal game
by hammering Bulgaria 106-67 in the semifinals.
In the semifinal rout, the Stanford twosome
was perfect. Azzi was 3-for-3 from the field, in
cluding a pair of three-pointers, and 2-for-2 from
the free throw line for 10 points while Henning
made the only shot she took.

Jennifer Azzi helped the U.S. team to both the world championship
and the Goodwill Games title this summer. She is now off to Italy for
life as a pro.
