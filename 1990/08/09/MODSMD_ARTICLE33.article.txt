# Rouse just misses new world record

It appears swimmers never
learn the lesson of having re
spect for their elders. That
became obvious last week at
the U.S. Long Course Nation
als in Austin, Texas, as a
parade of youngsters came in
and tried to steal the spotlight
from the sport's established
stars.
While old hands like Tom
Jager, 25, and David Whar
ton, 21, each won races, there
seemed to be more teenagers
on the awards stand than at
the average Bon Jovi concert.
Fifteen-year-old Tori DeSil
via won the 100-meter breast
stroke, edging 14-year-old
Emily Short and 16-year-old
Mary Ellen Blanchard; 17-
year-olds Jenny Thompson
and Nicole Haislett each beat
U.S. sprint queen Leigh Ann
Fetter; and all eight finalists
in the 200-meter individual
medley were in their teens,
led by winner Summer
Sanders, 17.
But despite all the changes,
Stanford's top male and
female swimmers, Jeff Rouse,
20, and Janet Evans, still only
18, both shone brightly and
earned berths on the U.S.
team for the world champi
onships. That meet will be
held the first two weeks of
January in Perth, Australia,
with Stanford women's Coach
Richard Quick in chanrge of
the American squad.
Evans will be competing in
four events: the 200-meter,
400-meter and 800-meter
freestyle, and the 400-meter
IM. Rouse will swim both the
100-meter and 200-meter
backstroke at the meet and

June graduate Jill Johnson
will swim the 200-meter
breaststroke.
Sanders, who will be a Car
dinal freshman in the fall,
will swim the 200-meter but
terfly as well as the 200- and
400-meter IM.
Rouse will swim the same
two events for a U.S. team
competing in an international
meet in Rome this weekend
and incoming freshman
Pamela Minthorn will swim
the 200-meter butterfly for
the U.S. women. Junior Dede
Trimble is also competing in
that meet, in the 200-meter
backstroke.
Both Evans and Sanders
got off to a good start in the
meet early last week in Texas,
as did Rouse, who swam the
third-fastest time ever swum
by an American to win the
200-meter backstroke. Rouse
did even better last Friday,
winning the 100-meter back
stroke in 54.86 seconds. His
time of 54.79 in the prelimi
naries is the second-fastest
ever swum, only .28 seconds
off the world record.
Sanders won the 200-meter
IM last Thursday by more
than a second over Blanchard.
Sanders also placed second to
Olympian, and California
Golden Bear, Trina Radke, in
the 200-meter butterfly. Min
thorn placed third in that
event.
Evans won the 800-meter
freestyle Friday by 13 seconds
and placed third in the 200-
backstroke Saturday.
Junior Alex Kostich
finished fifth in the men's 1
1,500-meter freestyle and
senior Barb Metz placed third
in the women's 1,500.
