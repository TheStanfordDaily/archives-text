# Patrick, MacMurdo head to Europe
## 
### 
Even though school is not in
session, senior John Patrick and
junior Chris MacMurdo get to
go on a field trip.
The two will both spend two
weeks in Germany as members
of the Pacific 10 Conference All-
Star team that will be competing
there. The league annually
sends a 10-person team on a
summer tour as a way of pro
viding a lot of great experience,
basketball and otherwise, to a
member of each team in the con
ference.
Last year Deshon Wingate
and Katy Steding made the trip
to Hungary with the Pac-10
teams and it paid off for both
of them. Wingate established
himself as the top rebounder for
the team that went 6-0 in Hun
gary. He returned to campus

with more confidence and
earned a starting spot midway
through last season.
He was near the top of the
Cardinal stats in both scoring
and rebounding.
Steding was already a star
before her trip to Hungary,
where the Pac-10 women went
4-2. But the experience helped
her have her best season the
following winter and she and her
teammates took home the
NCAA title.
Patrick, from Vienna, Vir.,
was named the Cardinal's Most
Improved Player last year. After
seeing limited action his first
two years, he started every game
at point guard for Stanford last
season and averaged 7.7 points
and 3.8 assists per game.
MacMurdo, from Aiken, S.C.,

is a third-year sophomore after
a back injury forced her to red
shirt as a freshman. She is a
small forward who can also play
inside and she averaged almost
10 minutes a game last year in
a reserve role.
The men begin with a tour
nament in Leverkusen, which
will feature area teams as well
as the NIT All-Stars. That tour
nament runs Friday through
Sunday. They will play TTL
Hamburg Aug. 14, Ulm BBC
Aug. 16 and Giessen BBC Aug.
19 before returning home.
The women open with a pair
against Agon Dusseldorf Friday
and Sunday, then meet
Leverkusen Mondry. They also
face Hagen Aug. 15 and 16 and
Barmen Wuppertal Aug. 18 and
19.
