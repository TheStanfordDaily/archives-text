# Football frosh set to report next week
## 
### 
It may still seem like the
middle of summer vacation, but
football season is just around
the corner.
The exhibition season has al
ready started in the NFL and
starting Tuesday, members of
the Stanford football team will
return to campus for the 1990
season. That is the day that the
team's freshmen will report.
Stanford's incoming class,
ranked in the nation's top 20
by many publications, consists
of 16 players and a few walk
ons. Leading the way is outside
linebacker Hartwell Brown,
from Los Alamitos, Calif.
Several other freshman have a
chance to contribute greatly this
fall.
Freshman practice begins
next Wednesday with two-a-days
for the frosh running through
Aug. 18.
The upperclassmen then
report Aug. 19 for picture day
that afternoon. Full practices
are from 8:30-10:30 in the morn
ing and 3:30-6 p.m. Monday

through Saturday of each of the
next two weeks.
Stanford will begin single
practices Sept. 3 and 4 and will
depart for Boulder, Colo., Sept.
5. The team opens the 1990 cam
paign Thursday night, Sept. 6,
against Colorado at the Buf
faloes' Folsom Field. The game
will be televised live on ESPN,
begining at 5 p.m. PDT.
The Cardinal's second game
will also be on the road, at
UCI.A. Both that game, Sept.
15, and Big Game, Nov. 17 in
Berkeley, will begin at 3:30 p.m.
and will be shown live on Prime
Ticket Network, and will likely
be shown locally on the Pacific
Sports Network. The Stanford-
USC game at Stanford Stadium
Oct. 13 will also be televised. It
will be seen live nationally on
ABC with a 12:30 p.m. start,
the same as all other Cardinal
home games this year.
Season tickets are still avail
able, but the game at Notre
Dame Oct. 6 has already been
declared a sell-out. Stanford

hosts Oregon State (Sept. 22),
San Jose State (Sept. 29), USC,
Washington (Oct. 20) and Wash
ington State (Nov. 3) this
season.
In addition to the road games
at Colorado, UCLA, Notre Dame
and California, the Cardinal also
visits Oregon Oct. 27 and Ari
zona Nov. 10.
Stanford has 53 letterwinners
returning and 17 starters back
from last year's team which
went 3-8 overall, 3-5 in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
The team should be strong on
offense with running backs Glyn
Milburn, Jon Volpe, Tom Var
dell, Ellery Roberts, J.J. Lasley
and Galen Foster returning to
provide perhaps the team's best
depth ever at that position. Led
by All-America candidate Ed
McCaffrey and Jon Pinckney,
the team's wide receivers corps
will also be very good.
Defensively, the team will be
led by inside linebacker Jono
Tunney and cornerback Kevin
Scott.
