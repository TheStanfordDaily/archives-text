# August brings visitors, work for admissions staff
## 
### Mary B. Haban Staff writer 
John Bunnell is a very busy man. As
director of freshman admissions, he —
with the help of 12 other deans and
directors — has already mapped out the
1990-91 year. And the summer isn't even
over yet!
Those not familiar with Bunnell's job
may think reviewing applications and
making decisions is his primary concern.
But, according to Bunnell, that's only
part of it. A small part.
As the summer progresses, revising
the catalog, updating literature and pre
paring next year's applications will be
added to his list of tasks.
But Bunnell explained that it's the
hundreds of visitors, especially during

August, that make summer the busiest
time of the year.
"On some days, there are so many
people we have to move our information
sessions to a larger room," Bunnell said.
"We want to try to accommodate every
one, rather than turning people away."
Group information sessions provide
prospective students and their parents
with a glimpse of what being a Stanford
undergraduate is all about. The sessions,
held twice a day, are divided into two
parts, with parents' issues addressed in
one, and students' in the other.
"Separate sessions are beneficial be
cause parents' concerns are different
from those of the student," Bunnell said.
"Questions pertaining to financial aid
and different support services are usually
asked by parents."

Following the information session, a
special admissions tour completes the
visit to Stanford. Unlike the regular tour,
it fbcuses on prospective applicants and
answers any questions they have about
Stanford. "The guide can share the ex
periences they have had as a student,
describe the atmosphere and reveal the
mystery of what makes a Stanford stu
dent tick," Bunnell said.
In addition to assisting students visit
ing the campus, he and the rest of the
admissions staff do a lot of legwork to
keep the Stanford name in the minds of
students. Visiting over 700 high schools
and traveling to about 43 states each
year is just the start.
"We conduct regional meetings in most
states where students from that partic
ular area can come and meet with an

admissions representative," Bunnell said.
"Since it is impossible to visit every high
school, this is an effective way to provide
students with information about Stan
ford."
Admissions staff members also partic
ipate in college nights and meet with
high school guidance counselors, to help
students select the right college. Bunnell
knows that Stanford may not be the
right school for everyone, and one of his
missions is to provide all the information
a student needs to make the correct
choice.
Bunnell said, "We want to generate
interest, we want students to go away
from here with a positive feeling, and
think, 'Hey, this would be a great place
to go to college.' "
