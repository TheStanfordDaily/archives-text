# Custodians are still unsure about work benefits

Custodians at Tresidder
Union are still in the dark about
future work benefits with the
new contractor American Build
ing Maintenance.
The University's procurement
department is reportedly still
working on the specific terms
of the contract. As of yesterday,
the company has not heard of
ficially that it has won the bid,
according to Robert Ramirez,
vice president of ABM's college
and university division.
The custodians, who received
layoff notices July 10, had until

yesterday to decide whether or
not to "bump," or take other
Stanford jobs and replace union
workers of lesser seniority.
Because the workers have not
yet received benefit information,
Rodney Barnette, field represen
tative of the United Stanford
Workers union, said he re
quested a third extension for the
decision deadline Tuesday from
the employee relations division
of Human Resources Services.
Keith Smith, manager of em
ployee relations, confirmed that
the extension has been granted.
According to Barnette, an
Aug. 1 letter from Bobbrie
Brown of employee relations in

formed the custodians that "in
formation regarding the benefits
will be provided by the contrac
tor." Workers also said they
were told by their supervisors
that the contractor would con
tact them last week, which never
happened.
Paul Ortega, a 30-year cus
todian, said he plans to work
for the contractor. He said he
does not want to bump another
Stanford worker â€” "Why hurt
somebody?
"All you hear is a bunch of
rumors," Ortega said, on the
promises that the custodians
will be informed about work
benefits.

Barnette said he believes the
proposal Tresidder submitted to
the procurement department is
lacking a clause which requires
the new contractor to rehire the
laid-off Tresidder workers first.
Such a provision is guaranteed
by the current USW-Stanford
contract.
Barnette said information
about work hours, shifts and
days off are still not available,
and the union has filed a com
plaint to the National Labor Re
lations Board alleging that the
workers have not been provided
with "relevant information per
taining to grievances or poten
tial grievances."

Tresidder management and
Karen Mackie Jones, the con
tract specialist in the procure
ment department, could not be
reached for comment.
Joe Smith, a representative
for ABM workers from Local
1877 of the Service Employees'
Union, said he is relieved the
custodians are protected from
becoming non-union employees.
Should they decide to work
for the contractors, the cus
todians will be protected by the
agreement between Local 1877
and the San Mateo County
Building Maintenance Contrac
tors Association.
