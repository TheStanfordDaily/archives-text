# Campbell to serve on science board

W. Glenn Campbell, counselor
and former director of the Hoo
ver Institution, leans back com
fortably in his chair in his
spacious office in Hoover Tower.
"I was honored," he says in
reference to being nominated by
President Bush to the National
Science Board, the governing
body of the National Science
Foundation. The appointment
will be the second for Campbell,
who served on the board from
1972 to 1978.
The foundation designs na
tional science policy and awards
federal grants for basic science
research.
With funds of more than $2
billion per year, the foundation,
according to Campbell, is one of
the largest in the world. To be
involved in the allocation of
some of these funds is a prospect
which appeals greatly to him.
"Last time," he says,"I didn't
even bother to get on the grant

committee. I just
concentrated my
efforts on the
science policy
committee and
the nominating
committee."
Some of the
foundation's
money is alloca-

ted to the states to finance im
provements of school science
programs. The main thrust of
the foundation, however, has
been funding research in the
"hard sciences," and projects ex
ploring industrial applications of
science.
Biological sciences receive the
largest amount of funding from
the foundation, but some money
is also allocated to econometrics,
the history of science and the
social sciences.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley, of
which Campbell is a senior
regent, are frequent recipients


Campbell
of NSF grants. Once on
the board, however, Campbell
will not be allowed to vote on
grants to either institution due
to a conflict of interest.
Although he has no specific
projects to bring to the founda
tion, there are some things
Campbell would like to
accomplish while on the board.
For instance, he would like to
"force astronomers to raise
more private money," and he
would vote against grants to
fund econometric studies, which
he feels use "unreal assump
tions to reach silly conclusions."
An economist with a Ph.D.
from Harvard, Campbell feels
his background in cost-benefit
analysis will be of great use in
assuring that the foundation's
funds are effectively spent.
Indeed, Campbell takes a very
practical view of the founda
tion's role in formulating and
funding national science policy.
Its primary responsibility, he
says, is to determine the best
possible division of money to
fund basic research and to see
that this research is applied
properly.
"The major thing is to always
concentrate on quality as
against quantity," to assure
money is not wasted, he main
tains.
Campbell's term with the Na
tional Science Foundation will
run until May 1994. Despite his
new responsibilities, Campbell
will remain in his present posi
tion at the Hoover Institution,
and will continue working on a
book about his experiences
there.
