W. Glenn Campbell, counselor
and former director of the Hoo
ver Institution, leans back com
fortably in his chair in his
spacious office in Hoover Tower.
"I was honored," he says in
reference to being nominated by
President Bush to the National
Science Board, the governing
body of the National Science
Foundation. The appointment
will be the second for Campbell,
who served on the board from
1972 to 1978.
The foundation designs na
tional science policy and awards
federal grants for basic science
research.
With funds of more than $2
billion per year, the foundation,
according to Campbell, is one of
the largest in the world. To be
involved in the allocation of
some of these funds is a prospect
which appeals greatly to him.
"Last time," he says,"I didn't
even bother to get on the grant

committee. I just
concentrated my
efforts on the
science policy
committee and
the nominating
committee."
Some of the
foundation's
money is alloca-

ted to the states to finance im
provements of school science
programs. The main thrust of
the foundation, however, has
been funding research in the
"hard sciences," and projects ex
ploring industrial applications of
science.
Biological sciences receive the
largest amount of funding from
the foundation, but some money
is also allocated to econometrics,
the history of science and the
social sciences.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley, of
which Campbell is a senior
regent, are frequent recipients
