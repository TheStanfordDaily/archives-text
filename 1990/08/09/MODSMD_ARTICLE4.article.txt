# Quake repairs take time, funds and planning
## 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
It's been more than nine
months since the Loma Prieta
earthquake rocked Stanford,
but the University has yet to
assess all its construction needs,

finalize a time line or raise the
funds necessary to complete its
earthquake repairs.
Since October, restoration
work has begun in several of
the hardest-hit residences, in
cluding Columbae, Durand,
Roth, Theta Xi and some Es

condido Village apartments.
Crews also have been repainting,
patching plaster and rebuilding
chimneys in buildings that re
quire less repair. Repairs in
Hammarskjold began last
Monday.
Unfortunately, however, prog

ress has been slower for many
other buildings on campus.
Reconstruction designs for
Memorial Church, the Stanford
Museum and both the Geology
and Language Corners will take
at least another year to com
plete, according to Gene
Kershner, associate director of
facilities project management.
In the first evaluation, struc
tural engineers thought the
dome of Memorial Church would
need to be temporarily removed
in order to repair the four piers
that support it. However, en
gineers are working to avoid this
$15 million job, Kershner said.
Even for some buildings with
completed designs, such as
Buildings 370, 310 and 300, con
struction has not begun. Their
stumbling block is lack of fund
ing.
For more than 20 buildings,
the University is still negotiat
ing with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency for repair
money. FEMA makes money
available to non-profit groups
for disaster relief.
As early as November, FEMA
gave funding to the Graduate
School of Business to fill cracked
concrete walls with an epoxy in
jection, Kershner said.
However, FEMA has not been
as liberal with funding for some
of the older buildings with more
costly damage — especially
those with mechanical and elec
trical systems not in compliance
with building codes, he added.
Kershner said the ongoing
debate between Stanford and
FEMA is "What is the minimum
fix?"
FEMA allocates its funds
solely for the purpose of bring
ing buildings up to their pre
quake conditions, Kershner
said. However, in many cases
the pre-quake condition is not
"up to code," he added.
For instance, some buildings
with unreinforced masonry
were not earthquake-proof to
begin with. To bring these up
to code, engineers want to build
concrete walls next to the
sandstone ones, he said.
In other places the mortar
bonds between bricks were
weakened, which concerns en
gineers since some sandstone

buildings actually depend on the
strength of interior brick walls.
The University believes these
buildings require new walls, but
FEMA doesn't want the project
to be so costly.
FEMA ensures that repairs
will keep buildings from collaps
ing, but the University wants
to do more — it wants to ensure
that classes could be held in the
buildings the day after a
quake.
Kershner said he hopes nego
tiations will end soon and FEMA
will make all its remaining fund
ing decisions by next month.
FEMA could pay approxi
mately $70 million for repairs,
Kershner said, but at this stage
in negotiations, he is still guess
ing — the figure could be as
low as $30 million.
Kershner estimated the cost
for bringing all buildings up to
code at $100 million. Regardless
of the amount of FEMA aid,
Stanford will have to pay mil
lions.
Because the University self
insures, Stanford did not have
earthquake insurance, said John
Hughes, assistant provost for
planning and management.
Stanford opted to put aside
some money each year in a self
insurance emergency fund in
stead of paying a high premium
for a policy which would not
cover repairs for many of the
older buildings, Hughes added.
Since the quake, Stanford has
taken approximately $3.2 mil
lion from the fund. Most of this
was used to clean up debris, re
locate faculty, staff and students
and reopen buildings.
Besides the self-insurance
fund, additional money from the
University will come from three
sources — money in the facili
ties reserve, an outside loan and
donations.
Stanford took $3.6 million
from the approximately $6 mil
lion facilities reserve for earth
quake repair-related projects
this year, he said. Next year they
may take $2.8 million from the
reserve, he added.
The University also plans to
acquire long-term debt by bor
rowing an estimated $1 million

each year for 10 years to fund
earthquake repairs, Hughes
said.
In addition, Stanford hopes to
raise $40 million from dona
tions, according to Dick Bennett,
associate director of develop
ment.
Since October there have been
about 3,000 small gifts totaling

approximately $2 million. Now
the University will solicit large
donors, Bennett said, but "The
campaign (to raise earthquake
repair funds) is barely getting
under way."
If funding comes through
soon, Buildings 370, 310 and
300 will begin to be repaired as
early as this fall, Hughes said.
Unfortunately, however, even
when construction starts, the
smaller Quad buildings will take
about eight months and the
larger projects about 18 months

to complete, according to
Kershner.
Consequently, temporary
structures, such as the trailers
in Wilbur Hall parking lot and
Roble field, will be on campus
at least three more years,
Kershner said.
In the completely hypothetical
situation that there were no
problems with funding, it would
take at least four or five years
for everything to return to nor
mal, Hughes said.

cover repairs for many of the
older buildings, Hughes added.
Since the quake, Stanford has
taken approximately $3.2 mil
lion from the fund. Most of this
was used to clean up debris, re
locate faculty, staff and students
and reopen buildings.
Besides the self-insurance
fund, additional money from the
University will come from three
sources — money in the facili
ties reserve, an outside loan and
donations.
Stanford took $3.6 million
from the approximately $6 mil
lion facilities reserve for earth
quake repair-related projects
this year, he said. Next year they
may take $2.8 million from the
reserve, he added.
The University also plans to
acquire long-term debt by bor
rowing an estimated $1 million

each year for 10 years to fund
earthquake repairs, Hughes
said.
In addition, Stanford hopes to
raise $40 million from dona
tions, according to Dick Bennett,
associate director of develop
ment.
Since October there have been
about 3,000 small gifts totaling

approximately $2 million. Now
the University will solicit large
donors, Bennett said, but "The
campaign (to raise earthquake
repair funds) is barely getting
under way."
If funding comes through
soon, Buildings 370, 310 and
300 will begin to be repaired as
early as this fall, Hughes said.
Unfortunately, however, even
when construction starts, the
smaller Quad buildings will take
about eight months and the
larger projects about 18 months

to complete, according to
Kershner.
Consequently, temporary
structures, such as the trailers
in Wilbur Hall parking lot and
Roble field, will be on campus
at least three more years,
Kershner said.
In the completely hypothetical
situation that there were no
problems with funding, it would
take at least four or five years
for everything to return to nor
mal, Hughes said.
It's been more than nine
months since the Loma Prieta
earthquake rocked Stanford,
but the University has yet to
assess all its construction needs,

finalize a time line or raise the
funds necessary to complete its
earthquake repairs.
Since October, restoration
work has begun in several of
the hardest-hit residences, in
cluding Columbae, Durand,
Roth, Theta Xi and some Es

condido Village apartments.
Crews also have been repainting,
patching plaster and rebuilding
chimneys in buildings that re
quire less repair. Repairs in
Hammarskjold began last
Monday.
Unfortunately, however, prog

ress has been slower for many
other buildings on campus.
Reconstruction designs for
Memorial Church, the Stanford
Museum and both the Geology
and Language Corners will take
at least another year to com
plete, according to Gene
Kershner, associate director of
facilities project management.
In the first evaluation, struc
tural engineers thought the
dome of Memorial Church would
need to be temporarily removed
in order to repair the four piers
that support it. However, en
gineers are working to avoid this
$15 million job, Kershner said.
Even for some buildings with
completed designs, such as
Buildings 370, 310 and 300, con
struction has not begun. Their
stumbling block is lack of fund
ing.
For more than 20 buildings,
the University is still negotiat
ing with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency for repair
money. FEMA makes money
available to non-profit groups
for disaster relief.
As early as November, FEMA
gave funding to the Graduate
School of Business to fill cracked
concrete walls with an epoxy in
jection, Kershner said.
However, FEMA has not been
as liberal with funding for some
of the older buildings with more
costly damage — especially
those with mechanical and elec
trical systems not in compliance
with building codes, he added.
Kershner said the ongoing
debate between Stanford and
FEMA is "What is the minimum
fix?"
FEMA allocates its funds
solely for the purpose of bring
ing buildings up to their pre
quake conditions, Kershner
said. However, in many cases
the pre-quake condition is not
"up to code," he added.
For instance, some buildings
with unreinforced masonry
were not earthquake-proof to
begin with. To bring these up
to code, engineers want to build
concrete walls next to the
sandstone ones, he said.
In other places the mortar
bonds between bricks were
weakened, which concerns en
gineers since some sandstone

buildings actually depend on the
strength of interior brick walls.
The University believes these
buildings require new walls, but
FEMA doesn't want the project
to be so costly.
FEMA ensures that repairs
will keep buildings from collaps
ing, but the University wants
to do more — it wants to ensure
that classes could be held in the
buildings the day after a
quake.
Kershner said he hopes nego
tiations will end soon and FEMA
will make all its remaining fund
ing decisions by next month.
FEMA could pay approxi
mately $70 million for repairs,
Kershner said, but at this stage
in negotiations, he is still guess
ing — the figure could be as
low as $30 million.
Kershner estimated the cost
for bringing all buildings up to
code at $100 million. Regardless
of the amount of FEMA aid,
Stanford will have to pay mil
lions.
Because the University self
insures, Stanford did not have
earthquake insurance, said John
Hughes, assistant provost for
planning and management.
Stanford opted to put aside
some money each year in a self
insurance emergency fund in
stead of paying a high premium
for a policy which would not
cover repairs for many of the
older buildings, Hughes added.
Since the quake, Stanford has
taken approximately $3.2 mil
lion from the fund. Most of this
was used to clean up debris, re
