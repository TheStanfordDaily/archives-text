"It's a complicated situation, . . . and
scary," but the "United States is doing
the right thing" in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis,
according to James Noyes, a Hoover In
stitution research fellow who specializes
in the Middle East.
According to Noyes, the United States
needs only to crush Iraq's economy to
resolve the crisis. The Middle Eastern
country is already impoverished and
depends heavily on the outside world for
agricultural goods.
Due to his slight knowledge of the
Western world, Iraqi leader Saddam Hus
sein did not foresee the unanimous dis
approval of his actions across the globe
— a costly blunder, Noyes said.
The U.S. military presence in Saudi
Arabia threatens Hussein's most attrac
tive strategy — to gain control of one of
the West's major sources of oil. If Hussein
can overcome the Saudis, the Iraqis will
be able to seize a major pipeline for their
oil as well as a dangerous hold on the
Arab world and the global oil market.
An array of unpleasant events could
follow: high oil prices, possible blackmail
of the West and oil panic.
Fortunately, Hussein probably will not
invade Saudi Arabia with American

troops present and ready for combat, said
Noyes. Hussein is not prepared to take
on U.S. and other air power.
In addition, with Turkey shutting off
another major Iraqi pipeline, in compli
ance with a U.S. suggest, n, the Iraqis
will be placed in even m .j rf an eco
nomic crunch. Eventually, Hussein will
be forced to remove his troops from
Kuwait, Noyes believes.
In the meantime, as a precaution,
Noyes suggested that Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and others should crank up
their oil production to ensure there will
not be an oil panic.
Presently, Noyes does not foresee any
reckless moves from Hussein. He said,
"most likely," the U.S. troops "won't be
tested." Since the Iran hostage situation,
the U.S. military has spent years plan
ning and training for the type of war
endemic to the Middle East, Noyes
pointed out.
