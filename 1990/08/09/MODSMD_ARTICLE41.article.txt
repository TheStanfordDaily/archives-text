## 
### Dionne Scott Staff writer 
Luckily for Kuwaiti student
Sandeep Bhatia, his family is on
vacation in Delhi, India, and has
escaped the Iraqi invasion. How
ever, his father still remains in
Kuwait as a "duty to his na
tion."
Bhatia, along with two other
Kuwaiti students participating
in the Stanford high school pro
gram, anxiously await the end
of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. He
said he has not heard from his
father for a week.
Bhatia said he is worried that
when his visa expires at the end
of the Stanford program, he will
be illegally staying in the United
States. All of his family's bank
accounts around the world have
been frozen, he said.
Bhatia added that although he
has contacted the State Depart
ment four days ago, he has not
heard from the officials.
