Police halt search
for Foothills rapist
The Stanford Police's search
for the man who robbed and
raped a woman at gunpoint on
June 16 in the Foothills has
come to a halt.
According to Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, five officers
had been conducting a thor
ough investigation but have ex
hausted all current leads and
are no longer actively searching
for the suspect.
Over the course of the inves
tigation, police have compiled
a binder containing photo
graphs of some 150 suspects.
However, the victim — who
was formerly cooperating with
police — has decided not to
participate any further.
According to Niemeyer, the
victim's mother said her
daughter would like to move
on with her life and put the
incident behind her.
Although active searching
has ceased, Niemeyer is con
tinuing to caution people who
frequent the Foothills area to
be cautious. The suspect has

not been caught; in addition,
there is always the possibility
a copycat rapist will strike,
Niemeyer warned.
Police are still requesting in
formation on the case, and will
follow up any new leads they
receive.
The suspect is a white male,
in his mid-20s, 6 feet 2 inches
