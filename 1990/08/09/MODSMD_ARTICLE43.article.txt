# New catheter saves infants
## Stanford doctors successfully use new, risky technique

Stanford University physi
cians are the first in Northern
California to report the success
ful use of a new, less invasive
technique for life support of in
fants with severe lung damage.
This improvement in the pow
erful but risky therapy called
Extra-Corporeal Membrane
Oxygenation — known as
ECMO — may speed recovery
of the lungs' functions and
reduce catheter-related compli
cations, said Dr. William Rhine,
the director of Stanford's ECMO
program.
A new catheter, developed at
the University of Michigan, has
permitted Stanford's ECMO
team to connect a newborn's cir
culatory system to an artificial
lung through the jugular vein
alone, sparing the carotid artery,
which is usually also cat
heterized.
This new method is called
Veno-Venous ECMO, since it
takes and returns blood through

Since their first case on July
8, the Stanford ECMO team of
cardiologists, surgeons,
radiologists, neonatalogists,
nurses and specialized tech
nologists has successfully
treated three babies with the
new ECMO technique.

hope that it was the less invasive
double lumen catheter that fur
ther improved the odds.
Once the catheter is snaked
down to the infant's heart
through the jugular vein, the
ECMO system draws blood from
the body, oxygenates it, and
returns it to the heart for cir
culation to the lungs and body.
The catheter, which combines
both the inflow and outflow
tubes into one unit, was devel
oped by Dr. Robert Bartlett and
his group at the University of
Michigan. It is being manufac
tured by Kendall, a
Massachusetts-based company.
After early testing, the cat
heter's distribution has been al
lowed by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, but the
company is only releasing the
catheter to a group of ECMO
centers that will participate in
a multi-center evaluation of its
use. In the Bay Area, Children's
Hospital in Oakland will also be
testing the new catheter, Rhine
said.
