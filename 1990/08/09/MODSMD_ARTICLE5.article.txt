# Modulars are inconvenient
## 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
The relocation of the Values, Technology,
Science and Society Department from
earthquake-damaged Building 370 to a
modular unit has put VTSS Chair Jim Adams
and senior lecturer Barry Katz in the same
office.
In addition to VTSS, the Modern Thought
and Literature and Geology Departments,
among many others, have moved from the
Quad to trailers, causing inconvenience to stu
dents, faculty and staff â€” inconvenience that
in some cases could last three years or longer.
"It's more difficult to interact with other
people on campus," said William Rifkin, a grad
uate student in technical studies.
Since the VTSS Department was moved to
the modular across from the High Energy

Physics Lab, "it is harder to find," Rifkin
added.
Geology graduate student Marge Bac was
displaced from the Mitchell Building to a Roble
Field modular to make room for office staff.
She said aside from the initial move itself, the
relocation has not been a problem. The trailers
are equipped with computers, and she has
everything she needs.
Besides space and location inconveniences,
Rifkin said there is an aesthetic disadvantage
to the VTSS trailer. Instead of seeing brick
and sandstone out his window, he now sees
the "ugliest corner of campus" and can't open
the windows without hearing the "loud com
pressors" of the lab.
Rifkin admits, however, that the temporary
inconvenience is worth the renovation of the
old Building 370, which was in need of repair
even before the quake struck.
