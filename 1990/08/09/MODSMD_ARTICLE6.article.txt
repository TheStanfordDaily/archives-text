# Hexagonal Hanna House sits empty, awaiting funds
## 
### Carolyn Adams 
Once it was filled with the
joys and sorrows, the rituals and
passages of a dynamic family.
But today the Frank Lloyd
Wright-designed Hanna House
stands empty. Every piece of
furniture is gone from the main
wing, a few embers remain in
the fireplace, and chalky foot
prints soil the red concrete floor.
Surrounded by a fence, with
"No Trespassing" signs posted
to deter those hoping to get a
glimpse of the one-story, split
level masterpiece, the landmark
building awaits funding to
repair damages sustained in the
Oct. 17 earthquake.
In 1935, Professor Paul
Hanna and his wife Jean
budgeted $15,000 for the entire
construction of their dream
house. Repairing related struc
tural damage, installing a new
roof and making minor
upgrades today will cost an es
timated $1.8 million.
The Hannas commissioned
Wright to build their dream
home after reading about his
design philosophy. They found
that he, "expressed concepts
that we had sensed, but had
never been able to articulate,"
they wrote in"The Clients'
Report," their personal account

of the building process.
When Paul Hanna became a
Stanford faculty member in
1935, the project began to be
come a reality.
The Hannas developed a
precise list of requirements for
their house. It had to: enable
them to live outdoors, as well
as inside; nestle into the con
tours of the surrounding hills;
take advantage of views and
breezes; be well-equipped with
modern conveniences; and fit
the Hannas' lifestyle of working,
entertaining and child-rearing.
Finally, it had to be flexible to
meet the changing needs of an
ever-changing family.
When Wright mailed the Han
nas preliminary drawings for a
novel design based, like a bee's
honeycomb, on the hexagon,
they were both surprised and
pleased.
Planned on a 4-foot-4-inch
diameter module, the six-sided
geometric motif appears in the
layout as well as the details of
the house, landscaping elements
and many of the furnishings.
"The building is woven on
these imaginary lines, as a rug
is woven on its warp, ensuring
consistent proportion and ena
bling the builder to take full
advantage of repetition," L. Cor
nelia Brierly, one of Wright's ap

prentices, wrote in a Wisconsin
newspaper.
The house gently wraps itself
around a brick and concrete
courtyard shaded by oak, cy
press and magnolia trees.
Constructed of concrete, brick,
redwood and glass, Hanna
House is an artful juxtaposition
of delicate Japanese detailing
and the solid horizontal lines
found in Wright's Midwestern
prairie houses. Brick walls, red
wood siding and a tar and gravel
roof — natural materials —
complement the site, with roll
ing hills to the west and views
of Hoover Tower and red tile
campus roofs to the northeast.
Geology Prof. Bailey Willis
wandered by the construction
site one day and informed the
Hannas that their new house
wa3 located on an earthquake
fault. When the Hannas alerted
Wright, he replied that he had
built the Imperial Hotel in
Tokyo, which survived a
quake with minimal damage.
But Willis may have been
right. Jonathan Ryan, Stanford
project manager, conducted a
post-quake inspection of the
house and site. He discovered
unreinforced masonry, a struc
tural faux pas in earthquake
country, as well as a shortage
of load-bearing walls.

Structurally unsound ele
ments, like fireplaces, have been
temporarily reinforced with
wood shoring until campus ar
chitects can determine the opti
mal solution for restoring the
house.
The architects want to main
tain the original design integri
ty, while ensuring the structural
soundness of the building. For
instance, many walls, designed

to be moved around as the fam
ily expanded and contracted, do
not support the building itself.
After the Mannas' three children
grew up and left the house, their
bedrooms were converted into a
library.
"Flexibility was an important
feature of the original design,
and we want to preserve that,"
said Ryan.

Hanna House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is currently closed
due to earthquake damages. Located on Frenchman's Road, the
house is normally the home of the provost.
