# Houses undergo major repairs
## Residents either evacuate or cover belongings with plastic

Although memories of the
Oct. 17 earthquake are fading,
its effects are still jarringly ev
ident as one passes Columbae,
one of the hardest hit of the
Row houses.
But despite the house's
ravaged appearance, repairs and
reconstruction are proceeding
"as scheduled," according to
Keith Guy, director of housing
and food services.
Concerns that Columbae,
Durand, the Taxi and Roth
would not be ready to welcome
residents in the fall are un
founded, Guy said. To the con
trary, work is progressing
smoothly, he said. While all four
houses sustained profound
structural damage and must un
dergo extensive internal and
external repairs, students will
be able to move in Sept. 20.
According to Guy, a meeting
last week between the project
manager, architect, construction
heads and Stanford housing of

ficials confirmed that there "is
no indication that the houses
won't be ready."
Double shifts and accelerated
work are in progress to ensure
a more stable Columbae for the
co-op community. Work on its
stucco exterior is expected to
begin soon, after the completion
of internal structural repairs.
At worst, Guy predicts, resi
dents of the four houses could
face a short period of minor
repair work such as doorway
painting while living there.
These repairs will not affect the
move-in date, he said.
Reconstruction in Ham
marskjold House, one of the 11
houses and dorms receiving
"cosmetic repairs" this summer,
will soon make it impossible for
summer residents to live there
without at least a temporary
evacuation, as workers come in
to seal cracks and repair other
earthquake damage.
Residents received no notifica
tion of the repairs until a week
or two ago, said June graduate

Steve Geary, one of six Ham
marskjold residents considering
moving to Wilbur for the
remainder of the summer.
"We've all been caught by
surprise and it's pretty
miserable," said Geary. Resi
dents have been given the choice
to move to Wilbur permanently,
or temporarily while work on
each room takes place.
Those who've decided to stick
it out in Hammarskjdld despite
the inconvenience, noise and dis
order have been given plastic to
cover beds, computers and valu
ables. With the quarter coming
to a close and finals looming,
the plastic wrap has failed to
appease all residents.
The Synergy, Phi Psi and
Delta Tau Delta Houses suffered
more extensive damage and will
not reopen until fall 1991. For
the coming school year. Synergy
will be in the Grove Houses, Phi
Psi will occupy the AD House,
and the Delts will take over 553
Mayfleld.

Although the Theta XI house still looks very precarious on stilts, officials reassure that It will be
ready for students in the fall.
