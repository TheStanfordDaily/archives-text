"A lot of people on both cam
puses won't be surprised if Stan
ford President Donald Kennedy
is offered the presidency of Har
vard — a job he may not want,
of course," columnist Herb Caen
wrote in yesterday's San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
Kennedy's assistant Bob
Hamrdla said he wouldn't be
surprised either if a letter came
in the mail asking Kennedy
whether he wanted to be con
sidered by Harvard's presiden
tial search committee.
"That sort of overture is
scarcely unknown in academic
circles," he said, quickly adding
that he couldn't speak for Ken
nedy as to whether or not he'd
accept such an offer.
Kennedy is on vacation and
couldn't be reached.
Harvard's president Derek
Bok, a 1951 Stanford graduate,

is stepping down next spring
after 20 years at the helm.
Kennedy, whose alma mater
is Harvard, has just completed
his 10th year as Stanford's pres
ident.
