A suspect believed to be re
sponsible for the recent rash of
campus burglaries was arrested
Monday morning by Stanford
police.
James Edwards Pease, 21, a
resident of the faculty and staff
housing neighborhood and son
of Electrical Engineering Prof.
R. Fabian Pease, was ap
prehended by Palo Alto Police
Officer Duane Tan nock.
Pease is a suspect in a string
of up to 40 burglaries and prop
erty crimes dating back to May,
according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"Pease was our number one
suspect all along," Niemeyer
said. "We've been trying to catch
him at night."
According to Niemeyer, the
recent burglaries show a pro
gression. At first, there were

several thefts of objects — not
stereos — in the glove compart
ments or on the seats of locked
cars. If the cars were locked,
the thief would smash the win
dows, Niemeyer said.
Then the burglaries became
more bold, with cars being stolen
and driven to unlocked houses
and goods being stolen from the
houses, Niemeyer added.
Niemeyer said he believes
Pease, perhaps with the help of
an accomplice, is responsible for
thefts in the faculty housing
area and in Escondido Village.
Pease has made no statement
to police.
Police received a call at 3:51
a.m. Monday from an Escondido
Village resident who said a man
had opened a kitchen window
and was about to enter an apart
ment. The caller shouted at the
would-be burglar, who fled.
