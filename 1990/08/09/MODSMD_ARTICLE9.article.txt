# Suspect for burglary is arrested by police
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
A suspect believed to be re
sponsible for the recent rash of
campus burglaries was arrested
Monday morning by Stanford
police.
James Edwards Pease, 21, a
resident of the faculty and staff
housing neighborhood and son
of Electrical Engineering Prof.
R. Fabian Pease, was ap
prehended by Palo Alto Police
Officer Duane Tan nock.
Pease is a suspect in a string
of up to 40 burglaries and prop
erty crimes dating back to May,
according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"Pease was our number one
suspect all along," Niemeyer
said. "We've been trying to catch
him at night."
According to Niemeyer, the
recent burglaries show a pro
gression. At first, there were

several thefts of objects — not
stereos — in the glove compart
ments or on the seats of locked
cars. If the cars were locked,
the thief would smash the win
dows, Niemeyer said.
Then the burglaries became
more bold, with cars being stolen
and driven to unlocked houses
and goods being stolen from the
houses, Niemeyer added.
Niemeyer said he believes
Pease, perhaps with the help of
an accomplice, is responsible for
thefts in the faculty housing
area and in Escondido Village.
Pease has made no statement
to police.
Police received a call at 3:51
a.m. Monday from an Escondido
Village resident who said a man
had opened a kitchen window
and was about to enter an apart
ment. The caller shouted at the
would-be burglar, who fled.
The resident gave a good de
scription of the suspect, and an
all-points bulletin was issued.
About 4:49 a.m., another Es
condido Village resident re
ported hearing noises on the
first floor of his apartment. A
prowler, apparently confused by
the electrical switches on the
wall, had activated the garbage
disposal while trying to turn on
the lights.
When officers arrived, the
back door was open and the res
ident was missing a $1,300 video
camera.
A short while later, yet an
other nearby resident reported
three parked cars had been bro
ken into, with items taken from
the glove compartments of each.
Tannock caught up with the
suspect near a third residence,
where a screen door had been
pried open and a purse and wal
let taken.
The Palo Alto officer "had a
mountain bike in the trunk of
his car, and used it to sneak up
on the suspect," Niemeyer said.
Pease was charged with two
counts of burglary, possession
of stolen property and posses
sion of burglary tools. He al
legedly had the video camera
and numerous other stolen
items with him in a large bag
at the time of his arrest.
Niemeyer also said the
suspect was in possession of a
pair of work gloves and a black
"Maglite" flashlight, which may
belong to another robbery vic
tim, in which case additional
charges would be considered.
