The nation may be disap
pointed with President
George Bush over domestic
issues, such as the savings
and loans fiasco and the
stalled congressional negoti
ations on the budget deficit,
but for those working on the
forefront of U.S.-Soviet rela
tions, none could be more

excited about the president than Condoleeza
Rice.
Rice, an associate professor of political
science who is currently on leave, has just
been appointed by Bush as special assistant
to the president, effective Aug. 1.
Known by friends and students as
"Condi," Rice has served on the National
Security Council since February 1989, and
was appointed senior director for Soviet af
fairs May 1. Her recent appointment should
have come with the directorship, but there
was no opening until August, she explained.
In this post-Cold War era, Rice acknowl
edged that the United States and the Soviet
Union "are going through a very good pe
riod." As an NSC official, however, she was
not allowed to speak about policy matters
on the record, and therefore could not com
ment further on current topics such as the
Iraq invasion.
Rice has been involved with briefing the
president and making policy recommenda
tions, sometimes up to two to three times
a day "during a very busy time for U.S.-
Soviet relations," she said.
Rice is always present at meetings between
Bush and foreign leaders if the issues dis
cussed are Suviet-related, she said. She met
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for the
first time in the Malta summit, and then
again in the recent June summit.
She said Gorbachev is an "extraordinary
leader.. . energetic â€” all things you would
expect from someone of his magnitude."
One of her most memorable experiences,
she said, was when she accompanied the
Gorbachevs on a helicopter leaving the
White House.
