The nation may be disap
pointed with President
George Bush over domestic
issues, such as the savings
and loans fiasco and the
stalled congressional negoti
ations on the budget deficit,
but for those working on the
forefront of U.S.-Soviet rela
tions, none could be more

excited about the president than Condoleeza
Rice.
Rice, an associate professor of political
science who is currently on leave, has just
been appointed by Bush as special assistant
to the president, effective Aug. 1.
Known by friends and students as
"Condi," Rice has served on the National
Security Council since February 1989, and
was appointed senior director for Soviet af
fairs May 1. Her recent appointment should
have come with the directorship, but there
was no opening until August, she explained.
In this post-Cold War era, Rice acknowl
edged that the United States and the Soviet
Union "are going through a very good pe
riod." As an NSC official, however, she was
not allowed to speak about policy matters
on the record, and therefore could not com
ment further on current topics such as the
Iraq invasion.
Rice has been involved with briefing the
president and making policy recommenda
tions, sometimes up to two to three times
a day "during a very busy time for U.S.-
Soviet relations," she said.
Rice is always present at meetings between
Bush and foreign leaders if the issues dis
cussed are Suviet-related, she said. She met
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for the
first time in the Malta summit, and then
again in the recent June summit.
She said Gorbachev is an "extraordinary
leader.. . energetic â€” all things you would
expect from someone of his magnitude."
One of her most memorable experiences,
she said, was when she accompanied the
Gorbachevs on a helicopter leaving the
White House.
The press has widely reported that Rice


Rice
was pushed aside by a secret
service agent when she was
greeting Gorbachev at the San
Francisco Airport. She said the
incident arose because the agent
did not recognize that she was
supposed to be in the delegation,
and that the whole thing was
"completely blown out of pro
portion."
Rice is currently on vacation
in Palo Alto at her father's res
idence. She will be heading for
Moscow Aug. 26 with White
House Chief of Staff John
Sununu on a five-day trip to
learn more about the workings
of the Soviet government. The
Soviet equivalent of the chief of
staff has recently been in the
United States for the same pur
pose, she said.
Rice said the trip is part of a
"technical cooperation" program
which involves the exchange of
knowledge on the operations of
U.S. and Soviet institutions,
such as the legislature and the
banking system.
Rice is very enthusiastic about
her appointment, calling Bush
"a wonderful president." She
said working with Bush is the
"nicest thing" about her job.
Despite her exciting life in
Washington, D.C., Rice does
plan to return to the Farm in
the future. "I would hope not
to stay away from Stanford for
too long," she said.
