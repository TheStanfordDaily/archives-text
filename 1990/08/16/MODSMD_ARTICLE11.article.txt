Stanford police arrested Stanford
senior Mark Allen Anderegg for bur
glary on Aug. 10, according to Captain
Raoul Niemeyer.
The 21-year-old Anderegg, a resi
dent of Boring, Oregon, was arrested
at 5:45 p.m. at his trailer in Manzan
ita Park, booked at North County Jail,
and released on $80,000 bail,
Niemeyer said.
The bail was set at $80,000 because
burglary — defined as entering any
dwelling or four-sided structure with
the intent to commit petty theft or

felony — is a felony.
Police first learned of Anderegg's
suspected activities on Aug. 3, when
they received a call from a visiting
German student residing in Wilbur
Hall.
According to Niemeyer, the student
told the police that when he returned
to his room, he saw a man climbing
out his window. The German student,
whom Niemeyer described as being
very muscular, pursued the man and
cornered him, asking him what he
was doing in his room.
The intruder responded that he did
not do anything. The German student
then let the man go and he returned

to his room. Upon returning to his
room, the student realized that some
of his money had been stolen. He then
called the police who took a report.
Shortly after, the police received in
formation from a reliable source that
implicated Anderegg, Niemeyer said.
Using this information, Detective Tim
Frecceri obtained a photograph of An
deregg from a Frosh Book, compiled
a photographic lineup and showed it
to the German student. The student
immediately identified Anderegg,
Niemeyer said.
Frecceri then obtained an arrest
warrant and, with Detective Ser
geant Del Bandy, arrested An
deregg. While in police custody,
Anderegg admitted to three ad
ditional thefts. He confessed to
entering people's apartments
and stealing their wallets,
taking the cash and dumping
the wallets, Niemeyer said.
Subsequently, police searched
Anderegg's trailer and found
two wallets belonging to other
potential victims. One wallet
was traced back to a victim who
said that the wallet contained
two rings valued at $15,000 a
piece, Niemeyer said. Anderegg
denies taking the rings,
Niemeyer added.
Niemeyer also said that em
ployees of Operations and Main
tenance found three wallets in
the vicinity of Anderegg's trailer,
one of which police traced back
to a victim Anderegg admitted
to having burglarized.
According to Niemeyer, An
deregg, if convicted, could face
up to one year in county jail or
state prison.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, who charges people with
violating the Fundamental
Standard, said that she will
probably be "looking into"
Anderegg's case.
Although she could not com
ment specifically on whether or
not Anderegg will be charged
with a violation, or what type
of penalty he would receive, Cole
said that "most Fundamental
Standard violations involve a
suspension (from the
University) of one quarter or
more."
