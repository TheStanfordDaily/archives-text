# Student questions Escondido bill
## Disputes cleaning charge 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Escondido Village resident Tom Berger received
a $55.00 bill for cleaning after he moved out of
his old apartment in June — cleaning that he
claims was never performed.
Berger's complaint is just one of many brought
to the attention of the Escondido Village Council
in the past year. The complaints have spurred
council members to enter into negotiations with
Escondido maintenance in the hope of obtaining
better, and more honest, services for the students.
According to Council President Shef Baker,
Berger's case is the first to be documented with
evidence. While most people who get charged for
cleaning do not bother to investigate the billing,
Berger detailed the events which led to the dis
covery of what he called "criminal fraud" in a
letter to Glenn Carroll, graduate housing facilities
manager.
Berger requested an itemized bill in July, on
which he was "shocked to find many charges . . .
applied toward items which [he and his wife] had
put major effort into cleaning prior to [their]
move," he wrote in the letter.
Berger said he had the opportunity to examine
his old apartment July 24 when a temporary
resident was moving in. He said the floors of the
apartment had not been stripped, waxed or buffed,
as claimed by the itemized bill.
Berger was charged for six and a half hours
worth of cleaning work, when "it did not appear
that any work had been performed beyond the
cleaning which [he and his wife] had done prior
to moving out," he said.
Berger returned later to the apartment and


Escondido Village resident Tom Berger was billed for three hours
worth of stripping, waxing and buffing the floor — something which
he claims had not been done.
