# Student questions Escondido bill
## Disputes cleaning charge 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Escondido Village resident Tom Berger received
a $55.00 bill for cleaning after he moved out of
his old apartment in June — cleaning that he
claims was never performed.
Berger's complaint is just one of many brought
to the attention of the Escondido Village Council
in the past year. The complaints have spurred
council members to enter into negotiations with
Escondido maintenance in the hope of obtaining
better, and more honest, services for the students.
According to Council President Shef Baker,
Berger's case is the first to be documented with
evidence. While most people who get charged for
cleaning do not bother to investigate the billing,
Berger detailed the events which led to the dis
covery of what he called "criminal fraud" in a
letter to Glenn Carroll, graduate housing facilities
manager.
Berger requested an itemized bill in July, on
which he was "shocked to find many charges . . .
applied toward items which [he and his wife] had
put major effort into cleaning prior to [their]
move," he wrote in the letter.
Berger said he had the opportunity to examine
his old apartment July 24 when a temporary
resident was moving in. He said the floors of the
apartment had not been stripped, waxed or buffed,
as claimed by the itemized bill.
Berger was charged for six and a half hours
worth of cleaning work, when "it did not appear
that any work had been performed beyond the
cleaning which [he and his wife] had done prior
to moving out," he said.
Berger returned later to the apartment and

took pictures. He also intends
to support his evidence with a
written statement from the cur
rent resident attesting to the
state of the floor and stove upon
moving in.
"My last resort will be small
claims court," Berger said. He
said the most important issue
is to halt the victimization of
students, who are forced to pay
false cleaning charges and move
into dirty apartments.
Carroll said with the large
amount of apartments in Escon
dido — 900 in total — there is
room for some errors. That is
why inspectors are hired, he
said.
The Bursar*B Office currently
handles the cleaning bills, and
Acme Cleaning Service, an out
side contractor in charge of
graduate housing custodial
work, is paid out of University
accounts. Carroll said the Uni
versity usually recovers less
than what is paid out, and the
difference is covered by the rent
the students pay.
He said if the charge program
on cleaning is eliminated, stu
dents will have to pay more rent.

According to Walter Snoeys
and Mike Murray, both council
members who have been work
ing on the issue for the past
year, a proposal outlining guide
lines for Escondido maintenance
is being put together.
They both agreed that the
first step toward better service
is the collection of statistical
data on cleaning bills, their sizes
and distribution, cleaning stand
ards, and the types of com
plaints Escondido maintenance
receives — vital information
that is currently lacking.
In the July 13 issue of the
Village Express, Escondido's
newsletter, Carroll wrote that
with the computer support that
is now available, he will be able
to provide the needed informa
tion after mass move-outs, es
pecially in June and August.
Carroll told The Weekly yes
terday that after the data i£
compiled in the fall, he will be
sharing it with the council and
the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee. "We endeavor to do
as clear a job as we can," he said.
Murray asserted that al
though there were small im
provements made during the
course of the year, they are far
from being satisfactory. For ex
ample, he said, the promise to

leave behind a copy of the in
spection form in empty apart
ments is only fulfilled
inconsistently.
Currently, Acme is in charge
of custodial work at Escondido,
Mirrielees, Manzanita Park and
Rains. Apartments are inspected
by Graduate Housing Facilities
before and afler the cleaning.
Inspectors are supposed to leave
instructions and verify that the
work has been performed after
ward.
Murray said the problem rests
with the cleaners. "Acme is
notorious" for ignoring the in
spector's instructions, he said.
Snoeys speculated that part
of the problem arises from cus
todians and follow-up inspectors
who do not have enough time
to do a good job during the mass
move-outs in June. He said he

is also a personal victim of un
cleaned apartments.
"Whatever you get charged is
actually quite arbitrary," he
said. "There were definitely
items on my bill that we thought
we had covered."
Starting Sept. 15, the Univer
sity's own custodial staff will
replace the Acme cleaning crew,
as the company's graduate
housing custodial contract with
Stanford comes to an end.
Carroll said the new crew will
be drawn from large undergrad
uate dormitories, and its size
will be comparable to the Acme
crew. He said the change is not
due to any inadequacy on
Acme's part, but because it can
protect the career and tenure of
the University's own custodians
who may be affected by the
budget repositioning.

Escondido Village resident Tom Berger received
a $55.00 bill for cleaning after he moved out of
his old apartment in June — cleaning that he
claims was never performed.
Berger's complaint is just one of many brought
to the attention of the Escondido Village Council
in the past year. The complaints have spurred
council members to enter into negotiations with
Escondido maintenance in the hope of obtaining
better, and more honest, services for the students.
According to Council President Shef Baker,
Berger's case is the first to be documented with
evidence. While most people who get charged for
cleaning do not bother to investigate the billing,
Berger detailed the events which led to the dis
covery of what he called "criminal fraud" in a
letter to Glenn Carroll, graduate housing facilities
manager.
Berger requested an itemized bill in July, on
which he was "shocked to find many charges . . .
applied toward items which [he and his wife] had
put major effort into cleaning prior to [their]
move," he wrote in the letter.
Berger said he had the opportunity to examine
his old apartment July 24 when a temporary
resident was moving in. He said the floors of the
apartment had not been stripped, waxed or buffed,
as claimed by the itemized bill.
Berger was charged for six and a half hours
worth of cleaning work, when "it did not appear
that any work had been performed beyond the
cleaning which [he and his wife] had done prior
to moving out," he said.
Berger returned later to the apartment and

took pictures. He also intends
to support his evidence with a
written statement from the cur
rent resident attesting to the
state of the floor and stove upon
moving in.
"My last resort will be small
claims court," Berger said. He
said the most important issue
is to halt the victimization of
students, who are forced to pay
false cleaning charges and move
into dirty apartments.
Carroll said with the large
amount of apartments in Escon
dido — 900 in total — there is
room for some errors. That is
why inspectors are hired, he
said.
The Bursar*B Office currently
handles the cleaning bills, and
Acme Cleaning Service, an out
side contractor in charge of
graduate housing custodial
work, is paid out of University
accounts. Carroll said the Uni
versity usually recovers less
than what is paid out, and the
difference is covered by the rent
the students pay.
He said if the charge program
on cleaning is eliminated, stu
dents will have to pay more rent.

According to Walter Snoeys
and Mike Murray, both council
members who have been work
ing on the issue for the past
year, a proposal outlining guide
lines for Escondido maintenance
is being put together.
They both agreed that the
first step toward better service
is the collection of statistical
data on cleaning bills, their sizes
and distribution, cleaning stand
ards, and the types of com
plaints Escondido maintenance
receives — vital information
that is currently lacking.
In the July 13 issue of the
Village Express, Escondido's
newsletter, Carroll wrote that
with the computer support that
is now available, he will be able
to provide the needed informa
tion after mass move-outs, es
pecially in June and August.
Carroll told The Weekly yes
terday that after the data i£
compiled in the fall, he will be
sharing it with the council and
the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee. "We endeavor to do
as clear a job as we can," he said.
Murray asserted that al
though there were small im
provements made during the
course of the year, they are far
from being satisfactory. For ex
ample, he said, the promise to

leave behind a copy of the in
spection form in empty apart
ments is only fulfilled
inconsistently.
Currently, Acme is in charge
of custodial work at Escondido,
Mirrielees, Manzanita Park and
Rains. Apartments are inspected
by Graduate Housing Facilities
before and afler the cleaning.
Inspectors are supposed to leave
instructions and verify that the
work has been performed after
ward.
Murray said the problem rests
with the cleaners. "Acme is
notorious" for ignoring the in
spector's instructions, he said.
Snoeys speculated that part
of the problem arises from cus
todians and follow-up inspectors
who do not have enough time
to do a good job during the mass
move-outs in June. He said he

is also a personal victim of un
cleaned apartments.
"Whatever you get charged is
actually quite arbitrary," he
said. "There were definitely
items on my bill that we thought
we had covered."
Starting Sept. 15, the Univer
sity's own custodial staff will
replace the Acme cleaning crew,
as the company's graduate
housing custodial contract with
Stanford comes to an end.
Carroll said the new crew will
be drawn from large undergrad
uate dormitories, and its size
will be comparable to the Acme
crew. He said the change is not
due to any inadequacy on
Acme's part, but because it can
protect the career and tenure of
the University's own custodians
who may be affected by the
budget repositioning.
