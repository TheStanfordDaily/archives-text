# New buildings complement existing campus architecture

There is more to the design of new
campus buildings than first meets the
eye.
University Architect David Neuman,
who oversees campus building projects,
said the design process must be thought
out on three levels — planning, building
and design guidelines. Without the un
derlying planning principles and pro
gramming, a design cannot be realized,
Neuman explained.
A new building must fit in with the
campus master plan developed by
landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmstead in 1886, and relate to the Mis
sion Revival-style buildings and arcades
of the Inner Quad.
A structure must be placed properly
on the building site, meet the needs of
its users and conform to a budget. The
unique physical design of a building
evolves in response to planning principles
and program requirements.
The rules are interpretive, rather than
rigid. Neuman said, "We do not want
slavish repetition, but we do want to
continue tradition."
Stanford's tradition of excellence is not
only academic, but cultural and physical
as well. In the new buidings, Neuman
intends to preserve both the informal
rural character of the Farm and its tradi
tional legacy, represented in Olmstead's
strong axial plan.
Two major axes run through the
campus. The more formal north-south
axis connects the Memorial Church with
the CalTrain station via Palm Drive —
a link to the outside world. An east-west

axis along Serra Street relates to the
region, providing vistas of the coastal
mountains and the surrounding
landscape.
As was the prevailing philosophy of
the times, Olmstead juxtaposed man
made with natural elements, rational
with romantic. "It is very symbolic," said
Neuman.
All of these considerations have gone
into the planning of two new buildings
at the School of Medicine. The Medical
School Laboratory Surge Building and
the Richard M. Lucas Center for Mag
netic Resonance Spectroscopy and Im
aging are two separate buildings
functionally attached for construction ef
ficiency.
The late architect Edward Durell
Stone, who designed the one-million
square-foot main Medical Center build
ing, looked to the Quad for inspiration.
His design, like the Quad, is composed
of an arcade and many small courtyards.
Light and shadow patterns which change
depending on the time of day embellish
the terra cotta building, a modern inter
pretation of classical building elements.
Just as Stone looked to the original
campus architecture for inspiration,
Neuman and architects Marrachini and
Patterson have turned to the Medical
Center building for cues.
The Lucas Center and Laboratory
Surge Building will feature a row of
columns to complement, but not mimic,
the Medical Center colonnade in color,
scale, proportion and character. The
structure functions as a visual extention
of the Medical Center.
A cylindrical tower, through which

fumes are vented, protrudes from the
roof at one end of the new building. The
cylinder reflects the similar geometry of
the nearby Cardiovascular Center.
Other geometric elements lend diver
sity to the rectangular building form,
identify building entrances or call atten
tion to important features within, like
the spectroscopy units. A landscaped
buffer zone distances passersby from the
magnetic forces generated in the build
ing.
While the Medical Center, on the
campus perimeter, maintains both a sep
arate identity and a link to the main
campus, Kimball Hall, a 200-student new

dormitory located within the Campus
Drive loop, is a contemporary version of
neighboring Branner and Toyon Halls.
San Francisco-based architects Backen,
Arrigoni and Ross, who designed the
Rains houses on campus, proposed an
H-shaped stucco and cast stone building
with red tile roofs, copper gutters and
downspouts and double-hung windows.
The residence will have three stories.
The lower level will contain a lounge,
television, computer and game rooms and
other public spaces and housing for 50
students. The upper two floors will ac
comodate 75 students each, and a dining
hall will be nearby.


An artist's rendition of Kimball Hall, an undergraduate residence scheduled to open
in fall 1991, shows the Integration of modern and traditional architectural elements
in the design.
