# Global warming may be eased
## Computer model estimates impact of CO2 emission limit 
### Wendy Witt Staff writer 
Reducing carbon dioxide emis
sions in the next century to ease
global warming will be difficult
and expensive, but possible if
industrial countries implement
reductions while allowing devel
oping countries to increase emis
sions, according to a Stanford
researcher.
Alan Manne, professor of op
erations research, working with
Richard Richels of the Electric
Power Research Institute, devel
oped the Global 2100 computer
program, a model for estimating
the economic impact of a carbon
dioxide emission limit.
There is a growing concern
that the increasing accumula
tion of "greenhouse gases," like
carbon dioxide, in the atmos
phere will lead to higher tem
peratures globally that may
ultimately endanger life on
earth.
Carbon dioxide emissions,
which originate from the burn
ing of fossil fuels such as coal,
gas and oil, are believed to be
responsible for approximately
half of the "greenhouse " prob
lem.
Experts have proposed a
worldwide emission reduction of
20 percent or more.
The Global 2100 program
models energy supply and
demand for five geopolitical
regions in order to understand

how the costs of limiting carbon
emissions are likely to vary
among regions, and whether a
20 percent reduction is econom
ically feasible.
"For a set of limits to be
broadly accepted, they must be
perceived as equitable, enforce
able and based on gradual rather
than abrupt changes in the
status quo," Manne says.
According to his research, a
20 percent worldwide reduction
would be neither equitable nor
enforceable.
Developing nations refuse to
cut discharges because of the
constraints this would impose
on their economies. For them,
the issue is not how far to reduce
emissions, but how far to limit
growth.
China's fossil fuel resource
base is dominated by coal, which
Eroduces a large amount of car
on dioxide per unit of energy,
thus emission limits would pose
a heavy economic burden.
On the other hand, Western
Europe, especially France, gets
a significant amount of its en
ergy from nuclear plants, which
poses no carbon emission haz
ard.
The United States, which gets
6 percent of its energy from nu
clear plants and the rest from
carbon-rich fossil fuels, lies
somewhere between these two
extremes.
Because of these inequities,
Manne proposes less ambitious

but more feasible carbon limits:
a 20 percent reduction in emis
sions by the industrialized coun
tries, a doubling or quadrupling
of emissions in China and a dou
bling in the other developing
countries.
This would result in a 15 to
37 percent overall increase be
tween 1990 and 2030, but no
further increase thereafter. By
2100, global emissions would be
only 25 to 30 percent of the level
that would have been reached
in the absence of an interna
tional agreement.
Even this proposal places a
greater burden on the develop
ing countries and China than
on the industrialized world.
In order to meet these limits,
Manne suggests the levying of
a tax on those activities respon
sible for carbon emissions, such
as automobile use and anything
that relies on the burning of
fossil fuels. The tax rate would
vary according to the carbon
content of individual fuels.
As nations face varying costs
in meeting emission limits,
Manne foresees the development
of international markets for car
bon emission rights.
If carbon dioxide emission re
duction is worthwhile, it is im
portant to understand that it
will be costly, no matter what
method is employed. As Manne
warns, "There is no free lunch.
It's going to be expensive to limit
emissions."
