# Biking is better than driving — except those Kansas hills

Editor's note: This is the second
in a three-part series about the
writer's experiences while cycling
across the country with Bike-Aid.

Christopher Columbus' ex
pedition in 1492 largely dis
pelled the myth that the earth
was flat, but many people are
still under the impression that
the Midwest is.
This summer, I set out to dis
cover America by bicycle, and I
quickly discovered that truly flat
parts of the country are few and
far between.
I am traveling with a group
of 20 other young people this
summer on a program called
Bike-Aid, and our most difficult
— and eye-opening — day so far
has been our first day in the
supposedly flat state of Kansas.
Instead of flat, fast roads, we

faced 125 miles of terrain de
scribed as "rolling hills." The
term "rolling" implies that we
coasted easily down one hill and
up the next. In actuality, the
head winds we faced made it
difficult to pedal downhill, not
to mention back up.
During our rest stop on that
windy Kansas morning, one
rider entered a gas station and
cheerfully commented to the
proprietor, "Hey, I thought
Kansas was supposed to be flat!"
"Obviously, you must be from
California," he replied. And he
was right. That cyclist, and most
of the riders on Bike-Aid, are
from California, or at least from

one of the coasts.
Having spent my whole life
on the East Coast before coming
to Stanford, I set out this sum
mer to discover the real United
States — to find out what goes
on in the 3,000 miles between
New York and California.
Cycling with Bike-Aid has
turned out to be the ideal op
portunity to learn about this
country firsthand. Bike-Aid is
an annual, nine-week, 3,600-
mile bike trek which aims to
raise awareness of the issues of
global hunger and poverty, and
to raise money for grass roots
development projects worldwide.
Bike-Aid provides many edu
cational opportunities for
cyclists to interact with local
community members across the
country and to learn about do
mestic issues from them. And
traveling by bicycle has become
a learning experience in itself.
The best way to learn about

a town is from its residents, and
it is much easier to meet people
when traveling by bike than it
is by car.
First of all, cyclists are rare.
Men and women dressed in tight
black shorts and fluorescent
shirts, sporting gloves and
bizarre-looking aerodynamic
helmets, do not frequently
bicycle through small Midwes
tern towns.
And since we do not go very
fast, people have plenty of time
to formulate and vocalize ques
tions before we disappear from
view. Because we ride on the
shoulder of the road, it is not
a hassle for us to pull over and
answer them.
People are generally curious
about what we are doing and
why we are doing it. And if they
ask where we've been, we can
tell them — and not just because
we know the names of towns
from the road signs.

Instead of speeding through
towns, with the windows rolled
up and the air-conditioning on,
we roll through them slowly. In
stead of viewing our surround
ings disinterestedly, we really
experience them.
On Bike-Aid, we have a set
number of miles to travel each
day (averaging about 70), but
no particular time to arrive at
our destination. As long as we
complete the day's journey by
nightfall, the day is ours to
create.
"Environment breaks" are
frequent distractions from the
day*B ride. These respites have
included everything from a
quick dip in a cold mountain
stream during a long ascent in
the Sierras, to writing our
names in the Salt Flats of Utah,
to taking numerous pictures of
breathtaking vistas in the
Rockies.
