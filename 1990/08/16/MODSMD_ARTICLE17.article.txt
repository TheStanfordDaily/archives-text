# Project revives rare photos of Kiowa culture
## 
### Sunil Perkash Staff writer 
A rare archive of works by
the late Native American pho
tographer Horace Poolaw will be
exhibited at Meyer Library in
October as part of the Centen
nial Celebration.
Last year, Horace Poolaw's
daughter Linda Poolaw brought
the negatives to Stanford and
used them as the basis of a year
long course about the Kiowa In
dians of Oklahoma. Poolaw, who
died in 1980, was a Kiowa and
thus had access to locations
closed to outsiders.
As the class progressed, the
rare account of the Kiowa life
style revealed by the negatives
caught the attention of everyone
involved. Charles Junkerman,
assistant dean of undergraduate
studies, who originally brought
Linda Poolaw to Stanford, said,
"We realized early that there
were a large amount of wonder
ful negatives."
This gave way to the idea of
turning the class into a more
substantial project, which will
culminate in a major three
month exhibition of Poolaw's
photographs this fall.
The project involved reprint
ing negatives and choosing pho
tographs for the exhibit. Stu
dents also visited Kiowas in
Oklahoma for help interpreting
some of the prints.
Successful fund raising cov
ered the expenses of the class,
which was renamed the Horace
Poolaw Photography Project. A
documentary is also being made
about the project, and will be
aired as part of the exhibit.

Linda said that until this proj
ect, most of her father's works
were not printed because of the
expense involved. Museums had
in the past asked Poolaw, who
earned his living as a farmer,
to publicly display his photos.
But, she said, her father
usually refused such offers be
cause he was afraid of the "big
time," and for this reason his
works never received wide
spread recognition.
Poolaw began taking photo
graphs in 1925, about 30 years
after the Kiowas were placed on
reservations, and continued
taking them until 1979.
One of the most striking fea
tures of his photographs is the
changes they reveal within
Kiowa society. "They capture a
transition of my people from the
Indian world to the white man's
world," Linda Poolaw said.
Hilary Smith, a 1990 gradu
ate, is one of the students work
ing on the "retrospective" ex
hibition. "These photos show
the Indians from the Indian per
spective," Smith said. "He has
pictures of normal, not
ceremonial Indian life."
Junkerman said the pictures
are interesting not only because
they depict everyday Kiowa fam
ily life, but also because they
have "real anthropological
value."
For now, work continues for
the fall exhibit at Meyer Library.
Linda Poolaw, who is pleased
with the tremendous dedication
shown by the students and fac
ulty involved, said, "I could not
find a finer place to give tribute
to my father's work."

to capture Native American culture on film, from an insider's
perspective. His works will be the subject of an October retrospective
