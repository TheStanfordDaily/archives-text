## Editorial Guns kill people 
### 
THE RIGHT to bear
arms is one of the
foundations of Ameri
can society. It is part of the
U.S. Constitution. Though
the continental United States
has never been attacked by a
hostile force, our "right to
bear arms" is there as a de
terrent to anyone who might
be stupid enough to try.
But there is a downside to
the right to bear arms — a
big downside. People with
guns don't just hide them
away in their closets until
they hear on the television
that we are being invaded.
People with guns use them.
And, at an alarmingly high
rate, they use them to kill
other people. Now, the cute
National Rifleman's Associa
tion slogan that "if guns were
outlawed, only outlaws would
have guns" is not only self
evident, it is infantile. If guns
were outlawed, only police of
ficers would have guns and
other prospective gun owners
would be behind bars.
It is also safe to say that
if no one had guns, fewer
people would get shot. How
big of a problem is this? On
July 17 last year, Time mag
azine did their "gun issue"
which showed the names and
faces of individuals who were
shot in one week in the
United States. The week was
chosen at random and it —
May 1 to May 7 — was an
average week. During this
average American week, 464
people were shot.
The idea for the "gun
issue" came from a 1969 issue
of Life magazine which
showed the photos of ser
vicemen — 242 — who were
killed during an average week
in the Vietnam War.
The Vietnam War ended,
but the problem of American
gun use continues. A recent
Senate Judiciary Committee
report predicted that 23,220

individuals would be mur
dered in this country in 1990
— an all-time high.

America's slow decline from
its status as a world leader
in many categories is not
being felt in the area of vio
lent crime. When it comes to
violent crime, America is still
among the highest ranks. The
reasons for this continued
success have been debated for
years. Some attribute the
high incidence of violent
crime to movies and televi
sion, which are getting more
violent each year. The latest
scapegoat for the violent
crime problem has been the
drug trade. The logic goes
something like this: drug
dealers use guns, so if we get
rid of the drug dealers, there
will be less violent crime.
There is definitely merit to
that argument, but while the
U.S. government is pouring
millions of dollars into its
bloated war on drugs, the real
solution is being ignored.
We need a president who
will really take on the pro-gun
lobby and get guns out of
people's hands. Many gun
proponents argue that they
need rifles so they can go
hunt. It is certainly debatable
as to whether or not these
sadistic thrill-seekers should
be allowed to hunt Bambi, but
it is not debatable as to
whether or not handguns
should be outlawed. No one
is going to go hunting with
a handgun. People only use
handguns to kill other people.
Last week, Time printed
another story about guns. It
told a story of random vio
lence and the deaths of inno
cent children in New York.
While cities may always be
more violent than other areas,
it is time to take guns out of
people's hands and lower the
level of violence. We can cer
tainly do without another
record year in 1991.
