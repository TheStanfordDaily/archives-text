## Columnist resigns from humanity 
### 
I have decided to resign from
my position as a human being.
From this moment, I shall be
stepping down from Homo sapi
ens to take up a spot as a small
woodland creature, preferably a
cuddly one with large brown
eyes and a spot on the endan
gered species list.
What has prompted this
move, you ask? Shame, mostly.
I'm not sure I like to admit to
my humanness any more.
Recently, it's gotten to the
point where I've stopped shav
ing and I pretend to be a gibbon
when anyone addresses me. (My
furriness helps out my claim, as
do my repeated cries of "Oop!
Oop!")
But even that hasn't been
enough for me: Being a primate
is still a bit too close to
humankind on the evolutionary
tree for my comfort. Give us
another couple of million years,
a few mutations, and BAM! My
species will be back to the same
old idiotic tricks.
So the time has come for

more drastic measures; from
this moment on, you can just
call me Thumper Scott.
Of course, Ayn Rand is prob
ably dancing the Watusi in her
grave as I write this: How could
I claim that a dumb beast, with
out the powers of reason, could
be in any way superior to that
stellar jewel of the universe â€”
humankind? (Trumpet fanfare
and some dramatic lighting,
please.)
Just look around you.
Humanity simply isn't what
it used to be. The last time I
checked, no ground squirrels or
rabbits had invaded any small
Middle-Eastern nations and
threatened to use weaponry
that would turn your central
nervous system into the approx
imate equivalent of Baco-Bits.
We (us woodland creatures,
that is) haven't shot up any
churches full of women and chil
dren in western Africa lately
either. And our record on ozone
depletion looks pretty good, too.
And hey, so ground squirrels

haven't perfected any of the
marvels of culture or technology
that humankind has, like the B
-2 bomber, semi-automatic weap
ons (with or without bayonet
attachments), or Andrew Dice
Clay. But we're willing to live
with our shortcomings.
Of course, I suppose this
looks like I'm ducking the
responsibilities that go along
with being human. But what
would happen if we all abdicat
ed our spots? Heck, George
Bush already looks like a
weasel, so he's halfway there.
And say old Saddam Hussein
admits that all this time he's
actually just wanted to be a
ptarmigan. Instead of spending
all our time on "advanced"
activities (like warfare) we
could turn to some baser ani
mal pursuits: eating, drinking,
and (ahem) being merry.
So who's dumb?
