Limits on speech
restrict freedom
It has been over 40 years
since I last wrote to The Daily. I
am doing so because I wish to
add my voice to that of those
who are appalled at Stanford's
recent rule against free speech.
It is a travesty for an institution
with Stanford's motto to pro
mulgate such a doctrine.
As a Jew who grew up in
Hitler's world with Father
Coughlin spewing his anti-
Semitic filth on the radio week
ly, and then lived among many
people who wished for Hitler to
come to America to rid the
country of its Jews, I know well
the results of verbal harass
ment.
But I learned other things as
I grew older, two of which were
that nothing is without cost,
and that there is a price for lib
erty. Verbal slime, whether it is
pornography or racial slur, can
not be dealt with by legislation.
Any attempt to do so limits
the right of free speech to all,

and ends up being a greater evil
to society than that which it
attempts to control.
At my 40th reunion last year,
I submitted a r6sum6 which
stated that I had stopped giving
money to Stanford years ago
because I felt it had become a
bastion of liberal absurdity. I am
amazed that I must now criti
cize it for an act that I would
expect only from a totalitarian
authority.
I did not like much of what a
liberal faculty had created at my
alma mater, but I have always
been proud of being one of its
graduates. It has now succeeded
in making me ashamed.
Does anyone out there have a
blue and gold sweatshirt for
sale?

Dean's mistake
handled justly
I am writing to commend
University President Donald
Kennedy and the rest of his

administration for their actions
regarding Asst. Dean Diana
Conklin and her recent arrest
By not firing Conklin for
drug use at her home, Kennedy
has justly refused to add his
voice to those who seek to perse
cute individuals who are pushed
by societal forces into using
drugs.
Drug use in American society
has traditionally been regarded
as a criminal act that must be
punished regardless of personal
circumstances. Conklin is not a
criminal, just a person whose
unfortunate circumstances led
her to a desperate act.
The use of drugs should be
treated not by jailing the user,
but by treating the person in a
drug rehabilitation program.
If an administrator is arrest
ed for selling drugs, then
Kennedy would be justified in
dismissing the offender, particu
larly if the sales were to stu
dents. But in Conklin's case, the
administration made the correct
decision in allowing her to
retain her position with only a
mere reprimand.

Labeling races
is insensitive
I am writing to voice my
opposition to the term "colored
races."
The first time that I can
remember coming across the
term as used by the University
was in information sent to
international students. To that I
had an uneasy feeling. I read it
again in a University newspa
per, and that prompted me to
write.
To be fair, races in the world
are often classified according to
skin color as white, yellow, black
and red. As the four stand
equally, it is inappropriate (or
unscientific, or racist) to group
all non-whites under one label
of "colored."
I, as a "yellow," must ask if it
is appropriate to group "non
yellows" under one label too.
I hope that this can give peo
ple in favor of the elimination of
racism some food for thought.
