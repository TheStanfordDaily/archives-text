## U.S. acted out of self-interest 
### 
THE IRAQI invasion of Kuwait has
presented the United States with
a critical decision in post-Cold War
foreign policy, forcing America to define
its role in a new era in which regional
issues dominate the global pretensions
of superpowers.
President George Bush's decision to
send American land forces to Saudi
Arabia and enforce the Security Council's
economic embargo with a naval blockade
was simple from the perspective of Amer
ican domestic politics.
To have taken no military action
against the buildup of Iraqi forces near
the Saudi border would have been a po
litical disaster for Bush. The conse
quences to Western economies of an Iraqi
invasion of Saudi Arabia would have been
extreme, and the blame would have been
directed at the Oval Office.
While the consequences of presidential
indecision have been adequately explored
and sensationalized by the American
media with numerous references to the
appeasement of the 19305, the implica
tions of an American troop commitment
have yet to receive the attention it war
rants in terms of domestic politics, global
economics and regional interests.
The American electorate is not
prepared to accept the possible conse
quences of military action. Public opinion
polls have shown strong support for a
military response, but Americans are
generally short-sighted politically.
Willing to support military action, they
are unwilling to accept the consequences
of that support, which could entail the
media's pictures of chemical warfare in
the desert and flag-draped coffins return
ing on military transports.
The conflict in Kuwait has already put
into motion a number of economic
changes that will change the shape of
American and international politics.
With or without military action in the
Middle East, President Bush can do little
to forestall the recession that has been
lurking on the horizon. Rising oil and
gas prices will spark a general inflation

ary trend that will threaten to increase
the severity of the impending recession.
On a domestic level, budget negotia
tions between Congress and the Presi
dent must be altered to incorporate new
developments. Drastic military cuts are
currently not feasible; proposed gas tax
hikes cannot be implemented; the need
for tightened purse strings will conflict
with the need for increased spending in
light of the expected recession.
While American short-term interests
may be served by intervention, the move
could be detrimental in the long-run.
With Islamic fundamentalism and anti-
American sentiments dominant or on the
rise in states such as Iran, Libya, Algeria,
Tunisia and others, the American pres
ence can only solidify popular support
against America and its allies, including
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait.
As King Hussein of Jordan told a group
of American reporters at a dinner party
on Sunday night, the world must realize
that the motivations of the United States
must be judged on the basis of self
interest alone.
The king asked the reporters whether
the United States proposed worldwide
military action when the Syrians began
to occupy Lebanon or when the Israelis
occupied the West Bank. The answer, of
course, was no.
But in the case of the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, there is a dangerous impres
sion in the United States that it is our
oil that we are protecting, rather than
the natural resources of independent
countries upon which we have a critical
dependence.
This attitude subverts the complexities
of regional culture, history and politics
to the petty needs of American consum
ers, backed up by the military capabilities
to support such a dependence. President
Bush was correct in supporting our Saudi
allies, but the consequences of this de
cision need further political exploration.
