# The 						Middle East Crisis
## Hussein was caught in the act 
### 
PICTURE a child, face and arms
buried deep in a cookie jar,
straining to grab the last sugar
coated animal cracker.
For that moment, our sweet-toothed
little friend experiences bliss. But the
euphoria fades as his mother's voice
rises: caught in the act.
This rapid turn from defiance to
dejection is not unique to four-year-old
cookie thieves.
Think of poor Saddam Hussein, who
grabbed for Kuwait, one of the Persian
Gulfs brightest jewels, hoping that
bravado backed by a numerically
strong army would scare off other
countries.
In fact, Hussein's decision to roll
into Kuwait isolated Iraq in the world
community, leaving him without any
mfiyor allies.
Perhaps Hussein thought that a
common religion and hatred of Israel
would unite the Muslim world and
revitalize an alliance against which in
dustrialized nations would be power
less.
If so, Hussein'B greed for power and
money blinded him to the realities of
international relations. More than a
common religion or hatred of Israel,
the one thing which unites the leaders
of Arab nations is a desire to hold
onto and expand their own power.
The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran,
Syria and other Gulf states could only
see Iraq*B assault on Kuwait as a direct
threat to their political integrity.
Hussein's call to unite the Muslim
world in a holy war against western
industrialized nations is preposterous
on two levels: Hussein implicitly
placed himself at the head of the Arab
army, relegating other Arab leaders to
secondary status. He also ignored
Iran's desperate need for western cur
rency and Saudi Arabia's dependence
on the shield of U.S. power.

Hussein's "peace plan" — making
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait contin
gent on Israeli withdrawal from occu
pied territories — was speedily
dismissed as unacceptable.
In fact, Hussein has placed himself
in a no-win situation. He can hold out
in Kuwait, but he loses millions of
dollars in oil revenue every day,
driving an already weak economy into
further disrepair.
Sending his tanks across the sand
into Saudi Arabia would be suicidal.
Not only would he be at war with the
United States and Saudi Arabia, but
he would also face Egypt, Syria, Pakis
tan, the Gulf states, probably England
and Iran, and possibly NATO.
The media hype surrounding Hus
sein's million-man army cannot hide
the fact that Iraq was unable to
subdue Iran over an eight-year period.
Given that, Iraq could scarcely
defeat the largest alliance assembled
since World War 11.
Hussein's third option is to pull-out,
with his tail between his legs. Though
Iraq has robbed Kuwait of an esti
mated $3 billion, his prestige at home
and abroad would be shattered.
President Bush's response to Hus
sein's challenge, strong but not ir
responsibly aggressive, was masterful.
By lining up a broad spectrum of sup
port for an embargo of Iraq, Bush
established an incredibly strong posi
tion.
The principle of defending sovereign
nations from aggression is one that
cannot be compromised. The world has
drawn a line in the sand, and if Iraqi
troops cross that line, they must be
pushed back.
