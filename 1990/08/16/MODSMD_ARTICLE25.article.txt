## Puck in the Park 
### Wendy Witt Staff writer 
Songs from the '60s ring out
from a loudspeaker in Burgess
Park, setting the scene for the
Menlo Players Guild's innova
tive production of Shakespeare's
"A Midsummer Night's Dream,"
directed by John Higgins.
More than 100 people have
gathered, laden with blankets
and picnic baskets, in front of
a small wooden stage nestled
beneath a giant oak tree, waiting
for the free performance to
begin.
In the distance a left fielder,
squinting through the last rays
of the evening, catches a fly ball
as fans cheer. Closer, an out-of
control volleyball from the game
next door knocks over a picnick
er's wine glass as a commuter
train roars by.
Suddenly, the music is turned
up. "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Heart's Club Band" plays in the

background as cast membe
with white painted faces, mouse
ears and red tailcoats march
onto the stage.
They carry a white banner
displaying words from the song
being played: "We hope you will
enjoy the show ... Sit back and
let the evening go."
Welcome to San Francisco in
1967 — the Summer of Love.
Shakespeare might have trou
ble recognizing his characters in
miniskirts, headbands and other
'60s styles, but the words they
speak are unmistakably his.
At first this disparity between
the '60s setting and Shakespear
ean English, performed in the
middle of a busy picnic area in
California, 1990, is disturbing.
Add all this to the craziness
inherent in a play featuring
fairies, drugs and moonstruck
lovers and it's just plain confus
ing.
Nick Scoggin plays Theseus,
a 20th-century American ver
sion of the Duke of Athens, who
imagines himself as Oberon,
King of the Fairies.
In an interview, Scoggin said
he thinks the confusion is good.
"I want the audience to be con
fused, to think and ask ques
tions as well as being
entertained," he said.
Shakespeare's themes of love
and identity, illusion and reality,
the individual and the state, are
all ideally suited to the 19605,
a time of free love, flower
children, drugs and the Vietnam
War — in short, confusion.
The cast gives a good perform
ance overall. Seth Margolies is
especially captivating as the
bungling yet lovable Nick Bot
tom, and the mischievous goblin
Puck, played by Andrew
Sproule, is imaginatively
portrayed as a skeleton from the
Grateful Dead who appears in
an Uncle Sam suit.
Even before opening night,
the production was controver
sial. The city of Menlo Park pro
vided the Players Guild with a
giant American flag from the

Cow Palace to be painted over
and used as canvas flooring for
the outdoor stage.
The city informed him that
the flag could not remain on the
stage between performances.
Higgins offered to cover it, but
the city was unwilling to com
promise.
The city says the whole thing
is a misunderstanding; its not
a flag issue. Menlo Park has an
agreement with the guild to re
move all stage props from the
park except during perform
ances. So they say.
"We have groups all day in
the picnic area. First the stage
was gray and we told them to
paint it brown to be less in
trusive. If they had tie-dyed the
stage we would have told them
the same thing," said city offi
cial Mary Dupens.
However, Higgins and the cast
said they feel the city's action
is a blatant case of censorship.
The canvas must be attached to
the stage and can hardly be
removed and replaced before
every performance.
"The other members of the
cast are outraged, but I find the
kind of flag-waving Americans
indulge in and the reverence
they put into a piece of material
laughable," said Rebecca Dines,
a native of Australia who plays
Hippolyta and Titania.
Dupens said picking up the
flag after each performance is
not an insurmountable technical
problem, and the city has no
desire to interfere with anyone's
freedom of expression.
With or without the flag, Hig
gins has directed a provocative,
entertaining, bewildering and
demanding production. Theseus
gives valuable advice when he
says,"The best in this kind
(plays and players) are but
shadows; and the worst are no
worse, if imagination amend
them."
Admission is free every
Thursday through Sunday at 7
p.m. in Burgess Park through
Sept. 2.
