# Modern mutation of Moli√®re's 'Miser' is misguided
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Robert Kelley, in his adaptation of
Molidre's "The Miser," takes the plot
and characters created by the French
master of satire and moves them to
America, just days before the great
stock market crash of 1929.
Not only is the story rocketed into
the future, but every scene also takes
place within the context of a film,
supposedly to draw a parallel between
the greedy Hollywood movie moguls
of the 1920s and the excessive behav
ior Molidre observed in the courts of
Louis XIV.
While it may be insightful to com
pare the penny-pinching Harpagon to
an exploitative mogul, the use of a
movie set does nothing to move the
action forward. Is that confusing?
Well, so is the play.
It's a positive reflection on Molifcre
to say his characters are so universal
that they reflect the attitudes of
generations throughout history, and
the 1920's are ideal for showing an
era of indulgent social climbers.
But to layer this idea with a Hol
lywood movie set distracts from
Molifcre's excellent sense of humor,
and it seems inappropriate to use the
name of his classic play for this pro
duction.
Kelley, who also directs "The
Miser," begins Act I with a well-done

black-and-white silent film of Elise,
Harpagon's daughter, attempting to
drown herself in order to attract the
attention of the handsome Valdre, who
quickly and clumsily comes to her
rescue.
In the next scene, which takes place
in Elise's boudoir, a large movie
camera is placed on the stage, which
does little more than confuse the ac
tion while filming the back of the
actors' heads.
The camera and cameraman rarely
interact with the cast, but stay
onstage for every scene; it becomes
hard to figure out what is supposed
to be real (the play) and what is in
tended to be part of the movie. Other
than diluting the plot, the camera
serves little purpose.
The camera gimmick also seems to
be thrown in just to cause a few mu
sical numbers, with lyrics by Kelley
and music by Tom Lindblade. The
music is fine and the lvrics are clever
enough, but all of the razzmatazz
doesn't suffice for Molifcre's direct wit
ticism which is quite entertaining in
and of itself, without needing to be
dressed up.
Molii*re's comic devices are quite
simple: He takes a leading character
(in this case, Harpagon) and pushes
his worst trait to an extreme (in this
case, miserliness) so that he'll be the
butt of jokes and the object of tricks
played out by other likable characters,

who the audience becomes happy to
cheer on.
As Harpagon, Chris Ayles has to
work extremely hard to get a laugh.
He consistently displays his charac
ter's arrogance and greed, but his act
ing style varies from internal to
external. One minute he's all intro
spection and the next he's limping
about the stage with a pained expres
sion.
The plot centers around the wealthy
Harpagon's lust for Mariane, a charm
ing young beauty without a dowry.
Despite his love of money, Harpagon
enlists the matchmaker Frosine to ar
range their marriage, while also
scheming to arrange profitable but
unhappy marriages for his spendthrift
children Cleante and Elise. Cleante is
in love with Mariane and she with
him, and Harpagon's doings also work
to keep Elise and Valfere apart.
Many of the supporting actors give
fine performances, but they all look
like they're doing one-man shows.
They're missing an ensemble feeling,
and with all the other distractions
the director has thrown at them, the
show barely succeeds.
Robert Kelley has outdone himself
with "The Miser." He might have con
sidered the truth behind the saying
"less is more."
