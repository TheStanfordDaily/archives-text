# La
						Pastaia: little-known, well-liked

Now that the summer is almost
over and the most exciting thing left
to do in Palo Alto is watch reruns of
"The Simpsons," it comes as a nice
surprise to discover a restaurant that
brings a little spice to life.
The restaurant I am referring to is
La Pastaia, a place I noticed a while
ago, after seeing some avant-garde
movie next door at the Aquarius.
It took Borne time for me to finally
get around to eating there, and when
I did, the restaurant was packed. This
came as a surprise to me as I had
never seen any advertisements for it.
I later found out that La Pastaia does
not advertise at all, making its
popularity solely a result of word of
mouth.
As my companion and I sat down
for dinner, we were immediately given
breadsticks along with an Italian egg
plant dip, parmesan cheese and butter.
Though I like the bread served at
most restaurants, this was a nice
change.
We soon found that the menu had
a tempting array of pastas, meats,
salads and appetizers, as well as a

large selection of daily specials. In
fact, each day a new menu is printed
out, with a different list of specials,
ensuring that no two trips you make
to La Pastaia are the same.
We decided to begin our dinner with
melanzane alia griglia, which is grilled
eggplant with goat cheese and balsam.
It was a very exotic appetizer, and
even those who cringe at the thought
of eggplant might find it tasty.
Next, we shared an order of linguine
al pomodoro — tomato sauce flavored
with garlic and oregano. The pasta
was undoubtedly fresh and the sauce
was nice and light, making this a great
"Primo" (first) course. We were also
informed that the dish is low in fat,
making it perfect for the health
conscious individual.
For our main course, we selected
polio alia griglia, which was grilled
chicken breast with sautded vegeta
bles. The chicken and vegetables were
carefully prepared — not at all over
cooked — and the portion was gener
ous. In addition, all the food is served
in an artistic manner, which always
adds a nice touch to eating out.
By then we were quite full, but
could not resist sharing an order of
Italian custard with lady fingers.

Along with Italian coffee, the dessert
was a nice light way to end a great
dinner.
While our dinner tended to consist
of lighter entries, there are also many
rich dishes to satisfy those with hear
tier appetites. The manager claims
their ravioli with a sage butter stock
is a popular example of a heavier
entree.
Great food is not the only reason
word of mouth has made this restau
rant so popular. The other quite con
spicuous reason is its moderate prices.
For example, all pasta dishes are
priced between $6.75 and $8.95, and
are more than enough for one, if not
two, persons.
In fact, by sharing a pasta and a
main dish, for which a service charge
of $1.25 for split orders is charged,
you can have a great dinner for two
Great food in an upbeat atmosphere
combined with reasonable prices
makes La Pastaia a great place to
break the summer boredom, and it is
definitely worth leaving the T.V. set.
And though you won't find any ad
vertisements, you should make
reservations.
La Pastaia is located at 420 Emer
son in downtown Palo Alto.
