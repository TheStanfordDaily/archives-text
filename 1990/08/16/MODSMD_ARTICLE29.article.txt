# Tesh grooves

Let's just say I was skeptical.
After all, the album is a compilation of
music from the CBS News coverage of the
Tour de France. It's also the second album
generated from the event's music. And the
artist just happens to be John Tesh, plain
faced cohort of Mary Hart on Entertainment
Tonight.
I was willing to listen, however, since the
Juilliard-trained Tesh has won two Emmy
Awards for music, as well as two New York
Music Awards in the jazz category for his
two previous recordings. That made the
music credible, but I thought, "It's still John
Tesh."
Surprisingly, the album is full of enjoyable
and serious instrumental music. Although
reworked and freshly recorded for the al
bum, "Tour de France: The Early Years"
still has the feel of television coverage music,
but it's really good television coverage music.
The best tracks on the album include
"Dijon Strut," which has the truest jazz feel
thanks largely to Vince Den ham's sax lines
and prolonged solos.
A final note of warning to those who
listen to the album and find themselves
enjoying it: It may be good music, but re
member, it's still John Tesh.
