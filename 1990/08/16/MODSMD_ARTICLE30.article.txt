# Don't fly on 'Air America'
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
During the 1980's, the movie industry inun
dated the market with films about Vietnam. From
"Platoon" to "Good Morning Vietnam," this
string of war movies examined every aspect of
life and death in a country which greatly altered
America.
With the 1990 release of "Air America," how
ever, Hollywood has shown its lack of innovative
talent and shifted its focus from one land that
was once part of Trench Indochina to another:
Laos, Vietnam's neighbor in Southeast Asia.
Instead of viewing the trials and tribulations
of the war itself, this film presents a story of
the covert supply wars the government never
acknowledged.
Based in Laos, where Nixon claimed, "there
are no American soldiers," a group of civilian
pilots aided by Air Force and CIA officials fly
supplies to villages opposing the North Viet
namese intrusion. Starring as members of this
motley crew are Mel Gibson and Robert Downey,
Jr.
Gibson plays, of course, the guy with a hard
exterior, the untouchable veteran who is loyal to
his friends but has seen too much to care anymore.
Downey complements Gibson's original and cut

ting portrayal by playing the role of the young,
idealistic pilot from Los Angeles who can't com
promise his morals to conform to "the system."
This ever-so-unique and realistic character at
tempts, in a cocksure manner, to bring down all
the evil around him.
Okay, maybe I'm being a bit harsh. Gibson
and Downey do a decent job of acting. It's the
plot and the other actors in this story that make
the movie bad.
There are, naturally, bad guys. These include
a CIA man who'll do anything to make sure that
the Supreme Commander of the Laotian forces
(another evil-doer) gets his crops of opium
delivered.
On the side of good, in addition to the pilots,
is an embarrassingly stereotypical United States
senator who visits Laos to uncover the drug scam.
Unfortunately this man, as an actor and a char
acter, probably couldn't uncover his rear to go
to the bathroom.
Some of the scenes in this movie are exciting
and some are even funny, but it seems that
whoever produced this script couldn't decide
which direction he wanted to go.
Combine all of these bland elements into one
pot, and you get a dish that doesn't quite leave
a bad taste in your mouth, but isn't anything
you'd want to try again.
