mo' better Definition: 1 even
better than, much better than
2 a slang term used in Wash
ington, D.C. to mean making
love 3 the theme of Spike Lee's
new film, "mo' better blues."
Lee's film is about mo' better
— h la definition 2 — and all
that it entails for jazz musician
Bleek Gilliam, played by Denzel
Washington. The movie involves
those in love, those who fear
love and those who use love.
The ambience of the film is
exquisite. The characters are
wonderful, the plot is interest
ing, the cinematography is
refreshingly different and dy
namic. The music is melodious
and moving, the comedy is quite
effective, and the set is realistic.
Everything is great. Every
thing but the script. Lee's writ
ing manages to put a damper

on everything else the movie has
going for it.
"mo' better blues" attempts
to tell the story of a saxophonist,
Bleek Gilliam. Gilliam is devoted
to his music, allowing for no
interruptions except an occa
sional bit of "mo' better" or, as
more directly put by Gilliam
himself, a bit of "bonin'."
In the movie, Gilliam loses
his jazz career, then finds love;
which is, in reality, all there is.
Unfortunately, this theme, that
love is everything, gets muddled
in the film's ambience, as beau
tiful as it is.
While depicting the develop
ment of Gilliam as a character,
Lee manages to address male
resistance to and rejection of
commitment, male sexist atti
tudes towards women and
unbelievable female tolerance of
such male immaturity and sel
fishness.
He does not, however, con

sider the why's, not to mention
the how's, of these particular
issues.
"Mo' better" facets of the
movie involve the acting.
The actors perform quite well.
The academy award-winning
(and handsome) Denzel Wash
ington gives Gilliam life and
realism. Cynda Williams, a new
face in film, creates in her char
acter a genuinely strong, inde
pendent and positive
African-American woman. Wes
ley Snipes plays Shadow Hen
derson, Gilliam's nemesis, with
charm and finesse.
Overall, "mo' better blues" of
fers a refreshing portrayal of
African-Americans, as do all of
Spike Lee's films. Although not
perfect in his handling of
various important issues, Lee
does display insight and courage
in attempting to portray and
cope with such emotional, diffi
cult and confusing topics.
