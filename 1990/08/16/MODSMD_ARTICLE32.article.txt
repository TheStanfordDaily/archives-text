# 'Problem Child' has problems
## 
### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
What could be more enjoyable
than watching a kids' film about
an adorable seven-year-old who
gets adopted? Being spanked, for
one thing.
Or, better yet, giving a spank
ing to the director of "Problem
Child," a film that has to rank
among the most irritating crea
tions ever to appear on the silver
screen.
In its nominally brief but exr
istentially eternal hour-and-a
half passage, "Problem Child"
manages to annoy its viewers.
Not even the ten-year-olds in the
audience were laughing.
The film's premise that people
like to see a child scream trite
and often vulgar lines at the top
of his lungs, while hitting mem
bers of his Little League team
with a baseball bat, strikes out.
To begin with, the kid
(Michael Oliver), an orphan im
probably named Junior, isn't
particularly cute. He could use
a new haircut and a new voice,
as the whines that his present
windpipe emits annoy rather
than endear.
However, the tyke cannot be
blamed for the poor lines that
are Junior's greatest flaw. A sec
ond grader can't understand
statements like, "Well, hurry the
hell up. I'm not getting any
younger," so you can hardly ex
pect Oliver to deliver them con
vincingly.

Some of Junior's lines would
be ridiculous no matter who ut
tered them. On first spying his
hapless adoptive parents, Junior
comments, "They look like a
couple of yahoos." Since the only
people who use the word
"yahoo" are themselves yahoos,
any laughter this remark may
inspire is at the expense of the
film itself.
Still, you can't deny that the
parents really are yahoos. The
dad, Ben, played by the insup
pressible John Ritter, wants
nothing more than to go
camping with Junior. Ben's sick
ening "good father" persona
makes you want to hit him just
to see how long it takes him to
hit back. Which, of course, is
just what Junior does.
All it takes is one little girl's
birthday party where Junior,
dressed in a devil costume,
chooses to express his artistic
urges by putting the presents in
the swimming pool and a frog
in the punch.
Just in case these ancient gags
don't make a bang, Junior also
exchanges firecrackers for the
birthday candles in the cake.
Unfortunately, none of
Junior's stunts inspires any
thing more monumental than a
yawn, and despite well
orchestrated footage of the little
hostess throwing a temper
tantrum to the song, "It's My
Party and I'll Cry if I Want To/'
the birthday bash is a flop.
The party does accomplish

Junior's goal of infuriating Ben.
Though Ben's efforts to be a
model dad include studying
three books on parenting, titled,
"How to Be a Good Father,"
"Discipline for Your Child" and
"The Exorcist," in that order,
he ends up trying to smother
Junior with a pillow bearing the
cross-stitched words "Home
Sweet Home."
As if an annoying dad and an
annoying kid weren't enough,
the film throws in an annoying
mom and an adoption agent
played by the strident Gilbert
Gottfried, whose speech and
manner would befit a used car
salesman.
The mother, who wears a dif
ferent animal print blouse for
nearly every scene in the show,
wants a child only to obtain
membership in what she per
ceives as the most exclusive
social circle in town â€” parent
hood. We are lucky that Mom
is disposed of neatly, if not clean
ly, when she rides off into the
sunset in the bed of a manure
truck.
All in all, if Ben's claim that
he has "adopted Satan" can be
trusted, "Problem Child" gives
new meaning to the concept of
the banality of evil.
"Problem Child" offers you,
at best, an opportunity to fidget
in your seat like a bored seven
year-old and ponder questions
like why Century 10 doesn't ac
cept passes or coupons to this
dreadful show.
