# 'Flatliners' falls flat
## 
### William Thomas Staff writer 
In one of his later works,
"Beyond Good and Evil,"
Freidrich Nietzsche exclaims,
"The will to truth, which is still
going to tempt us to many a
hazardous enterprise: what
questions this will to truth has
already set before us!"
Nietzsche goes on to lose his
sanity dissolving the very idea
of truth, but in "Flatliners,"
four medical school students
take on the hazardous enter
prise of seeking truth after
death.
Nelson Wright (Kiefer Suth
erland) is driven to make history
as the first person to induce
death under controlled condi
tions and then have himself
brought back after a brief period
of time.
It is a very compelling idea,
one that has demanded direct
attention from many great
thinkers — Sigmund Freud, for
example. In this age of advanced
medical techniques and soulless,
cutthroat med-school students,
this plot seems plausible. How
ever, such dry, abstract intellec
tual discussion and social
commentary are most of what
"Flatliners" has going for it.
And after it is introduced very
early in the movie, following the
beginning sequence of camera
shots featuring a wonderful se
lection of the gargoyles of

Chicago's Loyola University, the
film dies and there is no one to
perform CPR. You see, the plot
has little to do with all this
searching for truth. It has to do
with the psychologically depen
dent nightmares that these stu
dents bring back with them.
The poorly written script in
hibits any potential for quality
performances from the five ac
tors. Competitiveness, guilt and
letting go of the past are written
in with a heavy-handed style.
Furthermore, the special ef
fects are incredibly low-budget:
VCR tricks, colored lighting and
smoke combine with an ever
present low synthesized hum
(ominous, I suppose) to recreate
the glory days of Freddy
Kreuger.
In fact, "Flatliners" even
employs footage of children and
the sounds of children singing
along with a music box, ele
ments that "Nightmare on Elm
Street" made famous.
"Religion failed, philosophy
failed, so I guess it's up to the
physical sciences." So says Nel
son as he entices his fellow stu
dents to risk career and more
in the name of science. Unfortu
nately, this film is not up to the
tough issues raised by such a
challenge, especially not in the
complex world of '90s' yuppie
medicine. If "Flatliners" is to
represent science, then score one
for religion and philosophy.
