# Hothouse Flowers hits 'Home' good and hard
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
"Home" is definitely where
the heart of Hothouse Flowers
is.
In the follow-up to the rough
and ready "People," the Irish
band wears its heart on its
sleeve â€” and encourages lis
teners to do the same. With an
optimism that cuts to the core
of their music, Hothouse
Flowers leaves you confident
that one's ideals and idealism
can be maintained even in a
world of grim realities.
Consider this bit of philoso
phy from "Give It Up": "It
doesn't really matter if you're
all/Jumbled up inside/As long as
you know love is/Endless and
the world is wide." This band's
not about hearts and flowers
and saving the world in a day;
it's about real people dealing
with a real world in the only
way they can.
Using the rich imagery of the

best Irish poets, songs like
"Water" carry a stream of mixed
messages. There's hope in
hardship: "I'm sitting here
looking at this road/Looks like
it's getting longer/I've been car
rying a heavy load and now/I'm
praying for some water."
There's a Biblical sense of
doom: "I see storm clouds
ahead/What will we do
then/Build shelter from the
rain/Heavy heavy rain."
And there's a desperate cry
for change: "They're poisoning
our streams/Polluting all our
oceans/And I hope we get an
answer/Before heaven's gate
pours down."
Musically, the band pulls to
gether a tightly woven knit of
traditional folk and rock sounds
fronted by a heavy dose of lively
piano and organ. Rounded out
by the throaty vocals of Liam
O'Maonlai and several har
monious backing choruses,
"Home" has the heart of folk
and the energy of rock.
