# Wagner's operas can be comical
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
Opera is not for everyone.
Admit it, as "cultured" as we'd all
like to be, it's pretty hard to spend
large sums of money to see a bunch
of overweight people in Viking hel
mets running around screaming in
some language that we don't under
stand and probably couldn't decipher
even if we did speak it fluently.
So what's the alternative? How can
we fortify ourselves for the next time
Wagner's "Ring of the Nibelung"
comes up in casual conversation?
It may sound ludicrous, but comic
books could be the answer.

Eclipse Books has now released two
comic-book adaptations of operas. The
first, Wagner's "Ring," was fairly suc
cessful on the comic market.
Adapted to graphic version by E
Craig Russell, "The Magic Flute"
recounts the tale of Prince Tamino,
who, bored with his straightlaced
princely duties, wishes for some ex
citement.
Suddenly (aren't things usually sud
den in this type of story?), the Queen
of the Night appears and offers him
the quest of rescuing Pamina from
the evil Sarastro. With the aid of the
Queen's magic flute and his comical
(no pun intended) sidekick Papageno,
Tamino sets off on his search to find

the princess and win her hand in mar
riage.

Russell, who has also worked on
"Ariane and Bluebeard" and the
adaptations of Clive Barker's stories
in the "Tapping the Vein" series, pro
vides excellent artwork to transmit
the opera's emotional content to the
reader. The scenes, clearly depicted
and well-drawn, vibrate with the color
and form that requires great singers
to create on stage.
While certainly not a substitute for
going to the real thing in an opera
house, comic adaptations like "The
Magic Flute" can shed light on a
storyline before attendance.
