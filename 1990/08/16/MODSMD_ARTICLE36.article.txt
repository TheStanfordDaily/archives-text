## Cardinal golfer nearly wins U.S. Amateur

If only it were 18 holes.
Stanford junior Stephanie
Davis fought off some long odds
to reach the final of the U.S.
Women's Amateur at the Canoe
Brook Country Club in Summit,
N.J., but could not hold off San
Jose State senior Pat Hurst.
Davis, who before the tourna
ment said she had as good a
chance of winning as the Seattle
Mariners had of winning the
World Series, held a three-hole
lead after 18 holes Sunday.
But the final of the tourna
ment is 36 holes and Hurst, the
1989 NCAA champion, made up
the difference on the second trip
around the club's North Course.
Davis then got into trouble on
the first playoff hole and
conceeded the hole, and the title,
to Hurst.
Davis, who was a second-team
All-Pacific 10 Conference selec
tion last year while leading the
Cardinal to an eighth-place
finish at the NCAA Champion
ships, played very well all week.
But Hurst won five of the first
eight holes in the afternoon
round to make up the deficit
and fought off Davis the rest of
the way.
On the par-4 37th hole both
players hit their tee shots into
the fairway, then Hurst put a
five-iron eight feet from the pin.
Davis hit her second shot too
far right and it rolled into the
deep rough.
Although she has a great
short game, Davis could only get

her chip to within 18 feet of the
bad lie. Davis missed her par
putt, and after Hurst left her
birdie putt within a foot of the
hole, the Bainbridge Island,
Wash., native conceded the par
to Hurst.
Hurst, from San Leandro,
Calif., had played 13-under golf
in winning the five matches on
her way to the final.
In the morning Davis had her
putter to thank for her lead.
She drained five putts from nine
or more feet to either win or
halve holes in the first trip
around the course. Davis was
2-up going into the 17th, a par-5
the long-hitting Hurst usually
reached in two. Davis appeared
to be in trouble when she had
to take an unplayable lie after
her tee shot but she sank an
18-foot putt for par. Hurst
bogeyed, three-putting from
about 10 feet.
Davis then sank a 25-foot putt
to halve the 18th.
Hurst came back to take a
lead after eight holes of the af
ternoon round. Davis tied her
on 11 but gave the lead back
on 16. She birdied 17 to tie and
both players sank short par
putts on 18 before going to the
first tee for the third time.
The tournament began a week
ago Monday with the first of
two rounds of qualifying. Davis
tied for ninth after the two
rounds to gain one of the 64
spots in the single-elimination
portion of the tournament.
Cardinal senior Jodi Figley
also advanced to the elimination
competition but lost to Hurst in
the first round, 1-up. Davis won

her first-round and second
round matches last Wednesday,
then won twice again Thursday
to reach the semifinals.
Rain postponed the semifinals
from Friday to Saturday, when
Davis met former Wake Forest
player Karen Noble. Davis
played even par for 16 holes,
winning 4-and-2. Davis nailed a
40-foot putt on the 14th hole to
go 3-up and put it effectively
out of reach.
Hurst, meanwhile, came from
behind twice to defeat French
Amateur champion Delphine
Bourson 2-up. Hurst used her
long hitting to take the lead with
a birdie on the par-5 17th and
also won 18 to reach the final.
The Spartan senior had
defeated defending champion
Vicki Goetze in the quarter
finals. Hurst had the lowest
score in the stroke play part of
the competition last year but
lost her first-round match.
Davis, Figley, and juniors
Adele Moore, Martha Richards
and Audrey Wooding will be
reunited at Stanford soon as the
Cardinal squad is preparing for
a trip to Japan. Stanford is one
of four U.S. teams selected to
play in a tournament there the
first week of September.
Davis, Figley, Moore and
Wooding are the nucleus of the
Cardinal teams that have re
corded two consecutive top-10
finishes at the NCAA champi
onships. Richards, a guard on
the NCAA champion women's
basketball team, will miss much
of the golf regular season before
rejoining the team after basket
ball ends in March.
