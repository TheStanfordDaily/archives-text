# Pac-10 expansion unlikely for now
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
According to reports published
throughout the country over the past
two months, any of about 15 different
schools could be joining the Pacific
10 Conference sometime soon.
According to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, however, none will.
"It's not going to happen," Geiger
said. "We're not going to expand in
the near future. I may be wrong but
I saw no groundswell of support."
Geiger and the other Pac-10 athletic
directors and primary women's ad
ministrators attended a special meet
ing Saturday to discuss expansion.
But while several people see increas
ing the size of the conference as a
desirable goal, Geiger feels that no
specific solution will be worked out.
The administrators discussed the

idea at great length but tabled the
issue and have scheduled no further
meetings for the purpose of re-opening
discussion.
When the Big Ten Conference an
nounced it was planning to add Penn
State to its ranks several months ago,
athletic departments began getting
nervous. Many newspapers and
magazines have run stories stating
that large super-conferences are the
way of the future because they in
crease the amount of television reve
nue a conference can earn for its mem
ber schools. With athletic departments
everywhere falling well into the red,
schools feared that if they did not
jump at this trend, it would be too
late.
Arkansas made the second move in
the conference wars, announcing a
jump from the Southwest Conference
to the Southeastern Conference last

week. That move left the remaining
SWC schools in limbo and league
powers Texas and Texas A&M have
both been connected frequently to the
Pac-10 in newspaper reports. The ad
vantage of adding the two SWC would
be to give the Pac-10 control of the
Dallas and Houston television
markets, bringing the league's total
market share to 20 percent of the
country.
But Geiger feels that expansion will
not happen soon because of the way
the league would be broken up. Adding
the SWC duo would allow the Pac-10
to divide into Northern and Southern
divisions, but Stanford would be in
the Northern. Thus the Cardinal
would not be grouped with powers,
and traditional rivals, like UCLA,
USC and Texas.
"I don't see a scenario now," Geiger
said.
