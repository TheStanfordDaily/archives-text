# Strange summer suits synchro swimmers

While the minority of Stanford stu
dents are spending the summer in
offices, internships, and research labs,
four members of the Stanford syn
chronized swimming team are in
volved in a much more unusual
activity. They are performing in a
nightly synchronized swimming show
at Sea World in San Diego.
The cast is comprised of a total of
eight swimmers who are all at na
tional team level and have been swim
ming for an average of 12 years.
Stanford, which has been ranked sec
ond in the country for the past four
years, is represented by sophomore
Mandy Blake, junior Melinda Downey
and June graduates Debbie Brear and
Ginny Cohn. Four other swimmers
representing Ohio State and the Santa
Clara Aquamaids team make up the

rest of the cast.
The show, which is performed twice
nightly in the Marine Mammal Sta
dium at Sea World, is a rigorous, fast
paced routine that combines three
team routines, a duet and a solo. The
stadium houses the dolphin shows
during the daytime and holds up to
3,500 people. Approximately 5,000
people attend the two shows each
night and over 500,000 will have seen
it by the end of the summer.
"I applied for the show because I
felt it would be an excellent opportu
nity to promote our sport in front of
more than half a million people, and
to increase public knowledge of the
rigors and demands of synchronized
swimming," says Brear, a four-time
All-American.
"We are pioneers of an advancement
in our rapidly-growing sport," Blake
adds. "Synchronized swimming shows
of this caliber have never been done

in a park that attracts millions of
people each year."
The ground-breaking work is re
warding but the swimmers still have
daily obstacles to overcome. The pool,
which houses the dolphins in side-pens
overnight, is kept at a high salt con
centration and at temperatures 20
degrees lower than an average swim
ming pool. Visibility is less than a
foot, pool patterns are difficult to
maintain, eyes get very sore, and the
1 rigidity of the water hinders breath
control and muscle sharpness Never
theless, the experienced swimmers
have adapted well to the harsh con
ditions and the show appears as
precise and effortless as any other
exhibition in any other pool.
The most demanding aspects of the
show are not, in fact, the physical
factors, but the mental factors. Cohn,
