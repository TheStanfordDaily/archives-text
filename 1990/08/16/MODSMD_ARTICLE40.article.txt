Pac-10 women 3-0
on European tour
Much like the fates of their
National Team counterparts,
the Pacific 10 Conference's
men's and women's basketball
teams are having differing
degrees of success.
The women are off to a 3-0
start in West Germany with
junior Chris MacMurdo playing
a big role. MacMurdo, the Car
dinal representative on the 10-
women team, scored 21 points
on 9-of-13 shooting to lead the
Pac-10 squad to a 79-56 win over
Szekszard of Hungary Friday.
Saturday MacMurdo had
eight rebounds to help the U.S.
to a 99-83 win over Leverkusen.
Monday the Americans posted
a surprising 72-71 win over
Dusseldorf-Agon in a very tight
game. Dusseldorf-Agon is the
defending West German club
champion.
On the men's side the Pac-10
began the tour with back-to
back losses to Germany's top
two teams. Senior guard John

Patrick had nine points, four
assists and four steals Saturday
in a 103-93 loss to defending
West German champ Lever
kusen Bayer 04.
Sunday Stanford's starting
point guard had 11 points, three
assists and four steals in a 102-
100 loss to West German pro
league runner-up Hagen-
Brandt. Monday Patrick
struggled as the Pac-10 team
defeated Bamberg TTL 86-62.
But Bamberg got its revenge
the next night in a physical 132-
108 win. Patrick had seven
points, four rebounds and six
assists but the Americans got
hammered inside.
McEnroe, Connors
to play at Maples
After a 12-year absence, John
McEnroe is back.
No, he's not taking classes.
And NO, he's not going to lead
the Cardinal to its fourth con
secutive NCAA title. But
McEnroe, who won the NCAA
singles title here as a freshman

in 1978 before turning pro, will
be back in town next month.
McEnroe and his longtime
nemesis, Jimmy Connors, high
light an eight-player exhibition
tournament that will be held in
Maples Pavilion Sept. 13-16. The
event is being sponsored by the
International Management
Group and tickets for all ses
sions are available through
BASS.
Two quarterfinals will be
played both Thursday and Fri
day nights with the winners ad
vancing to the semifinals Sat
urday night. The finals will be
late Sunday afternoon.
U.S. baseball loses
twice at worlds
The U.S. baseball team has
seen its hopes of a repeat gold
medal at the world champion
ships fall rapidly in Edmonton,
Alberta. After easily advancing
to the quarterfinals the 1988
Olympic gold medalists ran into
some hot pitching by a pair of

South Koreans and a
Taiwanese.
Kim Do-Wan and Chung Min-
Tae combined to strike out 17
and lead South Korea to a 5-3
win over the U.S. Pitcher Aaron
Sele did not give up a hit until
the sixth inning, but the first
hit he did give up was a three
run home run. The U.S. made
three errors in that inning.
The South Koreans added a
pair in the eighth to win despite
producing only three hits. Car
dinal junior David McCarty, who
leads Team USA in hitting, was
one of only two Americans who
did not strike out Sunday.
Monday the Americans were
upset 10-7 by Taiwan as Kuo
Lee Chien-fu struck out 18 bat
ters. The U.S. has to beat Cuba,
the top amateur team in the
world, to even have a chance at
a bronze medal.
The U.S. team also includes
junior shortstop Roger Burnett
and junior catcher Troy Tall
man. The three all started for
the Stanford team that posted
the best record in school history
and advanced to the College
World Series semifinal game last
June.
