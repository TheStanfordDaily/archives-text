# Workshop stresses Third World
## Agricultural policy-makers gain analytical skills 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
Representatives from many
Third World countries are on
campus this month attending
the Agricultural Policy Confer
ence sponsored by Stanford's
Food Research Institute.
These 14 government repre
sentatives, university professors
and private researchers from
countries including El Salvador,
Antigua, Honduras, Cameroon
and Lebanon are learning "how
to apply standard tools to
agricultural policy," said course
instructor Carl Gotsch, profes
sor of agricultural economics at
Stanford.
The course manual, titled
"Policy Analysis Matrix," intro
duces a systematic way of
analyzing data. The workshop
stresses computation, providing
practical, hands-on, computer
based exercises.
Errol Graham, agricultural
economist and planner for the
Jamaican government, said,
"One problem with Jamaican
policy is that analyses have not
been available." From this
course he is getting the
framework to make these
analyses, which later will be
used to help government offi
cials make good policies, he said.
Making these analyses avail
able to underdeveloped nations
is very important, because,
"Third World countries have a
major consensus to move to free
trade," said Graham.
When Yolanda Azarcon, a con
sultant for the Philippine gov
ernment, returns to her country,
her first project will be to
analyze rice production, which
accounts for two-thirds of the
country's agricultural output.
Then she will look at the current
government rice policies to see
if the Philippines should con
tinue to subsidize farmers.
Unfortunately, even with fig
ures which document that taxes
or subsidies are hurting the
economy, Azarcon said she still
might have a problem persuad
ing the government to change
its policy. The Philippines, like
many Third World countries,
has a historical policy bias,

Third World countries are not the only
countries operating under non-economically
efficient policies. The United States, Europe
and Japan are all 'economfs distorters/ too.

meaning the government uses
some agricultural products as a
source of tax revenue instead of
as a catalyst for growth.
Since some government offi
cials are more concerned with
the interests of their constitu
ents than with their country's
overall economic condition,
many countries will continue to
produce revenue by taxing the
poor.
However, Gotsch hopes some
representatives will be success
ful in persuading their govern
ments to make changes. For
example, he hopes the represen
tative from Egypt will do an
analysis of the policy bias in
cotton in his country.
The Egyptian government
forces farmers to sell cotton at
a very cheap price, and then sells
it at a much higher price in the
international market.
In addition to determining
whether or not to tax or sub
sidize products, the analyses
provide information as to
whether a country should
produce a product or, instead,
import it, said Willis Oluoch-
Kosura, a professor at the Uni
versity of Nairobi in Kenya.
Unfortunately, when debating
whether to produce a product
at home or to import it, in ad
dition to policy bias, there are
other stumbling blocks for
policy changes. "Prestige and
politics come into play," said
Oluoch-Kosura.
Many small nations refuse to
specialize in the few crops which
the country produces most
cheaply and quickly, and then
sell them on the international
market. Instead, they produce
many different crops, including
those which would cost much
less to buy at the international
price from another country.
Despite the higher price,
many Third World countries

sacrifice efficiency in order to
avoid being dependent on an
other country, since they do not
believe they could fight a
boycott.
Third World nations are not
the only countries operating un
der non-economically efficient
policies, said Gotsch. The United
States, Europe and Japan are
all "economic distorters," too.
Using products requiring a lot
of manual assembly as an ex
ample, Gotsch said the United
States should not produce these
products because our labor is so
expensive. Instead, he believes
we should buy them products
at international prices from a
country with much cheaper
labor.
The world economic situation
which would enable countries to
experience the most growth
would be if all international
prices were set the same. In this
scenario, Gotsch said, everyone
would do what they do best and
would trade it, instead of the
current situation where coun
tries are also producing things
they are not so good at.
Azarcon said Gotsch is going
to give a workshop in Manila,
Philippines, within the next
year, which 15 to 20 people in
the senior level of the govern
ment and the department of
agriculture will attend.
Gotsch said each year he
learns something new about dif
ferent country's economic sys
tems by talking with conference
participants. This year he is
learning about some of the pit
falls of an economy with no
government intervention by
speaking with the representa
tives from Lebanon. The
Lebanese use international
units to purchase everything —
dollars for American goods,
Deutsche marks for German
goods and so on.

"Third World countries have a
major consensus to move to free
trade," said Graham.
When Yolanda Azarcon, a con
sultant for the Philippine gov
ernment, returns to her country,
her first project will be to
analyze rice production, which
accounts for two-thirds of the
country's agricultural output.
Then she will look at the current
government rice policies to see
if the Philippines should con
tinue to subsidize farmers.
Unfortunately, even with fig
ures which document that taxes
or subsidies are hurting the
economy, Azarcon said she still
might have a problem persuad
ing the government to change
its policy. The Philippines, like
many Third World countries,
has a historical policy bias,

Third World countries are not the only
countries operating under non-economically
efficient policies. The United States, Europe
and Japan are all 'economfs distorters/ too.

meaning the government uses
some agricultural products as a
source of tax revenue instead of
as a catalyst for growth.
Since some government offi
cials are more concerned with
the interests of their constitu
ents than with their country's
overall economic condition,
many countries will continue to
produce revenue by taxing the
poor.
However, Gotsch hopes some
representatives will be success
ful in persuading their govern
ments to make changes. For
example, he hopes the represen
tative from Egypt will do an
analysis of the policy bias in
cotton in his country.
The Egyptian government
forces farmers to sell cotton at
a very cheap price, and then sells
it at a much higher price in the
international market.
In addition to determining
whether or not to tax or sub
sidize products, the analyses
provide information as to
whether a country should
produce a product or, instead,
import it, said Willis Oluoch-
Kosura, a professor at the Uni
versity of Nairobi in Kenya.
Unfortunately, when debating
whether to produce a product
at home or to import it, in ad
dition to policy bias, there are
other stumbling blocks for
policy changes. "Prestige and
politics come into play," said
Oluoch-Kosura.
Many small nations refuse to
specialize in the few crops which
the country produces most
cheaply and quickly, and then
sell them on the international
market. Instead, they produce
many different crops, including
those which would cost much
less to buy at the international
price from another country.
Despite the higher price,
many Third World countries

sacrifice efficiency in order to
avoid being dependent on an
other country, since they do not
believe they could fight a
boycott.
Third World nations are not
the only countries operating un
der non-economically efficient
policies, said Gotsch. The United
States, Europe and Japan are
all "economic distorters," too.
Using products requiring a lot
of manual assembly as an ex
ample, Gotsch said the United
States should not produce these
products because our labor is so
expensive. Instead, he believes
we should buy them products
at international prices from a
country with much cheaper
labor.
The world economic situation
which would enable countries to
experience the most growth
would be if all international
prices were set the same. In this
scenario, Gotsch said, everyone
would do what they do best and
would trade it, instead of the
current situation where coun
tries are also producing things
they are not so good at.
Azarcon said Gotsch is going
to give a workshop in Manila,
Philippines, within the next
year, which 15 to 20 people in
the senior level of the govern
ment and the department of
agriculture will attend.
Gotsch said each year he
learns something new about dif
ferent country's economic sys
tems by talking with conference
participants. This year he is
learning about some of the pit
falls of an economy with no
government intervention by
speaking with the representa
tives from Lebanon. The
Lebanese use international
units to purchase everything —
dollars for American goods,
Deutsche marks for German
goods and so on.
