New affirmative action officer
The University has appointed a women's rights
activist to serve as its new affirmative action
officer.
Sharon Parker, chair of the Board of Directors
of the National Institute for Women of Color in
Washington, D.C., and a Washington lobbyist for
Girls Clubs of America, Inc., said the primary
challenge of her job will be to help Stanford
define multiculturalism within the campus com
munity and as a potential model for others.
Parker said, "We have the opportunity to set
the pace and lead the way."
She added, "When I say 'multiculturalism,'
'pluralism,' 'interactive,' 'diversity,' the vision I
have may not be the same as the vision others
have."
She said she sees her job as "helping all the
sectors of the Stanford community to articulate
their visions so those visions can be integrated,
so we can have a community where everybody
feels welcome, involved, empowered."
Too hot
Air conditioning was shut down or severely
curtailed in approximately 30 campus buildings
Aug. 6-10.
The shut-down occurred because campus
demand has outpaced the central energy facilty's
ability to produce chilled water for cooling, ac
cording to David Kaye, utilities manager with
Operations and Maintenance.
Operating at full capacity, which it reached in
1989, the facility can meet the ordinary demands
of a northern California summer, but extremely
hot weather impedes its ability to produce chilled

water at a sufficiently rapid rate, he said.
During a shortage, the system is operated to
meet the critical needs of campus, with the med
ical center, mqjor computer systems and campus
research facilities receiving priority.
VA chief of staff dies at 68
Dr. Franklin Ebaugh Jr., chief of staff at the
Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center since
1972, died Tuesday, Aug. 7, at his Stanford home
after a long illness. He was 68.
Ebaugh had been on medical leave since July
10 and had recently stepped down from his po
sition as associate dean for VA affairs and pro
fessor of medicine at Stanford University School
of Medicine.
Ebaugh was well-known throughout the De
partment of Veterans Affairs and had testified
before Congress. He had been pushing for con
gressional funding to replace the medical center
buildings damaged by the earthquake last Oct. 17.
Sports network features Stanford
The UC-Berkeley and Stanford Athletic depart
