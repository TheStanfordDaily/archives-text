# Computer science prof. dies
## Pioneer of artificial intelligence leaves legend behind 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Computer Science Prof. Ar
thur Samuel, whose 60 years of
research ranged in topics from
vacuum-tube electronic comput
ers to artificial intelligence, died
July 29 at Stanford Hospital, at
the age of 88.
While Samuel earned his fame
developing heuristics and ma
chine learning for computers to
play checkers intelligently, he
also deserves credit for encour
aging International Machines
Corporation to pioneer the
development of electronic com
puters, first using vacuum tubes
and later transistors.

Samuel was born in Emporia,
Kan., and received his A.B.
degree from the College of Em
poria in 1923. He earned his
master's degree in electrical en
gineering from MIT in 1926, and
worked on a doctorate in physics
at Columbia University.
Samuel came to Stanford in
1966 as a lecturer, and later be
came a professor of research and
programmer for the Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Labora
tory.
All the while, Samuel contin
ually improved his program that
employed heuristics — the abil
ity of computers to make judge
ments and weigh advantages to
possible actions as opposed to

following inflexible algorithms
— to play checkers. Using now
standard artificial intelligence
techniques long before they
were formalized, the checkers
program can beat most amateur
players and has even beaten one
champion.
Samuel is survived by a broth
er, two daughters and four
grandchildren. The family re
quests that donations be sent to
the Arthur L. Samuel Fellow
ship Fund, a special Stanford
scholarship set up in his honor.
Contributions can be sent to
Carolyn Tajnai, assistant chair
of the Computer Science Depart
ment.
