# Green tells eight to stay home
## Football practice begins Monday for most, Sept. 25 for others 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
After a year of learning
playbooks, repeating drills and
running sprints — all just to
watch games from the bench —
Scott Poholsky was going into
his sophomore football season
ready to play. With only three
weeks to go before two-a-day
practices, and another three
weeks before the season opener,
Poholsky planned on returning
to make an impact on a young
and improving team.
His coach had other plans.
Poholsky is one of eight Stan
ford football players who were
notified in the past two weeks
not to return to Stanford until
September 25 — more than five
weeks after practices begin and
after the completion of three
season games.
In his second year as Stanford
head coach, Denny Green appar
ently decided that the eight
players — and the team —
would be better off if they stayed
home until the beginning of the
academic year. It also made clear
Green's intention to make Stan
ford a big-league football pro
gram.
Green did not return several
phone calls to his office.

Invite system new
Green's invitation-only sys
tem is unprecedented in college
football, according to several
team members and an NCAA
official. While other coaches
may cut players or let them
know they are not in the team's
plans, giving them an option to
stay at the school or transfer,
no other known system notifies
their players as la£e as August
as to whether or not they should
show up for fall practice.
While there is "not a normal
or regular pattern" to personnel
decisions by coaches, Rick F.v
rard, the NCAA's Director of
Legislative Services, said he has
"never personally heard of' a
similar system.
Although the NCAA does not
regulate personnel decisions by
coaches, Evrard expressed con
cern that the players are "not
getting an opportunity to show
what they've got."
Poholsky echoed that
criticism, adding that the coach
made his decisions "totally ig
norant to what I'm doing over
the summer.''
System 'ignores' individuals
Several players criticized
Green's system for giving credit
only to the team goals, ignoring

the needs of the individual.
"His technique of implement
ing this type of philosophy really
hurts the person," Poholsky
said. "This doesn't seem like a
good way to build a football
team and instill confidence in
the players."
The late notification forced
Poholsky to make a "very, very
hurried" decision to transfer,
but he has not yet decided what
school he will choose. His main
options are Illinois and Indiana,
two schools that recruited him
out of high school.
Poholsky said his decision
would probably have been the
same if he had been notified at
a more convenient time, such as
the end of spring practices, but
he said "it would have been
easier" to make a more thor
ough decision.
As a redshirt, Poholsky would
have been eligible to don a Stan
ford Cardinal jersey four more
seasons. Now, since players lose
a year of eligibility when they
transfer from one Division I
school to another, he will only
have three years to play.
Furthermore, Poholsky will
have to re-earn a scholarship he
would have originally received
