# Green tells eight to stay home
## Football practice begins Monday for most, Sept. 25 for others 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
After a year of learning
playbooks, repeating drills and
running sprints — all just to
watch games from the bench —
Scott Poholsky was going into
his sophomore football season
ready to play. With only three
weeks to go before two-a-day
practices, and another three
weeks before the season opener,
Poholsky planned on returning
to make an impact on a young
and improving team.
His coach had other plans.
Poholsky is one of eight Stan
ford football players who were
notified in the past two weeks
not to return to Stanford until
September 25 — more than five
weeks after practices begin and
after the completion of three
season games.
In his second year as Stanford
head coach, Denny Green appar
ently decided that the eight
players — and the team —
would be better off if they stayed
home until the beginning of the
academic year. It also made clear
Green's intention to make Stan
ford a big-league football pro
gram.
Green did not return several
phone calls to his office.

Invite system new
Green's invitation-only sys
tem is unprecedented in college
football, according to several
team members and an NCAA
official. While other coaches
may cut players or let them
know they are not in the team's
plans, giving them an option to
stay at the school or transfer,
no other known system notifies
their players as la£e as August
as to whether or not they should
show up for fall practice.
While there is "not a normal
or regular pattern" to personnel
decisions by coaches, Rick F.v
rard, the NCAA's Director of
Legislative Services, said he has
"never personally heard of' a
similar system.
Although the NCAA does not
regulate personnel decisions by
coaches, Evrard expressed con
cern that the players are "not
getting an opportunity to show
what they've got."
Poholsky echoed that
criticism, adding that the coach
made his decisions "totally ig
norant to what I'm doing over
the summer.''
System 'ignores' individuals
Several players criticized
Green's system for giving credit
only to the team goals, ignoring

the needs of the individual.
"His technique of implement
ing this type of philosophy really
hurts the person," Poholsky
said. "This doesn't seem like a
good way to build a football
team and instill confidence in
the players."
The late notification forced
Poholsky to make a "very, very
hurried" decision to transfer,
but he has not yet decided what
school he will choose. His main
options are Illinois and Indiana,
two schools that recruited him
out of high school.
Poholsky said his decision
would probably have been the
same if he had been notified at
a more convenient time, such as
the end of spring practices, but
he said "it would have been
easier" to make a more thor
ough decision.
As a redshirt, Poholsky would
have been eligible to don a Stan
ford Cardinal jersey four more
seasons. Now, since players lose
a year of eligibility when they
transfer from one Division I
school to another, he will only
have three years to play.
Furthermore, Poholsky will
have to re-earn a scholarship he
would have originally received

from either school if he signed
as a freshman.
Now faced with the prospect
of paying for an entire year of
college expenses, Poholsky's par
ents are not pleased with the
situation. "If parents knew that
this would be a possibility, they
would probably think twice
about sending their kids to the
school," Poholsky's mother,
Dory, scud.
Seniors deal positively
For others told to show up
late, the options are even fewer.
After three years in the pro
gram, getting switched back and
forth between running back and
defensive back, senior Rick
Davis finds himself with only
one way to deal with the situ
ation — by turning it into a
positive.
"I'm in the place where I can't
afford to let this get to me,"
Davis said. "I'm just going to
work my ass off (in the five
week interim). While they're
doing two-a-days, I'll be lifting
weights, running and doing
drills. I want to show the
coaches they're making a big
mistake."
Davis received a letter two
weeks ago telling him to call the
assistant coach in charge of de
fensive backs, at the same time
his roommate received a letter
inviting him to fall practice.
Since Davis' coach could not ex
plain Green's decision, Davis set
up a meeting to learn the
reasoning from Green himself.
Davis said Green explained
that the coaching staff wanted
more effort and improvement
from him, and they also wanted
him to be "a better role model."
"I feel like I'm finally at a
position where I can be produc
tive on the team, instead of flip
flopping from position to
position," Davis said. "In spring,
these guys we're telling me,
'This team needs you, Rick
Davis, to have a productive
team. They preached that we
need everybody and we don't
need anybody. They tell me this,
and I have a productive spring,
and the next thing I know I'm
not called back."
Ryan Shea, another academic
senior, faces the same situation
after three years on the team.
"I'm confused at this point,"
Shea said. "I understand where
they're coming from. I just don't
agree with them."
Green's stricter philosophy
Players noted that the new
invite system is part of Green's
more serious attitude towards
football than his predecessor,
Jack El way.
"He always tells us we have
gotten too soft, complacent and
carefree at Stanford," Davis
said. "This is the drastic mea
sure he's decided to take. What
he's saying is, 'Perform or get
lost."'
Eric Pierce, a senior line
backer who was invited back for
early practice, said Green is
probably "just trying to tighten
screws and let people know they
can't just slide through the pro
gram." Although he could not
estimate what impact the deci
sion would have on the team's
morale, he said "people will
realize [Green) won't take any
crap."
Poholsky was also unsure
what affect the system would
have on the team as a whole,
but said he personally could not
"get along with the coaches
having this type of philosophy"
"He's been saying since he's
been coach that we're going to
have to earn the right to be on
this team," Davis said. "This is
the first time he's enforced
that."

defensive back, senior Rick
Davis finds himself with only
one way to deal with the situ
ation — by turning it into a
positive.
"I'm in the place where I can't
afford to let this get to me,"
Davis said. "I'm just going to
work my ass off (in the five
week interim). While they're
doing two-a-days, I'll be lifting
weights, running and doing
drills. I want to show the
coaches they're making a big
mistake."
Davis received a letter two
weeks ago telling him to call the
assistant coach in charge of de
fensive backs, at the same time
his roommate received a letter
inviting him to fall practice.
Since Davis' coach could not ex
plain Green's decision, Davis set
up a meeting to learn the
reasoning from Green himself.
Davis said Green explained
that the coaching staff wanted
more effort and improvement
from him, and they also wanted
him to be "a better role model."
"I feel like I'm finally at a
position where I can be produc
tive on the team, instead of flip
flopping from position to
position," Davis said. "In spring,
these guys we're telling me,
'This team needs you, Rick
Davis, to have a productive
team. They preached that we
need everybody and we don't
need anybody. They tell me this,
and I have a productive spring,
and the next thing I know I'm
not called back."
Ryan Shea, another academic
senior, faces the same situation
after three years on the team.
"I'm confused at this point,"
Shea said. "I understand where
they're coming from. I just don't
agree with them."
Green's stricter philosophy
Players noted that the new
invite system is part of Green's
more serious attitude towards
football than his predecessor,
Jack El way.
"He always tells us we have
gotten too soft, complacent and
carefree at Stanford," Davis
said. "This is the drastic mea
sure he's decided to take. What
he's saying is, 'Perform or get
lost."'
Eric Pierce, a senior line
backer who was invited back for
early practice, said Green is
probably "just trying to tighten
screws and let people know they
can't just slide through the pro
gram." Although he could not
estimate what impact the deci
sion would have on the team's
morale, he said "people will
realize [Green) won't take any
crap."
Poholsky was also unsure
what affect the system would
have on the team as a whole,
but said he personally could not
"get along with the coaches
having this type of philosophy"
"He's been saying since he's
been coach that we're going to
have to earn the right to be on
this team," Davis said. "This is
the first time he's enforced
that."
After a year of learning
playbooks, repeating drills and
running sprints — all just to
watch games from the bench —
Scott Poholsky was going into
his sophomore football season
ready to play. With only three
weeks to go before two-a-day
practices, and another three
weeks before the season opener,
Poholsky planned on returning
to make an impact on a young
and improving team.
His coach had other plans.
Poholsky is one of eight Stan
ford football players who were
notified in the past two weeks
not to return to Stanford until
September 25 — more than five
weeks after practices begin and
after the completion of three
season games.
In his second year as Stanford
head coach, Denny Green appar
ently decided that the eight
players — and the team —
would be better off if they stayed
home until the beginning of the
academic year. It also made clear
Green's intention to make Stan
ford a big-league football pro
gram.
Green did not return several
phone calls to his office.

Invite system new
Green's invitation-only sys
tem is unprecedented in college
football, according to several
team members and an NCAA
official. While other coaches
may cut players or let them
know they are not in the team's
plans, giving them an option to
stay at the school or transfer,
no other known system notifies
their players as la£e as August
as to whether or not they should
show up for fall practice.
While there is "not a normal
or regular pattern" to personnel
decisions by coaches, Rick F.v
rard, the NCAA's Director of
Legislative Services, said he has
"never personally heard of' a
similar system.
Although the NCAA does not
regulate personnel decisions by
coaches, Evrard expressed con
cern that the players are "not
getting an opportunity to show
what they've got."
Poholsky echoed that
criticism, adding that the coach
made his decisions "totally ig
norant to what I'm doing over
the summer.''
System 'ignores' individuals
Several players criticized
Green's system for giving credit
only to the team goals, ignoring

the needs of the individual.
"His technique of implement
ing this type of philosophy really
hurts the person," Poholsky
said. "This doesn't seem like a
good way to build a football
team and instill confidence in
the players."
The late notification forced
Poholsky to make a "very, very
hurried" decision to transfer,
but he has not yet decided what
school he will choose. His main
options are Illinois and Indiana,
two schools that recruited him
out of high school.
Poholsky said his decision
would probably have been the
same if he had been notified at
a more convenient time, such as
the end of spring practices, but
he said "it would have been
easier" to make a more thor
ough decision.
As a redshirt, Poholsky would
have been eligible to don a Stan
ford Cardinal jersey four more
seasons. Now, since players lose
a year of eligibility when they
transfer from one Division I
school to another, he will only
have three years to play.
Furthermore, Poholsky will
have to re-earn a scholarship he
would have originally received

from either school if he signed
as a freshman.
Now faced with the prospect
of paying for an entire year of
college expenses, Poholsky's par
ents are not pleased with the
situation. "If parents knew that
this would be a possibility, they
would probably think twice
about sending their kids to the
school," Poholsky's mother,
Dory, scud.
Seniors deal positively
For others told to show up
late, the options are even fewer.

gram, getting switched back and
forth between running back and

Davis finds himself with only
