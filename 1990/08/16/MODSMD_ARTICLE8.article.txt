# NCAA appeals drug test ruling
## 
### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
The NCAA took its war on
drugs back to court last Tues
day.
Appearing in the California
Court of Appeals in San Jose,
lawyers for the NCAA argued
# for the reversal of an August
" 1988 California Superior-Court
decision exempting Stanford
athletes from participation in
the NCAA's mandatory drug
testing program.
This appeal is the latest
episode in a legal battle which
began in January 1987 when
former Stanford diver Simone
LeVant filed a lawsuit against
the NCAA. LeVant protested
that the drug testing violated
her right of privacy under the
California constitution.
Stanford athletes Jennifer
Hill and Barry McKeever joined
LeVant's action and were added
as plaintiffs in the suit, in Feb
ruary and July 1987, respective
ly. LeVant dropped out of the
suit in June 1987, when she
graduated. In July of that year
the University joined the ath
letes in the suit.
The suit initiated over a year's
worth of legal deliberations, cul
minating in a lengthy 20-day
trial which scrutinized the drug
testing program.
The program required all ath
letes attending NCAA member
schools to sign a statement
agreeing to participate. Failure
to sign the agreement would dis
qualify athletes from all inter
collegiate competition.
As implemented at the time,
the program randomly tested
athletes competing in post
season competition sucn as
playoffs, national champion
ships and bowl games.
Athletes were tested for a va
riety of substances banned by
the NCAA, including stimulants
like amphetamines and caffeine,
anabolic steroids, street drugs
and sympathomimetic amines,
which are found in many over
the-counter medications.
Athletes who tested positive
could be suspended from post
season play.
Athletes being tested were re
quired to undress and urinate

in front of an NCAA monitor
and answer detailed questions
about their medical history.
Women were specifically asked
if they were using birth control.
These measures, which Hill
and McKeever called humiliat
ing and degrading, prompted the
lawsuit.
In the August 1988 decision,
Judge Conrad Rushing found
that the mandatory testing
policy was an invasion of privacy
under the California constitu
tion and thus all California ath
letes were exempt.
In Tuesday's appeal, C.
Douglas Floyd, the NCAA attor
ney, argued for the ruling to be
overturned, citing the NCAA's
earlier arguments that drug
testing will help ensure the
health and safety of athletes and
maintain fair standards of com
petition.
Floyd also argued that drug
testing would deter drug use
among athletes, who share a
widespread perception that
drugs can enhance athletic per
formance.
Floyd also asked the court to
take into account that the pro
gram has changed since the
original lawsuit, and to consider
it as it now stands. For instance,

women are no longer specifically
asked whether they use birth
control.
San Francisco attorney Susan
Harriman represented Hill and
McKeever. She argued the
NCAA's policy of monitoring
athletes while they provided
urine samples and asking
detailed medical questions was
a "massive intrusion" into the
athletes' privacy.
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt joined Harriman in
disputing Floyd's arguments.
Zumwalt argued that the Uni
versity was not opposed to drug
testing in theory, but rather was
opposed to this particular pro
gram, which unnecessarily in
vaded athletes' rights of privacy.
The justices will issue a ruling
in 60 days. They must deter
mine whether there was suffi
cient evidence to warrant the
lower court decision or if the
decision was made through im
proper proceedings.
Explaining her original reason
for joining the lawsuit, Hill said
she felt the drug-testing pro
gram was a "real invasion of
privacy. I felt violated. They had
no reason to suspect that I used
drugs. You have to stand up to
these kinds of tests."
