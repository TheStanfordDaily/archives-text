# Libraries, computer network join forces
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
As part of the effort to
streamline operations, Uni
versity officials announced
Tuesday the consolidation of
the libraries with Informa
tion Resources, the depart
ment in charge of managing
Stanford's computer network
system.
The move, intended to fa
cilitate the electronic storage
and retrieval of library ma
terials, comes a year after the
announced retirement of
Daivd Weber, who directed
Stanford University Libraries
for the past 21 years.
The new organization will
be led by Civil Engineering
Prof. Robert Street, who is
currently vice president of In
formation Resources.
Although Street has an im
pressive record of administra
tive posts, the prospect of an
engineer managing the libra
ries has some in the human
ities worried.
But Street downplayed
these fears, saying he empat
hized with the needs of hu
manities researchers.
"As an engineer who uses
a laboratory where tools for
doing my research are, and
where I live a lot, I think I
understand what it means to
humanists to have a library
that allows them to do their
research, and that has the
materials and the access they
need for those materials,"
Street said.
"What really matters is
that he knows how to make
an organization work,"
Provost James Rosse said.
Despite the technological
expertise of Information Re
sources, the traditional pet
peeves of library users —
hand-written check-out cards
and an incomplete on-line cat
alog — will not be helped by
the consolidation and are
likely to continue for the next
few years, Street said.

The program to convert to
automated check-out, initi
ated under Weber's leader
ship, is still five years away,
and the completion of Soc
rates will take three years,
he said.
Consolidating the libraries
and Information Resources
will.enhance the role of com
puting and telecommunica
tions in the library, according
to Rosse. Street said he hopes
to improve users' access to
materials within the library
and also increase the cooper
ative sharing of resources
with libraries nationwide.
Street said he saw his job
as "helping to move the li
braries from [the budget cuts
and] repositioning process
into being effective." The li
brary system recently suf
fered a 16 percent cut in its
administrative budget.
"Our libraries have found
it increasingly hard to stay
on the cutting edge of library
technologies," Rosse said.
"Certainly we haven't
gained."
"Part of what we're doing
is betting on where the fu
ture's going," Rosse said.
The creation of the new or
ganization is based on the rec
ommendations of the stream
lining committee charged
with evaluating the library
system. Chaired by Charles
Palm, associate director for
Library and Archives at the
Hoover Institution, the com
mittee looked at ways to im
prove communication be
tween individual library units
and the academic and techni
cal organizations that sup
port them.
Stanford is not alone in its
network/library consolida
tion. Rosse pointed to Colum
bia and Carnegie-Mellon as
other universities with
similar set-ups.
"While we're not on the
cutting edge, we're still ahead
of most universities," Rosse
said.
