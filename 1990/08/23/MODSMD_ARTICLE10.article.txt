# Janitor crew restructured
## USW upset by contracting out of Tresidder custodians 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
With three workers planning
to remain, three deciding to
bump other workers and two
intending to quit completely, the
maintenance crew at Tresidder
Union will undergo mtyor re
structuring when American
Building Maintenance takes
over the custodial work on Sept.
4, after the Labor Day weekend.
In June, Tresidder announced
its decision to contract custodial
work to an outside company.
Then, the entire maintenance
crew was laid off. What resulted
was strong opposition from the
United Stanford Workers, which
represents the custodians, and
uncertainty for the workers.
Now things are finally begin
ning to clear up.
Some stay
Keith Smith, acting manager
of employee relations, said that
as of Friday, three of the seven
custodians eligible to bump, or
replace workers of less seniority,
have indicated they want to ex
ercise this right. He said people
who will be bumped are, in ef
fect, laid-off due to the Univer
sity's budget repositioning, and
are therefore welcome to partic
ipate in programs set up to help
workers cope and locate new
jobs.
Robert Rodriguez, who
decided to bump, said Bobbrie
Brown from employee relations
helped him find a new job as
custodian for University
housing. The other two workers
who are bumping are Eugene
Alvarado and Refugio Flores.
Ray Henson, another cus
todian, said the workers were
assured in a Friday meeting
with an ABM representative
that they can work for the com
pany as long as they want with
out the threat of being fired.
He said he is going to do so,
provided he works more than
just the weekend shift.

are also going to work for ABM,
according to Rodriguez. Most
custodians agree that since the
two are near retirement, they
have nothing to lose by staying
on the job.
According to Rodney Bar
nette, the USW's field represen
tative, 27-year custodian Clyde
Cookson has to leave Stanford
because ABM will not allow him
to keep his current shift, which
starts at 5 in the morning. Cook
son has to spend time with his
wife who is sick, so he can only
work certain hours, Barnette
said.
Linda Crouse, a laborer in
charge of setting up for ban
quets and conferences at Tres
idder, said she is accepting the
layoff and is not going to bump
anyone. "I'm going to volunteer
my time for union work," she
said.
Numerous grievances
Events surrounding the reve
lation of the new contractor
were marked by uncertainty and
sour feelings. Barnette said the
USW filed several grievances
with Employee Relations, most
of them concerning workers' in
ability to make educated deci
sions on whether or not to
bump.
One of Barnette's main com
plaints was that the Universty
did not identify, to the USW's
satisfaction, positions that
workers are eligible to take
when bumping someone.
Smith, however, maintained
that the USW knows the
seniority list as well as Em
ployee Relations. "Before we
identify who will be bumped, we
need to know who is bumping,"
he said.
In the latest Aug. 14 grievance
filed for the custodians, the
USW called the Tresidder
layoffs "termination" of employ
ment, claiming that the action
violated the "just cause" clause
of the USW-Stanford contract.
The clause reads, "No
worker. . .may be disciplined,

terminated, or suspended, ex
cept for just cause."
Barnette said the workers'
separation from their jobs "does
not really fall into the layoff
territory" because in the long
run Tresidder is not going to
save money. He cited severance
pay, conversion costs and the
hidden costs of being locked into
a contract as evidence that Tres
idder is not truly improving its
budget.
Director of Tresidder Bobbi
Braden said Tresidder expects
to save $112,000 a year. She
said savings will come from
reduced staffing, benefit pay
ments, and supplies cost.
Wages and benefits
The custodians reported that
after the meeting with the ABM
representative, not only benefits
but also wages are still uncer
tain.
Barnette said custodians were
told night-shift workers will lose
their 15 percent premium, which
he claimed is an integral part
of their wages.
According the USW-Stanford
contract, the University must
ensure that the contracting com
pany rehire laid-off workers at
"substantially equivalent
wages."
Crouse expressed outrage at
the cutback of "wages" and said
such action is incomprehensible.
"I'm speechless," she said.
However, according to Pris
cilla Wheeler, the Legal Office's
managing attorney for labor, the
hourly wage i3 what is typically
considered as "wages," and spe
cial premiums are looked upon
as fringe benefits.
In the USW-Stanford con
tract, the description of
premium payment falls under
article VI, "Pay," instead of ar
ticle VIII, "University Benefits."
In the labor contract between
Local 1877 of Service Employees
Union and the San Mateo Build
ing Maintance Contractor Asso-
ciation, of which ABM is a mem
ber, there is no reference to
night-shift premium payments
at all.
Custodians who choose to
work for ABM will be repre
sented by Local 1877. Its agree
ments with the contractors' as
sociation stipulates that employ
ees hired after May 1986 be paid
a minimum of $6.05 per hour.
Some Tresidder custodians cur
rently earn up to $10 or $11 per
hour.
Wheeler said the University's
obligation — which was fulfilled
— was to include a clause in
the contract to provide that the
company hire the laid-off
workers at substantially equiv
alent wages. She did acknowl
edge, however, that ABM's
agreement with Local 1877 may
complicate the issue.
Smith said the "equivalent
wages" clause is open to inter

pretation by ABM since it does
not specify "identical" wages.
Joe Smith, a Local 1877 rep
resentative for ABM workers,
said he was told by ABM man
agement that Tresidder cus
todians will be paid the same
wages they are receiving now.
However, he still has to get
clarifications from ABM's San
Mateo branch office manager
before he can talk to the workers
about wages and benefits, he
said.
The branch office manager
could not be reached for com
ment.
Future direction
Barnette said if the USW does
not get satisfactory responses
from the University concerning
the grievances, he will take the
case to the National Labor Re
lations Board, which could entail
a long and costly arbitration
process.
"It's a shame we can't arbi
trate on morality. It is a shame
ful way to treat employees who

worked their whole lives for
you," he added.
Crouse said the USW is
launching a national campaign
Aug. 30 with a noon demonstra
tion at Tresidder intended to
"express anger at the injustice"
of laying oft workers.
She said the event will be at
tended by other local unions
from the Bay Area, and will in
clude a "careful, in-depth expo
sure of the cost of contracting
out." She said the implication
of Tresidder's action is that "the
University can fire everybody
and contract out," thus avoiding
benefit payments.
"What it means is employers
want to have nothing to do with
the welfare of employees," she
said.
On a flier advertising the
event, the USW urges support
ers to attach a sticker, which
reads "This represents the mess
that the administration is cre
ating by its total disregard for
working peoples' lives," to bags
of trash.
