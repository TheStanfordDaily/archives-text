# New phone system called monopolistic
## 
### Jack Sparks Staff writer 
After buying the phone cables
from Pacific Bell over the past
year, Stanford is now the only
supplier of phone services on
campus and is in a position to
dictate rates.
Graduate students Michael
Murray, William Behrman and
Gerald LeTendre lost their case
at a June hearing before the
California Public Utilities Com
mission, thus failing in their at
tempts to force the University
to submit its phone service to
the commission's regulation.
The loss means that students
no longer have a choice in se
lecting a long-distance carrier.
According to evidence intro
duced at the hearing, Stanford
will operate the phone system
for a profit. That means that
the students will pay whatever
Stanford decides is a
"reasonable" profit on long- dis
tance calling, rather than what
is allowed under government
regulation.
For students who previously
subscribed to the Universal Life
Line service offered by Pacific
Bell — a low-income option —
the University will offer a sub
sidized regular phone service,
but the amount of the subsidy
were has not been specified.
Also, a clause was attached to
the service so that only Stanford
students who had the service
before this year will receive
Stanford's new subsidized serv
ice. All new students will pay
the full price.
In addition, any bonus pro
grams that students may have
started with their former long
distance carriers are now in
valid, according to Behrman.
Officials of the Stanford Of
fice of Communications Services

were unavailable for comment,
but did testify for the University
at the June hearing.
The students faced an uphill
battle in the hearing, in part
due to the differences in expe
rience of the legal counsel on
either side. While the students
were represented by third-year
law student Jotham Stein, the
University and Pacific Bell were
jointly represented by Senior
University Counsel Jasper Wil
liams, San Francisco attorney
Terry Houlihan and Pacific Bell
Vice President Ron McClain.
Behrman said that Stein
saved them from disaster, but
that Houlihan was very tough.
"He looked like a top man from
a top law firm," he said.
Behrman, LeTendre and Mur
ray applied for a rehearing,
claiming that the commission
made a wrong decision on
several points of law. Their main
argument is that the University
is providing services to the Stan
ford community similar to those
of the previous phone company,
and thus should be treated as
any other phone company, sub
ject to regulation of the com
mission.
They will be told whether the
rehearing will be granted in
about 30 days.
Behrman said they are also
preparing an action for the
Federal Communications Com
mission, to argue that Stanford
will be a monopoly with the
phone system, which violates
precedent set in two previous
FCC decisions.
As long as the issue is un
resolved, the University can con
tinue to implement the system,
and Murray does not see that
as good for their case. "If we
do not change Ithe system] this
year, it is not going to get
changed," he said.
