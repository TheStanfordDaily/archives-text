Stanford summer students are evenly split over
whether the University's reprimand of acting As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin for
drug use was adequate, according to an informal
survey of students conducted by The Weekly over
the weekend.
The survey registered 39 students as saying
that a letter of reprimand from acting Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson was adequate
form of punishment for Conklin, who was ar
rested June 24 for being under the influence of
cocaine.
While students were evenly split on this issue,
there was a general consensus in favor of the
statement that the private behavior of adminis
trators and faculty members was relevant to the
educational purposes of Stanford. Seventy percent
of the respondents agreed.
The Weekly contacted 100 summer students
over the telephone for the survey.
Because of the unusually high percentage of
graduate students who remain at Stanford during
the summer, almost all respondents (98 out of a
sample of 100) were graduate students.
In a response to a question about the recent
NCAA appeal of the rule excusing Stanford ath
letes from drug testing, a majority of students
agreed with the NCAA that athletes should sub
mit to drug testing. Sixty percent of the respon
dents agreed with this position, while 30 percent
disagreed.
A clearer mtyority of 79 percent believe drug
testing would deter the use of drugs by athletes,
vs. 13 percent that disagreed.
A final topic of the informal survey was the
University budget cuts. While only 39 percent
said they had followed the budget cuts closely,
most of those said that the quality of education
and residential life would not be severely effected
by the cuts.
