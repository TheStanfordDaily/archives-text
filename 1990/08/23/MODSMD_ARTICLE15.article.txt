## Editorial Editor's farewell 
### 
LONG in some ways, too
short in others, with its
good points and bad
points, this summer has been
an interesting chapter in my
life.
From the beginning, I have
been surprised by how well
The Weekly's relatively inex
perienced staff has worked to
gether to produce a high
quality product each week.
This summer we set out to
produce a newspaper that
covered news events fairly, of
fered insightful commentary,
made entertainment options
accessible and kept track of
the University's fine athletes
as they competed over the
summer.
Many challenging news
stories developed over the
course of the summer and
stirred debate and discussion
amongst those of us who were
still around to read about
them.
Many of those issues will
carry over to the fall when
arriving students will have an
opportunity to catch up on
what has happened over the
summer.
Before leaving the editorial
offices where I have probably
spent half of my time at Stan
ford and heading out into the
world, I would like to thank
everyone here. In my four
years at The Daily, I have
met and worked with some
fine and talented individuals.
As for this summer, I would
like to thank the staff of The
Weekly for making my job as
editor very easy.
For several individuals on
staff, this was their first shot
at editing and each week I
have been impressed with the
quality of their work.
It has been a learning sum
mer. Last year, when I was
taking French to fulfill a re
quirement for my and
not studying for the class at
all, my teacher took me aside.

She asked me why I was
taking her class, at which
point I became embarassed,
but I told her that it was to
fulfill a requirement. She
looked at me and shook her
head. She said I wasn't really
trying and I nodded. Then,
she said "you should always
do your best at whatever you
do."
It makes a lot of sense. As
Pink Floyd says, "all you
touch and all you see is all
your life will ever be."
I would rephrase it and say
"all you think and all you do
is all your life will ever be,"
but that doesn't rhyme. Any
way, always do your best. No
excuses.
At the beginning of the
summer, when I read Arthur
Miller's "Death of a Sales
man," I thought Charley was
right when he said "The only
thing you got in this world
is what you can sell." Now,
I don't believe that's true.
But, at the beginning of the
summer, we were not on the
brink of war in the Middle
East.
The Smiths' song "There
is a Light that Never Goes
Out" has been playing in my
head for weeks.
Hopefully, things will get
better. Thanks for reading.
Take care.
