SCLC proposal changes actions, not sentiments

Growing up as a gay person in
what Harvey Milk used to call a
"fiercely heterosexual communi
ty," I've learned what it means
to be an outsider.
When I was in high school my
pain was summoned almost
hourly by my companions. Visit
any high school in America and
you will find it in any of the con
versations: faggot, queer, sicko.
Perhaps, then, I should wel
come the Student Conduct Leg
islative Council document defin
ing the use of such language as a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard. But somehow I can't
think of a single example of
where it would help.
Several young men at Stan
ford have called me a "faggot" to
my face. With the SCLC rule, I
could have them suspended. Will
that make them respect gay peo
ple more? I think not. Perhaps it
would silence them. Again, I
think not. It might make them
less bold, but not less belliger
ent.
Of course, there is always the

chance that we could catch them
in the act. Once, for example, I
knew exactly which freshman
had written "Die Fags" in big
red letters on the questionnaire
he filled out in preparation for a
speaking engagement on gay
and lesbian issues. He laughed
about it as he filled it out in
front of his roommate, not real
izing that his roommate was gay.
We could have used the SCLC
rule to have him suspended.
Then perhaps freshmen would
think twice about expressing
such thoughts. Of course, it
wouldn't bring them any closer
to understanding gay people,
and it would only increase their
feelings of hostility.
And then there is the sticky
problem of exactly what kind of
speech is covered. A year ago I
found myself having trouble ex
plaining to a student why we
had taken off points for his solu
tion to a midterm problem. Fi
nally, he saw it all at once. "Oh,"
he groaned, "that's so gay!"
I'm sure he meant it the way

people used to mean, "That's so
retarded," in the days when prej
udice against the retarded was
more acceptable. Were these
fighting words that were meant
to stigmatize? Was it directed at
me, or was he talking to himself?
The biggest problem with the
SCLC rule, however, is not the
question of how it will be ap
plied, but the reality of how little
it addresses. The real problem is
the sentiment behind offensive
language, not the expression of
such sentiment.
As Thomas Jefferson advised
those who recommended a simi
lar limitation on expression of
non-Christian ideas, "Con
straint may make a (non-Chris
tian) worse by making him a
hypocrite, but it will never make
him a truer man."
I guess I just don't believe po
litical activists can do much to
address what I see as the funda
mental threats to harmony:
prejudice and misunderstand
ing. Prejudice is one of the most
intractable facets of the human

soul. You can cage it in, but that
only makes it more angry and
more dangerous, more likely to
explode unexpectedly with even
greater ferocity.
For me it boils down to
whether I want to settle for a
well-regulated society of hyp
ocrites where correct behavior is
constantly debated in University
committees, or whether I'd
rather have a community of im
perfect people who sometimes
hurt each other but who also
sometimes help each other,
through open and loving shar
ing, to become better people.
My belief is that building true
harmony can never be accom
plished through politics. Again
quoting Jefferson, "Reason and
free inquiry are the only effectu
al agents against error ... It is
error alone which needs the sup
port of government. Truth can
stand by itself."
