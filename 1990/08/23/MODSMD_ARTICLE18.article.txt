## Helms' censorship stifles art 
### 
This week, I've decided to dis
cuss a matter of vital impor
tance: censorship.
You see, in addition to my
more mundane occupations (like
part-time columnist), I am also
something of an artiste, a social
critic with a trenchant vision.
For my latest project I was going
to wrap my private parts in a
soiled American flag and throw
burning copies of Adam Smith's
economic writings from the top
of Hoover Tower as the carillon
played "Heart and Soul."
It was to be a shocking indict
ment of the callousness and
greed of the free market system
and its effect upon the arts. Of
course, no one has yet been will
ing to donate the necessary six
hundred sixty-six copies of "The
Wealth of Nations" to me for
this monumental event. And
this can mean but one thing:
censorship in its basest form.
The mood of intimidation
that has been created by Senator
Jesse Helms' latest attacks on
the National Endowment for the

Arts has stifled the artistic life of
this nation.
These days, no one is willing
to be associated with any idea
(even the brilliant ones) that
might suddenly find itself writ
ten up in about thirty zillion
newspapers across America as
"obscene" or "un-American" â€”
including the ones in small,
highly patriotic towns with re
laxed gun-control standards.
Helms has wrapped himself
in "American values" in the
course of his attacks on the art
that he labels obscene. He outra
geously claims that the Ameri
can population has no obligation
to support the works of art that
it is offended by.
But he fails to realize that
only by shaking the American
public from its intellectual, Nor
man Rockwellesque slumber can
we hope to make this world a
better place. And if being subsi
dized by the NEA like so many
tobacco farmers is part of what
it takes (and looking at Helms'

constituency, that certainly
seems acceptably all-American),
then so be it.
But perhaps there's a darker
and more sordid explanation to
this whole artistic expression
controversy, a side of which we
have only begun to be aware.
Helms seems well on his way to
creating an artistic vacuum in
this nation, as well as a surplus
of NEA grants.
And rumor has it that a new
epic nationalist opera has re
cently been commissioned, a
mammoth production that
would include a chorus of sixty
three Shriners and several spe
cially-trained tenor stunt-ar
madillos. And who is penned in
for the lead male? I won't come
out with names, but it rhymes
with Messy Helms.
You draw your own conclu
sions.
