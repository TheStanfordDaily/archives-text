## Diana Conklin Case Stanford has double standard 
### 
It's a clear double standard.
University officials, through the han
dling of Diana Conklin's arrest for co
caine use, have provided another example
to show that several standards exist in
this country's "war on drugs."
In her public statement, the acting as
sociate dean of Student Affairs said she
"came across" a nine-year-old vial of co
caine on June 24 while packing to go out
of state. She said her husband found it
several days before in a closet as part of a
process of moving out.
After 12 years of marriage, the couple
is getting a divorce.
"Impulsively I decided to use what was
in the vial," Conklin said in her state
ment.
University officials, obviously sympa
thetic to Conklin's emotional trials, re
acted to the arrest by saying things like:
"What people do in their private lives is
their own business" (Acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson); "There
may be some fault on (Conklin's) part,
but we're all human" (Acting Director of
the Row Jack Chin); and"The right ques
tion to ask is whether what turns out to
be the case here would impair her effec
tiveness in her job" (University President
Donald Kennedy).
While all three positions may be valid,
they are very different from the attitude
University officials took toward student
drug use just three years ago.
Conklin, as director of the Row, made
members of the Alpha Delta Phi Frater
nity sign an agreement not to use drugs
in order to keep their house. No one men
tioned classroom performance as a litmus
test; University officials just decided it

must Btop. "What people do in their pri
vate lives is their own business" appar
ently applies only to Stanford administra
tors.
Furthermore, the University doesn't
even appear to have scrutinized how the
situation "would impair her effectiveness
in her job." The answer remains to be
seen, but the incident could easily affect
Conklin'B credibility as a student affairs
official involved in curbing student drug
use.
Conklin says she can use her experi
ence to help students. On the other hand,
as noted persuasively in a letter to Cam
pus Report, similar logic would make it
excusable for Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington to commit a few armed rob
beries to understand the criminal mind.
Instead of using this incident as an op
portunity to examine and unify the Uni
versity's own drug use policy, officials
have set a precedent by simply repri
manding Conklin and trying to sweep
this issue hastily under the carpet before
school begins.
If the University and our society really
sympathizes with drug users, as exempli
fied by many of the reactions to Conklin's
situation, let's call back the troops from
the "war" on drugs. But if we're really se
rious about stopping drug use and the
problems associated with it, we must
view all drug use equally as a problem —
and not discount some as simple "mis
takes."
