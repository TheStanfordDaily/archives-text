# Conklin deserves sympathy
## 
### 
Diana Conklin's character is taking
a beating in the Campus Report and
Daily opinion pages.
For example, take a look at Doug
Davis' editorial cartoon in last week's
issue. Davis' hard-hitting and insight
ful cartoon raises legitimate questions
about the University's stand on drug
use, particularly drug use by an admin
istrator.
Have University administrators
taken the appropriate action in Con
klin's case, or have they closed ranks
and just slapped Conklin on the wrist
in order to sweep this embarassing is
sue under the carpet as quickly as pos
sible?
I lean toward the latter. The debate
over whether standards for those in
positions of leadership should be high
er than for those who follow has not
been exhausted. Actually, I am not
sure the debate ever occurred.
But that is another issue raised bet
ter by other writers. I am troubled by
the beating Conklin has been taking in
the opinion pages.
Although Davis' cartoon raises
questions sidestepped by administra
tors, the cartoon inadvertently hits
hard at Conklin's character at a time
when she deserves some compassion.
As she has admitted, she has a prob
lem. How serious a problem is open to
debate. If you believe Conklin's state
ment, the problem is minor, as she
made a mistake while under severe
personal distress.
If this is the case, we should be un

derstanding. We all make mistakes and
should not rush forward to cast the
first stones.
If you do not believe Conklin's state
ment — and I am not sure I do; all the
pieces fit too nicely — then Conklin
may actually be addicted to cocaine. In
which case, she still deserves our com
passion.
If Conklin's problem is really se
vere, then it can be somewhat likened
to that of an alcoholic. You do not
stone an alcoholic, you treat the indi
vidual — with compassion, medicine
and any other tools human beings have
at their disposal. Drug addicts are peo
ple too and deserve a fair chance.
I am by no means arguing that Con
klin should not have been disciplined.
Perhaps she should have faced sterner
and more creative measures than
those used. Difficult problems often
require hard, creative solutions.
Instead, I am asking us only to re
member that Conklin has a problem
she may be unable to solve herself. So
as we write our letters, draw our car
toons and nod our heads in agreement
with the issues raised in our editorial
pieces, let us not shut off our compas
sion for a fellow human being. To turn
off our compassion for Diana Conklin
would mean that we have also turned
our backs on countless others who
have faced drug problems.
