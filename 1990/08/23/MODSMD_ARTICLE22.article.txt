## Strange movies assault summer silver screen 'Frankenhooker' rivals 'Rocky Horror' classic 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
Before I begin, let me set the
record straight — I honestly be
lieve the "Rocky Horror Picture
Show" is a classic.
Not like "Casablanca," of
course, but in a different sense.
As far as cult movies go, "Rocky
Horror" will never be touched. It
is in a class by itself.
But it came close to losing
that status when "Franken
hooker" came out.
Written by Robert Martin and
Frank Henenlotter, "Franken
hooker" is almost as strange as
"Rocky Horror." The movie be
gins with a shot of a brain with
one eye floating in a glass of
formaldehyde. Jeffrey Franken
(James Lorinz) is talking to it.
Weird.
Eventually, his fiancee, Eliza
beth (Patty Mullen), coaxes him
outside to join the birthday par
ty for her father. So Jeffrey gets
to see the love of his life de
voured by a lawn mower. Yes, a
lawn mower.
Well, Jeffrey, a "bioelectric
technician" by his own defini
tion, spends a lot of time plan
ning how he can reconstruct
Elizabeth into the woman she
once was. With a couple of
changes. You see, he saved some
of her body parts.
To make a long story short,
Jeffrey rebuilds Elizabeth.
Where does he get the needed
parts? Where else are women
willing to sell their bodies for
cash?
New York City
I know, so far "Frankenhook
er" doesn't sound nearly as
bizarre as it does disgusting. But
as a person who can't even look
at her own paper cuts, trust me
— this is not a gross slasher
film.
In fact, the special effects are
so bad — nonexistent really —
that they are a riot. A good —
but understated — analogy
would be if you could see the
strings holding Superman in the
air. They add to the campy hilar
ity of the movie. Really.
As for the acting,... what act
ing? I don't know if it could be
classified as such. However, ev
eryone seemed to know exactly
what kind of film he/she was in,

and didn't take anything too se
riously.
In other words, it was a per
fect low budget movie that
didn't pretend to be anything
but that. It wasn't supposed to
be realistic.
Did you think Brad and Janet
were real?
I admit that while actually
watching "Frankenhooker" (at
midnight, coincidence of coinci
dences) I was more amazed at
how twisted it was, rather than
taken by its humor. But thinking
back, I realize how hysterical the
whole plot was.
In a sick sort of way.
