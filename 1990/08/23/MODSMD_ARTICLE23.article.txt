# New 'Exorcist' combines humor and horror successfully
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Despite a general tendency of movie se
quels to try to imitate the flavor of their pre
decessors — and usually, to fail — "The Ex
orcist III" is a remarkable success that en
tertains viewers with its surprising humor
as well as its frightening drama.
Although the original "Exorcist" has be
come the definitive horror film since its re
lease 17 years ago, its second sequel at
tempts to make a more sophisticated mys
tery, and in the process establishes itself as a
highly entertaining film that is not easily
forgotten.
This third movie in the series was written
and directed by William Peter Blatty, the cre
ator of the original film. But in"The Exor
cist III," Blatty does not follow the style of
the first film, creating instead a murder
mystery.
Rather than relying on the head-twisting,
demonic horror of the original movie, "The
Exorcist III" combines a delicate balance of
humor, mystery and suspense to keep the
audience enthralled at every moment.

The only real reminder of the first film is
the new ending, which features an exorcism
that fails to live up to the power and drama
of the original.
At the center of the sequel is police Lieu
tenant William Kinderman, portrayed by
George C. Scott, who was best friends with
the original movie's Rev. Damien Karras.
Karras was responsible for performing the
successful exorcism that ended up taking his
own life.
Karras (played by Jason Miller) is rein
carnated by the devil in"The Exorcist III"
and is forced to share the same body as a
possessed and deranged mental patient on
the isolation ward of Georgetown Hospital.
Using a plot that more closely resembles a
cop thriller than a horror classic, the movie
shows Kinderman trying to solve the grue
some murders of two priests and a young
boy. Kinderman soon realizes that these
murders are no ordinary crimes when he
sees his long-dead friend alive in the isola
tion ward.
The film is enhanced by a solid perfor
mance from Scott, who adds a touch of class
to the project by his mere presence, and the

brilliant acting of Brad Dourif, who plays the
psychopathic mental patient. Dourif blends
the drama of his murderous tendencies with
a sadistic, maniacal humor that becomes one
of the most disturbing, and funniest, parts
of the film.
The film does an excellent job of playing
on the emotions of the audience, often con
trasting quite humorous scenes, such as
that of a little old possessed lady scampering
upside-down across the ceiling, with dis
turbing scenes of death.
Only occasionally does it go too far by in
ducing the screams and cheap thrills of hav
ing characters suddenly pop into the screen
at tense moments.
And, for added effect, "The Exorcist III"
also has feature appearances by a pro bas
ketball player and a former top government
official for those viewers with a watchful
eye.
The film leaves the viewer with two dis
tinct memories: the unforgettable and
haunting sight of a ghostly shade sneaking
up behind a nurse in the hospital corridor
and the phrase uttered by Rev. Karras,
"Save thy servant. Kill it."
