# Lynch's 'Wild' odd, intriguing
## 
### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
Director David Lynch's new
movie, "Wild at Heart," is defi
nitely — definitely — not for the
weak at heart.
Lynch's new baby is a dis
turbing roller coaster ride that
has you laughing one frame and
wanting to toss your cookies the
next. And like a roller coaster,
once you've sat down to watch
this, you're stuck until the end,
I for "Wild at Heart" seduces you
into staying, smothering any
momentary urges to flee.
"Wild at Heart" is true to
Lynch's established form — as
anyone who has seen his earlier
work in "Eraserhead," "Blue
Velvet" or his amazingly popular
TV series, "Twin Peaks" can at
test.
In fact, "Wild at Heart," with
its interwoven stories, numer
ous flashbacks, vivid colors and
heavy symbols, is what "Twin
Peaks" would be without the Pu
ritan constraints of television
censors.
In other words, this movie is
heavy on the sex and violence
which the series only suggested.
This movie has so much sex and
violence, and just about every
other theme absent from Disney
films, that it originally received
an X rating from the Motion Pic
ture Association of America.
The original rating is under
standable, given the fact that
Lynch handles such heavy topics
as child molestation, rape and
abortion, in quick but brutally
realistic scenes which leave you
cringing and gasping for breath.
In fact, people should be pre
pared. If you're prone to night
mares or highly sensitive to peo
ple burning, child molestation,
automobile wrecks, rape or abor
tion — don't see this movie.
And yet, this movie is a love
story and a fairy tale combined.
Sort of.
The romance of Sailor Riley
(Nicholas Cage) and Lula Pace
Fortune (Laura Dern), takes
place against the backdrop of a
modern, twisted version of the
"Wizard of Oz."
Alone in a world that is "wild
at heart and weird on top," the
two young Southern lovers trav
el down the yellow brick road to
the Emerald City, located —
where else — in Southern Cali
fornia. Along the way they take
a detour in Texas and hit tough
times that test their love and
loyalty.
The romantic plot may seem
like an old one, but this no ordi
nary love story — and these are
no ordinary lovers.
Cage delivers a memorable
performance here as a wild,
sometimes violent, but never
theless noble romeo who loves
snakeskin jackets and Elvis
Presley songs.
Surpassing Cage's perfor
mance, Dern fills the screen as
the fiercely loyal Lula who is
haunted by a childhood of abuse
and a psychotic mother.
Together these two mesmer
ize the audience with their blis
tering sensuality, their mutual
compassion and their amazing
ability to overcome the
formidable problems facine
them.
How the two eventually fare
is easily worth the price of one or
two tickets — it may take you a
couple of trips to thp theater to
figure out Lynch*B story.
