# 'My Blue Heaven' is hellish

### Sunil Perkash Staff writer 
Stylistic direction, impeccable
acting and witty dialogue accu
rately describe what is not pre
sent in the new Steve
Martin/Rick Moranis film, "My
Blue Heaven."
In fact, this could well be the
single worst movie I have seen
this summer.
The plot involves FBI man
Moranis, who is assigned to look
after gangster Martin until he
testifies against other criminals
in return for government protec
tion. As Martin sets up his new
life in a small suburban town, he
jeopardizes his federal security
by doing everything from steal
ing a car to hijacking a truck.
Battling Martin is the sexy as
sistant district attorney (Joan
Cusack) who is determined to
book him for at least one of his
newly commited crimes. Mora
nis continuously prevents her
from doing so, in order to keep
Mafia members from discover
ing Martin's whereabouts.
To add a little more complexi

ty to this ludicrous story, all
three characters — Cusack,
Martin, and Moranis — have re
cently been separated from each
of their respective spouses,
paving the way for new and not
so-exciting romances.
Most of the movie is struc
tured as a series of short, loosely
related vignettes, all of which
are tediously too bizarre.
For example, one of Martin's
plans to embezzle money from
the innocent townspeople by col
lecting funds for a new Little
League field is thwarted by Cu
sack. While in jail, he calls his
Mafia friends and has them
build a baseball diamond in or
der to clear his name.
This irrelevant sequence of
events probably lasts 20 minutes
—though it seemed more like
two hours — and is far too ran
dom to be funny.
Each of these sequences has
its own title, which flashes
across the screen. These are by
far the funniest, albeit still dull,
part of "My Blue Heaven."
Somewhere in Hollywood
there must have been a good

idea behind this dreadful film.
After all, it does have stars in it
and it was produced by Goldie
Hawn, showing there was plenty
of talent behind the project. But,
along the way, everything fell
apart.
Perhaps the producers got too
involved with making extra
money by plugging every prod
uct ever made.
Just one example is the un
necessary scene in which an
American Airlines plane takes
off and lands — for far longer
than need be. Following that
there is the scene with the won
derfully polite stewardesses, all
displaying American Airlines
emblems, as they serve drinks to
Martin and Moranis.
I cannot help but think many
people might see this film for the
sole reason that it reunites
Moranis and Martin, who were
both hilarious in last summer's
hit "Parenthood." But do not be
fooled, "My Blue Heaven" is an
unfunny waste of an hour and a
half.
Staying home and doing laun
dry would be more entertaining
