# 'Truth' is unbelievably boring

It has become quite trendy to see movies made
by independent producers with small budgets.
You know which ones I mean. The avant-garde
films. The movies that denounce some aspect of
today's society, and do it with bizarre camera
tricks, such as sudden changes in camera angles,
black screens, etc.
I find these movies to be pretentious. They
preach of the evils of the world; they claim to
make a profound statement, but upon closer in
spection, they say nothing of substance.
Frequently, I find the people who "love" these
films to be pretentious and without substance as
well.
"The Unbelievable Truth," written and direct
ed by Hal Hartley, is the latest of the "high and
mighty."
Centered around a young girl (Adrienne
Shelly), the movie tells the story of her attraction
to an older man (Robert Burke) who supposedly
killed both the sister and father of her best friend.
This is, of course, the "unbelievable truth."
And that's part of the problem — you don't re
ally believe it.
The final scene of the movie is supposed to re
veal this "shocker", and thus neatly resolve all the

troubles that stemmed from the assumption that
this man was a killer.
But about ten minutes into the film you know
that he's not. And about ten minutes later you fig
ure out what really did happen.
So much for the shocker.
But that's not even why I didn't enjoy this
movie. That results mostly from the fact that
there is no plot. Sure, there's the relationship I al
ready described, but there's nothing to follow. The
film presents a lot of happenings, but never con
nects them smoothly. The movie doesn't flow.
It's kind of like watching a bunch of slides one
after another, with choppy breaks in between.
And furthermore, "The Unbelievable Truth" is
depressing. Not good cathartic, cry-your-eyes-out
depressing, but cold, dismal, morose depressing.
The only message I got from this film was that
we all lead miserable existences which are hope
less and uncontrollable, but it doesn't matter be
cause we're all going to die soon anyway. What
more could I get from a movie whose main female
character spends half her time talking about nu
clear war and its after-effects, and whose lead
male character was sent to jail for no reason?
"The Unbelievable Truth" is truly an "alterna
tive" film which will spur deep "meaningful" cov
ersations between philosophy majors wearing
black in Greenwich Village.
