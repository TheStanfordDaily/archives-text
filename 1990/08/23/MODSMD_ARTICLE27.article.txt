# Stanford Theater is trip to past

The experience of going to
The Stanford Theater in down
town Palo Alto, which is dedicat
ed to showing Hollywood films
primarily from the 1920s to the
19505, encompasses much more
than just seeing a good movie.
Upon entering the theater,
one is surrounded with music by
George Gershwin, Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin — among oth
er movie palace standards —
which eminates from pipes be
hind two gilded organ grilles.
The organist onstage plays
the 1926 console, which origi
nally came from Graumann's
(now Mann's) Chinese Theater
in Hollywood, home of the foot
prints of the stars. When the
lights dim and the curtain rises,
the organist and organ slowly
descend into the organ pit.
"We try to set an atmosphere,
because that is what the movie
palaces in the 1920s tried to do,"
said Jim Riggs, one of the the
ater's four organists. The music
"adds showmanship," he ex
plained.
The organ music, combined
with the theater's restored inte
rior, captivates and convinces
the audience that they have es

caped to the early 1900s, the
golden era of film.
Jay Smith, a Palo Alto resi
dent and Stanford alumnus, said
the theater did a "marvelous
job" with the recent restoration
work, completed in December
1989. "It is now as I knew it
when The Stanford and the Var
sity were the only two theaters,"
he said.
Owner David Packard spent
16 months and $6 million restor
ing the theater to its original
state. Using a 1925 photograph
of the auditorium as a guide, re
storers were able to make an ex
act match, said Manager Libby
Roberts.
Recreated Assyrian and
Greek ornamentation decorates
the ceiling and walls of the
1,170-seat auditorium. Painted
tapestry frames the stage which
is draped with a red velour Aus
tralian curtain.
The grand balcony, the ceiling
which rises over 50 feet and six
chandeliers made from ancient
models all contribute to the
grandeur of this old movie
palace.
"These movies were made to
be seen in a big theater with a
big audience," Roberts said. The
black-and-white American clas
sics are pulling in crowds, mak

ing viewing old movies on the big
screen much more fun than
watching them at home on
video.
"Gigi" sold out during its
four-day run, Roberts said. On
many nights, 800 to 900 patrons
attend.
Although senior citizens are a
"built-in audience," according to
Roberts, viewing an American
film classic provides a welcome
change for any movie-goer. As 9-
year-old Laura Morris from Los
Altos Hills put it,"It is a special
occasion to be here. It's better
than a regular movie theater —
it's a treat!"
For instance, in the comedy
"To Be or Not To Be" (1942), a
group of actors in the Polish un
derground attempt to save War
saw from Hitler. The innocent
thrill of laughing along with
hundreds of others at Jack Ben
ny's ridiculous facial expressions
cannot be experienced in today's
multiplex theaters. Nor can con
temporary comedies capture the
light, screwball humor found in
"My Man Godfrey" (1936), one
of Hollywood's greatest hits.
Aside from simple wit, the
movies provide a sense of histo
ry. The storyline of Errol Fly
