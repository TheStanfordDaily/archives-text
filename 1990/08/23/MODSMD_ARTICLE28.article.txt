# Belushi, Grodin make good 'Business' team
## 
### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
Movie previews, whether on
television or in the theaters, are
often deceiving.
By showing the best thitfy
seconds of a movie, previews
have the ability to make the
most heinous film seem like
something you'd want to see.
Usually they can con you into
paying to see a film before you
find out how bad it is; sometimes
— though rarely — they can
make a decent movie look unde
sirable.
The movie "Taking Care of
Business" looked pretty bad in
the previews.
Its "Trading Places" storyline
seemed as if it would kill the act
ing talents of its two stars,
Charles Grodin and James
Belushi. I must confess that I
entered the theater with a most
dubious attitude.
Despite my predilection
against it, I was pleasantly sur
prised by this movie. It was gen
uinely funny at times, and al
ways amusing.
Its plot is a close takeoff of the
Eddie Murphy/Dan Akroyd
movie. In this case, however, es
caped convict Jimmy Dworski
(Jim Belushi) lives the life of a
rich man when he finds the date
book of powerful advertising ex
ecutive Spenser Barnes (Charles
Grodin).
Although the coincidences in
volved require an extreme sus
pension of disbelief on the part
of the viewer, they are pretty

darn funny.
Grodin performs his role of
the sacrificial yuppie with great
skill. Using many of the expres
sions we saw in his "Midnight
Run" performance, he is sub
limely hilarious. His many
mishaps keep the film moving
smoothly, as does his perfectly
fitting attitude of aggravation
about the whole incident.
Belushi ("Red Heat," "K9")
does an adequate job in his role.
Although he seems to play the
same down-to-earth, have-a-lit
tle-fun kind of guy in all his
films, Belushi fits the part well,
adding the other side of the situ
ational fence.
This is not a movie in which
anything is really credible. Espe
cially outstanding as incredible
is the Brady Bunch-like prison
from which Dworski escapes.
Everybody there seems to get
along really well and is willing to
sacrifice to allow Dworski to use
his World Series tickets, which is
the reason he escapes in the first
place.
Even though it is supposed to
be a minimum security prison,
this kind of brotherly love in
such an environment stretches
the boundaries of anyone's
imagination.
Still, it's not supposed to be a
believable movie, just an enter
taining one. Overall, it fulfills
that description. While not a
non-stop belly-buster, "Taking
Care of Business" has moments
that evoke guffaws from the au
dience, and it keeps a wide smile
on your face the whole time.
