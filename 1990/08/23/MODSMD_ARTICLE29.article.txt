# 'Ritual' is addicting
## 
### William Thomas Staff writer 
Jane's Addiction, the band
that produced the relentless
sound of "Nothing's Shocking,"
released "Ritual de lo Habitual"
this week. Jane's Addiction has
always appealed to a hard-edged
crowd, yet a certain subtlety of
their music has forced listeners
to coin the term "artsy rock" to
describe their music.
"Ritual de lo Habitual" is
both artsy and rock in a post
punk, alternative sort of way.
The convoluted sound of energy
rich songs such as "Stop" or
"Obvious" simply demand your
attention at times, yet the as
sertive lyrics of "No One's Leav
ing" have a compelling, festive
quality.
Singer and conceptualist Per
ry Farrell allows his voice to
range from haunting to whimsi

cal as it weaves in and out of the
instrumental lines. Eric A's sim
ple bass lines and Stephen
Perkins's precise drum work an
chor the sometimes crunching,
sometimes titillating guitar
work of Dave Navarro.
The band still has an ability
to generate a wall of sound that
approaches from a great dis
tance and pounces on the listen
er. Alongside this, however,
there is now a coterie of songs
that have replaced the pounce
with something less demanding
and more curious.
"Ritual. . contains some
lower-energy material of a genre
I would call post-funk folk. Both
electric and conventional violin
vie with piano to swim in the
generous sound that this band
normally produces. It is still a
sound that induces a healthy
shudder along with foot-tapping,
and even slam dancing, ap
proval.
