# Henry's lives up to promises
## 
### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
Located at 482 University Avenue, a few
doors away from the Varsity Theater, Henry's
offers just what the sign above the door promis
es â€” "Lunch, Dinner and Whiskey."
Have no doubt, this is a conversation bar, not
a meat-market. Don't expect blaring music and
dim lighting that makes people look better than
they actually are.
Instead, you'll find ample lighting and easy
going music which let you see and hear who
you're talking to.
The lunch menu offers a selection of salads,
sandwiches, burgers, fresh pastas and a few
daily specials. Portions are ample, but prices

are moderate, ranging from about $6 to $7.50 a
plate
Dinner is even better, offering a nice selec
tion of appetizers, salads, fresh pasta, steak,
seafood and a larger selection of daily specials.
Dinner prices are typical of Palo Alto's better
restaurants, ranging from $12 to $17 a plate.
Again, portions are ample.
And if you're wondering why the food tastes
so good, it's because John, as head chef, puts a
lot of care into the menu. As the former execu
tive chef at The Stanford Park Hotel and the
Pebble Beach Golf and Tennis Club, he's had a
lot of experience cooking for selective appetites.
So if your tired of the normal Stanford hang
outs, venture into Henry's, where things are
just as the sign says.
