# Cruise with classics
## 
### 
You've been on the road for
hours, sitting behind the wheel
getting those droopy "I've seen
too much highway for one day"
eyes. You need some good music
— driving music — classics to
sing along with.
Shell knows how you feel.
In association with CBS
Records, the petroleum power
house has developed a series of
"Cruisin' Classics'* available for
just $1.99 with an eight-gallon
fill-up .
The three latest cassettes are
each tailored to a different cruis
ing era, distinguished by the
classic car covers. Volume IV
(Ford Mustang) features The

Byrds' "Mr. Tambourine Man,"
Aretha Franklin's "Chain of
Fools," and "Monday, Monday"
by The Mamas & The Papas.
Volume V (Corvette) has the
most diversified selection, in
cluding The Doobie Brothers'
"Listen to the Music," The Spin
ners' "Could It Be I'm Falling in
Love" and Wham's "Wake Me
Un Before You Go-Go."
volume VI (Chevy Bel Air)
shines above the others, though,
with true classics such as The
Marcels' "Blue Moon," Dion's
"Runaround Sue," The Coast
ers' "Yakety Yak," and the
Killer's "Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin' On." — T. Marklein
