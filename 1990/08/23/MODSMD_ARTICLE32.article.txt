# 'Gregory' lightly looks at dark side

### Greg Douglas Editorial staff 
"Gregory" is the tale of a small,
mentally disturbed child who is strait
jacketed and locked inside a padded
cell. His only contact with the outside
world comes through what he over
hears from his single window.
Author and artist Marc Hempel
does an amazing job on "Gregory."
There are several individual stories in
the work, connected by our mostly
mute little buddy. Each story has a dif
ferent point, or no point at all, and to
gether the stories highlight parts of
life which aren't appreciated by those
of us who think we are freer than Gre

gory.
For example, one story called "It's
Spring!" depicts Gregory's thoughts of
excitement about spring, because
spring is when "the man" comes. Gre
gory bounces all around the room for
two or three pages, and then "the
man," a janitor in the asylum, walks
in and opens the window about three
inches. The last page of this story
shows Gregory's blissful face near the
window sill, with his eyes closed, in
haling what spring means to him.
Drawn in what would seem to be a
bland black and white, the artwork in
"Gregory" complements the theme
and content of the story wonderfully,
exhibiting the drabness of Gregory's

world and forcing the viewer to focus
on the salient points of the drawings
and the script rather than vivid hues
flowing about the page.
"Gregory" is masterful in that ef
fort. By forcing the viewer to pay at
tention to the little things about the
comic, it points out how little we pay
attention to the things we all take for
granted in life.
All in all, "Gregory" is social com
mentary that is hilarious and a blast
to peruse. I'd rather see Gregory
running around shouting "Ub ub Ã¼b"
and"I Gregory," than look through
some of the gratuitously violent and
sexual trash out on the comic market
these days.
