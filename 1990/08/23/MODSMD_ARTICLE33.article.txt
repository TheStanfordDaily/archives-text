## If it's mid-August it must be football 
### 
For those of you who
think starting football
practice more than five
weeks before school starts is
early, I have news for you.
While full-squad two-a-day
practices began Monday for
the Cardinal squad, relatively
speaking Stanford is getting
off to a late start. As a point
of reference, Colorado, the
team Stanford faces in its
season opener, has a game
this weekend.
Yes, I really said a game.
Yes, I really said this week
end.
And yes, I meant them
both.
The Buffaloes, who went
only 30 minutes from a na
tional title before falling to
Notre Dame in last year's Or
ange Bowl, meet Tennessee
this Sunday in the inaugural
Disneyland Pigskin Classic
from Anaheim, Calif. Afler
the opener Colorado will have
a week and a half to prepare
for the Cardinal.
What the Happiest Place on
Earth is doing running a foot
ball game is not really clear.
It definitely causes several
problems for the Cardinal,
however. The first one is
simple: When Colorado and
Stanford play in front of a
nation wide ESPN audience
two weeks from today in
Boulder, the Buffaloes will
have a game under their col
lective belts.
What happens in the first
game of a college football
team's season is simple: They
make mistakes. It's just one
of those things. When you
have a bunch of guys doing
things against other guys day
after day in practice they get
pretty good at it.
But when they start doing
it against a bunch of mean
spirited young men with the
sole intent of wreaking havoc
instead of their teammates,
problems inevitably arise.
So not only are the Buffs
widely considered to be much
more talented than the Car
dinal (they are ranked in
everyone's top 10, including
ranked preseason No. 1 by
two publications); they
should execute better.
But then my natural op
timism decided to kick
in. I'm not sure why,
but it's funny that way â€”

just when you think there's
no reason for it to be around,
it shows up.
I got to thinking about the
opener of the 1988 season.
Stanford was coming off a 5-6
season but had to meet USC
in the season-opener. The
Trojans had gone to the Rose
Bowl the year before and
were ranked in everyone's
top-20 (that was before the
days of the new top-25).
The men of Troy played a
game nine days before meet
ing the Cardinal and they
pummelled Boston College.
As The Daily's brand-new
football writer, I watched the
USC-BC game on TV and
came to the conclusion that
we would like be in deep doo
doo.
But with five minutes left
in the game, Stanford had a
lead, the ball, and a shot at
a touchdown that would put
the game away for good. But
the touchdown didn't
materialize, the field goal at
tempt didn't split the
uprights and the Cardinal's
prevent defense was more
porous than the Berlin Wall
in the '90s.
Stanford didn't win that
opener, but well should have.
And while I won't go so far
as to say the Cardinal will
stampede the Buffaloes in a
laugher, those in red and
white have a fighting chance.
One advantage the Cardi
nal will have is that Colorado
will have already played a
game. While that will give the
Buffaloes a chance to work
out their bugs, it will also
give the Stanford coaching
staff a chance to get some
videotape and study it.

Chris Cruder just completed
his tenure as The Weekly's
sports editor. He wishes he
could take this opportunity to
say, "I'm going to Dis
neyland," just like those fa
mous athletes in the commer
cials, but it's just not going
to happen.
