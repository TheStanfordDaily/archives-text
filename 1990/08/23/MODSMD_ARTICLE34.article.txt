# Pac-10 teams thrive in Europe
## 
### Chris Grader Editorial staff 
It's not every summer that
you get to tour Germany playing
the sport you love against
former professional players and
an Olympic gold medalist. For
senior John Patrick, however,
that summer was this summer.

Patrick, the starting point
guard on the basketball team,
was the Stanford player selected
to play on an all-star team the
Pacific 10 Conference sent to
Europe. And while the team
came back with only a 3-4
record, Patrick loved every min
ute of the two-week trip.
"It was great," he said. "It

was good for the experience,
playing against older, more ex
perienced guys... . For the most
part it was just a lot of fun. We
had a lot of free time and got
to meet a lot of German people."
After winning only one of
their first four games a week
ago, the Americans rebounded
last week. They defeated
SSV/SB Ulm twice to level their
record before losing the final
game of the tour, to MTV Gies
sen.
Patrick had 10 assists in the
first win over Ulm, a 97-95 thril
ler. He then had four points and
seven assists the next night in
a 92-88 win over the same team.
In the final game of the tour,
a 92-84 loss to Giessen, Patrick
scored 13 points with seven as
sists and only one turnover. He
finished the trip with a team
high 44 assists and only eight
turnovers in seven games.
He averaged 7.3 points a game
and shot 50 percent from the
floor for the trip.
"It was good playing with
guys I'll be playing against next
year so I know their weak
nesses," Patrick said.
Patrick, who alternated with
Washington State sophomore
Bennie Seltzer at the point, said
one of the highlights of the trip
was guarding Rimas Kurtinaitis
of Brandt-Hagen, which beat the
Americans 102-100 in the second
game of the tour. Kurtinaitis
was a gold medalist on the 1988
Soviet Olympic team and com
peted in the NBAs three-point
shooting contest a year ago.
"His range was like 26 feet,
at least," Patrick said. "I was
pumped up to guard him and I
think I did a good job against
him. He had something like 19
points."
The Pac-10 women won their
first three games on the tour.
Results from their final four
games were not available.

Junior Chris MacMurdo proved to be a key player for the Pac-10
All-Star team that toured West Germany the last two weeks. Mac-
Murdo helped the Pac-10 woman win their first three games. Their
male counterparts went 3-4.
