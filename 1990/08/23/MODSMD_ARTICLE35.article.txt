After a successful summer
tour and a bronze medal at the
Goodwill Games, things seemed
to be looking up for the U.S.
baseball team. But that was
before they went to the world
championships.
There, in Edmonton, Alberta,
the Americans reached the quar
terfinal round easily before the
wheels came off. Last week the
U.S. team struck out a total of
23 times in losing to South
Korea 5-3 and to Taiwan 10-7.

Going into a game against
Cuba the U.S. team knew it had
to win to have any chance of
playing for a medal. But the
Cubans are the top amateur
team in the world and they
proved it to the Americans.
Cuba scored a run in the first,
seven in the second, six in the
third and four in each of the
fourth and fifth innings route
to a 23-1 demolition of the U.S.
Junior David McCarty had a
double and a triple in the game
and scored the only U.S. run.
Junior shortstop Roger Burnett
went l-for-3 while junior catcher

Troy Tallman was 0-for-2 for
the U.S. squad.
After posting an 0-3 record in
that round, the Americans went
up against Canada for seventh
place. The United States
defeated their hosts 9-4 in that
game to clinch seventh.
McCarty was l-for-2 with an
RBI and Burnett was l-for-4.
For the tour, McCarty led the
team in hitting with a .445 bat
ting average in 32 games. Stan
ford's first baseman had 22
extra-base hits in 110 at-bats
and posted a .538 on-base per
centage.
