# Hopes for a thriving future in a troubled city
## 
### Dionne Scott Staff writer 
Contrary to the opinion of
Palo Alto, Redwood City and
Menlo Park residents, the city
of East Palo Alto is not a black
hole of hopelessness, according
to Mayor Bill Vines.
East Palo Alto does, however,
have its problems, including
crime, drugs and troubled
youth, he said.
The city seceded from Palo
Alto and became incorporated
in June 1983. The newly formed
government, however, overes
timated the financial capabili
ties of the new city and as a
result, crucial community serv
ices — including police — were
cut and a rise in crime soon
followed.
The East Palo Alto commu
nity has now adopted a "take
charge" philosophy to combat
the city's problems and rekindle
the spirit that was present at
its inception, Vines said in an
interview with The Weekly.
Vines said a top priority is to
redevelop and rebuild resources.
By "enhancing the quality of
service" given to the people, the
city hopes to increase commerce
and raise income levels.
Plans include encouraging
East Palo Alto residents to spend
their money within the commu
nity rather than outside the city.
Presently, they spend nearly $77
million in neighboring areas.
The construction of a 12-story
twin office tower complex in
Whiskey Gulch is one project
aimed at creating new office,
hotel and retail areas. Also un
der way is an attack on drugs
planned by the Community
Block Association, a residential
group organized to force drug
dealers off East Palo Alto
streets.
East Palo Alto citizen Kalamu
Chache works with one of the
city's most valuable resources —
East Palo Alto youth, specifi
cally girls and young women
ages 5 to 25.
Chache heads the Women's
Consortium, an offshoot of the
East Palo Alto Youth Develop
ment Center. The consortium
sponsors programs to instill
self-esteem and self-awareness
in women, to inform them about
their community and to guide
them in a positive direction.
According to Chache, a mcyor
accomplishment of the consor
tium is its new presence on
school campuses such as
Ravenswood Middle School. By
holding events on campuses, "we
have [the girls] on their own
time and their own territory,"
Chache said.
The response to consortium

activities has been favorable, she
added. Students visit Chache
regularly and volunteer to assist
her at the Center.
Consortium events include a
speaker series in which women
in business and civic areas, as
well as Stanford students, ad
dress groups of middle
schoolers. In another consor
tium program, students write
poetry individually and in
groups.
In October, Chache's girls
helped put on Red Ribbon Week
as part of a nationwide cam
paign to promote drug aware
ness. And every March, they
celebrate Women's History
Month.
Chache supports Vines' "take
charge" philosophy and suggests
that East Palo Alto residents
"collaborate, coordinate, and co
align" to produce change in the
city.
With the current notion of
progress, according to Chache,
East Palo Alto will be "winning
in the end."
Yet, City Council member
Warnell Coats questions
whether such hopes are realistic.
Coats said improving the

quality of life in East Palo Alto
will be "a difficult process."
Realistically, the present mayor
and city council are not going
to solve all of the community's
problems, he said.
Rather, it will require time.
"I am not Moses" and neither
is Mayor Vines, Coats said.
His comments come at a time
when several government offi
cials are facing sex discrimina
tion suits and other legal
challenges. In addition, East
Palo Alto citizens have conflict
ing agendas and are unwilling
to make certain sacrifices, he
said. Residents are scared of
making big changes.
Coats is looking forward to
the next election. With a better
city council and city manage
ment, he said he is confident
that East Palo Alto will be on
the road to recovery.
Coats and Vines may not
agree on the methods of chang
ing East Palo Alto, nor do they
share the same perspectives, but
both are certain the city will
eventually be the thriving and
positive community that was in
tended at its inception.


East Palo Alto Mayor Bill Vines says the city has adopted a "take charge" philosophy to combat Its problems.
