# Volunteers raise children's environmental awareness

For most Americans, environ
mental awareness is a relatively
new phenomenon. But one Palo
Alto-based organization has
been steadily raising people's
consciousness about the envi
ronment for 18 years.
Environmental Volunteers,
the Bay Area's self-proclaimed
"best natural resource," trains
volunteers to teach elementary
school children about a variety
of issues in the natural sciences.
"Our goal is to increase envi
ronmental awareness, specifi
cally by reaching children and
fostering in them a sense of
stewardship of the planet," said
director Barbara Popolaw.
Since its inception in 1972 as
an extension of the anti
pollution "Save the Bay" move
ment, the program has grown
into an independent project with
a lengthy waiting list of elemen
tary schools. In the 1989-90
school yeai alone, 125 volun
teers reached 11,500 school
children in San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, according to
Popolaw.
"In the past couple of years,

there has been an increase in
environmental awareness," she
said. "It is now considered cri
tical that kids learn about the
environment."
The program incorporates
both classroom instruction and
field trips. Typically, three vol
unteers go into a classroom.
After presenting a short intro
duction to the chosen environ
mental topic, they create three
"learning stations," and the stu
dents rotate among them.
"For example, we have a mud
station, with mud from the
Bay," Popolaw explained. "We
ask questions like, 'What is
clean mud? What is dirty mud?'
and show that what smells bad
is not necessarily . . . polluted."
Baylands ecology is one of
several topics volunteers can
teach. Urban ecology presenta
tions focus on what is natural
and what is artificial in the en
vironment by using the school
yard as a laboratory. Foothills
and forest ecology is frequently
taught at Stanford's Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve.
Two years ago, the drought
prompted the program to add
water conservation to its list.
Beginning in January 1991, a

unit in marine/ocean ecology
will also be available, as sugges
ted preparation for aquarium or
ocean field trips. The conserva
tion habits of California Native
Americans, local natural history
and earthquake preparedness
are other commonly taught top
ics.
A week or so after the class
room presentation, volunteers
take students on a field trip to
one of several Bay Area sites,
depending on the topic and the
school's location.
Outdoor education techniques
include games and "focusing ac
tivities," such as placing a circle
of string on the ground and
seeing what animals and plants
live inside. "We try to get the
kids in tune with being outside,
to realize that if they are noisy
and running around, they will
scare away some things that
would be interesting to see,"
Popolaw said.
Volunteers come from a wide
range of backgrounds, from
retired teachers to recent grad
uates.
Julie Pellone, 48, of Menlo
Park became interested in the
program when she saw it in her
daughter's kindergarten class

three years ago. "If kids do not
even know what the environ
ment is,. . . emotionally it is not
part of their souls," she said.
"But when you actually go out
and show them, This is what
we are going to lose,' I think
that is when you make a differ
ence."
In addition to teaching classes
and leading field trips, Pellone
has also designed teaching ma
terials for the program. One ex
ercise titled, "How much does
it take?" uses a diagram of a
multi-colored house with
various water-using activities in
progress. "Kids like bright basic
colors [and] games," she said.
"Making it visual makes them
more enthused."
Amy McLanahan, a Stanford
graduate student in geology, has
been a volunteer for two years.
"If kids see adults turned on
and aware about saving the en
vironment, they will be more
aware," she said. "I love to be
outdoors; I love to have kids
love to be outdoors; and hope
fully I can spread that enthusi
asm."
A three-month volunteer
training class, taught by volun
teers and other specialists, is

offered each fall through San
Jose State University. After
learning basic scientific knowl
edge and how to use the teaching
materials, volunteers are asked
to make a one-year commitment
to teach about once a week.
"The volunteers have in com
mon a desire to give kids a
chance to learn more about the
environment . . . [and] a desire
to conserve and protect the re
sources that are left," Popolaw
said.
Beginning this year, volun
teers will also train elementary
school teachers. "I don't think
teachers are trained enough in
science," said McLanahan, who
plans to become an elementary
school science teacher. "Hope
fully I can change that."
Students find the program
both fun and educational. "We
get thank you letters from kids
saying, 'I want to be a
(volunteer) when I grow up,' "
Popolaw said.
"It was like we were taking
them to Disneyland," Pellone
recalled of one third grade class
trip. "One said, 'Oh teacher, this
is the most beautiful place I've
ever been in.' "
