# Grants aid minority researchers
## Students head for doctorates, professorships

Inside a tiny cluster of trailers
nestled in Manzanita Park, a
brain trust works diligently
around the clock. Ruben
Fragoso is responsible for
destroying microorganisms with
the aid of histochemical
reagents.
In another room, David Pan
ton busies himself with global
finance. No, this is not a clan
destine plot to take over the
world through economic em
bargoes or chemical warfare.
This summer, Fragoso, Pan
ton and 12 other college stu
dents are skipping the beach and
hitting the books as researchers
as part of the Stanford Summer
Minority Introduction to Re
search Program and the Minor
ity Summer Research Exchange
Program.
The first, funded through a
grant from the James Irvine
Foundation, allows students of
color to conduct research at
Stanford under the guidance of
a Stanford faculty member. The
other receives its funding from
the Ford and Mellon Founda
tions, and its students may
study at one of six research uni
versities throughout the coun
try — Stanford, Cornell,
Princeton, UCLA, UC-Berkeley
and Yale.
Students in both programs
receive a stipend for room, board
and living expenses incurred
during the eight weeks of re
search. Transportation to and
from the host universities is also
provided.
"These programs are designed
to identify and enlarge the pool
of talented, underrepresented
students of color pursuing [doc
torates] and professorships,"
said Geneva Lopez-Irianni, as
sistant dean of Graduate
Studies.
In 1986, of the 32,000 doctoral
degrees granted nationwide,
only 820 recipients were black,
nearly a 26 percent drop from
a decade earlier. Today the num
ber of blacks, Hispanics and Na
tive Americans who become
professors has increased, but
only slightly.
In an attempt to lessen the
fears of potential isolation and
feelings of unpreparedness con

fronting students of color when
they consider graduate educa
tion, the programs give a select
corps of students — chosen from
over 60 applicants — a taste of
graduate life.
The students spend more than
40 hours each week on research,
leaving little time for just relax
ing at home in Manzanita.
"They also attend weekly semi
nars on topics ranging from the
rudiments of writing a graduate
research proposal to the neces
sary steps to get into graduate
school," Lopez-Irianni said.
"This summer has been a pe
riod of revelation and academic
rejuvenation. I have come to ap
preciate what it is like to be an
academic working with my pro
fessor," said Cornell junior John
Davis, who is comparing the ra
cial strife of Japan's Curaain
caste with the plight of ethnic
minorities in America.
For other students, like Stan
ford junior Tonia Gladney, in
volvement in the Stanford

program crystallized what to
her was an undecided future.
"IBefore] I was not sure about
a research career," said Gladney,
who is studying the tracking of
female students in high school.
"Now I see research in a positive
light and it makes me think
twice about a possible career in
it."
Junior Patrick Phillips
praised the program for making
his statistical analysis of multi
cultural education in urban
schools from last summer "come
alive" while also giving him a
decided advantage over his class
mates at the University of
Chicago. Phillips said he also
gained a new perspective on the
power of research.
"I think there is so much we
can contribute by analyzing the
problems of our community.
Our interpretation of our own
problems is underrepresented in
research out there today," Phil
lips said.

Research Program, gives an oral presentation of his research on
multicultural education before his peers in the program.
