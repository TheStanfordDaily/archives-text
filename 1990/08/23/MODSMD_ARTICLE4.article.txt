# Police link dead gunman to sexual assaults
## 
### John Cuerva Editorial staff 
Stanford Police believe that a
man who committed suicide
after fatally shooting a teenage
girl in a Northern California
town was responsible for a num
ber of sexual assaults in the
Stanford Foothills.
Police have linked Robert Mi
chel Christy to four attacks in
the area near the Dish. The as
saults, three attempted and one
actual rape, occurred between
July 1989 and June of this year.
In each incident, the method
of attack, the victim's profile —
young, athletic and attractive —
and the assailant's description
were similar, leading police to
believe that a single person was
responsible for all the assaults.
According to Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, police have cir
cumstantial evidence linking
Christy to one of the assaults.
Additional clues, although "not
enough to convict" Christy in
court, have given them
"probable cause" to believe that
he committed the other as
saults, Niemeyer said.
Despite a massive 200-hour
investigation which yielded over
100 suspects, Christy did not
become the primary suspect un
til after his death in a bizarre
murder-suicide Aug. 3 in Rock
lin, Calif.
According to the Placer
Herald, the incident occurred
just after midnight when
Christy, driving a Toyota
4Runner vehicle, rear-ended a
car driven by Stephanie LeDoux
of Rocklin, who was returning
home from a date. Both drivers
pulled over to the side of the
road and stepped out of their
cars.
Rocklin police were unsure of
the specific details of what hap
pened as the two stood outside.
But minutes later, some 20 feet

from the automobiles, Christy
fired six rounds from a semi
automatic pistol into LeDoux,
fatally wounding her.
Hearing the gunshots, Rock
lin police patrols responded and
pursued Christy to a dead-end
street, where they found him
dead from a self-inflicted gun
shot to his right temple.
Rocklin police believe that
Christy and LeDoux had never
met previously and doubt that
Christy intentionally rear-ended
LeDoux in order to force her to
the side of the road where he
could assault her.
Rocklin was shocked by the
murder of LeDoux — the town's
first in over 70 years. A recent
high school graduate, the 17-
year-old was a well-known ath
lete and prom princess.
Evidence found in his vehicle
indicates that Christy had re
cently moved to Reno, Nev., and
planned to enroll at Truckee
Meadows Community College. A

knife and stun gun were also
found in his automobile. How
ever, no evidence found in the
truck or on Christy's criminal
record indicated that he had
been a sexual offender.
Stanford Police did not begin
to investigate Christy seriously
until a U.S. Department of Jus
tice crime analyst read a report
of the Rocklin incident and
called them.
According to Niemeyer, the
analyst suggested that Stanford
Police examine Christy's case
because he had lived in the Stan
ford area and fit the description
of the rape suspect. "It was a
long shot," said Niemeyer.
Already working on the case,
Stanford detectives Del Bandy
and Tim Frecceri saw a photo
graph of Christy and began to
trace clues related to him, ulti
mately putting together the
pieces of the case's puzzle.
Christy's 175-pound, 6-foot-l
inch build, and his age of 28

years match the description of
the assailant in each account.
Frecceri and Bandy focused
on two important pieces of
evidence found at the site of the
Nov. 27, 1989, attempted rape
— a pair of eyeglasses and a
folding knife, Niemeyer said.
The two detectives were able
to trace the eyeglasses to a
Mountain View optometrist who
identified them and their pre
scription as Christy's. Police
could now directly link Christy
to the November 1989 assault.
The detectives then discov
ered a less substantial link be
tween Christy and the knife.
Investigations into Christy's
background revealed that he
was a former Army Green Beret
with an avid interest in outdoor
and Burvivalist activities.
Christy had also previously
worked in an outdoor specialty
shop.
The knife, a rare German fol
ding knife, is sold only at a few
outlets in the area, including the
Nature Company in the Stan
ford Shopping Center and a Los
Gatos Sporting goods dealer.
Niemeyer speculated that since
these stores cater to the outdoor
activities in which Christy had
an interest, it was possible he
bought the knife at one of them.
Furthermore, Christy had
been questioned in connection
with the assaults earlier in the
investigation. Last April, a
woman who had witnessed a
man running from the July 1989
attempted rape scene reported
seeing the same man jogging
around the Dish.
An hour after the sighting,
Police Deputy Mark Swineford
arrived at the scene to find
Christy still jogging. Swineford
questioned and took photo
graphs of Christy, and recorded
his license plates.
Police showed Christy's pho
tograph to the assault victims,

but they did not identify him.
Niemeyer speculates that this
was because the assailant in all
cases was clean-shaven, while
the photograph of Christy shows
him with a beard.
However, Frecceri and Bandy
interviewed Christy's neighbors
and learned that he shaved off
his beard at times coinciding
with the attacks.
Further investigation
revealed that on May 11, 1990,
Christy purchased a Sig Sauer
9mm semiautomatic pistol using
false identification. Christy used
this pistol in the Aug. 3 murder
suicide. The pistol also matched
the description given by the vic
tim raped at gunpoint on June
16, Niemeyer said.
Christy was forced to use false
identification to purchase the
pistol because he had been con
victed of a felony in 1986 in
Santa Clara and was by law pro
hibited from possessing a
firearm.
According to Niemeyer,
Christy used his brother's name
and date of birth to obtain a
driver's license at the California
Department of Motor Vehicles.
California law currently re
quires dealers of handguns to
send the purchaser's name to
Sacramento to be checked in
police files for felony convic
tions. Using his new license,
Christy's felony conviction did
not register on the background
check, Niemeyer said.
Christy worked at the The
Edge, a dance club in Palo Alto,
from January 1989 until last
February, and at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic from March 1989
until last July.
According to the Sacramento
Bee, which interviewed employ
ees of The Edge and the clinic,
Christy had a quick temper.
Warren Hukill of the clinic told
