# Cyclists experience real life oppression
##

Editor's note: This is the last
in a three-part series about
the writer's experiences while
cycling across the country
with Bike-Aid.

On June 18, I traded my
comfortable college existence
for life on the road. But I
had no idea before I left just
how comfortable my life at
Stanford had become.
I am cycling across the
country with Bike-Aid, an an
nual nine-week cross-country
trek aimed at raising aware
ness of issues of global
poverty and raising money for
the Overseas Development
Network.
On Bike-Aid, we travel
through both small towns
and large cities, interacting
with communities and ob
serving different lifestyles.
Because Stanford is pre
dominantly liberal, and con
ditions for minorities and
women are at least outwardly
acceptable, it is very easy for
students such as myself to be
lulled into a false sense of
security about social justice.
Stanford does have fairly
progressive policies and a few
highly vocal liberal voices, yet
apathy still reigns among stu
dents as the dominant social
outlook. However, I believe
Stanford students do care
about social issues, or more
accurately, they would if they
were exposed to an atmos
phere of real oppression and
social conflict — in other
words, life outside the shel
tered Stanford community.
Despite the progress that
seems to have taken place in
our society, discrimination
along racial and gender lines
remains the rule, not the ex
ception, in many parts of the
country.
In traveling across the
United States, I found that
this supposed "land of oppor
tunity" is not living up to its
promise for a sizable portion
of the population.
Blacks, Hispanics and
Asian-Americans are con
spicuously absent throughout
most of the Midwest, except
in larger cities where minor
ities are conglomerated in
small communities, generally

in lower income areas.
Native American tribes,
which once controlled and
protected the land through
out the continent, now live
on small reservations where
they are allocated poor, infer
tile land. They struggle with
poverty and related modern
maladies such as alcoholism,

while fertile land is frequently
"developed" and degraded by
its new owners.
Much conflict surrounds
the Native American reserva
tions scattered throughout
the West. In Elco, Nev., the
residents speak of weekly
fights between the "cowboys
and the Indians" — local
ranchers and Native Ameri
cans living on a reservation
just outside town.
And in many — perhaps
even most — parts of the
country, women are treated
as second-class citizens as
well.
At Stanford, feminism and
women's issues are often
viewed in a negative light by
both men and women. Many
feel the situation for women
is satisfactory; further dis
ruption of the comfortable
status quo is unnecessary,
and women who pursue such
issues are overbearing and
militant.
However, once in the real
world, the situation changes.
Suddenly, equal opportunity
depends on the possession of
a Y chromosome.
The women on Bike-Aid, in
cluding myself, often found
ourselves victims of harass
ment, in both overt and less
obvious forms.
Some incidents of harass
ment were obvious, such as
being touched too frequently
and too intimately by a man
who was hosting us in
Kansas. Others were less ap
parent — being subjected to
crude remarks, leers and in
timidation by men, or by
having our group split un
necessarily along gender lines
when doing manual labor at
a community project.
