# Moe advocates choice, radical school reform
## 
### Mary Sprague Staff writer 
The Josd Feliciano Performing Arts
School, the Isaac Newton School for Math
and Science, Music 13 and the Academy
of Environmental Science are not private
schools. Rather, they are high schools in
East Harlem.
Years ago, faced with a school system
which was failing miserably, East Harlem
educators did something dramatic to
turn things around. Reforms included
splitting up established schools to form
new ones. Fewer rules and regulations
were imposed on the faculty, and
specialty schools were created.
This new arrangement allowed stu
dents to attend the school of their choice,
and as a result, previously apathetic stu
dents became more enthusiastic and in
volved in the classroom.
Terry Moe, associate professor of po
litical science, outlines a similar choice
system for public schools nationwide in
his book, "Politics, Markets, and Amer
ica's Schools." Published in June and
co-authored by John Chubb of the Brook
ings Institute, the controversial book has
been getting much coverage, including
reviews in the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and the Sunday Times of
London.
Speaking of the educational system for
the poor, Moe asserted, "The current
school system is a disgrace." Thus, de
spite the expense of rocking "the es
tablishment," Moe believes revolutionary
reform must take place.
After studying more than 20,000 stu
dents, faculty and administrators in 400
high schools nationwide, Moe concluded
that "performance problems addressed
in the 1980s are not problems in the
schools directly, but instead system prob
lems." Our schools, Moe said, are too
bureaucratic, with too many principals,
superintendents, county and state school
boards and other administrators controll
ing the classroom from the outside.
Muddled with rules and regulations
dictating what goals are set, how each
dollar is spent, which subjects are taught
and which are not what textbooks are
used and so on, American schools have
become stale. "Nothing is left to the
teacher's discretion," Moe said.
Thus, he believes reforms for public
schools will never be effective if
reformers continue to look at individual
schools instead of at the overall educa
tional structure.
Moe's proposal begins with setting up
a pool of schools from which students

would choose. The schools, which could
be formed by any group of teachers,
would have a few mandatory guidelines
such as graduation requirements, but
"that's it," Moe said. "Schools will govern
themselves and organize as they see fit
— period."
Under Moe's plan, teachers would col
lectively decide whether or not to imple
ment a career ladder, a set amount of
homework hours, tenure, hall duty, etc.
"Autonomy is the key to effective govern
ing," he said.
Funding would come from enrollment
by attaching a set amount of federal
money to each student, like a scholarship.
To ensure that good schools would accept
economically disadvantaged students, the
government would probably attach more
money to those students, he said.
Because money would be granted based
on enrollment, Moe predicts the bad
schools would be eliminated since stu
dents would choose not to attend them.
Under this system, only popular schools
would stay in business which would
motivate schools to upgrade their pro
grams.
"Politics, Markets, and American
Schools" further discusses admittance
policies, an expulsion pool and the ab
sence of mandatory standardized tests.
Moe also advocates granting teaching cer
tification to anyone with a bachelor's
degree.
Moe is disappointed that some educa
tors have already stereotyped his book
as a revolutionary "choice proposal"
which discriminates against the poor.
"The political deck is stacked" against
choice, he said. Superintendents, school
boards and other decision-makers in
school policy view choice as the enemy
because they "like the system just as it
is and want to keep things just as they
are," attests Moe.
Moe cited as an example the attempt
by some government officials in Mil
waukee, which has a large minority pop
ulation, to start a 1,000-student pilot
program, which failed because of a resis
tance to change. He believes the es
tablishment means well but is actually
trapping the poor.
Although the "choice" system proposed
in his book's final chapter is getting most
of the attention in reviews, Moe empha
sized that it is based upon the 200 pre
vious pages of data, which are an effort
to understand the order and organization
of schools and what causes them to be
effective or not.
