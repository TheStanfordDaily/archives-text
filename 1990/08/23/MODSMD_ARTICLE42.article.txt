# Book traces man's path in discovering 'other self'

### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
In his latest book, "Access to Inner
Worlds," prolific British author Colin
Wilson examines the potential for a
greater awareness of the complexities
of the human brain and their
philosophical effects on everyday life.
Wilson devotes much of the book to
a discussion of the differences between
left-brain and right-brain activity. The
left side of the brain (also called the
left brain), which deals primarily with
reason and language, is most often
used in ordinary activities because of
its robot-like efficiency.
But Wilson argues that such a
reliance on the left brain gives people
only a two-dimensional picture of the
world, leaving the right brain, which
governs feelings and intuition, in a
role of secondary importance.
By seeing the world in only two
dimensions, it becomes possible to lose
touch with "reality," resulting in high
rates of suicide and mental illness.
But by allowing the right and left
brain to work together, a three
dimensional picture emerges that al
lows access to the inner worlds of the
human mind, Wilson argues.
The book focuses on the unusual

experiences of one of Wilson's acquain
tances, Brad Absetz. After witnessing
the slow, tragic death of his infant
son and the gradual mental deteriora
tion of his wife, Absetz slowly became
aware of his "other self."
This alternate being manifests itself
when Absetz is in states of complete
relaxation as he allows the synthesis
of his left and right brain. His other
self shows itself through involuntary
muscular movements over which Ab
setz has only marginal control.
When he first experienced his other
self, Absetz allowed these involuntary
movements to continue and to refine
themselves, and soon found his body
creating paintings of flowers and metal
sculptures of extraordinary beauty.
According to Wilson, "the crucial
step in individual evolution is quite
simply to recognize the existence of
that 'other self.' When this happens,
we are ready to embark upon the most
interesting experiment of all: to dis
cover what our two selves can do when
they enter into active collaboration."
In addition to his latest book, Wilson
is also the author of a number of
books on such topics as existentialism,
the occult, witchcraft and poltergeists,
as well as biographical works of
various philosophers.
