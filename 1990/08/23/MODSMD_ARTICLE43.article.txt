# A 						visitor's view of Stanford
## Americans appear clean, conscious, competitive 
### Sophie Romillat 
What first surprised me about Stan
ford University was its size. I had never
seen such a big campus, at least 10 times
as large as any French university. The
Spanish architecture highlights the
beauty of the area and reminds me of
Europe.
I like Stanford's juxtaposition of Eu
ropean buildings and the efficient Amer
ican way of studying. If you go to study
in France, do not look for a beautiful
campus like this one.
Usually, French universities are not
built to be aesthetically pleasing, but only
to accomodate more and more students
every year. To increase the capacity,
buildings are constructed very quickly.
French campuses are so ugly that
sometimes I wonder if they want you to
take up or to give up studying.
This campus is a very clean place,
which is keeping with the California way

of life. The people I have met are very
healthy and pay great attention to the
environment.
In France, people smoke, drink and go
dancing instead of working. I am always
ready for these activities and this might
be the reason I could not live here.
But a more serious problem is that
French people do not care about tidiness,
and most of them are not concerned
about environmental problems. They
seem to think that nothing can touch
them and that bad things only happen
to other people.
Another big difference between French
and American colleges is the ability to
find everything you need in the same
area. Being able to find a bookstore, li
braries (with thousands of international
books and magazines), coffee shops and
restaurants on campus is just amazing
for me.
In Paris, for instance, you
have to get away from the uni
versity to sit outside at a cafe
and you must take the subway
to get books, newspapers,
magazines, etc. Usually, there is
only one library (where you will
not be able to find any interna
tional publications), a small
school supply store, a very little
cafeteria and that is it!
The college I attended does
not even have a cheap place to
have lunch, which means that
you must go to a restaurant in

town and that is quite expensive.
What is really interesting to
me is the terrific organization
and the time that you can save
here. In France, you lose hours
just trying to run errands.
But, the tuition also makes a
big difference. In France, one
academic year costs between
1,000 francs (about $150) and
1,500 francs ($250) at a univer
sity, and between 20,000 francs
($3,500) and 30,000 francs
($5,000) at a private business
school.
So, it is easier to afford
studies in France than in the
United States, where you may
have to spend much of your life
paying back your loan. Hopeful

ly, an American student can go
to a public university or take
advantage of financial aid.
However, it seems very diffi
cult to study here if you are
poor, homeless or a minority be
cause you have more obstacles
to overcome. While it is true
that the United States offers a
lot of opportunities to people
who want to work, if you cannot
compete, you are out of luck.
I have been really shocked by
the number of homeless people
in big cities. I think that the
American government must pay
more attention to them and
create more social programs
that will make it easy for people
to get help.

However, it is difficult to com
pare the American system and
the French system — which is
not a model for sure. They are
based on different underlying
philosophies: competition in
America and social assistance in
France, even if we also need to
compete.
Another thing that surprised
me is the existence of a lesbian
and gay alliance, because we do
not have this kind of group in
France. (Maybe we are just blind
to the realities of life.)
I wonder if American students
go there very easily, even in the
country which symbolizes free
dom. I assume that, like every
where else in the world, it is

difficult to accept and to settle
down to this different way of life.
The last thing I have noticed
is the increase of conservative
opinions in the United States,
which scares me. More and more
Americans are against abortion
or in favor of the death penalty.
All in all, I would love to come
back here during the year to see
what the University is like when
it is full of people. I would really
like to know if people have time
left to have fun or if they work
too hard.

And also to find out if Amer
ican students are as lazy as
French students are.

not a model for sure. They are
based on different underlying
philosophies: competition in
America and social assistance in
France, even if we also need to
compete.
Another thing that surprised
me is the existence of a lesbian
and gay alliance, because we do
not have this kind of group in
France. (Maybe we are just blind
to the realities of life.)
I wonder if American students
go there very easily, even in the
country which symbolizes free
dom. I assume that, like every
where else in the world, it is

difficult to accept and to settle
down to this different way of life.
The last thing I have noticed
is the increase of conservative
opinions in the United States,
which scares me. More and more
Americans are against abortion
or in favor of the death penalty.
All in all, I would love to come
back here during the year to see
what the University is like when
it is full of people. I would really
like to know if people have time
left to have fun or if they work
too hard.

And also to find out if Amer
ican students are as lazy as
French students are.
