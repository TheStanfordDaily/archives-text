# A visitor's view of Stanford
## Americans appear clean, conscious, competitive

What first surprised me about Stan
ford University was its size. I had never
seen such a big campus, at least 10 times
as large as any French university. The
Spanish architecture highlights the
beauty of the area and reminds me of
Europe.
I like Stanford's juxtaposition of Eu
ropean buildings and the efficient Amer
ican way of studying. If you go to study
in France, do not look for a beautiful
campus like this one.
Usually, French universities are not
built to be aesthetically pleasing, but only
to accomodate more and more students
every year. To increase the capacity,
buildings are constructed very quickly.
French campuses are so ugly that
sometimes I wonder if they want you to
take up or to give up studying.
This campus is a very clean place,
which is keeping with the California way

of life. The people I have met are very
healthy and pay great attention to the
environment.
In France, people smoke, drink and go
dancing instead of working. I am always
ready for these activities and this might
be the reason I could not live here.
But a more serious problem is that
French people do not care about tidiness,
and most of them are not concerned
about environmental problems. They
seem to think that nothing can touch
them and that bad things only happen
to other people.
Another big difference between French
and American colleges is the ability to
find everything you need in the same
area. Being able to find a bookstore, li
braries (with thousands of international
books and magazines), coffee shops and
restaurants on campus is just amazing
for me.
