# Alumni travel to exotic, educational vacation spots
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Do you dream of faraway places? Do
you consider the educational value of
your vacations? Have you ever found
yourself in an exotic locale and wished
that you had your winter quarter pro
fessor with you to explain the local ecol
ogy and culture?
If so, the Stanford Alumni Association
might be able to assist you in planning
your next trip abroad. The association
sponsors a travel/study program featur
ing far-flung destinations and high edu
cational dividends. The program provides
Stanford alumni, parents and other af
filiates with travel packages that usually
include first-class food and accommoda
tions.

Each travel/study group is led by a
recognized expert in the area — often a
Stanford professor — and a guide in
charge of logistics.
The program sponsors about 40 trips
every year. The size of the groups ranges
from 15 to 20 for backpacking treks, to
100 to 120 for chartered cruises. When
it comes to destinations, anything goes.
Upcoming trips in 1990, for instance,
include an archaeological dig at Mancos
Canyon in Colorado, a tour of east Asian
cities, a Caribbean cruise aboard the fa
mous sailing yacht "Sea Cloud" and a
seminar at Oxford University in col
laboration with the Harvard Alumni As
sociation. In 1987, the program even
sponsored a trip to Antarctica, led by
University President Donald Kennedy.
The trips were originally conceived as

"another way for alumni to keep in touch
with Stanford and get reacquainted with
professors," according to Program As
sistant Director Mev Hoberg. But anyone
is welcome, she said. Current students,
their parents and even non-Stanford
affiliated friends are eligible for the trips.
There are only two entrance require
ments. For one, spots are reserved ac
cording to a first-come, first-served basis,
and can be secured by a deposit, the size
of which depends on the trip.
The other requirement is that one
must be able to pay the price tag. The
costs are quite reasonable, considering
the top-quality accomodations and
cuisine, plus the educational advantage
of having an authority along. However,

that does not mean these trips are in
expensive. Prices for 1991 range from
$800 for the Golden Spike Celebration
at Promontory, Utah, to $7,450 for a
cruise from Bombay to Haifa, Israel.
Bob Hamrdla, whose specialty is East
Germany, has led trips to the Soviet
Union and Berlin. "These are excellent,
excellent trips intellectually," he said.
"Although they are expensive, for what
you get they're really good. . . . The title
of the program is Travel/Sfudy, and that
is significant."
If you are a budget traveler, these trips
are probably not for you. But if you have
a touch of wanderlust and a lot of
curiosity you just might want to contact
the Alumni Association.
