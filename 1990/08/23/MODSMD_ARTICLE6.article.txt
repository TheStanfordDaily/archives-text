# Betas lose national charter
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
In the past year, Stanford's
chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fra
ternity had openly discussed
severing its relations with the
national fraternity. It no longer
has to.
In a resolution passed at the
beginning of this month,
delegates at the fraternity's Gen
eral Convention voted to revoke
the charter of the local chapter
after an almost 100-year pres
ence on campus.
While the action came as a
surprise to Beta President Josh
Sanborn, a senior, he said the
revocation should not affect the
day-to-day operations of the
campus chapter.
"It brings us more in line with
what we've been doing," San
born said in a telephone inter
view from Maine. "We weren't
living up to their standards be
cause we didn't want to."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Ramsey-Perez, the new
fraternal affairs adviser, said the
revocation will not affect the
Betas' housing situation or their
relationship with the University.
"So long as they are within Uni
versity guidelines and policies
and meet the educational mis
sion, there is no change."
The convention'B resolution
cites numerous factors leading
to the revocation:
• The chapter's declaration of
autonomy from the national fra
ternity in a spring Rushbook;
• Use of ritual and initiation
procedures separate from the
national guidelines;
• Lack of proper reporting
procedures of membership and

scholarship information;
• Lack of attendance at the
General Convention for two
years;
• Refusal to adopt the na
tional fraternity's risk manage
ment program; and
• An alleged $1700 financial
delinquency.
Although all aspects factored
into the national fraternity's de
cision, spokesperson Wayne Ed
wards said the Rushbook's
declaration of autonomy served
as the final straw. "Every chap
ter has to agree to abide by the
guidelines" determined by the
national chapter.
"You have to have that type
of discipline on a national level,"
Edwards said, noting that only
one other chapter's charter has
been revoked in the past five
years for refusing to adopt the
national fraternity's risk man
agement programs. He added
that national representatives
have been discussing the revoca
tion for a year.
Campus chapter's response
Sanborn, while admitting the
chapter and national had not
been on "the best of terms" for
a decade, said the chapter re
ceived no advance warning of
the revocation. "It's certainly
not the way we wanted it to
happen," he said.
The fraternity had been dis
cussing several contentious is
sues in the past two years,
Sanborn said, including sexism,
racism, party policies and"the
merits of whether we wanted to
be part of the national organi
zation."
This spring, the Betas an
nounced that their Rush would

be open to women because they
were "concerned with issues of
sexism, stereotypes and prob
lems that develop living with all
men," according to Sanborn.
However, lack of interest put
the idea of a coed house "on the
back burner."
Another discussion ensued
about a racial incident at the
University of Mississipi's Beta
house, leading some to question
association with an organization
with "a checkered past."
Furthermore, the campus
chapter did not require mem
bers to join the national
fraternity in order to be a mem
ber of the house, Sanborn said.
Although Sanborn said most
of the convention's reasons were
valid, he challenged the financial
delinquency claim and the press
release's prominent contention
that the chapter did not ade
quately report grade-point
averages for the chapter or its
members.
"As far as I know, we had all
our bills paid," Sanborn said.
He added that the chapter did
not compile a GPA for the chap
ter since Stanford does not com
pute them. However, he
explained that the chapter sent
members' grades a year ago, and
that the B + average was well
above the national fraternity's
2.5 minimum GPA.
Different party policies
The national fraternity's risk
management program also con
flicted with the plans of the
campus chapter. Such programs
have been a sensitive issue for
most fraternities since insur
