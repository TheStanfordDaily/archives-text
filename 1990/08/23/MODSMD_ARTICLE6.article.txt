# Betas lose national charter
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
In the past year, Stanford's
chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fra
ternity had openly discussed
severing its relations with the
national fraternity. It no longer
has to.
In a resolution passed at the
beginning of this month,
delegates at the fraternity's Gen
eral Convention voted to revoke
the charter of the local chapter
after an almost 100-year pres
ence on campus.
While the action came as a
surprise to Beta President Josh
Sanborn, a senior, he said the
revocation should not affect the
day-to-day operations of the
campus chapter.
"It brings us more in line with
what we've been doing," San
born said in a telephone inter
view from Maine. "We weren't
living up to their standards be
cause we didn't want to."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Ramsey-Perez, the new
fraternal affairs adviser, said the
revocation will not affect the
Betas' housing situation or their
relationship with the University.
"So long as they are within Uni
versity guidelines and policies
and meet the educational mis
sion, there is no change."
The convention'B resolution
cites numerous factors leading
to the revocation:
• The chapter's declaration of
autonomy from the national fra
ternity in a spring Rushbook;
• Use of ritual and initiation
procedures separate from the
national guidelines;
• Lack of proper reporting
procedures of membership and

scholarship information;
• Lack of attendance at the
General Convention for two
years;
• Refusal to adopt the na
tional fraternity's risk manage
ment program; and
• An alleged $1700 financial
delinquency.
Although all aspects factored
into the national fraternity's de
cision, spokesperson Wayne Ed
wards said the Rushbook's
declaration of autonomy served
as the final straw. "Every chap
ter has to agree to abide by the
guidelines" determined by the
national chapter.
"You have to have that type
of discipline on a national level,"
Edwards said, noting that only
one other chapter's charter has
been revoked in the past five
years for refusing to adopt the
national fraternity's risk man
agement programs. He added
that national representatives
have been discussing the revoca
tion for a year.
Campus chapter's response
Sanborn, while admitting the
chapter and national had not
been on "the best of terms" for
a decade, said the chapter re
ceived no advance warning of
the revocation. "It's certainly
not the way we wanted it to
happen," he said.
The fraternity had been dis
cussing several contentious is
sues in the past two years,
Sanborn said, including sexism,
racism, party policies and"the
merits of whether we wanted to
be part of the national organi
zation."
This spring, the Betas an
nounced that their Rush would

be open to women because they
were "concerned with issues of
sexism, stereotypes and prob
lems that develop living with all
men," according to Sanborn.
However, lack of interest put
the idea of a coed house "on the
back burner."
Another discussion ensued
about a racial incident at the
University of Mississipi's Beta
house, leading some to question
association with an organization
with "a checkered past."
Furthermore, the campus
chapter did not require mem
bers to join the national
fraternity in order to be a mem
ber of the house, Sanborn said.
Although Sanborn said most
of the convention's reasons were
valid, he challenged the financial
delinquency claim and the press
release's prominent contention
that the chapter did not ade
quately report grade-point
averages for the chapter or its
members.
"As far as I know, we had all
our bills paid," Sanborn said.
He added that the chapter did
not compile a GPA for the chap
ter since Stanford does not com
pute them. However, he
explained that the chapter sent
members' grades a year ago, and
that the B + average was well
above the national fraternity's
2.5 minimum GPA.
Different party policies
The national fraternity's risk
management program also con
flicted with the plans of the
campus chapter. Such programs
have been a sensitive issue for
most fraternities since insur
ance companies recently made
it difficult and expensive for
Greek organizations to get
liability coverage.
The national fraternity's pro
gram included having closed,
invitation-only parties, not
buying alcohol with fraternity
funds and other provisions that
the local chapter did not feel fit
the Stanford Greek system. "We
didn't refuse to adopt any risk
management, just not their risk
management," Sanborn said.
Edwards said most other Beta
chapters have "openly endorsed"
the national fraternity's pro
gram, and view it "as a solution
rather than a problem," he said.
Instead of closing their par
ties, the Betas attempted to
decrease their problems by
having several sober monitors,
abundant non-alcoholic bever
ages and outside security for big
parties.
"They [the national organiza
tion] gear their policies and re
quirements to chapters across
the country, mainly to huge
state schools where 70 percent
of the campus is Greek," San
born said. "They are trying to
make us into a state school fra
ternity, which we cannot be and
do not want to be."
Few ramifications expccted
Sanborn said he believes the
revocation should have a posi
tive effect on Rush, since the
action "makes us the only local

housed fraternity. Not having
national constraints can help us
build autonomy and build the
kind of community we want."
With 13 returning actives and
nine new pledges, the Betas did
not fill their housing quota last
year. However, Sanborn said the
fraternity is not in danger of
losing its house at 557 Mayfield,
since they have filled quota at
least one of the last four years
— the University's standard for
eliminating fraternity housing.
The house will change its
name and needs to examine in
surance options, two issues San
born said will be discussed when
school begins.
He called the insurance ques
tion "the largest immediate
Eroblem," but said statements
y University officials lead him
to believe the Betas will have
the same status as any of the
Row houses, which are covered
under the University's self
insurance program. "We will
have to be a lot more liability
conscious," he said.
Sanborn was also unsure how
the revocation would affect
alumni relations. "But once they
find out the circumstances," he

said, "they will probably support
us over the national."
Autonomy nothing new
Since Stanford has "always
insisted on local autonomy" for
fraternal organizations,
Ramsey-Perez said the revoca
tion should not change the
Beta's situation.
The national fraternity's press
release cited that the local chap
ter's separate policies had "ap
parent University support."
"We would not allow an out
side organization to dictate pol
icies for an on-campus group,"
Ramsey-Perez said. "It's one of
the conditions for recognition."
Ramsey-Perez noted that the
values of local fraternity auton
omy played themselves out in
the early 19605, when a campus
chapter admitted black mem
bers against the national frater
nity's wishes.
Neither Ramsey-Perez nor
Sanborn could make historical
comparisons about the Beta sit
uation, but both said there is
plenty of room on campus for a
fraternity unaffiliated with a
national organization.
"We can survive as a local fra
ternity," Sanborn said.
