# Rape crisis center helps survivors
## 
### Eleni Kirkas 
Although Stanford students seem
shielded from many of life's harsh
realities, the campus is slowly and
painfully discovering that rape is not
one of them.
Recent incidents involving the as
sailant in the Foothills have served
as an all-too-clear reminder that this
crime can and does happen â€” even
at Stanford.
But survivors of rape in the Stan
ford community have a resource many
may not realize is available: the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA's Rape Crisis Center,
located at 4161 Alma St.in Palo Alto.
Organized in 1974, the center offers
a variety of services to help survivors
of rape, their families and friends cope
with the effects of this horrible crime.
The center operates a 24-hour hot
line which provides emergency infor
mation, counseling and advice for sur
vivors in hospital, police and court
proceedings. These services are con
fidential, bilingual (in English and
SpanisTi) and free.
A counseling staff of 40 men and
women operate the hot line. All went
through a 40-hour state-certified
training session before becoming a
member of the staff.
On average, the hot line receives
about 90 calls a month, mostly from
women and mostly involving acquaint
ance rape.

While some men have called the hot
line, they have usually been friends
or relatives of women who have been
raped, according to a counselor, who
asked not to be identified.
However, the counselor added,
there are male victims of rape, and
for these men, seeking help may be
more difficult than for women because
of social stereotypes.
Callers to the hot line may request
either a male or a female counselor
and may request an advocate to ac
company them to the hospital or police
department if they choose to report
the rape. The center also makes refer
rals to other therapists or counseling
groups.
To protect the privacy of the sur
vivors, callers are not required to give
their names or otherwise identify
themselves to the hotline staff unless
they choose to do so. Because the calls
are routed to the hotline through an
answering service, they cannot be
traced.
No set formula
Why should a person who has been
the victim of a sexual assault seek
counseling? Although each survivor's
needs are different, counseling can of
ten aid in the recovery process, ac
cording to the YWCA counselor.
However, there is no specific way
to counsel. Counseling at the center
generally involves listening to the con

cerns of the survivors in a non
judgmental way. Survivors do not have
to give details about the experience
or about themselves.
Patricia Fabiano, director of the
Health Promotion Program at Cowell
Student Health Center, noted the im
portance of this flexible approach.
"There is no formula for helping a
survivor," she emphasized. While
many women experience fear, anxiety,
depression and anger, there is no fixed
pattern to a survivor's reaction.
Fabiano explained that counseling
is frequently an aid to the re
empowerment of the survivor, "a slow,
gradual taking back of the autonomy
and boundaries that have been vio
lated."
Incremental decision-making,
Fabiano said, starting with what to
eat today and perhaps progressing to
whether or not to report the rape, is
a part of this process, allowing sur
vivors to regain control of their lives.
Another issue dealt with in coun
seling is self-blame. Both the YWCA
counselor and Fabiano agree that this
is one of the most difficult emotional
effects of rape to overcome. Many vic
tims feel that had they acted differ
ently, the rape would not have oc
curred. Reinforcing to victims that
the rape was not their fault is ex
tremely important.
