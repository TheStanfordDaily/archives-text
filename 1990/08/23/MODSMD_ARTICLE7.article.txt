# Rape crisis center helps survivors
## 
### Eleni Kirkas 
Although Stanford students seem
shielded from many of life's harsh
realities, the campus is slowly and
painfully discovering that rape is not
one of them.
Recent incidents involving the as
sailant in the Foothills have served
as an all-too-clear reminder that this
crime can and does happen — even
at Stanford.
But survivors of rape in the Stan
ford community have a resource many
may not realize is available: the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA's Rape Crisis Center,
located at 4161 Alma St.in Palo Alto.
Organized in 1974, the center offers
a variety of services to help survivors
of rape, their families and friends cope
with the effects of this horrible crime.
The center operates a 24-hour hot
line which provides emergency infor
mation, counseling and advice for sur
vivors in hospital, police and court
proceedings. These services are con
fidential, bilingual (in English and
SpanisTi) and free.
A counseling staff of 40 men and
women operate the hot line. All went
through a 40-hour state-certified
training session before becoming a
member of the staff.
On average, the hot line receives
about 90 calls a month, mostly from
women and mostly involving acquaint
ance rape.

While some men have called the hot
line, they have usually been friends
or relatives of women who have been
raped, according to a counselor, who
asked not to be identified.
However, the counselor added,
there are male victims of rape, and
for these men, seeking help may be
more difficult than for women because
of social stereotypes.
Callers to the hot line may request
either a male or a female counselor
and may request an advocate to ac
company them to the hospital or police
department if they choose to report
the rape. The center also makes refer
rals to other therapists or counseling
groups.
To protect the privacy of the sur
vivors, callers are not required to give
their names or otherwise identify
themselves to the hotline staff unless
they choose to do so. Because the calls
are routed to the hotline through an
answering service, they cannot be
traced.
No set formula
Why should a person who has been
the victim of a sexual assault seek
counseling? Although each survivor's
needs are different, counseling can of
ten aid in the recovery process, ac
cording to the YWCA counselor.
However, there is no specific way
to counsel. Counseling at the center
generally involves listening to the con

cerns of the survivors in a non
judgmental way. Survivors do not have
to give details about the experience
or about themselves.
Patricia Fabiano, director of the
Health Promotion Program at Cowell
Student Health Center, noted the im
portance of this flexible approach.
"There is no formula for helping a
survivor," she emphasized. While
many women experience fear, anxiety,
depression and anger, there is no fixed
pattern to a survivor's reaction.
Fabiano explained that counseling
is frequently an aid to the re
empowerment of the survivor, "a slow,
gradual taking back of the autonomy
and boundaries that have been vio
lated."
Incremental decision-making,
Fabiano said, starting with what to
eat today and perhaps progressing to
whether or not to report the rape, is
a part of this process, allowing sur
vivors to regain control of their lives.
Another issue dealt with in coun
seling is self-blame. Both the YWCA
counselor and Fabiano agree that this
is one of the most difficult emotional
effects of rape to overcome. Many vic
tims feel that had they acted differ
ently, the rape would not have oc
curred. Reinforcing to victims that
the rape was not their fault is ex
tremely important.

In addition to individual coun
seling, the center runs numer
ous support groups for victims
of sexual assault, incest and
childhood sexual abuse, as well
as workshops for family and
friends of rape survivors and
special support groups address
ing the needs of teenage victims.
These groups are beneficial,
the counselor said, because they
help survivors realize that they
are not alone in their ordeal,
and that the feelings they have
are normal.
The workshop for friends and
family teaches those close to the
victim how best to help their
loved one through a difficult
time and how to come to grips
with their own feelings. Not
placing blame on rape survivors,
the counselor said, and letting
them make their own decisions
about how to deal with the rape
are key issues in this workshop.
The center also teaches wom
en's self-defense classes and pro
vides community education pro
grams in schools and other
forums.
Rape defined
Rape is generally defined as
forced sexual intercourse
against the victim's will, though
precise legal definitions vary
from state to state.
In California, rape is defined
as sexual intercourse with any
degree of penetration, no matter

how slight, under conditions
where the victim was unable or
unwilling to give consent, or
where force or threat of force
or retaliation were used against
the victim. This definition holds
regardless of whether the victim
knows the attacker or not.
Until recently, rape was not
recognized as a serious social
problem. Images of deranged
strangers lurking behind bushes
and targeting solitary women in
rare and isolated instances were
most commonly associated with
the crime. While this image is
not entirely false, the majority
of rapes fall into a very different
category: acquaintance — or
date — rape.
It is estimated that 80 percent
of rapists are acquainted with
the victim, though other es
timates place the figure as high
as 94 percent. Often, because
many survivors know their as
sailants, they do not realize
what happened can be legally
defined as rape, and thus are
not aware that the crime can
be reported.
Nor is rape uncommon. Na
tionally, one out of three women
and one out of six men will be
sexually assaulted before age 18,
according to most sources.
A survey conducted at the end
of 1988 by the Stanford Rape
Education Project showed that
the experiences of women and
men on campus mirrored na
tional figures. In that report,
32 percent of women and 12 per
cent of men surveyed revealed
that they had experienced
"forced sexual activity," defined

as vaginal, oral or anal inter
course against their will at Stan
ford. Ninety-eight percent knew
their attacker.
Nearly all of these crimes go
unreported. According to infor
mation published by the Special
Services Unit of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety, "In
the last decade, not a single date
rape has been 'officially' re
ported to the Stanford Police
Department."
Reporting the rape may help
police apprehend a criminal, and
can be a step in the healing
process for the victim. Reporting
a rape does not oblige the victim
to prosecute if a suspect is
brought in by police.
Even if a survivor chooses not
to report the crime to the police,
there are places to go for help
in dealing with the emotional
effects of the crime. Counseling
and Psychological Services and
the Bridge provide confidential
counseling at Stanford.
Stanford is also taking steps
to increase awareness of the
dangers of rape among the stu
dent body. Groups such as the
Sexual Assault Task Force, the
Rape Response Group,
Heightened Education on Ac
quaintance Rape, the Rape Ed
ucation Project and the Stanford
Department of Public Safety are
helping address these issues on
campus.
The YWCA counselor advo
cated mandatory programs for
all entering students to discuss
sexual assault and provide in
formation of where to seek help
if it happens to them.

women and mostly involving acquaint
ance rape.

While some men have called the hot
line, they have usually been friends
or relatives of women who have been
raped, according to a counselor, who
asked not to be identified.
However, the counselor added,
there are male victims of rape, and
for these men, seeking help may be
more difficult than for women because
of social stereotypes.
Callers to the hot line may request
either a male or a female counselor
and may request an advocate to ac
company them to the hospital or police
department if they choose to report
the rape. The center also makes refer
rals to other therapists or counseling
groups.
To protect the privacy of the sur
vivors, callers are not required to give
their names or otherwise identify
themselves to the hotline staff unless
they choose to do so. Because the calls
are routed to the hotline through an
answering service, they cannot be
traced.
No set formula
Why should a person who has been
the victim of a sexual assault seek
counseling? Although each survivor's
needs are different, counseling can of
ten aid in the recovery process, ac
cording to the YWCA counselor.
However, there is no specific way
to counsel. Counseling at the center
generally involves listening to the con

cerns of the survivors in a non
judgmental way. Survivors do not have
to give details about the experience
or about themselves.
Patricia Fabiano, director of the
Health Promotion Program at Cowell
Student Health Center, noted the im
portance of this flexible approach.
"There is no formula for helping a
survivor," she emphasized. While
many women experience fear, anxiety,
depression and anger, there is no fixed
pattern to a survivor's reaction.
Fabiano explained that counseling
is frequently an aid to the re
empowerment of the survivor, "a slow,
gradual taking back of the autonomy
and boundaries that have been vio
lated."
Incremental decision-making,
Fabiano said, starting with what to
eat today and perhaps progressing to
whether or not to report the rape, is
a part of this process, allowing sur
vivors to regain control of their lives.
Another issue dealt with in coun
seling is self-blame. Both the YWCA
counselor and Fabiano agree that this
is one of the most difficult emotional
effects of rape to overcome. Many vic
tims feel that had they acted differ
ently, the rape would not have oc
curred. Reinforcing to victims that
the rape was not their fault is ex
tremely important.

In addition to individual coun
seling, the center runs numer
ous support groups for victims
of sexual assault, incest and
childhood sexual abuse, as well
as workshops for family and
friends of rape survivors and
special support groups address
ing the needs of teenage victims.
These groups are beneficial,
the counselor said, because they
help survivors realize that they
are not alone in their ordeal,
and that the feelings they have
are normal.
The workshop for friends and
family teaches those close to the
victim how best to help their
loved one through a difficult
time and how to come to grips
with their own feelings. Not
placing blame on rape survivors,
the counselor said, and letting
them make their own decisions
about how to deal with the rape
are key issues in this workshop.
The center also teaches wom
en's self-defense classes and pro
vides community education pro
grams in schools and other
forums.
Rape defined
Rape is generally defined as
forced sexual intercourse
against the victim's will, though
precise legal definitions vary
from state to state.
In California, rape is defined
as sexual intercourse with any
degree of penetration, no matter

how slight, under conditions
where the victim was unable or
unwilling to give consent, or
where force or threat of force
or retaliation were used against
the victim. This definition holds
regardless of whether the victim
knows the attacker or not.
Until recently, rape was not
recognized as a serious social
problem. Images of deranged
strangers lurking behind bushes
and targeting solitary women in
rare and isolated instances were
most commonly associated with
the crime. While this image is
not entirely false, the majority
of rapes fall into a very different
category: acquaintance — or
date — rape.
It is estimated that 80 percent
of rapists are acquainted with
the victim, though other es
timates place the figure as high
as 94 percent. Often, because
many survivors know their as
sailants, they do not realize
what happened can be legally
defined as rape, and thus are
not aware that the crime can
be reported.
Nor is rape uncommon. Na
tionally, one out of three women
and one out of six men will be
sexually assaulted before age 18,
according to most sources.
A survey conducted at the end
of 1988 by the Stanford Rape
Education Project showed that
the experiences of women and
men on campus mirrored na
tional figures. In that report,
32 percent of women and 12 per
cent of men surveyed revealed
that they had experienced
"forced sexual activity," defined

as vaginal, oral or anal inter
course against their will at Stan
ford. Ninety-eight percent knew
their attacker.
Nearly all of these crimes go
unreported. According to infor
mation published by the Special
Services Unit of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety, "In
the last decade, not a single date
rape has been 'officially' re
ported to the Stanford Police
Department."
Reporting the rape may help
police apprehend a criminal, and
can be a step in the healing
process for the victim. Reporting
a rape does not oblige the victim
to prosecute if a suspect is
brought in by police.
Even if a survivor chooses not
to report the crime to the police,
there are places to go for help
in dealing with the emotional
effects of the crime. Counseling
and Psychological Services and
the Bridge provide confidential
counseling at Stanford.
Stanford is also taking steps
to increase awareness of the
dangers of rape among the stu
dent body. Groups such as the
Sexual Assault Task Force, the
Rape Response Group,
Heightened Education on Ac
quaintance Rape, the Rape Ed
ucation Project and the Stanford
Department of Public Safety are
helping address these issues on
campus.
The YWCA counselor advo
cated mandatory programs for
all entering students to discuss
sexual assault and provide in
formation of where to seek help
if it happens to them.
Although Stanford students seem
shielded from many of life's harsh
realities, the campus is slowly and
painfully discovering that rape is not
one of them.
Recent incidents involving the as
sailant in the Foothills have served
as an all-too-clear reminder that this
crime can and does happen — even
at Stanford.
But survivors of rape in the Stan
ford community have a resource many
may not realize is available: the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA's Rape Crisis Center,
located at 4161 Alma St.in Palo Alto.
Organized in 1974, the center offers
a variety of services to help survivors
of rape, their families and friends cope
with the effects of this horrible crime.
The center operates a 24-hour hot
line which provides emergency infor
mation, counseling and advice for sur
vivors in hospital, police and court
proceedings. These services are con
fidential, bilingual (in English and
SpanisTi) and free.
A counseling staff of 40 men and
women operate the hot line. All went
through a 40-hour state-certified
training session before becoming a
member of the staff.
On average, the hot line receives
about 90 calls a month, mostly from
women and mostly involving acquaint
ance rape.
