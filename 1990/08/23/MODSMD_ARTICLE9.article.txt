Alumni from Venezuela are
taking the campus by storm for
Stanford's first international
alumni reunion.
Nine Venezuelan alumni,
their spouses and their children

said.
Most of the alumni attended
Stanford's civil engineering
graduate school and have since
returned to Venezuela to plan
construction for the ports, har
bors, dams and hydroelectric
power plants that are necessary
for the improvement of
Venezuela's economy.
While Venezuelan universities
offer an undergraduate educa

"the research facilities, faculty
and the benefits of experiencing
another culture" make coming
to Stanford graduate school in
valuable, Rubinstein said.
A reception on Monday
brought these alumni, their
family, their professors and the
newly appointed Venezuelan
consul to the United States,
Guilhermo Madrid Abriu,
together to celebrate. "Many of
our families began here. It's
very exciting to be back. We
