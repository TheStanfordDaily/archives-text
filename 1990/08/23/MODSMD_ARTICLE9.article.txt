# Venezuelan alumni reunite on the Farm

Alumni from Venezuela are
taking the campus by storm for
Stanford's first international
alumni reunion.
Nine Venezuelan alumni,
their spouses and their children
returned to the Farm on Friday
to visit old haunts and relive
college memories. "Most of us
haven't been back since we grad
uated. For some it has been over
25 years," said Jacobo
Rubinstein, president of the
Venezuelan Alumni Club in
Caracas, Venezuela.
Group activities include a tour
of the Stanford campus, trips to
San Francisco and Monterey
and an afternoon at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
whose foundations were just
being laid when Civil Engineer
Pedro Arroyo, class of 1963,
began attending Stanford grad
uate school.
The campus "is still beautiful
but a lot less green, and is sadly

lacking a bowling alley," Arroyo
said.
Most of the alumni attended
Stanford's civil engineering
graduate school and have since
returned to Venezuela to plan
construction for the ports, har
bors, dams and hydroelectric
power plants that are necessary
for the improvement of
Venezuela's economy.
While Venezuelan universities
offer an undergraduate educa
tion comparable to Stanford,
"the research facilities, faculty
and the benefits of experiencing
another culture" make coming
to Stanford graduate school in
valuable, Rubinstein said.
A reception on Monday
brought these alumni, their
family, their professors and the
newly appointed Venezuelan
consul to the United States,
Guilhermo Madrid Abriu,
together to celebrate. "Many of
our families began here. It's
very exciting to be back. We
cherish the memories,"
Rubinstein said.
Three of the alumni's former
Stanford professors joined the
party to reminisce, including
Joseph Franzini, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
who continues to be involved
with Venezuelan students at
Stanford by hosting annual din
ners for them.
Friday's gathering, organized
by Bechtel International Center,
represents the first time that
alumni from a single country
have returned for a private
reunion at Stanford.
It comes as no surprise that
this group is the first to travel
the globe to re-convene in their
old alma mater. The Venezuelan
alumni organization consists of
400 members, many of whom
meet every three months for
lunches, discussions and lec
tures.

The I-Center is encouraging
groups of alumni from other na
tions to organize reunions along
the same lines as the
Venezuelan reunion.
The group is currently devot
ing their energy to a need-based
financial aid program for
Venezuelan students. They have
proposed a plan in which the
Venezuelan government pays
room, board and living expenses
while Stanford covers tuition
costs.
"Stanford says, 'Get in first,
pay one year, and we'll see what
happens,' " said Rubinstein.
While the cost of a Stanford ed
ucation may seem extraordinary
to the average student, tuition
is even more difficult to pay with
Venezuelan bolivars.
After hitting Bay Area scenic
spots, the alumni plan to visit
Yosemite, Oregon, Washington
state and British Columbia. "We
haven't just come to look
around. We want to share this
with our families. We want to
feel it again," Rubinstein said.
