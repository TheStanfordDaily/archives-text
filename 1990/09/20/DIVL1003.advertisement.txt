I'd never have believed that one little computer could make H
■ such an incredible difference in my academic and working life.

"I became a Macintosh convert in business school.
"At our computer lab I'd always find lines of people waiting to use
the Macintosh computers, while the other computers just sat there.
So I had a choice: wait for a Macintosh, or come back at 6 A.M. to
grab one before they'd all be taken.
"After business school, I took a job at a large bank and used my
Macintosh for producing everything from spreadsheets to a compa
ny newsletter.
"Today I use Macintosh to help me run my own management con
sulting firm. When I give a presentation, I can see in people's faces
that they're really impressed. And that makes me feel great.
"Sometimes I take Friday off, put my Macintosh and skis in the
car, and head for the mountains. I ski days and work nights. It's
perfect.
"You know, I can't say where I'll be in five, ten, or fifteen years,
but I can say that my Macintosh will be there with me."
