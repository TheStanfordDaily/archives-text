Ith the
list
it the top of your
everything else Just fells into place.
First days on campus can be
total chaos.
Too many things to pick up, order, and
buy. But when you have a starter kit of
checks from Stanford Federal Credit
Union and quick access to your cash, the
longest to-do list is easy to manage.
Start with low-cost —even free—
checking with interest.
Checking from the Credit Union, a non
profit cooperative, pays you more and
costs you less than what the banks offer.
Here's how the Credit Union and banks
compare:
Get cash—day or night—from
five ATMs on Stanford land.
With any checking or savings account,
you get a free Credit Union Automated
Teller Machine (ATM) card.
Use it day or night—at no charge—in the
Credit Union's five ATMs on Stanford land.
Or make withdrawals —for a nominal fee
—from over 50,000 ATMs nationwide.
Do it all in one quick stop.
One stop by the Credit Union, and you can
take care of all your financial needs.
This week, get your low-cost checking
with interest and your free ATM card.
And whenever you need it, turn to the Cre
dit Union for a lot more —a VISA card,
computer loan, new- or used-car loan,
whatever you need —all at unbeatably
low rates.
Go to the Aspen Room this week.
It's easy to join the Credit Union, get your
starter kit of checks, and sign up for a free
ATM card. Make this your first stop:
