IS THERE AN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH FOR ALL
MANKIND?
Many of us are looking for firmer convictions we can
stand on. How do we find them?
In all ages there have been those who have held high
ideals- incorruptible integrity, moral courage, unselfish
action.
These biblical individuals were able to glean some in
sight into Truth which motivated and strengthened them.
Today there is a religion which penetrates the instabil
ity of human life. It reveals the provable laws of God's
goodness and provides a solid basis for faith.
This religion is Christian Science.
