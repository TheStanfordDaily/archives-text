# Palo Alto native went East, then came home

When she graduated from high school, Gina
Silverman really wanted to attend Stanford.
But because she had lived in Palo Alto and
gone to Palo Alto High School, she decided
staying near home and going to Stanford
would be a "pathetic thing to do." Instead, she
enrolled in Brown University.
This fall, Silverman will come home to her
first choice as a sophomore transfer student.
Silverman said when she graduated high
school, she was not sure what her main inter
ests were. That led to the choice of Brown, she
said, because "Brown let you do anything you
wanted to."
In her freshman year, Silverman became in
terested in music and psychology. But because
she was unhappy socially and she felt the mu
sic and psychology departments could not offer
everything she wanted, she decided to leave.
"For all that money, I decided I wouldn't
just bide my time and stay at Br jwn," she said.
Outside of classes, Silverman has loved to
sing and perform since high school. She said
she felt Stanford'B music program and theater
opportunities had something to offer her. "I re
ally, really want to participate here," she not
ed.

First, she thought going
to Stanford would be a
'pathetic thing to do.'
Then, after sampling
Brown, she transfered
here.

Even though she was leaving Brown, Silver
man spent the summer touring the Soviet
Union and Scandinavia with the Brown cho
rus.
In high school, Silverman's participation in
the school chorus led to her senior-year selec
tion as one of two Peninsula-area girls on the
California All-State Honor Choir. In addition,
she played on the tennis team and was a mem
ber of student government.
Silverman has also participated in the Palo
Alto Children's Theater and is currently & cho
rus member in the San Jose Gilbert and Sulli
van Society's production of "HMS Pinafore."
"In my wildest fantasies, I see myself on the

stage as a profession," Silverman explained.
However, she is also looking for a "more
grounded career" and a more complete educa
tion, she said.
Along these lines, Stanford's well-known
Psychology Department was another draw for
Silverman.
"Psychology is definitely an academic pur
suit for now," she said. She also noted she
finds it interesting because it has "real-life ap
plications" and could develop into a potential
career.
Silverman said she feels that making the de
cision to transfer to Stanford was a "much
more conscious choice" than her decision to go
to Brown. Being at Brown "made me really
evaluate things," she said. "I know myself a lot
better now, and I really want this," she added.
She also said she thinks Stanford cares
more about its students than other universi
ties do.
Although she admitted a slight apprehen
sion about coming to Stanford, she said she is
looking forward to the start of the quarter.
"I'm definitely more excited this year than as a
freshman," she noted.
On a lighter note, Silverman gave another
reason for choosing Stanford. "There's a lot
less rain," she said, and "I'm a lot happier in
California."
