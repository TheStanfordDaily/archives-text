# Ex-refugee took road less traveled
## Transfer student fled Soviet Union to avoid persecution of Jews 
### Robert L Jamieson, Jr 
Transfer student Victoria
Fishman isn't overly concerned
about making a successful tran
sition from a community college
to Stanford. Her 19 years of life
have been an exercise in over
coming hurdles.
In 1987, Fishman and her
parents left the Soviet Union be
cause of the ethnic discrimina
tion they experienced as Jews.
"My father had been trying to
get us out for eight years, and
eventually we were granted per
mission to leave," Fishman said.
But the road from the Soviet
Union to the United States was
marked by detours. After leav
ing their native land, the Fish
mans went to Austria. Three
weeks later, the family headed
for Italy, where they were
housed in an immigration center
outside of Rome. Although Fish
man at the time spoke limited
English, she began to teach En
glish to other Jewish refugees
from the Soviet Union and Iran
who were also at the center.
"It was the case that I knew a
little English and they knew
none. It worked out quite well,"
she said matter-of-factly.
In March 1988 Fishman and
her parents made it to the Unit
ed States and settled in Fre
mont, Calif. Fishman then de
cided to pursue American higher
education and eagerly sent off
an application for admission to

'I knew a little Eng
lish and they knew
none. It worked out
quite well.'

UC-Berkeley. She was denied.
"Berkeley told me that I
didn't know English well
enough. They told me to try out
a community college for a couple
of years and then apply again,"
Fishman said.
Daunted, but not defeated,
Fishman enrolled at Ohlone
Community College in Fremont,
where she racked up academic
accolades in political science and
earned a degree in social sci
ences. She was also an active
participant in campus politics.
"And I learned English," Fish
man added.
Berkeley received an applica
tion from Fishman again this
year, and this time she was ac
cepted. But the Weenies got the
squeeze when Fishman decided
to come to Stanford, where she
will study U.S. politics or com
parative political systems.
"One of the reasons I selected
Stanford was because of the
quality of instructors. The pro
fessors are also very accessible,"
she said.
The career of Stanford pro
fessor and Eastern European
specialist Condoleezza Rice has

been of particular personal in
terest, she added.
Fishman admitted that her
avid interest in politics at one
time caused a 'mini-detente'
with her parents who had hoped
she would study 'hard sciences.'
But Fishman's father, a physi
cist at Stanford, has become
supportive of his daughter's aca
demic interests, and Fishman
eagerly anticipates the start of
school.
Although Fishman plans on
living at home in order to defer
dorm expenses, she does not an
ticipate any difficulty in making
friends. "It will be enriching to
get in touch with the diversity of
people here."
