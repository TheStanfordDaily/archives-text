# From Mexican farm life to the Farm
## Daughter of migrant workers sows new seeds for the future 
### Robert L. Jamieson, Jr 
For more than 10 backbreaking
years Eva Silva's parents have la
bored as migrant workers in the
sun-baked farmlands of Salinas,
Calif., to provide a better life for
their seven children.
This week Silva begins her
freshman year at Stanford, where
she plans to sow the seeds for a fu
ture outside of the farm field — a
future in medicine. But she
doesn't want to forget her roots in
her Mexican-American farm com
munity.
"My parents have worked so
hard getting up at sunrise and
coming home at sunset just so we
could go to school in [the United
States]," Silva said. "There are
lots of opportunities here, but life
in Mexico was very hard," she
added.
Her life in Salinas has also
been an uphill climb.
The Silvas arrived in Salinas in
1979. They spent many years hop
ping between rental houses and
apartments. At times, the family
— Eva, her mother, father, three
brothers and three sisters — hud
dled with relatives in cramped,
two-room dwellings.
When the Silva children
weren't shuffling to a new home
or working in the fields with their
parents, they were hitting the
books.
"Those years were tough. Ev
erything was shifting, constantly

go to school.'

in motion," Silva said. "We never
knew where we were going or
when we were going to leave. But
we had each other. "
Despite the instability, Silva
credits her success to family unity
and the stress her parents, who
have the equivalent of second
and fourth-grade educations,
placed on hard work and school
ing. In addition, four of her older
siblings have gone on to college.
"My siblings made it easier be
cause they paved the way for
me,"she said.
Last spring, Silva graduated as
valedictorian in her class of 400
students at Alisal High School in
Salinas. During high school, she
received straight A's in all of her
classes, including some that were
honors and advanced placement
classes.
Silva also excelled outside of

the classroom. As senior class
president, she created a program
to help bridge the gap between
students recently arrived from
Mexico who couldn't speak En
glish and Mexican-American stu
dents whose roots in Salinas
stretched back for generations.
"Without that program started
by Eva, students would not have
been able to talk over their differ
ences," said Pam Bernhard, Eva's
high school counselor.
"It goes to show that she is not
just a perfect student but also a
very unselfish and beautiful per
son," Bernhard added. Silva also
does not "make a big deal out of
her accomplishments," she said.

One such accomplishment was
being selected by Salinas city offi
cials to participate in an exchange
program in her junior year with a
high school in Parranquilla,
Colombia.
Witnessing how other people
lived and the chasm separating
the rich from the poor in Colom
bia really "opened her eyes," she
said.
At Stanford, Silva said she
looks forward to other eye-open
ing experiences, but admitted that
her planned pre-med course of
study would not leave much free
time.
She also will further her politi
cal interests by joining MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student organiza
tion.
To ease the cultural transition
from her Salinas community to
Stanford, Silva will live in Casa
Zapata. One of the first thing she
plans to do after getting into her
dorm room is to tack up a newspa
per clipping on her wall detailing
the rise of gang violence in her
home town.
Why?
"It's a reminder. ... It will
make me work hard and study,"
said Silva.
"Working in the Fields makes
you appreciate life," she said. "I
have to succeed for my people and
go back and and let them know
they can do it." She paused. "If I
can do it, they can do it, too."
