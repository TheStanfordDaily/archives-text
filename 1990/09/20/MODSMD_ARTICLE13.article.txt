# East Coast student finds laid-back West

### Sunil Perkash 
For Alan Burnce, the move to
Stanford from Massachusetts
means a move to a more "laid
back" environment.
Burnce said initially he was
"very torn" between the East and
West coasts. He has lived in the
Boston area, which he feels moves
faster than the West coast. So he
decided — on the last possible day
— that he wanted "to experience
something different."
In high school, Burnce's expe
riences included three years in
Woburn High School's jazz band
playing the piano, and two years
in its marching band playing the
xylophone.
Another activity important to

Burnce was the time he spent ed
ucating young children about the
dangers of drugs in a program
called D.A.R.E.
Aside from such extracurricu
lar activities during the school
year, Burnce turned his summers
into new and diverse experiences.
In 1988, he spent the summer in
Israel where he "liked the differ
ent culture and living with other
kids." Getting to know the people
in the program really well, Burnce
said it seemed like he had known
them all his life.
He admitted being nervous
about going college far away from
home, especially because he can
only go home twice a year. But he
said he is always open to new ex
periences — especially at Stan

ford, which he feels "has a good
multicultural environment."
Bumce wants to wait and see
how everything goes before he de
cides to get involved in any extra
Stanford activities. However, this
fall, Burnce said he may join the
Band, The Daily, Hillel and intra
mural sports to see if they suit
him.
Although probably not the de
ciding factor in choosing Stan
ford, Burnce said he is excited by
"the fact that the [Grateful] Dead
play a lot" of concerts in the Bay
Area.
While he realizes coming to
Stanford will require hard work,
in between Grateful Dead con
certs, he is determined to make
the best of his four years here.
