John Gouws' class of 65 stu
dents at Falmouth High School in
Falmouth, Maine, was smaller
than Paloma House, his freshman
dorm.
"That's what excites me about
coming to Stanford. In California
there are a lot of different styles of
people which I haven't experi
enced."
Gouws was especially im
pressed when he arrived early as a
prospective freshman and hung
out at the Oval. "There were peo
ple playing volleyball on the lawn
and studying under the sun. I
thought it was great," he said.
In a small school, Gouws had
the opportunity — and necessity
— to participate in many activi
ties. "I hated being bored. I've al
ways been taught that if I like to
do something to go for it, so I
threw myself into a lot," he ex
plained.
Gouws acted, sang in a chorus,
played bass guitar in the school
jazz band and was "a hot-shot
swimmer."
He cited his swimming career
as an example of the limits of his
experience. "I have some local
pool and high school records, but I
could never compete at Stanford,"
he said.
Gouws, a member of his high
school's theater company, worked
on nine or 10 plays and musicals.
"If I wasn't acting, I would be in
volved in lighting or set design in
stead," he said.
Gouws said his senior year was

'(Playing Jesus in
"Godspell") was a
beautiful way to finish
my career because I
felt partly responsible
for people in the audi
ence, who were
crying and really get
ting into the show.'

the pinnacle of his work in both
activities.
His swimming career was
capped with a narrow come-from
behind victory in the 100-meter
freestyle in the state swim meet
against a younger rival.
His ranking dramatic achieve
ment was playing Jesus in his
school's production of "Godspell."
"I'd done the musical before,
even acted the same part, but the
cast was so much closer that this
production was much better than
my first," he said. "It was a beau
tiful way to finish my career be
cause I felt partly responsible for
people in the audience, who were
crying and really getting into the
show."
Gouws said growing up in a
small town left him spoiled be
cause he had the opportunity to
become good friends with his
teachers. He credits his history

teacher, who also acted as his
swim coach and technical coordi
nator for some of the productions
he was in, for great encourage
ment.
As for the future, Gouws has
decided he's going to wing it. Til
be the first to admit my situation
was limited in high school. I took
the only physics class and the only
English class offered, so I don't
know what I like," he explained.
He describes himself as a day
dreamer with no clue what the fu
ture holds.
"I am the type who watches In
diana Jones and decides to be an
archaeologist," he said. "Some
times I get the thought that I
want to be a nuclear physicist and
find the smallest subatomic parti
cle known to man."
