### Mary Sprague 
Ever since Alyson Sharp
played a munchkin in the"The
Wizard of Oz" at age 7 at a local
theatre in Murrysville, Pa., she
has been very active in vocal
music.
With her first production be
hind her, she auditioned for
"Annie Get Your Gun" the next
summer with the Civic Light
Opera in Pittsburgh. Then, af
ter spending three consecutive
summers performing in this
musical, Sharp was selected to
sing with the Children's Festi
val Chorus of Pittsburgh, a se
lect group of young singers
ranging from 9 to 16 years old.
As part of this chorus, Sharp
sang in the productions
"Tosca," "Carmen," "Turan
dot" and "Hansel and Gretei"
with the Pittsburgh Opera. "A
highlight was performing
'Hansel and Gretei' in Ger
many," Sharp said. In Ger
many, the company had 20 per
formances in 30 days.
Throughout high school,
Sharp was a member of the Ju
nior Mendelssohn singers in
Pittsburgh, under the direction
of Robert Page. "Page is one of
the most renowned choral di
rectors in the country. It was
really great to work with him,"
Sharp said.
Besides being involved in
singing groups outside of her
school, she was a member of
both the Franklin Regional Se
nior High School Choir and the
school's swing choir.
In her junior and senior
years she was selected to sing
second-soprano at the All-State
Chorus Festival, a festival in
which only the top four high
school singers of each section in
the region qualify. Senior year,
Sharp took first in her region.
Sharp said she plans to pur
sue her interest in vocal music
at Stanford through voice in
struction, performance classes
and a good singing group.

credits includes
productions of The
Wizard of Oz,'
'Annie Get Your

'Hansel and Gretei.'

is steering in another direction.
She is "somewhat definite" she
will study electrical engineer
ing or computer science. "It's
tough to make a living by mu
sic," she said.
Although science and music
may seem like opposites, Sharp
explained, "There are some
people who are very good at
math and music. Math and
sight-reading music both take
precision."
Sharp is "somewhat wor
ried" about having time to pur
sue both a hard-core science
track and her music at Stan
ford. However, in high school
she got used to "running
around like a maniac," so with
her energy, she thinks it might
be possible to do both. "I am
considering a double major,"
she said.
The atmosphere during Pro-
Fro Week was one of many rea
sons Sharp decided to attend
Stanford. "Everybody was hap
py to be there â€” they liked the
school," she explained. After
considering the "social and
campus life" of the University,
Sharp concluded, "Stanford
has the best to offer for me."
Sharp said her mother is
particularly concerned about
earthquakes on the West coast.
In addition to reading litera
ture on them, her mother gave
Sharp a flashlight which in
cludes a built-in siren. The
siren is "in case I'm buried in
rubble," Sharp explained.
