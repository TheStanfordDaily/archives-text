# Fun and games — and a summer of work
## It takes two, plus nine, to coordinate hundreds at new student Orientation 
### Mary Sprague 
As an incoming freshman rushing from one
Orientation activity to another, Emily Simas
never realized how much preparation went
into each event. But this year, as general coor
dinator for New Student Orientation, Simas
knows Orientation doesn't just happen.
Indeed, Simas and her staff of 10 Orienta
tion coordinators have spent all summer
preparing to welcome the more than 1,700 new
students this week.
Ordering decorations for banquets, ice for
field day and helium for balloons at the airport
are just a few of the activities filling Simas' 17-
hour days this month.
"You can't believe all the things that need to
be done," Simas said.
As coordinator, her responsibilities also in
clude mcyor decisions — planning the calendar,
finding speakers for cultural banquets and set
ting up workshops on subjects ranging from
the environment to first-generation college
students.
"It's been very challenging," Simas said.
The paperwork alone has kept Simas busy.
She spent days filling out housing forms to en
able Orientation volunteers to move in early. It
took a while "to figure out the ropes" in the
campus bureaucracy, like learning the proper
procedure to reserve Memorial Auditorium
and testing rooms each time they are used,
Simas said.
Besides paperwork, reaching upperclass
men has been another time-consuming project
because many students left campus for the
summer. In order to get in touch with student
groups for the opportunity fair, singers for the
a cappella concert and Band members for the
rally, she has had to track down their summer
numbers.

'Orientation is not just a
week. It's the entire fresh
man year.'
— Emily Simas

The a cappella concert is one of many addi
tions to this year's Orientation. Other new
events include an all-campus scavenger hunt,
"so students can get to know the campus bet
ter," Simas said. Also, three cultural banquets
have been added: "Mardi Gras: Ctgun/Creole,"
"East European" and "New England: Por
tuguese, Irish, Italian."
In addition, the numerous fliers which have
been given to students in previous years have
been compiled into a handbook, the New Stu
dent Information Index.
The index will include information on sub
jects such as phone hookup, banks, Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, bicycles and computer
clusters. Simas said she hopes freshmen will
put the handbook on their shelves and refer to
it throughout the year.
Traditional programs which will not take
place during Orientation include the New Stu
dent Talent Show. Instead, it will follow the
Centennial Celebration, Sept. 30.
"The Fire Within" cultural program has
also been moved to later in the quarter, be
cause "such an important program shouldn't
get lost in the blur of activities," Simas said.
Also, since it is completely produced by stu
dents, Simas believes more students can par
ticipate if it's held later in the year.
The Sunday morning Convocation was an

other activity cut from the schedule for stu
dents to have a morning to themselves. Simas
wants "to keep them occupied," but based on
last year's evaluations, she realized some stu
dents felt too busy.
One of Simas' Orientation goals is making
students feel they are not alone in making the
transition from high school to college — be
cause "more than 1,700 other students are go
ing through this with them." She wants to
make the transition as smooth as possible by
making new students feel at home.
Simas said she thinks having students
picked up at the airport by Orientation volun
teers and having RAs know their names are
very important, "so they know they are not
just a nameless, faceless number in a big
school."
Being recognized by the residence staff is
very characteristic of Stanford's Orientation,
as is the emphasis on multiculturalism in
many of the planned Orientation programs.
Although new students might feel "over
whelmed" and "bombarded" by the theme of
multiculturalism in the beginning, Simas said
it needs to be stressed.
"Orientation is an introduction to college
life, and multiculturalism is a big part of Stan
ford life," she added.
While New Student Orientation officially
ends Tuesday, Simas sees it as a long-term pro
cess. "Orientation is not just a week," she said.
"It's the entire freshman year."
"What students are introduced to in Orien
tation is reinforced through residential pro
grams, etc., throughout the year," she added.
Simas' job was made more difficult by the
directive to cut $49,000 from her budget this
summer. She has tried to reduce the budget by

bargain-hunting for the cheapest
chips, paper plates, candles and
other products. Simas has also
gotten many businesses to donate
products.
She plans to cut back Universi
ty labor bills by having Orienta
tion volunteers do more manual
labor such as transporting tables
and chairs and emptying garbage.
Simas attributes the success of
Orientation to the Orientation
volunteers because they do every
thing from toting luggage and
putting together packets to mak
ing welcome signs and hashing.
"Without them it couldn't be pos
sible," she added.
Besides planning, Simas said
she and her staff answer calls "all
day long" from students and par
ents with questions. She said one
student asked if he should be
"well-versed on 'Courses and De
grees' " before he met with his ad
viser. Many parents are very wor
ried about whether their child will
be picked up from the airport, able
to open a bank account and buy
books before classes start.
She said she er\joys assuring
students and parents that things
will be fine.
Simas' message to students is
to have fun during Orientation,
because "you will work hard
enough once school starts. I guar
antee it."
