# Some new students are a different breed

Perhaps they will spend less time
playing volleyball. Perhaps they will not
run all over campus with the Stanford
Band.
But this year's 2,000 entering gradu
ate students, who outnumber the in
coming freshman class by about 400,
will constitute the majority of incoming
students and will help define the charac
ter of the Farm for the next three to four
years.
Among the newcomers are 170 first
year law students, who were admitted
despite stiff competition within an appli
cant pool of 5,720. Director of Law
School Admissions Dora Hjertberg
called the class "a very diverse group
from all kinds of different back
grounds."
Of these students, 38 percent are fe
male, a lower percentage than last
year's. Hjertberg, however, said the de
cline was "not planned."
The number of enrolled minority stu
dents increased from 43 last year to 49
this year, an "encouraging" increase due
in part to the Law School's strong affir
mative action program, Hjertberg said.
The 23 Chicano/Latino students consti
tute the largest minority group.
There are also seven international
students, three of whom are from Cana
da, she said.
The average age of entering law stu

dents is 24.6. Thirty-four percent of
them graduated from college in 1990,
while the rest have been working in jobs
ranging from government agencies to
consulting firms. There are also four
medical doctors and several professors.
In 1990, the Law School received 470
more applications than last year, follow
ing the national trend of increased law
school applications, Hjertberg said.
Despite a common perception that
fewer people have their eyes on the med
ical profession, the number of applica
tions to the Medical School has been in
creasing for the past two years. Out of
the 4,189 applicants this year, 86 were
admitted. There were 4,000 applicants
last year.
According to a published report by
the Association of American Medical
Colleges, the national applicant pool also
grew by 8 percent this year.
The 41 female students make up al
most half of the class, as opposed to only
38 percent last year.

Entering graduate students, who outnumber
the incoming freshman class, are a diverse
group from many backgrounds. The 2,000
students were selected from an applicant pool
many times that size.

The entering Medical School class
also boasts of increased minority enroll
ment, from 12 last year to 16 this year.
Of the 447 people of color who applied,
seven blacks, six Chicanos and three Na
tive Americans enrolled at Stanford.
Judy Colwell, assistant director of ad
missions at the Medical School, said mi
nority representation increased because
of active recruitment efforts. "We keep
working very hard at it," she said.
Finalized figures about entering busi
ness students are not yet available, offi
cials from the Graduate School of Busi
ness reported.
Forty-eight Ph.D candidates are en
tering the School of Education, out of
about 380 applicants. Twenty-seven per
cent are minority students, and 39 per
cent are women.
Statistics for the graduate admissions
to the School of Humanities and Sci
ences and the School of Engineering
were not available.
