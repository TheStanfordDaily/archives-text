Stanford turns 100 this year,
and across the campus, organiz
ers are in a flurry, gearing up for
the biggest birthday bash the
University has ever seen.
"An eclectic array of one-time
Centennial activities ... [which 1
range from purely celebratory to
commemorative to community
oriented events" has been
planned to ring in Stanford's sec
ond century, according to a state
ment by the Centennial Operat
ing Committee.
Although the University has
been officially observing the Cen
tennial since November 1985 —
the anniversary of the signing of
the grant founding and endowing
the University — this year will
mark Stanford's 100 th year of
operation. Entering students will
comprise the 100 th class to enroll
at Stanford, and this year's grad
uates will be the 100 th group to
receive degrees from the Univer
sity.
The occasion "gives us an op
portunity to celebrate our rich
heritage and prepare for our next
century and the host of chal
lenges this second century will
bring," said Susan Wolfe, assis
tant director of the Centennial.
Funding for the celebrations
will come from individual donors,
foundations and corporations.
The Centennial Celebration
should not be confused with the
Centennial Campaign, a massive
fund-raising drive expected to

bring in $1.1 billion for the Uni
versity.
This year's events will be the
culmination of a six-year celebra
tion honoring Stanford's history
and the people who have helped
propel the University to its cur
rent position as ono of the
world's leading research and
teaching institutions.
The Centennial Celebration is
an opportunity to re-examine the
University's founding goals and
apply them to the future, under
scoring the University's commit
ment to academic excellence in
both teaching and research.
Stanford, Wolfe said, faces nu
merous challenges in its second
century.
Not only will there be fiscal
challenges, such as funding re
search projects, but the Universi
ty will also need to examine the
implications of research it does,
as well as rededicate itself to the
humanities.
Moreover, the University is
faced with an increasingly di
verse population. Building a com
munity of these different ele
ments is one of the most impor
tant factors for Stanford's fu
ture, and "we're doing a com
mendable job," Wolfe said.
The entire celebration, Wolfe
said, "does have academic sub
stance at its core," and empha
sizes student activities and Stan
ford's multicultural element.
The Centennial Year will offi
cially begin Sept. 30 this year
with a special convocation to wel

come the 100 th entering class.
Speakers will include two promi
nent Stanford graduates: Brown
University President Vartan Gre
gorian and U.S. Astronaut Mae
Jemison, who will become the
first black woman in space in
September 1991, when she will
participate in a joint U.S.-
Japanese mission.
Also on that day, Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., will deliver re
marks at a ceremony in the Inner
Quadrangle to mark the issuance
of a Stanford commemorative
postcard by the U.S. Postal Ser
vice. The postcards will be avail
able for purchase that day at the
Stanford Post Office, and
throughout the nation on Oct.l.
The evening will close with a
bang: After a special Sunday
Night Flicks to debut "Stanford:
A Place in History," a student
produced multi-image show, the
campus will be treated to a fire
works display at the Oval.
A Founders' Day celebration is
planned for March with special
exhibits and publications, and
even a costume ball.
Although it is a festive occa
sion, the Centennial also has its
serious side. Social events have
been accompanied by academic
conferences, student projects and
prominent speakers since the
Centennial's beginning in 1985.
During the Centennial Year,
intellectual themes will be ad
dressed in the form of three Cen
tennial symposia, one to be held
each academic quarter.

Open to the public for no
charge, the symposia will consist
mainly of keynote speeches and
panel discussions conducted by
Stanford professors. Wolfe em
phasized that the programs are
designed to reach a broad audi
ence and are not strictly for
scholars.
The fall symposium is titled
"The Information Explosion"
and will discuss topics of technol
ogy and the access and control of
information.
The winter program, "Beyond
the Human Genome: Biological
Nature and Social Opportuni
ties," will examine the implica
tions of the ongoing project to
map human genes.
"Ethnicity, Equity and the En
vironment in an Interdependent
World," the spring quarter sym
posium, will focus on cultural as
pects of environmental issues
and their impact on ethnic con
flict.
In June, a special Commence
ment program is planned to mark
the passage of the 100 th graduat
ing class.
The Centennial Celebration
will officially end the weekend of
Sept. 28, 1991. Numerous pro
grams and events will entertain
thousands of expected guests.
The final event will feature
University President Donald
Kennedy launching Stanford's
second century by laying a Cen
tennial time capsule on the pre
cise Opening Day site in the
Quad.
