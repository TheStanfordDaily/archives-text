# Feeling like you don't belong? Impostor syndrome hits everyone
## 
### 
One hour after arriving as a freshman
at Stanford, I knew something was
wrong. Everyone else looked like they
knew what was going on. I was sure I was
faking it.
Naturally, going off to college was
something I had been looking forward to
for many months. And the nervous antic
ipation that morning was a lot like the
first day of kindergarten many years be
fore, as I left a familiar environment and
entered a strange new world of learning.
As I started unpacking my belongings,
meeting people and choosing my classes, I
felt more and more that Stanford was for
intelligent, talented and motivated peo
ple. At the time, however, I felt neither in
telligent, talented, nor especially motivat
ed, especially when I compared myself to
the people around me.

It was inevitable that the doubting
voices would make themselves heard. Did
I really belong at Stanford? Didn't they
make a mistake in letting me in? What
were they going to do if they found me
out? And whom could I trust with such a
secret?
People in psychology have a name for
this kind of phenomenon. They call it the
impostor syndrome — lots of people in a
high-pressure situation beginning to
doubt their qualifications to be there. Arid
if you're going through it too, I'll let you
in on my secret. It happened to me. It's
happened to most of my friends here.
Of course, it's possible that Dean Jean
and her staff made another catastrophic
mistake this year, and most of this year's
new students don't really belong here.
But it's also possible that Elvis is still

alive. Or that I actually won $20 million
from Publisher's Clearing House last
week. But I wouldn't bet good money on
it.
But wait a minute, you say. Just be
cause lots of people don't feel they belong
at first but manage to do OK doesn't
mean there might not be exceptions.
Namely you.
At this point, I need to explain some
thing. There is a big difference between
the questions, "Do I belong at Stanford?"
and, "Is Stanford the right place for me?"
The first implies there is something
wrong with the person; the second says
that something is wrong with the circum
stance.
That is, do you believe that different
colleges are right for different people? Or
do you believe that colleges are pretty

much the same, so it doesn't really matter
which one you go to — except maybe later
on, when you're applying to graduate
schools or for a job?
One theory is not necessarily more cor
rect than the other. But which one you
choose to believe affects what you should
do about the impostor syndrome.
If you firmly believe that Stanford is
the right place for you, the question of the
impostor syndrome boils down to giving
yourself the time to get adjusted.
But since most new Stanford students
are neophytes in the college game, it
might be hard to know after a few days
whether you have found a good match
with a college. I'm sure I wasn't the only
one working with not enough information
when I was trying to choose the right
school.

Reflecting on some questions posed to
my high school senior class one month be
fore graduation might benefit any college
student: Why are you going to college?
What do you hope to gain from it? How
much of it was your own conscious deci
sion as opposed to someone else's?
Three years ago, I could only come up
with a few vague ideas and no real an
swers. It has taken me seven quarters at
Stanford, one semester overseas and one
quarter stopped out to find answers that
made sense to me.
I may have been one of the last ones.
But don't wait until after graduation to
start thinking — by then it will have been
too late.
