# 'Revealing' essays tell of influences on class

Some high school students
filled out their Stanford applica
tion essays immediately, but most
waited until the last minute, hop
ing for some divine inspiration.
Despite seeming to mean life or
death to a potential Stanford ca
reer, the essays have "no right or
wrong answers," said William
Tingley, associate dean of admis
sions.
Besides letting the admissions
staff learn more about the appli
cant's character, the essays show
how the applicant thinks and
writes, Tingley said.
Applicants could choose from
two questions for the page-long
essay. Many applicants answered
"What in your life has helped to
shape your character or a value
you now hold?" by describing the
influence of members of their
family, mainly parents or grand
parents.
Some wrote about memorable
incidents in their lives, like high
school achievements or long ill
nesses affecting family members,
Tingley said. Students also dis
cussed more commonplace as
pects of their lives, including the
environments in which they were
raised.
Students responding to the sec
ond question, "What has someone
said or written that is especially
meaningful to you?," related ad
vice from a family member, teach
er, coach or friend. Others wrote
about their favorite quotes and
books, Tingley said.
Freshmen are required to "jot

a note telling your future college
roommate what to expect from
you in the coming year," and their
answers are often "revealing,"
Tingley said.
"Some write it in a way they'd
expect to write their roommate â€”
as if the admissions office
wouldn't see it,"he said.
Many applicants warned room
mates that they are messy. Some
wrote, "My mother has to get af
ter me," Tingley said. Several pro
posed the solution, "You keep
your stuff on your side, and I'll
keep mine on my side."
Tingley also said many told
roommates what kind of music
they listen to, writing they were
"tolerant of almost everything but
country-western or heavy-metal."
Often the answers to this ques
tion give "real warmth and hu
mor" to the applicant, Tingley
said. However, some applicants
were so candid they revealed very
"negative personal qualities."
Most students used the ques
tion "Is there anything else we
should know about you?" to share
something unique about their
home lives or schools that didn't
fit the other questions, Tingley
said. Some used it to explain a
fluctuation in their academic ca
reers, while others explained how
moving six or seven times affected
their extra-curricular involve
ment.
Some applicants balanced their
serious essays with humorous an
swers in this space, Tingley said.
But other students hurt them
selves by using it as "a pitch for
why they wanted to come (here),"
or simply to brag.
