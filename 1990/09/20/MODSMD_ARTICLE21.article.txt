# Anxious RAs prepare for frustrations, fun, frosh
## 
### Minal Hajratwala 
I was a typical clueless frosh. It
took me until the third week of
school to realize that my resident
assistants were actually students.
In fact, as I soon realized, RAs
in dorms with freshmen are not
only full-time students — they
also spend hours and hours at
their jobs for pay that does not
even cover room and board.
Months before their residents
arrive, prospective RAs go
through a lengthy and often trau
matic application process, includ
ing letters of recommendation
and group and individual inter
views. Upon notification, an RA's
job begins almost immediately.
This fall, RAs began training
Sept. 9 — almost two weeks be
fore the date most freshmen move
on campus.
During training, RAs attend
workshops and seminars on all
kinds of issues. An RA's duties
may range from rescuing resi
dents locked out of their rooms to
counseling students with eating
disorders and resolving roommate
conflicts. From race relations to
earthquakes, alcohol abuse to
AIDS awareness, the training pro
cess attempts to prepare RAs for
every foreseeable problem.
Residence staffs also go on
weekend-long retreats, where
they plan for the year and build
staff camaraderie. Planning in
cludes everything from how dorm
government should be structured
to how the name tags on doors
should look.
A good amount of every fresh
man RA's time is spent on memo

rizing names, faces and even
hometowns — all so the freshmen
can feel at home from the begin
ning, like individuals rather than
numbers.
So why would anyone want to
invest all this time and energy?
"As a frosh in Otero, I was in
awe of my RAs. I had a really
rough freshman year, and it was
really helpful to have considerate,
attentive RAs," said senior Jen
nifer Mason, an Otero House RA.
"My RAs let me know it was OK
for me to be me."
Senior Jill Banatoski, an RAin
a four-class hall in Roble Hall,
said, "Being an RA is an opportu
nity to have other students have a
really great year at Stanford. ... I
hope to let them know what they
can do while they're here — both
intellectually and just to have
fun."
However, both Mason and Ba
natoski anticipate challenges.
"It is always a challenge to
make a unified group and at the
same time spotlight individual
personalities, to be learning from
them and at the same time shar
ing the wisdom you've gathered
over the years," Banatoski said.
"It will be a challenge learning
to integrate the residents, to get
them to deal with each other as
people and respect each other's
ideas," Mason said.
In this way, the training is a
help, Banatoski said. "It is by no
means everything, but it is a way
to start thinking about issues of
racism, sexism, sexual orienta
tion. . . . The schedule is jam
packed, so we're going to be ex
hausted."
