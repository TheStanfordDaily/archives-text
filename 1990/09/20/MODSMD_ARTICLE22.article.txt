# Have Faith, Hope your roommate is a Joy

### Mara Winokur 
She used my hairbrush, kept her lunch in
the fridge until it turned green and left her un
derwear on the floor. And that wasn't all. She
also listened to Barry Manilow. She was my
worst nightmare come true. She was. . .
MY FRESHMAN ROOMMATE.
OK, so I'm exaggerating. She wasn't my
worst nightmare. But living with her for 10
months did seem like a bad dream. (And she
really did listen to Barry. I swear.) We had ab
solutely nothing in common.
• I was from a fairly progressive suburb of
New York City; she was from a little town near
nowhere.
• I was the biggest klutz to hit Stanford; she
was a varsity athlete.
• I was from a close but outspoken family
that valued individual independence; she was
from a close but repressive family that valued
conformity and obedience.
• I had never given much thought to — least
of all strictly observed — any religion; she was
devoutly Christian.
The list goes on. The things we liked to do,
the music we liked to listen to, the kind of peo

pie we liked to associate with — all were com
plete opposites.
It was as though someone had taken our
"Freshman Roommate Preference" forms and
tossed them. Or worse, read them and pur
posely put us together, on a whim. Stanford's
own little practical joke.
Could it be true?
It used to be. Students who worked in what
was the Freshman Information Project (FIP)
— now the New Student Information Project
(NewSIP) — had the ability to play games.
And they did. Usually, names were the
source of their fun.
Thus, the room in which one freshman had
the last name Rock, the other, Roll. And the
room with three Johns — across from the john.
Not to mention the Roble Bible Suite, so
named the year Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John lived there.
But these days — and for the last two years
— that hasn't happened.
Seniors Steve Lippman and Gary Loeb were
responsible for this year's room assignments
(Lippman for last year's as well), and they
swear that any name coincidences are just that
— coincidences.

"I know for a fact that four or five years ago,
people put freshmen together based on their
names. But I guarantee that nothing like that
has happened for at least the two years I have
been here," Lippman says.
Lippman and Loeb were given a pile of stu
dent information forms and told to pair (or
group) people based on place of origin, ethnici
ty and Cultures, Ideas and Values tracks. That
is, to make sure these categories don't match
within each room.
"We're supposed to make each room a mi
crocosm of the incoming class," explains Loeb.
"We look at everything except names."
But coincidences do happen. Last year a
room in Branner Hall was home to Faith, Hope
and Joy. Lippman, who was a guest speaker in
the dorm, was explaining that students are not
paired by names, when the women stepped for
ward.
"My credibility was shot," he says. "But it
really was an accident."
And as for preferences — such as music —
the two contend that they try their best to
match freshmen with similar hobbies but. as
Loeb explains, "it doesn't always work."
Obviously.
