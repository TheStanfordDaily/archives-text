# Full Moon in the Big Game? Don't Axe
## The 						clueless student's guide to the few remaining Stanford traditions 
### Tim Marklein 
Tradition. Tevye sang about it in "Fiddler
on the Roof," but he wasn't talking about
Stanford.
University President Donald Kennedy
made a similar tribute to tradition in the 1988-
89 "Handbook of Stanford University": "Tra
ditions hold their value only if they are kept
alive; they are a binding force that hold the
Stanford family together not only across the
campus, but across the years."
Although some of Stanford's traditions
have fallen victim to the budget ax or the in
surance chopping board, many are still alive
and some will be revived this year.
Like most colleges, Stanford's biggest tradi
tions center around sports, specifically football
— specifically Big Game. For those who don't
know, Big Game is the annual end-of-season
football game between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley, or Cal — or the Weenies.
Every game between a Stanford team and a
Cal team is prefaced with the word Big — Big
Splash, Big Swim, Big Row, etc. — but Big
Game is the really Big One. Think twice as Big
as your biggest high school football rivalry.
Think throw-the-record-books-out-the-win
dow Big.
What's at stake in Big Game? Very often,
nothing as far as the rest of the country is con
cerned; it's been decades since Big Game has

actually mattered in the college bowl picture.
But to Stanford fans, and maybe to the
eternally jealous Cal fans, the Axe is at stake.
It's Big; it's on a placard; and it's cardinal —
the color — a la its rightful owner.
Big Game also means Gaieties and the Bon
fire, and it used to mean a Big Game rally in
which Stanford students roamed the streets of
San Francisco as one very big neighborhood
gang.
Gaieties, which still exists, is a comedramu
sical that usually mixes very old and very new
Stanford jokes and sometimes does it in song.
The Bonfire is Big and features former Stan
ford Band announcer Hal Mickelson as the
emcee for team captain introductions and a
recitation of the Axe cheer, which goes thusly:
GIVE 'em the axe, the axe, the axe,
GIVE 'em the axe, the axe, the axe,
GIVE 'em the axe, GIVE 'em the axe, GIVE
'em the axe,
WHERE?
RIGHT in the neck, the neck, the neck,
RIGHT in the neck, the neck, the neck,
RIGHT in the neck, RIGHT in the neck,
RIGHT in the neck,
THERE!
Repeat — presto e furioso
Sure, it's repetitive, but it's a Big Game
Week thang. Cal wouldn't understand.

Another sports tradition, associated with
the Axe, is the Axe Committee. Stanford's stu
dent booster group serves as the caretaker of
the Axe, as well as several other Stanford tra
ditions, like the Bonfire.
Because the football team has not always
lived up to a Top 20 billing, other traditions
have arisen out of Stanford football games.
The Big Three to remember: the Tree, the dol
lies and the truly incomparable Leland Stan
ford Junior (pause) University Marching
Band.
After football games, and at other leisure
times when clothes needed to be washed, foun
tain hopping was the traditional way to cool off
after three hours in the scorching Stanford
Stadium sun. The drought has recently re
placed that activity on the tradition list.
As you can tell, most of Stanford's tradi
tions are Big and have some relation to Big
Game, but a partial list of others are unrelat
ed: Primal Scream every midnight during
Dead Week, Full Moon in the Quad, Senior
Pub Night, the Mausoleum Party on Hal
loween, the Grateful Dead at Frost (indefinite
ly dead), shortening every word or name to two
or three letters, frisbee golf, "Brajiner sucks,"
and the tennis team winning another national
championship.
But the most important one to remember,
and this is Big: Beat Cal.
