# Environmentalism: More than recycling

Coming to Stanford can
open the door to a world of aca
demic and career opportuni
ties. It can also give students
the freedom to mold their own
personal lifestyles.
While deciding what career
path to follow is important,
stepping wisely along that path
is just as crucial. One of the
greatest concerns of this age is
how to live life more in tune
with the environment.
As students, there are some
simple things we can do to help
protect the environment. Some
require only a bit of extra ef
fort, but they can make a world
of difference.
To conserve energy, simply
turn off lights and appliances
when you aren't using them.
Also, instead of buying regular
incandescent light bulbs, try
using compact fluorescent
lights.
Compact fluorescents give
off the same light as incandes
cent bulbs but require one
fourth the energy. They cost
more than incandescent bulbs
but last up to 10 times as long,
more than making up for the
added cost.
If you use a compact fluores
cent instead of an incandescent
bulb, you will save the equiva
lent of 600 pounds of coal over
the course of the life of the bulb
and reduce carbon dioxide
emissions, which contribute to
the greenhouse effect, by 60 to

75 percent.
Outside your dorm room,
you can conserve energy by
walking or biking to class and
by using public transportation
when you leave campus.
Stanford is small enough to
get around easily on a bicycle,
and besides, it's good exercise.
Buses connect Stanford with
many surrounding areas and
provide easy access to Stanford
Shopping Center and down
town Palo Alto.
CalTrain also provides good
service up and down the Penin
sula. With parking spaces at a
premium and the cost of gaso
line rising, alternative trans
portation isn't just an alterna
tive anymore.
At Stanford, the empty lake,
dry fountains and brown grass
are growing symbols of the
worsening drought. But these
cutbacks should be just the be
ginning. Students have to be
come water wise. Everyone
should conserve water by turn
ing off the water while brush
ing teeth, taking shorter show
ers and washing only full loads
of clothes.
Because we are so used to
living in a consumer society, it
is sometimes hard to imagine
the effects of our purchases,
but we have to try. A good max
im to follow is: Reduce con
sumption. Reuse what you can.
Recycle the rest.
The Stanford Recycling
Center collects aluminum cans,
glass, cardboard and paper from
green bins located conveniently
around campus. Recycle any of
those materials that you use.
Also, before you buy something,
think about whether it can be
reused or recycled. If it can't be,
then realize that you are adding to
the garbage pile that is slowly cov
ering this planet.
The Recycling Center can recy
cle junk mail and glossy paper, al
though it has to be put in separate

bins. Call the center (723-0919) to
find out more about what can be
recycled, so you can be a more en
vironmentally safe consumer.
When you do go to stores, bring
your own bag or backpack. It just
wastes paper or plastic to get a
bag each time you go to a store.
Along the same lines, when you go
to the Coffee House or parties or
out to lunch, bring a cup or mug
that you reuse.
When buying products, make
sure they are environmentally
safe. Go to the Bookstore or li
brary and look through one of the
many guides on environmentally
safe products that have appeared

on the shelves over the past few
months. Buy brands of soap and
detergent that have the least im
pact on the environment.
When you buy paper products,
buy recycled paper products.
Sometimes they cost a little bit
more, but no trees had to be cut
down to make them. The Book
store sells recycled paper note
books and computer paper.
These are just some of the
things you can do to live a life that
is more in tune with your environ
ment. You can also get involved
and encourage the University to
improve its environmental poli
cies or take an active role in envi
ronmental issues on the local,
state or national level by inform
ing yourself and sending out let
ters or speaking out.
