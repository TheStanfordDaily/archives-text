# Students lend many helping hands

Although Stanford is set in an
elite environment, the University
community tries hard to not for
get those who don't live in equally
fortunate conditions.
Public service is a primary em
phasis of the University's admin
istration and students, resulting
in an extensive network of public
service projects in the Bay Area
and beyond.
The public service effort at
Stanford is coordinated primarily
at the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice. The center run? the Public
and Community Service Opportu
nity Clearinghouse, which pro
vides students with access to "in
ternships and community service
jobs throughout the Bay Area and
the world," according to Tim
Stanton, the center's associate di
rector.
The center alsQ works with
public service organizations such
as the Stanford Project on Nutri
tion; the Ravenswood-Stanford
Tutoring Program, which match
es Stanford students with East
Palo Alto children; and Stanford
in Government, which places stu
dents in internships in Sacramen
to and Washington, D.C.
Established in 1985, the public
service center received a donation
of $5 million in 1989 from the
Haas family of San Francisco.
Many of the public service pro
jects at Stanford focus on poorer
areas such as East Palo Alto. Pro
ject TEAM, for example, is a stu
dent-led program that brings
Stanford students to East Palo
Alto to teach physical education to
grammar school students. Barrio
Assistance provides tutoring and
language training for children.

Other public service organiza
tions help the homeless through
the Stanford Homeless Action
Coalition, the elderly through
LinkAGE and earthquake victims
through a special project in Wat
sonville, a town near Santa Cruz
that was hit hard by last year's
earthquake.
The largest public service event
of the year is the annual You Can
Make a Difference Conference,
sponsored by the Haas Center.
Last year's conference, titled
"Changing Education for a
Changing World," brought more
than 100 speakers to campus over
three days to discuss public ser
vice in education.
Stanford's commitment to
public service was praised last
year by John Gardner, a former
secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare who was installed as
the University's first public ser
vice professor. Stanford's dedica
tion "recognizes that everything
can't be taught in classrooms,"
Gardner said.
"Stanford students are lucky
that public service has the active
and enthusiastic support of the
administration," Stanton said.
University President Donald
Kennedy indicated his personal
commitment to public service
when he said, "There's no accom
plishment at Stanford in the last
10 years that I take greater per
sonal pleasure in."
Stanton estimates that be
tween 1,500 and 2,000 Stanford
students become involved in pub
lic service projects through the
Haas Center every year. A survey
taken last spring showed that
about 80 percent of Stanford stu
dents do some public service activ
ity during their time at Stanford.
