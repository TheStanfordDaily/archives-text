# Programmer sees pluralism based on openness, understanding

Perched at the window in the
stairwell of Old Union, Greg Ricks
looks out over the bustling activi
ty of the Tresidder patio and
White Plaza, admiring the open
ness that he sees as being crucial
to the multicultural movement at
Stanford.
Residential Education's multi
cultural programmer came to
Stanford last year to continue the
successes and correct the mis
takes of the movement that cele
brates one of Stanford's most im
portant features — its diversity.
The multicultural movement
encompasses the efforts of the
University and its students to
achieve a pluralistic society at
Stanford.
The meaning of pluralism at
Stanford goes beyond a simple cel
ebration of cultures. It is the at
tempt to understand different cul
tures so that students can better
understand their own.
Pluralism is the attempt to ap
preciate the history and continu
ing struggle of all races and eth
nicities in the United States and
the world.
While the primary emphasis of
multiculturalism at Stanford has
been on the history and present
plight of blacks, Native Ameri
cans, Asian-Americans, Chicanos
and Latinos, an equal emphasis
should be placed on an under
standing of Jews, Arabs, the ho
mosexual community, women and

all other cultures of the minority
and the majority, according to
Ricks.
University President Donald
Kennedy, borrowing the
metaphor from Anthropology
Prof. James Gibbs, said last
spring that pluralism is not a
melting pot of different cultures
— "a smoothly blended sauce in
which no ingredient could be rec
ognized." Instead, he said it was a
gumbo stew, in which the ingredi
ents are mixed "artistically, pleas
ingly and yet can be identified."
The primary goal of Orienta
tion, Ricks said, is to make all stu
dents realize that they are part of
a larger culture. Pluralism en
compasses both students of color
and white students with Euro
pean culture, he said.
"Everyone going through Ori
entation is going to come out real
izing that he or she has a culture
to be proud of and ashamed of,"
Ricks predicted.
The movement for a pluralistic
community at Stanford has a
proud history of both struggle and
cooperation — an effort that has
often pitted students against ad
ministrators. Although in general
consensus on the goal of a plural
istic community, students and ad
ministrators have often clashed
on the methods of achieving that
goal. •
Student commitment was
demonstrated in a successful at
tempt to pressure the University
into divesting its assets from

South Africa in 1985.
Originally led by the People's
Platform, a student political par
ty, students then began to focus
on Stanford itself with a protest
over the ethnocentricity of the
Western Culture program that
was required for all freshmen.
The implementation of the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program
last year as a replacement for
Western Culture was the result of
continued student pressure.
Kennedy's dedication to the
creation of a pluralistic communi
ty at Stanford and the Universi
ty's institutional support have
been instrumental in the move
ment. This support has resulted
in the increased attention to mul
ticultural programming from Res
Ed, the creation of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
and greater efforts from the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admissions
to create a more diverse student
body.
The 1990 freshman class
boasts the most diverse combina
tion of students in Stanford's his
tory, with 45.8 percent students of
color. Although the percentage of
black students dropped to only 6.6
percent, the number of Asian-
American entrants jumped five
percentage points to 23.5 percent
of the incoming class.
The University has a system of
promoting pluralism that is
unique to Stanford among univer
sities, according to Ricks. This
support includes the Fundamen

tal Standard, Res Ed's encourage
ment of pluralism, the presence of
ethnic centers and ethnic theme
houses that "provide the opportu
nity for minority students to be in
a majority atmosphere," the Haas
Center for Public Service and the
University Committee on Minori
ty Issues report, he said.
The UCMI report, issued in
March 1989, and a staff subcom
mittee report issued later that
year, examined the role of the
University in promoting a plural
istic community and proposed 117
recommendations for increasing
the scope and the quality of Uni
versity contributions to a multi
cultural environment. The Uni

versity, however, was the target of
student protest soon after the
UCMI report was released.
In order to pressure the imple
mentation of the recommenda
tions, students under the banner
of the Students of Color Coalition
occupied Kennedy's office on May
15, 1989, leading to the arrest of
55 students. The goals of the
protest were to push for an Asian-
American studies tenure-track
position, a new full-time dean for
the Chicano/Latino community
and the creation of a Discrimina
tion Grievance Board, among oth
er things.
However, instead of galvaniz
ing student opinion behind the
student protesters, the takeover
polarized the student body A poll
taken by The Daily soon after the
takeover showed that while more
than three-quarters of students
supported the goals of the protest,
only 21.5 percent of students
agreed with the necessity of a
takeover.
Over the last year, the move
ment for pluralism has met more
resistance than ever before from
many students, in part because of
dissatisfaction with the takeover.
Ricks said there had been some
"methodological mistakes" in the
implementation of pluralism, but
he said he l>opes "the students
won't throw tire baby out with the
bath water." Ir order to put plu
ralism on the light track, Ricks
proposed a number of changes in
the University's approach to the

movement.
First, Ricks said the movement
should be led by students, instead
of being implemented by the Uni
versity. "I don't want to lead [the
multiculturalism movement!. I
want to coach it. I want to support
it,"he said.
In addition, Ricks said he want
ed to create "a more inclusive,
broader definition of multicultur
alism" that would be able to incor
porate all Stanford students.
"The idea of things being 'politi
cally correct' is out," Ricks said,
"because it's a very stifling, op
pressive attitude. Everyone's
thoughts and ideas should be con
sidered."
An added focus of the plural
ism movement will be a focus on
class differentiations and how
class discrimination affects soci
ety.
The movement for a pluralistic
community has been a remark
able success at Stanford, resulting
in a greater degree of multicultur
al understanding than at any oth
er university, Ricks said. But even
Stanford has a long way to go be
fore it reaches a truly multicultur
al environment.
On a continuum of pluralistic
understanding that ranges from
intolerant to tolerant to integrat
ed to pluralistic, "Stanford is
firmly in the category of toler
ant," according to Ricks, indicat
ing that the University has a lot of
work to do before a pluralistic so
ciety is achieved.
