# Stanford: Computing to the Macs
## 
### Bruce Arthur 
Stanford provides many com
puter resources for all students,
from freshmen to post-doctoral
scholars.
Personal computers such as
IBMs and Apple Macintoshes are
available, and access to main
frame computers is possible from
many terminals across campus.
Two main computer clusters
are available for student needs,
such as word processing, using
spreadsheets and accessing infor
mation sources.
Academic Information Re
sources (AIR) provides computing
support for students, faculty and
staff.

The AIRport cluster is located
on the second floor of Tresidder
Union. It holds 68 Mac II and Mac
Ilex computers which are con
nected to SUNet; it also has both
dot-matrix and laser printing fa
cilities.
Another AIR cluster, located on
the second floor of Sweet Hall, is
open 24 hours a day. Sun SPARC
Stations, Next workstations,
printers and SUNet terminals are
available, and most machines re
quire a Portia account. Help is
available at both locations.
Other clusters are located at:
• School of Engineering library
• Term an Engineering Build
ing, room 104
• Law School

• Business School
• Green and Meyer Libraries
• Residence halls
For students interested in pur
chasing their own computers, Mi
crodisc (located in the Stanford
Bookstore) sells Apple and IBM
personal computers and software
to students, faculty and staff at a
considerable discount.
The Stanford University Net
work connects most of the campus
computers and allows users to log
on to mainframes from many lo
cations. SUNet also allows users
to send electronic mail to other
users on campus and across the
country.
