# Stanford: Computing to the Macs
## 
### Bruce Arthur 
Stanford provides many com
puter resources for all students,
from freshmen to post-doctoral
scholars.
Personal computers such as
IBMs and Apple Macintoshes are
available, and access to main
frame computers is possible from
many terminals across campus.
Two main computer clusters
are available for student needs,
such as word processing, using
spreadsheets and accessing infor
mation sources.
Academic Information Re
sources (AIR) provides computing
support for students, faculty and
staff.

The Alßport cluster is located
on the second floor of Tresidder
Union. It holds 68 Mac II and Mac
Ilex computers which are con
nected to SUNet; it also has both
dot-matrix and laser printing fa
cilities.
Another AIR cluster, located on
the second floor of Sweet Hall, is
open 24 hours a day. Sun SPARC
Stations, Next workstations,
printers and SUNet terminals are
available, and most machines re
quire a Portia account. Help is
available at both locations.
Other clusters are located at:
• School of Engineering library
• Term an Engineering Build
ing, room 104
• Law School

• Business School
• Green and Meyer Libraries
• Residence halls
For students interested in pur
chasing their own computers, Mi
crodisc (located in the Stanford
Bookstore) sells Apple and IBM
personal computers and software
to students, faculty and staff at a
considerable discount.
The Stanford University Net
work connects most of the campus
computers and allows users to log
on to mainframes from many lo
cations. SUNet also allows users
to send electronic mail to other
users on campus and across the
country.
In order to send mail (or do
anything else on the mainframes)
it is first necessary to get an ac
count. Accounts are available for
all registered students on the
Macbeth and Portia systems.
To get an account on either
computer, you need a student ID
number and a terminal connected
to SUNet.
Introductory classes about the
mainframes are available during
the first few weeks of the quarter,
and schedules are available in
Sweet Hall.
Folio is a computer system de
signed to allow students, faculty
and staff free and easy computer
ized access to information at
Stanford. Through Folio, students
can access the catalog of the Stan
ford libraries, listings of summer
jobs and internships, the ASSU
Course Guide, off-campus hous
ing and more.
Public Folio terminals are
available at most campus li
braries, the Bechtel International
Center, the Career Planning and
Placement Center and the Under
graduate Advising Center. Folio
can also be searched from com
puters connected to SUNet if the
user has a personal Folio account,
obtainable at any of the above lo
cations with current Stanford ID.
Clusters in residences are su
pervised by the local Resident
Computer Coordinator. RCCs also
teach Computer Science IC, an in
troduction to the Macintosh com
puter.
