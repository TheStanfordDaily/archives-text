# Center offers camaraderie, community for gay students

Some walk boldly up the out
side stairs of the Fire Truck
House in their first week at Stan
ford. It takes others months, even
years. And some never do.
The second floor of the Fire
Truck House, located on Santa
Teresa Street across from Tresid
der Union, is the recently reno
vated Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center.
When a large pink and purple
sign is visible at the top of the
stairs, it means the center is open.
During regular hours, Monday
through Friday, noon to 6 p.m.,
staff members are there to answer
questions, provide information or
just talk.
The community center, which
is also accessible by an inside
staircase, has comfortable sofas, a
stereo and a videocassette
recorder, making it a good place to
just hang out. Bulletin boards dis
play news about current events,
housing notices and other Bay
Area organizations. A library con
tains videotapes and books which
can be checked out, and recent
copies of magazines.
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford, the largest and oldest
group housed at the center, will
celebrate its 20th anniversary this
October. GLAS sponsors Monday
night movies, weekly socials and
quarterly dances.
Beyond Heterosexuality is a
relatively new women's social net
work which is open to students,
faculty and staff. Members receive
a confidential membership list
and monthly newsletter.
The network, begun in winter
1990 to meet the specific social
needs of lesbians, bisexual women
and women exploring their sexu
ality, now lists 60 members. Week
ly events — including theater
trips, hiking, dancing in the City
and films — are the group's focus.
A similar Stanford Men's Net
work is in the works for the up
coming year, for men who do not
necessarily want to be involved in
other community events but
would like to participate in off
campus social events.
The Speakers' Bureau is per
haps the most visible part of Stan
ford's gay community. Panels of
three to five students visit dorms
to speak about their personal ex
periences and answer questions.
The speakers attempt to dispel
myths and promote tolerance
around issues of sexual orienta
tion.
Stanford also has a number of
gay activist groups. A committee
has been negotiating for more
than a year for a policy that would
extend spouses' privileges to do
mestic partners of gay and lesbian
students.
The Stanford Organization for

Lesbian and Gay Equality stages
rapid responses to issues as they
arise. Past events to which the
group has responded include the
physical assault of a gay person,
homophobic verbal attacks and
vandalism of the "Gay Libera
tion" statue in Lomita Mall.
AIDS education is a distinct
part of Stanford's gay activism.
The Safer Sex Shoppe, located on
the first floor of the Fire Truck
House, offers a wide assortment
of condoms, massage oils and oth
er safe sex aids. The AIDS Educa
tion Project works on raising cam
pus awareness, sponsoring events
such as a condom-rating contest
in conjunction with Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week each May.
Project SAVE (Stanford AIDS
Volunteer Educators) will offer
four dorm outreach programs this
year. The most popular is likely to
be the "rubberware party," a
demonstration of various condom
types and techniques. Also, "AIDS
101" will teach the basics of the

disease, "Living with AIDS" will
allow students the opportunity to
leam about AIDS from someone
who has it and a fourth program
will address "Sexuality and Inti
macy in the Age of AIDS."
B.boardgay, an electronic bul
letin board accessible through
Stanford's electronic mail net
work, is another important
resource. The bulletin board func
tions as a forum for community
discussion and information
spreading.
The community center will
sponsor an "orientation" celebra
tion Oct. 2 and a community
building orientation weekend Oct.
5-7. Both events are open to any
one interested.

sexual resources on campus, call:
