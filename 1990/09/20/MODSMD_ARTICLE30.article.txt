# Streamlined Student Affairs set to serve
## 
### Geoff Goldman 
From hiring resident assistants and
planning dorm activities to providing
health services, the Office of Student Af
fairs serves as an important influence in
the lives of students.
Student Affairs is the umbrella orga
nization supervising most of the opera
tions providing student services. But
with last year's University-wide budget
cuts, several of the organizations were
forced to consolidate and reduce their
services. Almost every department of
Student Affairs was forced to make
some changes because of these cuts.
The department with probably the
most pervasive effect on student life is
the Office of Residential Education,
which runs the New Student Orienta
tion program and oversees RAs and res
ident fellows. In addition, Res Ed runs
the residential computer clusters.
The clusters were originally slated to
be cut back this year. However, Res Ed
was able to obtain enough additional
funding from other University depart
ments to keep the clusters.
According to acting Res Ed director
Robin Hensley, the staff in the resi
dences are the "lifeblood of Res Ed."
While she feels the influence of Res Ed is
"more subtle" than other forms of edu
cation, she said the way the staff "live
and interact with students in the house"
creates an educational setting.

Although she said she believes most
students will not notice many changes in
the programs offered by Res Ed, Hens
ley noted reductions in two significant
areas.
First, RF discretionary program
funds were cut by 25 percent. This will
make it harder to bring outside speakers
into dorms, but it should not affect fac
ulty visits, Hensley said.
In addition, any student can still in
vite a faculty member to a meal in the
dorm and Res Ed will pick up the tab.
In the second mtgor change, Res Ed
will be less able to subsidize ticket sales
for area cultural events, Hensley said.
A department that underwent more
significant changes is the newly reorga
nized Office of Student Activities, which
program coordinator Michael Ramsey-
Perez described as a resource for student
activities on campus.
Student Activities combines the func
tions of two former offices â€” Student
Organization Services and Tresidder
Programs.
Among its many functions, Student
Activities offers non-credit recreational
classes every quarter such as dance, mu
sic, cooking and art. In addition, the of
fice helps organize outings like back
packing, whale watching, horseback rid
ing and hiking.
For those interested in planning their
own outdoor excursions, Student Activi
ties has extensive information on back

packing, camping, hiking, sight-seeing,
skiing and other activities.
Planning and sponsoring the noon
concert series on the Tresidder front pa
tio and Coffee House entertainment are
other functions of Student Activities.
The noon concert series features stu
dent and other local musicians perform
ing on Wednesdays and Fridays during
the year.
Student Activities can also be an in
valuable help in publicizing events on
campus. It supplies tables for setting up
booths in White Plaza and paper for
making banners.
The office also provides advising,
training and registration for fraterni
ties, sororities and any other campus
group.
Ramsey-Perez said he sees the office
as a way for students, particularly in
coming freshmen, to link up with the
many organizations on campus.
"One of the things that got many
freshmen into Stanford was involve
ment in extracurricular activities,"
Ramsey-Perez said. "I hope they contin
ue doing so here."
Other divisions of Student Affairs in
clude the Cowell Student Health Center,
which provides various health education
programs in addition to medical ser
vices, and the Career Planning and
Placement Center, which offers career
advising and job and internship place
ment services.
