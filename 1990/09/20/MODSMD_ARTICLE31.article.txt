# Despite budget crunch, Tresidder aims to please
##

The first few days you spend at Stan
ford are centered around your dorm. But
if you get the urge to get away without
leaving campus, Tresidder Memorial
Union is a great place to start.
As the student union, Tresidder fea
tures large seating areas both indoors
and outdoors, making it a popular place
to relax, study or simply chat away a
sunny afternoon. To complement the at
mosphere, Tresidder also puts on music
specials, comedy concerts and other pro
grams free of charge.
The Coffee House, open daily until
midnight, serves everything from sand
wiches to pastries and, of course, coffee.
It is not only a great place to study — if
you don't mind the noise — but it also
might deserve a little attention on those
occasions when you miss a meal at the
dorm.
Next door, you can get gourmet salads
and frozen yogurt during the day at Bak
er Street, pizza at the Corner Pocket and
a variety of cafeteria-style entrees at The
Caf6. "Fro yo at the CoPo" used to be a

popular phrase, but is now somewhat
pass£ since the Corner Pocket stopped
serving frozen yogurt.
Tresidder Express is a convenience
store which is open until midnight.
Quick groceries, school supplies and pre
packaged foods are available.
Tresidder's main focus this year will
be to accommodate the University-wide
budget cuts, according to Bobbi Braden,
Tresidder director. One change is
the merger of Tresidder Programs and
Student Organization Services into one
Office of Student Activities.
While Tresidder might conduct fewer
events — programs like Tea at Tresid
der, for example, could be cut — the
1990-91 school year will mainly be a trial
period to see what works under the bud
get cuts, Braden said.
Tresidder will be open until midnight,
rather than last year's closing time oflO
p.m., to give students greater use of the
facilities for study.
Due to the Oct. 17 earthquake, many
construction plans at Tresidder have
been postponed, including plans for an
enlarged Coffee House and convenience
store.
