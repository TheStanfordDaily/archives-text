# No 'Animal House' here
## Stanford's atypical Greek community 
### Tim Marklein 
With only 20 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates involved in fraternal or
ganizations, Greek life here may seem
dormant compared to USC, UCLA or
other large schools. Although you don't
have to be in a fraternity or sorority to
"be somebody" at Stanford, many opt to
join each year for a varying number of
reasons.
While Greek organizations at other
schools may "define who you are and
what your role is," fraternal affairs ad
viser Michael Ramsey-Perez says the sit
uation is completely different at Stan
ford.
"The impact on the members devel
opmentally is very great," he says, ex
plaining that Stanford's system focuses
more on the interaction between the in
dividual and the group. "People bring in
dividual things to a fraternity, and they
bring the fraternity's mission into their
lives."
Numbers are not the only difference
between Greek life at Stanford and at
the schools to the south. Because the
University mandates that no outside or
ganization can set policies for Stanford
students or groups, Stanford's fraternal

organizations are technically "indepen
dent" and can make their own policies
separate from their national organiza
tions.
Socially, the main distinction of Stan
ford's Greek system is the existence of
open campus parties. While some frater
nities have moved to limiting their par
ties to "invited guests" — getting on a
guest list usually entails a simple phone
call to the house — most parties remain
hassle-free and open to anyone with a
student ID card.
Organizationally, the main distinc
tion of Stanford's Greek system is the
predominant number of unhoused
groups. Only nine of the 17 fraternities
in the Interfraternity Council have
houses, and none of the seven Inter
sorority Council groups or five African-
American Fraternity Society groups do.
While the situation makes it difficult
to organize events and maintain "broth
erhood" or "sisterhood," unhoused
groups say advantages also exist. They
include the ability to remain in diverse
residential communities and maintain
an individual character within a tight
knit group.
Although many of the unhoused
groups have a strong presence on cam

pus, the University has stated that no
new groups will get the privileges associ
ated with a house. On a campus that
cannot yet guarantee four years of cam
pus housing, officials state that granting
housing to independent groups would be
unfair.
Although some members of Greek or
ganizations have claimed they face un
fair scrutiny on campus, Ramsey-Perez
says the groups "contribute as organiza
tions in many ways." In addition to of
fering social and cultural events on cam
pus, he says the groups are heavily in
volved in public service —- a commit
ment that often gets less press than the
negative incidents that bring disci
plinary action.
Ramsey-Perez, in his first year in
charge of fraternal affairs after several
years in the Office of Student Affairs,
says fraternities will have to take it upon
themselves to improve their image by
publicizing the positive events and pre
venting and policing the negative. Be
cause he also coordinates services for
many other student organizations,
Ramsey-Perez says he hopes fraternal
and sororal organizations will become
better integrated with the rest of cam
pus.
