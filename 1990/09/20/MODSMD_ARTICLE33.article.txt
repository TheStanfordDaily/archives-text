As party schools go, Stanford does
not rank in Playboy's annual Top 10.
Schools like Chico State, Arizona State
and the University of Wisconsin-Madi
son claim those honors.
However, this is California, so Stan
ford's social life ranks well above those
stuffy Ivy League schools in the cold
Northeast. Between campus parties,
area hangouts and multiple movies, so
cial activities should make any student
remain sane despite a myriad of books,
exams and papers.
Most of the campus' social scene fo
cuses around dorm and fraternity par
ties, which usually run Thursday
through Saturday nights and feature a

band or DJ. An occasional Wednesday or
Sunday party will throw the schedule
off, so watch for fliers in your residence
about the weekend's happenings.
Four of the most popular parties ev
ery year are Alpha Sig's Exotic Erotic,
where everyone wears more erotic than
exotic garb; Ujamaa's Club Ujamaa,
which features casino activities, great
dancing and African-American enter
tainment; Sigma Nu's Sunsplash, with
an area reggae band, wood-and-straw
huts and outdoor dancing; and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon's Jungle Party, complete
with jungle clothing, jungle vines and
sometimes jungle love.
For those who want to venture off
campus, several area bars serve as tradi
tional Stanford hangouts. Old Pro's, the

Dutch Goose and the Alpine Beer Gar
den (popularly known as Zott's) are the
most popular pool-shooting, cheap-beer
drinking "taverns." Pudley's Burger Sa
loon, the Pioneer Saloon, Stanford Pub
& Grill and the Oasis provide less rustic
alternatives.
42nd Street, Gordon Biersch and the
British Bankers Clubs are Palo Alto's
ultimate yuppie hangouts, with an up
to-35 clientele that dresses up to go out.
Compadre's may be the favorite of all,
though, with great strawberry margari
tas and free fill-up-your-own chips and
salsa.
Finally, whenever life gets dull and
homework is an utter impossibility, tak
ing in a movie always seems to suffice.
