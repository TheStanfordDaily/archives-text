# Budget repositioning, quake rebuilding and Standard revising
## News you can use: What every new student should know 
### Michael Friedly 
Stanford, never as quiet and subdued as it appears in the
"Approaching Stanford" photos, experienced events and
debates last year that charged campus discussion and often
made the national press. Read on to learn about the hap
penings that shaped 1989-90 at Stanford — and the issues
that will continue to make headlines in 1990-91.

Earthquake
aftermath
On Oct. 17,1989, the Bay Area
was rocked by an earthquake that
measured 7.1 on the Richter
Scale. The earthquake, the largest
in the area since the 1906 temblor
that devastated San Francisco,
caused $160 million in damages to
Stanford and billions more in the
Bay Area.
Centered just north of Santa
Cruz, the earthquake caused ex
tensive damage throughout the
Bay Area, including the collapse
of a section of the Bay Bridge, rag
ing fires in San Francisco's Mari
na district and the collapse of a
portion of Interstate 880 in Oak
land. In all, 66 deaths and hun
dreds of injuries were reported.
Although there were no serious
injuries at Stanford, hundreds of
students were temporarily dis
placed as student residences were
closed. Some residences, such as
Branner Hall, were closed
overnight for inspection, but four
others were knocked from their
foundations and closed for the re
mainder of the year. Displaced
students were housed in lounges
of other residences and in guest
rooms.
Three temporary modules were
quickly built to temporarily re
place academic buildings that
were closed for repairs. The mod
ules, located at Roble Field, the
Wilbur Hall parking lot and
Galvez Mall next to Meyer Li
brary, still house classrooms and
offices displaced by the earth
quake.
The extraordinary cost of the
earthquake was a factor in
the budget crunch reported later
in the year.
Budget cuts,
repositioning
In February, Provost James
Rosse announced budget cuts of
$22 million over the next 18
months. A loss of income from a
decline in government-sponsored
research projects and the tremen
dous costs of damage from the
earthquake precipitated the cuts.
In addition, limits on the in
crease of tuition costs and indirect
cost rates from University re
search have placed constraints on
the University that have forced
the budget crisis. Stanford al
ready has among the highest tu
ition and indirect cost rates of any
other university.
With Rosse as chair, a new Uni
versity committee was established
to identify areas of the University
whose budgets could be cut. The
committee wasted little time, re
vealing preliminary budget tar
gets for University departments
in April.
In line with the new emphasis

on academics rather than re
search, the cuts left most academ
ic areas untouched or with rela
tively small cuts, except for ad
ministrative areas of academic de
partments. The largest cuts came
to the Office of Student Affairs,
the Legal Office, Human Re
sources and Residential Affairs,
which must cut between 20 and
30 percent of their budgets.
The cut to Student Affairs will
be the most significant in terms of
cuts to student services. Although
final decisions on specific cuts
have yet to be made, a number of
student services may have to be
cut, including the possible re
moval of many computer clusters
in residences, the reduction in the
number of resident assistants and
the closing of the Tours campus in
France.
Campus-wide
USW layoffs
The United Stanford Workers,
labcfr* YftiWn 1, tTfat represents
more than 1,300 workers at the
University, has had its share of
successes in recent years.
In 1988, a strike threat forced
the University to negotiate a new
contract ensuring union members
adequate benefits for the next five
years. Last year, after a year of ne
gotiations, a contract was finally
signed between Webb Ranch, a
238-acre fruit and berry farm on
Stanford property, and its work
ers, who joined the USW seeking
better treatment from their em
ployers.
But now the USW may be fac
ing one of its biggest challenges —
University budget cuts.
Budget constraints have forced
the reduction of Stanford's work
force by at least 300 workers. Al
though most of these reductions
will come through the attrition of
the present work force, the USW
still faces a large number of work
ers being laid off from their jobs.
So far, the University has ap
proved 112 layoffs of Stanford
workers. The USW has strongly
protested the cuts, complaining
that Stanford should not force its
workers to pay for the administra-

a plan to cut $22 mil

felt campuswide in
coming years. At the

tion's budget crisis.
The most publicized layoffs
have been at Tresidder Memorial
Union, where the entire eight
person custodial crew has been
laid off in favor of an outside con
tract labor company.
Tresidder was at the center of a
dispute last fall when it tried to
lay off three of its workers in the
face of a $210,000 budget deficit,
but Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden reversed her decision af
ter intense public pressure.
The USW took bold action on
Aug. 30 in an attempt to bring at
tention to the layoffs. In a noon
protest rally, four USW workers
and a professor locked themselves
into the Herbert Hoover Memori
al Room in Hoover Tower and re
fused to leave.
The protesters, who included
USW steward Linda Crouse and
Tresidder custodian Ray Henson,
both of whom lost their jobs, Po
litical Science Prof. John Manley,
who has always been vocal in his
support for the union, USW field
representative Reuben Serna and
USW secretary Sammy Brooks,
were soon arrested.
The protesters chose Hoover
Tower as the site of the protest be
cause of the symbolic tie of the
Hoover Institution to the policies
of the Reagan Administration. A
number of Hoover scholars were
senior advisers to President Rea
gan, including the President's
economic adviser, Martin Ander
son, and former Secretary of State
George Shultz.
COP recall
controversy
The May election for Council of
Presidents, the body of four elect
ed representatives that heads the
executive branch of student gov
ernment, began with a battle be
tween the incumbent People's
Platform and the challenging Stu
dents First party, but ended with
a controversy over votes for Bart
Simpson and the Teenage Mutant
Nirya Turtles.
Because of the close outcome in
the general election, a difference
of only 77 votes, and the presence

of 282 write-in votes for other
candidates, including the Turtles
and Bart Simpson, neither party
received more than 50 percent of
the vote, which is required to win
the election.
Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss ruled that since the write
in votes were not for real people or
registered candidates, they should
be invalidated, which subsequent
ly gave the People's Platform
more than the required 50 per
cent and the victory.
The controversy did not sub
side, however, as a newly created
group called Students United for
Fair Elections began an attempt
to recall the People's Platform
and force a new election. After col
lecting the necessary 2,000 signa
tures on a recall petition and stag
ing a two-week sit-in the ASSU of-

A debate over whether write-in votes should
be counted in the COP election led to a sit-in
at the ASSU offices and to news reports about
the possibility of Bart Simpson becoming an
ASSU senator. The issue was resolved when .
a recall election kept the 'Four Our Future'
slate in office — just barely.

fices, SUFE finally forced a recall
election scheduled during Dead
Week.
Although news of the recall
election was overshadowed by the
appearance of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev on campus
during his U.S. tour in June, a
heavy voter turnout of 3,471 stu
dents gave the People's Platform
a no-confidence vote of 63 per
cent, just short of the two thirds
necessary to recall the COP
Because of the demonstrated
lack of confidence in the COP
elect, SUFE organizer Perry
Friedman called for the COP's
resignation as a gesture to "try to
restore the faith of the communi
ty." COP member Ingrid Nava,
however, said the COP this year
"will work hard to incorporate
many people and make them feel
represented."
Revolutionary
league
In the midst of the controversy
over the COP elections came a
parallel controversy over the in
volvement of a number of student
leaders in a nationwide organiza
tion known as the League of Rev
olutionary Struggle.
According to some Stanford
students, the League, a secretive
Marxist-Leninist organization
based in Oakland, was involved in
recruiting Stanford student lead
ers.
The controversy, which domi
nated campus politics near the
end of spring quarter, began with
The Daily's reports of secret
League activity. Much of the con
troversy surrounded charges of
McCarthyism against The Daily.

Conduct code
revisions
In an attempt to protect stu
dents of color and other minority
groups at Stanford from discrimi
natory statements and actions,
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council has proposed various ad
ditions to the Fundamental Stan
dard that would prohibit certain
forms of discriminatory speech.
Spurred on by the 1988
"Ujamaa incident," in which a
poster was defaced in a racially of
fensive manner in the black
theme house, the SCLC in March
1989 proposed a broad revision to
the Fundamental Standard that
would ban discriminatory state
ments based on "personal, cultur
al or intellectual diversity."
After intense public criticism
against the breadth of the propos
al, the SCLC went back to draw
ing board and the next month is
sued a second proposed addition.
The second proposal, known as
the Grey Proposal after its author,
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, sought to
prohibit expressions "intended to
insult or stigmatize an individual
or group of individuals" on the ba
sis of sex, race, color, religion,
handicap, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin.
A Daily poll taken in May of
this year showed that students
were divided on the Grey Propos
al, with 31.5 percent of student
saying the proposal went too far
in limiting discriminatory speech
and 37.5 saying that the proposal
was fair.
The proposal was accepted by
the SCLC in late May by a vote of
8-3 and was implemented June
11.
