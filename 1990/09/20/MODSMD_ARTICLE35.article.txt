# Groups address gender issues
## Many flavors of feminism flourish at Stanford 
### Minal Hajratwala 
The feminist community at
Stanford is extremely diverse,
both in terms of emphasis and
physical location. A wide variety
of organizations make issues of
gender relations and women's
rights a vital part of campus dis
cussion and student life.
Some of the activity occurs at
the Women's Center, located in
the Toyon Eating Clubs. This
year, a goal that both students
and University officials have been
aiming for — moving the center to
a more central location on campus
— may be fulfilled, according to
Acting Dean of Campus Affairs
Michael Jackson.
The Women's Center Collective
oversees the center's day-to-day
operation through' a process of
consensus, rather than' "majority
rule," decision-making. Each
March, the collective celebrates
Women's "Herstory" Month
through speakers, panels and cul
tural events.
Self-defense classes to empow
er women are also taught at the

center. The classes include discus
sion of issues about violence
against women, assertiveness
training, physical training and an
action project. Past projects have
included "Take Back the Night"
marches and a speak-out in White
Plaza by Stanford survivors of
sexual assault.
In addition, the Women's Cen
ter has provided support — finan
cial and moral — for groups such
as Students Against Sexism, the
Women's Guide to Stanford, and
Body Image, Food and Self-Es
teem.
Another focus of gender-relat
ed issues is Robinson House,
the year-old gender issues focus
house in Sterling Quad. The up
perclass dorm has sponsored pro
grams, speakers and poetry read
ings in an effort to integrate dis
cussion of gender issues into the
residential experience.
The Program in Feminist Stud
ies and the Institute for Research
on Women and Gender are aca
demic centers of feminist thought
and study on campus. Both are lo
cated in Serra House, across from

the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice.
Feminist Studies, an inter
departmental program, was re
cently awarded degree-granting
status. Students can now mqjor in
feminist studies, declare it as a
secondary major, complete an
honors thesis in the department
or simply choose from a wide
range of classes.
The Institute for Research
on Women and Gender cele
brated its 15th anniversary last
year and this year will be headed
by a new coordinator. Although its
primary focus is research, it also
sponsors the Jing Lyman Lecture
Series, with a different theme
each quarter, for the campus.
The Pro-Choice Alliance at
Stanford is a large and active
student organization of women
and men. Last year, it sponsored a
rally in White Plaza featuring
speakers and musical perfor
mances. In the spring, the alliance
held a benefit dance, circulated
petitions and lobbied for a student
referendum on abortion rights as
part of the ASSU elections.
