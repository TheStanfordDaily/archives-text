# Raising awareness about rape
## Students, administrators concerned over recent events

Sexual assault is pervasive at
colleges nationwide, and Stan
ford's pastoral campus is no ex
ception.
To increase awareness about
issues of assault on campus, the
University is sponsoring rape and
assault workshops during Orien
tation. The workshops, spon
sored by Residential Education,
will familiarize students with the
language used by police in catego
rizing rape and assault and will
discuss available resources.
Law enforcement authorities
have defined sexual assault as
"physical assaults of a sexual na
ture, including rape." Under the
California Penal Code, rape is
"forced sexual intercourse that is
perpetrated against the will of the
victim." Title 9, section 261 says
that rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting
by any intoxication or anesthetic
substance, or any controlled sub-

stance."
Stanford police records indi
cate that in 1988 and 1989, six as
saults were reported on campus.
But police statistics tell only
part of the story and understate
the frequency of rape and assault.
In 1988, a survey of 1,190 stu
dents conducted by the Stanford
Rape Education Project revealed
that 37 percent of women and 12
percent of men were forced into
intercourse. Of those, 98 percent
of the women and 94 percent of
the men knew their assailant.
Recent incidents on campus
have served as a clear reminder
that crime can come from off-cam
pus as well. A June 16 rape in the
Foothills became the first rape to

be reported since 1983. The at
tacker, a former employee at a
Palo Alto dance club, was later
linked to three other attempted
assaults in the Foothills, stretch
ing back to July 1989.
Police point out that feelings of
guilt, violation and fear of reprised
by the offender exacerbate the
problem of bringing the perpetra
tors of assault to justice. Campus
organizations like Project HEAR
(Heightened Education on Ac
quaintance Rape) and the Rape
Education Project provide a wide
array of services to help these vic
tims during the school year.
Project HEAR presents hour
long workshops to dorms to eluci
date the issues surrounding ac
quaintance rape. It also
distributes cards campuswide
that provide information about
what to do if one is raped. The
Rape Education Project provides
similar services and distributes
questionnaires for survey purpos
es.
