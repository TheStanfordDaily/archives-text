# Peer, professional counselors act to aid students in distress
## 
### Caitlin Liu 
Being at a new school can be an
emotionally overwhelming experi
ence.
Suddenly, you discover that the
quarter system fills your calendar
with midterms. You feel like you
and your roommate come from
different planets, and your phone
bill skyrockets because you miss
your family and friends so much.
Lonely and depressed, you yearn
for someone to whom you can talk
and air your feelings.
Many Stanford students take
their problems to the Bridge,
which offers peer-counseling ser
vices on a walk-in or phone-in ba
sis. As you ride your bike or drive
along Campus Drive East, look for
a white house nestled between
trees just down the street from
the Stem Hall parking lot.
"There are five people living
here at all times," said senior Dan
Rosenberg, a live-in counselor. In
addition, there are some part-time
counselors.
The diversity of the staff en
ables students to talk to someone
with whom they can identify. Stu

dents can specifically request ei
ther a male or a female counselor.
The Bridge also has counselors
from minority communities and
the gay, lesbian and bisexual com
munity.
Counselors at the Bridge have
helped students cope with a wide
range of student problems. Com
mon themes include loneliness,
fear of failing and "coming-out"
issues, said live-in Elaine Miller.
Once in a while the Bridge also re
ceives suicide calls, she said.
But people do call with simple
everyday problems, Miller said.
"Sometimes people just call be
cause they've had a cruddy day,"
she said.
Rosenberg adds, "We can get
someone who's a little stressed
out because they got a C on their
bio exam."
Students who work at the
Bridge are not professionals. They
see their job as listening to people,
not giving advice. Both Miller and
Rosenberg emphasized that all
the Bridge's counseling is strictly
confidential.
Besides counseling, the Bridge
acts as a referral service for other

organizations. Support groups
such as Body-Image, Food and
Self-Esteem; the Coming Out Rap
Group and Alcoholics Anonymous
also use the Bridge's facilities for
their meetings.
If you are looking for profes
sional help, the place to begin is
Counseling and Psychological
Services (known as CAPS). Here
you'll find professionals of all ages
and backgrounds willing to help
you get through a rough spot.
The emphasis at CAPS is not
on long-term therapy. The aver
age student uses CAPS only three
or four times, free of charge. But
the people at CAPS will refer you
to someone else in the Stanford
area if you need a longer counsel
ing program.
In the past, CAPS has helped
students deal with a variety of
problems, including anxiety and
depression, relationship issues,
low self-esteem, procrastination
and sexual issues. CAPS also of
fers group sessions on topics such
as women's issues, sexual
identity, couples communication
and eating disorders.
