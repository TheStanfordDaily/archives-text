# Rodin's sculptures grace the outdoors

For those seeking refuge
from the chaos of Orientation
week, the Rodin Sculpture
Garden may be just the ticket.
The garden evokes twinges
of nostalgia in anyone who has
visited the gardens of Europe
and gives license to dream to
j anyone who has not.
The classical architecture of
Stanford's Museum of Art, set
amid indigenous palm, oak,
bougainvillea and Mediter
ranean cypress, provides the
backdrop for the world's sec
ond largest collection of origi
bronze casts by Auguste
Neither fences nor admis
sion fees impede the public
from enjoying the one-acre gar
den, dedicated in 1085. The
sculptures were cast in limited
editions by Rodin's heir, tlie
French government.
B. Oerald Cantor, a financial
adviser to the University, do
nated 88 sculptures to Stan
ford in 1974 and has doubled
the number since then, said Al
bert Elsen, professor of art his
toiy and curator of the Rodin
collection.
Cantor wanted both Stan
ford students and the public to
enjoy Rodin's work. Guided
weekly tours of the sculpture

garden are available.
Located on the northeast
corner of Roth Way and Lomita
Drive, the Rodin Sculpture
Garden is really an extension of
the Art Museum, "We wanted a
design that looked integrated
\ with the 1890s museum build
ing and was inspired by the
French gardens where Rodin
exhibited his public art," Elsen
said.
A stroll through the garden
is an education in Rodin's
artistic philosophy and tech
nique. He wanted to preserve
the spontaneity of the prelimi
nary studies that preceded the
final bronze castings, which
tended to become static. iHe
modeled every profile of a fig
ure, rather than approaching it
only from the front and sides.
And he tried to capture the
essence of a person, rather
than his or her superficial ap
pearance. s
"The resemblance which
[thcr artist] ought to obtain is
that of the soul," Rodin said,
according to the Rodin Journal
published by the Art Museum.
"That alone matters; it is that
which the sculptor or painter
should seek beneath the mask
of features."
The soul of Rodin himself is
present among these sculp
tures.
