# Academic advising aids aimless students
## 
### Caitlin Liu 
For new students at Stanford,
getting oriented and organizing
life at the Farm can be dizzying —
so much to unpack, so many peo
ple to meet. You wait in long lines
everywhere, and you feel helpless
without a campus map.
But just as soon as you've put
the last pair of shoes in the closet,
made friends and learned how to
go anywhere on campus using
Hoover Tower as a guide, classes
begin. A whole new list of con
cerns begins running through
your mind at night like sheep
jumping over a fence:
What classes should I take?
When should I start thinking
about getting a summer job?
What if I can't keep up with my
classes? How do I know what I
want to do in life?
Am I in this alone, or are there
people and resources out there to
answer my questions and help me
sort things out?

Well, lose sleep no more, be
cause you are definitely not alone.
A variety of campus resources are
available to help you organize
your academic schedule and guide
you in planning your future. All it
takes is a little initiative to seek
out and take advantage of these
resources.
Your freshman adviser
should be the first stop on your
quest for guidance, and most ad
visers meet with their advisees
during Orientation. But don't
stop there — there are many oth
er resources just a phone call or
short walk away.
For advice on what classes to
take or some inside information
on who the best (or the worst)
professors are, one of the best ref
erences on Stanford academic life
is right under your nose in your
dorm — your AA (advising associ
ate).
As upperclass students, AAs
have already gone through a lot of
what you are about to experience.

They understand how academical
ly overwhelming Stanford can be
for someone brand-new to college
life. So don't be shy in approach
ing your AA if you have any ques
tions or problems.
Your AA is your personal peer
counselor and guide and has tak
en many workshops before your
arrival specifically to help you bet
ter adjust to the rigors of academ
ic life at Stanford. Seek out the
AAs for student-to-student advice
and help in putting your academic
career into perspective.
If you can already identify po
tential academic needs, Sweet
Hall, located between Meyer Li
brary and Stern Hall, is the place
that will provide them. There you
will find the Center for Teach
ing and Learning, where you
can get help in sharpening your
study skills and improving your
reading rates. The center also of
fers free peer tutoring in a variety
of subjects, such as calculus, for
eign languages and chemistry.

While at Sweet Hall, you might
stop by the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center. Staff advisers can
answer questions about course
and m£gor selection, preparing for
an academic career, graduate
school, individually designed ma
jors and some scholarships.
For career counseling and job
opportunity information, head on
over to the Career Planning
and Placement Center. The
CPPC offers numerous services to
assist you in planning your career
and exploring work options.
