# Options abound for those bored all around

Does the prospect of taking calculus bore
you? CIV make you yawn with excitement? Did
you ever wish you could take a course that was
relevant to your life?
Stanford has many unusual opportunities
to cure even the most acute case of academic
disillusionment, or just sheer boredom.
First, there are Innovative Academic Cours
es. If you've ever thought you would learn bet
ter from a fellow student or had a great idea for
a course, lAC could be for you. Under the pro
gram, students and faculty come up with new
and interesting course ideas, which can take
four forms.
Freshperson-Sophomore Seminars are
small, often dorm-based courses on topics not
usually addressed at an introductory level.
They are taught by specialists from the Uni
versity's graduate and professional schools.
Stanford Workshops on Political and Social

Issues (SWOPSI) are taught by students, fac
ulty, staff or community members and address
contemporary issues.
Past offerings have included a course on an
archy, the fined product of which was a large
mural which still hangs on a wall near the
Tresidder back patio; a study of cooperative
living at Stanford taught by co-op residents;
and a course on the Iran-contra scandal.
The Program for Research and Innovation
in Multicultural Education encourages stu
dents to work with faculty to integrate multi
cultural materials into courses by providing re
sources and funding.
Finally, lAC sponsors Undergraduate Spe
cial Courses. Similar to SWOPSI, these involve
unusual or multidisciplinary methods and sub
ject matter.
If you want to do something academic but
somewhat independent, you might try Under
graduate Research Opportunities. URO can
match students to faculty research projects,

and the program offers grants — up to $2,500
— for independent research projects.
Another possibility if you crave interesting
academic options is Overseas Studies. Stan
ford has centers in Berlin, Florence, Krakow,
Kyoto, Oxford, Paris, Salamanca, Santiago and
Tours. Not all programs require knowledge of
a foreign language, and tuition and room and
board fees are the same as for regular academic
quarters.
Each overseas site draws on its country's
strengths to offer different types of courses.
For example, the Stanford Center for Technol
ogy and Innovation is located in Kyoto, while
the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies
is Rome-based.
If you want to travel, but not too far, Stan
ford also has a campus in Washington, D.C.
Academics — tutorials led by experts and
group public policy seminars — are combined
with practical experience in the form of an in
ternship in the nation's capital.
