Incoming students face a plethora of banking
options, and the various choices can be hard to
sort out. But before you decide just to stick with
your piggy bank, take a look at the three banking
services that have a branch or automatic teller
machine at Stanford.
The Stanford Federal Credit Union is a
popular option for many students. The credit
union has an office on the corner of Serra Street
and Pampas Lane, as well as an ATM on the sec
ond floor of Tresidder Union.
Students who deposit at least $50 in a savings
account become members of the credit union. Un
like a bank, the credit union's dividend rate is
variable, based on the credit union earnings. The
stated anticipated rate is 5.25 percent.
One popular option for students is Checking
with Dividends, which requires a $500 balance in
order to avoid a $4 monthly fee and to earn inter
est. The dividend rate may vary, but it is antici
pated at 5 percent.
This account starts earning interest at a lower
balance than those required by the other on-cam
pus banks, and the fee for a lower balance is
smaller. The drawback is that the access to ATMs
is more limited.
The credit union also offers a Money Manage
ment account that requires a $1,500 minimum
balance and has a limit of three free checks per
month.
Bank of America also has an ATM machine

at Tresidder, as well as a branch office located in
the Stanford Shopping Center next to Neiman-
Marcus. Its four accounts are: Alpha Checking,
Custom Flat Fee Checking, Custom Choice
Checking and Limited Checking.
The Custom Choice Checking option has the
lowest monthly service charge of the four ac
counts — $3.00 — and requires a minimum open
ing deposit of $100. It requires a minimum bal
ance of $500 to avoid monthly service charges.
The other three options have higher monthly
service charges, but differ in per-item charges,
ATM charges and minimum opening deposit.
Wells Fargo Bank has the convenience of an
on-campus branch office at Tresidder Union as
well as an ATM machine there.
One of Wells Far go's accounts, known as Stage
coach Checking, requires a $750 minimum daily
balance with no monthly service charges, though
it yields no interest.
Wells Fargo also offers accounts known as
Stagecoach Interest Checking and ATM Check
ing.
