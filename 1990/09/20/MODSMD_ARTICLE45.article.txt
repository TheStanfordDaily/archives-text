# Prevent and cure: Cowell Health Center's dual purpose
## 
### David Bianco 
This week, hundreds of stu
dents are leaving the protective
care of their parents. Although
the staff at Cowell Student Health
Center won't tuck them in at
night, they will provide health ed
ucation and care.
Dr. Harvey Weinstein, director
of Cowell, said the center takes a
two-pronged approach to student
health: preventive education and

illness and injury care.
In the area of education and
sickness prevention, Cowell runs
what it calls the Health Promo
tion Program.
"There are a lot of students in
volved in peer education, about
200 at any one time," Weinstein
said. The five mayor areas of at
tention for the Health Promotion
Program are substance and alco
hol abuse and use, nutrition and
eating disorders, AIDS preven

tion, stress management and con
traceptive counseling. Cowell ar
ranges for students to speak in
dorms about these health con
cerns.
Another part of Cowell's
Health Promotion Program cen
ters on fitness and exercise, aimed
at the graduate student popula
tion. The program, which Wein
stein called "unique in the coun
try," services about 2,000 stu
dents each year and focuses on in
jury prevention as well as exer
cise.
A major vehicle for getting
Cowell's health message across is
"The Student Body," a quarterly
insert to The Daily that has been
appearing for about 10 years. The

first issue of "The Student Body"
this year will focus on substance
use.
Cowell also offers a host of ser
vices for students who are sick or
injured. The 55 doctors, nurses
and other health-care providers at
Cowell provide primary care for
students with problems ranging
from skin problems to unwanted
pregnancies.
According to Weinstein, the
majority of cases seen by Cowell
are upper respiratory problems,
but students also come with con
cerns related to sexually transmit
ted diseases, injuries, gastroin
testinal diseases and AIDS.
A student who has a health
concern during the day can call or

come to the center, which is locat
ed across Campus Drive from
Wilbur Hall. In the newly remod
eled Urgent Care Facility, stu
dents receive emergency assis
tance on a first-come, first-served
basis. Students are encouraged to
make an appointment, however.
"I encourage students to find a
doctor and stay with that doctor,"
We instein said.
The Urgent Care Facility is
open from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. on
weekdays and for an extra hour in
the morning on weekends. The in
firmary has been closed this year,
and students will be referred to
Stanford Hospital.
Routine primary care and re
ferral at Cowell are offered as a

part of a student's tuition, al
though routine physical examina
tions, immunizations and allergy
shots are offered on a fee schedule
posted in the Cowell lobby.
One new service at Cowell this
year is a pharmacy, targeted to
open in November, which Wein
stein called a "direct result of stu
dent requests."
Another change this year is
that care will be offered on a fee
for-service basis for domestic
partners of gay and lesbian stu
dents.
Weinstein said the care at Cow
ell is of "extremely high quality"
but pointed out that student com
plaints are followed up carefully.
