# New and improved Bookstore aims to be biggest, best
## 
### David Bianco 
Stanford has found another
way to beat Cal "by the books" —
185,000 books, that is.
A series of renovations at the
Stanford Bookstore, including in
creasing the book selection from
135,000 titles to at least 225,000
titles, is expected to make it the
largest college bookstore in the
country.
According to Ken Shark, man
ager of retail services for the
Bookstore, the expansion will
open two new floors of retail space
in the basement of the store. The
downstairs area was a warehouse,
but the Bookstore has since
moved its warehouse operation
across the Bay to Newark.
"That hole was already there,"
Shark said. "It was just a big ma
jor basement."
The lower levels will house the
Microdisc computer area as well
as textbooks. The textbook sec
tion of the lower level was set to
open earlier this week.
Non-book merchandise, such
as clothing and souvenirs, will be
moved upstairs to where text
books used to be. That area will

also house office space Shark
said.
Another change will take
place in the north side of the up
per level, where technical books
are currently shelved. An expand
ed candy counter with tables will
serve students' social as well as
gastronomic needs.
"It will be a place where you
can sit down, browse through a
book, drink a cup of cappuccino,
that sort of thing," Shark said.
Another addition to the Book
store will be a magazine and peri
odical section with academic peri
odicals and newspapers from
around the world.
Aside from the physical
changes at the Bookstore, the ad
dition of nearly 100,000 titles will
change the selection significantly.
Other college bookstores in Cali
fornia have only a fraction of the
book titles the Stanford Book
store will carry. USC's bookstore
has approximately 100,000 titles,
UCLA carries 75,000, and UC-
Berkeley carries only 40,000.
Because the "fall rush" is the
busiest time for the Bookstore,
Shark urged students to avoid the
peak times between 10 a.m. and 3
p.m.
