# From clubs to concerts, City was built on rock and roll

The Grateful Dead. Jefferson
Airplane. Santana. Neil Young.
Huey Lewis and the News. The
Tubes.
All these acts got their start in
the Bay Area, which served as the
birthplace of the 1960s music cul
ture but didn't stop there. If mu
sic is your cup of tea, the Bay Area
is where you want to be.
Between concerts, clubs, al
bums and transportation, you
may find yourself spending more
than you should on musical enter
tainment. Soon, however, your
roommate's music (and singing)
will drive you to pay any price to
escape.
Let's face it, though, you're a
freshman, you have no money,
and soon you'll have less than no
money. So, go ahead. Spend it on
the music you love.
Very close to home, Tresidder
Union often features free, live
acts on the back patio at
lunchtime or in the Coffee House.
These acts range from fully com
plemented reggae ensembles to
solo guitar performances. In addi
tion, these acts play a diverse
sampling of musical styles from
across the country. Concerts are
sometimes held in White Plaza as
well.
Every year, the Concert Net
work sponsors several shows on
campus, which last year included
the Indigo Girls, the Untouch

ables and Miles Davis.
Parties on campus with either
live music or disc jockeys abound
every week except the dreaded
Dead Week and finals week. Sev
eral campus bands organize and
re-organize each year, so find your
favorite band and become a
groupie. You'll at least be able to
meet the band members.
If you are considering going to
a club, do a little comparison
shopping first. Check local listings
or make some calls to determine
whether the music matches your
taste and that you can be admit
ted to the club you want.
East Palo Alto is the place to
find most of the clubs featuring
live music or dancing. Reggae,
African, and Brazilian music is
the name of the game at Club
Afrique and Pefia Moai, but be
prepared to pay between $4 and
$6. The Collins Club in East
Palo Alto is another possibility,
but explore it to find out if the
music, and atmosphere, suits
your mood.
The most popular club in Palo
Alto is The Edge on California
Avenue. "Modern rock dancing"
music is what you get at The
Edge, as well as a variety of
maybe-up-and-coming live acts.
Cover charges vary depending on
the night, so call ahead to find out
which night suits your taste (and
wallet) best.
The smart money is spent in
San Francisco, which offers a
wider selection of clubs and more

asthetically pleasing surround
ings. Of course, it's just as expen
sive and probably requires a car,
but those are minor obstacles be
tween you and a good time.
As far as cover price, music,
drinks and environment, The
Palladium is the City's version
of The Edge. With modern rock
dancing on Friday nights and an
assortment of hip-hop and urban
funk on weekends, The Palladium
should suit anyone who wants to
dance until 6 a.m.
Other San Francisco clubs of
fer a variety of entertaining op
tions, which are listed weekly in
the pink section of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle or the Weekend
section of the San Jose Mercury
News.
If you have money (which you
don't) and a car or some idea of
the Bay Area's transit system, you
can attend a number of headline
concerts, all within an hour's
drive in any direction.
The Shoreline Amphithe
ater in Mountain View is the clos
est to Stanford and a very popular
venue with top performers. Nota
bles like Eric Clapton, Tom Petty
and the Heartbreakers, Bruce
Springsteen, Ringo Starr and
Steve Winwood have played the
Shoreline. Because it is owned by
Bay Area concert mogul Bill Gra
ham, it attracts the biggest names
and features state-of-the-art facil
ities.
The park is comprised of re
served and lawn seating. Large

Arabian tents cover the stage, and
reserved sections and video
screens improve the view of the
general admission section on the
lawn. Simply take Highway 101
south to Shoreline Boulevard and
follow the signs to the amphithe

ater.
The historic Greek Theater
in Berkeley, a 1902 gift of William
Randolph Hearst, is another fine
site for concert viewing. Designed
with the stone bleachers of a sth
century B.C. Athenian theater,

this venue features lawn seating
(avoid it if you can) and an elegant
backdrop. If you have a day to
spend, a concert here can be com
bined with an exciting tour of the

sights and sounds of Berkeley.
Oakland is becoming the new
hot spot for top acts. The Henry
J. Kaiser Pavilion may look like
a high school gym, but it houses
some of the best concerts in the
Bay Area, including R.E.M. and
Keith Richards.
The Oakland Coliseum has
replaced San Francisco's Candle
stick Park (which hosted a 1981
appearance by the Rolling Stones
and the Beatles' last American
concert in 1966) as the choice of
the huge rock tours.
San Francisco'B main concert
venues include the Warfield,
the Fillmore and the Cow
Palace. Other area venues in
clude the Circle Star Theater
in Cupertino (15 minutes south
on Highway 280), the Concord
Pavilion in the East Bay and
even the Opera House in San
Francisco.
