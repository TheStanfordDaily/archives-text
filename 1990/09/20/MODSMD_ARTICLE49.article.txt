# Music on a budget
## Area stores have all sounds 
### Tim Marklein 
Compact discs, LPs, cassettes or 12-inch
records. Modern rock, blues, a capella, jazz
or heavy metal. New or used.
Buying an album is not as easy as it
sounds, especially in the option-laden Bay
Area. The discerning music lover has a vari
ety of merchants to choose from, all offering
different wares at different prices.
So where do you go to avoid the compact
disc at a not-so-compact price or find the
precious import available nowhere else?
The following notes on local audio outlets
should provide helpful tips for making your
way through the Peninsula's music maze.
TOWER RECORDS
630 San Antonio Road
Mountain View
The biggest can sometimes be the best,
and Tower Records proved it.
Tower boasts the best selection in the
Stanford area, stocking a plentiful supply of
rock, pop, jazz, new age, blues, rap and
country. Anything released within the past
five years should be easy to find on the Tow
er shelves, including a large group of import
discs. Older albums may be more sparse, es
pecially if the artist never saw the light of
Top 100.
Prices range considerably, from $5 to $10
for records and cassettes and from $8 to $15
for CDs. Tower also usually has a large se
lection of discount discs, along with an ex
pansive stock of CD singles and 12-inch
records.
Keep an eye out for Tower's "No Risk
Disc" deals, where you can buy certain al
bums with the option to exchange them if

they do not satisfy. Check the store's Pulse
magazine at the front of the store to see
which discs are covered and what new re
leases are available.
RAINBOW RECORDS
447 University Ave.
Palo Alto
Following the Rainbow will often lead to
a plethora of bargain-line CDs by la
bels, but don't expect a new CD to cost less
than $14.95.
Rainbow's selection of bargain-line discs
will sell for $7.99 to $10.99, so bargain
hunters will make Rainbow a regular stop.
Similar deals are available on cassettes,
which usually sell for $8.99. Rainbow does
not carry records.
WHEREHOUSE RECORDS
700 El Camlno Real
Menlo Park
Don't put too much faith in this store's
name, since they don't actually sell records.
Pretend it's called Wherehouse Cassettes
and Compact Discs, and you should stay
happy.
Normal prices at the Wherehouse equal
those at Rainbow, but the bargain sales are
more scarce. Check newspaper ads for low
prices on new releases, which Wherehouse
usually has before the other stores.
Wherehouse also promotes discs without
risk, so watch for the few weekly selections.
RECORD HEAVEN
3779 El Camlno Real
Palo Alto
If you're looking to save a few
bucks and don't mind used equip
ment, Record Heaven boasts a
formidable stock of used albums.
With thousands of records and
hundreds of cassettes and com
pact discs, this outlet should have
any album you want.
CD WORLD
477 University Ave.
Palo Alto
Expected to open by the begin
ning of October, this compact disc
warehouse will store thousands of
new and used CDs. A planned lis
tening room is an additional fea
ture that should make this a
mandatory stop for CD buyers.
