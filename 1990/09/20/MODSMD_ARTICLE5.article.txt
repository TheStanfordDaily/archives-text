# Fresh faces with an array of different experiences
## Class of 1994: diverse and distinctive 
### Mary Sprague 
Students who were at the top of their
classes academically and extracurricularly
will discover this week they are in good com
pany at Stanford.
The incoming class, which includes 1,600
freshmen and 129 transfer students, was se
lected from a "very impressive" applicant
pool, said William Tingley, associate dean of
admissions.
Sixty-two percent of the applicants were
in the top 10 percent of their graduating
classes and 19 percent had combined SATs of
1400 or higher, Tingley said.
In the end, Stanford offered admission to
22 percent of 12,953 hopefuls.
"This is the 100 th freshman class which .
.. makes it a unique class and historically
significant," Tingley said.
The class is "very ethnically diverse," with
one of the largest number of minority stu
dents Stanford has admitted, he said. The
class is 6.3 percent black, 9.9 percent Chi
cano/Latino, 24.1 percent Asian-American
and 1 percent Native American. Incoming
students from foreign countries compose 3
percent of the class.

state and 91 countries last year, Tingley said.
California, the state with the largest repre
sentation, makes up 39 percent of the Class
of *94. Texas, New York, Washington and
Illinois are the next biggest contributors.
The freshmen are many of the "most ac
tive students" from 4,000 different high
schools, Tingley said.
Many of the incoming freshmen were in
volved in traditional activities such as stu
dent leadership, music groups and sports
teams, Tingley said. Others participated in
public service, volunteer work and academic
pursuits outside the classroom, such as writ
ing and research.
The admissions staff paid close attention

to the applicants' personal achievements
outside the classroom because they wanted
students who would help make Stanford "an
interesting, exciting place to be," Tingley
said.
Admission to Stanford's transfer class is
also very selective, he added. More than two
thirds of the applicants had college grade
point averages of 3.6 to 4.0. Only 14 percent
of the 1,171 applicants were accepted.
According to Tingley, students choose to
transfer to Stanford for many reasons. Some
want a broader experience than their small
liberal arts or technical-focused schools of
fered. Others are attracted to the overseas
programs, while some want a "more diverse
student body," Tingley said.
Thirty-seven percent of the transfers are
from California — followed by Florida, New
York, Texas, Arizona and Michigan.
Tingley said he was pleased Stanford con
tinues "to be in competition with other out
standing institutions, such as Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and MIT."
After months of selection, the admissions
staff especially enjoys the first week students
are on campus. "It's always an exciting time
for us because we get to see the fruit of our
labor," Tingley said. Seeing the new students
"re-energizes us to begin again."
