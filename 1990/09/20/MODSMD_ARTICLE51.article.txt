# Multiplexes & single screens: More movie houses than movies
## 
### Sunil Perkash 
Stanford's surrounding area
boasts venues for just about any
kind of movie — mainstream
blockbusters, classics, avant
garde and foreign films.
To see the latest releases, the
best bet would be Century 10, lo
cated on Shoreline Boulevard off
Highway 101, about 10 tols min
utes from campus by car.
Not only does it have comfort
able rocking seats and the most
modern technical equipment, the
theater recently added a cafe to its
huge lobby, complete with quaint
little tables and chairs. Now, aside
from the usual popcorn and hot
dogs before the movie, you can
also ei\joy a cafe latt6 and gourmet
pastry — talk about catering to
yuppies — as well as a Stanford
staple, frozen yogurt.
The newest multiplex in the
area is Century 12, located in
Redwood City on East Bayshore
Road. Equipped with state-of-the
art sound and projection systems,
this theater is about 15 to 20 min
utes north of campus by car, a
worthwhile drive to experience
the latest technology in film view
ing.
The seats here are comfortable,
and they have funky cup-holder
arm rests. This is one of the few
theaters accepting Visa and Mas
tercard.
The other major multi-screen
theater within reasonable driving

distance from campus is the Old
Mill 6, located on San Antonio
Road, about a 10-minute drive
from campus. This complex is
much older than the aforemen
tioned and has smaller theaters
with smaller screens.
A bonus feature this year at the
Old Mill 6 is a Warner Brothers
cartoon before each movie, in cele
bration of Bugs Bunny's 50th an
niversary. So if you're in the mood
for Foghorn Leghorn or P6pe Le
Peu with your movie, check out
the Old Mill 6.
There's also a handful of even
smaller movie houses in Palo Alto
that show only one or two films at
a time, no more than 10 minutes
away from campus.
The most popular for Stanford
students would have to be Palo
Alto Square, located at El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road.
Its continued success in the face of
multiplex cinemas may be at
tributed to the fact that it still of
fers first-run, high-demand films,
so there is really no reason to ven
ture further if the movie you want

The area's movie houses have it all — from
one screen to 12, from first-run hits to foreign
films, from rock-solid seats to cushy rocking
chairs with funky beverage holders. Some
thing for everyone.

to see is playing there.
One of the greatest gems to hit
Pelo Alto recently is the Stanford
Theater, located on University
Avenue. The recently refurbished
picture palace offers short runs of
classic films on the big screen,
ranging from the mega-successful
"Gone With the Wind" to such all
time favorites as "Casablanca,"
which will be showing at the end
of September.
Although most films shown are
available on videocassette, seeing
the oldies as they were meant to
be shown, on a big screen with
stereo sound, is a breathtaking ex
perience.
The Park and the Guild, both
located on El Camino in Menlo
Park, are single-screen theaters
that show a variety of different
movies. Sometimes they might
show a film in first run, but they
also pick up blockbusters in their
later day. These theaters also
sometime play more artsy films,
like "The Cook, the Thief, His
Wife and Her Lover."
The same holds true for the

Varsity, located on University
Avenue, showing classics, foreign,
avant-garde and even first-run
features, but usually not big hits.
Fans of the Rocky Horror Picture
Show will be happy to know they
only have to carry their rice and

toast down University Ave. to find
their favorite cult classic.
The Aquarius, located on
Emerson Street off University,
seems to specialize in foreign films
— "Cinema Paradiso" played for
most of the summer. A word of

caution — the seats are very hard
and do not rock, and there is little
leg room. When viewing some for
eign films, between trying to read
the subtitles and trying to get
comfortable, the experience can be
trying.
