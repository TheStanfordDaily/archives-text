# Flicks tradition stymies Sunday studies
## 
### Lara Filson 
It's Sunday night after a raging weekend,
where homework took a back seat to other ac
tivities. Now, it's time to get down to business.
But wait! One of Stanford's oldest tradi
tions arrives just in the nick of time to save
students from the doldrums of studying for
just a couple of hours more.
Since 1937, Flicks have offered the Stanford
community another excuse to put off school
work. Two showings of recent hit films, Sun
day at 7 and 9:30 p.m., usually bring students
crowding to Memorial Auditorium.
According to Bob Florsheim, this year's
Flicks manager, some of the "good movies"
planned for fall quarter include "Dick Tracy,"
"Total Recall," "The Freshman" and that ever
popular classic, "Star Wars."
Students can buy a pass good for admission
to all the movies during the quarter for $15
from the Flicks office or $14 if bought with a
dorm. Individual tickets are $2.50.
"It is best to have a pass because you are
guaranteed a seat," Florsheim said. The 9:30
show often sells out for blockbuster films. The
first Flick, "Pretty Woman," will show Oct. 7.

For the new students who have not experi
enced this tradition and might still be relying
on high school habits of working Sunday
nights to finish their work, Florsheim sug
gests: "They should live through it and then
make up their minds."
Another hint to frosh: This is not a date.
Students usually go with dormmates in large
numbers. The inside atmosphere is not all that
romantic, anyway. With paper fights going on
from the time people begin to sit down to well
after the lights go out and the short has start
ed, intimacy is not part of the bill.
For the roommate who has frustrated you
all week, the paper fight offers a harmless way
to get out some pent-up aggression.
Environmentalists need not worry, either —
Florsheim is working with the Recycling Cen
ter to have the paper picked up from the floor
and recycled after each show.
The composition of the usual Flicks crowd is
heavily freshmen, with die-hard Flicks fans as
well. For those consistent procrastinators, the
good news is that the University has installed
a new sound system in Mem Aud which will be
ready for the first show.
