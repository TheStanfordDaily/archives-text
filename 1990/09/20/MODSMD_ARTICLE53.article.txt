# Broad-ranging Lively Arts brings culture to campus
## 
### Janine DeFao 
There s more to "culture" than just Cultures,
Ideas and Values. But San Francisco is just too far
for many students to go for weekly music, theater
and dance.
Luckily, you can become a well-rounded Stanford
student without ever leaving campus — with the
help of The Lively Arts at Stanford.
From classical chamber music to avant-garde
dance, Lively Arts is "dedicated to the ongoing cre
ation of performing arts, to the preservation of. the
classics and to the expression of ethnic and cultural
diversity," according to its organizers.
This year, the people who brought to campus acts
ranging from the Grammy-winning a cappella ex
travaganza Take 6 to renowned political satirist
Mark Russell will present 34 performances by artists
from around the globe.
Modern dance, children's theater, chamber music,
dramatic monologue — even a command perfor
mance of the San Francisco Symphony at Davies
Hall celebrating Stanford's Centennial — pack this
year's calendar.
Students can get half-priced tickets, subsidized by
the Office of Residential Education, for almost all
events.
"This is a centennial season so we're really trying
to celebrate," said Lois Wagner, director of the pro
gram. "We've made great efforts to have an exciting
season."
Lively Arts will kick off the year with two free per
formances of "Shakespeare in the Park" on Oct. 6
and 7. The San Francisco Shakespeare Festival will
present "Richard III" in Frost Amphitheater at 2:30
p.m.
The first evening event will feature international
ly acclaimed soprano Leontyne Price, whose voice
was heralded as "one of the world's most thrilling
musical instruments" by the Chicago Tribune.
Price is joined in the recital series by pianists, cel
lists, lutenists and others.
Although Lively Arts has scheduled fewer perfor
mances than last year, its organizers promise an ex
citing year.
The Wide Horizons series will feature seven mu
sic, dance and performance groups from a wide array
of cultures. "There has been a growing effort to bring
in as many cultures as we can," Wagner said.
Africa Oy6 — 47 singers and dancers from Zaire,
Niger, Mali and Guinea — is a "big, colorful must
see," Wagner said. Members of native tribes intro
duce the audience to their culture through song,
dance, acrobatics, elaborate costumes, history and

much more.
Two tons of ringing bells are at the center of a
journey back to the Chinese Imperial Court of 2,400
years ago in"The Imperial Bells of China."
And Dance Brazil combines African rhythms,
Latin American acrobatics and martial arts in an
athletic, exuberant performance.
On a different note, no less than 11 ensembles will
fill evenings with timeless chamber music. The
Emerson String Quartet, winners of a Grammy for
best classical album, will return to Stanford after a
fantastic reception last year.
The Stanford University Centennial Concert giv
en by the San Francisco Symphony in December is
an event Wagner said she "hopes all the students will
get excited about." Special discount tickets will be
available to students for $15.
For those with more of an eye for dance than an

ear for music, Lively Arts presents styles from 18th
century baroque to the cutting edge of 21st century
modern.
David Parsons, Bill T. Jones and Melissa Fenley
will perform in "An Evening of Solos," a one-time
only event. Parsons, who is known for his combina
tion of dance and lighting effects, dazzles audiences
with segments in which he appears to float across the
stage. Jones is said to sculpt personal experience into
movement. And Fenley has been called "unmatched
for her explosive, even primal energy" by The New
York Times.
Lively Arts will present many more exciting and
innovative events this year. Tickets for all events are
sold at the beginning of the year, and those interest
ed are advised to place their orders soon — some
shows are sure to be sellouts.
