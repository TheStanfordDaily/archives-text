The Stanford Daily is seeking Stanford students to be
writers, photographers, graphic artists and proofreaders
for one of the longest-running shows on campus.
There are no auditions, and little stage fright is involved.
You don't even need any experience — we'll teach you
what you need to know. Best of all, everyone gets a part.
To join the cast of Stanford's independent student
newspaper, come by the Storke Publications Building for
an orientation meeting: Monday, Sept. 24 at noon or
Thursday, Sept. 27 at 1 p.m. If you can't wait that long,
come by today and talk with the editors — we'll put you to
work.
