# Turkey surprise not good enough?

When I was a freshman, I one night entered
the dining room at Wilbur Hall to find the
night's dinner to be chicken chalupa. While
some might find this dish to be a culinary tour
de force, I decided to head into Palo Alto and
have a real dinner.
Because this desire to eat away from the
dorm just might hit you more than a few times
a year, the following is a short sample of some
of the more salient restaurants frequented by
Stanford students.
Because dorm food can be quite bland, you
can always add a nice amount of spice to your
meal by eating at Jing-Jing, an inexpensive
Chinese restaurant within biking distance
from campus.
The menu includes a wide range of vegetar
ian specialties along with traditional Chinese
favorites. Jing-Jing also specializes in extra
hot and spicy cuisine, indicated by dishes
printed in red on the menu. They also have
pre-arranged dinners for less than $10 per per
son, which serve more food than you can eat —
definitely enough for leftovers for friends back
at the dorm.
Many non-Californians may be unfamiliar
with sushi, but four years at Stanford should
change that. Miyake is a good place for an in
troduction to this Japanese specialty.
Located on University Avenue, Miyake is al
ways filled with Stanford students enjoying
sushi and saki, a Japanese rice wine. The ser
vice is extremely quick — you could eat and be
out of there in 20 minutes — making it a great
place for a quick dinner in an upbeat atmo
sphere.
In addition, for those not ready to take the
plunge and sample the seaweed/rice/raw fish
delicacy, Miyake offers a large assortment of

grilled teriyaki meals complete with soup, sal
ad and steamed rice, all at inexpensive prices.
Hobee's, located in Town and Country Vil
lage, about a five-minute bike ride from cam
pus, continues to be a popular daytime restau
rant for students.
Specializing in health food, the menu at
Hobee's offers everything from omeletes,
sandwiches, french toast and hash browns to a
perennial favorite — coffee cake.
If Mexican food suits your fancy, both Pe
dro's, located nearby in the Stanford Shop
ping Center, and Compadres in Palo Alto are
pleasant restaurants serving large portions at
inexpensive prices. While Pedro's is closer to
campus and has a not-to-be-missed Sunday
brunch, Compadres seems to be more popular
with Stanford students.
Another recently opened and immensely
popular restaurant to hit the Stanford Shop
ping Center is Fresh Choice. Basically a glo
rified soup and salad bar which also offers
fresh baked breads and muffins, it remains a
great place for a quick all-you-can-eat quasi
healthy (except that you eat too much) meal.
Crouton's on University Avenue offers a sim
ilar soup-and-salad-and-more experience.
For Italian food lovers, both Cenzo's and
La Pastaia are great, medium-priced places to
add a little romance, not to mention garlic, to
your life.
Located on University Avenue, Cenzo's,
which greets you with delicious homemade
garlic bread, is a true Italian restaurant serv
ing everything from pasta to grilled meats to
pizzas.
La Pastaia, which specializes in delicious
homemade pasta, is an extremely popular
restaurant which does little advertising. Locat
ed on Emerson Street, it might be easily over
looked, which would be a big mistake given its

excellent food and very cheerful atmosphere.
If you get tired of the usual delivery-quality
pizza, Applewood Inn in Menlo Park offers a
wide variety of gourmet pizzas. Whether it's
artichoke hearts or anchovies on top, the pizza
is always fresh and reasonably priced. Pepper
oni lovers will find themselves at Applewood
often.
Frankie, Johnnie and Luigi, Too com
bines the Italian and pizza specialties into a
one-stop feast location. Despite the long dis
tance from campus on El Camino, Stanford
students flock to Frankie's on weekends to
sample the Peninsula's (arguably) best pizza
and fine Italian cuisine.
Cafe Borrone in Menlo Park and Caffe
Verona in Palo Alto are two popular places to
go for a sandwich, pastry or just a cup of coffee
(especially if you tire of the Coffee House).
Since both have over-the-counter ordering and
are open late, they are great places to take your
reading and enjoy some decent food.
Thai City on El Camino is a worthwhile
place to try exotic cuisine, which is relatively
new to most Stanfordites. While the fpod is
spicy and portions are seemingly small, do not
be fooled — the spiciness and richness make it
impossible to eat any more than served.
For those who have a craving for Indian
food, Natarega on University Avenue deserves
attention. You can sample a delicious assort
ment of tandoori (clay oven) grilled meats and
breads, made by a chef imported from a five
star hotel chain in India.
And because you are now in California, why
not try California Cafe, located in the Stan
ford Shopping Center? This restaurant special
izes in "California" cuisine, which in plain En
glish means a mishmash of just about every
thing — whether it be Chinese chicken salad,
pasta or a hamburger.
