# And you thought 30 books were enough...

### Mara Winokur 
I know what you're thinking. You're think
ing, "Oh, sure. As if I didn't just buy seven bil
lion books for CIV As if I don't have enough
reading to keep me busy until graduation —
MY graduation!"
I know the feeling.
When I came to Stanford, I had so much
mandatory reading that when I had free time,
picking up a book was the last thing on my
mind.
But here's the beauty of it: Stanford and the
surrounding area — Palo Alto, Mountain View,
Menlo Park — have lots of bookstores that are
so neat (yes, neat) that they're fun to visit even
if you have no desire to read.
Let's start with the basics ... like the Stan
ford Bookstore. I realize that you probably
see this as "the place to go to be stampeded by
hundreds of students all looking for the same
textbook."
Granted, the Bookstore is primarily used by
students buying school books. However, there
is a ton of non-educational reading material
there as well, not to mention clothes, toys and
"knickknacks." And you can always grab a
snack at the Cookie Jar. (Try the white choco
late macadamia cookies. Trust me.)
If you want to stray away from campus,
Printer's Inc. and Kepler's Books are your
best bets. Printer's Inc. is Palo Alto's attempt
at a chic little caf§/bookstore where artistic
types can go discuss Sartre.
There are about 10 tables set up inside (sep
arated from the books by a waist-high wall)
where you can sit and eiyoy a caffe latte or a
cappucino. They also serve soup and sandwich
es in the afternoon and cookies and cakes all
day long.
Printer's Inc. has a nice, casual atmosphere
and is open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday

through Friday, 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday. Of its two locations — 310 California
Ave. in Palo Alto and 301 Castro St.in Moun
tain View — I prefer the latter, though it is dif
ficult to get to without transportation. Never
theless, it's a cool place for a late-evening study
break.
Kepler's Books, located at 1010 El Camino
Real in Menlo Park, may be one of the most
well-stocked bookstores you have seen in a
long time. From fiction and children's books to
foreign newspapers and magazines, Kepler's
has it all. If, by some chance, you can't find
what you're looking for, Kepler's will order it
for you. Fast.
Whereas many bookstores don't like you
reading their books, Kepler's encourages it:
The store has chairs set up expressly for that
purpose.
Open from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. during the
week, 9 a.m. to midnight on weekends, Ke
pler's stands out for those who want to browse
and skim but not necessarily buy.
The Stanford Shopping Center is home to
Books Inc., another general bookstore that
features thousands of bargain books on its sec
ond floor. Hours are Monday through Friday
from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Saturday from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6
p.m.
For those who want more than the basics,
several area bookstores feature specialty items
— like Comics and Comix, at 403 California
Ave., and Know Knew Books, just a few
doors away.
As you can probably guess, Comics and
Comix sells . . . comics.
I am not a true comic book conoisseur, but
this little hole-in-the-wall has quite a selection.
It doesn't seem to stock as many old collectors'
items as it does recent editions, however.
Comics and Comix also carries posters, col

oring books and games that are related to the
comic world. Open at 10 a.m. every day, it clos
es at 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, at 8
p.m. Friday and at 7 p.m. Saturday and Sun
day.
Lee's Comics, located at 3429 Alma St., of
fers much of the same fare. Open at 11 a.m. ev
ery day, it closes at 7 p.m. every day but Friday,
when it closes at 9 p.m.
Know Knew Books, on the other hand, only
sells old, used and out-of-print books. Open 10
a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and
noon to 8 p.m. Sunday, this place looks like
someone's attic. In a way, it is someone's attic,
or more correctly, lots of people's attics.
People donate their unwanted books (and
some records) to Know Knew Books, which
sells them for one-half the original cover price.
Usually. But even when they charge more than
that, Know Knew Books still offers a bargain
— and books you can't find anywhere else.
A discussion of local bookstores can't end
without including If Wishes Were Horses, in
downtown Palo Alto. There you will find all the
books you read when you were younger (I still
read them) and more. Dr. Seuss, Maurice
Sendak, Lewis Carroll... they're all here wait
ing for you.
If Wishes Were Horses is located at 522 Ra
mona, but it's difficult to find because it isn't
right on the street. If you walk past Double
Rainbow (a great ice cream parlor, by the way),
a short alley-like lane leads to this land of spe
cial literature.
If the above list doesn't include what you're
looking for, the area offers many other book
stores — those that specialize in science fic
tion, metaphysics, maps and travel books.
They're all out there.
Now, are you sure you don't even have time
to browse?

through Friday, 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday. Of its two locations — 310 California
Ave. in Palo Alto and 301 Castro St.in Moun
tain View — I prefer the latter, though it is dif
ficult to get to without transportation. Never
theless, it's a cool place for a late-evening study
break.
Kepler's Books, located at 1010 El Camino
Real in Menlo Park, may be one of the most
well-stocked bookstores you have seen in a
long time. From fiction and children's books to
foreign newspapers and magazines, Kepler's
has it all. If, by some chance, you can't find
what you're looking for, Kepler's will order it
for you. Fast.
Whereas many bookstores don't like you
reading their books, Kepler's encourages it:
The store has chairs set up expressly for that
purpose.
Open from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. during the
week, 9 a.m. to midnight on weekends, Ke
pler's stands out for those who want to browse
and skim but not necessarily buy.
The Stanford Shopping Center is home to
Books Inc., another general bookstore that
features thousands of bargain books on its sec
ond floor. Hours are Monday through Friday
from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Saturday from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6
p.m.
For those who want more than the basics,
several area bookstores feature specialty items
— like Comics and Comix, at 403 California
Ave., and Know Knew Books, just a few
doors away.
As you can probably guess, Comics and
Comix sells . . . comics.
I am not a true comic book conoisseur, but
this little hole-in-the-wall has quite a selection.
It doesn't seem to stock as many old collectors'
items as it does recent editions, however.
Comics and Comix also carries posters, col

oring books and games that are related to the
comic world. Open at 10 a.m. every day, it clos
es at 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, at 8
p.m. Friday and at 7 p.m. Saturday and Sun
day.
Lee's Comics, located at 3429 Alma St., of
fers much of the same fare. Open at 11 a.m. ev
ery day, it closes at 7 p.m. every day but Friday,
when it closes at 9 p.m.
Know Knew Books, on the other hand, only
sells old, used and out-of-print books. Open 10
a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and
noon to 8 p.m. Sunday, this place looks like
someone's attic. In a way, it is someone's attic,
or more correctly, lots of people's attics.
People donate their unwanted books (and
some records) to Know Knew Books, which
sells them for one-half the original cover price.
Usually. But even when they charge more than
that, Know Knew Books still offers a bargain
— and books you can't find anywhere else.
A discussion of local bookstores can't end
without including If Wishes Were Horses, in
downtown Palo Alto. There you will find all the
books you read when you were younger (I still
read them) and more. Dr. Seuss, Maurice
Sendak, Lewis Carroll... they're all here wait
ing for you.
If Wishes Were Horses is located at 522 Ra
mona, but it's difficult to find because it isn't
right on the street. If you walk past Double
Rainbow (a great ice cream parlor, by the way),
a short alley-like lane leads to this land of spe
cial literature.
If the above list doesn't include what you're
looking for, the area offers many other book
stores — those that specialize in science fic
tion, metaphysics, maps and travel books.
They're all out there.
Now, are you sure you don't even have time
to browse?
