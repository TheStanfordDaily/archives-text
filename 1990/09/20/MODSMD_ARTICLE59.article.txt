# The 						nearby streets of San Francisco offer sites aplenty
## 
### 
Between papers, midterms,
projects, problem sets and finals,
Stanford students must make an
occasional trip to the City — but
whatever you do, don't call it
"Frisco."
Listed below are some of San
Francisco's most famous attrac
tions. An adventurous explorer
can find much more, but these
sites are good for a first trip or
with visiting parents or friends.
Just remember, it's never really
summer in San Francisco, so
dress warmly. And don't fbrget
your camera.
Alcatraz: Once known to in
mates as "The Rock," Alcatraz
claims most of its fame from the
time it was a Devil's Isle-style
federal penitentiary, housing such
notable criminals as the "Bird
Man." The island has also been
used as a fortification, a U.S. mil
itary prison, an army disciplinary
barracks and an American Indian
stronghold. The National Park
Service conducts two-hour tours
from the waterfront. The tours
are traditionally very popular, so
get there early.
Cable cars: They aren't just
transportation. For San Francis
cans, they're a way of life. Catch
the cable cars at the intersection
of Market and Powell near Union
Square or on the waterfront near
Ghirardelli Square.
Chinatown: A Hong Kong na
tive once remarked that
Chinatown reminded him of
home: The rush-hour traffic jams
on the main thoroughfare rivaled
any traffic tie-up a Chinese city
could muster. But Grant Avenue
also offers a kaleidoscope of Asian
delights — restaurants, dim sum
bars, pharmacies displaying
pickled snakes. . . . The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue

house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and
plenty of opportunities for explo
ration.
Civic Center: After the 1906
earthquake and fire, the city plan
ners wanted to remake the town
into a modern Athens. The Civic
Center is only a small part of the
elaborate complex originally
planned. San Franciscans boast
that City Hall, with its orna
mented dome, gargoyled finials
and marble balustrade, is the
finest example of French
Romanesque architecture outside
of Europe. The elaborate federal

and state office buildings, Civic
Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit Hall,
public library and Performing
Arts Center echo this traditional
theme. The glass and concrete
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall
is a modern departure.
Coit Tower: An impressive
monument to the City's
firefighters, Coit looms on a hil
ltop and is easily accessible by car.
The area around Coit Tower is
now an impressive patchwork of
posh apartments.
Fisherman's Wharf: Salty
fishermen, seagulls and the pun
gent smell of freshly cleaned fish

once dominated San Francisco's
wharf. Although the nearby ships
still berth, travelers, carnivals,
wax museums and tourist shops
have almost taken over the sur
rounding wharf area. Still, the
19th-century museum ship
Balclutha hearkens back to the
old days, and some of the City's
best seafood restaurants are
found along the wharf.
The 49-Mile Drive: This half
day tour is a planned drive
through the most famous
landmarks of the City. The route
starts on Van Ness Avenue at the
Civic Onter and is clearly marked

There's no excuse for being bored when
the surprises and delights of San Francisco
are less than an hour's drive away. Take the
boat to Alcatraz and feel what it was like to be
a permanent resident. Take in the glitz of
Union Square stores, then banter with the
vendors along Fisherman's Wharf.

by blue-and-white signs with a
seagull symbol.
Ghirardelli Square: Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Nowadays,
visitors browse through a shop
ping plaza, watch street
performers and buy chocolate and
ice cream in the original chocolate
factory.
Golden Gate Bridge: Many
visitors think the Bridge basks in
the warm California sunshine
overlooking the glistening, calm
waters. Locals, however, know it
is often blanketed in thick fog and
whipped by winds of the Bay. It's
worth visiting, but don't expect
great weather.
Nob Hill: Former site of
Leland Stanford's palatial home
before the 1906 earthquake, Nob
Hill remains the City's center of
conspicuous consumption. Visit
two glorious hotels, the Fairmont
and Mark Hopkins, then stroll
down the street to the ritzy shops
of Union Square.
Old Mint: Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937,
the Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973.
Its exhibits include period rooms,
a pyramid of gold bars, Old West

artifacts, the mint's Special Coins
and Metals Division and monetary
treasures of all kinds.
Polk Street: In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue once
supported a posh shopping district
catering to the well-to-do resi
dents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay activists and the coun
terculture have since supplanted
the fur-coated housewives and
chic shops. Shopping on Polk
Street may no longer be elite, but
it's trendy and fun. Beware of high
prices.
Telegraph Hill: The
Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco. The circuitous streets and
cliff-hanging houses of Telegraph
Hill have been inhabited by suc
cessive generations of flower
children, artists and literati.
Twin Peaks: Not to be con
fused with the television show. A
cliche necking and hangout joint
for the Bay Area's teens, the peaks
offer an intoxicating panorama
from the Marin Headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley.
Union Square: This is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of
the City's most swank shops and
hotels — Saks Fifth Avenue, the
Hotel St. Francis, Elizabeth Ar
den's — front the square.
