# Pueblo Indian plans to retain tribal roots

Freshman Joshua Concha describes the
place he grew up as "a country within this
country."
He comes to Stanford directly from Taos
Canyon, N.M., just outside the Taos Pueblo
Indian Reservation, where he lived as a child.
His way of life on the reservation is very dif
ferent from what most of his fellow freshmen
have experienced.
"We have our own government," he ex
plains. "We even have our own governor, whom
we elect every year." But he is quick to point
out that reservation residents must also follow
U.S. law.
Concha calls the Pueblo religion a mix of
Catholicism and Native American tribal tradi
tions. "(On Christmas) we have'a procession
out of the Catholic church along with tribal

dances," he says.
Concha's mother is full-blooded Native
American, while his father is European-Amer
ican. Despite being only half-Pueblo, Concha
says he was accepted into the tribal religion.
"It's rare for a half-Indian and half-Anglo to be
initiated into our religion," he says. But his
grandfather was "very persistent" in encour
aging the tribe to take him.
He went with other Pueblo Indians to the
"kiva," or cave, where they perform their pri
vate ceremonies. In the cave, "I learned how to
speak Tiwa, our native language," Concha
says. He became fluent enough that he could
speak completely in Tiwa with his grandmoth
er before she died.
Three years ago, Concha's stepfather began
teaching him his trade of silversmithing. Con
cha now uses these skills to make "everything
from rings to 'concho' belts part of the tradi

tional Pueblo garb.
Concha first became interested in Stanford
when his father told him about the Native
American Studies program and Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk, the Native American theme house
located on the Row. He visited Stanford last
April and calls the campus "a beautiful place."
This year, Concha will live in Casa Zapata.
He says he anticipates being active in the Na
tive American community and plans to help
with the Stanford Powwow in the spring. The
powwow, one of the largest Native American
gatherings on the West coast, will celebrate its
20th anniversary this year.
Although he will be far from home, Concha
doesn't expect to lose touch with his tribal
roots. "I want to better inform the other stu
dents who maybe don't know so much about
Native Americans," he says.
