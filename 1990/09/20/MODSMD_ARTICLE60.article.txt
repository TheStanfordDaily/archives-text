# Workless weekends
## Terrific trips are only hours away 
### Mara Winokur 
Welcome to the scholastic life.
Before you crack open those
books, get one thing straight. No
matter how much of your work
absolutely, positively has to get
done, you're not going to do it un
til the last second. Which leaves
you millions of seconds to occupy
between now and the end of the
quarter.
Don't panic. All of Northern
California lies out there beyond El
Camino Real, and if you're willing
to get off campus there are all
kinds of treasures waiting to be
discovered.
Let's start with Berkeley. This
city just north of Oakland isn't ex
actly undiscovered, but it's a place
that always seems to be in the
process of rediscovering itself.
Berkeley is a throwback to the
1960s — call it the Greenwich Vil
lage of California. Notable are the
numerous tie-dye shops, army
surplus clothing stores and corner
bookstores with outdoor cafes.
Street performers and vendors
add to the diversity of the area.
Visiting Cal student territory is
thus a trip into the past, but it's a
fun one. Berkeley is, at the least, a
nice place to "hang out" for an af
ternoon. One can spend hours
browsing through the shops,
strolling across the serene univer
sity campus or simply people
watching. It's a scene you defi
nitely won't see in Palo Alto.
Also somewhat stuck in the
past, the beach town of Santa
Cruz is just more than an hour's
drive in the opposite direction.
But whereas Berkeley is trying to
go back to the '60s, Santa Cruz
has never left.
Which doesn't mean it's dull.
On the contrary, Santa Cruz has a
beach to sun upon and a "main
street" to stroll down. Every cou
ple of hours, a tourist train rolls
through town.

Best of all, there's a real old
fashioned boardwalk with ar
cades, cotton candy and a roller
coaster. And if you're really lucky,
you may catch one of the rare per
formances of the ever-so-talented
Tommy Dorsey Orchestra at the
Cocoanut Grove. Yes, he's dead,
but the band lives on.
See what I mean about never
leaving the '60s?
Down the coast is Monterey. If
you're going to invest in a week
end away, do it here. It has some
of the best tourist attractions
around — including a carousel,
fishing and whale-watching trips
out on Monterey Bay and perhaps
the best fudge in the state on his
toric Cannery Row. Perhaps most
importantly, it is home to the
cutest animals that ever graced
the earth.
I'm talking about sea otters. In
the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
They are so cute, they are worth
traveling an hour-and-a-half to
see. But even if you don't agree,
there are other things to do in
Monterey.
You could see the seals, for in
stance.
And then you can get on High
way 1 again and proceed to
Carmel, just a couple of miles
down the road. Once there, you
can pay to continue your tour on
the famed 17-Mile Drive.
While you do get to see the
famed Pebble Beach, you may see
more expensive homes and golf
links than ocean beaches. Never
theless, a steady stream of cars

Yosemite. Reno. Berkeley. All these places
are within hours of campus. All have treas
ures in store for Stanford tourists.

takes the tour.
Even if you don't love 17-Mile
Drive, you will surely like Carmel.
Everybody does. Carmel is a pret
ty town, once mainly an artists'
colony. Though it has become
more of a tourist center than it
once was, it has dozens of studios
that reflect its heritage. And the
beach at the end of the main
street is a terrific place to catch
the sunset.
For those who prefer the out
doors, Yosemite is the place to
spend your workless weekend.
Tucked neatly between several
gorgeous waterfalls and other
amazing views captured by the
photographer Ansel Adams,
Yosemite's campsites offer easy
access to hiking, rock climbing,
horseback riding, biking and
swimming in cold, pure mountain
water.
For more outdoor activity, a
trip to Lake Tahoe offers much of
the same and more. With several
great ski areas all around the lake,
Stanford students flock to the
slopes in January and "February to
enjoy skiing in 40- to 50-degree
weather. Careful, though — the
weather changes quickly and
chains for your car are a must.
South Lake Tahoe offers plenty
of casinos for those who don't ski.
Reno, less than an hour away, also
boasts of gambling opportunities
in gaudy, overlit places that prove
civilization may have gone too far.
And for a most memorable
weekend, you can get married in
Tahoe and divorced in Reno. All
for just about $100.
