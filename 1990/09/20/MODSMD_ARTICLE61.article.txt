# The
						wild and wacky Bay Area

You're bored.
True, you've only been here a few days, maybe
only one day, but you've seen it all, done it all.
There's nothing different about Stanford or
Palo Alto. Or even the Bay Area, for that matter.
Four years of the same restaurants and movie
theaters loom in front of you, right?
Wrong.
You may not know it, but going to Stanford
means that you are in a position to do some of the
most original and out-of-the-ordinary things
there are, in some of the most original and out-of
the-ordinary places there are.
Anywhere.
Like going to the Barbie Hall of Fame, in
downtown Palo Alto (325 Hamilton). No, I'm not
kidding. Yes, it's really there. Call for yourself if
you don't believe me: 325-5840. It's so much fun,
you'll wonder why it wasn't mentioned in "Ap
proaching Stanford."
As long as you're revisiting your childhood, pay
a visit to the San Jose Children's Discovery
Museum (180 Woz Way, San Jose, 408-298-5437).
Remember when your mother told you not to
climb on things because you'd get hurt? Here you
have the chance to prove she was wrong.
Fire trucks, underground tunnels, wooden
shacks and more — this place was created so chil
dren could get a closer look at many of the things
they experience from a distance (or not at all) each
day. Trust me, you're going to be sorry you ever
grew up.
But not for long. There's a hands-on museum
built for people our size, too. It's The Explorato
rium, at 3601 Lyon Street in San Francisco (561-

0360). You may have heard about it, but you have
to see it to believe it.
A science museum built so you can take part,
The Exploratorium will teach you more physics
than you learned in all of high school. Even if it
doesn't, it's still lots of fun — especially if you can
get a group together and make a reservation for
the Tactile Dome, a pitch-black maze you feel your
way around. Remember, you're at Stanford now;
it may be the most excitement you have in the
dark for a while.
While you're in the City, check out the San
Francisco Zoo on Sloat Avenue near the ocean
(735-7061). It's ranked among the top city zoos in
the United States. And it has koalas.
And if you're into wild animals, you'll love Ma
rine World Africa USA. The oceans and forests
converge in Vallejo, and you can experience it all.
Though the water creatures are confined to tanks
(for obvious reasons), the land animals frequently
roam the park with their trainers. A healthy hour
and-a-half trek from Stanford, the park is worth
the drive. For information, call 707-643-ORCA.
A tiring day with the animals is best ended with
a relaxing night with the animals at The Old
Pro's (2865 El Camino Real, 325-2070).
The Old Pro's is not your average college hang
out. It's also not the place to take your folks for
dinner; rather, it's the place to play pool with bik
ers. Real bikers, not cyclists. No minors allowed.
And after a couple of wild and crazy nights with
the Harley Davidson crew, you're sure to want a
bike of your own. Once you get it, ride it up to the
Lick Observatory, on top of Mount Hamilton
east of San Jose. Lick is one of the oldest observa
tories in the nation, and it has the best view of the
Santa Clara Valley around.
