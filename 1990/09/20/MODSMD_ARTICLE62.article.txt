# Bay Area transit options
## For times when your bike just won't do... 
### 
Officially, it's only 35 miles away.
But when you're without a car and there's
a concert in San Francisco you just can't miss,
it might as well be 3,500 miles away.
No need to fear, though — Bay Area public
transportation can get you there and back
pretty painlessly.
Getting to the City
The most accessible transportation to the
City is the SamTrans bus, which departs from
the El Camino Real bus stop across from the
Stanford Shopping Center. Although not the
most scenic — nor speedy — route, SamTrans
to the City costs only $1.50 each way.
The 7F bus takes two to three trips hourly
to San Francisco, starting at 5:17 a.m. week
days and 6:32 a.m. weekends. Alter 6 p.m.,
buses arrive hourly at five or seven minutes
after the hour. The last bus leaves Palo Alto
at 12:12 a.m.
The duration of the bus trip is double that
in a car, and be prepared to stand during
commuter hours.
The last bus back to Palo Alto leaves the
First and Mission stop in San Francisco at
12:49 a.m.
On weekdays, the Palo Alto-bound 7F buses
leave First and Mission about every 30
minutes from 5:24 a.m. to 6:49 p.m., when
they begin to run hourly. Between 3 and 6
p.m., four buses depart each hour.
On weekends, buses run every half-hour
until 5:45 p.m., when hourly departures begin.
Go underground
For city trips or to beat traffic to the Oak
land Coliseum, you may want to take BART
(Bay Area Rapid Transit). However, the closest
BART station is in Daly City, about 20 miles

You're without a car and
there's something happening
in the City you just can't miss.
Here's how to get there with
out hassling your mind or
your wallet.

north of Stanford on Interstate 280.
From 6 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays, the
SamTrans 5L bus leaves the Stanford Shop
ping Center every 20 to 30 minutes and stops
at the Daly City BART station. Although the
fare is only 50 cents, the stop-and-go route
takes about a half-hour.
On weekends, the bus runs from 5 a.m. to
12:42 a.m. but does not depart from the shop
ping center. The closest stop is at El Camino
Real and Brewster Avenue.
The four downtown San Francisco BART
stations are underground and centrally located
along Market Street.
BART runs every 15 to 20 minutes from
6 a.m. to midnight Monday through Saturday
and from 9 a.m. to midnight on Sundays.
For BART service to the Oakland Coliseum,
depart from the Fremont station, which can
be reached via the Dumbarton Express bus.
Take the train
And speaking of CalTrain, it is yet another
way to reach San Francisco.
Although pricier than the bus — a one-way
ticket costs $3 and round-trip fare is $5.25
— CalTrain is roomier and faster than
SamTrans.

The stops closest to Stanford are at the
corner of University Avenue and Alma Street
and at the end of California Avenue.
CalTrain travels to 27 stations between San
Francisco and San Jose. Thirteen round-trip
passenger trains run north and south every
weekday.
The last stop is in San Francisco at Fourth
and Townsend, within walking distance of
Market Street and downtown San Francisco.
After numerous dawn departures, trains
leave hourly from the University station from
8:27 a.m. to 10:26 p.m.
Other ways to get around
MUNI — the City's transportation system
— provides bus, shuttle, train and cable car
service from San Francisco to northern Daly
City and within San Francisco, with stops
just about everywhere in the City. Fares start
at 85 cents, but a transfer ticket allows riders
to use any MUNI transportation for 90
minutes. Make sure to have exact change. •
To get to Berkeley, you can take the Guten
berg Express, a shuttle between the Stanford
and UC-Berkeley librarires. It runs Monday
through Friday and costs $5 each way.
Reservations are required for the 3:45 p.m.
run Fridays.
On and around campus, the Marguerite
shuttles passengers to the CalTrain station,
downtown Palo Alto and the Stanford Shop
ping Center, Monday through Friday.

changes, call SamTrans, 800-660-4 BUS;
BART, 464-7115; CalTrain, 800-558-8661;
