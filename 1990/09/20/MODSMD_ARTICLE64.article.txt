# Cardinal football on the return road to glory
## 
### Debbie Spander 
As is becoming an annual event
— it appears — the Cardinal
opened the season with a defeat,
this time a 21-17 loss to the
mighty Buffaloes of Colorado.
Oh no, yet another three-win
season on its way....
Maybe not.
Before you cancel your trip to
the athletic box office, take a sec
ond look at the 1990 Stanford
football squad.
There just might be a pleasant
surprise in store.
First of all, Stanford almost
beat the then-No. 6 Buffaloes, in
Boulder.
Secondly, the Cardinal possess
es a fabulously talented crop of
running backs, a deep-threat re
ceiving corps, a massive offensive
line, a very solid defense and an
innovative coaching staff led by
former 49er assistant Denny
Green.
Finally, there's a pretty good
chance Stanford is going to win a
decent percentage of its games.
A position-by-position preview
of the "new" Stanford Cardinal:
•Backfield: Most team

overviews begin with a review of
quarterbacks or receivers, the
"glamur" positions. Not this time.
This is the year of the back. Stan
ford possesses perhaps the
school's most talented running
back corps ever.
Headlining is sophomore Glyn
Milburn, making his first appear
ance after transfering from Okla
homa (where he would have been
a starter in the Sooner backfield).
The compact halfback was draw
ing comparisons with all-time
Stanford great Darrin Nelson af
ter spring ball scrimmages. If the
Colorado contest was any indica
tion, the praises might be right on
target. Not only did Milburn gain
158 all-purpose yards, including a
73-yard punt return, he caught
five passes as well.
Joining Milburn is a trio of full
backs: Jon Volpe, Tom Vardell and
Ellery Roberts. Volpe is the Cardi
nal's leading returnee. The 5-foot
-7 senior became only the third
Stanford back to gain 1,000 yards
two seasons ago but was sidelined
with knee injuries last year.
Roberts, in his first year of action
after transfering from Miami,
showed some of his speed and
agility against the Buffaloes, and

Vardell muscled for Stanford's
second touchdown in Boulder.
•Quarterback: The position
is set — for now. Junior Jason
Palumbis, after being bumped
from the depth chart last season,
regained the starting job in spring
ball and has yet to lose the coach
es' confidence. Shoulder surgery
in the off-season last year raised
some questions about strength,
but he appears to be ready and
more than willing. He completed
18-of-29 passes for 155 yards
against the Buffaloes, but rarely
attempted a toss over 10 yards.
•Receiving: Once again the
Cardinal has a talented pool of re
ceivers, ready to give the offense a
very balanced attack and
Palumbis a variety of targets. Six
-6 Ed McCaffrey, a pre-season Ail-
American, is the biggest threat —
both in height and talent. If recov
ered from a back injury sustained
during training camp he could
catch 60 to 70 balls. Junior Jon
Pinckney became one of the Pac
10's top threats last season and
has the ability to do the same this
year.
At tight end, junior Turner
Baur was trying to fill graduated
(and L.A. Ram) Jim Price's big
shoes, but is out two to four weeks
with a sprained knee. Paul Nickel
and Cory Booker are sharing the
duty.
•Offensive Line: The most
improved position in the past
year. Four of five starters have re
turned, and after a year of
mishaps and lack of coordination,
the line is definitely working as a
unit this year.


Chris Eisenberg — Daily file
After nearly pulling off a huge upset of No. 6 Colorado, the Cardinal is primed for a big season.
Starting fullback Tom Vardell and his teammates will meet Oregon State in Stanford Stadium Saturday
at 12:30. Stanford also hosts San Jose State, and a postgame concert by the Beach Boys, the
following week.
The left side, especially, is
opening eyes. Pre-season Ail-
American Bob Whitfield and Bri
an Cassidy are developing into
quite a wall. Senior Chuck
Gillingham, Rick Pallow and Dar
ran Baird are also giving the Car
dinal offense verifiable protec
tion, especially against the run.
•Defensive Line: Whitfield
and Co.'s defensive counterparts
are also looking much improved
from a year ago. Although very
young and trying to overcome the
hole left by departed Lester Ar
chambeau, the down linemen
have already shown themselves to
be very aggressive. Sophomores
Frank Busalacchi, Estevan Avila
and Tyler Batson gave future op
ponent's offenses something to
lookout for when thoy stopped
Colorado on the 1-yard line for
four downs in the season opener.
•Linebackers: Stanford's

biggest question mark after the
graduation and NFL-departure of
Rob Hinckley and graduation of
Bruce Lang appears to be solved
quicker than anyone thought pos
sible. Enter sophomore Ron
George, an Air Force transfer, who
not only contributes intensity but
also gives speed to the outside.
Sophomore Dave Garnett has sur
faced as the other starting outside
player. Jono Tunney, whom
Green expects to utilize in more
than 90 percent of the defensive
plays, anchors the inside. The se
nior has led the team in tackles
the past two seasons. Kevin Puk
and Dan Byers are being used in
the fourth, and sometimes fifth.
•Secondary: No, Alan Grant
and Rob Englehardt are not for
gotten, but are hardly missed with
the blossoming of Kevin Scott and
Albert Richardson in the corner
back positions. Pre-season All-
American and four-year starter
Scott had two interceptions and
37 deflections to go along with 70
tackles last season. The speedy
and very intense back picked up

right where he left off, intercept
ing a pass in the end zone in Boul
der. Richardson has also devel
oped into quite a threat.
Tuan Van Le, who blocked Cal
ifornia's field goal in the 1988 Big
Game to salvage a tie, gives the
secondary versatility, not to men
tion leadership, with his ability to
play strong or free safety. Jimmy
Klein and Seyon Albert (team
high 16 tackles in Colorado) also
appear to be more than capable at
the safety positions.
•Special Teams: Senior John
Hopkins has emerged as one of
the top place-kickers in the con
ference, not to mention in Cardi
nal history. As of Colorado he had
converted 56 straight extra
points, just three shy of Mark
Harmon's school record.
Sophomore Paul Stonehouse
will be the punter for the second
straight season. After averaging
37 yards per kick and booting sev
en longer than 50 yards last sea
son, coaches have no worry of
yielding precious field position to
opponents.
