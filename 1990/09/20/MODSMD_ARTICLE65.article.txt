# USC the favorite to win the Pac-10
## 
### Chris Crader 
The match-up in the Rose
Bowl the past few years has
become very predictable. In
each of the past three seasons,
the USC Trojans have been
there facing a Big Ten team
from the state of Michigan.
The advent of the 1990 foot
ball season serves as the start
ing point for another race for
the Roses in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. But while the new
season begins a new decade, it
will probably bring something
other than a new result.
Under the direction of Coach
Larry Smith, USC is 21-1-1 in
league play and enters 1990 as
the West Coast favorite to be

playing in Pasadena come Jan.
1. But while Smith appears tp
be building himself a dynasty
in La-La Land, the rest of the
league is helping dissolve the
perception that Pac-10 football
is nothing but a bunch of pass
happy teams that score 35
points every week and lose any
way
Last year Pac-10 teams went
4-0 in bowl games, the only
conference to be perfect. In
fact, the Pac-10 was the only
league to have a winning record
in postseason contests. And
with several premier players
back this year, the conference
should again be one of the best.
Although USC seems to be the
clear-cut favorite to run off
with' the league title, the Trojans
have several pursuers, which
should make for a season full of
interesting games. Here, then, is
a summary of the competition,
complete with projected league
finish, record (through games of
Sept. 8) and AP ranking (Sept.
11 poll), if applicable:
• 1. USC (1-0, No. 6)
The Trojans only returned nine
starters from the team that won
the Rose Bowl last year, including
only two from their dominant de
fense. With split end John Jackson
and fullback Leroy Holt graduat
ing and linebacker Junior Seau
and safety Mark Carrier turning
pro early, they appear to have suf
fered too much in the way of
losses to repeat.
But the reason USC has been
so good the past few years is
depth. Plus, with all-Pac-10 quar
terback Todd Marinovich and
1,269-yard rusher Ricky Ervins
back, their offense will be just as
explosive.
The defense has two-time all
league linebacker Scott Ross
leading the way. He didn't get the
press Seau did last year but is an
outstanding player. His new run
ning mates got off to a good start
against Syracuse in the Kickoff
Classic and the defense will at
least be one of the league's best,
although not as good as last
year's.
• 2. Washington (1-0, No. 22)
The Huskies finished tied for
second in league play last season
for what seemed like the millionth
year in a row. With Don James,
the league's winningest coach
ever, at the helm, the Huskies
have always been a good, solid
team and this year will be no
exception.
They lost a lot of experienced

players on both sides of the ball
(quarterback Cary Conklin, center
Bern Brostek, end Dennis Brown
and safety Eugene Burkhalter),
but return a solid corps of players.
Offensively they have four return
ing starters on the line, mitigating
the loss of Brostek to the NFL,
and tailback Greg Lewis is also
back.
The biggest problem appears to
be a quarterback. Sophomore
Mark Brunell replaced Conklin
and ran for 64 yards against San
Jose State in the opener, but he
was a miserable 7-for-27 for 66
yards through the air.
Defensively the front seven are
a strength, evidenced by San Jose
State's 42 yards on 36 carries, but
the secondary is inexperienced.
• 3. Arizona (1-0, No. 20)
Even since an experiment with
a hybrid run-and-shoot/wishbone
offense a couple years back, Ari
zona has been slowly mutating
into a Big 8 team. They have a
running quarterback, a stable of
running backs and throw the ball
only in case of emergency.
That strategy, even though it
doesn't have a cute name like the
wish-and-shoot, has proven quite
sound, and the Wildcats went to
the Copper Bowl last year and
defeated North Carolina State.
This year they are looking to im
prove one notch upon their
second-place finish in league play
and reach the Rose Bowl for the
first time ever.
They only have two offensive
linemen returning who started
last year, but backs Reggie McGill,
Mario Hampton and Art Great
house give the Wildcats at least
as talented and deep a backfield
as any other team in the confer
ence. Quarterback Ronnie Veal is
not an accomplished passer, but
he can lead the ground attack.
Defensively Arizona struggled
against the run last year, and
losing four starters off their front
seven won't help. But the seon
dary, led by Jeff Hammerschmidt,
who is trying to return from knee

surgery, should be a strength.
• 4. Stanford (0-1, No. 41)
see page 3
• 5. Oregon (1-0, No. 34)
All talk about the Ducks in 1990
begins with Bill Musgrave. The
senior signal-caller is writing his
way farther into the Pac-10 record
books with every game he plays
this season and the Oregon of
fense will live and die on his arm.
He led the league in passing
touchdowns and yardage last year
and is showing every sign of re
peating. He threw for 443 yards
and three touchdowns and ran for
another score to lead the Ducks
over San Diego State in their
opener.
Unfortunately for the rest of
their offense, their starting run
ning backs from last year gradu
ated, their top receiver graduated,
their tight end graduated and
three of their five offensive
linemen graduated.
Defensively they lost a lot from
their front seven but have several
players ready to step in. Their
secondary will not bounce back
so quickly, however.
• 6. Arizona State (1-0, No. 25)
During the offseason Arizona
State put out a media blitz touting
quarterback Paul Justin and
safety Nathan LaDuke for all
sorts of honors. Justin threw for
a lot of yards last year but won't
have many of the same receivers
back, for 1990. Meanwhile the
ground game is suspect and the
offensive line needs rebuiding.
Defensively the Sun Devils will
be strong with eight starters back
led by LaDuke. They got off to a
good start by demolishing Baylor,
but it's just a matter of whether
or not they can keep it up.
• 7. UCLA (0-1, No. 30)
After a 3-7-1 season and the
graduation of 13 starters, the
Bruins got voted into the presea
son top 20. Why? No one knows.
But they certainly didn't look like
a top-20 team in a thumping at
the hands of Oklahoma.
Their running game was non
existent, their passing game was
inconsistent and they are still
looking to replace four starters on
the offensive line. Meanwhile
their secondary is strong, but they
gave up 299 yards on the ground
to the Sooners. Another long
season looms.
• 8. California (1-0)
The Bears looked fairly impres
sive in their season-opening win
over Wisconsin, but that doesn't
say much. They do, however,
having the makings of a fine
ground attack, and the passing
game should be decent with
wideout Brian Treggs around.
Defensively they have a couple
of players who can get into the
opponent's backfield and cause

some havoc. They just can't do it
on a consistent enough basis.
• 9. Washington State (1-1)
The Cougars began last season
with a 6-1 record and were think
ing Rose Bowl. After losing their
last four games of the season,
however, things are looking up no
more.
Star runner Steve Broussard is
in the NFL, their defensive front
six all graduated and their three
top receivers are gone. Quarter
backs Brad Gossen and Aaron
Garcia are both pretty good, but
they need more people to throw
to or hand off to. Playing four
straight road games in league
doesn't help either.
• 10. Oregon State (0-2)
The Beavers lost by 26 to
Kansas two weeks ago. Enough
said.
Okay, maybe that isn't enough
to doom a team to last. How about
the fact that Oregon State gener
ated only 39 yards in the entire
first half against the Jayhawku?
Or that Kansas ran for 261 yards?
Or that the Beavers have only
nine returning starters, tied for
fewest in the conference? Or that
their starting quarterback had 10
interceptions to go with his four
touchdowns last year?
You get the idea.

into a Big 8 team. They have a
running quarterback, a stable of
running backs and throw the ball
only in case of emergency.
That strategy, even though it
doesn't have a cute name like the
wish-and-shoot, has proven quite
sound, and the Wildcats went to
the Copper Bowl last year and
defeated North Carolina State.
This year they are looking to im
prove one notch upon their
second-place finish in league play
and reach the Rose Bowl for the
first time ever.
They only have two offensive
linemen returning who started
last year, but backs Reggie McGill,
Mario Hampton and Art Great
house give the Wildcats at least
as talented and deep a backfield
as any other team in the confer
ence. Quarterback Ronnie Veal is
not an accomplished passer, but
he can lead the ground attack.
Defensively Arizona struggled
against the run last year, and
losing four starters off their front
seven won't help. But the seon
dary, led by Jeff Hammerschmidt,
who is trying to return from knee

surgery, should be a strength.
• 4. Stanford (0-1, No. 41)
see page 3
• 5. Oregon (1-0, No. 34)
All talk about the Ducks in 1990
begins with Bill Musgrave. The
senior signal-caller is writing his
way farther into the Pac-10 record
books with every game he plays
this season and the Oregon of
fense will live and die on his arm.
He led the league in passing
touchdowns and yardage last year
and is showing every sign of re
peating. He threw for 443 yards
and three touchdowns and ran for
another score to lead the Ducks
over San Diego State in their
opener.
Unfortunately for the rest of
their offense, their starting run
ning backs from last year gradu
ated, their top receiver graduated,
their tight end graduated and
three of their five offensive
linemen graduated.
Defensively they lost a lot from
their front seven but have several
players ready to step in. Their
secondary will not bounce back
so quickly, however.
• 6. Arizona State (1-0, No. 25)
During the offseason Arizona
State put out a media blitz touting
quarterback Paul Justin and
safety Nathan LaDuke for all
sorts of honors. Justin threw for
a lot of yards last year but won't
have many of the same receivers
back, for 1990. Meanwhile the
ground game is suspect and the
offensive line needs rebuiding.
Defensively the Sun Devils will
be strong with eight starters back
led by LaDuke. They got off to a
good start by demolishing Baylor,
but it's just a matter of whether
or not they can keep it up.
• 7. UCLA (0-1, No. 30)
After a 3-7-1 season and the
graduation of 13 starters, the
Bruins got voted into the presea
son top 20. Why? No one knows.
But they certainly didn't look like
a top-20 team in a thumping at
the hands of Oklahoma.
Their running game was non
existent, their passing game was
inconsistent and they are still
looking to replace four starters on
the offensive line. Meanwhile
their secondary is strong, but they
gave up 299 yards on the ground
to the Sooners. Another long
season looms.
• 8. California (1-0)
The Bears looked fairly impres
sive in their season-opening win
over Wisconsin, but that doesn't
say much. They do, however,
having the makings of a fine
ground attack, and the passing
game should be decent with
wideout Brian Treggs around.
Defensively they have a couple
of players who can get into the
opponent's backfield and cause

some havoc. They just can't do it
on a consistent enough basis.
• 9. Washington State (1-1)
The Cougars began last season
with a 6-1 record and were think
ing Rose Bowl. After losing their
last four games of the season,
however, things are looking up no
more.
Star runner Steve Broussard is
in the NFL, their defensive front
six all graduated and their three
top receivers are gone. Quarter
backs Brad Gossen and Aaron
Garcia are both pretty good, but
they need more people to throw
to or hand off to. Playing four
straight road games in league
doesn't help either.
• 10. Oregon State (0-2)
The Beavers lost by 26 to
Kansas two weeks ago. Enough
said.
Okay, maybe that isn't enough
to doom a team to last. How about
the fact that Oregon State gener
ated only 39 yards in the entire
first half against the Jayhawku?
Or that Kansas ran for 261 yards?
Or that the Beavers have only
nine returning starters, tied for
fewest in the conference? Or that
their starting quarterback had 10
interceptions to go with his four
touchdowns last year?
You get the idea.
The match-up in the Rose
Bowl the past few years has
become very predictable. In
each of the past three seasons,
the USC Trojans have been
there facing a Big Ten team
from the state of Michigan.
The advent of the 1990 foot
ball season serves as the start
ing point for another race for
the Roses in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. But while the new
season begins a new decade, it
will probably bring something
other than a new result.
Under the direction of Coach
Larry Smith, USC is 21-1-1 in
league play and enters 1990 as
the West Coast favorite to be

playing in Pasadena come Jan.
1. But while Smith appears tp
be building himself a dynasty
in La-La Land, the rest of the
league is helping dissolve the
perception that Pac-10 football
is nothing but a bunch of pass
happy teams that score 35
points every week and lose any
way
Last year Pac-10 teams went
4-0 in bowl games, the only
conference to be perfect. In
fact, the Pac-10 was the only
league to have a winning record
in postseason contests. And
with several premier players
back this year, the conference
should again be one of the best.
Although USC seems to be the
clear-cut favorite to run off
with' the league title, the Trojans
have several pursuers, which
should make for a season full of
interesting games. Here, then, is
a summary of the competition,
complete with projected league
finish, record (through games of
Sept. 8) and AP ranking (Sept.
11 poll), if applicable:
• 1. USC (1-0, No. 6)
The Trojans only returned nine
starters from the team that won
the Rose Bowl last year, including
only two from their dominant de
fense. With split end John Jackson
and fullback Leroy Holt graduat
ing and linebacker Junior Seau
and safety Mark Carrier turning
pro early, they appear to have suf
fered too much in the way of
losses to repeat.
But the reason USC has been
so good the past few years is
depth. Plus, with all-Pac-10 quar
terback Todd Marinovich and
1,269-yard rusher Ricky Ervins
back, their offense will be just as
explosive.
The defense has two-time all
league linebacker Scott Ross
leading the way. He didn't get the
press Seau did last year but is an
outstanding player. His new run
ning mates got off to a good start
against Syracuse in the Kickoff
Classic and the defense will at
least be one of the league's best,
although not as good as last
year's.
• 2. Washington (1-0, No. 22)
The Huskies finished tied for
second in league play last season
for what seemed like the millionth
year in a row. With Don James,
the league's winningest coach
ever, at the helm, the Huskies
have always been a good, solid
team and this year will be no
exception.
They lost a lot of experienced

players on both sides of the ball
(quarterback Cary Conklin, center
Bern Brostek, end Dennis Brown
and safety Eugene Burkhalter),
but return a solid corps of players.
Offensively they have four return
ing starters on the line, mitigating
the loss of Brostek to the NFL,
and tailback Greg Lewis is also
back.
The biggest problem appears to
be a quarterback. Sophomore
Mark Brunell replaced Conklin
and ran for 64 yards against San
Jose State in the opener, but he
was a miserable 7-for-27 for 66
yards through the air.
Defensively the front seven are
a strength, evidenced by San Jose
State's 42 yards on 36 carries, but
the secondary is inexperienced.
• 3. Arizona (1-0, No. 20)
Even since an experiment with
a hybrid run-and-shoot/wishbone
offense a couple years back, Ari
zona has been slowly mutating
into a Big 8 team. They have a
running quarterback, a stable of
running backs and throw the ball
only in case of emergency.
That strategy, even though it
doesn't have a cute name like the
wish-and-shoot, has proven quite
sound, and the Wildcats went to
the Copper Bowl last year and
defeated North Carolina State.
