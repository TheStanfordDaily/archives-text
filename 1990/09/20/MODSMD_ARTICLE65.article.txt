# USC the favorite to win the Pac-10

### Chris Crader 
The match-up in the Rose
Bowl the past few years has
become very predictable. In
each of the past three seasons,
the USC Trojans have been
there facing a Big Ten team
from the state of Michigan.
The advent of the 1990 foot
ball season serves as the start
ing point for another race for
the Roses in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. But while the new
season begins a new decade, it
will probably bring something
other than a new result.
Under the direction of Coach
Larry Smith, USC is 21-1-1 in
league play and enters 1990 as
the West Coast favorite to be

playing in Pasadena come Jan.
1. But while Smith appears tp
be building himself a dynasty
in La-La Land, the rest of the
league is helping dissolve the
perception that Pac-10 football
is nothing but a bunch of pass
happy teams that score 35
points every week and lose any
way
Last year Pac-10 teams went
4-0 in bowl games, the only
conference to be perfect. In
fact, the Pac-10 was the only
league to have a winning record
in postseason contests. And
with several premier players
back this year, the conference
should again be one of the best.
