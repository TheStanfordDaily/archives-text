# No. 6 Stanford spikers set sights on super season

### Harold Yu 
Last season, Stanford women's
volleyball Coach Don Shaw
thought he had the tools to try
something different.
With an array of taller, athletic
players, he instituted an offense
designed to optimize the team's
height advantage in any given ro
tation. If it works, I'm thinking,
I'm going to look like a genius,"
Shaw said. If it doesn't, well you
know."
It didn't and we do. Shaw's
preseason dreams were crushed
as setter and team leader Lara As
per suffered a career-ending in
jury on the team's first road trip.
According to Shaw, Asper's ab
sence also heftily impacted Laura
Olesen and Jennifer Chaffee, two
other seniors instrumental to his
strategy.
Ushered in were freshmen Car
rie Feldman and Kristi Paaso;
ushered out were hopes of reach
ing the NCAA finals for the fourth
time in seven years.
Critics have jumped over the
1989 Cardinal as a team that blew
it all. A loss to San Jose State, a
sub-Stanford 18-12 record, and a
second-round exit from the NCAA

tournament did nothing to weak
en that image.
Shaw sees it a little differently.
He considers last year a rough
transition from a team of the pre
sent" to a team of the future."
All of a sudden, the future
looks delightfully near.
While the Cardinal remains re
freshingly young, the team's tal
ent looms large. Setter Carrie
Feldman may be the Pacific 10
Conference's best; Ail-American
Kristin Klein is the conference's
hardest hitter; All-Everything
middle blocker Bev Oden is of na
tional-team caliber; All-Pac-10
middle blocker Amy Cooper is a
potent quick hitter and blocker.
Mix in considerable depth at
each position, improved passing
and three highly-touted fresh
men, and you have the 1990 Car
dinal (3-0), perhaps the confer

ence's finest.
This is definitely a different
team," Shaw said. We are very fo
cused and motivated. We are going
to be more aggressive. We want to
make sure that whether a team
beats us or loses to us, they will go
away thinking 'that was a bat
tle.'"
The prime combatants in Stan
ford's battle arsenal will be junior
co-captain Klein and sophomore
Oden. Call them what you will:
Dynamic Duo, Lethal Weapon
Two, B-team Bombers, Magnum
and 80. Opponents usually just
call them trouble.
Klein is a 6-foot junior from
Pacific Palisades, Calif. Oden is a
6-2 sophomore from Irvine, Calif.
Both were named first team Ail-
Americans in their freshman year
and both played with the U.S. Na
