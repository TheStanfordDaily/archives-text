# No. 6 Stanford spikers set sights on super season
## 
### Harold Yu 
Last season, Stanford women's
volleyball Coach Don Shaw
thought he had the tools to try
something different.
With an array of taller, athletic
players, he instituted an offense
designed to optimize the team's
height advantage in any given ro
tation. If it works, I'm thinking,
I'm going to look like a genius,"
Shaw said. If it doesn't, well you
know."
It didn't and we do. Shaw's
preseason dreams were crushed
as setter and team leader Lara As
per suffered a career-ending in
jury on the team's first road trip.
According to Shaw, Asper's ab
sence also heftily impacted Laura
Olesen and Jennifer Chaffee, two
other seniors instrumental to his
strategy.
Ushered in were freshmen Car
rie Feldman and Kristi Paaso;
ushered out were hopes of reach
ing the NCAA finals for the fourth
time in seven years.
Critics have jumped over the
1989 Cardinal as a team that blew
it all. A loss to San Jose State, a
sub-Stanford 18-12 record, and a
second-round exit from the NCAA

tournament did nothing to weak
en that image.
Shaw sees it a little differently.
He considers last year a rough
transition from a team of the pre
sent" to a team of the future."
All of a sudden, the future
looks delightfully near.
While the Cardinal remains re
freshingly young, the team's tal
ent looms large. Setter Carrie
Feldman may be the Pacific 10
Conference's best; Ail-American
Kristin Klein is the conference's
hardest hitter; All-Everything
middle blocker Bev Oden is of na
tional-team caliber; All-Pac-10
middle blocker Amy Cooper is a
potent quick hitter and blocker.
Mix in considerable depth at
each position, improved passing
and three highly-touted fresh
men, and you have the 1990 Car
dinal (3-0), perhaps the confer

ence's finest.
This is definitely a different
team," Shaw said. We are very fo
cused and motivated. We are going
to be more aggressive. We want to
make sure that whether a team
beats us or loses to us, they will go
away thinking 'that was a bat
tle.'"
The prime combatants in Stan
ford's battle arsenal will be junior
co-captain Klein and sophomore
Oden. Call them what you will:
Dynamic Duo, Lethal Weapon
Two, B-team Bombers, Magnum
and 80. Opponents usually just
call them trouble.
Klein is a 6-foot junior from
Pacific Palisades, Calif. Oden is a
6-2 sophomore from Irvine, Calif.
Both were named first team Ail-
Americans in their freshman year
and both played with the U.S. Na

tional "B" Team this past sum
mer.
If there is one distinguishing
feature of Klein, it is power. Klein
possesses a hammer that is rare in
the game today.
"Kristin Klein?" standout Cali
fornia hitter Lisa Arce said. "No
one's going to stop her."
Stopping her, however, be
comes that much more complicat
ed when Oden is the other offen
sive option. Already a dominant
collegiate power, Oden has raised
several aspects of her game. Shaw
feels Oden's passing has "im
proved dramatically" as has her
ability to hit from all positions on
the court.
"Bev has got the tools to be the
most dominant player in the
game," Shaw explains.
Setting this Two de Force may
always seem an uncomplicated
task. Feldman would attest other
wise.
Although Feldman was the

highest rated setter in the country
as a high school senior, Shaw
planned for her to take some time
in her adjustment to the college
game. That plan was thrust aside
last season at Nebraska, when As
per went down and Feldman went
in. Her trial-by-fire initiation was
not glitchless, but today Feldman
is as experienced and prepared as
Shaw could have asked for.
Last year, Feldman recorded
1,041 assists, the most ever by a
Stanford freshman. The total
places her third on the career
Stanford assists list after a single
season. She also collected 231
digs, fewer than only Oden and
Klein. For her efforts, Feldman
was named to the Pac-10 All-
One position without competi
tion is Amy Cooper's middle
blocker slot. After a sensational
freshman season, All-Pac-10 se
lection Cooper struggled last year
with injuries and with incumbent
middle blocker Laura Olesen; she
saw little playing time. After a
strong performance at the
Olympic Festival this summer and
effective conditioning, Cooper

seems to be reborn.
A gifted attacker, Cooper hit
.334 as a freshman, placing her
among the nation's leaders. So far
this season, she has equalled that
task. Currently, she is the Pac
10's leading percentage hitter.
Playing opposite Cooper is one
of the conference's most effective
blockers. Co-captain Jessica Ben
ton is a fifth-year senior intent on
leaving with a national title. She
is both a menacing obstacle for
opponents must hit and an inspir
ing team leader with an attitude
Shaw raves about.
Every successful squad has its
die-hard competitor and Stanford
is no exception. Paaso sets the
team standards for relentless ef
fort.
Much like Feldman, Paaso got
the starting call as a freshman
last season unexpectedly. She
showed flashes of brilliance
against highly-ranked University
of the Pacific and played in every
match.
With three ranked teams visit
ing Stanford this week, there is no
better time to see the Cardinal
show its mettle.

Feldman may be the Pacific 10
Conference's best; Ail-American
Kristin Klein is the conference's
hardest hitter; All-Everything

tional-team caliber; All-Pac-10
middle blocker Amy Cooper is a
potent quick hitter and blocker.

This is definitely a different
team," Shaw said. We are very fo
cused and motivated. We are going
to be more aggressive. We want to
make sure that whether a team
beats us or loses to us, they will go
away thinking 'that was a bat
tle.'"
The prime combatants in Stan
ford's battle arsenal will be junior
co-captain Klein and sophomore
Oden. Call them what you will:
Dynamic Duo, Lethal Weapon
Two, B-team Bombers, Magnum
and 80. Opponents usually just
call them trouble.
Klein is a 6-foot junior from
Pacific Palisades, Calif. Oden is a
6-2 sophomore from Irvine, Calif.
Both were named first team Ail-

If there is one distinguishing
feature of Klein, it is power. Klein
possesses a hammer that is rare in
the game today.
"Kristin Klein?" standout Cali
fornia hitter Lisa Arce said. "No
one's going to stop her."
Stopping her, however, be
comes that much more complicat
ed when Oden is the other offen
sive option. Already a dominant
collegiate power, Oden has raised
several aspects of her game. Shaw
feels Oden's passing has "im
proved dramatically" as has her
ability to hit from all positions on
the court.
"Bev has got the tools to be the
most dominant player in the
game," Shaw explains.
Setting this Two de Force may
always seem an uncomplicated
task. Feldman would attest other
wise.
Although Feldman was the

highest rated setter in the country
as a high school senior, Shaw
planned for her to take some time
in her adjustment to the college
game. That plan was thrust aside
last season at Nebraska, when As
per went down and Feldman went
in. Her trial-by-fire initiation was
not glitchless, but today Feldman
is as experienced and prepared as
Shaw could have asked for.
Last year, Feldman recorded
1,041 assists, the most ever by a
Stanford freshman. The total
places her third on the career
Stanford assists list after a single
season. She also collected 231
digs, fewer than only Oden and
Klein. For her efforts, Feldman
was named to the Pac-10 All-
One position without competi
tion is Amy Cooper's middle
blocker slot. After a sensational
freshman season, All-Pac-10 se
lection Cooper struggled last year
with injuries and with incumbent
middle blocker Laura Olesen; she
saw little playing time. After a
strong performance at the
Olympic Festival this summer and
effective conditioning, Cooper

seems to be reborn.
A gifted attacker, Cooper hit
.334 as a freshman, placing her
among the nation's leaders. So far
this season, she has equalled that
task. Currently, she is the Pac
10's leading percentage hitter.
Playing opposite Cooper is one
of the conference's most effective
blockers. Co-captain Jessica Ben
ton is a fifth-year senior intent on
leaving with a national title. She
is both a menacing obstacle for
opponents must hit and an inspir
ing team leader with an attitude
Shaw raves about.
Every successful squad has its
die-hard competitor and Stanford
is no exception. Paaso sets the
team standards for relentless ef
fort.
Much like Feldman, Paaso got
the starting call as a freshman
last season unexpectedly. She
showed flashes of brilliance
against highly-ranked University
of the Pacific and played in every
match.
With three ranked teams visit
ing Stanford this week, there is no
better time to see the Cardinal
show its mettle.
