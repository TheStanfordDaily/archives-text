# Cardinal, Bruins the teams to beat
## 
### Chris Crader 
When the topic of collegiate
women's volleyball comes up,
you can't speak for long with
out mentioning Stanford and
UCLA. The two schools have
been synonymous with success,
combining to appear in the
final four 12 times in the past
nine years.
Needless to say, with compe
tition in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence now underway, the Car
dinal and the Bruins appear to
be the teams to beat. And, de
spite the storied traditions each
school has, both are looking at
1990 as a chance to prove some
thing.
The Bruins finished both
1988 and 1989 ranked No. 1
in the nation, but in each year
they were swept and sent home

Stanford, meanwhile, has been
to six final fours, and three
championship matches, but has
never brought home the big
prize.
While the balance of power
in collegiate volleyball is drift

and are clearly the top two in
the Pac-10. But the level of
competition in the conference
continues to rise, and nothing
is a given.
League play beg* n last week
end and reaches full stride on
the Farm this weekend. Here,
then, is a listing of the
strengths and weaknesses of
the terrific two and their eight
pursuers, including projected
finish, record as of Sept. 9 and
position, if any, in the Tac
hikara poll of Sept. 11:
• 1. Stanford (3-0, No. 6)
see story, page 3
• 2. UCLA (6-1, No. 2)
In 1988, UCLA brought a 34-
0 record into the final four.
Last year they had 30-2 mark
entering the final four. In both
of those years they also had
Daiva Tomkus and Elaine
Youngs.
This year both of those Ail-
Americans are gone, and so,
too, may be their trip to the
final four. Tomkus, a three
time All-American, graduated,
