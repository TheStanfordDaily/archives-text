# Cardinal, Bruins the teams to beat
## 
### Chris Crader 
When the topic of collegiate
women's volleyball comes up,
you can't speak for long with
out mentioning Stanford and
UCLA. The two schools have
been synonymous with success,
combining to appear in the
final four 12 times in the past
nine years.
Needless to say, with compe
tition in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence now underway, the Car
dinal and the Bruins appear to
be the teams to beat. And, de
spite the storied traditions each
school has, both are looking at
1990 as a chance to prove some
thing.
The Bruins finished both
1988 and 1989 ranked No. 1
in the nation, but in each year
they were swept and sent home
in the national semifinals.
Stanford, meanwhile, has been
to six final fours, and three
championship matches, but has
never brought home the big
prize.
While the balance of power
in collegiate volleyball is drift
ing farther and farther from
the West Coast, UCLA and
Stanford are both leading con

tenders to win it all this year
and are clearly the top two in
the Pac-10. But the level of
competition in the conference
continues to rise, and nothing
is a given.
League play beg* n last week
end and reaches full stride on
the Farm this weekend. Here,
then, is a listing of the
strengths and weaknesses of
the terrific two and their eight
pursuers, including projected
finish, record as of Sept. 9 and
position, if any, in the Tac
hikara poll of Sept. 11:
• 1. Stanford (3-0, No. 6)
see story, page 3
• 2. UCLA (6-1, No. 2)
In 1988, UCLA brought a 34-
0 record into the final four.
Last year they had 30-2 mark
entering the final four. In both
of those years they also had
Daiva Tomkus and Elaine
Youngs.
This year both of those Ail-
Americans are gone, and so,
too, may be their trip to the
final four. Tomkus, a three
time All-American, graduated,
and Youngs, a first-team selection
last year, is expected to miss the
entire season due to knee surgery.
With them, the Bruins had the
most feared offense in college vol
leyball. Without them, the Bruins
blew a 14-10 lead in the fifth game
to Nebraska two weeks ago.
They still have sophomore Ail-
American Natalie Williams and
junior Jenny Evans, two of the
most potent outside hitters in the
land. But they are unproven in
the middle and are adjusting to
a new setter. Holly McPeak, the
national Freshman of the Year at
California in 1987, transfered to
Westwood over the summer and
won the starting job.
• 3. USC (1-3, No. 17)
Under second-year Coach Lisa
Love the Trojans have gotten off
to a slow start, much like they
did last year. But in 1989 they
improved throughout the season
and they have the two biggest

reasons for that improvement re
turning for their senior seasons.
Lonise Norfleet, a 6-foot-2 out
side hitter, has made her mark
on the league, and several defen
sive players. She is perhaps the
hardest hitter in the game today
and has improved each season.
The other senior leader is Megan
McCallister, who has been in
volved in the U.S. National Team
program the past two summers.
With those two alone USC
might have more talent than the
other seven teams battling for
third, but that's not all they have
as Stefanie Bodison, the team's
top blocker last year, returns in
the middle.
• 4. Arizona (7-1, No. 15)
In the first year of Pac-10 wom
en's volleyball, Arizona went 9-9.
They went 9-9 again the next year.
And the next. But then last year
they only went B*lo.
Clearly they'll go 10-8 this year
to even the score, and that is well
within reach. The best of four
returning starters is senior out
side hitter Terry Lauchner, a two
time all-league choice.

Joining her are returning out
side hitters Caylin Combs and
Kristi Colson and middle blocker
Trina Smith, a Pac-10 all
freshman team selection last year.
• 5. California (4-2)
The Golden Bears had probably
the best season in school history
last year, reaching the top 10 in
the Tachikara poll at one point.
But after losing two of their three
stars, staving on top will prove
tougher than getting there was.
Lisa Arce, truly one of the na
tion's most outstanding all
around players, returns for her
senior season as a player the Bears
will build around. But fellow out
side hitter Tiffany Rochelle grad
uated and setter Holly McPeak
transfered to UCLA.
Arce will be the team's top of
fensive weapon, but middle
blocker Morgan Cecil has im
proved her hitting. One key for
Cal will be the play of senior Sara
Allison, who has to fill McPeak's
shoes this year.
The other key is if Lynn Patrick
recovers completely from mqjor
knee surgery almost a year ago.

• 6. Oregon State (8-1, No. 23)
In 1987, Guy Enriques' first
year as head coach at Oregon
State, the Beavers went 3-25 over
all and did not win a conference
game. The following year they
won twice in league play, while
last year they took four conference
matches.
Now, in Enriques' fourth year,
the Beavers will finally lose the
label of the Pac-10's worst team
for good. Their improvement over
the past three seasons hasn't been
chance; it's a tribune to the spirit
of Enriques and his players. With
a starting lineup averaging barely
5-9 (Stanford comes in at nearly
6-1), the Beavers still present a
formidable challenge at the net.
• 7. Washington (2-4, No. 27)
The Huskies got their all-time
biggest win when they upset the
Cardinal in the 1988 NCAA
playoffs. At that time everyone
thought Coach Debbie Buse was
a genius, but the stars she in
herited (Laurie Wetzel, Melinda
Beckenhauer, Lisa McCammond,
Kayley Grim) have all graduated
and the cupboard is nearly bare.

They should be set in the
middle with returning starters
Gail Thorpe and Kelley Larsen,
but the outside will be suspect.
Outside hitter Michelle Reid does
return, as does defensive specialist
extraordinaire Ashleigh Robert
son, but replacing the underrated
Beckenhauer at setter will prove
very difficult.
• 8. Oregon (8-1, No. 21)
It's not easy to pick an 8-1 team
ranked 21st in the nation to finish
eighth in its league, but that's
what's happening here. The Ducks
graduated star outside hitter Mic
hele Krebsbach, steady Melissa
Terzian and setter Stephanie
Snyder and will have a tough time
recovering.
Middle blockers Dawnn Char
roin and Mindee Adams will be
the big offensive weapons, but the
Ducks can't set those two unless
they pass well.
• 9. Arizona State (6-4)
After being one of the strongest
programs in the West throughout
the middle part of the '80s, the

Sun Devils have fallen on hard
times. Their top players are 6-4
middle blocker Tina Berg and out
side hitter Mindy Gowell. Both
can be counted on, but neither is
enough to build a team around.
Outside hitters Debbie Penney
and Jennifer Rogers also return,
as does occasional starter Michelle
Monson. But the graduation of
Sue Nord leaves a big hole in the
middle and the graduation of
Noelle Fridrich leaves an even big
ger hole at setter.
• 10. Washington State (4-4)
In the 1990 Pac-10 preseason
coaches poll, the nine other
coaches each picked the Cougars
for last. That says it all.
Junior middle blocker Carrie
Couturier has been a big-time
player for WSU in each of her
first two seasons but she can't
carry the team on her own.
Starter Kristen Hovde and part
time starter Shannon Griffin are
the only other letterwinners who
are back for the Cougars, leaving
them with eight newcomers on
the roster.
