# Disabled ex-swimmer seeks 'normal life'
## 
### Janine DeFao 
For years, Patrick Chang
dreamed of becoming an Olympic
swimmer and rigorously practiced
his strokes.
Today, Chang is still practicing
strokes — this time pen strokes
made with the help of a device he
uses to write by moving his shoul
ders. And instead of striving for
an Olympic gold, Chang said his
"most immediate goal is going
through normal education."
Chang was paralyzed from the
chest down in March 1987 while
doing a practice starting dive.
After five months in the hospi
tal, Chang decided to attend a
"regular high school," rather than
one for students with disabilities.
"I'm really proud of surviving
high school in a wheelchair," he
said. Although other students
didn't ostracize him, Chang said
he felt they treated him different
ly-
"People don't expect as much
from you. They say, 'He's in a
wheelchair, be easy on him.' I
don't like that." So Chang set out
to prove that he was "as good,
even better than [his] peers," he
said.
And he certainly succeeded,
graduating first in his class with a
4.0 grade point average.
While overcoming his own dis
ability, Chang decided to help oth
ers in similar situations. He began
working with spinal injury vic
tims at the Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center, close to his
Cupertino, Calif., home.
"I talked to other spinal injury
victims about entering the real
world — but in a different posi
tion," he said. Many had harder
adjustments to make than he did,
Chang said, because they could no
longer pursue professions like car
pentry and truck driving. "I tell
them about my experience, that
it's not impossible to lead a nor
mal life with an injury."
Chang said he would like to
continue his volunteer work if
there is a program at Stanford
Hospital. He would also like to
write for The Daily. Chang
worked at his high school newspa
per.
While he is excited about com
ing to Stanford, Chang admits he
is nervous.
"Making new friends and being
independent in college is one of
the greatest intimidations I've
had," he said. He hopes his dorm
mates in Soto can overlook his
wheelchair and not give him spe
cial treatment because of it.
The University, however, has
provided some special adaptations

Chang hopes his
friends will over
look his disability.

for Chang, including an automatic
door opener, a computerized key
card and a remodeled private
bathroom.
Chang will not live with a
roommate, but instead with a
hired attendant who will help him
with personal tasks, like getting
dressed.
"I can dress myself, but the
doctors said it will take six to sev
en hours. It's not worth all the
trouble. By the time I got ready,
I'd have to go back to bed," he
said.
But being on his own in college
is very important to Chang.
"Being at home, my parents
took care of every detail to make
me comfortable. I want to be inde
pendent from my family as much
as I can, so I can lead an indepen
dent life after college," he ex
plained.
Chang said having his parents
nearby is reassuring, though. It is
one of the reasons he chose Stan
ford over Harvard.
"I'm still a little scared to go
out on my own. This way, there
are still people to bail me out," he
said.
Chang plans to study eco
nomics and computer science and
hopes to someday open a multina
tional corporation that uses tech
nology to help disabled people lead
more independent lives.
Being able to do things on his
own is important to Chang, who
said he hopes to take his notes in
class, "if it's not too different
from high school."
