# Geiger to leave Stanford for Maryland AD post
## 
### Chris Crader 
In a move that caught the University
entirely by surprise, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger announced he was leaving
Stanford to accept a similar position at
the University of Maryland.
Geiger made the announcement at a
press conference in College Park, Md.,
Sept. 7. He will begin at Maryland Oct.
1.
"I took it because I'm ready for a
change," Geiger said. "I'm at a place in
my life where I feel a new challenge, a
new opportunity — a repotting if you
like — is timely.
"I felt myself getting restless. The
mood swings were wider, the frustrations
were more bothersome. I was just start
ing to get that feeling that I needed a
new congregation and this congregation
needed a new preacher."
Geiger leaves behind perhaps the most
successful athletic program in the nation,
and he is the one most responsible for
that success. Since he replaced Joe Reutz
Jan. 1, 1979, the Cardinal has won 27
national titles, more than any other
school.

But the latter part of the '80s was
when Stanford was most successful. The
Farm took home four NCAA titles in
1985 and 1986 and three apiece in 1987,
1988 and 1989. No school won more na
tional championships in any of those five
years.
He leaves the West Coast behind for
a program that has been rocked with
scandal, especially in the men's basketball
program. Countless violations have given
the Terrapin basketball team three years
of probation, a ban on postseason play
for 1991 and 1992 and substantial
recruiting restrictions. Furthermore, last
week Coach Gary Williams received a
year's probation and a $250 fine after
pleading guilty to driving under the in
fluence on the night of May 13.
"The Maryland profile the last several
years has been one of tragedy and I con
sider myself a builder," Geiger said. "The
fact that they've had as much difficulty
as they've had makes it a very good
opportunity.
"Right away at Maryland there needs
to be a building of trust within the Ath
letic Department and a pulling together.
Secondly, there needs to be a stronger

union between the Athletic Department
and the rest of the University. The third
thing that needs to happen is we have
to rally the state. We need to raise money,
build confidence and heal the wounds."
Geiger strongly believes in a broad
based athletic department, and Stanford's
27 varsity sports gives the University one
of the nation's largest programs. Despite
budget problems, Geiger has always done
whatever possible to keep every sport
viable.
He received a large amount of criticism
for firing football Coach Jack Elway in
1988, but Elway's replacement, Dennis
Green, appears to have the Cardinal im
proving consistently.
Green was not Geiger's only great
hiring move, however. The naming of
Tsra VanDerveer as women's basketball
coach paid off with an NCAA title within
five years; Mike Montgomery has taken
the men's basketball squad to three
straight postseason berths; Richard
Quick, the 1988 U.S. Olympic coach, led
the women's swim team to an NCAA
crown in his first season; and Berhane
Andeberhan has taken an almost nonex
istent women's soccer program to national

prominence.
No announcement has been made as
to who will replace Geiger but it is likely
that an interim athletic director will be
named while a national search is con
ducted. Alan Cummings, the senior as
sociate athletic director, would seem to
be the logical choice to serve in the in
terim period.
Cummings has stated he is not inter
ested in holding the position permanently.
Stanford's other associate athletic direc
tors, Cheryl Levick and Tom Beckett, are
two leading candidates for the position.
"I will have no say and I'm not inter
ested in having a say," in selecting a
successor, Geiger said. "I will not get
involved in a search.... I want to go
along and get started with what's next.
The sooner I go ... the better for Stan
ford and the better for me."
Geiger, who grew up in New York state
and attended Syracuse, said he first
visited Maryland as one of four paid con
sultants who visited the university in
1986. He went on a consulting trip again
this past August and the possibility of
his going to Maryland was brought up.
Geiger and his wife, Eleanor, visited Mar

yland over Labor Day weekend and liked
it a lot. The position was offered and
Geiger accepted.
Geiger said he will take a lot of fond
memories away with him, but
downplayed his role in bringing them
about. "I'm proudest of the coaches and
the student-athletes that make up this
program," he said, but added, "I also feel
a sense of accomplishment at Stanford.
This is a strong coaching staff. We've
done some work to improve the physical
plant. The program is basically well
funded."
Geiger made no comment as to the
leading candidates to replace him but did
have a few final predictions. "I believe
what's in the cards for Stanford is a
much-improved, solid Pac-10 contender
in football under Dennis Green and con
tinued success across the board in ath
letics. I pray for a continuation of a
broadly based program."
He also hopes to be reunited with the
Cardinal at the women's volleyball final
four, which will be held in College Park.
"I'm going to cheer them on in Cole
Fieldhouse," he said. "I think they'll be
there."
