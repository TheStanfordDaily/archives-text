# Yell leaders return to promote spirit
## 
### Lara Filson 
A new team arrived on cam
pus early to begin training for
its season. Unlike all the other
Cardinal squads here for pre
season training, however, this
team won't be competing but
was formed to help cheer other
Stanford teams to victory.
They are the new Stanford
Yell Leaders.
"We are an organized group
for an organized crowd," ex
plained sophomore Amy Po
horence.
"We will not be performing
but channeling the energy of
the crowd," added sophomore
Aaron Poirier.
The squad, made up of 16
students, is scheduled to attend
home football games and men's
and women's basketball and
volleyball games, according to
Jim Brungard, assistant athlet
ic director.
Other activities they might
get involved in through the
Athletic Department include
recruiting and raising aware
ness of the new ban on alcohol
in the stadium.
Stanford last had cheerlead
ers three years ago but the
group fell, not to the budget axe
that many teams are experienc
ing now, but to the student
opinion axe.
"Their downfall was they
were competing against the
Dollies," explained Brungard.
"This year there is an under
standing between the two
groups so it is not going to hap
pen again."
The Dollies are five women
who have traditionally danced
with and are considered a part
of the Band.

manager, agreed that the two
groups are cooperating and are
behind one another.
Dollie Noelle Kovach added
that the groups have two differ
ent styles. "It's like asking
football and volleyball players
to perform together," she said.
Pohorence initiated the idea
of a cheering squad last winter
and approached football Coach
Dennis Green with the idea.
Student opinion was not sup
portive when spring tryouts
were announced because at the
same time the Athletic Depart
ment was dealing with a mil
lion-dollar deficit by cutting the
* budgets of several teams.
The department went along
with the idea, however, and the
resulting unit made its debut at
the UCLA football game last
weekend.
The Band and now the yell
leaders as well will draw from
an Athletic Department budget
earmarked for support groups.
The Band uses its portion for
its one trip south in the fall and
winter and also draws money
from the ASSU and the Music
Department.
"We wish the controversy
hadn't come up," says Po
horence. Their first home game
will be Sept. 22 when Stanford
meets Oregon State.
