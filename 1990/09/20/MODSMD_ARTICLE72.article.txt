# Water polo team ready for 1990
## 
### Cameron Macky 
In water polo Coach Dante Det
tamanti's 13 seasons at Stanford,
every single one of his players
who has played for four years has
been a member of an NCAA
Championship team.
Every single one. At least one
title. In fact, most have played on
more than one NCAA champ.

This year's four seniors, though,
are in danger of becoming Det
tamanti's first class to graduate
without a title — and if that's not
enough incentive, they don't know
what is.
"We're all aware of it, but we
can't dwell on it," senior Chuck
Maguy says. "We're definitely
aware of it, and it's definitely our
goal to win it. We're committed
to it, and to each other."
That commitment has a great
chance of translating into Stan
ford's seventh NCAA title, espe
cially if the team's offense contin
ues to shine. The Cardinal,
ranked third in the country,
opened the 1990 season by going
2-1 at the Fresno State Tourna
ment, dunking Fresno State 10-9,
dropping a 12-11 decision to No.
1 California and coming back to

swamp the University of the
Pacific 11-7.
"We're scoring fine," Det
tamanti says. "If we're scoring
over 10 goals a game we should
win every game. . . . We've had
trouble scoring the past two sea
sons, but right now we've got the
best offense we've had in four or
five years."
That offense is led by Maguy,
who had six goals in the tourna

ment, and senior Rick McNair,
who was second on the team in
scoring last season with 49 goals.
Seniors Colin Keely and Greg Ol
son and junior Greg Morris had
five goals each at Fresno State.
It's a good thing the offense is
in good shape, because, as Det
tamanti says, "We've got to get
our defense and the goal situation
in hand." Four-time All-American
(yes, /our-time) goalie Todd Kemp

has graduated, leaving a mighty
big hole in goal. Freshman Larry
Bercutt and junior Jim Cairns
have been splitting time there, but
neither has been spectacular.
"We need more consistent play
out of our goalkeepers," Det
tamanti says. "I'm waiting for one
of them to really come forth and
take it, but neither one has.
Against Cal, our goalies had four
saves and Cal's had 17.


Tracy Allen — Dally file
Senior Colin Keeiy scored 23 goals for the Cardinal last year and will contribute heavily again this
fall. Stanford and California are the two favorites to win the NCAA title this year.
