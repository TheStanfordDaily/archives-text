# Cardinal soccer has sights set on NCAA tournament

In 1988, the Stanford women's soccer
team finished the season 13-4-2, was
ranked as high as 14th in the
country ... and wasn't invited to the
NCAA tournament, which only fields
12 teams.
The next season, the Stanford wom
en's soccer team ended up 11-4-3, was
ranked as high as No. 7 (before falling
to 20th), was the only team to shut out
three-time defending NCAA champ
North Carolina (who — surprise — went
on to win another title), tied No. 6
UC-Santa Barbara, finished the year
undefeated at home ... and wasn't in
vited to the NCAA playoffs.
Anyone want to guess what goal the
1990 Cardinal women are shooting for?
"Obviously every year our goal is to
make the playoffs, and I think we have
improved our chances," says Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan, who in only three
years has turned a floundering women's
program into a national power. "It's too
early to say, though."
It's not too early, however, to say that
this is a very good team. The Cardinal,
which was ranked 13th in the preseason
poll, outscored its first four 1990 oppo
nents 16-2 to get off to a 4-0 start.
The most impressive freshman has
been Sarah Rafanelli, who leads the
team in scoring with four goals. "Sarah
Rafanelli has been doing a tremendous
job for us," Andeberhan says. "She's a
great player."
Rafanelli — the No. 1 recruit in the
country — hasn't been the only fresh
man standout, however. "Anita Koshy

has been a wonderful surprise, An
deberhan says.
The other freshmen should do fine
as well, once they get healthy. "Not all
of the freshmen are playing yet; a couple
have had injuries," Andeberhan says.
"Even without everyone playing, right
now we're significantly better than last
year."
That's not bad, considering the Car
dinal was pretty darn good last year.
The team returns just about everyone

who made an impact in '89: Senior Jen
nifer Rowland led the team with 13
goals and was named first-team All-Far
West; sophomore Julie Foudy added 12
goals and 10 assists while being named
first team Freshman All-America and
first-team All-Far West; and junior
sweeper Heather Mclntyre (also first
team All-Far West) is back to anchor a
defense that gave up only 12 goals last
year.
Senior goalkeeper Elise Edwards also
had a little something to do with that
defense: She averaged six saves a game
over the course of the year, posting 11
shutouts along the way.
"She's one of the best," Andeberhan
says."I wouldn't want to slight anyone
else — there are several outstanding
goalies around the country — but I
wouldn't trade her for anyone."
No sane coach would. Edwards had
14 saves in the 0-0 tie with UNC and
a whopping 19 more a week later against
UCSB.
Those two ties showed just how close
the Cardinal came to getting into last
season's playoffs. How close? Look at
the team's four losses:
(1) 1-0 at No. 3 Colorado College. In
overtime. With 1:33 left. After an ap
parent hand ball.
(2) 4-3 at No. 7 Santa Clara.
(3) 1-0 at No. 12 St. Mary's.
(4) 3-2 at No. 4 Virginia.
Four losses. Each by a goal. Each on
the road.
The 1989 Cardinal pounded on the
door, and this may be the season they
march right in to the tournament.

Sophomore Julie Foudy is a symbol of the women's soccer team's rise to national
prominence. The U.S. National Team starter turned down offers from all the nation's
powers and will try to lead the Cardinal to its first-ever NCAA tournament berth.
