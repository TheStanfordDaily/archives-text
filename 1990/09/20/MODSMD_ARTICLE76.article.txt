# Transition season starts well for men's soccer team
## 
### Cameron Macky 
How do you give a college soccer
coach a headache? Simple:
First, you hire him an entire
two weeks before preseason prac
tice starts, handing him the reins
to a team that's had one winning
season since 1985.
Then you tell him the team's
four-time Most Valuable Player,
who was probably the best player
in school history, has graduated.
Next, you hand him the team's
1990 schedule. Games against
nine of the nation's top 20? Hey,
no problem.
Then you let him know the
team's last coach didn't exactly
put any extra effort in recruiting
this year's freshmen, which left
the soccer class of '94 with only
three members.
And, finally, you let him watch
as three key players go down with
injuries.
All in all, it's been one heck of
a first month on the job for Stan
ford Coach Colin Lindores, who
replaced the departed Sam Koch
early in August. The first few
weeks have, however, given Lin
dores some definite goals for the
men's program in 1990.
Goal No. 1? "Survival," Lin

dores jokes. "No, no, that's not
true. We're going to look to win
every game, but obviously you
know you're not going to win
them all.
"Based on what I've seen, we'll
be a competitive team, a team
that'll go out and challenge
people. We're not going to go
away, and I think we're going to
scare some people."
The Cardinal did just that early
last week, coming within three
minutes of beating 1989 NCAA
co-champion Santa Clara, which
was ranked No. 1 again at the
start of this season. With 3:01
left in the second half and Stan
ford up 1-0, Santa Clara's Paul
Bravo scored to tie the game after
apparently hitting the ball with
his arm. The referee didn't see
the hand ball, however, and the
game went to overtime.
After 30 extra minutes, the
score was 2-2, and the Cardinal
had a tie against one of the coun
try's top teams. "That was just a
great effort," Lindores said of the
game, which moved the Cardinal's
record to 1-1-2.
"We're going to play intense de
fensive games — that's the heart
of our abilities — and try to sneak
a couple of goals in, like against

Santa Clara," Lindores says. "It's
not an attractive style, but you've
got to go with the people you
have."
Even that isn't always easy, be
cause not everyone is healthy.

Junior Rhett Harty, a member of the U.S. National Under-23 Team, will be a leader for a young
Cardinal squad this year. Harty, the team's leading scorer last year, is the captain of the Cardinal
this fall and will have a big leadership role in the defense. With a new coach and a new outlook the
team will be exciting all season long.
