# Cross country ready for 1990
## 
### Michelle Ghert 
As one would expect, after a
few weeks of practice the Stanford
cross country team is off and run
ning with its season-opening meet
at Michigan State. The team will
then compete at the Ohio State
Invitational Friday. Those early
meets should be quite telling as
both the men's and women's team
are expected to have impressive
performances this year.
Women's cross country Coach
Brooks Johnson is optimistic
about the team's potential for im
provement over last year and for
high placings at the Pacific 10
Conference meet and at the
NCAA District 8 Championships.
He says that it is difficult to pre
dict at this point in time just how
well the women's team will do.
"We have a very young team:
three sophomores and one senior,
all the rest are freshmen." says
Brooks, "We'll have a better eval
uation of the team after the next
three weeks of competition."
Senior Melanie Bloch, the 1990
Pac-10 1,500-meter champion
during track season, is expected to
lead the women's team this year.
In 1989, Bloch placed sixth overall
in the Pac-10 Cross Country
Championships and is a candidate
for a top individual placing in
1990. The return of Ashley Black,
Amy McConnell and Jill Shenkel
will provide solid depth for the
team.
The men's team placed third at

the NCAA District 8 meet and
fourth at the Pac-10 Champi
onships last season and a strong
core of last year's team will be re
turning in 1990. Alex Accetta,
Fred Carter, Jason Martin and
Dave Scudamore are expected to
lead the squad to high team plac
ings. All four had respectable indi
vidual placings last year at the
Pac-10 Championships and at the
NCAA District B's.
David Strang, who was an Ail-
American on the Cardinal's track
and field team, will provide added
depth to the men's cross country
team this year. Strang's best 1989
800-meter time of 1:46.90 ranks
him in the top three in Cardinal
history. In the same year, his time
of 1:49.38 at the 1990 Pac-10
Championships earned him first
place and a Pac-10 Championship
title.
The home course for both the

keeps optimistic.

Cardinal men's and women's
cross country teams is located on
the Stanford Golf Course. The
course is known for its challeng
ing nature as well as its pic
turesque scenery. For the past six
seasons, the Stanford course has
been the home of the NCAA Dis
trict 8 Championships. The Pac
-10 Championships have been held
on this course on several occa
sions as well.
This year, once again, Stanford
will host the Pac-10 Cross Coun
try Championships at the Golf
Course. The Pac-10 conference is
considered to be the top distance
conference in the nation and the
event is a prestigious one.
Stanford will also host the
Stanford/Holiday Inn Invitational
this year. The annual meet will
take place Oct. 6 this year.
Johnson expects both the
men's and women's teams to have
strong finishes this year. "Both
teams should be in the top three
in the Pac-10 conference and in
the top three in the NCAA Dis
tricts."
The performances of both the
men and women freshmen should
play a key role in determining
whether the Stanford cross coun
try team can live up to these ex
pectations.
