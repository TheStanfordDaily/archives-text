# Small-school student due for big change
## 
### Mary Sprague 
"My school had no newspaper,
no sports teams, no prom and no
graduation," said Dana Duncan,
one of only four seniors in last
year's graduating class at Lycee
International in Los Angeles.
"There were drawbacks since
the school was so small," Duncan
said. "You can't choose your class
es or teachers. I had the same his
tory teacher for four years."
Duncan couldn't chose a group
of friends, either. "I don't know
what cliques are like because I
was with the same four people all
day," she said.
"It was like a family," she
added. "Teachers wore jeans and
were called by their first names."
Because the school offered no
extracurricular activities, Duncan
initiated her own. "I started a de
bate team which only had one
member — me," she said. Duncan
also volunteered time helping in
an emergency room and teaching
handicapped children to ride hors
es.
As if the size is not enough to
make Lycee International stand
out, all its courses are taught in
French.
When she entered the school in
seventh grade, Duncan did not
speak a word of French. "On a
spelling exercise we were only al
lowed to miss 20, but I had scores
of minus 80," she said.
"Most of the kids were from
France and other Eastern Euro
pean countries," she said, explain
ing that only three of the 20 stu
dents were Americans. "And even
the American kids had at least one
parent who spoke French — ex
cept me," Duncan said.
However, after a few years of
being immersed in the French
language, Duncan began to speak
pretty well. "But it was gradual,"
she said.
Duncan is very excited about
all the extra-curricular and aca
demic opportunities at Stanford.
"There is so much to choose
from," she said. She is particular
ly interested in being a peer
health educator at Cowell Health
Student Center, a dorm represen
tative for the ASSU and a member
of Amnesty International.
Duncan plans to double-mcgor
in biological sciences and interna
tional relations. She is interested

in biology because she said she
has always wanted to be a sur
geon, ever since she had an appen
dectomy when she was very
young.
She plans to combine medicine
and international relations in her
career by working for an organiza
tion such as the Red Cross, which
provides medical assistance to
countries in need.
Throughout high school, Dun
can wanted to go to school on the
East coast. "I wanted a change in
pace, a new environment," she
said.
That aspiration changed after
visiting Columbia University last
year. "I knew I couldn't live
there," she said, explaining that
the environment was too depress
ing.
Duncan's reaction to Stanford
was an entirely different story. "I
really like Stanford," Duncan ex
claimed.
She described the students as
"laid-back, warm, involved, inter
ested." She is looking forward to
being with "a large number of
people with similar goals."
Duncan noticed many Stanford
students seemed "more con
scious" of others' ethnic back
grounds. She is not used to stu
dent-of-color organizations, for
example. Different backgrounds
"never became an issue" in her
school, and she said she is unsure
what she thinks about this new
way of approaching ethnic back
grounds.
Duncan said she realizes Stan
ford will be a big change from her
small school. But she's ready.
