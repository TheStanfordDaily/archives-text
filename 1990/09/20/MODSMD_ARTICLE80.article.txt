# Incoming frosh will make a mark on the Farm

### Lara Filson 
In 1989-1990 Stanford had another sen
sational year in athletics, winning three
NCAA championships (women's basketball
and men's and women's tennis) and tying
Texas for the most titles won by a school for
the year.
One constant was the contribution
made by freshmen athletes on many teams
throughout the year. For example:
• Bob Whitfield led the offensive line of
Stanford's football team. He was the only
player named to the All Pac-10 team.
• Jeff Hammonds rallied the baseball
team to a No. 1 national ranking and a
third-place showing in the College World
Series. He was named the national baseball
Freshman of the Year.
• Val Whiting helped the women's bas
ketball team capture its first national title,
averaging 12.4 points per game.
• Janet Evans, an Olympic gold medalist,
joined the women's swim team which
placed second in the nation. She was named
the collegiate Swimmer of the Year, the Sul
livan Award winner and Honda-Broderick
Award winner.
• Julie Foudy led the women's soccer
team in goals and was named first-team
freshman Ail-American.
• Meredith McGrath spearheaded the ef
fort of the women's tennis team to collect
its fifth consecutive NCAA title, becoming
an Ail-American in singles and doubles be

fore she elected to turn pro after her first
year.
They, as well as many other freshmen,
were powerhouses behind their teams ef
forts. Dave Kennedy, co-recruiting coordi
nator, agrees with the magnitude of their
contribution.
"Looking at last year's freshmen, it was
unusual the impact they made as a class.
But this year's class also has the potential
to be really good. They just have big shoes
to fill. It's going to be hard to top last year,"
he said.
There are many freshmen who will be ar
riving on the Farm to make an impact on
their teams. Several arrived early to begin
training for the fall seasons.
Women's soccer player Sarah Rafanelli is
a member of the U.S. National Team. The
forward picked Stanford over North Caroli
na, winner of seven NCAA titles in the past
eight years, because it was closer to her
home in the East Bay. Her sister, Stephanie,
also played for Stanford the last three
years.
The younger Rafanelli said that the ad
justment to college involved getting used to
a more physical style of play. "The level of
competition is definitely higher but it will
push me to improve as a player," she said.
This fall's training is the first time she
has been on the field since suffering a knee
iryury in April. "I'm trying to get in shape
and get my ball touch back," she said.
Football player Hartwell Brown also felt

Stanford was the place for him. "I thought
Coach (Denny) Green was turning the pro
gram around, and when I came out to visit
I really fit in here with the players," he said.
When he arrived he was switched from
outside linebacker to inside linebacker,
which has made the transition harder. "I've
had to learn a whole new position," he ex
plained. "The level of play here is a quan
tum leap above the high school level be
cause the play develops so quickly," he said.
Piper Hahn joins the women's volleyball
team coming from Mira Costa High School
as the USA Today/Mizuno high school Play
er of the Year.
The setter picked Stanford because the
other schools she was looking at had good
athletics or academics but the Farm offered
her both. She said the difference with the
collegiate level of play is that it is more tech
nical. "I came in planning to work hard and
seeing where I could contribute," Hahn
said.
Coincidentally, she was joined by high
school teammate and friend Heidi Eick on
the Farm. Eick was named a first-team high
school Ail-American by Volleyball Monthly.
Other top athletes joining the farm in
clude men's golfer Notah Begay. The native
American from New Mexico won the Junior
World Championships this summer and
reached the final eight at the U.S. Junior
Championships.
In the winter when swimming and diving
begin their seasons, other big freshmen

names will also crop up. On the women's
team there is Summer Sanders. This sum
mer at the Goodwill Games she won three
gold medals and beat Evans, the world
record holder, in the 400-meter individual
medley.
Eileen Richatelli will join the women's
diving team. She won the three-meter com
petition at the world age group diving
championships in Madrid, Spain. Coach
Rick Schavone called her "the best recruit"
he's ever had.
For the men, Derek Weatherford, the
high school national record-holder in the
100-yard backstroke and national champi
on in the 200 backstroke will be one of sev
eral top recruits looking to make waves for
the Cardinal.
Both men's and women's tennis fresh
man class boast the top junior players in the
country. The women will be joined by the
nation's top two juniors, Laxmi Poruri and
Emma Woodhouse.
The men's team netted the top recruit
ing class for the second straight year with
top recruit Chris Coctus as well as Vimal
Patel and Michael Flanagan.
Finally, Canyon Ceman, another setter
from Mira Costa, will be joining Coach Fred
Sturm's men's volleyball team.
The future is uncertain for teams on the
Farm. But if the past repeats itself, rest as
sured that Stanford's freshman class will be
contributing its share to the success of the
the Cardinal.
