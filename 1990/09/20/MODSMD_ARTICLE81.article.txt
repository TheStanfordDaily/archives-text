# Club sports add opportunity

### Michelle Ghert 
California is the athletic capital of the United
States, and Stanford athletics clearly represents this
fact. More members of the 1988 United States
Olympic Team were affiliated with Stanford(stu
dent-athletes or coaches) than any other post-sec
ondary institution in the nation.
The strength of Stanford athletics isn't limited to
the varsity sport program, however. The club sports
program at Stanford offers 24 sports that well more
than 2,000 participants within the Stanford commu
nity take part in each year. The wide array of club
sports includes cycling, ice hockey, equestrian, judo
and women's water polo.
Several club sports have Varsity 111 status, which
means that they compete at a national level and
must abide by national collegiate sports regulations.
These sports are women's field hockey, lacrosse,
men's rugby, sailing, skiing, synchronized swimming
and wrestling.
Other club sports need not follow the NCAA man
dates and generally compete on a more local basis.
The program emphasizes student initiative com
petition, performance and in team management.
Students have the opportunity to play a large role in
the organization and direction of their sport.
Club sports Director Shirley Schoof runs the pro
gram and acts as a liaison between the Stanford Ath
letic Department and each of the 24 club sports.
Funding is separate from the Athletic Department
and is allocated among the sports according to need
and efforts in fund-raising.
The club sports' main fundraising activity is a
benefit basketball game featuring the Harlem Globe
trotters. Other sources of revenue for the program
include ushering and ticket-taking at the football
and basketball games as well as quarterly dues.
The fortitude of the Club Sports program is ap
parent in the success of many of the sports on the na
tional level. The men's ultimate frisbee team was na
tional champion in 1983-84 and runner-up in 1985-
86. The synchronized swimming team has been na
tional runner-up in each of the past four years. The
women's lacrosse team was West Coast champion in

1981,1982 and 1986. And the cycling team took fifth
place at the 1990 national championships held at
Stanford.
The experience of being involved in a club sport
can range from a first-time endeavor at a new sport
to the continuance of an athletic career that began
many years before college. Some club sport athletes
are more interested in exploring new skills and stay
ing in shape, while some are striving for berths on
their sport's national team.
The emphasis on athlete leadership and initiative
allows for education in sports management and a be
hind-the-scenes look at the politics and funding in
volved in sports. The attitude in most of the club
sports is more relaxed than in the varsity sports be
cause there is no pressure to perform at the scholar
ship level.
Still, it would be inaccurate to categorize all club
sports into one stereotype. Each sport has its own
level of intensity and demand. Therefore students
looking for an athletic outlet can not only choose
from a variety of sports, but they can choose a level
of intensity that best suits their academic and ex
tracurricular schedule.
The more intensive sports resemble varsity sports
in the students' level of commitment and hours of
training per week. Other sports allow the students to
be less committed and to participate at their own
pace.
Training times, locations, seasons and dues are
provided in the Stanford club sports brochure that is
distributed each fall and is available year-round at
the club sports office in Roble Gym.
The long list of Stanford club sports continues
with badminton, men's and women's bowling, crick
et, men's field hockey, polo, racquetball, women's
rugby, running, softball and squash.
Combining varstiy and club sports, Stanford
boasts more than 50 sports that are available for stu
dent participation. With such a large variety of
sports to choose from, Stanford encourages an ath
letically involved student body. The Stanford club
sports program invites all students to become a part
of perhaps the strongest collegiate athletic program
in the nation — Stanford Athletics.
