# Card loses opener, wins respect

### Debbie Spander 
BOULDER, Colo. — The looks said it
all.
No fighting back the tears. No hang
ing heads. Disappointment, yes. Disillu
sionment, no.
This time a loss meant more than
simply an "L" in the win/loss record.
This time there was more than resigna
tion and the perennial "next week is a
new ballgame" outlook.
This time the defeat may have sig
nalled the blossoming of a nationally
competitive football program at Stan
ford.
When victory — no, when a mtyor up
set — comes within 12 seconds and one
inch of reality, it's tough to not dwell on
what could have been. But the Cardi
nal's post-game attitude, not to mention
its on-the-field performance, was far
from that of a losing squad.
"As soon as we started leaving the
field we all realized we do have a good
team and that there are good things
ahead of us," cornerback Kevin Scott
said. "We know we lost but deep inside
everybody knows that we can compete
with anybody in the country."
Sure, the could-have-beens and
should-have-beens dominated conversa
tions for the next 24 hours. Of course no
one felt that almost defeating one of the
nation's top teams was good enough.
But neither did anyone think that the
loss signalled the advance of yet another
disappointing season. Quite the oppo
site, actually.
"In a sense this game proved to us
that we can be a force. It would have

been nice to win, but the most important
thing is that we played hard down to the
last second. We never gave up. That is
the sign of a winning team," linebacker
Ron George said.
The goal-line stand said it all. In the
end, No. 6 Colorado prevailed, but the
unranked and underrated Cardinal
didn't make it easy.
With 4:17 remaining in the game, the
Buffaloes took over on their own 20 af
ter John Hopkins' 27-yard field goal
gave Stanford a 17-14 lead. Last sea
son's only undefeated team in the regu
lar season, while held to only two touch
downs and six forays into Stanford terri
tory for the first 56 minutes, quickly re
gained its heralded form.
Forty-two yards in three plays.
First-and-10 on the Cardinal 11 one
play later.
A touchdown, it appeared, was immi
nent.
Stanford, however, had other ideas.
"We had played our hearts out defen
sively the whole game — it was going to
take an incredible effort for them to
score," Scott said. "We knew our backs
were to the wall but we were incredibly
pumped. We had that feeling that we
could stop them."
As defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
improvised, the Cardinal defense re
sponded. While Colorado's offensive cor
nerstones, running back Eric Bieniemy
and quarterback Darian Hagan, slowly
moved the Buffs forward, there were no
easy yards. With 40 seconds remaining
Colorado found itself staring into the
whites of a fourth-and-1 on the Stanford
2. The Folson Field crowd was eerily

still.
Stanford defenders raised their arms
after Hagan's quarterback keeper up the
middle, but measurement showed the
play to be a first down. By inches. The
Cardinal dug in.
On first-and-goal fullback George
Hemingway tried bullying his way
through the middle for the score. No
gain. Colorado timeout.
Second-and-goal: same ball carrier,
same result.
"We dove underneath and plugged it
up pretty good," sophomore nose tackle
Frank Busalacchi said.
Land-loving signal-caller Hagan opt
ed for the air on third down. Incomplete.
Not until fourth-and goal, with 12
seconds remaining, did Bieniemy sneak
into the end zone. By an inch. Maybe.
While Coach Denny Green and nu
merous players questioned the call, offi
cials nonetheless signaled the touch
down. And the Buffalo victory.
Heartbreaking of a loss as it might
have been, the Cardinal found reason
for encouragement and a springboard
for momentum.
"The goal-line stand shows we have
the confidence and ability to hold one of
the top teams in the nation. It was just a
matter of inches that prevented us from
getting the win," Stanford's offensive
weapon Glyn Milburn said.
"Colorado was playing for the nation
al championship last year and we should
have won the game. We all feel that. It
has to be a boost that we can carry into
the rest of the season. We know we can
play with any team in the coun
try," Scott added.
Of course a victory would have
definitively proved to the nation,
and maybe to the AP pollsters,
that Green's second-year squad
has climbed out of the collegiate
cellar. The team doesn't need the
actual "W."
"Coming into this gave we felt
nobody respected us as a team.
The writers gave Colorado 21
points — they felt we couldn't
even stand on the same field —
but it turned out to be a whole dif
ferent ball game. We are a good
caliber team and and we can hang
with the best of them," offensive
tackle Bob Whitfield said.
But didn't the Cardinal do the
same thing two years ago? Didn't
it open the season with a last
minute loss to a top-ranked squad
(USC) and prophecize about the
future?
And look what happened. Stan
ford went on to win only three
contests the entire season, finish
ing with a 3-6-2 record.
This time, the players argue, is
different.
Said fullback Tom Vardell, "We
were devastated after the USC

loss — we didn't consciously
throw up our hands, but you
could tell. Colorado is totally dif
ferent. It became evident how
much winning means to us —
we've really come together."
The difference was also evident
in the Cardinal's scoring drives,
not to mention the overall offen
sive scheme. Traditionally passing
Stanford ran the ball.
Both touchdowns were on the
ground.
Senior quarterback Jason
Palumbis dove into the end zone
for the squad's first touchdown,
nine minutes into the game, after
the amazing Milburn dodged and
spun for a 73-yard punt return.
Two minutes later Vardell
muscled a yard for another six
points.
Colorado didn't answer the
Cardinal for two quarters. Two
fumbles, two sacks and an adept
Stanford defense shut out the
overwhelming favorite for the
first half.
Heisman candidate Bieniemy
found light in the third quarter,
racing for scores from 18 and 36
yards out within three minutes of
playing time. He finished the day
with 158 yards and three touch
downs. Fellow candidate Hagan
ran for 131 of his own, while pass
ing for 154 yards and receiving for

another 25.
Colorado is supposed to run.
Stanford isn't. While Palumbis
did attempt 29 passes (and com
pleted 18 — for 155 yards) 21
plays were on the ground. In ad
dition to the 73-yard return, Mil
burn gained another 40 rushing.
Backfield mate Ellery Roberts
powered for 21. Junior Chris
Walsh brought down four passes
for a team-high 64 yards, while
Milburn snagged five tosses for an
additional 48 yards giving him
158 all-purpose yards.
Colorado outgained the Cardi
nal on the ground, in total yards,
in first downs, in third down effi
ciency, in total offensive plays and
in time of possession.
And still barely won.
Stanford football has to be en
couraged.
Card notes
Defensive back Seyon Albert
led the defense with 16 tackles
while Busalacchi recorded 10.
Linebacker George, in his first ap
pearance after transfering from
Air Force, had nine tackles, in
cluding two for losses, and one
sack. Cornerback Scott had five
tackles to go along with his end
zone interception in the waning
sceonds of the first half.
Starting tight end Turner

Baur went down on the sixth play
of the game and will be out two to
four weeks with a sprained knee.
Stanford's all-everything quar
terback from 1979-82 John El
way, who cut off his support of
Stanford football after father, for
mer Cardinal football Coach Jack
Elway, was fired after the 1988
season, attended the game and
pledged to resume contact with
the program. The reason? Athletic
Director Andy Geiger's depar
ture for the University of Mary
land.
Ralphie 111, Colorado's live
Buffalo mascot, cruised through
the oncoming Cardinal at the be
ginning of the second half. Who
knows, maybe it was getting even
for Ralphie 11, who suddenly died
after the last meeting of the BufTs
and Stanford in 1987.
The Dollies made their first ap
pearance on national television af
ter driving to Colorado. Can't beat
that spirit.
Senior outside linebacker
Chris Hawkins retired upon the
advice of his doctor after an irreg
ular heartbeat was not controlled
by medication. Free safety Tony
Trousset also ended his Cardinal
football career when extensive
knee damage suffered during last
season's Stanford-Notre Dame
game did not completely heal.

Colorado found itself staring into the
whites of a fourth-and-1 on the Stanford
2. The Folson Field crowd was eerily

still.
Stanford defenders raised their arms
after Hagan's quarterback keeper up the
middle, but measurement showed the
play to be a first down. By inches. The
Cardinal dug in.
On first-and-goal fullback George
Hemingway tried bullying his way
through the middle for the score. No
gain. Colorado timeout.
Second-and-goal: same ball carrier,
same result.
"We dove underneath and plugged it
up pretty good," sophomore nose tackle
Frank Busalacchi said.
Land-loving signal-caller Hagan opt
ed for the air on third down. Incomplete.
Not until fourth-and goal, with 12
seconds remaining, did Bieniemy sneak
into the end zone. By an inch. Maybe.
While Coach Denny Green and nu
merous players questioned the call, offi
cials nonetheless signaled the touch
down. And the Buffalo victory.
Heartbreaking of a loss as it might
have been, the Cardinal found reason
for encouragement and a springboard
for momentum.
"The goal-line stand shows we have
the confidence and ability to hold one of
the top teams in the nation. It was just a
matter of inches that prevented us from
getting the win," Stanford's offensive
weapon Glyn Milburn said.
"Colorado was playing for the nation
al championship last year and we should
have won the game. We all feel that. It
has to be a boost that we can carry into
the rest of the season. We know we can
play with any team in the coun
try," Scott added.
Of course a victory would have
definitively proved to the nation,
and maybe to the AP pollsters,
that Green's second-year squad
has climbed out of the collegiate
cellar. The team doesn't need the
actual "W."
"Coming into this gave we felt
nobody respected us as a team.
The writers gave Colorado 21
points — they felt we couldn't
even stand on the same field —
but it turned out to be a whole dif
ferent ball game. We are a good
caliber team and and we can hang
with the best of them," offensive
tackle Bob Whitfield said.
But didn't the Cardinal do the
same thing two years ago? Didn't
it open the season with a last
minute loss to a top-ranked squad
(USC) and prophecize about the
future?
And look what happened. Stan
ford went on to win only three
contests the entire season, finish
ing with a 3-6-2 record.
This time, the players argue, is
different.
Said fullback Tom Vardell, "We
were devastated after the USC

loss — we didn't consciously
throw up our hands, but you
could tell. Colorado is totally dif
ferent. It became evident how
much winning means to us —
we've really come together."
The difference was also evident
in the Cardinal's scoring drives,
not to mention the overall offen
sive scheme. Traditionally passing
Stanford ran the ball.
Both touchdowns were on the
ground.
Senior quarterback Jason
Palumbis dove into the end zone
for the squad's first touchdown,
nine minutes into the game, after
the amazing Milburn dodged and
spun for a 73-yard punt return.
Two minutes later Vardell
muscled a yard for another six
points.
Colorado didn't answer the
Cardinal for two quarters. Two
fumbles, two sacks and an adept
Stanford defense shut out the
overwhelming favorite for the
first half.
Heisman candidate Bieniemy
found light in the third quarter,
racing for scores from 18 and 36
yards out within three minutes of
playing time. He finished the day
with 158 yards and three touch
downs. Fellow candidate Hagan
ran for 131 of his own, while pass
ing for 154 yards and receiving for

another 25.
Colorado is supposed to run.
Stanford isn't. While Palumbis
did attempt 29 passes (and com
pleted 18 — for 155 yards) 21
plays were on the ground. In ad
dition to the 73-yard return, Mil
burn gained another 40 rushing.
Backfield mate Ellery Roberts
powered for 21. Junior Chris
Walsh brought down four passes
for a team-high 64 yards, while
Milburn snagged five tosses for an
additional 48 yards giving him
158 all-purpose yards.
Colorado outgained the Cardi
nal on the ground, in total yards,
in first downs, in third down effi
ciency, in total offensive plays and
in time of possession.
And still barely won.
Stanford football has to be en
couraged.

BOULDER, Colo. — The looks said it
all.
No fighting back the tears. No hang
ing heads. Disappointment, yes. Disillu
sionment, no.
This time a loss meant more than
simply an "L" in the win/loss record.
This time there was more than resigna
tion and the perennial "next week is a
new ballgame" outlook.
This time the defeat may have sig
nalled the blossoming of a nationally
competitive football program at Stan
ford.
When victory — no, when a mtyor up
set — comes within 12 seconds and one
inch of reality, it's tough to not dwell on
what could have been. But the Cardi
nal's post-game attitude, not to mention
its on-the-field performance, was far
from that of a losing squad.
"As soon as we started leaving the
field we all realized we do have a good
team and that there are good things
ahead of us," cornerback Kevin Scott
said. "We know we lost but deep inside
everybody knows that we can compete
with anybody in the country."
Sure, the could-have-beens and
should-have-beens dominated conversa
tions for the next 24 hours. Of course no
one felt that almost defeating one of the
nation's top teams was good enough.
But neither did anyone think that the
loss signalled the advance of yet another
disappointing season. Quite the oppo
site, actually.
"In a sense this game proved to us
that we can be a force. It would have

been nice to win, but the most important
thing is that we played hard down to the
last second. We never gave up. That is
the sign of a winning team," linebacker
Ron George said.
The goal-line stand said it all. In the
end, No. 6 Colorado prevailed, but the
unranked and underrated Cardinal
didn't make it easy.
With 4:17 remaining in the game, the
Buffaloes took over on their own 20 af
ter John Hopkins' 27-yard field goal
gave Stanford a 17-14 lead. Last sea
son's only undefeated team in the regu
lar season, while held to only two touch
downs and six forays into Stanford terri
tory for the first 56 minutes, quickly re
gained its heralded form.
Forty-two yards in three plays.
First-and-10 on the Cardinal 11 one
play later.
A touchdown, it appeared, was immi
nent.
Stanford, however, had other ideas.
"We had played our hearts out defen
sively the whole game — it was going to
take an incredible effort for them to
score," Scott said. "We knew our backs
were to the wall but we were incredibly
pumped. We had that feeling that we
could stop them."
As defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
improvised, the Cardinal defense re
sponded. While Colorado's offensive cor
nerstones, running back Eric Bieniemy
and quarterback Darian Hagan, slowly
moved the Buffs forward, there were no
easy yards. With 40 seconds remaining
Colorado found itself staring into the
whites of a fourth-and-1 on the Stanford
2. The Folson Field crowd was eerily
