# Card loses opener, wins respect

### Debbie Spander 
BOULDER, Colo. — The looks said it
all.
No fighting back the tears. No hang
ing heads. Disappointment, yes. Disillu
sionment, no.
This time a loss meant more than
simply an "L" in the win/loss record.
This time there was more than resigna
tion and the perennial "next week is a
new ballgame" outlook.
This time the defeat may have sig
nalled the blossoming of a nationally
competitive football program at Stan
ford.
When victory — no, when a mtyor up
set — comes within 12 seconds and one
inch of reality, it's tough to not dwell on
what could have been. But the Cardi
nal's post-game attitude, not to mention
its on-the-field performance, was far
from that of a losing squad.
"As soon as we started leaving the
field we all realized we do have a good
team and that there are good things
ahead of us," cornerback Kevin Scott
said. "We know we lost but deep inside
everybody knows that we can compete
with anybody in the country."
Sure, the could-have-beens and
should-have-beens dominated conversa
tions for the next 24 hours. Of course no
one felt that almost defeating one of the
nation's top teams was good enough.
But neither did anyone think that the
loss signalled the advance of yet another
disappointing season. Quite the oppo
site, actually.
"In a sense this game proved to us
that we can be a force. It would have

been nice to win, but the most important
thing is that we played hard down to the
last second. We never gave up. That is
the sign of a winning team," linebacker
Ron George said.
The goal-line stand said it all. In the
end, No. 6 Colorado prevailed, but the
unranked and underrated Cardinal
didn't make it easy.
With 4:17 remaining in the game, the
Buffaloes took over on their own 20 af
ter John Hopkins' 27-yard field goal
gave Stanford a 17-14 lead. Last sea
son's only undefeated team in the regu
lar season, while held to only two touch
downs and six forays into Stanford terri
tory for the first 56 minutes, quickly re
gained its heralded form.
Forty-two yards in three plays.
First-and-10 on the Cardinal 11 one
play later.
A touchdown, it appeared, was immi
nent.
Stanford, however, had other ideas.
"We had played our hearts out defen
sively the whole game — it was going to
take an incredible effort for them to
score," Scott said. "We knew our backs
were to the wall but we were incredibly
pumped. We had that feeling that we
could stop them."
As defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
improvised, the Cardinal defense re
sponded. While Colorado's offensive cor
nerstones, running back Eric Bieniemy
and quarterback Darian Hagan, slowly
moved the Buffs forward, there were no
easy yards. With 40 seconds remaining
Colorado found itself staring into the
whites of a fourth-and-1 on the Stanford
2. The Folson Field crowd was eerily

still.
Stanford defenders raised their arms
after Hagan's quarterback keeper up the
middle, but measurement showed the
play to be a first down. By inches. The
Cardinal dug in.
On first-and-goal fullback George
Hemingway tried bullying his way
through the middle for the score. No
gain. Colorado timeout.
Second-and-goal: same ball carrier,
same result.
"We dove underneath and plugged it
up pretty good," sophomore nose tackle
Frank Busalacchi said.
Land-loving signal-caller Hagan opt
ed for the air on third down. Incomplete.
Not until fourth-and goal, with 12
seconds remaining, did Bieniemy sneak
into the end zone. By an inch. Maybe.
While Coach Denny Green and nu
merous players questioned the call, offi
cials nonetheless signaled the touch
down. And the Buffalo victory.
Heartbreaking of a loss as it might
have been, the Cardinal found reason
for encouragement and a springboard
for momentum.
"The goal-line stand shows we have
the confidence and ability to hold one of
the top teams in the nation. It was just a
matter of inches that prevented us from
getting the win," Stanford's offensive
weapon Glyn Milburn said.
"Colorado was playing for the nation
al championship last year and we should
have won the game. We all feel that. It
has to be a boost that we can carry into
the rest of the season. We know we can
