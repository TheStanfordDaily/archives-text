# Stanford spikes Illini for 3-0 start
## 
### Harold Yu 
The 1990 Stanford women's volleyball team
is not taking kindly to being doubted.
Since being lambasted in Volleyball Month
ly's season preview as a team that did nothing
right last year, the sixth-ranked and undefeat
ed Cardinal has been itching to disprove its
skeptics.
The squad wasted little time as Stanford
streaked through an undefeated road trip two
weeks ago, dusting unranked teams from
Northwestern and Syracuse and dislodging
No. 7 Illinois in comeback fashion.
"We definitely needed that win," sophomore
setter Carrie Feldman said of the Illinois
match. "Starting off this way really helps the
team."
It helps the standings too. Thanks to the
road trip, Stanford is currently the only unde
feated squad in the Pac-10. The Cardinal's
most feared conference opponent, UCLA, suf
fered a loss the same weekend.
While the Bruins were busy surrendering
their top ranking, Stanford initiated its 1990
season by dispatching upstart Northwestern,
15-11,15-6,14-16,15-4 in Evanston, 111.
The Cardinal, which had broken camp just
two weeks previously, showed few signs of ear
ly season malaise. Ail-American sophomore
middle blocker Bev Oden resumed her offen
sive duties by pelting 16 kills and contributing
two block assists on the night. Junior co-cap
tain Kristin Klein maintained the tenacious
defensive play that gave her the team lead in
digs in each of her first two seasons. Klein dug
20 balls, one-third of Northwestern's team to
tal.
While the squad hitting percentage was
hardly awe-inspiring, Stanford kept North
western off-balance by serving them out of the
match. The Cardinal finished with 12 service

were down 7-0 in the third
game and came back to win
it.'

aces, including six by senior Jessica Benton.
Stanford unleashed its vaunted hitting
power in full two days later at the Illini Clas
sic. Oden, Klein, and junior All-Pac-10 middle
blocker Amy Cooper menaced Syracuse with
an unforgiving offensive assault. Outside hit
ter Klein pounded 20 kills, nine fewer than
Syracuse had throughout the night. Oden con
nected 14 times for an other-worldly .600 hit
ting percentage. Playing in her home state,
Cooper contributed a .313 mark. These perfor
mances resulted in a 15-6, 15-4, 15-4 hum
bling.
The task proved far more challenging the
following night against an aggressive, experi
enced and nationally ranked Illini squad. After
watching Illinois devastate New Mexico State
in their opening-round match, Stanford play
ers were somewhat intimidated about playing
Illinois before its noisy home-crowd, Feldman
admitted.
The effects of this predisposition showed
early as Illinois sped to a two-game lead. After
the Cardinal surrendered seven consecutive
points in game three, Stanford's chances ap
peared abysmal. Stanford sent its doubters a
billboard-size message, though, by managing
to crawl back.
Coach Don Shaw inserted freshman backup
setter Piper Hahn to serve at 0-7. Hahn, last
year's national high school Player of the Year,
delivered four punishing jump serves which

provided the impetus for a Cardinal revival.
Her teammates responded accordingly as
Oden, Klein, and Cooper resumed their offen
sive heroics. Oden hammered a career-high 25
kills for a .347 percentage; Klein smashed 24
kills to record an impressive .423 mark; Coop
er offered 11 kills and a .429 hitting percent
age. Klein continued her superlative defensive
play, collecting 21 digs. For these pressure
packed performances, each of the Stanford tri
umvirate was placed on the all-tournament
team while Oden was crowned the Illini Clas
sic's Most Valuable Player.
The Cardinal raced back into the match
recording 15 unanswered game-three points
before a stunned Illinois crowd. "We scored
those four points so easily," Feldman said, "we
knew we could get back in it."
Stanford did more than that as they seized
the remaining games 15-4 and 15-10 to prevail
against an Illini team that previously had nev
er lost at home after taking a 2-0 game lead.
The Cardinal solidified its No. 6 national rank
ing and underscored its intentions to disprove
preseason naysayers.
"I think it says a lot that we were down 7-0
in the third game and came back to win it,"
Klein said. "I think it says a lot about our team
and our character."
Card notes
For her efforts, Oden was named Pac-10 Player
of the Week. During the road trip, Oden hit .368
with 55 kills, five aces, 30 digs, and 17 blocks. Oden
continues to post the numbers that last season
earned her first-team All-America honors as a fresh
man.
Currently four Stanford starters are hitting over
.340 for the season. Anything over .300 is generally
considered excellent. Hitter/middle blocker Oden,
middle blocker Cooper, and outside hitter Klein are
joined by setter Feldman in the select group.
