Abigail Derecho's love for the
written word began at a very early
age.
She remembers her older sis
ters reading the same books to her
over and over again. By the age of
2 or 3 she could recite them and
even knew when to turn the page.
"I would fake their friends out be
cause it looked like I was read
ing," she said.
Later she learned her interest
extended to writing as well. "Writ
ing poetry comes naturally to me.
I love music and the way things
sound. Poetry is putting words to
gether by listening to how they
sound," she explained.
Derecho enjoys writing mono
logues also. "I like to act and am a
ham, but I have to write my own
parts," she said.
She has already been recog
nized for her talent with several
awards. Derecho said her most ex
citing award was received in a Los
Angeles library contest for a poem

she wrote as a freshman at Nar
bonne High School in Lomita,
Calif.
"They sent me to London for a
week without any structure. It
was my first time in Europe, so I
toured around and loved it," she
said.
Derecho's love for writing has
no beginning point that she can
discern. "I was fortunate to have
always been surrounded by tal
ented people," she said. "My
friends put pressure on me to find
my talent."
As a feature writer at her high
school newspaper for three years,
Derecho enjoyed meeting many
different people. "Every lunch I
had to scrounge in the cafeteria
asking strangers what was going
on in their lives so I could find
someone interesting to write
about, " she explained.
"I met athletes, drug addicts, a
dancer in a Disney parade, teen
homosexuals and volunteers who
worked at blood drives. There are
so many different personalities

out there," she said.
Besides writing, Derecho also
spent time doing public service
through a local Kiwanis club. She
especially enjoyed tutoring a
young girl name Paige every week.
"Paige and I were buddies. She
tried to teach me to dance, but she
told me that I had rhythm glands
missing," Derecho jokes.
She also ei\joyed working with
handicapped children and the
Special Olympics.
At Stanford, Derecho plans to
continue her outreach and her
writing. Presently she is working
on a collection of short stories. "I
hope to finish them by Christmas,
show them to my high school En
glish teachers during break and
then send them out to be pub
lished," she said.
She describes the works as fic
tion based strongly on her child
hood experiences. "They are
about adults from a kid's point of
view. I think they're my best
works yet," she said.
The short stories also deal with

experiences that arose because of
her Filipino background. "Ten
sions arise in new situations. I
saw this with my parents when
they try to wall out a new culture,
but we all have to assimilate," she
said.
