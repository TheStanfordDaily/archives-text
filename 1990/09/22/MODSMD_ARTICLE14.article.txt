# Two last-minute field goals go for naught
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior Staff Writer 
John Hopkins thought he had
seen it all.
After booting the go-ahead
field goal with four minutes re
maining in Boulder two and a half
weeks ago, Stanford's kicker had
to watch from the sidelines as
Stanford's victory hopes were
smashed by Colorado's eleventh
hour touchdown.
Four years of numerous last
quarter defeats teaches a player
not to get his hopes too high, but
this time, Hopkins thought, this
time Stanford was definitely go
ing to prevail.
This time his field goal had put
the Cardinal up by two over
UCLA, 31-29, and only 1:14
showed on the clock. Almost a
guaranteed victory. Almost.
"After being here four years
I've seen every situation that
we've been through so I realize a
game is not over till its over,"
Hopkins said, "but I really
thought we had the game after
the field goal. Everyone did."
Everyone but Bruin second
string quarterback Tommy Mad
dox. Maddox and the previously
slow-to-respond Bruins did any
thing they wanted over the next
minute 20-yard shotgun pass
es, 18-yard tosses down the side
line, runs through the middle.
For the second consecutive
week the apparently under-con
trol opponent was clicking just at

the right moment. The Maddux
led shotgun formation was on tar
get every play, overwhelming the
Cardinal's young defense.
Once again, Hopkins had no
option but to pace the sidelines
and watch the "victory" become
increasingly tenuous.
With 80 yards in eight plays, all
executed in just over a minute,
the improable was coming true.
UCLA second-and-goal on the
Cardinal three. 0:02 to play.
And while Hopkins and the
Stanford offense held its breath
on the sidelines, Hopkins' coun
terpart, Brad Deluiso took the
field for a 21-yard try.
What does the opposing kicker
do? Wish he had missed his kick
so the game didn't come down to
this? Wish it could be him out
there instead?
"I was just wishing I was on
the field goal block. With a seven
foot high jump I felt I could have
jumped up and blocked anybody.
But I was acatually pretty confi
dent that we had the chance to
block it with Tuan [Van Le] and
everyone out there," the two sport
athlete said.
Daluiso, however, saw nothing
but the air betweeen the uprights.
UCLA 32, Stanford 31.
Disappointment. Frustration.
Again.
"It's very frustrating because
everybody plays so well and so
hard and we don't get the victory.

Twice this season John Hopkins has kicked late-game field goals to put the Cardinal ahead, only to see
the team lose both games. The Senior from Texas is frustrated, but remains optimistic about Stanford's
chances for the coming year.
