# Two last-minute field goals go for naught
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior Staff Writer 
John Hopkins thought he had
seen it all.
After booting the go-ahead
field goal with four minutes re
maining in Boulder two and a half
weeks ago, Stanford's kicker had
to watch from the sidelines as
Stanford's victory hopes were
smashed by Colorado's eleventh
hour touchdown.
Four years of numerous last
quarter defeats teaches a player
not to get his hopes too high, but
this time, Hopkins thought, this
time Stanford was definitely go
ing to prevail.
This time his field goal had put
the Cardinal up by two over
UCLA, 31-29, and only 1:14
showed on the clock. Almost a
guaranteed victory. Almost.
"After being here four years
I've seen every situation that
we've been through so I realize a
game is not over till its over,"
Hopkins said, "but I really
thought we had the game after
the field goal. Everyone did."
Everyone but Bruin second
string quarterback Tommy Mad
dox. Maddox and the previously
slow-to-respond Bruins did any
thing they wanted over the next
minute 20-yard shotgun pass
es, 18-yard tosses down the side
line, runs through the middle.
For the second consecutive
week the apparently under-con
trol opponent was clicking just at

the right moment. The Maddux
led shotgun formation was on tar
get every play, overwhelming the
Cardinal's young defense.
Once again, Hopkins had no
option but to pace the sidelines
and watch the "victory" become
increasingly tenuous.
With 80 yards in eight plays, all
executed in just over a minute,
the improable was coming true.
UCLA second-and-goal on the
Cardinal three. 0:02 to play.
And while Hopkins and the
Stanford offense held its breath
on the sidelines, Hopkins' coun
terpart, Brad Deluiso took the
field for a 21-yard try.
What does the opposing kicker
do? Wish he had missed his kick
so the game didn't come down to
this? Wish it could be him out
there instead?
"I was just wishing I was on
the field goal block. With a seven
foot high jump I felt I could have
jumped up and blocked anybody.
But I was acatually pretty confi
dent that we had the chance to
block it with Tuan [Van Le] and
everyone out there," the two sport
athlete said.
Daluiso, however, saw nothing
but the air betweeen the uprights.
UCLA 32, Stanford 31.
Disappointment. Frustration.
Again.
"It's very frustrating because
everybody plays so well and so
hard and we don't get the victory.

Twice this season John Hopkins has kicked late-game field goals to put the Cardinal ahead, only to see
the team lose both games. The Senior from Texas is frustrated, but remains optimistic about Stanford's
chances for the coming year.
We definitely deserve to be win
ning as much as UCLA or any
body else does." Hopkins said.
"It was harder to take after the
week before because we came out
at the Colorado game and even
though we lost we were winning
the whole game, we let one slip
away. We knew we were just not
going to let that happen again. It
wasn't even that we were going to
beat UCLA but we were going to
crush them."
It was also more difficult to
swallow than the previous defeat
because the Cardinal appeared to
be dominating the game as late as
the third quarter, when with only
four minutes remaining in the pe
riod Stanford led by two touch
downs -21-7 and had limited
the Bruins to 134 total yards. Of
fensively, Stanford had already
equaled last years's highest sin
gle-game touchdown output, and
for the defense's credit UCLA's
starting quarterback Jim Bonds
had been so smothered offensively
that Bruin fans booed as he left
the Rose Bowl field at halftime.
The impact of one freak play on
the final score didn't make the
loss any easier to accept.
Maddox's 36-yard touchdown
pass to Bryan Adams with just
under six minutes to play gave the
Bruins a 27-28 score in what ap
peared to be a routine touchdown,
capped off by a PAT attempt to tie
the game.
Daluiso's kick, however, was
blocked by sophomore defensive
sensation Frank Busalacchi.
Bad luck, or fate, or something
took over.
While Cardinal defenders cele
brated, the ball bounced along the

field, right into the outstretched
arms of UCLA's kick-holder, none
other than the former backup-sig
nal caller Maddux. The redshirt
freshman quickly looked to the
end-zone where tight end Rick
Daly just happened to be stand
ing. All alone. Two point conver
sion. 29-28 UCLA lead.
Not only wasn't the Cardinal
kick defense ready for the Bruin
response, it wasn't aware that an
opponent was allowed to execute
such a play.
"I didn't understand what was
going on," kick-blocking specialist
Le said. "I thought it was over. I
didn't know you could throw the
ball after a blocked extra point."
While Coach Denny Green
didn't argue with the validity of
the play, he did protest the legality
of the Bruin formation during the
pass, to no avail. "I can't under
stand how they didn't have a cou
ple of guys cross the line of scrim
mage, but the official said they
didn't so I have to take his word
for it.
Whatever the components, for
the second time in as many weeks
Hopkins and Co. were left holding
their heads in disbelief and dis
may as the clock hit 0:00. Two up
set victories so close the players
could almost feel them. Two de
feats. An 0-2 record. An 0-1 Pacif
ic Ten Conference tally.
But for the second time the
players also gleaned the positive
from the loss, and vowed not to
give up or linger on the frustrat
ing outcome.
For starters, the offense
clicked. 386 yards. Five scoring
drives. 31 points. Quarterback Ja
son Palumbis threw two touch
down passes while 24 of 31 passes
foar 231 yards. Glyn Milburn was
more of his spectacular self, twist
ing and breaking tackles for 75
yards and bringing in another 34.

Fullback Tommy Vardell bullied
for 59 yards and two scores. And
Ed McCaffrey was back.
Stanford's Ail-American re
ceiving candidate only lept for
nine passes totaling 123 yards and
both touchdown receptions in his
first game after a back injury.
"Our team had a great effort,
they did a lot of things extremely
well," Green said. "They put
points on the board, had a great
drive in the final minutes to go
ahead, there was pretty good pass
ing, and some of our guys up front
played very well."
While the defense did give up
three scores in the final 19 min
utes of playing time, the squad
was also pleased with its effort, es
pecially considering the number
of sophomores (seven) in the line
up.
"They got it done you've got
to give them a lot of credit. They
[UCLA] just made the plays. You
can't fault the defense," offensive
guard Chuck Gillingham said.
Whether offense, defense or
special teams, however, all players
agreed that a second heart-break
ing victory was not going to de
stroy their season.
"It seems like we lose a lot of
close games but we always bounce
back. Its obvious everybody is still
frustrated. We're not going to be
satisfied till we win some games
and get what we deserve, what
we're worth. We know we're bet
ter than 0-2," Hopkins said.
"The fact of the matter is we
can't feel bad about our record
but we can't be satisfied," Gilling
ham said. "These guys are not go
ing to go into the tank like we
have in the past."

yards and bringing in another 34.

Fullback Tommy Vardell bullied
for 59 yards and two scores. And
Ed McCaffrey was back.
Stanford's Ail-American re
ceiving candidate only lept for
nine passes totaling 123 yards and
both touchdown receptions in his
first game after a back injury.
"Our team had a great effort,
they did a lot of things extremely
well," Green said. "They put
points on the board, had a great
drive in the final minutes to go
ahead, there was pretty good pass
ing, and some of our guys up front
played very well."
While the defense did give up
three scores in the final 19 min
utes of playing time, the squad
was also pleased with its effort, es
pecially considering the number
of sophomores (seven) in the line
up.
"They got it done you've got
to give them a lot of credit. They
[UCLA] just made the plays. You
can't fault the defense," offensive
guard Chuck Gillingham said.
Whether offense, defense or
special teams, however, all players
agreed that a second heart-break
ing victory was not going to de
stroy their season.
"It seems like we lose a lot of
close games but we always bounce
back. Its obvious everybody is still
frustrated. We're not going to be
satisfied till we win some games
and get what we deserve, what
we're worth. We know we're bet
ter than 0-2," Hopkins said.
"The fact of the matter is we
can't feel bad about our record
but we can't be satisfied," Gilling
ham said. "These guys are not go
ing to go into the tank like we
have in the past."
Card notes
With his four good PATs Hopkins be
came the all-time leading Stanford con
secutive PAT kicker with 60 in a row.
John Hopkins thought he had
seen it all.
After booting the go-ahead
field goal with four minutes re
maining in Boulder two and a half
weeks ago, Stanford's kicker had
to watch from the sidelines as
Stanford's victory hopes were
smashed by Colorado's eleventh
hour touchdown.
Four years of numerous last
quarter defeats teaches a player
not to get his hopes too high, but
this time, Hopkins thought, this
time Stanford was definitely go
ing to prevail.
This time his field goal had put
the Cardinal up by two over
UCLA, 31-29, and only 1:14
showed on the clock. Almost a
guaranteed victory. Almost.
"After being here four years
I've seen every situation that
we've been through so I realize a
game is not over till its over,"
Hopkins said, "but I really
thought we had the game after
the field goal. Everyone did."
Everyone but Bruin second
string quarterback Tommy Mad
dox. Maddox and the previously
slow-to-respond Bruins did any
thing they wanted over the next
minute 20-yard shotgun pass
es, 18-yard tosses down the side
line, runs through the middle.
For the second consecutive
week the apparently under-con
trol opponent was clicking just at

the right moment. The Maddux
led shotgun formation was on tar
get every play, overwhelming the
Cardinal's young defense.
Once again, Hopkins had no
option but to pace the sidelines
and watch the "victory" become
increasingly tenuous.
With 80 yards in eight plays, all
executed in just over a minute,
the improable was coming true.
UCLA second-and-goal on the
Cardinal three. 0:02 to play.
And while Hopkins and the
Stanford offense held its breath
on the sidelines, Hopkins' coun
terpart, Brad Deluiso took the
field for a 21-yard try.
What does the opposing kicker
do? Wish he had missed his kick
so the game didn't come down to
this? Wish it could be him out
there instead?
"I was just wishing I was on
the field goal block. With a seven
foot high jump I felt I could have
jumped up and blocked anybody.
But I was acatually pretty confi
dent that we had the chance to
block it with Tuan [Van Le] and
everyone out there," the two sport
athlete said.
Daluiso, however, saw nothing
but the air betweeen the uprights.
UCLA 32, Stanford 31.
Disappointment. Frustration.
Again.
"It's very frustrating because
everybody plays so well and so
hard and we don't get the victory.

Twice this season John Hopkins has kicked late-game field goals to put the Cardinal ahead, only to see
the team lose both games. The Senior from Texas is frustrated, but remains optimistic about Stanford's
chances for the coming year.
We definitely deserve to be win
ning as much as UCLA or any
body else does." Hopkins said.
"It was harder to take after the
week before because we came out
at the Colorado game and even
though we lost we were winning
the whole game, we let one slip
away. We knew we were just not
going to let that happen again. It
wasn't even that we were going to
beat UCLA but we were going to
crush them."
It was also more difficult to
swallow than the previous defeat
because the Cardinal appeared to
be dominating the game as late as
the third quarter, when with only
four minutes remaining in the pe
riod Stanford led by two touch
downs -21-7 and had limited
the Bruins to 134 total yards. Of
fensively, Stanford had already
equaled last years's highest sin
gle-game touchdown output, and
for the defense's credit UCLA's
starting quarterback Jim Bonds
had been so smothered offensively
that Bruin fans booed as he left
the Rose Bowl field at halftime.
The impact of one freak play on
the final score didn't make the
loss any easier to accept.
Maddox's 36-yard touchdown
pass to Bryan Adams with just
under six minutes to play gave the
Bruins a 27-28 score in what ap
peared to be a routine touchdown,
capped off by a PAT attempt to tie
the game.
Daluiso's kick, however, was
blocked by sophomore defensive
sensation Frank Busalacchi.
Bad luck, or fate, or something
took over.
While Cardinal defenders cele
brated, the ball bounced along the

field, right into the outstretched
arms of UCLA's kick-holder, none
other than the former backup-sig
nal caller Maddux. The redshirt
freshman quickly looked to the
end-zone where tight end Rick
Daly just happened to be stand
ing. All alone. Two point conver
sion. 29-28 UCLA lead.
Not only wasn't the Cardinal
kick defense ready for the Bruin
response, it wasn't aware that an
opponent was allowed to execute
such a play.
"I didn't understand what was
going on," kick-blocking specialist
Le said. "I thought it was over. I
didn't know you could throw the
ball after a blocked extra point."
While Coach Denny Green
didn't argue with the validity of
the play, he did protest the legality
of the Bruin formation during the
pass, to no avail. "I can't under
stand how they didn't have a cou
ple of guys cross the line of scrim
mage, but the official said they
didn't so I have to take his word
for it.
Whatever the components, for
the second time in as many weeks
Hopkins and Co. were left holding
their heads in disbelief and dis
may as the clock hit 0:00. Two up
set victories so close the players
could almost feel them. Two de
feats. An 0-2 record. An 0-1 Pacif
ic Ten Conference tally.
But for the second time the
players also gleaned the positive
from the loss, and vowed not to
give up or linger on the frustrat
ing outcome.
For starters, the offense
clicked. 386 yards. Five scoring
drives. 31 points. Quarterback Ja
son Palumbis threw two touch
down passes while 24 of 31 passes
foar 231 yards. Glyn Milburn was
more of his spectacular self, twist
ing and breaking tackles for 75
yards and bringing in another 34.

Fullback Tommy Vardell bullied
for 59 yards and two scores. And
Ed McCaffrey was back.
