# Trojans remain the popular collegiate choice
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The match-up in the Rose Bowl
the past few years has gotten very
predictable. In each of the past
three season, the USC Trojans
have met a Big Ten team from the
state of Michigan.
The advent of the 1990 football
season serves as the starting point
for another race for the Roses in
the Pacific 10 Conference. But
while this season begins a new
decade, it will probably bring
something other than a new re
sult.
Under the direction of Coach
Larry Smith USC is 21-1-1 in
league play and enters 1990 as the
West Coast favorite to be playing
in Pasadena come Jan. 1. But
while Smith appears to be build
ing himself a dynasty in La-La
Land, the rest of the league is
helping dissolve the perception
that Pac-10 football is nothing but
a bunch of pass-happy teams that
score 35 points every week and
lose anyway.
Last year Pac-10 teams went 4-
0 in bowl games, the only confer
ence to be perfect. In fact, the Pac
-10 was the only league to have a
winning record in postseason con
tests. And with several premier
players back this year, the confer
ence should again be one of the
best.
Although USC seems to be the
clear-cut favorite to run off with
the league title, the Trojans have
several pursuers, which should
make for a season full of interest
ing games. Here, then, is a sum
mary of the competition, complete
with projected league finish,
record (through games of Sept.

15) and AP ranking (Sept. 18
poll), if applicable:
• 1. use (2-0, No. 5)
The Trojans only returned
nine starters from the team that
won the Rose Bowl last year, in
cluding only two from their domi
nant defense. With split end John
Jackson and fullback Leroy Holt
graduating and linebacker Junior
Seau and safety Mark Carrier
turning pro early, they appear to
have suffered too much in the way
of losses to repeat.
But the reason USC has been
so good the past few years is
depth. Plus, with all-Pac-10 quar
terback Todd Marinovich and
1,269-yard rusher Ricky Ervins
back, their offense will be just as
explosive.
The defense has two-time all
league linebacker Scott Ross lead
ing the way. He didn't get the
press Seau did last year but is an
outstanding player. His new run
ning mates got off to a good start
against Syracuse in the Kickoff
Classic and the defense will at
least be one of the league's best,
although not as good as last
year's.
• 2. Washington (2-0, No. 21)
The Huskies finished tied for
second in league play last season
for what seemed like the millionth
year in a row. With Don James,
the league's winningest coach
ever, at the helm, the Huskies
have always been a good, solid
team and this year will be no ex
ception.
They lost a lot of experienced
players on both sides of the ball
(quarterback Cary Conklin, cen
ter Bern Brostek, end Dennis,

Brown and safety Eugene
Burkhalter), but return a solid
corps of players. Offensively they
have four Beturning starters on
the line, mitigating the loss of
Brostek to the NFL, and tailback
Greg Lewis is also back.
The biggest problem appears to
be a quarterback. Sophomore
Mark Brunell replaced Conklin
and ran for 64 yards against San
Jose State in the opener but he
was a miserable 7-for-27 for 66
yards through the air.
Defensively the front seven are
a strength, evidenced by San Jose
State's 42 yards on 36 carries, but
the secondary is inexperienced.
• 3. Arizona (2-0, No. 18)
Even since an experiment with
a hybrid run-and-shoot/wishbone
offense a couple years back, Ari
zona has been slowly mutating
into a Big 8 team. They have a
running quarterback, a stable of
running backs and throw the ball
only in case of emergency.
That strategy, even though it
doesn't have a cute name like the
wish-and-shoot, has proven quite
sound and the Wildcats went ta
the Copper BBwl last year and de
feated North Carolina State. This
year they are looking to improve
one notch upon their second-place
finish in league play and reach the
Rose Bowl for the first time ever.
They only have two offensive
linemen returning who started
last year, but backs Reggie McGill,
Mario Hampton and Art
Greathouse give the Wildcats at
least as talented and deep a back
field as any other team in the con
ference. Quarterback Ronnie Veal


Benjlmeri Tong — Daily
UCLA QB Tommy Maddox had a big day against Stanford last week,
but even after beating the Cardinal, UCLA will not be smelling any
roses this year The Bruins should improve on their 3-7-1 record of
last year, but should finish around the middle of Pac-10 standings.
is not an accomplished passer but
he can lead the ground attack.
Defensively Arizona struggled
against the run last year and los
ing four starters off their front
seven won't help. But the
seondary, led by Jeff Hammer
schmidt, who is trying to return
from knee surgery, should be a
strength.
• 4. Stanford (0-2, No. 41)
see page 3
• 5. Oregon (2-0, No. 34)
All talk about the Ducks in
1990 begins with Bill Musgrave.
The senior signal-caller is writing
his way further into the Pac-10

record books with every game he
plays this season and the Oregon
offense will live and die on his
arm.
He led the league in passing
touchdowns and yardage last year
and is showing evßry sign of re
peating. He threw for 443 yards
and three touchdowns and ran for
another score to lead the Ducks
over San Diego State in their
opener.
Unfortunately for the rest of
their offense, their starting run
ning backs from last year graduat
ed, their top receiver graduated,
their tight end graduated and
three of their five offensive line
men graduated.
Defensively they lost a lot from
their front seven but have several
players ready to step in. Their sec
ondary will not bounce back so

quickly, however.
• 6. Arizona State (2-0, No. 23)
During the offseason Arizona
State put out a media blitz touting
quarterback Paul Justin and safe
ty Nathan LaDuke for all sorts of
honors. Justin threw for a lot of
yards last year but won't have
many of the same receivers back
for 1990. Meanwhile the ground
game is suspect and the offensive
fine needs rebuiding.
• 7. UCLA (1-1, No. 30)
After a 3-7-1 season and the
graduation of 13 starters, the
Bruins got voted into the presea
son top 20. Why? No one knows.
But they certainly didn't look like
a-top-20 team in a thumping at
the hands of Oklahoma.
Thßir running game was

nonexistent, their passing game
was inconsistent and they are still
looking to replace four starters on
the offensive line. Meanßhile
their secondary is strong, but they
gave up 299 yards on the ground
to the Sooners. Another long sea
son looms.
* 8. California (1-1)
The Bears looked fairly impres
sive in their season-opening win
over Wisconsin, but that doesn't
say much. They do, however, hav
ing the makings of a fine ground
attack, and the passing game
should be decent with wideout
Brian Treggs around.
Defensively they have a couple
of players who can get into the op
ponent's backfield and cause some
havoc. They just can't do it on a
consistent enough basis.

• 9. Washington State (1-2)
The Cougars began last season
with a 6-1 record and were think
ing Rose Bowl. After losing their
last four games of the season,
however, things are looking up no
more.
Star runner Steve Broussard is
in the NFL, their defensive front
six all graduated and their three
top receivers are gone. Quarter
backs Brad Gossen and Aaron
Garcia are both pretty good but
they need more people to throw to
or hand off to. Playing four
straight road games in league
doesn't help either.
• 10. Oregon State (0-3)
The Beavers lost by 26 to
Kansas two weeks ago. Enough
said.
