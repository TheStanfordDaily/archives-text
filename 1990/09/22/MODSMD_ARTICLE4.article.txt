# The 						best 0-2 team?
## Two last second defeats demand that the Cardinal put together a 60-minute game

More significantly, five points
and 13 seconds separate the Stan
ford Cardinal from an undefeated
season. The team led then sixth
ranked Colorado 14-0 after the
half and 17-14 late in the fourth
quarter. Colorado won 21-17
when Eric Bieniemy dove over
Jono Tunney and into the end
zone with 12 seconds left. Last
weekend, Stanford led UCLA 14-7

Stanford University has a good
football team. In fact, they are the
best 0-2 team in the country.
Don't look at the record. Such
figures tell you that the Cardinal
has fallen out of the national
championship race; they don't tell
you if the team is talented or not.

after the half and 31-29 with 1:49
remaining only to lose 32-31 with
ONE second showing on the
board.
All this tells us two things:
Stanford should petition the
NCAA for 30 minute games, and
this squad is one competitive and
exciting, but winless, football
team.
"We've had opportunities to
win both of our games," Cardinal
Head Coach Denny Green said. "I
thought we played solid run de
fense against UCLA.. Our long
pass defense, particularly in the
second half, broke down. They
went to the shot-gun and we
didn't get much of a pass rush on
(Bruin QB Tommy) Maddox. He
had too much time to throw."
The Cardinal defense has so far
dictated the team's fate. Against
Colorado, the Buffaloes couldn't
buy a third-down conversion in
the first half and were subse
quently shut out. In the second
half, however, and in particular in
the last three minutes, Colorado
converted on critical third and
long situations and won the game.
In the same manner, Stanford led
UCLA for most of of the game,
but let the Bruins drive within
field goal range in the last 1:14
and again lost a game they should
have won.
"There is no magic formula,"
Green said. "Top twenty teams
will not give up until the gun goes
off. Our next step is our ability to
compete start to finish, putting
away an opponent when they are
down."
The Cardinal defense cannot
shoulder all the blame for the
team's inability to put away oppo
nents. As much as the defense
gives up points, they also allow
the offense enough time on the
field to get points. Stanford leads
their opponents in time of posses
sion by almost 18 minutes.
The defense has been effective,
except that they have been falter
ing at the end of the game. Part of
this downfall can be attributed to
youth; Stanford's starting defense
against UCLA included eight
sophomores (six of the seven line

men), one junior and two seniors.
Sophomore free safety Seyon Al
bert leads the team with an aver
age of 12.0 tackles a game, and se
nior linebacker Jono Tunny and
sophomore transfer Ron George
create one of the strongest
linebacker pairs in the Pac-10, if
not the country.
The Stanford offense has been
on the field for an extended period
of time for two reasons: the de
fense gives them the time and
Denny Green puts out a con
trolled attack. The offense re
volves around all-purpose player
Glyn Milburn and senior All-
America candidate Ed McCaffrey.
Milburn is averaging 162 yards
a game in all-purpose yards, good
enough for second in the Pacific
10 Conference and 12th in the na
tion. The Oklahoma transfer does
it all, running out of the backfield,
receiving after lining up in the
backfield, and returning punts
and kicks. Colorado's All America
linebacker, Alfred Williams, said
that Milburn was "the fastest
back I've ever played against. He's
just super fast." Pretty impressive
considering that Williams faced
another speedy all-purpose back,
Notre Dame's Heisman Hopeful
Raghib "Rocket" Ismail, in last
year's Orange Bowl.
It's a secure bet that when Mil
burn doesn't get the ball, McCaf
frey will. "Easy Ed" sat out the
Cardinal's opener against Col
orado, and junior Jason Palumbis
was forced to throw short balls
the whole afternoon. With McCaf
frey back in the offense, Palumbis
had a long ball threat and the two
upperclassmen connected nine
times for 123 yards and two
touchdowns. McCaffrey is the
Pac-10's returning leader in re

ceiving yardage and will challenge
his total of 871 yards (on 53 catch
es) set last year. Denny Green is
glad to have him back in the line
up.
"Ed has a chance to be one of
the top receivers in the country,"
said the second-year coach. "Of
fensively, we're much improved
with [him] in the lineup. He is a
legitimate Ail-American candi
date."
McCaffrey will have an easy
path to that honor if Palumbis is
able to keep getting him the ball.
The junior from Oregon has so far
been able to connect on 64 percent
of this passes and averages almost
10 yards a completion. Yet, with
Palumbis averaging only about 30
attempts a game, and, with the
talent in the Cardinal backfield,
the team cannot be described as
pass happy.
Miami transfer Ellery Roberts
teams up with Tommy Vardell and
Jon Volpe to back up Glyn Mil
burn's speed with muscle. Vardell
had a career high 15 carries
against UCLA and scored two
touchdowns for the first time in
his career. The oft-injured back
field of last year has given way to
arguably the best rushing core in
the Pac-10.
This team can do it both on of
fense and on defense. If they can
put together a complete game, the
string of losses will be broken, and
a bowl bid is not as funny as it
may sound to Cardinal football
fans. Due to one of the toughest
schedules in all Division I football,
Stanford's road to a successful
season will not get easier, but, un
doubtedly, with a few more games
under its belt, it should get
brighter.
Say good-bye to 0-2.

Our next step is... to compete
start to finish...
Denny Green

The Stanford offense is off and running this season, and is looking
for their first win. After heartbreaking last second losses to Colorado
and UCLA, Tommy Vardell (above) and company are hoping to crush
Oregon State.
