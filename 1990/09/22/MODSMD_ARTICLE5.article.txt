# Oregon State hard-pressed to find victory

All is not well in Corvallis, but
Oregon State University football
coach Dave Kragthorpe remains
undaunted.
"As I have said before during
this last frustrating three-week
period ... we need to get in there
and find the good things and cor
rect the bad things and build on
the good things," Kragthorpe
said.
Entering today's contest with
Stanford, the mighty Beavers are
0-3 and searching for positive
points. OSU began the season by
losing to Division I-AA Montana
22-15 and seems not to have fully
recovered. They have been out
played, being out-rushed, out
passed and outscored 105-47 so
far this season.
In addition to Montana, peren
nial winner Kansas (5-17 the last
two years) thrashed the Beavers
38-12, and UNLV glitzed their
way to a 45-20 victory. It is un
clear if the Rebel's rookie football
coach bites on a towel, but it's safe
to say that Las Vegas' National
Championship hopes remain in
doors.
The Beavers' lack of defensive
strength is not surprising since
they are missing the heart and
soul of their line, Lombardi Award
and Outland Trophy candidate
Eresa Tuaolo. A preseason All-
America pick, Tuaolo has received
nothing but praise for his play pri
or to this season.
"Oregon State is pushing him
for all kinds of honors and he has

my vote," Kansas head coach Glen
Mason said. "I saw how he per
formed against Nebraska last year
on film when we were getting
ready to play them. I have seen a
lot of so called great players play
against Nebraska, but I haven't
seen anyone play as well as he did
last year."
The problem is that Tuaolo has
not made any great plays since
last year.
Tuaolo suffered a ligament
knee sprain in OSU's final presea
son scrimmage on August 24, and,
almost a month later, is still ques
tionable. Without Tuaolo helping
to clog up the middle, opponents
have out-rushed the Beavers at a
2-1 rate, as well as holding onto
the ball for a longer period. This
stat does not bode well for the
Beavers, considering OSU will be
facing a balanced Cardinal rush
ing game featuring the talents of
Glyn Milburn, Ellery Roberts,
Tommy Vardell, Jon Volpe, and
Jay Jay Lasley.
Add to this defensive woe the
fact that the Beavers average
passing yards per game is also less
than their opponents, 210.3 yards
to 162.3 yards, and the Beavers
could be in trouble today. Stan
ford's passing attack was rejuve
nated after the Colorado game
with the return of Ed McCaffrey.
McCaffrey caught 9 passes for 123
yards and two touchdowns as
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis connected on 21 passes
on 32 attempts for 231 yards.

OSU hopes to run away with today's game, but don't bet on it. The Beavers are 0-3 and have been out
scored 105-47 this season.
