# Oregon State hard-pressed to find victory
## 
### T.C. Hall Editorial Staff 
All is not well in Corvallis, but
Oregon State University football
coach Dave Kragthorpe remains
undaunted.
"As I have said before during
this last frustrating three-week
period ... we need to get in there
and find the good things and cor
rect the bad things and build on
the good things," Kragthorpe
said.
Entering today's contest with
Stanford, the mighty Beavers are
0-3 and searching for positive
points. OSU began the season by
losing to Division I-AA Montana
22-15 and seems not to have fully
recovered. They have been out
played, being out-rushed, out
passed and outscored 105-47 so
far this season.
In addition to Montana, peren
nial winner Kansas (5-17 the last
two years) thrashed the Beavers
38-12, and UNLV glitzed their
way to a 45-20 victory. It is un
clear if the Rebel's rookie football
coach bites on a towel, but it's safe
to say that Las Vegas' National
Championship hopes remain in
doors.
The Beavers' lack of defensive
strength is not surprising since
they are missing the heart and
soul of their line, Lombardi Award
and Outland Trophy candidate
Eresa Tuaolo. A preseason All-
America pick, Tuaolo has received
nothing but praise for his play pri
or to this season.
"Oregon State is pushing him
for all kinds of honors and he has

my vote," Kansas head coach Glen
Mason said. "I saw how he per
formed against Nebraska last year
on film when we were getting
ready to play them. I have seen a
lot of so called great players play
against Nebraska, but I haven't
seen anyone play as well as he did
last year."
The problem is that Tuaolo has
not made any great plays since
last year.
Tuaolo suffered a ligament
knee sprain in OSU's final presea
son scrimmage on August 24, and,
almost a month later, is still ques
tionable. Without Tuaolo helping
to clog up the middle, opponents
have out-rushed the Beavers at a
2-1 rate, as well as holding onto
the ball for a longer period. This
stat does not bode well for the
Beavers, considering OSU will be
facing a balanced Cardinal rush
ing game featuring the talents of
Glyn Milburn, Ellery Roberts,
Tommy Vardell, Jon Volpe, and
Jay Jay Lasley.
Add to this defensive woe the
fact that the Beavers average
passing yards per game is also less
than their opponents, 210.3 yards
to 162.3 yards, and the Beavers
could be in trouble today. Stan
ford's passing attack was rejuve
nated after the Colorado game
with the return of Ed McCaffrey.
McCaffrey caught 9 passes for 123
yards and two touchdowns as
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis connected on 21 passes
on 32 attempts for 231 yards.

less, Kragthorpe respects his op
ponent.
"Stanford is a good football
team," Kragthorpe said. "The ad
dition of (Glyn) Milburn in the
backfleld makes Stanford much
stronger. They are getting steady
quarterbacking from Palumbis
now that he has had his surgery. A
year of maturity of a pretty young
football team also makes them
much better. They have lost two
very tough football games to good
opponents."
The Beavers hope to present
Stanford with a third good oppo
nent, and their chances ride on
the shoulders of senior quarter
back Matt Booher. Emerging from
the shadow of OSU's NFL draft
pick Erick Wilhelm, the senior
from West St. Paul, Minnesota,
proved a decent successor. Booher
showed flashes of brilliance last
year, directing OSU to come-from
behind victories against UCLA
and California, and showcased
fourth quarter drives, and in the
California game Booher had a
school-record 15 straight comple
tions. Booher finished the game
20 for 27 garnering 270 yards and
a touchdown, and at the end of
the season was rewarded by being
named honorable mention All-
Pacifc 10 Conference.
"Matt is what I call a 'blue-col
lar worker' as a quarterback, one

of the last guys to come out of the
weight room, and things that you
don't normally see in a quarter
back," Kragthorpe said. "I think
he is a fine leader, and that's been
verified by the players themselves
as they have elected him as one of
the team captains. I think Matt
will have a fine senior year."
If "fine" means good (but not
great), then Booher is right on
course. The Beaver QB has hit 41
of 74 passes for 345 yards and a
55% completion rate. Booher's
game will depend a lot on Maurice
Wilson getting open. Wilson was a
Freshman Ail-American last year,
and this year is averaging 10
yards a catch. Wilson's impor
tance was evident in the Beaver's
last game. The sophomore had no
catches against UNLY and though
Booher was 10 for 13 he only
amassed 73 yards.
If the passing attack falters,
the Beavers are not afraid to go to
the ground. Fullback James Jones
ran for 95 yards on 19 carries last
week, and tailback Reggie Pitch
ford is averaging 5.3 yards a carry,
and has a long run of 39 yards to
his credit. Jones and Pitchford
will probably see a lot of action as
OSU's pass protection is suspect.
Although not sacked last week,
Booher has been brought down 13
times this season, losing 91 yards
in the process.
Oregon State certainly has a lot
of bad things to correct if it hopes
to get better. The question is: do
they have enough good things to
build upon to beat Stanford?

period ... we need to get in there
and find the good things and cor
rect the bad things and build on
the good things," Kragthorpe
said.
Entering today's contest with
Stanford, the mighty Beavers are
0-3 and searching for positive
points. OSU began the season by
losing to Division I-AA Montana
22-15 and seems not to have fully
recovered. They have been out
played, being out-rushed, out
passed and outscored 105-47 so
far this season.
In addition to Montana, peren
nial winner Kansas (5-17 the last
two years) thrashed the Beavers
38-12, and UNLV glitzed their
way to a 45-20 victory. It is un
clear if the Rebel's rookie football
coach bites on a towel, but it's safe
to say that Las Vegas' National
Championship hopes remain in
doors.
The Beavers' lack of defensive
strength is not surprising since
they are missing the heart and
soul of their line, Lombardi Award
and Outland Trophy candidate
Eresa Tuaolo. A preseason All-
America pick, Tuaolo has received
nothing but praise for his play pri
or to this season.
"Oregon State is pushing him
for all kinds of honors and he has

my vote," Kansas head coach Glen
Mason said. "I saw how he per
formed against Nebraska last year
on film when we were getting
ready to play them. I have seen a
lot of so called great players play
against Nebraska, but I haven't
seen anyone play as well as he did
last year."
The problem is that Tuaolo has
not made any great plays since
last year.
Tuaolo suffered a ligament
knee sprain in OSU's final presea
son scrimmage on August 24, and,
almost a month later, is still ques
tionable. Without Tuaolo helping
to clog up the middle, opponents
have out-rushed the Beavers at a
2-1 rate, as well as holding onto
the ball for a longer period. This
stat does not bode well for the
Beavers, considering OSU will be
facing a balanced Cardinal rush
ing game featuring the talents of
Glyn Milburn, Ellery Roberts,
Tommy Vardell, Jon Volpe, and
Jay Jay Lasley.
Add to this defensive woe the
fact that the Beavers average
passing yards per game is also less
than their opponents, 210.3 yards
to 162.3 yards, and the Beavers
could be in trouble today. Stan
ford's passing attack was rejuve
nated after the Colorado game
with the return of Ed McCaffrey.
McCaffrey caught 9 passes for 123
yards and two touchdowns as
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis connected on 21 passes
on 32 attempts for 231 yards.

less, Kragthorpe respects his op
ponent.
"Stanford is a good football
team," Kragthorpe said. "The ad
dition of (Glyn) Milburn in the
backfleld makes Stanford much
stronger. They are getting steady
quarterbacking from Palumbis
now that he has had his surgery. A
year of maturity of a pretty young
football team also makes them
much better. They have lost two
very tough football games to good
opponents."
The Beavers hope to present
Stanford with a third good oppo
nent, and their chances ride on
the shoulders of senior quarter
back Matt Booher. Emerging from
the shadow of OSU's NFL draft
pick Erick Wilhelm, the senior
from West St. Paul, Minnesota,
proved a decent successor. Booher
showed flashes of brilliance last
year, directing OSU to come-from
behind victories against UCLA
and California, and showcased
fourth quarter drives, and in the
California game Booher had a
school-record 15 straight comple
tions. Booher finished the game
20 for 27 garnering 270 yards and
a touchdown, and at the end of
the season was rewarded by being
named honorable mention All-
Pacifc 10 Conference.
"Matt is what I call a 'blue-col
lar worker' as a quarterback, one

of the last guys to come out of the
weight room, and things that you
don't normally see in a quarter
back," Kragthorpe said. "I think
he is a fine leader, and that's been
verified by the players themselves
as they have elected him as one of
the team captains. I think Matt
will have a fine senior year."
If "fine" means good (but not
great), then Booher is right on
course. The Beaver QB has hit 41
of 74 passes for 345 yards and a
55% completion rate. Booher's
game will depend a lot on Maurice
Wilson getting open. Wilson was a
Freshman Ail-American last year,
and this year is averaging 10
yards a catch. Wilson's impor
tance was evident in the Beaver's
last game. The sophomore had no
catches against UNLY and though
Booher was 10 for 13 he only
amassed 73 yards.
If the passing attack falters,
the Beavers are not afraid to go to
the ground. Fullback James Jones
ran for 95 yards on 19 carries last
week, and tailback Reggie Pitch
ford is averaging 5.3 yards a carry,
and has a long run of 39 yards to
his credit. Jones and Pitchford
will probably see a lot of action as
OSU's pass protection is suspect.
Although not sacked last week,
Booher has been brought down 13
times this season, losing 91 yards
in the process.
Oregon State certainly has a lot
of bad things to correct if it hopes
to get better. The question is: do
they have enough good things to
build upon to beat Stanford?
