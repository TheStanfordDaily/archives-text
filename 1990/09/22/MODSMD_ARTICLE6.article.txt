# McCaffrey stretching out to reach team goals

### Michael Clayton Editorial staff 
After watching the insulting
theatrics and wincing at the self
proclaiming comments coming
from some of the top receivers in
the nation early this season, it is
refreshing to hear the soft-spo
ken, confident reflections of Stan
ford senior All-America candidate

Ed McCaffrey.
McCaffrey, after missing the
Cardinal's opening game against
Colorado due to an injury, jumped
into the upper echelons of the stat
sheets with his performance last
week at UCLA. McCaffrey fin
ished the afternoon with nine
grabs for 123 yards and two
touchdowns. Yet, instead of
trumping about his impressive

opening game, McCaffrey could
only shake his head and say, "I felt
OK about my performance. I did
what I had to do."
Hampered by muscle spasms in
his lower back which prevented
him from competing in Boulder
and fighting off the aches of
bruised ribs, McCaffrey was still
able to make an immediate impact
on the Cardinal offensive attack.

"McCaffrey's presence makes
us a better football team," Head
Coach Denny Green noted.
When McCaffrey steps on the
field alongside redshirt sopho
more standout Glyn Milburn, the
passing options for junior quar
terback Jason Palumbis multiply
greatly. Instead of being able to
key solely on Milburn, who has
pulled in 10 receptions and is a

constant threat to break loose for
a big gain, or on McCaffrey, who
has made a habit of pulling in dif
ficult throws, defenders must
keep an alert eye on both athletes.
"When Glyn comes out of the
backfield, we have the opportuni
ty to hit Glyn underneath or
sneak Ed in behind," Green said.
On numerous occasions in Los
Angeles, Palumbis found McCaf
frey's jersey a welcome target
above and behind the swarm of
baby blue defenders on the Rose
Bowl turf. Under intense pressure
from Bruin defenders in the third
quarter, Palumbis searched for his
lanky 6-foot-5 receiver in the back
of the end zone and placed the ball
in a spot where only McCaffrey
could produce the touchdown. In
stead of having to fire the ball into
a crowd, Palumbis heaved the ball
toward the end line and gave his
highly acclaimed teammate the
chance to stretch out and pull
down the pigskin.
"Ed is an impact player who
gives us a good chance to pass on
first and third down," Green ex
plained.
After finishing the 1989 season
fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference
with 53 receptions for 871 yards
and being tabbed honorable men
tion All-Pac-10, McCaffrey has en
tered the 1990 season followed by
high expectations. Football Digest
named him First-Team All-Amer
ica; The Sporting News chose him
as First-Team All-Pac-10, and list
ed him as the eighth best wide re
ceiver in the nation.
Finding his name in national
publications, however, is not a
novel experience for the Pennsyl
vania native. After his senior sea
son at Central Catholic High
School in Allentown, McCaffrey
was considered one of the best
high school prospects in the na
tion. He was a Parade All-America
as a tight end, and, according to
Max Emflnger's National High
School Scouting Service, McCaf

For ED McCaffrey, spectacular catches have become the norm rather than the exception. After sitting out the opening game at Colorado
because of injury, the pre-season All-America had nine catches for 123 yards and two TDs against UCLA last week and is looking to improve
on those numbers today.
frey was the fifth best tight end
and the 76th player overall in the
United States.
"Ed sets high standards of per
formance for himself," Green
said. "What sets him apart is that
he combines hard work with
clear-cut All-America potential."
McCaffrey made a rather quiet
entrance in 1986 under former
Cardinal Coach Jack Elway. For
his entire freshman season, Mc-
Caffrey recorded only two grabs.
In 1987, however, McCaffrey
burst into the Cardinal limelight.
He averaged 17.8 yards per catch
and pulled in 30 throws, earning
himself All-Pac-10 honorable
mention honors for the first time.
Now in his final season for the
Cardinal, McCaffrey has his
sights set on a winning season. In
particular, he would like to go un
defeated at home. With the young
team looking for leaders, McCaf
frey is in the natural position to
take credit for pushing the squad
towards success. Instead, unlike a
number of this nation's premier
receivers, McCaffrey does not look
for new vocabulary words to de
scribe his style.
"Ed's a quiet guy," Green said,
"but the other guys on the team
understand his type of leader
ship."
"Stanford players lead through
performance on and off the field,"
McCaffrey said.
