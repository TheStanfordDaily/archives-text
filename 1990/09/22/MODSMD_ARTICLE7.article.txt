# Coach Shaw rejuvenates Cardinal defense
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
The Colorado Buffaloes had
marched 69 yards to the Stanford
11-yard-line, and were poised to
sweep into the end zone for the
winning touchdown and avoid an
upset loss at the hands of the Car
dinal. The Stanford defense had
played valiantly, holding the Buffs
scoreless the entire first half, but
it looked as if the Cardinal effort
would fall short as Colorado
romped in for the easy TD.
Stanford defensive coordinator
Willie Shaw had other ideas.
What's more, with less than two
minutes left in the nationally-tele
vised game, he wasn't afraid to
use those ideas to stop the Buffs.
Shaw had watched Colorado all
game, and saw that they were
having trouble running the ball
outside, something that star op
tion quarterback Darian Hagan
executes as well as anyone in the
country. "In the past, they'd gone
outside on the goal line," Shaw
said, "but they decided based on
what we were doing to them in the
game to go inside. We had seven
tackles for losses, and they
weren't going to go outside down

there and risk a loss."
So Shaw improvised a defense
on the sidelines that keyed on the
inside, pinning the linebackers in
on the line of scrimmage. After
the game, senior linebacker Jono
Tunney said, "It was unlike any
thing we'd worked on all year. I'm
in awe of the guy."
Senior cornerback and All-
America candidate Kevin Scott is
the leader of the Cardinal defense,
but he had to admit that when
Shaw began changing the game
plan at the last minute, "I didn't
know what the hell was going on.
Every play, we were doing some
thing different.
"But he said 'Do it,' and we had
confidence in what he was say
ing," Scott said. "And it was work

It almost worked perfectly, but
Heisman Trophy candidate Eric
Bieniemy finally managed to
break the plane of the goal line on
fourth down, with 12 seconds left
in the game. The Buffaloes got the
touchdown and the win, but it was
close—a lot closer than they
would have liked it.
After the Cardinal's goal line
stand and all-around defense
against the Buffs, followed by an

other impressive defensive outing
against UCLA the following week,
there were probably a number of
people on both sidelines who
stood in awe of Shaw. They proba
bly also wondered just exactly
who was this brilliant new defen
sive mastermind.
However, few football fans real
ize that the unassuming Shaw, 46,
is not a young phenom, but rather
one of the most experienced de
fensive coaches in the country. He
came to Stanford last season from
the ranks of the National Football
League, where for four years he
coached a stingy Detroit Lions de
fense (second in the league in TDs
allowed, 1985 and 1986). Before
that, Shaw earned his stripes in
the college ranks, with stints at
Long Beach State, Oregon, Ari
zona State, and Stanford.
Yes, Stanford.
Like Head Coach Denny
Green, Shaw made a return trip
to the Farm last season, after a
journey through the college and
pro ranks. Don't feel too badly if
his name doesn't ring a bell,
though—Shaw was here back in
the 1974-1976 seasons.
While Green came back (for the
third time) as the head coach,

Shaw did not get a visible promo
tion when he returned. In fact,
the veteran coach left the NFL to
come back and coach the Cardinal
secondary, the very same job he
left thirteen years previously!
But this time around, Shaw
was a proven commodity. While at
ASU, Shaw's defensive corps led
the nation in pass and total de
fense in 1982. He then went on to
more success with the Lions. And
his decision to come back to Stan
ford, after interviewing with sev
eral pro teams, has proven a wise
one as he was named defensive co
ordinator this season, replacing
Fred vonAppen.
"I came back because I enjoyed
my years at Stanford, we had
some good football teams here,
and I like the area," Shaw said.
"And I really like Denny
Green—l'm good friends with
Denny."
Shaw got a taste of coaching in
the NFL, and returned to the col
lege game with an appreciation of
the differences between the col
leges and the pros. "It's like two
different sports. The people are
different," Shaw said. "I learned
more pure football in four years in
the pros than in 16 years in the

college game. Offenses, defenses
are more sophisticated, because
it's a job. When players come to
practice with their lunch bucket,
you know it's a job."
Like Green, who spent time
coaching for the San Francisco
49ers before returning to Stan
ford, Shaw knows the game well,
especially the defensive half. He
has been a player or a coach for
