# Stanford/OSU Matchups
## 
### 
The Cardinal fans will finally
get their chance to see Oklahoma
transfer Milburn perform on the
turf of Stanford Stadium after
reading the newspaper articles
and watching him cut and spin in
Colorado and Los Angeles. Mil
burn is always a threat to break
loose for a big gain and has racked
up an average of 162 all-purpose
yards in the first two games to put
him in the 12th spot nationally.
When he takes his position behind
the line, Milburn will be watched
closely by Slone, who, after a
rather mediocre 1989 season, has
surprised Oregon State fans by
recording a respectable 14 tackles.

With high expectations enter
ing into the 1990 season, Oregon
State quarterback Matt Booher
struggled early this season, being
sacked 13 times in the first two
games. Against UNLY he went 10
for 13 without being sacked,
showing a little more of the mobil
ity that made him effective last
season but still unable to produce
an effective passing attack.
Booher will be attempting to
prove that he can return to his
1989 form. Across the line, Tun
ney, the Cardinal's leading tackier
in 1989, will be looking for his
first sack of the season.

Frank Busalacchi has virtually
come out of nowhere and
established himself as the one of
the Cardinal's main defensive
threats. The 6-4, 276 pound nose
guard is big enough to clog up the
middle, but is quick enough to
pursue. Busalacchi seems to al
ways be around the ball, and is the
team's third leading tackier with
thirteen. Busalacchi should be
able to add to that total against
Jones, OSU's sophomore fullback
who had 95 yards on 19 carries
last week. Jones has a 3.52 GPA,
but if he and the Beaver staff are
smart, they will not try to run up
the middle.

After sitting out the opener
against Colorado, Ed McCaffery
came back big against UCLA, and
is ready to continue his quest for
All-America honors. The 6-5, 215
pound senior caught nine passes
last week for 123 yards and two
touchdowns, and will be looking
to improve upon that against
Davis. At 5-11, 173, Davis gives
away six inches and 42 pounds to
McCaffrey, who is known for his
acrobatic catches. If the Stanford
offense is to be fully effective, Mc-
Caffrey must get himself open.

Kevin Scott has come from be
hind the shadow of NFL draft
pick Alan Grant (now with the
Colts), and is making his presence
known in the backfield. Scott's
diving end-zone interception
against Colorado is the only take
away by air that the team has
recorded, and the senior has
shown an ability to break up the
long pass. Wilson was a freshman
All-America last year, and this
season is averaging over 10 yards
a catch. His importance to the
Beaver offense was shown last
week when he recorded zero
catches and the team had only 73
passing yards for the day.

If you need one point, John
Hopkins is a sure bet. The senior
from Texas has kicked 63 consec
utive PATs, breaking Mark Har
mon's school record of 59. Hop
kins is also 2-3 in the field goal de
partment including a 49 yarder
last week against UCLA. Hop
kins' leg strength is evidenced by
the fact that, in two games, Stan
ford has only faced two kick-off
returns. Burke on the other hand,
has yet to make a field goal, and is
3-4 on PATs.
