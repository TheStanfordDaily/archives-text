GEOLOGY 170:
The Cycles of System Earth
Human civilization is starting to cause serious changes in the earth's
atmosphere anil oceans, which may have long-term consequences to the
biosphere and perhaps even to our own survival. These changes can only be
comprehended within the context of the changes and the cycles that have
happened over the whole of earth's history. Geology 170 will be taught with a
new pmphasis this year. We will present some of the scientific tools needed to
begin to understand, and some of the observations that have been made about,
the origin and evolution of the atmosphere, the oceans, and of life.
Emphasizing geochemical cycles, we will develop models of ancient and
modern climates, and discuss the role of Homo Sapiens. Prerequisites: high
school chemistry and an interest in the earth sciences.
