"I became a Macintosh convert in business
school.
"At our computer lab I'd always find lines
of people waiting to use the Macintosh
computers, while the other computers just
sat there. So I had a choice: wait for a
Macintosh, or come back at 6 A.M. to grab
one before they'd all be taken.
'After business sch(X)l, I took a job at a
large bank and used my Macintosh for
producing everything from spreadsheets
to a company newsletter.
"Today 1 use Macintosh to help me
run my own management consult
ing firm. When 1 give a presenta
tion, I can see in people's
faces that they're really
impressed. And that makes
me feel great.
"Sometimes I take Friday
off, put my Macintosh and
skis in the car, and head for
the mountains. I ski days and
work nights. Its perfect.
"You know, I can't say
where 1 11 be in five, ten, or
fifteen years, but I can say
that my Macintosh will be
there with me."
Stop by Stanford Bookstore s
Microdisc Center to discuss
your computing needs with
Apple Representatives.
September 24-28,
11a.m.-4p.m.,
Pick up a free Apple cup (while

Why do people
love Macintosh?
Ask them.
