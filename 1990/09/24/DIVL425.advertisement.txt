What good is a student discount
if it's no good on holidays?
When an airline offers a student discount, be
sure to examine it carefully. Can the discount be
used during holiday breaks? Summer vaca
tions? Trips home or weekend trips? If not,
what good is it?
The TWA Getaway® Student Dis
count Card is available to students be
tween ages 16 and 26. It's good for 10%
off any TWA published fare (even our
lowest ones) for travel to more than
110 cities in the U. 5.—365 days a year.
Europe and the Middle East are available
at 10% off, too, with the exception of just a
few summer blackout dates. And there's
more good news. In most cases the savings
from just one roundtrip will more than cover
the cost of the card. A one-year card is just $15.
Students can earn free flights.
Any student can earn free flights in the TWA
Frequent Flight Bonus Program, because every
mile flown on M
TWA earns credit
toward valuable
travel awards.
And the miles
add up fast.
By graduation
time, there could
easily be a free
trip to Europe
—or a choice of
many other exciting destinations.
