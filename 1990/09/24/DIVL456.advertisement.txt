Taking transit once a week isn't just good for
your wallet. It's good for your world.
Think about it. If everyone took the bus or
light rail to work just one day a week, we'd
reduce the amount of cars on the road-and
the pollutants they emit-by 20%. Overnight.
And wouldn't that be a breath of fresh air.

Palo Alto: 415/965-3100. In South County:
