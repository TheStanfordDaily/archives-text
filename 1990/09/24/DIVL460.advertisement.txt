"YES, THERE IS
UFE AFTER
BREAST CANCER.
AND THAT'S THE
WHOLE POIHT."
-Ann Jillian
<m
A lot of women are so afraid of
breast cancer they don't want to
hear about it.
And that's what frightens me.
Because those women won't
practice breast self-examination
regularly.
Those women, particularly
those over 35, won't ask their doc
tor about a mammogram.
Yet that's what's required for
breast cancer to be detected
early. When the cure rate is 90%.
And when there's a good chance
it won't involve the loss of a
breast.
But no matter what it involves,
take it from someone who's been
through it all.
Life is just too wonderful to
give up on. And, as I found out,
you don't have to give up on any
of it. Not work, not play, not even
romance.
Oh, there is one thing, though.
You do have to give up being
afraid to take care of yourself.
