# Federal agencies investigating research costs here

### John Wagner Senior Staff writer 
Stanford is being investigated by two
federal agencies to determine if the Univer
sity has repeatedly overbilled the U.S. gov
ernment for overhead costs of federally
sponsored research here.
Both the Office of the Chief of Naval
Research, which reviews Stanford's
research costs, and a House subcommittee
are scrutinizing the process by which Stan
ford and the federal government determine
overhead costs.
Overhead, or indirect costs, are expendi
tures that are necessary to support a
research project but cannot be easily
attributed to a specific project. They

include expenses for facilities and their
maintenance, energy costs and use of Stan
ford's libraries by researchers.
When researchers apply for federal
grants, they must also request money for
overhead costs. In fiscal 1990, if a Stanford
professor wanted to perform $100,000
worth of research, he had to request an
additional $74,000 to cover indirect costs.
Stanford's indirect cost rate last year — 74
percent — was among the nation's highest.
If the investigations find that Stanford
has improperly billed the government for
past indirect costs, the University could be
forced to return the money. Citing
unnamed congressional sources, other Bay
Area media have reported that Stanford
could have overbilled the federal govern

ment by as much as $200 or $300 million
over the past 10 years.
University officials have dismissed these
figures and, in a statement, criticized the
media for reporting "unsubstantiated
claims as if they were fact."
In an interview with The Daily last
week, University President Donald
Kennedy called the federal agencies' allega
tions "sensational but vague." He said he
was confident that Stanford had not
engaged in any wrongdoing.
An internal audit of indirect costs at
Stanford began in late July. The results of
the audit should be released by the end of
this week, Kennedy said.
On the federal level, the Office of Naval
Research is reviewing the process Stanford

and the federal government use to negoti
ate indirect costs. Naval investigators are
trying to determine whether some cost for
mulas used in the development and negoti
ation of the rates have been "faulty" and
have resulted in "significant overpayment"
to the University, according to a naval office
statement.
All government-sponsored research
costs at Stanford and some other mcgor
institutions are subject to review by the
naval office, a branch of the Department of
Defense. Many other major research uni
versities are assigned to the Department of
Health and Human Services.
