# Early pregnancies are costing gov't billions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
federal government spent more
than $21.5 billion last year on wel
fare programs for families started
by teen-agers, a new study has
shown.
According to the report, this
amount is $1.7 billion higher than
for 1988. The increase is
attributed to inflation, the expan
sion of Medicaid benefits and an
increase in births to teen-agers.
The report is funded by the
Center for Population Options, a
private organization that concen
trates on world-wide population.
The figures in the report illus
trate the need for greater efforts
to prevent teen-age pregnancies.
Sex education, family planning
and counseling, support for delay
ing sexual activity, access to con
traception, and medical services
including abortion, are some sug
gestions of the report.
"We can no longer let our
youth stumble into parenting, a
course that should be embarked
on only when one is ready, willing
and able to become a parent," the
report stated.
It further claimed that early
childbearing will "often impover
ish ... the lives of girls brought
too soon into the rigors and

responsibilities of motherhood, of
boys bewildered and unable to
parent and provide adequately, of
babies not planned or welcomed."
According to the report, the
most alarming increases in teen
age pregnancies are occurring
among 15 to 17 year olds.
National Center for Health Statis
tics figures show that after a
downward trend in births among
this age group from 1970 into the
mid 1980s, the rate began increas
ing, jumping from 30.6 per 1,000
teen-agers in 1986 to 33.8 in 1988.
The report attributed a com
mon cause of teen-age pregnan
cies to the mother cutting short
her education, which increases
her chance of living in poverty and
needing public assistance.^
In estimating federal spending
on families started by teen-agers,
the center included families cur
rently headed by teen-age moth
ers as well as those in which the
mother is now 20 years or older
but had her first child when she
was a teen-ager.
This cost includes the federal
government's share for Aid for
Families with Dependent Chil
dren, Medicaid and food stamps
received by these families.
