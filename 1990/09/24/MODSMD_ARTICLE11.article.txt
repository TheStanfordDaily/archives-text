Gas prices hit all-time high
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gasoline prices have
hit an all-time high in the wake of the Persian
Gulf crisis, with the average pump price jumping
2.91 cents per gallon in two weeks, an industry
analyst said yesterday.
"The new high doesn't take into account infla
tion, but even so, it's significant," said Trilby
Lundberg, who publishes the Lundberg Letter.
She said her latest twice-monthly survey of
18,500 gasoline stations nationwide showed
motorists were paying an average of 138.35 cents
per gallon. The survey was conducted Friday.
The previous record high was just under 138
cents, set in March 1981, she said.
Liberian rebels to hold talks
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — Two rival
Liberian rebel commanders will meet Friday for
U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending the
country's grisly 9-month-old civil war, sources
said yesterday.
Rebel leader Charles Taylor and his former ally
Prince Johnson will meet in Freetown, Sierra
Leone, for talks that U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Herman Cohen arranged in meetings with
the two last week, said officials from the West
African Economic Community
Taylor — who insists he is acting president of
Liberia — declared a unilateral cease-fire Satur
day in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. In an
apparent bargaining tactic, he announced yester
day he wanted to hold elections Oct. 10. The

cease-fire has been respected so far, observers
said.
While commanding the largest force in Liberia,
Taylor's youthful army has been unable to cap
ture Monrovia, and hi 3 forces would be at the
mercy of the powerful West African armies should
they intervene more forcefully in Liberia.
Corruption trial for ousted PM
LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — A special court
ordered ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to
stand trial next month on charges of corruption
and misconduct during her 20 months in power.
Justice Rashid Aziz Khan issued the notice to
Bhutto, saying the army-backed caretaker govern
ment had sufficient evidence to support its claim.
He ordered the civil proceedings to start Oct. 2.
If convicted, Bhutto could be disqualified from
the Oct. 24 election and barred from politics for up
to seven years.
Bhutto, 37, won the election in November 1988
and took office a month later as the first woman to
lead a modern Moslem nation. She now is a candi
date for five seats in the 217-member National
Assembly, the law-making lower house of Parlia
ment.
Bhutto has previously said she would not
appear before the special one-judge tribunals,
which were originally set up following the 1977
military coup that toppled her father, the late
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The tribunals
were resurrected last month by the caretaker gov
ernment made up largely of her opponents and
former allies.
