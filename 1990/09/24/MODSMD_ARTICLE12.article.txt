## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Editor's welcome 
### 
PRODUCT LABELING has
been one of the most
notable trends in American
consumerism during the past two
decades.
From cigarettes to alcohol, diet
foods to McDonald's hamburgers,
the goods we use have been
wrapped in labels telling us what
the ingredients are, how the prod
uct was made and what the results
of extended use can be.
Unfortunately but perhaps not
surprisingly, this trend has not
extended to one of the most impor
tant and abundant things we con
sume: information.
Those who produce our televi
sion news broadcasts, our weekly
magazines and our daily newspa
pers have not done as much as they
could to tell their consumers about
the way in which the news the con
sumer sees is put together. There
are no warning labels, rare dis
claimers and precious few honest
discussions of how the news is
made and sold.
It's ironic that the American
press, the very institution that
claims to defend the public's right
to know the truth, has been one of
the most reluctant of institutions
to turn its attention inward, exam
ine its own practices — and let the
consumers of its product know
what it is they're getting.
One of our goals for Volume 198
of The Daily is to improve that per
formance — to open even wider the
lines of dialogue with our readers
and more fully discuss the work we
do. Some of the basics:
The product you hold in your
hands is a necessarily incomplete
and somewhat rushed account of
what has been happening at Stan
ford, in the surrounding commu
nity and in our nation and world
over the past few days. It is pro
duced entirely by students, most of
them undergraduates, most of
them taking classes full-time.
Each person brings a personal

perspective to the work he or she
does, and each is limited by the
demands of time and stamina that
press upon all in the journalism
business.
Further, those who produce The
Daily come from a broad range of
backgrounds and widely varying
levels of experience. We are com
mitted to maintaining The Daily as
an educational institution as much
as it is a journalistic institution;
any student is invited to work at
the paper, and no experience or
classwork is required.
It could be argued that these
things are undesirable because
they, to various degrees, hinder the
production of a professional-look
ing newspaper. But we value our
position as an independent student
newspaper, as an organization that
ultimately aims to develop the tal
ents of its members and as a cam
pus group that welcomes students
of all backgrounds to participate in
the work about which we care so
deeply.
We're always striving to improve
the quality of our work, and we're
always looking for your input. I
encourage you to take an active
role this year in the communica
tion of ideas at Stanford — by
responding to the content of our
pages and letting us know how we
can better serve you.
At the same time, we'll be reach
ing out in new ways to bring more
of our readers into our pages and
better communicate the 'how' and
'why' of the work we do for the
Stanford community.
Thanks — we'll be talking.
