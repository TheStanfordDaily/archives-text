University bills
students unfairly
It's great to see someone finally tak
ing Escondido Village maintenance to
task about cleaning charges ("Student
questions Escondido bill," Aug. 16). I
have had several similar experiences that
underline the less than kosher way that
Escondido Village handles cleaning
charges.
When I moved out of an Escondido
Village high-rise two years ago, I spent
considerable time cleaning, but received
a cleaning bill for $15 anyway. Near as I
could tell from talking to others, every
one who moved out was similarly billed.
This charge was especially ludicrous
as work crews came in immediately
afterwards and tore up the bathrooms
and kitchens for "conversion to married
student housing." I contacted the Escon
dido Village office and demanded to
know why I was being billed. I was told
that there was cleaning that was done. I
told them that I wanted to know what
cleaning was done. They said they'd look
into it.
After two weeks of calling to find
what had been found, they told me that
the charges had been dropped. I never
did get an answer to what cleaning, or, I
suspect, lack thereof, I had been billed
for.
This past spring, after my roommates
moved out of my Manzanita trailer, a
work crew came through inspecting for
needed cleaning. Later, the cleaners
came. They left soap scum all over the
Elace, didn't clean all the places that I'd
eard the inspectors calling out and left
my front door standing open all day after
they left (after I'd explicitly told them to
lock up when they left).
I have to wonder why Glenn Carroll,
the graduate housing facilities manager,
can so easily say that the University
"usually recovers less than what is paid

out, and the difference is covered by the
rent the students pay."
Somehow, I can't see that as anything
more than a symptom of the deadly
bloaticus bureaucraticus, more com
monly known as university bureaucrats
taking the easy, if not particularly fair,
route to covering their butts when a
problem arises.
With all these cleaners, inspectors and
official university paperwork forms that
are mentioned, it shouldn't be too terri
bly difficult to bill people for what it
costs to clean up their mess. When I
spend hours cleaning places I move out
of and put up with dirt in the places I
move into, I feel more than a little
insulted that my rent is partitioned to
pay for this non-cleaning, and that my

tuition helps pay salaries of people that
are in charge of this scam.
Mo/e power to you, Tom Berger, for
questioning your bill. Make the weasels
squirm a little for the rest of us they've
ripped off.

East Palo Alto,
not Palo Alto East
I am writing in response to a feature
article in the Aug. 23 Stanford Weekly
("Hopes for a thriving future in a trou
bled city") regarding East Palo Alto.
While I commend the writer and The
Weekly for devoting some time and space
to a very important neighboring commu
nity, I think there needs to be a greater
understanding of how potential redevel
opment can affect a community such as
East Palo Alto.
The article briefly discusses East Palo
Alto's hope that the development of twin
office towers and new retail space will
spur residents to spend more money
within the limits of their own city.
It's important to realize, however,
that these new offices will be occupied by
firms moving from other cities in the
Bay Area into East Palo Alto, and that
the small businesses set up at this site
will cater to the employees of these
firms. Cappucino bars and copy centers
will set up shop, not the supermarkets or
hardware stores that city residents des
perately need.
But even more important is the fact
that the proposed redevelopment on the
Whiskey Gulch site entails the removal
of some 90 residental units and 50 busi
nesses. These are the businesses that
minority members of the community
have worked hard to establish and that
residents of the community have come to
identify as the symbols of East Palo
Alto's diversity and local flavor.
One East Palo Alto resident whose

business is threatened by this redevelop
ment calls the office tower project "Third
World business genocide." Thus the $77
million in economic leakage which East
Palo Alto city officials currently are wor
ried about is bound to increase dramati
cally with the removal of local businesses
and the establishment of new businesses
incompatible with the city's needs.
The city of East Palo Alto has pinned
all its hopes for future economic well
being on redevelopment. While there is
no denying that redevelopment may be
the most effective way to bolster the
city's tax revenues in order to afford cru
cial community services such as police,
the other side of redevelopment must be
acknowledged.
The development of twin office tow
ers, hotel and retail space in the Whisky
Gulch area may play a role in converting
East Palo Alto into a "Palo Alto East."
