## Questions for President Gorbachev 
### 
When the interviewer from Voice of
America called to ask about the most sig
nificant statements made at the Bush-
Gorbachev press conference (Sept. 9,
1990) this writer immediately thought of
the "secret" which the U.S.S.R. president
shared with us in response to his TASS
(Soviet government's news agency) corre
spondent's question.
Gorbachev revealed that the U.S. pres
ident had reversed a long-standing policy
which kept the Soviet Union out of Mid
dle East talks. Gorbachev added that no
single country can provide world leader
ship alone. Did he mean that the U.S.S.R.
now claims co-equal status with the
United States settling all international
disputes?
The reporter for Izvestiya then queried
Gorbachev about what he would do if mil
itary steps were taken against Iraq. The
Soviet leader responded sharply that he
had never said the U.S.S.R. would use its
armed forces in such a potential conflict.
Gorbachev repeated this in general terms
later during the question-and-answer
period, when he emphatically stated that
there was no point in applying military
power and that he would act within the
parameters of the U.N. Security Council.

Are we to understand that the U.S.S.R.
would vote against such a proposed reso
lution to use force and, thus, veto it?
When asked about military advisers
now in Iraq, Gorbachev stated that there
were only "experts and technicians" who
number about 150. They would be phased
out when their contracts expire. In actual
fact 1,350 members of the U.S.S.R. and
East European armed forces currently
train Iraqis in the use of some $26 billion
worth of weapons delivered since 1982 by
the Soviet Union. Not mentioned at all
were the 16,600 (half from the U.S.S.R.)
or so civilian "experts and technicians,"
some of whom just may not be involved
with military affairs. Does this mean the
8,000 Soviets will remain in Iraq?
Another question at the press confer
ence dealt with Western economic aid.
Gorbachev said it is superficial to suggest
that "the U.S.S.R. could be bought for
dollars." In other words, no quid pro quo
should be expected by the United States
and, indeed, none was offered at Helsinki.
Foreign aid is a one*way street, and the
West should feel honored that the Soviet
Union will accept it. Both the U.S. secre
taries of state and commerce left Helsinki
for Moscow together with 15 top Ameri-

In conclusion, this observer had the
distinct impression that questions from
Pravda and Moscow radio/TV reporters,
in addition to others mentioned abovek,
had been orchestrated for the puipose of
promoting Gorbachev's international
image as the world's "peace-maker," who
will continue to press for a political solu
tion and deal with Saddam Hussein as a
neutral intermediary, not as a firm ally of
the United States in the Gulf crisis.
Was it all worth the long flight from
Washington, D.C., to Helsinki and back?
