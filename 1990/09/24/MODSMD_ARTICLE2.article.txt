# Geiger going to Maryland

### Chris Crader Editorial Staff 
In a move that caught the Uni
versity entirely by surprise, Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger
announced this month he would
leave Stanford Oct.l to accept a
similar position at the University
of Maryland.
"I took it because I'm ready for
a change," Geiger said. "I'm at a
place in my life where I feel a new
challenge, a new opportunity — a
repotting if you like — is timely.
"I felt myself getting restless,"
he added. "The mood swings were
wider, the frustrations were more
bothersome. I was just starting to
get that feeling that I needed a
new congregation, and this con
gregation needed a new preacher."
Geiger leaves behind perhaps
the most successful athletic pro
gram in the nation, and he is the
one most responsible for that suc
cess. Since he replaced Joe Reutz
Jan. 1,1979, Stanford has won 27
national titles, more than any
other university.
But the latter part of the '80s
has seen Stanford's greatest suc
cesses. Stanford took home four
NCAA titles in 1985 and 1986 and
three apiece in 1987,1988 and
1989. No school won more
national championships in any of
those five years.
He leaves the West Coast
behind for a program that has
been rocked with scandal, espe
cially in the men's basketball pro
gram. Countless violations have
given the Terrapin basketball
team three years of probation, a
ban on post-season play for 1991
and 1992 and substantial recruit
ing restrictions.
Furthermore, earlier this
month Maryland basketball coach
Gary Williams received a year's
probation and a $250 fine after
pleading guilty to driving under
the influence of alcohol on the
night of May 13.
"The Maryland profile of the
last several years has been one of
tragedy, and I consider myself a
builder,'' Geiger said. "The fact
that they've had as much diffi
culty as they've had makes it a
very good opportunity.
"Right away at Maryland there
needs to be a building of trust
within the Athletic Department
and a pulling together," he said.
"Secondly, there needs to be a
stronger union between the Ath
letic Department and the rest of
the University. The third thing
that needs to happen is we have to
rally the state. We need to raise
money, build confidence and heal
the wounds."
Geiger strongly believes in a
broad-based athletic department,
as shown by Stanford's 27 varsity
sports, one of the nation's largest
programs. Despite budget prob
lems which led to the reduction of
the field hockey, sailing, and
wrestling teams to varsity 111 sta
tus, Geiger has said he regretted
having to do so.
He received a large amount of
criticism for firing football coach
Jack Elway in 1988, but under
