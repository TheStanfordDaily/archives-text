Conklin arrested for drug use
Diana Conklin, acting associate
dean of student affairs, was cited
and arrested by Palo Alto Police
June 24 for being under the influ
ence of cocaine in her residence.
The Santa Clara County
Municipal Court allowed her to
participate in a drug diversion
program, upon completion of
which the misdemeanor charge
against her will be dropped.
The University's initial
response to the incident was a
statement from Norm Robinson,
acting dean of student affairs,
which stressed the importance of
"not making judgments without
knowing the facts and considering
all pertinent factors."
Conklin explained her action in
a July 25 public statement, stat
ing she impulsively used cocaine
from an old vial that her husband
found while moving out of the
house due to their divorce. She
said the incident was the first
time in nine years that she had
taken the drug.
Conklin said she called the
police herself because she thought
she was "poisoned and dying"
from a severe reaction to the
cocaine.
The official University
response to Conklin's arrest was a
letter of reprimand, the content of
which was not disclosed. In a July
25 statement, Robinson explained
that while Conklin's situation was
of particular concern to the Uni
versity because of her position of
influence at Stanford, "her will
ingness to share the details [of the
circumstances surrounding her
experience] will dissuade others
from unlawful drug use."
Conklin, who was formerly
director of the Row and director of
residence deans, "has a great deal
of responsibility for student
life," wrote Robinson. Because of
this, some people were concerned
about whether the effectiveness of
her work will be impaired. Most
responses from her colleagues,
however, have been positive.

Woman raped in Foothills
On June 16, a woman was
raped at gunpoint while walking
in the Foothills — the first rape
reported to the Stanford Police
since 1983.
Over the summer, numerous
sightings were reported in Wilbur
Hall of suspicious individuals
resembling the rape suspect's
composite, creating fear among
the residents.
The search for the rapist
spurred a 200-hour police investi
gation which yielded over 100 sus
pects. However, the victim did not
positively identify any of them as
the rapist, and in early August the
police said they had exhausted all
leads and were no longer actively
pursuing the case.
On Aug. 3, Robert Michael
Christy, who had been questioned
in connection with a July, 1989
attempted rape in the Foothills,
was driving a Toyota truck in

Rocklin, Calif, when he rear
ended a car driven by 17-year-old
Stephanie LeDoux. After the two
stepped out their cars, Christy
fired six rounds from a semi-auto
matic pistol at LeDoux and killed
her. The cause of the shooting is
unknown.
Responding to the shots, police
pursued Christy and found him
dead from a self-inflicted gunshot
wound.
Police detectives were able to
link Christy to a Nov. 27, 1989
attempted rape in the Foothills
from his eyeglasses and folding
knife that were found near the
location of the assault.
Further investigation revealed
that Christy used false identifica
tion to purchase a semi-automatic
pistol in May. Christy used this
pistol to kiil LeDoux, and its
description matches the one given
by the woman raped on June 16.
The method of attack — using
a bar or neck hold to gain control

over the woman — led police to
suspect Christy's involvement in
the June 16 rape and one other
attempted rape at Stanford in the
past year.
Budget cuts cause layoffs
As part of the University's
effort to trim $22 million from its
operating budget, 112 layoffs of
professional and support staff
members were approved this sum
mer by the Office of Employee
Relations.
Of the laid-off workers, 16
belonged to the United Stanford
Workers, including the crew of
eight custodians who worked at
Tresidder Union. The other lay
offs occurred throughout the Uni
versity.
Tresidder management, which
faced a 21 percent budget cut, said
laying off the workers and con
tracting out the work to an out
side company — American Build
ing Maintenance — would help

save money.
The layoffs provoked an angry
USW protest Aug. 30, in which
five people were arrested. The
demonstrators barricaded them
selves in the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Room at Hoover Tower,
a place that Political Science Prof.
John Manley said symbolizes
"Reaganomics" and its effect on
workers in the 1980s. Manley was
among the five who were arrested.
Laid-off Tresidder workers Ray
Henson and Linda Crouse were
also arrested, as well as USW field
representative Reuben Serna and
USW secretary Sammy Brooks.
Earlier in the summer, the Uni
versity contracted Wright Associ
ates, a career counseling and
placement firm, to help workers
cope with the layoffs. A placement
service program was also made
available by Stanford to all laid-off
employees to assist them in
searching for new positions with
Stanford or other employers.
For those workers who were
able to keep their jobs, their great
est task this summer was to
adjust to new responsibilities that
result from office reorganizations.
Chemical wrangle continues
Eight years ago, toxic chemi
cals were found to have contami
nated groundwater and soil on
University property in Barron
Park, presumably from chemical
storage tanks belonging to compa
nies that lease the land.
Now someone has to pay to the
price.
Although Stanford agreed to
join 13 other companies in a pre
liminary investigation of the site
to determine the extent of the
damage and the responsible party,
as ordered by the California
Department of Health Services,
the University has made no defi
nite commitment to help with the
cleanup.
The role Stanford will play in
the cleanup has been the center of
ongoing controversy. According to
John Joynt, president of the Bar
ron Park Neighborhood Associa
tion, Stanford's position "signals
to the community that Stanford
really doesn't care to be the good
corporate citizen that the

[Hewlett-Packards] of the world
are," referring to the active role
that company haa taken in envi
ronmental cleanup efforts.
But Andrew Doty, Stanford's
director of community relations,
said, "We haven't contaminated
the land; those responsible should
pay."
Drug-testing ruling appealed
Appealing to the California
Court of Appeals on Aug. 14, the
NCAA argued for the reversal of a
1988 California Superior Court
decision that exempted Stanford
athletes from the association's
mandatory drug-testing program.
In August 1988, the court ruled
that mandatory ding testing was
an invasion of privacy under the
California constitution, thus
exempting all Californians from
the program, which required ath
letes to undress and urinate
before an NCAA monitor.
The ruling was in response to a
lawsuit initiated by former Stan
ford diver Simone LeVant. Stan
ford joined the suit in July 1987.
In the current appeal, NCAA
attorney Douglas Floyd argued
that drug testing will maintain
fair standards of competition and
deter drug use. He also asked the
court to reconsider the program
as it now stands, since it has
changed since the original law
suit.
Betas lose national charter
The Beta Theta Pi fraternity's
chapter at Stanford lost its
national charter, after delegates at
the fraternity's general conven
tion voted to sever its ties with the
Stanford chapter in early August.
The chapter's declaration of
autonomy from the national fra
ternity in a spring Rushbook and
its use of ritual and initiation pro
cedures differing from the
national guidelines are among
several factors leading to the con
vention's resolution.
Beta president Josh Sanborn
said the separation should have a
positive effect on the fraternity's
spring Rush. "Not having
national constraints can help us
build autonomy and .. . the kind
of community we want," he said.

Appealing to the California

NCAA argued for the reversal of a

In August 1988, the court ruled
that mandatory ding testing was
an invasion of privacy under the

exempting all Californians from

Betas lose national charter
The Beta Theta Pi fraternity's
chapter at Stanford lost its
national charter, after delegates at
the fraternity's general conven
tion voted to sever its ties with the
Stanford chapter in early August.
The chapter's declaration of
autonomy from the national fra
ternity in a spring Rushbook and
its use of ritual and initiation pro
cedures differing from the
national guidelines are among
several factors leading to the con

Beta president Josh Sanborn
said the separation should have a
positive effect on the fraternity's
spring Rush. "Not having

build autonomy and .. . the kind
of community we want," he said.

Acting Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin received a letter of reprimand from the University In
response to her arrest in June for being under the influence of cocaine.

Conklin arrested for drug use
Diana Conklin, acting associate
dean of student affairs, was cited
and arrested by Palo Alto Police
June 24 for being under the influ
ence of cocaine in her residence.
The Santa Clara County
Municipal Court allowed her to
participate in a drug diversion
program, upon completion of
which the misdemeanor charge
against her will be dropped.
The University's initial
response to the incident was a
statement from Norm Robinson,
acting dean of student affairs,
which stressed the importance of
"not making judgments without
knowing the facts and considering
all pertinent factors."
Conklin explained her action in
a July 25 public statement, stat
ing she impulsively used cocaine
from an old vial that her husband
found while moving out of the
house due to their divorce. She
said the incident was the first
time in nine years that she had
taken the drug.
Conklin said she called the
police herself because she thought
she was "poisoned and dying"
from a severe reaction to the
cocaine.
The official University
response to Conklin's arrest was a
letter of reprimand, the content of
which was not disclosed. In a July
25 statement, Robinson explained
that while Conklin's situation was
of particular concern to the Uni
versity because of her position of
influence at Stanford, "her will
ingness to share the details [of the
circumstances surrounding her
experience] will dissuade others
from unlawful drug use."
Conklin, who was formerly
director of the Row and director of
residence deans, "has a great deal
of responsibility for student
life," wrote Robinson. Because of
this, some people were concerned
about whether the effectiveness of
her work will be impaired. Most
responses from her colleagues,
however, have been positive.

Woman raped in Foothills
On June 16, a woman was
raped at gunpoint while walking
in the Foothills — the first rape
reported to the Stanford Police
since 1983.
Over the summer, numerous
sightings were reported in Wilbur
Hall of suspicious individuals
resembling the rape suspect's
composite, creating fear among
the residents.
The search for the rapist
spurred a 200-hour police investi
gation which yielded over 100 sus
pects. However, the victim did not
positively identify any of them as
the rapist, and in early August the
police said they had exhausted all
leads and were no longer actively
pursuing the case.
On Aug. 3, Robert Michael
Christy, who had been questioned
in connection with a July, 1989
attempted rape in the Foothills,
was driving a Toyota truck in

Rocklin, Calif, when he rear
ended a car driven by 17-year-old
Stephanie LeDoux. After the two
stepped out their cars, Christy
fired six rounds from a semi-auto
matic pistol at LeDoux and killed
her. The cause of the shooting is
unknown.
Responding to the shots, police
pursued Christy and found him
dead from a self-inflicted gunshot
wound.
Police detectives were able to
link Christy to a Nov. 27, 1989
attempted rape in the Foothills
from his eyeglasses and folding
knife that were found near the
location of the assault.
Further investigation revealed
that Christy used false identifica
tion to purchase a semi-automatic
pistol in May. Christy used this
pistol to kiil LeDoux, and its
description matches the one given
by the woman raped on June 16.
The method of attack — using
a bar or neck hold to gain control

over the woman — led police to
suspect Christy's involvement in
the June 16 rape and one other
attempted rape at Stanford in the
past year.
Budget cuts cause layoffs
As part of the University's
effort to trim $22 million from its
operating budget, 112 layoffs of
professional and support staff
members were approved this sum
mer by the Office of Employee
Relations.
Of the laid-off workers, 16
belonged to the United Stanford
Workers, including the crew of
eight custodians who worked at
Tresidder Union. The other lay
offs occurred throughout the Uni
versity.
Tresidder management, which
faced a 21 percent budget cut, said
laying off the workers and con
tracting out the work to an out
side company — American Build
ing Maintenance — would help

save money.
The layoffs provoked an angry
USW protest Aug. 30, in which
five people were arrested. The
demonstrators barricaded them
selves in the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Room at Hoover Tower,
a place that Political Science Prof.
John Manley said symbolizes
"Reaganomics" and its effect on
workers in the 1980s. Manley was
among the five who were arrested.
Laid-off Tresidder workers Ray
Henson and Linda Crouse were
also arrested, as well as USW field
representative Reuben Serna and
USW secretary Sammy Brooks.
Earlier in the summer, the Uni
versity contracted Wright Associ
ates, a career counseling and
placement firm, to help workers
cope with the layoffs. A placement
service program was also made
available by Stanford to all laid-off
employees to assist them in
searching for new positions with
Stanford or other employers.
For those workers who were
able to keep their jobs, their great
est task this summer was to
adjust to new responsibilities that
result from office reorganizations.
Chemical wrangle continues
Eight years ago, toxic chemi
cals were found to have contami
nated groundwater and soil on
University property in Barron
Park, presumably from chemical
storage tanks belonging to compa
nies that lease the land.
Now someone has to pay to the
price.
Although Stanford agreed to
join 13 other companies in a pre
liminary investigation of the site
to determine the extent of the
damage and the responsible party,
as ordered by the California
Department of Health Services,
the University has made no defi
nite commitment to help with the
cleanup.
The role Stanford will play in
the cleanup has been the center of
ongoing controversy. According to
John Joynt, president of the Bar
ron Park Neighborhood Associa
tion, Stanford's position "signals
to the community that Stanford
really doesn't care to be the good
corporate citizen that the

[Hewlett-Packards] of the world
are," referring to the active role
that company haa taken in envi
ronmental cleanup efforts.
But Andrew Doty, Stanford's
director of community relations,
said, "We haven't contaminated
the land; those responsible should
pay."
