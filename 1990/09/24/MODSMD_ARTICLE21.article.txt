Diana Conklin, acting associate

Stanford's 'central purpose'
Developing the best possible
undergraduate program will facil
itate the University's "central
purpose," which is "the prepara
tion of new leadership in this soci
ety," University President Donald
Kennedy wrote in a June 13 essay.
Kennedy's essay was an elabo
ration on his call to improve
undergraduate education while
maintaining Stanford's commit
ment to research, a plan he out
lined to the Academic Council last
spring.
In his essay, Kennedy envi
sioned education as an "active
kind of learning, one through
which students wrestle not only
with texts but with real problems.
Ethnic studies classes added
The advisory committee for the
Irvine Multicultural Curriculum
Development Grant decided to
implement three new courses and
to modify six others with the first
of six installments of a $1 million
dollar grant from the Irvine Foun
dation.
The grant will enable Stanford
to expand its existing curriculum
with ethnic studies — "a neces
sary component for the transition
from numerical diversity to an
interactive community," said Tom
Wasow, committee chair and dean
of undergraduate studies.
The three new courses are
"Film Images of African-Ameri
can Culture," "Law School Cur
riculum Project" and"The Impact
of Immigration Law and Policy on
Asian-American and Mexican-
American Communities."
Campus crimes increase
A summer crime wave hit cam
pus and Stanford Police were
bombarded with reports of home
burglaries and computer thefts.
From early May to mid-July,
four burglaries in the Stanford
residential area known as the
"faculty ghetto" led Stanford
Police to warn residents to secure
their homes at night.
In each case, the suspect or
suspects entered the house in the
early morning through an open

window or door, stealing petty
cash and car keys.
Police also reported an increase
in vandalism since early May, as
well as computer or computer
related thefts that totaled more
than $144,000.
On Aug. 6, Stanford Police
arrested James Pease, son of Elec
trical Engineering Prof. R. Fabian
Pease, on charges of burglary.
James Pease is a suspect in a
string of up to 40 burglaries and
Eroperty crimes dating back to
lay, according to Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
In addition, Stanford senior
Mark Anderegg was arrested Aug.
10 for breaking into a room in
Wilbur Hall and stealing money.
While in police custody, Anderegg
admitted to three more thefts,
Niemeyer said

Salaries released
University President Donald

James Rosse, the University's

Football coach Denny Green
approached his second year at
Stanford by telling eight players

football little time to decide if they

unprecedented in college football,
according to several team mem

Hoover to make cuts
Faced with a $1 million budget
deficit, the Hoover Institution is
also embarking on a repositioning
effort that is in line with that
throughout Stanford.
Hoover Director John Raisian
will oversee the cutting of funds
and the grouping of fellows into
"research clusters." He also will
name a steering committee of
scholars to help him formulate a
five-year plan for the institution
by the end of the year.

Ethnic studies classes added
The advisory committee for the
Irvine Multicultural Curriculum
Development Grant decided to
implement three new courses and
to modify six others with the first
of six installments of a $1 million
dollar grant from the Irvine Foun
dation.
The grant will enable Stanford
to expand its existing curriculum
with ethnic studies — "a neces
sary component for the transition
from numerical diversity to an
interactive community," said Tom
Wasow, committee chair and dean
of undergraduate studies.
The three new courses are
"Film Images of African-Ameri
can Culture," "Law School Cur
riculum Project" and"The Impact
of Immigration Law and Policy on
Asian-American and Mexican-
American Communities."
Campus crimes increase
A summer crime wave hit cam
pus and Stanford Police were
bombarded with reports of home
burglaries and computer thefts.
From early May to mid-July,
four burglaries in the Stanford
residential area known as the
"faculty ghetto" led Stanford
Police to warn residents to secure
their homes at night.
In each case, the suspect or
suspects entered the house in the
early morning through an open

window or door, stealing petty
cash and car keys.
Police also reported an increase
in vandalism since early May, as
well as computer or computer
related thefts that totaled more
than $144,000.
On Aug. 6, Stanford Police
arrested James Pease, son of Elec
trical Engineering Prof. R. Fabian
Pease, on charges of burglary.
James Pease is a suspect in a
string of up to 40 burglaries and
Eroperty crimes dating back to
lay, according to Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
In addition, Stanford senior
Mark Anderegg was arrested Aug.
10 for breaking into a room in
Wilbur Hall and stealing money.
While in police custody, Anderegg
admitted to three more thefts,
Niemeyer said
Infirmary closes
Cowell Student Health Center
closed its overnight infirmary as
part of the University's effort to
trim its operating budget.
Cowell will continue to provide
urgent care and bed rest for stu

p.m. students with serious condi
tions will be referred to Stanford
Hospital.
"I think this was a reasonable
area to take a look at [for budget

Salaries released
University President Donald
Kennedy was the sixth highest
paid employee at Stanford last

year, earning an income of
$194,375, according to statistics
released this summer. During this
time of budget repositioning, most
top administrators are still enjoy
ing higher-than-average pay
raises this year.
However, those spearheading
the cuts are putting their money
where their mouth is. Provost
James Rosse, the University's
number-two administrator, took a
0.7 percent pay cut last year.
Eight men out
Football coach Denny Green
approached his second year at
Stanford by telling eight players
to stay home until Sept. 25 —
more than five weeks after prac
tices began and after the comple
tion of three season games.
His late August notification
gave players who want to play
football little time to decide if they
want to transfer or not. This invi
tation-only system is also
unprecedented in college football,
according to several team mem
bers and an NCAA official.
Hoover to make cuts
Faced with a $1 million budget
deficit, the Hoover Institution is
also embarking on a repositioning
effort that is in line with that
throughout Stanford.
Hoover Director John Raisian
will oversee the cutting of funds
and the grouping of fellows into
"research clusters." He also will
name a steering committee of
scholars to help him formulate a
five-year plan for the institution
by the end of the year.

Car Project's "SUnSUrfer" fin

General Motors Sunrayce USA,

Stanford's solar car had an

1,625-mile course. After a rocky
start, Stanford moved up to the
15th position on the second day
from 31st on the first day.

Appointments made
Two prestigious doctors joined
the Stanford Medical School this
summer as the chairs of the

Shanghai, China. Dzau received
his medical doctorate at McGill
University in Canada, and has
served on the faculty of Harvard
Medical School since 1984. He was
also named the William G. Irwin

endowed professorship.
David Botstein has headed the
Department of Genetics since
Aug. 1. A native of Switzerland,
Botstein received his Ph.D. in
1967 from the University of
Michigan. He was a professor of
genetics for ten years at MlT's
biology department.
Condoleeza Rice, associate pro

National Science
Board.

W. Glenn Campbell, counselor
and former director of the Hoover
Institution, was nominated by
President Bush to the National
Science Board, the governing body

Diana Conklin, acting associate
dean of Student Affairs, said the
break will have no effect on the
fraternity's standing at Stanford.
Stanford's 'central purpose'
Developing the best possible
undergraduate program will facil
itate the University's "central
purpose," which is "the prepara
tion of new leadership in this soci
ety," University President Donald
Kennedy wrote in a June 13 essay.
Kennedy's essay was an elabo
ration on his call to improve
undergraduate education while
maintaining Stanford's commit
ment to research, a plan he out
lined to the Academic Council last
spring.
In his essay, Kennedy envi
sioned education as an "active
kind of learning, one through
which students wrestle not only
