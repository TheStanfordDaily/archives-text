## Stanford finds redemption in 37-3 victory Card hammers hapless OSU 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Saturday at 3:15 p.m. the Stan
ford football team heaved a collec
tive sigh of relief.
For first time in three games,
there was no fourth quarter come
back. There was no disappoint
ment. This time, the Cardinal
came away with a victory for its
efforts.
While young, injury-ridden
Oregon State is no Colorado or
UCLA, Stanford's complete game
effort and its apparent ease at
moving the ball at Stanford Sta
dium gave the Cardinal the confi
dence it had been searching for
and the momentum it so
despretely desired. Not to men
tion its first victory of the season.
After two last-second defeats,
Stanford needed more than just a
victory to prove to both itself and
its critics that it can use its talent
not only to play a good game, but
also to emerge victorious. The
team was looking for a convincing
win, a slaughter.
The Beavers proved to be help
less victims.
"Very realistically we should
have beaten UCLA last week so
we desperately needed to play well
against a team we were supposed
to beat and do it convincingly,"
offensive guard Chuck Gillingham
said.
"I think it's a relief because you
know everybody feels pressure to
win," cornerback Kevin Scott
said. "Another close game
wouldn't have been good for us so
we defintiley needed a big win."
They definitely got it. As the
lopsided 37-3 score showed, Stan
ford controlled every aspect of the
game. There was nothing it
couldn't do. It made big plays and
converted third downs. The Cardi
nal ran the ball. It passed. It held
the Beavers. It forced four
turnovers. There wasn't a ques
tion as to who was going to
emerge victorious this time.
The win in front of 45,000
moved Stanford to 1-2 for the sea
son, 1-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
"The whole team has a positive
feeling," offensive lineman Bob

Whitfield said. "We got ahead of
them and didn't relinquish the
lead. We played hard the whole
game. This was a real big
turnaround from two losses that
were close. We feel we can now get
out and do the job and finish a
team off."
Oregon State was simply over
matched in every position. Offen
sively, it couldn't get a drive going.
Defensively, it was held and over
whelmed. Even the return of pre
season All-America nose guard
Esera Tuaolo from a knee injury
couldn't vitalize the inexperienced
and overwhelmed Beavers, who
dropped their fourth consecutive
decision to go to 0-4 for the year,
0-1 in Pac-10 play.
Stanford's young but talented
defense set the tone for the con
test. On only the fifth play of the
game, cornerback Ron Redell
came down with Beavers quarter
back Matt Booher's toss, and a
23-yard scamper down the left

sideline gave the Cardinal possss
sion on the Oregon 35.
Six plays later, it was Jason
Palumbis to Glyn Milburn in the
end zone. Stanford never looked
back.
"I'm sure it [the interception!
did set the tempo. We were looking
for something, we had talked
about making something happen,
a fumble or an interception to get
them out of sync, and then we'd
play our game," defensive coordi
nator Willie Shaw said.
The defense continued to get in
the Beavers' way all day, coming
down with three more intercep
tions — two by sophomore Jimmy
Klein, and one by Scott — sacking
the trio of quarterbacks a total of
six times, and recording nine tack
les for losses.
"We did the things we wanted
to do. The whole defense played
motivated, concentrated football,"
Shaw said. "We rushed the passer
very well at times. I think we

played real focused defense
today."
Oregon State was completely
unable to execute a play from the
line of scrimmage. Passes were
thrown out of bounds. Accurate
passes were broken up, or just
plain dropped. Except for James
Jones, who rushed for a total of 29
yards on nine carries, Beaver
backs were simply unable to move
forward.
The Beaver's three quarter
backs — Booher, Fred Schweer
and Ed Browning — were collec
tively 13-for-30. On the one long
yardage rushing play of the game,
Jones, who eventually gained 17
yards on the play, slowed down
after breaking three tackles and
hitting open field. On its one scor
ing drive, the Beavers had third
and-goal on the 9-yard line but
were assessed three consecutive
penalties to knock them back to
