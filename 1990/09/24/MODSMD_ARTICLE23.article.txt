## Stanford finds redemption in 37-3 victory Card hammers hapless OSU 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Saturday at 3:15 p.m. the Stan
ford football team heaved a collec
tive sigh of relief.
For first time in three games,
there was no fourth quarter come
back. There was no disappoint
ment. This time, the Cardinal
came away with a victory for its
efforts.
While young, injury-ridden
Oregon State is no Colorado or
UCLA, Stanford's complete game
effort and its apparent ease at
moving the ball at Stanford Sta
dium gave the Cardinal the confi
dence it had been searching for
and the momentum it so
despretely desired. Not to men
tion its first victory of the season.
After two last-second defeats,
Stanford needed more than just a
victory to prove to both itself and
its critics that it can use its talent
not only to play a good game, but
also to emerge victorious. The
team was looking for a convincing
win, a slaughter.
The Beavers proved to be help
less victims.
"Very realistically we should
have beaten UCLA last week so
we desperately needed to play well
against a team we were supposed
to beat and do it convincingly,"
offensive guard Chuck Gillingham
said.
"I think it's a relief because you
know everybody feels pressure to
win," cornerback Kevin Scott
said. "Another close game
wouldn't have been good for us so
we defintiley needed a big win."
They definitely got it. As the
lopsided 37-3 score showed, Stan
ford controlled every aspect of the
game. There was nothing it
couldn't do. It made big plays and
converted third downs. The Cardi
nal ran the ball. It passed. It held
the Beavers. It forced four
turnovers. There wasn't a ques
tion as to who was going to
emerge victorious this time.
The win in front of 45,000
moved Stanford to 1-2 for the sea
son, 1-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
"The whole team has a positive
feeling," offensive lineman Bob

Whitfield said. "We got ahead of
them and didn't relinquish the
lead. We played hard the whole
game. This was a real big
turnaround from two losses that
were close. We feel we can now get
out and do the job and finish a
team off."
Oregon State was simply over
matched in every position. Offen
sively, it couldn't get a drive going.
Defensively, it was held and over
whelmed. Even the return of pre
season All-America nose guard
Esera Tuaolo from a knee injury
couldn't vitalize the inexperienced
and overwhelmed Beavers, who
dropped their fourth consecutive
decision to go to 0-4 for the year,
0-1 in Pac-10 play.
Stanford's young but talented
defense set the tone for the con
test. On only the fifth play of the
game, cornerback Ron Redell
came down with Beavers quarter
back Matt Booher's toss, and a
23-yard scamper down the left

sideline gave the Cardinal possss
sion on the Oregon 35.
Six plays later, it was Jason
Palumbis to Glyn Milburn in the
end zone. Stanford never looked
back.
"I'm sure it [the interception!
did set the tempo. We were looking
for something, we had talked
about making something happen,
a fumble or an interception to get
them out of sync, and then we'd
play our game," defensive coordi
nator Willie Shaw said.
The defense continued to get in
the Beavers' way all day, coming
down with three more intercep
tions — two by sophomore Jimmy
Klein, and one by Scott — sacking
the trio of quarterbacks a total of
six times, and recording nine tack
les for losses.
"We did the things we wanted
to do. The whole defense played
motivated, concentrated football,"
Shaw said. "We rushed the passer
very well at times. I think we

played real focused defense
today."
Oregon State was completely
unable to execute a play from the
line of scrimmage. Passes were
thrown out of bounds. Accurate
passes were broken up, or just
plain dropped. Except for James
Jones, who rushed for a total of 29
yards on nine carries, Beaver
backs were simply unable to move
forward.
The Beaver's three quarter
backs — Booher, Fred Schweer
and Ed Browning — were collec
tively 13-for-30. On the one long
yardage rushing play of the game,
Jones, who eventually gained 17
yards on the play, slowed down
after breaking three tackles and
hitting open field. On its one scor
ing drive, the Beavers had third
and-goal on the 9-yard line but
were assessed three consecutive
penalties to knock them back to

best game of the young season.
the 29. Oregon State escaped with
a field goal.
Stanford, however, appeared to
make its offensive series look easy.
Almost everything quarterback
Jason Palumbis lofted in the air
was brought down. By a Stanford
receiver. Palumbis was 15-of-18
for 122 yards before he was
relieved in the end of the third
quarter by sophomore John
Lynch. Ed McCaffrey, playing in
his second game after a back
injury, was more than ready for
action. He caught eight passes for
71 yards to lead the Cardinal
receiving corps.
But the real story was on the
ground. Stanford ran for 296

yards, its highest running total
since the 1984 Big Game. Tailback
Milburn lit up the Cardinal,
pulling his usual fakes and acro
batic moves for 113 yards on 20
carries before being rested for
backups Ellery Roberts and J.J.
Lasley in the second half.
Fullback Tommy Vardell was
also impressive. The junior, for
merly used in short yardage situa
tions, bullied for 65 yards on 13
carries, including a spectacular 14
yarder during which he broke four
tackles. He also rushed for two
touchdowns. Lasley chugged for
38 yards in a backup role. Former
1,000-yard gainer Jon Volpe,
while only gaining 29 yards,
pulled some key blocks for Mil
burn in the second quarter.
"We have backs, and we want
to have balance and be able to run
on first or second or third down.
We had a couple of runs on third

down, and that takes a lot of pres
sure off our pass protection,"
Green said.

'We did the things
we wanted to do.
The whole defense
played motivated,
concentrated foot
ball.'

Although Stanford racked up
37 points, its highest offensive
output since 1988, only six — on
two field goals — were scored in
the second half. The first series of
the third period resulted in a fum

ble, and Stanford had a total of
only two scoring drives after com
pleting five during the first 30
minutes.
The Cardinal, however, was not
worried about the "letdown," and,
in fact, viewed the third and espe
cially fourth periods as a chance to
prepare for the future.
"We had a little bit of a letdown
in the second half — especially the
turnover on the first play,"
Gillingham said. "But as the game
went on they [the coaches] wanted
to get some depth, and we started
getting some other people in
there, so it wasn't an overriding
concern."
Green especialy noted that the
squad's intensity, a factor that
may have been lacking in the two
losses, was there until the very
end. "Our intensity was still
there. We played a lot of players,
and the thing that we want to

make sure happen is that we give
a lot of players work."
Second, and even third-string
players were used in abundance
during the fourth quarter, and
Oregon State still failed to post a
second score.
The Cardinal won't be sneak
ing up on any opponents this year.
Card notes
A total of 65 players were used by
Green and staff in all, more than the
total of the entire Beaver traveling
squad.
Halfback Charlie Young made
his first appearance since having
reconstructive left knee surgery after
spring practice 1988. He gained 14
yards on three carries and was greeted
by a chorus of cheers when he ran the
ball for the first time.
Walk-on kicker Dave Durkin
made his first game-day appearance in
his three years on the the squad,

kicking off after the Stanford field
goal in the fourth quarter.
Four pee-wee football teams, com
plete with cheerleaders, took to the
field in two sepearte games during
halftime. They were given louder
applause, especially after two touch
down tosses, than the majority of the
Stanford-Oregon State plays.
The yell leaders made their home
debut. Although appreciated by the
freshman section, boos were heard
emanating from student sections dur
ing the third quarter. Good luck....
In addition to Lynch, quarterback
Steve Smith made his first appear
ance of the year. Last season's starting
signal caller has fallen to third on the
depth chart.
KZSU football gods Brian Web
ber and Mark McLaughlin have
moved up the ranks to the the envi
able position of Compadres Player of
the Day Selecion Committee. Their
first choice — Vardell.

couldn't vitalize the inexperienced
and overwhelmed Beavers, who
dropped their fourth consecutive
decision to go to 0-4 for the year,
0-1 in Pac-10 play.
Stanford's young but talented
defense set the tone for the con
test. On only the fifth play of the
game, cornerback Ron Redell
came down with Beavers quarter
back Matt Booher's toss, and a
23-yard scamper down the left

sideline gave the Cardinal possss
sion on the Oregon 35.
Six plays later, it was Jason
Palumbis to Glyn Milburn in the
end zone. Stanford never looked
back.
"I'm sure it [the interception!
did set the tempo. We were looking
for something, we had talked
about making something happen,
a fumble or an interception to get
them out of sync, and then we'd
play our game," defensive coordi
nator Willie Shaw said.
The defense continued to get in
the Beavers' way all day, coming
down with three more intercep
tions — two by sophomore Jimmy
Klein, and one by Scott — sacking
the trio of quarterbacks a total of
six times, and recording nine tack
les for losses.
"We did the things we wanted
to do. The whole defense played
motivated, concentrated football,"
Shaw said. "We rushed the passer
very well at times. I think we

played real focused defense
today."
Oregon State was completely
unable to execute a play from the
line of scrimmage. Passes were
thrown out of bounds. Accurate
passes were broken up, or just
plain dropped. Except for James
Jones, who rushed for a total of 29
yards on nine carries, Beaver
backs were simply unable to move
forward.
The Beaver's three quarter
backs — Booher, Fred Schweer
and Ed Browning — were collec
tively 13-for-30. On the one long
yardage rushing play of the game,
Jones, who eventually gained 17
yards on the play, slowed down
after breaking three tackles and
hitting open field. On its one scor
ing drive, the Beavers had third
and-goal on the 9-yard line but
were assessed three consecutive
penalties to knock them back to

the 29. Oregon State escaped with
a field goal.
Stanford, however, appeared to
make its offensive series look easy.
Almost everything quarterback
Jason Palumbis lofted in the air
was brought down. By a Stanford
receiver. Palumbis was 15-of-18
for 122 yards before he was
relieved in the end of the third
quarter by sophomore John
Lynch. Ed McCaffrey, playing in
his second game after a back
injury, was more than ready for
action. He caught eight passes for
71 yards to lead the Cardinal
receiving corps.
But the real story was on the
ground. Stanford ran for 296

yards, its highest running total
since the 1984 Big Game. Tailback
Milburn lit up the Cardinal,
pulling his usual fakes and acro
batic moves for 113 yards on 20
carries before being rested for
backups Ellery Roberts and J.J.
Lasley in the second half.
Fullback Tommy Vardell was
also impressive. The junior, for
merly used in short yardage situa
tions, bullied for 65 yards on 13
carries, including a spectacular 14
yarder during which he broke four
tackles. He also rushed for two
touchdowns. Lasley chugged for
38 yards in a backup role. Former
1,000-yard gainer Jon Volpe,
while only gaining 29 yards,
pulled some key blocks for Mil
burn in the second quarter.
"We have backs, and we want
to have balance and be able to run
on first or second or third down.
We had a couple of runs on third

down, and that takes a lot of pres
sure off our pass protection,"
Green said.

'We did the things
we wanted to do.
The whole defense
played motivated,
concentrated foot
ball.'

Although Stanford racked up
37 points, its highest offensive
output since 1988, only six — on
two field goals — were scored in
the second half. The first series of
the third period resulted in a fum

ble, and Stanford had a total of
only two scoring drives after com
pleting five during the first 30
minutes.
The Cardinal, however, was not
worried about the "letdown," and,
in fact, viewed the third and espe
cially fourth periods as a chance to
prepare for the future.
"We had a little bit of a letdown
in the second half — especially the
turnover on the first play,"
Gillingham said. "But as the game
went on they [the coaches] wanted
to get some depth, and we started
getting some other people in
there, so it wasn't an overriding
concern."
Green especialy noted that the
squad's intensity, a factor that
may have been lacking in the two
losses, was there until the very
end. "Our intensity was still
there. We played a lot of players,
and the thing that we want to

make sure happen is that we give
a lot of players work."
Second, and even third-string
players were used in abundance
during the fourth quarter, and
Oregon State still failed to post a
second score.
The Cardinal won't be sneak
ing up on any opponents this year.
Card notes
A total of 65 players were used by
Green and staff in all, more than the
total of the entire Beaver traveling
squad.
Halfback Charlie Young made
his first appearance since having
reconstructive left knee surgery after
spring practice 1988. He gained 14
yards on three carries and was greeted
by a chorus of cheers when he ran the
ball for the first time.
Walk-on kicker Dave Durkin
made his first game-day appearance in
his three years on the the squad,

kicking off after the Stanford field
goal in the fourth quarter.
Four pee-wee football teams, com
plete with cheerleaders, took to the
field in two sepearte games during
halftime. They were given louder
applause, especially after two touch
down tosses, than the majority of the
Stanford-Oregon State plays.
The yell leaders made their home
debut. Although appreciated by the
freshman section, boos were heard
emanating from student sections dur
ing the third quarter. Good luck....
In addition to Lynch, quarterback
Steve Smith made his first appear
ance of the year. Last season's starting
signal caller has fallen to third on the
depth chart.

Saturday at 3:15 p.m. the Stan
ford football team heaved a collec
tive sigh of relief.
For first time in three games,
there was no fourth quarter come
back. There was no disappoint
ment. This time, the Cardinal
came away with a victory for its
efforts.
While young, injury-ridden
Oregon State is no Colorado or
UCLA, Stanford's complete game
effort and its apparent ease at
moving the ball at Stanford Sta
dium gave the Cardinal the confi
dence it had been searching for
and the momentum it so
despretely desired. Not to men
tion its first victory of the season.
After two last-second defeats,
Stanford needed more than just a
victory to prove to both itself and
its critics that it can use its talent
not only to play a good game, but
also to emerge victorious. The
team was looking for a convincing
win, a slaughter.
The Beavers proved to be help
less victims.
"Very realistically we should
have beaten UCLA last week so
we desperately needed to play well
against a team we were supposed
to beat and do it convincingly,"
offensive guard Chuck Gillingham
said.
"I think it's a relief because you
know everybody feels pressure to
win," cornerback Kevin Scott
said. "Another close game
wouldn't have been good for us so
we defintiley needed a big win."
They definitely got it. As the
lopsided 37-3 score showed, Stan
ford controlled every aspect of the
game. There was nothing it
couldn't do. It made big plays and
converted third downs. The Cardi
nal ran the ball. It passed. It held
the Beavers. It forced four
turnovers. There wasn't a ques
tion as to who was going to
emerge victorious this time.
The win in front of 45,000
moved Stanford to 1-2 for the sea
son, 1-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
"The whole team has a positive
feeling," offensive lineman Bob

Whitfield said. "We got ahead of
them and didn't relinquish the
lead. We played hard the whole
game. This was a real big
turnaround from two losses that
were close. We feel we can now get
out and do the job and finish a
team off."
Oregon State was simply over
matched in every position. Offen
sively, it couldn't get a drive going.
Defensively, it was held and over
whelmed. Even the return of pre
season All-America nose guard
Esera Tuaolo from a knee injury
couldn't vitalize the inexperienced
and overwhelmed Beavers, who
dropped their fourth consecutive
decision to go to 0-4 for the year,
0-1 in Pac-10 play.

defense set the tone for the con
test. On only the fifth play of the
