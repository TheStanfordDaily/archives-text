# Klein grabs two interceptions to lead defensive resurgence
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
There aren't a lot of precise
ways to measure the performance
of a safety, but there are some
pretty fair indicators.
For example, if a safety (A)
triples his career interception
total in the space of two minutes;
(B) finishes the game as the other
team's third-leading receiver; (C)
sets up two scores with his inter
ceptions and (D) ends up with the
game's longest reception — for
either team — it's a good bet he's
had a decent day.
Just ask Stanford's Jimmy
Klein, whose two pickoffs in the
second quarter Saturday led to 10
Cardinal points. Klein ran his first
catch back 24 yards to the Oregon
State 42 to set up Stanford's
fourth touchdown, while his spec
tacular one-handed steal on the
Beavers' next drive led to a John
Hopkins field goal that made the
score 31-zip at the half.
"Jimmy's been coming along
real well," Stanford defensive
coordinator Willie Shaw said. "He
was a little slow getting his foot
ball legs back because he missed
spring practice, but he's kept
working and working."
Klein missed spring ball
because of an Honor Code viola
tion that earned him a one-quar
ter suspension from the Univer
sity, and the lack of practice time
didn't help him when he showed
up for camp in the fall.
"I came in expecting to have a
shot at starting," Klein said, "but
I had a rough first couple of
weeks. I was third string at one
point, but then the week before
Colorado things got better. Then
Tuan got hurt."
Klein was referring to pro
jected starter Tuan Van Le, and
when he went down Klein stepped
into the starting role. "The last
couple of weeks Jimmy's really
come on," Shaw said. "He's smart
and tough — he's going to be a
good football player."
Of course, Klein had a little
help with both of his interceptions
Saturday. "Both of them came on
blitzes," Klein said. "We were able
to get a lot of pressure on their

quarterback throughout the
game, and you've got to give the
credit to our line for that."
You also have to give some of
the credit to Shaw, who had
linebackers Jono Tunney and Ron
George playing hell with the
Beaver quarterbacks throughout
the game. The plan payed off with
six sacks and eight tackles for
losses, as the Beavers spent most
of the day moving backward. "We
played real focused defense
today," Shaw said. "We put those
two linebackers in instead of the
defensive ends in order to get a
bigger rush. We're a pressure
team, and we were looking for
something early: a fumble, inter
ception. .
The Cardinal got that early
interception when Ron Redell
picked off a Matt Booher pass and
returned it to the Beaver 35 to set
up Stanford's first TD. "I was at
free safety, just playing the ball,
and I read the quarterback's eyes
all the way," Redell said. "The
receiver fell or something, and I
just broke on the ball, and all of a
sudden my eyes got real big.
"I saw end zone the whole way,
but I got caught. I don't know if
that's my legs or what," Redell
laughed.
Redell's theft was the first of
four for the Stanford secondary
(Kevin Scott picked one off in the
third quarter looooong after the
game's outcome was over), which
isn't bad for a unit that was shred
ded for 244 second-half yards a
week ago at UCLA.
"Coach Shaw told us all week
'UCLA challenged the defensive
backs in the second half, and Ore
gon State's going to challenge us
starting with the first play,' "
Redell said. "We had to meet the
challenge."
That they did: Before OSU's
third-string QB entered the game
during garbage time and actually
started completing passes to
someone other than Cardinal
players, the Beavers had an entire
67 yards passing. Stanford's
defensive backs, meanwhile, had
racked up 66 yards of their own
returning interceptions.
In all, OSU's QBs were 13-of
-30 for 143 meaningless yards.
