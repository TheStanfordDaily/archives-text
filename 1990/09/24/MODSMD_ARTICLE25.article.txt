# Stanford falls to second in Pac-10 race
## UCLA drops spikers from undefeated ranks 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
The face of UCLA volleyball
coach Andy Banachowski must be
permanently etched in Stanford
coach Don Shaw's mind by now.
Two of the three times, Shaw's
squad lost in 1988, Andy was
there. Two of the times the Cardi
nal succumbed last season, Andy
was there. And when the fast

starting Cardinal took the floor
Saturday night at Maples Pavil
ion, Andy — of course — was
there.
Banachowski's Bruins again
squelched any Cardinal ambitions
that things would be different this
time around, defeating Stanford
15-11, 16-14, 11-15, 15-1.
Prior to the match, the sixth
ranked Cardinal gave every indi
cation that it would fare better

against mighty UCLA. Stanford
ran its early record to 6-0 before
the Saturday contest. After an
encouraging road trip to Illinois,
Stanford traipsed up to Oregon a
week ago to dismantle the Beavers
and Ducks on consecutive nights.
The Cardinal then continued to
streak, upending the languid USC
Trojans Friday night, 15-10, 15-7,
15-9.
Oregon provided a favorable

setting for Stanford's first confer
ence confrontation. While Oregon
State's Beavers have improved
dramatically in recent years, their
average 5-foot-8 starting lineup
did not promise to do much
against Stanford's 6-foot-and
over squad.
OSU nonetheless continued to
surprise, taking game two in a 15-
10, 9-15, 15-10, 15-8 loss to Stan
ford. Despite its diminutive

stature, Oregon State actually
recorded several blocks than the
Cardinal. Stellar hitting by
Stanford's bi 5 guns more than off
set this surprising trend. Outside
hitter Kristin Klein delivered a
match-high 23 kills for a .417 hit
ting percentage. Sophomore Bev
Oden added 20 kills and middle
blocker Amy Cooper contributed a
spectacular .565 hitting percent
age. Twenty digs by both Oden
and Klein helped Stanford cruise.
The Oregon Ducks managed
even less. After playing the Cardi
nal close in game one, Oregon self
destructed before an intimidating
Stanford block. Oregon's hitters
committed 31 total attack errors,
more than twice as many as the
Cardinal. Klein once again led the
way with .464 hit
ting percentage while Cooper
recorded 14 kills. Oden shined
defensively, digging 15 balls.
Stanford rode the momentum
and their unblemished record
back to the Farm to meet USC in
its first home match of the season.
While the Cardinal offense was
relatively sluggish, Klein shined
with a .355 hitting percentage.
USC could not capitalize on Stan
ford's uncharacteristic offensive
letdown, hitting only .075 them
selves on the night. The Cardinal
needed only an hour and a half to
dispatch the Trojans and keep
their record perfect.
Stanford had little time to
savor the win and the streak as
No. 2 UCLA rolled in the follow
ing night. As if performing to
some unwritten script, the Cardi
nal fell behind early and often to
its bitter foes by struggling in
every aspect of the game. Stanford
surrendered opening game runs of
4-0, 3-0, 7-0, and 13-0 to UCLA.
"We played tight and poorly,''
Shaw said. "We committed break
downs; we just didn't do the job
that we had to do. When you play
like that, you just can't expect to
win."
The Cardinal almost died try
ing, though. Depsite the intimi
dating deficits they suffered,
Stanford fought back stubbornly
in almost every game. Stanford

was down 12-2 in game one before
recording nine unanswered
points. The Cardinal actually held
game point at 14-9 after an
attacking error by UCLA's Jenny
Evans in gnme two. Down 7-0 in
the third, Stanford tallied seven
consecutive times to tie the score
and then prevail.
Oden contributed a career
night to spark each resurgence.
The celebrated middle blocker fin
ished with a career-highs of 29
kills and 22 digs while hitting .454
on a night that her teammates
managed only .082. Oden attacked
from all positions and directions
on the court, often hitting off-bal
ance to kill a crucial ball.
"I thought Bev was outstand
ing," Banachowski said of his
competition.
The match also marked an
important step for freshman set
ter Piper Hahn. Shaw inserted
last year's high school player of
the year to revive a sagging
offense in the first two games.
Hahn remained in the match after
making several superlative defen
sive saves and sparking several
Cardinal comebacks. The fresh
man recorded a career-high 42
assists against the Bruins.
The night, however, was not to
be. UCLA utilized an unforgiving
defense and solid hitting by Ail-
American Natalie Williams to
keep the Cardinal at bay. While
Stanford recorded more kills,
more digs, and a higher hitting
percentage than the Bruins, they
could muster only one game.
Defensive lapses and broken plays
that do not show in the statistics
seemed to plague the Cardinal.
"1 don't know how many times
we have beaten ourselves like we
have tonight," Shaw said.
While disappointed with his
squad's performance, both he and
Banachowski are confident that
both teams will play better in
future contfrontations. Shaw's
immediate focus is on No. 3 Uni
versity of the Pacific who will visit
tomorrow at Maples Pavilion. The
Tigers are coming off victories
over No. 1 Nebraska and No. 7
Illinois in Illinois.

10, 9-15, 15-10, 15-8 loss to Stan
ford. Despite its diminutive

stature, Oregon State actually
recorded several blocks than the
Cardinal. Stellar hitting by
Stanford's bi 5 guns more than off
set this surprising trend. Outside
hitter Kristin Klein delivered a
match-high 23 kills for a .417 hit
ting percentage. Sophomore Bev
Oden added 20 kills and middle
blocker Amy Cooper contributed a
spectacular .565 hitting percent
age. Twenty digs by both Oden
and Klein helped Stanford cruise.
The Oregon Ducks managed
even less. After playing the Cardi
nal close in game one, Oregon self
destructed before an intimidating
Stanford block. Oregon's hitters
committed 31 total attack errors,
more than twice as many as the
Cardinal. Klein once again led the
way with .464 hit
ting percentage while Cooper
recorded 14 kills. Oden shined
defensively, digging 15 balls.
Stanford rode the momentum
and their unblemished record
back to the Farm to meet USC in
its first home match of the season.
While the Cardinal offense was
relatively sluggish, Klein shined
with a .355 hitting percentage.
USC could not capitalize on Stan
ford's uncharacteristic offensive
letdown, hitting only .075 them
selves on the night. The Cardinal
needed only an hour and a half to
dispatch the Trojans and keep
their record perfect.
Stanford had little time to
savor the win and the streak as
No. 2 UCLA rolled in the follow
ing night. As if performing to
some unwritten script, the Cardi
nal fell behind early and often to
its bitter foes by struggling in
every aspect of the game. Stanford
surrendered opening game runs of
4-0, 3-0, 7-0, and 13-0 to UCLA.
"We played tight and poorly,''
Shaw said. "We committed break
downs; we just didn't do the job
that we had to do. When you play
like that, you just can't expect to
win."
The Cardinal almost died try
ing, though. Depsite the intimi
dating deficits they suffered,
Stanford fought back stubbornly
in almost every game. Stanford

was down 12-2 in game one before
recording nine unanswered
points. The Cardinal actually held
game point at 14-9 after an
attacking error by UCLA's Jenny
Evans in gnme two. Down 7-0 in
the third, Stanford tallied seven
consecutive times to tie the score
and then prevail.
Oden contributed a career
night to spark each resurgence.
The celebrated middle blocker fin
ished with a career-highs of 29
kills and 22 digs while hitting .454
on a night that her teammates
managed only .082. Oden attacked
from all positions and directions
on the court, often hitting off-bal
ance to kill a crucial ball.
"I thought Bev was outstand
ing," Banachowski said of his
competition.
The match also marked an
important step for freshman set
ter Piper Hahn. Shaw inserted
last year's high school player of
the year to revive a sagging
offense in the first two games.
Hahn remained in the match after
making several superlative defen
sive saves and sparking several
Cardinal comebacks. The fresh
man recorded a career-high 42
assists against the Bruins.
The night, however, was not to
be. UCLA utilized an unforgiving
defense and solid hitting by Ail-
American Natalie Williams to
keep the Cardinal at bay. While
Stanford recorded more kills,
more digs, and a higher hitting
percentage than the Bruins, they
could muster only one game.
Defensive lapses and broken plays
that do not show in the statistics
seemed to plague the Cardinal.
"1 don't know how many times
we have beaten ourselves like we
have tonight," Shaw said.
While disappointed with his
squad's performance, both he and
Banachowski are confident that
both teams will play better in
future contfrontations. Shaw's
immediate focus is on No. 3 Uni
versity of the Pacific who will visit
tomorrow at Maples Pavilion. The
Tigers are coming off victories
over No. 1 Nebraska and No. 7
Illinois in Illinois.
