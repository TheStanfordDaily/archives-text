"Often a young team finds ways to lose.
But today this team found a way to win."
Cardinal men's soccer coach Colin Lindores
spoke truth after his team came from
behind to upset the No. 13 UNLV Runnin'
Rebels 5-2 in overtime yesterday. Stan
ford's record is now at 3-2-4.
The first period gave absolutely no indi
cation of such a high-scoring game. Neither
team dominated that half, which saw each
team take turns on the offensive. But no
one could find the net, and the first 45 min
utes ended with a 0-0 score.
UNLV's Doug Borgel broke the fast of
scoring about four minutes into the second
period. Sixteen minutes later the Rebels
capitalized on a corner kick to put one just
past Cardinal goalkeeper Kyle Krpata and
extend their lead to 2-0.
Only 24 minutes remained in the game
at that point, and it appeared as though the
contest would fulfill the oddsmakers'
prophecies. But within the next six min
utes, Stanford had evened the score at 2-2.
The first Cardinal player to light up the
scoreboard was sophomore forward Jim
Talluto, who scored off an assist from
senior Tim Keyes. Soon after, junior mid
fielder Bill BoUengier, amidst a swarm of
players from both teams, directed a throw
in from fullback Brandon Farley off his
chest and into the net to tie.
"Getting down by two was tough," said
Talluto after the game. "We just kept com
posed and didn't slack up." He also credited
the home crowd with the extra emotional

boost to overcome the deficit.
Certainly, the Cardinal did not "slack
up." The team played more aggressively
than ever at the end of the second period
and kept the Rebels ofT balance. Stanford
missed a chance to end the game in regula
tion when senior forward Todd Caven hesi
tated a moment in front of the goal, giving
a Rebel defender just enough time to evacu
ate the ball.
But the Cardinal continued its fierce
play in overtime and went ahead almost
immediately. Sophomore Lance Killian
inbounded a ball near midfield, hurling it to
Caven, who was near the corner of the field
in UNLV territory. Caven headed the toss to
Talluto, who headed it into the goal. The
play took a couple of seconds, and the ball
didn't touch the ground until it was safely
inside the Rebel goal. Just like that, Stan
ford was in the lead.
Seven minutes later, Killian had a
chance to extend the Cardinal's lead when
he had a one-on-one showdown with Dan
Schell, UNLV's goalkeeper. But Schell cut
off his angle, and the kick was just wide.
However, Killian gained a rematch five
minutes into the second half of overtime.
This time he drew Schell about 40 feet out
of his box and booted the ball just past him
and into the goal. No other players on the
field were near the two.
"I tried to keep my composure mentally,"
said Killian of his second, successful joust
with Schell. "I could either bend it around
him or tip it over him. I bent it around him,
and it worked. I knew I had time. I knew I
