# Men's soccer stuns No. 13 UNLV 5-2 in overtime
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Editorial staff 
"Often a young team finds ways to lose.
But today this team found a way to win."
Cardinal men's soccer coach Colin Lindores
spoke truth after his team came from
behind to upset the No. 13 UNLV Runnin'
Rebels 5-2 in overtime yesterday. Stan
ford's record is now at 3-2-4.
The first period gave absolutely no indi
cation of such a high-scoring game. Neither
team dominated that half, which saw each
team take turns on the offensive. But no
one could find the net, and the first 45 min
utes ended with a 0-0 score.
UNLV's Doug Borgel broke the fast of
scoring about four minutes into the second
period. Sixteen minutes later the Rebels
capitalized on a corner kick to put one just
past Cardinal goalkeeper Kyle Krpata and
extend their lead to 2-0.
Only 24 minutes remained in the game
at that point, and it appeared as though the
contest would fulfill the oddsmakers'
prophecies. But within the next six min
utes, Stanford had evened the score at 2-2.
The first Cardinal player to light up the
scoreboard was sophomore forward Jim
Talluto, who scored off an assist from
senior Tim Keyes. Soon after, junior mid
fielder Bill BoUengier, amidst a swarm of
players from both teams, directed a throw
in from fullback Brandon Farley off his
chest and into the net to tie.
"Getting down by two was tough," said
Talluto after the game. "We just kept com
posed and didn't slack up." He also credited
the home crowd with the extra emotional

boost to overcome the deficit.
Certainly, the Cardinal did not "slack
up." The team played more aggressively
than ever at the end of the second period
and kept the Rebels ofT balance. Stanford
missed a chance to end the game in regula
tion when senior forward Todd Caven hesi
tated a moment in front of the goal, giving
a Rebel defender just enough time to evacu
ate the ball.
But the Cardinal continued its fierce
play in overtime and went ahead almost
immediately. Sophomore Lance Killian
inbounded a ball near midfield, hurling it to
Caven, who was near the corner of the field
in UNLV territory. Caven headed the toss to
Talluto, who headed it into the goal. The
play took a couple of seconds, and the ball
didn't touch the ground until it was safely
inside the Rebel goal. Just like that, Stan
ford was in the lead.
Seven minutes later, Killian had a
chance to extend the Cardinal's lead when
he had a one-on-one showdown with Dan
Schell, UNLV's goalkeeper. But Schell cut
off his angle, and the kick was just wide.
However, Killian gained a rematch five
minutes into the second half of overtime.
This time he drew Schell about 40 feet out
of his box and booted the ball just past him
and into the goal. No other players on the
field were near the two.
"I tried to keep my composure mentally,"
said Killian of his second, successful joust
with Schell. "I could either bend it around
him or tip it over him. I bent it around him,
and it worked. I knew I had time. I knew I

didn't have to rush it, I kept my
wits."
After Killian's goal the Rebels
still clung to the hope that they
could score at least two goals in
the last 10 minutes of the game.
But as their hope waned with less
than two minutes remaining,
Cardinal sophomore Niels Bruck

ner shot out the lights when he
chipped in another Farley throw
in off Schell's frustrated hands.
"We knew we had to win this
coming in if we were to have any
chance to make the playoffs," said
Talluto. "We had tied some other
teams in the western region, and
we knew we had to win this one."
But amid all the post-game cel
ebrations, Lindores maintained a
cool perspective, warning that
one win against a top-20 team
does not a top-20 team make.
"It's still a maturation pro

cess," he said. "This is a young
team. The sophomores are a good
group to build around. If we get
two or three good recruits, we'll
be a top-20 team. But there are no
magic wands, no secret ingredi
ents. Some things you just can't
speed up."
Lindores pointed out that
young teams typically have up
and-down seasons, and Stanford
has been no exception. Sept. 12,
the Cardinal lost an away game to
Fresno State, 2-0, the sole contest
in which they have been shut out.

Two days afterward, the Cardi
nal traveled to the Met Life Clas
sic at USF, where they tied
Evansville, the No. 4 team in the
nation, 1-1 in overtime. Then
they recorded a win, 2-1 against
Hartford, to tie Evansville — who
beat No. 6 USF — for the tourna
ment co-title.
Sept. 19, Stanford played a
tough game against St. Mary's at
Maloney Field for a 2-2 overtime
tie. At that point, the Cardinal
had not been able to come away
from an overtime game with a

"W."
Nevertheless, Lindores has
remained optimistic. When asked
if injuries were hitting key play
ers, he replied, "I thought they
were key players, but this game
two starters came out and others
filled in well for them. We can
plug people in and still play well."
True enough.

immediately. Sophomore Lance Killian
inbounded a ball near midfield, hurling it to
Caven, who was near the corner of the field
in UNLV territory. Caven headed the toss to
Talluto, who headed it into the goal. The
play took a couple of seconds, and the ball
didn't touch the ground until it was safely
inside the Rebel goal. Just like that, Stan
ford was in the lead.
Seven minutes later, Killian had a
chance to extend the Cardinal's lead when
he had a one-on-one showdown with Dan
Schell, UNLV's goalkeeper. But Schell cut
off his angle, and the kick was just wide.
However, Killian gained a rematch five
minutes into the second half of overtime.
This time he drew Schell about 40 feet out
of his box and booted the ball just past him
and into the goal. No other players on the
field were near the two.
"I tried to keep my composure mentally,"
said Killian of his second, successful joust
with Schell. "I could either bend it around
him or tip it over him. I bent it around him,
and it worked. I knew I had time. I knew I

didn't have to rush it, I kept my
wits."
After Killian's goal the Rebels
still clung to the hope that they
could score at least two goals in
the last 10 minutes of the game.
But as their hope waned with less
than two minutes remaining,
Cardinal sophomore Niels Bruck

ner shot out the lights when he
chipped in another Farley throw
in off Schell's frustrated hands.
"We knew we had to win this
coming in if we were to have any
chance to make the playoffs," said
Talluto. "We had tied some other
teams in the western region, and
we knew we had to win this one."
But amid all the post-game cel
ebrations, Lindores maintained a
cool perspective, warning that
one win against a top-20 team
does not a top-20 team make.
"It's still a maturation pro

cess," he said. "This is a young
team. The sophomores are a good
group to build around. If we get
two or three good recruits, we'll
be a top-20 team. But there are no
magic wands, no secret ingredi
ents. Some things you just can't
speed up."
Lindores pointed out that
young teams typically have up
and-down seasons, and Stanford
has been no exception. Sept. 12,
the Cardinal lost an away game to
Fresno State, 2-0, the sole contest
in which they have been shut out.

Two days afterward, the Cardi
nal traveled to the Met Life Clas
sic at USF, where they tied
Evansville, the No. 4 team in the
nation, 1-1 in overtime. Then
they recorded a win, 2-1 against
Hartford, to tie Evansville — who
beat No. 6 USF — for the tourna
ment co-title.
Sept. 19, Stanford played a
tough game against St. Mary's at
Maloney Field for a 2-2 overtime
tie. At that point, the Cardinal
had not been able to come away
from an overtime game with a

"W."
Nevertheless, Lindores has
remained optimistic. When asked
if injuries were hitting key play
ers, he replied, "I thought they
were key players, but this game
two starters came out and others
filled in well for them. We can
plug people in and still play well."
True enough.
