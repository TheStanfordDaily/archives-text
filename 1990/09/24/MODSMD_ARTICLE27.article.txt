# Card women improve to 7-1 by crushing Crimson
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Editorial staff 
And the answers are: 1) About
3,000 miles; 2) Several shades of
red; and 3) four goals.
BING! What are three differ
ences between the Stanford Cardi
nal and the Harvard Crimson?
Correct!
The No. 11 Cardinal women's
soccer team easily handled their
opponents from That Other
School Saturday at Maloney Field,
defeating them 4-0. Stanford's
record now stands at 7-1, four of

those wins have been shutouts,
and the Cardinal has outscored its
opponents 22-4.
The Cardinal bolstered that
record with a 5-0 win at U.S.
International Sept. 13 before los
ing their first game of the season
at UC-Santa Barbara 1-0 Sept. 16.
The Gauchos played in the NCAA
tournament last year, and they
are ranked in the top 20 this sea
son.
Stanford and UCSB played
fairly evenly, but the Cardinal was
not at its best, due in part to sev
eral injuries to key players.

Despite this, Stanford played the
Gauchos even for 85 minutes
before surrendering the game's
only goal with five minutes left to
play.
Before the game with Harvard,
Stanford also defeated St. Mary's
2-1 last Wednesday at Maloney.
The Cardinal lost to the Gaels 1-0
last year in Moraga, and that
defeat was a big blow to the team's
postseason aspirations. This
year's contest looked similar as
the Gaels scored the only goal in
the first half.
But after intermission the Car

dinal totally outplayed St. Mary's.
Finally, with 20 minutes left in
the game, sophomore midfielder
Carolyn Einstein was fouled out
side the penalty box on the right
side. Junior fullback Heather
Mclntyre hit a perfect cross on the
resultant free kick and sophomore
Julie Foudy outjumped the oppo
sition, headed the ball off the
inside of the right post and
watched it roll over the goal line.
Five minutes later junior for
ward Elizabeth Joneschild hit a
through pass to senior forward
Jen Rowland who had beaten the

defense. Rowland, displaying the
speed that has earned her the
nickname "Rocket" despite a large
knee brace, beat the goalie with a
shot to the far post to give Stan
ford the victory.
Against Harvard, Stanford
started a trend when the team
penetrated deep into Crimson ter
ritory immediately after the kick
off. Seven minutes later Einstein
tallied her first goal of the season.
She fired a shot that appeared to
go through the hands of Beth
Reilly, Harvard's goalkeeper. The
ball bounced off the right post and
spun in to give Einstein the unas
sisted goal.
The Crimson defense soon
found itself overworked, and 15
minutes into the game Einstein
popped her second goal of the sea
son off a pass by Joneschild.
That was rapidly followed by a
beautifully placed assist from
freshman Glynnis Roberts to
Foudy. Roberts booted a high, arc
ing pass from the outside to
Foudy, who headed it in among a
crowd of defenders.
Harvard, bolstered by a num
ber of fans, began to raise the level
of their game at that point and
missed a couple of opportunities
to cut Stanford's lead late in the
first half and early in the second.
Of course, that was partly due to
the exploits of Elise Edwards, one
of the nation's top goalkeepers.
But the Crimson could not do
more than occasionally match the
play of the home team. And
although neither team could score
in the middle of the game, there
were some spectacular plays. One
was a save by Edwards, who used
volleyball skills to deflect a Crim
son corner kick.
At another point, Mclntyre
provided some entertainment for
the home fans. Mclntyre took the
ball near midfleld and cut and
slashed all the way to the fringe of
Reilly's box. She passed the ball
up to sophomore midfielder Kirby
Seale, whose head shot was saved
by Reilly.
As the second period began, a
Stanford player encouraged her
teammates, shouting, "Let's win
this!" A Harvard player replied by
shouting to her comrades, "Get a
goal!" The two opposing players
unwittingly but tellingly revealed
what their respective teams

wanted to achieve in the game.
With just under six minutes
left in the game, Mclntyre
sparked another brilliant play
when she fired a pass with pin
point accuracy to Foudy, who
received the ball while sandwiched
between two defenders. Foudy
was the only Cardinal player in
Crimson territory at the time, and
she squeezed ahead of her press
ing opponents to put the ball in
the corner of the net.
Cardinal coach Berhane Ande
berhan was relieved that his ailing
team won the game with no
injuries or re-injuries. Andeber
han has not been able to play sev
eral of his top players at 100 per
cent. These include prolific scorer
Sarah Rafanelli, the Cardinal's
latest in a growing line of frosh
phenoms, senior Denise Denney,
and three of Stanford's four Jen
nifers. Jen Potok, Jen Rowland,
and Jen Bloomer are all also
recovering from injury.
"I'm supposed to keep my knee
brace on," said a smiling
Rafanelli, who removed it in the
second half of the game.
"It's still a patchwork," com
mented Andeberhan on the medi
cal status of his team. "But given
our situation, I'm very pleased."
Foudy was also pleased with
her teammates. "We tried a new
system today — three pinched-in
halfbacks. We pulled the halfbacks
in tighter, and it worked well. We
had opportunities and stayed
composed. We finished the oppor
tunities, which is what you have
to do."
Card notes
Rafanelli, an Oakland native who
was accepted early to Harvard, enjoyed a
great dead of attention in the game. Not
only did Crimson defenders warily watch
the U.S. National Team member, but a
large group of fans from her dorm, Rin
conada, showed up to give vocal support.
She said that her dormmates' appear
ance pumped her up.
"Thanks, Rinc! You guys are awe
some!" she said.
Foudy's two goals bring her total to
seven on the season, passing Rafanelli
for the team lead. Rafanelli has six goals
on the year and Rowland has five.
The Cardinal returns to action at 4
p.m. Wednesday afternoon at Maloney
Field. Stanford will meet the UCLA Bru
ins at that time.

by Reilly.
As the second period began, a
Stanford player encouraged her
teammates, shouting, "Let's win
this!" A Harvard player replied by
shouting to her comrades, "Get a
goal!" The two opposing players
unwittingly but tellingly revealed
what their respective teams

wanted to achieve in the game.
With just under six minutes
left in the game, Mclntyre
sparked another brilliant play
when she fired a pass with pin
point accuracy to Foudy, who
received the ball while sandwiched
between two defenders. Foudy
was the only Cardinal player in
Crimson territory at the time, and
she squeezed ahead of her press
ing opponents to put the ball in
the corner of the net.
Cardinal coach Berhane Ande
berhan was relieved that his ailing
team won the game with no
injuries or re-injuries. Andeber
han has not been able to play sev
eral of his top players at 100 per
cent. These include prolific scorer
Sarah Rafanelli, the Cardinal's
latest in a growing line of frosh
phenoms, senior Denise Denney,
and three of Stanford's four Jen
nifers. Jen Potok, Jen Rowland,
and Jen Bloomer are all also
recovering from injury.
"I'm supposed to keep my knee
brace on," said a smiling
Rafanelli, who removed it in the
second half of the game.
"It's still a patchwork," com
mented Andeberhan on the medi
cal status of his team. "But given
our situation, I'm very pleased."
Foudy was also pleased with
her teammates. "We tried a new
system today — three pinched-in
halfbacks. We pulled the halfbacks
in tighter, and it worked well. We
had opportunities and stayed
composed. We finished the oppor
tunities, which is what you have
to do."
Card notes
Rafanelli, an Oakland native who
was accepted early to Harvard, enjoyed a
great dead of attention in the game. Not
only did Crimson defenders warily watch
the U.S. National Team member, but a
large group of fans from her dorm, Rin
conada, showed up to give vocal support.
She said that her dormmates' appear
ance pumped her up.
"Thanks, Rinc! You guys are awe
some!" she said.
Foudy's two goals bring her total to
seven on the season, passing Rafanelli
for the team lead. Rafanelli has six goals
on the year and Rowland has five.
The Cardinal returns to action at 4
p.m. Wednesday afternoon at Maloney
Field. Stanford will meet the UCLA Bru
ins at that time.

Junior Elizabeth Joneschild notched an assist for the second straight game Saturday when the No. 11 Cardinal handled Harvard 4-0. Stan
ford Is 7-1 overall this year and has not lost at home since 1988.
And the answers are: 1) About
3,000 miles; 2) Several shades of
red; and 3) four goals.
BING! What are three differ
ences between the Stanford Cardi
nal and the Harvard Crimson?
Correct!
The No. 11 Cardinal women's
soccer team easily handled their
opponents from That Other
School Saturday at Maloney Field,
defeating them 4-0. Stanford's
record now stands at 7-1, four of

those wins have been shutouts,
and the Cardinal has outscored its
opponents 22-4.
The Cardinal bolstered that
record with a 5-0 win at U.S.
International Sept. 13 before los
ing their first game of the season
at UC-Santa Barbara 1-0 Sept. 16.
The Gauchos played in the NCAA
tournament last year, and they
are ranked in the top 20 this sea
son.
Stanford and UCSB played
fairly evenly, but the Cardinal was
not at its best, due in part to sev
eral injuries to key players.

Despite this, Stanford played the
Gauchos even for 85 minutes
before surrendering the game's
only goal with five minutes left to
play.
Before the game with Harvard,
Stanford also defeated St. Mary's
2-1 last Wednesday at Maloney.
The Cardinal lost to the Gaels 1-0
last year in Moraga, and that
defeat was a big blow to the team's
postseason aspirations. This
year's contest looked similar as
the Gaels scored the only goal in
the first half.
But after intermission the Car

dinal totally outplayed St. Mary's.
Finally, with 20 minutes left in
the game, sophomore midfielder
Carolyn Einstein was fouled out
side the penalty box on the right
side. Junior fullback Heather
Mclntyre hit a perfect cross on the
resultant free kick and sophomore
Julie Foudy outjumped the oppo
sition, headed the ball off the
inside of the right post and
watched it roll over the goal line.
Five minutes later junior for
ward Elizabeth Joneschild hit a
through pass to senior forward
Jen Rowland who had beaten the

defense. Rowland, displaying the
speed that has earned her the
nickname "Rocket" despite a large
knee brace, beat the goalie with a
shot to the far post to give Stan
ford the victory.
Against Harvard, Stanford
started a trend when the team
penetrated deep into Crimson ter
ritory immediately after the kick
off. Seven minutes later Einstein
tallied her first goal of the season.
She fired a shot that appeared to
go through the hands of Beth
Reilly, Harvard's goalkeeper. The
ball bounced off the right post and
spun in to give Einstein the unas
sisted goal.
The Crimson defense soon
found itself overworked, and 15
minutes into the game Einstein
popped her second goal of the sea
son off a pass by Joneschild.
That was rapidly followed by a
beautifully placed assist from
freshman Glynnis Roberts to
Foudy. Roberts booted a high, arc
ing pass from the outside to
Foudy, who headed it in among a
crowd of defenders.
Harvard, bolstered by a num
ber of fans, began to raise the level
of their game at that point and
missed a couple of opportunities
to cut Stanford's lead late in the
first half and early in the second.
Of course, that was partly due to
the exploits of Elise Edwards, one
of the nation's top goalkeepers.
But the Crimson could not do
more than occasionally match the
play of the home team. And
although neither team could score
in the middle of the game, there
were some spectacular plays. One
was a save by Edwards, who used
volleyball skills to deflect a Crim
son corner kick.
At another point, Mclntyre
provided some entertainment for
the home fans. Mclntyre took the
ball near midfleld and cut and
slashed all the way to the fringe of
Reilly's box. She passed the ball
up to sophomore midfielder Kirby
Seale, whose head shot was saved
by Reilly.
