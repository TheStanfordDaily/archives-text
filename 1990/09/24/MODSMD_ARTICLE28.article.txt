# Water polo scores a score in dismantling of SCU
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
After playing its first nine
games of the year on the road, the
Stanford water polo team must
have been looking forward to play
ing at home for the first time this
year.
And last Friday in the home
opener against Santa Clara, the
Cardinal showed just how happy
it was to be back home, overpow
ering the Broncos 20-3.
It may have been the Cardi
nal's first home game, but for
Santa Clara, it was the team's
first game of the year — any
where. And after the dominating
Cardinal performance, it was also
Santa Clara's first loss of the sea
son.
Nearly everyone got to join in
the fun of being back home, as 14
different players scored for the
No. 4 Cardinal. Six players —
senior Rick McNair, sophomore
Chris Smith, junior Bob Sternfels,
freshman Antonio Busquets,
freshman Michael Fehmers, and
junior Greg Morris — each scored
two goals to lead the team to the
easy victory.
Those at the match also saw
some history made, as four Cardi
nal freshmen scored their first
career goals. In addition to Bus
quets' two goals, Matya Sitfak,
Tom Mitchell, and Bill Maguy also
put the ball into a collegiate net
for the first time ever.

Though the Santa Clara result
really does not show how good the
Cardinal team is, earlier matches
at the University of the Pacific —
the eighth-ranked team in the
country — and at the UC-Irvine
tournament have shown that the
Cardinal will once again be con
tending for the national title.
In the match against Pacific,
which was held the day before the
Santa Clara contest, the Cardinal
defeated their hosts by a score of
10-5. After the first half Stanford
only led 5-4, but four unanswered
third-quarter goals enabled the
team to take the lead for good.
The Cardinal's scoring leader,
senior field player Greg Olson, led
the team to the victory with three
goals. Olson, who also added a
goal in the Santa Clara rout, now
has 18 goals in the first 10 games.
In the Irvine tournament,
which included eight of the
nation's top 10 teams, the Cardi
nal garnered the third place tro
phy by defeating UC-Santa Bar
bara by a score of 7-5. Earlier in
the tournament, the Cardinal suf
fered its second loss of the season,
as the No. 2-ranked UCLA Bruins
defeated Stanford 12-6. Stan
ford's only other loss came at the
hands of No. 1-ranked California.
In another early tournament
match, the Cardinal defeated Pep
perdine 11-7, with McNair
putting in three goals.
Perhaps the most impressive
victory of the young season for the

Nearly everyone got
to |oin in the fun of
being back home, as
14 different players
scored.

Cardinal came in its second match
of the tournament against then-
No. 4 Long Beach State. The Car
dinal convincingly beat the 49ers
10-3, as freshman goalie Larry
Bercutt made eight saves and
combined with his teammates to
stymie the 49er offense. Sopho
more J.T. Matarangas and senior
Colin Keely both scored two goals
to give the Cardinal all the offense
it needed to win the game.
In the opening contest of the
tournament, the Cardinal
destroyed 14th-ranked UC-San
Diego 15-4. Olson and Fehmers
had four goals apiece to lead the
team to a 9-0 first-half lead that
was never contested. Olson scored
10 goals in the five tournament
games.
The team's next game will be
right here at Stanford in the Nor-
Cal Tournament which will be
held Sept. 28-30.
And yes, the Cardinal hopes its
home pool will be as nice to the
team in the tournament as it was
against Santa Clara. As they say,
there's no place like home.
