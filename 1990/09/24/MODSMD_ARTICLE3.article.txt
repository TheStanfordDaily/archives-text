# Kennedy welcomes freshmen
## President seeks to better 'tradition of doing well' 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy invited Stanford's
100 th entering class to help the
University become "better still"
as Stanford heads into the the
next century.
In his speech Friday night to
the Class of 1994, Kennedy
urged the entering freshman to
"be knowledgeable, critical con
sumers of what Stanford and its

faculty do to teach you."
"We have a strong tradition
of doing well, and of taking
advice in order to do even bet
ter," Kennedy said.
Kennedy's speech in Memo
rial Auditorium was part of the
traditional Orientation welcome
program. The evening also fea
tured an address by Dean of
Admissions Jean Fetter,
speeches by two Council of Pres
idents members and Orienta
tion coordinator Emily Simas,

the Fleet Street Singers' rap
version of the Stanford hymn,
countless bursts of applause and
several standing ovations.
Kennedy cited the revision of
the Western Culture program as
an example of the University's
openness to change. In response
to criticisms of the new Cul
tures, Ideas and Values pro
gram, Kennedy said, "Some crit

quences of this revision would
mark the end of civilization as we
know it."
But, Kennedy continued,
"there is a growing sense — here
and elsewhere — that what we
did was right."
Echoing last year's Orienta
tion speech, Kennedy also cau
tioned the freshman to "cultivate
a friendly skepticism" toward
those attempting to gain support
for their agendas. "Be awake to
ulterior motive, and resist those
who proselytize," Kennedy said.
"Remember, finally, that the task
of those who teach you here is not
to give you their ideas or their val
ues, but to give you the capacity
and the intellectual tools to
choose your own."
COP members Jamie Green
and Goodwin Liu followed
Kennedy, offering upperclass
advice and understanding. Their
speeches stood in stark contrast
to the politically charged COP
speech delivered last year at the
event by Ingrid Nava, who is also
a member of this year's slate.
Green offered sympathy for
those freshman who will face dif
ficulty in making the transition
from high school and those who
may feel lonely here. "It may take
time before you find your niche,"
she said, "and at times, even more
than you'd like, you may be
lonely."
Liu, a former co-director of
Stanford's "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference, urged fresh
man to take advantage of public
service opportunities. "When you
contemplate your ambitions,
don't just think in terms of dol

lars and cents, power and pres
tige," Liu said. "Leadership in
today's world involves compas
sion, social responsibility and ser
vice toward improving the human
condition."
Fetter kicked off the evening
with a speech packed with statis
tics about the entering class. For
the first time since she arrived at
Stanford, Fetter said, members of
the incoming class hailed from all
50 states.
