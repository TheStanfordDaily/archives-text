# Ready for the next Big One?
## 'Safety silos' buried around campus; food for 10,000 
### Jonathan Fritz 
Digging deep to prepare for the
next big earthquake, Stanford's
Office of Housing and Food Ser
vices has buried 12 cylinders full
of food and emergency supplies in
different locations around cam
pus.
These "safety silos" hold
enough food for 10,000 people for
about two days, according to Bar
bara Tiernan, systems coordina
tor for Health and Safety Systems
in Housing and Food Services.
Among the supplies included in
each silo are digging tools for
building latrines, tarps and poles
which can be assembled into shel
ters for those in need of medical
help, first aid supplies and 15,833
individual survival kits, enough
for every student housed on cam
pus.
Each kit contains a blanket, a
two-gallon water jug, a towel, tis
sues and an anti-bacterial face
mask. The residences' hot water
tanks would provide the students
with clean water. Hoses long
enough to reach the outside of
buildings would be attached to the
tanks so students would not have
to enter potentially unsafe resi
dences for water.
The entire cost of the safety

silo project was about $200,000,
including the supplies, digging the
holes and designing and building
the silos. Since nothing like the
silos exists on the market today,
Housing and Food Services had to
design them itself and have them
custom-made.
Although many University pro
grams are suffering from budget
cuts, Tiernan said the expense of
the project was justified because
Housing and Food Services is obli
gated to provide food and shelter
for Stanford students. The silos
ensure that this obligation can be
met even after a mqjor catastro
phe.
Each of the 12 silos is buried in
an open field close to a dormitory.
These areas, which are marked as
earthquake assembly areas, would
essentially become encampments
after a big quake. They are located
close to all of the residences to
allow students to stay near their
houses and with their dormmates.
If a major earthquake does
occur, each residence would send a
runner to the Emergency Opera
tions Center located at the Stan
ford Police Department. The run
ner would be given the exact loca
tion of both the silo for his or her
residence and the shovels to dig it
up. After unearthing the silo, stu-

The silos would be
opened only Ins 7.5
or larger quake.

dents would be expected to form
rescue, first aid and support
squads.
All of the silos would be used
only in the event of a very large
quake, probably 7.5 or greater on
the Richter scale, according to
Tiernan. If the silos had existed
during last October's 7.1 Loma
Prieta earthquake, Tiernan said,
"Perhaps one assigned to the Row
Houses might have been opened,
but it would have been a judgment
caU."
The silos were buried five feet
underground, where the tempera
ture is a constant 58 degrees, to
increase the lifespan of the food
and supplies. Supposedly, they
will have to be restocked only once
every 15 years.
Barring a disaster, very few
people will get to see what the
safety silos look like in the
ground. But one will be on display
above ground in White Plaza on
Oct. 17, the anniversaiy of last
year's earthquake.
