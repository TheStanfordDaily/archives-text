# Bookstore remodeling far from finished
## Plans had called for fall completion 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
As the Stanford Bookstore pre
pares for the fall rush of students
buying textbooks and supplies,
many may be wondering why the
Bookstore couldn't have rushed a
bit more in finishing its renova
tion.

Renovations to the
Bookstore, the
largest campus book
store in the country,
are not expected to
be completed until
January.

The remodeling of the Book
store was targeted to be completed
by this week, according to Ken
Shark, Bookstore retail services
manager. But now Shark said he
expects construction to be fin
ished by January.
The contactor met with several
unforeseen difficulties after set
ting the original completion date,
Shark said. He called remodeling
"more difficult ... than starting
from scratch."
As part of the remodeling, the

Bookstore expects to expand its
selection of 135,000 titles to at
least 225,000 titles to create the
largest university bookstore in the
country. In addition, it will add a
periodical section and expand the
candy counter area.
The space for the new books
was made available by moving the
Bookstore's warehouse space

from its basement to a location
across the bay in Newark.
The renovated basement
includes two levels — one housing
the Microdisc computer area and
one holding textbooks. Clothing
and souvenirs will be moved
upstairs.
Shark described several ways
the construction has inconve

nienced customers, including the
added noise and smaller aisles.
"It's a little crowded," he said.
But most students shopping in
the Bookstore seemed unfazed or
even a bit cynical.
"It's quite usual for Stanford
construction projections," one
student said. "I'm kind of used to
it by now."
