### 
Students new to Stanford
may have received a rude awak
ening yestefday morning as the
first earthquake of the aca
demic year rattled the Univer
sity and surrounding areas.
By 6:36 a.m. Sunday, fresh
man and transfers already had
a chance to prove, as University
President Donald Kennedy said
in his Orientation address Fri
day, that there was "not a
wimp" among them.
Although the temblor only
registered 3.0 on the Richter
scale, it was felt strongly on the
Stanford campus. The epicen
ter was seven miles southwest
of nearby Menlo Park, the state

Office of Emergency Services
said.
Another quake measuring
4.0 on the Richter scale
occurred at 8 p.m. Saturday.
This temblor was centered
three miles south of San Juan
Bautista, about 85 miles south
of San Francisco.
No injuries or damage were
reported from either earth
quake, authorities said.
The readings for both
quakes were preliminary,
according to state authorities.
They were measured by the
U.S. Geological Survey, located
in Menlo Park.
