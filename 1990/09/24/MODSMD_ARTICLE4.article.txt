# KAs suspended for romp in Reno
## University imposes one-month penalty 
### Robert L. Jamieson, Jr. Staff writer 
As campus Greeks prepare to
ring in the new school year with
festive celebrations, the Kappa
Alpha fraternity will have to put
the beer and soda on ice during a
one-month suspension by the
University.
The suspension, effective
Wednesday, resulted from unruly
behavior by fraternity members
last year during a spring formal at
Harrah's Resort in Lake Tahoe,
Nev.
A letter sent by Harrah's offi
cials to Stanford stated that fra
ternity members posed as alumni
and pretended to be over the legal
drinking age. Members also
ruined tablecloths and disrupted
the resort, according to the letter.
Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Michael Ramsey-Perez said the
"real issue" leading to the suspen
sion of the KAs concerned the
organization's members' repre
senting themselves as people over
21 in on alcohol and gambling sit
uation.
Ramsey-Perez said the frater
nity members' initial lack of can
dor about the nature of their
offenses was also a factor con
tributing to the suspension.
"We are disappointed about the
University's measure," said KA
president Matt Hansen, a senior.
"But as far as we are concerned
we made a mistake. We will take
the time off and restructure our
off-campus party planning proto
col."
In addition to curtailing social
activities, the fraternity is draft
ing a report suggesting how other
campus organizations can avoid

'As far as we are
concerned, we
made a mistake.
We will take the
time off and
restructure our off
campus party-plan
ning protocol.'

disruptive off-campus social
events. The report will be submit
ted to University officials at the
end of next month.
"We have received wonderful
support from the KAs thus far,"
Ramsey-Perez said. "They are
coming up with plans for how stu
dent groups can have off-campus
events safely and honestly. It's not
simply the KAs, it's everyone —
the dorms, other groups — who
reserves places off-campus that
need to be aware of potentially
problematic situations.
But for the KAs, who have
maintained a record of good
behavior for the past few years,
the suspension is hard to swallow.
"In our opinion KA tries to be a
model for the Greek system and
our punishment seems a bit
harsh," Hansen said.
"The [Harrah's incident] is
extremely isolated. We want to
make sure it stays that way," he
added.
