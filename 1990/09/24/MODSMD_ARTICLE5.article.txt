# Health Dept. bids Creamery unfond farewell

Behind closed doors stands a jukebox with out
dated, warped records. "$2.00 minimum per person"
signs are still taped up over each booth. Stained
menus, a "Space Station" pinball machine and
greasy bar and table tops collect dust.
And that's where all of those objects familiar to
the Stanford student's heart will remain — behind
closed doors. On August 15, the University Cream
ery closed its doors for the final time.
Located on University Avenue, the Creamery had
been a popular off-campus establishment since it
opened in 1917. The restaurant was the last 24-hour
eatery in downtown Palo Alto.
However, recent years proved troubling for the
restaurant, as operating hours were reduced and
food quality declined. Earlier this year, the Creamery
was cited by the Santa Clara County Health Depart
ment for safety and sanitary violations.
"Generally, the history of the Creamery hasn't
been too good," said Carl Stahr, supervising environ
mental health specialist for the county. "We have
records of customer complaints dating back to 1966,
and inspection reports from 1982."
Regular inspections by the health department
