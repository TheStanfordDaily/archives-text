# Health Dept. bids Creamery unfond farewell

Behind closed doors stands a jukebox with out
dated, warped records. "$2.00 minimum per person"
signs are still taped up over each booth. Stained
menus, a "Space Station" pinball machine and
greasy bar and table tops collect dust.
And that's where all of those objects familiar to
the Stanford student's heart will remain — behind
closed doors. On August 15, the University Cream
ery closed its doors for the final time.
Located on University Avenue, the Creamery had
been a popular off-campus establishment since it
opened in 1917. The restaurant was the last 24-hour
eatery in downtown Palo Alto.
However, recent years proved troubling for the
restaurant, as operating hours were reduced and
food quality declined. Earlier this year, the Creamery
was cited by the Santa Clara County Health Depart
ment for safety and sanitary violations.
"Generally, the history of the Creamery hasn't
been too good," said Carl Stahr, supervising environ
mental health specialist for the county. "We have
records of customer complaints dating back to 1966,
and inspection reports from 1982."
Regular inspections by the health department

found numerous violations,
including malfunctioning refrig
erators, cockroaches, leaky pipes,
unsanitary bathrooms and dirty
walls.
"Our inspections found that
the Creamery stored numerous
items improperly, including ham
burger patties, bacon, tofu and
cottage cheese," said Stahr.
In December, 1989, the county
sent the Creamery a Voluntary
Condemnation and Destruction
Order which asked the owners to
voluntarily close the restaurant.
In August, the owners finally
agreed to shut its doors perma
nently.
Sandra Kao, who owned and

operated the Creamery since 1977
with her husband Louis, said she
was unaware of any health viola
tions. "We closed because the
lease ran out," Kao said, "and we
chose not to renew it."
However, property owner Sally
Hantz said the lease was not set
to terminate until Oct. 1.
"There's no question that the
Creamery closed early," Hantz
said. "I assume it was due to the
health violations, which I had
been concerned about for a num
ber of years."
Louis Kao refused to comment.
The Kaos also own the Foster
Freeze restaurant on El Camino
Real in Palo Alto.
The Creamery will be replaced
by "B&B's Diner," a 1950'5-style
eatery complete with neon decor
and blue-plate specials. The new
owner, Niki Frazier, is a fourth

generation Palo Altan who named
the diner after her children, Bret
and Brooke.
According to her husband,
Mark, the Creamery will be com
pletely refurnished and redeco
rated for the new diner. "We're
going to pull everything out of the
place," he said, "and put in a lot of
neon, formica tiles, red leather
booths and waitresses in bowling
shirts. It'll be a lot of fun."
Menu plans for the new diner
boast 1/3-pound hamburgers,
shakes and pie slices. Tentatively,
the restaurant will close at 11
p.m. on weekdays and 2 a.m. on
weekends. The couple may keep it
open until 4 a.m. during finals
week.
"We wanted to keep it open 24
hours, but we wanted to make
sure the place was kept clean,"
Frazier said.
