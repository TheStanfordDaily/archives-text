## Iraq threatens to attack Israel and destroy Mideast oil fields Security Council may tighten embargo with air blockade 
### 
(AP) Iraq threatened yesterday
to destroy Middle East oil fields
and attack Israel if other nations
tried to force it from Kuwait.
At the same time, Iraq appar
ently sought to improve relations
with France, admitting that its
soldiers had raided the French
ambassador's residence in Kuwait
ten days ago. It apologized for the
incursion, which sparked a wave
of retaliatory expulsions and
increased tensions between Iraq
and European nations.
Iraq also said it would not
attend the U.N. General Assembly
session that opens Monday
because its delegation was not
allowed to travel to New York on
Iraqi Airways. The airline has no
landing rights because of the U.N.
trade embargo.
U.N. Secretary General Perez
de Cuellar said earlier yesterday
that he planned talks with Aziz in
the coming days on Iraq's hard
line position that it will never give
up Kuwait. He said the position
was unacceptable to the United
Nations.
A State Department official in
Washington said the question of
Aziz's flight was still under con
sideration.
In warning other nations not to
try to force it to give up Kuwait,
Iraq said: "We will never allow
anybody, who ever he may be, to
strangle the people of Iraq with
out having himself strangled."
"The oil areas in Saudi Arabia
and in other states of the region,

all the oil installations, will be
rendered incapable ... and Israel
will be transformed into some
thing different from what they are
now," said an Iraqi government
statement broadcast by state-run
Radio Baghdad and monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus.
"America must realize clearly
that it is pushing the entire region
... in fact, even the whole world ...
to the brink of a bottomless abyss,
from which the region will never
see light for dozens of years," the
statement said.
Iraq's decision to stay away
from the General Assembly ses
sion was reported by the official
Iraqi News Agency. In any event,
Iraq was hardly likely to get a
warm welcome at the United
Nations. The Security Council
was to meet Tuesday to consider
tightening the trade embargo
against Baghdad with an air
blockade. Baghdad was also
expected to come in for
widespread condemnation in the
General Assembly debate.
Meanwhile, a charter flight
carrying 111 evacuees from Iraq
and Kuwait left London for North
Carolina yesterday. The State
Department said this was the last
U.S.-chartered airlift planned
from Iraq.
At the London stopover,
exhausted evacuees told of hard
ship and terror in Kuwait and
Iraq. Western women and chil
dren have been allowed to leave,
but the Baghdad government has

Jacqui Jones, a Scot, said she
was forced to leave her terminally
ill husband behind. "I didn't know
I had so many tears," she told
reporters.
Twenty-eight of the 140 pas
sengers on Saturday's flight
remained in London.
Yesterday was also the second
day of talks in Washington among
wealthy industrialized nations,
held as part of the annual meet
ings of the International Mone
tary Fund and the World Bank.
Repercussions of the gulf crisis
took center stage.
The United States is leading a
bid to channel billions of dollars to
the so-called front-line states of
Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, and
other countries whose economies
have been hit by the trade
embargo against Iraq and the
steep rise in oil prices.
Although broad outlines of the
plan were agreed upon, British
Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major told reporters that specific
amounts of assistance and which
countries should be helped had
not yet been worked out.
