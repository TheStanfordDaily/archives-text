Welcome Back!
We're Changing to Meet Today's Needs.
Cowell Student Health Center: A new look and new services to provide you
with the best in medical health care.
There's a new look
We've upgraded Urgent Care and the front
lobby to provide more patient privacy and a
more pleasing appearance. No appointments
are needed for urgent problems. Our nursing
staff is on duty from Bamto 11 pm, seven
days a week, (open 7 am on weekends).
Physicians are available on location from
9 am to 5 pm weekdays and on call 24 hours a
day. Overnight care at the infirmary is no
longer available, but alternatives are available
if indicated.
If you have a medical emergency after 11 pm,
you should go to the emergency room at
Stanford Hospital. Cowell does not cover
emergency room visits.
The Cowell Pharmacy opens this fall
Scheduled to be open in October, the phar
macy at Cowell will provide both prescription
and over-the-counter medications at competi
tive prices.
Health Promotion Program
Visit Cowell's 2nd floor and learn how to
reduce your risk for disease and how to
increase your overall well being and health.
Become a peer health educator or just drop in
to the Health Promotion Program to learn
more about sexual health, HIV/AIDS preven
tion, alcohol and other drugs, nutrition and
fitness.
The Aerobics Program is back by popular
demand. There will be a fee of $8 per quarter.
For information about programs and the
fall schedule, call 723-0821.
Physical Therapy
Back at it usual location downstairs at
Cowell, Physical Therapy is available, by
referral, on a fee-for-service basis. Initial
evaluation is $25; $50 for the next 5 visits.
Post-surgical therapy is charged as part of
surgical aftercare. Charges are covered by
most insurance plans, once your deductible
is satisfied.
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS)
CAPS is in two locations: 2nd floor at Cowell,
and Huston House, 575 Salvatierra. CAPS is
the primary counseling resource for registered
students ( and partners on a fee-for service
basis) who are feeling emotional distress. For
appointments call 723-3785.
CAPS staff is available 24 hours for urgent
situations. Due to the closure of the infirmary,
students who need more than phone contact
between 11 pm and Bam are seen at the
Stanford Emergency Room. CAPS does not
charge for its services in these situations; how
ever, students will be billed by Stanford
Hospital for use of the Emergency Room.
Special diagnostic tests at PAMC
covered by Cowell
Routine x-ray and labratory tests are avail
able free at Cowell and PAMC (Palo Alto
Medical Clinic). Cowell will cover special
diagnostic tests at PAMC up to $200/ test.
Charges above this amount should be
submitted to insurance.
