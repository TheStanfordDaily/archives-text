contains more than 300 science and
engineering equations, as well as
the periodic table, a constants' library,
and a multi-equation solver. It's like
having a stack of reference lx>oks right
at your fingertips.
The HP 48SX calculator is so advanced,
it will change the way you solve prob
lems forever. It integrates graphics
with calculus, lets you enter equations
the way you write them, and does
automatic unit management-
Check your campus bookstore or HP
retailer for HP's range of calculators
and special back-to-school offers.
Then check out the calculators that
are years ahead of their class.
There is a better way.
