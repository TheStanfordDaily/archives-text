ington International Studies Council to recommend qualified
students to study for one year or for one or two terms. Lower
Junior status is required, and graduate study is available. Stu
dents are directly enrolled in their colleges and receivr transcripts
from their Oxford college: this is NOT a program conducted by a
U.S. College in Oxford. 3.2 minimum Index in major required.
An alternative program which is sponsored by a U.S. Univer
sity is available for students with minimum indexes of 2.7. Stu
dents will have social and athletic rights in an Oxford college, and
the fees are substantially less.
Since 1986. students recommended by WISC have been
directly enrolled (and received transcripts from) five of forty col
leges and halls which compose the University of Oxford; these stu
dents previously studied at over 60 leading U.S. colleges. Written
or telephone evaluations from previous students are available
upon request.
