Budget woes continue

deficit jumped $52.8 billion to a record $241.7
billion in August, but could be reduced before
the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, the Treasury

11 months of 1989 boosted the spending imbal

ever, fell short of the one-month record of

Jordan sends food to Iraq
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — A convoy of trucks
loaded with food rolled out of Amman yester
day bound for Baghdad with horns honking,
flags flying and hundreds of Jordanians cheer
ing the violation of the U.N. embargo.
The 30 trucks, hauling rice, powdered milk
and other foodstuffs rationed in Iraq, were dec
orated with red, green and black Jordanian and
Iraqi flags. Banners declared the food a gift
"from the Stone Children, the Heros of the
Intifadeh in Palestine to the Children of Iraq."
The convoy was a small but clear violation of
the U.N. embargo banning shipments to Iraq
unless cleared by the Security Council, and a
symbol of the enthusiastic support Iraq enjoys
here.
