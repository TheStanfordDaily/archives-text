## Dow Jones' 14-month low intensifies fears of recession 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” The stock market
fell sharply to a 14-month low yesterday,
battered by the one-two punch of rising oil
prices and trouble in the banking industry.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
tumbled 59.41 to 2,452.97, its lowest close
since it stood at 2,452.77 on July 3, 1989.
Declining issues overwhelmed advances
by about 6 to 1 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 233 up, 1,432 down and 326
unchanged.
Analysts said investors were bracing for
more bad tidings from the banking industry
after Chase Manhattan Corp.'s announce
ment Friday of a dividend cut, new reserves
for loan losses, and a staff reduction of
5,000 jobs.
The news by itself did not come as any
great surprise to Wall Street, which was
well aware of widespread credit problems
facing the banks.
Nevertheless, it evidently served to
intensify the recession worries that have
been depressing stock prices since midsum
mer.
Brokers noted that the market also had
to contend with further increases in world
oil prices. Crude oil futures for November
delivery jumped $2.82 a barrel to $38.25 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
Chase Manhattan stock fell 1 5/8 to 11
1/8 on turnover of more than 5 million
shares, which ranked it as the most active

NYSE issue.
Among other leading money-center bank
issues, Citicorp dropped 1/2 to 15 1/4;
Chemical Banking 1 7/8 to 15 1/8; Manufac
turers Hanover 1/4 to 22 3/4; First Chicago
1 3/8 to 16 7/8, and Bankers Trust New
York 2 to 32 1/4.
Manufacturers Hanover, which recently
declared a regular quarterly dividend, said
it expected to be able to keep its payout at
that rate.
Losers among the blue-chip industrials
included Boeing, down 2 7/8 at 40 3/8; Gen
eral Electric, down 1 3/8 at 54 1/2; Philip
Morris, down 7/8 at 43 7/8, and Interna
tional Business Machines, down 1 3/4 at
105.
Airline stocks also posted some notable
losses as the oil-price spiral continued. UAL
fell 8 1/2 to 92 1/4 amid new misgivings
about the chances to revive a buyout plan
for the company.
Delta Air Lines, which estimated "signif
icantly worse" results for the quarter end
ing Sunday, lost 1 3/4 to 52 7/8.
Oil stocks were mostly lower as well. But
precious-metals issues rose as the price of
gold climbed above $400 an ounce.
Volume on the floor of the Big Board
came to 162.21 million shares, against
201.05 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE
listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 194.23
million shares.
