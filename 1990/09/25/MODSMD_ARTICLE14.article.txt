# Bush praises de Klerk's efforts to end apartheid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush said
yesterday that South Africa's campaign to abolish
white supremacist rule is irreversible and assured
President F.W. de Klerk that he would oppose new
conditions for lifting economic sanctions.
"These conditions are clear-cut and are not
open to re-interpretation. And I do not believe in
moving the goalposts," Bush said, referring to
requirements South Africa must fulfill before the
sanctions will be suspended. The sanctions were
imposed in 1986 over then President Reagan's
veto.
Bush also said all political groups in South
Africa "have a special responsibility to support the
process of peaceful transition."
De Klerk, the first South African leader to visit
the United States since 1945, assured Bush that
the process of reform is irreversible, and Bush
echoed that sentiment.
"We will not turn back," de Klerk said.
The leaders met at the White House for two
hours, first in the Oval Office and again over
lunch. The meeting was a showcase of U.S. politi
cal support for de Klerk's efforts to guide South
Africa toward a post-apartheid democratic system.
More than 100 anti-apartheid demonstrators
marched outside the White House during the visit.
"Bush is an accomplice to a colossal public rela
tions fraud which attempts to portray F.W. de
Klerk as a moderate reformer," said Randall
Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a private anti
apartheid group.
Robinson said de Klerk's trip "sends a false and
dangerous message that South Africa is on its way
to change."
Bush praised de Klerk at a farewell ceremony in
front of the sun-drenched South Lawn.
"Clearly, the time has come to encourage and
assist the emerging new South Africa," Bush said.
Behind the leaders, a black Marine held the flag of

South Africa; a white Marine held the American
flag.
But Bush said that despite "the dramatic
Erogress that we salute here today," South Africa
asn't moved far enough to meet the conditions
for removing economic sanctions.
South Africa has not released all political pris
oners and has not lifted the state of emergency in

the Natal province. Further, it has not repealed a
population registration act that requires citizens
to be classified by race — a key part of the
apartheid system.
On the other hand, Bush said, "the move away
from apartheid toward a new political reality is
indeed irreversible and much has already hap
pened."
