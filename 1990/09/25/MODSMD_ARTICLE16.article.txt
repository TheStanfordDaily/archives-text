## Time for action 
### 
The COP must reach out
to every single student
to restore its integrity

The old saying about actions and
words is true, especially in poli
tics. There's been a lot of talk
about improving the image of the
ASSU, but nothing seems to have
changed.
The Council of Presidents must
reach out to all students to regain
their trust. It needs to reinforce the
idea that it provides many worthwhile
contributions to the Stanford commu
nity.
And sadly, it's going to be tough
sledding.
For those of you keeping track, the
People's Platform slate won over its
rival, Students First, by only 89 votes.
After hearing the news, COP member
Goodwin Liu said, "We have to see why
49 percent (of the student body) didn't
vote for us."
Coming back fresh from summer
vacations, many students have proba
bly forgotten what issues there were in
last spring's contest. Some were (and
continue to be) alienated and daunted
by the People's Platform's emphasis
on multiculturalism. Many didn't care
in the first place.
Although the COP has insisted that
it has been at the forefront of making
Stanford a more comfortable environ
ment, many students clearly disagree.
Nearly two-thirds of the student
body voted to hold a recall election for
the COFJ reflecting a belief that the

current government had attained
office under questionable circum
stances.
One of the arguments the COP
used against a recall election was that
the leaders couldn't plan its goals over
the summer. Hopefully, a good deal of
time was spent brainstorming ways to
improve relations with students.
Some concrete steps that the COP
should take:
• Raising money to compensate for
student services affected by University
budget cuts.
• Streamlining its own operations
and allocating money more efficiently.
• Maintaining open flies for stu
dents who want to hold their govern
ment accountable.
• Holding periodic "town meetings"
for students to air their concerns.
• Expanding dorm polling so that
off-campus and graduate students get
their voices heard.
Whatever the path, the COP has to
constantly focus on its goal of serving
students and put antagonism with
rival student leaders last. And from all
indications, they're off to a good start.
It is currently planning a leadership
summit to attract students from all
backgrounds, from those who run
important organizations to those who
view the ASSU as a bunch of self-serv
ing resume packers. Hopefully the
COP will be able to draw in such
diverse views to help them assess
where to go from here.
Elections are two quarters away.
It's time to focus on the real business
of government: making Stanford life
thrilling and stimulating.
