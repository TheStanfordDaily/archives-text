I
t
! lamin my nth year of graduate study
at Stanford. At the end of my first year, I
was lucky enough to be kicked out of
University housing. I have had to move
back to campus recently for lack of better
options. Ever since, University Facilities
has lived up to its reputation.
i When I received the keys to my apart
ment at the beginning of the summer, I
was asked to sign a form agreeing to
accept housing that had not been
inspected (and indeed it was dirty).
Unless I was prepared to be homeless, I
had no option but to sign that form!

I was lucky enough to
be kicked out of Uni
versity housing.

Despite my request, no one ever
turned up to clean (or inspect) the apart
ment during the summer. I received the
charge-sheet from the housing inspector
detailing how I have mistreated my
apartment. I am perfectly willing to be
responsible for keeping the apartment
the way I got it, but to expect that I
should be responsible for all the past res
idents is a bit too much. I thought that it
was common courtesy to intimate the
date of inspection in advance. Needless
to say, I was wrong.
Furthermore, it seems that the
administration does not believe in main
taining the apartments — the paint and
the tiles are falling apart in many places!
To top it all, my telephone line was
promptly disconnected for no apparent
reason . When we were forced to switch
from Pacific Bell to Stanford, we were
told that the quality of service would not
suffer. But, as I have discovered, Stan-

ford does not have a telephone operator
who can remedy such foul-ups. All that
the operator would tell you (not their
fault surely) is that you should contact
the communication services during the
office hours.
At a time when the administration is
gearing up to laud itself for 100 years of
existence, maybe it should take a closer
look at the indifference with which it
treats its resident students.

T-shirts imply
racist myth
In the week that we have been on
campus, we have noticed several stu
dents wearing T-shirts with the slogan
"Bo knows your sister" or "Bo knows
your girlfriend." At first glance, the T
shirts seem to be a clever parody of
Nike's "Bo knows" advertising cam
paign, which features black professional
athlete Bo Jackson. However, we find the
racist (and sexist) message underlying
such a slogan alarming.
Since the beginning of slavery, whites
have perpetuated the myth that black
men are sexual savages who, if unre
strained, would attack (and consequently
defile) white women. This "myth of the
black rapist," as black feminist Angela
Davis describes it, has traditionally been
used to justify innumerable beatings,
jailings and lynchings of black men.
Such unwarranted attacks on black men
have deeply tarnished our nation's his
tory.
While open lynchings no longer occur
as frequently as they did in the past, the
"myth of the black rapist" continues to
be perpetuated in a dangerously subtle
fashion. Depictions of black men as hav
ing large penises and even larger sexual
appetites abound in contemporary cul
ture. That George Bush was able to capi
talize on the fear generated by such
images in his 1988 presidential campaign

Since the beginning of slavery, whites have per
petuated the myth that black men are sexual sav
ages who would attack white women.

(through his use of the Willie Horton
case) demonstrates the depth to which
such myths pervade American society.
Finally, as Davis pointed out in a 1985
speech, the "myth of the black rapist" is,
in fact, a myth. According to Davis, over
90 percent of rapes are mfraracial, not
interracial. In addition, because white
men outnumber black men in the popu
lation, the vast majority of sexual
assaults are actually committed by
whites.
Furthermore, studies on sexual
assault have shown — and this was also

the case during the era of slavery — that
proportionately more white men rape
black women than black men rape white
women.
"Bo knows your girlfriend" T-shirts
perpetuate the "myth of the black
rapist" by playing on the false fears of
white men that black men will attack
"their" white women. We find this slo
gan, and its implicit message, both racist
and sexist.
