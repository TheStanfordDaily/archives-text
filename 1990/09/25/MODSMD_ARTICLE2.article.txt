# Despite fuss and fury, new phone system has arrived
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Whether you want it or not, it's here.
Stanford survived some hostile reactions
from graduate students and a hearing at
the California Public Utilities Commission
this summer to become the sole supplier of
telephone service on campus, regulated by
neither the state nor the Federal Communi
cations Commission.
The new student telephone service,
implemented to provide for future data and
video networks, was first proposed to the
Board of Trustees in October 1988. It has
since drawn fire from many students who
fear that Stanford's service will be more
costly and less convenient than Pacific
Bell's.
Jan Thomson, director of Communica
tion Services, said Stanford's phone system
is not operating for a profit. Thomson's
department is responsible for providing the
new services to students.
According to Thomson, Stanford has a
long-term pricing contract with the federal
government that requires the phone service
be operated on a cost-recovery basis. The
contract arose because the government

reimburses Stanford for phone use
incurred in doing government-funded
research.
The agreement, however, applies to the
overall system and not just to researchers'
phone use, Thomson said.
In any given year, gains and losses on the
phone system must be within five percent
of breaking even, Thomson said. If the Uni
versity makes a profit, rates will be
adjusted downward for the following year,
she explained.
As an example, Thomson said residents
of Escondido Village were given "rebates"
in August because they were not charged
for line activation or line service during the
transition period.
In fact, all students who lived in gradu
ate residences during summer quarter
received free local phone service, Thomson
added.
Except for the pricing agreement with
the federal government, Stanford's phone
service is not regulated by any state or fed
eral agency. A June 9 decision in a hearing
before the Public Utilities Commission
ruled that Stanford is neither a public util
ity nor a provider of shared tenant service.
The hearing was initiated by graduate

students Mike Murray, William Behrman
and Gerald LeTendre, who argued that the
new network is a public utility and that
Pacific Bell should continue to serve the
campus because Stanford is in their service
territory.
Stanford, represented by attorney
Jasper Williams, claimed to serve only its
academic users, who do not constitute the
general public. Commercial services located
in Tresidder Union, such as Wells Fargo
Bank and American Express, arc not sub
scribing to the University phone system,
Williams said.
The students also took a second position,
arguing that Stanford is a provider of
shared tenant service and therefore should
allow Pacific Bell to compete for sub
scribers.
Shared tenant guidelines govern situa
tions where tenants contribute to the main
tenance of phone service owned or managed
by the provider in a business or industrial
setting. Because Stanford does not provide
phone service to its commercial tenants,
such as the Stanford Shopping Center and
the Research Park, Williams argued that
the guidelines do not apply.
Representatives from Pacific Bell who

took the stand in the hearing sided with the
students' second position. "Our position
during the hearing was much closer to the
students'. If there's a rehearing and we par
ticipate, we will take approximately the
same position," a Pacific Bell official said.
The students are currently applying for
a rehearing.
Under the new system, Stanford charges
a $36 activation fee and a monthly flat rate
of $11 for local calls within an eight-mile
radius. Students can access service once
they arrive on campus, without having to
wait a few days as was the case with Pacific
Bell.
Although Stanford's rates are
comparable to Pacific Bell's, students lose
the advantage of free directory listing on
the white pages and the measured rates
option that Pacific Bell offers. Students
now must pay a monthly fee of $1 if they
wish to be listed with Pacific Bell.
Thomson said a measured rate option is
a possibility that the University will con
sider in the future. A measured rate option
allows low-frequency local callers to pay
less than the set flat rate.


Jan Thomson
With the new system, students
need a personal access code in
order to make long-distance calls.
The codes will save roommates
from having to divide the phone
bill each month, since each person
will receive a separate long-dis
tance bill.
Graduate students, especially
those living with spouses and
families, objected strongly in the
spring to the use of codes because
they have no need for separate
bills. A meeting between Escon
dido residents and Communica
tion Services last spring degener
ated into a shouting match, when
students charged that the Univer
sity is not taking their needs into
account.
Communication Services has
since backed down and is giving
graduate students the option of
having long-distance calls billed
directly to their phones.
Undergraduates, however, do
not have this option.
Stanford is now providing

long-distance service to all resi
dents. Students cannot have their
own carriers unless they use call
ing cards, which usually come
with a surcharge.
Thomson said long-distance
rates are subject to fluctuate with
rates set by various vendors.
Stanford uses AT&T, MCI and
U.S. Sprint as a package to get the
best rates, Thomson said.
However, calling plans such as
AT&T's Reach Out America and
MCl's Primetime, which are no
longer available to students, still
offer more competitive rates.
Some students are disap
pointed by the fact that Stanford
does not offer the cheaper Univer
sal Lifeline service of Pacific Bell
for low-income families. Commu
nication Services is offering such
an option only for students who
can prove with old Pacific Bell
bills that they subscribed to the
service before the implementa
tion of the University phone sys
tem.
This provision operates as a
"grandfather" clause that will
have no bearing on incoming stu
dents. Williams said Information
Resources is currently reviewing
the situation and may develop an

altered financial aid package for
needy students instead of reduc
ing their phone bills.
The Stanford phone system
has been implemented so that
ultimately students can have
access to SUNet, Stanford's com
puter network. However, some
older residences like Escondido do
not have facilities compatible
with such a network, and some
students complain they are not
getting the benefits of the switch
over.
Thomson said Manzanita Park
is already on the Stanford net
work, and equipment will be
placed in Escondido beginning in
1991.
"We understand that change is
sometimes difficult for people.
The experience at other schools
made us aware [of that]," Thom
son said.
She said although there were
complaints about the phone sys
tems at Yale University and the
University of Michigan when they
were first implemented, they sub
sided shortly after the change.
All Ivy League colleges cur
rently operate their own phone
systems.

now must pay a monthly fee of $1 if they
wish to be listed with Pacific Bell.
Thomson said a measured rate option is
a possibility that the University will con
sider in the future. A measured rate option
allows low-frequency local callers to pay
less than the set flat rate.

With the new system, students
need a personal access code in
order to make long-distance calls.
The codes will save roommates
from having to divide the phone
bill each month, since each person
will receive a separate long-dis
tance bill.
Graduate students, especially
those living with spouses and
families, objected strongly in the
spring to the use of codes because
they have no need for separate
bills. A meeting between Escon
dido residents and Communica
tion Services last spring degener
ated into a shouting match, when
students charged that the Univer
sity is not taking their needs into
account.
Communication Services has
since backed down and is giving
graduate students the option of
having long-distance calls billed
directly to their phones.
Undergraduates, however, do
not have this option.
Stanford is now providing

long-distance service to all resi
dents. Students cannot have their
own carriers unless they use call
ing cards, which usually come
with a surcharge.
Thomson said long-distance
rates are subject to fluctuate with
rates set by various vendors.
Stanford uses AT&T, MCI and
U.S. Sprint as a package to get the
best rates, Thomson said.
However, calling plans such as
AT&T's Reach Out America and
MCl's Primetime, which are no
longer available to students, still
offer more competitive rates.
Some students are disap
pointed by the fact that Stanford
does not offer the cheaper Univer
sal Lifeline service of Pacific Bell
for low-income families. Commu
nication Services is offering such
an option only for students who
can prove with old Pacific Bell
bills that they subscribed to the
service before the implementa
tion of the University phone sys
tem.
This provision operates as a
"grandfather" clause that will
have no bearing on incoming stu
dents. Williams said Information
Resources is currently reviewing
the situation and may develop an

altered financial aid package for
needy students instead of reduc
ing their phone bills.
The Stanford phone system
has been implemented so that
ultimately students can have
access to SUNet, Stanford's com
puter network. However, some
older residences like Escondido do
not have facilities compatible
with such a network, and some
students complain they are not
getting the benefits of the switch
over.
Thomson said Manzanita Park
is already on the Stanford net
work, and equipment will be
placed in Escondido beginning in
1991.
"We understand that change is
sometimes difficult for people.
The experience at other schools
made us aware [of that]," Thom
son said.
She said although there were
complaints about the phone sys
tems at Yale University and the
University of Michigan when they
were first implemented, they sub
sided shortly after the change.
All Ivy League colleges cur
rently operate their own phone
systems.

Stanford survived some hostile reactions
from graduate students and a hearing at
the California Public Utilities Commission
this summer to become the sole supplier of
telephone service on campus, regulated by
neither the state nor the Federal Communi
cations Commission.
The new student telephone service,
implemented to provide for future data and
video networks, was first proposed to the
Board of Trustees in October 1988. It has
since drawn fire from many students who
fear that Stanford's service will be more
costly and less convenient than Pacific
Bell's.
Jan Thomson, director of Communica
tion Services, said Stanford's phone system
is not operating for a profit. Thomson's
department is responsible for providing the
new services to students.
According to Thomson, Stanford has a
long-term pricing contract with the federal
government that requires the phone service
be operated on a cost-recovery basis. The
contract arose because the government

reimburses Stanford for phone use
incurred in doing government-funded
research.
The agreement, however, applies to the
overall system and not just to researchers'
phone use, Thomson said.
In any given year, gains and losses on the
phone system must be within five percent
of breaking even, Thomson said. If the Uni
versity makes a profit, rates will be
adjusted downward for the following year,
she explained.
As an example, Thomson said residents
of Escondido Village were given "rebates"
in August because they were not charged
for line activation or line service during the
transition period.
In fact, all students who lived in gradu
ate residences during summer quarter
received free local phone service, Thomson
added.
Except for the pricing agreement with
the federal government, Stanford's phone
service is not regulated by any state or fed
eral agency. A June 9 decision in a hearing
before the Public Utilities Commission
ruled that Stanford is neither a public util
ity nor a provider of shared tenant service.
The hearing was initiated by graduate

students Mike Murray, William Behrman
and Gerald LeTendre, who argued that the
new network is a public utility and that
Pacific Bell should continue to serve the
campus because Stanford is in their service
territory.
Stanford, represented by attorney
Jasper Williams, claimed to serve only its
academic users, who do not constitute the
general public. Commercial services located
in Tresidder Union, such as Wells Fargo
Bank and American Express, arc not sub
scribing to the University phone system,
Williams said.
The students also took a second position,
arguing that Stanford is a provider of
shared tenant service and therefore should
allow Pacific Bell to compete for sub
scribers.
Shared tenant guidelines govern situa
tions where tenants contribute to the main
tenance of phone service owned or managed
by the provider in a business or industrial
setting. Because Stanford does not provide
phone service to its commercial tenants,
such as the Stanford Shopping Center and
the Research Park, Williams argued that
the guidelines do not apply.
Representatives from Pacific Bell who

took the stand in the hearing sided with the
students' second position. "Our position
during the hearing was much closer to the
students'. If there's a rehearing and we par
ticipate, we will take approximately the
same position," a Pacific Bell official said.
The students are currently applying for
a rehearing.
Under the new system, Stanford charges
a $36 activation fee and a monthly flat rate
of $11 for local calls within an eight-mile
radius. Students can access service once
they arrive on campus, without having to
wait a few days as was the case with Pacific
Bell.
Although Stanford's rates are
comparable to Pacific Bell's, students lose
the advantage of free directory listing on
the white pages and the measured rates
option that Pacific Bell offers. Students
now must pay a monthly fee of $1 if they
wish to be listed with Pacific Bell.
Thomson said a measured rate option is
a possibility that the University will con
sider in the future. A measured rate option
allows low-frequency local callers to pay
less than the set flat rate.
