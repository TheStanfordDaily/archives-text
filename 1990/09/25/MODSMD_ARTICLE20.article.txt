## Take a stand, discuss and progress

SO THE BAGS ARE UNPACKED,
the posters hung up, the refrigera
tors rented. Some folks are even
anxious to get back to class. At the ASSU,
students and staff are preparing for the
year's ongoing services and business pro
jects, as well as planning some exciting
new programs. As we embark upon the
1990-91 school year, we would like to
share some of our thoughts with you.
The last couple of years have shown us
that as we take on difficult questions —
such as how to bring about multicultural
ism, how to respect individual and group
needs, how to best represent the student
body — there will necessarily emerge
conflicting views.
But occasional controversy is precisely
what is good and right. It is because stu
dents have lobbied for ethnic studies, res
idential education and Ciy for example,
that Stanford has become a "benchmark
of multiculturalism." Everyone who has
engaged in past struggles, regardless of
where in the spectrum of views they fall,
can claim progress as their own.
Over the next year, you will hear much
about the ASSU — good and bad. Please
take interest in — and be critical of —
your student government. Criticism has
been directly responsible for many of the

positive things the ASSU has to offer.
After all, the ASSU is the institution
that brings you Sunday Flicks, Lecture
Notes, Legal Counseling, various speak
ers and entertainment. It offers a bank
ing service for student groups and pro
vides a free marketplace for student con
cerns, ideas and issues. The ASSU is an
institution of both business and politics.
In both business and politics, people
must take a stand in order to progress.
This holds true especially in times of con
troversy. Certainly the ASSU has
encountered its share of controversy in
the past few years, but that is no reason
to discredit the institution.
Remember that we have a vested
interest in the student union. Remember
that the ASSU was initiated and brought
about by and for the students. Remember
that it continues to be run by and for the
students, and it will only be improved by
and for the students.
Already the makings are in place to
make Stanford's student government
superb. In the past few years, we initiated
several new services like Beat the Book
store and Course Consultants, a dorm
representatives program and dorm polls,
and new student groups like the Gradu
ate Concerns Committee and the Com-

It is your responsibility to make the
ASSU what you want it to be. If you have
an idea for a new business project, don't
just tell your friend over dinner, but work
it out with a business-minded peer, and
run it past Torrence Boone, the ASSU
Financial Manager.
Stay abreast, engage in discussion,
run for office and be willing to approach
and work with us. As Goodwin Liu told
the frosh during his welcome speech,
"You are all card-carrying members of
the ASSU." Unlike being a U.S. citizen,
your ultimate responsiblity is not to vote.
At Stanford, that is your primary respon
sibility, and then the real work begins.
