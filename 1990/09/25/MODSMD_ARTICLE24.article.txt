Most people don't know a
whole lot about the savings and
loan crisis. Newspaper reports tell
bits and pieces of the story, saying
that the S&L bailout will cost
Americans hundreds of billions of
dollars. But what does that mean?
What really happened to all of
that money?
If you want to find out, read
"Inside Job: The Looting of Amer
ica's Savings and Loans" by
Stephen Pizzo, Mary Fricker and
Paul Muolo. "Inside Job" gives the
inside story of the savings and
loan debacle. It is a carefully
researched, meticulous account of
how billions of dollars were stolen
from the American people by a
handful of greedy individuals.
It sounds like sensationalism,
but is frighteningly true. The
book's authors — who are jour
nalists — spent three years uncov
ering information and investigat
ing the tragic consequences of the
deregulation of the thrift indus
try.
To encourage motivated busi
nesspeople to purchase thrifts and
help them compete with thriving
investment funds, President Rea
gan signed the Garn-St. Germain
Act of 1982, which deregulated

the savings and loan industry. In
doing so, he "sparked a period of
waste and corruption, excess and
debauchery the likes of which the
nation had not seen since the
roaring twenties."
Reagan's plan to attract moti
vated businesspeople to the thrifts
worked all too well. The deregu
lated industry lured many greedy,
self-interested individuals who
bought savings and loans and
treated them as if they were their
own personal piggy banks.
The new thrift owners used a
variety of schemes to steal billions

of dollars from the coffers of their
businesses and make it seem legal.
Most of the money belonged to
hard-working Americans and all
of that money was insured by the
United States government and it
has to be paid back. That, in short,
is the savings and loans crisis.

Where is all the money? It was
spent on failed development pro
jects, squandered on lavish parties
or hidden away in overseas banks.
What about the people who
took America for a ride? As
"Inside Job" illustrates, many of
them only got away with minor
penalties. By plea bargaining or
muddling the books of their banks
beyond comprehension, many of
these people got off scot-free.
That is the most powerful part
of this book. It is a non-fiction
work that will move you like no
other.
It describes events and names
like a well-written opus of inves
tigative journalism. Then it tells
you how the system doesn't work.
It tells you how crooks who have
stolen hundreds of millions of dol
lars are still roaming the streets
or the corporate board rooms
because the truth is that it's hard
to put a person with hundreds of
millions of dollars behind bars in
this country, no matter what
they've done.
This is a book full of colorful
crooks. But while their stories
may captivate you, each new tale
will add to your growing sense of
anger. By the end of the book, you
may want to try to find these peo
ple and make them pay up — and
you won't be alone. The United
States government has been try
ing to do that with only limited
success itself. And for the next
several years, we're all going to
have to foot the bill.
