"All You Who Sleep Tonight" is a great
source of soothing, serene poetry, a won
derful way to alleviate stress and pres
sure. The verse covers a range of
thoughts and moods, succeeding both in
its frivolity and its tenderness.
Vikram Seth is an Indian who worked
towards a doctorate in the economic
demography of China at Stanford during
the mid 1980's. He is author of "The
Golden Gate: A Novel in Verse," a story
that was brought to life by the sonnets
that it was composed of.
In this, his second collection of poems
(the first being "The Humble Administra
tor's Garden"), and his first publication
since "The Golden Gate" in 1986, he has
once again demonstrated his ability to
reflect upon inner feelings and emotions
with an unrivalled eloquence.
Whereas the Northern Californians in
his technically unique first novel had to
deal with love and the pain that goes
along with it, in this collection Seth goes
beyond what he has previously done,
while drawing on the two most important
influences in his literary background —
that of the Far East, and of America.
For me, the most enjoyable of the five
sections the book is divided into was the
fourth one, "Quatrains." It is a set of
twenty thoughts and muses that are, for
the most part, light and enjoyable. In this,
"Prandial Plaint" stands out for its mis
chievous wit.
My love, I love your breasts. I love your
nose.

The angled sun
Slants honey coloured rays
That lessen to the ground
As we bike through
The corridor of Palm Drive.
— from 'A Style Of Loving'

I love your accent and I love your toes.
1 am your slave. One word, and I will
obey.
But please don't slurp your coffee in that
way.
The second section, "In Other Voices"
is the most thoughtful part of the book.
In these poems, Seth explores the past
and present world through a variety of
perspectives. It is written from the point
of view of individuals who are witnessing
an internal or external transformation
taking place before them. The people Seth
has chosen to empathize with vary widely
in terms of the context and nature of the
experience they are a part of.
There is one poem set in the Indian
subcontinent, and a translation of
another Chinese one. Seth moves'
through various stages of history, incor
porating thoughts from world stages as
far apart as Lithuania and World War II
Germany.
"A Doctor's Journal Entry for August
6, 1945" is narrated by a doctor in
Hiroshima on the day the Americans
dropped the A-bomb. The doctor is wit
ness to huge amounts of suffering, one
that is made all the more inhuman by the
silence of the people around him.

The most powerful poem here is told
by a dying patient in "Soon." Here, the
poet explores the pain of an unwanted
loneliness as he is approaching death, and
the fear of the unknown that lies in the
solitude after his life is over. He is search
ing for something to hold on to, a bond or
relationship that will give him some per
manence in an otherwise transient exis
tence .
"Meditations of the Heart" is the last
section of the book. It is here that Seth

reaffirms his ability to soothe his readers.
The poems are gentle and reassuring,
with a quiet rhythm that seems very nat
ural to them. But there is also a hint of
the disconcerting in them. The last poem
of this section, and the book, gives the col
lection its title. It is characteristic of the
msyority of Seth's work, dealing with love
and the anguish of loneliness. He has an
uncanny ability to turn a phrase and
make his readers think about what he is
saying.

All you who sleep tonight
Far from the ones you love,
No hand to left or right,
. And emptiness above-
Know that you aren't alone.
The whole world shares your tears,
Some for two nights or one,
And some for all their years.
