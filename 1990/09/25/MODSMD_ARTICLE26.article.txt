## Volleyball looks for upset against UOP tonight 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
The preseason pollsters have called it to
perfection, so far.
Stanford, slated as the sixth-best
women's volleyball team in the country in
early polls, has fulfilled expectations and
remains in the No. 6 slot today.
The Cardinal, however, can thoroughly
rearrange the higher rankings if it can han
dle the University of the Pacific Tigers
tonight at 7:30 p.m. Pacific, ranked third in
last week's Tachikara Coaches' Poll,
recently prevailed at the Illinois Invita
tional, defeating No.l Nebraska and No. 7
Illinois in the process. Should the Tigers
continue to win, the team can potentially
seize the nation's top ranking from
Nebraska. Stanford (6-1, 3-1 in Pacific 10
Conference play) stands solidly in the way.
Despite sub-standard play in dropping a
match to UCLA Saturday, Stanford is pre
pared for Pacific and their scores of orange
clad alumni who will pour into Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:30. "We're going to be
angry about losing to UCLA," middle
blocker Amy Cooper said. "But we're not
going to let that hold us back or make us
depressed. As long as we're playing the way
we can, I think we're the best team in the
country"
UOP may have first claim to that honor,
however. The Tigers have downed two top
seven squads this week without the services
of their finest player. First-team Ail-Ameri
can Krissy Fifer, hitting .404 this season,
has been absent in both of Pacific's recent
victories. The Tigers nevertheless possess a
tremendous block and another offensive
option in Cathey Scotlan, the MVP of the
Illinois Invitiational.
"UOP gives us another chance to mea
sure where we are," Stanford coach Don
Shaw said.
Because Pacific plays in the Big West
Conference, the match is irrelevant to Pac

10 standings. The contest, nevertheless,
will still enable the team to boost its rank
ing as well as its morale.
Instrumental to the Stanford attack will
be hitter-blocker Bev Oden. The Irvine,
Calif., sophomore was named Pac-10 Player
of the Week for the second time in three
weeks. The first-team Ail-American offered
a career night against UCLA, hitting an
unconscious .454 with 29 kills in only four
games. On the season, Oden is hitting .338
and leads the team in kills with 127. She is
second in digs with 92 and is quantum leaps
ahead of her teammates in blocks with 41.
Middle blocking counterpart Cooper
promises to perturb the Pacific blockers
tonight as well. Continuing her resurgent
season, Cooper has consistently been at the
top of the Pac-10 in hitting percentage and
ranks 10th nationally in the category today.
Cooper is the third-leading blocker on the
squad and has established herself as a pow
erful Cardinal threat.
Pacific cannot, however, afford to neglect
the outside attack. Ail-American Kristin
Klein is punishing the hardwood as well as
would-be diggers with bursts of uncontrol
lable power. Klein is hitting .332 on the year
and has 125 kills. She remains a defensive
phenom having collected 100 digs this sea
son.
The key against Pacific remains the Car
dinal's passing. "If we pass the ball well, if
we sideout consistently, we can be the best
team in the country," Shaw said. To estab
lish effective ball control, Shaw has utilized
back row specialists Kathy Jurgens and
senior Tracy Hughes. Jurgens, a redshirt
freshman, has seized a prominent role on
the team with relentless, consistent defen
sive play. Hughes continues many of the
duties she held last season and remains a
steady influence.
The Cardinal may be handicapped by the
continued absence of starting left-side hit-

Saturday night Bev Oderi had the best match of her career, tallying 29 kills and 22 digs while hitting .454. Despite her
exploits, which earned her Pac-10 Player-of-the-Week honors, Stanford suffered its first loss of the season to the No. 2
Bruins.
ter Kristi Paaso. An excellent
passer, superb defensive player,
and intelligent hitter, Paaso has
been sidelined with a nagging
back injury. Her practice has been
limited to select drills as she
remains incapable of playing.
"Hopefully, Kristi will be back
with us real soon," Shaw said.
Tonight's match is the culmi
nation of Stanford's first and
most challenging homestand of
the year. This weekend, the Car
dined will travel to Arizona to play
No. 16 Arizona and Arizona
State.
The Cardinal then hosts Wash
ington State and Washington the
following weekend.
