# New isn't always better in the world of Card sports
## 
### 
Ah, fall. Time again to sign up for
classes you'll end up dropping, time again
to buy books you won't read for at least
20 years, time to go to tailgaters that last
until, say, the middle of the third quarter,
time for half the freshman class to go
gaga over the volleyball team's new setter.
.. and, needless to say, time to shell out 92
bucks for an all-sports pass that gives the
owner the privilege of watching Stanford
sports.
Hold up, you say How much?
Ninety-two smackers, pal. C'mon, it's
cheap! Football tickets alone are 32 dol
lars and basketball tix will set you back
30, so what's another 30 dollars between
friends? Basically, all you have to do to
cover the cost of the pass is go to 15 of the
so-called "minor" sports' home games
over the course of the year.
If you think about it, that's a heck of a

deal: Considering that students now have
to pay to get into absolutely every sports
event on campus, from water polo to vol
leyball to tag-team underwater rhythmic
gymnastics, it could be much, much
worse.
How much worse? Let's see . . . two
bucks for every home sports event this
season . . . plus men's and women's hoops
... plus football . . . plus Big Game ...
carry the two ... divide by pi.. . and you
end up with the mega-fan's ticket bill of
approximately, oh, 4,632 dollars. Give or
take. (All right, so that's not even close.
You try to find every team's 1990-91
schedule and add it up.)
Speaking of ridiculous sums of money,
was anyone else annoyed that the Athletic
Department sent ticket order forms with
our University bills? I'm no public rela
tions genius (ask my friends), but I do

know that anytime I receive a bill for sev
eral thousand dollars I'm not exactly anx
ious to get hit up for a hundred more. All
that was missing was a little sign than
said "Stanford University: $20,000 cover
charge. Sports not included."
Given, then, that buying individual
tickets would set you back the price of a
good-sized home in Pittsburgh, that pass
looks kinda sweet. There are, of course,

other ways of looking at *.ie situation.
Take, for example, the fact that a scant
three years ago ALL THIS WAS FREE!!!!!
I LIKED spending my Saturday morn
ings checking out the soccer and water
polo games, not having to worry about
paying to catch a few minutes of the
action.
This should do wonders for student
attendance at water polo games, gymnas
tics meets and soccer matches. The hard
core fans will be there, but other than
that, who knows?
Personally, I don't have much of a
problem with the pass, as long as stu
dents keep showing up at events. The
question is, how many of us will?
• • •
Of course, the admission charges
(along with the shifting of the Equally
Attractive Non-Alcoholic student football

seats to somewhere south of San Jose)
don't even come close to being the biggest
change on the Stanford sports scene.
No, that honor goes to Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger's decision to leave after
over 11 years here in order to take the
AD's job at Maryland, a.k.a. Probation U.
(If you ask me, that's somewhat akin to
moving from Malibu to Toledo, but hey,
it's his life.) Geiger leaves behind the best
damn collegiate athletic program in the
world, and the credit for that goes in large
part to him. More NCAA team titles in
the '80s than any other school. More indi
vidual NCAA titles than anyone else. Zero
NCAA rules infractions.
The potential for the success of the
'80's was here before Geiger arrived, but
he was the one who expanded the scope of


Cameron
Macky
the program, raised the support
and brought in coaches Tara Van-
Derveer, Richard Quick, Berhane
Andeberhan and Mike Mont
gomery. Geiger's commitment to
the non-glamour sports also gave
Stanford more varsity teams than
any other school west of the Mis
sissippi.
Geiger helped make Stanford a
model of integrity as well as the
envy of the collegiate sports
world, and the Athletic Depart
ment is much the worse without
him.

Now that he's gone, however,
we've got some work to do to find
a replacement. Alan Cummings,
the acting AD, says he doesn't
want the job. Neither do I. Just
about everyone else does, includ
ing several associate ADs, former
Stanford players, Daily sports edi
tors, administrators, showgirls,
etc.
The question, though, is Why?
I mean, how many people would
answer a help wanted ad that
went something like this:
IMMEDIATE OPENING
Director, Stanford Athletics.
Must take over a program that
can't get much better but may get
worse if tuition increases continue
to send scholarship costs to the

moon. Must be able to handle stu
dents mad about lousy football
seats and having to pay to watch
fencing. Must be able to put up
with angry alumni complaining
about The Band. Must be able to
put up with students complaining
about alumni. Must be able to put
up with alumni who couldn't care
less about anything except foot
ball and who don't understand
that it's kind of hard to win a lot
of games when you play bowl
teams every other week. Must be
intolerant of cheating. Must be
able to ask for money constantly
from annoying people.
Must have one hell of a sense of
humor. Need references. Call
Stanford Athletics for interview.

No thanks.
I'm sure that there are quite a
few people anxious to take over,
however, including The Daily's
own Chris Crader ("You can't
spell 'Crader' without 'AD'! "
Well, maybe it'll catch on.) Unfor
tunately for all the candidates,
I've already come up with the per
fect replacement. I thought about
campaigning for Jimmy Buffett,
part owner of the Class A Miami
Miracle, but I think he's on tour.
Besides, my candidate would be
great for the job.
He's got the time. He's got the
energy. He's got the passion for
excellence, the love of sports and a
nose for fundraising.
S.F. 49er owner Eddie Deßar
tolo, Jr.

No, really.
Actually, I'm surprised no
one's thought of this already,
because it's fairly obvious. What
were the two biggest criticisms of
Geiger's tenure? Simple: (A) The
football team didn't win enough;
and (B) the huge budget deficit
caused some smaller sports to get
axed (and led to the admission
charges). Coincidentally, a certain
football coach left Stanford just
before Geiger arrived, and the
football team hasn't been the
same since. A mediocre football
record leads to mediocre alumni
support leads to budget deficits
leads to bye-bye wrestling, sailing,
field hockey and track.
The coach's name was Bill
Walsh. Who stole him from Stan

ford? Deßartolo. He owes us. He
knows how to run a business. He
knows how to hire good people.
And hey — even if we still ended
up with a deficit one year, I'm
pretty sure Eddie could find some
extra cash lying around some
where. Is there a rule against ADs
contributing large sums of money
to their own programs?
I hope not. Hey Eddie! Think
about it.

Cameron Macky is The Daily's
men'B basketball writer. He was
going to write about the Pirates
and their three-game lead, but
he's still not entirely sure they're
not going to choke.

men'B basketball writer. He was
going to write about the Pirates
and their three-game lead, but
he's still not entirely sure they're
not going to choke.
Ah, fall. Time again to sign up for
classes you'll end up dropping, time again
to buy books you won't read for at least
20 years, time to go to tailgaters that last
until, say, the middle of the third quarter,
time for half the freshman class to go
gaga over the volleyball team's new setter.
.. and, needless to say, time to shell out 92
bucks for an all-sports pass that gives the
owner the privilege of watching Stanford
sports.
Hold up, you say How much?
Ninety-two smackers, pal. C'mon, it's
cheap! Football tickets alone are 32 dol
lars and basketball tix will set you back
30, so what's another 30 dollars between
friends? Basically, all you have to do to
cover the cost of the pass is go to 15 of the
so-called "minor" sports' home games
over the course of the year.
If you think about it, that's a heck of a

deal: Considering that students now have
to pay to get into absolutely every sports
event on campus, from water polo to vol
leyball to tag-team underwater rhythmic
gymnastics, it could be much, much
worse.
How much worse? Let's see . . . two
bucks for every home sports event this
season . . . plus men's and women's hoops
... plus football . . . plus Big Game ...
carry the two ... divide by pi.. . and you
end up with the mega-fan's ticket bill of
approximately, oh, 4,632 dollars. Give or
take. (All right, so that's not even close.
You try to find every team's 1990-91
schedule and add it up.)
Speaking of ridiculous sums of money,
was anyone else annoyed that the Athletic
Department sent ticket order forms with
our University bills? I'm no public rela
tions genius (ask my friends), but I do

know that anytime I receive a bill for sev
eral thousand dollars I'm not exactly anx
ious to get hit up for a hundred more. All
that was missing was a little sign than
said "Stanford University: $20,000 cover
charge. Sports not included."
Given, then, that buying individual
tickets would set you back the price of a
good-sized home in Pittsburgh, that pass
looks kinda sweet. There are, of course,

other ways of looking at *.ie situation.
Take, for example, the fact that a scant
three years ago ALL THIS WAS FREE!!!!!
I LIKED spending my Saturday morn
ings checking out the soccer and water
polo games, not having to worry about
paying to catch a few minutes of the
action.
This should do wonders for student
attendance at water polo games, gymnas
tics meets and soccer matches. The hard
core fans will be there, but other than
that, who knows?
Personally, I don't have much of a
problem with the pass, as long as stu
dents keep showing up at events. The
question is, how many of us will?

Of course, the admission charges
(along with the shifting of the Equally
Attractive Non-Alcoholic student football

seats to somewhere south of San Jose)
don't even come close to being the biggest
change on the Stanford sports scene.
No, that honor goes to Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger's decision to leave after
over 11 years here in order to take the
AD's job at Maryland, a.k.a. Probation U.
(If you ask me, that's somewhat akin to
moving from Malibu to Toledo, but hey,
it's his life.) Geiger leaves behind the best
damn collegiate athletic program in the
world, and the credit for that goes in large
part to him. More NCAA team titles in
the '80s than any other school. More indi
vidual NCAA titles than anyone else. Zero
NCAA rules infractions.
The potential for the success of the
'80's was here before Geiger arrived, but
he was the one who expanded the scope of


Cameron
Macky
the program, raised the support
and brought in coaches Tara Van-
Derveer, Richard Quick, Berhane
Andeberhan and Mike Mont
gomery. Geiger's commitment to
the non-glamour sports also gave
Stanford more varsity teams than
any other school west of the Mis
sissippi.
Geiger helped make Stanford a
model of integrity as well as the
envy of the collegiate sports
world, and the Athletic Depart
ment is much the worse without
him.

Now that he's gone, however,
we've got some work to do to find
a replacement. Alan Cummings,
the acting AD, says he doesn't
want the job. Neither do I. Just
about everyone else does, includ
ing several associate ADs, former
Stanford players, Daily sports edi
tors, administrators, showgirls,
etc.
The question, though, is Why?
I mean, how many people would
answer a help wanted ad that
went something like this:
IMMEDIATE OPENING
Director, Stanford Athletics.
Must take over a program that
can't get much better but may get
worse if tuition increases continue
to send scholarship costs to the

moon. Must be able to handle stu
dents mad about lousy football
seats and having to pay to watch
fencing. Must be able to put up
with angry alumni complaining
about The Band. Must be able to
put up with students complaining
about alumni. Must be able to put
up with alumni who couldn't care
less about anything except foot
ball and who don't understand
that it's kind of hard to win a lot
of games when you play bowl
teams every other week. Must be
intolerant of cheating. Must be
able to ask for money constantly
from annoying people.
Must have one hell of a sense of
humor. Need references. Call
Stanford Athletics for interview.

No thanks.
I'm sure that there are quite a
few people anxious to take over,
however, including The Daily's
own Chris Crader ("You can't
spell 'Crader' without 'AD'! "
Well, maybe it'll catch on.) Unfor
tunately for all the candidates,
I've already come up with the per
fect replacement. I thought about
campaigning for Jimmy Buffett,
part owner of the Class A Miami
Miracle, but I think he's on tour.
Besides, my candidate would be
great for the job.
He's got the time. He's got the
energy. He's got the passion for
excellence, the love of sports and a
nose for fundraising.
S.F. 49er owner Eddie Deßar
tolo, Jr.

No, really.
Actually, I'm surprised no
one's thought of this already,
because it's fairly obvious. What
were the two biggest criticisms of
Geiger's tenure? Simple: (A) The
football team didn't win enough;
and (B) the huge budget deficit
caused some smaller sports to get
axed (and led to the admission
charges). Coincidentally, a certain
football coach left Stanford just
before Geiger arrived, and the
football team hasn't been the
same since. A mediocre football
record leads to mediocre alumni
support leads to budget deficits
leads to bye-bye wrestling, sailing,
field hockey and track.
The coach's name was Bill
Walsh. Who stole him from Stan

ford? Deßartolo. He owes us. He
knows how to run a business. He
knows how to hire good people.
And hey — even if we still ended
up with a deficit one year, I'm
pretty sure Eddie could find some
extra cash lying around some
where. Is there a rule against ADs
contributing large sums of money
to their own programs?
I hope not. Hey Eddie! Think
about it.
