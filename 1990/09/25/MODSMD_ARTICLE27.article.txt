# New isn't always better in the world of Card sports

Ah, fall. Time again to sign up for
classes you'll end up dropping, time again
to buy books you won't read for at least
20 years, time to go to tailgaters that last
until, say, the middle of the third quarter,
time for half the freshman class to go
gaga over the volleyball team's new setter.
.. and, needless to say, time to shell out 92
bucks for an all-sports pass that gives the
owner the privilege of watching Stanford
sports.
Hold up, you say How much?
Ninety-two smackers, pal. C'mon, it's
cheap! Football tickets alone are 32 dol
lars and basketball tix will set you back
30, so what's another 30 dollars between
friends? Basically, all you have to do to
cover the cost of the pass is go to 15 of the
so-called "minor" sports' home games
over the course of the year.
If you think about it, that's a heck of a

deal: Considering that students now have
to pay to get into absolutely every sports
event on campus, from water polo to vol
leyball to tag-team underwater rhythmic
gymnastics, it could be much, much
worse.
How much worse? Let's see . . . two
bucks for every home sports event this
season . . . plus men's and women's hoops
... plus football . . . plus Big Game ...
carry the two ... divide by pi.. . and you
end up with the mega-fan's ticket bill of
approximately, oh, 4,632 dollars. Give or
take. (All right, so that's not even close.
You try to find every team's 1990-91
schedule and add it up.)
Speaking of ridiculous sums of money,
was anyone else annoyed that the Athletic
Department sent ticket order forms with
our University bills? I'm no public rela
tions genius (ask my friends), but I do

know that anytime I receive a bill for sev
eral thousand dollars I'm not exactly anx
ious to get hit up for a hundred more. All
that was missing was a little sign than
said "Stanford University: $20,000 cover
charge. Sports not included."
Given, then, that buying individual
tickets would set you back the price of a
good-sized home in Pittsburgh, that pass
looks kinda sweet. There are, of course,

other ways of looking at *.ie situation.
Take, for example, the fact that a scant
three years ago ALL THIS WAS FREE!!!!!
I LIKED spending my Saturday morn
ings checking out the soccer and water
polo games, not having to worry about
paying to catch a few minutes of the
action.
This should do wonders for student
attendance at water polo games, gymnas
tics meets and soccer matches. The hard
core fans will be there, but other than
that, who knows?
Personally, I don't have much of a
problem with the pass, as long as stu
dents keep showing up at events. The
question is, how many of us will?

Of course, the admission charges
(along with the shifting of the Equally
Attractive Non-Alcoholic student football

seats to somewhere south of San Jose)
don't even come close to being the biggest
change on the Stanford sports scene.
No, that honor goes to Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger's decision to leave after
over 11 years here in order to take the
AD's job at Maryland, a.k.a. Probation U.
(If you ask me, that's somewhat akin to
moving from Malibu to Toledo, but hey,
it's his life.) Geiger leaves behind the best
damn collegiate athletic program in the
world, and the credit for that goes in large
part to him. More NCAA team titles in
the '80s than any other school. More indi
vidual NCAA titles than anyone else. Zero
NCAA rules infractions.
The potential for the success of the
'80's was here before Geiger arrived, but
he was the one who expanded the scope of
