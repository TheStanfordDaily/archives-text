Dear Sports Observer:
Welcome to the 1990-91 ver
sion of the Cardinal Sports
Juggernaut! As a four-year vet
eran, I have been waiting impa
tiently all summer to add to the
14 national championships
earned in my undergraduate
years. But if this weekend was
any indication of the year to
come, I don't care if the mighty
Cardinal can bring home the
bacon or not.
Let me explain. I expected
several changes in Stanford
athletics over the summer;
Andy Geiger had left and alco
hol was to be prohibited at all
stadiums for the first time.
Fine. No big deal. But I did not
know that someone apparently
prohibited fun at sporting
events as well. I don't know
who did or how they did it, but
sometime over the summer it
happened. And when I realized
this at Saturday's volleyball
match, I suddenly did not care
whether I was there or not.
What exactly am I talking
about? Well, I saw a lot of peo
ple this weekend, but few true
fans. You know — "fan" —
short for "fanatic," a wild and
crazy student screaming for
the home team. They have
them at Duke and Florida
State, and probably even at
California. But Saturday night
in Maples in game four of the
volleyball match, a half dozen
UCLA fans out-cheered the
entire Stanford crowd. Down 2-
1 in games, the Cardinal gave
up a couple of points and sud
denly there wasn't a single
rowdy rag twirling in sight.
Our athletes work hard and
deserve our support because
there is no home field advan
tage without fans. I cannot
believe that so many students
payed two dollars to get into
the game just to sit still for
over two hours. Why didn't you

just stay home and watch on
TV? At least that's free.
Instead of just observing,
paying fans should get their
money's worth. That means
yelling, screaming, enjoying
yourself, and even being a bit
obnoxious. Heckle the other
team now and then. Really. It's
OK. It doesn't even violate the
Fundamental Standard since
we do it to non-Stanford stu
dents. Stand up and pound the
bleachers at volleyball games.
Constantly. Not just on game
point, but any time the team
needs a point or a sideout. If
you don't like the cheerleaders'
cheers, make up your own.
Just do something.
I was especially disap
pointed with the frosh. That
was your school spirit at the
football game? Give me a
break! A couple of painted
faces, newspaper hats, and
first-quarter cheers? Donner
was the only dorm you could
hear above the ice cream guy.
Does Branner exist? Was Lag
taking placement tests? Was
Flo Mo at Meyer reading ahead
for Western Culture? How
about the frosh RA's? Were you
too busy making door decora
tions to come up with some
cheers? Signs? Costumes,
noisemakers, or anything at
all? We needed more cone
heads, more merciless diehards
demanding a touchdown at 31-
0 for insurance in covering the
spread. Even in a blowout, we
needed more people having
fun. The Department of Athlet
ics moved the student section
so we could stand, so why did
all the frosh decide to sit? And
at volleyball you were still the
class of ninety-bore. Can't
someone besides Okada come
up with a banner or cheer for
someone in the dorm?
I get this sinking feeling
