Getting the season off on the right foot, Stanford
athletes won both the men's and women's races at a
cross country meet last Friday at Ohio State. The
men took the team title at the Scarlet and Gray Invi
tational, while the women took fifth place at the con
currently-run Lady Buckeye Invitational.
Cardinal men finished in first, second, third and
fourth places as the team beat out Michigan State,
Bowling Green, and the host Buckeyes. The Cardinal
gathered only 21 points, while the Spartans had 47
for a distant second, Bowling Green took third with
63, and the hosts staggered away with 108 points.
Junior Fred Carter won the collegiate title by cov
ering 8,000 meters in 24:59 at the Ohio State Golf
Course. Senior Jason Martin placed second, sopho
more Gary Stoltz took third and junior Dave Scud
amore placed fourth to complete the Stanford sweep.
Carter, a second-year varsity runner, attributed
his win to "working hard and training hard" this
summer and early fall. He was pleased with the win,
especially since it had come at an away meet and was
his first collegiate title in cross country.
The success at the Invitational, in fact, provides
great motivation for all of the team, Carter said.
With mental preparation to equal the physical prepa
ration already completed, "The sky's the limit,"
Carter said.
In the Lady Buckeye Invitational, also at the Ohio
State Golf Course, sophomore Ashley Black ran
5,000 meters in 18:17, 14 seconds faster than her
nearest competitor. Classmate Jill Shenkel added a
seventh-place finish.
Michigan State won the overall title with 53
points, edging Bowling Green by a point. Ashland
was third at 72, Ohio State was fourth at 93, and the
Cardinal had 96 points for fifth, and Toledo finished
sixth at 155.
The meet gave the women's cross country team a
starting block for a building season. The young team,
composed mainly of freshmen with two sophomores
and two upperclassmen, has the ability, according to
Shenkel, and now is working "one step at a time with
a positive mindset."
Stanford returns to action a week from Saturday
in the Stanford/Holiday Inn Invitational. The meet
begins at 2 p.m. at the Stanford Golf Course. The
Invitational is a key meet for the Cardinal, and both
the men's and women's teams feel confident and pre
pared.

the team to fare well. Shenkel
elaborated, adding that the weeks
of practices between the meets
boosted confidences and should
have the team reaping the
rewards at home in a week.
The outlook for the whole sea
son is bright for both the men's
and women's teams. Both Carter
and Shenkel expressed hope of
success at the NCAA Champi
onships at season's end. "Win
ning nationals would be the ulti
mate goal," said Shenkel.
Carter was equally hopeful for
nationals where he feels the
men's team will have a chance to
surprise the competition.
His advice to the competition:
"Watch out for the Card."
