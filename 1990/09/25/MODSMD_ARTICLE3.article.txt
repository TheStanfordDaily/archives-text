### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
The nearly $11 million project to con
struct Kimball Hall by the fall of 1991 is
on budget and has been on schedule
since it began in the middle of July,
according to Asst. Provost John Hughes.
The four-class, 200-bed dormitory
will replace several trailers in Manzanita
Park, a "temporary" residence built over
20 years ago.
Kimball, which will have three sto
ries and an "H" shape, will be architec
turally similar to Branner Hall and
Toyon Hall. It will be comprised of about
18 percent singles, 20 to 25 percent one
room doubles, 48 percent two-room dou
bles and four three-room quads. The
dining facility will be built 50 to 60 feet
away from the dorm.

The new dorm is funded by donations
from members of the Board of Trustees.
As project manager, Olivier Pieron
orchestrated the plans, which call for
the completion of the project by the end
of August 1991.
Pieron also designed and planned a
project that will replace 40 of the 95
remaining Manzanita trailers with two
new residences, presently unnamed, to
open in the fall of 1992. Each will house
100 students and will help achieve the
University's goal of four years of guar
anteed undergraduate housing for all
students.
Although new residences are
planned, earthquake-damaged buildings
will not be neglected. University-wide
budget repositioning has made funds
