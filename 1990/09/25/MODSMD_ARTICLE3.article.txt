# Kimball to open on time
## 
### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
The nearly $11 million project to con
struct Kimball Hall by the fall of 1991 is
on budget and has been on schedule
since it began in the middle of July,
according to Asst. Provost John Hughes.
The four-class, 200-bed dormitory
will replace several trailers in Manzanita
Park, a "temporary" residence built over
20 years ago.
Kimball, which will have three sto
ries and an "H" shape, will be architec
turally similar to Branner Hall and
Toyon Hall. It will be comprised of about
18 percent singles, 20 to 25 percent one
room doubles, 48 percent two-room dou
bles and four three-room quads. The
dining facility will be built 50 to 60 feet
away from the dorm.

The new dorm is funded by donations
from members of the Board of Trustees.
As project manager, Olivier Pieron
orchestrated the plans, which call for
the completion of the project by the end
of August 1991.
Pieron also designed and planned a
project that will replace 40 of the 95
remaining Manzanita trailers with two
new residences, presently unnamed, to
open in the fall of 1992. Each will house
100 students and will help achieve the
University's goal of four years of guar
anteed undergraduate housing for all
students.
Although new residences are
planned, earthquake-damaged buildings
will not be neglected. University-wide
budget repositioning has made funds
available that will go toward con
struction.
Although Kimball and the two
adjacent residences may ensure
four guaranteed years of housing,
several students have found the
construction of these residences
disruptive.
"It is not unusual that some
students have complained,"
Pieron said. "But the workers are

starting at 7:30 in the morning,
which is late for construction
workers."
Freshman Christina Tusan
lives on the side of Branner that
faces the site. "We have heard
some noise. It has not gotten
really bad, but I have a feeling
that as they lay more foundation
it will become pretty annoying,"
she said.
"We have to shut our windows
because of the noise and dirt,"
Tusan added. "Since the con
struction is right by our bath
room on the first floor, anyone

can just walk by."
Sophomore Tammy Watts, a
Toyon resident, has also been dis
turbed by the construction. "I
heard something at 7:30 in the
morning. It sounded like a jack
hammer was right outside my
window. I searched through my
boxes and found my ear plugs."
New pathways are also being
built to connect Manzanita and
Toyon to Serra Street. The con
struction work has inconve
nienced students who must travel
circuitously to and from their
trailers.
