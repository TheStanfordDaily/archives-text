# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With classes on the verge of starting, stu
dents reappearing from all over, and sum
mertime fading to a memory, affairs on the
Farm have been returning to something
resembling normalcy.
Last Saturday, however, two Southern
California sophomores turned in perfor

mances that were anything but normal.
Based on those performances, in addition to
earlier efforts, Glyn Milburn and Julie
Foudy have been dubbed The Daily's first
Athletes of the Week for the nascent school
year.
Foudy, a 5-foot-6 midfielder from Laguna
Niguel, Calif., has led the Cardinal soccer
team to a 7-1 record and a No. 11 national
ranking. In Saturday's game against Har
vard she scored two goals as the Cardinal
blanked the Crimson 4-0.
Her first tally came on a lofted pass from
freshman Glynnis Roberts which Foudy per
functorily headed into the net. The second
goal followed an assist from Heather Mcln
tyre, as Foudy threaded her way between
two defenders and fired past the goalie for
the keeper. She thereby increased her season
total to seven goals, lifting her just past
Sarah Rafanelli as Stanford's leading scorer.

Milburn, a 5-9 tailback from Santa Mon
ica, Calif., led a Cardinal ground game to
heights fans around here haven't seen in
some time. And, more importantly, Milburn
helped the Cardinal to a 37-3 win over Ore
gon State Saturday, moving the Cardinal to
1-2 overall, 1-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
If there was any question as to the Cardi
nal's ability to bounce back from consecutive
heart-rending losses, it was dispelled in a
hurry Saturday at Stanford Stadium. The
Cardinal marched for scores the first five
times it had the ball to take a 31-0 lead into

the locker room at the half.
At the half, Milburn had already danced,
pranced and just flat-out flown to 105 yards
rushing. He finished with 113 yards on the
ground, a couple of catches and the best seat
in the house after he and the rest of the
starters were pulled in the third quarter.
