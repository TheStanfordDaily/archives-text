### Roberta Woolley 
In an attempt to both save money and allow stu
dents and faculty easier access to information, the
Faculty and Staff Directory is in the process of merg
ing with the Stanford Student Directory. For the first
time, the Student Directory staff will create a consol
idated resource guide.
According to University personnel manager Phil
Curry, the University will save at least $10,000
because two different staffs are no longer needed to
produce two books. Instead, one book will be pro
duced by students, eliminating costs to the Office of
Human Resources Services.
The new combined directory will appear this year
on an experimental basis. Faculty and student
response will determine whether the project will con
tinue next year, according to Damian Marhefka, Stu
dent Directory director.
In addition to saving money, the Directory staff

will save time in printing and distributing the book
this year because of equipment changes. The com
bined issue will be available Oct. 31, two to three
weeks earlier than the distribution date in previous
years.
The Student Directory is financed through adver
tising profits. With an average budget of $285,000,
the Directory usually makes about $75,000 in prof
its, according to Marhefka.
The extra money is channeled into the student
activity fund for insurance or athletic equipment,
according to Program and Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Ramsey-Perez. Ramsey-Perez said he
expects greater profits next year because of the
merger.
Curry said one reason for combining the directo
ries was budget cuts in Human Resources which pro
hibit publications. "Also, the enthusiasm of [the Stu
dent Directory directors] has helped instigate this
change," Curry said.
