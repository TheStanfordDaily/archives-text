## 
### Miranda Doyle 
About $300 was stolen from a floor
safe in the Christine Ricker Dining Cen
ter sometime in the last three weeks,
according to Keith Guy, director of
Housing and Food Services.
Between Aug. 22, when the Sterling
Quad dining hall closed, and last Friday,
when it re-opened, $298 was taken from
a safe in the kitchen's office.
Because there was no sign of a break
in, Guy said he believes the thief proba
bly had a key. The locks will be changed
in the dining center to prevent future
problems, he said.
"We will also re-examine our policy of
who has keys," Guy said.
He would not speculate as to the
thief's identity.
Susan Peletta, manager of food ser
vices for Sterling Quad, said employees
will get new keys after the locks are
changed. She said she believes the thief

Last year there were
more than 600 reports of
petty theft and almost 250
incidents of grand theft.

may have been familiar with the layout
of the dining center.
When Peletta reported the theft yes
terday afternoon, "the police did not
sound hopeful" about the possible suc
cess of an investigation, she said. With
no signs of break-in and no idea when
the money was taken, it is unlikely that
any suspects will be found.
According to Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, problems caused by unautho
rized people possessing keys are com
mon on campus. "Key control has
always been a problem," he said. "There
are so many keys and no controls on

who has them."
Niemeyer said he did not know of
other dining halls that have lost money
recently, but said many other things on
campus are stolen. "Even in the sum
mertime, it does not slow up," he said.
Computers, bicycles and wallets are the
most common items that are reported
missing.
According to Niemeyer, the main
problem is thefts that occur when win
dows and doors have been propped open
or when residents open doors for people
who do not have keys. Last year, there
were more than 600 reports of petty
theft and almost 250 reported incidents
of grand theft or stolen computers.
About 400 burglaries were reported
to the police last year, including thefts
from open cars, the most prevalent type
of burglary, and burglary of dormitory
rooms, the second-most-common type.
About 400 bicycles were also reported
stolen.
