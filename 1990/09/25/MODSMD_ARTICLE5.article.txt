# Panel evaluates UCMI progress:
## More talk than action 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Much has been said and little
has been done to create and unify
a culturally diverse community,
according to the 1990 Annual
Review Panel of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
which released its report this
month.
Although the panel praised
University officials for their
attempts to address issues of cul
tural diversity, the conclusion was
that University officials give
"insufficient or inconsistent
attention to the issues."
The 16-member review panel
included faculty members, stu
dents, staff, alumni and external
experts on minority group con
cerns and education. The commit
tee examined Stanford's progress
on fulfilling the recommendations
of the March 1989 UCMI report.
Based on three opinion surveys

and personal interviews, the
UCMI report found that feelings
of persona) and professional satis
faction among minority students,
faculty and staff were lower than
those of their white counterparts
at the University.
The study produced 130 recom
mendations to help make people
of color feel better about their
roles in the Stanford community
and alleviate persistent allega
tions of mistreatment of students
of color. These recommendations
were the result of an 18-month
examination of the situation.
According to Cecilia Burciaga,
1989-90 acting affirmative action
officer, the findings of the UCMI
review panel "went to the core of
the issues . . . [and] signal that we
have a lot of work to do."
One review panel finding was
that "very few of the faculty teach
courses with a multicultural per
spective as compared with those
who teach conventional material."

A proposal to revise distribu
tion requirements so that more
attention would be given to cul
ture and gender issues was dis
cussed last spring in the Faculty
Senate, according to Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow.
"This issue will be taken up in
the fall," Wasow told The Daily.
He added that he thinks it is
"much more important to change
curriculum than distribution
requirements."
The panel also recommended
that "senior administrative offi
cers and faculty of the institution
ought to be able to participate in
personal growth programs and
skill-building activities on multi
cultural issues."
The issues must be internal
ized, because they are "issues of
the heart," Burciaga said. And
