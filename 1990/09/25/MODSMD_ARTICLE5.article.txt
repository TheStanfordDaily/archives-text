# Panel evaluates UCMI progress:
## More talk than action 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Much has been said and little
has been done to create and unify
a culturally diverse community,
according to the 1990 Annual
Review Panel of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
which released its report this
month.
Although the panel praised
University officials for their
attempts to address issues of cul
tural diversity, the conclusion was
that University officials give
"insufficient or inconsistent
attention to the issues."
The 16-member review panel
included faculty members, stu
dents, staff, alumni and external
experts on minority group con
cerns and education. The commit
tee examined Stanford's progress
on fulfilling the recommendations
of the March 1989 UCMI report.
Based on three opinion surveys

and personal interviews, the
UCMI report found that feelings
of persona) and professional satis
faction among minority students,
faculty and staff were lower than
those of their white counterparts
at the University.
The study produced 130 recom
mendations to help make people
of color feel better about their
roles in the Stanford community
and alleviate persistent allega
tions of mistreatment of students
of color. These recommendations
were the result of an 18-month
examination of the situation.
According to Cecilia Burciaga,
1989-90 acting affirmative action
officer, the findings of the UCMI
review panel "went to the core of
the issues . . . [and] signal that we
have a lot of work to do."
One review panel finding was
that "very few of the faculty teach
courses with a multicultural per
spective as compared with those
who teach conventional material."

A proposal to revise distribu
tion requirements so that more
attention would be given to cul
ture and gender issues was dis
cussed last spring in the Faculty
Senate, according to Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow.
"This issue will be taken up in
the fall," Wasow told The Daily.
He added that he thinks it is
"much more important to change
curriculum than distribution
requirements."
The panel also recommended
that "senior administrative offi
cers and faculty of the institution
ought to be able to participate in
personal growth programs and
skill-building activities on multi
cultural issues."
The issues must be internal
ized, because they are "issues of
the heart," Burciaga said. And
while dorm life offers one way to
expand cultural horizons, faculty
and curriculum must also address
the issues, Burciaga added.
The review panel praised Resi
dential Education for focusing on
interpersonal, racial and ethnic
relations, stating that the pro
gram is "truly serving an educa
tional function in this regard ...
but the University should be
aware that the development of
such intentional communities
does not just happen when stu
dents live together."
Wasow expressed disappoint
ment that the comments of the
panel were so negative. A lot of
progress was made last year,
although much of it was not visi
ble in April when the panel con
vened, he said.
For example, a grant from the
Irvine Foundation funded the
development of new courses and
the review of existing courses
dealing with multiculturalism,
Wasow noted.
He said another positive
improvement at the University
was the hiring of new minority
faculty. Alaska Commissioner of
Education William Demmert and

post-doctorate student Ruddy
Busto, who specializes in Asian-
American and Mexican-American
religions, will be on campus this
year, he said.
"It is by far the most successful
year since I have been here in
terms of hiring minority faculty,"
said Wasow, who has been dean of
undergraduate studies for three
years.
According to Kathy Gillam,
assistant dean for academic
affairs, the School of Humanities
and Science hired three black fac
ulty members and one Asian-
American faculty member this
past year. Five women were also
hired.
The University made offers to
several people who have not
accepted positions yet. These
included one female, one Asian-
American and one black professor,
Gillam added.
This is better than past years,
she noted. No minority professors
and only four women were hired
in 1988-89.
Burciaga added that "minori
ties are fundamentally at lower
level positions." Two women are
University vice-presidents, but
there are no minority vice-presi
dents.
"My vision was one of growth
[when I started], but when the

budget cuts hit ... I wanted to
ensure there was not a dispropor
tionate layoff of [minority] staff
members," Burciaga said. "We are
not in a growth mode, so we need
to be very strategic about every
appointment in high level posi
tions."
It is not enough just to have
diverse people at the University;
we need to build a community,
Burciaga said. "We have reached
the second generation of affirma
tive action."
The University must build
teams and break the cycle of
elitism, she added. "Everyone of
color is on the bottom, women in
the middle and non-minority
males are leading" the commu
nity, Burciaga said.
The panel offers a "blue-print"
for the next step, and the affirma
tive action officer "will really go
over the report and help figure out
what we can do," Burciaga said.
