# Stanford releases S&L expert
## Researcher made controversial 'Nightline' appearance 
### John Louie Editorial Staff 
Stanford's Center for Eco
nomic Policy Research has sev
ered its affiliation with savings
and loan expert R. Dan Brum
baugh following a controversial
national television appearance by
him this summer.
Brumbaugh, who held a non
paying research position at the
center during the last academic
year, was released after stating
July 31 on ABC News' "Night

declared six of the ten largest
banks in the country at or near

insolvency.
Brumbaugh questioned wheth
er the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation had sufficient funds
to back obligations of up to
$100,000 for each depositor in
case those banks failed. Soon after
the broadcast, FDIC Chair
William Seidman called Brum
baugh's statements "irresponsible
and preposterous."
Before the collapse of the sav
ings and loan industry, Brum
baugh gained widespread credibil
ity when he became one of the
first economists to predict the
industry's downfall.
Brumbaugh had planned to ini

at Stanford that would investigate
the commercial banking industry.
However, in a Sept. 11 letter, Cen
ter Director John Shoven notified
Brumbaugh that the ties between
him and the economic center
would be severed.
Brumbaugh, an independent
consultant for private firms, was
affiliated as a senior research
scholar at the center last year. His
responsibilities included the plan
ning of a May conference in Wash
ington, D.C. on the savings and
loan industry and the deposit
insurance system of banking.
