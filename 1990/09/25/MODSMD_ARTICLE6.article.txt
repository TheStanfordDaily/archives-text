# Stanford releases S&L expert
## Researcher made controversial 'Nightline' appearance 
### John Louie Editorial Staff 
Stanford's Center for Eco
nomic Policy Research has sev
ered its affiliation with savings
and loan expert R. Dan Brum
baugh following a controversial
national television appearance by
him this summer.
Brumbaugh, who held a non
paying research position at the
center during the last academic
year, was released after stating
July 31 on ABC News' "Night
line" that the federal bank insur
ance fund was insolvent. He also
declared six of the ten largest
banks in the country at or near

insolvency.
Brumbaugh questioned wheth
er the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation had sufficient funds
to back obligations of up to
$100,000 for each depositor in
case those banks failed. Soon after
the broadcast, FDIC Chair
William Seidman called Brum
baugh's statements "irresponsible
and preposterous."
Before the collapse of the sav
ings and loan industry, Brum
baugh gained widespread credibil
ity when he became one of the
first economists to predict the
industry's downfall.
Brumbaugh had planned to ini
tiate a proposed research project

at Stanford that would investigate
the commercial banking industry.
However, in a Sept. 11 letter, Cen
ter Director John Shoven notified
Brumbaugh that the ties between
him and the economic center
would be severed.
Brumbaugh, an independent
consultant for private firms, was
affiliated as a senior research
scholar at the center last year. His
responsibilities included the plan
ning of a May conference in Wash
ington, D.C. on the savings and
loan industry and the deposit
insurance system of banking.
According to Shoven, Brum
baugh was given his post specifi
cally to facilitate organization of
the May conference. "Brumbaugh
was never hired nor paid by the
university," Shoven said. "The
courtesy title of senior research
scholar is neither a paid nor a con
tinuing appointment."
Shoven stated that after the
conference's conclusion, Brum
baugh was interested in further
affiliation with the center through
a project on the commercial bank
ing industry. "I chose not to pur
sue that," Shoven said, citing that
no faculty member expressed
interest in involvement with
Brumbaugh's proposed project.
"Like any other grant-giving
organization, we say no quite
often," Shoven said.
Shoven added that part of the
reason why Brumbaugh was
denied further affiliation with the
center was because the proposed
project lacked involvement with a
faculty member, which is neces
sary for projects at the Center.
According to Brumbaugh,
Shoven "said that he wanted to do
a banking project and I accepted
his idea to extend my affiliation.
From what I was told, the steering
committee of the center had no
objection to initiating the new
project before I appeared on
'Nightline.'"
After the "Nightline" episode,
Shoven's position on the project
radically changed, Brumbaugh
said. "[Shoven] told me that
because the press had described
me as a Stanford economics pro
fessor, he was concerned that my

affiliation was misinterpreted by
the press. Because of this misin
terpretation, I was to be released.
"I think that that was a petty,
intellectually inbred and myopic
point of view," Brumbaugh said.
"I don't think [Shoven] is telling
the whole story. Essentially, I
think [he] has lied."
Brumbaugh said he believes his
affiliation was severed because of
the center's contact with the
banking industry and the govern
ment, which were attacked in his
televised statements.
"It's a conflict of interest for
(Stanford professors) Michael
Boskin and John Taylor to be on
the steering committee for the
center after I publicly attacked
the Reagan and Bush Administra
tions," Brumbaugh said. Boskin is
currently chair of the Council of
Economic Advisers to the Presi
dent, and Taylor is a member of
the council.
Shoven, however, denied
Brumbaugh's contention of gov
ernmental involvement. "I had no
communication with the Bush
administration," Shoven said. He
told the Associated Press that
Brumbaugh was "dreaming up
conspiracies."
"The center is a major fund
raising mechanism," Brumbaugh
said. "I believe that after [the
'Nightline' broadcast], money
from bank-related donors was
threatened."
Brumbaugh said Shoven's deci
sion to deny the proposed project
was "ludicrous."
"I find it hard to believe that
the Center won't research the
most important subject of our
time," Brumbaugh said, referring
to the savings and loan and bank
ing industry crises. "I can think of

'I think that that was a
petty, intellectually
inbred and myopic
point of view.'

many other members of the fac
ulty who would be interested in
such research."
Shoven said that Brumbaugh
was not technically being fired
because the job was a non-paying
position.
"[Shoven] maintains that I was
not a full-time employee," Brum
baugh said. "But I believe that's a
distinction without meaning. It
was a chosen affiliation between
myself and the university, and we
both gave and received considera
tion. We both received value from
the affiliation."
Brumbaugh's predictions of an
unstable savings and loan indus
try appear to be verified by the
events since the July 31 broad
cast. Earlier this month, Chase
Manhattan fired 5,000 employees
and prepared for heavy losses in
the next fiscal year. "As a result of
that broadcast," Brumbaugh said,
"the discourse changed from the
savings and loan crisis to the sav
ings and loan and commercial
bank crises.
"The failure of the banking sys
tem has probed the weaknesses in
the administration, Congress, the
Treasury, the Council of Eco
nomic Advisers, the media and
academia itself," Brumbaugh said.
"It shows that if a non-tenured
member of the community takes
an intellectually honest but con
troversial stand, that person can
be dispatched without examining
the validity of those ideas."

center during the last academic
year, was released after stating
July 31 on ABC News' "Night
line" that the federal bank insur
ance fund was insolvent. He also
declared six of the ten largest
banks in the country at or near

insolvency.
Brumbaugh questioned wheth
er the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation had sufficient funds
to back obligations of up to
$100,000 for each depositor in
case those banks failed. Soon after
the broadcast, FDIC Chair
William Seidman called Brum
baugh's statements "irresponsible
and preposterous."
Before the collapse of the sav
ings and loan industry, Brum
baugh gained widespread credibil
ity when he became one of the
first economists to predict the
industry's downfall.
Brumbaugh had planned to ini
tiate a proposed research project

at Stanford that would investigate
the commercial banking industry.
However, in a Sept. 11 letter, Cen
ter Director John Shoven notified
Brumbaugh that the ties between
him and the economic center
would be severed.
Brumbaugh, an independent
consultant for private firms, was
affiliated as a senior research
scholar at the center last year. His
responsibilities included the plan
ning of a May conference in Wash
ington, D.C. on the savings and
loan industry and the deposit
insurance system of banking.
According to Shoven, Brum
baugh was given his post specifi
cally to facilitate organization of
the May conference. "Brumbaugh
was never hired nor paid by the
university," Shoven said. "The
courtesy title of senior research
scholar is neither a paid nor a con
tinuing appointment."
Shoven stated that after the
conference's conclusion, Brum
baugh was interested in further
affiliation with the center through
a project on the commercial bank
ing industry. "I chose not to pur
sue that," Shoven said, citing that
no faculty member expressed
interest in involvement with
Brumbaugh's proposed project.
"Like any other grant-giving
organization, we say no quite
often," Shoven said.
Shoven added that part of the
reason why Brumbaugh was
denied further affiliation with the
center was because the proposed
project lacked involvement with a
faculty member, which is neces
sary for projects at the Center.
According to Brumbaugh,
Shoven "said that he wanted to do
a banking project and I accepted
his idea to extend my affiliation.
From what I was told, the steering
committee of the center had no
objection to initiating the new
project before I appeared on
'Nightline.'"
After the "Nightline" episode,
Shoven's position on the project
radically changed, Brumbaugh
said. "[Shoven] told me that
because the press had described
me as a Stanford economics pro
fessor, he was concerned that my

affiliation was misinterpreted by
the press. Because of this misin
terpretation, I was to be released.
"I think that that was a petty,
intellectually inbred and myopic
point of view," Brumbaugh said.
"I don't think [Shoven] is telling
the whole story. Essentially, I
think [he] has lied."
Brumbaugh said he believes his
affiliation was severed because of
the center's contact with the
banking industry and the govern
ment, which were attacked in his
televised statements.
"It's a conflict of interest for
(Stanford professors) Michael
Boskin and John Taylor to be on
the steering committee for the
center after I publicly attacked
the Reagan and Bush Administra
tions," Brumbaugh said. Boskin is
currently chair of the Council of
Economic Advisers to the Presi
dent, and Taylor is a member of
the council.
Shoven, however, denied
Brumbaugh's contention of gov
ernmental involvement. "I had no
communication with the Bush
administration," Shoven said. He
told the Associated Press that
Brumbaugh was "dreaming up
conspiracies."
"The center is a major fund
raising mechanism," Brumbaugh
said. "I believe that after [the
'Nightline' broadcast], money
from bank-related donors was
threatened."
Brumbaugh said Shoven's deci
sion to deny the proposed project
was "ludicrous."
"I find it hard to believe that
the Center won't research the
most important subject of our
time," Brumbaugh said, referring
to the savings and loan and bank
ing industry crises. "I can think of

'I think that that was a
petty, intellectually
inbred and myopic
point of view.'

many other members of the fac
ulty who would be interested in
such research."
Shoven said that Brumbaugh
was not technically being fired
because the job was a non-paying
position.
"[Shoven] maintains that I was
not a full-time employee," Brum
baugh said. "But I believe that's a
distinction without meaning. It
was a chosen affiliation between
myself and the university, and we
both gave and received considera
tion. We both received value from
the affiliation."
Brumbaugh's predictions of an
unstable savings and loan indus
try appear to be verified by the
events since the July 31 broad
cast. Earlier this month, Chase
Manhattan fired 5,000 employees
and prepared for heavy losses in
the next fiscal year. "As a result of
that broadcast," Brumbaugh said,
"the discourse changed from the
savings and loan crisis to the sav
ings and loan and commercial
bank crises.
"The failure of the banking sys
tem has probed the weaknesses in
the administration, Congress, the
Treasury, the Council of Eco
nomic Advisers, the media and
academia itself," Brumbaugh said.
"It shows that if a non-tenured
member of the community takes
an intellectually honest but con
troversial stand, that person can
be dispatched without examining
the validity of those ideas."
