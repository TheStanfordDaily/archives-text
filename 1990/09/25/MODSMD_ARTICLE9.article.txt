# Women's Center may move to more central campus location
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
The Women's Center may move from
its current location "in the boonies" —
the Toyon Eating Clubs — to the center
of campus, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
The most likely new location is the
first floor of the Fire Truck House. Sev
eral smaller campus groups, such as the
Society of Women Engineers and the
Amateur Radio Club, now use the space.
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center occupies the building's sec
ond floor.
"We are happy about the possibility of

the move," said Teri Hopper, acting coor
dinator of the center. "The Women's Cen
ter has been pushing for this for a very
long time.
"It has been a goal (of the University)
to bring the Women's Center to the center
of campus for a number of years," Jack
son said.
The center's staff has been seeking a
location closer to the center of campus to
make it more accessible to students and
easier to find. In addition, close proximity
to the ethnic community centers and the
LGBCC would help foster connections
with those communities, Hopper said.
"There are a lot of synergies between
the LGBCC and the Women's Center,"

said graduate student David Bradfute,
the LGBCC officer. "Obviously some of
the issues are very different, but some of
the issues are the same."
In addition, the move could help
increase the number of women active in
Stanford's gay community, which has his
torically been composed primarily of men.
"If the Women's Center were really close
(to the LGBCC), bisexual and lesbian
women in the women's community might
be more likely to be active in both com
munities," Bradfute said.
According to Jackson, this quarter the
University will consult with the student
groups who currently occupy the Fire
Truck House's first floor. "We need to

review how well the space has been used
and how well it is meeting the needs of
the folks in there," he said. "It is an
option we are looking at."
But other administrators doubt the
move can take place. "Until we get more
real estate, as far as I am concerned it is
not a possibility," said Program and Fra
ternal Affairs Adviser Michael Ramsey-
Perez. "The physical reality is that there
is not enough money or space to relocate
the current tenants" of the Fire Truck
House.
According to Nanci Howe, director of
student activities, "It is not out of the
question, but ... we first have to audit
the spaces in terms of health and safety

issues, and how well the space is being
used."
Another consideration in the decision
whether to move the Women's Center is
that the Fire Truck House was recently
refurbished.
The center houses a library of feminist
books and sponsors campus events such
as Women's Herstory Month. It has also
housed groups such as the Rape Educa
tion Project, the Women's Guide to Stan
ford and Students Against Sexism.
In addition, SWOPSI 174, Issues in
Self-Defense for Women, is taught at the
center. The class could remain in the eat
ing clubs or could be moved to another
campus site such as the Knoll.
