My Favorite
Model?
Cabriolet.
Fashion Design senior Gerardo Cantu's
1988 Volkswagen Cabriolet fits him
perfectly.
"As the creator of a line of women's
clothing called 'Fashion Panic', I'm always
driving my lovely six-foot fashion models to
shows and photo shoots.
"In my Cabriolet, all of us fit comfortably.
There's room for cameras and tripods. And
we look fabulous."
If you're ever at the University of Texas
in Austin, look for Gerardo driving his
Cabriolet. He'll be the guy with the well
dressed ladies - riding in style.
Experience all the Fahrvergnugen and
convertible fun of Cabriolet at your
Volkswagen dealer. Wr
