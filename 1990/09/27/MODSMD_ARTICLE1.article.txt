# Kennedy: No wrongdoing on indirect costs

As planning for federal investigations
of Stanford's indirect cost policies contin
ued in Washington yesterday, University
President Donald Kennedy reasserted in
an interview here that he was confident
the University had nothing to hide.
"I do not expect a discovery of any
wrongdoing on our part," he told The
Daily yesterday. In the hour-long inter
view — the first time Kennedy has dis
cussed the federal investigations with the
media — Stanford's president speculated
on the effect the investigations will have
on the University during the next few
months and expressed frustration with
the way the story has been handled by
Bay Area newspapers.

Citing unnamed congressional
sources, several local newspapers have
reported that Stanford may be asked to
return $300 million to the federal govern
ment. Officials involved in the investiga
tions won't confirm this figure. It's been
"plucked out of the air," Kennedy said
yesterday.
"I think the media look very hard for
any sign of scandal," he said, "especially
when it involves an institution of high
prestige." While the investigations and
the resulting media coverage pose a large
public relations problem for the Univer
sity, the inquiries shouldn't hamper the
ability of researchers here to obtain
future federal grants, Kennedy said.
Two federal agencies, the General
Accounting Office and the Office of Naval
Research, are examining the possibility

that the University repeatedly overbilled
the U.S. government for indirect costs of
federally sponsored research at Stanford.
Indirect costs are expenditures, such
as energy costs, maintenance and use of
the library by researchers, which are nec
essary to support research but cannot be
easily attributed to a specific project.
Kennedy said an internal audit of

Stanford's indirect cost
procedures is nearing
completion and could be
ready by tomorrow.
"Hopefully," he said,
"this will tell me if there
is some large problem
that has somehow
escaped us."
Kennedy said he had not

yet been given any indi
cation about the findings of the audit.
However, he said, the auditors most likely
would have briefed him by now if they
had found substantial wrongdoing.
Kennedy ordered the internal audit in
late July, when concerns about Stanford's
indirect costs were raised by Paul Biddle,
the campus representative from the
Office of Naval Research. The ONR is the

federal agency that reviews research costs
at Stanford.
In a letter addressed to his superior in
the Navy, Biddle wrote that indirect cost
negotiations between Stanford and the
ONR were marred by "abuse" and "dis
tortion." The letter apparently prompted
the naval review.
Biddle has been unavailable for com
ment.
The General Accounting Office investi
gation was requested by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich., chair of the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investigations.
GAO officials are expected to arrive on
campus Oct. 11, more than a month later
than originally planned, to begin their
investigation. Preparation for the investi-
