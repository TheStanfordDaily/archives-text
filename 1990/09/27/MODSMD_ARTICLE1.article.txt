# Kennedy: No wrongdoing on indirect costs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
As planning for federal investigations
of Stanford's indirect cost policies contin
ued in Washington yesterday, University
President Donald Kennedy reasserted in
an interview here that he was confident
the University had nothing to hide.
"I do not expect a discovery of any
wrongdoing on our part," he told The
Daily yesterday. In the hour-long inter
view — the first time Kennedy has dis
cussed the federal investigations with the
media — Stanford's president speculated
on the effect the investigations will have
on the University during the next few
months and expressed frustration with
the way the story has been handled by
Bay Area newspapers.

Citing unnamed congressional
sources, several local newspapers have
reported that Stanford may be asked to
return $300 million to the federal govern
ment. Officials involved in the investiga
tions won't confirm this figure. It's been
"plucked out of the air," Kennedy said
yesterday.
"I think the media look very hard for
any sign of scandal," he said, "especially
when it involves an institution of high
prestige." While the investigations and
the resulting media coverage pose a large
public relations problem for the Univer
sity, the inquiries shouldn't hamper the
ability of researchers here to obtain
future federal grants, Kennedy said.

Research, are examining the possibility

that the University repeatedly overbilled
the U.S. government for indirect costs of
federally sponsored research at Stanford.
Indirect costs are expenditures, such
as energy costs, maintenance and use of
the library by researchers, which are nec
essary to support research but cannot be
easily attributed to a specific project.
Kennedy said an internal audit of

Stanford's indirect cost
procedures is nearing
completion and could be
ready by tomorrow.
"Hopefully," he said,
"this will tell me if there
is some large problem
that has somehow
escaped us."
Kennedy said he had not

yet been given any indi
cation about the findings of the audit.
However, he said, the auditors most likely
would have briefed him by now if they
had found substantial wrongdoing.
Kennedy ordered the internal audit in
late July, when concerns about Stanford's
indirect costs were raised by Paul Biddle,
the campus representative from the
Office of Naval Research. The ONR is the

federal agency that reviews research costs
at Stanford.
In a letter addressed to his superior in
the Navy, Biddle wrote that indirect cost
negotiations between Stanford and the
ONR were marred by "abuse" and "dis
tortion." The letter apparently prompted
the naval review.
Biddle has been unavailable for com
ment.
The General Accounting Office investi
gation was requested by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich., chair of the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investigations.
GAO officials are expected to arrive on
campus Oct. 11, more than a month later
than originally planned, to begin their
investigation. Preparation for the investi-

gation has proceeded "a helluva
lot slower than we expected," said
Peter Stockton, a staff member of
the Dingell subcommittee.
The GAO investigation is
expected to take several months.
Kennedy sent a letter Tuesday to
Stanford deans and department
heads encouraging them to coop
erate with the GAO review.
In addition to their work at
Stanford, the GAO plans to exam
ine indirect-cost practices at three
other universities, Stockton said.
The subcommittee hopes to look
at indirect costs at two institu
tions whose research costs are
monitored by the ONR (as hap
pens at Stanford) and two whose
costs are monitored by the
Department of Health and
Human Services.
Stockton said the investigation
of Stanford was launched "not
necessarily to look for criminal
wrongdoing," but rather to
ensure taxpayers' dollars are
being spent wisely.
Stanford's indirect cost rate
last year — 74 percent — was
among the nation's highest. When
researchers at Stanford and other
universities apply for federal
grants, they must also request
money for indirect costs. In fiscal

1990, if a Stanford professor
wanted to perform $100,000
vvorth of research, an additional
$74,000 would have to be
requested to cover indirect costs.
"The overhead rates are too
high," Stockton said.
Kennedy expressed concern
yesterday that little distinction
had been made in the press
between possible wrongdoing by
Stanford and more general con
cerns being raised about federal
indirect-cost policies. The federal
government has established
guidelines governing indirect cost
recovery in a publication called
Circulation A-21.
Given the complexity and con
troversy of indirect costs, the
guidelines themselves will proba
bly receive a lot of scrutiny during
the investigations, Kennedy said.
But such scrutiny does not
amount to an indictment of Stan
ford, he said.
"So far the local media have
not shown the ability to make a
great discrimination between
public policy issues and the issues
of fraud," Kennedy said, later
characterizing the local reporting
as "lazy."
The investigation should focus
on two issues, he said: first,
whether or not current federal
indirect-cost policy is sound; and
second, whether or not anyone at
Stanford or in the government
has violated the current policies.

"If anybody's violated the rule
book, we ought to know about it,"
he said.
So far, Kennedy said, the only
allegations of wrongdoing have
come from Biddle's letter. "Stan
ford engaged in fraudulent acts
and at a minimum (made) false
statements and false claims,"
wrote Biddle, who has been
assigned to Stanford since Octo
ber 1988. In his letter, he did not
provide specific examples.
"I see no reason to doubt that
he has a sincere concern for the
way the government's money is
spent," Kennedy said. "But ...
the concerns he's stating aren't
very focused."
In his letter, Biddle also wrote
that "by leveraging upon their
personal access to ONR, the Uni
versity attempts to affect the
scope and content of DCAA field
work." The DCAA — the Defense
Contracting Audit Agency — is
responsible for auditing all
federally sponsored research costs
at Stanford.
In effect, Biddle is claiming
that Stanford's relationship with
the ONR "has been too cozy,"
Kennedy said. Kennedy said he
has no reason to believe that is
true.
Stanford, which conducts
about $400 million of research
annually, has proposed an indirect
cost rate of 78 percent for 1990-
91.

high," Stockton said.
Kennedy expressed concern
yesterday that little distinction
had been made in the press
between possible wrongdoing by
Stanford and more general con
cerns being raised about federal
indirect-cost policies. The federal
government has established
guidelines governing indirect cost
recovery in a publication called
Circulation A-21.
Given the complexity and con
troversy of indirect costs, the
guidelines themselves will proba
bly receive a lot of scrutiny during
the investigations, Kennedy said.
But such scrutiny does not
amount to an indictment of Stan
ford, he said.
"So far the local media have
not shown the ability to make a
great discrimination between
public policy issues and the issues
of fraud," Kennedy said, later
characterizing the local reporting
as "lazy."
The investigation should focus
on two issues, he said: first,
whether or not current federal
indirect-cost policy is sound; and
second, whether or not anyone at
Stanford or in the government
has violated the current policies.

"If anybody's violated the rule
book, we ought to know about it,"
he said.
So far, Kennedy said, the only
allegations of wrongdoing have
come from Biddle's letter. "Stan
ford engaged in fraudulent acts
and at a minimum (made) false
statements and false claims,"
wrote Biddle, who has been
assigned to Stanford since Octo
ber 1988. In his letter, he did not
provide specific examples.
"I see no reason to doubt that
he has a sincere concern for the
way the government's money is
spent," Kennedy said. "But ...
the concerns he's stating aren't
very focused."
In his letter, Biddle also wrote
that "by leveraging upon their
personal access to ONR, the Uni
versity attempts to affect the
scope and content of DCAA field
work." The DCAA — the Defense
Contracting Audit Agency — is
responsible for auditing all
federally sponsored research costs
at Stanford.
In effect, Biddle is claiming
that Stanford's relationship with
the ONR "has been too cozy,"
Kennedy said. Kennedy said he
has no reason to believe that is
true.
Stanford, which conducts
about $400 million of research
annually, has proposed an indirect
cost rate of 78 percent for 1990-
91.
As planning for federal investigations
of Stanford's indirect cost policies contin
ued in Washington yesterday, University
President Donald Kennedy reasserted in
an interview here that he was confident
the University had nothing to hide.
"I do not expect a discovery of any
wrongdoing on our part," he told The
Daily yesterday. In the hour-long inter
view — the first time Kennedy has dis
cussed the federal investigations with the
media — Stanford's president speculated
on the effect the investigations will have
on the University during the next few
months and expressed frustration with
the way the story has been handled by
Bay Area newspapers.

Citing unnamed congressional
sources, several local newspapers have
reported that Stanford may be asked to
return $300 million to the federal govern
ment. Officials involved in the investiga
tions won't confirm this figure. It's been
"plucked out of the air," Kennedy said
yesterday.
"I think the media look very hard for
any sign of scandal," he said, "especially
when it involves an institution of high
prestige." While the investigations and
the resulting media coverage pose a large
public relations problem for the Univer
sity, the inquiries shouldn't hamper the
ability of researchers here to obtain
future federal grants, Kennedy said.

Accounting Office and the Office of Naval
Research, are examining the possibility

that the University repeatedly overbilled
the U.S. government for indirect costs of
federally sponsored research at Stanford.
Indirect costs are expenditures, such
as energy costs, maintenance and use of
the library by researchers, which are nec
essary to support research but cannot be
easily attributed to a specific project.
Kennedy said an internal audit of

Stanford's indirect cost
procedures is nearing
completion and could be
ready by tomorrow.
"Hopefully," he said,
"this will tell me if there
is some large problem
that has somehow
escaped us."
Kennedy said he had not

yet been given any indi
cation about the findings of the audit.
However, he said, the auditors most likely
would have briefed him by now if they
had found substantial wrongdoing.
Kennedy ordered the internal audit in
late July, when concerns about Stanford's
indirect costs were raised by Paul Biddle,
the campus representative from the
Office of Naval Research. The ONR is the

federal agency that reviews research costs
at Stanford.
In a letter addressed to his superior in
the Navy, Biddle wrote that indirect cost
negotiations between Stanford and the
ONR were marred by "abuse" and "dis
tortion." The letter apparently prompted
the naval review.
Biddle has been unavailable for com
ment.
The General Accounting Office investi
gation was requested by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich., chair of the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investigations.
GAO officials are expected to arrive on
campus Oct. 11, more than a month later
than originally planned, to begin their
investigation. Preparation for the investi-

gation has proceeded "a helluva
lot slower than we expected," said
Peter Stockton, a staff member of
the Dingell subcommittee.
The GAO investigation is
expected to take several months.
Kennedy sent a letter Tuesday to
Stanford deans and department
heads encouraging them to coop
erate with the GAO review.
In addition to their work at
Stanford, the GAO plans to exam
ine indirect-cost practices at three
other universities, Stockton said.
The subcommittee hopes to look
at indirect costs at two institu
tions whose research costs are
monitored by the ONR (as hap
pens at Stanford) and two whose
costs are monitored by the
Department of Health and
Human Services.
Stockton said the investigation
of Stanford was launched "not
necessarily to look for criminal
wrongdoing," but rather to
ensure taxpayers' dollars are
being spent wisely.
Stanford's indirect cost rate
last year — 74 percent — was
among the nation's highest. When
researchers at Stanford and other
universities apply for federal
grants, they must also request
money for indirect costs. In fiscal

1990, if a Stanford professor
wanted to perform $100,000
vvorth of research, an additional
$74,000 would have to be
requested to cover indirect costs.
"The overhead rates are too
high," Stockton said.
