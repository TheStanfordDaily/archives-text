Superpowers still
disagree over arms
NEW YORK (AP) - The United States and
the Soviet Union were unable yesterday to iron
out their differences on unfinished treaties to
reduce conventional and long-range nuclear
weapons.
Failure to reach agreement on the accords
could force postponement of a 34-nation sum
mit meeting in Paris in mid-November, inter
rupt the easing of East-West tensions in
Europe and delay a trip to Moscow in Decem
ber by President Bush.
Owl flap turns partisan
WASHINGTON (AP) - United efforts to
save both the northern spotted owl and North
west timber jobs deteriorated into partisan pol
itics this week as Republican Sen. Slade Gor
ton accused majority Democrats of choosing
environmental protection over working class
people.
"The fabled Democratic Party of the work
ing man ... stands nakedly captive to the wine
and Brie urban special interests, attacking the
prospect of saving even some of the 35,000 jobs
now imperiled in the Northwest," Gorton, R-
Wash., said in a floor speech.
South Africa may have
produced nuclear weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) - South Africa has
been developing nuclear weapons for 15 years
and may have begun producing them in 1979,
according to a CLA document made public yes
terday by an environmental group.
The document, an internal agency memo
written in December 1979, represents the first
known U.S. government assessment of devel
opments long rumored outside official circles.
The Natural Resources Defense Council,
which obtained the memo under the Freedom
of Information Act, said it was making the doc
ument public to prevent South Africa from
hiding large amounts of enriched uranium
from international inspection.
House reins use of free mail
WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats
turned back a GOP effort yesterday to rein in
lawmakers' use of free mailing privileges in
election years and weaken the role of union
political action committees in financing their
campaigns.
On a 225-194 largely party-line vote, the
House rejected a Republican motion telling
negotiators on campaign finance reform to
accept Senate proposals to reduce gifts to a
candidate from a single PAC from $10,000 to
$2,000 and disclose how much each congress
man spends on franked mail.
Bush may compromise
on capital gains cut
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush
may be willing to drop his insistence on a cut in
the capital gains tax, Republican congressmen
said Wednesday, a demand that has been the
mqjor obstacle to a budget deal.
But the apparent softening of Bush's posi
tion was revealed on a day when Bush and con
gressional Democrats had their most wither
ing public flare-up over the talks in weeks.
The two sides accused each other of endan
gering their stalled bargaining, just five days
before disruptive cuts in government services
set be imposed if negotiations fail.
College costs up again
NEW YORK (AP) — A year at college will
cost an average of 5 percent to 8 percent more
this fall, a slight lessening in the decade-long
spell of higher education inflation, according to
an annual survey released yesterday.
According to the survey, fixed charges at
four-year private institutions — including
tuition, fees and room and board — average
$13,544, an 8 percent increase from last year's
$12,557. A year ago, such charges rose 9 per
cent.
