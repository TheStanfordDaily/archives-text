# Government curtails teen abortion rights
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate voted yesterday to require
federally supported family plan
ning clinics to notify parents of
teenage girls who seek abortions.
The action came on an amend
ment to a bill renewing federal
family planning assistance, which
emerged as the latest battle
ground in the political war over
abortion.
The bill was already under a
veto threat, however, and the vote
was one in a series of conflicting
and confusing Senate actions that
left the bill facing an uncertain
future.
A vote to limit debate fell 10
short of the necessary 60 votes,
diminishing prospects of any fur
ther action on the bill itself.
The Senate approved by a large
margin another amendment
Tuesday evening that would nul
lify Bush administration regula
tions prohibiting the family plan
ning clinics from offering any
information or counseling involv
ing abortion.
The result was a Senate bill
that contained provisions pushed

by both anti-abortion and abor
tion-rights forces.
In the House, meanwhile, a
similar version, extending the life
of family planning services pro
vided through Title X of the Pub
lic Health Service Act of 1970, was
approved by the Energy and Com
merce Committee without any of
the controversial Senate provi
sions on abortion. The clinics offer
family planning and health ser
vices to the poor.
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
subcommittee chairman and an
abortion-rights advocate, said he
would push for enactment of a bill
without the Senate's abortion
provisions as a way to avoid a
presidential veto.
"I think our best chance to
reauthorize Title X is to send a
simple continuation of the pro
gram," Waxman said.
The family planning act's
authorization expired in 1985, but
services have been funded by
Congress each year since then
through so-called continuing reso
lutions, or catchall spending mea
sures.
