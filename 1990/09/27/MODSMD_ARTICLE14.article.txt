"In this historic phase the Germans are filled
with a sense of history and responsibility.... We will
not forget the endless suffering that was brought
upon the nations of Europe and the world in the
name of Germany. We commemorate all the victims
of war and tyranny, and we recall especially the
untold suffering inflicted upon the Jewish people."
â€” West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, addressing the 45th General Assembly
one week before East and West Germany will be
reunited.
