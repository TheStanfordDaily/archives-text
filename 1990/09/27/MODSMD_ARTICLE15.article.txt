# Subway vigilante admits racist motives for shooting
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - In newly
sworn testimony, subway gunman
Bernhard Goetz drastically contradicts
the defense that won him a 1987
acquittal for the attempted murder of
four black teenagers, court papers
showed yesterday.
Goetz, in a deposition for a $50 mil
lion lawsuit filed against him by one
victim, also acknowledged making
racist comments about blacks and His
panics before Dec. 22, 1984 — the day
he shot the four youths on a subway
train.
"I hope the jurors in that trial wake
up screaming in the night when they

read this," said attorney William Kun
stler, who questioned Goetz for plain
tiff Darrell Cabey, 22.
Cabey was left paralyzed and brain
damaged by the shooting. The three
other youths Goetz shot all recovered,
and were subsequently arrested on
various criminal charges. Goetz
asserts he fired in self-defense because
the four were about to mug him.
Goetz, who never testified at his
own trial, answered questions about
the day of the shootings under oath
Monday for the first time. The tran
script was released yesterday.
Also yesterday, Goetz questioned

Cabey in the Bronx courtroom about
what happened that afternoon six
years ago. But Cabey was unable to
answer any questions posed by Goetz
during the 30-minute hearing, and
could not identify pictures or provide
the names of the other three youths.
Attorneys for Cabey said his inabil
ity to answer showed the brain damage
he suffered in the shooting. But Goetz
dismissed it as an act and said be
would ask for dismissal of Cabey's law
suit.
"Many years ago I tried to escape
the draft and did something similar,"
Goetz told reporters after the hearing.

"But I think I did a much better act."

In his deposition, Goetz said he was
on the train less than 30 seconds
before opening fire with his .38-caliber
Smith & Wesson revolver. Kunstler
asked Goetz about the shots he fired at
Cabey.
"I walked directly in front of that
person, put the gun in his ribs, and
pulled the trigger again with the
words, 'You don't look too bad, here's
another,' " Goetz replied.
"What was that?" Kunstler asked.
"I fired again with the words, 'You
don't look too bad, here's another,'
Goetz repeated.
