Soviets join EC in denouncing Iraq
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Soviet Union
and the European Community yesterday jointly
denounced Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait
and said they are ready to consider applying more
pressure on the Baghdad government.
Their joint statement was released after Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met with
Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis of Italy, current
chief of the EC.
It read, "The European Community and its mem
ber states and the Soviet Union urge the Iraqi
authorities to allow immediately all foreign citizens
who so desire to leave Iraq and Kuwait.
"Time does not work for the aggressor. It will only
strengthen the determination of the international
community to repeal the aggression and to fully
restore Kuwait's sovereignty."
The Soviets and 12-nation EC vowed to cooperate
fully to see that the trade embargo on Iraq and occu
pied Kuwait is enforced, and said they are "also pre
pared to consider additional steps consistent with
the U.N. Charter."
Baker rejects Iraqi threats
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad has received a warning from Iraqi authori
ties that any non-diplomats being harbored at the
American Embassy in Kuwait will be hanged, Secre
tary of State James A. Baker 111 said yesterday.
Asked about the warning before meeting with
Kuwait's foreign minister, Baker said, "We've read
it; it's repugnant and we reject it."
In Washington, however, Iraq's Ambassador
Mohamed al-Mashat denied last night that any such
threats have been made by Iraqi officials.

"We're not threatening anyone," al-Mashat told
reporters after a meeting at the State Department.
He refused further comment.
Allies discuss fund-raising
WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S.-led task force met
yesterday to discuss providing billions of dollars of

economic assistance in the Persian Gulf crisis but
failed to resolve several disputes that are plaguing
the fund-raising plan, officials said.
The talks, which involved more than 65 officials
representing over 20 nations, were held to launch
the Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination Group. Pres
ident Bush announced formation of the group in a
speech Tuesday.

A senior U.S. Treasury official, who briefed
reporters after the meeting ended, said the countries
were in strong agreement that economic assistance
to seriously affected countries was a critical element
in the campaign to isolate Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
Bush ready to arm Saudis
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush has
decided to sell $7.5 billion in new weaponry to Saudi
Arabia in immediate response to the Persian Gulf
crisis, and to ask Congress' consent for another $14
billion next year, sources said.
The package, which was to be submitted formally
to Congress late yesterday or today, includes M-1A
tanks, TOW anti-tank missiles, Bradley fighting
vehicles, trucks and armored personnel carriers, said
congressional and administration sources, who
spoke only on condition of anonymity.
Jordan's rift with
Saudi Arabia deepens
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — The diplomatic war in
the Persian Gulf escalated on another front yester
day — between Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Jordanian
newspapers called Saudi officials "warmongers"
who outdid Israel and the West in acting against
Arab interests.
The newspapers were reacting to Saudi Arabia's
cutting off ou supplies to Jordan and expelling more
than 30 Jordanian Embassy employees on charges of
spying for Iraq.
Officials in Amman sought to play down the divi
sion, hoping it will heal. But many Jordanians
expressed bitterness and defiance.
