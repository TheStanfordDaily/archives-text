## Quakeproofing 
### 
Our progress is good,
but we must continue
to prepare ourselves

WHEN THE GROUND
SHOOK last Oct. 17, there
was little time to think, lit
tle time to plan, little time to do
much of anything but duck and
cover.
The days and weeks following
the Loma Prieta quake were filled
with apprehension for people
throughout the Bay Area, as after
shocks continued to jolt the region
and fears about the risks of living
on a fault line nagged at people's
consciences.
Those were the days when
everyone was talking about earth
quake insurance, about the tax
money that could be used to reno
vate potentially collapsing free
ways, about the preparations that
should be made for "next time."
Now, as we approach the first
anniversary of the October quake,
much of the fear has — thankfully
— disappeared. But with it has also
disappeared much of the expanded
discussion and heightened aware
ness that characterized those first
scary, but educational, weeks.
Those of us who experienced the
7.1 shock will never forget those 15
long seconds. What has proven
much easier to put out of mind is
the urgent sense that action must
be taken to reduce the conse
quences of another, larger quake
occurring in the future.
In the last four days, two earth
quakes centered near Stanford
have jolted the Peninsula. Though
tame in comparison to the quake of
Oct. 17, these shakers remind us
that the time is now, not later, to
prepare for the worst.
Health and Safety Systems, a

division of the University's Hous
ing and Food Services department,
has taken the lead in preparing for
the worst by burying huge cylin
ders filled with food and emer
gency supplies around campus.
The cylinders, 12 in all, contain
enough food for 10,000 people for
two days. In addition, the cylinders
hold first aid supplies, shelter-con
struction equipment and nearly
16,000 individual survival kits that
contain such necessities as water
and blankets.
Buried five feet underground in
areas near dormitories, the "safety
silos" cost $200,000 to build, stock
and buiy.
That's a modest cost — even
during tight budget times — when
considering that the structures
could one day save many lives.
The silos are thus a very good
start for the University. The next
step is to expand Stanford's earth
quake preparedness education to
make it mandatory for all members
of the community.
Booklets and occasional presen
tations on earthquake safety do
part of the job, but not all of it. A
seminar on earthquake safety
awareness could be developed for
presentation to each incoming
class during Orientation. Similar
projects could be spearheaded for
staff, faculty and campus resi
dents, focusing on ways in which to
prepare our residences and work
places for a earthquake.
Preparing for disaster and edu
cating to minimize the scope of a
disaster are important work in
earthquake country.
Now, while we have the time to
think and the time to plan, is the
appropriate moment to continue
developing ways to prepare Stan
ford for the natural disaster that
scientists estimate has a 50 percent
chance of occurring in the next 30
years.
