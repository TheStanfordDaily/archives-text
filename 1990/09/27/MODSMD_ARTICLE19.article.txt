Like Prohibition,
U.S. war on drugs
a doomed effort
Let's repeal prohibition — again!
Today in America, we are reliving his
tory. The current war on drugs is simply
a replay of our experience with alcohol
prohibition in the 1920'5, which spawned
organized crime, drive-by shootings, pop
ular disrespect for the law and corrup
tion of police and other government
agents.
Just as the "war on alcohol" was
doomed to failure and eventual repeal,
today's war on drugs is a doomed effort.
The more the police crack down on
drugs, the higher the price goes. And the
higher the price goes, the greater the
profit and the greater the incentive for
drug traders to manufacture and import
drugs. The government can't even keep
illegal drugs out of prisons today; they
will never succeed in keeping them out of
the country.
There are many practical reasons for
legalizing drugs. First, it would eliminate
the high profits from the drug trade, and
thereby remove a meyor source of rev
enue from organized crime. Second,
legalization would remove a leading
cause of police and government corrup
tion.
Third, it would free up law enforce
ment resources so that they can deal
with real crime — that is, violent crime
against people and property. Fourth,
because addicts will no longer have to
steal to support their drug addiction, our
neighborhoods will be safer.
Fifth, legalized drugs would be safer,
without the problems of unknown ingre
dients and unknown purity. Sixth, and
finally, legalization would relieve prison
overcrowding and unclog our court sys
tem.
These are practical reasons for legaliz
ing drugs; there is, however, a profound
moral reason for legalization. Each per

son owns his or her own body. The gov
ernment does not own your body —you
do. And it is simply wrong, and horribly
invasive of privacy, for the government to
try to dictate what you can or cannot do
in the privacy of your own home.
Of course, legalization of drugs will
not solve all problems associated with
drug use, just as the legalization of alco
hol did not solve all problems associated
with alcohol use. Legalization will, how
ever, allow us to deal with drug problems
openly, through education and other vol
untary, persuasive means.

Expert leveled
false charges
against econ prof
I am indignant at the scurrilous and
inaccurate charges leveled by R. Dan
Brumbaugh at my colleague John
Shoven, Director of the Center for Eco
nomic Policy Research, and reported in
The Daily (Sept. 25).
Brumbaugh claims that he was "fired"
or "released" from a "position" at Stan
ford, without a shred of documentation,
and charges that Shoven has "lied"
about the matter and caved in to political
pressure from the Bush administration
and financial pressure from "bank
related" donors." This is nonsense. Any
deceit in the affair has come from Brum
baugh himself.
Since I sit (ex officio) on the center's
steering committee, I can confirm that
Shoven's position is entirely accurate:
Brumbaugh never had any connection
with the center but a courtesy position to
facilitate one conference, which he co
organized with a Stanford faculty mem
ber. Brumbaugh dismisses as a technical
ity the fact that he was "not a full-time
employee," calling this a "distinction
without meaning."
Hardly. Brumbaugh was not an
employee of any kind. He had no salary,
no office, no responsibilities, was not
part of any research project and spent no
more than a few days at the center all
told — in connection with the one con
ference which was the sum total of his
involvement with it.
The token character of Brumbaugh's
affiliation did not, however, stop the
national media from representing him as
a "Stanford economist," a term they
clearly took to imply that he was a fac
ulty member. This highly inaccurate
characterization (and not any opinions
he may have expressed) was indeed of
concern to the center and to members of
the economics department, as it would be

The whole episode is a
chilling commentary on
the gullibility of the
media.

to any academic department. Exactly
how Brumbaugh represented his Stan
ford "position" to reporters and Night
line officials we do not know, but on that
program and others he made no effort
whatever to correct this inaccurate pub
lic billing. The whole episode is a chilling
commentary on the gullibility of the
media.
The Brumbaugh affair will have little
lasting significance, and one might even
say that it has its humorous side. But it
is disturbing that someone with John
Shoven's well-deserved reputation for
integrity should be subject to irresponsi
ble and unfounded charges in the pages
of The Daily.
