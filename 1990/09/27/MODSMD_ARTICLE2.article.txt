# Two new dorms to be constructed
## Stanford moves toward 4-year housing 
### Anna Rabinowicz 
The University will move one
step closer to its goal of four years
of guaranteed undergraduate
housing with two additional resi
dences being planned for Man
zanita Park.
The new residences, temporar
ily called "Phase 2" and "Phase
3," will stand next to the Kimball
Hall site and are scheduled for
completion in the fall of 1992.
Private donations will comprise
over two-thirds of the $12.15 mil
lion needed to complete the resi
dences. According to Olivier
Pieron, project manager for the
new dorms, several donors from
the Board of Trustees have
pledged about $8 million to the
project.
"Fundraising is still going on
for the rest of [the project]," he
said, estimating that the Univer
sity will probably contribute
about $4 million to cover the
remaining costs.
Though this project has been
started in the midst of earthquake
repairs and reinforcement, the
trustees "have the right when
they pledge $3 million or $4 mil
lion to direct it to something they
want," Pieron said.
While approval for this project
will come from the trustees, who
are also the main contributors,
Pieron said he does not think that
the new residences will be
approved in a manner different
from any other project. The

Two new dorms,
temporarily called
'Phase 1' and
'Phase 2,' are
expected to be fin
ished in 1992,
replacing 40 to 45
trailers.

trustees "may want to have a little
bit more input than in other pro
jects," he said. "But it's up to the
campus architects to manage
this."
After the projected completion
of "Phase 2" and "Phase 3," an
estimated 50 to 55 of the 95 Man
zanita trailers will remain stand
ing. Pieron said he believes that
the University will benefit from
not entirely demolishing Man
zanita. "Basically, what [the trail
ers] cost is their maintenance.
They are a very good source of
revenue for housing and food ser
vices," he said.
Before the final plan for
"Phase 2" is approved in June, the
Office of Residential Education
will refer to an advisory commit
tee comprised of students, resi
dent fellows and resident assis
tants for input.
