## Sun-Times summer filled with thrills 
### 
I KNEW from the moment I walked
into the offices of the Chicago Sun-
Times I would be in trouble.
It was late April. I had been invited to
interview with Chicago's #1 selling paper
(which, by some quirk of newspaper
accounting, is second in circulation to the
Chicago Tribune), and I was feeling
pretty nervous.
And, as I soon discovered, with good
reason. My first interviewer had one of
those impish looks on his face. The type
that lets you know he's just about to ask
you a question from hefi, forcing, you to
look around at his many mementos of a
long newspaper career while you think of
something semi-coherent to say.
"So, has there ever been a story you
couldn't cover?" he said, grinning mis
chievously. As he proudly explained
thereafter, I was "caught-22." If I
answered yes, I would have looked like a
98-pound weakling, as far as reporting
was concerned. If I answered no, I looked
cocky beyond belief.
Ultimately, I weaseled my way past
that question and six or seven hundred
others to obtain an internship with the
paper. During my time there, I experi
enced a kind of non-stop culture shock.
When I showed up for my first day of
work, I encountered the most user-hos
tile computer system ever. At a time when
The Daily is upgrading to an all-Macin
tosh system, the Sun-Times had comput
ers so old they were wearing wide lapels. I

was ecstatic to note that their manufac
turer was being sued for $7 million by
reporters who claimed the terminals
caused a number of health risks, accord
ing to a Wall Street Journal story.
I was thrilled to work every day at
what was to me not just a paper,
but my hometown paper, the one I had
read while growing up. But after spend
ing so many years here at Stanford, I feel
like an outsider when I go back.
Most of my time was spent covering a
case in which a father sued his former
fiancee, seeking a court order that would
force their 3-year-old twins to be tested to
see if their bone marrow could save the
life of their half-brother, who has a rare
and terminal form of leukemia. The suit
would also force them to donate marrow
if compatible, all against their mother's
wishes.
Sounds complex? Imagine what it was
like covering it.
Writers from various organizations
would swarm the lawyers and litigants
after each court session. They'd gossip
about new developments during recesses.
The case, which reached the Illinois
Supreme Court, gathered the attention of
Time Magazine, the New York Times and
the British Broadcasting Corporation
because it raised questions about the lim
its of altruism and the right to privacy.
When I was trying to relate to another

intern what covering such a high-profile
case was like, he said, "You're lucky
you've never worked criminal courts on
Fridays. You can tell that all the attor
neys just finished watching 'L.A. Law'
the night before. They start trying to get
fancy and all of that."
Each day reminded me that many of
the issues and institutions we cover here
at The Daily don't apply to the real world,
and vice-versa. You don't find Chicago's
Mayor Richard Daley talking about intro
ducing a gender studies requirement, or
the influence of Donald Kennedy's father
on his presidency
Moreover, the way we cover things is
different. Not better or worse. Just differ
ent. To give you an example, when we
cover a speech or some form of breaking
news, we often let writers choose their
own lengths. In professional papers,
that's not even close to the case. You
could put the same effort into a page one
story that you put into a digest item the
day before.
The next time, though, that someone
asks me if there's been a story I couldn't
cover, I'm going to just answer no. Even if
I get nailed by a later question, I'll get the
satisfaction of removing a smirk or two.
