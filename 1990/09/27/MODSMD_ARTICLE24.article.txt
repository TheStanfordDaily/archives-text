## Women blank UCLA in warmup for Santa Clara 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Coach Berhane Andeberhan moved
high-scoring sophomore Julie Foudy
away from the goal, but he couldn't stop
her from scoring and neither could the
UCLA Bruins yesterday at Maloney Field.
Foudy knocked in three goals and
Sarah Rafanelli added two scores to lead
the Cardinal past punchless UCLA, 6-0.
Stanford's official record remains at 7-1
because UCLA is a club team.
Foudy scored twice in the first half as
No. 11 Stanford raced to a 5-0 advantage,

then added a goal in the second half even
though Andeberhan had given her a more
defensive assignment.
"You can only hold back a race horse so
much," said Andeberhan, who utilized
the exhibition and the early lead to play
his full squad.
Stanford dominated possession in the
first half but didn't break the scoring ice
until the 14:57 mark. Foudy bumped in a
cross from Rafanelli in the left corner to
put Stanford ahead for good.
With fullback Heather Mclntyre and
the Stanford defense putting up a near
impenetrable shield, Stanford didn't need

any more goals, but the Cardinal
exploded for four more in an 11-minute
stretch to put the game well out of reach.
For the day, Stanford outshot UCLA 22-4.
"I'm very pleased with our effort,"
Andeberhan said. "We heard a lot about
their game against St. Mary's and knew
we better take them seriously. We showed
a great deal of composure and concentra
tion in the second half which I was glad to
see."
In their previous game on this road
trip, the Bruins lost 4-3 to Division I St.
Mary's after trailing 3-0 at the half. Stan
ford had a tough game with St. Mary's

last week, coming from behind to edge the
Gaels 2-1.
In other games against Stanford oppo
nents, UCLA lost to UC-Santa Barbara 9-
0, and top-ranked Santa Clara 7-0. Last
year the Bruins defeated four Division I
teams and were 18-1-1 on the club level.
Stanford plays the undefeated Broncos
Saturday at 10 a.m. on Maloney Field.
"1 think Santa Clara is better (than
Stanford)," said UCLA coach Paul
Tamasy, who contends Santa Barbara will
be the team to beat in the playoffs.
"Santa Clara is really aggressive and goes
after the ball 100 percent of the time.
They don't have a player like Foudy who
really stands out, but they play well as a
team."
Despite the impressive performance,
Stanford's victory was marred by the
injury of sophomore midfielder Jen
Potok, who crumpled with a knee injury
13 minutes into the second half. Potok
was assisted off the field and taken to the
training room before the game ended, and
a worried Andeberhan said her status
wouldn't be known until an examination
today.
Foudy scored her, and Stanford's, sec
ond goal 21 minutes into the game on an
indirect penalty kick pass from Mclntyre.
Then, two minutes later, Rafanelli flipped
in a one-on-one goal after a beautiful
crossing pass from freshman forward
Anita Koshy.
Then it was Potok's turn as she
launched one into the top of the net after
a lead pass from freshman Glynnis
Roberts, giving Stanford a 4-0 edge.
Rafanelli ended the first half scoring
barrage at 31:25, firing home a pass from
Carolyn Einstein at the right fringe of the
penalty box. Einstein juked two defenders
at midfield, then dumped the ball to a
streaking Rafanelli when the last fullback
had committed.
Play balanced out more in the second
half as Stanford attempted to control the
middle of the field, but Foudy laser
guided her third goal into the corner from
10 yards out, taking an assist from
Roberts.
The second half gave Andeberhan a
chance to display some of Stanford's

'I'm very pleased with
our effort. We heard a
lot about their game
against St. Mary's and
knew we better take
them seriously.'

younger talent, and he was pleased with
the effort. "Nicole Tremain played what
was probably her best game of the season,
and the keepers (Chris Massell and
Wendy Kevan) did an excellent job as
well," he said. „
"I didn't think we played very well,
said UCLA's Tamasy. "We seem to suffer
from an intimidation problem when we
play varsity teams, especially in the first
half."
"Berhane had a lot of the second string
in during the second half, but I thought
we held together a little better. Our skills
just don't match up with Stanford's at
this point."
Tamasy hopes to move his UCLA club
to varsity status next year, and looks for
ward to scholarships. "It looks good at the
moment, but it really comes down to a
money thing. A lot of it rides on our foot
ball team, and they way they are playing
right now, I guess it could be a while."
Card notes
While the Cardinal has been very impressive
in allowing only four goals in the team's first
eight games, Santa Clara has been even better.
The Broncos have given up a total of only one
goal all year.
History was made when the women's poll
came out earlier this week. The Santa Clara men
have been ranked No. 1 all season long after win
ning the national title last year but the women
had never before attained that honor. Santa
Clara also became the first school ever to have its
men's and women's ranked No. 1 at the same
time.
Stanford has not lost a contest at Maloney
Field since the 1988 season.


Tracy Allen — Daily
Sophomore midfielder Klrby Seale is only one of the reasons Stanford dominated UCLA yesterday. After a 6-0 win over the
Bruins, the 11th-ranked Cardinal must prepare to host No. 1 Santa Clara Saturday morning at Maloney Stadium.
