# Statistics 101, or how to lie and get away with it
## 
### 
What a wonderful job I have.
You see, sports journalists have
access to all sorts of information
concerning every Stanford sport. Infor
mation means statistics. Lots of them.
Statistics that can be manipulated to
shed a comforting light on even the dark
est of sports catastrophes. I should know;
I'm a Denver Broncos fan. Guess which
team holds a Super Bowl record for most
kickoff returns in the NFL's premier
game?
Every sports fan knows that it's not
really the final score that counts. It's the
statistics.
That's why we can all take some conso
lation from the current troubles that the
Stanford football team is enduring.
This will comfort you. As every college
football analyst has pointed out, had
Stanford's first two games been a com
bined 14 seconds shorter, the Cardinal
would be 3-0 right now. Bring back the
59-minute, 53-second game.
But as frustrating as the 1-2 start is
this year, consider the first three games of
some of the Cardinal squads of years gone
by. The 1988 and 1989 teams each went

1-2 and finished the seasons 3-6-2 and 3-
8 respectively, but not quite respectably.
Jack Elway's 1987 team started 0-4,
including two home losses to San Jose
State and UCLA, before winning five of
their last seven games. This year's team
may finish just as well, maybe even bet
ter.
Then there's the 1983 season when
the Cardinal finished 1-10 after losing
their first six games.
Ugh.
In fact, in the 10 seasons since 1980,
Stanford is 12-18 overall in its first three
games of each season. When the Cardinal
has opened its season on the road, as it
has in seven of the last 10 seasons includ
ing this year, the team has finished 36-42
overall. That's a .461 winning percent
age, which translates to .. . five wins this
year!
Hmm.
Well, let's look at it this way. When
Stanford has opened at home, which it
did three times in the 1980's, the Cardi
nal has rolled to a record of 8-23-2. Over
all that makes Stanford's record over the

last decade 44-65-2, a .396 winning per
centage.
Ugh.
In fact, Stanford has had only two win
ning seasons in the last 10. In 1986, with
that glorious offense led by John Paye
and Brad Muster that few of us remem
ber, the football team went 8-3 before suc
cumbing to Clemson in the Gator Bowl.
The only previous winning season of the
decade was the 6-5 season of 1980 when
the team lost four of its last six games.
Before this year, Stanford had won 11
games over three years. By comparison,
Colorado, which beat the Cardinal in this
season's opener, won 12 games last year
alone.

These are not exactly the kind of
statistics I had in mind. Let's see what
else there is.
The Cardinal defense gave up 404
yards to UCLA on a day when the offense
shone in gaining 386 yards.
Stanford had only one first down in
the second and third quarters in its loss
to Colorado.
Of the past 24 games, Stanford has lost
eight of them by four points or fewer.
Ugh.
What a miserable job I have.
You see, wherever I look I see numbers
that have haunted Cardinal football for
much longer than the three seasons that
I have followed the team. For this team,
there is no consolation in the numbers.
The elder members of the team
remember the painful losses of the last
three years. In 1987, it was a 49-0 defeat
at home to UCLA. In 1988, it was a 28-25
loss at Washington on a day when Cardi
nal fullback Jon Volpe gained a school
record 220 yards. During the *89 cam
paign, the heartbreak loss was a 27-24
submission to a Utah team that tallied 14
points in the last 6:34 of the game. Only

15,000 fans showed up for that defeat
which dropped the Cardinal to 1-6.
Rodney Peete drove USC to a last-sec
ond 24-20 win in the 1988 season opener.
San Jose State won 40-33 last year on an
uncalled incompletion.
Stanford is not a Columbia or a North
western or a Kansas State. The Cardinal
football team is a bunch of talented and
spirited athletes who play every year
among the toughest of schedules in one of
the most challenging conferences around.
After years of football success, the team
has fallen on hard times over the last
decade.
The team is on the verge of both vic
tory and collapse. The remaining eight
games of this season will determine in
which direction this program is going.
The team can win. The numbers don't
show it. Only by turning this season
around can the Stanford Cardinal
renounce its legacy of heartbreak.
