# Magic accepts a pay cut so Lakers can sign Teagle
## GM Jerry West praises point guard for selflessness 
### 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -
Magic Johnson was credited with
another assist Wednesday, only it
wasn't on the court.
Johnson voluntarily surren
dered part of his salary so the Los
Angeles Lakers could acquire
guard Terry Teagle under the
NBA's salary cap limits, General
Manager Jerry West revealed
Wednesday.
"We didn't have enough money
under the cap to pick up Terry's
contract without Magic giving up
a substantial amount of his own
salary," West said.
Under league rules, no team
can exceed $11.8 million per year
in total player salaries.
Johnson spoke to West about a
month ago and offered to relin
quish part of his salary to get a
first-rate player.
"To make a long story short,
we got something concrete and all
of a sudden this thing came where
we thought we could make a deal
and we took him up on his offer,"
West said.
The amount of money Johnson
gave up was not disclosed, but an
informed source said it was "a
substantial amount, in six fig
ures." The 31-year-old guard
reportedly will earn $3.1 million

'It's about winning.
Of course money
is great, but I play
to win and that's
why I did it.'
— Magic Johnson

next season.
Teagle, a 30-year-old swingman
acquired from the Golden State
Warriors, has two years remain
ing on a contract that will pay him
a reported $600,000 in 1990-1991.
The trade, which was
announced Tuesday, called for the
Lakers to give the Warriors their
first-round draft choice in 1991 in
exchange for Teagle, who aver
aged career bests last season in
scoring (16.1) and rebounding
(4.5).
He is expected to replace
Michael Cooper, the longtime
Laker swingman who left the
team this summer to play in Italy.
In another move related to the
salary cap and the acquisition of

Teagle, the Lakers traded center
Mark McNamara to the San Anto
nio Spurs on Tuesday for undis
closed considerations.
Johnson, who was named MVP
for the third time last season, said
he was willing to give up a sub
stantial sum of his salary to
strengthen his team.
"It's about winning. Of course
money is great, but I play to win
and that's why I did it," Johnson
said in a statement.
He is currently in Spain on a
promotional tour for a company.
"It is another incredible play in
a long line of incredible plays by
Magic Johnson in the pursuit of
victory," Lakers owner Jerry Buss
said. "In my mind, he's the best
team player ever."
The Lakers, who won the NBA
championship five times in the
1980s, were eliminated by the
Phoenix Suns in the Western Con
ference semifinals last season.
Although Johnson becomes the
first player to be taken up on such
an offer, Michael Jordan of the
Chicago Bulls earlier said he
would give up part of his salary so
his team could acquire Walter
Davis. Davis, however, re-signed
with Denver.
