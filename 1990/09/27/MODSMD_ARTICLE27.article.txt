# Cardinal netters start 1990 as they ended '89: on top
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Beginning the new year
much as they ended the old year,
the Cardinal men's and
women's tennis teams are
clearly the best in the nation.
The preseason Volvo Tennis
collegiate computer rankings
were released yesterday, and not
only is Stanford ranked No. 1 on
both the men's and women's
side, but the Cardinal also lays
claim to the top singles player
and doubles team for each gen
der.
Under coach Dick Gould, the
Wilson Coach of the Decade for
the '80s, the Cardinal men have
won three consecutive NCAA
titles and four of the last five.
Despite the graduation of Jeff
Cathrall and the defection to
professional ranks by Alexis
Hombrecher, Stanford was a
unanimous choice as the presea
son No. 1 team.
The Cardinal is followed by
UCLA, Tennessee, USC and
Georgia. California, South Car
olina, Miami, Texas Christian
and Texas round out the top 10.
Individually, Stanford sopho
more Jonathan Stark is the
nation's top player in the pre
season poll. USC's Byron Black,

Miami's Conny Falk, the Uni
versity of San Diego'B Jose-Luis
Noriega and A 1 Parker of Geor
gia round out the top five.
Alex O'Brien, a junior, is
ranked seventh and sophomore
Jared Palmer also was ranked in
the preseason, coming in at No.
12. Chris Cocotos, one of only
five freshmen in the top 50, is
ranked 46th to start the year.
In doubles, the team of Stark
and Palmer is occupying the top
spot. O'Brien and Jason Yee,
who only played third doubles
for the powerful Stanford squad
last year but won the Pacific 10
Conference doubles title, are
ranked second nationally.
On the women's side, the
only real news is that Stanford
was not the unanimous No. 1.
Florida, last year's runner-up,
split one first-place vote with
the Cardinal and is ranked sec
ond in the preseason. Following
the Cardinal and the Gators are
UCLA, Georgia, California,
Texas, Arizona State, Oklahoma
State, Duke and USC.
With Frank Brennan, the
Wilson Coach of the Decade on
the women's side, at the helm,
Stanford has won five consecu
tive titles. But after Meredith
McGrath turned pro and Lisa

Green graduated, the Cardinal
juggernaut appears almost vin
cible to some observers.
Which is not to say the Cardi
nal isn't still loaded. Individu
ally, junior Debbie Graham, the
1990 NCAA singles champ, and
senior Sandra Birch, the 1989
NCAA singles champ, are
ranked first and second, respec
tively. Florida Gators Nicole
Arendt and Andrea Farley sand
wich USC's Trisha Laux to com
plete the top five.
Senior Teri Whitlinger, who
was a member of the NCAA
champion doubles tandem last
year, comes in at seventh and
freshman Laxmi Poruri ranks
11th.
On the doubles side, Birch
and Graham, who have played
in the last two NCAA doubles
finals, are the preseason No. 1.
Whitlinger and Poruri are also
in the rankings, placing sixth.
The Cardinal women will
have a chance to do something
never before done this season:
win an NCAA title at home. The
NCAA championships will be
played in the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, and on other campus
courts, during the middle of
May.
