Accepting the Crafoord Prize — conserva
tionists' equivalent of a Nobel Prize — Biology
Professor Paul Ehrlich yesterday announced
the initiation of a $3 million fund-raising drive
for Stanford's Center for Conservation Biology.
Best known for writing "The Population
Bomb" in 1968 and co-writing "The Population
Explosion" with his wife Anne this year,
Ehrlich received the $120,000 prize for his
research in population genetics.
Ehrlich, who is director of the center, said he
will contribute $100,000 of his prize money to
the fund-raising effort, and that an unnamed
donor has also given one million dollars.
The money will support the center's activi
ties, which include environmental research and
policy recommendations for the preservation of
biological diversity
After announcing the winners in February,
the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences pre
sented Ehrlich and Harvard Professor Edward
Wilson with gold medals during ceremonies in
Stockholm yesterday.
Earlier this year, Ehrlich also received a
prestigious five-year, $345,000 Mac Arthur fel
lowship, also known as a "genius grant."
Along with donations to the center, Ehrlich
plans to use his prize money to "add a critical
piece" to Uraguai Provincial
Park, a tropical rain forest in
Argentina. Purchasing this land
will protect it from further devel
opment or destruction.
Ehrlich warned the academy
that it will take careful planning
and urgent measures for human
ity to preserve "both biodiversity

and civilization," and suggested
that "too many members of the
scientific community .. . are rela
tively uninterested in doing their
share to stem the tide of biological
destruction."
When he first found out about
the Mac Arthur grant, Ehrlich
said he was both "flabbergasted
and delighted."
"When you spend as much
time raising money as I do, it's
great to have some dropped in
your lap," he said.
