# Bridge replaces phones
## University system too costly for counseling center 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
In an effort to save $6,000 annually, and
stay in business, the Bridge has just
rewired its internal phone system.
High costs for University phone service
prompted the organization to purchase its
own wiring and equipment this summer,
said live-in peer counselor Dan Rosenberg,
a senior.
The Bridge came under the auspices of
the University phone system in 1987 and
since then, Rosenberg said, telephone costs
have shot up from less than $1,000 to
$8,000 a year.
The Bridge, a 24-hour peer counseling
service, handles a huge flow of telephone
traffic everyday. During this summer
alone, counselors spent 5,225 minutes on
the phone, Rosenberg said.
Because of the volume of calls and the
nature of its service, Rosenberg said the
Bridge needs "fancy" phones.
The organization owns eight $600 elec
tronic multiline telephones, all bought
from the University. These phones, which
include call forwarding and hold features,
cost the Bridge a monthly maintenance fee
of $350 each.
And they break quite often, Rosenberg
said.
In addition, the Bridge is charged a
monthly fee for line service by the Univer
sity. The lowest grade of this service costs
$25 a month, three times Pacific Bell's
rate, Rosenberg said. The University offers
several grades of service, with different fea
tures, for business and academic depart
ments. However, there is only one grade of
residential phone lines, and its only feature
is call waiting.
Despite its services, the Bridge was
unable to get a discount from the Univer
sity. Because the federal gov ;j irnent funds
research on campus — and part of the cost
goes to phone use — it has a contract with
the University requiring that Stanford's
businesses and academic departments be
charged the same phone rates.
Over the summer, the Bridge invested in

a $3,000 Panasonic key switch, new wiring
and other phone equipment. Rosenberg
said the key switch makes possible all the
new features, and as many lines can be
installed as needed without a monthly fee
for each one. The Bridge now has 16 lines,
twice as many as before.
The Bridge consulted David Smith, an
analyst from Communication Services,
before rewiring its internal phone system.
Every Stanford department has the option
of installing equipment that is compatible
to the University dial tone, Smith said.
He added that whether rewiring a sys
tem will save money depends on the config
uration of the office. If only one line is
needed, the University system will be
cheaper, he said.
Jan Thomson, director of Communica
tion Services, said she will be "delighted" to
work with any department looking to
reduce its communication costs. However,
she added that cabling and wiring is a Uni
versity resource, and the work is best done
by her department's technicians.
Although the Bridge still gets a dial tone
from the University and has to pay for
incoming phone lines, all equipment past
the key switch belongs to the organization.
Maintenance costs should be minimal,
Rosenberg said.
He said the Bridge will save $1,000 to
$2,000 this year because capital purchases
have already been made. Starting next
year, savings will reach $6,000, Rosenberg
predicted.
The new wiring at the Bridge is actually
the same as the University wiring, but it
was installed as "a political statement,"
Rosenberg said.
"We're getting as little phone service
(from the University) as possible," he
added.
Thomson acknowledged that the Bridge
achieved "a fairly good solution ... and
apparently did a very good job." However,
one problem she foresees is if the Bridge
decides to move, the new tenants of 640
Campus Drive may not need the multiline
system that the organization currently
employs.
