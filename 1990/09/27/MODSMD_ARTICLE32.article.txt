## Tournee features best of 'straight' animation

#THE STANFORD DAILY'/S ENTERTAINING

If you go into the 22nd annual International Tournee of Anima
tion expecting to see Bart Simpson or a few exploding heads, you
may be disappointed. This sort of "art" wouldn't mesh well with the
likes of Bart. But don't have a cow, man.
The new collection offers a few different varieties of humor, as
well as more serious commentaries on the dark side of human
nature. But unless you're prepared for this mixed and difficult diet,
the Tournee will be disappointing, perhaps burdensome, to watch.
It's long — about two hours — because several of the 18 short
films exceed the length that their plots can support.
Length is a drawback in this show. Although it's understandable,
considering the time-consuming process of animation, such indul
gence by the artists rarely pays off.
"Sand Dance" and "Kakania," are such examples of technical wiz
ardry in search of a plot.
Another short, "Balance," made by German twins
Christoff and Wolfgand Lauenstein is a brilliantly subtle
demonstration of the evil of greed. Yet it, too, would have
been more powerful if it were two minutes shorter.
In "Balance," five mannequins struggle to maintain their footing
on a floating platform, and all but one eventually slip into the mists
after a fight over a music box that was reeled up to the platform from
below.
It did, however, win an Academy Award in 1989. Clearly, not
everyone has found this one too long.

Another film, "Vykrutasy (The Coiling Prankster)," depicts a
wire figure so obsessed with his property that he goes insane. This
too would have been better had a few minutes been lefl in the cellu
loid graveyard. It was poignantly executed, though.
The effectiveness of brevity is best demonstrated by a three-part
series of colored-pencil comedy by Bill Plympton. "Human Crash
Tests," "Car Alarm" and"The Mob — the Early Days" equals the
humor of past "Plymptoon" classics like "Twenty Five
Ways to Quit Smoking" and "How to Kiss."
Although it was definitely an advantage for the
Plymptoons to appear in three segments, part of
the series' effectiveness comes from the fact that
no segment exceeds a minute and a half.
Plympton's shimmering colored-pencil
drawing style also brings his bizarre sense of
humor to Life. Although his artistic style may
not be as dramatic as "Pictures from Mem
ory," a lengthy imagery blitz chronicling the
tumult in Eastern Europe during 1940 to
1960, his ability to tell a story in moments
stands out. *
Another film that stands out -r
but for different reasons — is "Gisele
Kerozene," a bizarre French creation
of Jan Kounen. I haven't seen any
thing as violent or offensive since
"A Clockwork Orange." This live
action, post-punk fantasy depicts
freaky witches chasing each
other through a futuristic office
park. If you like ax fights, fric
tion amputations and real
blood, you will like this film.
And if you appreciate ani
mation at all, you will like this
Tournee. Despite occasional
problems witn length, the
creativity, vision and labor
that makes up this collection is
a remarkable testimony to the
power and the possibilities of
animation.
And it's a nice change
from the Simpsons.
