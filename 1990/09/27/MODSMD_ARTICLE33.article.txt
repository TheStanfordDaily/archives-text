# Grads debut play in City
## 
### Kelly Parsons 
David Schmelzer and John McDonough
are two Stanford grads who have proven
definitively that there is indeed life beyond
the Farm. Indeed, all the world's a stage for
this duo, who first met as freshmen when
they competed for the director's chair in a
Branner Hall production of "Grease."
Tbn years later, the pair has burst into the
world of professional theater with "Election
Day/' a new comedy currently playing at the
Zephyr II Theatre in San Francisco.
"Election Day" relates the story of Walter
(Ken Sonkin), a young, down-on-his-luck
lawyer, who convinces an idealistic philoso
phy professor (Dana Lynne Smith) to
descend from her ivory tower and run for
mayor of their small Southern California
town. During the wild campaign that
ensues, the two share a series of adventures
that teach them about politics, morality and
love.

The play has been generally well-received
throughout critical and theatrical circles.
The San Francisco Weekly called "Election
Day" a "bright and well-crafted comedy,"
while the San Francisco Chronicle referred to
it as "keenly written and ingeniously
staged."
Playwright Schmelzer offers a modest
analysis of the play's critical success: "For
the most part, I think people have really
enjoyed it,"he said in a recent interview. "We
are really lucky in that we have gotten
enough good reviews that I believe we can
attribute the bad ones to an issue of taste."
Schmelzer's former classmate Mc-
Donough, after gaining directing experience
with a number of community productions,
has stepped into the director's spot.
Like McDonough, Schmelzer graduated
from the Farm in 1984 with a B.A. in
English. He then pursued a number of differ-
cnt activities, including working
with children from low-income
families in East Palo Alto, and
receiving a masters degree in theol
ogy. Yet he says he always "wanted
to give play writing a shot."
After penning two plays that did
not maice it into production,
Schmelzer hit pay dirt with "Elec
tion Day." Despite the play's
ostensibly light atmosphere,
Schmelzer describes its humor as
"dark and dense," adding that he is
"writing about issues of personal
courage."
Schmelzer describes the play's
main theme as a "running debate"
over a political candidate's choice
between following or disregarding
personal concepts of justice in
order to appease the masses, with
their "varied backgrounds and
points of view."
As for passing on professional
advice to aspiring playwrights at
Stanford, Schmelzer's message is
simple.
"Know what you're getting
into/' he advises. "If you can think
about anything else that you
would ratner do with your life,
then do that."
"It's difficult to make a living at
writing. You've really got to have a
lot of perserverance, a sense that
you're ready to take any suffering
that comes your way. I think
that's proven true for me."
