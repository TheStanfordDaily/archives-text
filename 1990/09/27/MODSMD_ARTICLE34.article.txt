SAN FRANCISCO — The celebration
of Stanford's centennial year officially
begins this Sunday but for a group of
twenty-seven Stanford artists and the trio
of 1990 graduates who brought them
together, the celebration has been going
on all month.
The exhibition, entitled "A Stanford
Perspective/' runs through Saturday at
the Rococo Gallery in San Francisco.
The show is a reunion of sorts in that it
features the works of faculty members,
graduates and current graduate students
in Stanford's Art Department. On dis
play is a diverse assortment of works,
from oils on canvas to acrylics on paper,
from sculptures in steel and in wood to a
startling, humongous one in rubber.
The exhibition is indeed an eclectic
array, but the underlying connection is
Stanford. The show celebrates the talent
that sparked here on the Farm.
"A Stanford Perspective" is the ambi
tious endeavor of three 1990 graduates,
Christine Paige, Ellen Waggoner and John
Derryberry. Their idea for this exhibition
stemmed from a show presented three
years ago in New York City by a group of
east coast alumni.
Paige, Waggoner and Derryberry
sensedthe University's Centennial Cele
bration was a fitting time for a celebra
tion of Stanford artists in the Bay Area.
Paige, an Art History graduate cur
rently writing her honors thesis, saw the
need to promote Stanford artists beyond
the boundaries of Stanford itself.
"I've seen a lot of (graduate student
exhibitions] on campus, but then the
artists leave and you never hear from
them," Paige says. "You never see show

ings from a Stanford group at large."
The desire to bring together a group of
Stanford artists in one exhibition led
Paige to begin the search for artists along
with her friends, Waggoner and Derry
berry.
The response was overwhelming.
With one exception, all the artists were
enthusiastic about being part of the exhi
bition. Paige found it "amazing that
everyone was so receptive to the idea —
not just the artists, but the whole art
community. Everyone was very positive.
Hardly anybody turned us down."
Waggoner, a honors graduate in Eco
nomics, says the incredible response to
the idea is attributable to the fact that "all
of the artists feel that Stanford was a
strong influence on their development."
Even with the luxury of enthusiastic
support, there was a lot of legwork to do.
Paige, Waggoner and Derryberry con
tacted the 27 artists at their studios and

found themselves traveling all over the
greater Bay Area from Bolinas to Santa
Cruz, and even to Los Angeles, to recruit
them.
Paige recalls that it was "a real trick"
getting around to visit all the artists.
Derryberry calls this trick a "real treat
... meeting the artists in their studios —
in their own environments," as opposed
to the sterile confines of a gallery or
museum.

major currently writing his honors the
sis, Derryberry says tne "biggest chal
lenge" was organizing the works in a way
"that would represent each artist while
still being coherent. And [he thinks theyl
did that."
And so do the artists. Abstract painter

connection visually" between the
works. He suggests that the teach
ers were the forces that "created
the influences and the ties" to a
Stanford style.
Waggoner says one of the aims
of "A Stanford Perspective" was to
"mix master with student to
emphasize the connection
between the two, and to show how
the student has taken the master's
impetus in his own direction."

are looking into the possibility of
talcing the show to New York or
Los Angeles. Paige says "everyone
has been so cooperative that it
makes [me] want to go on with it
and do more things." Waggoner
says New York looks promising
and adds "it was so exciting when
it finally came together, [I] would
hate to stop here."
"A Stanford Perspective" runs
through Saturday at the Rococo
Gallery, 165 Tenth Street (off Mis
sion) in San Francisco. Call 552-
