# HIP HOT & HAPPENING
## 
### 
Rap, blues, rock in one
It's Jimi Hendrix, 3rd Bass, Fishbone and Living Colour all in
one. It's Urban Dance Squad, a Dutch band with no ties to Milli
Vanilli.
The London Times described the band's debut Arista Records
album as "an extraordinary rock, hip-hop collective buoyed by a
wash of Jimi Hendrix at one extreme and authentically bluesy slide
licks at the other." The second single off "Mental Floss for the
Globe" — "Deeper Shade of Soul" — is currently in regular MTV
rotation after college radio and alternative clubs gave "No Kid"
heavy airplay.
So why is this important? Because Rudeboy Remington and the
squad will will bring their lively show to the DNA Lounge in San
Francisco Saturday. Tickets are $7 apiece, and the show begins at 9
p.m. Call 626-1409 for ticket info.
No sand in the Stadium?
Looking for something a little tamer than Urban Dance Squad?
Stanford Stadium's the place to be.
After the annual "South Bay Showdown" between the gridiron
squads of San Jose State and Stanford, the Athletic Department has
arranged for a post-game concert by the Beach Boys.
Sure, they're a group of 40-plus guys who sing about high school,
but they're here and they're a reason to stay through the second half
of the "South Bay Blowout." And it doesn't even cost more than
your admission to the game. Call 723-1021 for game ticket infor
mation.
