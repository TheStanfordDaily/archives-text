# Fall TV schedule aims for new Peaks
## 
### 
With all the special sneak
previews a few weeks back, it's
been harder than usual to peg
the exact start time of the new
fall television season. Suffice it
to say if a show hasn't pre
miered yet for the '90-91 cam
paign, it will shortly.
The four networks — Fox
will now be coming into your
living room nearly every night
(Goa save us all) — will be
rolling out a whole host of new
shows, hoping each is the next
big hit. Tbday's version of the
Holy Grail is a "TVin Peaks"
with ratings.
Despite all the hoopla gener
ated by "Peaks" in its brief late
season run, ABC nearly scuttled
the nattily-attired show because
few tuned to it. This reviewer
caught a couple of episodes,
couldn't figure out what was
going on and doesn't think
doughnuts are very good for
you, either.
"Peaks" will be back this
Sunday at 9 p.m. and you will
eventually find out who killed
Laura Palmer — or indeed if she
is dead at all.
Elsewhere on the dial, the big
news is music, ratings show
downs, environmentalism and
the ever-declining percentage of
viewers the networks can lay
claim to.
Thursday nights at 8, "The
Cosby Show" will square off
with "The Simpson's" in the
hottest battle for Nielsen
supremacy. In the same time
slot, CBS will attempt to score
with superhero magic in the
form of "The Flash." Fans of the
red-clad running man had bet
ter catch the first episode — it
could easily be the last.
"Hull High" (Sunday, 7 p.m.,
NBC) is a musical
comedy/drama of the "Fame"
genre that has a chance to
become a hit. Incidentally, the
show is already drawing wire for
its portayal of one of the teach
ers as a sex object.
NBC is also looking to score

with "Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"
the story of a poor black kid
from Philadelphia who moves
in with well-to-do relatives in
an upscale Los Angeles suburb.
If you're looking for quality,
however, give "Gabriel's Fire"
(Thursday 9 p.m.) a shot on
ABC. That heavyweight (in
more ways than one) James Earl
Jones is bringing his consider
able talents to prime time is
news in itself.
Always looking to cash in on
society's hot-button issues, TV
is catching on to the fact that
we're destroying our planet at
an alarming pace. Tfed TUrner is
bringing the animated "Captain
Planet and the Planeteers" to
TBS.
"E.A.R.T.H, Force" is CBS'
bid on the environmental front.
The premiere (Saturday, 9 p.m.)
has the team, led by Gil Gerard,
attempting to prove that a boy's
illness was caused by toxic
waste.
"Uncle Buck," "Parenthood"
and "Ferris Bueller" all are
based on the movies of the same
names. Usually, it's a bad for
mula. "Parenthood," with Ed
Begley Jr. in the Steve Martin
role may survive, however.
To me, the most eagerly
awaited event of the new season
is Saturday's season premiere of
"Star TVek: The Next Genera
tion" (Channel 44). The fate of
planet earth and Captain Picard
will be determined in a two
hour double dip.
SIMPSON'S PREVIEW: This
week is a repeat of the episode
when Bart and Lisa see their
babysitter of on "America's
Most Armed and Dangerous."
Fox is promising "dozens of new
episodes" beginning next week.
TWIN PEAKS UPDATE: Last
season's cliffhanger left us won
dering whether Cooper would
survive the untimely gunshot
wound he received. He does.
