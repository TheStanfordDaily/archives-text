# Festival highlights best in Bay Area dance
## 
### Leah Edwards 
This weekend's inaugural season of the San
Francisco Dance Festival offers an unprece
dented opportunity to glimpse the wealth of
dance being produced in the Bay Area.
With over 300 dance companies and 500
choreographers in the Bay Area, even the most
avid dance fans cannot keep up with all of the
accomplishments and innovations in the local
dance scene. However, the next three evenings
should offer the public a glimpse of the wiae
range of forms, ideas and backgrounds which
are on the cutting edge of Bay Area dance.
For the past six years, Dance Bay Area — a
local arts service organization — has been pre
senting the Isadora Duncan Awards (better
known as the Izzies). Each year, the annual
awards ceremony publicly recognizes dancers,
choreographers, designers, composers and man
agement professionals for exceptional achieve
ment, simultaneously showcasing some of the
highly recognized work.
Beginning this year, the Izzies are just one
part of a dance festival that will celebrate the
accomplishments of an even broader spectrum
of the dance community.
Susan Chung, director of development for
Dance Bay Area, explained that the idea for the
Dance Festival came from the community.
"The number and variety of dance forms in the
Bay Area means there isn't a single dance com
munity or single standard of judgment, but
there was somewhat of a consensus on having a
festival which represents a diversity of aesthet
ics," said Chung, a '88 Stanford graduate.
Ninety-four choreographers auditioned their

works, and 18 were selected based on originality
by a panel of choreographers, dance writers and
presenters. Friday evening's program shows the
range of experience represented in the festival
— from "Dust to Dust" by Tandy Beal, whose
works have been commissioned by dance com
panies around the world, to "The TVain" Jen
nifer Kilfoil's master's thesis in Choreography
and Performance at Mills College.
Their works join those of Karl Shaffer, Debo
rah Slater and Janice Dulak and are billed as
"Five From the Heart" — taking a contemporary
look at timeless emotions.
Saturday's program, described as "Seven on
the Edge," gives some sense of the variety of
forms contemporary dance is taking — from
works by Tferry Sendgraff (originator of Motivity,
a low-flying trapeze dance form) and Rick Dar
nell (known for his work with contact improv.)
to works by Veera Wibaux, who along with her
partner Bert Houle has presented their mime
pieces throughout the world, and Janice Yee
Hanzel's clogging.
Sunday's program highlights issues con
fronting the dance world — most notably mul
ticulturalism. The program includes Cheryl
Koehler's "Stories From the Land," based on a
Hopi legend; Koichi Tamano's Butoh dance — a
modern dance form originated in Japan,- and
Evelyn Thomas's joyfully defiant response to
South Africa's apartheid.
If the Festival is as enjoyable and polished as
this year's Izzies ceremony TUesday evening,
this weekend and the annual festivals to follow
will be a welcome addition to the Bay Area's
dance offerings. Being in the Izzies audience, it
was easy to sense the pride of the members of

San Francisco Dance Festival

the Bay Area dance community as they recog
nized their own accomplishment.
"The Izzies were created to give us all an
opportunity to celebrate the many achieve
ments of the marvelous and diverse community
in the Bay Area," explained Dance Bay Area
Executive Director Lillian Goldthwaite in her
welcoming speech.
The announcements of the Izzies winners
were interspersed with excerpts of ballet, mod
ern and Chinese dance, as well as the antics of
hosts Deborah Slater and Bob Martin.
