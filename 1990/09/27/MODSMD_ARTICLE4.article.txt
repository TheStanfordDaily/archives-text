# Students can now earn honors for morality

A new program offered by the Pro
gram in Ethics in Society will allow
students to earn an honors degree for
studying issues of morality.
The program was developed last
year and approved by the Faculty Sen
ate in May, according to Philosophy
Prof. Rachel Cohon. To earn the hon
ors degree, students must take two
courses in philosophy — Introduction
to Moral Theory and Introduction to
Political Philosophy — and an ethics
course, Ethics in International Rela

tions. In addition, students must com
plete one elective course in a related
issue, take the honors seminar on
Ethics in Society and write an honors
thesis in their senior year.
"I am very pleased this program is
getting off the ground," Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow said. Given the long tradition of
student interest in public service and
public policy, the new honors degree is
appropriate, he added.
The program aims to bring together
research interests and applied ethics,
according to Partha Dasgupta, profes
sor of economics and philosophy. Many

students discuss morality informally at
dinner or in the dorms, but it offers
students "a way to formalize the inter
est," he said.
Dasgupta said it might examine
such questions as what type of political
leaders are best for the United States,
or issues such as fetal rights or the
arguments for or against being a vege
tarian.
This honors degree has a similar
structure to other honors programs
offered at Stanford. Generally, stu
dents will apply in the spring of their
sophomore year, Dasgupta said, adding
that since it is new, applications will be

accepted through Nov. 16 this year.
About 12 students will be admitted
this year, Dasgupta said. However, he
said he hopes it will appeal to a larger
community in future years.
Dasgupta, who heads the new pro
gram, taught a seminar for graduate
students on applied ethics last year.
Originally from India, he received his
bachelor's degree from the University
of Delhi and later studied at the Uni
versity of Cambridge.
Dasgupta is one of several faculty
members hired by the University to
help teach courses that will be a part of
the program, Wasow said.
