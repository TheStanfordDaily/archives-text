# Louisiana Territory is Roaring '20s fun
## 
### Robert Abrams Liz Treynor 
If you're looking for a gem, you won't have to go
farther than Louisiana Territory. And good food is
only one facet that makes this restaurant priceless.
Tastefully decorated with the festive glitter of the
'20s, complete with feathery stars gracing the ceiling
and beads scattered about the tables, Louisiana Terri
tory has the sense of an ever-raging party. Even the
wait staff seems to be having fun.
The restaurant is spacious, although it is divided
into several connected rooms, lending an intimate
charm to the place. A roving three-man band plays
down-home jazz. Over the course of the evening the
music seems to fade in and out — an excellent effect.
As charming as the atmosphere is, the food is still
the best part at Louisiana Territory.
Our meal began with pepper- and onion-studded
cornbread muffins in a basket, accompanied by
refreshing light honey and butter. If you didn't like
things in your bread when you were a child, you might
want to avoid these muffins.
For appetizers, we moved on to a Seafood Bisque
and spicy sausage Jambalaya and rice. The Jambalaya
gives a nice kick in the back of the throat, a good feel
ing if you are from the "if it isn't hot I can't taste it"
school. You can detect the marriage of Southern Cre
ole cooking and Mexican cuisine in this dish.
The creamy, orange Seafood Bisque is nicely sea
soned, although too rich to finish. This is not a soup
to eat if you have a heart condition.
A crisp green salad sprinkled with carrot slivers fol
lowed, smothered in a nice, but overabundant honey
mustard dressing. Althouth the dressing was a
refreshing change of pace, you will be better off to
request a lighter portion.
Special blackened catfish and chicken and ham
proved to be good entree choices. This fish comes

served in a creamy sauce, reminiscent of the Bisque,
though less fatty. Little shrimps grace the top of the
lightly charred catfish, which has a nice, fishy taste.
Best of all, the fish is boneless without feeling like a
fillet.
The ham and chicken, though decent, is a little
bland after the spicy fare of the appetizers. The cat
fish may prove ultimately to be the better entree
choice.
Both entrees come served with rice, steamed car
rots, and a sort of nondescript green broccoli puree.
For dessert, a piece of Sweet Potato Pecan Pie
proved rich enough for two. Similar to regular pecan
pie, this pecan-laden concoction is less sweet than the
standard recipe. A bed of chantilly cream underneath
makes up for this, though.
Even someone with a large appetite will sigh with
satisfaction after eating the generous portions at
Louisiana Tbrritory.
Indeed, the only serious flaw with Louisiana Tbrri
tory is their less-than-elegant bathrooms that are
tired, tawdry, and not unlike the kind you find at a gas
station.
All in all though, Louisiana Tbrritory is a four
crawdaddy experience. And a little scrubbing in the
bathrooms would net them five.
