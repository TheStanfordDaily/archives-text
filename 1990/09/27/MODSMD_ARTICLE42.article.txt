Hardboiled
Frank Miller

Frank Miller; creator of the comic book standard
"The Dark Knight Returns," was hoping for a good
summer this year.
Miller had planned to break into the movie busi
ness with a bang after writing the screenplay for
"Robocop II," a sequel that
looked like a sure winner: Sur
prisingly, however, "Robocop II"
flopped. And the big action
movie of the summer was "Tbtal
Recall," a story that involves a
man whose memory is erased.
Enter "Hard Boiled," a four
issue comic book series from
Dark Horse Comics, the indus
try's largest independent comic
company. With "Hard Boiled,"
Miller returns to his familiar >
medium and scripts a story . 112
to the artwork of Geof Dar- I
row. But even more familiar is
the plot of the series: a tax-collec
tor cyborg has his mind repro-

grammed, awakening in a different profession.
Coincidence?
Perhaps, lb Miller's credit, "Hard Boiled" was
initially unveiled with a July release date. Advance
copies of the first issue were the talk of the industry
by late spring, as "Rolling Stone" described the
work as "intricate, kinetic and thoroughly outra

geous." But Dark Horse Comics, propelled by
incredible sales of their other titles, "Aliens vs.
Predator" and "Tferminator," saw no need to push
the creative duo's talents. And last week, "Hard
Boiled" was finally released.
Like "Tbtal Recall," "Hard Boiled" is quite
explicit, riddled with scenes of violence and sex. In
the opening scene alone, the main character is cov
ered with blood and broken glass
and wrapped in barbed wire while
his clothes burn. Miller's passion
for violence is evident throughout
his works, and "Hard Boiled"
continues the tradition.
But Geof Darrow's
incredibly detailed panels merit a
second glance, even for the weak
at heart. Full-page and two-page
panels contain meticulous detail.
In one landscape scene, Darrow
includes a leaky portable air con
ditioner and a flagpole wire.
Claude Legris' brilliant colors
jump from the pages. Often, the
artwork is strong enough to stand
without the sparsely-placed dia-

logue. The artwork clearly outshines the relatively
boring storyline of the prologue.
Miller may have had trouble on the big screen,
but "Hard Boiled" proves that he can still deliver
blockbuster comic books. Each issue is $4.95, and
the series is planning to end early next year.
