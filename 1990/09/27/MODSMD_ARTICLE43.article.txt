Bob Geldof
Vegetarians of Love

When Bob Geldof's last
album was released four years
ago, I was still in the throes of
admiration for his organization
of Live Aid. Not only did he origi
nate the idea of artists donating
their talents for a cause, but
Geldof also forsook himself in
organizing the international
event.
That made it easy to ignore
the inconsistencies in his first
solo album. With a disparate
bunch of songs that jumped all
over the musical map, the former
Boomtown Rat seemed lost and
confused — a theory confirmed
by his biography released shortly
after the album.
"Vegetarians" shows that
Geldof is still confused, but he's
learned how to deal with it.

Rather than ignore his wandering
emotions and try to create a pop
oriented album, Geldof builds on
his confusion with a collection of
12 honest songs that have as
much heart as Geldof has left.
"The Great Song of Indiffer
ence" highlights the carelessness
of a man who performed one of
the 1980's greatest acts of caring.
Listing all the items that he
doesn't care about, connected by
a chorus of "Na na na na na na,"
the ironic poke at national
leaders ilso seems to belie an
occasional indifference on
Geldof's part.
Geldof's existential tenden
cies come through on the inter
estingly titled "Thinking Voyager
2 Type Things" — a song about
life on other planets, the size of
the universe and whatever other
thoughts the satellite inspired.
Here's Geldof's take on the

'Vegetarians' shows
that Geldof is still
confused.

exploration: "Yes stretch out your
hands into infinity you human
things/ Past blind moons and ice
cream worlds/ You hurl your
metal ball of dull intelligence."
Musically, "Vegetarians" is a
consistent blend of traditional
folk and pop with an Irish influ
ence. Besides the jig section on
"Great Song of Indifference,"
there's plenty of acoustic guitar,
piano, violin, viola, ukelele.
lb say that Geldof is a happy
man would probably be stretch
ing the truth. But "Vegetarians"
shows that he's at least found a
way to live. B+
