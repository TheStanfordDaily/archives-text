INXS
X
It's been a long, hard road for
INXS.
But with "Kick," the Australian
band's last album, it looked like
Michael Hutchence and crew had
finally achieved commercial super
stardom. "Kick" was immensely
successful partially because it was
so well-rounded; the album proved
the band could play more than just
guitar-heavy rock.
Sprinkled between the riffs of
"Need You Tbnight" and "Calling
All Nations" were ballads like
"Never Tfear Us Apart" and dance
tracks like "New Sensation." The
band's expansion into other genres
was a far step from "Original Sin"
and "What You Need."
"X," the band's newest album,
marks another milestone in the
band's history. The album's title
comes from tne Australian group's
10th anniversary. And "X" proves

that INXS is continuing to grow
and experiment with new styles of
music.
But frankly, "X" lacks the spark
of their last album. Sure, it's easy
to get swept away by their fir3t
release, "Suicide Blonde." Amaz
ingly, Andrew Farriss' manic har
monica is so infectious that it over
shadows the song's gaping holes.
As usual, Hutchence slurs over
most of his vocals. And even more
unsurprising is that the vocals
themselves lack any depth or
meaning. But the beat ends up pre
vailing over the droning chorus,
"You want to make her/Suiciue
blonde/love devastation/Suicide
blonde."
On some tracks, the band builds
a steady crescendo, but then for
gets where it's going. The climax of
the choruses of "Disappear" and
"Lately" are wasted by abrupt
returns to other verses. Some
times, the results are unfortunate;
"Hear That Sound" culminates

with such a poorly rhymed chorus
that it's almost laughable.
Although their lyrics discuss
insightful topics, the band often
offers only a glimpse of depth. In
"The Stairs," INXS addresses
mankind's development as one
ascends through life. "Climbing as
we fall/We dare to hold on to our
fate/And steal away our destiny/lb
catch ourselves with quiet grace."
In "Who Pays The Price," the
band criticizes the "disposable"
generation of the last decade.
But on the whole, "X" ?s quite
lacking. There are no ballads,- the
slowest song is "By My Side,"
which sacrifices sentimentality for
a blaring chorus. And some tracks,
like "Know the Difference" and
"Bitter Tears," are just plain
cacophonous.
Hopefully, INXS will continue
to grow past its 10th anniversary.
"X" would be an unjust place to
mark their spot in rock history. B
