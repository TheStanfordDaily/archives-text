Jesus of Montreal
Lothalre Bluteau, Gllles Pelletler
It may have been a result of my lack
of a religious upbringing, but seeing the
title of this film didn't do much for me.
Actually, seeing the coming attraction
clips of the movie didn't do much for
me either
I didn't think it would be interesting.
Or original. Or humorous. Or touching.
And I certainly didn't think it would be
one of the best movies I've seen all year.
But, for various reasons, I went to
see it. And it was all of those things and
more.
"Jesus" is a Canadian film (as the

title suggests) written and directed by
Denys Arcand. It is the wonderfully
well-written story of an actor, Daniel
(Lothaire Bluteau), who is asked to
"modernize" a play of the Gospel
according to Mark.
The play is an annual tradition at a
local church; the man who hired Daniel
is Father Leclerc (Gilles Pelletier). And
the way the script is rewritten does not
please nim or his superiors.
While the plot focuses on the hiring
of the characters, the revision of the
play and the consequences that ensue,
there is much more to the movie. With
out preaching or dictating changes,
"Jesus" points out much that is absurd

— the inequities and inconsistencies in
religion, advertising and acting, just to
name a few.
Arcand, in an interview, said he
wanted to make a movie of.. ripping
contrasts, from madcap comedy to
absurd drama reflecting life around us
— shattering, trivial, contradictory."
And that he does, skillfully.
The actress who bares her body to
sell beer and cologne becomes Mary.
The actor who does voice-overs for
porno films becomes a disciple of
Christ. The priest who finds it accept
able to sleep with women cannot allow
the play to continue because it contra
dicts the teachings of the Church.

The only problem I had with "Jesus
of Montreal" is that, at times, it was a
little too symbolic. Each of the charac
ters eventually takes on the role he/she
portrayed in the play, with Daniel
becoming a modern-day Christ.
In retrospect, this helped point out
the ironies present in life, but at the
time it seemed that Arcand was trying a
little too hard to make his point obvi
ous.
This, however, was literally my only
complaint, and one with which others
may not agree. And the writing, acting
ana filming more than make up for it.
It made a believer out of me. A
