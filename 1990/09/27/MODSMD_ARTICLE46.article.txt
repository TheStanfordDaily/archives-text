# 'Heights': Fatal Attraction on the Pacific
## 
### 
Pacific Heights
Melanle Griffith, Matthew Modlne
John Schlesinger's "Pacific Heights" is a
"Fatal Attraction" ripoff set in San Francisco.
But where sex was fatal in the first film, rent
makes the blood spatter in "Heights."
Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith play
the very-much-in-love couple. They buy a
beautiful, but rundown, Pacific Heights Victo
rian house that looks just like the mansion in
"Psycho." (This is their first mistake — had
they seen Hitchcock's classic, they would have
bought a condo in Saratoga).
The two renovate the place. They scrub the
floors, paint the walls and make love on spat
tered Canvases, just like Demi Moore and
Patrick Swayze did in "Ghost." In short, every
thing is cloyingly sweet and peachy until they
take in a psychopathic tenant played by

Michael Keaton.
This is their second mistake — if they had
ever seen any other typical Hollywood thriller,
they would have known that a man who drives
a black Porsche, listens to screechy violins and
dresses like Mickey Rourke spells BAD
NEWS, lb them, of course, he seems like the
ideal tenant.
This should have been the starting point for
all the fun in the film. With the creep in the
house, the possibilities for dramatic suspense
are endless. Instead, the film gets more pre
posterous and manipulative with every plot
development. Keaton changes the locks on his
apartment, drills holes in the wall at 3 a.m.
and breeds cockroaches in his spare time.
When Griffith complains to the police, she
is told that her tenant can stay in the house for
as long as he wants,
Like Anne Archer in "Fatal Attraction,"

Melanie Griffith does little more than look
bedraggled and desperate until the last reel,
when she finally takes matters into her own
hands and puts a few household appliances to
deadly use.
Most unforgivably, director Schlesinger has
not the slightest inkling of respect for his audi
ence. This is the kind of film where nobody
bothers to turn on the light when they go to
the basement.
Schlesinger attempts to make his film visu
ally striking, setting up shots that are flooded
with smoke, rays of white light, and blue shad
ows. Not only are these techniques prehis
toric methods of cinematography, but they are
so flawlessly framed in this film that they
seem unnatural and obtrusive. If this were
not a feature movie, it could pass for a per
fume ad. C
