# No 'Margin' for error
## Hackman delivers another thrilling performance

Narrow Margin
Anne Archer, Gene Hackman
There are a couple of things that will
derail any suspense thriller — an unfocused
camera, and an unconvincing premise. Peter
Hyam's locomotive film "Narrow Margin"
manages to avoid these obstacles and stay
right on track.
Like so many thrillers before it, "Narrow
Margin" follows the plight of an ordinary
man and woman accidentally drawn into an
extraordinary situation. Writer-director
Hyams establishes this plot device only min
utes into the film when book editor Carol
Hunnicut (Anne Archer) witness the murder
of the attorney she has met for a blind date.
She escapes to her brother's cabin in
Canada only to be found out by deputy dis
trict attorney Robert Caulfield (Gene Hack
man). A sudden shootout forces the very
reluctant Hunnicut to escape with Caulfiela.
Unable to eluded their airborne pursuers in
the Canadian wilderness, the two get on a
passenger train headed for Vancouver. As fate
a nd the script would have it, the hit men also
get on the train. All the pieces are now in
place for an elaborate game of cat and
mouse.
Sustaining the suspense and convincing
the viewer that escape from the train is
impossible would seem to be the primary
challenges for a set restricted to a train's inte
rior.

Hyams successfully overcomes each of
these problems. He keeps dramatic tension
taut by intertwining series of vignettes with
the hit men's methodical search of the train.
A key element of the film's premise is that
both Hunnicut and deputy D.A. Caulfield
are normal, although clever, people. Not
once do they elude death by inhuman
strength or sheer firepower. Moreover, they
make mistakes. In the end, chance has as
much to do with Carol's and Caulfield's sur
vival as anything else. And that makes the
film work extremely well.
Once again, Gene Hackman turns in a
fine performance. His performance as a
cocky Los Angeles prosectuor adroitly avoids
the typical greasy slickness of cinematic
attorneys. James B. Sikking is sufficiently
menacing as the lead hit man, Nelson.
Though Sikking is not the most terrifying of
assassins, he at least does not resemble his
TV role as Doogie Howser's father
Anne Archer's role as the marked-for
death witness proves to an unfortunate,
though necessary, waste of talent. Except for
her scenes at the very beginning of the film,
Archer performance is unavoidably limited
to either the emotions of frustration or fright.
Using a plot line that fails in other films
as often as it succeeds, director Hyams has
crafted a tight, relentless suspense thriller
that delivers more than almost all of the
mainstream films released this summer A
