# CINEMA SCOPE
## 
### 
Metropolitan
Edward Clements
A charming look at upper-crust New
York City In the modern day. Lots of
debutante scenes, but nothing more off
putting than attending a party In the Suites.
This sleeper hit of 1990 Is masterfully
executed by writer-director Whit Stlllman.
Surely worth spending an evening with.
Darkman
Llam Neeson
Too gory even for the strong stomached
(though the finger guillotine Is a nice
touch), Darkman Is overwrought and
overblown. The movie tries to be too much
â€” an action thriller, a poignant romance
and a scl-fl tour de force. Some moments
score well as our hero carries out his
revenge.
The Two Jakes
Jack Nicholson
After a 20-year wait, perhaps we
expected too much from this "Chinatown"
seauel with Nicholson starring and
directing. As with "The Color or Money,"
there were a number of moments where
you'd be lost had you not seen the original.
Lots of narration to fill gaps In the story. The
earthauake scenes hit a bit too close to
home for Bay Area residents.
Men at Work
Charlie Sheen, Emlllo Estevez
After this film, Sheen and Estevez just
might be out of work.
Presumed Innocent
Harrison Ford, Bonnie Bedella
The screen adaptation of Scott Turow's
bestseller proves to be a haunting Journey
through one man's soul. The cast Is
sensational from top to bottom. Ford
proves, as he did In "Witness," that he can
do more than uncover burled treasure and
blast spaceships from the sky. Excellent
supporting performance from Brian
Dennehy as the city's prosecuting attorney
about to take a fall.
