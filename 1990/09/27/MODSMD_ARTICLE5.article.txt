# Mem Chu to begin fund raising
##

Memorial Church officials will
kick off a $10 million fundraising
drive to repair the earthquake
damaged building with a special
worship service in the Quad Sun
day at 10 a.m.
The service will include an
interdenominational sermon
titled "Stanford Profanities" by
Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg,
and Assoc. Organist Robert Bates
will play the Fisk-Nanney organ
from inside the Church.
University Trustee Melvin
Lane will also outline the
fundraising drive for complete

restoration of the Church at the
service.
Lane said he was excited with
the amount of donations the
Church has received so far, includ
ing a $2 million gift from William
Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard Com
pany. As chair of the fundraising
committee, Lane said his prelimi
nary goal is to raise $8 million of
the estimated $10 million in
needed repairs.
"I don't want to say [raising
the finances] is easy ," Lane said,
"and we'll have to work for it, but
lota of people love the Church and
have close ties to it."
Hewlett's donation, along with

another $2 million in gifts from
Church members and Stanford
alumni, still leaves the fundrais
ing campaign $4 million short of
the $8 million target.
Lane plans to start a fundrais
ing campaign through the mail
this year to alumni and others
who have participated in Church
activities.
Project Manager Olivier
Pieron, who will oversee the
restoration of the Church, said
the work will probably not be com
pleted for another two years.
Reconstruction is still in the plan-
ning stages, and actual work on
the site is slated to begin in April
or May of next year.
"The construction could take
14 months, but if we discover
more problems it will take longer,"
said Pieron.
Pieron added that the major
structural flaw in the Church is in
the ceiling. "It's a strong possibil
ity [the ceiling] would collapse in
another 7.0 quake."
While the name of the building
contractor has not yet been
released, the University has desig

nated Degen Kold and Associates
aa tha company in charge of
designing the reconstruction
plans.
"We're going to reinforce the
Church rather than rebuild," said
Pieron. "We also don't want the
repairs to take away from the
beauty of the Church."
Repairs will be made on the
stained glass windows, which are
full of cracks. Fire-escape stair
ways will also be placed on both
sides of the Church.
Since October's earthquake,
services have been held in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. "Attendance
has been down since the quake,"
said Lane, "but on Sunday we
hope it will be up."
