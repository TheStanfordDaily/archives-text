Memorial Church officials will
kick off a $10 million fundraising
drive to repair the earthquake
damaged building with a special
worship service in the Quad Sun
day at 10 a.m.
The service will include an
interdenominational sermon
titled "Stanford Profanities" by
Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg,
and Assoc. Organist Robert Bates
will play the Fisk-Nanney organ
from inside the Church.
University Trustee Melvin
Lane will also outline the
fundraising drive for complete

restoration of the Church at the
service.
Lane said he was excited with
the amount of donations the
Church has received so far, includ
ing a $2 million gift from William
Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard Com
pany. As chair of the fundraising
committee, Lane said his prelimi
nary goal is to raise $8 million of
the estimated $10 million in
needed repairs.
"I don't want to say [raising
the finances] is easy ," Lane said,
"and we'll have to work for it, but
lota of people love the Church and
have close ties to it."
Hewlett's donation, along with

another $2 million in gifts from
Church members and Stanford
alumni, still leaves the fundrais
ing campaign $4 million short of
the $8 million target.
Lane plans to start a fundrais
ing campaign through the mail
this year to alumni and others
who have participated in Church
activities.
Project Manager Olivier
Pieron, who will oversee the
restoration of the Church, said
the work will probably not be com
pleted for another two years.
Reconstruction is still in the plan-
