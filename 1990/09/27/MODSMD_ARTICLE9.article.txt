# Independent Betas happy with status

Despite their recent expulsion
from the national Beta Theta Pi
fraternity, Stanford's Betas say
they look forward to a strong and
active future as a local, indepen
dent fraternity.
According to Beta President
Josh Sanborn, the chapter was
expecting only a censure for dis
agreements with the national
organization. However, Sanborn
said the Betas responded to the
surprise revocation with "a gen
eral attitude of relief."
Beta Jon Morrill said, "The
immediate positives outweigh the
negatives by far," adding he had
doubts last year about being affili
ated with a national organization
whose members on other cam
puses have been accused of gang
rape and racist attitudes.
The fraternity's general
convention voted to sever its ties
with the chapter in early August.
Both the Betas declaration in the
spring Rushbook of their auton
omy from the national organiza
tion and their use of rituals and
initiation procedures different
from the national's led to the
expulsion.
One advantage to being an
independent fraternity house is
local members will no longer have
be associated with the stigma
attached to the national Betas,
Sanborn said.
The transition to em indepen
dent house will not involve radical
change. Although the national
organization has asked them to
change their name, the Stanford
group is considering remaining

known as the Betas, since the
national fraternity only has rights
on the full name.
According to Sanborn, the
newly independent fraternity has
traditionally followed University
regulations before national ones,
a factor which contributed to the
loss of their charter. Historically,
the Betas have always thought of
themselves as Stanford students
first and Betas second, he said.
Supported by their alumni, the
Betas are looking forward to
spring rush when they will aggres
sively campaign for new members.
Sanborn said they hope to attract
potential pledges by demonstrat
ing the diversity of their group.
Some students "get turned off
by fraternities before they even
rush," because of stereotypes that
sometimes brand fraternities as
elitist, Sanborn said. "People are
involved in a lot of different
things. ... We have a wide variety
of people now."
Although becoming coed was
discussed, opening the residence
to women would have caused the
Row house to be put in the Uni
versity Housing Draw in the
spring.
But Sanborn said he feels that
fraternity housing gives students
a more comfortable atmosphere
because they can live in the house
for more than one academic year.
This gives students a "home base
on campus," he added.
The Betas largest worry now is
insurance, Sanborn said. Like
other residential groups on cam
pus, the Betas fear damage or
â– injuries related to house-spon
sored social events.
