Rushdie appears on
British television
LONDON (AP) — In his first
television interview since the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini forced him into
hiding 19 months ago, author Salman
Rushdie said his isolation has been
"hell."
The interview broadcast yesterday
was taped in a secret location before the
announcement that Britain and Iran
had restored diplomatic relations.
Relations had been severed after
Khomeini in February 1989 called on
Moslems to kill Rushdie, claiming that
his novel "The Satanic Verses"
blasphemed Islam.
Rushdie said the novel is not set out
to be insulting or abusive. "If that is
how people read it then I am very
sorry," he said.
Blaze kills mom,
dad of nine
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A rooming
house blaze killed a man and a woman
as they struggled to save their nine
sleeping children early yesterday, fire

officials said. The children escaped.
The fire broke out about 12:30 a.m.
and destroyed the two-story wooden
house before firefighters could respond,
said Deputy Fire Chief Ed Spann.
Neil Bush testifies
for S&L failure
DENVER (AP) — President Bush's
son Neil testified yesterday he was a
"go-between" for a controversial line of
credit extended by the failed thrift
where he was a director. But he insisted
his actions involved no conflict.
Bush, 35, was a director of Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association,
which collapsed in 1988 at an estimated
cost to taxpayerB of $1 billion.
The Office of Thrift Supervision
brought the action against Bush, which
could bar him from the banking
industry. The office alleges that Bush
failed to inform fellow Silverado
directors of his business ties with
developers Kenneth Good and Bill
Walters, who eventually defaulted on
more than $132 million in Silverado
loans.
