# Raise taxes, Econ prof. says

Budget-reduction should be achieved by
raising taxes, starting with products that the
public deems detrimental, said John Shoven, a
Stanford professor of economics.
Congress is holding a budget summit to
devise spending cuts of $50 billion. If they are
unable to come to an

agreement before early
October, the Gramm-
Rudman Act will force
automatic across-the
board cuts.
The biggest hurdle in

the ongoing negotia
tions is an inability to determine what spend
ing to cut and what taxes to raise. Lawmakers
hope to reduce the budget by $50 billion for the
fiscal year 1991, and $500 billion over the next
five years.
Foremost on Shoven's list is a tax increase
! on tobacco products. "I think just about every
one supports this one, except for the people
from North Carolina," Shoven said.
Although an energy tax may seem desirable
at the moment, Shoven said it should be
phased in. "I'm not sure we want to sock a big
tax on the economy right now," he said.
A compromise on the capital gains tax that
would involve indexing capital gains for infla
tion is almost certain, he said.
"I am surprised that in the tug-of-war over
the capital gains, [the Republicans and
Democrats] have hit on something that is pos
itive," Shoven said.
Shoven, however, acknowledged that just
one compromise is not enough. "The capital
gains change will only break even, at best, and
the other taxes won't raise the kind of money
we need."
Shoven added that it is counterproductive
to leave the basic tax rate untouched.
