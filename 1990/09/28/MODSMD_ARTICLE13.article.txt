# Schools for blacks approved

MILWAUKEE (AP) - Public school
officials have approved a plan to create
two schools next year that will cater to
the needs and experiences of young
black male students.
The Milwaukee School Board voted
5-3 Wednesday night to designate an
elementary school and a middle school
beginning with the 1991-92 school year
as African-American Immersion
Schools.
Milwaukee is believed to be the first
public school district in the nation to
approve a specific curriculum for black
males, supporters said. The District of
Columbia's school board is considering
a similar plan.
"It's fair to say that the achievement
levels of African-American males have
not been good," said Milwaukee school
spokesman Dave Begel. "This is an
attempt to improve it."
While the two experimental schools
will be open to all students to comply
with anti-discrimination laws, their
curriculum will stress African heritage
and the special educational, social and
emotional needs of young black males,
Begel said.
More than 50 percent of the Milwau
kee Public School District's 98,000 stu
dents are black. Supporters claim many

blacks suffer low achievement in the
district because they lose their identity
or become discouraged by a curriculum
that stresses the heritage of whites.
A citizen's task force initiated the
African-American school plan after its
study found that fewer than 20 percent
of the 5,716 black male students in Mil
waukee high schools had a grade aver
age of C or better.
The group also found 50 percent of
all students suspended from district
schools last year were black males, even
though they make up only 27.6 percent
of the total enrollment. The district's
high school dropout rate stood at 14.4
percent last year.
Leaders of Milwaukee's black com
munity have supported the plan
throughout its development, saying the
schools will be an alternative to tradi
tional public education that has
stressed European heritage.
"A lot of African-American students,
male and female, just don't have any
sense of what we have gone through and
come through as a people," said Alder
man Pratt, a representative of a mostly
black, inner-city district.
"What's missing for a lot of young
people is the pride in African history

that I think an Afro-centric curriculum
will foster," he said.
The approved proposal was modified
from an earlier plan to establish three
all-black, all-male schools. The earlier
plan was scrapped after educators and
lawyers advised it would be challenged
as unconstitutional.
Board Member Doris Stacy opposed
the proposal, arguing that it is unconsti
tutional, educationally unsound and
morally wrong. "To isolate students by
race in America in 1990 is wrong," she
said.
Stacy said although the district
needs to focus on black males, it would
be better to create a program that incor
porates a nurturing environment for all
children.
The poor performance of black stu
dents was cited in another educational
experiment that began this year. The
Wisconsin Legislature this spring
approved a plan to provide $2,500
vouchers to as many as 1,000 poor Mil
waukee students, allowing them to leave
public schools for private, non-sectarian
schools.
The plan survived a court challenge
and began this month with about 400
students enrolled in private schools.
