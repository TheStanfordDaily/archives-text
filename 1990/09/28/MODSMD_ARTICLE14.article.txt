BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) â€” Terror reigned yester
day near UC-Berkeley as a "deranged" Iranian gun
man stormed a bar, killed one man, wounded seven
people and took 33 hostages.
The gunman, reported to have a hatred of blond
Americans, died in a burst of police bullets after a
seven-hour standoff. Six officers stormed Henry's
Publick House and Grille in the Durant Hotel after
police negotiators decided they could not talk him
out of the bar, Lt. Jim Polk said.
Polk said the gunman, identified by UC-Berkeley
spokesman Ray Colvig as Mehrdad Dashti, gave
away his position inside the bar by using one of the
terrorized hostages as an intermediary in talking to
police by telephone.
Seconds after the burst of police gunfire around
7:20 a.m., hostages, some of whom had been forced
to sit in the windows of the bar as shields, ran from
the hotel.
"For some reason, he had something against
blonds, Caucasian women and blond-haired, blue
eyed men," said Douglas Moore, 25, a student at
UC-Berkeley and manager of the bar who was one of
the hostages. "He had something against Ameri
cans.
"He accused the women of showing too much
leg," Moore said. "He accused them of wearing tight
skirts, short skirts.
"He said it was that kind of trash that was lead
ing guys like him on and that they deserved to be
punished. He did a pretty good job of degrading the
women."
Mayor Loni Hancock said women hostages were
sexually abused, but would not give details.
Dashti, 30, a native of Iran, was naked and bleed
ing when he was loaded into an ambulance and
taken to Highland Hospital. He was dead on arrival,
according to hospital spokeswoman Phyllis Brown.
Two of the wounded were in guarded condition
with multiple bullet wounds, two were being treated
for leg wounds, and three were treated and released,
hospital officials said.
The English pub-style bar, a popular student
hangout one block from the UC-Berkeley campus,
was crowded when the gunman rushed inside, wit
nesses said. Several escaped soon after the standoff
began, police said.

Dashti shot six people after entering, a witness
said. Police reported another two people were shot
during a round of gunfire about three hours later.
Moore said John Sheehy, 22, of Lafayette, was
shot in the chest at close range early in the incident.
Sheehy, a UC-Berkeley student, died during surgery,
said Thomas McGarry, a spokesman at Eden Hospi
tal in Castro Valley.
Witnesses said the shooting was punctuated by
the gunman screaming, "When is it going to end?

How long? How long?"
Frederick Smith, 19, a IJC-Berkeley junior and
Dashti's roommate for a month, said Dashti grew up
in Iran and came to the United States about eight
years ago. He said Dashti was a gun collector and
had given him shooting lessons.
One document found in the apartment that
Smith and Dashti shared was a form from the
Alameda County Department of Health Services
that describes Dashti as a paranoid schizophrenic.
