# Senate committee approves Souter's nomination

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
Judiciary Committee voted 13-1 yesterday
to approve President Bush's nomination of
Judge David Souter to the Supreme Court.
The panel sent its recommendation to
the full Senate, where confirmation is
expected within a few days. Republicans
urged a speedy vote so that Souter could
take his seat before the court opens its term
on Monday.
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., cast the
only vote against Souter.
Kennedy broke ranks with his colleagues
who wanted to give Souter the benefit of

the doubt. "The lesson of the past decade .
. . is that we must vote our fears, not our
hopes," he said.
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-
Del., joined with six other committee
Democrats and all six Republicans in sup
porting Souter. However, Biden said he was
troubled by uncertainty surrounding
Souter's positions on rights issues, includ
ing abortion.
"He's about the best, though, that we're
going to be able to do from this administra
tion," Biden said.
"We probably have as moderate a choice

as George Bush will send to the Senate,"
said Sen. Paul Simon, D-111.
While Souter did not attend the meeting,
many of the activist groups that worked for
or against his nomination were present in
the packed hearing room.
For nearly two hours prior to the vote,
13 of the 14 senators read statements on
their positions before the television cam
eras in the paneled committee room. Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, a Republican from
Souter's home state of New Hampshire,
submitted a written statement for the
record, saying he wanted to speed action on

the vote.
Molly Yard, head of the National Organi
zation for Women, praised Kennedy for his
opposition, telling reporters afterward that
his action was a "profile in courage." She
was referring to a book on great Americans
written by his late brother, President John
F. Kennedy.
Souter, 51, spent 12 years on the New
Hampshire bench before joining the federal
appeals court in Boston this year. He would
be the 105 th Supreme Court justice if con
firmed by the full Senate.
