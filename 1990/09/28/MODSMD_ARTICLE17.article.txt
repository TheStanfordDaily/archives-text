Orientation alienation.
Unfortunately, in past
years, it extended to new
white students as well as new stu
dents of color.
Although the University's
intention of introducing new stu
dents to multiculturalism during
Orientation was and is a noble
goal, the method of introduction —
fiery speeches and provocative per
formances — intimidated and
turned off many white students.
This year's kinder, gentler —
albeit weaker — Orientation may
well foster more positive feelings
about dealing with issues and
problems of diversity.
Hopefully, students of color who
felt empowered by past Orienta
tions and missed it this year will be
able to find empowerment in the
various students of color organiza
tions on campus.
Students still had a chance this
year to celebrate the African-
American, Chicano/Latino and

Asian-American cultures at Satur
day's cultural banquets.
But new banquets — New Eng
land, Mardi Gras, East European
and Native American — along with
the traditional Jewish banquet,
increased the diversity of cultures
presented and allowed many more
students to feel culturally
included.
Wise move, Orientation organiz
ers. Another wise move, whatever
the organizers' reason, is postpon
ing "The Fire Within" until Octo
ber.
New students will be able to par
ticipate as both performers and
spectators in the cultural celebra
tion this year.
Also, the potential divisiveness
of "The Fire Within" will occur at
a time when dormitory communi
ties have begun to form, making it
easier for all students to deal with
in a positive manner.
Orientation 1990 may prove to
be the one which found the right
mixture of fire and fun.
