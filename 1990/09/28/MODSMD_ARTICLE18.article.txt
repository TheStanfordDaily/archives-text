Conscientious objectors
to ASSU fees will have an
easier time collecting their
refunds this year.
Instead of waiting in long lines
to snatch back cash from student
groups and organizations, objec
tors can now request checks by
mail and pick them up at their con
venience. Next year, the ASSU
may even mail checks out to stu
dents.
This new system improves on
the old one from at least two view
points. To objectors, it means less
hassle in retrieving what becomes
extra pizza money. To the ASSU, it
means possible savings of $5,000
per year and a less "exacted" staff,
according to Financial Manager
Torrence Boone.
Such streamlining is indeed a

good thing — and a Stanford
trademark, of late.
One wonders what the ASSU
could do with these savings....
Reallocate them to the groups and
organizations who lose fees each
year, perhaps?
From the viewpoint of these
groups the new process is worri
some. Fee refunds cramp student
groups' budgets every quarter —
and the situation will only worsen
now that they are easier to obtain.
In the spring election, students
overwhelmingly voted down an
amendment to abolish fee refunds
entirely.
Unless someone figures out a
one-step, straightforward fee allo
cation system — hardly likely —
this new one serves the most peo
ple the best.
