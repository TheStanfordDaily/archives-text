# Federal alcohol regulations
## Stanford must mesh law with its policy 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Given a new federal law requiring uni
versities to prohibit illegal drinking and
drug use, University officials now face the
difficult task of reconciling the new regula
tion with the current alcohol policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
In compliance with the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, Stanford
yesterday issued a new policy, effective Oct.
1, regarding the consumption and posses
sion of alcohol and other drugs by students
and employees.
While the exact alcohol and drug policy
has yet to be determined, Stanford's new
alcohol and drug policy now meets the new
law's general requirements.
"Frankly, it grieves me," Acting Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin said
of the new federal law. "I find it extremely
disappointing that the Department of Edu
cation felt it necessary to promulgate [the
regulations]," she added.
The federal policy applies to all universi
ties receiving federal funds. Stanford
receives millions of dollars every year from
the government in the form of financial aid
and research grants.

According to the new law, Stanford must
have and distribute a written policy which:
•clearly prohibits the unlawful posses
sion, use or distribution of illicit drugs and
alcohol by students and employees on its
property or as part of any of its activities;
•describes the applicable legal sanctions
under local, state or federal law for the
unlawful possession or distribution of illicit
drugs and alcohol;
•describes the health risks associated
with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of
alcohol;
•describes any drug or alcohol counsel
ing, treatment or rehabilitation programs
available to employees and students; and
•states it will impose disciplinary sanc
tions on students and employees (consis
tent with local, state and federal laws), up
to and including expulsion or termination
of employment and referral for prosecution
for violations of the university's standards
of conduct.
Each university must also review its pro
gram and make changes as needed bienni
ally.
Reflecting the opinion of some adminis
trators. Acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson said the new pol
icy is "clearly different from how
we've approached this issue in the
past."
"I believe in the [current] alco
hol policy really strongly," he said.
Stanford's current alcohol pol
icy has a more hands-ofT approach
to students and drinking, in
accordance with the Fundamental
Standard.
Officials hope to keep that atti
tude in spite of the new regula
tions. Conklin said, "I think it is
absolutely critical that we con
tinue to grant students decision
making power in all possible
realms."
Because the Department of
Education does not dictate how
universities should enforce their
policies, Stanford will have to
decide what, if any, changes to
make in current enforcement
efforts.
Robinson said the University
has yet to decide how to enforce
the policy, and administrators
would "like to get as much input
and creative thinking as they
can.
Universities must include
expulsion as a possible sanction,
but Conklin said expulsion is
"extraordinarily rare" at Stanford
and has occurred only a few times
in its hundred-year history.
Robinson said Stanford must
"continue to be an educational
institution and not a punitive
one.
Conklin said the University

will be distributing copies of the
policy to resident assistants and
resident fellows in October to dis
cuss with students. Conklin said
she hopes students will contact
her with their questions, concerns
and suggestions.
"The real challenge is to imple
ment the policy in a way that's
consistent with our philosophy,"
said University counsel Susan
Hoerger, who drafted the new pol
icy.
Hoerger said the Department
of Education will randomly inves
tigate universities to make sure
they are upholding their policies.
Hoerger said the new policy
may make some dorms or frater
nities reluctant to serve alcohol.
"Managing [alcohol] in a sensible
way will become an important
issue," she said.
For some, it already has.
Louise Miller, a health promotion
specialist at Cowell Student
Health Center, said a new pro
gram will be started to help frater
nities and dorms plan parties
safely.
Miller also said that with Cow
ell, Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Bridge, providing
alcohol and drug treatment and
counseling won't be a problem.
If anything, Miller said the new
federal law "highlights the need
for education" about alcohol and
drug use.
"These regulations were not
something we sought or were very
happy to receive," Conklin said,
"but they are a fact of our lives,
and we'll just have to work as a
community to do something about
this."
