# Federal alcohol regulations
## Stanford must mesh law with its policy 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Given a new federal law requiring uni
versities to prohibit illegal drinking and
drug use, University officials now face the
difficult task of reconciling the new regula
tion with the current alcohol policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
In compliance with the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, Stanford
yesterday issued a new policy, effective Oct.
1, regarding the consumption and posses
sion of alcohol and other drugs by students
and employees.
While the exact alcohol and drug policy
has yet to be determined, Stanford's new
alcohol and drug policy now meets the new
law's general requirements.
"Frankly, it grieves me," Acting Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin said
of the new federal law. "I find it extremely
disappointing that the Department of Edu
cation felt it necessary to promulgate [the
regulations]," she added.
The federal policy applies to all universi
ties receiving federal funds. Stanford
receives millions of dollars every year from
the government in the form of financial aid
and research grants.

According to the new law, Stanford must
have and distribute a written policy which:
•clearly prohibits the unlawful posses
sion, use or distribution of illicit drugs and
alcohol by students and employees on its
property or as part of any of its activities;
•describes the applicable legal sanctions
under local, state or federal law for the
unlawful possession or distribution of illicit
drugs and alcohol;
•describes the health risks associated
with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of
alcohol;
•describes any drug or alcohol counsel
ing, treatment or rehabilitation programs
available to employees and students; and
•states it will impose disciplinary sanc
tions on students and employees (consis
tent with local, state and federal laws), up
to and including expulsion or termination
of employment and referral for prosecution
for violations of the university's standards
of conduct.
Each university must also review its pro
gram and make changes as needed bienni
ally.
Reflecting the opinion of some adminis
trators. Acting Dean of Student Affairs
