## Myths and facts about admissions 
### 
A LITERARY DEAN ONCE com
pared the work of an undergradu
ate admissions officer with Dante's
"Divine Comedy": part Paradise, part
Purgatory and part Inferno. I would
agree.
As Stanford's dean of undergraduate
admissions, I can think of no more pleas
ant task than to send 2,500 thick, good
news envelopes each year to some of the
brightest, most talented high school stu
dents in the country.
At the same time, however, we also
send thin, bad-news envelopes to around
13,000 other applicants, and after the
mailing is done we can count on a flood of
calls from disappointed parents, grand
parents, teachers, counselors and princi
pals.
This is where the Inferno comes in.
We try to respond to their questions,
complaints and outbursts as best we can
â€” with sensitivity, patience and under
standing. But no matter how much infor
mation we provide, the same misconcep
tions reappear year after year. .. .
What myths trouble us most? Here,
along with the facts, are the ones that get
my .. . vote:
Stanford doesn't care about
alumni children.
Counter myth: Alumni children get all
the breaks.
Our short answer to the question "Is
there any special preference given to
alumni children?" is a definite yes; no col
lege admissions officer in the country
would answer otherwise. Our longer
answer, however, is a bit more compli
cated. .. .

Recently, I received a call from the
father of one such applicant. He was obvi
ously upset and insisted that I explain
why his son was not offered admission.
My first approach was to provide all
the standard statistics: that over 3,000 of
our 16,000 applicants last year had 4.0
grade point averages, that almost 60 per
cent of the applicants were in the top 10
percent of their class, etc., etc.
"But don't you take into account the
fact that I'm an active and loyal alum?"
he asked. "That I contribute regularly to
fund-raising and that I organize alumni
events?"
"Of course the loyalty of alumni is val
ued and important," I answered, "but for
the admissions process to maintain its
essential integrity, alumni ties can only
make a difference when it's a matter of
tipping the balance."
In pursuit of a geographically
diverse student body, Stanford has
quotas for specific parts of the coun
try and specific schools.
I can be very unequivocal on this.
Stanford considers all applicants as indi
viduals, regardless of where they're from.
We have no quotas of any kind.. ..
No matter how we say it, though, even
experienced high school principals will
jump to the wrong conclusion.
One such principal wrote us last year
to complain that we had broken an unspo
ken promise, ... as he saw it: to accept
three students every year from his school,
as we had done for three years in a row.
Last year, however, we only accepted one.
"We are very disappointed," the principal
wrote.

It is a disadvantage to apply to
Stanford from a private school.
Counter-myth: It is a disadvantage to
apply to Stanford from a public school.
Again, our focus is on the individual.
We do not distinguish between one type of
school and another.
Of course, [this] is not always obvious
to the high schools we draw from. One
year, we admitted eight out of nine appli
cants from one fine private school, while
we didn't accept anybody from a neigh
boring public school.
Understandably, the principal from the
public school was miffed, but what we
couldn't understand was why the princi
pal from the private school was so indig
nant. He complained that we should have
admitted the school's ninth applicant
rather than putting him on our waiting
list. .. .
To be sure, applying to college, even for
the most talented of students, can be a
disconcerting, unnerving process. And
after admission decisions are made, it's
only natural for disappointed applicants
and their parents to question our reason
ing.
It's interesting to note, however, that
even among the students we do accept,
there is some second-guessing over what
really went on. They wonder whether
we've made some sort of terrible mistake
that will eventually be found out.
