University should
take student input
on meal exchanges
The University has decided to abolish
the meal exchange card system. This, for
those of you who don't know, allowed
people in self-ops, co-ops and eating clubs
to eat in dorms and vice versa. In other
words, it encouraged interaction between
people living in dorms and others,
notably those living on the Row, because
it made it easy to get together for lunch
or dinner.
The abolition of meal exchange cards
raises two questions to which the
University administration should
respond.
Presumably, this was part of a budget
cut. However, although the budget of the
University will fall slightly, the cost of

allowing students from dorms and Row
houses to meet for lunch or dinner will
be borne instead entirely by the Row
houses or by the students themselves (if,
say, they eat at Tresidder). So this bud
get cut hasn't saved students any money
at all. If this is so, why was the cut
made?
There was, as far as I or anyone in my
house knows, no announcement in
advance that this cut would be made,
and certainly no consultation with stu
dents on the Row who are the people
most seriously affected. Why not? Does
the University think that students are
not intelligent enough to come up with
alternative proposals if there was some
problem with the meal exchange card
system? Did they not announce it
because they have a bad conscience about
it?

Alcohol regulations
should not change
despite federal law
According to one administrator, the
requirements of the new Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act are "con
trary to what our posture has been for
many years."

Yet the University
seems ready to change
its student conduct
rules

Yet the University seems ready to
change its student conduct rules so that
drug and alcohol use will soon become
punishable offenses.
In return, Stanford will receive money
from the government. In other words,
the University is accepting a bribe.
Our current policy works well â€”
response last year to a proposed change
in the alcohol policy showed widespread
opposition to restrictions far milder than
those facing us today.
Students here are allowed to make
their own personal decisions, and that
freedom inspires an unusual amount of
trust and cooperation between the stu
dent body and administration.
University President Donald Kennedy
recently declared Stanford's central pur
pose to be "the preparation of new lead
ership in this society."
If our administration allows itself to
be bought off and adopts a policy of let
ting the federal government make our
rules for us, prospective students will
have a good reason to seek that prepara
tion elsewhere.
