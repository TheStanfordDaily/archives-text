# Can you beat the best of the Bug?
## 
### 
One beloved Stanford Daily tradition is
the irreverent Bug column. Each Friday the
Bug answers your questions about Stan
ford, or the world in general. The Daily is
currently looking for someone to write the
Bug this year, and if you think you've got
the right inspiration, sense of humor, and
"research skills," submit a sample column
(yes, you have to write your own questions)
and drop it off in David Bianco's box (he's
the Diversions editor) at the Daily in the
Storke Publications Building by next Tues
day, Oct. 2.
So, to give prospective Bugs as well as all
you clueless frosh an idea of what the Bug
column is like, this week we're presenting,
you guessed it,"The Best of The Bug."
Dear Bug,
The library doesn't carry Penthouse
magazine, does it? Why not? After all, it
does have a large readership.
-J.F.
I asked Jim Knox why Green Library
didn't carry Penthouse. Jim is the Curator

for U.S. and British History, so his knowl
edge of pornographic magazines is not
extensive, at least not on the professional
level. Nevertheless, Jim was able to give me
a fairly good answer. It seems that Pent
house simply "doesn't support academic
programming," he said.
But the library does, however, carry
Playboy. I asked Jim about this, pointing
out Playboy's rather weak academic record.
"That's a good question," pondered Jim,

pausing a second before replying.
Apparently the University is cutting
back on the more popular publications in
favor of the much more unpopular and
"tremendously expensive" science and
trade journals, a trade-off which makes
sense to me, because reshelving is such a
hassle.
Jim went on to say that despite funding
cutbacks, the University tries to keep
"some representation of genre point of
view, but not necessarily everything." I
would therefore deduce that the library car
ries Playboy over Penthouse because Play
boy maintains a .. . mmm, well .. . fairly
expansive point of view, without necessarily
showing everything, as Penthouse usually
does.
Dear Bug,
On my acceptance letter, Jean Fetter
signed, "Angela, great" in the lower left
hand corner. Does she do that for everyone,
or am I just special?
— Angela, of course

Angela, surely you are special, but she
does do that for everyone — all 2,500 of the
accepted everyones — bringing the signing
time per letter up to 30 seconds. A grueling
20 hours and 50 minutes total.
"I've got about a half a dozen different
ones and try to add a new one each year,"
Fetter said. In an informal fcoH, "great"
came out as the most-received
adjective/interjection, with "terrific" and
"super" lagging behind for second and
third.
A mqjor concern, other than two room
mates with the same adjective, is the diffi
culty of finding expressions with equal rank
on what she calls the "hierarchy of enthusi
asm." Imagine how quickly your initial
pleasure with "nice, Sally" would turn to
disappointment when you find out that
your next-door neighbor got "amazing,
Helen."

Special thanks to past Bugs and all
around Daily whiz kids Andrew Berkowitz,
Aram Irwin and Kathryn Ver Ploeg.
