# 160-ft SLAC?

September 27, 1949
The Stanford Daily
Stanford physicists announced
they were ready to begin tests on
the first 15-foot section of the
University's new type of atom
smasher, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator.
Final length will be 160 feet.
One hundred sixty feet? Now
hold on. There are several possible
explanations for this: First, and
most likely, the Daily reporters
had thsir heads lodged firmly in
an uncomfortable place when they
wrote the story. (Gee, how rare is
that?) Second, the University
planned SLAC to be 160 feet long,
but the unbelievable overhead
costs they charged the federal gov
ernment for research allowed
them to make it over two miles
long instead.

Third, there's the possibility
that SLAC really is 160 feet long,
and the other two miles or so are
just a really long, expensive
indoor drag strip.

In a letter to all students, Joel
Smith, dean of students,
announced that hospitilization
costs would no longer be provided
as part of the Student Health Ser
vice.
No explanation was offered in
the letter, but in an interview,
Smith said it was decided upon by
the Vice Presidents, in an effort to
cut Stanford's budget.
Students were required, how
ever, to be covered by some form
of health insurance. They could
either use coverage provided by
their parents, or through a policy
through Continental Casualty
Company in San Francisco.
Who says the University hasn't
come a long way in the last two
decades ? In the old days, budget
cuts only affected services — like
this one — that were used by
maybe two or three people every
year. Nowadays, all the Univer
sity wants to slash are popular
services, like computer clusters,
The Bridge, Residential Educa
tion .... Hey, who needs 'em?
