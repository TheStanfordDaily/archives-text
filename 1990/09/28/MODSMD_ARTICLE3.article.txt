# Kennedy, Rosse relay plans to keep University leaner
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
By redrawing its organizational chart
at the same time it trims $22 million from
its operating budget, Stanford hopes to
avoid a phenomenon James Rosse knows
all too well.
Whenever he tries to diet, the Provost
told the Faculty Senate yesterday, he
experiences an initial weight loss but soon
gains it all back.
The "repositioning" efforts now
underway should create a leaner Stanford
for years to come, Rosse said in a report
he delivered to the senate with University
President Donald Kennedy.

The budget knife Rosse sharpened last
spring began slicing away at the Univer
sity operating budget over the summer.
Staff and service cutbacks were made,
leaving virtually no department
untouched.
One expected result of the cuts, Rosse
said yesterday, is a balanced budget for
1990-91. He projected the University
would see "modest surpluses" beginning
in 1991-92.
As a result of the repositioning accom
panying the cuts, Rosse said, each of this
year's entering freshmen will pay $1,000
less in student fees his senior year.
Rosse noted that the cutting the bud
get "was not a perfect or highly refined

process. It was in many ways a crude pro
cess," he said, and he urged faculty mem
bers to continue giving him feedback on
the process.
Addressing the senate, Kennedy
reviewed the reasons Stanford felt such
drastic cuts were necessary. The need to
cut the operating budget resulted from
"largely external circumstances,"
Kennedy said.
Tuition increases have outpaced cost
of-living increases for several years, he
noted, creating a situation in which
higher education is on the verge of a suf
fering a "consumer revolt."
"It is obviously unwise for us to con
template tuition increases that outstrip

family income over any
significant period of
time," Kennedy wrote in
his prepared remarks.
Tuition is the largest
source of revenue for the
University, comprising
43 percent of the operat
ing budget last year.
Furthermore, Ken
nedy said, growth in

Stanford's next-largest source of rev
enue, indirect-cost recovery, appears stag
nant at best.
Indirect costs are expenditures such as
electricity and maintenance that
researchers incur.

When research is
funded by government
grants, the government
reimburses Stanford for
indirect costs. This rev
enue represents 29 per
cent of the University's
operating budget.
Due to the federal deficit
and the so-called "peace
dividend," the amount of

federally sponsored research here, and
the accompanying indirect-cost recovery,
are unlikely to increase, Kennedy said.
"The conclusion is obvious," he said.

"Help is not on the way from the
revenue side of Stanford's bud
get."
At the senate meeting,
Kennedy also addressed concerns
about the ongoing federal investi
gations of Stanford's indirect-cost
recovery process.

Echoing comments made in an
interview published in yester
day's Daily, Kennedy said the
University has nothing to fear
from a thorough examination of
its procedures.
He also dismissed recent spec
ulation in the local press that
Stanford may owe the govern
ment as much as $300 million.
That amount "would be over half
of the total amount of Stanford's
indirect-cost reimbursement for
the past decade," Kennedy said.
