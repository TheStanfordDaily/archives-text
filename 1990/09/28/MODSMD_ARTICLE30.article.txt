## Pard's picks for baseball 
### 
In the next few weeks, you will see every
columnist in the country write on this, and in
fact the debate as to who should win Mqjor
League Baseball's individual awards began
before the All-Star break. So with apologies for
lack of originality, here are some of my candi
dates for the top performers of the 1990 sea
son.
American League Cy Young: Roger
Clemens, Boston. Tne Red Sox would be
nowhere near the top of the division without
him. Clemens is now 20-6 with an ERA at 1.98
— pitching in Fenway Park.
Yes, Bob Welch has 26 wins now, but Oakland
gives him just a smidgin more run support
than Boston gives Clemens. Dave Stewart also
deserves something this year, but he'll have to
settle for another lifetime achievement award.
American League Most Valuable
Player: Cecil Fielder, Detroit. A very good
case can be made for giving this one to Clemens
as well, but we'll reserve the MVP for the hit
ters. As for Rickey Henderson, eveiyone recog
nizes his all-around greatness, and his num
bers make this a very close race.

But I am a firm believer that power wins ball
games, and Fielder is slugging harder than
anyone has in quite some time. Statistically,
Fielder's selection can be justified by adding
together his RBI and runs scored (226 total)
and comparing them to Henderson's (172).
Granted, Henderson has been out of the lineup
on and off, but those are the breaks. If Jose
Canseco had played the whole season, he would
be right up there as well.
AL Rookie of the Year: Ben McDonald,
Baltimore. The top pitching prospect to come
along in a while, McDonald won his first five
games in the mEyors and will soon be a 20 game
winner.
AL Batting Champion: George Brett,
Kansas City. He'll hold off Henderson, and I
don't think Rafael Palmeiro has it in him. By
the way, where's Wade Boggs and his .350 or
whatever career average?
AL Dan Quisenberry Memorial Award
Dennis Eckersley, Oakland. Bobby Thigpen
just saved his all-time record 54th game, but
Eckersley has 45 himself, and his ERA stands
at an incomprehensible 0.64, while Thigpen's
average is way up over one, pushing two even.
The only guy with an ERA lower than Eckers
ley is his teammate and former Stanford star
Steve Chitren, but he has pitched only 11
innings.
National League Cy Young: Doug
Drabek, Pittsburgh. Drabek has been a key to
the Pirates' penant run, is the only 20 game
winner as of now in the NL, and his ERA is a
nifty 2.87. Honorable mention to Ramon Mar
tinez, the Dodgers' stick-figure strikeout king,
and almost all of the starters for the Mets.
NL MVP: Barry Bonds, Pittsburgh. This
one is pretty cut and dry. Bonds' closest com
petitor is probably his partner Bobby Bonilla.
Chicago's Ryne Sandberg, The Mets' Darryl
Strawberry, and Matt Williams of the Giants
round out the vote-getting. Eric Davis of
Cincinnati would put up crazy-high numbers
and win this award if he ever got more than
400 at bats.
NL Batting Champion I just hope it's not
Willie McGee
NL Rookie of the Year Dave Just Ice,
Atlanta. Pure talent here, baby. Justice keeps
pouring it on. It's a shame the kid's team was
out of the NL West race about a week into the
season.
Most Improved Player in Baseball Ron
nie Gant, Atlanta. Gant has finally found a
place to play in center field, after committing
about five errors a game at third base. Atlanta
sent Gant to the minors and he came back with
some smoking offensive production. He has 30
homers at last count.
Most Underrated Player in Baseball
Kevin Mitchell, San Francisco. I haven't heard
much talk this year about a player who proved
that last year's 47 HRs was not a fluke by hit
ting 35 more this year.
Most Overrated Player in Baseball
Nolan Ryan, Texas. With all due respect to a
great career, Ryan isn't close the "best pitcher
of all time" that some people make him out to
be. His strikeout totals are extremely impres
sive, but there ia a reason why he isn't much
better than a .500 pitcher, and his career ERA
is not among the best. His heat will befuddle
most batters, but when he does get hit, it's
deep.
Most Physically Gifted Athlete in His
tory of the World Bo Jackson. Bo is certainly
one of the strongest players in baseball, but
what people tend to forget is that he once ran a
40 yard dash in 4.19 seconds. If he didn't
always have a tender hamstring, he would steal
100 bases standing up. As for power, Bo once
stepped out of the batter's box and waved to
the umpire, who refused to grant him a rest.
The pitcher threw, and Bo reached back across
the plate and slapped a home run. Good Lord.
Now that Bo's average has climbed to .271, he
has the chance at a monster year next year.
Make him an early favorite to win the AL MVP
in 1991, and if you think Fielder's 48 or more
home runs are an accomplishment (which it
is), wait until Bo cracks 50 and steals another
50 bases in 1992.

400 at bats.
NL Batting Champion I just hope it's not
Willie McGee
NL Rookie of the Year Dave Just Ice,
Atlanta. Pure talent here, baby. Justice keeps
pouring it on. It's a shame the kid's team was
out of the NL West race about a week into the
season.
Most Improved Player in Baseball Ron
nie Gant, Atlanta. Gant has finally found a
place to play in center field, after committing
about five errors a game at third base. Atlanta
sent Gant to the minors and he came back with
some smoking offensive production. He has 30
homers at last count.
Most Underrated Player in Baseball
Kevin Mitchell, San Francisco. I haven't heard
much talk this year about a player who proved
that last year's 47 HRs was not a fluke by hit
ting 35 more this year.
Most Overrated Player in Baseball
Nolan Ryan, Texas. With all due respect to a
great career, Ryan isn't close the "best pitcher
of all time" that some people make him out to
be. His strikeout totals are extremely impres
sive, but there ia a reason why he isn't much
better than a .500 pitcher, and his career ERA
is not among the best. His heat will befuddle
most batters, but when he does get hit, it's
deep.
Most Physically Gifted Athlete in His
tory of the World Bo Jackson. Bo is certainly
one of the strongest players in baseball, but
what people tend to forget is that he once ran a
40 yard dash in 4.19 seconds. If he didn't
always have a tender hamstring, he would steal
100 bases standing up. As for power, Bo once
stepped out of the batter's box and waved to
the umpire, who refused to grant him a rest.
The pitcher threw, and Bo reached back across
the plate and slapped a home run. Good Lord.
Now that Bo's average has climbed to .271, he
has the chance at a monster year next year.
Make him an early favorite to win the AL MVP
in 1991, and if you think Fielder's 48 or more
home runs are an accomplishment (which it
is), wait until Bo cracks 50 and steals another
50 bases in 1992.
