# Vardell runs from start to endzone
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The blank, somewhat confused
stare is common among Stanford foot
ball fans when they hear the offensive
lineup.
Tommy Vardell? At fullback?
Where's 1000-yard gainer Jon
Volpe? And what happened to Miami
transfer Ellery Roberts, pre-season
favorite?
Nothing.
They're both still healthy, sharing
time with Vardell in the backfield. But
it's Vardell who lines up with tailback
Glyn Milburn when Stanford begins
its first series.
For the first time in his three com
petitive years with the Cardinal,
Vardell is starting own his own merit.
Not because another back is injured.
The junior from El Cahon, Calif,
has grown into his potential, to no sur
prise of coach Denny Green.
"I've always been a big fan of
Tommy Vardell. I think he is a very
explosive player. He has size and speed.
Tommy's biggest problem has been
injuries, that he has not played
healthy. But I think with his new abil
ity to stay healthy.... He could win
the [Pac-101 touchdown crown."
Vardell is off to a more than ade
quate start, bullying his way for five
touchdowns in the Cardinal's first
three games, good for the Pacific 10
Conference lead.
Granted, it's still early in the sea
son, but most expected Vardell to
get enough carries to be able to lead
Stanford in scores, much less the
league.
Except Vardell.
"I'm really not surprised, although

I am getting more carries than I
thought I would."
Neither does the new depth-chart
faze the tanned, all-American-looking
player. "I try not to think about the
depth chart this season. I decided to
block it out and just play my game. I'm
enjoying football more and I'm less
tense.
"Sure, I'm pleased, but I think I'd
be playing the same way if I were num
ber three. I really don't get into [the
limelightj. I'm much more into the
team aspect of the game now."
The enjoyment is turning into pro
duction for Stanford. In three games
the fullback has gained 134 yards on
33 carries, including a 14-yarder in
which he broke at least four tackles.
Vardell gained 252 yards on 60 posses
sions the entire season last year while
helping fill in for the injured Volpe.
Where did the "new" Vardell come
from?
"I don't know. I've definitely

improved, mentally more than any
thing," the thoughtful, easy-mannered
back said. "I worked a lot on my quick
ness and agilty this summer through
drills and raquetball. In the past I was
just a straight-ahead runner."
"I think what's happening now is
Tommy is starting to realize his own
potential. And the system is a system
that is conducive to his abilities. I
think too, he's putting himself in the
kind of position where he can show
what kind of player he is," running
backs coach Tyrone Willingham said.
Perhaps the sports marketing
department had a hunch. They chose
Vardell in action to highlight this sea
son's football poster "Off and Run
ning." Or maybe it was just extra
incentive for Vardell.
Whether coincidence or motivation,
Vardell entered the season with much
more confidence and self-assurance
than before.
"Tommy's a lot more intense than

he has been in the past. He has much
more knowledgeable of the system. He
is a lot more knowledgable about what
it takes to play the level of football that
we expect out of all our young men,"
Willingham said.
Highlighting the improvement is a
new abilty to deceive opposing
linebackers and defensive backs. The
past two seasons the 6'2", 232-pound
back just ran over them.
Speed was never a problem. The
4.6-second 40-yard runner could hit
the hole quickly, it was just outmaneu
vering the oncoming defense.
Much can simply be attributed to
experience.
"In high school I was more shifty
but people weren't so fast. As a half
back in high school I thought I had the
moves, but I realized the high school
hip fakes were not going to make it."
His speed carried him through his

Tommy Vardell leads what some have called the most talented backfield in the Pac-10. He gets first downs. A lot of
them. He gets touchdowns. A lot of them. He is currently the most prolific scorer In the Pac-10, accounting for 10
Cardinal points per game.
