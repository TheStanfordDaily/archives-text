# Spikers hungry for wins

It's hard to say that Tuesday
night's loss to University of the
Pacific meant nothing in the big
picture, but it didn't.
While the Stanford women's
volleyball team may lose the
respect of some volleyball poll
sters or some future bragging
rights, the Cardinal (6-2, 3-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play) still
retains a steady attitude, a strong
crowd of fans and one of the most
talented lineups in the country.
The team will have a chance to
validate these contentions when it
travels to Tucson to play the Ari
zona Wildcats tonight at 7:30 and
then to Tempe to challenge Ari
zona State University tomorrow.
The Cardinal begins the desert
road trip after consecutive losses
to No. 3 UOP and No. 1 UCLA.
Memories of Stanford's flaw
less 1990 start have been all but

forgotten amid these home-court
defeats. Frustration has taken a
little toll, but the Cardinal is
intent to focus ahead.
"We're ready to play," senior
co-captain Jessica Benton said.
"We're more inspired [because of
the losses]."
Stanford has a right to be.
They may not have anything to
show for their weekend efforts,
but the Cardinal let two nation
ally-ranked teams know they were
for real. Sophomore Bev Oden and
company gave UCLA a lesson in
Lead-Sitting 101 Saturday after
winning game three despite a 7-0
deficit. UOP found out that serv
ing like a team possessed is still
not enough to shut the Cardinal
down.
"I like where we are right
now," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "Our ranking really doesn't
matter. The important thing is
that we keep growing together as
a team. I like our chances. We still

haven't peaked."
Hardly comforting thoughts
for Arizona, the team the Cardinal
just may peak against. The No. 16
Wildcats have had a tough enough
time of it already. Picked by many
to be among the Pac-10's elite,
Arizona started poorly, losing to
lowly Washington State and drop
ping its first two conference
matches of the year.
Shaw remains wary of the Ari
zona arsenal, however. "They're a
good home team," Shaw said.
"They certainly have the talent to
match up with anyone."
That talent comes primarily in
the person of outside hitter Terry
Lauchner. The 5-foot-11 senior
led Arizona in kills last season
with 441. She continues to power
this season as she remains among
the Pac-10's kills leaders.
The Wildcats are also looking
to get well soon. Much of their dif-
