# Women try to boot No. 1
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The game has been moved up to 10 a.m. to
accommodate football tailgaters and the Beach
Boys, but the Stanford women's soccer team
shouldn't have to sing "California Dreaming"
to attract a big crowd for tomorrow's Maloney
Field showdown with top-ranked Santa Clara.
"It's like a playoff game for us," said Stan
ford coach Berhane Andeberhan. "We know
they are stronger, but we know we can beat
them."
No. 11 Stanford and No. 1 Santa Clara will
square off in a bout for regional bragging
rights and a claim to postseason play Stanford
enters with a 7-1 record, while the Broncos are
a perfect 9-0, having allowed only two goals all
season.
Santa Clara is riding the crest of soccer star
dom. Coach Jerry Smith's squad finished last
year ranked third after losing to Colorado Col
lege in the NCAA semifinals. And now along
with the women, the Santa Clara men's team is
ranked at the top, the first time ever that a uni
versity haß had its men and women ranked No.
1 in soccer at the same time.
The Bronco women attained the top spot
last week when perennial power North Car
olina lost for the first time since 1986. This will
be the second game against the No. 1 team in
the nation in as many years for Stanford. Last
year the Cardinal tied top-ranked North Car
olina, one of only six games the Tar Heels tied
during their 106-game unbeaten streak.
Wednesday at Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Sta
dium, the Bronco women edged California 2-1,
despite trailing in the first half. Santa Clara
overcame a freak first half goal scored when a
sliding Bronco defender knocked in the ball for
the Golden Bears.
But in the second stanza, Santa Clara
scored on a breakaway goal and a penalty kick
by senior forward Brandi Chastain, the team's
scoring leader.
Chastain has scored 13 goals this year and
has tallied the winning score in each of Santa
Clara's last four games.
Stopping Chastain and the blitzkrieg Santa
Clara offense will be the key to a Stanford vic
tory. "Their forwards are really potent," said
Andeberhan. "Santa Clara is quick and skilled
at every position. They are very fast — some
times too fast. We have to insist on playing our
own pace."
Junior defenders Michele Sullivan and
Kerry Stivaletti will draw the difficult duty of
marking Chastain and forward Monica Mur
nane, a graduate of Palo Alto High School.
They will be joined by junior fullback Heather
Mclntyre on the defensive lines
before goalie Elise Edwards.
"On paper it is a strong match
up," said Andeberhan. "We trust
them (Sullivan and Stivaletti) and
we think they'll do a good job."
Stivaletti doesn't need the
scouting report on Chastain's
scoring — tney played together

for two years at Mitty High
School in San Jose.
And if Chastain does wiggle by
Stanford's blanket defense, goalie
Edwards is a formidable last line
of defense. "We clearly have a
superior goalie," said Andeber
han.
"We'll have no special scheme
defensively," Edwards said. "But I
know they have some good scor
ers — especially Brandi Chastain.
"We know we have the ability,"
Edwards continued. "We try to go

one game at a time, and in that
respect Santa Clara is just
another game. But they are num
ber one right now, and that is
really good for us all (West Coast
teams)."
Santa Clara and Stanford
know each other well, so there
will be few surprises on Saturday.
Some Broncos have played for
Andeberhan on national teams.

Last year at Buck Shaw Sta

quick Bronco scoring barrage
and lost 4-3. The Cardinal
entered the game ranked No. 10
with a 6-1 record against the 6-2
Broncos, but Santa Clara scored
three goals in the first 20 minutes
and escaped with a 4-3 win.
Andeberhan said the team is
working on its team defense and
offensive pace in preparation for
the Broncos. "I want to avoid the
temptation for over-coaching. We
are improving steadily and we
can't be pre-occupied with what
the other team is going to do.
We'll make adjustments as the
game goes on.
"We really don't want to want
to worry about the score so much
— just get everything into per
spective, settle down, and play,"
Andeberhan continued. "We'll try
to stay on an even plane. We don't
really need to get pumped up —
this is already a highly motivated
team.
