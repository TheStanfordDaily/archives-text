# Women try to boot No. 1

The game has been moved up to 10 a.m. to
accommodate football tailgaters and the Beach
Boys, but the Stanford women's soccer team
shouldn't have to sing "California Dreaming"
to attract a big crowd for tomorrow's Maloney
Field showdown with top-ranked Santa Clara.
"It's like a playoff game for us," said Stan
ford coach Berhane Andeberhan. "We know
they are stronger, but we know we can beat
them."
No. 11 Stanford and No. 1 Santa Clara will
square off in a bout for regional bragging
rights and a claim to postseason play Stanford
enters with a 7-1 record, while the Broncos are
a perfect 9-0, having allowed only two goals all
season.
Santa Clara is riding the crest of soccer star
dom. Coach Jerry Smith's squad finished last
year ranked third after losing to Colorado Col
lege in the NCAA semifinals. And now along
with the women, the Santa Clara men's team is
ranked at the top, the first time ever that a uni
versity haß had its men and women ranked No.
1 in soccer at the same time.
The Bronco women attained the top spot
last week when perennial power North Car
olina lost for the first time since 1986. This will
be the second game against the No. 1 team in
the nation in as many years for Stanford. Last
year the Cardinal tied top-ranked North Car
olina, one of only six games the Tar Heels tied
during their 106-game unbeaten streak.
Wednesday at Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Sta
dium, the Bronco women edged California 2-1,
despite trailing in the first half. Santa Clara
overcame a freak first half goal scored when a
sliding Bronco defender knocked in the ball for
the Golden Bears.
But in the second stanza, Santa Clara
scored on a breakaway goal and a penalty kick
by senior forward Brandi Chastain, the team's
scoring leader.
Chastain has scored 13 goals this year and
has tallied the winning score in each of Santa
Clara's last four games.
Stopping Chastain and the blitzkrieg Santa
Clara offense will be the key to a Stanford vic
tory. "Their forwards are really potent," said
Andeberhan. "Santa Clara is quick and skilled
at every position. They are very fast — some
times too fast. We have to insist on playing our
own pace."
Junior defenders Michele Sullivan and
Kerry Stivaletti will draw the difficult duty of
marking Chastain and forward Monica Mur
nane, a graduate of Palo Alto High School.
They will be joined by junior fullback Heather
