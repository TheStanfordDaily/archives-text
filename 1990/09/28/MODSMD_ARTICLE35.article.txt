# Cardinal faces tough field in home tourney
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
While it certainly is not nearly
as prestigious as the NCAA tour
nament, the NorCal Water Polo
Tournament, which will be held
this weekend at Stanford, cer

tainly boasts a field that would be
worthy of a national champi
onship.
Twelve of the nation's top fif
teen teams are entered in the
three-day, 16-team tournament,
including eight of the top nine

teams. No. 1 ranked California
will be there, defending national
champion UC-Irvine will be there,
and, yes, the No. 3 ranked Stan
ford Cardinal team will be there.
Because of the way the tourna
ment is set up, the Cardinal team,

which is 8-2 on the year, will not
get the chance to avenge either
one of its losses. Stanford will not
face Cal this weekend, and No. 2
ranked UCLA is not entered in
the tournament.
Nevertheless, Stanford is
eagerly looking forward to the
tournament.
"We've had a long break since
our last big tournament," senior
Chuck Maguy said, "And we're
really excited to be back playing
against the best teams in the
country."
Since Stanford will not play
either Cal or UCLA, the two
teams ranked ahead of the Cardi
nal, the team won't move up in
the rankings. However, the tour
nament is still crucial for the
team.
Maguy explained: "If we win
every game we play, that would go
a long way to separating us from
the rest of the teams in the coun
try. But if we lose a game to a
team that is ranked below us,
then there would be some ques
tion about how good we really
are."
If the Cardinal continues to
play as well it has so far this year,
the team stands a great chance of
proving just how good this year's
team is.
As Coach Dante Dettamanti
said, "If we play consistently
throughout the tournament and
remain focused in each game, we
should do just fine."
In addition, the tournament
will also help the team in another
way. "This tournament will give
us the opportunity to refine our
overall game before the league
season begins," Dettamanti said.
One area that certainly hasn't
needed much work so far this year
has been the offense. The Cardi
nal are averaging 11 goals a game,

a very high number, and there
have only been two games — a win
over UC-Santa Barbara and the
loss to UCLA — in which the team
has not managed to score 10 goals.
Dettamanti is very pleased
with the offensive output. "Our
offense in general has been very
good so far. We have a good fast
break and some really good out
side shooters. Basically, we have a
lot of guys who know how to
score."
Doing most of the scoring for
the Cardinal has been senior Greg
Olson, who has eighteen goals.
Close behind Olson are two
time second-team All-American
Rick McNair with sixteen goals,
Maguy with fourteen, and senior
Colin Keely with twelve.
In all, eighteen different play
ers have scored at least one goal
for the explosive Cardinal attack.
The defense has also been
effective, and Dettamanti feels
that defense will ultimately be the
key to the team's success.
"We're breaking in two new
goalies [freshman Larry Bercutt
and junior Jim Cairns], so we
can't rely on the goalie to stop the
other team like we could when we
had the luxury of having a [four
time All-American] Todd Kemp in
goal."
Stanford plays its first game of
the three-day tournament today
at 8 a.m. against Cal State-Los
Angeles.
At 2 p.m., the Cardinal will face
perhaps their toughest opponent
of the tournament, UC-Santa
Barbara. On Saturday at 11 a.m.,
the Cardinal take on Pepperdine,
followed by a 4 p.m. game against
UC-Irvine.
Stanford will wrap up the tour
nament Sunday against Brown at
12 p.m. and against Fresno St. at
6 p.m.
