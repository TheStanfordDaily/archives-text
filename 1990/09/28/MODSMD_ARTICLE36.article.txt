That's how men's soccer Coach
Colin Lindores has described
this up coming weekend's
matches. The 3-2-4 Cardinal
will square off against San
Diego State today at 2:30 p.m.
And Sept. 30, the No. 3-ranked
UCLA Bruins will saunter into
town.
"We are a team on the bub
ble," explains Lindores. "We can
play good against the good and
bad against the bad."
Lindores' claim seems to be
backed up by the Cardinal's play
this season. The Stanford men
have tied No. 1-ranked Santa
Clara and No. 2-ranked
Evansville. However, the Stan
ford squad nearly lost to a
sloppy St. Mary's team, but sur
vived to earn a tie because of
excellent play in the net by goal
keeper Kyle Krpata.
Today's match against San
Diego State could be another
potential St. Mary's game. "San
Diego has had a big turn over in

personel," Lindores says. "They
are a team that doesn't have a
great deal of talent, but they are
hard working. It may not be a
very attractive game."
On the other hand, Sunday's
game against UCLA looks to be
quite attractive. The Bruins will
bring with them nine players on
the U.S. National team.
"The match will be like two
good boxers in the first couple of
rounds," says Lindores. "We will
be stalking and feeling each
other out."
Midfielder Jim Talluto, who
has received four yellow cards
this season, slightly disagrees.
He claims that it will be nothing
close to the violent side of box
ing: "No more yellow cards for
the rest of the year. I'm
reformed."
Even though the Cardinal
only has one U.S. National
player, Rhett Harty, compared
to UCLA's nine, Talluto still
feels as though his fellow team
mates can do the job. "We might
not match up with them man
for man, but we play just as well
as them as a team."

This confidence can largely
be attributed to Lindores' the
ory about coaching. "This soccer
team has its strengths and
weaknesses just like every other
team," he explains. "It is like a
puzzle. You have to make all the
jagged edges fit in place, and
that is my job."
Whether or not all the jagged
edges are hidden within the
framework of the team, the Car
dinal need to win this after
noon's game as well as Sunday's
UCLA game. "These two this
weekend are the most impor
tant," explains Talluto. "These
are the two teams we need to
beat to get over the hump in
order to gain some respect."
With the help of some key
players, Stanford will be able to
jump over the hump. With Tal
luto and forward Lance Killian,
each with ten points, Stanford
looks to have plenty of scoring
this weekend. On the other end
of the field, if keeper Krpata can
turn in performances like he did
against St. Mary's, Lindores will
see few balls enter his net, and
his puzzle will fit together.
