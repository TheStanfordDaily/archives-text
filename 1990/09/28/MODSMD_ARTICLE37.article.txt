# Andy Geiger kicks off Greeks; picks Maryland
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
This week marks the return of
what we here at The Daily call
"The Greek." It's when several
sports staffers get together and
try to predict the outcome of the
ever-unpredictable world of col
lege football.
As usual, we have a guest prog
nosticator this week and it's none
other than outgoing Athletic
Director Andy Geiger. The man
who has bled Cardinal red for the
past several years is off to Mary
land where, after a transfusion, he
will no doubt bleed Terrapin black
and gold. Or something like that.
This week's selections have
Cameron Macky, perhaps The
Daily's most recognizable campus
personality, taking an early lead in
the school spirit race by picking
Air San Jose to take down the Car
dinal tomorrow.
Macky, a known consumer of
crow, will not be sacked for his
selection this week — but he has
been warned about making simi
lar picks in the future.
Geiger, who promises his loy
alty to Stanford will remain
strong even during the cold and
snow of East Coast winters,

picked both his present and future
schools. While the sentiment is
charming, it seems unlikely Mary- 1
land will take down Michigan and
sophomore sensation Jon Vaughn.
The tailback has rushed for nearly
500 yards in the past two weeks
alone.
The toss-ups on this week's
agenda include the contest
between Washington and Col
orado in Boulder. The Buffaloes
have been less than spectacular so
far and the Huskies are coming off
a shocking shellacking of thought
to-be-mighty use.
UCLA visits Eastern Washing
ton to take on Washington State
in another hard to figure contest.
The Cougars are better than
expected; UCLA is worse than
expected. If the Bruins are going
to get on track for 1990, now is
probably the time.
National championship-con
tender Brigham Young faces off
with Oregon — another quality
Pacific 10 Conference team with
little national recognition. Heis
man, er Ty, Detmer has rolled up
almost 1,500 yards passing in
three games.
If Arizona State loses to Mis
souri, it will be a big shock to the
Greeks here.
