# Women linksters favored
## 
### Noah Blake 
The Cardinal women's golf
team, ranked No. 3 in the NCAA
preseason poll, is poised to kick
off their season at the Dick
McGuire Invitational in Albu
querque, New Mexico. This com
petition, which runs today
through Sunday, is the first of
the ten major tournaments in
which the linksters will compete
this season.
The team should feel right at
home in New Mexico, where
they play this same tournament
annually. As Cardinal head
coach Tim Baldwin puts it,"The
girls know the course, and it's in
really great shape."
In team golf competition, a

squad has five golfers who play,
but only the best four rounds of
the day count toward the team's
overall score. Stanford, however,
will be represented this weekend
by only four golfers in the fol
lowing rank: 1) Jodi Figley; 2)
Stephanie Davis; 3) Audrey
Wooding; and 4) Adele Moore.
(One player had to stay on the
Farm to get settled academically
and Martha Richards returned
to basketball, that other sport
she plays pretty well).
Thus, missing that very
important fifth linkster, the
team will not only be unable to
drop their worst round every
day, but also will be eliminated
from the tournament if someone
gets hurt and is unable to play.

"Our starters have got to stay
healthy," Baldwin says,
"because we have no depth."
On paper, it looks like the
team should win, as it has the
best national ranking of the six
teen teams entered in the tour
nament field, which includes
No. 9 Texas, SMU, TCU, and
New Mexico State. But a bad
round or an injury could seri
ously hurt the Cardinal's
chances, whereas another team
with five golfers would be virtu
ally unaffected by these events.
Baldwin, however, has unwaver
ing confidence in his squad. "I'm
anticipating a very strong per
formance from my top four
golfers."
