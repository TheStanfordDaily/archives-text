Stanford's Centennial Celebration is heading into
the home stretch as the festivities enter the last of
six years Sunday.
Organizers said the culmination of the event will
emphasize students and education. "This isn't a
frivolous celebration," said Stephen Peeps, executive
director of the Centennial Celebration. "Unlike some
other institutions who've had milestone anniver
saries, we've planned this Centennial to illustrate
what universities can do," he said.
The Centennial Office has "consciously planned
this year to focus upon teaching, learning, the fac
ulty and students," he said.
Bucking the tradition in commencements — in
which the faculty are known as "the honored guests"
— the program for Sunday's celebration calls the
students the "honored guests."
"The students will realize this year is about
them," Peeps said.
Sunday's events will include:
• The Junior Convocation, specially scheduled to
coincide with the Centennial, which will take place
in Memorial Auditorium at noon.
• A convocation for new students in Frost
Amphitheater at 1 p.m. The senior class will lead the
freshmen, transfers and new graduate students in a
full academic processional starting at the new Ford
Athletic Center and ending at Frost.
University President Donald Kennedy will wel
come the entering students. Two Stanford graduates
— Brown University President Vartan Gregorian
and the world's first black woman astronaut, Mae
Jemison — will deliver keynote addresses.
Gregorian and Jemison "reflect the intercultural
and international character of the University," Peeps
said.
All University students are invited, and special
invitations were sent out to all University employ
ees. Peeps estimated an audience of 4,000 employ
ees, parents and others from the community.
• A postal card dedication ceremony in the Inner
Quad at 3 p.m., featuring U.S.
Postmaster General Anthony
Frank and California Senator
Pete Wilson, the Republican nom
inee for California's governor.
Wilson's wife, Gayle, is a Stanford
alumna.
Stanford alumna Dianne
Feinstein, former San Francisco
mayor and Democratic nominee
for governor of California, was
invited to speak along with Wil
son but could not attend because
of a scheduling conflict.
Ten million of the cards -
designed by area resident Jim
McGuinness - will be distributed
to 38,000 post offices nationwide
but will not be sold until Monday.
Special hand-stamped "first day
of issue" cards can be purchased
after the formal ceremonies Sun
day.
• An evening of entertainment
starting at 7 p.m. with the annual
Freshman Talent Show in Memo
rial Auditorium.
The talent show will be fol
lowed by the 8:30 p.m. debut of

"Stanford: A Place in History," a
15-minute multimedia produc
tion produced by two Stanford
students for the Centennial. The
slides will be shown on a 15-by
-20-foot screen in the Inner Quad.
Concluding the celebration will
be a fireworks display in the Oval
at 9 p.m.
According to Peeps, the logis
tics of organizing the celebration
have been immense. He joked,
"It's approaching the complexity
of Operation Desert Shield," the
U.S. military operation in Saudi
Arabia.
Twenty-five staff members
from six departments have been
planning the details of the cele
bration for the past month, Peeps
said.
Peeps said the people involved
in planning Sunday's festivities
are "exhausted," but realize this
is only the beginning of a year of
Centennial events.
Central to the 1990-91 year
are three quarterly Centennial
Symposia. According to the Cen
tennial Office, each Symposium
will focus on "a contemporary
issue or force that will contribute
to reshaping world definitions in
years to come."

The programs, which will fea
ture professors, scientists and
other academics from Stanford
and around the world, will exam
ine "The Information Explosion,"
"The Human Genome" and "Eth
nicity, Equity and the Environ
ment."
Multicultural issues will also
feature prominently in the Cen
tennial events, highlighted by
four "Multicultural Celebra
tions." They will focus upon the
Stanford American Indian Orga
nization's 20th anniversary,
Black Liberation Month, Asian
Pacific Heritage Month and the
Chicano/Latino community's
Cinco de Mayo fiesta.
The year will be capped off by a
"Finale Weekend" — Sept. 28 to
Oct.l, 1991— which is expected
to draw 10,000 alumni. It will
feature a parade down University
and Palm Drive, a dinner in the
Oval for 8,000 to 10,000 alumni,
and a "Stanford Stadium Spectac
ular" which will be designed to
attract 50,000 paying guests with
an as-yet undetermined show.
Stanford's Centennial Celebra
tion started with the hundredth
anniversary of the founding of the
University in 1985-
