Stanford's Centennial Celebration is heading into
the home stretch as the festivities enter the last of
six years Sunday.
Organizers said the culmination of the event will
emphasize students and education. "This isn't a
frivolous celebration," said Stephen Peeps, executive
director of the Centennial Celebration. "Unlike some
other institutions who've had milestone anniver
saries, we've planned this Centennial to illustrate
what universities can do," he said.
The Centennial Office has "consciously planned
this year to focus upon teaching, learning, the fac
ulty and students," he said.
Bucking the tradition in commencements — in
which the faculty are known as "the honored guests"
— the program for Sunday's celebration calls the
students the "honored guests."
"The students will realize this year is about
them," Peeps said.
Sunday's events will include:
• The Junior Convocation, specially scheduled to
coincide with the Centennial, which will take place
in Memorial Auditorium at noon.
• A convocation for new students in Frost
Amphitheater at 1 p.m. The senior class will lead the
freshmen, transfers and new graduate students in a
full academic processional starting at the new Ford
Athletic Center and ending at Frost.
University President Donald Kennedy will wel
come the entering students. Two Stanford graduates
— Brown University President Vartan Gregorian
and the world's first black woman astronaut, Mae
Jemison — will deliver keynote addresses.
Gregorian and Jemison "reflect the intercultural
and international character of the University," Peeps
said.
All University students are invited, and special
invitations were sent out to all University employ
ees. Peeps estimated an audience of 4,000 employ
ees, parents and others from the community.
