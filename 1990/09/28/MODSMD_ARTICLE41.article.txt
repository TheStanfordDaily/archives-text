### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
Gurmeet S. Shergill, a 36-year
old honors graduate student in
engineering, was fatally stabbed
Sunday evening outside his Sun
nyvale home, police said yester
day.
Three youths followed Shergill
home after an argument in a
McDonald's restaurant on El
Camino Real and Bernardo
Avenue, Sunnyvale police said.
Police said about half an hour
passed before the suspects,
described as three Latino men
between the ages of 16 and 20,
attacked and stabbed Shergill as
he got out of his car.
Sunnyvale Police Capt. James
Brice was in the restaurant when
the argument broke out. Brice
said he heard Shergill ask the
youths, who were in front of him
in line, to place their order.

Shergill died of stab wounds to
the chest and abdomen on the way
to Valley Medical Center.
Shergill had been enrolled in a
co-operative program at Stanford
in which he both took courses for
his master's degree and worked as
a research engineer at Intel Cor
poration, according to Robert Sin
clair, professor of materials sci
ence and engineering and
Shergill's advisor.
He had been enrolled at Stan
ford as a part-time student since
the spring quarter of 1987 and
was considering becoming a full
time student, Sinclair said.
Sinclair described Shergill as
"a very quiet individual, the sort
of person you wouldn't expect to
get into that situation."
Witnesses were able to describe
the suspects' car as a grey or light
blue compact. Police said yester
day they had not yet identified
any suspects.
