## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate voted
yesterday to create an interdis
ciplinary honors program in
Jewish Studies.
Students meyoring in any
area will be able to pursue an
honors distinction by complet
ing 25 units of related course
work and writing a thesis.
Currently, students wishing
to in Jewish Studies may
do so by applying to the Indi
vidually Designed Majors Com
mittee. The Program in Jewish

Studies itself does not grant
degrees.
At yesterday's meeting,
Business School Prof. Eugene
Webb questioned the necessity
of creating an honors program
in Jewish Studies, noting only
four students have mtyored in
the field since 1982.
Separately, the senate
approved a six-year extension
of the Symbolic Systems Pro
gram's authority to grant
degrees. The Committee on
Undergraduate Studies had
recommended an eight-year
extension.
