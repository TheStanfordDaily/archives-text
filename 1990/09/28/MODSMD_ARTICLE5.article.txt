# Snapshots of Stanford
## Multimedia show debuts Sunday 
### Steve Mitzenmacher 
Discovering the essence of under
graduate life at Stanford takes most
students four or five years.
But senior Michael Topolovac and
recent graduate Ken Beer have tried
to condense the process to a mere 18
minutes.
The result of their year-long

attempt to capture the undergraduate
experience is "Stanford: A Place In
History," a striking and poignant mul
timedia production, which premieres
Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. in the Inner
Quad as part of Stanford's Centennial
Celebration.
The production includes a show of
500 slides chosen out of a group of
25,000 portraying a spectrum of

scenes from the Farm and is set to the
songs of student musical groups.
And even University President
Donald Kennedy plays a role, as nar
rator of the presentation.
The show moves quickly, using six
computer-controlled slide projectors,
with many images blurring to create

Senior Michael Topolovac and recent graduate Ken Beer stand against the backdrop for their multimedia slide show
on Stanford, which will debut Sunday night in the Quad. The show is narrated by University President Donald
Kennedy.
an illusion of moving pictures
from the still photographs.
Four main themes dominate
the presentation — the intensity,
diversity, anxiety, and unity of the
University.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions has decided to show a
videotaped version of the produc
tion at its presentations around
the country for prospective fresh
man.
Beer and Topolovac admit
their biggest challenge was the
severe time constraint.
"It's pretty hard as it is to try
to capture Stanford in any
amount of minutes," Topolovac
said.
"The reason we did this show
and what made this show special
is that it was done totally on stu
dent initiative," Topolovac said.
The soundtrack features only
the work of Stanford students.
Several Stanford musical groups
recorded songs, including the
Mendicants, Everyday People,

Mixed Company and 3rd and
Beale. In addition, junior Mike
Halaas composed and performed
an original piano piece.
Both describe the production
process of the show as very time
consuming. "For the last three
months, all I have done is live the
show," Beer said.
Topolovac is quick to point out
the difficulty of using a single
word to define all the show means
to him. "I am reluctant to say a
word because the show is so many
things," he said.
The pair is also quite excited by
the Undergraduate Admissions
Office's decision.
"On a broad level, it is a fair
and accurate representation of
the school," Beer said.
According to Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Jean Fetter,
professionally produced videos
can cost over $60,000.
"You could go out to a big
audio-visual firm and spend
oodles of money producing a show
that would technically be really
sexy and look neat," Topolovac
said. "But it could not capture the
essence of the place."
