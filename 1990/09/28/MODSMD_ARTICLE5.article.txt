## Multimedia show debuts Sunday 
### Steve Mitzenmacher 
Discovering the essence of under
graduate life at Stanford takes most
students four or five years.
But senior Michael Topolovac and
recent graduate Ken Beer have tried
to condense the process to a mere 18
minutes.
The result of their year-long

attempt to capture the undergraduate
experience is "Stanford: A Place In
History," a striking and poignant mul
timedia production, which premieres
Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. in the Inner
Quad as part of Stanford's Centennial
Celebration.
The production includes a show of
500 slides chosen out of a group of
25,000 portraying a spectrum of

scenes from the Farm and is set to the
songs of student musical groups.
And even University President
Donald Kennedy plays a role, as nar
rator of the presentation.
The show moves quickly, using six
computer-controlled slide projectors,
with many images blurring to create
