# Stanford top water offender
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Stanford was the Peninsula's
number one offender in failing to
reduce water use, according to a
report last week.
Statistics released by the San
Jose Mercury News listed the Uni
versity as using 13 percent more
water in this drought-stricken
year than in 1987.
But University officials dis
count these statistics and believe
they are making efforts to
increase conservation.
Although conservation in some
nearby areas failed to meet tar
geted reductions, the report
showed Stanford as the only com
munity posting a net increase in
water use.
In one positive note in the
report, Stanford used 15 percent
less water this August than in
August 1987 â€” a possible sign
that conservation measures are
taking effect.
But even August's usage level
was too high, according to a San
Francisco water official. Norm
Lougee, manager of resources and
planning at the San Francisco
Water Department, said Stanford
received a $42,000 penalty last
month for drawing more water
than it was allotted.
Relations between the Univer
sity and the water department
remain good, Lougee said. He
added that San Francisco was not
concerned about Stanford's year
to-date water use because
rationing did not begin until May
8.
