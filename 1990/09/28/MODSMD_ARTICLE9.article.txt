# SEC chair lectures on history of S&L crisis
## 
### Doug Miro 
Richard C. Breeden, chair of
the Securities and Exchange Com
mission, sounded more like a pro
fessor than a politician in a speech
yesterday as he analyzed the his
tory of the current savings and
loan crisis.
In a speech entitled "America's

Financial Future," Breeden
stressed to a small crowd at the
Law School that the complex
problem needed to be investigated
carefully.
Breeden, who graduated from
Stanford in 1972, was invited to
speak at the Law School by former
SEC commissioner and Stanford
Law Prof. Joseph Grundfest.

Breeden designed the recent
S&L bailout bill, which is consid
ered the strongest bank legisla
tion in 50 years. While considered
by those familiar with the S&L
crisis to be an "arrogant fighter,"
many also feel his aggressive polit
ical style is a welcome change
from that of his predecessor,
David S. Ruder.

He spoke only on the history of
the savings and loan industry
problem, often writing figures and
graphs on the blackboard.
But even under persistent
questioning from the audience,
Breeden did not explain what he
intends to do about the problem.
He noted the problem started
in the early 1970s and was not
addressed because of a "close rela
tionship between lobbyists and
regulating industries." This close
relationship allowed the accoun
tants of these thrift institutions
huge leeway, Breeden explained.
"The government's response to
the problem was always to change
the accounting rules in order to
make the banks look better, not
actually be better," he said.
Breeden also mentioned the
possibility of academic investiga
tion into the S&L problem. After
making several of his major
points, he often said, "This is an
area that deserves more academic
pursuit."
He compared the bank accoun
tants to alchemists because they
were able under the relaxed regu
lations to create the illusion that
their banks were solvent. Because
of this illusion, the banks did not
lose the support of the • Federal
Deposit Insurance Commission
and the government ended up
insuring grossly insolvent institu
tions.
He also cited the other govern
mental error that he believes
brought on the crisis — low capi
tal requirements. He said he
began to rectify this problem in
the bailout bill.
