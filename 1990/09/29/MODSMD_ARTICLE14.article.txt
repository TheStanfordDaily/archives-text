The Stanford offense has been
off and running this year, averag
ing 28.3 points per game via a
potent multiple-I, pro-set forma
tion. One of the masterminds
behind this successful system is
offensive coordinator Ron Turner.
Having previously served as
quarterbacks and receivers coach
under head coach Dennis Green at
Northwestern in 1981-82, Turner
came to Stanford, "anxious to
work for him again."
The feeling was mutual.
"Ron is an excellent coach,"
Green said. "As a head coach, you
look to have the most talented
assistant coaches as possible. Ron
is one of the most talented offen
sive coaches in the country."
Another reason he came to
Stanford was the academics.
"Stanford is one of the few school
that combine successful, big-time
sports with excellent academics,"
Turner said.
Coming here was a homecom
ing of sorts for Turner, who is
from the East Bay. He grew up a
Stanford fan, and is happy to be
on the Farm.
"I love it, and I'm glad to be
here," the second year coach said.
Coach Green brought to Stan
ford the short passing offense he
had learned as an assistant with
the San Francisco 49ers. It then
became Turner's job to implement
the system.

"It's a ball-control offense that
uses both the run and the pass,"
Turner said. "This is why it is so
successful. It also works because
it takes what the defense gives it."
Such was the case in the first
two games of the season.
"Colorado was doubling up on
our receivers, so we just concen
trated on throwing underneath,"
Turner said. "[I-formation} teams
are going to give us that, we'll
take it. UCLA tried to stop the
underneath passing, so we went
deep more often."
The key is good decision mak
ing, and Turner feels fortunate to
have that in junior quarterback
Jason Palumbis. "His strengths

are accuracy and decision making,
which perfect for the system,"
Turner said.
Another key for the team is Ed
McCaffrey, a preseason All-Amer
ica candidate at wide receiver.
"He is very important," Turner
said. "The system only works if
you have the weapons, and he has
the size, hands, and speed to get
open, and help his teammates get
open."
In addition to his coaching
duties, Turner also has the diffi
cult task of recruiting top players
to come to Stanford. "All of the
assistant coaches are good
recruiters," Turner said. "Each of
us has a geographic area to con
centrate on." His area is Southern
California and last year he was
instrumental in attracting Bob
Whitfield, considered the best
offensive lineman in the country
at the time.
Recruiting can be difficult at
Stanford, because of the academic
requirements. "We eliminate
about 75 percent of our prospects
just on academics," the coach said.
Once he gets past that, though,
the excellent academics actually
become a positive factor.
"When we find a student-ath
lete who is highly motivated in the
classroom, it isn't hard to get him
interested in Stanford," Turner
said. "I remember when I would
recruit for USC. Whenever it
came down to a battle with Stan
ford, we knew we were in trou
ble."
Turner played football himself
as a physical education major at
Pacific.
