# Harty plays with unusually high expectations

As evidenced by the rather
unspectacular records marked up
over the past few years, the Stan
ford men's soccer program has
been stuck in the doldrums.
Although many observers have
predicted that this year would be
nothing more than another disap
pointment for the Cardinal, junior
standout Rhett Harty disagrees.
"We are definitely surprising
Coach Colin (Lindores) because
he thought that this would be a
rebuilding year," Harty said.
"However, the players on our
team think that we can make the
playoffs."
In the past, Cardinal squads
have had ample individual talent
but lacked the team chemistry
necessary to be successful at the
national level. However, Harty
feels the 1990 soccer team is much
more cohesive. He attributes this
unity to the fact that many of the
players have played together for
over a year. He also believes that
of all the other Stanford teams on
which he has played, the 1990
men's soccer team has by far the
best attitude.
Harty says that a mqjor reason
for the team's recent success is
the "new blood" that first-year
coach, Lindores, has pumped into
the program. Lindores has been
coaching at the national level
since 1976, currently as an assis

tant coach to the men's under-23
national team.
In just a few months, Lindores
has attempted to teach his young
players the importance of playing
soccer intelligently.
"Everyone at the major college
level has about the same skill
level," Harty said. "The difference
between a good team and a great
team is that the members of the
great team are much more tacti
cally aware than their counter
parts."
Harty says that every time the
members of this year's team step
on the field, they become more
aware of what it takes to win close
games. On Sunday night, the
men's soccer team pulled off a 5-2
overtime victory against UNLY
the 13 th ranked team in the coun
try, to up their record to 3-2-4.
Contrary to outsiders' expecta
tions, almost everyone on the
team agrees that the Cardinal will
have a good chance of making the
playoffs if they continue to play as
aggressively and intelligently as
they did against UNLV
"He [Lindores] is able to teach
you something without being
overly negative, which is very
important, especially to young
players," Harty said.
Lindores has made several
changes that he hopes will enable
this year's team to improve. Most
significantly, he decided to move
Harty from midfield to defense.

For most of this year, Harty has
been doing his best to adapt to a
new position.
Although for the past two years
Harty was the team's leading
scorer, Lindores decided that he

could be more effective elsewhere.
The coach thought that it would
be better for the team if Harty
became the team's "marking
back", meaning his job is to
shadow the opposition's best

offensive player. Harty has no
qualms about playing a new posi
tion; "I am willing to do almost
anything necessary to help our
