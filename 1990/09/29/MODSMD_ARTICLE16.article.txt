# Historic rivalry begins to make some noise
## 
### Michael Clayton Editorial staff 
Every Northern Californian
football fan realizes that today's
South Bay Showdown does not,
and will not, compare with any
Big Game. However, in the past
few years, the quiet rivalry
between San Jose State and Stan
ford has started to make a little
more noise.

Prior to the 1980s, the only
uncertainty that gamblers had to
face about this game was whether
a betting line would be offered.
Stanford outscored San Jose State
169-0 in the first five games of the
series, won the first 11 games and
frequently broke the 60-point bar
rier on the scoreboard. By 1980,
the Cardinal had won a total of 32
of the 37 games played, and any
Spartan victory, such as the 1971
upset of the Rose Bowl-bound
Cardinal, stood out as a major
shocker.
Current KCBS broadcaster
Bob Murphy has watched the
series from both sides of the
rivalry and has seen the matchup
evolve. In the early 19705, Mur
phy served as the Stanford sports
information director, and, by the
end of the decade, had moved to
the position of athletic director at
San Jose State. Murphy has been
involved in the broadcast of the
game for the past 25 years.
"It used to be that the only
thing to happen for Stanford

could be negative," Murphy said.
"When you look at the game now,
San Jose State has a great deal to
lose as well. They come into the
game fully expecting to win."

In the past 10 years, the Spar
tans have frequently left Stanford
Stadium with their success-ori
ented expectations fulfilled. The
two teams have split the last 10

games, and San Jose State has
recorded more victories in this
time span than in the previous 80
years. The Spartans have brought
a rather potent passing attack

onto the field and last year, for
example, racked up 40 points and
416 yards.
Off the field, the strong biparti
san support has recently become a
rather unique feature of this
rivalry. Unlike most Cardinal
home games in the past decade
where the visitors fill one small
section of the stadium, San Jose
State has brought a hefty crowd of
vocal, blue-and-yellow supporters
along with them. After the inau
gural matchup in 1900, the size
limitations of Spartan Stadium
have forced San Jose fans to travel
to Palo Alto to see the game. Only
recently have they been able to
make Stanford Stadium
unfriendly grounds for the Cardi
nal faithful.
"There's a great deal of interest
in the Bay Area," Stanford coach
Denny Green said. "With fans
evenly divided across the big
crowd, this is a good, old-fash
ioned Bay Area football game."
In fact, this football game
draws a crowd larger than most
conference games. With 58,000 at
the game last season, the South
Bay Showdown outdrew all of the
Pacific 10 Conference games at
Stanford Stadium except Big
Game. The Spartans' largest
crowd last season at Spartan Sta
dium, on the other hand, was a
measly 12,508. San Jose State
