# Dangers of the NoCal surf
## 
### 
In an attempt to elucidate
exactly what is happening on the
field during the halftime festivi
ties, The Cardinal Today is
pleased to offer a preview of
today's show. Sit back, have a
drink, and enjoy the truly incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching
Band.
In honor o.f our post-game
singers, the Stanford Band pre
sents ... Things You Should Not
Bring to the Beach.
Freshly returned from a pas
sionate session of off-track betting
in the Himalayas, LSJUMB
decided to chase away those back
to-school blues with a quick visit
to the Pacific Coast. While
unpacking its shore-supplies,
however, the Band discovered a
few suspicious items tucked away
between the surfboards, Hawaiian
shirts, and giant Annette Funic
cello cut-outs items that turned
a sea-savoring episode into a

heinous beach-trip from Hell.
After all, in the interest of public
safety, there are just some things
you shouldn't bring to the beach.
1) There certainly are better
things to make with latex, but
given Stanford's romantic reputa
tion, you can't blame local compa
nies that now sell rubber dorsal
fins. Strap one on, flail around in
the surf, and laugh aloud when all
your friends run out of the water,
shrieking in terror. Now also
available in special "Orca, the
Killer Whale" Model.
Song: "RubberbandMan"
2) Some people simply aren't
satisfied with a hole in the ozone
layer. Theft* "perfect tan"
demands as much solar radiation
as possible, so they demand sun
screen with SPF 1/8 guaran
teed to leave your skin charred
and blistered beyond recognition!
Unless you look forward to life as
a California Raisin, we suggest
you put the sunburn lotion back
on the shelf and continue your

pale and pasty existence in
Green's South Stacks.
Song: "Sunshine of Your
Love"
3) When you're happily resting
on warm sand, an unwanted injec
tion can completely ruin your day.
Sure, those rolling dunes look
serene, but they may contain a
painful hypodermic surprise.
Courtesy of careless medical
waste disposal, a pleasant jaunt to
the sea could leave you comfort
ably numb then again, it's just
a little pinprick.
Song: "White Punks on Dope"
4) Forgotten your Nerf drift
nets? Left your Hasbro Harpoons
at home? Don't worry! With the
new Exxon Valdez Kiddie
Boat, you can still irreparably
damage the environment and
have a great time. Just run it
aground on the nearest sand bar
and watch the fun. (Crude oil,
alcoholic captain, and fragile
ecosystems sold separately).
