Joke about the big hair. Joke
about the low athletic graduation
rate and its status as a "commuter
school." Joke and make fun of the
school all you want.
Just don't mess with their foot
ball team.
The Stanford-San Jose rivalry
traditionally is seen by most stu
dents as a gimme win, and the 36-
9-1 advantage that the Cardinal
holds does not do much to dispute
that view. The problem is that
Stanford has lost two out of the
last three years, and the teams are
5-5 in the last 10.
It seems that recently San Jose
has forgotten that it is supposed
to lose.
"We look at this game as a chal
lenge that we have to meet," Spar
tans' Head Coach Terry Shea said.
"From our standpoint we can't
deviate from our goal: We want to
win our conference and win the
California bowl. We have been
playing well lately, and we are just
taking it one game at a time."
Not really words of fear, but
after lying Lousville and losing to
Washington by just a field goal,
the Spartans can not exactly be
called a bad team. In fact, they are
a very good team, and they are
ready for this weekend.
"At this point I feel really posi
tive the way the team has gelled,"
Shea said. "We have a really
upbeat, positive flow. I feel (San
Jose State) is pretty darn excit

With the seventh ranked
defense in the country, and a full
back who rushed for 1,201 yards
last year, it is hard to disagree.
The Spartans have limited their
opponents to only 11 yards rush
ing the last two games, and for the
season have allowed 105 yards per
game. The interesting thing is
that San Jose has accomplished
this without being very big (their
line averages about 260 pounds).
But they do have one key thing

going for them.
"I think San Jose compares
with Colorado in terms of their
speed and quickness," Cardinal
offensive tackle Darran Baird
said. "We need to concentrate on
staying on people and not letting
people roam free. We need to play
a lot of assignment football."
"Most of the teams we play will
have some size advantage ," Shea
said. "I know that Stanford has a
large offensive line, but not that
much bigger than Washington. We
rely on our speed and quickness.
We have been strong on the run all
year, and the Stanford game won't
be any different."
Stanford is not too shabby in
the running department either,
but Denny Green knows his mul
tiple-I, pro-set offense will have to
work for every yard.
"We know it will be a tough
game," Green said. "It is impor
tant for us to play like we played
our last three games. They have
been physical games; what we
have to do is play this game the
same way."
Hoping to muscle their way
past the Spartans will be the
potent Cardinal offense. Sopho
more Glyn Milburn is ranked
third in the Pacific 10 Conference
and 15 th in the nation in all-pur
pose yards with 152.0 per game.
Last week, he had 113 yards rush
ing on 20 attempts. Complement
ing Milburn is Tommy Vardell,
who is averaging 4.1 yards a carry,
and leads the Pac-10 in scoring at
10 points a game via five touch
downs.
The Cardinal presents oppo
nents with a balanced offensive
attack, which is evidenced by their
average of 175 rushing yards and
172 passing yards. This is a
marked contrast from last year
when the team averaged 90 yards
on the ground and 237 in the air
but does not mean the Cardinal is
lacking for a passing attack this
year.
All-America candidate Ed Mc-
Caffrey continues to impress
opposing secondaries with his

speed and acrobatic catches. The
senior is tied for second in the
Pac-10 with 17 receptions and a
11.4 yards per catch average. Run
ning back Milburn has shown his
good hands by coming out of the
backfield and making 12 catches
this year with an 8.4 yard average
per reception.
Feeding these two the ball is
junior Jason Palumbis, the eighth
ranked quarterback in the Pac-10
with 508 yards on 54 completions
in 79 attempts. Palumbis is a
quarterback who relies on his
accuracy (he is tops in the league
with a 68.4 completion percent

age) rather than his strength, and
usually dishes off short quick
passes. This will work to the Car
dinal's advantage because San
Jose is a blitzing defense, and the
6-foot-3 senior will probably not
have much time in the pocket to
search out receivers.
If the blitz does work, and the
Spartan defense can "isli,utr down
the Cardinal, San-Jose will have
lots to play with in its offense.
Leading the way for the Spar
tans is tailback Sheldon Canley, a
5-8, 193-pound, speedster who
ran for a school record 253 yards
last week against UNLV on a

whopping 43 carries. Canley is
used a lot, and will run up big
numbers by the end of the day.
However, he sports an unimpres
sive 4.0 yards per carry average.
Helping Canley pound away
the Stanford defense will be
senior quarterback Ralph Martini
and wide receiver Bobby Black
man. Last week, Martini corn-'
yards and 3 TDs. For the year
Martini is 78 of 142 for 848 yards
and a 54.9 percent completion
rate. Blackman is the receiver of

Defense will play a crucial role in today's game against San Jose State. Jon Volpe (above) and the reat
of the Cardinal offense hope not to get stopped by the Spartans, owners the county's seventh ranked
defense.
