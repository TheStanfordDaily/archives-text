# Chalk Talk Milburn one-on-one
## 
### 

Two things are givens today: San Jose Sate will blitz, and Glyn Milburn
will get the ball. Milburn is a double threat with his superior running abilities
and good hands. The play described above details Milburn coming out
the backfield for a pass against San Jose's blitz defense. Set as the left halfback
with Tommy Vardell on the right, Milburn moves around the block of
left tackle Bob Whitfield, and after running ten yards, looks for the pass.

Quarterback Jason Palumbis rolls left, and uses Milburn as his primary
receiver. If Milburn is covered, Palumbis looks at a deep streaking Ed
McCaffrey on the left, or Jon Pinckney running a post pattern on the right.
If all goes well, Milburn gets the ball, and using McCaffrey as interference,
runs in for the TD.
