# Battle for field and food
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Last year, two large roommates
in ATO took regular outings to
Taco Bell. Soft-taco eating con
tests were a common food-fest for
the pair.
A year later the two are split
ting the position of nose guard on
the defensive line in practice, and
the contest this year is for the
starting position.
Frank Busalacchi of Santa
Ana, Calif., and Aaron Rembisz of
Richardson, Texas, have been
alternating spots on the first and
second-string throughout the
early part of the 1990 season.
Busalacchi, 6-foot-3 and 276
pounds, started and excelled in
the first two games against Col
orado and UCLA, but has since
suffered from a pinched cervical
nerve and was forced to take a
week off training. Rembisz, 6-3
and 270 pounds, took over the
starting nose guard position and
had a great game in the blowout
last Saturday against Oregon
State.
The starting job was suddenly
up for grabs, but Rembisz saw his
start against OSU as more than
just an opportunity to take over
Busalacchi's starting position.
"I saw it as a chance to get out
and play hard the way I like to
play," the sophomore said. "If a
starting job is what results from
my performance, then that's fine.
Frank and I have been forfeiting
the job to each other due to
injuries for awhile."
Despite the constant struggle
on the field for the starting posi
tion, their friendship off the field,
and even during games and prac

tices has not suffered. Academi
cally, Busalacchi and Rembisz
have similar interests. While
Busalacchi is an electrical engi
neering major, Rembisz is a com
puter science major and many of
their required courses overlap.
"We are more competitive in
getting our physics problem sets
done, than in playing on the
field." Rembisz said. The nose
guard later described Busalacchi
as an "easygoing guy who's great
to be around and has nothing irri
tating about him."
Busalacchi points out that he
and Rembisz are not football com
petitors, but are partners: "We're
all out there for the same goal
to win. Aaron and I always sup
port each other when we're out on
the field."
Busalacchi and Rembisz may
seem like one-of-a-kind off the
field, in the classroom and at Taco
Bell, but on the field their styles of
playing nose tackle are consider
ably different.
"Aaron is smaller and quicker,
but Frank is bigger, has more
power and is a more physical
player," coach Denny Green
explained.
Busalacchi agrees.
"Aaron has more finesse than I
do and finds the gaps easier. I tend
to tackle first and then figure out
what my opponent is doing."
When asked which style of
defense he prefers, Green replied
he liked having both.
"We need both," Green said. "I
like to keep up a variety in the way
we play. Being able to substitute
players is also important because
it keeps the players fresh."
Busalacchi began practicing
again this week, but his pinched

nerves have not yet healed com
pletely. Rembisz is therefore
slated to start in the the game
against San Jose State this week
end, but Green expects Frank to
see some playing time.
San Jose State boasts the sev
enth ranked defense in the nation
as well as the nationally feared
quick and powerful running back,
Sheldon Canley. The nose guard
position, being in the center of the
line, will play a key role in a Cardi
nal win.
Neither Busalacchi nor Rem
bisz see themselves as the
"leader" of the defensive line, but
Busalacchi admitted that their
position has considerable power in
"causing lots of traffic in the mid
dle". Rembisz described the posi
tiori as the "king pin" or "corner
stone" of defense, "right in the
middle of the action".
With Canley as the opposing
running-back this weekend, there
should be quite a bit of action in
the middle of the field. Overall,
Stanford has a size advantage
over San Jose State, but the Spar
tans are a quicker team. Still,
Rembisz expects Stanford to "dic
tate the tempo of the game,
whether it's matching-up or pur
suing."
Busalacchi agrees that the
defensive line will be taking an
aggressive role. "We'll be attack
ing, getting out there and causing
problems for the offense."
Busalacchi describes his per
sonal style as "aggressive" ,
whereas Rembisz describes his as
"physical". Whether they are
physical or aggressive, being in
the center of the defensive line,
both players see a lot of action and

take a lot of hard hits on the field.
Injuries and alternating starting
roles has therefore been a large
part of their football careers.
"Its ironic," Busaiacchi said,
"I've been virtually injury-free
during my first two years at Stan
ford, and now that I have my
chance to be a regular starter, I've

been having problems with my
neck."
Despite his frustration, Frank
is optimistic for the future. The
situation may change from week
to week, but both players are
putting a lot of work and concen

When they're not busy making a run for the border, Frank Busalacchi
(above) and Aaron Rembisz find time in their schedules for problem
sets and battling to see who will be the starting nose guard. With
Busalacchi hurt, Rembisz is the man this week.
