# Workhorse Canley runs over Spartan foes
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Today's game might bring back
memories of the Cardinal back
field's glory days of a decade ago.
But this time around, its the
other team's weapon.
Darrin Nelson, Stanford's 1981
Ail-American, has not returned to
his alma mater, but the resem
blances are striking. Lining up in
the tailback position for the Spar
tans is Sheldon Canley. Like Nel
son, the 5-9, sub-200 pound Can
ley promises to keep the oppo
nents's defense keyed in on one
player for the entire contest.
His quick, slashing bursts, sim
ilar to Nelson's, are more than a
little tricky to hold.
"Sheldon is a really compact,
physical body type so he really has
leverage in terms of the opponent
trying to tackle him," Spartan
Coach Terry Shea said.
"I compare Sheldon a lot to
Darrin Nelson, who once played at
Stanford. He's that style back.
He's very quick and doesn't
always take a hit, so consequently
he's proved to be a very durable
back."
You could say that. Last week
at UNLV he only darted for a
school record 253 yards, on 43 car
ries. He also happened to collect
three touchdowns along the way.
But his ground attack is only
part of the package.

Like his Cardinal halfback
counterpart a decade ago, Canley
doesn't just break through
defenses on the run. As was for
mer Viking Nelson, he's a threat
through the air. The senior
brought in over 100 yards worth
of passes in the Spartans' first
four games. And he provides
blocking and kickoff returns for
the same price. •
Recognition, however, was not
so cheap to acquire.
While Canley has always been a
target for hounding defenses, he
was not even the number one back
at San Jose until this year. Well,
until the end of last season. Dur
ing his redshirt year and through
half of last year, tailback turned
fullback Johnny Johnson was the
pride of the Spartan backfield.
Johnson, who now plays for the
Phoenix Cardinals, holds the San
Jose State records for most touch
downs scored in one game, and in
a season, as well as most rushing
yards in a season. He also held
most yards gained rushing in a
game until last week.
But with Johnson's dismissal
for disciplinary reasons mid-sea
son last year, Canley became the
backfield.
And responded quite nicely,
thank you.
"I didn't want to get into a sit
uation with Johnny, but I just had
to pick up a bigger role when he
got kicked off.

"He was a big part of our catch
ing game so I just had to step up,"
Canley said.
Canley responded by leading
the team in rushing, with 1289
yards, receiving 42 catches for
353 yards, scoring 15 touch
downs, and kick returns 959
yards. His 2,513 all-purpose yards
were second in the nation only to
Mike Pringle of Cal State-Fuller
ton.
Goodbye Johnson, hello
Sanders. As in Barry Sanders.
Canley's remarkable season got
talk started about breaking 1988
Heisman-winner Sanders' all
time NCAA record of 3,249 all
purpose yards.
He even added punt-returning
to his repertoire, catching 90-100
punts a week this summer.
Coaches, afraid of him overdoing
it, negated that notion, however.
But Canley is still aiming for the
magic number. And with 837
yards after the first four games,
two of which were against non-Big
West teams, the record is still a
possibility.
"I'm definitely still shooting
for Sander's record. Hopefully at
the end of the season it will just
pop up. I'm just going to take it
one game at a time and just wait
and see after [the season is over]."
In the meantime, Canley sim
ply carries the Spartan offense.


Kevin Squires—Spartan Daily
Sheldon Canley hopes to break Barry Sanders NCAA career all-purpose
yards record this year. He rushed for 253 last week vs. UNLV.
There are 10 other players on the
field when he fines up, but all eyes
in the crowd, and usually among
his teammates, turn to the short
but powerfully built back.
He is the Spartan spark.
"Sheldon's mere presence gives
us that confidence to move the
football anytime we play. When we
go to him it allows us to be a much
more explosive team," Shea said.
"He has good hands coming out
of the backfield and he's real
alert," she added. "When I see
Sheldon around practice and in
games, our team really generates
a lot of confidence with him in
there. So he really is a key compo
nent to the balance of our
offense."
Not to mention the player the
Cardinal defense is zeroing in on.
Canley has accounted for half
of San Jose's total offense this
season. Stop him, and it might be
possible to slow down the tal
ented, high-scoring Spartans.
The fact that he thinks he
improves as the game goes on,
while other players wear down,
doesn't make stopping him any
easier.

"I get stronger as the game
goes on," Canley said. "In a bigger
sense I think I wear defenses
down. In the second half I'm get
ting stronger and things start to
happen."
He is not an easy target for any
defense. Stanford included.
"I don't think we're going to be
able to shut him down. A good
back is going to get his yards.
What we're going to have to do
really is control the ball. It's a dif
ferent type of game, It's not a
game when you're attacking the
zones. San Jose plays a lot of man
to-man," Green said.
Okay, so the Cardinal isn't even
aiming to stop the agile back. But
the squad definitely is preparing
for San Jose's multi-purpose
offensive threat.
"He's a very physical player,
very similar to [Eric] Bieniemy, so
I think that one guy is not going to
bring him down that many times.
I think team pursuit is going to be
a big part of it.
"Our objective is going to be to
really come off our blocks and to
pursue," Green added.
Canley won't be ignored by
anyone today.
