# Stanford/SJS Matchups

### 
For the Cardinal defense to be
effective, Tunney will need to
keep a close eye on the Spartans'
star tailback. Expect Canley, who
carried the ball 43 times for 253
yards and three touchdowns
against UNLV, to have a
workhorse afternoon. If Tunney is
able to break through the line and
throw Canley for negative
yardage, the Spartans will have a
hard time putting effective passes
into the Cardinal secondary.

Hieber must find away to slow
down Vardell, the Pac-10's leading
scorer. Vardell has played a crucial
role in pushing the Cardinal into
the end zone once Stanford gets
inside the 20-yard line. Hieber
needs to fill up the middle and add
to his total of 17 unassisted tack
les against the powerful fullback if
the Spartans hope to stifle Stan
ford's scoring.

Palumbis has directed the Car
dinal offense to consistent, effec
tive drives in the first three
games. He has been able to sneak
passes in front of the opposition's
secondary without being bothered
extensively by the attacking
defenders. Burnham has recorded
two sacks this season and will
attempt to pressure Palumbis into
throwing errant passes.

Klein jumped into the Cardi
nal's highlights by pulling down
two interceptions against Oregon
State. Charlton has caught only
10 passes so far this season but
has averaged 11.7 yards a catch.
The Cardinal secondary will be
looking to pick off a few of Mar
tini's passes but must be careful
that Charlton does not bust away
for a huge gain.

Milburn impressed the Stan
ford crowd with his first home
performance last week, marking
up his first 100-yard game and
scoring his first Cardinal touch
down. Milburn can fake and shake
past most defenders, and Wash
ington will need to make sure that
he wraps Milburn up when he
faces him one-on-one.

With all the students back on
the Farm, and an estimated
60,000 people on the hand, the
first real test of fan interest in the
yell leaders has arrived. The Dol
lies seem cooler, but the yell lead
ers actually do more. Stanford
students historically consider
themselves above "traditional"
collegiate activities, so actually
yelling for the team will probably
remain at its usual minimum. The
nod here goes to the Dollies it's
less taxing to use your eyes than
your vocal chords.
