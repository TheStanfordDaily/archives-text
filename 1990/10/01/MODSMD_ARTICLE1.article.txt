## Big attractions on a blazing afternoon 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
From a postal card dedication
to a blazing fireworks display,
Stanford opened its Centennial
Year Celebration yesterday with
an impressive assembly of
alumni, politicians, faculty and
students.
Annual events, such as the
Junior Convocation, which
kicked off yesterday's events at
noon, and the new student talent
show, were scheduled to coincide
with the special events celebrat
ing the Centennial.
But the big attraction was the
Opening Convocation in Frost
Amphitheater, featuring two
Stanford graduates, Brown Uni
versity President Vartan Grego
rian and NASA astronaut Mae
Jemison. Afterward, Postmaster
General Anthony Frank and Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif., spoke at
the Stanford Centennial postal
card dedication ceremony.
And to top it all off, a student
produced multimedia slide show

premiered in the
Inner Quad last
night, followed
by a fireworks
display.
The official
celebration
began as Stan
ford honored its
100 th matricu-

lating class yes
terday afternoon in the long, hot
Centennial Year Opening Convo
cation in Frost Amphitheater.
Thousands of folding chairs
covered the grass terraces at
Frost, but most of them
remained empty as students and
alumni retreated under shady
trees along the side aisles. For
those willing to risk sunburn, red
Stanford Centennial paper visors
provided some relief from the
sun.
Although the ceremony got off
to a slow start with a 40-minute
long procession and about eight
reprises of the school hymn
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," many in
the audience felt it was worth the

When she took the podium,
Jemison, who graduated in 1977
with a degree in chemical engi

She urged them to make the most
of Stanford's academic, research
and extracurricular opportuni
ties.
She also asked that Stanford
continue to look beyond a Euro
centric perspective.
"Whether we like it or not, the
rest of the world is growing,"

Jemison said, so the University
has "tremendous responsibility ..
. to incorporate that changing
world into its curriculum."
Gregorian received a history
degree in 1958 and a doctorate in
history and humanities in 1964.
He encouraged freshmen to sam
ple a broad range of classes and
thanked Stanford for its "rich and
robust curriculum" and diversity
of students.
"There's diversity in excellence
and excellence in diversity," he

said.
Gregorian told freshmen to
not "merely deny and debunk"
everything they learn and to
study events and authors of the
past for a complete education.
"We can't be prisoners of the pre
sent," he said.
He also stressed the impor
tance of an education for its own
sake. "Please don't confuse the
value of education with its earn
ing power," Gregorian added.
