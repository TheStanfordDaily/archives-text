# Bush, Congress forge budget compromise

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Working
against a midnight fiscal-year deadline
yesterday, the Bush administration
and congressional leaders forged a
compromise package of tax increases
and spending cuts designed to make a
five-year, $500 billion dent in the fed
eral deficit.
"It is balanced, it is fair, and in my
view it is what the United States of
America needs at this point in its his
tory," President Bush said. The budget
package contains $134 billion in new
tax revenues, including increases for
gasoline, cigarette and alcohol taxes, a
new tax on luxury items and a key
increase in Medicare premiums.
Bush said the pact will avoid a
chaotic disruption in federal programs
that would otherwise have occurred
when the 1991 fiscal year begins today.
With no agreement, federal spending

would have automatically been slashed
by $85 billion.
Lawkmakers voted on "stop-gap"
legislation that would allow the gov
ernment to function while the budget
bill is under consideration.
The 1991 deficit was originally pro
jected to reach $250 billion. The com
promise would shear $40 billion off
this amount.
Although Bush said he does not wel
come the tax increases, he deems them
necessary. "We all made compromises
in the national interest," said Rep.
Richard Gephardt.
Republicans in Congress are reluc
tant to accept the tax increases, while
many Democrats will look warily at
the $182 billion in cuts in federal
spending programs. There are broad
reductions in projected future spend

ing for social, pension and agricultural
programs.
Bush acknowledged that some in
Congress would likely oppose the bud
get pact. "Sometimes you don't get
just what you want," he remarked,
declaring compromises are necessary
to get the deficit under control.
"The bipartisan congressional lead
ership and I have pledged our very best
to get this plan passed into law by Oct.
19," Bush said at the end of the bud
get-summit negotiations that began
last May.
Although House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash., praised the compro
mise, he agreed with Senate Demo
cratic leader George Mitchell who said
the hard part is in pushing the agree
ment past special interest groups and
through Congress.

Among the tax measures is a boost
in fuel taxes and higher payroll with
holding for upper-income taxpayers..
There are incentives for energy explo
ration, and for research and develop
ment for businesses.
Overall, Bush said $134 billion of
the savings would come from new*
taxes and fees; $170 billion from
defense cuts and $120 billion from'
reductions in benefit programs like!
Medicare. The rest would come from
reduced debt payments.
In one of the final battles, Bush
abandoned his effort to win a reduc-*
tion in the capital gains tax rate. The
proposal never made it into the final
package — but neither did higher
income-tax rates on the wealthy that
Democrats had demanded in return.
