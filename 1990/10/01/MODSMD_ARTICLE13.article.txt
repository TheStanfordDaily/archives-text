# U.N. pledges to improve children's lives worldwide
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Presi
dent Bush told an unprecedented gath
ering of world leaders yesterday that
children suffering from disease and
poverty can be saved when adults "live
up to [their] responsibilities."
More than 70 kings, presidents and
prime ministers forged a multi-billion
dollar strategy at the United Nations
summit to help children, described by
participants as the world's most pre
cious resource.
During the two-day World Summit
For Children, which began Saturday,
the United Nations estimates 2,800
children worldwide will die of whoop
ing cough, 8,000 more from measles,
4,000 from tetanus, 5,500 from
malaria, 22,000 from diarrhea and
12,000 from pneumonia — all pre
ventable.

Bush told world leaders that the
United States will complete a plan this
month that will reduce U.S. infant
mortality and low birth weight,
increase immunization and improve
the health of mothers and children.
"We are gathered to speak for the
children of the Earth," he said. "Let
us affirm in this historic summit that
these children can be saved when we
live up to our responsibilities as a
world community of adults, of par
ents."
It is not known whether the final
draft declaration — the action plan for
the summit — would be signed by a
U.S. official. The declaration commits
nations to work toward ending disease,
hunger, poverty and illiteracy.
The declaration also commits
nations to work toward signing the

U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
Child.
Some U.S. conservatives take excep
tion to some provisions of the conven
tion, which already has been ratified
by more than 40 nations. They are con
cerned that the convention does not
define a fetus as a child with rights and
that it bans the death penalty for peo
ple under 18.
The United States has not signed
the convention, which is under study
in Washington.
'Under strict security measures,
leaders were escorted to their seats in
the emerald-carpeted General Assem
bly Hall by children in national cos
tume holding miniature flags of their
countries.
Bush was escorted by Jostin Lebo,
14, of Palisades, N.J., who repairs bicy

cles for less fortunate children.
U.S. aides called him one of the
"thousand points of light," sought by
Bush as an example of people helping
others.
Summit organizers said World Bank
president Barber Conable Jr. has
pledged an additional $500 million per
year for health and education for chil
dren. More than 1 million children
could be saved each year by the addi
tional funds, they said.
The summit is aimed at mobilizing
governments to save up to 100 million
children from death by disease and
malnutrition in the 19905.
A clause was added to the declara
tion at Kuwait's urging denouncing
the suffering of children because of
"aggression, foreign occupation and
annexation."
