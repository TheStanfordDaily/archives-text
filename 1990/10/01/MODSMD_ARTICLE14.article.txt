# Saddam adopts softened stance

NEW YORK (AP) — Saddam Hussein adopted a
more conciliatory stance yesterday in the nearly 2-*
month-old Persian Gulf crisis, urging peaceful dia-*
logue instead of "threats and warnings."
In a message broadcast on Iraqi TV and radio,!
Saddam said he no longer opposed the
of foreign powers in the search for a settlement to*
the crisis, which was touched off by Iraq's Aug. 2£
invasion of Kuwait.
The Iraqi leader's latest message came as world*
leaders meeting at the United Nations moved tot
shore up diplomatic efforts against Iraq.
Hussein's speech, read by an announcer, said ten-»
sions can be reduced in the gulf "if dialogue replaces!
the policy of threats and warnings, if the language
peaceful politics replaces the policy of troop buildups,
and threats of the use of force."
However, he again linked any solution to the cri-*
sis to Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Gazal
Strip and West Bank, and the pullout of Syrian*
forces from Lebanon.
"Peace could not be achieved without the settle-,
ment of all the problems of the region," he said. 112
Saddam said he wanted to launch a dialogue with*
France to explore the possibility of using
President Francois Mitterrand's ideas on the gulfr
crisis as the basis for a settlement.
In a speech Sept. 24 before the U.N. General*
Assembly, Mitterrand suggested settling the conflict*
over Kuwait together with other problems in the
region, including the Israeli occupation of Arab ter
ritories and the Lebanese civil war.
In other developments, the United States and the
Soviet Union have begun drafting resolutions to
authorize the use of military force against Iraq if a
worldwide economic squeeze does not force a retreat
from Kuwait, U.S. officials said yesterday.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze is
signalling a tough stance. "We are a permanent
member of the security Council and we will comply
with any decision, with any resolution of the secu
rity council,"he said.
Shevardnadze, interviewed on NBC-TV's "Meet
the Press," added that compliance "would include
anything regarding the involvement of the Soviet
troops under the flag, under the auspices, of the
United Nations."
Both superpowers would move against Iraq under
U.N. auspices, but the Soviets prefer to work under
a joint military command while the United States
prefers more "logistical" leeway, the officials told
The Associated Press.
One of the U.S. officials emphasized that the talks
with the Soviets are tentative — "Everybody is look
ing at options." The officials spoke on condition of
anonymity.
In the gulf region, thousands of French troops
joined the U.S.-led multinational force yesterday.
