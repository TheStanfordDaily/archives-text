## A
						fair NCAA ruling 
### 
The NCAA should adopt
education and prevention
policies, end drug testing

LAST WEEK'S COURT ruling
exempting Stanford athletes
from the NCAA's mandatory
drug-testing program shows that
the NCAA needs to reexamine its
policies on drug use.
As Judge Eugene Premo held in
his ruling, the NCAA did not pro
vide enough evidence that "there is
significant drug use among stu
dent athletes, and that by testing,
students' health and safety and the
integrity of the program will be
protected."
On a purely legal level, the policy
violated the rights of privacy guar
anteed by the California Constitu
tion. Student athletes' right to pri
vacy with respect to their own bod
ies outweighs any potential bene
fits of the policy of random drug
testing.
The NCAA policy also degraded
and humiliated student athletes by
requiring them to undress and uri
nate in front of an monitor.
In addition, students were asked
very personal questions about
their medical history. Females, for
example, were asked specifically if
they were using birth control.
While reducing drug use in col
lege athletics is a valid goal, these
methods are not the way to achieve
it. Clearly, such questions serve no
legitimate purpose other than to
dehumanize the athletes. Student
athletes must have the right to
keep their personal lives private.
Another problem with the drug
testing policy was its extreme
breadth. The NCAA's list of
banned substances is not merely
limited to anabolic steroids and

various stimulants. The list
encompasses 58 pages of controlled
substances, and even that isn't
enough for the NCAA.
At the end of the list, the policy
states, "This is not to be consid
ered a complete list." This system
makes it difficult for athletes even
to know if a particular drug was
banned. Rightly, the court held
that this program was too broad.
The NCAA seems to be engaged
in random drug-testing simply to
make itself look good. And from a
publicity standpoint, the policy
does make the organization appear
to be taking a tough stand on drugs
in college athletics. But while drug
testing may help expose some drug
abuse in college sports, it does little
to solve the problem.
Random drug-testing only ends
up harming student athletes. Use
of the procedure should be stopped
throughout college athletics.
The NCAA may decide to appeal
the appellate court ruling to the
California Supreme Court and pro
long this case even more. A more
appropriate response, however,
would be to give up the drug-test
ing and find another way to reduce
drug use.
By using the money it has
invested in its drug-testing pro
gram in a more positive way, the
NCAA might have more success in
fighting drug use without invading
athletes' privacy.
Instead of testing, the NCAA
could improve its drug education
and prevention programs. It could
also place money in an ad cam
paign that illustrates the dangers
of drug use to athletes and others.
Paying for drug treatment and
rehabilitation could also help solve
the problem.
There are many productive, pos
itive and legal ways to reduce drug
use. Random drug-testing of col
lege athletes is just not one of
them.
