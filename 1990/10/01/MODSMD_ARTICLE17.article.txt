Yell Leaders are a
bad idea gone worse
With the exceptions of May 15, 1989
(the day of the Kennedy office takeover)
and May 8,1990 (the day the ASSU Sen
ate certified last year's election results),
I have never been more ashamed to be a
Stanford student than I was at Satur
day's football game against San Jose
State.
Or, I ought to say, Saturday's game
against human decency.
To put it simply, decency lost.
I'm not talking about the performance
of the football team. I'll leave that to The
Daily's marvelous and talented sports
writers.
I'm not talking about the performance
of the Beach Boys. But I very well could
be — their use of bikini-clad dancers,
props, decorations and spare tires was
more sickening than titillating.
The Beach Boys proved themselves
once again to be the most arrogant clods
in the music business, reciting their own
Guinness Book stats between songs. (See
also any record of their induction in the
Rock Hall of Fame, when they managed
to offend pretty much everyone in the
business.)
They made an unwarranted comment
about Mick Jagger that was not humor,
but an offensive, jealous and pathetic
statement on their own narrow concep
tion of music (as well as their own inabil
ity to move on stage).
The mysterious use of the two hun
dred screaming and bopping junior high
school cheerleaders was both puzzling
and disturbing. The group's fascination
with the automobile, a well-documented
symbol of phallic power ... oh, but I
wasn't going to talk about the Beach
Boy 8.
What is it that chills my Stanford
soul? If you need to ask, you must have
missed the game.
You guessed it, the Stanford Yell Lead
era. Or, should I say, the S-T-A-N-O-R-D
(sic) Yell Leaders. A fine example of a

bad idea gone wrong. And then turned
malignant.
Maybe I'm asking too much of our
cheerleaders by requesting they spell
the school's name correctly. But I can
narrow my list of suggestions for
improvement down to one. Go away.
Now.
Every time the "Leaders" tried to
start a cheer, their efforts crashed and
burned in a mangled heap of disgrace.
But to be fair, it wasn't their fault. Ahh,
who am I kidding? Yes it was.
The students don't even give them a
chanco. And who can blame them?
It is painfully obvious that these Yell
Leaders are totally unnecessary. In their
performance, they manage to cross the
fine line between legitimate entertain
ment and target practice.
The Athletic Department hopes the
Yell Leaders will increase fan participa
tion and crowd noise. Of course, the
opposite results.
Here's how it works: on one occasion
during the game I was tempted to chant,
"DE-FENSE". When I saw the Yell Lead
ers begging the student section to do just
that, I had no choice but to remain
silent.
I trust that humanity will eventually
prevail and the Yell Leaders will go the
way of racist speech and Lake Lag.
I beg the Athletic Department to save
the poor students trapped in this doomed
program from further humiliation by
pulling the plug as soon as possible.
Go Stanord!

EPA resident supports
Twin Towers project
I am writing in response to a letter
titled, "East Palo Alto, not Palo Alto
East," which was featured in the Sept.
24 Daily.
The issue over whether it will be
advantageous for East Palo Alto to have

the development of the Twin Office Tow
ers in the Whisky Gulch area has been
drawn-out.
You have to be a resident of East Palo
Alto to know that it will be a great bene
fit for the community to have such a
complex.
Yes, it is unfortunate that the new
space will eliminate the small businesses
that are currently there. But are the
businesses profitable enough to help
maintain the area visually and other
wise?
It is quite apparent that they are not;
their appearances are "tired" and run
down.
Furthermore, their prices are outra
geously high — which is common for any
business that is located in a minority
populated community — and their own
ers do not put their profits back into the
community that supports them; they
pocket them instead.
So who has the advantage here? Areas
such as that only harbor the transients
and illicit drug dealers, and Whisky
Gulch area has been known to have
problems with these types for as long as I
have been a resident there (well over 10
years). This is definitely not compatible
with the city's needs.
Lastly, there are also other areas in
East Palo Alto for these businesses to
relocate. Who knows, they may have a
better chance.
As I see it, it will be a welcome sight
to see new, clean, profitable businesses in
the place of the existing structures.
They will create new jobs to the
unemployed, and will create a sense of
hope that many of the residents need.
There is no doubt that the redevelop
ment will greatly help the city's tax rev
enue, which will help the city get back on
its feet.
What is "compatible with the city's
needs" is many companies that are inter
ested in "setting up shop" in East Palo
Alto.
I have always been enthusiastic about
the Twin Tower redevelopment project
because it is a "coat of fresh paint." Take

it from a resident who lives there and
knows.

The Fire Within' is
unifying, spectacular
I would like to comment on The
Daily's choice of words in its Friday edi
torial, "Fire without Burns."
The Daily characterized "Th 3 Fire
Within" — historically a cultural celebra
tion of students of color — as "poten
tially divisive."
Students of all colors, including white,
should know that the program is also
potentially unifying, potentially spectac
ular, and potentially inspiring.
Planning for "The Fire Within" begins
today at 7 p.m., at the ASSU office. Are
you a Stanford student? Then you're
invited.
