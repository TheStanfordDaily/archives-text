# Kennedy, Wilson welcome hundreds at dedication of Stanford postal card

### Mark Wang 
Business was booming yesterday at
the Stanford post office â€” especially for
a Sunday.
Several hundred students, faculty
and philatelists attended the dedication
of a special postal card issued in honor
of Stanford's 100 th year and lined up to
buy them on their first day of issue.
The ceremony, part of the festivities
celebrating the beginning of Stanford's
100 th year featured welcomes from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and
Stanford Historical Society President

Rosemary Hornby and remarks from
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and Post
master General Anthony Frank.
In his speech, Frank said, "By issuing
this postal card, we hope to focus atten
tion not just on the Quad at Stanford
and its history, but also on the lasting
contributions of one of the finest teach
ing and research institutions in the
world."
Because of their ties to Stanford,
both candidates in this year's California
gubernatorial race, Wilson and former
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
were invited to speak at the ceremony

Feinstein, a Stanford alumna, was
unable to attend due to a previously
scheduled event. Wilson's wife, Gayle, is
also a Stanford alumna.
Wilson tried to draw a parallel
between former governor and senator
Leland Stanford and himself. "Leland
Stanford is something of a role model
for me," he said.
Wilson reminded the audience that
while the postal card recognizes the
achievements of Stanford University for
the past 100 years, "The job of a great
university is never done."
The postal card depicts a view of

Memorial Court through the sandstone
arches of the Inner Quad.
Jim M'Guinness, a professional illus
trator and the card's designer, adapted
the image from one of several pictures
he did as an illustrator for Stanford 11
years ago. M'Guinness said, "The Uni
versity didn't want the emphasis to be
on any one particular thing, so we went
with the arches."
"I think [M'Guinness] has remark
ably captured the grace and spirit of the
Quad," said Frank. "These miniatures
of the Quad at Stanford ... will remind
people everywhere of the beauty of this

great institution and the necessity of
preserving America's history in archi
tecture."
The Citizens Stamp Advisory Com
mittee of the U.S. Postal Service chose
the Stanford Centennial as a subject for
a card from the 25,000 suggestions they
receive every year. Only 25 to 30 sub
jects are chosen for cards each year, and
Stanford is one of only 10 places chosen
for the Historic Preservation Series in
the last decade.
Said Frank, "Postal subjects are as
