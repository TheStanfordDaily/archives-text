## One step for womankind 
### 
SOMEHOW I've always thought that
guys were more shallow than girls,
at least in terms of their views on
the opposite sex. Guys were the ones who
were supposed to be controlled exclu
sively by their hormones while girls had
mature, more elevated attitudes,
Well, it appears that I was wrong.
A recent Talon survey has revealed
that female adolescents can be as much
slaves to their endocrine systems as their
male counterparts. Granted, the survey is
not altogether scientific, but the results
are nonetheless disturbing.
I can't say that this news comes as a
complete shock. After all, if men can lust
after women's bodies, there's no reason
why women can't lust after men's bodies.
I just thought that women were too
inherently refined and sensitive to be so
callously assessing. There is, after all,
more to a man than his physical charac
teristics.
What is perhaps more disturbing than
simply the fact that the females surveyed
placed such importance on a male's out
ward appearance is how specific they
were in defining what they assess in a
guy.
For instance, one of the things the girls
in the survey evaluate in a guy is his eyes.
There doesn't seem to be a general prefer
ence for any particular eye color. If there
were, I wouldn't be surprised if sales for
colored contact lenses among men
increased dramatically.
If color isn't the issue, I suppose the
male's eyes are assessed for clarity, maybe
even expressiveness, much as the eyes of
rabbits, birds and other animals are

examined as an indication of health.
I can see it now — women running
around with penlights in their purses so
they can thoroughly evaluate a man's
eyes before they agree to go out on a date
with him.
Besides the eyes, the length, amount
and location of hair seems to be an impor
tant factor Long hair is undesirable, but
chest hair is alright. And as for hair on
the back,... well, that depends.
Peach fuzz is OK, but looking like a
gorilla is a definite no-no. Maybe men will
start shaving their backs. That wouldn't
be so odd. Women, after all, are supposed
to shave their legs regularly, at least in
the United States.
Maybe Nair will start a new line called
"Nair for Men," or perhaps the makers of
Epilady could come up with "Epiman."
Epiman would have to come equipped
with a longer handle, of course, for those
hard to reach places on the back.
And finally, a man's physical build
seems to be of utmost importance.
He shouldn't be too muscular, as most
surveyed seemed to be repulsed by Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Skinny is acceptable,
but not scrawny. I find it veiy difficult to
discern between the two. Perhaps what
they really mean is slim as opposed to
emaciated.
Broad shoulders are apparently desir
able in a male. Well, what do you know?
Clothing manufacturers have been
putting shoulder pads in the vestments of
the wrong gender. Instead of padding
every single female garment manufac
tured, they should be stuffing men's
shirts.

Guys were the ones who
were supposed to be con
trolled exclusively by their
hormones while girls had
mature, more elevated atti
tudes.

Other factors of the male physique
must also be considered. For example, the
hands are important, as well as the shape
and contour of the posterior, or hind end.
That should make you feel better,
guys. While you're undressing females
with your eyes, the females will be deter
mining the dimensions of your bodily
parts with a mental tape measure.
It's comforting to know that civiliza
tion has taken a progressive step toward
sexual equality.
Now each sex can be regarded as sides
of beef by the other, and men can worry
about dieting and rearranging their bod
ies through plastic surgery.
While women are busy getting breast
implants, men can have their shoulders
broadened or their sex organs enlarged.
Ah, equality, how crude it is.

guys. While you're undressing females
with your eyes, the females will be deter
mining the dimensions of your bodily
parts with a mental tape measure.
It's comforting to know that civiliza
tion has taken a progressive step toward
sexual equality.
Now each sex can be regarded as sides
of beef by the other, and men can worry
about dieting and rearranging their bod
ies through plastic surgery.

implants, men can have their shoulders
broadened or their sex organs enlarged.
Ah, equality, how crude it is.
