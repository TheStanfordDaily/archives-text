## Martini leaves Cardinal secondary dazed, 29-23 Offensive line struggles against Spartan blitzes 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
After Stanford's 29-23 loss to San Jose State on
Saturday, few of the Cardinal players summarized
the game better than offensive guard Chuck Gilling
ham's analysis of the play of the offensive line:
"We played like s—. I don't know if you can use
that in the newspaper but that's how we played, '' he
said.
Gillingham and his linemates gave up seven sacks
of Cardinal quarterback Jason Palumbis, allowed
three fumbled snaps (all of which Palumbis was able
to fall on) and crumbled under a pass rush that hur
ried Palumbis innumerable times.
Three of the sacks occurred during Stanford's
first five offensive plays. Two other crucial sacks,
both in the third quarter, thwarted Cardinal field
goal attempts.
Taking over the ball at 10:27 of the third quarter
and trailing 21-16, Palumbis and the offense drove
from Stanford's 45-yard line to the San Jose State
30. Then on second down and eight, Spartan defen
sive tackle Simon Vaoifi dropped Palumbis for a five
yard loss. The offense regained the loss on third
down, but on fourth and eight Cardinal placekicker
John Hopkins left a 47-yard attempt short. San Jose
State took the ball over and drove 70 yards for a
touchdown and a two-point conversion.
On Stanford's next drive, Palumbis was again
sacked on second and 10 at the Spartan 22 for a loss
of seven yards. Again the offense failed to convert on
third down and Hopkins kicked wide right.
The Spartan defense not only stopped the Cardi
nal's quick-pass style offense but penetrated the
offensive line to hold Stanford tailback Glyn Mil
burn and the Cardinal running game to 22 net yards
on 38 rushing attempts.
All day, the offensive line looked battled by the
stunting and blitzing rush of a physically smaller
San Jose State defensive line.
"I don't know what went wrong," a frustrated
Gillingham said. "We didn't move off the (snap of
the) ball well, we didn't pass protect. I don't know
what it was. We didn't earn our scholarships today.
We weren't ready to play."
"We saw virtually everything (the Spartans)
showed us today in practice this week," offensive
tackle Bob Whitfield said. " But you have to take
what you learn in practice and transfer it to the
field."
"They have smaller personel but they're quick

Now what?
Stanford had to beat San Jose
State Saturday. Without the
home victory, the team would be
forced to head to No. 1 Notre
Dame with a losing record, and
without momentum.
It was a must-win situation.
Stanford lost.
"It could have been Oregon
State, it could have been Arizona
State, Hell, it could have been
Sunnyvale State. It had to be a
game where we had to win. We
needed this one bad," offensive
guard Chuck Gillingham said.
"We didn't get it and it's a
shame because everybody knew
the importance of the game and
knew we had to come right in and
play."
And despite Stanford's perfor
mance, the Fighting Irish, in
South Bend, still loom.
"We knew that we have Notre
Dame next. We can't do anything
about this game. We just have to
look forward to next week," said
running back Glyn Milburn.
"This game is over. We came up
a couple of points short. We've
had some tough losses but we've
been moving the ball at the end
and I think that's something, we
have to look forward to."
It was more, however than just
coming up short.
While Stanford did have a play
nullified that could have altered
the outcome of the game, and sev
eral players looked brillant, there
were times when Stanford simply
didn't execute.
San Jose was defintely on, but
the Cardinal almost appeared con
fused, on both offense and
defense, during some drives.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis'
first three pass attempts resulted
in sacks. The Cardinal could not
convert a single first down on four
drives. Three snaps were fumbled.
The Spartans' passing patterns
were not disrupted. Tackles were
misjudged.
Something was missing.
"A lot of it was just horrible

execution on our part. We just
weren't getting the things done
that we needed to get done. We
missed coverage, They were beat
ing us with stunts. It got to the
point where we were almost on
our heels," Gillingham said.
"We were ready. They did
everything we expected them to
do. We knew they were going to be
a quick team, we knew they were
going to blitz a lot and we just
didn't execute. That's just poor
play on our part," Palumbis
added.
Stanford scored a total of three
points the first half. It could not
establish a running game, and
nine of Palumbis' passes fell to the
turf. The abilty and depth of the
Spartan's seventh-ranked defense
cannot be overlooked, however. In
the two contests before Stanford,
San Jose State gave up a total of
11 yards rushing.
The Cardinal did find more of a
groove during the third and
fourth periods, and while never
really a threat on the ground, was
very effective through the air.
Palumbis finished the day 27-of
-39 for 387 yards, the best perfor
mance of his career.
Milburn and receiver Ed
McCaffrey were also impressive,
finding seams in the tight Spartan
coverage and accounting for 354
of Stanford's 409 net yards. Full
back Tommy Vardell bulldozed for
two of Stanford's three touch
downs in accumulating 28 yards
rushing.
But Stanford also had trouble
holding back the blitzing Spartan
line, which swarmed in for seven
sacks, knocked two balls out of
Palumbis' hand, and rushed
numerous plays.
"It was a bad effort on our part
up front because we'd seen every
thing that they did today. They

Tailback Glyn Miiburn had a terrific game Saturday, piling up a total of 292 yards of all
purpose running, and had a 62-yard punt return for a touchdown called back due to a
penalty. Despite his heroics, the Cardinal fell to 1-3.
