## Martini leaves Cardinal secondary dazed, 29-23 Offensive line struggles against Spartan blitzes 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
After Stanford's 29-23 loss to San Jose State on
Saturday, few of the Cardinal players summarized
the game better than offensive guard Chuck Gilling
ham's analysis of the play of the offensive line:
"We played like s—. I don't know if you can use
that in the newspaper but that's how we played, '' he
said.
Gillingham and his linemates gave up seven sacks
of Cardinal quarterback Jason Palumbis, allowed
three fumbled snaps (all of which Palumbis was able
to fall on) and crumbled under a pass rush that hur
ried Palumbis innumerable times.
Three of the sacks occurred during Stanford's
first five offensive plays. Two other crucial sacks,
both in the third quarter, thwarted Cardinal field
goal attempts.
Taking over the ball at 10:27 of the third quarter
and trailing 21-16, Palumbis and the offense drove
from Stanford's 45-yard line to the San Jose State
30. Then on second down and eight, Spartan defen
sive tackle Simon Vaoifi dropped Palumbis for a five
yard loss. The offense regained the loss on third
down, but on fourth and eight Cardinal placekicker
John Hopkins left a 47-yard attempt short. San Jose
State took the ball over and drove 70 yards for a
touchdown and a two-point conversion.
On Stanford's next drive, Palumbis was again
sacked on second and 10 at the Spartan 22 for a loss
of seven yards. Again the offense failed to convert on
third down and Hopkins kicked wide right.
The Spartan defense not only stopped the Cardi
nal's quick-pass style offense but penetrated the
offensive line to hold Stanford tailback Glyn Mil
burn and the Cardinal running game to 22 net yards
on 38 rushing attempts.
All day, the offensive line looked battled by the
stunting and blitzing rush of a physically smaller
San Jose State defensive line.
"I don't know what went wrong," a frustrated
Gillingham said. "We didn't move off the (snap of
the) ball well, we didn't pass protect. I don't know
what it was. We didn't earn our scholarships today.
We weren't ready to play."
"We saw virtually everything (the Spartans)
showed us today in practice this week," offensive
tackle Bob Whitfield said. " But you have to take
what you learn in practice and transfer it to the
field."
"They have smaller personel but they're quick

Now what?
Stanford had to beat San Jose
State Saturday. Without the
home victory, the team would be
forced to head to No. 1 Notre
Dame with a losing record, and
without momentum.
It was a must-win situation.
Stanford lost.
"It could have been Oregon
State, it could have been Arizona
State, Hell, it could have been
Sunnyvale State. It had to be a
game where we had to win. We
needed this one bad," offensive
guard Chuck Gillingham said.
"We didn't get it and it's a
shame because everybody knew
the importance of the game and
knew we had to come right in and
play."
And despite Stanford's perfor
mance, the Fighting Irish, in
South Bend, still loom.
"We knew that we have Notre
Dame next. We can't do anything
about this game. We just have to
look forward to next week," said
running back Glyn Milburn.
"This game is over. We came up
a couple of points short. We've
had some tough losses but we've
been moving the ball at the end
and I think that's something, we
have to look forward to."
It was more, however than just
coming up short.
While Stanford did have a play
nullified that could have altered
the outcome of the game, and sev
eral players looked brillant, there
were times when Stanford simply
didn't execute.
San Jose was defintely on, but
the Cardinal almost appeared con
fused, on both offense and
defense, during some drives.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis'
first three pass attempts resulted
in sacks. The Cardinal could not
convert a single first down on four
drives. Three snaps were fumbled.
The Spartans' passing patterns
were not disrupted. Tackles were
misjudged.
Something was missing.
"A lot of it was just horrible

execution on our part. We just
weren't getting the things done
that we needed to get done. We
missed coverage, They were beat
ing us with stunts. It got to the
point where we were almost on
our heels," Gillingham said.
"We were ready. They did
everything we expected them to
do. We knew they were going to be
a quick team, we knew they were
going to blitz a lot and we just
didn't execute. That's just poor
play on our part," Palumbis
added.
Stanford scored a total of three
points the first half. It could not
establish a running game, and
nine of Palumbis' passes fell to the
turf. The abilty and depth of the
Spartan's seventh-ranked defense
cannot be overlooked, however. In
the two contests before Stanford,
San Jose State gave up a total of
11 yards rushing.
The Cardinal did find more of a
groove during the third and
fourth periods, and while never
really a threat on the ground, was
very effective through the air.
Palumbis finished the day 27-of
-39 for 387 yards, the best perfor
mance of his career.
Milburn and receiver Ed
McCaffrey were also impressive,
finding seams in the tight Spartan
coverage and accounting for 354
of Stanford's 409 net yards. Full
back Tommy Vardell bulldozed for
two of Stanford's three touch
downs in accumulating 28 yards
rushing.
But Stanford also had trouble
holding back the blitzing Spartan
line, which swarmed in for seven
sacks, knocked two balls out of
Palumbis' hand, and rushed
numerous plays.
"It was a bad effort on our part
up front because we'd seen every
thing that they did today. They

Tailback Glyn Miiburn had a terrific game Saturday, piling up a total of 292 yards of all
purpose running, and had a 62-yard punt return for a touchdown called back due to a
penalty. Despite his heroics, the Cardinal fell to 1-3.
and they do a lot of stunts," Mil
burn said. "Our game plan was
there but we just didn't execute."
That lack of execution resulted
not only in untimely sacks but in
two fumbled snaps that helped
kill important drives.
In the first quarter, as Stan
ford was driving for its only field
goal of the day, Palumbis bobbled
the snap from center Chris Dal
man on second and 10 at the San
Jose State 26-yard line. Palumbis
fell on the ball for no gain, but

failed to convert the third-down
play.
Trailing 14-3 with time run
ning down in the second quarter,
the Cardinal offense stood on its
own 40-yard line when on second
and 10 Palumbis and Dalman
again failed to succesfully snap
the ball. This time Palumbis fell
on the ball for a 3-yard loss, the
drive stalled and Stanford punted
the ball away.
Palumbis graciously took some
of the blame for the troubles
snapping the ball. "I don't know if
I was pulling away early or not. It
was poor communication and a
bad day. I'll take the blame

there."
In the locker room afterwards,
every player's mind seemed to be
on the failures on offense.
"I don't know exactly what
went wrong," Palumbis said. "I
know a few times I should have
thrown out of bounds. But on
third downs I tried to make some
big plays and they had good cover
age downfield so I got sacked."
"We got off the bus today and
we weren't ready to play," Gilling
ham said. "You've got to play four
quarters. You can't spot them a
21-3 lead and expect to claw back.
You can't play like we did the first
half and expect to win.

didn't surprise us with anything.
They stayed within their tenden
cies," Gillingham said.
"It's not just the offensive line
— you have tight ends and backs
involved up there too," coach
Denny Green said. "The entire
protection was not what we
wanted it to be. We just didn't do
what we needed to in terms of
picking up schemes and shutting
down schemes."
For the fourth game in a row
the Cardinal defense stopped its
opponent's running game, in this
case All-America candidate Shel
don Canley. Canley, who raced for
253 yards and two touchdowns
agaisnt UNLV a week ago, was
held to 46 yards and no scores on
22 carries.
"We didn't make our game plan
to stop him but we knew we had to
because he's a quality running
back. We were stopping running
games since the season began so
we thought we'd do that and make
them throw the ball," wide
receiver-turned-defensive-back
Darrien Gordon said:
That was the problem.
The Spartans threw the ball.
And kept on throwing the ball.
Adjustments didn't help. The Car
dinal secondary just couldn't stop
receivers from coming down with
receptions.
Spartan quarterback Ralph
Martini finished the day with 23
completions on 32 attempts for
3{>l yards and four touchdowns.
He also converted seven of 14
t&ird-down plays, seemingly giv
ing San Jose a spark whenever it

needed it.
"We've done this same thing
every week. We've stopped the
run. Our problem comes up basi
cally when we stop people's run
ning game," defensive coordinator
Willie Shaw said.
"We've had an inability to rush
the passer when we force people to
throw the ball and in this case it
was even more so."
Taken together, offensive and
defensive misexecution put Stan
ford in a 21-3 hole at the begin
ning of the third quarter.
A blowout seemed possible.
The Cardinal, however, found
its synch one minute into the
third quarter. In the next minute
and a half of playing time Milburn
converted a five-yard pass into a
69-yard touchdown gallop, J.J.
Lasley forced a Canley fumble on
the kickoff return and McCaffrey
turned a 10-yard toss up the mid
dle into a 22-yard gain.
San Jose 21, Stanford 16.
Twenty-eight minutes remaining.
But the lapses returned. The
Cardinal's next two drives
resulted in two missed field goals.
Once again there were sacks and
incomplete passes on offense.
Defensively, Stanford allowed San
Jose to march for its fourth
touchdown of the contest, this one
complete with a two-point conver
sion.
"We had a couple of scoring
opportunities — we went across
the 50-yard line. The two missed
field goals made a lot of difference,
now we had to go the distance for
a touchdown. We didn't have that
luxury (of a field goal) anymore,"
Green said.
One final scoring drive put
Stanford within six, but a fumbled

snap on first-and-goal forced the
Cardinal to waste a precious 90
seconds.
There just wasn't enough time
for a comeback.
As Green predicted, there were
a number of big plays for both
teams, setting up various scoring
drives. McCaffrey brought in 11
receptions for 145 yards. Milburn
snagged another 163 yards on
only eight catches.
But there were also penalties
negating big plays. Milburn came
up with one of his classic punt
return scores, dodging defenders
and breaking tackles for a 62 yard
touchdown, only to have it called
back for a clipping call.
"We played a little better in the
second half but I wouldn't con
sider it an example of sharp offen
sive execution the entire game,"
Green said. "We did not match up
skill athlete against skill athlete
on defense."
Bring on Notre Dame.
Card notes
With his field goal in the first quar
ter, kicker John Hopkins became the
all-time leading scorer on the Farm,
passing former kicker Mark Har
mon.
Vardell maintained the Pacific 10
Conference touchdown lead with his
sixth and seventh scores of the season.
Defensive back Gary Taylor went
down with a sprained left knee and is
questionable for Notre Dame.
