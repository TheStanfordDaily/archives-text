# Spikers sweep in Arizona
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team can actually play like the
most dominant team in the coun
try at times; fans on the Farm just
haven't really got a chance to see
it yet.
While the Cardinal (8-2, 5-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play) may
have soured some fans' percep
tions during last week's homes
tand, the team continued to domi
nate on the road this weekend.
Stanford defeated both Arizona
and Arizona State in four-game
fashion to remain undefeated
away from home in 1990.
Stanford's struggle to rebound
from consecutive home defeats
became a struggle to remain
healthy against the always-dan
gerous Wildcats of Arizona. Dur
ing the Friday night match, start
ing outside hitter Jennifer Jack
son was temporarily sidelined
with a foot injury. Her replace
ment, freshman Danielle Everett
collided with supersoph Bev Oden
on an ensuing play. Everett
required a few minutes on the
floor to recover her breath and

was subsequently removed from
the match. The injured Jackson
returned and played the competi
tion out.
After the contest had been
decided, middle blocker Jessica
Benton suffered back spasms and
tightening. Benton was unavail
able against Arizona State the
next night.
"But everybody's okay now,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
It's fair to say that the Cardinal
performance was pretty okay, too.
Oden menaced the Wildcats,
delivering 18 kills for a .310 hit
ting percentage. Junior Amy
Cooper had 10 kills and hit .318
on the night. Kristin Klein added
12 kills and a match-high 16 digs.
Senior co-captain Benton also
established her presence at the
net. The middle blocker had a
match-high eight total blocks to
go with nine kills.
Much of the offensive spark
could be attributed to rejuvenated

passing. After streaks of poor ball
handling against UCLA and the
University of the Pacific, Stanford
regrouped over the weekend and
sided out with relative ease. The
Cardinal committed only six
reception errors against Arizona.
In game one alone against UOFJ
Stanford mishandled four serves.
"We were siding out well,"
Shaw said. "But we didn't take
advantage of all the offensive
chances we had."
The Cardinal really didn't need
to. Arizona could muster only a
.165 team hitting percentage and
was hindered by the loss of out
side hitter Terry Lauchner. The
Arizona kills' leader left the
match with an injury in the sec
ond game. Only one Wildcat hit
over .250 for the night and the
entire team recorded only one
more block than Benton. Stanford
triumphed, 15-9, 15-7, 5-15, 15-4.
With the victory, Stanford
established a 19-1 overall mark
against Arizona. Arizona State,
who has managed only two of 20
aggregate matches against the
Cardinal, would fare little better.
With starting outside hitter
Kristi Paaso still unavailable and
Benton nursing her back, Shaw
started a makeshift Cardinal
lineup against ASU. Junior Nicole
Appleman replaced Benton to
earn her first extended playing
time of the year and Jackson
again subsitituted for Paaso.
Stanford, nevertheless, continued
to groove.
Klein maintained her daunting
kills and digs pace. The junior All-
American had 24 kills and 25 digs,
hitting .333 on the night. Oden is
making a bid to win Pac-10

Player-of-the-Week honors for the
third time with another impres
sive performance. The Irvine,
Calif., middle blocker had 20 kills
and 18 digs while hitting .368.
The team as a whole hit 142 per
centage points higher than
defense-oriented ASU.
"ASU played well. They were
very scrappy," Shaw said. "But we
still passed the ball well and we
blocked a good share of balls."
Oden led the way in that
department with seven blocks
while Cooper added five of her
own. Injury-plagued ASU suc
cumbed to the home-court spoiler
Cardinal, 15-11,15-9,11-15,15-2.
Stanford returns to friendlier
confines for more conference com

petition this weekend. Washing
ton State will visit Burnham
Pavilion Friday for a 7:30 p.m.
match and Washington will follow
the next night.
Card notes
Fre√ühman setter Piper Hahn'a
older sister, Lindsey, was in atten
dance at the Arizona match as a radio
commentator. The elder Hahn played
collegiately as a setter for the Wildcats
from 1986-89.
Oden was Stanford's nominee for
Pac-10 Player-of-the-Week honors for
the third time this year. If she wins
the honor that will be announced
today, the first-team Ail-American will
have won the award back-to-back and
three of the last four times.
