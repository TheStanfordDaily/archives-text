# Sturm named Olympic coach
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When it comes to coaching, it
isn't easy to find a better job
than at Stanford. Fred Sturm
has found one.
The U.S. Volleyball Associa
tion named Sturm as the head
coach of the U.S. men's
National Team Friday. He will
join the program Jan. 1 and has
a contract that will take him
through the 1992 Olympics.
Assoc. Athletic Director
Cheryl Levick said the Univer
sity grants leaves of absence of
up to two years and that Sturm
would be able to return to his
current position after the
Barcelona Games.
"That really tipped the scales
heavily," Sturm said. "Taking
the job and leaving for two
years was a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity."
Sturm led the men's team at
Stanford to the NCAA champi

onship match in 1989, winning
national Coach-of-the-Year hon
ors in the process, and has
brought the Cardinal to the
postseason in five of the last six
years. He came to Stanford in
1978 to coach both the men and
the women and the Cardinal
has been on the rise ever since.
He helped build the women's
program to the point where the
team went to six consecutive
final fours in the mid 1980s. He
concentrated solely on the men
beginning in 1987 and Stanford
has been a top-five team the
past two years.
Sturm has a great deal of
experience with the national
team program as he served as
an assistant to Marv Dunphy
during the 1986 World Champi
onships and the 1988 Olympic
Games, both of which the U.S.
won. When Bill Neville resigned
as coach of the U.S. team earlier
this month, Sturm was the first
choice of the USVBA. He will
remain here until Dec. 1 direct

ing the men's program before
leaving for San Diego and the
National Team's training facil
ity.
"I think this is a great oppor
tunity for Fred," said Alan
Cummings, the acting athletic
director. "It is a credit to the job
he has done and to the program
here at Stanford."
Levick said that an interim
head coach would be named but
added that the selection process
is not yet underway. She
stressed, however, that main
taining continuity would be a
very important consideration
due to the interim nature of the
position. Ruben Nieves,
Sturm's assistant for the past
four years, would seem to be a
logical choice.
Several Sturm-coached play
ers are currently on the
National Team, including 1990
graduates Dan Hanan and
Parker Blackman, and 1988
gold medalist Scott Fortune.
