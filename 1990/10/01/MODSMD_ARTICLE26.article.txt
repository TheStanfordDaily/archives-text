# Women booted by No. 1 Broncos

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
For 45 minutes Saturday, the
women's soccer team outplayed
the No. 1 team in the nation, but
in the second half Stanford saw
the tables turned and lost 2-1.
Stanford, ranked No. 11, rat
tled undefeated Santa Clara with
a first-half goal from Julie Foudy,
but the Stanford defense tired and
was fortunate to allow only two
Bronco goals in the second half.
"I knew the job was only half
done. I knew we would continue to
play well. We played well, but we
just got a little tired," said Stan
ford coach Berhane Andeberhan.
"We played hard," he said. "All
I can ask for is for us to be a little
more lucky."
Stanford fell to 7-2 with the
home defeat, while the Broncos
retain their top ranking and climb
to 10-0. Santa Clara lost last year
in the NCAA semifinals and fin
ished the year ranked third.
The Maloney Field defeat
snaps a Stanford home winning
streak that started in 1988. Last
year Stanford tied No. 1 North
Carolina at home, and this season
the Cardinal had outscored oppo
nents 21-3 at Maloney.

of the game, as sophomore mid
fielder Foudy slashed a 10-yard
crossing shot over Bronco goalie
Sue Wall. After a penalty, forward
Carolyn Einstein kicked a down
field pass to a cutting Foudy, who
one-touched the ball past the last
defender and scored into the left
corner.
It was only the third goal all
season scored against Santa
Clara, and the second time they
had trailed. Wednesday at Santa
Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium, the
Broncos came from behind to beat
California 2-1. Stanford plays the
Golden Bears at Maloney Field,
Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.
But Foudy's goal was no fluke,
as Stanford turned up the offen
sive pressure another notch after
taking the lead 16 minutes into
the game. In the first half, Stan
ford outshot Santa Clara 7-4, with
Foudy firing five.
Thirty-two minutes into the
first half, Wall saved a sccond
Stanford goal with a diving save to
her right on a shot Foudy toma

hawked from just outside the
penalty box. In the next five min
utes, Foudy came close twice
more, just missing the left post
with a bullet shot from the right
side after a back-pass, and roiling
a left-footer one foot wide of the
right post on an angled shot.
Junior forward Elizabeth
Joneschild got in on the action
too, further traumatizing the
Santa Clara defense.
"Of course I would have liked
to finish some more of those
opportunities," said Foudy, who
scored her team-leading eighth
goal of the season. "We got in a
rhythm in the first half, but they
came out and got the early
momentum in the second half."
"They're number one, so one
paper they should beat us. But we
had them down and we should
have had them. Oh well," Foudy
said.
While Foudy and the Stanford
offense were passing circles
around the Santa Clara fullbacks,
Stanford goalie Elise Edwards
was having a surprisingly quiet
first half. Stanford threw a match
up zone defense on Santa Clara's
leading scorer, lanky forward
Brandi Chastain. With junior full

back Kerry Stivaletti, who, like
Chastain, played high school soc
cer at Archbishop Mitty in San
Jose, acting as her shadow, Chas
tain didn't get a shot off in the
first half.
"They seemed relatively lifeless
— for them anyway — in the first
half, but in the second half they
seemed to regroup," said
Edwards. "Everything was going
great, but they played a little
harder in the second half."
Stanford ended the half leading
1-0 and riding an emotional wave.
But Santa Clara dominated the
second half from start to finish, as
play revolved around Edwards in
the Stanford net.
"It was our first morning game
of the year, and our alarm clocks
just hadn't gone off," explained
Santa Clara coach Jerry Smith.
"In the first half it just didn't flow
for us, we didn't get the job done.
But we dominated the second
half."
"You get to be the number one
team in the country and you
sometimes think you can just
show up and van, but that isn't
the way it works," Smith contin
ued. "We got here because we
work hard, and we have to
remember that."

Twenty minutes into the half,
Chastain slipped past the defense
after a sideline throw-in and
slapped in her first goal. Then 11
minutes later — after Edwards
had prevented two goals in one
on-one emergencies — Chastain
sprinted into the box unmolested
after a great lead pass from Emily
Saarenas, and scored her 15th
goal of the season. It was the fifth
game in a row that she had scored
the winning goal.
"She played well all game,"
Andeberhan said about Chastain.
"She went across the field really
well. Our defense got a little tired,
but nobody quit — nobody gave
up."
Stanford wasn't able to mount
much of a threat after trailing,
and the Broncos outshot Stanford
10-2 in the second half, with Chas
tain getting six of the opportuni
ties.
"Stanford is a great team and
they will definitely be in the hunt
for the play-offs," Smith said.
"They are very well coached and
they have already beat some
tough teams this year."
Card notes
Stanford learned before the game
that sophomore midfielder Jen
Potok will be out for the season with
a knee injury she sustained Wednes
day in a 6-0 exhibition victory over
UCLA. She is scheduled Friday for
surgery on her anterior cruciate.
