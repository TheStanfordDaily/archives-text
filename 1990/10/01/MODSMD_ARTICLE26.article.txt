### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
For 45 minutes Saturday, the
women's soccer team outplayed
the No. 1 team in the nation, but
in the second half Stanford saw
the tables turned and lost 2-1.
Stanford, ranked No. 11, rat
tled undefeated Santa Clara with
a first-half goal from Julie Foudy,
but the Stanford defense tired and
was fortunate to allow only two
Bronco goals in the second half.
"I knew the job was only half
done. I knew we would continue to
play well. We played well, but we
just got a little tired," said Stan
ford coach Berhane Andeberhan.
"We played hard," he said. "All
I can ask for is for us to be a little
more lucky."
Stanford fell to 7-2 with the
home defeat, while the Broncos
retain their top ranking and climb
to 10-0. Santa Clara lost last year
in the NCAA semifinals and fin
ished the year ranked third.
The Maloney Field defeat
snaps a Stanford home winning
streak that started in 1988. Last
year Stanford tied No. 1 North
Carolina at home, and this season
the Cardinal had outscored oppo
nents 21-3 at Maloney.

of the game, as sophomore mid
fielder Foudy slashed a 10-yard
crossing shot over Bronco goalie
Sue Wall. After a penalty, forward
Carolyn Einstein kicked a down
field pass to a cutting Foudy, who
one-touched the ball past the last
defender and scored into the left
corner.
It was only the third goal all
season scored against Santa
Clara, and the second time they
had trailed. Wednesday at Santa
Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium, the
Broncos came from behind to beat
California 2-1. Stanford plays the
Golden Bears at Maloney Field,
Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.
But Foudy's goal was no fluke,
as Stanford turned up the offen
sive pressure another notch after
taking the lead 16 minutes into
the game. In the first half, Stan
ford outshot Santa Clara 7-4, with
Foudy firing five.
Thirty-two minutes into the
first half, Wall saved a sccond
Stanford goal with a diving save to
her right on a shot Foudy toma

hawked from just outside the
penalty box. In the next five min
utes, Foudy came close twice
more, just missing the left post
with a bullet shot from the right
side after a back-pass, and roiling
a left-footer one foot wide of the
right post on an angled shot.
Junior forward Elizabeth
Joneschild got in on the action
too, further traumatizing the
Santa Clara defense.
"Of course I would have liked
to finish some more of those
opportunities," said Foudy, who
scored her team-leading eighth
goal of the season. "We got in a
rhythm in the first half, but they
came out and got the early
momentum in the second half."
"They're number one, so one
paper they should beat us. But we
had them down and we should
have had them. Oh well," Foudy
said.
While Foudy and the Stanford
offense were passing circles
around the Santa Clara fullbacks,
Stanford goalie Elise Edwards
was having a surprisingly quiet
first half. Stanford threw a match
up zone defense on Santa Clara's
leading scorer, lanky forward
Brandi Chastain. With junior full

weekend. The Cardinal improved Its record outside of Maples Pavilion to 8-0 on the year going Into home
matches with Washington State and Washington this weekend.
