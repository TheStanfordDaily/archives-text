# Polo sweeps through tourney
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
If the NorCal Water Polo Tour
nament is any indication of how
good the Stanford water polo team
is, then Cardinal fans are in for an
incredible season.
In the tournament, which was
held at deGuerre Pool over the
weekend, the Cardinal dominated
its opponents and convincingly
won all six of its games. What
makes this even more impressive
is that the tournament featured
12 of the top 15 teams in the coun
try.
Stanford coach Dante Detta
manti is obviously pleased with
his team's performance. "This
was clearly our best showing of
the year. I'm really confident
about our team and feel that we're
playing like we should be playing
and like we can play."
Of the six games, only the game
against No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara
was ever in question, with the
Cardinal prevailing by a score of
9-8. Seniors Rick McNair and
Greg Olson each scored three
goals to lead the team to the vic
tory. McNair finished the tourna
ment with a team-high 13 goals.
The other five games were
really not that close, as the No. 33
Cardinal decisively showed why
the team is ranked so high. In all
of those games, Stanford jumped
to large eerly leads and then
cruised to victory.
Yesterday, the Cardinal con
cluded the tournament by demon
strating just how superior the

team was to its opponents.
Against seventh-ranked Fresno
State, an inspired defense and
strong goalie play from freshman
Larry Bercutt let the Cardinal
open up a 7-0 lead by halftime
which Fresno was never able to
recover from. The final score was
10-6.
Bercutt's performance in this
game was especially exciting for
Dettamanti, who has still not
decided whether Bercutt or junior
Jim Cairns will eventually become
the team's starting goalkeeper.
"Against Fresno State, Bercutt
completely shut them down and
just played an incredible game,"
Dettamanti said. "Hopefully he'll
have a lot more games like that."
The offense also did its part in
this game, as Olson scored three
times with McNair, senior Chuck
Maguy, and junior Greg Morris
each adding two goals.
Stanford also dominated
Brown in the morning game. The
Cardinal once again jumped out to
a huge halftime lead — this time
8-1 — and held on to win by a
score of 11-6. The Cardinal dis
played its balanced offensive
attack, as seven players managed
to put the ball into the net.
McNair, senior Colin Keely and
sophomore Chris Smith each fin
ished with two goals.

In the first game of the tourna
ment, Stanford took an early 8-0
lead and continued to overpower
No. 13 Cal State-Los Angeles 11-
3. Eight different players tallied
goals for the Cardinal in this
game, with Keely, sophomore
Mark Wallin and freshman Tom
Mitchell leading the way with two
goals apiece.
In Saturday's games, the Car
dinal team decisively defeated two
highly-ranked teams, defending
NCAA champion UC-Irvine and
No. 6 Pepperdine. In the Pepper
dine game, Stanford scored seven
times in the second quarter to pull
away from the Waves. The game
was never in doubt after this
offensive outburst, and the Cardi
nal held ofT a futile Pepperdine
rally to win by a score of 15-10.
The afternoon game against
Irvine was more of the same, with
the Cardinal taking a 9-2 halftime
lead on its way to a 12-6 victory.
Going into Stanford's next
game Friday against No. 1-ranked
California, who earlier defeated
the Cardinal 12-11, the weekend'p
performance will undoubtedly
help the team's confidence. Detta
manti said, "We really needed this
sort of thing. We have now shown
that we can beat the teams that
are ranked below us, and now we
have to go out and show that we
can beat the teams that are ahead
of us."
He continued, "We've got it
going now and just need to keep it
going. The game against Cal will
be the real big test."

strong goalie play from freshman
Larry Bercutt let the Cardinal
open up a 7-0 lead by halftime
which Fresno was never able to
recover from. The final score was
10-6.
Bercutt's performance in this
game was especially exciting for
Dettamanti, who has still not
decided whether Bercutt or junior
Jim Cairns will eventually become
the team's starting goalkeeper.
"Against Fresno State, Bercutt
completely shut them down and
just played an incredible game,"
Dettamanti said. "Hopefully he'll
have a lot more games like that."
The offense also did its part in
this game, as Olson scored three
times with McNair, senior Chuck
Maguy, and junior Greg Morris
each adding two goals.
Stanford also dominated
Brown in the morning game. The
Cardinal once again jumped out to
a huge halftime lead — this time
8-1 — and held on to win by a
score of 11-6. The Cardinal dis
played its balanced offensive
attack, as seven players managed
to put the ball into the net.
McNair, senior Colin Keely and
sophomore Chris Smith each fin
ished with two goals.

In the first game of the tourna
ment, Stanford took an early 8-0
lead and continued to overpower
No. 13 Cal State-Los Angeles 11-
3. Eight different players tallied
goals for the Cardinal in this
game, with Keely, sophomore
Mark Wallin and freshman Tom
Mitchell leading the way with two
goals apiece.
In Saturday's games, the Car
dinal team decisively defeated two
highly-ranked teams, defending
NCAA champion UC-Irvine and
No. 6 Pepperdine. In the Pepper
dine game, Stanford scored seven
times in the second quarter to pull
away from the Waves. The game
was never in doubt after this
offensive outburst, and the Cardi
nal held ofT a futile Pepperdine
rally to win by a score of 15-10.
The afternoon game against
Irvine was more of the same, with
the Cardinal taking a 9-2 halftime
lead on its way to a 12-6 victory.
Going into Stanford's next
game Friday against No. 1-ranked
California, who earlier defeated
the Cardinal 12-11, the weekend'p
performance will undoubtedly
help the team's confidence. Detta
manti said, "We really needed this
sort of thing. We have now shown
that we can beat the teams that
are ranked below us, and now we
have to go out and show that we
can beat the teams that are ahead
of us."
He continued, "We've got it
going now and just need to keep it
going. The game against Cal will
be the real big test."
