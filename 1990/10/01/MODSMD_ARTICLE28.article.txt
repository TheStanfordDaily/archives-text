# Men's soccer outdone in OT
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
If you ever plan on going to a
Stanford men's soccer game,
you'd better make a day of it.
Don't expect to be out of there
in 90 minutes.
The 3-3-5 Cardinal went into
overtime for the seventh and
eighth times in 11 games this
season, tying San Diego State
University (6-3-1) last Friday in
what was almost certainly the
most exciting finish in Stanford
soccer history before losing a
tough one to No. 2 UCLA (8-0-
3) on Sunday.
"Well, we try to give the fans
their money's worth," coach
Colin Lindores said, tongue held
firmly in cheek. "My friends
have been moaning about hav
ing to pay four bucks to see the
games all tne time, so we do
what we can do to keep them
entertained longer."
Soccer fans definitely got
their money's worth in Friday's
thriller. An apparent game-win
ning goal by Jason Vanacour
with 25 seconds remaining in
the last overtime period was
countered by an Aztec goal with
only nine ticks left on the clock.
"We've had a lot of trouble

holding leads," sweeper Randy
Mann said of the tie. "I've never
seen this happen before. Two
goals in 16 seconds. I don't
know whether to laugh or cry."
San Diego State forward
Brian Craft-Negrete, who
scored the game's dramatic final
goal, sure wasn't shedding any
tears. "When the other team
scores, when I get the ball I usu
ally just tap it back and head
downfield," he said. "This time,
I decided to drive with the ball
and just launch it." Craft-
Negrete's shot went off a Stan
ford player and into the goal.
Goalkeeper Kyle Krpata had
absolutely no chance at a save.
"It may have been a tie, but
psychologically, it's a loss," Lin
dores said after the game.
"Young teams are constantly
finding ways to better them
selves, and this game was an
excellent example." Lindores
later referred to the SDSU con
test as "another nail in the cof
fin of experience."

Well, UCLA brought their
hammers along too, and
pounded out a narrow 2-1 vic
tory when Joe-Max Moore
scored eight minutes into the
first overtime period and UCLA
keeper Brad Friedel made the
lead stand up with a plethora of
diving stops late in the game.
Two brilliant saves in the last 30
seconds, one as time expired,
secured the hard-fought victory
for the Bruins.
Coach Lindores was pleased
with his players' performaces in
the second game. "If a loss can
possibly be good, it was," he
said. "UCLA's got eight or nine
guys with experience on the U.S.
National Team, and any time
you can press those guys and
take them to overtime the way
we did . . . you've got to be
happy. We played them tight."
The game wouldn't have
been so tight had it not been for
the brilliant work in net by
Krpata. The Stanford goal
keeper made several spectacular
saves throughout the game,
most notably during the first
half, when UCLA threatened
repeatedly but failed to score.
The Bruins' best chance to go
ahead came with 26 minutes left
in the half. Junior forward Cobi
Jones made a dazzling run at the
goal and had a clear shot at the
net when Krpata came out to
challenge him. Krpata made a
brilliant deflection of Jones' shot
and the ball rolled to a Stanford
defender.
UCLA broke the 0-0 deadlock
when freshman Zak Ibsen ham
mered one home with 14 minutes
led in regulation.
After the UCLA goal, Stanford
turned it up a notch as Vanacour
scored on a pass from Jim Talluto
four minutes later, and the Cardi
nal headed for what has become
more of a third period than a true
overtime for the Stanford boot
ers, who have tied the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams in the nation this sea
son while losing to several
unranked teams and taking oth
ers into overtime.
Taking a lot of others into
overtime, that is. The squad has
played some 240 minutes of over
time this year, almost the length
of three full regulation contests.
Unfortunately, Stanford has just
one win to show in eight such
games, losing two and tying five.
It's good to see the fans getting
their money's worth.
