# Women golfers take second
## 
### Noah Blake 
Sometimes teams dig them
selves a hole early in a competi
tion and have to climb out of it.
Stanford's women's golf team
used a steamshovel in the first
round of the Dick McGuire Invita
tional, shooting 24 over par on the
front nine, but still managed to
finish second to a solid New Mex
ico State team in the three-day
event.
The Cardinal's main concern
when they left the Farm was stay
ing healtny, since they took only
four linksters to Albuquerque,
N.M. Normally, five women com
pete on a squad, and the lowest
round each day is dropped from
the overall team score. Thus not
only did all four golfers have to
finish the tournament, but each
golfer had to play well every day,
since each round counted.
Unfortunately, that included
Friday's first round, after which
the Cardinal was 11 shots back of
New Mexico State. By Stanford
coach Tim Baldwin's own admis
sion, the 40 mile-per-hour winds
that battered the course through
out the first round "caught [the
team] off balance," while the New
Mexico State team, which was
familiar with the conditions, fin-

ished the day a relatively impres
sive 18 over par.
So the Cardinal had to play
catch-up for the last two rounds,
and the team played it very well,
finishing the tournament only
four shots back of the Aggies. In
the process, Stanford finished
ahead of Texas Christian Univer
sity, Texas, Southern Methodist
University, Oklahoma (all
described by Baldwin as "golf
powers") and nine other teams.
"We had a good outing," he said,
"and I've got four really solid
golfers who want to win, and
will."

The team's comeback was lead
by Adele Moore, who finished two
shots behind SMU's Barb Black
well, the tournament's individual
champion. Audrey Wooding, who
finished fifth overall, shot the low*
est round of the entire tourna
ment, a 72, earning her acclaim
from Baldwin as "one heck of a
player." With good rounds on Sat
urday and Sunday, Stephanie
Davis finished 16th.
Jodi Figley, the Cardinal's
number one player, finished 23rd.
"Jodi hit the ball solidly," said
Baldwin, "but she just didn't putt
well. Putting is the strength of her
game, and I think that if she had
been her normal self, we would
have won."
But the team isn't worrying
about not winning a tournament
played in such abnormal
tions. "We beat a lot of good
teams," added Baldwin, "and the
girls are satisfied with the way
that they played."
Next up for the linksters is
Washington's tournament, which
runs Oct. 15-17 in Seattle. Once
again the Cardinal will face a
strong field, but Baldwin puts it
simply: "We're going up there to
win."
