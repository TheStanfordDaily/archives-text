# Students form Middle East group
## 
### Nicholas Hass 
With tensions mounting in the Persian Gulf, a
group of students has formed the Stanford Middle
East Action Committee to provide information to
students on Middle East issues.
Though the current Gulf crisis provided the
impetus for the group's founding, several of the stu
dents had considered starting such an organization
before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
"People are sort of perked up to [Middle East
issues] right now," said senior Erin Clune, a mem
ber. She noted this new interest may motivate stu
dents to learn more about the poorly understood
social and political conditions in the Middle East.
The formation of the committee coincides with a
faculty-organized Middle East Teach-in Oct. 8
questioning American military involvement in Saudi
Arabia. The Teach-in will focus on media and gov
ernment racism against Arabs, gender issues and
the effect of U.S. politics in the Middle East on the
environment and energy.
According to committee member Kate Morris, a
graduate student in computer science, the group
aims to provide information so students can form
personal opinions on Middle East issues based on
sound knowledge.
Clune and Morris said the action committee will
continue to exist after the resolution of the current
crisis.
The Gulf will continue to be "a problem region,"
Clune said, stressing the need for American under
standing of the area. The group will examine other
Middle East issues such as Israeli-Palestinian rela
tions.
The action committee will also plan educational
events including a Palestinian-Arab cultural night,

as well as cultural and historical programs in dorms,
Clune added.
She noted that the founders would like the mem
bership of the organization to include a wide range
of backgrounds and political beliefs.
Along with providing information, the group
wants people to be aware they can influence govern
mental decisions, Clune said.
At the Teach-in, David Harris, a former Stanford
student body president and Vietnam veteran, will
speak out with other veterans and student speakers
against war and the draft. A keynote address by
Pacifica Radio National Affairs Correspondent
Larry Bensky, who covered the Iran-Contra scandal,
will conclude the day's events.
Assoc. History Prof. Joel Beinin said Americans
have only a small understanding of recent events in
the Gulf. "Why are [troops] really there?" Beinin
asked. "That's not been openly discussed."
In an effort to increase understanding of issues
leading to the Gulf crisis, Beinin and others will dis
cuss the Middle East buildup in a panel discussion
called "The Truth Behind the Headlines."
Williamson Evers, a visiting scholar at the
Hoover Institution, will also speak against U.S. mil
itary presence in the Middle East.
Beinin said military involvement could greatly
hurt the economy, citing the economic decline which
began in the Vietnam era.
"The more you know about this [issue] the more
you have to be concerned," Beinin said.
Although it is currently funded wholly by its
members, the action committee is applying for
ASSU funds.
Representatives of the action committee will be in
White Plaza this week and will hold an organiza
tional meeting Oct. 10.
