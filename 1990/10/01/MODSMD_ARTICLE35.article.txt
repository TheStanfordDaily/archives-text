# Thousands crowd Quad for show
## 'Stanford: A Place in History' opens to rave reviews 
### Steve Mitzenmacher 
Though its $36,000 price tag and 18-minute
length may seem-paltry by some standards, last
night's premiere of "Stanford: A Place in History"
rivaled that of any Hollywood opening.
Several thousand people crowded the Inner Quad
last night to catch a glimpse of the debut of this inno
vative multimedia show, designed and produced by
senior Mike Topolovac and 1990 graduate Ken Beer.
Topolovac introduced the show by promising,
"Mom, I will graduate this year," while Beer extend
ed a warm welcome to the freshman class. Both wore
tie and tails over their jeans.
Beer explained the development of the show, from
t'opolovac's original idea two years ago for a "cool,
multi-image show on Stanford undergraduate life"
to the finished product.
"After looking through about 30,000 slides and
spending this entire summer rooting through shots
Of last year, we've got this show, which is run by six
computer-operated projectors and accompanied by a

totally student-provided soundtrack," Beer said.
The videotaped version of the slide show was used
for last night's screening.
Alumni, faculty and students found the show
emotional and stirring. Applied Physics Prof. Walter
Harrison said, "It was great. It makes me want to be
a student again."
"Pictures from Aspen, Kyoto, football games, all
had so many memories," said senior Tia Yensen.
"And the quotes were so powerful."
Senior Kari Murnane agreed. "Seeing those
images on the screen makes this place definitely feel
like home."
Seniors were not the only students moved by the
production. "It serves as a reminder that there is
truly no place I would rather be," said freshman
Michelle Friedland.
The celebration continued after the show with a
fireworks display and a reception. The Stanford
Band played in front of the Quad, and the slide show
was repeated for those who wanted a second viewing.
