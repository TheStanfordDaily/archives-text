# Knight Fellow's brother kidnapped in Colombia
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
For former Knight Fellow Rafael Santos,
the Colombian drug war has hit home. For the
past 13 days, Colombian drug dealers have
held his brother Francisco Santos captive.
Francisco Santos is news editor of El
Tiempo, Colombia's largest-selling newspaper.
Five armed men kidnapped him Sept. 19 in his
car, killing his driver.
Santos said the MedelHn cocaine cartel
abducted his brother to intimidate his family,
which runs El Tiempo. He said the cartel
wants to "press the paper to not have a line of
thought" critical of it. Santos added that his
brother, 28, is "a symbol of a new generation."
"He is young and was writing courageously
about all sorts of topics," Santos said.
James Risser, director of the Knight Fellow
ship Progp-am which brings national and inter
national journalists to Stanford to study for a
year, announced a formal protest Tuesday

against the kidnapping. "It is an outrageous
situation when this happens to journalists or
to anyone else," he said.
Francisco Santos suffers from bronchitis
and must take two medicines regularly, El
Tiempo reported Sept. 20.
Rafael Santos said he has not heard from
the cartel about conditions for his brother's
release. Santos is the latest of seven journal
ists to be kidnapped by MedelHn drug dealers
in three weeks.
The cartel may have started the wave of
kidnappings because of the Colombian govern
ment's refusal to grant them complete
amnesty. A new law announced Sept. 5 offers
drug dealers leniency in exchange for coopera
tion with Colombian government prosecutors.
But Colombian President C6sar Gaviria Tru
jillo reiterated Sept. 21 the government's
stance that amnesty could only be granted for
political crimes.
According to an article in the Sept. 23 New
York Times, many drug analysts doubted

Medellfn cartel leader Pablo Escobar would
settle for anything less than full amnesty for
himself.
Colombian officials told the kidnapped
journalists' family members that the govern
ment will not negotiate with Escobar.
Santos said the Colombian press has always
been intimidated by drug dealers. The second
largest paper in Colombia, El Espectador, was
bombed last year. Since 1987, more than 30
journalists have been murdered for being pub
licly critical of the cartel or for publicly sup
porting the extradition treaty between Colom
bia and the United States.
Intimidation extends to the rest of the pub
lic as well. Latin American studies graduate
student Mark Paramo, who recently returned
from Colombia, said police typically travel in
groups of eight to 12 to protect themselves
from drug cartel hit men. He also cited an inci
dent in which 60 Medellfn citizens were killed
in one weekend because they were out after a
9 p.m. curfew enforced by drug dealers.
