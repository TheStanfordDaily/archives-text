# Wilson lauds Stanford, value of public service

### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Preceding his appearance at yesterday's
Centennial Celebration activities, Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., praised Stanford as "one of
the great universities in the world" in an
interview with The Daily last Wednesday.
Speaking from his cellular car phone in the
midst of his campaign for California governor,
Wilson called Stanford a university with "an
important past and an even more important
future."
Wilson also lauded the University for tak
ing a leading role in issues of diversity but was
critical of Stanford's 1987 decision to replace
the required Western Culture program with
Cultures, Ideas and Values. "It is fine to be an
innovator and play a leading role, but expand
ing the horizon rather than replacing Western
Culture would have been my own decision," he
said.
"I don't see any point in downgrading West
ern Culture," Wilson added.
Education would be a focus in his adminis
tration if elected governor, Wilson said. "Cali
fornia is particularly blessed with great uni
versities, both public and private."
"Private and public universities in Califor
nia together comprise a very healthy competi
tion — particularly In the area of research,
with the mere presence of an esteemed faculty
on both sides of the Bay at Berkeley and at
Stanford," he said.
Wilson also encouraged Stanford students
.3 direct their energies toward public service.
Public service "is one of the more exciting
things that is happening — something that

should be encouraged and
congratulated." Wilson said a
number of Stanford students
have served in his Washington
and state offices, and some
have risen to be senior staff
members in his organization.
"It's a great experience for
the students," he said.
Wilson said he would incor
porate academia at Stanford

and other universities into government. "Indi
vidual faculty members and different faculties
at Stanford will be asked to supply informa
tion and expertise if I am privileged enough to
serve as governor," he said.
The resources of Stanford and the Hoover
Institution are particularly valuable to state
and federal governments, Wilson said. "Even
though the focus of Hoover is national and
international, it is an example of the kind of
institution that can provide a rich historical
perspective. If you are truly going to study
government, you must have a facility of that
kind of scholarship," he added.
Wilson also responded to numerous charges
in the national media that the campaigning
between him and his opponent, former San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, was
unnecessarily negative. "I think you're fully
entitled to be critical of opponents with whom
you disagree, although I think that misrepre
sentation is unfair," he said.
"Campaigns are for informing voters,"he
said. "It is fair to compare histories, as well as
campaign promises, but it must be both factu
ally accurate and fair."
Wilson said Feinstein's television advertise

ment that linked him to the collapse of the sav
ings and loan industry was "sheer innuendo,
an ad that could have no other purpose but to
attack my image."
Wilson accused Feinstein of firing the first
shot in the exchange over the savings and loan
disaster. "Our response was necessitated by
her attack," he said. "We felt it necessary to
fight back."
Gender should not be a campaign issue,
Wilson said. "I don't find it relevant. We
should be compared not on the basis of gender,
but on accomplishment," he noted.
Feinstein's use of gender as an issue in the
campaign "has cost her support, both with
women and men. I have spoken to a number of
women who felt that her appeal was insulting
to women," Wilson said.
Another contentious issue of the campaign
has been Feinstein's statement that represen
tation of women and people of color in her
administration would be in proportion with
California's population. The statement was
soon clarified by Feinstein after Wilson
charged her with supporting quotas in the
state government.
Wilson told The Daily he would appoint
government posts solely "on the basis of
merit." By affording "equal opportunity to
every citizen in the society, you will have a very
broad participation from all areas of society —
women, Hispanics, blacks, Asians," he said.
Speaking of the increasing proportion of
people of color in California, Wilson said, "Cal
ifornia is blessed by this diversity. We
shouldn't just tolerate it; we should celebrate
it."
