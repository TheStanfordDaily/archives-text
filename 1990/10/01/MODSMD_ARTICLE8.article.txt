# Looking ahead, juniors gather for Convocation
## 
### Janine DeFao Editorial staff 
Against the backdrop of a
black stage and faculty mem
bers in traditional academic
garb, the Junior Convocation
yesterday provided a stark con
trast to the fun-filled Sopho
more Celebration.
But the sun, balloons and
Band were absent from Memo
rial Auditorium for a reason,
said Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow. The
"somber" convocation marks
the beginning of the second
half of the Stanford career
which Wasow said should be
very different from the first
half.
While the University "en
courages academic breadth" in
the freshman and sophomore
years, faculty hope juniors will
"now begm to pursue a chosen
field in depth," he said.
Wasow encouraged the
juniors to "take an active role
in [their] education, design a
mqjor, find faculty members to
work with and do individual
research" even if it takes

"knocking on doors and mak
ing telephone calls."
Three members of the class
performed poetry and music.
Erin Rosen read two original
poems, one on Africa and the
other "expressing the close
ness to death I feel in life," she
said. Margaret Richen per
formed violin music by Johann
Sebastian Bach, and Leta
Huang, winner of the Humani
ties and Sciences award for
music performance, played the
piano.
Continuing the Convoca
tion's tone, Dean of the School
of Engineering James Gibbons
gave an address which was not
unlike that of the infamous
"Dear Undeclared Junior" let
ter.
Gibbons dissuaded students
from changing majors fre
quently and suggested they
"choose one thing that inter
ests [them] and do it well."
He said some may have
questioned the decision to get a
liberal arts education at a
research university, but
assured students they had
made the right choice.
