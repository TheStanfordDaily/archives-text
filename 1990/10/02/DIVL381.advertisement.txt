ington International Studies Council to recommend qualified
students to study for one year or for one or two terms. Lower
Junior status is required, and graduate study is available. Stu
dents are directly enrolled in their colleges and receive transcripts
from their Oxford college: this is NOT a program conducted by a
U.S. College in Oxford. 3.2 minimum index in major required.
An alternative program which is sponsored by a U.S. Univer
sity is available for students with minimum indexes of 2.7. Stu
dents will have social and athletic rights in an Oxford college, and
the fees are substantially less.
Many educators believe that the tutorial system of Oxford
and Cambridge (in which one scholar teaches one or two stu
dents very intensively) provides a unique liberal arts education
Evaluations (writen or by telephone) from previous Oxford stu
dents from your college, or in vour field, can usually be arranged
by WISC. .
