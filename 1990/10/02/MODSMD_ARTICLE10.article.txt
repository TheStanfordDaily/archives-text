Princeton club to allow women
Princeton's all-male Ivy Club announced it will
finally open its doors to women. Club President
Blair Haarlow confirmed that women will be
allowed to bicker, or apply for membership, this
fall.
The new gender-blind admission policy is the
result of a federal judge's ruling ordering the club
to comply with the New Jersey Supreme Court's
decision that clubs cannot exclude applicants
from bickering based solely on gender. Ivy mem
bers are reported to be "excited," with only small
pockets of resistance.

Penn changes alcohol policy
The University of Pennsylvania Interfrater
nity Council has established a new alcohol policy
that will apply to all fraternities on campus.
Under the policy, fraternities may not provide
beer kegs or other large containers of alcohol.
Students can bring their own alcohol to par
ties, not exceeding 12 cans of beer or an equal
amount of liquor. Student IDs will be checked at
the door by professional bouncers, and students
who are 21 and over will be issued bracelets.
Bouncers will ticket each guest's alcohol, issue
claim tickets and hold the alcohol until the guest
redeems a claim ticket.
The policy change came after national frater
nity officials warned of possible liability problems
resulting when chapters purchased alcohol with
chapter funds. Campus officials will police the
new policy, taking pressure and responsibility off
the fraternities.

Columbia pushes PIRG chapter
The Columbia University College Student
Council has voted to recognize a group that will
try to establish a chapter of New York Public
Interest Research Group, a student-run lobbying
group founded by consumer advocate Ralph
Nader.
Once a PIRG chapter is formed, every student
will be considered a member and $3 will be added
to student fees to fund the group. Refunds will be
given to individual students who do not agree
with the group, according to PIRG representative
Jim Blevins.
One of the first activities NY-PIRG will concen
trate on is forming a statewide New York Task
Force on Financial Aid. Members hope the task

force will be able to effectively influence the reau
thorization of the federal Higher Education Act of
1965. The Act authorizes funding for Financial aid
and is due to be reauthorized this year.

Duke bans freshmen from parties
For the second year in a row, Duke University
has issued a moratorium on freshmen attending
upperclass parties during the first week of school.
The moratorium, which strictly prohibits fresh
men from attending upperclass social events, is
designed to make the social transition from high
school to college easier.
Officials feel that the limitation will de
emphasize alcohol on campus and encourage
freshmen to mingle with each other and form
friendships in a community environment.
However, students call the policy ineffective,
saying that freshmen find other ways to obtain
alcohol, and that as college students they should
be responsible for their own actions.

Texans protest military action
Students rallied on the University of Texas at
Austin campus in protest of American military
intervention in the Middle East. Speakers at the
rally called U.S. presence motivated by self-inter
est, not concern for universal human rights.
Speakers also accused the government and the
press of hiding important information and justify
ing military action in the Gulf to sway public opin
ion. Rally participants circulated pledge-of-resis
tance declaration cards and urged all students to
sign.

Indiana ethics code revised
At Indiana University, the Code of Student
Ethics has been revised. According to officials, a
new system of punishments may make it easier to
prevent such crimes as date rape and vandalism.
The Code will allow for quicker intervention by
the University, requiring less proof of wrongdoing
before problem areas can be investigated.
In addition, punishment policies regarding
alcohol will now include alternatives such as
counseling and restitution, as well as the tradi
tional punishment of suspension or expulsion.
