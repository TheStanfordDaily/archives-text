Bush begins selling
painful budget plan
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
and congressional leaders of both parties
began the tough election-year task Monday of
selling their painful $500 billion deficit-reduc
tion compromise to wary rank-and-file law
makers.
Democrats said the task of building support
for the package of tax increases and spending
cuts would be helped greatly if Bush would
deliver a television address explaining to
Americans why the nation's ailing economy
needs such bitter budgetary medicine.
Exxon may sue Coast Guard
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Exxon Corp.
and its shipping subsidiary have filed notices of
claims against the Coast Guard totaling more
than $2 billion in connection with the Exxon
Valdez shipwreck and oil spill.
Exxon spokesman Les Rogers said the Sept.
21 filings satisfy an administrative require
ment that preserves options for Exxon and
Exxon Shipping Co. to sue the Coast Guard
over the spill.
Exxon declined to offer an explanation for
why company officials think the Coast Guard
should share responsibility for the March 24,
1989, accident in which the Exxon Valdez
ripped its bottom open on a reef, spilling nearly
11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince
William Sound.
Iran, Syria may soon
free hostages
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — The Beirut
newspaper Ad-Diyar reported yesterday that
presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hashemi
Rafsanjani of Iran have agreed on a step-by
step plan to free Western hostages in Lebanon.
The conservative daily, citing unnamed
diplomatic sources, said Assad worked out the
accord in talks with Rafsaryani last week in
Tehran.

tian South Lebanon Army free the 340
Moslems it holds in exchange for releasing
their captives.
