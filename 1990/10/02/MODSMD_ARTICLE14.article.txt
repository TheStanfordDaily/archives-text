CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— An unmanned Delta rocket
blasted into space yesterday with
a $65 million navigation satellite
designed to guide U.S. war planes,
ships and other military craft with
extreme accuracy.
It was the Air Force's third
attempt in four days to launch the
rocket. Bad weather caused the
delays.
Thunderstorms had been pre
dicted again for yesterday, but the
weather cooperated and the
rocket roared from Cape Can
averal Air Force Station at 5:56
p.m.

Liftoff was delayed 25 minutes
because of the need to wait for an
aircraft to clear the area and to
regain contact with a command
backup transmitter at Bermuda.
'he NAVSTAR satellite sepa
-d from the booster about 25
minutes into the flight and settled
in an orbit 12,532 miles above
Earth.
"Everything looks normal
everything appears to have gone
well," said Air Force Lt. Col. Jim
Jannette.
The 3,675-pound satellite is the
ninth in a series of advanced

Global Positioning System space
craft capable of pinpointing the
location of U.S. military units
within 50 feet in any weather any
where in the world.
The first NAVSTAR spacecraft
was launched in February 1989.
Fifteen more NAVSTAR satel
lites are scheduled to be launched
by early 1993 under the $8.5 bil
lion program. Three will serve as
spares.
The 128-foot-tall Delta 2 space
rocket was supplied by McDonnell
Douglas Space Systems Co. of
Huntington Beach, Calif.
