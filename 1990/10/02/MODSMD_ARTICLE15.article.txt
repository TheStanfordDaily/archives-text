# Bush hints at reconciliation
## 
### 
(AP) — President Bush assailed Iraq yesterday
but hinted that a withdrawal from Kuwait could lead
to settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Israel
warned its response to an Iraqi attack would be
"harsh and painful," and said it was giving out gas
masks to all citizens.
The White House, meanwhile, announced the
United States was sending two batteries of Patriot
air-defense missiles to Israel to help defend against
an increased threat from ballistic missiles in Iraq.
In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
ordered the release of nine French nationals believed
to have been detained at strategic Iraqi installations
as shields against attack.
It was Saddam's second conciliatory gesture to the
West in as many days. On Sunday, he had urged a
peaceful international dialogue, and mentioned
France as a possible negotiating partner.
U.S., French and British officials all rejected
Saddam's offer yesterday, saying they wouldn't talk
until Iraq withdrew from Kuwait.
Also yesterday, Iran's official news agency said
the foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia met in
New York on Sunday for the first such high-level
talks since the nations broke diplomatic ties 2 1/2
years ago.
Although no progress was reported, the meeting
was the most positive sign yet that the two countries
may be moving toward a rapprochement. A reconcil
iation would help draw Iran into the anti Iraq camp
and intensify Saddam's isolation.
Saddam has been courting neighboring Iran, itd
war enemy from 1980-88, for help in puncturing the
U.N. economic embargo imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2.
In other developments:
• Oil prices tumbled $3 per barrel to $36.10 fol*
lowing Bush's speech at the United Nations, which
was seen as raising hopes of a diplomatic solution to
the 2-month-old crisis. As oil fell, stock prices
increased. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
jumped 63 points to 2,515.84.
• Saddam addressed a message to particpants in a
U.N. summit on children, telling them U.N. sanc
tions against Iraq are depriving Iraqi children of
milk and food — "a matter of deep concern and
regret." J
• Iraq denied responsiblity for a grenade attack
Thursday on a Djibouti cafe in which a French child
was killed. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
had said France would retaliate if Iraq was found
responsible.
