Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev proclaimed the end of the
Cold War in his visit to Stanford last
spring. The tangible effects of thaw
ing East-West relations are climaxing
with the unification of Germany
tomorrow, the Day of German Unity.
As a symbol of a more hospitable
world, the unification of Germany is
unequivocally positive. But in realis
tic terms, apprehension about the
unification of the two countries

hangs in the air.
Many doubts have been raised
about the idea of uniting a country
which has twice thrown the world
into war. Although such misgivings
are real, the world climate has
changed significantly.
The chances for a unified Ger
many to wage imperial war in the
future are "pretty slim — unless
there is some country around who is
stupid enough to force Germany into

that role," said Political Science Prof.
Hans Weiler, a specialist in European
politics. Weiler noted that, unlike his
torical Germany, the two Germ any s
are becoming fully integrated into
the European community and have
seen the viability of democratic gov
ernment — a key change in world
politics.
Unified Germany's membership
in NATO has been a topic of much
debate, the importance of which
seems to have been overplayed.
"NATO is history for all practical
purposes," Weiler said. Instead, the

Council of Security and Cooperation,
a group which has existed for 10
years, has guided Germany toward
unification and indeed has taken
over NATO's position of building a
European alliance, Weiler said.
Another question which remains
to be answered is how well the two
German peoples will coexist after
unification. From a social stand
point, the unification "will itot work
too well," Weiler said. "A lot of hard
feelings exist. The collective psychol
ogy is not too terribly healthy."
