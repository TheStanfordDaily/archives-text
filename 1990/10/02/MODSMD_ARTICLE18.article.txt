## Stadium surprises 
### 
TWO THINGS SHOULD BE
apparent from the first two
weeks of home football
games.
First, the new alcohol policy for
bidding alcohol in Stanford Sta
dium and other athletic facilities is
working well. And second, the yell
leaders are not.
Last year, the University pro
posed four meg or changes in its
alcohol policy, including prohibit
ing alcohol at games. As former
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
pointed out, "it's clear that we've
had too many problems" at past
sporting events.
In part, Geiger was referring to
last years's Big Game, where sev
eral spectators were hit by rocks
and unopened beer cans thrown by
intoxicated fans, and 27 were
arrested for alcohol-related
offenses.
But while such behavior was
more prevalent at the Cal-Stanford
matchup, it was by no means lim
ited to it.
About 45 percent favored the
stadium proposal, according to an
ASSU poll conducted last year of
more than 1,100 undergraduates.
We're not sure what the 43 per
cent of the students polled were
thinking when they opposed the
proposal. Maybe they enjoy being
pelted with beer cans or having
people stumble over them drunk
enly.
Most students, however, do not.
And for them, the policy has
resulted in afternoons that are
more safe and enjoyable.
Unfortunately, the same cannot
be said of the yell leaders.
Let's face it. Even if they were
the best cheerleaders in the coun
try, they'd be unwanted.
And as their performance at Sat
urday's game showed, they've got
lot of improvements to make
before they can even claim they're
the best in the county.

Geiger initiated the yell leaders
to improve morale during the
games and to satisfy alumni who
preferred a more conventional
approach to cheering than the
Band or the dollies provide.
Although the idea was com
mendable, the execution needs
more work. Because they had their
back to the field most of the game,
they often mistimed their cheers.
And to top it off, they misspelled
the school name in one of their
cheers.
For whatever reasons, Stanford
students simply don't want to have
cheerleaders, as shown by a Daily
poll last spring.
In a sampling of 285 students,
45.6 percent disapproved of the
Athletics Department's plan to cre
ate the team in the first place,
while only 24 percent thought the
idea was laudable.
Following Saturday's display,
it's unlikely that the yell leaders
will have many rah-rah flagwavers
of their own in the student body.
Although the yell leaders mean
veil, they are disliked so much
they seem counterproductive;
many fans stayed silent during key
situations in the game to avoid
looking as though they supported
the squad.
Already, people are talking about
using the yell leaders as "target
practice" and are readying their
water balloons and other weapons.
If the Athletics Department is
intent on keeping yell leaders, it
should train them better for their
job and have them cheer by the
alumni section.
If its goal is to spark student
spirit, they can use the expensive
electronic scoreboard to display
stunning graphics.
At the end of the season, if not
earlier, they should reassess the
success of the program. From all
indications, though, the yell lead
ers are a lost cause.
