Stanford Gorby film
omitted protestors
After Gorbachev's visit on June 4 last
spring, the Stanford Alumni Association
and the Stanford Instructional Televi
sion Network produced and distributed a
one-hour film commemorating the visit.
The film consists of footage of the
visit, Gorbachev's speech in its entirety
and a lot of glowing comments — from
President Kennedy, from former Secre
tary of State George Schultz and from
the film's narrator — about Gorbachev's
greatness and about the visit as a great
historical event.
The description on the back of the
film package talks about "his handshak
ing tour of the Quadrangle that thrilled
thousands of students, staff and faculty
waiting to see him" and states that "it
was a great day for him and a great day
for the University."
Because of its production by organiza
tions officially affiliated with the Univer
sity, and because of the Stanford logos
appearing on it, the film is naturally per
ceived by those who watch it as repre
senting Stanford University, and so the
film creates the impression that admira
tion for Gorbachev, and a view of his
visit as "a great day for the University,"
are the universal, unquestioned position
of the Stanford community.
In fact, during Gorbachev's visit,
many students were not thrilled at all.
Hundreds of protesters were waiting
for Gorbachev when he arrived, repre
senting several independent groups.
Most of the protesters came from off
campus, but many others were Stanford
students.
The protests were reported by The
Stanford Daily, the local newspapers and
the TV news broadcasts. I was active in
one of the protests, which included both
students and off-campus people who
believed it was wrong for Stanford Uni
versity to welcome the leader of a totali
tarian country.
I think the protests were an impor-

tant aspect of the visit and of the Stan
ford community's reaction to the visit.
This aspect is almost completely ignored
by the Alumni Association film.
In the footage of the limousines driv
ing into campus, some protest signs are
seen in the background but Eire too far
away to be seen clearly.
There is also a segment of about 10
seconds in which the camera goes over
some protest signs, never staying on any
one sign long enough to allow reading it,
and without any words spoken by the
narrator.
In the narration and the interviews
throughout the film, among all the state
ments about how thrilled everyone was
by the visit, the protests are never men
tioned, not even in one sentence.
The film was made without any
attempt to gather information from
Stanford students or to find out what
people thought about its appropriate
ness.
When I expressed my objections to the
Alumni Association, I was told that the
issue is over, that the film was already
made and distributed and nothing can be
done about it at this stage.
I believe that the University should
publicly review the appropriateness of
the film, and of the way it was produced
and publicized, and decide whether some
action should be taken now to correct it.

Yell leader abuse
harsh, not tolerant
I read David Hyatt's letter in Mon
day's Daily and didn't know if I should
laugh or cry.
In its most basic form, Hyatt's letter
tells the Stanford yell leaders they are
worthless and should consider a new
hobby.
Apparently Hyatt hasn't taken too •
much away from his Stanford experi-

ence. (On reflection, though, this may
explain his "senior undeclared" status.)
What happened to diversity? What
happened to live and let live? What hap
pened to just minding your own
business? Aren't these the fundamental
principles of Stanford? Isn't this the
package mom and dad think they are
paying for?
In some respects, I might be like
Hyatt. I find my cheering to be more
effective using an individual, stream-of
consciousness approach rather than
working within the constraints of the
structured cheering.
And I am clearly not elevated to a
higher plane of cheering by the yell lead
ers' constant exhortations. While I
believe this to be my individual style of
cheering, I also believe that others cheer
best under different environments. Some
might like the yell leaders, some might
not. To each their own.
Furthermore, it seems to me that if
the students who double as yell leaders
on the weekend feel strongly enough
about the Stanford community that they
are willing to make what must be a two
or three-day commitment each week to
enhancing school spirit, then we ought
to let them be.
I don't think you have to cheer when
they cheer or clap when they clap, but at
least give them the courtesy of leaving
them alone. Though I would hesitate to
paint them as martyrs, the yell leaders
do display a good deal of courage in their
bid to excite our traditionally subdued
fans.
From the comments in the stands
over the last two weekends it seems
Hyatt is not alone in his thoughts about
the yell leaders.
A good part of the yell leaders' activity
is drowned out by boos and this past
weekend the "Tastes Great/Less Filling"
chant was even used by the Band to
mock the yell leaders.
I hope the yell leaders don't take
Hyatt's letter or the constant harass
ment from the stands and The Band too
seriously. You probably won't catch me
spelling out C-A-R-D-I-N-A-L with you

at the USC game, but I do support your
right to do as you like.

Stanford needs new,
responsible policy
Loving absurdity, I was delighted to
learn that Diana Conklin speaks for
Stanford on drug and alcohol policy
(Daily, September 28).
Who better at a University that has
long flouted state law by serving alcohol
to minors and is now evidently preparing
to evade the new federal Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act?
For years, Stanford has permitted its
premises to be used for widely advertised
public events at which alcohol is served
not only to underage Stanford students
but also to students from surrounding
high schools. University-administered
funds support these activities.
The results are predictable. Almost
every year someone is seriously injured
in an alcohol-induced accident or nearly
suffocates in his own vomit dormitories
are set afire young girls are molested;
and the Cowell Student Health Center is
kept busy attending to the less serious
cases.
The University says grandly that
these risks must be accepted so that stu
dents may learn to be responsible for
their own behavior.
It is not students' responsibility that
is in question, however, but administra
tors'.
No one suggests that deans should
ransack dorms in search of bottles or
conduct random urine tests. But is it too
much to ask that they not encourage,
defend and engage in illegal activity?
Obeying the law is not left to the dis
cretion of individual citizens, however
superior they think themselves. It is a
bedrock duty that binds all.

working within the constraints of the
structured cheering.
And I am clearly not elevated to a
higher plane of cheering by the yell lead
ers' constant exhortations. While I
believe this to be my individual style of
cheering, I also believe that others cheer
best under different environments. Some
might like the yell leaders, some might
not. To each their own.
Furthermore, it seems to me that if
the students who double as yell leaders
on the weekend feel strongly enough
about the Stanford community that they
are willing to make what must be a two
or three-day commitment each week to
enhancing school spirit, then we ought
to let them be.
I don't think you have to cheer when
they cheer or clap when they clap, but at
least give them the courtesy of leaving
them alone. Though I would hesitate to
paint them as martyrs, the yell leaders
do display a good deal of courage in their
bid to excite our traditionally subdued
fans.
From the comments in the stands
over the last two weekends it seems
Hyatt is not alone in his thoughts about
the yell leaders.
A good part of the yell leaders' activity
is drowned out by boos and this past
weekend the "Tastes Great/Less Filling"
chant was even used by the Band to
mock the yell leaders.
I hope the yell leaders don't take
Hyatt's letter or the constant harass
ment from the stands and The Band too
seriously. You probably won't catch me
spelling out C-A-R-D-I-N-A-L with you

at the USC game, but I do support your
right to do as you like.

Stanford needs new,
responsible policy
Loving absurdity, I was delighted to
learn that Diana Conklin speaks for
Stanford on drug and alcohol policy
(Daily, September 28).
Who better at a University that has
long flouted state law by serving alcohol
to minors and is now evidently preparing
to evade the new federal Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act?
For years, Stanford has permitted its
premises to be used for widely advertised
public events at which alcohol is served
not only to underage Stanford students
but also to students from surrounding
high schools. University-administered
funds support these activities.
The results are predictable. Almost
every year someone is seriously injured
in an alcohol-induced accident or nearly
suffocates in his own vomit dormitories
are set afire young girls are molested;
and the Cowell Student Health Center is
kept busy attending to the less serious
cases.
The University says grandly that
these risks must be accepted so that stu
dents may learn to be responsible for
their own behavior.
It is not students' responsibility that
is in question, however, but administra
tors'.
No one suggests that deans should
ransack dorms in search of bottles or
conduct random urine tests. But is it too
much to ask that they not encourage,
defend and engage in illegal activity?
Obeying the law is not left to the dis
cretion of individual citizens, however
superior they think themselves. It is a
bedrock duty that binds all.

Stanford Gorby film
omitted protestors
After Gorbachev's visit on June 4 last
spring, the Stanford Alumni Association
and the Stanford Instructional Televi
sion Network produced and distributed a
one-hour film commemorating the visit.
The film consists of footage of the
visit, Gorbachev's speech in its entirety
and a lot of glowing comments — from
President Kennedy, from former Secre
tary of State George Schultz and from
the film's narrator — about Gorbachev's
greatness and about the visit as a great
historical event.
The description on the back of the
film package talks about "his handshak
ing tour of the Quadrangle that thrilled
thousands of students, staff and faculty
waiting to see him" and states that "it
was a great day for him and a great day
for the University."
Because of its production by organiza
tions officially affiliated with the Univer
sity, and because of the Stanford logos
appearing on it, the film is naturally per
ceived by those who watch it as repre
senting Stanford University, and so the
film creates the impression that admira
tion for Gorbachev, and a view of his
visit as "a great day for the University,"
are the universal, unquestioned position
of the Stanford community.
In fact, during Gorbachev's visit,
many students were not thrilled at all.
Hundreds of protesters were waiting
for Gorbachev when he arrived, repre
senting several independent groups.
Most of the protesters came from off
campus, but many others were Stanford
students.
The protests were reported by The
Stanford Daily, the local newspapers and
the TV news broadcasts. I was active in
one of the protests, which included both
students and off-campus people who
believed it was wrong for Stanford Uni
versity to welcome the leader of a totali
tarian country.
I think the protests were an impor-

tant aspect of the visit and of the Stan
ford community's reaction to the visit.
This aspect is almost completely ignored
by the Alumni Association film.
In the footage of the limousines driv
ing into campus, some protest signs are
seen in the background but Eire too far
away to be seen clearly.
There is also a segment of about 10
seconds in which the camera goes over
some protest signs, never staying on any
one sign long enough to allow reading it,
and without any words spoken by the
narrator.
In the narration and the interviews
throughout the film, among all the state
ments about how thrilled everyone was
by the visit, the protests are never men
tioned, not even in one sentence.
The film was made without any
attempt to gather information from
Stanford students or to find out what
people thought about its appropriate
ness.
When I expressed my objections to the
Alumni Association, I was told that the
issue is over, that the film was already
made and distributed and nothing can be
done about it at this stage.
I believe that the University should
publicly review the appropriateness of
the film, and of the way it was produced
and publicized, and decide whether some
action should be taken now to correct it.

Yell leader abuse
harsh, not tolerant
I read David Hyatt's letter in Mon
day's Daily and didn't know if I should
laugh or cry.
In its most basic form, Hyatt's letter
tells the Stanford yell leaders they are
worthless and should consider a new
hobby.
Apparently Hyatt hasn't taken too •
much away from his Stanford experi-

ence. (On reflection, though, this may
explain his "senior undeclared" status.)
What happened to diversity? What
happened to live and let live? What hap
pened to just minding your own
business? Aren't these the fundamental
principles of Stanford? Isn't this the
package mom and dad think they are
paying for?
In some respects, I might be like
Hyatt. I find my cheering to be more
effective using an individual, stream-of
consciousness approach rather than
working within the constraints of the
structured cheering.
And I am clearly not elevated to a
higher plane of cheering by the yell lead
ers' constant exhortations. While I
