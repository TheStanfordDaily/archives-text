# Near West Campus faces five-year delay
## Funding for project reduced by $80 million 
### Howard Libit 
Completion of the Near West Campus
will be delayed for five years due to an $80
million budget cut, according to Assoc.
Provost John Hughes.
Funding for the project has been reduced
from $250 million to $170 million, said
Curt Williams, director of facilities project
management.
"It is our intention over time to complete
the (Near West) master plan," Williams
said. "It will be finished over a longer
period of time."
The Near West plan is designed to refur
bish many old and obsolete science build
ings as well as construct new ones.
The project was due to be completed
between the years 2000 and 2005, but
Hughes estimates that the project will be
set back five to 10 years.
There are three reasons for the reduced
funding of Near West:
• Some funds for the project have been
diverted to earthquake restoration funding.
• Budget constraints prohibit Stanford
from borrowing all of the money necessary
for the project.
• Donations for the project have been less
than projected.
Future changes in these three areas may

change the project's timetable.
Near West is expected to relieve the lack
of space problems in the science depart
ment.
"Stanford has already outgrown its cur
rent facilities," said Phil Williams, director
of planning. "The squeeze will be felt worse
in the future."
Williams also assessed the impact that
the funding delays will have on competition
for research grants.
"It will hurt in that the physical facilities
are inadequate," said Williams. "It will help
because money was not spent on these
buildings, which will lower the indirect
costs. This allows Stanford to be more com
petitive in terms of cost-recovery rate."
Hughes agreed with this assessment of
the research situation.
Indirect costs are extra expenses charged
on research grants to cover maintenance of
facilities and other costs. Stanford cur
rently has one of the highest indirect cost
rates in the country at 74 percent and is
being investigated by two different federal
offices for alleged improprieties.
Many of Near West's buildings will be
built according to the previous time sched
ule, such as Keck Science Building (already
completed), Gilbert Biological Sci
ences Building (due to be com
pleted this spring) and Green
Earth Sciences Building. The
Stauffer Buildings and Varian
Physics Labs will also be refur
bished on time.
However, the Advanced Mate
rials Resources Building will be
half of its original size and the
40,000 square-foot addition to the
Center for Integrated Systems
may or may not be built, accord
ing to Curt Williams.
Several old one-story science
buildings will also remain for a
period of time until new, high
density structures can be built.
Overall, this delay is not
expected to drastically hurt Near
West.
Williams said, "We still gain a
fair amount of space. We will be
better off than we are now by a
longshot."
