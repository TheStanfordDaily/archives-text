## Teaching needs student input 
### 
WELL, NOW I KNOW WHY Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy is only the sixth-highest
paid person on the University payroll.
Last spring, the Prez said that he
would take steps to reinvigorate Stan
ford's emphasis on teaching. This fall, in
a letter in last Wednesday's Daily, ("Uni
versity must respect faculty's hiring deci
sions") he basically says he cannot
involve himself in decisions about ...
teaching.
With clout like that, it's a wonder they
don't pay him less.
To be fair, Kennedy deserves applause
for recognizing the oftentimes unbeliev
ably uninformative and uninspiring char
acter of the teaching here.
Personally, out of the 200-plus units
I've accumulated here, maybe a quarter
of those were from classes where the
instruction actually warranted the
approximately $250 per unit (yes,
$250/ unit - think about that the next time
you sleep through your nine o'clock) cost
of this place.
And, funny thing, half of those were
classes taught by a lecturer, not a tenured
or tenure-bound professor.
As Stanford keeps jacking tuition up
past the absurdity threshold, such defi
ciencies with teaching become less of an
irritation and more of an outright fraud.
I'm not sure if Kennedy sees it in quite
that way, but, heck, at least he sees that
the problem exists. His insight into solv
ing the problem, however, doesn't go deep
enough.
"1... believe in the improvement of
undergraduate education at Stanford,"

he writes in the letter, "but it can't be
done by administrative intervention out
side the rules."
So, hmmm, maybe it can be done with
a few hard prayers and a word or two
from Bob Geldof? Or a letter from every
body's mothers? Hello?
The facts are that the faculty seems
quite happy with its decisions — and the
students aren't. We have a standofT here.
And an administration which takes the
approach of 'we can't intervene' won't be
of much help to anybody.
A suggestion: Instead of looking at the
current system of peer review as set in
stone, maybe it can be modified in some
way.
The attitude of 'this is the way it's
always been done' works fine, as long as
nothing's wrong. But that's not the case
with quality of teaching at Stanford, so
that sort of attitude makes about as much
sense as, say, replanting all the palm trees
on Palm Drive (they look great, but every
body's too busy avoiding potholes to
bother noticing).
In promising a new level of teaching,
Kennedy sounded good, but if he can't do
anything to bring it about, why bother
with the lofty speeches?
And, really, why should the idea of stu
dent input playing a greater role in fac
ulty decisions sound so appalling? After
all, the reason the professors and lectur
ers are here is because we are here, and,
basically, we pay their salaries.
If they're more concerned about their
needs than ours, then, wake up, we're
getting ripped off.
Certainly the historical reasons for fac

ulty autonomy — to insulate professors
from political reactions to their teachings,
as well as from the actions of students
peeved by a bad grade or two — are valid
concerns, and I'm not proposing that
every tenure decision or every firing
require a vote from every student that
had ever come into contact with the per
son.
But the inadequacy of the present sys
tem in effectively recognizing and incor
porating student opinion needs fixing
(and no, those end-quarter evaluations,
which faculty point to when we complain
about lack of input, don't count — as far
as I can tell, they end up as squirrel vit
tles).
Kennedy's speech last spring gave the
impression that just such a fixin' was in
the works, but that impression was mis
leading.
If the promises of last spring carry any
merit, we should be hearing something
more akin to "Well, given the present sys
tem, I can't have any influence, but, given
the severity of the problem, I'll see what I
can do to alter the system."
And then, maybe, having exerted him
self to such a large degree, I'd start feel
ing sorry for Kennedy again, since he's
the sixth man down the chow-line and all.

ford's emphasis on teaching. This fall, in
a letter in last Wednesday's Daily, ("Uni
versity must respect faculty's hiring deci
sions") he basically says he cannot
involve himself in decisions about ...
teaching.
With clout like that, it's a wonder they
don't pay him less.
To be fair, Kennedy deserves applause
for recognizing the oftentimes unbeliev
ably uninformative and uninspiring char
acter of the teaching here.
Personally, out of the 200-plus units
I've accumulated here, maybe a quarter
of those were from classes where the
instruction actually warranted the
approximately $250 per unit (yes,
$250/ unit - think about that the next time
you sleep through your nine o'clock) cost
of this place.
And, funny thing, half of those were
classes taught by a lecturer, not a tenured
or tenure-bound professor.
As Stanford keeps jacking tuition up
past the absurdity threshold, such defi
ciencies with teaching become less of an
irritation and more of an outright fraud.
I'm not sure if Kennedy sees it in quite
that way, but, heck, at least he sees that
the problem exists. His insight into solv
ing the problem, however, doesn't go deep
enough.
"1... believe in the improvement of
undergraduate education at Stanford,"

he writes in the letter, "but it can't be
done by administrative intervention out
side the rules."
So, hmmm, maybe it can be done with
a few hard prayers and a word or two
from Bob Geldof? Or a letter from every
body's mothers? Hello?
The facts are that the faculty seems
quite happy with its decisions — and the
students aren't. We have a standofT here.
And an administration which takes the
approach of 'we can't intervene' won't be
of much help to anybody.
A suggestion: Instead of looking at the
current system of peer review as set in
stone, maybe it can be modified in some
way.
The attitude of 'this is the way it's
always been done' works fine, as long as
nothing's wrong. But that's not the case
with quality of teaching at Stanford, so
that sort of attitude makes about as much
sense as, say, replanting all the palm trees
on Palm Drive (they look great, but every
body's too busy avoiding potholes to
bother noticing).
In promising a new level of teaching,
Kennedy sounded good, but if he can't do
anything to bring it about, why bother
with the lofty speeches?
And, really, why should the idea of stu
dent input playing a greater role in fac
ulty decisions sound so appalling? After
all, the reason the professors and lectur
ers are here is because we are here, and,
basically, we pay their salaries.
If they're more concerned about their
needs than ours, then, wake up, we're
getting ripped off.
Certainly the historical reasons for fac

ulty autonomy — to insulate professors
from political reactions to their teachings,
as well as from the actions of students
peeved by a bad grade or two — are valid
concerns, and I'm not proposing that
every tenure decision or every firing
require a vote from every student that
had ever come into contact with the per
son.
But the inadequacy of the present sys
tem in effectively recognizing and incor
porating student opinion needs fixing
(and no, those end-quarter evaluations,
which faculty point to when we complain
about lack of input, don't count — as far
as I can tell, they end up as squirrel vit
tles).
Kennedy's speech last spring gave the
impression that just such a fixin' was in
the works, but that impression was mis
leading.
If the promises of last spring carry any
merit, we should be hearing something
more akin to "Well, given the present sys
tem, I can't have any influence, but, given
the severity of the problem, I'll see what I
can do to alter the system."
And then, maybe, having exerted him
self to such a large degree, I'd start feel
ing sorry for Kennedy again, since he's
the sixth man down the chow-line and all.
