Stanford English Prof. William Di
Piero has released a new book, "The
Dog Star." Di Piero, an Italian-Ameri
can poet, has a style similar to the Ital
ian authors whom Di Piero has trans
lated, including Giacamo Leopardi,
Sandro Penna, and Leonardo Sinis
galli.
It is Di Piero's background as a
native of Philadelphia with Italian
ancestors that creates his distinctive
voice.
In his earlier work, "The Only Dan
gerous Thing," he contemplates times
of departure and transition. In a poem
from this early volume, "The Station,"
Di Piero seems at an awkward moment
alone in a European train station.
In his new book, Di Piero mentions
"dogstar time" at the conclusion of
"Summer Returns." In "Sabbioneta
To Parma," a poem which also
appeared in"The First Hour" (1982),
Di Piero touches a few of the Old World
traditions he described in an essay
from a recently released collection,
"Memory and Enthusiasm."
He states at the at the conclusion of
this poem:
It also fixed me in the middle range,
Homeless, off balance, listening
To odd faint songs above my head.
Di Piero initially began working as a
translator to teach himself Italian and
to earn money, but he definitely
remains an American author.
Citing Walt Whitman, often consid
ered to be the most original and finest
of American poets, as an influence, Di
Piero firmly places himself within an
American context.
Di Piero's earlier work was con
cerned with the migration of his ances
tors, which, in his view, exemplifies the
definitive American experience.
While both Di Piero and Whitman
seek the transcendental in the uni
verse by using the elements of nature
for a stage, Di Piero uses a completely
different method from his predecessor.
Di Piero considers Emily Dickin
son's unique use of language relevant
to a consideration of his own work.
Our modern day successor to Whitman
is William Carlos Williams.
Both Di Piero and Williams boast of
a diverse heritage, both having Euro
pean and American backgrounds.
Williams, a medical doctor, held a dif
ferent temperment than Whitman, the
Civil War nurse. Di Piero celebrates
Whitman's work in his new book in
"Walt, The Wounded," also a reprint
from an earlier collection.
Di Piero's work has a distinct flavor

which is compellingly personal and
controlled. In form, the work seems
closer to Dickinson and early twenti
eth-century American poet Hart
Crane. On occasion he makes use of
the odd word as does Crane; or the
clever twist that Dickinson employed
in her verse.
Here we begin to witness the classi
cal quality of Di Piero's verse. While he
lacks the theatricality of opera in his
poems, there is a delicate music that
Dickinson, Whitman and Crane would
no doubt all appreciate.
Di Piero mentions Greek play
wright Euripides as an author who
interested him, and Dante, for his
"religious" quality. These classical
authors seem to have affected Di
Piero's style. His work remains under
stated.
Other religious poets Di Piero
recently mentioned were seventeenth
and nineteenth century poets George
Herbert and Gerard Manley Hopkins.

Di Piero's simplicity of
line and language seems
to take on in the back
ground that vast disarray
we see in the world
around us.

guage to form a unique vision in chal
lenging verse that we come to marvel
at.
One of the Modern Italian writers
Di Piero considered in his book of
essays "Memories" is Cesare Pavese.
Di Piero, who once lived in Italy for
several years, noted the influence of
ancient Greek author Hesiod in
Pavese's work. Like Pavese, Di Piero is
fascinated by Whitman.
Di Piero respects the natural forces
we find presented in a religious context
in both Hesiod and Whitman. Pavese

also held a first hand appreciation of
the "peasant culture" and rugged ter
rain of the mountainous Abruzzo
region in Italy, a place of his forebears
that Di Piero has visited.
To the uninitiated, Dante's "Divine
Comedy" appears daunting, similar to
a Renaissance cathedral in style and
size. Yet Di Piero finds a certain "ten
sion" within the work that reveals the
"seeking after that which is not of this
world" that he associates with the reli
gious impulse.
Indeed, there is quite a bit of ten
sion in Di Piero's poetry. It is a tension
necessitated by his contemplation of
the more difficult moments of life.
As did Williams, Di Piero explores
the complexities of a relationship in
his poem "The Apricot Trees". The
language is sensual as it describes this
orchard ripe with "the gold succulence
of summer". The poem is firmly
grounded in the California landscape.
In "Acacia In Bloom" the author casts
his eye towards the awkward moment
of a lover's quarrel.
Along my familiar path where spring
Would later work up orange poppies
And wild lilies, I plunged my hand
Into gray green loads and grabbed
One branch's nodding yellow charge
Prior to this stanza, the poem uti
lizes the dash to include an abrupt
shift, as did Dickinson in her verse.
These spaces remind us that what is
being said is as important as what is
not, and at difficult times, many
thoughts are best left unarticulated.
Di Piero mentions Carlos Williams'
"Spring and All" and "Asphodel, That
Greeny Flower" as poems he recently
considers with favour. The latter is a
long late love poem to Florence,
Williams' wife.
One comes to marvel at Di Piero's
simplicity of line and language. There
is a particular economy and cleanli
ness, especially in his latest work.
What makes this cleanliness won
derful is that it seems to take on or
hold in the background that vast disar
ray we see in the world around us.
In"The Divine", a short rhymed
lyric that lacks some of the internal
chorus we usually associate with his
verse, we see that hard work may lead
one to hear a delicate natural aria.
The night's sea's broken forms,
Its long torn hush,
Erase every recent trace
Like wind to dust
••• )I . 1 J A
My voice going out has nothing
New to say, no slight
Shock of self to lend
A world hammered soft tonight.

grounded in the California landscape.
In "Acacia In Bloom" the author casts
his eye towards the awkward moment
of a lover's quarrel.
Along my familiar path where spring
Would later work up orange poppies
And wild lilies, I plunged my hand
Into gray green loads and grabbed
One branch's nodding yellow charge
Prior to this stanza, the poem uti
lizes the dash to include an abrupt
shift, as did Dickinson in her verse.
These spaces remind us that what is
being said is as important as what is
not, and at difficult times, many
thoughts are best left unarticulated.
Di Piero mentions Carlos Williams'
"Spring and All" and "Asphodel, That
Greeny Flower" as poems he recently
considers with favour. The latter is a
long late love poem to Florence,
Williams' wife.
One comes to marvel at Di Piero's
simplicity of line and language. There
is a particular economy and cleanli
ness, especially in his latest work.
What makes this cleanliness won
derful is that it seems to take on or
hold in the background that vast disar
ray we see in the world around us.
In"The Divine", a short rhymed
lyric that lacks some of the internal
chorus we usually associate with his
verse, we see that hard work may lead
one to hear a delicate natural aria.

Its long torn hush,

The Dog Star

Stanford English Prof. William Di
Piero has released a new book, "The
Dog Star." Di Piero, an Italian-Ameri
can poet, has a style similar to the Ital
ian authors whom Di Piero has trans
lated, including Giacamo Leopardi,
Sandro Penna, and Leonardo Sinis
galli.
It is Di Piero's background as a
native of Philadelphia with Italian
ancestors that creates his distinctive
voice.
In his earlier work, "The Only Dan
gerous Thing," he contemplates times
of departure and transition. In a poem
from this early volume, "The Station,"
Di Piero seems at an awkward moment
alone in a European train station.
In his new book, Di Piero mentions
"dogstar time" at the conclusion of
"Summer Returns." In "Sabbioneta
To Parma," a poem which also
appeared in"The First Hour" (1982),
Di Piero touches a few of the Old World
traditions he described in an essay
from a recently released collection,
"Memory and Enthusiasm."
He states at the at the conclusion of
this poem:
It also fixed me in the middle range,
Homeless, off balance, listening
To odd faint songs above my head.
Di Piero initially began working as a
translator to teach himself Italian and
to earn money, but he definitely
remains an American author.
Citing Walt Whitman, often consid
ered to be the most original and finest
of American poets, as an influence, Di
Piero firmly places himself within an
American context.
Di Piero's earlier work was con
cerned with the migration of his ances
tors, which, in his view, exemplifies the
definitive American experience.
While both Di Piero and Whitman
seek the transcendental in the uni
verse by using the elements of nature
for a stage, Di Piero uses a completely
different method from his predecessor.
Di Piero considers Emily Dickin
son's unique use of language relevant
to a consideration of his own work.
Our modern day successor to Whitman
is William Carlos Williams.
Both Di Piero and Williams boast of
a diverse heritage, both having Euro
pean and American backgrounds.
Williams, a medical doctor, held a dif
ferent temperment than Whitman, the
Civil War nurse. Di Piero celebrates
Whitman's work in his new book in
"Walt, The Wounded," also a reprint
from an earlier collection.
Di Piero's work has a distinct flavor

which is compellingly personal and
controlled. In form, the work seems
closer to Dickinson and early twenti
eth-century American poet Hart
Crane. On occasion he makes use of
the odd word as does Crane; or the
clever twist that Dickinson employed
in her verse.
Here we begin to witness the classi
cal quality of Di Piero's verse. While he
lacks the theatricality of opera in his
poems, there is a delicate music that
Dickinson, Whitman and Crane would
no doubt all appreciate.
Di Piero mentions Greek play
wright Euripides as an author who
interested him, and Dante, for his
"religious" quality. These classical
authors seem to have affected Di
Piero's style. His work remains under
stated.
Other religious poets Di Piero
recently mentioned were seventeenth
and nineteenth century poets George
Herbert and Gerard Manley Hopkins.

guage to form a unique vision in chal
lenging verse that we come to marvel
at.
One of the Modern Italian writers
Di Piero considered in his book of
essays "Memories" is Cesare Pavese.
Di Piero, who once lived in Italy for
several years, noted the influence of
ancient Greek author Hesiod in
Pavese's work. Like Pavese, Di Piero is
fascinated by Whitman.
Di Piero respects the natural forces
we find presented in a religious context
in both Hesiod and Whitman. Pavese

also held a first hand appreciation of
the "peasant culture" and rugged ter
rain of the mountainous Abruzzo
region in Italy, a place of his forebears
that Di Piero has visited.
To the uninitiated, Dante's "Divine
Comedy" appears daunting, similar to
a Renaissance cathedral in style and
size. Yet Di Piero finds a certain "ten
sion" within the work that reveals the
"seeking after that which is not of this
world" that he associates with the reli
gious impulse.
Indeed, there is quite a bit of ten
sion in Di Piero's poetry. It is a tension
necessitated by his contemplation of
the more difficult moments of life.
As did Williams, Di Piero explores
the complexities of a relationship in
his poem "The Apricot Trees". The
language is sensual as it describes this
orchard ripe with "the gold succulence
of summer". The poem is firmly
grounded in the California landscape.
In "Acacia In Bloom" the author casts
his eye towards the awkward moment
of a lover's quarrel.
