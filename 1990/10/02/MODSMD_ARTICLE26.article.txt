Reviews by Rohan Sippy
First Hubby
by Roy Blount Jr.
Villard, $18.95, 286 pages
Roy Blount's newest book takes the form of a
diary authored by former journalist Guy Fox. The
writings are set in mid-1993, as he records the
progress of his wife Clementine as the first woman
president of the United States.
The book combines past and present skilfully in
this view of the future. Blount flashes back to the
1960s and traces their romantic and political
progress over two eventful decades, sprinkling the
anecdotes with his characteristic wit.
The reminisces are integrated with the "present"
situation in 1993, where Fox has to contend with his
sudden responsibilities as a dignitary, and the large
group of staff that comes along with them. He also
has to resolve for himself that he is the man married
to the president of the United States.
The book is funny as it carves a possible future
out of a series of weird fates that both Bush and
Quayle suffer.
But it also comes across as something more than
that by revealing the absolutely fascinating charac
ter of Clementine Fox. Blount's characterization of
the President and her involvement with Guy and the
rest of the world as enticing as it is believable.
Blount is adept at tracing out the lives of the
Foxs' as they encounter domestic problems and
international crises, both with equal humour and
humanity.
Dirty Work
by Larry Brown
Vintage, $9.95, 236 pages
The paperback edition of "Dirty Work" has now
been released.
It is the story of two Mississippi men, Braiden
Chaney and Walter James, who are black and white
respectively. Author Larry Brown writes the chap
ters alternately from Chaney's and James' perspec
tive.
Both men are horrible physical and psychological
victims of the war in Vietnam, now together in a hos
pital 22 years later, where the faceless James hap
pens to be placed in a bed right by that of the limb
less Chaney.
Brown juxtaposes the two contrasting styles to
form an unforgettable picture. The two characters
express their wishes and memories to each other,
revealing their inner selves to each other through
the course of the night.
Chaney is limbless and almost comes across as a
caricature of a black man, but Brown, a native of
Faulkner's Oxford, Mississippi, manages to avoid
that by dealing with his feelings directly.
In this, his first novel, Brown has succeeded in
producing a work that is yet another reminder of the
havoc that war wreaks on individuals, accentuated
by the perspective of over two decades of pain.

Larry Brown is going to be in the Bay Area promot
ing the sale of his new book. He will be at Kepler's
Books and Magazines on Wednesday, Oct. 31.
