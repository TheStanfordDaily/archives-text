## Proof positive the implausible is only improbable 
### 
It's every armchair quarterback's
dream: Twenty thousand dollars to
throw a football through a 10-inch
hole from 25 yards away. "Hey, how hard
could it be?" the would-be Elways, Plun
ketts and Palumbi ask. We 11....
The deal here, set up by the Athletic
Department and sponsored by several
area businesses, is that at each home foot
ball game one semi-lucky student gets the
chance, between the first and second
quarters, to stand in front of 50,000
some-odd people and prove that he or she
can't throw a football through that little
hole.
You get three chances: Make it on the
first and you win $20,000 applied towards
tuition and room and board. If you miss
and then make the second attempt,
$10,000 is yours. The third gets you
$5,000. Three misses? Sorry. I don't even
think you get to keep the football.
So how hard is it? Let's just say you'd
probably have better luck pulling a bowl
ing ball through your left nostril, 'cuz the
hole is mighty small. Someone might be
able to do it, though, because last Satur
day's contestant almost put it through on
his third try. (Unfortunately, it was one of
the few highlights of the game.) Let's just
say I won't be betting a lot of money on it
ever happening.
The volleyball student contest, how
ever, actually has a chance of seeing a
winner sometime this season. At every
home match, between the second and
third games, a student gets three chances
to serve the ball through a hole at the
other end of the court, 18 meters away.
The hole is a little larger — you can
almost fit two volleyballs through at the

same time — and the prize money is
smaller: $10,000, $5,000 and $2,500, bo it
must be a bit easier, right?
I sure didn't think so the first time I
checked out a game. If you haven't been
to a volleyball match yet this season —
well, Why the hell not? — oops, I mean
you probably should sometime soon, if
only to see the server du jour. Eighteen
meters is quite the long way, especially
considering that serving a volleyball isn't
the easiest thing for most of us to do. In
fact, I — along with most everyone I
talked to — figured it was just about
impossible. Figuring wasn't good enough,
however.
I had to know.
And so, in the interests of science, to
satisfy my curiosity and because I
really had nothing better to do, a
friend and I headed for Maples Pavilion
one night after dinner last week to find
out if it could be done. (If you must know,
it was early Friday night. So I have no
social life. Sue me.)
There are several reasons I tried the
volleyball contest instead of the football
toss: First, I couldn't throw a spiral if my
life depended on it. Second, I can't throw

a football that far. Third, if I tried to
throw the ball that far more than two or
three times I'd probably rip all (okay,
both) the muscles in my arm. Needless to
say, I like my arms to be functional — it's
easier to eat that way — so the football
toss was definitely out.
Once inside Mapleo — thanks to Lori
in marketing and Pat in equipment for
putting up with this crazy idea and letting
us in — the two of us set up the board
that contains the hole at the end of one of
the intramural courts, went to find a net
... and found out the storeroom was
locked. Problem No. 1. Okay, we rea
soned, the net's a little over seven feet
high, and the hole in the board is about
four feet off the ground. Given that my
general arm strength is right up there
with, say, Pee Wee Herman's, would there
be any way I could hit the ball hard
enough so that a serve would stay lower
than seven feet and on target the length
of the court?
Not a chance. We'd just deal with no
net.
Then we took a few practice serves,
and found out that two of the four volley
balls we'd brought were just flat enough
to make it next to impossible to serve
them that far. Problem No. 2. Only two
balls meant fewer serves, which could
have screwed up the plan: To serve until I
made it through the hole, until three
hours were up or until my arm fell off,
whichever came first.
Of course, there was a lot riding on
this: One friend had bet me 10 bucks I
couldn't do it in less than two hours.
Another bet me $10 (at 10-to-l odds!!!!)
that I couldn't do it in less than an hour.

Hey, who was I to turn down a chance to
do something stupid for a little money?
At 7:20 p.m., we started. Pad, pen and
clock were with me at one end of the
court. The hole and Chris, the designated
shagger, were at the other end. I took the
ceremonial first serve. OfT to the right
and short by about 10 feet. Expletive No.
1.
7:20.20: Serve No. 3 hits the board 18
inches directly to the right of the hole.
Hmmmm. Serve No. 4 hits another two
inches to the right. Maybe this isn't going
to be so tough, I think.
Famous last words. The next 13 serves
go every which way except toward the
hole.
7:24.15: No. 18 hits six inches too
high. Expletive No. 2.
7:27.30: No. 30 is four inches to the
right. Closer.
7:33.00: No. 52 misses the edge of the
hole by two inches. My arm isn't very
happy with me.
The next 18 serves go nowhere, and I
take a break to pull my arm back into its
socket. Chris takes 50 shots at the hole
and basically has about as much luck as I
had. At 7:48, I start up again. . .. and
almost completely miss the ball. Expletive
No. 253.
Three minutes later and I haven't even
hit the board in about a week. The serves
look like rainbows, plopping all over the
place. Chris starts to get annoyed. "Dude,
hit the board," he says.
"I'm in a huge drought," I say.
"Comin' up on 30 misses." Serve No. 83
quacks for about 40 feet and then dies.
"You have to warm up again," he says.
"Right," I answer as I toss the ball in

the air. Smack! The ball screams toward
the board.
"There you go!" The ball curves down,
moves a little to the left, looks like it may
actually hit something . . . and hits the
inner edge of the hole and bounces
through.
I jump in the air, give a world-class
scream and collapse on the floor. Chris
stands looking at the hole, not really
believing what's happened.
After a few seconds I sit up, pick my
arm up off the floor and write down the
time. Seven-fifty-two. Serve No. 84. Chris
keeps trying until he's served 84 times,
but no dice. No. 80 hits the edge and
bounces away. We write what's happened
on the back of the board and take off.
Of course, there was still the small
matter of payment. Let's see: 10
grand for the first serve, 5,000 for
the second, 2,500 for the third and so on.
That works out to a prize of 10,000/2 n "
dollars, with n being the number of serves
it takes. (Not bad for an AmStud major,
huh?)
According to that formula, then, putting
it through on the 84th try is good for a
prize of 0.0000000000000000001034, or
1.034 X 10 19 , cents.
Somebody better pay up.

7:24.15: No. 18 hits six inches too
high. Expletive No. 2.
7:27.30: No. 30 is four inches to the
right. Closer.
7:33.00: No. 52 misses the edge of the
hole by two inches. My arm isn't very
happy with me.
The next 18 serves go nowhere, and I
take a break to pull my arm back into its
socket. Chris takes 50 shots at the hole
and basically has about as much luck as I
had. At 7:48, I start up again. . .. and
almost completely miss the ball. Expletive
No. 253.
Three minutes later and I haven't even
hit the board in about a week. The serves
look like rainbows, plopping all over the
place. Chris starts to get annoyed. "Dude,
hit the board," he says.
"I'm in a huge drought," I say.
"Comin' up on 30 misses." Serve No. 83
quacks for about 40 feet and then dies.
"You have to warm up again," he says.
"Right," I answer as I toss the ball in

the air. Smack! The ball screams toward
the board.
"There you go!" The ball curves down,
moves a little to the left, looks like it may
actually hit something . . . and hits the
inner edge of the hole and bounces
through.
I jump in the air, give a world-class
scream and collapse on the floor. Chris
stands looking at the hole, not really
believing what's happened.
After a few seconds I sit up, pick my
arm up off the floor and write down the
time. Seven-fifty-two. Serve No. 84. Chris
keeps trying until he's served 84 times,
but no dice. No. 80 hits the edge and
bounces away. We write what's happened
on the back of the board and take off.
Of course, there was still the small
matter of payment. Let's see: 10
grand for the first serve, 5,000 for
the second, 2,500 for the third and so on.
That works out to a prize of 10,000/2 n "
dollars, with n being the number of serves
it takes. (Not bad for an AmStud major,
huh?)
According to that formula, then, putting
it through on the 84th try is good for a
prize of 0.0000000000000000001034, or
1.034 X 10 19 , cents.

It's every armchair quarterback's
dream: Twenty thousand dollars to
throw a football through a 10-inch
hole from 25 yards away. "Hey, how hard
could it be?" the would-be Elways, Plun
ketts and Palumbi ask. We 11....
The deal here, set up by the Athletic
Department and sponsored by several
area businesses, is that at each home foot
ball game one semi-lucky student gets the
chance, between the first and second
quarters, to stand in front of 50,000
some-odd people and prove that he or she
can't throw a football through that little
hole.
You get three chances: Make it on the
first and you win $20,000 applied towards
tuition and room and board. If you miss
and then make the second attempt,
$10,000 is yours. The third gets you
$5,000. Three misses? Sorry. I don't even
think you get to keep the football.
So how hard is it? Let's just say you'd
probably have better luck pulling a bowl
ing ball through your left nostril, 'cuz the
hole is mighty small. Someone might be
able to do it, though, because last Satur
day's contestant almost put it through on
his third try. (Unfortunately, it was one of
the few highlights of the game.) Let's just
say I won't be betting a lot of money on it
ever happening.
The volleyball student contest, how
ever, actually has a chance of seeing a
winner sometime this season. At every
home match, between the second and
third games, a student gets three chances
to serve the ball through a hole at the
other end of the court, 18 meters away.
The hole is a little larger — you can
almost fit two volleyballs through at the

same time — and the prize money is
smaller: $10,000, $5,000 and $2,500, bo it
must be a bit easier, right?
I sure didn't think so the first time I
checked out a game. If you haven't been
to a volleyball match yet this season —
well, Why the hell not? — oops, I mean
you probably should sometime soon, if
only to see the server du jour. Eighteen
meters is quite the long way, especially
considering that serving a volleyball isn't
the easiest thing for most of us to do. In
fact, I — along with most everyone I
talked to — figured it was just about
impossible. Figuring wasn't good enough,
however.
I had to know.
And so, in the interests of science, to
satisfy my curiosity and because I
really had nothing better to do, a
friend and I headed for Maples Pavilion
one night after dinner last week to find
out if it could be done. (If you must know,
it was early Friday night. So I have no
social life. Sue me.)
There are several reasons I tried the
volleyball contest instead of the football
toss: First, I couldn't throw a spiral if my
life depended on it. Second, I can't throw

a football that far. Third, if I tried to
throw the ball that far more than two or
three times I'd probably rip all (okay,
both) the muscles in my arm. Needless to
say, I like my arms to be functional — it's
easier to eat that way — so the football
toss was definitely out.
Once inside Mapleo — thanks to Lori
in marketing and Pat in equipment for
putting up with this crazy idea and letting
us in — the two of us set up the board
that contains the hole at the end of one of
the intramural courts, went to find a net
... and found out the storeroom was
locked. Problem No. 1. Okay, we rea
soned, the net's a little over seven feet
high, and the hole in the board is about
four feet off the ground. Given that my
general arm strength is right up there
with, say, Pee Wee Herman's, would there
be any way I could hit the ball hard
enough so that a serve would stay lower
than seven feet and on target the length
of the court?
Not a chance. We'd just deal with no
net.
Then we took a few practice serves,
and found out that two of the four volley
balls we'd brought were just flat enough
to make it next to impossible to serve
them that far. Problem No. 2. Only two
balls meant fewer serves, which could
have screwed up the plan: To serve until I
made it through the hole, until three
hours were up or until my arm fell off,
whichever came first.
Of course, there was a lot riding on
this: One friend had bet me 10 bucks I
couldn't do it in less than two hours.
Another bet me $10 (at 10-to-l odds!!!!)
that I couldn't do it in less than an hour.

Hey, who was I to turn down a chance to
do something stupid for a little money?
At 7:20 p.m., we started. Pad, pen and
clock were with me at one end of the
court. The hole and Chris, the designated
shagger, were at the other end. I took the
ceremonial first serve. OfT to the right
and short by about 10 feet. Expletive No.
1.
7:20.20: Serve No. 3 hits the board 18
inches directly to the right of the hole.
Hmmmm. Serve No. 4 hits another two
inches to the right. Maybe this isn't going
to be so tough, I think.
Famous last words. The next 13 serves
go every which way except toward the
hole.
7:24.15: No. 18 hits six inches too
high. Expletive No. 2.
7:27.30: No. 30 is four inches to the

one night after dinner last week to find
out if it could be done. (If you must know,
it was early Friday night. So I have no
social life. Sue me.)
There are several reasons I tried the
volleyball contest instead of the football
toss: First, I couldn't throw a spiral if my
life depended on it. Second, I can't throw

a football that far. Third, if I tried to
throw the ball that far more than two or
three times I'd probably rip all (okay,
both) the muscles in my arm. Needless to
say, I like my arms to be functional — it's
easier to eat that way — so the football
toss was definitely out.
Once inside Mapleo — thanks to Lori
in marketing and Pat in equipment for
putting up with this crazy idea and letting
us in — the two of us set up the board
that contains the hole at the end of one of
the intramural courts, went to find a net
... and found out the storeroom was
locked. Problem No. 1. Okay, we rea
soned, the net's a little over seven feet
high, and the hole in the board is about
four feet off the ground. Given that my
general arm strength is right up there
with, say, Pee Wee Herman's, would there
be any way I could hit the ball hard
enough so that a serve would stay lower
than seven feet and on target the length
of the court?
Not a chance. We'd just deal with no
net.
Then we took a few practice serves,
and found out that two of the four volley
balls we'd brought were just flat enough
to make it next to impossible to serve
them that far. Problem No. 2. Only two
balls meant fewer serves, which could
have screwed up the plan: To serve until I
made it through the hole, until three
hours were up or until my arm fell off,
whichever came first.
Of course, there was a lot riding on
this: One friend had bet me 10 bucks I
couldn't do it in less than two hours.
Another bet me $10 (at 10-to-l odds!!!!)
that I couldn't do it in less than an hour.

Hey, who was I to turn down a chance to
do something stupid for a little money?
At 7:20 p.m., we started. Pad, pen and
clock were with me at one end of the
court. The hole and Chris, the designated
shagger, were at the other end. I took the
ceremonial first serve. OfT to the right
and short by about 10 feet. Expletive No.
1.
7:20.20: Serve No. 3 hits the board 18
inches directly to the right of the hole.
Hmmmm. Serve No. 4 hits another two
inches to the right. Maybe this isn't going
to be so tough, I think.
Famous last words. The next 13 serves
go every which way except toward the
hole.
7:24.15: No. 18 hits six inches too
high. Expletive No. 2.
7:27.30: No. 30 is four inches to the
right. Closer.
7:33.00: No. 52 misses the edge of the
hole by two inches. My arm isn't very
happy with me.
The next 18 serves go nowhere, and I
take a break to pull my arm back into its
socket. Chris takes 50 shots at the hole
and basically has about as much luck as I
had. At 7:48, I start up again. . .. and
almost completely miss the ball. Expletive
No. 253.
Three minutes later and I haven't even
hit the board in about a week. The serves
look like rainbows, plopping all over the
place. Chris starts to get annoyed. "Dude,
hit the board," he says.
"I'm in a huge drought," I say.
"Comin' up on 30 misses." Serve No. 83
quacks for about 40 feet and then dies.
"You have to warm up again," he says.
"Right," I answer as I toss the ball in

the air. Smack! The ball screams toward
the board.
"There you go!" The ball curves down,
moves a little to the left, looks like it may
actually hit something . . . and hits the
inner edge of the hole and bounces
through.
I jump in the air, give a world-class
scream and collapse on the floor. Chris
stands looking at the hole, not really
believing what's happened.
After a few seconds I sit up, pick my
arm up off the floor and write down the
time. Seven-fifty-two. Serve No. 84. Chris
keeps trying until he's served 84 times,
but no dice. No. 80 hits the edge and
bounces away. We write what's happened
on the back of the board and take off.
Of course, there was still the small
matter of payment. Let's see: 10
grand for the first serve, 5,000 for
the second, 2,500 for the third and so on.
That works out to a prize of 10,000/2 n "
dollars, with n being the number of serves
it takes. (Not bad for an AmStud major,
huh?)
According to that formula, then, putting
it through on the 84th try is good for a
prize of 0.0000000000000000001034, or
1.034 X 10 19 , cents.
Somebody better pay up.

Cameron Macky is vacationing on Cloud
9 this week because the Pirates are the NL
Easi champs for the first time since he
was in fifth grade. He wouldn 't have time
for silly stunts like this if he actually had
a life.
