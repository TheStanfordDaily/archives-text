Fan apathy, part two
I would like to add a voice to the
debate over Stanford's apathetic
sports fans begun by Howie Breinan in
the Sept. 25 Daily. I too have been
struggling for over five years as a
student and alumni to convince Stan
ford students that their silence is far
from golden, and the response has
been underwhelming. However, I
believe that Breinan's attacks are mis
placed. It's all well and good to ride the
freshmen for their lack of enthusiasm,
but they had only been on campus two
days, after all, and anyone who has
been through Freshman Orientation
knows what those two days were like.
One can hardly fault a bunch of
exhausted 18-year-olds for not
screaming themselves hoarse for a
team they had never seen before.
Instead, I would like to place the
blame for the embarrassing state of
Stanford sports support on the shoul-

I watched students bad
gered into submission at
basketball games by
surly alums.

ders which deserve the weight — the
alumni. For four years as an under
graduate I was the target of shouts of
"Sit down!" I watched students bad
gered into submission at basketball
games by surly alums who couldn't be
troubled with supporting the team.
I've seen the student section at Stan
ford Stadium shrink and migrate
because of the pathetic behavior of
love-handled clowns in Stanford
Indian sweaters. These are the hardy
souls who brave 75-degree weather so
that the hibachi can roar to life on Sat
urday afternoons, but not their enthu
siasm. Stanford athletics for these

alumni is an occasion for pregame
socials and an excuse to put "Cardinal
Club" bumper stickers on their
BMWs. The fault belongs to them and
them alone-
I've used the most honest, blunt
language I can because it's the only
way anyone will listen. I offer Stanford
alumni this challenge: Come to sport
ing events only if you are prepared to
lead the students in the cheers, only if
you're willing to stand and yell, only if
you are capable of putting 100 percent
into your support. If you are not, I'd
suggest that you stick to your tail
gaters once the game starts and leave
the tickets for those who really care if
Stanford wins or loses. Maybe then
the students won't feel intimidated
into silence and the true Stanford
sports fan will enjoy a much-needed
renaissance.
