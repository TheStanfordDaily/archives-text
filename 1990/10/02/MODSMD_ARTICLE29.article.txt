On a 2-2 count, Ventura
sliced a bloop double to shallow

left scoring McCray with the
tying run.
Kiecker managed to escape

went for a single and a double.
The 29-year-old rookie then
settled down and checked the
White Sox on three hits for the
next six innings.
The Red Sox took the lead
in the third with an unearned
