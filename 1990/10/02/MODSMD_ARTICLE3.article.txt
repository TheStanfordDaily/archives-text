# Entering home stretch, some Centennial areas lag behind

### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
The five-year Centennial fund
raising campaign, now entering
its final 18 months, has amassed
89 percent of its $1.1 billion goal.
But certain key areas continue to
lag behind, according to officials
in the Office of Development.
John Ford, vice president for
development, said the $202 mil
lion in gifts from private donors
during the 1989-90 fiscal year
brought the grand total to $978.8
million.
"The gift totals are the largest
in Stanford history," Ford said.
"The fact that the gifts came in
during a period of University bud
get cutting and reorganization
and near the end of our ... cam
paign makes the total even more
remarkable."
Richard Bennett, the cam
paign's associate director, said the

campaign is ahead of schedule and
"will pass through the goal by
graduation." That will leave seven
to eight months in which the cam
paign can focus on its specific
goals, he said.
However, Bennett said the Uni
versity will have unmet needs
even after the February 1992 con
clusion of the campaign. Those
needs will include funds for
endowed professorships in the
humanities and sciences, the Near
West campus, athletic scholar
ships and new building plans in
the Medical School, he said.
Endowed professorships are
funds set aside to create new pro
fessorial positions. The campaign
is currently 36 professorships
short of its goal of 100.
Humanities and Sciences is
lagging behind the other schools,
with only 15 professorships out of
the desired 40. The Medical

School is three short of its goal of
10.
The campaign also has a goal of
12 Centennial professorships,
whose successive holders will con
centrate on undergraduate educa
tion. So far, six Centennial profes
sorships have been created. There
are also two unallocated profes
sorships that have not been devel
oped.
Three of the schools have met
their objectives. The Business
School has attained one more
than its goal of seven professor
ships*, the Law School has met its
goal of three; and the Engineering
School has attained one more
than the projected 21 professor
ships.
John Wirth, vice provost for
academic planning and develop
ment, explained in a March inter
view that graduates of schools
other than Humanities and Sci
ences often have a more "utilitar

ian view" and are more inclined to
support schools that can offer
immediate end products.
Also behind in fund raising is
the Near West Campus, a complex
of six new science and engineering
buildings which will replace the
old wood and cinder block struc
tures behind the Physics Lecture
Hall.
Fundraising is intended to
make up $130 million of Near
West's budget, with the remaining
$60 million coming from loans
and University reserves. So far,
the campaign has raised $92 mil
lion.
Bennett noted that although
the Campaign is behind in fund
raising for Near West, the $92
million is "still far more money
that we've ever raised for build
ings."
