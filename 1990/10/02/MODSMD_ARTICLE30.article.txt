## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Women's basketball coach Tara Van-
Derveer, who last year led Stanford to a 32-
1 record and its first-ever NCAA champi
onship, was named head coach of the U.S.
World University Games team yesterday.
The selection was further recognition for
one of college basketball's most successful
coaches.
"This is really a tremendous honor,"
VanDerveer said. "It should be great com
petition, and I'm very excited about it. This
team could possibly form the nucleus for
our 1996 Olympic Team."
The World University Games, held
every four years, will take place next July
15-24 in Sheffield, England.
The post is similar to the one Van-
Derveer filled this past summer as coach of
the United States' Select Team. That team,
open to current college players and those

less than a year out of school, traveled to
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
VanDerveer is building a resume that
may lead her to the Olympic Team job in a
few years. In addition to the national cham
pionship, she has been the recipient of
three different National Coach-of-the-Year
awards, most recently the James Naismith
Award. VanDerveer also coached the East
squad at the 1986 U.S. Olympic Festival.
In five years on the Farm, VanDerveer
has turned around a program that was
going nowhere before she arrived. Her
record at Stanford is an impressive 114-38
(.750), while her 12-year mark as a head
coach is 266-89.
At the World University Games, Van-
Derveer will coach a team that she failed to
make as a college player. While at Indiana,
VanDerveer was invited to the 1972 try
outs. The three-year starter at guard was
also invited to the tryouts for the 1976
Olympic Team.
