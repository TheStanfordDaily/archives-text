BOSTON (AP) - Dennis
Johnson, a member of three NBA
championship teams, has lost his
spot on the Boston Celtics as the
team makes a push for younger
players.
The Celtics announced Monday
that Johnson will not return to
the team for the upcoming season.
Johnson, who played seven
years for the Celtics, met with
team officials over the weekend.
They decided not to renew his
contract, which expired at the end
of last season.
"This was such a difficult de
cision to make, considering the

stature of Dennis Johnson," said
coach Chris Ford. "I consider him
to be the consummate profes
sional and a fine example for pres
ent and future Boston Celtics."
With the return of Brian Shaw
after a year in Italy, first-round
draft pick Dee Brown and Reggie
Lewis, Kevin Gamble and John
Bagley, the Celtics have a young
corps of guards to rely on during
the coming season.
The 36-year-old Johnson said
in a statement that he would
pursue offers from other teams.
He said the Celtics officials
"presented this to me in the best

possible way. They were up front,
honest and professional with me,
and gave me more consideration
that I could ever imagine."
"My years in Boston have been
great ones, and I'll always remem
ber them," Johnson said.
Johnson was drafted by Seattle
in 1976 and was the MVP of the
1979 playoffs, leading the Super-
Sonics to their only champion
ship.
After four years in Seattle,
Johnson was traded to the
Phoenix Suns. He joined the Cel
tics in 1983 and helped lead the

team to championships, 1984 and
1986.
Johnson has been named to the
league's all-defensive teams more
than any other guard in NBA his
tory.
"When Dennis Johnson was
brought here to Boston, he filled
a huge void in our team. His great
defensive play and his leadership
were major reasons why we were
so successful in the 1980s," Celtics
president Red Auerbach said. "No
matter where else he has played
or will play, Dennis Johnson will
always be a Boston Celtic."
