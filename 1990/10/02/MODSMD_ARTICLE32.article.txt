# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
After nearly a week of shopping around
for classes and scoping out the party scenes,
life on the Farm appears to be in full swing.
The Cardinal athletic program is also in
full swing once again, as a pair of Stanford
athletes turned in performances nothing
short of stellar. The California duo of Rick
McNair and Bev Oden rose to great
heights in the past week and have justly

been selected The Daily's Athletes of the
Week.
Oden, a 6-foot-2 sophomore hitter from
Irvine, Calif., has led the No. 6 Cardinal vol
leyball team to 8-2 record overall and a 5-1
record in Pacific 10 Conference play.
Last Tuesday, on the heels of a disheart
ening defeat to No. 1 UCLA, Oden revived
the Cardinal in its contest with the Univer
sity of the Pacific.
Despite the valiant efforts of Oden — who
completed the contest with match-highs of
19 kills, eight blocks and a .351 hitting per
centage — the Cardinal ultimately fell.
Yet, this past weekend Oden and her
mates staved off the two-game skid with a
two-game sweep of Arizona and Arizona
State.
While Arizona could only gamer a .165
hitting percentage, on Friday night Oden
toyed with her opponents, recording 18 kills
and a .310 hitting percentage as the Cardi
nal won with ease 15-9, 15-7, 5-15, 15-4.
Returning on Saturday to menace Ari
zona State, Oden mystified the Sun Devils
with 20 kills, 18 digs and a .368 hitting per
centage as the Cardinal routed ASU •

McNair, a 6-foot-5 senior holeman from
Lafayette, Calif., scorched his opponents
this past weekend in the NorCal Water Polo
Tournament at deGuerre Pool.
Recording a team-high 13 goals in the
No. 3 ranked water polo team's six games,
McNair led a steamrolling Cardinal attack to

six victories over such notables as defending
NCAA champion UC-Irvine, No. 5 UC-
Santa Barbara, No. 6 Pepperdine and No. 7
Fresno State.
Out of the six games, McNair and his
Cardinal polomates were only truly chal
lenged by UCSB. Pulling out a 9-8 triumph,
McNair left the crowd agape with three
goals.
