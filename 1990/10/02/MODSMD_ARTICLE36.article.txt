Anybody want to buy a "Farm Fresh" T-shirt?
Anybody want to buy 200 of them?
The ASSU T-Shirt Shop, which suffered last
year from excessive inventory, is writing off thou
sands of dollars in excess merchandise and trying
to become more visible and profitable.
T-Shirt Shop manager Horacio Tovar said his
predecessor "ordered some T-shirts that just
couldn't sell." Because the shop has such exces
sive inventory, it will write off close to $15,000 in
merchandise this year, he said. The extra shirts
will either be donated to a homeless shelter or will
be given out on a "buy-one-get-one-free" basis.
One notoriously poor seller was the "Farm
Fresh" T-shirt, targeted at last year's incoming
freshman class. The T-shirts, which read "Class
of 1993," were unpopular among freshmen who
"felt conscious" of their youth, according to assis
tant manager Kian Toh. The shop plans to hold
on to the 200 shirts that went unsold until the
Class of 1993 are seniors, when class pride might
boost sales.
Another unpopular item are 300 "very, very
cheap sweatshirts" that last year's manager
enthusiastically but unwisely purchased, Toh

said. He described them as "not as classy as some
of our other stuff."
This year, the shop is trying to improve itself is
through advertising. Toh said he would like to see
the shop be much more visible, and he is changing
the shopfront regularly in an attempt to improve
its image.
Torrence Boone, ASSU financial manager, said
the T-shirt Shop was making money despite the
inventory problems. "It's always been a healthy
project," he said. "[But the] inventory is dragging
on the profitability of the project."
The inventory miscalculation is actually help
ing the ASSU, Boone said. The ASSU has been
able to re-evaluate "the way the T-shirt Shop
looks at inventory," he said.
Boone had high praise for Tovar and Toh's
efforts. "They're doing a good job of getting [the
inventory] down. By the end of this year, it should
be back to normal."
The shop was created several years ago as a
service to the community, according to Tovar. The
prices, which range from $8 for most T-shirts to
$31 for some sweatshirts, are lower than those of
the Stanford Bookstore, he said. "We avoid the
high prices because we don't have to pay as much
overhead as the Bookstore."
