# FCC proposal may challenge phone system
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
A proposal by the Federal Communications
Commission may give dormitory residents the
right to choose their own long-distance service.
The document, released July 17, proposes to
prohibit the practice of call blocking by
providers of operator service. Call blocking is
when a user is prevented from accessing a pre
ferred carrier by the provider of telephone ser
vice through alternative dialing methods.
Because Stanford is now the sole provider of
telephone service to Stanford students, it is
able to block the use of AT&T, Sprint, MCI or
other long-distance carriers, which is now
banned under the new federal regulations.
Because the FCC definition specifically
includes universities, the proposal has poten
tial implications on the phone service that
Stanford students receive.
Since Stanford extended its telephone ser
vices to all student residences this year, stu
dents can make calls outside an eight-mile
radius only with a personal access code issued
by Stanford.
Students can also use a calling card issued
by a long-distance carrier, but this service usu
ally comes with a surcharge.
Jan Thomson, director of Communication
Services, said because Stanford allows the use
of calling cards, it has already satisfied the con
ditions of the federal proposal. "I do not believe
[the proposal] would affect the
system," she said.
Graduate student Mike Mur
ray, who this summer attempted
to get state regulation of Stan
ford's phone service, objected to
Thomson's interpretation of the
proposal. He said calling cards
should not be viewed as a service
of equal access to students
because of the high surcharge â€”
$0.50 to $1 per call.
In addition, students can no
longer dial 1-0-ATT to access
AT&T directly as the FCC pro
posed, Murray said.
During a comment period for
the proposal that ended last week,
Murray submitted a document
urging the FCC to adopt the new
measures. The document was
written by Jotham Stein, a third
year law student.
"Public policy demands that
consumers have the right to
choose," Stein wrote.
Stein argued that the Stanford
phone service does not allow

it has not chosen to exercise it (in the past),"
Williams said. The state of California has also
held that it does not regulate universities in
providing phone service.

users to subscribe to discount
long-distance plans such as
AT&T's "Reach Out America."
University General Counsel
Jasper Williams said last week he
is not sure if the FCC has preemp
tion, or exclusive authority, over
interstate phone use provided by
universities.
"If the FCC has jurisdiction
over universities, it has not cho
sen to exercise it (in the past),"
Williams said. The state of Cali
fornia has also held that it does
not regulate universities and col
leges in providing phone service,
he added.
In a June hearing initiated by
Murray and two other graduate
students before the Public Utili
ties Commission of California, it
was ruled that Stanford Tele
phone Service is neither a public

utility nor a shared tenant ser
vice. Judge Robert Baer con
cluded the commission has no
jurisdiction over student phone
service provided by Stanford.
The graduate students applied
for a rehearing. Because the com
mission has not issued a decision
60 days after the ruling, Williams
said he believes the appeal was
denied.
However, Stein, who repre
sented the students in the initial
ruling, said the appeal is still on
the commission's calendar. The
executive commissioners have
postponed considering the
rehearing application until their
next meeting on Oct. 12, Stein
said.
This is the second postpone
ment, he added.
