# Internal audit on indirect-cost recovery delayed
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A self-study of Stanford's indirect
cost recovery procedures is "still a
work in progress," according to Peter
Millington, the University's director of
internal audits.
The audit of Stanford's indirect
cost practices — the subject of two
ongoing federal investigations — was
supposed to be delivered to University
President Donald Kennedy on Friday.
But, in a brief interview yesterday,
Millington said the audit had not been
completed, and he declined to project
when it would be.
Kennedy ordered the internal audit
in late July, when concerns about
Stanford's relationship with the Office

of Naval Research
were raised by the
ONR's campus repre
sentative here, Paul
Biddle. The ONR is
the federal agency
that reviews research
costs at Stanford.
In a letter add
ressed to his superior
in the Navy, Biddle

wrote that indirect cost negotiations
between Stanford and the ONR were
marred by "abuse" and "distortion."
Indirect costs are expenditures nec
essary to support research but not eas
ily attributable to a specific project.
The government reimburses Stanford
for indirect costs incurred by govern
ment-sponsored research here.

Biddle's letter apparently prompted
an investigation of Stanford by the
ONR.
The General Accounting Office, at
the request of a House subcommittee,
is also investigating Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices. GAO officials are
expected to arrive on campus Oct. 11.
In an interview with The Daily last
week, Kennedy said the internal audit
should let him know "if there is some
large problem that has somehow
escaped us."
He has said repeatedly, however,
that Stanford has nothing to fear from
thorough outside investigations of its
indirect-cost procedures.
Larry Horton, associate vice presi

dent for public affairs, said yesterday
his "best guess" was that Kennedy
would receive the audit either by the
end of this week or by early next week.
Horton has been handling most
media inquiries on the subject of indi
rect costs.
Horton said Kennedy would circu
late the audit to administration offi
cials for review — a process that would
likely take a week — before publicly
releasing the document and comment
ing on its findings.
Horton added that the administra
tion would like to release the findings
of the audit before GAO staff arrive on
campus next week.
