# Campus homeowners may establish organization
## 
### Allison Shue Staff writer 
Residents of more than 800 house
holds on Stanford land will vote next
week on whether to establish a new
homeowners association to present
concerns about residential policies to
the University.
The new body, the Stanford Cam
pus Homeowners Inc., would incorpo
rate various local committees and
groups that have represented Stanford
homeowners in the past. A formal rat
ification meeting for the new group
will take place on Oct. 9.
If approved, the new association
would succeed the existing Stanford

Campus Homeowners Association, an
unincorporated and voluntary group.
Weldon Gibson, director emeritus of
SRI International and a Stanford
homeowner since 1959, has served as
president of the current association.
He said the new organization would be
a "campuswide collective voice of
homeowners on matters affecting the
governance of residential area policy
matters and projects."
The group would not act as a condo
minium association but would take up
matters concerning individual resi
dents' leases, Gibson added.
He said the University greatly wel
comes this move.
James Patell, associate dean of the

Graduate School of Business, has par
ticipated in several Stanford home
owner committees. He said residents
have been in "an awkward situation
because the campus sits on the bound
aries of so many jurisdictions."
According to Patell, the new corpo
ration could alleviate such complica
tions by uniting different local groups
into a single organization governed
with by-laws and a charter.
Patell cited problems associated
with traffic and taxation as examples
of concerns facing campus homeown
ers.
Funding for the new association
will come from two main sources. Up
to $100,000 for physical improvement

and public services would be taken
from the ground rent that homeown
ers already pay for the use of Stanford
land. Decisions on these projects will
be made by residents, but must have
the agreement of the University.
Gibson said this portion of the fund
ing is a reallocation of existing
resources and therefore would not be
an additional cost to residents.
In addition, the University would
contribute a matching $100,000 for
operating expenses and would also pro
vide office space for the group in
Encina Commons.
