# Oracle no longer hiring grads

Oracle Corporation, a Redwood
City computer software company
that has recruited heavily at Stan
ford in the past, is no longer hir
ing recent graduates.
The change in hiring practices
is part of a company-wide reorga
nization and consolidation that
was announced Sept. 17.
"With this consolidation, we
will reduce costs and further
improve the controls on our busi
ness," said Oracle President
Lawrence Ellison in a press
release. "We believe that making
these changes, as difficult and
overwhelming as all of them are,
is necessary for Oracle Corpora
tion's return to health and prof
itability in the second quarter."
In recent years, Oracle — the
third largest computer software
company in the world — has
worked with Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center
to recruit and hire Stanford grad
uates. The company has been con
sidered a desirable place to work
because it offered numerous
opportunities for graduates in
industrial engineering, engineer
ing economic systems, math and
computational sciences.
Oracle's new strategy suggests
a hiring freeze. In the past two

Oracle Corporation, previously a big
recruiter of Stanford graduates, has just
adopted a hiring freeze. The company's
stocks dropped 74 percent since March.

weeks, Oracle has reduced its
domestic work force by 10 per
cent. In addition, many employees
have been reassigned or demoted,
according to Yolanda Morales of
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center's recruiting depart
ment.
Oracle laid off one alumnus
who last week approached the
CPPC for help in acquiring
another job, and a 1990 Stanford
graduate was laid off after work
ing only eight days for the com
pany, Morales said. Oracle is also
not participating in this month's
Career Faire.
Representatives from Oracle's
recruiting department refused to
comment further or release any
hiring statistics.
Morales said she does not
expect Oracle to hire as many
Stanford students as in the past,
but emphasized that the CPPC is
available to help alumni who have

lost their jobs and students who
had planned to seek employment
with Oracle.
Since its founding in 1977,
Oracle has pushed to compete
with Microsoft, which has domi
nated the computer software mar
ket. Oracle reported its first quar
terly loss three weeks ago.
On Sept. 7, the company
announced that it could not meet
its growth target of 50 percent,
instead estimating one of 30 per
cent in the first quarter. By Sept.
25, Oracle had reported revenue
growth of only 16 percent. Shares
of the company's stock have
dropped 74 percent since March.
Although last spring a job with
Oracle looked like the perfect
career choice for many graduating
students, the company's tenuous
financial position may signal an
end to years of dependable
recruiting at Stanford.
