# Marketable electric car moving closer to consumer
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
The idea of electric cars seems futur
istic, even fantastic. But a model devel
oped at Stanford which uses both elec
tricity and gasoline could be marketable
within months, if auto makers make it a
priority
The Hybrid Electric Vehicle Project
has converted a standard Chevrolet Cor
sica into a car powered entirely by elec
tricity for standard daily use. The car
runs on gasoline only on longer rides.
The car, a prototype designed to show
that such a vehicle could be produced,

will be on display for the first time on
campus today at noon in White Plaza.
Although the project is not directly
sponsored by Stanford, many of the
researchers are University faculty, staff
and students working on a volunteer
basis.
Cars running entirely on electricity
or other alternative fuels are not
expected to enter the marketplace until
the end of the decade, because of produc
tion difficulties.
However, because the hybrid car is
made from an existing model which is
"already in production and does not
need to be built from the ground up, the

length of time needed to get the hybrid
into production is greatly shortened,"
said project director John Reuyle, a vis
iting engineering scholar.
Reuyle is optimistic that if auto com
panies actively pursue the development
of the hybrid car, the car could be made
available to consumers within months
after companies decide to offer it as an
option.
Since the hybrid car weighs only 100
pounds more than the standard vehicle,
Reuyle expects the rebuilt car to do as
well on all safety and impact tests as the
conventional Corsica, further expediting
the development process.

The car is designed primarily for com
muters — people who do not drive long
distances to work every day. However, it
is not limited to such short trips.
A lightweight, readily-available bat
tery powers the vehicle's engine, and
according to Reuyle, the car is expected
to travel 20 to 25 miles on this source of
energy alone.
The average car trip in America is
under five miles, and the average com
mute to work in a metropolitan region is
11 miles.
The greatest drawback of previously
designed electric cars is limited range —
their inability to travel long distances

without being recharged.
This drawback is eliminated in the
hybrid car by the gasoline-powered
back-up system, which provides the
range of a conventional car with a
"cleaner" engine — one that releases
fewer pollutants.
For longer trips, the driver can switch
to an on-board battery charger, which
would run on conventional fuel. This
simple conversion can be made manu
ally while driving.
According to Reuyle, short trips in
conventional cars are far less efficient
than longer ones. Cold
engine parts do not work at
optimal levels and emit far
more pollutants per mile,
and cars waste fuel when
idling in traffic or at traffic
lights.
The hybrid car, however,
does not have any of these
problems. The battery pre
heats the engine before the
car switches to gasoline, no
fuel is used at all when the
car is not in motion, and
running on electricity does
not release any harmful
emissions.
The tough California
vehicle emissions laws,
which will take effect this
decade, are expected to
encourage the auto industry
to seek out methods of
reducing emissions, accord
ing to Don Dunn, professor
of engineering economics
systems.
Dunn and a colleague,
engineering-economic sys
tems Prof. James Sweeney,
expect to receive a grant
from the California Insti
tute of Energy Efficiency to
begin a several-year study of
the hybrid car's potential
impact on the state econ
omy as well as jn air pollu
tion regulations and other
vehicle policies.
