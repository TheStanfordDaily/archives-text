Gulf tensions increase
United States bolstered its forces in the
Persian Gulf on yesterday with the arrival of
the aircraft carrier USS Independence, and
France fired warning shots at a freighter sus
pected nf violating the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
As the gulf crisis entered its third month,
U.S. military sources in Saudi Arabia said
Baghdad has strengthened its forces in south
ern Iraq and Kuwait and has now deployed
nearly half its 1 million-man army to defend
the occupied territory.
In Jerusalem, jitters over the protracted
crisis jumped to the surface when a faulty
siren signaling air attack sent Israelis scurry
ing into bomb shelters.
The mishap took place less than 24 hours
after the government announced it would dis
tribute gas masks to all Israeli citizens.
Drug lab explodes
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A cocaine
processing laboratory blew up yesterday in a
house next to a school in Medellin, killing nine
people and injuring 57, including 20 children
at the school, officials said.
A police communique said four children were
among those killed, none of them pupils at
the school.
A mushroom-shaped cloud rose after the
explosion, and odors of gasoline, ether and
other chemicals filled the air, witnesses said
in broadcast reports from the scene.
More than 20 vehicles were destroyed.
The explosion came at 9:45 a.m., when the
school was filled with hundreds of pupils.
Bush seeks public
support for budget
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
asked taxpayers yesterday night to support a
$500 billion package of tax increases and
spending cuts. "Everyone will bear a small
burden but if we succeed, every American will
have a large burden lifted," he said.
Claiming rare unity with leaders of the
Democratic-controlled Congress, Bush said in
a 10-minute televised speech from the Oval
Office that the package was written in "eight
months of blood, sweat and fears — fears of
the economic chaos that would follow if we
fail to reduce the deficit."
"It is the best agreement that can be legis
lated now," Bush said.
Bush's address from the Oval Office was
nationally televised, but his message was pri
marily aimed 16 blocks away: at Congress,
where an initial vote on the plan may be held
as early as tomorrow.
Although the package generally has support
among Democrats, lawmakers from Bush's
own party — particularly in the House —
have balked at its tax provisions. Bush himself
had to abandon his "no new taxes" pledge in
the face of the growing deficit.
Fusion milestone reached
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Physicists at Prince
ton University say they have reached a mile
stone toward commercial use of the power
packed in a hydrogen bomb — a fusion reactor
capable of producing as much energy as it
consumes.
Scientists say the breakthrough allows them
to move toward developing fusion as an alter
native energy to coal and nuclear power plants.
However, they cautioned that the project,
which has already spanned 15 years and cost
$1 billion, faces several mtyor hurdles, includ
ing determining how to extract the energy
from the reactor.
Scientists said yesterday that the Tokamak
Fusion Test Reactor in Princeton could reach
the "break even" point sometime after 1993,
but warned that commercial use remains
decades away.
The researchers, at the Princeton Plasma
Physics Research Laboratory, have combined
atoms of a heavy form of hydrogen called
deuterium to form helium and energy.
The next step, which the researchers hope
to achieve in 1993, would use deuterium and
a radioactive form of hydrogen called tritium
to generate large amounts of energy in the
Tokamak reactor.
Poles worried about Germany
SLUBICE, Poland (AP) — On the western
side of the Oder River, fireworks exploded and
Germans cheered today as the flag of the
united nation was hoisted.
But on the eastern bank, Poles were more
subdued, watching with a mixture of fear and
resentment at new German attitudes and pol
icies.
The ceremony marking the unification of
Germany was preceded by stone-throwing at
tacks by German youths on two Polish buses
picking up factory workers in Frankfurt on
Oder, the German city across the river from
Slubice.
Two Polish cars waiting to cross the border
back into Poland also were pounded by youths.
