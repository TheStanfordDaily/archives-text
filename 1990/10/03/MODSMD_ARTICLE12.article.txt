# Millions celebrate rebirth of a nation
## Two Germanys become one 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — The two Germanys
ended 45 years of division with a blaze
of fireworks and the pealing of church
bells Wednesday, declaring the creation
of a new German nation in the heart
of Europe.
Near the ruins of Hitler's citadel in
the city that symbolized the Cold War
division of Europe, the German flag
was hoisted to crown the dramatic
rush to unify a Germany divided by
World War II and the Communist Ber
lin Wall.
Rockets burst in the sky over Berlin,
illuminating the war-scarred Reichstag
building and the Brandenburg Gate.
The shower of fireworks also lighted
the upturned faces of thousands of
Germans, united in peace but troubled
by the political and economic problems
facing a united Germany.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President
Richard von Weizsaecker and former
leader Willy Brandt stood in the glare
of floodlights at the Reichstag and
joined in singing the national anthem
as a vast party occurred across the
land of 78 million residents. Millions
of Germans and a watching world
joined the ceremony by television.
Wednesday was declared a national
holiday, but late Tuesday police in
Goettingen, 66 miles south of Hanover,

reported 1,000 leftist protesters op
posed to unification rampaged through
the city. Authorities said the radicals
broke store windows and chanted
"Never Again Germany!" and "Nazis
out!" In Berlin, police detained seven
people who were caught with paint
and gas pistols. Another man was ar
rested in the Kreuzberg district after
a policeman was stabbed in the arm
during a scuffle between police and
about 500 youthful demonstrators.
In the northern port of Rostock,
authorities evacuated 23 Soviet Jews
from a refugee center because of fears
the center could become a target of
rightist radicals. No incidents were re
ported.
At least four people were injured
and more than 10 arrested in scuffles
between police and demonstrators in
Schwerin, where some celebrated uni
fication with the Nazi "Sieg-Heil" sa
lute, witnesses said. Police also re
ported clashes with youths in Leipzig
and Hamburg.
The ceremony marked return of a
united Germany built on the ruins of
Adolf Hitler's defeat in World War II
and the end of Cold War antagonism
that split Europe into competing blocs
led by the United States and the Soviet
Union.

It came less than 11 months after
the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9,
1989, by a tide of democracy that swept
away Communist regimes across East
ern Europe.
Fourteen schoolchildren from the
former East and West Germanys
carried the huge, 72-square-yard Ger
man flag and hoisted it up the 132-
foot-tall mast in front of the Reichstag.
Hundreds of thousands of people,
waving German flags, crowded along
the Unten den Linden thoroughfare
and June 17th Street that once were
cut by the Berlin Wall.
Fireworks exploded over the
Reichstag as a replica of the Liberty
Bell, donated to Berlin by the Amer
ican people, pealed.
"Germany is one again, Germany is
sovereign," said German television.
"Forty-five years after the uncondi
tional surrender" of Nazi Germany
"the two German states are united."
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
said of unification minutes before mid
night, "What for most people had been
only a dream has become reality."
Then, Kurt Masur directed Beetho
ven's Ninth Sympony as East Germany
ceased to exist to the deep chords of
the "Ode to Joy." City authorities
had banned demonstrations near the

Brandenburg Gate, the 200-year-old
monument that was a focus of celebra
tions.
The broad thoroughfares around the
Brandenburg Gate were thronged with
tens of thousands of people hours
before the historic occasion, and ven
dors sold food, drinks and souvenirs.
Dixieland jazz, street musicians and
organ-grinders played music that rang
in the chilly fall air.
Searchlight beams waved in a cloud
less sky, and a tall crane dangled an
old East German "Trabi" car 50 feet
in the air just south of the massive
stone gate.
About 200 leftist radicals lined a
police barrier outside the Schauspiel
haus, blowing whistles and jeering at
dignitaries arriving for a formal state
ceremony hosted by the departing East
German government.
The radicals chanted "Germany,
drop dead!" Kohl, 60, said in a state
ment to the Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper that the new Germany will
help stabilize Europe, and that it
would not be a "restless Reich" like
Nazi Germany, which plunged Europe
into its most disastrous war.
The unification of Germany is a
"European, indeed a world event of
historic rank," Kohl said.

organ-grinders played music that rang
in the chilly fall air.
Searchlight beams waved in a cloud
less sky, and a tall crane dangled an
old East German "Trabi" car 50 feet

About 200 leftist radicals lined a
police barrier outside the Schauspiel
haus, blowing whistles and jeering at
dignitaries arriving for a formal state

The radicals chanted "Germany,

ment to the Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper that the new Germany will

would not be a "restless Reich" like
Nazi Germany, which plunged Europe
into its most disastrous war.
The unification of Germany is a
"European, indeed a world event of
historic rank," Kohl said.
BERLIN (AP) — The two Germanys
ended 45 years of division with a blaze
of fireworks and the pealing of church
bells Wednesday, declaring the creation
of a new German nation in the heart
of Europe.
Near the ruins of Hitler's citadel in
the city that symbolized the Cold War
division of Europe, the German flag
was hoisted to crown the dramatic
rush to unify a Germany divided by
World War II and the Communist Ber
lin Wall.
Rockets burst in the sky over Berlin,
illuminating the war-scarred Reichstag
building and the Brandenburg Gate.
The shower of fireworks also lighted
the upturned faces of thousands of
Germans, united in peace but troubled
by the political and economic problems
facing a united Germany.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President
Richard von Weizsaecker and former
leader Willy Brandt stood in the glare
of floodlights at the Reichstag and
joined in singing the national anthem
as a vast party occurred across the
land of 78 million residents. Millions
of Germans and a watching world
joined the ceremony by television.
Wednesday was declared a national
holiday, but late Tuesday police in
Goettingen, 66 miles south of Hanover,

reported 1,000 leftist protesters op
posed to unification rampaged through
the city. Authorities said the radicals
broke store windows and chanted
"Never Again Germany!" and "Nazis
out!" In Berlin, police detained seven
people who were caught with paint
and gas pistols. Another man was ar
rested in the Kreuzberg district after
a policeman was stabbed in the arm
during a scuffle between police and
about 500 youthful demonstrators.
In the northern port of Rostock,
authorities evacuated 23 Soviet Jews
from a refugee center because of fears
the center could become a target of
rightist radicals. No incidents were re
ported.
At least four people were injured
and more than 10 arrested in scuffles
between police and demonstrators in
Schwerin, where some celebrated uni
fication with the Nazi "Sieg-Heil" sa
lute, witnesses said. Police also re
ported clashes with youths in Leipzig
and Hamburg.
The ceremony marked return of a
united Germany built on the ruins of
Adolf Hitler's defeat in World War II
and the end of Cold War antagonism
that split Europe into competing blocs
led by the United States and the Soviet
Union.

It came less than 11 months after
the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9,
1989, by a tide of democracy that swept
away Communist regimes across East
ern Europe.
Fourteen schoolchildren from the
former East and West Germanys
carried the huge, 72-square-yard Ger
man flag and hoisted it up the 132-
foot-tall mast in front of the Reichstag.
Hundreds of thousands of people,
waving German flags, crowded along
the Unten den Linden thoroughfare
and June 17th Street that once were
cut by the Berlin Wall.
Fireworks exploded over the
Reichstag as a replica of the Liberty
Bell, donated to Berlin by the Amer
ican people, pealed.
"Germany is one again, Germany is
sovereign," said German television.
"Forty-five years after the uncondi
tional surrender" of Nazi Germany
"the two German states are united."
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
said of unification minutes before mid
night, "What for most people had been
only a dream has become reality."
Then, Kurt Masur directed Beetho
ven's Ninth Sympony as East Germany
ceased to exist to the deep chords of
the "Ode to Joy." City authorities
had banned demonstrations near the

Brandenburg Gate, the 200-year-old
monument that was a focus of celebra
tions.
The broad thoroughfares around the
Brandenburg Gate were thronged with
tens of thousands of people hours
before the historic occasion, and ven
dors sold food, drinks and souvenirs.
Dixieland jazz, street musicians and
organ-grinders played music that rang
in the chilly fall air.
Searchlight beams waved in a cloud
less sky, and a tall crane dangled an
old East German "Trabi" car 50 feet
in the air just south of the massive
stone gate.
