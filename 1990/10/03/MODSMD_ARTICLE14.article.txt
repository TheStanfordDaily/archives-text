# Immigration reform debated
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House moved toward approval of
a overhaul of the nation's
legal immigration system yester
day, rejecting a move to limit the
annual total of newcomers arriv
ing in this country to 630,000.
"This is a far-reaching reform
of our immigration system," Rep.
Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., said as
the House debated a proposal that
represents the first reshap
ing of legal immigration law since
1965.
The House defeated the cap,
245-165, with critics saying it
would torpedo efforts to rejoin
families and bring in skilled
workers. Supporters said it would
prevent a strain on government
services by an overflow of immi
grants.
After defeating the cap, the
House plowed through amend
ments but was unable to finish
work on the bill yesterday night.
It planned to resume today.
The bill eases restrictions on
reunification of families split by
current immigration law. It also
ends 25-year-old barriers making
it tough for individuals from cer

tain countries to come here.
Provisions of the bill also would
increase the number of highly
skilled and otherwise needed
foreign-born workers.
Before the measure could be
sent to the president for his signa
ture, a conference committee
would have to resolve differences
between the bill and a Senate
passed version.
The Bush administration has
been cold to the measure, saying
that the number of immigrants
should be limited to 630,000 an
nually, the figure in the Senate
version.
The House bill would increase
the annual influx from the cur
rent 540,000 to 775,000 and pare
down enormous waiting lists of
spouses and children waiting to
come to the United States.
Morrison, chief sponsor of the
bill, said the vote on the proposed
630,000 limit proposed by Rep.
Lamar Smith, R-Texas, repre
sented "the nearest thing to a test
vote on the bill."
"Are we going to allow outdated
assumptions and nativism to

hinder our growth?" Richardson
said.
The bill would extend to the
immediate families of permanent
residents of the United States the
same unrestricted right to come
here as is currently provided to
families of U.S. citizens. It would
raise the influx of such individuals
from the current 436,000 to an
estimated 520,000.
The measure contains scores of
other provisions dear to law
makers. For the first time, Ireland
and Northern Ireland would be
treated as separate entities for
visa purposes, doubling their
claim on those available under the
program to compensate countries
that were hurt by the 1965 law.
And the bill would provide
15,000 additional visas for Hong
Kong employees of the estimated
900 American companies doing
business in that British crown
colony. The firms say they have
suffered a brain drain of 24 per
cent of their top employees over
the last year as jitters set in over
the scheduled return of the colony
to China in 1997.
