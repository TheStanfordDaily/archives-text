# Senate approves Judge Souter
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted 90-9
yesterday to confirm the nomination of Judge David
Souter to the Supreme Court. The only dissenting
votes came from liberals who fear he will oppose
abortion rights.
The New Hampshire jurist was approved less

than two months after he was
tapped as President Bush's first
nominee to the high court. It was
too late put him on the court for
the start of its session this week
but, at age 51, he'll probably par
ticipate in its rulings well into the
next century.
The Supreme Court announced
that Souter would be sworn in as
the first item of business this morn
ing.

At the White House, presidential spokesman Mar
lin Fitzwater said: "We're obviously very pleased
that Congress confirmed this nomination. We think
Judge Souter will be an outstanding justice for
many years. He will render many learned decisions."
Fitzwater said Bush hoped to attend Souter's
swearing-in.
"He's just exactly the kind of person with a broad
background that we need on the Supreme Court,"
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said as debate on the
nomination began. "I think he showed that he is
a person of fairness. He's willing to listen. He's a
person of independence."
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden, D-Del., said he supported Souter, but warned
Bush that the path of the next nominee might not
be so smooth if the President moves further to the
right wing.
"I want to express the hope that the administra
tion will not learn the wrong lesson" from the
lopsided Senate vote on Souter, Biden said. A more
doctrinaire conservative "could well fall outside the
sphere of acceptability," he said.
Souter becomes the 105 th justice of the Supreme
Court, filling the seat vacated last summer by the
retirement of Justice William Brennan.
The court's spokeswoman, Toni House, said Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist would administer the
oath of office in private at 9 a.m. and would ad
minister the oath in a public ceremony in the court's
ornate courtroom 15 minutes later.
The first case in which he will participate
will be a sex-bias dispute that will be argued before
the justices Wednesday. At issue is whether employ
ers may exclude all women of child-bearing age —
perhaps 20 million — from some hazardous jobs.
There was little doubt Souter would be a more
conservative justice than Brennan, especially on
matters of criminal law. But Souter's position on
social issues, including abortion, would be harder
to predict.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
waited until just before the vote to announce his
support. "Judge Souter reflected a reasoned ap
proach and a sound understanding of the Consti
tution," he said.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he was
unwilling to give Souter the benefit of the doubt.
All nine voting against Souter were Democrats:
Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, Brock Adams of Washing
ton, Alan Cranston of California, Bill Bradley and
Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Quentin Burdick
of North Dakota, Kennedy, John Kerry of Massa
chusetts and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
