## Conservation needed 
### 
Stanford has made major
successful conservation
efforts; more are needed

Among the various issues
on campus, there is one which
crosses all barriers and binds us
all — conservation of the environment.
The environmental issue is a very
tangible one. Each of us can partici
pate and help solve the problems fac
ing our planet.
Stanford, for instance, has shown
itself capable of recycling; the numer
ous green bins on campus are being
regularly filled through the efforts of
the Stanford community.
At the same time, however, this uni
versity has a less than admirable
record in water conservation, bringing
on direct costs in excess of $40,000.
The responsibility for this problem
falls onto everyone.
Among the methods to reduce water
use:
• Cut down shower time as much as
possible.
• Turn off water faucets when
unneeded while brushing teeth or
washing dishes.
• Report faulty sprinklers to Facili
ties.
RA's could also "replace" parents by
often reminding people in their houses
of these tips and others.
We must also keep in mind ways to
cut down on the use of electricity,
another easily wasted resource.
• Turn off lights, stereos and other
appliances when you leave your room.
• Turn off unnecessary stack and

carrel lights in the library.
• Look for other wasteful uses of
electricity, such as lights in empty
classrooms.
Even if each of us saved only a few
minutes of electricity a day, the sum
total would be significant.
Stanford has taken strides in the
conservation of paper, and we should
continue to look for more opportuni
ties.
Row houses and many other dorms
allow only one flier to be posted in
their main halls; if others follow suit,
student groups will need only a hand
ful of fliers to cover all campus resi
dences.
There are also many ways to con
serve another vital resource: gasoline.
The rising cost of gasoline has made
driving expensive, and we should not
forget the indirect, long-term effects of
pollution.
Simply put: don't drive if you can
bike.
We have the advantage of a bicycle
friendly area, and most places we have
to get to are within reach.
Many of us who live on campus
don't have to pay for the resources we
waste now. We must realize, however,
that even if we do not pay for resources
now, we will all pay for wasteful behav
ior indirectly through our University
bills.
More importantly, every time we're
wasteful, we're gambling that some
resource will be found to replace our
dwindling stores of oil and natural gas.
And excessive consumption is a fool
ish thing to jeopardize our future for.
We should remember that we are
not addressing an abstract, insoluble
problem. And the price for a lack of
foresight may be terribly high.
