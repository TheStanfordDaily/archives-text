Gorbachev video does
not exclude protesters
I disagree with Eyal Mozes's letter
(Tuesday, Oct. 2) about the commemora
tive videotape we produced of the Soviet
leader's visit last June.
The University welcomed President
Gorbachev with open arms and great
enthusiasm, and the cameras captured
the predominant feeling of the day.
Mozes's main complaint is that we
somehow excluded the protests, which
simply isn't true.
In fact, we made no attempt to either
exclude or particularly feature the
protests. They appear in the video as one
part of the many activities of that day.
Mozes complains that no protest
signs can be read. In fact, the video con
tains at least three separate close-ups of
signs held by protesters.
These close-ups are part of a rapid
montage of crowd shots set to music, but
the camera lingers on the signs and
protesters at least as long as on other
messages of welcome and the faces of
enthusiastic greeters.
The rest of the video is about prepara
tions for the event, Gorbachev's tour of
the Quad and his speech in Memorial
Auditorium, during which, there were
few, if any, signs of protest.
Mozes states that the video "was
made without any attempt to gather
information from Stanford students."
In fact, we spoke with many students
before and after the event. Most were
upbeat about the visit, and the video has
received high praise from many who
have seen it. Mozes's is the first com
plaint I've heard since we released the
tape in July.
When Mozes contacted me by phone
last week, he suggested that perhaps the
video should be recalled. I respectfully
disagreed with him and suggested that
instead he make a video about the
protests.
And I think an examination of the
issues behind the protests would make

an interesting piece. I repeat my offer to
assist.
However, I'm proud of the choices we
made and the result we got in the video
tape and I stand by it. I think it accu
rately captures what was, for many, a
wonderful day at Stanford.

scheduling of concert,
game was insensitive
I am writing to express my disap
pointment in the Stanford Athletic
Department's scheduling of sporting
events and the Beach Boys concert on
Yom Kippur, the most solemn day of the
Jewish year.
The insensitivity demonstrated by
the department astonishes me. A greater
effort should have been made to resched
ule the events.
Understandably, these efforts may
have been futile, given that the meyority
of scheduling of sporting events takes
place years in advance.
A football game with a local team like
San Jose State, however, should not have
been impossible to move to another date.
Even if I could excuse the callousness
demonstrated by the sporting event's
scheduling, I cannot do so for the deci
sion to have the Beach Boys perform.
The concert could have been sched
uled after any home football game, and
choosing the one that coincided with the
Jewish holiday further demonstrated the
Athletic Department's lack of concern
and ignorance about Judaism.
The Athletic Department owes the
Jewish community an apology for its
insensitivity and ignorance. I hope that
no such apologies will be necessary in
the future.

Student apathy could
have been important
factor in San Jose loss
How sad. It seems ironic to me that
on a weekend when Stanford spirit
should be at an all-time high, we see a
visiting school out-cheer us in our own
stadium.
I sat in the stadium Saturday and lis
tened as San Jose State students and
alumni yelled and screamed to support
their football team.
On our side of the field, however, the
only cries I heard were those of two
freshmen sitting behind me, saying,
"Man, those [San Jose State] guys are
loud."
Of course, once we scored our first
touchdown in the third quarter every-

body jumped up and down, clapping furi
ously to the Band's excellent rendition of
"All Right Now."
That lasted a long, drawn out, exten
sive ... minute, or maybe two. Even
when our own players tried to pump up
the crowd by waving their arms, the only
response was a lukewarm smattering of
polite applause and cheers of "Donner!",
"Roble!", and "Branner sucks!"
Who can say what would have hap
pened had we cheered more, or had San
Jose State cheered less?
A friend of mine pointed out to me
that a crowd proved to be the decisive
factor in an NFL game this season.
How many points did we lose by? Six?
Hmmm ... a touchdown would have
done it...and it would [should, could]
have been 30-29, 2-2 and ridin' high.
Maybe instead of throwing water bal
loons and screaming insults at 15 fellow
students who made an effort, we should
try to find a different, viable solution to
Stanford's stadium apathy.
