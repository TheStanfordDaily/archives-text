## McDLT's vs. Piroshki 
### 
PESHAWAR, A DUSTY CITY at the
foot of Pakistan's Khyber Pass that
teems with mercenaries, heroin
traders and Afghani refugees, was the
world spy capital in the 80s.
There on a journalism assignment last
summer, I was captivated by its mysteri
ousness.
As my guide packed our car with
Kalashnikov machine guns for a voyage
across the Afghani border, I felt an urge
to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola and indulge
in a moment of familiar Americana.
I wanted to resist out of anger at the
shamelessness with which the cola war is
fought on Peshawar's long boulevards —
Coca-Cola and Pepsi billboards alternat
ing rhythmically as one zooms through
the impoverished cityscape.
But alas, I gave in, enjoying every
dancing drop of carbonation on my
parched tongue. So far from home, yet so
c105e....
Accessibility to the tastes of home is
becoming more common as Americana
spreads around the globe.
To be honest, Coca-Cola's omnipres
ence is hard to get worked up about as it
is endowed with an almost cosmic univer
sality.
But take McDonald's. Its first Moscow
restaurant is now its largest volume out
let. The incessant queues are a familiar
sight to Russians, but the cheerful "Have
a nice day" with which the cashiers con
clude each transaction elicits gasps of
shock from a clientele unaccustomed to
the "customer is king" philosophy.
Despite this good cheer, I'm worried
about what the spread of McDonald's por
tends for global diversity.

With twenty outlets planned for the
Russians and several implanted in Hun
gary, it is now the vanguard of American
capitalism in Eastern Europe. In a land
where ideological labels are reversed —
with Marxists on the "right" and free
marketeers the "left" — the new radical
revolutionaries are no longer making
Molotov cocktails, but rather typing
admission applications to Hamburger
University in Oak Brook, Illinois.
What explains its success? Richard
Pascale of Stanford's Business School
explained that when red meat was first
targeted by the health food movement,
McDonald's trembled.
But then (Can't you picture a room full
of shaken McDonald's executives sweat
ing this out?) someone pointed out that
McDonald's doesn't sell hamburgers ...
it sells "predictable experiences."
Liberated by this revelation, McDon
ald's forged bravely ahead, introducing
standardized chicken, fish, even lobster
sandwiches (No kidding, I recently sam
pled one on Route 1 in Maine).
Why, we might ask ourselves, is pre
dictability so seductive? Is this a trivial
matter or is it somehow at the root of
such afflictions as cultural intolerance?
Whichever, it appears that Ameri
cana's mass-produced, franchise-driven
spread endangers diversity. Anyone who
has driven across America can testify that
small towns today look frighteningly like
each other.
The fast-food strips have overwhelmed
the local restaurants. I want my children
to be able to travel to places out of reach
of a "Quarter Pounder." I don't want
their all-too-human instinct toward the

predictable to be perpetually appeased
before they are challenged to sample local
tastes and experiences.
Of course, for the Russians, a brightly
packaged "Big Mac" represents not the
predictable, but a chance to escape their
own brand of state-imposed monotony
and taste previously forbidden fruits from
the other side of the Iron Curtain.
Yet in reaching out for diversity, they
are inadvertently abetting the insidious
march of Western uniformity and pre
dictability.
Let's call me a "diversophile;" it's less
hackneyed than "multiculturalist" and
somewhat less of a mouthful.
The diversophilian revolution must
start at home and, anyway, we've got
enough foreign involvement on our plat
ter right now. I'll start plotting. Until I
get back to you, promise me you'll eat
Russian piroshki instead of McDLT's and
maybe, on the global balance sheet of
diversity, we can compensate for all those
McNugget-enraptured Russians.
