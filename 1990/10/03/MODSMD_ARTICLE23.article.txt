# The 						winds of freedom blow, but Germany still has far to go
## 
### 
I WOULD NOT BE AT STANFORD
today if my dad had not run into trou
ble with the East German secret
police ("Stasi") thirty years ago. Rather, I
would have grown up in East Germany,
learned Russian at high school, and —
who knows — maybe attended Moscow
State University.
In the late '50s, the "Stasi"
approached my father with the request to
inform them about potential dissidents
among his fellow students at his univer
sity.
As an incentive, they offered to get him
a car if he complied, and one year of labor
in a coal mine if he didn't.
Luckily, the country had not yet been
sealed ofT, and he and his family were able
to flee to West Germany, leaving behind
everything they owned.
So it happened that I was born in the
other half of divided Germany, the "better
half," as I am willing to contend.
My mother has a similar story to tell,
and so I have learned two important
lessons from the history of my own fam
ily: to value freedom as the basic human
right above everything else, and to realize
how lucky I have been having all the

opportunities I can now choose from.
Using these lessons as yardsticks, I
found it much easier to identify for myself
what I now think are the most basic
issues of the current unification turmoil.
One certainty is that, to use the Stan
ford motto, "the winds of freedom" are
now blowing in both parts of Germany.
However, it is important to note that
the necessary condition for this change
was not the formal unification process
that began in July, but the very first in
this long chain of events: the peaceful rev
olution that took place in East Germany
and elsewhere in Eastern Europe last fall.
Bertold Brecht once remarked that one
would be unable to recruit Germans for a
revolution. Given the order to occupy a
railway station, they would at first try to
buy a ticket.
I believe that many East Germans can
now claim to have proved Brecht wrong.
Considering Germany's poor record in
democracy up to 1949, the unswerving
Monday Demonstrations in Leipzig and
elsewhere with the slogan "We pre the
people" stand out as a genuine achieve
ment.
Secondly, it should be understood that

There are only very few in my country who deny
what happened, but there are many who want to
forget.

East Germany and the other nations of
Eastern Europe deserve more than just
handouts; we are obligated to grant them
our full support and to abstain from any
kind of condescension.
For the 45 years of the post-war period,
we have indeed been lucky and should
now be willing to share what we have
accumulated.
In particular, we must avoid the feeling
of superiority that all-too-ofTten sneaks
into our dealings with the East.
Admittedly, I was puzzled to see the
slogan "we are the people" turn into "we
are one people," the focus of public atten
tion shifting from freedom to unity, from
constitutional rights to joint capitalism.
Unification went by far too fast for my
taste, and it did not seem neccessary to
me. Sometimes I wished it would not
occur at all, especially considering the

fears of our neighbors.
But when I went home for summer
break, I realized that I had selfishly failed
to take into account the East German
perspective: Can they really be blamed for
their urgent wish to play it as safe as pos
sible politically and economically by sim
ply rushing to copy our system, even with
all its faults?
It was easy for me as a West German to
be against unification, and it took me a
while to realize that my opinion did not
really count. We have an obligation to
respect an East German wish to join West
Germany and to carry the burdens and
discomforts associated with it. There is
much more at stake for them than there
is for us.
But our solidarity must not simply
stop at the borders of the soon-to-be-uni

fled Germany. It must encompass our
neighbors as well, particularly those who
suffered from German terror during
World War 11. This means first of all that
we have to be willing to confront our past.
I know that we still have a sizable dis
tance to cover on our way to "normality."
This uncomfortable truth occurred to me
once again when I visited the memorial
site at the former Dachau concentration
camp a couple weeks ago: I met visitors
from all over the world, but only a small
number Germans.
There are only very few in my country
who deny what happened, but there are
many who want to forget. On the other
hand, last year's peaceful revolution was
very promising in this respect: The
majority of Germans seem to have
learned by now what "democracy" really
means.
The winds of freedom have swept away
the totalitarian regime of the present, but
not the gloomy shadows of the past.
