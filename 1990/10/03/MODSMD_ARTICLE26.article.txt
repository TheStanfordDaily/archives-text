## The 						next extension cord may be to your car Stanford-based hybrid electric vehicle project may make electricity viable fuel

If you are a typical '90s college
student, you probably have an
abundance of electrical devices —
a TV or stereo, an alarm clock or
computer — in your dorm room.
But in another year you may have
yet another appliance plugged in
— your car.
Or the battery that runs it,
anyway.
A car powered by an electric
battery during standard daily use
has been developed at Stanford by
the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Pro
ject, and could be marketable
within a few months, according to
projrct director John Reuyle.
The car is a refashioned
Chevrolet Corsica which runs
entirely on electricity for 20-25
miles, and switches over to gaso
line for the remaining mileage
(which is unlimited, as in conven
tional cars).
Cars being developed which
run entirely on electricity could be
available on the market no earlier
than 1998. This car, however,
could be produced much sooner,
according to Reuyle.
Because all the components of
the car are essentially unchanged
except for the engine, Reuyle
expects that it would be far sim
pler to manufacture this
retrofitted car than to build a car
from the ground up.
According to Reuyle, auto com
panies could make the hybrid car

Automakers could make the hybrid
electric car on existing production lines
and just change what's under the hood.

on existing production lines, and
just "change what's under the
hood."
Assuming the companies make
the hybrid a high priority, it would
only take months from the time
the automakers decide to offer it
as an option to the time it is avail
able to the consumer.
If made widely available, a car
like this prototype could ease the
country's dependency on
imported oil and greatly reduce
exhaust (and thus cause an
increase in urban air quality)
while avoiding the drawbacks of
purely electric cars.
The greatest disadvantage of
previously designed cars which
run on electricity is the limited
distance they can travel before
their batteries require several
hours of recharging.
This is not a problem for the
hybrid vehicle, however.
The hybrid car runs purely on
electricity for the first 20-25 miles
(the average length of car trips in
America is five miles and the aver
age commute in metropolitan
areas is 22 miles round trip).
But for longer trips, the driver

can manually turn on the gaso
line-powered battery charger,
which permits her to travel any
distance, refueling the engine
with gas as she would a conven
tional car.
The battery used in the car is

lightweight and can be readily
purchased "in any K-mart,"
Reuyle says. It can be recharged
overnight in any standard electri
cal socket.
The batteries used in purely
electric-run vehicles, however, are
much larger and heavier and
require sockets with higher volt
aged to recharge.
The hybrid car is designed pri
marily for commuters who drive
under 25 miles on a usual day, and
will therefore be relying primarily
on electricity as a power source.
Short trips are the most ineffi

cient in terms of fuel waste and
pollutant emissions per mile. In
fact, "the vast mjgority of pollu
tants are released before the car
even gets on the road," according
to Reuyle.
Excess emissions result from
the engine and the catalytic con
verter being cold when the car is
started, and persist until the car
"warms up" several miles into the
trip.
These problems don't occur in
the hybrid vehicle because the
battery automatically pre-heats
the catalytic converter while the
car is still running on electricity,
before the engine is used.
In addition, conventional cars
continue to bum fuel and emit
exhaust when idling in traffic,
while cars running on electricity
only burn fuel when in motion.
Reduced emissions and
decreased dependence on gasoline
are definite environmental advan
tages of the hybrid car; however,
possible expansion of nuclear
facilities to meet increased
demand for electricity is trouble
some.
Would we just be exchanging
one kind of hazard (air pollutants)
for another (nuclear waste and
the danger of radiation)?
A solution to this problem lies
in the harnassing of solar energy
to charge batteries — technology
which will become increasingly
feasible over the next few years.
