# Being smart and eating smart don't always go together
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Given that college students are
some of the most educated people
in society, it comes as something
of a surprise that they know so lit
tle about how to maintain their
health.
Otherwise intelligent people
think exercise is watching Mon
day Night Football while downing
a six-pack, becoming anorexic try
ing to lose weight and eat fatty,
nutrition-free foods like they're
going out of style.
If you follow this space care
fully over the next several
months, you will be presented
with useful health-related infor
mation. Some of it will be pre
scriptive and some of it will be
pedantic — there are certain abso
lutes in health maintenance that
are not open to argument.
Overall, though, you will see
suggestions for improving your
physical well-being that recom
mend marginal changes.

If you are a McDonald's-loving
couch potato, it is unlikely you
will suddenly become a vegetarian
triathlete. Instead of offering that
alternative, Health Tips will sug
gest that you pass up the special
sauce on your Big Mac — it adds
about 35 percent more fat.
To get you started on your road
to better health and long life,
Health Tips offers the following
myths and the truth behind them.
(Myth-debunking will appear in
this space often because the most
common problem with health
knowledge is not lack of informa
tion, but downright wrong infor
mation.)
Myth: Counting calories is a
useful tool in helping you lose
weight.
F<ict: Actually, counting calo
ries is a useful tool in helping you
practice adding three-digit num
bers — a trick most of us mas
tered in grade school.
The number of calories you
consume is not nearly as impor
tant as the kind of calories you

consume. A 1,600-calorie day
filled with spaghetti, whole wheat
bread, fruit and some nonfat
yogurt will not cause you to gain
weight. A 1,200-calorie festival
composed of the aforementioned
Big Mac, some french fries and a
twinkie will help you complete
your Freshman 15. (Or sopho
more, junior or senior 15 for that
matter.)
If you're a quantitative person
by nature, like an engineer or econ
mtyor, count the amount of fat
you consume instead. Many food
labels list the number of fat grams
in a serving. Males are advised to

consume between 30 and 60
grams of fat per day, females
between 40 and 80.
Try counting for a couple of
days (admittedly, this is a nearly
impossible task if you are on Uni
versity Food Service) and you may
be shocked by the amount you
exceed the guidelines.
Myth: Starvation dieting —
where you drastically cut back
your food intake — is a good
means for bringing your body
weight down in the long run.
Fact: No.
Eating a lot less will certainly
cause you to get slimmer, and it
works more quickly than any
other method. It also almost guar
antees you will put the weight
back on.
Starvation dieting, you see, is
not a sustainable way of life; to
avoid malnutrition and other
health hazards, you must eventu
ally return to normal eating.
When you do, your body, which
thought it was dying during the
starvation period, will quickly

store away the new food as fat.
The only way to trim down for
life is to lose your excess poundage
slowly over time and then change
your habits so you can sustain the
weight loss forever.
That method, which will be
discussed in future columns, will
make you thin, healthy and happy.
It will also help you avoid the last
myth for today ...
Myth: Thin and healthy are
the same thing. Low body weight
is an unimpeachable measure of
good health.
Fact: People with eating disor
ders tend to become dangerously
thin if they are not treated. They
also have remarkably high body
fat percentages. If you want to
lose weight, you not only need to
exercise, you also must eat a bal
anced diet, or your body will burn
muscle tissue, not fat, for fuel.
Barry Sanders, the Detroit
Lions running back, is not thin.
He stands 5-foot-8 and weighs 180
pounds. But he's in excellent
shape. Food for thought, eh?

will suddenly become a vegetarian
triathlete. Instead of offering that
alternative, Health Tips will sug
gest that you pass up the special
sauce on your Big Mac — it adds
about 35 percent more fat.
To get you started on your road
to better health and long life,
Health Tips offers the following
myths and the truth behind them.
(Myth-debunking will appear in
this space often because the most
common problem with health
knowledge is not lack of informa
tion, but downright wrong infor
mation.)
Myth: Counting calories is a
useful tool in helping you lose
weight.
F<ict: Actually, counting calo
ries is a useful tool in helping you
practice adding three-digit num
bers — a trick most of us mas
tered in grade school.
The number of calories you
consume is not nearly as impor
tant as the kind of calories you

consume. A 1,600-calorie day
filled with spaghetti, whole wheat
bread, fruit and some nonfat
yogurt will not cause you to gain
weight. A 1,200-calorie festival
composed of the aforementioned
Big Mac, some french fries and a
twinkie will help you complete
your Freshman 15. (Or sopho
more, junior or senior 15 for that
matter.)
If you're a quantitative person
by nature, like an engineer or econ
mtyor, count the amount of fat
you consume instead. Many food
labels list the number of fat grams
in a serving. Males are advised to

consume between 30 and 60
grams of fat per day, females
between 40 and 80.
Try counting for a couple of
days (admittedly, this is a nearly
impossible task if you are on Uni
versity Food Service) and you may
be shocked by the amount you
exceed the guidelines.
Myth: Starvation dieting —
where you drastically cut back
your food intake — is a good
means for bringing your body
weight down in the long run.
Fact: No.
Eating a lot less will certainly
cause you to get slimmer, and it
works more quickly than any
other method. It also almost guar
antees you will put the weight
back on.
Starvation dieting, you see, is
not a sustainable way of life; to
avoid malnutrition and other
health hazards, you must eventu
ally return to normal eating.
When you do, your body, which
thought it was dying during the
starvation period, will quickly

store away the new food as fat.
The only way to trim down for
life is to lose your excess poundage
slowly over time and then change
your habits so you can sustain the
weight loss forever.
That method, which will be
discussed in future columns, will
make you thin, healthy and happy.
It will also help you avoid the last
myth for today ...
Myth: Thin and healthy are
the same thing. Low body weight
is an unimpeachable measure of
good health.
Fact: People with eating disor
ders tend to become dangerously
thin if they are not treated. They
also have remarkably high body
fat percentages. If you want to
lose weight, you not only need to
exercise, you also must eat a bal
anced diet, or your body will burn
muscle tissue, not fat, for fuel.
Barry Sanders, the Detroit
Lions running back, is not thin.
He stands 5-foot-8 and weighs 180
pounds. But he's in excellent
shape. Food for thought, eh?
