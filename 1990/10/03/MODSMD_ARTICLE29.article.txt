## 'Curse of the Jennifers' finally broken by Bloomer 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Some people may be superstitious
about black cats, breaking mirrors or
walking under ladders, but on the Stan
ford women's soccer team, there is no
avoiding the "Curse of Jen."
This vicious affliction has plagued
Stanford coach Berhane Andeberhan's
teams for years, and has reached an
acute level this season. There is no way
around it: if your name is Jennifer, you
will have a knee injury.
Nobody knows why 1990 has brought
such a severe case of the Jen Curse. Is it
the Centennial? Global warming? Sad
dam Hussein? But Andeberhan might
even consult Nancy Reagan's astrologist
to see if he could beat the curse.
Four Jens on the Cardinal team have
been out of action or recovering while
wearing the Jen trademark: a knee
brace. Seniors Jennifer Rowland and
Jen Bloomer are recovering from last
season's knee injuries. Freshman Jen
Gardiner ushered in the next generation
of injured Jens at the beginning of the
season.
Sophomore midfielder Jen Potok was
the latest victim, damaging her anterior
cruciate last week in a win over UCLA.
She is scheduled for surgery Friday.
Frustratingly, it was her second season
ending ir\jury in as many years.
But heading into today's game with
California, Stanford has hope that the
Curse may be broken. Jen Bloomer,
nearly a year after a severe injury dam
aged the anterior cruciate in her left
knee, is symbolically taking off her
brace to lead the Cardinal into battle.
Even though she is more commonly
known as "Bloomer," because of the
excessive number of Jens on the team,
she hasn't been able to escape the curse
of her name.
In further exciting superstitious
themes, Bloomer was injured on Friday,
Oct. 13th, 1989, the day before Stanford
played California to a 0-0 tie. So it is
only fitting that she shed the bionic
image and return braceless for today's
3:30 game at Maloney Field against the
No. 16 Golden Bears.

"It feels good," said Bloomer, who
says she is back to 100-percent. "The
doctor left it to my discretion and I
decided to take it off. It's a good feeling.
Basically, the thing just didn't fit."
Bloomer had surgery on Nov. 2, then
additional arthroscopic work four
months later. After extensive rehabilita
tion she was able to run again and then
return to the soccer field.
"When I got the surgery, I never
thought about how long nine months
can be," she said.
"I had no problems going back in and
being aggressive — making slide tackles
and stuff — but it took a while to get
back into soccer mentally. Now I'm just
playing hard to try and get my touch
and speed back."
Andeberhan is glad to have Bloomer
back at full strength and hopes her
return to health will help Stanford beat
the Jen rap. "It's great; it's exciting,"
Andeberhan said. "If something will
drive me out of coaching, it will either be
the injuries or the paper work. I'm con
tinuously pained by all the injuries. It's
great to see these players coming back."
Bloomer, a 5-6 midfielder from Min
netonka, Minn., has moved from outside
halfback to inside halfback where she
has more of a play-making role. In 1989
she had two goals and three assists
before being iiyured.
"She's already playing a role
for us and we rely on her a lot," Ande
berhan said.
The team demographics have altered
since Bloomer started at Stanford. Only
four of the 12 freshmen who were on the
team her first year are still on the team,
and Andeberhan has U-turned the pro
gram from a sub-.500 club to a national
power.
"The team is a lot closer now and it
has changed a lot," she said. "The play
ers are more committed and the skill
level goes up every year. But we're still
as silly as ever."
Bloomer doesn't start for the 7-2
Cardinal, but her injury has changed
her perspective about soccer. "I was just
so happy to be playing soccer again —
I'm glad I don't have to wear that brace
anymore — and it makes me more

appreciative."
The injury also gave the Interna
tional Relations mEyor some time off
from soccer. She plans to attend medical
school and study marine biology on Aus
tralia's Great Barrier Reef. But now her
concentration has returned to soccer.
"We have a lot of midfielders and my
role has been supporting off the bench,"
she said. "Our team goal is to make the
playoffs and I think we have the talent.
"This game is extremely important to
our playoff hopes," said Andeberhan,
whose team lost 2-1 to No. 1 Santa Clara
on Saturday. "Cal was one of the domi
nant teams of the West Coast for many
years. Last year we considered it an
upset when we tied them, but we're at
least on even terms with them now."
"They have a lot of talent, but they
are a young team," said Andeberhan. "If
we execute well and play as well as [we
did] against Santa Clara, we should be
in good shape."
"They're ranked below us," echoed
Bloomer. "We just have to play our own
game."
Bloomer is excited about the
prospects for playing in the NCAA Tour
nament for the first time. And although
it looks like the Jen Curse is behind her,
Andeberhan has his fingers and toes
crossed and would prefer that you just
call her Bloomer.
Card notes
California graduated many of its top play
ers from a year ago, but has an aggressive
young crop that has already defeated Central
Florida and Hartford this year, and led Santa
Clara 1-0 before losing 2-1 last week.
Striker Erica Hinton directs a physical
lineup, while midfielder Valerie Pope is the
other top threat.
The Cardinal will be without the services
of junior fullback Michele Sullivan for
today's game. Sullivan, who is also on the
cycling team, aggravated her back in practice
and is scheduled for a MRI exam Thursday.
She will probably be replaced by freshman
Glynnis Roberts.
Stanford will host the Stanford-Security
Pacific Invitational this weekend. The Cardi
nal will face Texas Christian and George
Mason.

"They have a lot of talent, but they
are a young team," said Andeberhan. "If
we execute well and play as well as [we
did] against Santa Clara, we should be
in good shape."
"They're ranked below us," echoed
Bloomer. "We just have to play our own
game."
Bloomer is excited about the
prospects for playing in the NCAA Tour
nament for the first time. And although
it looks like the Jen Curse is behind her,
Andeberhan has his fingers and toes
crossed and would prefer that you just
call her Bloomer.

California graduated many of its top play

young crop that has already defeated Central
Florida and Hartford this year, and led Santa
Clara 1-0 before losing 2-1 last week.
Striker Erica Hinton directs a physical
lineup, while midfielder Valerie Pope is the
other top threat.
The Cardinal will be without the services
of junior fullback Michele Sullivan for
today's game. Sullivan, who is also on the
cycling team, aggravated her back in practice
and is scheduled for a MRI exam Thursday.
She will probably be replaced by freshman
Glynnis Roberts.
Stanford will host the Stanford-Security

Jen Bloomer is now the first of four Jens on the women's soccer team to remove her
knee brace. She hopes to contribute to the Cardinal effort against No. 16 California at
Maloney Field this afternoon.
Some people may be superstitious
about black cats, breaking mirrors or
walking under ladders, but on the Stan
ford women's soccer team, there is no
avoiding the "Curse of Jen."
This vicious affliction has plagued
Stanford coach Berhane Andeberhan's
teams for years, and has reached an
acute level this season. There is no way
around it: if your name is Jennifer, you
will have a knee injury.
Nobody knows why 1990 has brought
such a severe case of the Jen Curse. Is it
the Centennial? Global warming? Sad
dam Hussein? But Andeberhan might
even consult Nancy Reagan's astrologist
to see if he could beat the curse.
Four Jens on the Cardinal team have
been out of action or recovering while
wearing the Jen trademark: a knee
brace. Seniors Jennifer Rowland and
Jen Bloomer are recovering from last
season's knee injuries. Freshman Jen
Gardiner ushered in the next generation
of injured Jens at the beginning of the
season.
Sophomore midfielder Jen Potok was
the latest victim, damaging her anterior
cruciate last week in a win over UCLA.
She is scheduled for surgery Friday.
Frustratingly, it was her second season
ending ir\jury in as many years.
But heading into today's game with
California, Stanford has hope that the
Curse may be broken. Jen Bloomer,
nearly a year after a severe injury dam
aged the anterior cruciate in her left
knee, is symbolically taking off her
brace to lead the Cardinal into battle.
Even though she is more commonly
known as "Bloomer," because of the
excessive number of Jens on the team,
she hasn't been able to escape the curse
of her name.
In further exciting superstitious
themes, Bloomer was injured on Friday,
Oct. 13th, 1989, the day before Stanford
played California to a 0-0 tie. So it is
only fitting that she shed the bionic
image and return braceless for today's
3:30 game at Maloney Field against the
No. 16 Golden Bears.

"It feels good," said Bloomer, who
says she is back to 100-percent. "The
doctor left it to my discretion and I
decided to take it off. It's a good feeling.
Basically, the thing just didn't fit."
Bloomer had surgery on Nov. 2, then
additional arthroscopic work four
months later. After extensive rehabilita
tion she was able to run again and then
return to the soccer field.
"When I got the surgery, I never
thought about how long nine months
can be," she said.
"I had no problems going back in and
being aggressive — making slide tackles
and stuff — but it took a while to get
back into soccer mentally. Now I'm just
playing hard to try and get my touch
and speed back."
Andeberhan is glad to have Bloomer
back at full strength and hopes her
return to health will help Stanford beat
the Jen rap. "It's great; it's exciting,"
Andeberhan said. "If something will
drive me out of coaching, it will either be
the injuries or the paper work. I'm con
tinuously pained by all the injuries. It's
great to see these players coming back."
Bloomer, a 5-6 midfielder from Min
netonka, Minn., has moved from outside
halfback to inside halfback where she
has more of a play-making role. In 1989
she had two goals and three assists
before being iiyured.
"She's already playing a role
for us and we rely on her a lot," Ande
berhan said.
The team demographics have altered
since Bloomer started at Stanford. Only
four of the 12 freshmen who were on the
team her first year are still on the team,
and Andeberhan has U-turned the pro
gram from a sub-.500 club to a national
power.
"The team is a lot closer now and it
has changed a lot," she said. "The play
ers are more committed and the skill
level goes up every year. But we're still
as silly as ever."
Bloomer doesn't start for the 7-2
Cardinal, but her injury has changed
her perspective about soccer. "I was just
so happy to be playing soccer again —
I'm glad I don't have to wear that brace
anymore — and it makes me more

appreciative."
The injury also gave the Interna
tional Relations mEyor some time off
from soccer. She plans to attend medical
school and study marine biology on Aus
tralia's Great Barrier Reef. But now her
concentration has returned to soccer.
"We have a lot of midfielders and my
role has been supporting off the bench,"
she said. "Our team goal is to make the
playoffs and I think we have the talent.
"This game is extremely important to
our playoff hopes," said Andeberhan,
whose team lost 2-1 to No. 1 Santa Clara
on Saturday. "Cal was one of the domi
nant teams of the West Coast for many
years. Last year we considered it an
upset when we tied them, but we're at
least on even terms with them now."
"They have a lot of talent, but they
are a young team," said Andeberhan. "If
we execute well and play as well as [we
did] against Santa Clara, we should be
in good shape."
"They're ranked below us," echoed
