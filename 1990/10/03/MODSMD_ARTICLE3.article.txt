# University alcohol policy specified
## Revision expressly prohibits underage drinking on campus 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Students under 21 who plan on
drinking at parties this weekend should
be aware that University policy now
expressly prohibits it.
To comply with the federal Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, Stanford
sent a certificate to the Department of
Education last Thursday verifying that
the University's policy meets the
requirements outlined by the law.
The act, which took effect Monday,
requires that universities receiving fed
eral funds prohibit the unlawful use of
alcohol and other drugs by students and
employees.
But because the law does not specify
how the new policy must be enforced,
University administrators are not yet
sure how it will affect students, faculty
and staff.
Under Stanford's new policy, "stu
dents who unlawfully distribute, possess
or use controlled substances or alcohol
in the workplace, on the campus or as
part of any University activity may be
subject to discipline up to and including
expulsion."

Employees committing such viola
tions "jhall be subject to discipline up to
and including discharge from employ
ment," according to the policy.
Although the new policy is in effect,
University Counsel Susan Hoerger said
decisions on how to implement and

enforce it have not been made.
Hoerger said the new policy does not
eliminate Stanford's previous alcohol
policy, which held that individuals are
responsible for their own actions. How-
