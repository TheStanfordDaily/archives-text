# University alcohol policy specified
## Revision expressly prohibits underage drinking on campus 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Students under 21 who plan on
drinking at parties this weekend should
be aware that University policy now
expressly prohibits it.
To comply with the federal Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, Stanford
sent a certificate to the Department of
Education last Thursday verifying that
the University's policy meets the
requirements outlined by the law.
The act, which took effect Monday,
requires that universities receiving fed
eral funds prohibit the unlawful use of
alcohol and other drugs by students and
employees.
But because the law does not specify
how the new policy must be enforced,
University administrators are not yet
sure how it will affect students, faculty
and staff.
Under Stanford's new policy, "stu
dents who unlawfully distribute, possess
or use controlled substances or alcohol
in the workplace, on the campus or as
part of any University activity may be
subject to discipline up to and including
expulsion."

Employees committing such viola
tions "jhall be subject to discipline up to
and including discharge from employ
ment," according to the policy.
Although the new policy is in effect,
University Counsel Susan Hoerger said
decisions on how to implement and

enforce it have not been made.
Hoerger said the new policy does not
eliminate Stanford's previous alcohol
policy, which held that individuals are
responsible for their own actions. How-

ever, the new policy must super
sede the old because it is required
by federal law.
As for enforcement, she said
the University will not take any
immediate action different from
its past actions, "but it has always
been the policy of the University
for students to know the law and
take individual responsibility."
Acting Director of Residential
Education Robin Hensley said
resident assistants and resident
fellows "have not been given a

whole new specific set of rules"
for responding to the policy.
Instead, Hensley said adminis
trators are waiting until they hold
discussions with residence staff
and students to work out joint
solutions.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said no final
decisions will be made without
help and input from students,
residence staff and other mem
bers of the Stanford community.
"We are telling RAs and RFs to
continue to proceed as they did
before the new regulations,"
Hensley said, adding that she
hopes they continue to "create an

environment where the commu
nity cares for each other" regard
ing alcohol abuse.
Several administrators said
the decision to comply with the
new policy rests with the students
themselves.
"Students should use their
best judgment as to how they
should handle themselves," Jack
son said. "Individual responsibil
ity has always been the key in our
community."
Hoerger said the new policy
"calls for heightened awareness
of individual responsibility to
obey the law."
Jackson said the new law also

applies to those serving alcohol.
"We hope that groups hosting
[parties] take extra precautions
that students under 21 not be
served," he said.
Administrators will meet
Monday to discuss potential
implications of the new policy on
residential life and to brainstorm
ways to implement and enforce it.
Officials will then meet with
RAs, RFs and residence deans
Oct. 18 to present their ideas and
seek input from the residential
staff.
Administrators have invited
dorm officers, ASSU officers and
student organization leaders to

meet with them Oct. 23 and voice
their concerns and suggestions.
"The challenge we now face is
finding ways to comply with the
new federal regulations while pre
serving the best elements of the
relationship between students
and the University," acting Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son wrote in an Oct. 1 letter to
residence and campus affairs
staffs, the ASSU and various stu
dent leaders.
Hensley added, "We hope to
