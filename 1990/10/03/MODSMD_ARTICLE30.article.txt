# Something noble down on the Farm: the student-athlete
## 
### 
Please don't laugh (my ego bruises
easily), but the summer before my
freshman year I thought about
playing varsity baseball here at Stanford.
So what if, due to extreme personality
conflicts, I never actually got around to
playing for my high school team? Never
mind the fact that my most notable
attribute in Little League was a micro
scopic strike zone (I was 4-foot-2 until my
junior year of high school). I loved the
game, and could handle a glove fairly well.
Why not play in college?
OK, you can laugh a bit.
The problem was not me; it was the
tiny little detail that the Cardinal were
the defending NCAA champions. That
and the fact that most everybody on the
roster had turned down six-figure signing
bonuses with the pros to play here. I, on
the other hand, was not exactly heavily
recruited.
Sure, it's great to go to an academic
minded school that also happens to have
the best athletics program in the country,
but it leaves many of us would-be athletes
out in the cold. Intramurals just aren't
the same â€” and they don't have a hard
ball league, either.
Admittedly, I really have no business
wanting to play college baseball. But what
about a frosh dormmate of mine who
came here after hitting better than .450
his senior year in high school, was a two
time all-conference performer, and was
also his class valedictorian? He played on
the JV team his freshman year, saw that

although he was sacrificing his school
work and free time he was never going to
get much action at the varsity level, and
decided it would be better to quit.
Sometimes I wonder about college ath
letics. Growing up, the Washington
Huskies were my heroes. These guys were
not college students, they were 300-
pound superstars and Greek gods. I lived
and died with the team's fortunes, and
had I played football I would have proba
bly dreamed of being a Husky.
However, as I have grown up, I have
learned that many college athletes aren't
students. Literally. Often they are people
who would not be in college were it not for
their football or basketball ability,
because they are not interested in getting
an education. Even those that are stu
dents cannot devote enough time to their
studies because of the demands of their
sport.
In general, this is not as true at Stan
ford as it is in many schools. I did not
apply to Notre Dame for college because it

was known as strictly a "jock school." But
even these ivory towers cannot escape the
pressures of alumni to have a winning
football team. It is a struggle between
those that want to ensure that Stanford
competitors are true student-athletes
(student comes first), and those that
wouldn't mind if the admissions office
made just a few exceptions for that All-
World tailback with the not-so-All-World
grades.
But can Stanford remain on this
precipice, with the chasms of athletic
mediocrity on one side and anything-for
a-win zeal on the other? Consider that
Stanford is an Ivy League-type institu
tion with a state school-type athletic pro
gram. It is a unique classification, and
one that should be on every endangered
species list.
Recently, as I returned from a trip to
Oregon, I happened to tune in to a radio
station emanating from the Stardust
Hotel in Las Vegas. I listened for over an
hour as three men who sounded like griz
zled gamblers with revolvers tucked in
their belts handicapped this weekend's
college football schedule. It brought home
to me, better than anything else probably
could, how much of a multi-million dollar
operation college sports actually is.
I found one of these gamblers/college
sports buffs' comments strangely insight
ful. The host asked him who he would bet
on in an Ivy League game between
Princeton and Brown. He declined to

"play" the game, and with a note of
ridicule in his voice gave this explanation:
"Those Ivies are hard to figure. I think
half the time it all depends on whether or
not the school had exams that week
(laughs)."
Hmmm.
Last Saturday, the Cardinal football
team suffered a crucial loss to San Jose
State, primarily because they couldn't
stop Spartan quarterback Ralph Martini.
Martini's first choice for college was Stan
ford, but he was not admitted.
On that same Saturday, a few hours
before the football game, the Cardinal
women's soccer team suffered a 2-1 loss
to the No. 1-ranked Santa Clara Broncos.
Even before the game, however, Stanford
coach Berhane Andeberhan commented
on the Broncos, "Their roster is full of my
recruits who didn't get into Stanford."
This is as it should be. I would much
rather that the Cardinal had won both
these games, but not at the expense of the
educational environment. If the football
team never has a winning season in my
four years here, and the odds on that look

very good at the moment, I really can't
say that I'm shocked or irritated. When
you play in the Pacific 10 conference and
then schedule Notre Dame and Colorado
for non-league games, what can you really
expect? But at least Stanford has a team
of student-athletes that represents the
University well, which is more than you
can say for Miami or Oklahoma.
If you're still grumbling, remember
that when college sports began here a
century ago, it was not about mega-con
ferences and TV money and win-at-all
costs attitudes. There were no athletic
scholarships. It was simply, "Hey, you in
the blue-and-gold! We think that the stu
dents at our college can play a better
game of (football, baseball, basketball)
than your students can."
As much as I love big-time college
sports, I can't help but wish sometimes
that it was still that way. At least then,
maybe, I could play baseball.
