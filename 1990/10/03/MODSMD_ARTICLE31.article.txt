# Cardinal faces Irish as well as mystique
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The good news is Stanford football's
upcoming opponent likes to run the ball, and
the Cardinal has shown that it is adept at stop
ping an opponent's ground attack.
Unfortunately, the opponent is Notre
Dame.
It takes more than just good linebackers, or
even a talented team, to beat the Fighting
Irish in South Bend. Forget the fact that they
are undefeated. Forget the fact that they are
ranked No. 1.
Notre Dame is college football.
There's something about just standing
across the line of scrimmage from the Fighting
Irish, not to mention playing under the aus
pices of Touchdown Jesus, that gives oppo
nents the shivers.
The Cardinal is no exception.
"Notre Dame is a great school with a lot of
tradition," comerback Kevin Scott said. "Just
their name rings a bell for everybody, even if
they're not ranked. Just in terms of the
national championships [they've wonl and
their tradition, it's amazing for any football
player.
"I was really in awe [two years agol. It's a
wild crowd — just roaming around the field I
knew that it was a place that is not too wel
coming."
The entire Cardinal was in awe actually,
and never quite snapped out of it, falling to the

eventual national champions 42-14.
This time around, Scott and the other vet
erans are hoping their experience will aid the
first-time South Benders. The fact that Stan
ford led until the fourth quarter last year—
the Irish pulled out a 21-17 victory — doesn't
hurt either.
"I'm expecting them to be in awe a little bit,
but after the first play starts it should be like
any other game.
"You can't fully prepare them, but a lot of
guys went to Colorado, and they got a little bit
of it there. They weren't the nicest crowd,"
said Scott.
But crowd or no crowd, Stanford still has to
stop Lou Holtz's Irish. Who haven't lost at
home since 1986.
And even though Notre Dame is an I-forma
tion running team, Stanford is going to have
its challange of the season.
The Cardinal has proven it can shut down
opponents' ground games. Stanford's defense
held San Jose State's Ail-American candidate
Sheldon Canley to 46 yards and the entire
Spartan squad to 59 yards, UCLA's Tommy
Maddox to a net of 26 and Colorado's Heis
man candidate Eric Bieniemy to 28 yards dur
ing the first half.
But once a team's running backs are halted,
it usually takes to the air. And gives Stanford
problems.
The Cardinal has just not been able to
establish a pass rush, or interrupt opposing
receivers. Opponents are averaging 235 pass

ing yards a game.
"The team feels it's been playing some
pretty good run defense. It's held some of the
best runners in the country," coach Dennis
Green said. "[But] we've been really disap
pointed with how we're playing the pass rush.
We have the talent — I thought it would be the
strength of our attack."
"We're not playing how we should be play
ing. We're giving up too many big plays and let
ting them complete third downs. No one felt
too good about the way we played [last week],"
Scott said.
"They think they can get a lot done against
us. Every game we've stopped the running
game but [the opponent has] been successful
passing. They have in their minds if something
happens, we're confident we can go to the air
and accomplish something," Scott said.
Stanford is hoping the return of right tackle
Tyler Batson, inside linebacker Dave Gamett,
and nose guard Frank Busalacchi from
injuries — and using Darrien Gordon in place
of Albert Richardson at right corner — will
help dispel this image.
Green also is planning on playing combina
tions that the squad has shown it can execute,
and is emphasizing the importance of mentally
staying with the game plan.
He's also hoping four games of experience
will prove valuable.
Something is better than nothing.
Especially when the opponent is Notre
Dame.
