RBI single in the 11th inning.
The Boston loss, which came
about one hour after Toronto

Red Sox one game ahead of the
Blue Jays with one game left
in the regular season.

and took second on Robin Ven

into right field and Karkovice
just beat Kevin Romine's throw
to catcher Tony Pena.

Wayne Edwards, Chicago's
fourth pitcher, pitched the 11th
for his second save. Romine
singled with two out but Pena
forced Romine to end the game.
The Red Sox tied the score
2-2 in the bottom of the eighth
just after the scoreboard
showed that Toronto beat Bal
timore on Fred McGriff's
ninth-inning homer.
Tom Brunansky led off the
inning with a double, just the
fourth hit off Chicago starter
Melido Perez. JefT Stone ran
for Brunansky and Bobby
Thigpen relieved Perez. Pena
sacrificed Stone to third and
Danny Heep — hitting. 174 —
pinch hit for Luis Rivera and
hit a sacrifice fly to score
Stone.
* The White Sox took a 1-0
lead in the first inning with
the help of a balk by Tom Bol
ton. With one out, Lance
Johnson extended his hitting
streak to 13 games with a
single and Carlton Fisk walked.
The runners advanced on Bol
ton's balk and Frank Thomas
hit a sacrifice fly.
