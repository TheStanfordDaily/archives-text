# Students found new Jewish social club
## 
### Kaarin Michaelsen Staff writer 
Growing discontent among
some Jewish undergraduates
over social opportunities at
Hillel, a Jewish student organi
zation, led to the founding
Monday of a new social club for
Jewish students.
About 30 students attended
the first meeting of the club,
which is aimed at expanding
social opportunities for under
graduate Jewish students. The
club has not yet been named.
"A lot of us have been feel
ing that Hillel provides a lot of
social activities for graduate
students, but not enough for
undergrads, and we wanted to
fix that," said senior Bonnie
Rosenberg, a founding mem
ber of the club.
"We sire not trying to com
pete with Hillel at all," Rosen
berg noted. "Actually, we hope
to work with them to help
improve an area that we think
has been neglected."
The success of this year's
Jewish Student Orientation
Committee, which was an offi
cial part of Orientation for the
first time this fall, also con
tributed to the decision to form
the new group. The committee

succeeded in getting more new
students involved in Hillel
activities than in the past three
years.
"The committee did a great
job in getting a lot of new stu
dents involved with Hillel, and
now that Orientation is over,
we don't want to lose them,"
said senior Joe Dobrin, a mem
ber of the new group. "It seems
like the opportune time to
start up a new group that will
help create some continuity
between Orientation and the
rest of the year," he added.
Social clubs for Jewish stu
dents can be found on cam
puses throughout the country,
but "as far as we know, there
has never been a club like this
before at Stanford," said
sophomore member Alison
Alter.
The newly formed club "will
have a strictly social basis,"
Dobrin said. "I do not see it
serving a political function like
the [Black Student Union] or
[Asian American Student
Association] do. We have Hillel
for that."
Alter also mentioned the
club's social basis, but said "it
could eventually branch out
into something more than
that."
