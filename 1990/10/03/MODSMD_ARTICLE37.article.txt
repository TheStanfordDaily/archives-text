# Libraries receive Steinbeck letter collection
## 
### Sarah Morisseau 
Stanford Libraries recently acquired a set
of letters between John Steinbeck and Jules
Buck, his close friend and collaborator on the
film "Viva Zapata!" adding to its already large
collection of Steinbeck memorabilia.
The collection consists of 30 letters from
"J.S." to "Jules," 14 carbons of letters to Stein
beck from Buck and several inter-office mem
oranda.
Spotted with occasional information about
the film, the letters are mostly chatty notes
discussing promises of Steinbeck's famously
delicious coffee, a barbecue and complaints
about each other's handwriting. There is even
a brief postscript suggesting Marlon Brando
for the role of Zapata.
Steinbeck, who flunked Freshman English
at Stanford, developed several close friend

ships during his few years here, said Margaret
Kimball, chief of Stanford Libraries' Special
Collections and University Archives. The
Steinbeck collection has been supported by
some of these friends, she noted.
Steinbeck never graduated from Stanford.
Buck, who was assistant to the film's pro
ducer, Darryl Zanuck, came to California in
1949 to work on the film with Steinbeck. The
movie was not actually produced until 1951.
Although the film never received much pro
motion or exposure, it is frequently studied for
its sensitive treatment of political problems
and leadership.
The letters, which date from 1949 to 1954,
are part of an extensive Steinbeck collection
housed in Green Library's Special Collections.
Like all of Stanford's collections, they are
available to anyone interested.
The collection contains many related items,

including the 1949 film script by Steinbeck
and Buck, the 1951 final script by Steinbeck
and eight "Viva Zapata!" lobby cards.
The collection also includes such rarities as
the original draft of "Cannery Row," penciled
on legal paper in Steinbeck's usual sloppy,
anti-margin scrawl, along with galley proofs
annotated in Steinbeck's hand, a proof copy
and a first edition of the book.
"I highly doubt that our collection is the
largest... but people come from Japan, from
England, from everywhere to research here. It
is very exciting to have people say, 'This is just
what I've been looking for,'" Kimball said.
Made possible by the Felton Fund, a private
foundation, the latest acquisition was pur
chased for an undisclosed price through a
dealer "who most probably bought it from
another dealer," Kimball said.
