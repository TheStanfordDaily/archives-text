### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
The Stanford Center for the
Study of Families, Children and
Youth is beginning the first aca
demic study of homeless families
and youth in the suburban Penin
sula area.
Melissa Beacham, the center's
community relations coordinator,
described the project as "unique,"
because in addition to researching
homeless families, the research
team will study families at risk of
becoming homeless.
Since suburban homelessness

is a relatively new problem, "peo
ple do not realize that there are
homeless families right here in
Silicon Valley and around Stan
ford," said Beacham, a 1988 Stan
ford graduate in history.
The center will conduct about
1,000 interviews over the next
year with families and individual
children in shelters and on the
street. Beacham and the research
staff are developing question
naires they will test on small
groups of homeless people before
interviewing on a larger scale.
The "Help House the Home
less" Coalition of Santa Clara

County developed the idea for the
research project last May, and
Georgia Travis, the 83-year-old
director of the group's committee
on children, urged the Stanford
center to focus its research on
homeless families.
The center is working in con
junction with a public policy advi
sory board representing Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties.
The results of the research and
analysis of homeless families and
youth will be presented to the
advisory board in fall 1991. The
study is mainly funded by the Wal
ter S. Johnson Foundation.

Five Stanford faculty members
have committed their time to the
one-year project and may receive
additional grants for pilot projects
based on their research.
Four of the five are professors
— Human Biology and Sociology
Prof. Sanford Dornbusch, the cen
ter's director; Psychiatry Prof.
Emeritus E Herbert Leiderman;
Pediatrics Prof. Iris Litt, coordi
nator of the Institute for Research
on Women and (render; and Asst.
Psychiatry Prof. Hans Steiner.
Marilyn Winkleby of the Center
for Research on Disease Preven
tion is also participating.
