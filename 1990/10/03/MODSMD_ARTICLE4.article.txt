# Registrar's office to be computerized
##

When students arrive on campus
next fall, a new computer system may
spare them from having to stand in long
lines at the Registrar's office.
In fact, students may not even have
to leave their dorms to file their study
lists or update their addresses.
The new network will link the com
puters of the Registrar's office with
dorm computer clusters and other com
puters throughout campus.
Once the system is in place, students
will be able to:
• submit study lists
• drop and add classes
• change pass/no credit status
• make privacy requests
• declare majors

• receive course and grade listings
• register commencement atten
dance information
• apply to graduate
• request official transcripts and
• update address lists.
Although Stanford must pay for
start-up costs, the University should
save a considerable amount of money in
the long run, according to Acting Uni
versity Registrar Jack Farrell.
The change to a computerized sys
tem will eliminate some staff jobs, such
as key punching and alphabetizing, but
attrition and reorganization of the
department will probably make layoffs
unnecessary, he said.
The Network for Student Informa
tion will handle the logistics of the tran
sition to the on-line service. Plans for

the system are progressing steadily, but
some decisions have not yet been
made, according to network program
ming manager Tim Flood.
"We are uncertain of a lot of the tech
nical aspects right now," Flood said.
"I am pretty sure Macintoshes will be
a big part of the system," Farrell said,
"but I am equally sure they will not be
the only part." An all-Macintosh system
would be difficult for graduate students
to access and would prevent non-Macin
tosh users from connecting their per
sonal computers to the network, Farrell
added.
The network's format will ultimately
be easily accessible and "user-seduc
tive," Farrell noted. A pilot program for
the on-line system is scheduled for
spring quarter.
