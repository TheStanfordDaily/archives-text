# Turmoil beneath the tranquility
## The
						real-world tragedy of suicide does not elude Stanford 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Although some consider Stan
ford an idyllic "Disneyland of the
North," three student suicides
over the summer and an
attempted suicide last week have
reminded the campus it cannot
escape the tragedies of the real
world.
"From three years of dorm liv
ing, it seems to me people here
often put forth the image that
they're always happy. But... stu
dents at Stanford, like anywhere,
have their ups and downs," said
senior Matt Paradise, a counselor
at the Bridge, the University's
peer counseling center.
Stanford appears to have a typ
ical suicide rate for a university,
according to Counseling and Psy
chological Services psychiatrist
Vincent D'Andrea. Brown Univer
sity, for example, reported three
suicides within the last year.
Merely deciding to attend col
lege bodes well for students, as

college and university students
have lower suicide rates than non
students of the same age.
The national suicide rate for
individuals aged 15 to 24 years is
19 deaths per 100,000 people each
year, but it is only 15 deaths per
100,0000 college students. Given
Stanford's student population of
about 13,000, this rate translates
into an expected average of about
two suicides per year.
Current statistical trends
about student suicides at univer
sities are difficult to establish
because they occur relatively
infrequently.
However, research has shown
that college-age men are five

For some students, the impact of cultural dif
ferences may be especially significant — and
sometimes rather disturbing — during the
transition to Stanford.

times more likely than college-age
women to commit suicide,
although women attempt to do so
more often, according to Univer
sity of Rochester psychiatrist
Allen Schwartz, a researcher of
college-age suicide. The gender
gap closes somewhat with age, he
added.
In studying nationwide trends,
researchers have also linked geo
graphic location to suicide. For
example, Pacific Coast residents
are twice as likely to commit sui
cide as their counterparts in the
Middle Atlantic states, Schwartz
said.
Proportionately, white Ameri
cans commit suicide more fre

quently than all minority groups.
Among American minority
groups, Native Americans have
the highest suicide rate, D'Andrea
said.
American suicide statistics can
not be applied to this summer's
Stanford deaths, because all three
suicides were committed by inter
national students.
While these three suicides do
not establish any definite relation
ship between cultural background
and vulnerability to suicide, they
serve as reminders of the unique
problems faced by international
students.
Cultural differences
How easily students adjust to
Stanford may be greatly influ
enced by their cultural back
ground, personality and prior
expectations, according to Marcia
Makino, assistant director of for
eign student advising at Bechtel
International Center.
