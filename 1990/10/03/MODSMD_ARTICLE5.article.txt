# Turmoil beneath the tranquility
## The 						real-world tragedy of suicide does not elude Stanford 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Although some consider Stan
ford an idyllic "Disneyland of the
North," three student suicides
over the summer and an
attempted suicide last week have
reminded the campus it cannot
escape the tragedies of the real
world.
"From three years of dorm liv
ing, it seems to me people here
often put forth the image that
they're always happy. But... stu
dents at Stanford, like anywhere,
have their ups and downs," said
senior Matt Paradise, a counselor
at the Bridge, the University's
peer counseling center.
Stanford appears to have a typ
ical suicide rate for a university,
according to Counseling and Psy
chological Services psychiatrist
Vincent D'Andrea. Brown Univer
sity, for example, reported three
suicides within the last year.
Merely deciding to attend col
lege bodes well for students, as

college and university students
have lower suicide rates than non
students of the same age.
The national suicide rate for
individuals aged 15 to 24 years is
19 deaths per 100,000 people each
year, but it is only 15 deaths per
100,0000 college students. Given
Stanford's student population of
about 13,000, this rate translates
into an expected average of about
two suicides per year.
Current statistical trends
about student suicides at univer
sities are difficult to establish
because they occur relatively
infrequently.
However, research has shown
that college-age men are five

For some students, the impact of cultural dif
ferences may be especially significant — and
sometimes rather disturbing — during the
transition to Stanford.

times more likely than college-age
women to commit suicide,
although women attempt to do so
more often, according to Univer
sity of Rochester psychiatrist
Allen Schwartz, a researcher of
college-age suicide. The gender
gap closes somewhat with age, he
added.
In studying nationwide trends,
researchers have also linked geo
graphic location to suicide. For
example, Pacific Coast residents
are twice as likely to commit sui
cide as their counterparts in the
Middle Atlantic states, Schwartz
said.
Proportionately, white Ameri
cans commit suicide more fre

quently than all minority groups.
Among American minority
groups, Native Americans have
the highest suicide rate, D'Andrea
said.
American suicide statistics can
not be applied to this summer's
Stanford deaths, because all three
suicides were committed by inter
national students.
While these three suicides do
not establish any definite relation
ship between cultural background
and vulnerability to suicide, they
serve as reminders of the unique
problems faced by international
students.
Cultural differences
How easily students adjust to
Stanford may be greatly influ
enced by their cultural back
ground, personality and prior
expectations, according to Marcia
Makino, assistant director of for
eign student advising at Bechtel
International Center.
For some students, the impact
of cultural differences may be
especially significant — and some
times rather disturbing — during
the transitional period.
Stanford's 300 undergraduate
and 1,800 graduate international
students, in particular, are very
likely to experience some level of
"culture shock" upon arrival at
Stanford, said Makino. Such a
reaction is completely normal and
often lasts about three months,
she added.
In some cases, the severity of
culture shock is closely related to
the extent of differences between
Stanford and a student's native
country.
"For those students coming in
from Canada and Western
Europe, the transition is generally
a little easier," Makino said.
But for some students from
other parts of the world — includ
ing, perhaps, the three suicide vic
tims who came to Stanford from
various Asian countries — cul
tural differences may be more
extreme.
For instance, many aspects of
Asian culture are "very different"
from Western culture, said
Makino. And these differences
may directly or indirectly affect
the emotional well-being of inter
national students.
Cultural divergence between
Asians and Americans, for exam
ple, can been seen in"the way peo
ple solve problems and seek help,"
Makino said.
CAPS psychologist Karen
Huang agreed, explaining that
some Asians may feel reluctant to
seek professional counseling due
to a traditional cultural concern
for "maintaining face," or avoid
ing situations that could bring
shame to themselves and their
families.
Consequently, some students
who are in need of assistance
"can't even avail themselves" of
the counseling opportunities pro
vided at Stanford, Makino said.
Although most university stu
dents experience a certain level of

anxiety, Huang said stress may be
more extreme for international
students.
For example, pressure for high
academic achievement can be con
siderably greater for foreign stu
dents arriving at a prestigious
university like Stanford,
explained Huang. "They are usu
ally the cream of the crop of their
native cities or villages, so they
feel they have to do really well to
meet the expectations of people
back at home," she said.
Racial discrimination may also
contribute to stress for some
Asian students. "It may be sub
tle," said Huang. She cited a hypo
thetical case of an Asian student
who isn't invited to a party
because of the stereotypical view
that "Asian people are nerds."
Counseling opportunities
The prospect of visiting CAPS
or the Bridge for help may be even
more daunting when counselors
have different cultural back
grounds than their clients.
According to Bridge counselor
Cory Booker, a senior, "There can
be a lot of mistrust for students of
color going to a white counselor.
There's a fear of being misunder
stood, and I think there's a lot of
validity to that concern."
In response to that fear, the
Bridge introduced two peer coun
seling groups last year to deal
specifically with issues facing
African-American and Asian-
American students. The Bridge
also offers a peer counseling group
for gay and lesbian students and is
planning a fourth group for inter
national students.
The number of minority coun
selors at the Bridge has also been
rising steadily, Booker noted.
According to CAPS psychologist
Douglas Daher, all "helping pro
fessionals" need to gain greater
understanding of cross-cultural
issues.
In addition, friends and family
should not hesitate to confront
the issue of suicide with those who
appear to be contemplating killing
themselves, Daher said. "You
should never underrespond; a
direct response is always appro
priate."

Huang suggested faculty aca
demic advisors could provide
greater support for troubled stu
dents, especially graduate stu
dents, by adopting more "pater
nalistic" roles like those of profes
sors in Asia, who act as "all
around mentors, almost as par
ents to their students."
Huang's concern for graduate
students seems particularly

appropriate given the results of an
informal CAPS study of 19 Stan
ford suicides between 1963 and
1978. The study indicated that
graduate students are somewhat
more likely to commit suicide
than undergraduates.
The study also found that the
suicide victims who were involved
in romantic relationships — one
third of the total — experienced

conflicts with their partners
before they killed themselves.
The feeling of social isolation
following a break-up can often be
"the last straw," D'Andrea said.
Marital status also plays a role
in suicide risk. According to a
study published in 1987 by Cor
nell University psychiatrist Ger
ald Klerman, single individuals
are more likely to commit suicide

than married people, especially if
they also suffer from a psychiatric
disorder.
Also, Klerman noted that car
riage has a greater "protective"
value for men than for women, as
marriage reduces suicide rates for
men more than for women.
Social isolation
Feelings of social isolation are
not uncommon at Stanford. For
new students, the loss of a secure
community and the relatively
large size of the University can be
overwhelming.
D'Andrea pointed out that
developing relationships here may
be more difficult as time passes.
"Social isolation is usually self
imposed in some way," he said. "If
you don't connect with people
your freshman year, it can be very
difficult to do so later."
Social isolation may have an
even more profound effect on
graduate students, who arrive on
campus without the welcoming
atmosphere of Orientation and
the opportunity to form social ties
in undergraduate dormitories.
The differences in social oppor
tunities available to undergradu
ates and graduates may con
tribute to the slightly higher per
centage of graduate students
seeking CAPS counseling,
D'Andrea said.
In addition to CAPS and the
Bridge, dormitories provide their
own resources in the form of resi
dent assistants, resident fellows
and residence deans.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Diana Conklin,
training for all three positions
includes CAPS sessions on appro
priate responses to suicide-related
gestures and events, as well as
information on referral services.
Residences might indeed be a
starting point for the sort of ideal
campus described by Huang as
"possessing a sense of community
and connectedness."
Further information and coun
seling are available at the Bridge
(723-3392) and CAPS (723-3785).
The Bridge and the Santa Clara
County Suicide and Crisis Preven
tion Service (494-8420) operate
24-hour crisis hotlines.

the extent of differences between
Stanford and a student's native
country.
"For those students coming in
from Canada and Western
Europe, the transition is generally
a little easier," Makino said.
But for some students from
other parts of the world — includ
ing, perhaps, the three suicide vic
tims who came to Stanford from
various Asian countries — cul
tural differences may be more
extreme.
For instance, many aspects of
Asian culture are "very different"
from Western culture, said
Makino. And these differences
may directly or indirectly affect
the emotional well-being of inter
national students.
Cultural divergence between
Asians and Americans, for exam
ple, can been seen in"the way peo
ple solve problems and seek help,"
Makino said.
CAPS psychologist Karen
Huang agreed, explaining that
some Asians may feel reluctant to
seek professional counseling due
to a traditional cultural concern
for "maintaining face," or avoid
ing situations that could bring
shame to themselves and their
families.
Consequently, some students
who are in need of assistance
"can't even avail themselves" of
the counseling opportunities pro
vided at Stanford, Makino said.
Although most university stu
dents experience a certain level of

anxiety, Huang said stress may be
more extreme for international
students.
For example, pressure for high
academic achievement can be con
siderably greater for foreign stu
dents arriving at a prestigious
university like Stanford,
explained Huang. "They are usu
ally the cream of the crop of their
native cities or villages, so they
feel they have to do really well to
meet the expectations of people
back at home," she said.
Racial discrimination may also
contribute to stress for some
Asian students. "It may be sub
tle," said Huang. She cited a hypo
thetical case of an Asian student
who isn't invited to a party
because of the stereotypical view
that "Asian people are nerds."
Counseling opportunities
The prospect of visiting CAPS
or the Bridge for help may be even
more daunting when counselors
have different cultural back
grounds than their clients.
According to Bridge counselor
Cory Booker, a senior, "There can
be a lot of mistrust for students of
color going to a white counselor.
There's a fear of being misunder
stood, and I think there's a lot of
validity to that concern."
In response to that fear, the
Bridge introduced two peer coun
seling groups last year to deal
specifically with issues facing
African-American and Asian-
American students. The Bridge
also offers a peer counseling group
for gay and lesbian students and is
planning a fourth group for inter
national students.
The number of minority coun
selors at the Bridge has also been
rising steadily, Booker noted.
According to CAPS psychologist
Douglas Daher, all "helping pro
fessionals" need to gain greater
understanding of cross-cultural
issues.
In addition, friends and family
should not hesitate to confront
the issue of suicide with those who
appear to be contemplating killing
themselves, Daher said. "You
should never underrespond; a
direct response is always appro
priate."

Huang suggested faculty aca
demic advisors could provide
greater support for troubled stu
dents, especially graduate stu
dents, by adopting more "pater
nalistic" roles like those of profes
sors in Asia, who act as "all
around mentors, almost as par
ents to their students."
Huang's concern for graduate
students seems particularly

appropriate given the results of an
informal CAPS study of 19 Stan
ford suicides between 1963 and
1978. The study indicated that
graduate students are somewhat
more likely to commit suicide
than undergraduates.
The study also found that the
suicide victims who were involved
in romantic relationships — one
third of the total — experienced

conflicts with their partners
before they killed themselves.
The feeling of social isolation
following a break-up can often be
"the last straw," D'Andrea said.
Marital status also plays a role
in suicide risk. According to a
study published in 1987 by Cor
nell University psychiatrist Ger
ald Klerman, single individuals
are more likely to commit suicide

than married people, especially if
they also suffer from a psychiatric
disorder.
Also, Klerman noted that car
riage has a greater "protective"
value for men than for women, as
marriage reduces suicide rates for
men more than for women.
Social isolation
Feelings of social isolation are
not uncommon at Stanford. For
new students, the loss of a secure
community and the relatively
large size of the University can be
overwhelming.
D'Andrea pointed out that
developing relationships here may
be more difficult as time passes.
"Social isolation is usually self
imposed in some way," he said. "If
you don't connect with people
your freshman year, it can be very
difficult to do so later."
Social isolation may have an
even more profound effect on
graduate students, who arrive on
campus without the welcoming
atmosphere of Orientation and
the opportunity to form social ties
in undergraduate dormitories.
The differences in social oppor
tunities available to undergradu
ates and graduates may con
tribute to the slightly higher per
centage of graduate students
seeking CAPS counseling,
D'Andrea said.
In addition to CAPS and the
Bridge, dormitories provide their
own resources in the form of resi
dent assistants, resident fellows
and residence deans.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Diana Conklin,
training for all three positions
includes CAPS sessions on appro
priate responses to suicide-related
gestures and events, as well as
information on referral services.
Residences might indeed be a
starting point for the sort of ideal
campus described by Huang as
"possessing a sense of community
and connectedness."
Further information and coun
seling are available at the Bridge
(723-3392) and CAPS (723-3785).
The Bridge and the Santa Clara
County Suicide and Crisis Preven
tion Service (494-8420) operate
24-hour crisis hotlines.

Although some consider Stan
ford an idyllic "Disneyland of the
North," three student suicides
over the summer and an
attempted suicide last week have
reminded the campus it cannot
escape the tragedies of the real
world.
"From three years of dorm liv
ing, it seems to me people here
often put forth the image that
they're always happy. But... stu
dents at Stanford, like anywhere,
have their ups and downs," said
senior Matt Paradise, a counselor
at the Bridge, the University's
peer counseling center.
Stanford appears to have a typ
ical suicide rate for a university,
according to Counseling and Psy
chological Services psychiatrist
Vincent D'Andrea. Brown Univer
sity, for example, reported three
suicides within the last year.
Merely deciding to attend col
lege bodes well for students, as

college and university students
have lower suicide rates than non
students of the same age.
The national suicide rate for
individuals aged 15 to 24 years is
19 deaths per 100,000 people each
year, but it is only 15 deaths per
100,0000 college students. Given
Stanford's student population of
about 13,000, this rate translates
into an expected average of about
two suicides per year.
Current statistical trends
about student suicides at univer
sities are difficult to establish
because they occur relatively
infrequently.
However, research has shown
that college-age men are five

ferences may be especially significant — and

transition to Stanford.

times more likely than college-age
women to commit suicide,
although women attempt to do so
more often, according to Univer
sity of Rochester psychiatrist
Allen Schwartz, a researcher of
college-age suicide. The gender
gap closes somewhat with age, he
added.
In studying nationwide trends,
researchers have also linked geo
graphic location to suicide. For
example, Pacific Coast residents
are twice as likely to commit sui
cide as their counterparts in the
Middle Atlantic states, Schwartz
said.
Proportionately, white Ameri
cans commit suicide more fre

quently than all minority groups.
Among American minority
groups, Native Americans have
the highest suicide rate, D'Andrea
said.
American suicide statistics can
not be applied to this summer's
Stanford deaths, because all three
suicides were committed by inter
national students.
While these three suicides do
not establish any definite relation
ship between cultural background
and vulnerability to suicide, they
serve as reminders of the unique
problems faced by international
students.
Cultural differences
How easily students adjust to
Stanford may be greatly influ
enced by their cultural back
ground, personality and prior
expectations, according to Marcia
Makino, assistant director of for
eign student advising at Bechtel
International Center.
For some students, the impact
of cultural differences may be
especially significant — and some
times rather disturbing — during
the transitional period.
Stanford's 300 undergraduate
and 1,800 graduate international
students, in particular, are very
likely to experience some level of
"culture shock" upon arrival at
Stanford, said Makino. Such a
reaction is completely normal and
often lasts about three months,
she added.
In some cases, the severity of
culture shock is closely related to
the extent of differences between
Stanford and a student's native
country.
"For those students coming in
from Canada and Western
Europe, the transition is generally
a little easier," Makino said.

appropriate given the results of an
informal CAPS study of 19 Stan
ford suicides between 1963 and
1978. The study indicated that
graduate students are somewhat
more likely to commit suicide
than undergraduates.
The study also found that the
suicide victims who were involved
in romantic relationships — one
third of the total — experienced

conflicts with their partners
before they killed themselves.
The feeling of social isolation
following a break-up can often be
"the last straw," D'Andrea said.
Marital status also plays a role
in suicide risk. According to a
study published in 1987 by Cor
nell University psychiatrist Ger
ald Klerman, single individuals
are more likely to commit suicide

than married people, especially if
they also suffer from a psychiatric
disorder.
Also, Klerman noted that car
riage has a greater "protective"
value for men than for women, as
marriage reduces suicide rates for
men more than for women.
Social isolation
Feelings of social isolation are
not uncommon at Stanford. For
new students, the loss of a secure
community and the relatively
large size of the University can be
overwhelming.
D'Andrea pointed out that
developing relationships here may
be more difficult as time passes.
"Social isolation is usually self
imposed in some way," he said. "If
you don't connect with people
your freshman year, it can be very
difficult to do so later."
Social isolation may have an
even more profound effect on
graduate students, who arrive on
campus without the welcoming
atmosphere of Orientation and
the opportunity to form social ties
in undergraduate dormitories.
The differences in social oppor
tunities available to undergradu
ates and graduates may con
tribute to the slightly higher per
centage of graduate students
seeking CAPS counseling,
D'Andrea said.
In addition to CAPS and the
Bridge, dormitories provide their
own resources in the form of resi
dent assistants, resident fellows
and residence deans.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Diana Conklin,
training for all three positions
includes CAPS sessions on appro
priate responses to suicide-related
gestures and events, as well as
information on referral services.
Residences might indeed be a
starting point for the sort of ideal
campus described by Huang as
"possessing a sense of community
and connectedness."
Further information and coun
seling are available at the Bridge
(723-3392) and CAPS (723-3785).
The Bridge and the Santa Clara
County Suicide and Crisis Preven
tion Service (494-8420) operate
24-hour crisis hotlines.

Although some consider Stan
ford an idyllic "Disneyland of the
North," three student suicides
over the summer and an
attempted suicide last week have
reminded the campus it cannot
escape the tragedies of the real
world.
"From three years of dorm liv
ing, it seems to me people here
often put forth the image that
they're always happy. But... stu
dents at Stanford, like anywhere,
have their ups and downs," said
senior Matt Paradise, a counselor
at the Bridge, the University's
peer counseling center.
Stanford appears to have a typ
ical suicide rate for a university,
according to Counseling and Psy
chological Services psychiatrist
Vincent D'Andrea. Brown Univer
sity, for example, reported three
suicides within the last year.
Merely deciding to attend col
lege bodes well for students, as

college and university students
have lower suicide rates than non
students of the same age.
The national suicide rate for
individuals aged 15 to 24 years is
19 deaths per 100,000 people each
year, but it is only 15 deaths per
100,0000 college students. Given
Stanford's student population of
about 13,000, this rate translates
into an expected average of about
two suicides per year.
Current statistical trends
about student suicides at univer
sities are difficult to establish
because they occur relatively
infrequently.
However, research has shown
that college-age men are five

ferences may be especially significant — and
sometimes rather disturbing — during the
transition to Stanford.

times more likely than college-age
women to commit suicide,
although women attempt to do so
more often, according to Univer
sity of Rochester psychiatrist
Allen Schwartz, a researcher of
college-age suicide. The gender
gap closes somewhat with age, he
added.
In studying nationwide trends,
researchers have also linked geo
graphic location to suicide. For
example, Pacific Coast residents
are twice as likely to commit sui
cide as their counterparts in the
Middle Atlantic states, Schwartz
said.
Proportionately, white Ameri
cans commit suicide more fre

quently than all minority groups.
Among American minority
groups, Native Americans have
the highest suicide rate, D'Andrea
said.
American suicide statistics can
not be applied to this summer's
Stanford deaths, because all three
suicides were committed by inter
national students.
While these three suicides do
not establish any definite relation
ship between cultural background
and vulnerability to suicide, they
serve as reminders of the unique
problems faced by international
students.
Cultural differences
How easily students adjust to
Stanford may be greatly influ
enced by their cultural back
ground, personality and prior
expectations, according to Marcia
Makino, assistant director of for
eign student advising at Bechtel
International Center.
For some students, the impact
of cultural differences may be
especially significant — and some
times rather disturbing — during
the transitional period.
Stanford's 300 undergraduate
and 1,800 graduate international
students, in particular, are very
likely to experience some level of
"culture shock" upon arrival at
Stanford, said Makino. Such a
reaction is completely normal and
often lasts about three months,
she added.
In some cases, the severity of
culture shock is closely related to
the extent of differences between
Stanford and a student's native
country.
"For those students coming in
from Canada and Western
Europe, the transition is generally
a little easier," Makino said.
But for some students from
other parts of the world — includ
ing, perhaps, the three suicide vic
tims who came to Stanford from
various Asian countries — cul
tural differences may be more
extreme.
For instance, many aspects of
Asian culture are "very different"
from Western culture, said
Makino. And these differences
may directly or indirectly affect
the emotional well-being of inter
national students.
Cultural divergence between
Asians and Americans, for exam
ple, can been seen in"the way peo
ple solve problems and seek help,"
Makino said.
CAPS psychologist Karen
Huang agreed, explaining that
some Asians may feel reluctant to
seek professional counseling due
to a traditional cultural concern
for "maintaining face," or avoid
ing situations that could bring
shame to themselves and their
families.
Consequently, some students
who are in need of assistance
"can't even avail themselves" of
the counseling opportunities pro
vided at Stanford, Makino said.
Although most university stu
dents experience a certain level of

anxiety, Huang said stress may be
more extreme for international
students.
For example, pressure for high
academic achievement can be con
siderably greater for foreign stu
dents arriving at a prestigious
university like Stanford,
explained Huang. "They are usu
ally the cream of the crop of their
native cities or villages, so they
feel they have to do really well to
meet the expectations of people
back at home," she said.
Racial discrimination may also
contribute to stress for some
Asian students. "It may be sub
tle," said Huang. She cited a hypo
thetical case of an Asian student
who isn't invited to a party
because of the stereotypical view
that "Asian people are nerds."
Counseling opportunities
The prospect of visiting CAPS
or the Bridge for help may be even
more daunting when counselors
have different cultural back
grounds than their clients.
According to Bridge counselor
Cory Booker, a senior, "There can
be a lot of mistrust for students of
color going to a white counselor.
There's a fear of being misunder
stood, and I think there's a lot of
validity to that concern."
In response to that fear, the
Bridge introduced two peer coun
seling groups last year to deal
specifically with issues facing
African-American and Asian-
American students. The Bridge
also offers a peer counseling group
for gay and lesbian students and is
planning a fourth group for inter
national students.
The number of minority coun
selors at the Bridge has also been
rising steadily, Booker noted.
According to CAPS psychologist
Douglas Daher, all "helping pro
fessionals" need to gain greater
understanding of cross-cultural
issues.
In addition, friends and family
should not hesitate to confront
the issue of suicide with those who
appear to be contemplating killing
themselves, Daher said. "You
should never underrespond; a
direct response is always appro
priate."

Huang suggested faculty aca
demic advisors could provide
greater support for troubled stu
dents, especially graduate stu
dents, by adopting more "pater
nalistic" roles like those of profes
sors in Asia, who act as "all
around mentors, almost as par
ents to their students."
Huang's concern for graduate
students seems particularly

appropriate given the results of an
informal CAPS study of 19 Stan
ford suicides between 1963 and
1978. The study indicated that
graduate students are somewhat
more likely to commit suicide

The study also found that the
