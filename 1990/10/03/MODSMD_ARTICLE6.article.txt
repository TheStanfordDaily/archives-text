# Feds include Harvard in indirect-cost probe

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Federal officials from the
General Accounting Office,
scheduled to arrive here next
week, will also visit Harvard as
part of their investigation of
indirect-cost policies at
research universities.
Harvard Medical School will
be included in the GAO's inves
tigation because of its unusual
ly high indirect-cost rates, a
staff member of the House sub
committee on Oversight and
Investigations said in an inter
view yesterday. The subcom
mittee, chaired by Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., asked the
GAO to conduct the review of
indirect-cost procedures.
In addition to Stanford and
Harvard Medical School, the
GAO will examine practices at
two other universities, the staff

member said. Those two
schools have not been selected,
she said.
The GAO investigation is
one of two ongoing federal
investigations of Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery policies.
The Office of Naval
Research is examining the pos
sibility that Stanford repeated
ly overbilled the federal govern
ment for indirect costs incurred
by government-sponsored
research here. A letter written
by Paul Biddle, the ONR's cam
pus representative, apparently
prompted that review. In his
letter, Biddle said Stanford
may have engaged in "fraudu
lent acts" and made "false
claims."
Indirect costs are expendi
tures necessary to support
research but not easily
attributable to a specific pro
ject.
