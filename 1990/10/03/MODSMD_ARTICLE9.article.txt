# Seniors plan to launch Stanford chapter of NOW within weeks

As National Organization for Women
President Molly Yard prepares to visit
campus tomorrow, two seniors are plan
ning to form a NOW chapter here within
the next two weeks.
A campus chapter of NOW has been in
the planning stages since spring, accord
ing to the Beth Van Schaack, one of the
founders. Although some logistical details
have yet to be worked out, Van Schaack
and her co-founder and roommate Rita
Roca expect to hold a preliminary meet
ing in the next week or two.
NOW is beginning to target university
students nationwide in response to last
year's Supreme Court decisions regard
ing abortion.
"In effect the Court said it is proper for
states to require parental consent" before

minors may receive abortions, Yard said
in an interview with The Daily Monday.
"[The Court's decision] is aimed at
younger people ... so we decided to con
centrate on campuses."
NOW also hopes to encourage college
students to register and vote for pro
choice and pro-women candidates, Yard
said.
Because of its hierarchical structure
and the limited range of issues it
addresses, NOW is "very problematic to a
lot of feminists," Van Schaack said. "As a
member of the Women's Center Collec
tive, I feel that [collectivism] is much
more of what feminism is about, at a
grass roots level. We have had a hard time
dealing with the NOW structure."
•However, Van Schaack said the
national network and the connections
that NOW provides will be a positive addi
tion to existing campus women's

resources.
Rather than creating an completely
separate organization, "we would like to
create an internal network at Stanford,"
Van Schaack said. She expects that some
members will also be members of groups
such as the Pro-Choice Alliance and the
Women's Center Collective.
"In general I think any organizing
around women's issues is a good thing,
and that is what the Women's Center is
here to foster — trying new things and
new ways to reach people," said acting
Women's Center Coordinator Teri Hop
per. "But I think [the organizers] have a
lot to overcome in terms of NOW's his
tory toward lesbians and women of color."
Stanford does not allow student
groups to take directives from national
organizations, so a campus chapter of
NOW will have to create its own Consti
tution and decision-making process.

"What we assume and insist on is that
decisions are made locally, by students,"
said Michael Ramsey-Perez, program and
fraternal affairs directer. "No outside
organization can order a Stanford organi
zation to do or not do something,
although they can certainly make sugges
tions."
Local autonomy will allow Stanford
NOW be different from other chapters of
NOW, according to Van Schaack.
"We will try and really personalize it to
the Stanford community, to make it inclu
sive so that it will be less of a 'white
women's feminism,' " she said. For
example, Stanford NOW will address
issues such as pay equity at a local level
by asking whether Stanford employees
are getting equal pay for equal work.
Another detail which needs to be
addressed is NOW's membership fee. Van
Schaack expressed fears that the $40 Cal-

ifornia fee — which pays for chapter, state
and national membership — will be pro
hibitive for many students.
"We are trying to arrange a scholarship
program so that students do not pay it, or
pay a nominal $5 fee," she said.
But Yard said any changes in the fee
system would have to be approved by a
national convention of NOW delegates.
Members have the option of paying a
reduced fee of $10, but a fee lower than
that "does not even pay for the services."
Yard will speak at Stanford Tomorrow
on reproductive rights, student involve
ment in politics and the upcoming Senate
and gubernatorial elections.
Roca and Van Schaack are members o f
NOW chapters and are Stanford's repre
sentatives to the national organization.
"The women in Palo Alto are really
excited about having sort of a sister chap
ter at Stanford," Van Schaack said.
