Germany promises peace
BERLIN (AP) — Germany's president
marked the historic unification yesterday of
his mighty new country by promising Germans
will work for world peace and never forget the
victims of the nation's Nazi past.
Random violence in nearly a dozen cities
marred the unification celebrations overnight.
And about 15,000 leftists protesting the
merger rallied yesterday afternoon in Berlin's
working-class district of Kreuzberg, and
numerous shouting matches with police broke
out.
At a formal state ceremony in the Berlin
Philharmonic Hall, President Richard von
Weizsaecker said: "The Nazi terror and the
war it caused inflicted untold serious injustice
and suffering on almost all of Europe and on
us. We continuously recall the victims.
"No one among us will forget that there
never would have been a separation without
the war started by Germany under Hitler,"
von Weizsaecker told several hundred invited
guests.
The 70-year-old head of state said Germany
wants "to serve world peace in a united
Europe."
Saddam tours Kuwait
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein toured the streets of Kuwait
City yesterday and visited with soldiers who
promised to defend the invaded country
against "all evil attempts" to dislodge them.
In his first reported visit to occupied
Kuwait, Saddam found a capital that "glit
tered with pride" at his presence, the official
Iraqi News Agency said, monitored in Nicosia.
Saddam toured the streets of Kuwait, which
"appeared flourishing after its return to the
mother homeland." Saddam has annexed
Kuwait and proclaimed it Iraq's 19th province.
IRS sells brothel
RENO, Nev. (AP) — The bankrupt Mustang
Ranch remains on the Internal Revenue Ser
vice's auction block even though Storey
County commissioners have banned prostitu
tion at America's best-known legal brothel.
"This doesn't affect things at all. Once we
secure a property, our procedure is to sell it,"
IRS spokeswoman Norma Lally said yesterday.
Commissioners voted on Tuesday to ban
prostitution at the bordello 10 miles east of
Reno, saying they are tired of the "circus" that
has surrounded it the past 35 years.
The IRS seized the Mustang on Sept. 21 for
a tax debt estimated at $13 million owed by
owners Joe and Sally Conforte.
Nerds take revenge
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A doorman at the
Mayan nightclub may not have approved of
four not-so-trendy people who weren't allowed
in last spring, but justice is blind and decided
their civil rights suits were chic.
A small-claims court commissioner yester
day awarded $250 apiece to the four, who had
waited in vain to get in the downtown club on
May 19.
They filed lawsuits under the Unruh Civil
Rights Act of 1959, claiming they were kept
out by an arbitrary and discriminatory deci
sion.
Larry Nagler, a Beverly Hills attorney rep
resenting the club, said he would appeal the
case to Superior Court to have it tried again.
