# World powers agree on arms

NEW YORK (AP) â€” The United States and the
Soviet Union announced agreement in principle yes
terday on a comprehensive treaty to limit non-nucle
ar weapons in Europe. If signed, such a treaty would
represent the first limits on these arms in Europe
since the end of World War 11.
The two sides also said they had made "substan
tial progress" on a separate agreement to limit long
range nuclear weapons.
The agreement came at the end of more than five
hours of talks between Secretary of State James
Baker 111 and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
It sets ceiling on weapons that may be deployed in
Europe, but does not cover the number of soldiers
that may be put in the field, a topic the negotiators
agreed to skip.
Both ministers cautioned that final approval must
await consultation with their allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
Shevardnadze said one sticking point remained
concerning limits on helicopters "but that is not very
difficult" and could be resolved by NATO and
Warsaw Pact negotiators in Vienna, site of talks on
the treaty for 19 months.
The last remaining roadblocks cleared in the ses
sion at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations
were limits on land-based airplanes and verification
procedures for guarding against cheating.
Baker and Shevardnadze did not explain the deal
they struck on these two points, although
Shevardnadze said with a chuckle "of course the
Soviet Union made all the concessions."
At the White House, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater reacted to the announcement with
one word: "Great," and said there would be no fur
ther comment yesterday.
The accord is the projected centerpiece for a 34-
nation summit meeting to be held in Paris Nov. 19-
21. Until the two superpowers hear from their allies,
Baker reserved judgment on whether that deadline
would be met.
The two superpowers agreed in 1989 to limits on
their short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
In 15 years of desultory talks before that on
"Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions" they made
no progress on conventional force reductions. The
February 1989 nuclear agreement and the unilateral
moves by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to end
the cold war revived the conventional forces negotia
tions under the rubric "Conventional Forces in
Europe."
The steady withdrawal of Soviet troops and tanks
and U.S. cutbacks already are doing what the treaty
seeks to accomplish. But a treaty represents a formal
commitment by both sides.
