MANILA, Philippines (AP) â€”
Mutinous soldiers seized an army
headquarters before dawn yester
day in the southern Philippines in
what officials said could be the
prelude to a new coup attempt
against President Corazon
Aquino.
The armed forces went on
nationwide alert and Mrs. Aquino
met with her Cabinet and senior
military officers and congressmen
at the presidential palace.
Steps were taken to isolate the
rebels, who seized the 402 nd
Brigade army base on Mindanao
island about 500 miles south of
Manila. Flights to Mindanao were
cancelled and schools on the
island were closed.
About 200 troops led by three
officers seized the base, said mili
tary chief Gen. Renato de Villa.
Initial reports gave no indication
that blood had been shed in the

takeover.
A senior legislator, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the
mutineers apparently planned to
establish a secessionist govern
ment on Mindanao, the southern
most Philippines island. There
had been rumors that a coup
attempt was brewing in the region
for nearly six months.
Mrs. Aquino has survived six
coup attempts since she assumed
office in February, 1986.
A bomb exploded outside a
Manila army base four hours after
the Mindanao base was taken
over, the 35th explosion in the
capital since August. It caused no
injuries.
Officials have said the bombing
campaign was the work of mili
tary officers hoping to aggravate a
climate of instability in the coun
try and create the conditions for
another coup attempt.

But de Villa expressed confi
dence the uprising could be
halted.
"I think this is a small thing
and we can control this," he said
in a radio interview. "We wish to
inform the public that the armed
forces is united. Except for this
breakaway group, we are in con
trol of all units in Manila and the
entire country."
De Villa said the 200 soldiers
were from the 53rd Infantry Bat
talion, one of the units based at
the 402 nd Brigade in Butuan city.
About 3,000 soldiers are based at
the brigade.
The troops, led by a certain Mqj
Cerdeno, launched the mutiny at
about 1 a.m. (9:00 a.m. yesterday
PDT), de Villa said.
De Villa said he called com
manding officers of various camps
around the country and was
assured of their loyalty.
