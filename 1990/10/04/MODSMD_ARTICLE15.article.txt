WASHINGTON (AP) - Liberal
House Democrats rebelled yesterday
against the $500-billion deficit-reduc
tion package as President Bush and
congressional leaders pushed hard for
the plan on the eve of its first vote.
Leading House Democrats and
Republicans expressed confidence that
both sides would round up a majority
of votes by today, when the full House
plans to vote on an outline of the pack
age of tax boosts and spending cuts.
"That is my intuition, that when
the vote comes there will be a rruyority
of both parties," said House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
But Bush, Foley and House Minor
ity Leader Robert Michel, R-111.,
worked furiously behind the scenes,
meeting privately with rank-and-file
members and dispatching top lieu
tenants to do the same. Democratic
leadership aides, speaking privately,
offered conflicting assessments of how
worried they might be about the
prospects.
A number of liberal Democrats said

they would oppose the proposal, com
plaining about its reliance on $60 bil
lion in Medicare cuts over five years
and about the $11 billion in tax breaks
it contains for small businesses.
"To cut $60 billion from Medicare
means a lot of low-income elderly are
going to be faced with difficult out-of
pocket expenses," said Rep. Henry
Waxman, D-Calif. "These people
didn't create the deficit."
After a day of White House lobbying
Republicans, spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the needed votes still
were not in hand, and declined to say
how many votes the White House
could muster.
Bush kept close tabs on the results
of lobbying efforts, checking in with
Fitzwater at the end of the day for a
reading of what the Congress members
were telling reporters. Fitzwater told
him that "most say they are consider
ing it, they're listening and they're
sympathetic to the argument."
Twenty-seven more Republicans
met with Bush at the White House, the

third straight day on which GOP law
makers were summoned by the presi
dent for his sales pitch. One White
House official called the operation the
Bush administration's biggest lobby
ing effort yet.
"I was leaning against before. Now
I'm firmly undecided," said Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., after emerging from
a meeting.
Reps. Susan Molinari and Sher
wood L. Boehlert, both R-N.Y., said
they were more inclined to vote with
the president after the meeting, but
they wanted an unpopular 2 cents per
gallon home heating oil tax dropped.
"It was not any arm twisting. He
based all his arguments on facts,"
Molinari said.
Bush cancelled a weekend trip to his
Maine summer home to stay on top of
the budget issue.
"There comes a time when you have
to simply make tough decisions, give a
little, to get what is best for the coun
try," Bush told reporters in a message
clearly designed for congressional con

sumption.
He urged members of Congress to
vote for the package and then "blame
the president" when they talk to vot
ers.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair
man Alan Greenspan said at a congres
sional hearing that he supports the
deficit-reduction package. Green
span's views are important since sup
porters of the plan are looking to the
Federal Reserve to lower interest rates
to offset any negative economic effects.
The package would raise taxes on
gasoline, home heating oil, alcohol,
tobacco, expensive cars and other lux
ury items, and on the incomes of the
wealthy.
It would cut defense spending by
close to $200 billion over the next five
years while reducing spending on ben
efit programs by $105 billion.
The heating oil provision was being
fought by members of Congress from
Northeastern states, some of whom
said that keeping it in could hurt sup
port for the overall proposal.
