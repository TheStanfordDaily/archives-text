## Is it policy or politics? 
### 
Stanford needs to make
a clear statement on its
new alcohol policy - soon

STANFORD HAS COMPLIED
with the letter of the Drug-
Free Schools and Communi
ties Act by modifying the Univer
sity's stated drug and alcohol pol
icy.
But the administration should
go no further in compromising its
right to form its own policy on this
and all other issues.
Students are confused and con
cerned about the status of the
drinking policy at Stanford. They
need a clear and unambiguous
statement from the University,
telling them what the policy will be
in the interim before a final deci
sion is made. And they would like
to know that that final decision is
in good hands.
Addressing only the superficiali
ties of one of the nation's deepest
and most compelling problems, the
new federal legislation is a cheap
shot leveled at universities to
enhance the image of the so-called
"war on drugs."
University students represent a
segment of the population respon
sible for few of the nation's drug
related crimes and deaths.
But universities are a conve
nient, usually docile target for
strong-arm legislation because of
their dependence on federal fund
ing. Such legislative cowardice is
an empty blow in the war on drugs,
political rhetoric intended to sound
good at election time.
Were it only a hollow victory in
the war on drugs, the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act
might yet be viewed with equanim
ity. But the law represents a fla

grant violation of the University's
autonomy.
Stanford's policy toward stu
dents' behavior has long been gov
erned by the Fundamental Stan
dard, which states that "Students
are expected to show both within
and without the University such
respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor, find the rights of oth
ers as is demanded of good citi
zens."
The Standard, which places con
fidence in students' ability to make
moral and ethical value judgments,
has been the foundation of Stan
ford's social environment.
Stanford's Fundamental Stan
dard has never held that students
were immune from the laws of the
land. The University has neither
questioned nor impeded the prose
cution and punishment of students
charged with crimes.
But the Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act requires Stan
ford to do the government's work
itself. It requires the University to
itself prohibit — and punish — the
use, possession, and distribution of
controlled substances, with pun
ishments as severe as expulsion.
It requires the University to
mete out academic punishments —
like suspension and expulsion — to
those who violate the law. This is a
blow to the University's autonomy
which it should not tolerate.
The new legislation is a rhetori
cal move with little more than sym
bolic consequences.
Given this, the University
should play the same game.
Administrators will have to return
the rhetoric necessary to appease
federal policy makers.
But the University should not
compromise the autonomy of its
own policy-making, nor jeopardize
the integrity of a long-standing tra
dition of confident trust in the
capacity of students to make their
own decisions.
