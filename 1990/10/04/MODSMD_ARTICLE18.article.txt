Argument for legalized drugs is based on faulty logic

THE SLUGGISH pace of our war on
drugs continues to spawn many
revolutionary concepts, the most
disturbing of which is the idea that illicit
drugs cannot and indeed should not be
eliminated from civilized society, and
consequently should be legitimized.
Chuck Olsen's Sept. 27 commentary
on the subject was a model of the mis
guided thinking that dominates legaliza
tion advocates.
Olsen argues that the legalization of
drugs would alleviate our current woes
in the same manner that repealing Pro
hibition rid us of crime and corruption
associated with alcohol in the twenties.
This line of reasoning is peculiar in its
willingness to accept a drug situation
that would parallel our present problems
with alcohol. The last decade has seen
250,000 people killed by drunk drivers.

Science Magazine estimates that alco
hol-related health problems cost taxpay
ers approximately 117 billion dollars to
treat every year. Such figures dwarf the
number of deaths and the amount of
money spent in our current war on
drugs.
Illicit drugs, however, would likely be
even more pernicious in their effects
than alcohol if they were legalized. Sub
stances such as crack can have addictive
effects after only one use, while sub
stances such as LSD, heroin and cocaine
all have powerful mind-altering effects.
Social use of drugs is impossible in the
same sense as a person having a glass of
wine with a meal. It is the very potency
of a drug that is both the most seductive
lure and the most destructive hazard to
the addict.
The tearful experiences of those who

survive addiction — and the mute testi
mony of those who do not — teach soci
ety in no uncertain terms that drugs
must be avoided at all cost. The free
access to such substances that is inher
ent in any legalization policy would be
disastrous.
Even in light of these practical consid
erations, however, Olsen maintains that
it is "simply wrong" to keep drugs illegal.
He says that what a person does in his
own house and with his own body is not
the government's business, which is
true, though only up to the point where
it does not interfere with the rights of
others. A government does have the
right and indeed the obligation to main
tain the social good for all people.
If it could be demonstrated that the ill
effects of drug use could be confined only
to the user, then perhaps legalization

could be tolerated.
Government should also be in a posi
tion to protect at times the individual
from himself. Prescriptions are issued
for medicines, and licenses are issued for
guns to insure that they will be used in a
responsible manner.
The fact that they are to be utilized in
private is irrelevant. Controlled sub
stances are far too dangerous to be used
responsibly and must therefore be out
lawed.
The war on drugs is far from perfect,
and the solutions will not be easy to find.
But we must retain the idea that our
society will be better off without drugs
than with them. The fight to free our
nation from drugs must be won through
conviction, not through capitulation.
