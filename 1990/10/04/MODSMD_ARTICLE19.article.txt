# Sprinklers wasting valuable resource
## 
### 
It is no surprise to me that Stanford is
the worst water waster on the peninsula.
Roaming the campus in the wee hours of
the morning reveals why.
When lawn sprinklers run here, the
water showers out under such tremen
dous pressure, raining down at such a
high volume, that the soil is unable to
absorb much of it.
Such a large amount of water runs off
into the street that gutters have the look
of stream beds after a flash flood . Water
sculpted patterns of soil and pebbles coat
the concrete long after the deluge of
sprinklers is past.
Sprinklers are supposed to "sprinkle,"
not flood. If Stanford could reduce its
sprinkler pressure by three-quarters, the
currently obscene run-ofT would be
reduced to a trickle, our lawns and plants
would thrive, the University would save

on water fees and penalties and the
thirsty Bay Area would save hundreds of
thousands of gallons of water.
