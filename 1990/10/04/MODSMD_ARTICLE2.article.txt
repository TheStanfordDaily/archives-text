Stanford police identified a 39-year
old fugitive Monday who allegedly
broke into several vehicles and stole
credit cards at last Sunday's football
game against San Jose State.
The six-foot, 250-pound suspect
identified himself to police as David
Smith and carried a fake Oklahoma
license under that name. After sending
his fingerprints to the FBI, police
learned that his real identity is Garry
Woody of Texas.
"He has at least eight aliases, most
of them people he has stolen credit
cards from," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.

Woody is being held in North Santa
Clara County Jail, and will be charged
with robbery, burglary, felony use of
Mace, false impersonation, possession
of master keys for the purpose of bur
glary and possession of stolen credit
cards. Bail was set at $250,000.
Police said they believe Woody used
a similar strategy to steal credit cards
at the Brigham Young-Washington
game and at the Reno Air Races earlier
this year.
During Sunday's game, Woody
allegedly wandered through the rows
of vehicles parked to tailgate, and let
himself into unoccupied vans and
motor homes with several master keys.

Niemeyer said the suspect allegedly
broke into three vehicles and took
credit cards. He then allegedly
replaced them with canceled or over
drawn stolen credit cards so that vic
tims would not realize their loss imme
diately.
Earlier in the day, Woody also
allegedly attacked a pregnant woman
who demanded that he leave her motor
home. He escaped after allegedly strik
ing the woman and spraying her in the
face with Mace, police said.
Woody resisted arrest by spraying
Mace and shouting threats at fans and
police officers, Niemeyer said. Six offi
cers wrestled Woody to the ground and

placed him in handcuffs outside the
Stanford Stadium during the game.
Niemeyer described Woody as "a
real pro" and "slick." He dropped a bag
of 31 credit cards from various states
shortly before his arrest Saturday.
Several warrants have been issued
for Woody's arrest, including one from
the U.S. Marshal's Office for violating
parole. He is wanted by the sheriff's
departments of Oklahoma County,
Olda., and Lake Charles and Shreve
port, La., for charges including fraud,
conspiracy, theft and forgery.
He also was imprisoned in Monaco
for gambling fraud.
