# 'People of color' an inappropriate term
## 
### 
I strongly oppose the use of the term
"people of color" or "colored races"in
the University, not just The Stanford
Daily. It has occurred much more often
than the proper term "non-whites."
Roughly classified, there are four col
ors: white (mainly Caucasians), black
(mainly Africans), yellow (mainly Asians)
and red (mainly American Indians).
These are all colors, and it is inappropri
ate to label all non-whites under the
label "colored."
I would like the community to serious
ly consider dropping this term, especially

in the wake of multiculturalism.
