# And by the way...

After reading what is perhaps your
first Stanford essay, Virginia, I have one
question: what is your point?
I had to read the article several times,
but finally I deduced that you are inform
ing men that women think of them as sex
objects, just as men "undress females
with [their] eyes."
The essence of your column is the rev
elation in your conclusion: "Now each sex
can be regarded as sides of beef by the
other." How absolutely trivial and taste
less!
But, you know, when I read that, I
actually shuddered with relief. I was real
ly worried that women did not care what
men looked like â€” that a man's personal
ity was the only thing they considered.

Now I have a solid excuse to exercise
and comb my hair.
