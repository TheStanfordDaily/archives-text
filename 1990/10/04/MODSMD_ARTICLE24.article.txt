"A college-bred Negro still is not a
person like other folks, but an inter
esting problem."
—Zora Neale Hurston
Surrendering the Crayolas was hard
enough, but it was inevitable. As all of the
great minds made sacrifices to pursue a
higher education, it was expected.
So I relinquished my brilliant, wax
writing tools at an early age with hopes of
one day attending Stanford University —
armed with mechanical pencils.
But now, like many other black stu
dents, I am faced with a more difficult
dilemma — how can I hold onto my black
identity while I learn to live and think in
a white world?
The indoctrination into an intellectual
world that has systematically distorted or
denied my existence may divorce me from
the black community.
A diploma will lend me a privileged
position in the white world. Not everyone
attends a top 10 university and even
fewer blacks do.
A diploma will make me "different"
from the majority of blacks and therein
lies the danger. / may actually begin to
believe that I am different and cut myself
off from the community that I call home.
But even by defecting from the black
community and becoming a self-pro
claimed Benedict Arnold, I would not find
amnesty in the white world. When I fin

won't be stamped on my forehead.

It won't be apparent that I am, indeed,
a "college-bred Negro." My color will iso

Kant, white folks will note that I am tan

not like all of the others. White folks will

a marginal life between tokenism and intoler

to choose that places me on the fence.

ness.
With a persuasive voice constantly
egging me on to be successful in the white
world regardless of the consequences, I
sometimes succumb to its devilish plea.
Flattery is a most effective tool and I
am pleased to hear that I am indeed quite
"different" (to be translated as "special")
than other people.
There's something quite thrilling
about being "unique." Yet what white
people would really mean by this dubious
compliment is that I am "better than
black" and more importantly that I am
