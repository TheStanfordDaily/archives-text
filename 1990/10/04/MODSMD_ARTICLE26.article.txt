## Donald Kennedy Kennedy presents four approaches to Stanford improvement 
### 
RECENT COLUMNS in The Daily
have contained several skeptical
references about the effort to
improve the status and quality of teach
ing at Stanford.
Having already recommended skepti
cism in my welcoming remarks to the
Class of 1994,1 can hardly criticize it in
their elders! So let me offer instead a real
istic view of how difficult our task is, and
then suggest a timetable for convincing
the skeptics.
The quality of undergraduate instruc
tion here, already high, can be further
improved through at least these four
approaches: (1) by raising the priority on
teaching through campus-wide conversa
tion and debate; (2) by rewarding excel
lent teaching in practical and symbolic
ways; (3) by modifying the appointment
and promotion process so that the evalu
ation of teaching is improved and given
greater weight; and (4) by committing
new resources to teaching.
My April 5 speech to the Faculty Sen
ate, and subsequent communications to
the faculty, have been aimed at starting
us out toward the first of these objectives.

I hope that those concerned with the
pace of our progress will continue to crit
icize us, as Jason Lewis did in his chal
lenging piece in Tuesday's Daily; but I
also hope they will recognize that many
improvements will be slow in coming.
As to the second objective: excellent
teaching is already evaluated by a variety
of means at the school level, and through
the Hoagland, Gores and Dinkelspiel
awards at the university level.
We will doubtless add other forms of
recognition; but in the long run, the third
objective — the appointment and promo
tion process — is the key to changing
institutional culture.
Here we encounter the problem that is
the source of Lewis' main complaint, and
the subject of earlier letters about Dr.
Ellen Porzig's appointment in the
Department of Biological Sciences.
To what extent should there be an
opportunity for administrative "override"
of decisions made, and rules established,
by departmental and school faculty?
In replying to a letter by Thomas Cele
brezze and Tim Walter (Daily, Sept. 26), I
pointed to an old rule: "The faculty

decides who is to be on the faculty."
What that means is that the decisions
about appointment and promotion are
reached by faculty vote, so that quality
control is made to rest upon peer review.
There is a powerful academic tradition
to override the faculty by administrative
fiat, (other than, for example, through
the consideration of a grievance), that
would set off a charge to the barricades in
defense of academic freedom — and in my
judgment the defenders would be right.
The longer but surer way to change the
weight given to teaching is to work at
modifying the process of appointments
and promotions itself.
I have committed myself to a study of
possible modifications, and I expect to
present for discussion some proposals
later in this academic year.
Deep cultural change of this kind
always occurs gradually, and that is
understandably disappointing to students
like my friend Jason Lewis, who (as a
fifth-year senior) hasn't got long to wait.
On the other hand, quick fixes that lack
real faculty consensus are almost certain
to be ephemeral.

Finally, let me address the fourth
source of improvement: new resources.
The Dean of Humanities and Sciences has
undertaken a series of meetings with fac
ulty in his school, where most of Stan-

ford's undergraduate instruction takes
place.
From these have evolved several pro
posals for new initiatives, which we are
now considering.
These will require additional financial
commitments; given the stringent finan
cial circumstances in which we find our
selves this year, we must find new sources
of support if we are to make them.
This effort is well under way, and I
hope we will have some important and
welcome news on this subject later in the
fall quarter.
In short, this effort is one that will
require some patience. Just about a dozen
regular academic weeks have elapsed
since my address to the faculty, and this is
a big place with a lot of inertia.
But watch this space, as they say, for
further developments. It is perfectly
appropriate to demand that results
should follow rhetoric; but those who
judge should also recognize the degree of
difficulty, and allow time for change.

Donald Kennedy is the president of Stan
ford University.
