## Cardinal women help playoff hopes with 1-0 win 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford and California met at
the women's soccer crossroads
yesterday, and when the intersec
tion cleared, the up-and-coming
Cardinal was still on track after a
1-0 victory.
In a game that all but elimi
nated No. 16 Cal from the playoff
hunt and solidified No. 11 Stan
ford's hopes, sophomore Julie
Foudy scored early in the first half
and the Cardinal sunk in its fin
gernails, holding on for the Mal
oney Field win.

By beating its traditionally
tough cross-bay rivals, Stanford,
now 8-2, signaled it is a strong
choice for the NCAA tournament.
The Bears, 6-4-1, illustrated that
their young squad is sorely miss
ing their veterans of the past. Last
year at California the teams tied
0-0.
"With our admissions stan
dards and all our obstacles, it's
great to finally be considered a
contender instead of a patsy," said
Stanford coach Berhane Andeber
han.
"Traditionally they have been a
better team," Andeberhan contin-

ued. "This year I think we're at
least on even terms."
Foudy tallied her team-leading
ninth goal of the season just 15:41
into the game, on a screaming
right-footer into the top-right cor
ner. Sweeper Heather Mclntyre
crossed a free kick into the left
corner, where freshman fullback
Glynnis Roberts dribbled it out

and centered the assist to Foudy.
Foudy fired from 20 yards,
scoring her fifth goal in the last
four games.
Stanford outshot Cal 6-5 in the
second half, but Andeberhan
called off the attack after inter
mission, making sure his club
held on to its lead. Saturday's 2-1
loss to No. 1 Santa Clara, when
the Cardinal led 1-0 at the half,
was fresh on his mind.
"It wasn't bad. In the second
half we had to play carefully. We
could not play without caution,
like against Santa Clara," he
added. "And, as an exchange, we

had to attack short-handed for the
second half."
Stanford couldn't have been
blamed for looking over its shoul
der after Saturday's disappointing
loss to Santa Clara. But the Cardi
nal was at its sharpest in the first
half.
"I'm really excited and kind of
exhausted," said dynamic fresh
man Anita Koshy, who started at
midfield and played the entire
game. "It says a lot that we lost to
Santa Clara and then came out
pretty pumped up against Cal. It's
really special to beat these guys."
Things got scrappy in the sec
ond half as the Bears tried to mus
cle their way back into the game.
With Cal'B persistent attack and
the wilting heat, Andeberhan sub
stituted for starters Denise Den
ney and Jennifer Rowland, replac
ing them with sophomore Leni
Nonoshita and senior Jen
Bloomer.
"We were working so hard,"
Andeberhan said. "Denise (Den
ney) and Rocket (Rowland) asked
to be taken out in the second half.
They are just so unselfish. That's
just another dimension of a good
team."
"We played a whole game today
and held on to our lead," said
senior fullback Denney, still work
ing her way back from a knee
injury. "We haven't peaked yet in
our fitness, but we should for the
playoffs. I'm not in shape yet, but
I'm playing more minutes now."
While the win gives Stanford
legitimacy for the playoffs and
momentum for this weekend's
Stanford Invitational, the loss was
critical for the Bears.
"It diminishes our playoff
chances to arithmetic," Cal coach
Bill Merrell said. "If we win all our
games — who knows? But when
the odds are that long, it doesn't
do you much good to get your
hopes up. You have to be realistic
about it."
"This game was crucial for
them and it was crucial for us,"
Merrell said. "They happened to
win 1-0."
"The winner of today's game
has a little edge on the playoffs,"
echoed Andeberhan, whose team
is next scheduled to play Texas
Christian at noon, Saturday.
"Realistically, we have to beat the
rest of the teams in our region and
split against the other contenders.
Today we solidified our hold on
the third-place position in the
West."

But things weren't as easy as
they could have been in the second
half against the pesky Bears, who
started five freshmen and only
two seniors against Stanford.
Midfielder Jennifer Dickinson
rolled a dangerous shot past the
Stanford goal, with eight minutes
left, after a lead pass got over the
head of Roberts.
With just over five minutes left,
Mclntyre lowered the boom on a
Bear invader just outside the
penalty box, but the ensuing free
kick was deflected off Stanford's
quickly-erected human wall.
But the best indicator of the
second-half intensity was the yel
low card earned by Andeberhan
after he not-so-subtly called the
referee a "gutless idiot" for a non
call on a breakaway by Sarah
Rafanelli. After the game, he
berated a linesman who had been
late or missed several offside calls.
"I was really wondering if he
was going to give the game away,
so I thought I would get his atten
tion," said Andeberhan. "I didn't
really mean to get a yellow card,
but I think they called it a little
closer after that."
For the game, Stanford out
shot Cal 10-8, with Foudy — as
usual — leading with six
attempts. The Stanford defense
kept Cal's potent midfielder,
Valerie Pope, tied up and away
from the goal, and she was little
factor around the net. Stanford
goalie Elise Edrwards recorded
her fifth shutout of the year.
"Stanford is very talented, and
if you don't play well for 45 min
utes then you're playing catch-up.
And that is very difficult," said
Merrell. "They got a quick goal
and then they held their own."
"I'm a Stanford graduate and I
wish them all the luck, but I really
don't enjoy talking about other
team's playoff chances," Merrell
said. "Santa Clara was one goal
better than they are, but they
(Stanford) are a good team and
they will hold their own."

Stanford couldn't have been
blamed for looking over its shoul
der after Saturday's disappointing
loss to Santa Clara. But the Cardi
nal was at its sharpest in the first
half.
"I'm really excited and kind of
exhausted," said dynamic fresh
man Anita Koshy, who started at
midfield and played the entire
game. "It says a lot that we lost to
Santa Clara and then came out
pretty pumped up against Cal. It's
really special to beat these guys."
Things got scrappy in the sec
ond half as the Bears tried to mus
cle their way back into the game.
With Cal'B persistent attack and
the wilting heat, Andeberhan sub
stituted for starters Denise Den
ney and Jennifer Rowland, replac
ing them with sophomore Leni
Nonoshita and senior Jen
Bloomer.
"We were working so hard,"
Andeberhan said. "Denise (Den
ney) and Rocket (Rowland) asked
to be taken out in the second half.
They are just so unselfish. That's
just another dimension of a good
team."
"We played a whole game today
and held on to our lead," said
senior fullback Denney, still work
ing her way back from a knee
injury. "We haven't peaked yet in
our fitness, but we should for the
playoffs. I'm not in shape yet, but
I'm playing more minutes now."
While the win gives Stanford
legitimacy for the playoffs and
momentum for this weekend's
Stanford Invitational, the loss was
critical for the Bears.
"It diminishes our playoff
chances to arithmetic," Cal coach
Bill Merrell said. "If we win all our
games — who knows? But when
the odds are that long, it doesn't
do you much good to get your
hopes up. You have to be realistic
about it."
"This game was crucial for
them and it was crucial for us,"
Merrell said. "They happened to
win 1-0."
"The winner of today's game
has a little edge on the playoffs,"
echoed Andeberhan, whose team
is next scheduled to play Texas
Christian at noon, Saturday.
"Realistically, we have to beat the
rest of the teams in our region and
split against the other contenders.
Today we solidified our hold on
the third-place position in the
West."

But things weren't as easy as
they could have been in the second
half against the pesky Bears, who
started five freshmen and only
two seniors against Stanford.
Midfielder Jennifer Dickinson
rolled a dangerous shot past the
Stanford goal, with eight minutes
left, after a lead pass got over the
head of Roberts.
With just over five minutes left,
Mclntyre lowered the boom on a
Bear invader just outside the
penalty box, but the ensuing free
kick was deflected off Stanford's
quickly-erected human wall.
But the best indicator of the
second-half intensity was the yel
low card earned by Andeberhan
after he not-so-subtly called the
referee a "gutless idiot" for a non
call on a breakaway by Sarah
Rafanelli. After the game, he
berated a linesman who had been
late or missed several offside calls.
"I was really wondering if he
was going to give the game away,
so I thought I would get his atten
tion," said Andeberhan. "I didn't
really mean to get a yellow card,
but I think they called it a little
closer after that."
For the game, Stanford out
shot Cal 10-8, with Foudy — as
usual — leading with six
attempts. The Stanford defense
kept Cal's potent midfielder,
Valerie Pope, tied up and away
from the goal, and she was little
factor around the net. Stanford
goalie Elise Edrwards recorded
her fifth shutout of the year.
"Stanford is very talented, and
if you don't play well for 45 min
utes then you're playing catch-up.
And that is very difficult," said
Merrell. "They got a quick goal
and then they held their own."
"I'm a Stanford graduate and I
wish them all the luck, but I really
don't enjoy talking about other
team's playoff chances," Merrell
said. "Santa Clara was one goal
better than they are, but they
(Stanford) are a good team and
they will hold their own."

Forward Elizabeth Joneschild steps In to win a ball against California at Maloney Field yesterday. Julie Foudy scored her fifth goal in the last
four games to pace No. 11 Stanford to a 1-0 victory over the 16th-ranked Golden Bears.
Stanford and California met at
the women's soccer crossroads
yesterday, and when the intersec
tion cleared, the up-and-coming
Cardinal was still on track after a
1-0 victory.
In a game that all but elimi
nated No. 16 Cal from the playoff
hunt and solidified No. 11 Stan
ford's hopes, sophomore Julie
Foudy scored early in the first half
and the Cardinal sunk in its fin
gernails, holding on for the Mal
oney Field win.

By beating its traditionally
tough cross-bay rivals, Stanford,
now 8-2, signaled it is a strong
choice for the NCAA tournament.
The Bears, 6-4-1, illustrated that
their young squad is sorely miss
ing their veterans of the past. Last
year at California the teams tied
0-0.
"With our admissions stan
dards and all our obstacles, it's
great to finally be considered a
contender instead of a patsy," said
Stanford coach Berhane Andeber
han.
"Traditionally they have been a
better team," Andeberhan contin-

ued. "This year I think we're at
least on even terms."
Foudy tallied her team-leading
ninth goal of the season just 15:41
into the game, on a screaming
right-footer into the top-right cor
ner. Sweeper Heather Mclntyre
crossed a free kick into the left
corner, where freshman fullback
Glynnis Roberts dribbled it out

and centered the assist to Foudy.
Foudy fired from 20 yards,
scoring her fifth goal in the last
four games.
Stanford outshot Cal 6-5 in the
second half, but Andeberhan
called off the attack after inter
mission, making sure his club
held on to its lead. Saturday's 2-1
loss to No. 1 Santa Clara, when
the Cardinal led 1-0 at the half,
was fresh on his mind.
"It wasn't bad. In the second
half we had to play carefully. We
could not play without caution,
like against Santa Clara," he
added. "And, as an exchange, we

had to attack short-handed for the
second half."
