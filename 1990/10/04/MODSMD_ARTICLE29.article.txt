# A 						mascot by any other name

About 20 years ago, the Stanford
Indians started the long and
painful transition to the Stan
ford Cardinal. Many of you know the
story: the Stanford community
decided that the nickname "Indians"
is offensive to the Native American
community and felt that a change was
in order.
Many of you also know that Stan
ford did not suddenly become the Car
dinal. Rather, there was a time when
the Stanford football squad was
known as the Cardinals (the birds not
the color), the Thunder Chickens and
the Indians at the same time.
During the John Ralston era, the
football team's defensive squad was
known as the Thunder Chickens, a
nickname which Stanford students
seemed eager to bestow on the team as
a whole. That explains why a story
The Daily ran Jan. 31, 1972 under the
headline, "Cards Prominent in Pro
Draft Plans," contained references to
all three nicknames.
To confuse the issue even more, the
program in the early 1970s still main
tained an all-freshman team which
played similar teams throughout the
Pac-8. This team was known as the
"Papooses" and "Thunder Chicks." If
nicknames are supposed to reflect the
personality of a university, then Stan
ford was severely schizophrenic.
At the same time, Stanford played
in its last Rose Bowl in 1971. 18 sea
sons later, the now Cardinal has
appeared in only three other bowls.
The end of the Indians was the end of
an era.
Sheer coincidence? I don't think so.
Thomas Jefferson said a country
needs a good revolution every 10 years
or so. It's time for the fans to revolt.
We need a new nickname.
And quess what? I've got a few sug
gestions.
Nicknames of the 600 or so four
year colleges and universities in the
U.S. cover every imaginable type of
mascot possible and several that are
not. As a rule, particularly violent or
strong animals are preferable. Colors
as a preceding adjective to your
school's nickname are great, but adjec
tives like "fightin*" and "mauradin'"
are choice.
In the NCAA there are traditionals
nicknames like Bears, Lions, Tigers,
Wildcats, Bearcats, Bruins, Eagles,

Falcons, Hawks, Panthers, Bulldogs
and Rams. Then there are some not
so-traditional animal nicknames.
There are Seawolves, Humpback
Whales, Dolphins, Sailfish, Marlins,
Ravens (the Ravin' Ravens?), Polar
Bears, Mules, Anteaters, Stags, Owls,
the Mongoose, Thorobreds, Thorough
breds, Antelope, Leopards, Kangaroos,
Moles, Ospreys, Stormy Petrels,
Hurons, Gorillas, Sagehens, Lynx,
Pumas, Horned Frogs, Chanticleers,
Fighting Camels and, my favorite, the
Fighting Blue Hens.
If you like dogs, there are Terriers,
Salukis, Retrievers and Great Danes.
Then there are insects. There are
Weevils, Banana Slugs (not actually an
insect, but icky nonetheless), Spiders
and Fighting Bees.
There are animals that aren't.
There are Golden Griffins, Mastodons,
Dragons, Centaurs and Trolls.
Professions seem to be popular
choices as well. There are Seasiders,
Keelhaulers, Mariners, Anchormen,
Sailors, Midshipmen, Captains, Com
modores, Vikings, Pirates, Buccaneers
and Corsairs. If you like a military
theme, there are Cadets, Soldiers,
Swordsmen, Lancers, Archers,
Grenadiers, Cannoneers, Colonels and
Generals. There are Builders, Engi
neers, Lumberjacks, Foresters, Rail
splitters, Magicians, Rivermen,
Plainsmen, Miners, Orediggers, Profs,
Regents, Judges, Moundbuilders and
Hatters.
If power lunches are your thing,
how about the Statesmen, Senators,
Ambassadors and Presidents? For roy
alty, there are the Kingsmen, the
Lords, the Barons and the Monarchs.
If you'd prefer something a little more
pious there are Parsons, Preachers,
Bishops, Prophets, Deacons, Fightin'
Christians, Battling Bishops, Demon
Deacons and Fighting Parsons.
There are Defenders and Con
querors, Missionaries and Savages,
Rifles and Bullets, Saints and Vandals,

Trojans, Spartans and Argonauts.
If you adhere to the Notre Dame
theory of nicknames, there are the
Norse, Swedes, Scots, Britcns, Saxons,
Flying Dutchmen and Hustlin' Quak
ers.
Trees are acceptable, as evidenced
by the Sycamores of Indiana State and
the Mighty Oaks of Oakland City Col
lege (in Oakland City, Ind.)
Natural phenomena are okay as
well. The Tornadoes, Hurricanes,
Golden Hurricanes, Golden Torna
does, Waves, Red Flash, Green Wave,
Prairie Stars, and the Northern Lights
are all currently taken, but Temblors
is available as far as I know.
Then there are the nicknames that
are simply inexplicable. The teams
from Arkansas Tech are known as the
Wonder Boys. Knox College of Illinois
goes by the name "Siwash", which
Webster's Third New International
Dictionary defines as "a small, usually
inland college that is notably provin
cial in outlook." Descriptive but hardly
fear inspiring.
Williams College goes by the Ephs,
for which I can find no definition. Web
ster State of Missouri has the colorful
but undefinable nickname of the Gor
loks.
My personal favorite nickname of
them all, however, is the Evergreen
State College Geoducks. This small
Olympia, Wash., school choose this
mascot (pronounced GOOEY-duck)
because it is indigenous to the Pacific
Northwest. Webster's describes the
Geoduck as a "very large edible clam
that weighs over five pounds, has
siphons which when fully extended
measure several feet in length and
cannot be withdrawn into the shell."
As I learned on a recent trip to Seat
tle, the Geoduck buries itself while
only its siphon extends above the mud.
I'll leave it to your imagination to fig
ure out what that siphon looks like.
Score one for the students at Ever
green State.
Well, you now know the full range
of possible new nicknames to help get
the Stanford football program back on
track. Together we can come up with
something like the Geoducks. Let me
know what ideas you have.
Stanford Daily Guru-At-Large and
sports writer Mark Rogowsky is cam
paigning for the name "the Screaming
Pelicans." I like it.
Crush 'em Pelicans.
