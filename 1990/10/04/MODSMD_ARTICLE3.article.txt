# Entrepreneurs launch lofty new enterprise
## 
### Larissa Thompson 
A new entrepreneurial trend is sweeping
campus even faster than gourmet granola —
loft selling.
Sophomores Joe Kraus and John Mcßitchie,
power saws in hand, operate their business out
of Arroyo House. Meanwhile, juniors Hazim
Ansari, Joseph Williams and Patrick Lin com
prise the business "Lofty Beds," based off cam
pus.
Kraus and Mcßitchie said they first consid
ered starting a loft-selling business last spring.
Both had built lofts for themselves and had
worked at construction jobs over the summer.
The "Lofty Beds" crew had built some lofts
for their own apartment this summer and
decided to offer their new-found expertise to
fellow students.
Kraus and Mcßitchie said their endeavor
did not require much detailed planning. After
drawing up several possible designs, they met
over the summer to build prototypes and work
out an efficient method of assembly
Arriving on campus a week before classes
started, Mcßitchie said they simply "posted
fliers, then sat back and waited to see what
would happen."
Hoping not to overextend themselves,
Ansari, Williams and Lin planned for a limited
business. They had a professional carpenter
draw up their design and established an off
campus workshop. To test the demand for pre
made lofts, they also posted fliers, placed an ad
in The Daily and set up a stand in White Plaza.
Each of Kraus and Mcßitchie's lofts
requires approximately one-and-a-half hours
of wood preparation, and then one-half hour of
assembly in the room.
They have sold a total of twenty-two lofts in
what has been a "not extremely profitable"
business. "Lofty Beds," on the other hand,
refused to reveal sales figures.
They have assembled lofts on the
Row and in Wilbur and Stern
Halls. .
Kraus and Mcßitchie's busi
ness so far has been absorbing
only "reasonable amounts of
time." They have been putting up
about two lofts per night.
However, Kraus added they
are no longer taking orders
because "we're not at Stanford
just to build lofts."
Freshman Risa Hoffman was
the first student in Larkin House
to purchase a loft from Kraus
and Mcßitchie. She opted for
their business because they
offered to disassemble and store
the bed the University provided
for her.
"As soon as I saw my room this
year, I knew I had brought too
much stuff," Hoffman says."I
had one (square) foot of floor
space. All of my things were
stacked everywhere." So, to make
more space, she looked into the
option of buying a loft.
When asked whether she was
concerned about the safety of her
loft during an earthquake, Hoff
man replied that because she is
from southern California, she is
accustomed to earthquakes. "I've
never been thrown out of bed at
home."
However, she did ask Kraus
and Mcßitchie about the earth
quake factor when they came to
assemble her loft. Hoffman says
her only worry now is clambering
down from her loft for fire drills.
"These lofts won't fall down.
Wood bends more than concrete,"
Mcßitchie said with confidence.
Ansari said no potential cus
tomers brought up this concern
with "Lofty Beds."
Kraus and Mcßitchie sink
each mattress into the frame,
and double-bolt each joint.
"These beds are up to code,"
Mcßitchie asserted.
Last year, Stanford estab
lished safety requirements for all
lofts: they are not allowed to be
nailed down to the floor or walls,
cover more than one-third of a
room's floor space or block fire
sprinklers.
"It wasn't that hard to get
around Stanford's loft require
ments. It was mostly a matter of
just positioning the lofts,"
quipped Ansari.
Sophomore Srinivas Kumar,
Kraus's roommate, sleeps on a
"Kraus-Mcßitchie" loft.
Extremely enthusiastic about
the business venture, Kumar's
only complaint is that he some
times hits his head on the loft
from underneath. "You get used
to hitting your head on things,"
he said.
Asked about problems he has
run into, Kraus related the time
he accidentally squashed a spider
with a hammer.
The two have experienced
problems with their computer fil
ing system, and most recently
Kraus had his drill stolen.
"People keep taking our scrap
(wood)," Kraus complained. "I
don't know. We wake up every
morning to less wood."
Ansari, Williams and Lin tried
to anticipate any problems but
say they have not run into any
thing unusual.
At one point "Lofty Beds"
offered to merge with Kraus and
Mcßitchie because the former
business thought it would be eas
ier to meet the large demand that
way.
Both businesses have stopped
taking orders, so they have
decided to wait until next year to
see about joining forces. Kraus
and Mcßitchie said they are cer
tain to continue selling lofts next
year, although Ansari was hesi
tant.
"Having a business took a lot
of innovation that you're not
used to when you are used to
dealing with problem sets,"
Ansari explained.
However, the ever-enthusias
tic Mcßitchie exclaimed, "We
want to see a wood-working and
shop mtyor at Stanford."

decided to wait until next year to
see about joining forces. Kraus
and Mcßitchie said they are cer
tain to continue selling lofts next
year, although Ansari was hesi
tant.
"Having a business took a lot
of innovation that you're not
used to when you are used to
dealing with problem sets,"
Ansari explained.
However, the ever-enthusias
tic Mcßitchie exclaimed, "We
want to see a wood-working and
shop mtyor at Stanford."
A new entrepreneurial trend is sweeping
campus even faster than gourmet granola —
loft selling.
Sophomores Joe Kraus and John Mcßitchie,
power saws in hand, operate their business out
of Arroyo House. Meanwhile, juniors Hazim
Ansari, Joseph Williams and Patrick Lin com
prise the business "Lofty Beds," based off cam
pus.
Kraus and Mcßitchie said they first consid
ered starting a loft-selling business last spring.
Both had built lofts for themselves and had
worked at construction jobs over the summer.
The "Lofty Beds" crew had built some lofts
for their own apartment this summer and
decided to offer their new-found expertise to
fellow students.
Kraus and Mcßitchie said their endeavor
did not require much detailed planning. After
drawing up several possible designs, they met
over the summer to build prototypes and work
out an efficient method of assembly
Arriving on campus a week before classes
started, Mcßitchie said they simply "posted
fliers, then sat back and waited to see what
would happen."
Hoping not to overextend themselves,
Ansari, Williams and Lin planned for a limited
business. They had a professional carpenter
draw up their design and established an off
campus workshop. To test the demand for pre
made lofts, they also posted fliers, placed an ad
in The Daily and set up a stand in White Plaza.
Each of Kraus and Mcßitchie's lofts
requires approximately one-and-a-half hours
of wood preparation, and then one-half hour of
assembly in the room.
They have sold a total of twenty-two lofts in
what has been a "not extremely profitable"
business. "Lofty Beds," on the other hand,
refused to reveal sales figures.
They have assembled lofts on the
Row and in Wilbur and Stern
Halls. .
Kraus and Mcßitchie's busi
ness so far has been absorbing
only "reasonable amounts of
time." They have been putting up
about two lofts per night.
However, Kraus added they
are no longer taking orders
because "we're not at Stanford
just to build lofts."
Freshman Risa Hoffman was
the first student in Larkin House
to purchase a loft from Kraus
and Mcßitchie. She opted for
their business because they
offered to disassemble and store
the bed the University provided
for her.
"As soon as I saw my room this
year, I knew I had brought too
much stuff," Hoffman says."I
had one (square) foot of floor
space. All of my things were
stacked everywhere." So, to make
more space, she looked into the
option of buying a loft.
When asked whether she was
concerned about the safety of her
loft during an earthquake, Hoff
man replied that because she is
from southern California, she is
accustomed to earthquakes. "I've
never been thrown out of bed at
home."
However, she did ask Kraus
and Mcßitchie about the earth
quake factor when they came to
assemble her loft. Hoffman says
her only worry now is clambering
down from her loft for fire drills.
"These lofts won't fall down.
Wood bends more than concrete,"
Mcßitchie said with confidence.
Ansari said no potential cus
tomers brought up this concern
with "Lofty Beds."
Kraus and Mcßitchie sink
each mattress into the frame,
and double-bolt each joint.
"These beds are up to code,"
Mcßitchie asserted.
Last year, Stanford estab
lished safety requirements for all
lofts: they are not allowed to be
nailed down to the floor or walls,
cover more than one-third of a
room's floor space or block fire
sprinklers.
"It wasn't that hard to get
around Stanford's loft require
ments. It was mostly a matter of
just positioning the lofts,"
quipped Ansari.
Sophomore Srinivas Kumar,
Kraus's roommate, sleeps on a
"Kraus-Mcßitchie" loft.
Extremely enthusiastic about
the business venture, Kumar's
only complaint is that he some
times hits his head on the loft
from underneath. "You get used
to hitting your head on things,"
he said.
Asked about problems he has
run into, Kraus related the time
he accidentally squashed a spider
with a hammer.
The two have experienced
problems with their computer fil
ing system, and most recently
Kraus had his drill stolen.
"People keep taking our scrap
(wood)," Kraus complained. "I
don't know. We wake up every
morning to less wood."
Ansari, Williams and Lin tried
to anticipate any problems but
say they have not run into any
thing unusual.
At one point "Lofty Beds"
offered to merge with Kraus and
Mcßitchie because the former
business thought it would be eas
ier to meet the large demand that
way.
Both businesses have stopped
taking orders, so they have
decided to wait until next year to
see about joining forces. Kraus
