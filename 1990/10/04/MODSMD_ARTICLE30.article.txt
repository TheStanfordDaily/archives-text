# With or without funding field hockey keeps rolling
##

Embittered by their complete loss of ath
letic funding, the Cardinal field hockey
team has begun the 1990 season with a
huge chip on its shoulder.
"I guess you could say that we're on a
mission this year," said tri-captain Caroline
Clevenger. "No one (on the team) felt that
such severe cuts were deserved."
This was not the first time that field
hockey suffered economic setbacks. In
1986, the athletic department lowered the
budget of the team from $25,000 to $5,000.
This figure had been slowly increased over
the past few years, before the big cut this
summer. The team, while remaining on the
Varsity Division I level, is officially classed
as "Varsity 3."
Translation: no financial support.
The results of this move were felt most
deeply by veteran coach Sheryl Johnson.
Johnson, a three-time Olympian herself,
lost her coach's salary, and was also laid off
from her part-time teaching job. Now work
ing as a teacher and coach at a nearby
school, she and her assistant, Suzanne Doi,
are volunteering their time to the women
this year.
These discouraging developments off the
field have not deterred on-field activities.
The Cardinal is currently undefeated in
NorPac conference play, conquering

University of the Pacific, 3-1, Chico State,
1-0, and California by a 3-1 tally. In addi
tion, Sept. 22-23, in Providence, R. 1., the
team performed admirably against more
experienced eastern clubs.
They played three games, losing tough
decisions to Maine, Providence, and
Southwest Missouri State, all nationally
ranked field hockey programs.
While no big-name stars dominate the
roster, several upperclassmen have made
key contributions. Clevenger, a goalie, has
allowed fewer than two scores a game.
Fellow tri-captains Tricia McJennett (cen
ter halfback) and Claire Stephens (right
midfield) have both excelled at their respec
tive positions.
Even with the lack of athletic scholar
ships, key freshmen were signed for this
season. Sarah Hallock, a center forward,
has been a leading scorer all year, and
Danielle Beynett has seen quality playing
time on defense.
Clevenger sees hope for the rest of the
season. "Without injuries, a conference
championship is not out of the question."
Upcoming games include a home game
against Pacific this Saturday at noon, and
the Cal Invitational Oct. 19-21. The contest
against UOP, and all other home games,
will be played at the varsity hockey field,
located next to the south intramural fields
along El Camino.
