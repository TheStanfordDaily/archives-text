### 
BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Red Sox
won the American League East champion
ship for the third time in five years Wed
nesday night, defeating the Chicago White
Sox 3-1 on the final night of the regular
season behind the pitching of Mike Bod
dicker and Jeff Reardon.
With ace Roger Clemens sent ahead to
Toronto to rest for a possible divisional
playoff on Thursday, the Red Sox made it
academic as they won for the sixth time
in the last eight games.
Instead of pitching in the Sky Dome on
Thursday, Clemens (21-6) will face Dave
Stewart (22-11) in the opener of the best
of-seven AL playoffs Saturday night at Fen
way Park.
Boston's victory eliminated Toronto,
which began play one game out. The Blue
Jays were tied with Baltimore 2-2 in the
ninth inning when the Red Sox game ended.
That game, too, became moot.
Boddicker (17-8) scattered five hits in

seven innings and Reardon gave up two
hits in two innings for his 21st save. Bod
dicker struck out four and walked three,
and is 6-0 in his last nine starts. Boddicker's
17 victories are the most since he won a
career-high 20 games for Baltimore in
1984.
He shut out the White Sox on three
singles for six innings, then was bailed out
by left fielder Mike Greenwell's arm while
losing his shutout bid in the seventh.
The Red Sox finished with an 88-74
record.
ML notes
Detroit first baseman Cecil Fielder hit his
50th home run of the season into the upper
deck in left at Yankee Stadium. The fourth
inning shot made him only the 11th player in
Meyor League history to hit 50 or more in
season.
Fielder hit his 51st lster in the game and
finished the year with 132 RBI.
