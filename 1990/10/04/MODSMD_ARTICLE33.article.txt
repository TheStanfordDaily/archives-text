# New Stanford study:
## Canadian doctors offer more for less

Canadian doctors provide more
services per person for lower fees
than do their American counter
parts, according to a recent Stan
ford study.
The results of the research
challenge the prevailing view that
Canada maintains lower medical
fees by providing fewer services to
patients.
"Canada provides comprehen
sive, first-dollar health insurance
to all its citizens," according to
Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs and
doctoral student James Hahn, the
survey's authors.
The study, which appeared in a
recent issue of The New England
Journal of Medicine, compares the
cost per person for physicians'
services in Canada and the United
States.
"The disparity is explained in

part by much greater overhead
expenses in the United States and
in part by the lower workloads of
American procedure-oriented
physicians," the survey reported.
Americans spend 72 percent
more than Canadians on physi
cians' services, while Canadian
doctors provide 20 percent more
procedures per person than Amer
ican doctors.
"If U.S. spending could be held
to the Canadian percentage, the
savings could amount to more
than $100 billion a year," Fuchs
and Hahn concluded.
Fuchs, who is also with the
School of Medicine, offered sev
eral explanations for the results of
the study.
First, the lower demand for
physicians' services in the United
States might indicate the reluc
tance of Americans to undergo
costly, unessential procedures.

Unlike Canadians who er\joy uni
versal health coverage, American
patients may be covering more
costs on their own because they do
not have any insurance, or
because their policies fail to cover
all areas of treatment.
Second, American physicians
have a complex and costly billing
system involving both private and
public third-party payers, such as
insurance companies. This
bureaucracy partially accounts for
the estimated 16 percent of physi
cians' revenues which go to per
sonnel other than medical doc
tors.
Third, American physicians
spend more for rent and office
related amenities.
Health care expenses in the
United States presently comprise
11.5 percent of the gross national
product compared to only 9 per
cent in Canada.
