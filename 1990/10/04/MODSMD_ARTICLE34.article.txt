## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Palo Alto fest celebrates Japan's culture 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
If you lined up all the Japanese cars, stereos and
electronic equipment that Californians buy each year,
you could probably stretch a nice, if unseaworthy,
Dridge across the ocean between the Colden State and
the Land of the Rising Sun.
Fortunately, this exchange has cultural aspects to
complement the commercial. Tokyo has McDonalds
while Palo Alto gets Miyake's and the 11 th annual
Japanese Festival, the biggest celebration of its kind in
the Bay Area.
A fair swap or not, this weekend's two day festival
promises an interesting and varied view of traditional
and contemporary Japanese culture.
Probably the most spectacular exhibit is of "ukiyo
e," or "pictures of the floating world."
These painted woodblock prints took their inspira
tion from 17th century Buddhist thought, which ide
alized "living only for the moment" and, in general,
"floating along with the currents of life like a gourd
floating on the river currents."
This exhibit, which is rarely seen even in Japan, is
a series of 53 prints that artist Ando Hiroshige made
from sketches of a 300 mile journey along the Old
Tokaido Highway he made in 1853.
Another ancient art represented is origami, a style
of paper folding that began after the Japanese learned
how to make paper from the Chinese.
Vicky Mihara, an old hand at the art, will be at the
festival demonstrating traditional animals like cranes,
frogs as well as more complex figures such as insects
and flowers.
The less handy may enjoy the Hanagasa Ondo
Dance Group. This kimono-clad troupe is famous all
over Japan for its rendering of safflower picking and
planting rice seedlings.
This dance supposedly evolved from a folk song
peasants chanted when packing down the earth before
they built their houses on it.
The martial at heart may get a kick out of the judo
show, while a demonstration of the Suzuki method
may strike a familiar chord with musicians who
learned to play using this imitative technique.
Bonsai enthusiasts and budding flower arrangers
can dig up new ideas from an exhibit of the dwarf trees
and a demonstration of the ikebana technique.
And in addition to numerous outdoor food booths
that will replenish weary festival-goers, there will be a
drawing for round trips for two to Japan and to
Germany, a Nintendo action set and many other
prizes. Tickets are $2 each.
Many other demonstrations and exhibits are sched
uled for this less-technical view of Japan. Anyone
interested in crossing that ever-growing bridge across
the Pacific should enjoy this weekend's festival.
