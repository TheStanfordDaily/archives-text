# FESTIVAL 2000:
## City's cultures converge for 23-day arts festival 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
With 1,000
artists, 54 events
and 200 perfor
mances and exhi-

bitions, you might think the organizers
of San Francisco's Festival 2000 would
boast about their statistical successes.
But there's something more important
going on here than numbers.
Culture is the centerpiece of the 23-
day festival, but it's not just one culture.
With contemporary work by African-

American, Chicano/Latino, Asian-American, Pacif
ic Islander and Native American artists, the festival
hopes to be the largest ever celebration of multicul-

tural arts — as well
as a glimpse of
what's in store for
America's more div
erse future.
This is one of
those events you
just don't want to
miss.
"We want to in
crease the commu
nity's consciousness
of multiculturalism
in America," Execu
tive Director Lennie
Sloan said in a press
conference yester
day."(We hope the
festival) is a new
bridge for going over
the millenium line."
The festival
crossed several mil
lenia in cost — over
$2.5 million gener-

ated from a San Francisco Hotel Tax fund, art foun
dation grants and corporate and private donations.
That money has enabled organizers to assemble the
large cast in the mega-production, as well as com
mission 27 new art pieces for the festival itself.

While many of the artists may not
encounter overwhelming name recognition
in the general public, most are
leaders in their fields or on
the cutting edge of new art.
But

the reason they were chosen
to participate in the festival is
their expression of culture,
whether a reflection of their
own background or a fusion
of many cultures.
As Sloan put it, "Festival
2000 is about each one of us
seeing our own image in the
American dream. The festi
val belongs to all of us."
After 18 months of prepa
ration, the festival will kick
off Saturday night with a
foot-stomping Sole Night: A

Celebration of Foot, Hand and Drum. The event,
beginning at 7:30 p.m. at the War Memorial Opera
House, will include the legendary dancer and chore
ographer Katherine Dunham, the American Indian
Dance Theater, the Muntu Dance Theater of
Chicago, Chitresh Das, Danceßrazil and the
acclaimed New York-based dance theater group,
Urban Bush Women.
The Festival's closing will be just as brilliant,
launching the 1990 Jazz in the City celebration on
October 29. Featured will be the Hieroglyphics
Ensemble with guest artist Don Cherry, Brazilian
singer Nana Vasconcelos, ensemble leader Pete
Apfelbaum and percussionist Frank Ekeh.
Other signature events that will happen between
include:
• The Northern California premiere of The
Gospel at Colonus, a modern adaptation of the
Oeaipus legend set in an African-American church
and featuring several great gospel artists. The per
formance simultaneously opens the 1990-91 sea
son of the American Conservatory Theatre, in part
nership with the Oakland Ensemble Theatre.
• "Bringing It All Back Home," a concert of
fusion music and jazz at Davies Symphony Hall on
October 14, co-hosted by Danny Glover and Pete
Escovedo and featuring a cappella greats Take 6, the
Oakland Youth Chorus and Bobby McFerrin's Voic
estra.
• A two-day mini-film festival hosted by celebrat
ed black filmmaker Gordon Parks on Oct. 16 and
17 at the Kabuki Theater.
• The biggest-ever light and sound show in San
Francisco October 18 and 19 at the newly

expanded Moscone Center. San Francis
co's acclaimed Multi-Image Show-

case arts group presents the world

premiere of "Moscone Sur-

faces: An Image & Light

Celebration."

• Joyful Noise, a
series of weekend
events in streets,
parks and schools,
featuring gospel
singing, sizzling
samba, zydeco
and traditional

African and Native American rhythms.
• Club Spuntioo, a transformed version of
Spuntino Restaurant, that will feature artists like
Street Sounds and Carlos Santana to keep the cele
bration going after most events are completed.
Most of the events will occur in San Francisco,
with some happening in the East Bay and one at
Stanford. (This Sunday at 3 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, the American Indian Dance Theater
will perform as part of a week-long series of events
celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Stanford
American Indian Organization.)
Many other events will have the energy, if not the
billing, of those listed above. And as Diane Ferlat
te's entrancing mixture of song and story at the
press conference proved, even the most subtle arts
are well worth seeing.
It's always difficult to imagine how 18 months of
work will pan out in a 23-day festival. But, as Sloan
says, festival organizers hope to "turn magic into
light in the days to come."

schedules of events, call the
Festival 2000 hotline at 255-

ment line at 392-1037.

The next 23 days will feature a myriad of multicultural performances,
including (clockwise from upper left): Danceßrazll, dance legend
Katharine Dunham, a capella greats Take Six, more Danceßrazll, the
American Indian Dance Theater and acclaimed dance troupe Urban
Bush Women.

Spuntino Restaurant, that will feature artists like
Street Sounds and Carlos Santana to keep the cele
bration going after most events are completed.
Most of the events will occur in San Francisco,
with some happening in the East Bay and one at
Stanford. (This Sunday at 3 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, the American Indian Dance Theater
will perform as part of a week-long series of events
celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Stanford
American Indian Organization.)
Many other events will have the energy, if not the
billing, of those listed above. And as Diane Ferlat
te's entrancing mixture of song and story at the
press conference proved, even the most subtle arts
are well worth seeing.
It's always difficult to imagine how 18 months of
work will pan out in a 23-day festival. But, as Sloan
says, festival organizers hope to "turn magic into
light in the days to come."

For information and daily
schedules of events, call the
Festival 2000 hotline at 255-
2665 or the KKSF entertain
ment line at 392-1037.

The next 23 days will feature a myriad of multicultural performances,
including (clockwise from upper left): Danceßrazll, dance legend
Katharine Dunham, a capella greats Take Six, more Danceßrazll, the
American Indian Dance Theater and acclaimed dance troupe Urban
Bush Women.







With 1,000
artists, 54 events
and 200 perfor
mances and exhi-

bitions, you might think the organizers
of San Francisco's Festival 2000 would
boast about their statistical successes.
But there's something more important
going on here than numbers.
Culture is the centerpiece of the 23-
day festival, but it's not just one culture.
With contemporary work by African-

American, Chicano/Latino, Asian-American, Pacif
ic Islander and Native American artists, the festival
hopes to be the largest ever celebration of multicul-

tural arts — as well
as a glimpse of
what's in store for
America's more div
erse future.
This is one of
those events you
just don't want to
miss.
"We want to in
crease the commu
nity's consciousness
of multiculturalism
in America," Execu
tive Director Lennie
Sloan said in a press
conference yester
day."(We hope the
festival) is a new
bridge for going over
the millenium line."
The festival
crossed several mil
lenia in cost — over
$2.5 million gener-

ated from a San Francisco Hotel Tax fund, art foun
dation grants and corporate and private donations.
That money has enabled organizers to assemble the
large cast in the mega-production, as well as com
mission 27 new art pieces for the festival itself.

While many of the artists may not
encounter overwhelming name recognition
in the general public, most are
leaders in their fields or on
the cutting edge of new art.
But

the reason they were chosen
to participate in the festival is
their expression of culture,
whether a reflection of their
own background or a fusion
of many cultures.
As Sloan put it, "Festival
2000 is about each one of us
seeing our own image in the
American dream. The festi
val belongs to all of us."
After 18 months of prepa
ration, the festival will kick
off Saturday night with a
foot-stomping Sole Night: A

Celebration of Foot, Hand and Drum. The event,
beginning at 7:30 p.m. at the War Memorial Opera
House, will include the legendary dancer and chore
ographer Katherine Dunham, the American Indian
Dance Theater, the Muntu Dance Theater of
Chicago, Chitresh Das, Danceßrazil and the
acclaimed New York-based dance theater group,
Urban Bush Women.
The Festival's closing will be just as brilliant,
launching the 1990 Jazz in the City celebration on
October 29. Featured will be the Hieroglyphics
Ensemble with guest artist Don Cherry, Brazilian
singer Nana Vasconcelos, ensemble leader Pete
Apfelbaum and percussionist Frank Ekeh.
Other signature events that will happen between
include:
• The Northern California premiere of The
Gospel at Colonus, a modern adaptation of the
Oeaipus legend set in an African-American church
and featuring several great gospel artists. The per
formance simultaneously opens the 1990-91 sea
son of the American Conservatory Theatre, in part
nership with the Oakland Ensemble Theatre.
• "Bringing It All Back Home," a concert of
fusion music and jazz at Davies Symphony Hall on
October 14, co-hosted by Danny Glover and Pete
Escovedo and featuring a cappella greats Take 6, the
Oakland Youth Chorus and Bobby McFerrin's Voic
estra.
• A two-day mini-film festival hosted by celebrat
ed black filmmaker Gordon Parks on Oct. 16 and
17 at the Kabuki Theater.
• The biggest-ever light and sound show in San
Francisco October 18 and 19 at the newly

expanded Moscone Center. San Francis
co's acclaimed Multi-Image Show-

case arts group presents the world

premiere of "Moscone Sur-

faces: An Image & Light

Celebration."

• Joyful Noise, a
series of weekend
events in streets,
parks and schools,
featuring gospel
singing, sizzling
samba, zydeco
and traditional

African and Native American rhythms.
• Club Spuntioo, a transformed version of
Spuntino Restaurant, that will feature artists like
Street Sounds and Carlos Santana to keep the cele
bration going after most events are completed.
