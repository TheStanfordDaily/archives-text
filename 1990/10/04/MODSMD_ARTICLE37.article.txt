Gathering the tribes
It's not quite Woodstock or Live Aid, but Bill Graham's mega
event, "A Gathering of the Tribes," should bring together the year's
most eclectic mix of musicians. Featuring Public Enemy, Iggy Pop,
Stanford favorite Indigo Girls, The Cramps, Michelle Shocked, Ice-
T, Queen Latifah and many others, the Shoreline Amphitheater
concert has something to please almost everyone. The concert
begins Saturday at noon, and remaining reserved and lawn tickets
are available for $22.50 through BASS outlets.

If you're interested in going to more than one San Francisco
Symphony Concert, or you want to team up with some friends to

today from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m., hawking their wares. Prices for the
12-concert series range from $95 to $142.
