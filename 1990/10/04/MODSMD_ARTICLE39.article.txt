## 'Terminator' true to Arnie 
### John Louie Editorial Staff 
Midway through Dark Horse Comics'
"The Terminator: Tempest" saga, the
series looks pretty slick.
The storyline, similar to the Arnold
Schwarzenegger blockbuster of the same
name, is fairly obvious, so dialogue is kept
to a minimum.
The artwork itself tells most of the
action. And the whole package is present
ed on glossy white paper, giving the comic
a nice, clean look.
But the clean style is deceiving to the
eye. Faithful to its predecessor,
"Terminator" is a quite graphically vio
lent comic book.
It wouldn't be a "Terminator" series
without mindless violence, and dozens of
poor souls, unaware of the enemy's
power, fall prey to the monstrous
machines. The creative team has success
fully maintained the gory style of the orig
inal movie in the comic book sequel.
John Arcudi's plot echoes the original
story as well. In the future, robots rule the

earth, seeking to destroy all forms of
human life.
As humans time travel into the past
with the hopes of rewriting their future,
three mechanized robots chase the rebels
through the streets of Los Angeles.
Unlike the movie, however, the series
concentrates less on the apocalyptic
future and more on the all-out action.
Chris Warner and Paul Guinan draw the
characters with well-defined, angular bod
ies, sometimes making the movement
appear stiff.
For example, all of the terminators
show little facial expression and lots of
muscle ... just like Arnold himself, who
could hardly be called an "actor."
Still, "Terminator" captures the thrill
of an action movie within its still frames.
The plot, though a little disjointed, is fair
ly suspenseful, and the artwork uses over
lapping panels to keep up with the quick
pace.
If the last two issues are as good as the
first two, Arnold will be a happy man.
And "Terminator?" It'll be back.
