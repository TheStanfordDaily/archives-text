# Stanford's new 'agent of change'
## Parker settles into her role as affirmative action officer 
### Erin Slape 
As she begins her post as Stan
ford's new affirmative action offi
cer, Sharon Parker said she will
wait to get a "better feel for this
place" before outlining any plans
for her office.
"I don't want to make specific
goals right now," Parker said in a
Friday interview with The Daily.
"They're really not for me to
decide. It's up to the people here
to decide what role affirmative
action should have."
Parker said she does not think
her office should necessarily initi
ate affirmative action goals.
Instead, she said she would prefer
others in the University to give
input on what objectives Stanford
should have in this area and how
to pursue them.
She described her job as direct
ing the pursuit of these objectives.
"I am really looking forward to
meeting people and finding out
their concerns," Parker said. She
has already met with University
President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse last week
and is in the process of meeting
each of the academic deans and
their staffs.
Parker has extensive experi
ence since the mid-1970s working
on issues affecting people of color
and women, which distinguished
her from a field of 109 applicants
during last January's search to fill
the position. She has been at
Stanford since September 21.
Parker has served as chair of
the board of directors of the
National Institute for Women of
Color, helping to promote the inte
gration of women and African-
Americans into previously closed
areas of the work force.
She has been a representative
for Girls Clubs, Inc., a national
organization of girls' groups, as

well as a consultant, program
director and lobbyist for the
American Indian National Bank,
the National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence and the
National Commission on Working
Women. In all, she has served on
the board of directors of 18 public
service organizations.
At the collegiate level, Parker

was a consultant on affirmative
action issues at George Washing
ton University, attempting to inte
grate women and blacks into its
curriculum better.

goals.
year until she returned to the
Office of Graduate Studies.
Before Burciaga held the job,
its purpose had been to assure
minorities were being hired. As
Parker takes the job, its descrip
tion has broadened.
The affirmative action officer is
a "change agent working primar
ily with faculty, managers and
employees to make Stanford a
genuinely interactive pluralistic
community," according to the
University's new job description.
To help fulfill the University's
multicultural objectives, the offi
cer works closely with the presi
dent, the provost and other offi
cials.
"With Sharon we have some
one who can bring a comprehen
sive view of what we need to
accomplish," said Burciaga, who
added that she feels Parker can
give direction for the implementa
tion of University-wide change.
According to Parker, the issue
of full integration on college cam
puses is still a difficult one. "We're
still developing a whole new way
of looking at minority issues.... I
really hope that Stanford can
become a leader in this area."
Parker lauded Stanford's "pos
itive approach" to issues of cul
tural diversity, although she was
reluctant to give her own defini
tion of multiculturalism. "I don't
think it matters how I define mul
ticulturalism. What matters is

how Stanford as a whole defines
it," Parker said.
One task Parker has set for
herself is implementing the rec
ommendations of the University
Committee on Minority Issue's
annual review panel, which were
released in September. The panel
was critical of the University for
not fulfilling the goals outlined in
the 1989 UCMI report.

'I don't think it mat
ters how I define mul
ticulturalism.'

Parker said she is currently
studying the recommendations in
order to prioritize them. In the
past, she has praised Stanford for
undertaking UCMI review.
To be effective, the Affirmative
Action Office must be free from
the budget cuts that have hit
other areas of the University,
Parker said. She added that "the
president and provost have made
it very clear that they do not want
affirmative action to suffer from
budget cuts."
Parker said she hopes to make
it clear that her door is always
open. "I want an office that wel
comes creativity. We want people
to come with suggestions, not just
problems. I want an approachable
office."
Parker is a native of Washing
ton, D.C., where her husband and
children still live.

genuinely interactive pluralistic
community," according to the
University's new job description.
To help fulfill the University's
multicultural objectives, the offi
cer works closely with the presi
dent, the provost and other offi
cials.
"With Sharon we have some
one who can bring a comprehen
sive view of what we need to
accomplish," said Burciaga, who
added that she feels Parker can
give direction for the implementa
tion of University-wide change.
According to Parker, the issue
of full integration on college cam
puses is still a difficult one. "We're
still developing a whole new way
of looking at minority issues.... I
really hope that Stanford can
become a leader in this area."
Parker lauded Stanford's "pos
itive approach" to issues of cul
tural diversity, although she was
reluctant to give her own defini
tion of multiculturalism. "I don't
think it matters how I define mul
ticulturalism. What matters is

how Stanford as a whole defines
it," Parker said.
One task Parker has set for
herself is implementing the rec
ommendations of the University
Committee on Minority Issue's
annual review panel, which were
released in September. The panel
was critical of the University for
not fulfilling the goals outlined in
the 1989 UCMI report.

'I don't think it mat
ters how I define mul
ticulturalism.'

Parker said she is currently
studying the recommendations in
order to prioritize them. In the
past, she has praised Stanford for
undertaking UCMI review.
To be effective, the Affirmative
Action Office must be free from
the budget cuts that have hit
other areas of the University,
Parker said. She added that "the
president and provost have made
it very clear that they do not want
affirmative action to suffer from
budget cuts."
Parker said she hopes to make
it clear that her door is always
open. "I want an office that wel
comes creativity. We want people
to come with suggestions, not just
problems. I want an approachable
office."
Parker is a native of Washing
ton, D.C., where her husband and
children still live.
As she begins her post as Stan
ford's new affirmative action offi
cer, Sharon Parker said she will
wait to get a "better feel for this
place" before outlining any plans
for her office.
"I don't want to make specific
goals right now," Parker said in a
Friday interview with The Daily.
"They're really not for me to
decide. It's up to the people here
to decide what role affirmative
action should have."
Parker said she does not think
her office should necessarily initi
ate affirmative action goals.
Instead, she said she would prefer
others in the University to give
input on what objectives Stanford
should have in this area and how
to pursue them.
She described her job as direct
ing the pursuit of these objectives.
"I am really looking forward to
meeting people and finding out
their concerns," Parker said. She
has already met with University
President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse last week
and is in the process of meeting
each of the academic deans and
their staffs.
Parker has extensive experi
ence since the mid-1970s working
on issues affecting people of color
and women, which distinguished
her from a field of 109 applicants
during last January's search to fill
the position. She has been at
Stanford since September 21.
Parker has served as chair of
the board of directors of the
National Institute for Women of
Color, helping to promote the inte
gration of women and African-
Americans into previously closed
areas of the work force.
She has been a representative
for Girls Clubs, Inc., a national
organization of girls' groups, as

well as a consultant, program
director and lobbyist for the
American Indian National Bank,
the National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence and the
National Commission on Working
Women. In all, she has served on
the board of directors of 18 public
service organizations.
At the collegiate level, Parker

was a consultant on affirmative
action issues at George Washing
ton University, attempting to inte
grate women and blacks into its
curriculum better.

Before Burciaga held the job,
its purpose had been to assure
minorities were being hired. As
Parker takes the job, its descrip
