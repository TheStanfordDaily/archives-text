As she begins her post as Stan
ford's new affirmative action offi
cer, Sharon Parker said she will
wait to get a "better feel for this
place" before outlining any plans
for her office.
"I don't want to make specific
goals right now," Parker said in a
Friday interview with The Daily.
"They're really not for me to
decide. It's up to the people here
to decide what role affirmative
action should have."
Parker said she does not think
her office should necessarily initi
ate affirmative action goals.
Instead, she said she would prefer
others in the University to give
input on what objectives Stanford
should have in this area and how
to pursue them.
She described her job as direct
ing the pursuit of these objectives.
"I am really looking forward to
meeting people and finding out
their concerns," Parker said. She
has already met with University
President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse last week
and is in the process of meeting
each of the academic deans and
their staffs.
Parker has extensive experi
ence since the mid-1970s working
on issues affecting people of color
and women, which distinguished
her from a field of 109 applicants
during last January's search to fill
the position. She has been at
Stanford since September 21.
Parker has served as chair of
the board of directors of the
National Institute for Women of
Color, helping to promote the inte
gration of women and African-
Americans into previously closed
areas of the work force.
She has been a representative
for Girls Clubs, Inc., a national
organization of girls' groups, as

well as a consultant, program
director and lobbyist for the
American Indian National Bank,
the National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence and the
National Commission on Working
Women. In all, she has served on
the board of directors of 18 public
service organizations.
At the collegiate level, Parker

was a consultant on affirmative
action issues at George Washing
ton University, attempting to inte
grate women and blacks into its
curriculum better.

Sharon Parker, the University's new affirmative action officer,
hopes budget cuts will not affect Stanford's affirmative action
goals.
