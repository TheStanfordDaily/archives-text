# Dear undeclared humor columnist

LATE THIS SUMMER, I took a break
from the arduous position of Col
lege Football Tfelevision Reception
Supervisor (a.k.a. Couch Potato — a vol
unteer job, no less) to read an ominous
letter from the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies. It began rather subtly:
"Dear UNDECLARED Junior..."
Go figure the rest.
In a full page of sympathetic text, I
was politely informed that although
EVERYBODY ELSE in my class already
has a major, and EVERYBODY ELSE
knows JustWhatTheyWantToDoWith-
Their Life, I should not feel worried or left
out, and — by the way — if I didn't
declare in three weeks, a certain "friend"
named Vinny knew where my family
lived.
After two years of delaying, I had
planned on choosing a major SOME time
over the summer — but I could never
seem to get beyond the, "well, it's a long
plane ride back," stage of thought.
This letter gave me that extra boost of
motivation to finally decide. Death
threats generally do that to a person.
Of course, the first step was to gather
ideas. And what better way, I thought,
than by watching these here college foot
ball games (heavy on the rationalization),
where the athlete profiles will suggest
majors that students all across the coun
try are taking?
So I flipped through the football
games, jotting down what I saw. After
five profiles, I glanced at my "page of
assorted major ideas":
General Studies.
Liberal Arts.
General Studies.
General Studies.
Liberal Arts.
Notice a trend here? Funny, so did I.
It's a "Cardinal sin" to stereotype, and
I'd hate to make any enemies who have

five times my body mass, but there's no
escaping the cold, hard truth: The
broader the shoulders, the broader the
major.
And imagine my disappointment
when I could find neither major in the
Stanford Courses and Degrees book. No
wonder our football team sucks.
But at least that says something posi
tive about our athletes' IQs: Namely,
their IQs are positive.
Unlike some universities' teams. One
Oklahoma linebacker feared he would be
sent to the Persian Gulf for military
training because he was "a major in Gen
eral Studies."
But don't call him stupid yet, or you
may not have a word for the three Ohio
State linemen who tried to satisfy their
"Liberal Arts" requirement by visiting a
Mapplethorpe exhibit.
What does one do with a "General
Studies" degree anyway? Write encyclo
pedias? Imagine the recruiter: "Yes, our
job requires a person who knows a little
of everything. Very little of everything, in
fact. And looking at your resume, Boffo, I
think you're our man!"
Then again, the problem may solve
itself: If you resort to General Studies as
a major, chances are you won't be gradu
ating anyway One wonders how much
action the Flonors Program in General
Studies gets.
But enough of this "I'm smart, thus
I'm cool" humor. At least these guys have
a major...
Light bulb over the head — I flipped
through Courses and Degrees to the sec
tion on "Independently Designed
Majors."
Anyone who's tried knows that the
real trick to designing a major at Stanford
is dreaming up a snappy subject that just
happens to require all the courses one
has done well in already.

HUMOR * Chris Harris

After scanning a list of my classes and
grades thus far, four major ideas popped
into my head:
1) Comparative Introductory Courses;
2) Chaos Theory;
3) The Elementary Economic Effects
of Buddhism upon 18th Century Cul
tures, Ideas and Pascalues in American
Film and Literature;
4) General Studies.
Needless to say, I grew skeptical. This
"Declaration of Independent" just wasn't
going to happen. Neither, it turns out,
was anything else.
After a month of scribbling and
scrawling, paging through course listings,
trying to decide JustWhatDolWant-
ToDoWithMy-LifeAnyway (Gosh, we
really do sound like our parents!!, I'm
still writing "Und." on all my forms.
Undecided. Undeclared. Under increas
ing pressure.
But frankly, my readei; I don't give a
damn.
After all, my family just moved to
Switzerland, which should delay Vinny
for a while.
In the meantime, I'll enjoy my free
dom. And when the time is right, I'll
declare some cheesy Liberal Arts majoi;
or perhaps design my own, with a title
like "Courses Chris Harris Enjoyed."
Oops. I can feel my shoulders widen
ing already. Dennis Green may even call
me soon. After all, how could he resist a
man with "Major: Harris" on his tran
script?

Chris Harris is (drum roll) an undeclared
junior. His column will appear biweekly,
which in this case means every other
week, alternating with the works of Paul
Grubb and Daniel Kronenfeld.
