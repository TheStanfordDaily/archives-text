Before coming back to the Farm —
during a 10-year "leave" — I worked as
a recording engineer, producer, session
musician and label executive. In addi
tion to loving music, I've always been
interested in how records are made.
An understanding of some "behind
the scenes" stuff has enhanced my
enjoyment of music listening, just as
understanding something about the pro
cesses of movie creation and painting
have enriched my enjoyment of them.
I'll use this space, roughly every
other week, to write about music tech
nology in the broadest sense.
Home listening is the subject of this
week's column, prompted by the Audio
Engineering Society's 89th convention
in Los Angeles, Sept. 21-25.
Roland Corporation (makers of syn
thesizers and signal processing gear)
showcased a device that creates a true
three-dimensional listening experience
through two ordinary speakers.
As you face the speakers, some
sounds surround you, swirl in back of
you, spiral up toward the ceiling back
into the front.
Those into audio esoterica may be
familiar with binaural, a recording tech
nique involving the placement of micro
phones where the dummy's ears would
be. During playback on headphones, the
listener experiences the sensation of
being in the center of a sphere with
sound coming from all around.

I have a particularly startling sample
of this on a CD on which a haircut was
recorded. You hear the scissors go to the
back of your head, up to the top and
finally come around the front to finish
off your bangs.
Binaural is old, but it never caught on
because listening to things on head
phones is essentially anti-social.
The reason it works on headphones
and not on speakers is that there is no
crosstalk in headphones, meaning sim
ply that the output from the left head
phone goes solely to the left ear, and sim
ilarly for the right side.
What Roland has done is use digital
algorithms to cancel out all of the
crosstalk information from the speaker
on the opposite side of the stereo field,
creating a highly polarized soundscape
even through speakers.
Currently, it takes a mainframe to
perform all of the necessary calculations
in real time, but the company is in the
process of designing and etching
microchips to do this specialized task.
The device will be made available to
engineers in professional studios to use
during recording, so that consumers will
have nothing extra to buy.
So don't be surprised if by 1994, the
new Cure record will have vocals coming
down at you from off the ceiling, or if the
next Paul Simon record puts the listener
in the center of a circle of Brazilian per
cussionists.
