# Living Colour cuts a rougher edge
## 
### 
Time's Up
Living Colour
So the album opens with the obligato
ry environmental tune present on every
record of the '90s. So there's more
screaming guitar than swinging rhythm.
So what?
Living Colour is the prototypical
nuclear rock band, with a singer, gui
tarist, bass guitarist and drummer.
And just when you think this album is
headed for a meltdown, Corey Glover
comes through with a soothing vocal or
Vernon Reid shows up with a melodious
guitar hook.
While "Time's Up" may not draw the
pop audience as quickly as the band's
rookie effort, the album will turn some
heads.
Replacing a suggestive social commen
tary with an angry, but hopeful look at
the nation's status, Living Colour has
developed a sharper edge — one that
sometimes cuts too deep, but usually gets
the point across.
"Elvis Is Dead" mixes that negative
energy with the stinging sounds of James
Brown's saxophonist Maceo Parker;
"Pride" drives under Reid's guitar and
Glover's biting lyrical delivery; and
"Under Cover of Darkness" throws in a
Queen Latifah rap for good measure.
The album's highlight is surprisingly a
"love" song, called "Love Rears Its Ugly
Head."
In front of a rhythmic, calculating gui
tar-drum combo, Glover recounts: "I'm
standing a the altar/ As they play the wed
ding march/ I'm in a black tuxedo with

my collar full of starch/ She looks as love- Up" is purely a rock album — less funk
ly as she's ever gonna get/1 wake up from and rhythm than "Vivid," but plenty of
this nightmare in a pool of sweat." biting energy to go around. B
Make no mistake about it: "Time's — Tim Marklein
