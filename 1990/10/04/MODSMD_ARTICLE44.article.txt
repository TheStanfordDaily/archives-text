# Levinson film chronicles the American family
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
Director Barry Levinson's new film
may not be "interesting" to a breed of
moviegoers weaned on "Rambo" and
"Tbtal Recall," but it is a poignant and
loving talc of a Russian immigrant fam
ily that arrives in America circa 1914.
"I thought it would be interesting to
show the evolution of a family over a
50-year period and show how the family
structure changes and the extended
family disappears," Levinson explained
after a screening of his latest film,
"Avalon," which opens tomorrow in the
San Francisco area.
Set in Baltimore's Avalon neighbor
hood, the film chronicles the lives of the
Krichinskys. At reunions every Thanks
giving, family patriarch Sam Krichinsky
tells stories of his struggles and tri
umphs so that no one will ever forget
the family's past.
While respectful of family tradition,
those in the succeeding generation are
more eager to embrace new ideas.
Sam's son, Jules, and his nephew,
Izzy, Americanize their East European
names and launch a discount depart
ment store that at first only sells televi
sion sets.
Still in its infancy, TV will alter the
course of the Krichinsky family's
future, as will other modern develop
ments.
The family changes: some traditions
change, some relatives move, and oth
ers either pass away or abandon the
family unit.
But the telling of the stories at
Thanksgiving persists, and the lineage

endures in spite of the ever-changing
outside world.
"I think television, transportation,
and the growth of suburbia are respon
sible for many of the problems we nave
today because the idea of a family unit
goes back thousands of years and it's
really only since the late 1940's that it
started to come apart," Levinson said.
"We altered something that had been
strong, and we haven't been able to
replace it. The family structure acted as
a support system. It instilled a sense of
morality and acted as an educational
force."
He added, "There is no question in
my mind that the family as we've
known it has come apart. It was a bit of
a mourning for this that prompted me
to begin writing 'Avalon'."
Levinson's script is indeed full of
heart, and it smartly avoids sentimen
tality.
In a pivotal scene, a sister is reunited
with a brother she presumed had died in
a concentration camp. Rather than
flood the soundtrack with overwhelm
ing music and fill the screen with teary
eyed close-ups, Levinson opts for a
silent long shot.
The scene is emotionally distant —
as the audience we are not allowed into
the private reunion of these two people
— and yet the moment is powerful
because it's so exclusive.
East German actor Armin Mueller-
Stahl (last seen as Jessica Lange's Nazi
father in"The Music Box") plays Sam
Krichinsky. The performance is likely to
garner him an Oscar nomination, for
his portrayal is rich and authentic.
Unlike many actors who make for

eign characters an ethnic caricature,
Mueller-Stahl brings to Sam an ordinar
iness that is essential to the film; in
spite of his accent, Sam could be any
body's grandfather.
The supporting roles are a mixed
bag. Elizabeth Perkins and Aidan Quinn
are miscast as members of the Krichin
sky clan. It is difficult for these contem
porary, hip actors to shed their modern
personas and revert back to characters
who lived decades before they were
born.
Joan Plowright, however, is mar
velous as Sam's bickering wife, and she
brings a bit of much-needed humor to
the serious-minded drama.
Not a film full of pyrotechnics and
flavor-of-the-month stars, "Avalon" will

probably not come close to the com
mercial success of Levinson's previous
triumph, "Rain Man."
"These films are becoming a rare
breed — you can't explain them or sell
them in 30 seconds, like you can for a
T)iehard' or a 'Pretty Woman,'" Levin
son explains.
"You can sell action or comedy, but
serious-minded character pieces require
an explanation. Producers don't want
that. Issues have to be simplified
today."
"Avalon" may be simple in terms of
special effects and gunfire, but it's
dense in character and feeling. In spite
of minor problems, it stands apart from
most Hollywood fare because it's heart
felt and personal. A-

Director Barry Levinson's new film
may not be "interesting" to a breed of
moviegoers weaned on "Rambo" and
"Tbtal Recall," but it is a poignant and
loving talc of a Russian immigrant fam
ily that arrives in America circa 1914.
"I thought it would be interesting to
show the evolution of a family over a
50-year period and show how the family
structure changes and the extended
family disappears," Levinson explained
after a screening of his latest film,
"Avalon," which opens tomorrow in the
San Francisco area.
Set in Baltimore's Avalon neighbor
hood, the film chronicles the lives of the
Krichinskys. At reunions every Thanks
giving, family patriarch Sam Krichinsky
tells stories of his struggles and tri
umphs so that no one will ever forget
the family's past.
While respectful of family tradition,
those in the succeeding generation are
more eager to embrace new ideas.
Sam's son, Jules, and his nephew,
Izzy, Americanize their East European
names and launch a discount depart
ment store that at first only sells televi
sion sets.
Still in its infancy, TV will alter the
course of the Krichinsky family's
future, as will other modern develop
ments.
The family changes: some traditions
change, some relatives move, and oth
ers either pass away or abandon the
family unit.
But the telling of the stories at
Thanksgiving persists, and the lineage

endures in spite of the ever-changing
outside world.
"I think television, transportation,
and the growth of suburbia are respon
sible for many of the problems we nave
today because the idea of a family unit
goes back thousands of years and it's
really only since the late 1940's that it
started to come apart," Levinson said.
"We altered something that had been
strong, and we haven't been able to
replace it. The family structure acted as
a support system. It instilled a sense of
morality and acted as an educational
force."
He added, "There is no question in
my mind that the family as we've
known it has come apart. It was a bit of
a mourning for this that prompted me
to begin writing 'Avalon'."
Levinson's script is indeed full of
heart, and it smartly avoids sentimen
tality.
In a pivotal scene, a sister is reunited
with a brother she presumed had died in
a concentration camp. Rather than
flood the soundtrack with overwhelm
ing music and fill the screen with teary
eyed close-ups, Levinson opts for a
silent long shot.
The scene is emotionally distant —
as the audience we are not allowed into
the private reunion of these two people
— and yet the moment is powerful
because it's so exclusive.
East German actor Armin Mueller-
Stahl (last seen as Jessica Lange's Nazi
father in"The Music Box") plays Sam
Krichinsky. The performance is likely to
garner him an Oscar nomination, for
his portrayal is rich and authentic.
Unlike many actors who make for

eign characters an ethnic caricature,
Mueller-Stahl brings to Sam an ordinar
iness that is essential to the film; in
spite of his accent, Sam could be any
body's grandfather.
The supporting roles are a mixed
bag. Elizabeth Perkins and Aidan Quinn
are miscast as members of the Krichin
sky clan. It is difficult for these contem
porary, hip actors to shed their modern
personas and revert back to characters
who lived decades before they were
born.
Joan Plowright, however, is mar
velous as Sam's bickering wife, and she
brings a bit of much-needed humor to
the serious-minded drama.
Not a film full of pyrotechnics and
flavor-of-the-month stars, "Avalon" will

probably not come close to the com
mercial success of Levinson's previous
triumph, "Rain Man."
"These films are becoming a rare
breed — you can't explain them or sell
them in 30 seconds, like you can for a
T)iehard' or a 'Pretty Woman,'" Levin
son explains.
"You can sell action or comedy, but
serious-minded character pieces require
an explanation. Producers don't want
that. Issues have to be simplified
today."
