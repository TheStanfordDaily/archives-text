## Wilder's unfunny love 
### 
When "Funny About Love"
arrives at the video store, its
title will probably get it mis
placed in the comedy section.
It would more appropriately
fall under the category of
drama, barring the invention of
such categories as "depressing"
and "waste of time."
The movie stars Gene
Wilder as New York political
cartoonist Duffy Bergman,
who, upon meeting his future
wife Meg Lloyd (Christine
Lahti), becomes tangled among
the demands of being in love,
having paternal instincts and
facing adulthood.
The film follows Duffy from
his inability to conceive a child
to the ensuing effects on his
marriage and sense of self
worth.
The attempts at humor,
often of a biological, reproduc
tive nature, are only frequent
and successful enough to keep
the viewer sufficiently off-guard
to feel depressed during what
could otherwise be dramatic
moments. Duffy faces enough
hardship to make one wonder
what's so funny about love at
all.
If the strong chemistry
shared by Duffy and Meg could
also be shared with the audi
ence, perhaps one could be for

giving that this movie aimlessly
follows their emotional roller
coaster.
However, as Duffy's charac
ter swings from being childish
and headstrong to being dour
and irresolute, he never man
ages to evoke much sympathy
for his effort.
Meg's erratic and two
dimensional behavior doesn't
spur the viewer's curiosity
either. The only character that
stands out is Daphne Delillo
(Mary Stuart Masterson), who
plays a refreshing sports pro
ducer whom Duffy turns to
when his marriage turns sour.
Her energy and on-screen
likability leave the audience
really wanting to know her
story, not Duffy's.
Leonard Nimoy's direction
("Three Men and a Baby") is
visually interesting and well
timed, but the script does not
offer to meet him halfway in
producing worthwhile charac
terizations or situations.
"Funny About Love" proves
to be no more than an uneven
drama mixed with obvious
humor and characters you
wouldn't particularly want to
know, let alone watch on-screen
for two hours. C
