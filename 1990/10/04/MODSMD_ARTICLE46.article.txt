Good Fellas
Ray Llotta, Robert DeNiro
Martin Scorsese makes films
that he wants. Like his previous
works, "Good Fellas" progresses
without a grand plot, lasts almost
two-and-a-half hours, and
explodes with sudden, palpable
violence.
The apparent lack of plot arises
because the film chronicles the real
life 30-year rise and fall of mobster
Henry Hill. Based on Nicholas
Pileggi's book "Wiseguy," Scorsese

takes the viewer on a relentless ride
through the mob world.
Opening with a brief, but brutal,
killing, the first scene of "Good Fe
llas" immediately establishes the
three central characters, their
volatile natures and the macabre
sense of humor which pervades the
film.
Mr. Acting himself, Robert
DeNiro, plays the leader of the trio,
Irish gangster Jimmy Conway. Joe
Pesci, last seen in "Lethal Weapon
II," appears as the unbelievable,
vicious Tbmmy DeVito. The last
of the trio, and the axis around

which the film rotates, is Ray
Liotta as the half-Irish Henry Hill.
The ethnicity of Jimmy and
Tbmmy is wortn noting because
the fact that they are not full
blooded Italians prevents them
from being "maaed," (accepted
into the upper echelon of the mob).
It is important to bear in mind
that Jimmy, Tbmmy and Henry are
the messengers of bad news; they
are not the ones who deciaed to
send it.
That's what makes "Good Fe
llas" different from Francis Ford
Coppola's "Godfather" films. This

film takes you down into the
trenches of the men who do the
dirty work.
Written by Pileggi and Scorsese,
the screenplay consists of a suc
cessful blend of stereotypical
tough-guy talk, introspective nar
ration and sadistic humor.
While I still personally prefer
Michael Corleone's story over
Henry Hill's, there's no aenying
the power and perfection of Scors
ese's ground-level view of the mob.
