Texasville
Jeff Bridges, Cyblll Shepherd
In 1971, a young film director named Peter
Bogdanovich gathered together a cast of
unknown actors, shipped them off to a small
Texas town, and set them in front of the cam
eras.
The end result was the Academy Award win
ning "The Last Picture Show," a movie that crit
ics nave universally hailed as a modern classic.
The film propelled its principle actors, including
Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd, to movie star

dom, while firmly establishing Bogdanovich as
one of Hollywood's top directors.
Now, however, cames "Texasville", a unin
spired, vapid sequel which, despite the presence
of both Bogdanovich and the entire cast of "The
Last Picture Show," completely lacks the fresh
and entertaining spirit of the original film.
Texasville" takes place in 1984, some thirty
years after the events depicted in"The Last
Picture Show." Like its predecessor, the film is
set in Anarene, Texas, a cfuiet little burg where
social life revolves around the local Dairy
Queen.

It's a boring town — so boring, in fact, that
most of its adult inhabitants amuse themselves
by fooling around with each other's spouses.
There are enough illicit affairs and illegitimate
births in this one-horse town to steam anyone's
glasses.
Caught in the middle of this adulterous tan
gle is Duane Jackson (Bridges), a formerly suc
cessful oil man who has fallen on hard times.
Aside from being $12 million in debt, Duane
soon discovers that his mistress is
sleeping with his teenage son. Talk
about having a bad day.
Enter Jacy Farrow (Shepherd),
Duane's former high school sweet
heart. He learns she has returned
to Anarene after a successful career
as a movie star. Although Duane is
clearly still attracted to her, Jacy
dodges his subtle advances and,
oddly enough, quickly befriends his

shallow wife Karla (Annie Potts).
From this point on — about
thirty minutes into the movie —
the plot starts to unravel. Instead
of following any logical progres
sion, the story meanders listlessly
around the lives of its characters in
a series of meaningless encounters
and boring dialogues.
Bogdanovich jumps from char
acter to character, never remaining
with one long enough for the view
er to generate sympathy for any of
them. Although all of the actors

make valiant attempts to stretch in
their respective roles, they simply
don't have enough material to
work with.
In addition, Bogdanovich pur
sues a number of sub-plots to the
Duane-Jacy-Karla triangle that
remain completely unresolved.
One can only hope that, after
this outing, Bogaanovich abandons
any plans he might have for a "The
Last Picture Show" trilogy. C+
