# Literacy Project cut University hopes ESL classes will fill need
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The Stanford Literacy Project has
become the latest victim of University bud
get repositioning and streamlining efforts.
However, the project's spirit of student
volunteerism may live on through an
English class offered to Stanford employees
this fall by Human Resources Develop
ment.
The project, founded in 1986, was
designed to improve the productivity and
communication skills of Stanford employ
ees by teaching them English. Headquar
tered in El Centro Chicano, the
Chicano/Latino community center, the pro
gram was coordinated by two staff mem
bers and taught by student volunteers.
The project was funded by departments
which have participating employees, such
as University Food Services and Operations
and Maintenance.
Now, however, the departments are
sending their employees to Human
Resources to utilize its "English as a Sec
ond Language" program, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson said.
By using only the ESL classes, the Uni
versity does not have to spend money on
two similar programs, Jackson said.
Instead of having an "ad hoc operation" at
El Centro, the ESL class will institutional
ize the project within the University's staff

training and literal program, he added.
Not everyone, however, is optimistic
about the change.
Pedro Castefieda, who was director of
the literacy project, said former student
tutors are "really upset." The ESL class
that Human Resources Development offers
is scheduled at noon, at an "odd hour ...
that no one can attend," Castefieda said.
Casteneda added that the project had an
enrollment in the past of about 80 employ
ees per quarter. He said because many
employees need individual instruction, a
large ESL class would not be ideal.
The literacy project used to offer one-on
one tutoring and two small classes of about
five students each, Castefieda said. There
were two additions! classes, at Webb Ranch
and in East Palo Alto.
The East Palo Alto class, which is taught
by Stanford students, was not affected by
the cut because it is now receiving funding
from the San Jose-based Center for
Employment and Training, Castefieda said.
Jackson stressed that his main concern
is maintaining student participation as
tutors.
Frances Morales, director of El Centro,
said she is accepting applications for a stu
dent coordinator who will supplement the
certified ESL teacher's efforts by arranging
voluntary student tutors to give one-on-one
instruction to employees.
Casteneda said he suggested hir
ing a student who is on federal
work-study, because the literacy
project has stopped receiving Uni
versity or departmental funding.
"We will try to continue with
the program to the extent that we
can," Morales said.
Jeremy Warren, manager of
Human Resources Development,
said the ESL class has been ongo
ing for a few years and is not a
new program designed to replace
the literacy project.
Warren said he plans to meet
with Morales to discuss how stu
dent participation can be incorpo
rated into the ESL class.
Literacy improvement is an
important concern on campus,
not only for University depart
ments.
Bon Appetit caterer, an outside
contractor at Tresidder Union, is
planning to organize an English
class for its employees for two
hours per week, Casteneda said.
He said he is helping the company
find an English teacher.
He added that the literacy pro
ject offered free instruction for
Bon Appetit's employees last year,
because the caterer was new on
campus and had little funding for
educational programs.
Jackson, however, said Bon
Appetit is still considering various
options, including sending its
employees to the ESL program of
Human Resources Development.
