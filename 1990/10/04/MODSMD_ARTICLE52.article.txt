If you're ever in the mood for a small, hole-in-the
wall, intimate Japanese restaurant, Tbkyo of Palo Alto
is the place to go.
A small restaurant that could easily be overlooked,
Tbkyo definitely deserves attention, especially
because of its reasonably priced menu and its relaxed
and cozy atmosphere.
Tbkyo offers a large variety of Japanese specialties,
but don't ask the wait staff to explain anything on the
menu. No one seemed to speak English the night we
went.
Not only do they serve traditional favorites like
chicken teriyaki, tempura and sushi, but they also
have three kinds of "Japanese table range cooking,"
including Shabu Shabu Nabe (thinly sliced beef, vtg
ciubies, and totu cookcd using chopsticks in boiling
water and dipped in a special sauce.)
Tb sample an assortment of different items, the
"Dinner Box" specials feature three entrees, and are
served with soup or salad, rice, fresh fruit, seasoned
tofu and tea.
I ordered the box with chicken teriyaki, Tbmpura
and Gyoza {Japanese potstickers) for $9.50, while my
dining companion ordered one with a variety of sushi
in place of the Gyoza for $ 11.95.
The food tasted fresh and all seemed to be of high
quality — no cartilage in the chicken, for example. In
addition, we were surprised at the large portions.

There were numerous pieces of tempura, including
prawn, broccoli and carrot, a generous serving of ten
der chicken, three potstickers, as well as all the other
extras that were included with the dinner.
The restaurant's wusiu menu seemed higher-priced
than other places. Six pieces of California Roll (crab,
avocado and cucumber) cost $5.50, for example.
Though tlic restaurant seemed to have decent busi
ness the night we went, there was no overwhelming
crowd oi wait to be seated, making this a peaceful
alternative to some of the more popular Japanese
restaurants in the area.
With its good food, reasonable prices and conve
nient location, Tbkyo is a good place to break the
everyday hustle and bustle college life seems to per
petuate — allowing you to relax and enjoy a tasty
meal.
