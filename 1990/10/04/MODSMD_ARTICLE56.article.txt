# Catalogs
## 
### 
You will need to learn to use two kinds of catalogs at Stanford —the online catalog and the card
catalog. We presently are in the process of transferring bibliographic records from the card catalog
to the online catalog, so that we can offer full online access to all holdings. As a result, neither is
complete. You sometimes must use both in order to determine if the material you need is at Stanford

Online Catalogs
Socrates and LOIS
Socrates is the name for the SUL online
catalog. Lane Medical Library has its own
online catalog and circulation system, known
as LOIS (Lane Online Informaiton System), in
addition to Socrates. The online catalogs
usually are the best place to begin a search
because the most recently purchased items will
be found ONLY online and the computer offers
ways to search the catalog that were not possi
ble with the manual catalog. Use either LOIS
or Socrates to find materials at Lane. (LOIS
will tell you not only call numbers and location
but also whether material is on the shelf or
charged out —and date due if charged out.)
For which libraries will I find records in
Socrat?.s?
• Meyer Library (all items)
• Branrer Earth Sciences Library (all items
except most maps)
• Green Library, Special Collections and the
other branches (all items acquired since 1973
and some acquired before 1973)
• Coordinate Libraries (most items acquired
since 1977)
Where can I search online catalogs?
Socrates terminals are located in Green,
Meyer, the branch libraries, Tanner (Philoso
phy Department library), the Hoover Institu
tion, the Robert Crown Law Library. Lane
Medical Library provides users with their own
Folio accounts; access is gained via public
micros in the library and in Lane's Fleischmann

Learning Resource Center.
Both Socrates and LOIS can be accessed
and searched from outside the libraries.
Socrates can be searched using terminals or
computers connected to the Data Center at
Forsythe Hall such as those in some residence
halls. Faculty, students, and staff may obtain
free accounts that provide 24 hour access to
Socrates; inquire at library reference desks.
LOIS has both network and dial-up access for
Stanford users wishing to search from office or
home computers; instruction sheets for Dialing
Into LOIS are available at the Lane Medical
Library Information Center.

How do I search the online catalogs?
Socrates is easy to use when you follow
the instructions on the screen. For more
advanced techniques, you can pick up a copy
of Socrates: A User Guide to the Online Catalog
of the Stanford Libraries or a two-page Reference
Guide to Socrates at any library service desk.
To search LOIS, pick up a copy of A Reference
Guide to LOIS from the Information Center at
Lane Medical Library. Training on both
Socrates and LOIS is also available. (See
Instructional Support on the next page.)
Card Catalogs
The card catalog lists many holdings of the
Libraries of Stanford; however, cards for mate
rials acquired since 1973 have been pulled from
the union catalog in Green. Records for these
newer materials will be found only in Socrates.
Also, you should be aware that Green
Library's card catalog (located near the en
trance to the East Wing of Green Library across
from Meyer) does NOT contain records for:
• All materials acquired since 1973
• Meyer Library collection (all in Socrates)
• Most holdings of Jonsson Library of
Government Documents
• Holdings of Stanford Linear Accelerator
Library
• Much of the non-book materials available
at Stanford (printed music, sound recordings,
manuscripts, archives, audiovisual items,
maps, etc.)
• Most holdings of Hoover Institution
Library and Archives
Check with the appropriate library to discover
how you can find records for these materials.
