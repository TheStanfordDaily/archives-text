Molly Yard will speak tonight as part of a rally
sponsored by the California Campus Caravan
for Women's Lives. The event, which will take
place at 7 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium, will
include a film on minors' rights to reproductive
choice.
Formerly called the Freedom Caravan, the
campaign began over a year ago to educate peo
ple about abortion rights, Yard said in a Mon
day interview with The Daily.
Yard said she is looking forward to return
ing to Stanford, where she lived in 1950 with
her husband, who was then teaching law. The
caravan will also travel to Mills College, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, UC-Davis and San
Jose State.
"It is terribly important for students to
understand that their lives are being decided
for them, that their lives are going to be devas
tated," she said. "Forced pregnancy is in most
cases an 18-year-long responsibility. The indi
vidual must have the right to decide, not be
told by the government what she must do."
This problem is especially acute for minors,
who may face pressures from parents as well as
the government, Yard said.
Tonight's film, "Parental Consent," is about
Becky Bell, a teenager who died after attempt
ing to end her pregnancy herself because she
was afraid to tell her parents.
Bell's parents now tour the country speak
ing out against laws which would require
minors to inform or obtain consent from one or
both parents before getting an abortion.
Parental consent laws were ruled constitu
tional by two Supreme Court decisions last
year. In those rulings, the court allowed states
to limit the right to abortion granted in the
landmark 1973 case, Roe v. Wade.
"It is very likely that in January, [parental
consent] legislation will be introduced in every
state that does not already have a parental con
sent law," Yard said.
This likelihood underscores the need to elect
women and pro-choice candidates, Yard said.
More women are running for federal and state
office this year than in the past, and although
women make up more than 50 percent of the
population, they constitute only 17 percent of
legislature members.
"We are hopeful that 1990 and 1992 will
add a lot more women. If we could elect abor
tion rights people, we would not have the prob
lem we have right now," she said. "The caravan
is an educational tool to explain the importance
of being involved in electoral politics."
At tonight's rally, students will be asked to
sign a pledge "not to vote for or support, with
my money or my time, any candidate for any
office who does not fully support
and work for women's equality
and the right to safe, legal and
accessible abortion and birth con
trol." Volunteers will also be reg
istering voters.
"Women legislators are far
more supportive of the right of a

woman to choose, of pay equity
and of family medical leave," Yard
said. "All of that legislation will go
much better if we have a more
representative legislative body."
In the long term, Yard hopes
that increasing the number of
women in state legislatures will
allow the Equal Rights Amend
ment to be passed.
"The events of last year make
it clear that we will never have
protection for women against dis

crimination until the ERA is
passed," she said. "If we get 35
percent women in state legisla
tures, that will be enough to go
for ratification again."
In addition to encouraging stu
dent activism, NOW is targeting
college students because "we are
hoping they will help us reach out
to high school students, who are
in many senses more heavily
affected than any other group,"
Yard said.
