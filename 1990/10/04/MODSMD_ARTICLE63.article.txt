Periodicals and Newspapers
Socrates provides bibliographic informa
tion about which periodicals are kept by Green,
Meyer, the Branch Libraries and most of the
Coordinate Libraries (but NOT about the indi
vidual articles). You should contact the appro
priate library to determine where they are
shelved. In Green, current issues of periodicals
are shelved in the Current Periodicals & Micro
texts Room as well as current and back issues
of newspapers (East Wing, Lower Level,
Michael Ballard, 725-1041, cn.cpm@forsythe).
The libraries of the Hoover Institution also
maintain a large collection of both domestic
and foreign newspapers. Current issues are
available in the Current Periodicals and
Newspaper Reading Room (Hoover Tower,
Room 15, Viveca Seymour, 723-2070).
