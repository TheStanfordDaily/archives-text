# YMCA to assist TEAM in efforts to coach youths
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Last spring, when the YMCA
wanted to establish physical edu
cation programs for local elemen
tary school students, they found
that Stanford students had initi
ated such a program five years
earlier.
So, the giant public service
organization offered to support
the already-existing efforts of
Together Each Accomplishes
More, a program in which Stan
ford students coach physical edu
cation at East Palo Alto elemen
tary schools.
The YMCA will run training
workshops for TEAM volunteers
and work with school administers
to allow Stanford students to
spend more time with their pupils.
These YMCA "liaisons" will
also keep track of the success of
specific games and particular
coaching methods.
TEAM co-director Jennifer
Steele, a junior, welcomes the
assistance. "The YMCA has so
much experience in working in
the community and will be such a
huge resource that we can tap,"
she said.
Along with these changes to
the program, Steele and co-direc
tor D'Layne Kerr, also a junior,
will implement discussion sec
tions and follow-up sessions for
TEAM volunteers. The YMCA
may assist with these sections as
well.
Through these sections, Steele

and Kerr say they hope to provide
a forum for the student coaches to
share methods and insights. In
particular, TEAM leaders want to
make sure volunteers get a lot out
of their participation.
"Our grand hope is for people
to see and take social responsibil

ity for the issues out there regard
ing poverty and racial tension,"
Steele explained.
Through the four-hour train
ing workshops, the YMCA will be
able to clear up some of the mis
conceptions and problems TEAM
volunteers encounter. For exam

pie, in the past, some volunteers
have walked into classrooms
expecting students to fully cooper
ate with them but fail to maintain
control of their group.
"Volunteers . . . need to first be
a coach to the students before
they can be a friend," Steele said.

The training workshops should
help by instilling realistic expecta
tions in TEAM volunteers, she
said. Ir-
With this assistance, TEAJS
leaders say they hope the program
will be more successful in teach-j
ing the East Palo Alto students
about the importance of team
work and group interaction.
"It's something we really
believe in. Students who wouldn't;
participate in group activities
begin to cooperate. Some students
who had no confidence in their
athletic abilities begin to feel
good," Kerr said.
TEAM has grown quickly as an
organization from its original 20
members. Last year, 110 students
participated in the program.
This year, with the extra sup
port, Steele and Kerr are aiming
for a membership of 150, which
would enable more than 1,500 ele
mentary students to have the
opportunity to take part in TEAM
activities. At last week's Opportu
nities Fair, 50 students signed up
to join TEAM.
TEAM volunteers spend one
and-a-half hours each week for
the duration of at least one quar
ter with the young students. Vol
unteers direct classes of about 30
students in creative group games
and activities that emphasize par
ticipation over physical ability.
"They are fun games that make
everyone equal, despite differ
ences in physical ability," Kerr
explained. "Everyone gets
involved and moving.
