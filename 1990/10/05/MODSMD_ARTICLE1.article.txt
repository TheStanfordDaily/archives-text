# ASSU to reform its bylaws
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU Bylaws used to contain a
split infinitive. Last night, the ASSU
Senate passed a bill to correct that error.
But the split infinitive was just one of
many problems with the bylaws that the
senate had to seriously face last night.
In a lengthy meeting, the senate dealt
with a host of issues regarding its
bylaws, in the end creating a task force
to examine its guiding document. The
"Constitution/Bylaw Reform Task
Force" will meet for the first time Tues
day.
The task force is open to all students
and will also include senators and
appointed representatives. Next month,
the task force will present a report to
the senate with recommendations for
election and other bylaw reforms and
clarifications.
After much debate last night, the
senate approved a bill, authored by
Financial Manager Torrence Boone,
that would delay the disbursement of
fee refunds until a three-week period
beginning Nov. 19. Boone has reformed
the fee-refund request procedure, using

an SAT-like computerized form.
Until last night's meeting, the bylaws
required the ASSU to distribute fee
refunds during the third and fourth
week of the quarter. Boone requested
the delay in disbursements so that he
would have ample time to implement his
new computerized system.
Because of an academic conflict,
Boone was not present during the first
two hours of the meeting, and was
unable to answer questions about his
bill.
During his absence, some senators
pointed out that changing the timing of
the fee-refund system would require an
amendment to the bylaws. The ensuing
debate focused on whether or not the
ASSU could amend its bylaws without
giving previous notice, which is the
standard procedure.
In addition to questioning the legal
ity of this action, some graduate sena
tors expressed concern that students
would have to return to the ASSU a sec
ond time to pick up their checks.
Upon Boone's return, he was sur
prised that the senate meeting was still
in session, debating his bill. "I thought
that the issues were straightforward

issues," he said. "I guess I was wrong,"
he added, provoking laughter.
Boone explained that he had gone
ahead with his plan under the assump
tion that the senate would not mind the
delayed system. He said that had he
foreseen their objections, he would have
moved quickly over the summer to have
the new system ready for the third and
fourth weeks of the quarter.
After the meeting, Boone attributed
the controversy to a "procedural misun
derstanding," adding that he had mis
gauged the way the senate would react
to his bill. "I'm not an expert on the
bylaws," he said.
Despite the questions about the legal
ity of changing the bylaws last night, the
senate passed Boone's bill on a divided
voice vote.
The senate also passed a series of
bills that would correct errors and tech
nical mistakes in the bylaws. Graduate
senator Douglas Bone, who sponsored
four of the bills, said that there were
"200 to 300 spelling errors and things
like that" in the bylaws.
One of these bills changed the words
"to strongly advocate" to "to advocate
strongly," avoiding the split infinitive.
