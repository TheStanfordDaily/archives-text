# Researcher criticizes Soviet state controls

### Mike Laris 
Looking like a relieved canary,
Leonid Gordon emerged from the
coal mines of Siberia with what he
considered to be optimistic news.
For the first time in the history of
the Soviet Union, an independent
labor movement is emerging.
Gordon, a senior researcher at
the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
gave a first-hand account of a
June meeting at which Soviet
miners held their first Miners'
Congress and decided to organize
a new, independent union to
replace its state-sponsored prede
cessor.
Gordon spoke to students and
faculty yesterday at the Center for
Russian and East European Stud
ies.
Attacking the "overstatization"
of Soviet society, Gordon
explained that an independent
workers' movement is needed in
the Soviet Union because "there is
no tiny side of life that is not con
nected with the State."
Workers' movements had
always been an arm of the state,
Gordon said, and "an important
part of the workers distrust these
unions."
Gordon predicted that more
workers will follow the example of
the miners because it is nearly
impossible to change the negative
views of existing trade unions.
Gordon acted as a consultant to
the miners, answering questions

♦
and aiding in the drafting of reso
lutions.
For 20 years, Gordon studied
conditions affecting the Soviet
worker. As a result, he had
unprecedented access to key mem
bers of the independent labor!
movement, including the opportu-1
nity to interview all members of
the Miners' Congress.
Gordon also spoke yesterday of
the demographics in the state-:
sponsored unions. He asserted,'
that at a ratio of up to 9 to 1,;
union members supported demo
cratic reforms and transition to a
capitalist society.
He said skilled and white collar
workers supported breaking away
and creating new unions.;
Unskilled and older workers still
have a "strong connection to egal
itarian demagoguery," Gordon
said, and are less likely to support
market reforms or breakaway
unions.
Gordon predicted that without
a strong independent trade union
structure, support for reform
among trade unionists could slip
to below a majority when the
Soviet Union undergoes a shock to
its economy like the one now
occurring in Poland.
Stanford experts on the Soviet
Union appreciated Gordon's
report from the field. "He has
probably watched this more
closely than any other scholar,"
Political Science Prof. David Hol
loway said.
