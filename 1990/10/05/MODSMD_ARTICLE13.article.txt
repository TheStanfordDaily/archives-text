first mtyor crisis of the post-
Cold War era. As hostilities
continue to mount, Americans
seek explanations for this
unfortunate development.

Although often portrayed by the press as
another Hitler, or "the butcher of Baghdad,"
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is not a mad
man, History Asst. Prof. Joel Beinin said.
U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie told Hussein
before the invasion that no military alliance
! existed between the United States and Kuwait,
Beinin said.
Beinin suggested the ambiguity of America's
112 stance before the crisis may have been intend
; ed to give Hussein the green light to invade.
< "I think [Husseinl didn't anticipate an
j American response of this sort," he said.
< Because of the gulf crisis, the U.S. militap'
• can now pushed for an increased presence in
the region, Beinin said.
Political Science Prof. Stephen Krasner also
suggested American policy-makers' concerns
are more political than economic.
In the post-Cold War period, the Americans
and the Soviets might see themselves as "new
global policemen," he said.
Oil is not the main reason that President
Bush sent troops, Krasner added. He cited that
during the oil crisis of 1973-74 when prices
quadrupled, the United States "did nothing."
Nevertheless, Krasner said there is a good
chance there will be war.
