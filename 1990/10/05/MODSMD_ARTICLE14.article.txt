WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush hailed
yesterday a tentative accord requiring the Soviet
Union to destroy thousands of tanks, artillery pieces
and armored vehicles in Europe, saying it would
"decisively improve the balance of military power"
on the continent.
Bush was referring to the Conventional Forces in
Europe treaty, which would be the largest arms-con
trol deal in history and the first in Europe since the
end of World War 11.
If final details are resolved, it will be signed by the
22 nations of the Warsaw Pact and the NATO
alliance at the Nov. 19-21 Paris summit of the 34-
nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
The accord would set a ceiling on non-nuclear
forces for both alliances.
Each side would be limited to 20,000 tanks,
20,000 artillery pieces, 30,000 armored combat vehi
cles and 2,000 helicopters in the area stretching
from Europe's Atlantic Coast to the Ural Mountains
inside the Soviet Union.
The two sides are still grappling with overall lim
its on combat aircraft for each military alliance.
However, after long negotiations, they agreed to a
limit of 5,150 warplanes in any single country, Sec
retary of State James Baker announced at a joint
appearance with Bush.
The agreement does not put any limit on the
number of soldiers. The United States and Soviet
Union agreed to skip that step in order to meet the
Paris deadline.
On Capitol Hill, Senate Msyority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, called the announcement of the
tentative accord good news.
He said he hoped there would be "early and
enthusiastic approval" of the agreement in the Sen
ate early next year.
