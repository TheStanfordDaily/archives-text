Animal research defended
WASHINGTON (AP) — The American Medi
cal Association accused animal-rights activists
yesterday of mounting a campaign of terrorism,
with bombings, break-ins and hate mail, to try to
prevent all medical research using animals.
The AMA said it was starting a counter-cam
paign, noting that "science and medical research
may come to a halt if we do not take our heads out
of the sand."
Dr. William Jacott, an AMA trustee, said the
AMA is planning news conferences and activities
to forcefully present the medical community's
view of the need to continue animal research.
Gorbachev sent note to Iraq
A Soviet envoy carried a secret message from
Mikhail Gorbachev to Baghdad yesterday in new
efforts for peace in the Persian Gulf. The content
of the message was not disclosed.
Tass quoted the envoy as saying in Baghdad

that a negotiated solution was needed "to avoid a
military explosion."
Gorbachev said yesterday he saw no reason to
send Soviet troops to join the U.S.-led multina
tional force in the gulf. In response to a query,
Gorbachev told reporters in Moscow that there
are already more than enough troops there.
Environmentalists seek
shuttle delay
WASHINGTON (AP) — Environmentalists
argued in court yesterday that NASA is so anx
ious to get Saturday's space shuttle mission
under way that it is ignoring the danger that
would be posed by radioactivity escaping from a
launch accident.
"We seek a delay today because safety concerns
were not addressed," said Andrew C. Kimbrell,
representing the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice, which is trying to delay the liftoff for at
least a year.
