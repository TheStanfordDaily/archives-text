# Congress keeps NEA alive

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” House negotiators
announced bipartisan agreement yesterday on a
compromise bill that would extend the embattled
National Endowment for the Arts for three years
and let the courts decide whether federally subsi
dized works are obscene.
Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., predicted that the
measure, drafted after weeks of intensive bargain
ing, will pass the House by a significant majority of
both Democrats and Republicans. Floor debate will
begin next Wednesday or Thursday.
Reps. E. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., and Paul
Henry, R-Mich., who worked with Williams to draft
the compromise, said the bill won't satisfy some
hard-nosed House conservatives who want to dis
mantle or abolish the arts endowment.
The Williams-Coleman compromise would forbid
the endowment to finance obscene works, but would
shift the burden of deciding what is obscenity from
the NEA to the courts.
If a grant recipient is convicted of violating
obscenity laws, and the NEA concludes that federal
funds were involved, the artist would be required to
give the government its money back. The artist
would be barred from receiving any new federal
funds for at least three years.
Another provision demanded by Republi
can negotiators would boost the states' share of
NEA grant money from 20 percent to 35 percent
over the next three years. Coleman originally had
sought to shift 60 percent of NEA funds to the con

trol of state arts agencies but accepted the lesser per
centage.
Under the bill, the membership of artists' panels
that select grant applications for approval would be
expanded to include "knowledgeable lay persons."
The NEA chairman's authority to make final grant
decisions would be bolstered, and the role of the
endowment's presidentially appointed advisory
council would be heightened.
The compromise declares that "obscenity is with
out artistic merit and is not protected speech."
Williams said those words would remove the legal
justification for NEA chairman John Frohnmayer's
controversial requirement that grant recipients sign
an anti-obscenity pledge as a condition for receiving
federal funds.
The pledge has caused a furor in the arts commu
nity, which complains that it inhibits freedom of
expression, and has prompted three federal lawsuits
challenging its constitutionality.
The bill would require the NEA chairman to
"ensure that artistic excellence and artistic merit
are the criteria by which applications are judged,
taking into consideration general standards of
decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and val
ues of the American public."
Coleman and Henry both predicted that the bill
will be opposed by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.,
and other staunch conservatives who are the NEA's
most persistent and vocal assailants, but will be
backed by many more GOP moderates and conserva
tives.
