# Dartmouth Review under fire
## 
### 
HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -
About 2,000 people rallied at
Dartmouth College yesterday to
denounce the publication of an
anti-Semitic quotation by Adolf
Hitler in The Dartmouth Review,
a conservative off-campus weekly.
Before the rally, the Review
held a news conference to apolo
gize for the quote, which it says
was included in the paper's mast
head through sabotage.
Dartmouth President James
Freedman called the quote an
"egregious expression of anti-
Semitism" and "appalling big
otry."
"For the last 10 years, these
shameless voices have ranted that
Dartmouth is for some but not for
others," he said. "These voices
have preached exclusion from the
Dartmouth family and have
expected us to heed their words.
What kind of people did they
think we were?"
Dartmouth Religion Professor
Arthur Hertzberg, who also is vice
president of the World Jewish
Congress, called the latest contro
versy "an act of hooliganism" per
petrated by "misguided young
people."
He attacked supporters of the
Review, which include syndicated
columnists Patrick Buchanan and
William Buckley and the New

York-based John M. Olin Founda
tion.
"My quarrel is with those who
put up hundreds of thousands of
dollars with which to contaminate
this campus," he said.
At the paper's news conference,
Review trustees Dinesh D'Souza
and Wendy Stone said the appear
ance of the quote was "sabotage"
by an unknown person. D'Souza
said the trustees will contact the
Jewish organization B'nai B'rith
to help investigate the incident.
The Review, published since
1980, has been vilified through
the years for its views on women,
homosexuals, blacks and Indians.
William Cole, a black music
professor, resigned in August
after the Review attacked him for
seven years in print, belittling him
as a mediocre teacher.
Review staff members also
were involved in a 1986 sledge
hammer attack on shanties
erected on the campus green as
part of a protest against segrega
tion in South Africa.
In 1988, the Review ran a col
umn likening Freedman, who is
Jewish, to Hitler and the effects of
his campus policies to the Holo
caust.
D'Souza said the 1988 column
was "sophomoric and in bad
taste." He said newspaper

trustees apologized for it at the
time.
The latest edition of the Review
was distributed Saturday, on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atone
ment and Judaism's most solemn
day. The quotation, from Hitler's
"Mein Kampf," was inserted
unattributed into the statement
of principles on The Review's
masthead:
"Therefore, I believe today
that I am acting in the sense of the
Almighty Creator: By warding off
the Jews, I am fighting for the
Lord's work."
History professor Bruce Nelson
called the Hitler quote the latest
example of the "small-minded,
mean-spirited scribblings of the
local hate sheet."
He said in part because of the
Review, Dartmouth is unable to
attract black, students and faculty.
He said keeping the campus void
of minorities is a "vital part of the
Review's purpose."
Trecia Canty, president of
Dartmouth's Afro-American Soci
ety, questioned why students
protested the quote while other
attacks on minorities haven't
been publicized.
"This rally represents the first
time Dartmouth . . . has come
together and rallied against
