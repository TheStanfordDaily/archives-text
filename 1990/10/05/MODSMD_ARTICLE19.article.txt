;; Crime capital
Dinkins' announcement of a hiring
freeze came at a time when the city was

witnessing increasingly brutal crimes.
New Yorkers are becoming accustomed to
the shooting and stabbing that can occur
on a typical day like Wednesday.
A 17-year-old mother carrying her
week-old son on a Brooklyn street was
fatally stabbed that day, bringing one
day's toll of teen-age victims in the city to
one dead, five wounded.
Deborah Joseph was stabbed once in
the chest by another 17-year-old girl with
whom she had a long-standing dispute,
police said yesterday.
Joseph was holding her son, Darren,
and walking with a friend when she saw
her attacker brandishing a knife.
The mother handed the baby to her
friend and began to flee, but was outrun

by the assailant, who fatally stabbed her
in the chest. The suspect fled after the
stabbing, and had not been arrested,
police said.
A spate of shootings that left five teen
agers wounded also on Wednesday began
at a popular Manhattan dance club at
3:30 a.m., when a 17-year-old-girl was
shot in the face by a young man with
whom she refused to dance, police said.
Rodney Selby, 22, was charged with
attempted murder and criminal posses
sion of a handgun, which was not recov
ered, Police Officer Fred Weiner said. The
victim, Sayeeda Kelly, was listed in stable
condition at St. Vincent's Hospital.
Two girls in Harlem, ages 13 and 14,
were shot and wounded by a 14-year-old

boy at 7 p.m., during what police said was
a lover's quarrel.
"It's typical. You have a gun, you use
it," an investigator at the 32nd Precinct
detective squad said of the shootings.
The 14-year-old suspect, identified by
police as Vaughn Chiddick, was charged
with attempted murder, first-degreee
assault, criminal possession of a deadly
weapon and first-degree reckless endan
germent.
In the Bronx, two 15-year-olds were
shot and wounded in separate incidents.
In the first shooting, the victim was
shot in the left leg shortly after 9 p.m.
The motive, as well as the suspect and the
type of gun used, were not known.

The other youth was shot at 10:15 p.m.
on what was described as a drug-prone
street in the Fordham section. Police said
the shooting was believed to be motivated
by a previous street fight between the two
teen-agers. The suspect fled and was not
immediately arrested.
Lt. Joel Pierson, head of the detective
squad that investigated the two Bronx
shootings, Baid the average age of shoot
ing victims in the city was getting
younger.
''Throughout the city there's an over
all increase in shooting incidents and it
works its way down to younger people
being shot," said Pierson.
