# Cal tries to cope with its tragedies
## 
### Howard Libit 
Students at UC-Berkeley are strug
gling to cope with a series of tragedies
that struck the campus over the last
month.
The month began with a fire on Sept.
8 at the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity
house that killed three students and
injured two others.
Eleven days later, a telephoned bomb
threat forced the evacuation of all
42,000 students, faculty and staff for
the first time in campus history.
Finally, on Sept. 27 a diagnosed para
noid schizophrenic held dozens of stu
dents hostage in a popular Berkeley bar

for seven and one-half hours, ultimately
killing one student and injuring six oth
ers before being killed himself by a
police SWAT team.
"The general student reaction (to
these three incidents) has been a variety
of emotions: sorrow, fear, confusion,
anxiety, etc.," said Bonaparte Liu, presi
dent of the Associated Students of the
University of California. "For first-year
students, this has been a sad, tragic
introduction to their years at Cal."
The university has taken several
steps to help students cope with the
tragedies.
University counselors have held
many interpersonal trauma and stress

workshops, and the deadline to drop
classes has been extended for students
who feel overwhelmed by the tragedies.
"The campus had to make use of ser
vices and emergency plans in ways not
intended," said Ray Colvig, public infor
mation officer for UC-Berkeley.
"In retrospect, everything worked
well," he added. "People worked hard
and did their jobs with skill and caring.
This went beyond the university to the
city and community."
The university held two campus
gatherings at which students, faculty,
staff and community members
attempted to reassure the student
body, a concept "unique to cam
pus" according to Liu.
"We are trying to make people
more at ease on campus during
this emotionally draining month
and provide moral support," Liu
said.
"It is highly unusual to have

three such occurrences in one
month," said Colvig. "They do not
appear to be connected in any way
except by time and place."
"People are treating these as
freak incidents," said Jennifer
Packer, university editor of The
Daily Californian newspaper.
"They are more scared, but they
do not plan to do anything dras
tic."
The UC-Berkeley and commu
nity police departments have
increased patrols in order to reas

sure campus residents.
The Chancellor's Advisory
Committee on Community Safety,
formed at Berkeley during the
summer before any of the inci
dents occurred, has been given
"an increased sense of urgency
and purpose",Liu said.
However, the university
believes that increased security
would not have prevented the
tragic incident.
"In a logical sense, there is no
relationship between the random
act of a deranged gunman and
University plans to make the

campus as safe as possible," said
Colvig.
He added, "The incident raises
questions beyond the University
to issues such as mental health
treatment. It is a problem for all
of society."
In reaction to the deadly fra
ternity blaze, UC-Berkeley offi
cials are taking a closer look at
the sprinkler systems in off-cam
pus housing.
Although the cause of the fire
has not yet been determined,the
fire spread quickly partially
because of the lack of a sprinkler

system.
"The message was clearly sent
to all campuses in California to
look closely [at their housing
arrangements]," said Colvig.
"The shock of this (fire) has
struck the Greek system very
hard, as well as other students,
faculty and members of the com
munity," said Colvig.
In the case of the telephoned
bomb hoax, campus officials
chose to evacuate the entire cam
pus. Despite receiving regular
bomb threats, the latest occur
rence was taken seriously

"because of the way in which the
phone call was made," said
Packer.
In reality, there is little stu
dents can do to prevent these type
of random incidents from occur
ring in the future, according to
Liu.
"The best thing for students to
do in the future is to be more
aware of the situations they place
themselves in and be more careful
when they walk across campus.
Many have already begun to do
this," he said.
