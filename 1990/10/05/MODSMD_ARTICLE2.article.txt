Students at UC-Berkeley are strug
gling to cope with a series of tragedies
that struck the campus over the last
month.
The month began with a fire on Sept.
8 at the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity
house that killed three students and
injured two others.
Eleven days later, a telephoned bomb
threat forced the evacuation of all
42,000 students, faculty and staff for

dents hostage in a popular Berkeley bar

for seven and one-half hours, ultimately
killing one student and injuring six oth
ers before being killed himself by a
police SWAT team.
"The general student reaction (to
these three incidents) has been a variety
of emotions: sorrow, fear, confusion,
anxiety, etc.," said Bonaparte Liu, presi
dent of the Associated Students of the
University of California. "For first-year
students, this has been a sad, tragic
introduction to their years at Cal."
The university has taken several
steps to help students cope with the
tragedies.
University counselors have held
many interpersonal trauma and stress

workshops, and the deadline to drop
classes has been extended for students
who feel overwhelmed by the tragedies.
"The campus had to make use of ser
vices and emergency plans in ways not
intended," said Ray Colvig, public infor
mation officer for UC-Berkeley.
"In retrospect, everything worked
well," he added. "People worked hard
and did their jobs with skill and caring.
This went beyond the university to the
city and community."
The university held two campus
gatherings at which students, faculty,
staff and community members
