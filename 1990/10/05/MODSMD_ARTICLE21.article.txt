## Compassion for Cal 
### 
UPON ARRIVAL on campus,
every Stanford student
becomes indoctrinated into
the Stanford-Berkeley rivalry.
Although this 93-year-old competi
tion culminates each year with
November's Big Game, the school
rivalry continues throughout the
school year. Sympathy or compas
sion for Berkeley, according to the
rules of the rivalry, would be a Car
dinal sin.
However, the recent rash of
traumatic events which have
plagued the Berkeley campus
supersede blind cheers of school
spirit.
On Sept. 8, the Berkeley chapter
of Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity
caught fire, claiming the lives of
three students before dawn. On
Sept. 19, the entire campus was
evacuated for the first time in
Berkeley's history after a bomb
threat.
Finally, at midnight on Sept. 28,

Mehrdad Dashti, a 30-year old car
penter with a police record and a
history of mental illness, opened
fire upon 33 people in Henry's
Publick House and Grille.
In the aftermath of the ordeal,
Berkeley senior John Sheehy died
from a chest wound, and nine oth
ers — five of them students —
were wounded from the gunfire.
Berkeley students have united
together in an effort to deal with
their emotional trauma from the
three incidents. Crisis hotlines and
psychological services have been
set up to help students and faculty
members emotionally cope.
The impact of these events
should not be diminished in impor
tance by mere school spirit. As
Stanford students, we should take
a step back from the rivalry itself
and offer our compassion and sym
pathy to our peers at Berkeley.
Unfortunate incidents such as
these are tragedies for all of
mankind.
