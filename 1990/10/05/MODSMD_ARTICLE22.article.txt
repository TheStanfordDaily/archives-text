# A 						conservation car

### 
The urgency with which
the Persian Gulf crisis hit the
United States greatly exem
plifies our dependency on oil and
exhorts us to re-examine our ener
gy policies immediately.
Energy conservation should be
an important item on our agenda,
and the electric car developed by
the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Project
at Stanford is a formidable step
toward lowering our oil consump
tion.
The hybrid car can be powered
entirely by electricity for trips less
than 25 miles.
The wide-spread use of such a
car would cut down on our depen
dency on oil and reduce harmful
emissions that damage the envi
ronment, thus complying with

California state laws.
The goverment should consider
subsidizing the production of elec
tric cars, lowering the cost and
making them more attractive to
consumers.
At the same time, further
research and development should
be encouraged and funded. Tough
but reasonable guidelines for bet
ter, safer models that can travel
longer distances should be devised
to ensure a future market.
Until then, transitional models
should be tested. The government
should also set an example in pio
neering the use of electric cars. It is
laudable that some post office vehi
cles are already utilizing electricity,
but a greater effort is needed to
popularize the new development.
