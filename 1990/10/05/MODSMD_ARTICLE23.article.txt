Football fans should give yell leaders another chance

I am writing to comment on the letter
entitled "Yell leaders are a bad idea
gone worse" which was featured in
the Oct. 1 Daily.
There is no question in my mind that
the yell leaders have a long way to go in
their efforts to increase spirit at the foot
ball games and that they need to adapt
their approach to fit the crowd with
whom they are working. However, there
is more than one way to react to such a
perceived need for change.
One way is to attack these fellow stu

dents with acidic and degrading com
ments, but what does this accomplish?
Resentment? Yes. Bitterness? Yes. Better
spirit and yell leaders? No.
We can all go back to our childhoods
to remember how we were told to be nice
to each other. Few of us can forget the
fantasy stories in which a young person
was given a magical sword of power by a
wise mentor with the words: "Use this
only for good, never for evil."
We all tell young children to be nice,
yet we can't seem to do it ourselves. We

have been blessed with a free press, a
responsibility and indeed a great power.
Do we need to tear people down with
this power, when it gives us the opportu
nity to build them up and encourage
improvement? Needing to do this only
reveals our own insecurities.
We all need to grow up and abandon
our need to attack others. Let's use our
press constructively, not destructively —
for good, never for evil.
To the cheerleaders, I say, "Keep
going!" Anyone who has the guts to get

up in front of our strong-minded
Stanford crowd deserves some support!
And one final note: Should the Beach
Boys ever return to Stanford, I would
suggest that anyone in the crowd so vio
lently appalled by the performance as
evidently some were ought to leave the
stadium rather than encourage the
depravity. Or they could lighten up and
have fun. I prefer the latter.
