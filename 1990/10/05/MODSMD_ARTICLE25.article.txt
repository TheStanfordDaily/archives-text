# Games on holidays are not insensitive
## 
### 
Before condemning the Athletic
Department's "callousness" and "insensi
tivity" regarding the scheduling of the
San Jose State football game and the
Beach Boys concert on Yom Kippur
(Daily, Oct. 3), we suggest that Todd
David take a look at any Stanford calen
der. NO religious events are given special
attention; it is winter break, not
Christmas Break, and spring break, not
Easter Break. The holidays Stanford does
recognize are Thanksgiving, Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, President's Day and

Memorial Day.
Rather than finding the Athletic
Department's behavior "unconcerned" or
"ignorant," we find it fully in line with
Stanford policy. Maybe the department
chose that particular Saturday for the
Beach Boys concert because it was the
first home game that ALL classes could
attend.
Furthermore, as any football fan can
tell you, Christmas Day is replete with
college bowl games.
As we see it, no offense was committed;
no apology is necessary.
