In response to David Hyatt's letter in
the Oct. 1 Daily:
A little more cheering and spirit from
the diffident Stanford student section
might be just what is needed for a win
ning football team!
When Crazy George started beating
his drum in the San Jose section, you
could feel their team come alive!! The
Stanford band is a big "Moan" these days

— an anachronism whose antics are
childish. ...
Cheers!!
