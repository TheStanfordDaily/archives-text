## Fruit flies and memories 
### 
The fruit fly quarantine was over.
The signs which had previously
warned the public (and successfully
convinced small pesky mosquitoes not to
fly within restricted areas) were now cov
ered with "Eradicated — We Thank You"
notices. Sometime over the summer, the
Stanford community had scoped the area
and destroyed the entire fruit fly popula
tion, boldly proclaiming their accomplish
ment with notices declaring that no fly
would dare return.
As I drove up toward the Stanford
campus this fall, eagerly searching for a
familiar face, I was instead immediately
confronted with this startling informa
tion. My first reaction was a gut one: "By
God," I thought, "what a wonderful, pow
erful institution this Stanford University
is." But as I drove on toward my new
sophomore home in Sterling Quadrangle,
I had plenty of time to consider the deeper
implications of the complete extermina
tion of the local fruit fly community. The
question that was raised appeared to me
in this form:
1) In recent months, the Stanford com
munity has worked together to accom
plish the eradication of certain agricul
tural problems. In a short, two-page
paper, describe several similar personal
accomplishments of your summer and/or
Stanford career.
I quickly began to form an outline of
my summer experiences on the front
cover of the great big blue book in my
mind.
1) bought a few CDs
2) rented a bunch of movies
3) read a couple of books

4) met a girl named Bubbles
But, as I tried to flesh out my outline,
I was forced to own up to the fact that
none of my summer experiences could
even compare to the fruit fly thing. What
I needed was a contribution to the com
munity at large, an accomplishment of
some kind, some sort of a Raid can I could
place on that bathroom shelf we affec
tionately call Life.
"Forget the summer," I blurted (men
tally) as the car rounded past the Stan
ford Hospital, "I'm sure I did something
last year." But alas, my search was to no
avail. I hadn't done any of the things I
promised I would accomplish during my
frosh year. I hadn't done any volunteering
for the local community. I hadn't gotten
straight A's. I hadn't even gotten A's tick
ets. I hadn't made a habit of flossing
everyday. And worst of all, no one had yet
told me 1 had become a more multicul
tural person.
By the time I turned onto Santa
Theresa street, I had come to two conclu
sions. First of all, Sterling Quad is really
far. Second, I decided that this year was
going to be different. I was going to do all
those things I promised to do. I pulled the
floss out of the glove compartment and
concentrated hard on all the things that
lay ahead of me. I was a sophomore,
dammit; I should be kissing up to profes
sors, applying for internships and run
ning various (or is it sundry?) student
organizations. I was a sophomore and, if
nothing else, I was going to use more
parentheses this year (they're so colle
giate).
It's been a week since I first drove up

to the Governor's Corner parking lot, and
I'm now forced to ask myself what I have
accomplished. Let's see.... I joined the
Price Club and bought a gallon of Clini
cally Proven Anti-Plaque Pre-Brushing
Dental Rinse (seven dollars — what a bar
gain!). I got my oil changed. I finally
found out where the Great Works lectures
had been held. And I even helped some
one build a loft.
Well, I guess I haven't exactly lived up
to the Stanford student I feel that I was
supposed to be — nor the one that was
described in Approaching Stanford. But I
did meet some nice people and take some
interesting classes. And most of all, I had
a good time.
Who cares if I didn't end a pestilence?
I'll leave that for the big organizations.
For now, I'm content to just enjoy myself,
make some new friends, learn a few
things, and strengthen my tooth enamel.
Screw the fruit.

Joel Stein would like to know which flag
Germany is using, and if he can have the
other one. His column will appear every
Friday.

"Forget the summer," I blurted (men
tally) as the car rounded past the Stan
ford Hospital, "I'm sure I did something
last year." But alas, my search was to no
avail. I hadn't done any of the things I
promised I would accomplish during my
frosh year. I hadn't done any volunteering
for the local community. I hadn't gotten
straight A's. I hadn't even gotten A's tick
ets. I hadn't made a habit of flossing
everyday. And worst of all, no one had yet
told me 1 had become a more multicul
tural person.
By the time I turned onto Santa
Theresa street, I had come to two conclu
sions. First of all, Sterling Quad is really
far. Second, I decided that this year was
going to be different. I was going to do all
those things I promised to do. I pulled the
floss out of the glove compartment and
concentrated hard on all the things that
lay ahead of me. I was a sophomore,
dammit; I should be kissing up to profes
sors, applying for internships and run
ning various (or is it sundry?) student
organizations. I was a sophomore and, if
nothing else, I was going to use more
parentheses this year (they're so colle
giate).
It's been a week since I first drove up

to the Governor's Corner parking lot, and
I'm now forced to ask myself what I have
accomplished. Let's see.... I joined the
Price Club and bought a gallon of Clini
cally Proven Anti-Plaque Pre-Brushing
Dental Rinse (seven dollars — what a bar
gain!). I got my oil changed. I finally
found out where the Great Works lectures
had been held. And I even helped some
one build a loft.
Well, I guess I haven't exactly lived up
to the Stanford student I feel that I was
supposed to be — nor the one that was
described in Approaching Stanford. But I
did meet some nice people and take some
interesting classes. And most of all, I had
a good time.
Who cares if I didn't end a pestilence?
I'll leave that for the big organizations.
For now, I'm content to just enjoy myself,
make some new friends, learn a few
things, and strengthen my tooth enamel.
Screw the fruit.

Joel Stein would like to know which flag
Germany is using, and if he can have the
other one. His column will appear every
Friday.
