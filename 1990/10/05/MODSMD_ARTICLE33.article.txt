Dear Bug,
When I told an upperclassman
I wanted to mtyor in "Femi Stu,"
she laughed in my face. I felt so
stupid — and I still haven't fig

funny! Help.

Dear Freshperson,
Relax, you are not stupid —
just foolish and naive. Recklessly
ripping apart words and creating
your own ridiculous abbreviations
is a common StuFreßlu (Stupid
Freshman Blunders).
The abbreviations for Stan
ford terms are just as irregular as
the rules of English grammar. As
you'll soon discover in Freshman
English, we say one mouse, two
mice, BUT one house, two houses
(not "hice," as you might expect).
In Stanford talk, Political Science
becomes Poli Sci. Now, you'd
expect Feminist Studies to
become Femi Stu. But NO , it's
Fem Stud — because there are no
rules for this local jargon! Eco
nomics becomes Econ, Communi
cations turns into Comm, BUT
Philosophy never Phil, Italian
never Ital.
In general California talk,
many words and expressions can
become abbreviated to just
"Dude!"
As far as buildings go, Memo
rial Church is Mem Chu, but His

you'd definitely sound like an

Dear Bug,
When I passed Synergy the

noises coming from the lounge
area. Was this a natural or

Dear R. 0.,
While nobody can be exactly
sure what goes on at Synergy, a fly
on the wall heard it from a friend
who heard it from a resident that,
indeed, much clicking does go on
at Synergy. This clicking phe
nomenon occurs when residents
join middle finger to thumb, apply
pressure, and then push off with
the two fingers causing them to go
their respective ways. While out
siders might call this process
snapping, a resident suggested I
withhold usage of this word until
the house votes on a more fitting
title for the process.
Residents make the clicking
noise during house meetings
when they wish to show their
approval for something. At a
recent meeting, when someone
proposed, "Let's make this a vege
tarian dorm," the clicking
response was so furious that sev
eral houses on the Row reported
tremors.
The Row Office then barred
the house from voting on the pro
posal, "Let's all eat out of one
dish."
