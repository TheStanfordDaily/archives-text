The Board of Trustees announced that
Memorial Church, damaged in the 1906
temblor, would be "restored to its former
magnificence" within a year at a cost of
about $500,000. The architects, Ward and
Blohme, said there would be only one
change from the original plan. The church

would be built with steel and concrete,
instead of brick. "This method of building
will make the church practically earth
quake-proof," or so they said.
Let's see. It cost us $500,000 for Mem
Chu to last 76 years. Not a bad deal at all.
Now, though, we're going to have to pay
$10 million to restore it. At that rate, it
should last over 1500 years, or, in layman's
terms, almost as long as Stem food. Per
sonally, I say get Ward and Blohme back
here, coffins and all, and give them half a

mil for another 76 years. But this time, no
false advertising.

A debate between Stanford men and Cal
women on the topic "Resolved, That the
Daughters of the American Revolution
Should Continue to Exist" was canceled by „
Cal due to the threat of blacklisting by the
DAR. Cal proposed that, instead, the topic
should be "Resolved, That There Should

Be Free Speech on University Campi."
Now I may not be much of a forensics
expert, but doesn't it seem like Cal might
have a difficult time arguing the pro side?
I mean, aren't "free speech " and "blacklist
ing" sort of entirely opposites? But you
can't fault Cal. I mean, who would want to
be denied the chance to go to balls spon
sored by a group of women with a major
historical event for a father? By the way, I
guess the grounds of Cal are pretty
"campi."
