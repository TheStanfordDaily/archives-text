# Don't lose at the 'Fart Game!'
## 
### Ken Wharton 
After at least four minutes of deep
thought, I've come to the conclusion
that mankind's greatest achievement
has been adapting life's problems into
fun and useful activities.
One example is the way the univer
sity has used the earthquake damage as
justification for furthering its dream of
converting all of Northern California
into a huge, "temporary" trailer park.
Another place we see this adaptation
is in our reaction to University Food
Service. Instead of letting it drive us to
starvation, we use it as the focus of
many mealtime games, including
"Guess that meat!" and "How many
weeks will that rice stick to the ceiling?"
But I think the best example of con
verting a deadly danger into a fun and
stimulating event has to be The Fart
Game.
I learned this game during a spring
break road trip, during which we ate
foods which were not exactly conducive
to the seismic activities in our car.
For those of you who have yet to be
exposed to this exciting game, here's
how it worked. When somebody let one
rip, everyone quickly stuck their thumb
to their forehead with their fingers
pointing into the air. (You should prac
tice this in front of a mirror until you
feel confident you look like a complete
fool.) The last one to do this, according
to the rules of the game, had to "eat the
fart-
None of us were quite sure what this
meant, but it was obviously a terrible
fate that should be avoided at all costs.
There were a variety of clues that
told us someone had "played." Some of
the farts were audible, and would not
only make it sound like we were under
attack by heavy artillery, but might
actually burn holes in the car seat. Oth
ers were more subtle, and needed to be
detected by noticing other people with
their thumbs to their forehead, listening
for groans of disgust or watching road
side animals die by the hundreds. And of

course, if all else failed, the odor would
eventually reach you, knocking you
unconscious.
Although this game is extraordinar
ily fun, some people are simply too
embarrassed to play the fart game at all.
You know the type; they've grown up in
a world where farts are never talked
about, and would probably gasp at the
phrase "anal vapor."
If you have ever farted in a room with
such a person, you know that they
would no sooner mention it than the
details of their grandmother's intestinal
surgery. Instead, they'll make some
lame excuse about the heat and open the
window. The expensive restaurants with
enough silverware to arm a small coun
try always seem to draw these "fart
ignorers."
Someone could be sitting there, toot
ing like Dizzy Gillespie, making the
place smell as if barnyard animals were
being slaughtered in the kitchen, and
nobody will say a word.

Unless, of course, there is a "fart
observer" present, who, in the tradition
of Mr. BofTo, would loudly comment,
"Well, if it was a whoopee cushion, let's
see it!" Of course, this is the reason that
these two types of people simply don't
associate with each other.
However, I think that the "fart ignor
ere" of the world should be forced to
participate in the Fart Game, just like
the rest of us. Maybe intense exposure
would help; we could send these people
to "fart camps," where they'd all be
force-fed my Aunt Martha's baked
beans and then confined to small odor
retaining areas.
It just might help them realize that
farts, after all, are merely natural bio
logical functions, and because they are
going to happen, we might as well laugh
about it.
Or we could simply tell them that if
they don't play, they're going to be the
one who has to eat the fart.
