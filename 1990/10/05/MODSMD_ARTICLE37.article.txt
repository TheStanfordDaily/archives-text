## Resurgent spikers plan to please home crowd tonight 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Starting outside hitter Jennifer Jackson is certain
that Stanford has never played so poorly as the
squad did against UCLA in its home stand two weeks
ago.
Her teammates are just as certain that the Cardi
nal will not play so poorly before its fans again.
Stanford has a chance to reinforce this point at
Burnham Pavilion this weekend. The No. 6 Cardinal
(8-2, 5-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play) will face
Washington State University tonight at 7:30 and the
University of Washington tomorrow at the same
time.
"We're basically trying to go in with the right atti
tude," junior All-American Kristin Klein said. "It
will be especially exciting playing for our fans."
Just who exactly will do the playing remains a
question mark. In last weekend's Arizona excursion,
Cardinal players suffered a variety of injuries. Start
ing middle blocker Jessica Benton, who experienced
back pains against the University of Arizona, contin
ues to recover. She will be unavailable this weekend.
Sophomore Kristi Paaso, a staring left-side hitter
last season, remains sidelined due to back problems.
She will likely be out for another two weeks.
Klein and Jackson have experienced mild aggra
vations of previous injuries, and sophomore Ail-
American Bev Oden is coping with a groin pull. All
three starters, however, will play.
In Benton's absence, junior Nicole Appleman will
likely start tonight and freshman Heidi Eick can
expect increased game time. Appleman, an El Toro,
Calif., native, comes off a solid performance against
Arizona State University and can provide the Cardi
nal with effective blocking and quick hitting.
Eick made her Stanford debut against ASU. The
5-foot-ll blocker is a highly-touted high school Ail-
American and was a teammate of backup setter
Piper Hahn at Mira Costa.
Depite the personnel shifts, the Cardinal remains
a formidable team. Stanford is undefeated on the
road this season and has squashed several ranked
teams.
Oden is taking an early lead in National Player-of
the-Year consideration. The 6-foot-2 middle blocker
leads the Pac-10 currently in hitting percentage and
kills average, is third in blocks average and is ninth
in digs average. Oden is capable of taking over
matches, as she did against UCLA when she bruised
the Bruin block with 29 kills and a .454 hitting per
centage.
Shaw may not need to tap all of his offensive
resources against Washington State (8-7) and the
University of Washington (4-7). Both teams are cur
rently 2-3 in the Pac-10 and tied with three other
squads for fifth place in the conference.
The Cougars of Washington State are dependent
upon junior outside hitter Kelly Hankins. Hankins is
the third leading percentage hitter in the conference
and trails only Oden in lulls average. The 6-foot-1
transfer from Weber State hits left-handed and pro
vides the Cardinal with a unique defensive chal
lenge.
While their season has been disappointing thus

far, Washington comes off a home victory over Wash
ington State. The Huskies start a young squad due
to the graduation of standout setter Melinda Beck
enhauer and two other seniors last year. The team's
.132 hitting percentage qualifies them as the
league's worst attacking squad.
"They're young, inexperienced, but talented,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said. "They are a net-ori
ented team, and they're pretty big."
With all respect, these things should be irrele
vant. "I think we're a better team [than Washington
and Washington State]," Klein said. "If we focus, if
we play well, these other things shouldn't matter."
The Cardinal indeed is gaining momentum. Klein
is hitting .305 on the season and is third in both kills
and digs average in the Pac-10. Middle blocker Amy
Cooper is the league's sixth best percentage hitter
and a powerful quick attacker. Setter Carrie Feld
man is sixth in assists average despite divided play
ing time with freshman Hahn. Jackson is a potent
outside hitter and continues to improve rapidly.
"I think we're doing well," Jackson said. "We're
making progress. Passing is something we always
have to work on, but it's getting better."
Much of this may have to do with the number of
specialists Stanford can feature. Redshirt freshman
Kathy Jurgens has solidified a backrow position with
impeccable passing and defensive work. Sophomore
Laurie Sawin is the team's most spectacular
defender and is capable of making numerous saves.
Seniors Cheryl Conly and Tracy Hughes also provide
experienced ball-handling capabilities.
The Cardinal also plays freshman outside hitter
Danielle Everett who competes for Jackson's start
ing spot. But Jackson, a graduate of nearby St. Fran
cis High, is starting for the first time in her career
this season and is intent on holding her position.
When she takes the floor against Washington State
tonight, it will be only the second homestand she has
started.
"I feel pretty good about it," Jackson said. "I've
come a long way but I should be playing better."
She and her teammates appear to be doing just
that.
Card Notes:
Stanford's nemesis, UCLA, continues to thrive. The
Bruins are 6-0 in the Pac-10, 13-1 on the year, and ranked
No. 1 by the Tachikara Coaches' Poll. They are currently
on a 10-match winning streak.
Maybe it's Maples. Stanford practices and plays most of
its matches at Burnham Pavilion. The only two times the
Cardinal has lost this season was at Maples Pavilion.
The Mira Costa connection is alive and kicking at Stan
ford. Hahn who hails from Mira Costa high school has
played extensively this year. Her best hitter at Mira Costa,
Heidi Eick, played for the first time against Arizona State
and is expected to play tonight. Mira Costa men's setter
Canyon Ceman is the top Cardinal recruit and should con
tribute heavily in the winter.
Maybe it's Burnham. The last time a Stanford volley
ball team, men's or women's, lost at Burnham Pavilion was
Nov. 17, 1989. Since then, the women are 3-0 and the men
are undefeated. By the way, that last loss was to Washing
ton, Saturday's opponent.

Burnham Pavilion this weekend. The No. 6 Cardinal
(8-2, 5-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play) will face
Washington State University tonight at 7:30 and the
University of Washington tomorrow at the same
time.
"We're basically trying to go in with the right atti
tude," junior All-American Kristin Klein said. "It
will be especially exciting playing for our fans."
Just who exactly will do the playing remains a
question mark. In last weekend's Arizona excursion,
Cardinal players suffered a variety of injuries. Start
ing middle blocker Jessica Benton, who experienced
back pains against the University of Arizona, contin
ues to recover. She will be unavailable this weekend.
Sophomore Kristi Paaso, a staring left-side hitter
last season, remains sidelined due to back problems.
She will likely be out for another two weeks.
Klein and Jackson have experienced mild aggra
vations of previous injuries, and sophomore Ail-
American Bev Oden is coping with a groin pull. All
three starters, however, will play.
In Benton's absence, junior Nicole Appleman will
likely start tonight and freshman Heidi Eick can
expect increased game time. Appleman, an El Toro,
Calif., native, comes off a solid performance against
Arizona State University and can provide the Cardi
nal with effective blocking and quick hitting.
Eick made her Stanford debut against ASU. The
5-foot-ll blocker is a highly-touted high school Ail-
American and was a teammate of backup setter
Piper Hahn at Mira Costa.
Depite the personnel shifts, the Cardinal remains
a formidable team. Stanford is undefeated on the
road this season and has squashed several ranked
teams.
Oden is taking an early lead in National Player-of
the-Year consideration. The 6-foot-2 middle blocker
leads the Pac-10 currently in hitting percentage and
kills average, is third in blocks average and is ninth
in digs average. Oden is capable of taking over
matches, as she did against UCLA when she bruised
the Bruin block with 29 kills and a .454 hitting per
centage.
Shaw may not need to tap all of his offensive
resources against Washington State (8-7) and the
University of Washington (4-7). Both teams are cur
rently 2-3 in the Pac-10 and tied with three other
squads for fifth place in the conference.
The Cougars of Washington State are dependent
upon junior outside hitter Kelly Hankins. Hankins is
the third leading percentage hitter in the conference
and trails only Oden in lulls average. The 6-foot-1
transfer from Weber State hits left-handed and pro
vides the Cardinal with a unique defensive chal
lenge.
While their season has been disappointing thus

far, Washington comes off a home victory over Wash
ington State. The Huskies start a young squad due
to the graduation of standout setter Melinda Beck
enhauer and two other seniors last year. The team's
.132 hitting percentage qualifies them as the
league's worst attacking squad.
"They're young, inexperienced, but talented,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said. "They are a net-ori
ented team, and they're pretty big."
With all respect, these things should be irrele
vant. "I think we're a better team [than Washington
and Washington State]," Klein said. "If we focus, if
we play well, these other things shouldn't matter."
The Cardinal indeed is gaining momentum. Klein
is hitting .305 on the season and is third in both kills
and digs average in the Pac-10. Middle blocker Amy
Cooper is the league's sixth best percentage hitter
and a powerful quick attacker. Setter Carrie Feld
man is sixth in assists average despite divided play
ing time with freshman Hahn. Jackson is a potent
outside hitter and continues to improve rapidly.
"I think we're doing well," Jackson said. "We're
making progress. Passing is something we always
have to work on, but it's getting better."
Much of this may have to do with the number of
specialists Stanford can feature. Redshirt freshman
Kathy Jurgens has solidified a backrow position with
impeccable passing and defensive work. Sophomore
Laurie Sawin is the team's most spectacular
defender and is capable of making numerous saves.
Seniors Cheryl Conly and Tracy Hughes also provide
experienced ball-handling capabilities.
The Cardinal also plays freshman outside hitter
Danielle Everett who competes for Jackson's start
ing spot. But Jackson, a graduate of nearby St. Fran
cis High, is starting for the first time in her career
this season and is intent on holding her position.
When she takes the floor against Washington State
tonight, it will be only the second homestand she has
started.
"I feel pretty good about it," Jackson said. "I've
come a long way but I should be playing better."
She and her teammates appear to be doing just
that.
Card Notes:
Stanford's nemesis, UCLA, continues to thrive. The
Bruins are 6-0 in the Pac-10, 13-1 on the year, and ranked
No. 1 by the Tachikara Coaches' Poll. They are currently
on a 10-match winning streak.
Maybe it's Maples. Stanford practices and plays most of
its matches at Burnham Pavilion. The only two times the
Cardinal has lost this season was at Maples Pavilion.
The Mira Costa connection is alive and kicking at Stan
ford. Hahn who hails from Mira Costa high school has
played extensively this year. Her best hitter at Mira Costa,
Heidi Eick, played for the first time against Arizona State
and is expected to play tonight. Mira Costa men's setter
Canyon Ceman is the top Cardinal recruit and should con
tribute heavily in the winter.
Maybe it's Burnham. The last time a Stanford volley
ball team, men's or women's, lost at Burnham Pavilion was
Nov. 17, 1989. Since then, the women are 3-0 and the men
are undefeated. By the way, that last loss was to Washing
ton, Saturday's opponent.

Jessica Benton, Jennifer Jackson and their teammates want to show the Stanford fans how good they
really are this weekend. Despite their overwhelming talent, the Cardinal has been disappointing at home
so far this year, thanks to UCLA and UOP.
Starting outside hitter Jennifer Jackson is certain
that Stanford has never played so poorly as the
squad did against UCLA in its home stand two weeks
ago.
Her teammates are just as certain that the Cardi
nal will not play so poorly before its fans again.
