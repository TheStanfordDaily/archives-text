# Senior Gillingham leads Cardinal with experience
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Life in the trenches is the
equivalent of athletic anonymi
ty.
No receptions, no intercep
tions, no glory
The only public recognition
most offensive linemen get is
when they're called for holding
and have their name announced
over the public address system
to a chorus of boos.
But not Chuck Gillingham.
The fifth-year senior is Stan
ford's unofficial team spokes
man. Jason Palumbis, Glyn Mil
burn and Ed McCaffrey may be
the most noticeable during the
Cardinal's contests, but after
the game there always seems to
be a crowd of journalists around
Gillingham.
Everyone knows who this
lineman is.
"Linemen might not get at
tention but he always seems to
get his name in the paper. He's a
good quote. He's not hesitant to
say what he feels," offensive co
ordinator Ron Turner said.
And thats what sports writ
ers like to hear. After listening
to the rah-rah team outlooks of
many of today's athletes, jour
nalists are lured to Gillingham's
blatant critiques.
He obliges his listeners.
"You have to be pretty honest
and take an objective look at
yourself. Against San Jose State
I thought we played like horse
dog. Why candy coat it? I don't
think we gave San Jose enough
credit. They came out and did
the things they needed to win
the game, and that's what these
guys need to realize. It takes a
lot to win a football game. You
have to be very objective be
cause if you're not then you'll
make the same mistakes.
"One thing you have to do is
come out and say the things that
need to be said even if they are
hard things. If you played like
that you have to come out and
say we played like s—. I realize
that and go on from there,"
Gillingham said.
While other players may not
emulate his blunt style, they do
look to him for pointers.
As the "old man" on the line,
the fifth-year senior has become
the resident question man.
Whether it's formations, game
situations, or hostile stadiums,
Gillingham is willing to oblige.
"Some of the younger guys
are skeptical. Darran [Baird]
and I used to laugh at the older
guys too. But being around four
years you get to a point when
you know how things are going;
you kinda get a feel for things.
You get a feel for the coaches,
you get a feel for the players and
what is happening out there."
"He's really good at providing
leadership on the individual
level. He's great at giving advice
on a certain play or game situa
tion, or on what a stadium is
like or what to expect from a
crowd if he has been there be
fore," Turner said.
In fact, the coaching staff al
most expects him to lead the
young line.
"During timeouts I confer
with coach Schuhmann, and he
tries to tell me what to tell the
guys. It's more of a leadership
role. I have more of a feel for
what's going on," Gillingham
added.
His perceptions definitely aid

his lineznates, on and off the
field.
The five sophomore first- or
second-string linemen really do
look up to Gillingham ,even if he
is shorter than they are.
"He provides a lot of leader
ship," left tackle Bob Whitfield
said. "He gets us motivated, he
gets us up when we're down. He
teaches me how to hit people.
"We all respect him as an of
fensive lineman and look up to
him. He's the only one who who
calls Coach by his first name."
Not only does the right guard
help his teammates on the field,
but he also gives them guidance
in all areas of life on the Farm.
After four-plus years, there's
probably not much that the for
mer president of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity doesn't know
about.
"He knows everything,"
Whitfield said. "He helps you
out with academic stuff as well
as with football. He's probably
taken all the classes there are.
"But he also teaches us how
not to wear a uniform. He does
not wear a uniform well."
Uniforms aside, Gillingham
has been one of the steadiest
players for the Cardinal during
his four seasons on the Farm.
He has started every game but
one since he became eligible in
1987, and only missed that due
to iryury. Last season he was the
recipient of the team's Iron Man
award for playing on every
down.
The South Bay native is as
versatile as he is durable. He
feels his natural position is
guard, but also plays center
when the team needs him.
"He's a good, solid steady
player," Turner said. "He has a
lot of intensity — he knows
what it takes to play."
Despite the fact that the law
school-bound player does not
see himself as a "star", he is still
excited about his role on the
squad. "My friend at San Jose
State said 'our coach made a
comment that you don't do any
thing spectacular, you just go
out there and do the job,' and
that's what I try to do.
"I'm not an overpowering
physical force by any stretch of
the imagination because of the
surgeries I've had, but one thing
I do do is try to play hard and do
the things the coaches ask me. I
do those things on a consistent
basis and that kind of comes
through."
But doesn't he miss being the
recognition that some of his
teammates in more glamorous

positions receive? Especially
after he played defensive line
and tight end in high school?
"At first I was kind of upset
because in high school I got to
sack the quarterback and catch
the football. I used to think,
'God, the linemen must be
bored,' but there's so much that
goes into it," said Gillingham.
"I got to make a tackle last
weekend. It was pretty exciting.
Seriously, as long as I'm out
there I'm happy. I just like being
out there competing. I hate
going off the field."
While Gillingham has been
on the field quite a bit during
four seasons, Stanford has not
come out on top quite as often.
In fact, the Cardinal has yet to
have a winning season during
his stint on the Farm. The
team's last winning season and
Bowl appearance,1986-87, Gill
ingham watched from the side
lines as a redshirt.
Kicking off the year at 1-3,
Stanford does not look likely to
turn its record around this sea
son, either
Despite this fact, only the ac
tual losses bother the political
science meyor. He has no regrets
about his collegiate football ex
perience.
"Other than the [lack of]
wins I've been satisfied with my
career here. If we just had more
wins I think I could look back
and be satisfied. Wins are the
main thing — that's what you
go out on the field for and that's
why you train for and its disap
pointing when you don't win.
However, I've met a lot of great
people, and it's been a very good
experience for me."
In fact, he actually enjoys
being a part of a rebuilding pro
gram. If you can't win, at least
help the furture Cardinal,
seems to be his attitude.
"When a program falls apart
like it did and you have to start
over from scratch it takes a
while. I wanted, obviously,
things to be a little better this
year. I would have liked to win
those first two games," said
Gillingham.
"One thing that's kind of
neat is to see this program right
ing itself, it's nice to be a part of
that. If it doesn't happen this
year, no matter how much I or
anyone else struggles for it, it's
going to happen in the near fu
ture. It's nice to see that, and its
nice to see a guy like coach [Den
nis] Green do it."
It's nice to see a guy like
Chuck Gillingham giving to
Stanford football.
