### 
TOMORROW - TV:SportsChanel America. 10 a.m. Radio: KZSU (90.1
FM) with the ever knowledgable Brian Webber and Mark McLaughlin,
KCBS (740 AM). 10:18 a.m. klckoff at Notre Dame Stadium.
RECORDS - Stanford (1-3, 1-1 in Pac-10 play), Notre Dame (3-0).
INJURIES - Stanford: tight end Turner Baur out with knee surgery,
defensive back Gary Taylor out with knee surgery. Notre Dame:
corner back Todd Lyght, doubtful with hamstring pull, kicker Billy
Hackett questionable with partially-torn thigh muscle.
MATCHUP — Notre Dame has not lost a home game since 1986. The
additinal facts that it is 3-0 and ranked No.l obviously makes Stanford
the big underdog. But with the execption of its play last weekend,
the Cardinal has actually played very well against two of the nation's
other top teams — Colorado and UCLA. Stanford led the Fighting
Irish until the fourth quarter in last year's match-up, and Notre Dame
definitely is not as talented this season. So don't count out an upset.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis has been playing well, and runningback
Glyn Mllburn and receiver Ed McCaffrey have been playing
phenomlnally. Stanford Is going to be on the alert for Notre
Dame's fantastic flanker/klck-punt returner Raghlb "the Rocket"
Ismail, tailback Ricky Watters, and insidelinebacker Michael
Stonebreaker. Sophomore quarterback Rick Mirer.
