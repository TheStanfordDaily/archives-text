# Women should choose, Yard says

"This is the fight to say that
all American women — regard
less of age, regardless of eco
nomic status, regardless of
where they live — shall be free to
make the decision whether and
when to have children,"
National Organization for
Women President Molly Yard
told a packed audience at Cub
berley Auditorium last night.
Yard drew applause several
times during the rally — the
first in a series of six appear
ances at northern California
campuses — and a standing ova
tion, after which she led the
mostly female audience in
chanting, "Clap your hands,
raise your voice! Californians
are for choice!"
In her half-hour address,
Yard attacked abortion foes,
stressed the importance of safe,
legal birth control and urged
audience members to vote for
pro-choice and female candi
dates, in a tone that ranged from
troubled to triumphant.
"The right wing would have
you believe ... that women in
this country use abortion as
birth control," Yard said. "If
women used abortion as birth
control, they would be getting
three or four each year, or 60 to
70 in their lifetimes.
"The majority of women have
abortions because their birth
control failed, not because they
were being irresponsible," she
continued, "which means we
have to work to get better birth
control in this country."
Yard asked audience members
to sign postcards urging the
manufacturer of RU-486, the
French "abortion pill," to seek
license to distribute it in the
United States. The abortion
inducing drug is being tested
