# Women should choose, Yard says

"This is the fight to say that
all American women — regard
less of age, regardless of eco
nomic status, regardless of
where they live — shall be free to
make the decision whether and
when to have children,"
National Organization for
Women President Molly Yard
told a packed audience at Cub
berley Auditorium last night.
Yard drew applause several
times during the rally — the
first in a series of six appear
ances at northern California
campuses — and a standing ova
tion, after which she led the
mostly female audience in
chanting, "Clap your hands,
raise your voice! Californians
are for choice!"
In her half-hour address,
Yard attacked abortion foes,
stressed the importance of safe,
legal birth control and urged
audience members to vote for
pro-choice and female candi
dates, in a tone that ranged from
troubled to triumphant.
"The right wing would have
you believe ... that women in
this country use abortion as
birth control," Yard said. "If
women used abortion as birth
control, they would be getting
three or four each year, or 60 to
70 in their lifetimes.
"The majority of women have
abortions because their birth
control failed, not because they
were being irresponsible," she
continued, "which means we
have to work to get better birth
control in this country."
Yard asked audience members
to sign postcards urging the
manufacturer of RU-486, the
French "abortion pill," to seek
license to distribute it in the
United States. The abortion
inducing drug is being tested

NOW president Molly Yard speaks last night to a packed Cubberley Auditorium,
abroad as a possible cure for
breast cancer and other diseases.
"I am really outraged that it is
over there in France and it is not
here being tested," she said. "It is
the moral property of women all
over the world."
Yard encouraged students to
register to vote and volunteer to
work on campaigns of NOW
endorsed candidates.
"Our message has to be very
clear at election time," she said.
"The headlines on Nov. 7 will tell
the politicians of this country
that if you want to stay in office
you will support the right of a
woman to control her reproduc
tive life."
She cited Douglas Wilder's suc
cessful campaign last year to be
the first black governor of Vir

ginia as an example of the power
of pro-choice voters.
"If you speak strongly about
the right of a woman to choose, as
Wilder did, you will get out the
women's vote, as well as the vote
of men who care about women."
NOW's renewed emphasis on
pressuring state legislatures coin
cides with the end of a lengthy
approval process for Supreme
Court nominee David Souter, who
has been denounced by NOW for
his non-commital stance on pri
vacy and abortion rights. Souter's
appointment was endorsed Tues
day by the Senate, 90-9.
"I have no trust in the courts
any more," Yard said. "Prior to
Roe v. Wade, illegal botched abor
tions were the leading cause of
maternal deaths in this country."
In two decisions last year, the
Supreme Court upheld states'
rights to require minors seeking
abortions to notify their parents
or obtain permission from a

judge. Pro-choice supporters say
this does not bode well for Roe v.
Wade, the landmark 1973 case
that legalized abortion.
Prior to Yard's speech, a 28-
minute video about 17-year-old
Becky Bell, "Parental Consent,"
drew tears from some audience
members.
Bell, a resident of Indiana,
where state law requires minors
seeking abortions to obtain
parental consent, did not want to
tell her parents she was pregnant,
and died of an infection following
an illegal abortion.
Large blue banners with the
words, "Keep abortion and birth
control safe and legal," and,"In
memory of all the women who
died from illegal abortions," were
draped across the stage and hung
from the balcony. Photographs
and biographical information of
six women who died from illegal
abortions were posted on the
auditorium walls.
