JUST A SHORT NOTE ON the Lisa
Olson controversy. This is some
thing that should resolve itself fairly
soon with a minimum of ranting and rav
ing.
The New England Patriots' players
who directed their lewdness at the Boston
Herald sports writer were extremely out
of line and no doubt caused Ms. Olson a
lot of embarrassment and distress.
But the fact that it occurred shows
that the situation when female writers
are present in such an all-male and all
iiaked environment is very uncomfort
able.
This incident is by no means isolated,
and San Francisco Chronicle columnist
C.W. Nevius recounts several uncalled-for
acts of hostility and profanity directed at
women in some of the Bay Area profes
sional locker rooms.
In yesterday's Chronicle, almost all of
the San Francisco 49ers interviewed
expressed their desire to dress in private
in the absence of women.
Therefore it seems inevitable that
female writers will be banned from pro

fessional locker rooms in the near future.
Along with the
male writers.
You see, it would not be a difficult
arrangement at all if the players either
required to stay in uniform for a few min
utes after the game and answer questions
in a separate press room.
Better still, let the players take their
showers while the reporters and cameras
wait for them in the nearby room.
This way, neither the men nor the
women writers would ever have to enter
the locker room and as a fringe benefit,
the post-game comments might be a little
more coherent after the players (espe
cially those on the losing team) had a
chance to cool down.
Confrontations with hotheads that
end with a reporter getting a microphone
wrapped around his or her head would
become less frequent.
This seems like the only rational and
egalitarian scheme of conducting inter
views.
I think that it is what Cincinnati Ben
gals Coach Sam Wyche was pointing

toward when he banned USA Today foot
ball writer Cecilia Tom from his locker
room after last Sunday's game and
brought a few of his players into a press
room for her to interview.
He slipped up, however, by allowing
the male beat writers into the locker
room, giving them all a privilege not
afforded to Tom.
Stanford uses a press room for post
game interviews after home football and
basketball games, but also allows
reporters in the locker room after the
press room session.
By this time, most of the players have
showered and are in their street clothes.

The Daily's football writer Debbie Span
der enters the locker room to conduct
interviews with little problem.
But in general, it seems that the idea of
communalizing with the players by hav
ing them sweat all over a reporter's
notepad in the locker room will have to
give way to a more comfortable press
room environment.
SPEAKING OF STANFORD football,
if the Cardinal can't pull off the
upset at Notre Dame tomorrow, it
will be stuck with a bowl-hope-ending 1-4
record, which as many have said already,
really does not do justice to what is actu
ally a pretty good team.
Stanford's three losses have come by a
combined margin of only 10 points.
Playing both Colorado and Notre
Dame in addition to a full load of Pacific
10 Conference games just isn't the for
mula for success. Why don't we just go
ahead and add Florida State and Miami
next year?
Don't check the statistics now, but
there is a rumor that the Cardinal's Glyn

Milburn is outperforming Notre Damn's
Heisman Trophy candidate
Ismail.
Ismail has only one touchdown tliis
season while Milburn is making a habit of
breaking a long one every game tha#e
days.
Ismail has almost played himself
contention for the coveted Heismah,
while other rising stars have taken ov*r
the top coverage.
Brigham Young's Ty Detmer was prob
ably leading the pack until he threw fke
interceptions in a loss to Oregon. Still, he
has passed for over 400 yards in four of
his games, and over 500 in the other. A
big plus for Detmer is that he and his
Cougars beat the Miami Hurricanes and
Craig Erickson.
Erickson has thrown for impressive
numbers, and his arm has pro scouts rub
bing their hands in anticipation. Michi
gan's Jon Vaughn leads the nation in
rushing, but one has to wonder if it is
