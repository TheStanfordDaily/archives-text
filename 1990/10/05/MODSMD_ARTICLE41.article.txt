# Keely hopes to guide Stanford to victory in Big Splash
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
In football, there is a quarterback. In basketball,
there is a point guard. And for the Stanford water
polo team, there iH Colin Keely.
Keely, who is a senior this year, is the leader and
co-captain of the No. 3-ranked Cardinal squad that
will take on top-ranked California this afternoon at
3 p.m. at deGuerre pool.

"Colin has evolved into a real leader in the pool,"
coach Dante Dettamanti said. "He sees everything
that's going on around him and is always talking
and using his head out there."
Being a leader is nothing new to Keely, however.
As a teenager, Keely played on the U.S. Junior
National Team and earned the honor of being cap
tain of that team as well.
Leading seems to come naturally to the 6-foot-l,
180-pound Keely. "I do a lot of talking and yelling in

the pool," Keely said. "And even if I wasn't the offi
cial 'captain,' I'd still be doing the same thing."
Cardinal fans are happy that Keely is the team's
leader, but they are even happier that the Orinda,
Calif., native even came to Stanford. After all,
Keely's hometown is right next to Berkeley, he
played at Berkeley during the summers, and most of
all, his two older brothers played water polo at
Berkeley.
Nevertheless, Keely really never had any doubts
about where he wanted to go to school. "Stanford
was just the right place for me," he said. "At first, my
brothers let me hear it a lot for not going to Cal, but
now, they like Stanford and actually root for us."
Coming out of high school, Keely was All-America
in both water polo and swimming, and before too
long, he was displaying his talents for the Cardinal.
By the end of his freshman year, the talented Keely
moved into the starting lineup and has remained
there ever since.
"Colin has definitely been one of our most valu
able players," Dettamanti said. "He doesn't really
stand out as much as some other people, but he's our
best all-around player. What makes him so good is
that he does everything well."
Something else that makes Keely so good is his
exceptional swimming speed. Keely commented,
"My speed really helps me a lot by letting me antici
pate plays and do things that I otherwise wouldn't
be able to pull off."
Dettamanti also feels Keely's speed is a key to his
effectiveness. "His speed helps him in all aspects of
the game, but especially on the counter-attack. He
is one of the best at anticipating and getting out
there on the fast break."
Keely isn't just a speed-burner, however. "He is
probably the smartest and most knowledgeable
player we have in the pool," Dettamanti said.
Keely could not help but agree. "My speed is a big
strength, but more importantly, I think my attitude
and mental concentration are what give me the edge
over my opponents. When I'm in the pool, I get
really competitive and intense and just focus on
doing what it takes to win the game."
At 6 foot 1, Keely is not as tall as most of his oppo

nents, but he is very strong in the water and will
stand his ground with anyone. "You've got to be
tough in the pool, or else they'll kill you," Keely said,
"so I get physical if I have to."
Keely is so tough and fierce that Dettamanti said,
"If I was a player, I wouldn't want to play against
him. You don't mess with Colin."
Fortunately for Dettamanti, all he has to do is
coach Keely, and this has hardly been a chore for the
coach. "Colin is the hardest working guy in the
pool," Dettamanti said. "He is the one guy on the
team who I could leave in for the whole game and
not notice anything different about him. If I need
something done, I know I can count on Colin to do
it."
Something both Dettamanti and Keely want to
get done this year is to accomplish something that
Keely and the other three seniors on the team —
Rick McNair, Chuck Maguy, and Greg Olson — have
not been a part of so far: a National Championship.
When asked what his goal was for this year, Keely
had to look no further than his left hand.
"First and foremost, I don't have a ring on my
finger. My greatest college memory will hopefully
occur sometime later this year around Thanksgiving
time [when the NCAA's are held]."
Today's Pac-10 opener against Cal will be a huge
test for the Cardinal in its pursuit of that elusive
national championship. As Dettamanti said, "This
is our chance to prove ourselves. This will show
whether we're the championship caliber team I
think we are."
If Stanford is to succeed, the team will need a
huge performance from everyone, especially from its
leader. Keely seems ready to take on the challenge.
"This is a big game and it's definitely going to be
pretty intense. Once we get in the water, it's going
to be showtime."

Colin Keely Is quick and tough, and so Is the Cardinal. They are hoping that they are quicker and tougher
than their arch-rival Golden Bears In DeGuerre Pool this afternoon.
In football, there is a quarterback. In basketball,
there is a point guard. And for the Stanford water
polo team, there iH Colin Keely.
Keely, who is a senior this year, is the leader and
co-captain of the No. 3-ranked Cardinal squad that
will take on top-ranked California this afternoon at
3 p.m. at deGuerre pool.

"Colin has evolved into a real leader in the pool,"
coach Dante Dettamanti said. "He sees everything
that's going on around him and is always talking
and using his head out there."
Being a leader is nothing new to Keely, however.
As a teenager, Keely played on the U.S. Junior
National Team and earned the honor of being cap
tain of that team as well.
Leading seems to come naturally to the 6-foot-l,
180-pound Keely. "I do a lot of talking and yelling in

the pool," Keely said. "And even if I wasn't the offi
cial 'captain,' I'd still be doing the same thing."
Cardinal fans are happy that Keely is the team's
leader, but they are even happier that the Orinda,
Calif., native even came to Stanford. After all,
Keely's hometown is right next to Berkeley, he
played at Berkeley during the summers, and most of
all, his two older brothers played water polo at
Berkeley.
Nevertheless, Keely really never had any doubts
about where he wanted to go to school. "Stanford
was just the right place for me," he said. "At first, my
brothers let me hear it a lot for not going to Cal, but
now, they like Stanford and actually root for us."
Coming out of high school, Keely was All-America
in both water polo and swimming, and before too
long, he was displaying his talents for the Cardinal.
By the end of his freshman year, the talented Keely
moved into the starting lineup and has remained
there ever since.
"Colin has definitely been one of our most valu
able players," Dettamanti said. "He doesn't really
stand out as much as some other people, but he's our
best all-around player. What makes him so good is
that he does everything well."
Something else that makes Keely so good is his
exceptional swimming speed. Keely commented,
"My speed really helps me a lot by letting me antici
pate plays and do things that I otherwise wouldn't
be able to pull off."
Dettamanti also feels Keely's speed is a key to his
effectiveness. "His speed helps him in all aspects of
the game, but especially on the counter-attack. He
is one of the best at anticipating and getting out
there on the fast break."
Keely isn't just a speed-burner, however. "He is
probably the smartest and most knowledgeable
player we have in the pool," Dettamanti said.
Keely could not help but agree. "My speed is a big
strength, but more importantly, I think my attitude
and mental concentration are what give me the edge
over my opponents. When I'm in the pool, I get
really competitive and intense and just focus on
doing what it takes to win the game."
At 6 foot 1, Keely is not as tall as most of his oppo

'I get physical if I have to'

nents, but he is very strong in the water and will
stand his ground with anyone. "You've got to be
tough in the pool, or else they'll kill you," Keely said,
"so I get physical if I have to."
Keely is so tough and fierce that Dettamanti said,
"If I was a player, I wouldn't want to play against
him. You don't mess with Colin."
Fortunately for Dettamanti, all he has to do is
coach Keely, and this has hardly been a chore for the
coach. "Colin is the hardest working guy in the
pool," Dettamanti said. "He is the one guy on the
team who I could leave in for the whole game and
not notice anything different about him. If I need
something done, I know I can count on Colin to do
it."
Something both Dettamanti and Keely want to
get done this year is to accomplish something that
Keely and the other three seniors on the team —
Rick McNair, Chuck Maguy, and Greg Olson — have
not been a part of so far: a National Championship.
When asked what his goal was for this year, Keely
had to look no further than his left hand.
"First and foremost, I don't have a ring on my
finger. My greatest college memory will hopefully
occur sometime later this year around Thanksgiving
time [when the NCAA's are held]."
Today's Pac-10 opener against Cal will be a huge
test for the Cardinal in its pursuit of that elusive
national championship. As Dettamanti said, "This
is our chance to prove ourselves. This will show
whether we're the championship caliber team I
think we are."
If Stanford is to succeed, the team will need a
huge performance from everyone, especially from its
leader. Keely seems ready to take on the challenge.
"This is a big game and it's definitely going to be
pretty intense. Once we get in the water, it's going
to be showtime."
