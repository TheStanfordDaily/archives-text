# Men's golf tees off season

### George Malone 
Playing 18 holes of golf for
four consecutive days in the hot
New Mexico sun is not every
Stanford student's idea of the
way to spend the weekend.
That's exactly what the
Stanford men's golf team will
be doing this Thusday through
Sunday as they travel to Las
Cruces, N.M. to play in the
Coca-Cola Classic at New Mex
ico State University in their
first tournament of the season.
Coach Wally Goodwin feels that
this will be a good start to the
season, playing against a fair
field of 16 that includes UC-
Irvine, UCSB, Pepperdine, San
Diego State, Long Beach State,
and host New Mexico State.
Goodwin is very enthusiastic
about this year's team, which is
led by returning Ail-American

Christian Cevaer, a junior from
France. Christian, the captain
of the team, is coming off a fan
tastic year where he placed
eighth in the NCAA Finals. He
has been selected to represent
the U.S. at the World Amateur
Tournament in Christchurch,
New Zealand in mid-October
and should have another out
standing season for the Cardi
nal.
Following Cevaer are two
sophomores, Brad Lanning of
Sarasota, Fla., and Mike Mil
liken (no relation to the junk
bond king) of San Diego, CA.
Both are averaging just over 72
strokes.
Playing the No. 4 and No. 5
spots are a pair of freshmen
who have impacted the team
already. Casey Martin, from
Eugene, OR., is No. 4 and is
immediately ready to contribute

to the team with his solid 73.7-
stroke average. Notah Begay is
the other frosh and comes in
with high expectations already
attached to him. Begay, a
Native-American from Albu
querque, N.M., spent last sum
mer winning the U.S. High
School Championships in San
Diego, finishing second in the
National Insurance Youth Clas
sic, and reaching the semi-finals
of the National Junior Champi
onship.
Goodwin is confident that
the team will be a contender
anywhere they play. He feels
that this is one of the finest
teams he has coached, and he is
very impressed with their matu
rity and will to win. "When we
leave the tourney site, I know
that they have given all that
they can give. They're a bunch
of winners," Goodwin said.
