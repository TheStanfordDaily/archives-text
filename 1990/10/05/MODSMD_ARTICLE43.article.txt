# Women netters face Irish
## 
### Gretchen Atwood 
For the first time ever the
Stanford women's tennis team
travels to Notre Dame to take on
the Fighting Irish. Notre Dame is
trying to insure that today's
match is not a one time only
event. "It's all taken care of by
Notre Dame. They are bringing us
out there. They pay all expenses,"
said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan.
Not only is Notre Dame paying
the players' expenses but they are
also housing them tonight. "We're
staying in the dorms with Notre
Dame players after the match,"
stated Brennan. While this may
be a more relaxed and hospitable
atmosphere than Stanford players
are accustomed to, no one is over
looking that there is a match to

play. Brennan assures that Notre
Dame is "not someone we're going
to blow away."
Indeed the strength of Notre
Dame's rising program is indi
cated by the team's preseason
ranking. The Fighting Irish are
ranked No. 25 in the country and
their top seeded singles player is
ranked No. 34 in the nation.
The NCAA defending national
champion Stanford Cardinal
enter their first match of the year
as the preseason No. 1. Four Stan
ford players are ranked in the top
fifteen. Returning Ail-Americans
Debbie Graham, Sandra Birch,
and Teri Whitlinger are ranked
No. 1, No. 2, and No. 7 respec
tively Also ranked No. 11 in the
preseason poll is freshman Laxmi
Poruri.
How to determine in which

position these stellar athletes will
compete may prove difficult for
Brennan. Because the team has
not yet played challenge matches
Brennan is setting the lineup by
seniority. From 1 to 6 the lineup
is: Debbie Graham, Teri Whit
linger, Laxmi Poruri, Heather Wil
lens, Mario Carruth, and Emma
Woodhouse.
With such a powerful, experi
enced lineup you may wonder why
Stanford plays Notre Dame, a ris
ing program but not a tennis pow
erhouse. According to Brennan
the team is making the trip to
South Bend not only because," It
is a net zero on our budget," but
to help the Notre Dame tennis
program. "We like to help out
other schools who do things aca
demically like we do things," said
Brennan.
