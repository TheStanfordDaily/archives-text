# Cardinal takes playoff hopes into home tourney
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford may be the Disneyland of
the North, but when visitors for this
weekend's women's soccer tournament
come to town, the Cardinal will be shut
ting down all the popular rides.
If Stanford has to be a tourist attrac
tion for visiting teams, coach Berhane
Andeberhan would prefer to have Mal
oney Field compared to a haunted
house.
Scary or not, Maloney will be the fea
tured attraction this weekend as Stan
ford's men's and women's teams host
six teams in an eight-game tournament
lasting two days. Stanford's No. 11
women host Texas Christian Saturday
at noon, then George Mason at the same
time Sunday.
Although Stanford whitewashed Cal
ifornia 1-0 Wednesday to assert its Mal
oney Field meanness, Stanford's perfect
home mark was scarred last weekend by
No. 1 Santa Clara. When the Broncos
beat Stanford 2-1, it snapped Stanford's
run of five straight wins at home. Stan
ford had not lost at Maloney since 1988.
This weekend as Stanford hosts the
Stanford Invitational, Andeberhan's
squad will have a chance to extend its
new home streak. TCU and George

Mason — two teams with losing records
— bring their bags to Maloney and play
ofT-hungry Stanford hopes to give them
the rides of their lives.
"Of the two teams, George Mason is
the stronger traditionally," said Ande
berhan. "TCU has been kind of like us,
they have been building the past two or
three years. They are a little younger as
a program, but they have one of the best
coaches around."
Although Stanford can never afford
to be complacent, the Cardinal will not
be expecting a second meeting with
either team in the playoffs. The TCU
Horned Frogs enter with a 2-7-2 record
after a 5-0 thrashing by No. 14 South
ern Methodist. The George Mason
Patriots come to town with an overall
mark of 2-5-2 despite battling No. 17
Central Florida to a scoreless tie
Wednesday.
"I don't really know TCU all that
well — I haven't seen any of their
games. But I know we played well
against them last year, and we were
fairly evenly matched," he said.
For the record, Stanford crushed the
Horned Frogs 5-0 at Maloney as Jen
nifer Rowland launched two scores, and
Elizabeth Joneschild, Kirby Seale and
Lisa Sime added a goal each.
TCU is led by midfielder Cindy

Rappe, who has tallied five goals. Goalie
Beth Wilson has allowed a less-than
stellar 2.57 goals per game.
Sunday's game against the Patriots
will be televised on a tape-delayed basis
by the Pacific Sports Network on Sun
day, Oct. 13 at 1 pm. Andeberhan said it
will be the first time his team has been
televised.
"It's another signal indicating we are
a growing program, and not just by our
own perception," said Andeberhan. "We
can't be too carried away with it — it's
the by-product of hard work and it
doesn't replace it."
The Patriots' leading scorers — just
three goals each — are forward Laura
Rodriguez and fullback Kelley Harlow.
Goalies Hollis Kosco and Erin O'Neil
have split time in the net.
"George Mason is a power, but they
are not quite as high as they used to be,"
Andeberhan said.
The tournament will give Stanford a
chance to boost its record for the play
offs, where all team eyes are focused.
But the best team in the tournament
may be UC-Santa Barbara, which will
play TCU and George Mason, but not
Stanford. The Gauchos enter with an 8-
0-1 record, including a 1-0 defeat of


Tracy Allen — Dally filo
Frosh phenom Sarah Rafanelll has been somewhat quiet of late after exploding for five
goals in the beginning of this season. She intends to revive her scoring ways this
weekend in a tournament at Maloney Field.
