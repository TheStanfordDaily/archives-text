# Sophomore Talluto beginning to realize potential
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
If you were a soccer coach of a Division I
team, where is the first place you would
start recruiting?
Brazil, Italty, West Germany, Cameroon,
Argentina, England, or Oregon?
Most definitely, it would have to be
Beaverton, Oregon. That is where a highly
respected Dartmouth program, No. 1-
ranked Santa Clara, and Stanford went to
find midfielder Jim Talluto. While Dart
mouth's and Santa Clara's efforts were in
vain, Stanford captured the two-time mem
ber of the U.S. West Regional squad.
Right away, the acquisition paid off. Tal
luto scored four goals in his first four games
on the Farm. However, he fell into a slump
and didn't score a goal for the rest of his
freshman season.
"Last year I was trying too hard,"
explains Talluto. "I overcompensated
because I hadn't scored in four or five
games."
The midfielder's second campaign has

been a different story, though. With the
Cardinal 11 games into the season, Talluto
leads the team in both goals and total
points.
According to Stanford's All-American
midfielder Rhett Harty, Talluto's progress
is an ongoing process. "The last four or five
games, he has played great. But the more
and more he plays in this system, the better
he is going to get."
Coach Colin Lindores agrees. "It proba
bly sounds ungrateful and a little cruel, but
when I see an individual who can entertain
as well as he can, it disappoints me when he
doesn't reach his full potential. He is about
50% there,and it is my job to pull it out of
him."
Hold on. The man who leads his team
with six goals and 13 total points has only
begun to show what he is capable of? Yes,
there are several areas that the midfielder
has been trying to improve on.
Getting too many yellow cards is one of
these areas. Talluto has managed to receive
four, and the fifth will bring a one-game

suspension. Unlike many other players, he
has taken this opportunity to learn from his
situation instead of blaming the officials.
"At the beginning of the year, a couple of
the yellow cards came from tackles," says
Talluto. "It wasn't the type of tackles, it
was the approach to them. Lindores helped
me understand that some of the tackles
looked dangerous to the officials."
Lindores lauds his actions of late. "Tal
luto is playing under a cloud. Since he got
that fourth card September 16, he has been
playing more under control. If this is what
it takes, fine."
The sophomore midfielder has also
learned valuable lessons about focusing on
the match. "The biggest difference between
last season and this season is a mental one.
We have a different level of concentration,"
he says. "There have been periods when our
concentration lacked, but UCLA was a big
game for us."
It certainly was, but it was an especially
big game for Talluto. After the No. 2-
ranked UCLA took the lead in the second

half, the Cardinal midfielder set up a goal
that led to overtime. He picked up a loose
ball around the 18-yard line. Promptly
touching the ball to forward Jason Vana
cour, he bypassed several defenders and
allowed Vanacour to take an open shot at
the net.
His teammates are well aware of his con
tribution. "If Talluto keeps playing at this
level, he is going to be a force," says Harty.
With the first annual Stanford/Security
Pacific National Bank Invitational being
held this weekend, it is important that Tal
luto, as well as his teammates, are forces.
The tournament will host four of the top
men's teams in the country. Stanford will
face Boston University Saturday at 2:00 pm
and South Carolina at the same time Sun
day. The University of San Francisco will
also square off against the eastern competi
tion, but will not face Stanford until later in
the season.
Luckily for all squads involved, no team
from Talluto's home state of Oregon has
been invited to participate.

His teammates are well aware of his con
tribution. "If Talluto keeps playing at this
level, he is going to be a force," says Harty.
With the first annual Stanford/Security
Pacific National Bank Invitational being
held this weekend, it is important that Tal
luto, as well as his teammates, are forces.
The tournament will host four of the top
men's teams in the country. Stanford will
face Boston University Saturday at 2:00 pm
and South Carolina at the same time Sun
day. The University of San Francisco will
also square off against the eastern competi
tion, but will not face Stanford until later in
the season.
Luckily for all squads involved, no team
from Talluto's home state of Oregon has
been invited to participate.
