# Stanford begins title defense against Fighting Irish

### Peter J. Blum 
"We've got to coordinate our shirts and
sweats."
These were the words of men's tennis
coach Dick Gould as he spoke to his squad
in preparation for today's contest against
Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.
He was evidently more concerned with
his team's attire than his upcoming oppo
nent. And for good reason. Although the
Fighting Irish are ranked No. 15 in the
preseason, the Cardinal court-bangers
are coming off of a third-straight NCAA
title, the fourth in five years.
But despite the anticipation of a four
peat, Gould and his team do not want to
underestimate any of their adversaries.
As senior Glenn Solomon said, "Coach
has got us thinking one day at a time."
Nonetheless, the truth of the matter is
that the tennis team is playing a match it
normally would not schedule in the off
season.

As Gould said, "We have only had two
days of actual practice, and we've got to
put the match in perspective. We're going
because the opportunity presents itself
and to help the football team."
With only the losses of Jeff Cathrall to
graduation and Alexis Hombrecher to the
professional tour, the Cardinal's core ele
ments remain intact.
Sophomores Jonathan Stark and
Jared Palmer and seniors Alex O'Brien
and Jason Yee are all returning Ail-Amer
icans who will undoubtably combine with
Solomon to form the nucleus of this
year's team.
On the other hand, balancing out the
five veterans are a crew of five freshmen
— or as Gould says, "rookies."
Led by Chris Cocotos, Vimal Patel and
Michael Flanagan, the frosh are la creme
de la creme: in the 1989 national junior
rankings, Cocotos, of Palm Beach, Fla.,
was ranked No. 1, Patel, of Owensbor
ough, Kent., was ranked No. 4, and

Flanagan, of Dallas, Texas, was ranked
No. 6.
Rounding out the pack of freshmen are
Billy Wright of Beverly Hills, Calif, and
Robert Devins of New York, N.Y.
The key matchup in today's dual
match with the Fighting Irish will be at
No. 1 singles where O'Brien will face
Dave Delucia, the No. 11-ranked player in
the nation. The seventh-ranked O'Brien
is playing in place of Stark, since the top
collegiate player is still attempting to heal
a stress fracture in his right foot, sus
tained last May.
The rest of the rotation is as follows:
• Palmer, ranked No. 12, will be slotted
in at No. 2 singles and will pair up with
Stark at No. 1 doubles.
• Solomon, the veteran with three
NCAA team crowns under his belt, is set
to play at No. 3 singles.
• Cocotus, the precocious rookie,
makes his NCAA debut at No. 4 singles.

'It'll be tough. There are a lot of good teams out
there every year. We've had opportunities three
years in a row. You never know what will hap
pen.'
—Jason Yee

• Yee, another veteran with three
titles, will play No. 5 singles in addition to
No. 2 doubles with O'Brien.
• And finally, Patel, the frosh from the
bluegrass state, will experience NCAA
competition for the first time at No. 6 sin
gles.
And so begins the new year for the
men's tennis team in search of a fourth
consecutive NCAA crown.
As Solomon says, "On paper we've got

a core of guys to get the championship."
Yet, at the same time, Yee says, "It'll be
tough. There are a lot of good teams out
there every year. We've had opportunities
three years in a row. You never know
what will happen."
What one does know is that it will be
"an opportunity to partake in a great
sports event,"in the words of Coach Dick
Gould, the man with the "Goulden"
touch.
