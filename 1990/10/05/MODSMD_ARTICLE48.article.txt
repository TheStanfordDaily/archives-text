# Dynasty architect DeBartolo tries hand at Greeks

### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
He owns the 49ers and hired
Bill Walsh to take over the then
maligned team way back in 1978.
He helped build the "Team of the
Eighties" into four-time Super
Bowl Champions. But this week's
Guest Greek, Eddie Deßartolo Jr.,
has never prognosticated football
scores. Welcome to the club,
Eddie.
Despite the Bill Walsh connec
tion, Deßartolo went for his alma
mater, 34-28, in the Cardinal's
upcoming contest. That's okay,

after last weekend's debacle.
But Deßartolo does claim loyal
ty to Stanford, anyway.
"Stanford's my adopted school
— I have a house right off cam
pus," Deßartolo said. "I think it's
going to be close — Stanford
played a great game last year —
but I still have go with Notre
Dame."
Most Daily sports gods are
sticking by their school — despite
the fact that the Cardinal is a 15-
point underdog. What do the
bookies know anyway?
