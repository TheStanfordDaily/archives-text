After an impressive third-place finish last year at
the NCAA Men's Swimming Championships at the
Indiana University Natatorium, the Stanford Men's
Swimming Team will open the 1990-1991 season
today against Notre Dame at South Bend, Indiana.
When asked about his expectations for the meet,
junior Andy Lloyd remarked, "This
â€” - .auy indicate where we need to concen
trate our training.'' A six-time high school Ail-
American in the 200-meter IM, 100-meter freestyle,
and 200-meter medly relay, Lloyd was extremely
enthusiastic about the meet.
Lloyd's teammate and fellow backstroker Jeff
Rouse added, "We're going to have as much fun as
possible and build team unity." Last year as a sopho
more, Rouse was the NCAA Men's Swimming
Champion in the 100-meter backstroke, breaking
assistant coach Jay Mortensen's school record with
a phenomenal time of 47.5 seconds. As a freshman,
Rouse won the NCAA Championship in the 200-

meter backstroke.
Stanford's head coach Skip Kenney was very opti
mistic about the team's chances of winning the
1990-1991 NCAA championship. Kenney remarked
during a practice, "I'm really excited about the team.
We've got a smaller squad size and a lot of talent."
Rouse added, "Our chances [of winning the
NCAA title] are better this year than in the past 2
years, since we've got a smaller team and some great
freshmen." Last season, Stanford had a record 18
swimmers compete in the NCAA championship.
According to Kenney, who coached Stanford to
three consecutive NCAA championships in the
1980s and nine straight PAC-10 titles, a smaller
squad size greatly improves the team by allowing
more room for training in the pool while producing a
closer-knit team.
Kenney also noted, "The whole key to the team is
their attitude towards winning and their work ethic.
If we keep a good attitude through the season, we'll
be in great shape."
