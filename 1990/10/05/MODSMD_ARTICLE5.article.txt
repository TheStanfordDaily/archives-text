# NOW trying to attract different types of women
## 
### 
The following are selected por
tions of an interview between
Molly Yard, president of the Na
tional Organization for Women,
and Daily staff writer Minal
Hqjratwala.
How do you see your role as
NOW president, both in the
organization and in American
feminism more generally ?
As the president of the largest
women's organization in the
country, I'm obviously a leader.
And NOW in many ways is the
trailblazer for the women's
rights movement.
We led the big demonstrations
in Washington, D.C., last year.
We were the first women's group

to speak out against [Supreme
Court nominee David] Souter —
eventually the others followed.
I think we speak for U.S. fem
inists. Right-wing women often
say, "But you don't speak for
me." My response to that is, "I
never claimed to."
In the past NOW has been criti
cized for being insensitive to the
needs of women of color, lesbians
and other marginalized groups.
What steps are you taking to
address that?
NOW has always been open to
everyone, and we have worked to
make them feel welcome. We
have an affirmative action pro
gram at the state and local level,

and our national board is 30 per
cent women of color. So, gradu
ally women of color are moving
into leadership positions at
N0W....
NOW started out as white
suburban women who did the
work on their kitchen tables.
That's no longer true.
But most black and Hispanic
women tend to be in the work
place and running a household
at the same time, and often they
have a few kids they are respon
sible for. When thev do have
additional time, they often
belong to their own ethnic
groups, or are very active in
churches...
This year we have two men as
state presidents, and a very
dynamic woman of color as a state
president in Maryland. Of course,
we need to keep working to have
people with diverse backgrounds.
Last year NOW announced it
would consider forming a third
political party. When is the soon

est that could happen ?
We are not committed to any
thing right now except to figure
out how we can have a more rep
resentative government. There
are terrible hurdles for women,
minorities and young people to
overcome if they want to be a part
of public policy. We are almost
invisible in Congress and state
legislatures.
There are more and more
women running, and we have had
some success, but it is very slow..
. . We are trying to find out how
you open up the process.

When you were a student at
Swarthmore, you developed a
relationship with Eleanor Roo
sevelt. What effect did she have on
your political outlook ?
I was part of the American Stu
dent Union, and we were very
critical of the New Deal, because
nothing much was being done for
young people who were looking
for jobs.
She called us and said, "I want
to come out and find out what
your problems are, and what solu
tions you have in mind." She was
an incredible person because she

was willing to listen to anybody.
She had a fascinating political
history, had been aware that
women were relegated to minor
roles and worked to change the
Democratic party. Because of her,
a lot of us became much more
interested in the political process
and wanted to become involved.
I find the contrast very inter
esting — when NOW was critical
of the political parties, all we got
were some damning phrases. Not
one of them said, "We'd really like
to know how to improve condi
tions."
