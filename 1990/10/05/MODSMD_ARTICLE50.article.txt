# Shenkel leads Card into invite.

Some great athletes selected their particular
sport for fame. Others for fortune. Still others
for the simple thrill of victory.
Cross-country runner Jill Shenkel got into it
for the t-shirts.
"I started running road races in fifth grade so
I could get the free shirts that they gave out," the
sophomore said. "Other than that, I didn't run
until high school, and even there, not really seri
ously until my junior year."
Wait a minute. It's supposed to take years and
years of pounding the pavement and small coun
try roads with your Nike Airs before you get any
good, isn't it?
Apparently not for Shenkel, who helped her
high school team win the state championship her
sophomore year despite not having become a
"serious" runner yet. During her senior year she
became the No. 1 runner on her team and paced
it to another state title.
Her transition from the high school level to
running at Stanford has left coaches glowing.
"She showed a lot more maturity last year than is
usually found in freshmen," said Scott Chisam,
who coached Shenkel last year. "Most runners do
not establish personal bests during their fresh
man years, but Jill managed to do it. She ran
extremely well for us."
That's an understatement. It took her a scant
18 minutes and 24 seconds to negotiate 5000
meters (over 3.1 miles) full of hills, rocks, roots,
and dirt (hence the term "cross-country"). If we
tried, maybe some of us could drive that fast.
"Last year, we had hoped that Jill would come
in and simply help the team, which she did,"
Chisam went on. "Now, all of a sudden, we lost
some people to graduation and now she and Ash
ley Black, two sophomores, are the leaders of this

team. She has responded extremely well, and we'
have high hopes for her." I
There is no reason to think that she will not
live up to Chisam's expectations. A big test will
come this weekend when Shenkel, Black, and
senior Melanie Bloch will lead the women's team
in Saturday's Stanford/Holiday Invitational, fea
turing many of the finest collegiate runners in the
country. It will be held at the Stanford Golf
Course, with the women running at 5:00 pm and
the men at 5:50.
Shenkel and Black will be counted on to pro
vide leadership at this meet and in races to come
for several years, as the team is extremely young
(nine of its 13 members are freshmen). However,
Shenkel believes that the team has the ability to
perform well already. * 112
"It's just a question of the freshmen realizing â€¢*
what they're capable of," she said. "I think we can
do really well." Using the basic strategy of "start
out hard and don't slow down," the squad hopes
to improve on its sixth-place Pacific-10 Confer
ence finish of a year ago.
Shenkel believes that Brooks Johnson, the ;
director of track and field, and also the women's"
cross-country coach, could be an important factor
in Stanford's rise to prominence in the future.
"Brooks really knows how to get the best out of ;,
people," she said. "He likes taking people with
raw talent and helping them reach their poten- ;
tial."
Potential is one of many things that Shenkel is J
not lacking. "Jill has been following a pattern of;
success at Stanford that has existed over the past
10 years," Chisam said. "She came in hungry and *
willing to learn, and it's all paying off nicely." -
Chisam went on to list a few of her many achieve-
ments in both cross-country and track.
"It's not really that impressive," Shenkel said
of her personal best. "In college, [18:24] is really r
not very fast." **
