# Steyer speaks out on youth

Jim Steyer, a lecturer in education and an advo
cate for America's children, delivered a speech last
night that touched on a wide range of topics that
threaten youth today.
Steyer said one out of every four children under
the age of six in America lives below the poverty line.
As defined by the government, a poor family has
three members who together earn less than $10,560
per year. A family of this income could only spend
$2.75 on food for each child per day, Steyer stated.
"Kids are the most important asset to the coun
try's future," Steyer said. But he added that the gov
ernment's current policy on children is out of line
with the issue's importance.
For example, children from poor families are not
getting adequate health care, Steyer said. About 50
children die each year of measles, and the infant
mortality rate in Oakland is higher than many third
world countries, he said.
Steyer said the United States is fighting the
wrong end of a battle to try to eliminate childrens*
problems. He cited that college loans have been cut
and that money is going to things like prisons and a
"war on drugs."
Steyer also cited problems with Social Security,
which he said will hurt the country's youth. For

Social Security to remain stable, the United States
needs more efficient workers. Workers will be more
inefficient however, due to lack of support as chil
dren, Steyer reasoned.
Turning his attention to schools, Steyer lamented
the national dropout rate, which is one out of four
students, while in California that rate is one out of
three. More than 50 percent of these dropouts never
return to school.
The reason children are not being cared for is eas
ily explained, according to Steyer — children cannot
vote. Senior citizens have gained a dramatic increase
in their standard of living largely because of an
upsurge in their voting patterns. Children are not
afforded that same luxury; they need advocates in
order to thrive, Steyer stated.
"If a society provides basic health care and shel
ter, kids will do well," Steyer asserted.
The average person has no idea of the magnitude
of childrens' problems, Steyer contended. "Much of
what the average American learns is shaped
through the media and especially TV"
The Reagan administration promoted a quick fix
mentality based on quarterly profits. This approach
has left the country with a savings and loan crisis,
the highest deficit in history and the negligence of
children's issues, Steyer stated.
