## Festival reflects Native American culture 
### Cynthia Benton 
Kicking off a nine-day celebra
tion of its 20th anniversary, the
Stanford American Indian Orga
nization tonight begins a series of
shows and presentations designed
to involve both the Indian and the
non-Indian communities on cam
pus.
SAIO co-chair Angelique Jack
son, a member of the Sisseton-
Wahpeton Dakota tribe, said she
hopes people will "leave with a
lasting impression that we are a
viable culture."
SAIO Asst. Dean Jim Lari
more, a member of the Comanche
tribe, said many students have
been actively involved in planning
activities such as those being held
this week.
The festivities will open today at 5
p.m. with a showing of the Horace
Poolaw Photographic Exhibit,
"War Bonnets, Tin Lizzies and
Patent Leather Pumps: Kiowa
Culture in Transition, 1925-
1955" in Meyer Library.
"The exhibit was chosen as a
lead-in because it is a collection of
photos that mark a period of high
transition in tribal culture," Lari
more said.
He said most of the pictures at
the exhibit arrived at Stanford
last year in the form of negatives,
and students were involved in
developing and researching the
pictures. Poolaw's daughter,
Linda, directed the project and is
scheduled to speak at the event.
Tomorrow, there will be a com
munity barbecue at the Native
American Cultural Center at 11
a.m. hosted by the American
Indian Staff Forum at Stanford.
The event is open to the public.
Festivities will continue Sun
day in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at
3 p.m. with a performance by the
American Indian Dance theater,
currently on a west coast tour.
Denni Woodward, the SAIO
Celebration program coordinator,
said they will "perform a variety
of dances and talk about what var
ious parts of their costumes and

dances mean."
Jack Norton, professor of
American Indian Studies at Hum
boldt State University and author
of the book "Genocide in North
ern California," will speak Mon
day in Cubberley Auditorium.
Nylete Balgrade, a Turtle
Mountain Chippewa tribe mem
ber and co-chair of SAIO, said his
talk, "A Day of Remembrance:
The Impact of the Columbus
Legacy on the Indians of North
west California," will address "the
irony of crediting Columbus with
discovering a land that was
already inhabited."
Tuesday at 5 p.m. there will be
an art exhibit at Tresidder Union,
part of a collection belonging to
the Institute of American Indian
Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
The exhibit, which includes
both traditional and contempo
rary art, is titled, "American
Indian Art in Transition," and
Rick Hill of the Tuscarora tribe
who is the lAIA museum director
will speak and attend a reception
that follows.
Woodward said that people who
attend the display expecting to see
"a stereotype of one type or
another will be stunned by the
variety." The exhibit will be on
display at Tresidder from Oct. 1 to
14.
William G. Demmert, Jr., co
chair of the U.S. Department of
Education's Indian Nations at
Risk Task Force, will talk on
"Indian Nations at Risk? Contem
porary Issues Facing American
Indians and Alaska Natives" on
Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Cubberley.
Demmert, currently a visiting
professor at the School of Educa
tion, will discuss the govern
ment's violation of treaties with
Indian nations.
On Thursday, an award-winning
motion picture about Indians in
government boarding schools,
"Where the Spirit Lives," will be
shown in Cubberley Auditorium
at 7 p.m.
