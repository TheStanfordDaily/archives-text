# Centennial Celebration shifts into academic stage
## 
### Andrea Hungerford 
The University will host a symposium
this weekend titled "The Information
Explosion" to emphasize Stanford's aca
demic excellence during the second stage
of its year-long Centennial Celebration.
"An academic component is essential
to the Centennial Celebration," according
to Susan Wolfe, assistant director of the
Centennial Committee. "Even though the
confetti and celebrations are nice, we feel
that we should concentrate on what we do
best."
A 13-member committee, headed by
University President Emeritus Richard
Lyman, determined the subjects for this
weekend symposium.
The topics were chosen to highlight
"issues confronting the world as Stanford

enters it second century," Wolfe said.
The committee then presented a list of
topics to University President Donald
Kennedy, who chose faculty members to
head each symposium.
Panel chairs were responsible for
recruiting faculty members from Stan
ford and other colleges who are consid
ered experts in their fields, as well as
notable professionals, to appear as pan
elists.
Kennedy will open the program, fol
lowed by a keynote address by former
Secretary of State George Schultz.
The symposium's first panel, "The
New Information Technology: Changing
The Way We View The News," includes
five professional journalists and scholars,
moderated by Communication Prof.
James Risser.

"The thesis of this panel is that
changes in information technology are
causing major changes in the news busi
ness. . .and in the ways news is gathered
and distributed," Risser said.
Friday's second panel, moderated by
Political Science Prof. Stephen Krasner,
will begin at 4:15 p.m.
Four speakers, including Bruce S.
Gelb, director of the U.S. Information
Agency, will address "Global Information:
A Powerful Influence On Political
Events?"
Saturday's program commences with
keynote speaker Sandra Kurtzig, Presi
dent and CEO of ASK Computer Sys
tems, Inc.
The first panel, chaired by Philosophy
Prof. Patrick Suppes, will then discuss
"The Creative Process: New Tools, New

Ideas." Four panelists, including music
professors and a vocalist, will answer
questions and present multimedia
demonstrations.
Later that afternoon, Economics Prof.
Kenneth Arrow will moderate the panel,
"Markets, Trade And The Economy: How
Soon Do We Want To Know?" The discus
sion will feature professors from Stan
ford, Harvard and Yale.
According to Arrow, "There's been a
fair amount of discussion on the dispute
that if improved communication provides
speeded up responses, this may cause
instability [in economic markets]."
Sunday morning, the symposium con
tinues with "In The Information Age:
Crossing New Frontiers In Science And
Medicine." Joel Shurkin, a science writer
for the Stanford News Service, will mod

erate a panel consisting of three profes
sors and scientists.
The autumn program will conclude at
11:30 a.m. with a closing speech by
Arrow. He plans to base his speech on "a
broad reflection on the prospects for bet
ter information, the biases that may be
introduced in that speeded-up informa
tion process.. .and generally, whether the
gathering of more information will be
helpful or inimical to productivity in sci
ence, art and so forth."
All panels will be held in Memorial
Auditorium and all students, faculty and
community members are welcome to
attend.
Each symposium will feature opening
statements by the panelists, moderator
directed discussion and a question-and
answer session with the audience.
