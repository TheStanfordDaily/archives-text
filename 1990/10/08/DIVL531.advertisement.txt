GET YOUR CHANGE OF
ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER
FORMS IN BY TOMORROW,
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 9 IF YOU
WANT TO BE LISTED IN THIS
YEAR'S DIRECTORY.
IF YOU DO NOT GET THESE FORMS IN, YOU
WILL HAVE NO PHONE NUMBER LISTED
* SIGNING UP FOR PHONE SERVICE DID NOT, I REPEAT, NOT
ASSURE YOUR INCLUSION.
YOU SEE, THE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES DEPT. CANNOT TELL US THE
PHONE NUMBERS, ONLY THE REGISTRAR CAN,
DUE TO THE PRIVACY ACT, SO PLEASE GET IT IN ASAP.
THERE WILL BE REPRESENTATIVES
IN WHITE PLAZA
TODAY & TOMORROW
FROM 11:00 am - 1:00 pm
with blank forms to fill out there,
or you can turn it in at the registrar's office
anytime up to s:oopm tomorrow.
