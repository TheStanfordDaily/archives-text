# Luck runs out on the Irish

"We're going to do it. It's got to
happen sometime."
— cornerback Kevin Scott
Four times this season,
unranked and underrated Stan
ford promised an upset victory.
Against Colorado, UCLA and
San Jose State, the squad was
left wondering why it couldn't
execute when it really counted.
And why the other guys could.

Football

Cardinal 36

Fighting Irish 31

This time, the predictions
came true.
In what may have been the
upset victory of Stanford football
history, the Cardinal held off
undefeated and No. 1-ranked
Notre Dame for its first road vic
tory in four seasons. And for the
Fighting Irish's first home loss
in five. It was only the third time
the Irish have ever lost at home
while ranked No. 1 and the first
time since 1954.
"This was a great win for us,"
coach Denny Green said. "Notre
Dame is amost invincible at
home. Personally, this compares
to winning the Super Bowl in
1989.... If it isn't the biggest
win for Stanford it definitely
rivals upsetting Oklahoma in
1980."
"This was a huge win for the
program," added fifth-year
senior Chuck Gillingham. "The
main thing is we got one on the
road. The last time we did that
was my redshirt freshman year
at Oregon State, and this is a
whole lot bigger than OSU.
"All of a sudden we're back in
it."
Few believed it was possible.
Notre Dame had not been
defeated at South Bend since
1986. They were 3-0. They were
17-point favorites. They were
the Irish.
But the Cardinal, after almost
pulling off upset wins of the Buf
faloes and Bruins, knew it could
beat the Fighting Irish on hostile
turf.
In fact, Green even thought
playing in Indiana contributed
to the Cardinal's motivation.
"I got off the plane and
smelled football," he said.
"Everything about the Midwest
is football.
"It was great. The sirens of
the police escort were blaring on
the way to the game and all I
could think was 'Move over, here
comes the goddam Stanford Car
dinal."
Whatever Green felt, it was a
victory that almost wasn't.
While the Irish always pull off
miracle wins, it seems like Stan
ford is always the victim.
The roles were reversed this
time.
And the Cardinal played the

part quite nicely, thank you.
For the third time this year
Stanford scored in the waning
minutes to take the lead. And for
the third time Stanford's oppo
nent immediately took charge,
quickly marching down the field
towards a last-second victory.
The situation was eerily
familiar. Although Saturday the
Cardinal scored with only 36 sec
onds remaining, on fullback
Tommy Vardell's fourth one
yard touchdown leap of the
game, Notre Dame still came
back.
Down 36-31 with 31 seconds
to play, the Fighting Irish

quickly moved into Stanford ter
ritory the same way every other
rallying opponent has: by throw
ing the ball. Quarterback Rick
Mirer immediately tossed a 26-
yard bomb to Shawn Davis.
First-and-10. Stanford 44.
"The defense was in a hell of a
situation," Gillingham said.
"The crowd started going 'here
we go again. We're going to
punch it in again,' but we knew
that they had to take it all the
way for a touchdown."
The Irish, with two last-sec
ond wins this year, almost did.
Notre Dame, and the Cardi
nal defense, look to Mirer. The

sophomore, under heavy pres
sure, throws imcomplete.
Second down: Mirer drills a
21-yarder up the middle to Tony
Brooks.
First-and-10. Stanford 23.
Thirteen seconds.
"When they started moving I
knew it couldn't happen again,"
center Chris Dalman said. "We
couldn't have that bad of luck.
"I started thiking no, not
again and I prayed more than I
ever have."
Mirer throws incomplete out
of the endzone. Six seconds. One

Ron Redell and the rest of the Cardinal celebrate the team's monumental victory at top-ranked
Notre Dame. Stanford's 36-31 win was the team's first on the road since the 1987 season and
the Fighting Irish's first home loss since 1986.
play remains.
Mirer lofts a spiral to right to
tight end Derek Brown in the left
edge of the endzone...
Colorado all over again?
... but the ball brushes over
his hands and plops to the ground.
"I thought it was a touch
down," Scott said. "I loked up at
the scoreboard, but as I looked
down I saw the ref. wave incom
plete.
"I was in awe. My mind
stopped for a moment, then it hit
me that we had just beat them."
It hit the rest of the team about
the same time. Pandemonium
broke out on the Stanford side
line. Sixty-seven estatic players
jumping up and down, screaming,
hugging and kissing — in front of
the quietest sellout crowd Notre
Dame stadium had ever seen.
"We had pressure on the quar
terback and he threw before he
was ready. The tight end looked
over the wrong shoulder. If he
could have got set it might have
been a different story," said defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw.
"We'd been talking about it for
three weeks."
The victory was even more
amazing considering most
thought Stanford was out of it by
halfway through the second quar
ter.
With-six-and-a-half minutes
remaining in the first half, Stan
ford was down 24-7 and was not
playing good ball. It did not get a
first down until its fifth series. A
fumbled snap and blocked punt
resulted in two Notre Dame
scores. Stanford couldn't keep the
Irish's potent offense off the field.
"We came out flat and we just
couldn't get on track," Gillingham
said. "But they had the ball so
long (11:32 during the first quar
ter) that we couldn't get any
momentum. But we knew if we
didn't get down too bad we could
still be in it."
Twenty-four to seven was not
too deep of a hole.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
immediately directed the Cardinal
80 yards the next drive. Vardell
over the top for a touchdown.
Green's little chart told him to go
for a two-point conversion. So he
did.
The Palumbis to Ed McCaffrey
toss in the right edge of the end
zone was Stanford's first success
ful two-pointer of the season.
Stanford actually had another
chance to bridge the nine-point
gap when it got the ball back with
50 seconds remaining in the half.
Green chose to run time out, how
ever, a move that many ques
tioned but that didn't hurt the
squad in the end.
The team that faced off against
Notre Dame the second half was
not the same Cardinal.
"We didn't change anything
mechanically. We just got our
selves together," linebacker Ron
George said. "During halftime we
talked about what was on the
inside and we really wanted to
change Stanford, to make this a
winning program."
The pep talk must have
worked. The football team that
the squad had said existed, but
hadn't previously performed,
came to life.
The Notre Dame aura was
defeated.
"In the first half I think we
were a little intimidated. Every
body was still thinking about the
tradition and Notre Dame,
instead thinking about what we
should be doing," Scott said.
"Once we got that out of our sys
tem the second half we were fine."
Palumbis, playing probably the
best game of his career, directed
the Cardinal on three scoring
drives in the final two periods. He

finished the day 26-of-34 for 256
yards. Wide recievers McCaffrey
and Jon Pinckney and tight end
Cory Booker came down with
numerous key catches, especially
on third down.
"Going into the second half we
had a couple of nice plays. We real
ized: what are we afraid of?
What's holding us back? We can
beat these guys," Palumbis said.
Stanford's young defense con
curred, stopping the Irish when it
counted.
Two fourth down plays sealed
the Fighting Irish's fate.
Three-and-a-half minutes into
the third quarter Mirer tried a
quarterback sneak on fourth-and
one.
Seyon Albert crunched the
sophomore for no gain.
On fourth-and-two on the
Notre Dame 38 with 3:27 remain
ing, Palumbis dropped back to
pass. No one was open. Quarter
back keeper up the middle. First
down. Touchdown three minutes
later. Good-bye No. 1 ranking!
"We just had to believe it was
going to happen," Palumbis said.
"I'm really not a runner but I just
cut up and got enough for the first
down."
It wasn't the only time Satur
day that luck was, for once, on the
Cardinal's side.
It seemed like Touchdown
Jesus was looking out for Stan
ford. The religious mosaic on the
library facing the football field is
said to bring luck and victory to
Notre Dame. Saturday, he must
have pulling for the Cardinal.
Notre Dame muffed three punt
returns, and each time a player in
red and white fell on the ball. Two
of the three turnovers resulted in
Cardinal touchdowns. All-Ameri
can receiver/returner Raghib
"Rocket" Ismail only played one
play due to a pulled thigh muscle.
All-America nose guard Chris
Zorich was called for a personal

foul, giving Stanford a first down
on third-and-tive. Coach Lou
Holtz took him out for the rest of
the drive. Stanford ended up with
an eight-point play.
"The muffed punts helped
tremendously. I don't think we
could have scored 36 points mov
ing the ball down field against
Notre Dame," Green said.
While Stanford did get the ball
moving when it needed to, the
Cardinal defense still had prob
lems defending against the pass,
as well as stopping the run, its
usual strength. The running
intensive Irish gained 198 yards
on the ground, 104 by fullback
Rodney Culver, in addition to 235
yards passing.
But when playing the best why
not compete on their terms?
Notre Dame often engages in
high-scoring duels. Stanford just
followed along, and outsmarted
the master at its own game, gain
ing 343 yards to go along with its
36 points.
And the defense did follow
Shaw's halftime premonition,
allowing only one touchdown dur
ing the second half.
If the victory didn't erase the
bitter memory of two last-second
defeats, at least it took away some
of the sting.
"This win eases the pain of the
two late losses, and of 10,000
other things. This is not only
beating the No. 1 team but beat
ing Notre Dame as a No. 1 team at
Notre Dame," said Shaw.
"This kind of victory makes
your season," said newly-labeled
"Touchdown Tommy" Vardell.
"The good thing is we know that
we can beat that type of team.
Now we have the confidence."
Card notes
Vardell's four touchdowns, one
short of Darrin Nelson's school record
of five, gives him 11 for the season. He
was selected by KZSU personalities

Brian Webber and Mark McLaughlin
as the Compadreß' Player of the
Game.
McCaffrey's six receptions for 111
yards, including a 43-yarder, most
likely will keep him at tho forefront
ofe both the Pac-10 and the NCAA sta
tistical rankings.
Linebacker Dave Garnett had a
team-high 12 tackles, four for losses,
in addition to a nine-yard sack of
Mirer on third down. Jimmy Klein
recorded nine tackles.
Defensive back Albert Richardson
got into a fight a with Notre Dame
marching band tuba, and lost.
Richardon required three stitches to
his right arm. Fullback Ellery Roberts
sprained his ankle and made the trip
home on crutches.
About 100 family members were
among the 5,000-strong Stanford
rooting section. The Stanford swim
and tennis teams were also present as
they had participated, and won, in
exhibition matches against the Irish
Friday as part of the all-sports week
end.
The Cardinal would like to thank
America West Airlines for making two
very long flights even longer. One
hour out of San Francisco the pilot
announced we were headed to
Phoenix, Ariz., not quite on the way to
South Bend, to change planes because
the landing gear wouldn't retract.
Two extra hours. The plane had
hardly taken off from South Bend
when the return pilot anounced that
we had to make a "short" stopover in
Des Moines, lowa, for gas. An hour
and a half of extra transportation
time. Didn't the airline realize the
team was headed for San Francisco
before it boarded?
Maybe Cardinal so-called fans
could pick up a few tips from Notre
Dame boosters. Spectators in South
Bend come to watch the game. They
cheer for receptions, long rushing
pickups, and third downs. The Irish
know that 69,000 people actually care
what is happening on the field.
