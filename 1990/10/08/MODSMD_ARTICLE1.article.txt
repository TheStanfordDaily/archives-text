# Luck runs out on the Irish

happen sometime."

Four times this season,
unranked and underrated Stan
ford promised an upset victory.
Against Colorado, UCLA and
San Jose State, the squad was
left wondering why it couldn't
execute when it really counted.
And why the other guys could.

Cardinal 36

Fighting Irish 31

This time, the predictions
came true.
In what may have been the
upset victory of Stanford football
history, the Cardinal held off
undefeated and No. 1-ranked
Notre Dame for its first road vic
tory in four seasons. And for the
Fighting Irish's first home loss
in five. It was only the third time
the Irish have ever lost at home
while ranked No. 1 and the first
time since 1954.
"This was a great win for us,"
coach Denny Green said. "Notre
Dame is amost invincible at
home. Personally, this compares
to winning the Super Bowl in
1989.... If it isn't the biggest
win for Stanford it definitely
rivals upsetting Oklahoma in
1980."
"This was a huge win for the
program," added fifth-year
senior Chuck Gillingham. "The
main thing is we got one on the
road. The last time we did that
was my redshirt freshman year
at Oregon State, and this is a
whole lot bigger than OSU.
"All of a sudden we're back in
it."
Few believed it was possible.
Notre Dame had not been
defeated at South Bend since
1986. They were 3-0. They were
17-point favorites. They were
the Irish.
But the Cardinal, after almost
pulling off upset wins of the Buf
faloes and Bruins, knew it could
beat the Fighting Irish on hostile
turf.
In fact, Green even thought
playing in Indiana contributed
to the Cardinal's motivation.
"I got off the plane and
smelled football," he said.
"Everything about the Midwest
is football.
"It was great. The sirens of
the police escort were blaring on
the way to the game and all I
could think was 'Move over, here
comes the goddam Stanford Car
dinal."
Whatever Green felt, it was a
victory that almost wasn't.
While the Irish always pull off
miracle wins, it seems like Stan
ford is always the victim.
The roles were reversed this
time.
And the Cardinal played the

part quite nicely, thank you.
For the third time this year
Stanford scored in the waning
minutes to take the lead. And for
the third time Stanford's oppo
nent immediately took charge,
quickly marching down the field
towards a last-second victory.
The situation was eerily
familiar. Although Saturday the
Cardinal scored with only 36 sec
onds remaining, on fullback
Tommy Vardell's fourth one
yard touchdown leap of the
game, Notre Dame still came
back.
Down 36-31 with 31 seconds
to play, the Fighting Irish

quickly moved into Stanford ter
ritory the same way every other
rallying opponent has: by throw
ing the ball. Quarterback Rick
Mirer immediately tossed a 26-
yard bomb to Shawn Davis.
First-and-10. Stanford 44.
"The defense was in a hell of a
situation," Gillingham said.
"The crowd started going 'here
we go again. We're going to
punch it in again,' but we knew
that they had to take it all the
way for a touchdown."
The Irish, with two last-sec
ond wins this year, almost did.
Notre Dame, and the Cardi
nal defense, look to Mirer. The

sophomore, under heavy pres
sure, throws imcomplete.
Second down: Mirer drills a
21-yarder up the middle to Tony
Brooks.
First-and-10. Stanford 23.
Thirteen seconds.
"When they started moving I
knew it couldn't happen again,"
center Chris Dalman said. "We
couldn't have that bad of luck.
"I started thiking no, not
again and I prayed more than I
ever have."
Mirer throws incomplete out
of the endzone. Six seconds. One

Ron Redell and the rest of the Cardinal celebrate the team's monumental victory at top-ranked
Notre Dame. Stanford's 36-31 win was the team's first on the road since the 1987 season and
the Fighting Irish's first home loss since 1986.
