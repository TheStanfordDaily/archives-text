Fire aboard shuttle
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -
Discovery's astronauts, their primary
job behind them, started a small fire
aboard the shuttle yesterday as part of
an experiment to study the spread of
flames in space.
The solar probe Ulysses, meanwhile,
sped safely toward Jupiter at a record
setting 34,130 mph. Discovery's five
man crew started the satellite on its
roundabout journey of 1.86 billion miles
shortly after liftoff Saturday.
The carefully controlled fire, the first
test fire aboard a shuttle, burned about
70 seconds within a sealed aluminum
container, as cameras recorded the event
so that it could be studied later.
Saturday's launch marked the end of
months of frustration for the NASA,
which has suffered through problems
with its shuttle fleet and the flawed
Hubble Space Telescope.
New volcanoes found
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - A 10-mile
string of about 10 new volcanoes has
been discovered on the ocean floor about
300 miles off the Oregon Coast.

The volcanoes, some more than 100
feet high and a half-mile wide, were
spotted by scientists studying maps and
photographs of the sea floor along the
Juan de Fuca Ridge, which runs north
and south off the Washington and Ore
gon coasts.
They were formed within the past
decade, said Robert Embley, a marine
geologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Pacific
Marine Environmental Laboratory in
Newport.
Israelis get gas masks
YOQNEAM, Israel (AP) - Israelis
began trickling to schools yesterday to
pick up their gas masks in response to
an army decision to protect the public
against an Iraqi chemical attack.
Classrooms, festooned with the hand
iwork of junior school pupils, were
turned into instruction centers where
soldiers showed civilians how to put on
gas masks and inject themselves with
antidotes to poison.
"It's colorful and pretty so the child
should not get afraid," said a female
instructor, holding up a red-and-yellow
gas mask for infants.
