# Terry Waite may finally be freed

### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — A newspa
per reported yesterday that an Iranian
envoy has arrived in Beirut to prepare
for the release of Anglican Church
envoy Terry Waite "in the next few
days."
The report came amid mounting
speculation that one or more of the four
Britons missing in Lebanon could be
freed soon. Iran and Britain restored
diplomatic relations on Sept. 27.
On Saturday, Lebanon's leading
newspaper, the independent an-Nahar
daily, said that Waite and "a number of
foreign hostages" were expected to be
released this week.
Arab sources in Damascus, Syria's
capital, said yesterday that the Syrians
are making strenuous efforts to free
some of the 13 Westerners missing in
Lebanon. Most are believed held by pro-
Iranian Shiite Moslem militants.
One source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Sharaa is trying hard "to resolve
the issue but has been encountering
unexpected obstacles."
He did not elaborate, but noted that
Sharaa is expected to meet soon with
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati to discuss the issue. They met
last week at the United Nations in New

York.
Speculation also
has been fueled by
expectations that
Britain and Syria will
soon restore rela
tions. The two coun
tries broke off ties in
October 1986 after
Syrian intelligence
was implicated in a
plot to bomb an
Israeli airliner at
London's Heathrow
airport.
Ad-Diyar said the
unidentified Iranian
official flew into
Beirut Saturday car
rying an Algerian
passport.

"Secret talks have been held in the
last two months and resulted in agree
ment on the release operation as well as
the final touches and details," the
report said.
In London, the British Foreign Office
said there was nothing to the report and
reiterated British policy that it will not
negotiate to get hostages out.
Britain and Iran restored diplomatic
relations after a 19-month break trig-

gered by the publica
tion of British auth
or Salman Rushdie's
novel, "The Satanic
Verses." Many Mos
lems say the book
blasphemes Islam.
Ad-Diyar said
Waite's release was
expected to be "the
preface to releasing
all British hostages
in Lebanon." The
other missing Brit
ons are journalist
John McCarthy, re
tired pilot Jack
Mann and writer
Alec Collett.
It said the agree-

ment to release Waite involved a $10
million "fee to the forces" who kid
napped him.
Waite, 51, disappeared Jan. 20,
1987, after leaving his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut for a meeting
with representatives of Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War. The pro-
Iranian Shiite Moslem faction is
believed to hold American hostages
Terry Anderson and Thomas Suther
land.
