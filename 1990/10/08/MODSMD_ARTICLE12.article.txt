# Japanese 'peace' constitution may allow for troops in Gulf
## 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — Japan's "peace" con
stitution, the focus of angry debate over
the use of force overseas, actually leaves
plenty of room for dispatching troops to
the Persian Gulf, analysts said.
In fact, they point out, the existence of
Japan's Self Defense Forces already vio
lates the constitution. The real battle
ground is political, not legal, the experts
said.
"I don't think the constitution is a real

constraint," said Seizaburo Sato, a Tokyo
University politics professor. "What's
lacking is courageous leadership on the
part of the prime minister."
The key constitutional provision,
adopted under the U.S. occupation after
World War 11, is Article 9. It states that
"the Japanese people forever renounce
war as a sovereign right of the nation and
the threat or use of force as a means of
settling international disputes."

"In order to accomplish the aim of the
preceding paragraph," it continues,
"land, sea and air forces, as well as other
war potential, will never be maintained."
In the 19505, the government decided
that the ban on land, sea and air forces
was not intended to deprive the nation of
its sovereign right to self-defense. The
Self Defense Forces were born.
Today, scholars said, the ruling conser
vative party — the Liberal Democrats —

could just as easily reinterpret Article 9 to
justify a combat role for Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu's proposed U.N. Peace
Cooperation Corps, particularly in view of
other countervailing constitutional provi
sions.
The constitution's preamble, for exam
ple, says that Japan seeks an honorable
place in international society and its
struggle against oppression.
"If we pay attention to that clause it

means we should be involved in United
Nations peacekeeping," even if that
means battle, said Masashi Nishihara, a
professor at Japan's Defense Academy.
"If we are going to work under the
U.N. flag, such a collective security action
does not constitute the threat or use of
force," he said.
Nonetheless, the government insists
the peace corps will be used only for non
combat activities, such as transportation.
