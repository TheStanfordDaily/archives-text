# Soviets protest mandatory draft
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Scores of radical activists,
grieving mothers and leather-clad youths rallied
side-by-side at the gates of the Defense Ministry yes
terday, demanding alternatives to compulsory mili
tary service.
Several hundred people watched and often
applauded as speakers from the fledgling Radical
Party, organizers of the rally, criticized the United
States and the Soviet Union for the arms buildups
that made the drafts necessary.
"There is no reason for a universal military draft.
Who is threatening us? It's our own heaping stock
pile that is threatening us," said Alexander Kalinina,
a Radical Party member and deputy on the Moscow
City Council.
"Those who don't want to serve according to their
own consciences should be allowed to serve in the
civil (sector) instead of the military,'' he told the
crowd.
The rally on Constitution Day, which marks the
adoption of the Soviet Constituion in 1977, was held
without official permission. But there were no con
frontations with the dozens of policemen posted at
each entrance to the white-marble Defense Ministry
building.
Every Soviet male of 18 or older must serve in the
military and can be called up during seasonal draft
periods, one of which is occuring this autumn.
Soviet officials admitted that thousands of youths
have been ignoring draft orders last year. Many
refuse to serve outside their home republics because,
among other issues, they fear the vicious hazing pro
cess that often is ethnically motivated.
Beatings and harassment of minorities are so
rampant that several republics refused to allow their
youths to be drafted this year. One report said
15,000 Soviet soldiers died in the last five years in
murders, suicides and training accidents.
A half-dozen women, representing an increasingly
active mothers' group that seeks more information
about their sons who died while in service, staked out
an area at the center of the rally. Each of the women
held a photo of a soldier and a hand-lettered sign
detailing his birth, place of service and date of death.
