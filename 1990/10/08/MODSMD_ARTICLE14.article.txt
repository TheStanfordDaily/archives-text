# Spending cuts take effect
## Medicare, excise tax hinder budget compromise 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Democratic
leaders predicted yesterday a new budget
agreement before the government shut
down takes full effect on Tuesday and said
the pact would ease proposed Medicare cuts
and excise tax increases.
Informal bipartisan talks continued well
into yesterday night as the House remained
on standby t<? consider any plan put before
it.
The Senate convened at 6 p.m. and
adjourned 12 minutes later after conclud
ing that it would be hours, at best, before
anything concrete would emanate from the
House.
Meanwhile, leaders of both parties
blamed each other for the shutdown that
closed federal tourist attractions and other
weekend programs nationwide.
Guards at the White House gates
directed baffled tourists to the open-air
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, suggesting it
was the only one of the dozens of govern
ment-run memorials and museums in the
nation's capital not locked up.
White House tours were suspended.
Congressional leaders, arriving for a 10
a.m. meeting with President Bush to dis
cuss the budget crisis, found most of the
White House dark.
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.,
said President Bush's Saturday veto of a
bill designed to keep the government oper
ating during negotiations was a bad mis
take that had slowed the talks.
"[Bushl sets the house on fire ... to get
our attention," Foley said.
But Vice President Dan Quayle, appear
ing on ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley" program, said Bush was not the
problem. "The problem is Congress," he
said.
Quayle predicted that 90 percent of the
budget deal Bush unsuccessfully lobbied for
last week would remain, and with modifica
tions it would pass.

"We now know what the problems were
with the old one," agreed Sen. James
Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee.
"The new budget agreement in my view
will address the problem of the overly large
Medicare cuts .. . and also the revenue part
of the package," said Sasser, also appearing
on ABC.
Technically, the budget is an internal
congressional document that does not
require the president's signature. The
actual bills raising taxes or cutting spend
ing would follow its instructions if such
instructions are included.
But while Bush does not sign the budget,
he has leverage now because the new fiscal
year began Oct. 1 without enactment of any
of the spending legislation that gives gov
ernment agencies authority to operate.
"The deadline that we're talking about
is Tuesday morning," said Foley, when gov
ernment workers are supposed to return to
work from the Columbus Day weekend.
Opposition from the Democrats to the
package seemed to concentrate on an
increase in Medicare premiums and fees, a
12-cent motor fuel boost and a two cent tax
on home heating oil.
In addition, many conservatives were
demanding a cut in the tax rate on capital
gains in exchange for their votes. The ques
tion is whether Republicans and the White
House would accept a raise in the top tax
rate for the wealthy in exchange for
Democrats going along with the capital
gains cuts.
Sununu said yesterday that the adminis
tration is still opposed to raising the top tax
rate. An increase in tax rates for the
wealthy "will be followed... by raising it in
the middle and then raising it down in the
bottom."
"[Congress] ought to draw the line on
tax rates and not raise the rates," Sununu
said.
