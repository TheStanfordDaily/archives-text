## We beat Notre Dame 
### 
And the ball is. ..
DROPPED!
With that, the Stanford
campus exploded into spontaneous
celebration. What just hours before
had seemed like the most fantastic
of dreams was now a reality.
Stanford beat Notre Dame.
Oh, sometime during the third
quarter of the game, as students
ambled up to their rooms after
enjoying a fine brunch, a radio or
two was turned on.
Just out of curiosity, what's the
score? What? Vardell just scored to
bring us within two? What? He did
it again?
Indeed, by the time Stanford
was in the midst of the soon-to-be
winning drive late in the fourth
quarter, Brian Webber's call of the
game for KZSU could be heard on
at least one radio in each wing of
every dorm and house on campus.
When the Cardinal called time
out to devise a play on fourth-and
two, shouts of "Go for it" rang out
through the air. Oh, this would be
so incredible.

When Jason Palumbis dove for
the first down marker, when Ed
McCaffrey got down to the six, and
then when Tommy Vardell did it
yet again, the screams became
deafening.
Since the 1987 season, the
Cardinal had been 0-11-1 on the
road. Since November 1986, Notre
Dame had won every home game it
played. And Notre Dame WAS the
number one team in the nation.
So, it was all too believable when
the Irish made one last effort.
Getting the most out of all of the 36
seconds left in the game, quarter
back Rick Mirer threw one last,
catchable pass. ..
Moments like Saturday's victory
are truly precious. After all, these
guys are our classmates and our
friends.
And, as anyone who was on cam
pus and didn't have his or her head
buried in a hole as that last pass
was dropped, heard, Stanford stu
dents do care about their teams.
We beat Notre Dame. We beat
Notre Dame. We beat Notre Dame.
