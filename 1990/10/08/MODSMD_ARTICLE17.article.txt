## 
### 
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE. If
you've complained that your
opinions aren't being heard
by Stanford's administration, see
to it that it is. Apply to be a student
member of a University committee.-
A voice on the Panel on Police-
Student Relations, the
Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising, the
Committee on Faculty Initiatives
on South Africa, the Panel on
Laboratory Animal Care or any of
about 35 other committees isn't
that hard to come by.
To apply for one of these posi
tions, all you need to do is turn in
four copies of your resume and a
one-page form — available at the
ASSU offices on the second floor of

Tresidder Union — to the ASSU
offices by 3 p.m. today.
In the next few weeks, you'll be
interviewed by the Nominations
Commission. That's it.
If you're selected — and the
competition for these positions is
hardly cut-throat — you will, in the
words of the ASSU, "have the
opportunity to work with faculty
and staff to make important deci
sions regarding University poli
cies."
This opportunity often includes
the right to vote as a bona fide com
mittee member.
The issues aren't trivial and the
power isn't trivial. Make your voice
heard on a University Committee
— now.
