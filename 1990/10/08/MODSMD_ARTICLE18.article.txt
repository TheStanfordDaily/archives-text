All world cultures are
dominated, influenced
by Western concepts
Heidi Durrow, you lament that "white
folks will never see me without seeing my
brownness."
And why not? You are brown. The
brownness of your skin is an integral
part of you.
Why is it that Daniel Chung feels that
it is inappropriate to label all non-whites
as colored, in a letter on the same page?
Why do you use terms such as "better
than black" and "almost white"?
Surely anyone who subscribed to the
intellectual superiority of one race over
another died out along with Hitler.
Then why are we non-whites so
touchy about being colored? Weil, if not
the mind, it sure has to do with the body.
The answer is brutal and is bound to
hurt, but the truth must be told.
It is simply the Western concept of
beauty that has permeated into the
minds of people all around the globe.
Why is the Western concept of beauty
the prevalent one now?
In my view, the answer to that lies in
history. Would things have been differ
ent if black Africa had been the domi
nant power in the 18th and 19th century
instead of white Europe?
However, facts are facts, and as long
as we are in an era dominated by the
Western world, white is beautiful and
that's that. So much so, that such atti
tudes are indeed much more hardened in
the non-Western world.
Personally, I can only draw from my
experience in India, in which the ideas of
Western beauty seem to be much more
rigidly installed than in the Western
world itself.
So, Heidi, things are not so bad.
History cannot be changed and deeply
internalized ideas cannot be changed
overnight.
To that extent, the part of the world
which is doing more than most other

parts of the glove to re-learn new ideas of
beauty and to change old prejudices is
exactly the part of the world that you are
living in. Take it from me, an alien who
is still a little wonderstruck at the toler
ance of the society around me.
The only thing that can be done to
change things, is to ensure that later
generations do not learn the same ideas
of beauty and aesthetic values that we
did.
• Changes may be slow in coming, but
one thing's for sure — you are in the cor
rect part of the world in which to make
an attempt.

Student urges others
to speak out against
new drinking policy
Stanford's new policy on alcohol is the
result of a new coercive federal policy.
The administration claims it has no
choice in its choice of making a new alco
hol policy, as Stanford will lose all feder
al funding if the administration does not
enforce the new Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act. This new policy is very
dangerous to all students who attend
this school.
As a result of this policy, underage
students choosing to drink will be com
pelled to do so behind closed doors.
This will divide dorms into social
classes of those who drink and those who
do not. Those who do choose to drink
will be fearful of their dictator RF or his
watchdogs, the RA's, looking in on their
illegal behavior.
Now, under the new policy, the stu
dent who has a drinking problem will be
afraid to go to those people, and his prob
lem will only become worse without help
from his residence staff.
What we have to look forward to now
is a new feeling of distrust between the
residential staff and the students, ran
dom room searches for empty beer cans

and any other signs of illegal consump
tion and a number of needless expul
sions.
We here at Stanford do have a choice.
Tell the administration of your distaste
for our shining new policy that sets an
example for others.
We have fallen from a great, liberal
university allowing individual freedom to
one which bows to the every whim of
President Bush and his ridiculous war on
drugs.

Stanford Bookstore
selling course readers,
aggravating students
Does the Stanford Bookstore aggra
vate the students unwillingly, or does it
try really, really hard?
Instead of allowing individual paper
companies to supply and sell course read
ers, the Bookstore has now assumed this
responsibility for some classes.
The result, however, is the complete
disappearance of convenience and ease
that accompanied buying readers in
class.
Since there were no remaining copies
of the reader at the Bookstore when I
stopped by, I was advised to "reserve" a
copy by pre-paying for it.
Though my reader is already paid for,
it will not be ready for two days. At least.
Last year, students received readers
when they needed them.
To make matters worse, the cost of
the reader — which I don't even have yet
— is double the cost of any reader that I
purchased last year (and the CIV reader
were pretty thick).
Please, Stanford Bookstore, let copy
centers produce the course readers. It's
not only more economical for students,
but more importantly, it's much more
convenient.

Yell leaders have
worked long and hard,
deserve to be praised
Why is it so difficult for people to
empathize, understand, encourage, and
most of all, support the Stanford yell
leaders?
Almost every article I have read in
this newspaper has been negative and
nonproductive. Each article has severe
criticisms and yet offers no positive rein
forcement or suggestions.
So a poll was taken — big deal. What
about those of us that say, "Hey, at least
they're trying!"
Are you such perfectionists that you
are blind to the fact that this group has
been on campus since well before fall
quarter, practicing very hard out in the
hot sun from early morning until late
afternoon?
I have witnessed this myself. When I
arrived at work, they were practicing. I
left for lunch, they were practicing. I left
for home after work, they were still prac
ticing.
These people are dedicated whether
you know it or not. I believe it takes
strong character to take the verbal and
written abuses they have endured and
still smile, dance and entertain for a
thankless crowd as they do. I applaud
them.
So they misspelled Stanford once.
Humans make mistakes sometimes.
Those people out there are human and
they have feelings.
They are really trying hard against
great odds to help their fellow Cardinal
feel proud.
Put yourself in their shoes. Think to
yourself just for a moment, "What if that
were me?" and "How would I want to be
treated?"
For goodness sakes, cheer with them
instead of against them.

empathize, understand, encourage, and
most of all, support the Stanford yell
leaders?
Almost every article I have read in
this newspaper has been negative and
nonproductive. Each article has severe
criticisms and yet offers no positive rein
forcement or suggestions.
So a poll was taken — big deal. What
about those of us that say, "Hey, at least
they're trying!"
Are you such perfectionists that you
are blind to the fact that this group has
been on campus since well before fall
quarter, practicing very hard out in the
hot sun from early morning until late
afternoon?
I have witnessed this myself. When I
arrived at work, they were practicing. I
left for lunch, they were practicing. I left
for home after work, they were still prac
ticing.
These people are dedicated whether
you know it or not. I believe it takes
strong character to take the verbal and
written abuses they have endured and
still smile, dance and entertain for a
thankless crowd as they do. I applaud
them.
So they misspelled Stanford once.
Humans make mistakes sometimes.
Those people out there are human and
they have feelings.
They are really trying hard against
great odds to help their fellow Cardinal
feel proud.
Put yourself in their shoes. Think to
yourself just for a moment, "What if that
were me?" and "How would I want to be
treated?"
For goodness sakes, cheer with them
instead of against them.

All world cultures are
dominated, influenced
by Western concepts
Heidi Durrow, you lament that "white
folks will never see me without seeing my
brownness."
And why not? You are brown. The
brownness of your skin is an integral
part of you.
Why is it that Daniel Chung feels that
it is inappropriate to label all non-whites
as colored, in a letter on the same page?
Why do you use terms such as "better
than black" and "almost white"?
Surely anyone who subscribed to the
intellectual superiority of one race over
another died out along with Hitler.
Then why are we non-whites so
touchy about being colored? Weil, if not
the mind, it sure has to do with the body.
The answer is brutal and is bound to
hurt, but the truth must be told.
It is simply the Western concept of
beauty that has permeated into the
minds of people all around the globe.
Why is the Western concept of beauty
the prevalent one now?
In my view, the answer to that lies in
history. Would things have been differ
ent if black Africa had been the domi
nant power in the 18th and 19th century
instead of white Europe?
However, facts are facts, and as long
as we are in an era dominated by the
Western world, white is beautiful and
that's that. So much so, that such atti
tudes are indeed much more hardened in
the non-Western world.
Personally, I can only draw from my
experience in India, in which the ideas of
Western beauty seem to be much more
rigidly installed than in the Western
world itself.
So, Heidi, things are not so bad.
History cannot be changed and deeply
internalized ideas cannot be changed
overnight.
To that extent, the part of the world
which is doing more than most other

parts of the glove to re-learn new ideas of
beauty and to change old prejudices is
exactly the part of the world that you are
living in. Take it from me, an alien who
is still a little wonderstruck at the toler
ance of the society around me.
The only thing that can be done to
change things, is to ensure that later
generations do not learn the same ideas
of beauty and aesthetic values that we
did.
• Changes may be slow in coming, but
one thing's for sure — you are in the cor
rect part of the world in which to make
an attempt.

to speak out against
new drinking policy
Stanford's new policy on alcohol is the
result of a new coercive federal policy.
The administration claims it has no
choice in its choice of making a new alco
hol policy, as Stanford will lose all feder
al funding if the administration does not
enforce the new Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act. This new policy is very
dangerous to all students who attend
this school.
As a result of this policy, underage
students choosing to drink will be com
pelled to do so behind closed doors.
This will divide dorms into social
classes of those who drink and those who
do not. Those who do choose to drink
will be fearful of their dictator RF or his
watchdogs, the RA's, looking in on their
illegal behavior.
Now, under the new policy, the stu
dent who has a drinking problem will be
afraid to go to those people, and his prob
lem will only become worse without help
from his residence staff.
What we have to look forward to now
is a new feeling of distrust between the
residential staff and the students, ran
dom room searches for empty beer cans

and any other signs of illegal consump
tion and a number of needless expul
sions.
We here at Stanford do have a choice.
Tell the administration of your distaste
for our shining new policy that sets an
example for others.
We have fallen from a great, liberal
university allowing individual freedom to
one which bows to the every whim of
President Bush and his ridiculous war on
drugs.

Stanford Bookstore
selling course readers,
aggravating students
Does the Stanford Bookstore aggra
vate the students unwillingly, or does it
try really, really hard?
Instead of allowing individual paper
companies to supply and sell course read
ers, the Bookstore has now assumed this
responsibility for some classes.
The result, however, is the complete
disappearance of convenience and ease
that accompanied buying readers in
class.
Since there were no remaining copies
of the reader at the Bookstore when I
stopped by, I was advised to "reserve" a
copy by pre-paying for it.
Though my reader is already paid for,
it will not be ready for two days. At least.
Last year, students received readers
when they needed them.
To make matters worse, the cost of
the reader — which I don't even have yet
— is double the cost of any reader that I
purchased last year (and the CIV reader
were pretty thick).
Please, Stanford Bookstore, let copy
centers produce the course readers. It's
not only more economical for students,
but more importantly, it's much more
convenient.
