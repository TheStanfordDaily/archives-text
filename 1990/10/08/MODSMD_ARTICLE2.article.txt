# New director hopes to broaden Afro-Am

Easing into a chair in his office in a
Wilbur modular trailer, Horace Porter laces
together his hands, uncorks a saintly smile
and explains his path to becoming the fifth
director of Stanford's African and Afro-
Ainerican Studies program.
"This university wanted me," Porter
laughed, his eyes glowing in anticipation of
his future here. "My wife also considered
Stanford to be an Eden surrounded by
acres of rolling hills illuminated by divine
light. Where else could be better than par
adise?" he added.
But as the 40-year-old former Dart
mouth professor of English and African and
Afro-American Studies takes charge of
Stanford's program this quarter, he is
mindful that even in heaven there can be
hell.
Hired after a yearlong nationwide search
for a director, Porter inherits a program

which has survived and thrived for 20 years
while similar programs at other universi
ties have failed.
But some Stanford professors say that
African and Afro-American Studies here —
beset by underfunding, the lack of a gradu
ate program, too much emphasis on the
humanities as opposed to the social sciences
and the inability to appoint its own tenured
faculty — has not fully tapped its potential.
University officials said they hope the
Porter era will see the continuing improve
ment and incorporation of Afro-American
Studies into the broader tapestry of the
Stanford curriculum.
"I expect that Mr. Porter will inspire
more undergraduates to conduct research
by deepening the intellectual pursuits that
form black studies at Stanford," said Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas.
Flattered yet unfazed by such optimism,
Porter warned that any change or progress
