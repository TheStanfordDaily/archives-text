# New director hopes to broaden Afro-Am
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
Easing into a chair in his office in a
Wilbur modular trailer, Horace Porter laces
together his hands, uncorks a saintly smile
and explains his path to becoming the fifth
director of Stanford's African and Afro-
Ainerican Studies program.
"This university wanted me," Porter
laughed, his eyes glowing in anticipation of
his future here. "My wife also considered
Stanford to be an Eden surrounded by
acres of rolling hills illuminated by divine
light. Where else could be better than par
adise?" he added.
But as the 40-year-old former Dart
mouth professor of English and African and
Afro-American Studies takes charge of
Stanford's program this quarter, he is
mindful that even in heaven there can be
hell.
Hired after a yearlong nationwide search
for a director, Porter inherits a program

which has survived and thrived for 20 years
while similar programs at other universi
ties have failed.
But some Stanford professors say that
African and Afro-American Studies here —
beset by underfunding, the lack of a gradu
ate program, too much emphasis on the
humanities as opposed to the social sciences
and the inability to appoint its own tenured
faculty — has not fully tapped its potential.
University officials said they hope the
Porter era will see the continuing improve
ment and incorporation of Afro-American
Studies into the broader tapestry of the
Stanford curriculum.
"I expect that Mr. Porter will inspire
more undergraduates to conduct research
by deepening the intellectual pursuits that
form black studies at Stanford," said Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas.
Flattered yet unfazed by such optimism,
Porter warned that any change or progress

will not occur overnight.
"I don't see myself as the mes
siah of this program or even Mar
tin Luther King Jr., for that mat
ter," he said. But "I do have defi
nite ideas for African and Afro-
American studies and on issues of
black scholarship in general," he
added.
In fact, Porter's philosophy on
teaching Afro-American studies
has been a lifetime in the making.
Porter was born into a "good
ol' Southern family" in Colum
bus, Ga. in 1950. As a student at
Amherst College in Mas
sachusetts, he said he hoped to
find the black American experi
ence taken more seriously as an
academic pursuit.
But amid a sea of good inten
tions and sincerity, Afro-Ameri
can studies was relegated to "an
afternoon of goodwill" or treated
as a "problem to be fixed," Porter
said.
"From that point in my life on
I was dedicated to getting in the
position of making a difference in
how the African-American experi
ence and African and Afro-Ameri
can studies were presented to stu
dents," he explained. "I wanted to
make sure my people were taken
earnestly from a scholarly point
of view. I've dedicated my life to
that end."
After graduating from
Amherst in 1972, Porter went on
to graduate work at Yale, receiv
ing a master's degree in 1975 and
a doctorate in 1981.
After spending 11 years teach
ing at Dartmouth — and braving

11 bone-chilling, arctic winters —
Porter admitted Stanford is a wel
come change. He praised the ideo
logical composition of Stanford —
"home of the Western Culture vic
tory" — as fertile ground in which
to nurture a program in Afro-
American Studies, a program of
study he believes all students can
benefit from.
"I view black studies not as
separate or apart, but right at the
heart of the matter of what is
happening in the landscape of
American education," he
stressed.
"If American students cannot
deal with the African and Afro-
American experience, it is going
to be more difficult to deal with
those people across the globe who
exist beyond the confines of the
American imagination," he
added.
Although Porter has the full
support of Thomas and other fac
ulty and staff, he said it is still too
soon to determine any specific
structural changes in the future
of African and Afro-American
studies.
"I'm optimistic about the
future," he said, scanning his
cramped office. "First we will look
at the and get more stu
dents and faculty involved."
"The next order of business is
to move out of this trailer!" said
Porter, who had Robert Frost's
old office back at Dartmouth.
And the vision five years from
now? Porter glowed.
"I want it to be the case that
when you say African and Afro-
American Studies anywhere in
the country, in the world, that the
name of Stanford University will
immediately come to everyone's
lips. Period."
