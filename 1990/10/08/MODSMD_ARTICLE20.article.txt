## An uncontrollable sleep 
### 
SLEEE I'VE DISCOVERED is the
hardest thing in the world to con
trol. I usually do not consciously
determine when I go to sleep, it just sort
of happens, with or without my consent.
And only rarely do I manage to control
the time at which I awaken, even with the
help of an alarm clock.
I slept, for example, in the dorm lounge
last night. It wasn't because I was locked
out or because my roommate kicked me
out; I just fell asleep there.
One minute I'm sitting there comfort
ably and quietly, trying to finish the read
ing for my Cultures, Ideas and Values
class. The next thing I know the sun is
beginning to rise, and I'm sprawled out
on the couch with a backache, a kink in
my neck and an unread book.
It used to be that I only fell asleep if I
read in bed. Actually, I never used to fall
asleep when I read at all.
I wasn't afflicted with the heinous
habit until sometime during my sopho
more year in high school when I had to
read a really dry book titled "History of
the Modern World." I haven't been able to
cure myself since.
In fact, my condition has steadily wors
ened. It takes me a progressively shorter
and shorter amount of time to fall asleep
when I'm reading.
And I'm not talking about little five or
10 minute naps. I mean, serious sleep.
This summer, for example, I was sup
posed to read this book about myths. It
wasn't that long or difficult to under
stand, but it took me about a week to read
it anyway.
I would read for five minutes and sleep
for an hour. Then I would awaken, look at

the clock, chastise myself for being
unproductive, and go back to sleep. It
doesn't take a math wizard to figure out
that this is not the most efficient way of
getting an assignment read.
Sometimes I don't fall asleep outright.
I just sort of space out, or I find myself
reading the same line over and over again
without knowing what it's saying. At
times like those I figure I'm simply too
tired to read and decide to take a nap.
Depending on the time of day, this
"nap" could last anywhere from half an
hour to eight hours. I'm less likely to
sleep for a long period of time while the
sun is up. It always makes me feel guilty,
as though I were wasting my day away.
It's especially dangerous to go to the
library to read. Contrary to popular
belief, it is not the best place to get things
done.
The atmosphere is so cool and quiet
and tranquil there that you almost can't
help but fall asleep, especially if you sit in
one of those arm chairs on the third level
of Meyer, the ones that face eacfi other so
you can prop your feet up.
At least I've figured out a few ways of
escaping sleep, at least temporarily, but
they're not entirely reliable. I've learned,
for example, not to read lying down, but
sitting upright, not to read in bed, not to
read on a full stomach, not to be too com
fortable, and not to be too warm and cozy.
Otherwise, sleep will invariably over
whelm me.
Even when I fall asleep by choice, I can
rarely control when I get up. For instance,
if it's getting late at night and I'm really
tired, but I still have a lot of work left to
do, I'll tell myself to either take a short

half-hour nap or to just go to bed and
wake up at a an ungodly hour in the
morning — usually around four o'clock —
and finish the work then.
This "sleep now, work when you get up
early in the morning" plan almost never
works. I usually can't get up that soon
after I've gone to sleep.
An alarm clock doesn't help much
either. I just end up turning it off and
going back to sleep. Sometimes I can't
even remember turning it off, the action
has become so automatic through con
stant practice, but I know that I must
have because when I went to bed the
alarm button was on, and when I finally
woke up several hours after the target
time tlie alarm button had been turned
off.
I don't understand why I have such a
problem with sleep, why I can't seem to
control it anymore. It's not fair that I
have more trouble trying to rein in my
sleeping hours than I do with some of my
homework assignments.
The positive way to look at this, I sup
pose, is to think that at least I'll never
have to spend money on sleeping pills.
After all, who needs Valium or Sominex
when a book, or even nothing at all, will
do just as well?

The atmosphere is so cool and quiet
and tranquil there that you almost can't
help but fall asleep, especially if you sit in
one of those arm chairs on the third level
of Meyer, the ones that face eacfi other so
you can prop your feet up.
At least I've figured out a few ways of
escaping sleep, at least temporarily, but
they're not entirely reliable. I've learned,
for example, not to read lying down, but
sitting upright, not to read in bed, not to
read on a full stomach, not to be too com
fortable, and not to be too warm and cozy.
Otherwise, sleep will invariably over
whelm me.
Even when I fall asleep by choice, I can
rarely control when I get up. For instance,
if it's getting late at night and I'm really
tired, but I still have a lot of work left to
do, I'll tell myself to either take a short

half-hour nap or to just go to bed and
wake up at a an ungodly hour in the
morning — usually around four o'clock —
and finish the work then.
This "sleep now, work when you get up
early in the morning" plan almost never
works. I usually can't get up that soon
after I've gone to sleep.
An alarm clock doesn't help much
either. I just end up turning it off and
going back to sleep. Sometimes I can't
even remember turning it off, the action
has become so automatic through con
stant practice, but I know that I must
have because when I went to bed the
alarm button was on, and when I finally
woke up several hours after the target
time tlie alarm button had been turned
off.
I don't understand why I have such a
problem with sleep, why I can't seem to
control it anymore. It's not fair that I
have more trouble trying to rein in my
sleeping hours than I do with some of my
homework assignments.
The positive way to look at this, I sup
pose, is to think that at least I'll never
have to spend money on sleeping pills.
After all, who needs Valium or Sominex
when a book, or even nothing at all, will
do just as well?

SLEEE I'VE DISCOVERED is the
hardest thing in the world to con
trol. I usually do not consciously
determine when I go to sleep, it just sort
of happens, with or without my consent.
And only rarely do I manage to control
the time at which I awaken, even with the
help of an alarm clock.
I slept, for example, in the dorm lounge
last night. It wasn't because I was locked
out or because my roommate kicked me
out; I just fell asleep there.
One minute I'm sitting there comfort
ably and quietly, trying to finish the read
ing for my Cultures, Ideas and Values
class. The next thing I know the sun is
beginning to rise, and I'm sprawled out
on the couch with a backache, a kink in
my neck and an unread book.
It used to be that I only fell asleep if I
read in bed. Actually, I never used to fall
asleep when I read at all.
I wasn't afflicted with the heinous
habit until sometime during my sopho
more year in high school when I had to
read a really dry book titled "History of
the Modern World." I haven't been able to
cure myself since.
In fact, my condition has steadily wors
ened. It takes me a progressively shorter
and shorter amount of time to fall asleep
when I'm reading.
And I'm not talking about little five or
10 minute naps. I mean, serious sleep.
This summer, for example, I was sup
posed to read this book about myths. It
wasn't that long or difficult to under
stand, but it took me about a week to read
it anyway.
I would read for five minutes and sleep
for an hour. Then I would awaken, look at

the clock, chastise myself for being
unproductive, and go back to sleep. It
doesn't take a math wizard to figure out
that this is not the most efficient way of
getting an assignment read.
Sometimes I don't fall asleep outright.
I just sort of space out, or I find myself
reading the same line over and over again
without knowing what it's saying. At
times like those I figure I'm simply too
tired to read and decide to take a nap.
Depending on the time of day, this
"nap" could last anywhere from half an
hour to eight hours. I'm less likely to
sleep for a long period of time while the
sun is up. It always makes me feel guilty,
as though I were wasting my day away.
It's especially dangerous to go to the
library to read. Contrary to popular
belief, it is not the best place to get things
done.
