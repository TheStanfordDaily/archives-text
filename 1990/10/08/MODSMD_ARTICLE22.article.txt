## Joel Beinin For what reason is the United States in the Persian Gulf? 
### 
WHY ARE WE IN THE Persian
Gulf? Some 150,000 U.S. soldiers,
dozens of ships and hundreds of
aircraft are positioned in Saudi Arabia
and the Persian Gulf.
As we teeter on the brink of war, there
has been little public debate about
whether this massive operation, the
largest overseas military deployment
since Vietnam, is necessary and what its
ultimate purpose might be.
The Persian Gulf crisis has brought
about a rapid revision of the official U.S.
view of Iraq. In 1980, the Carter adminis
tration encouraged Iraq to attack Iran,
hoping to destroy the Iranian revolution.
Before the invasion of Kuwait both the
Reagan and Bush administration said lit
tle or nothing about Saddam Hussein's
massive human rights violations because
his regime, despite its extraordinary bru
tality, was regarded as a barrier to Iranian
influence in the Persian Gulf and the pro
tector of small pro-American Arab oil
exporting states like Kuwait.
The Bush administration's official jus
tification for the rapid military build-up is
that the troops have been dispatched to
defend Saudi Arabia from attack by Iraq.
Yet many knowledgeable observers,
including former U.S. Ambassador to
Saudi Arabia James Aikens and Israeli
military intelligence, believe that Iraq
had no intention of invading Saudi Arabia
after it occupied Kuwait.
Occupying Saudi Arabia would have
been much more difficult and more costly
than the takeover of Kuwait and unneces
sary to secure Iraq's purposes.
Saddam Hussein's objective in invad
ing Kuwait was to gain access to its oil
and use the income from its sale to
finance economic reconstruction after the
devastating war with Iran. Even if the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait were permit
ted to stand, the supply of oil would not
have been at risk.
The immediate issue in the Persian
Gulf crisis, which has not been publicly
articulated by the Bush administration is,
therefore, who may control the price of
oil.
Saudi Arabia has had the dominant
influence over international oil prices by
virtue of its control of some 25 percent of
the proven reserves outside the former
Soviet bloc.
Since they are not in need of immedi
ate additional income, the Saudis prefer
to pump oil out of the ground over a long
period of time, allowing the price to rise

gradually.
Saudi (and Kuwaiti) wealth is invested
mainly in the West, so the royal family
has been careful to avoid a recurrence of
the recessions associated with the oil
price shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-80.
The Saudis are also anxious to prevent
the price of oil from rising so high that
alternative energy sources become eco
nomically viable. So, despite occasional
frictions, the Saudis have generally coop
erated with Western interests by main
taining a relatively low price for oil and
recycling petrodollars into Europe and
North America.
In return, every U.S. president since
Franklin D. Roosevelt has guaranteed the
security of the Saudi royal family.
Iraq and Kuwait together contain 20
percent of the oil reserves outside the for
mer Soviet bloc. Iraq's control of these
resources, in addition to its capacity to
intimidate Saudi Arabia militarily, chal
lenges the Saudi position as international
pxic jetter.
At an OPEC meeting in July, preceding
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Saudis and
Iraqis agreed that the price of oil was too
low but disagreed on how much to
increase it.
The Saudis proposed an increase from
about $15-$ 18 a barrel to $21 a barrel,
while the Iraqis wanted to go as high as
$25 a barrel. According to Thomas Fried
man (The New York Times, Aug. 12,
1990), this difference would translate
into about five cents per gallon of gaso
line.
It is unlikely that the Iraqis would
have driven the price much higher
because they also understand that this
would stimulate conservation and devel
opment of alternative energy sources,
which could diminish the value of oil.
The Bush administration, like its pre
decessors, agrees that the undemocratic
and repressive Saudi royal family may
exercise the decisive influence over the
price of oil because its sovereignty is lim
ited, it can not effectively oppose U.S.
wishes for a protracted period of time,
and its economic strategy coincides with
American interests.
The Bush administration is unwilling
to permit the undemocratic and repres
sive regime of Saddam Hussein to exer
cise similar power because Saddam is less
amenable to American pressure and has
regional ambitions that may threaten the
stability of American clients.
So, as Friedman concluded, "troops

have been sent to retain control of oil in
the hands of a pro-American Saudi Ara
bia, so prices will remain low."
The price of oil has already increased
more than it might have if not a single
U.S. soldier had been sent to the Persian
Gulf. It could become difficult to persuade
the American people that we should,
nonetheless, resolutely defend an abso
lute monarchy where it is illegal for
women to drive cars or travel unaccompa
nied by male relatives.
So the Bush administration has
resorted to the politics of fear, undertak
ing a campaign to demonize Sad
dam Hussein despite its own previously
cozy relations with Iraq.
As the crisis drags on, it hÂ§s become
clear that United States forces are con
templating an offensive strike against
Iraq, although this has not been
announced by President Bush or
approved by Congress.
In a widely published interview, (Wash
ington Post, Sept. 16,1990) former Air
Force Chief of Staff General Michael J.
Dugan announced that the projected
United States assault on Iraq would fea
ture a massive air bombardment. Accord
ing to Dugan, who was summarily dis
missed for his revelations, "Downtown
Baghdad would be the cutting edge."
This antiseptic and technologically hip
jargon does not conceal that civilian sites

are prominent targets of the United
States strategy. Dugan also said that
there might be an effort to assassinate
Saddam Hussein, his family and his mis
tress. One week later the Washington
Post published a plan for a four-pronged
attack on Iraq.
Pentagon sources have estimated that
it could require as much as $15 billion to
maintain United States forces in the Mid
dle East through fiscal year 1990-91 even
if they do not fire a single bullet in com
bat.
Additional costs could include the
Bush administration's proposal to forgive
Egypt's $7 billion military debt as well as
the probability that it will also cancel
Israel's $4.5 billion military debt so that
it will not appear that United States-
Egyptian relations are becoming closer to
the detriment of United States-Israeli
relations.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have offered
to contribute $5 billion each to finance
the United States expedition, but half of
their contributions will be dispensed to
Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, who have suf
fered the heaviest direct economic losses
from the crisis.
Japan and western Europe have been
reluctant to finance the United States
military deployment directly and have
offered to provide assistance to affected
Middle Eastern states instead.

As a result, in the quite likely event
that forces remain in the Middle East for
another year, the United States could be
left with a bill amounting to more than
$20 billion.
Military contractors, however, will
profit handsomely from the proposed $20
billion sale of arms to Saudi Arabia, at
least part of which will be paid for out of
profits from the increased price of oil.
And United States oil corporations will
benefit from increased prices more than
the oil exporting states if past experience
is any guide.
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has provided
an opportunity to achieve a persistent
goal of United States policy since the Ira
nian revolution of 1979 removed the for
mer Shah of Iran as guardian of the sta
bility of the pro-American Arab oil
exporting states: securing a military base
in the Persian Gulf. .
Until now, requests for such facilities
were repeatedly turned down by all the
states of the region because they feared
that such open identification with the
United States would invite criticism from
Arab nationalism or Islamic radicals.
The drive to establish a direct, public
United States military presence in the
Persian Gulf in order to protect the
region's political order and thereby to
ensure control over the price and supply
of petroleum has been a principal, but
unstated, objective underlying the Bush
administration's response to Iraq's inva
sion of Kuwait.
Pursuing this goal will be futile and
expensive. In the long run, it is impossible
for the United States to prevent social
and political changes in fragile, undemo
cratic and socially regressive Arab oil-pro
ducing states like Kuwait.
The attempt to do so will debilitate the
American economy and widen the gap
between the small number of rich and the
growing number of poor, already exacer
bated by Reagan-era social policies. The
peace dividend will be squandered on mil
itary expenditures. In the process, the
United States will become a mercenary
state whose most important export is mil
itary force to repress the third world.
Stanford community members and
neighbors who want to participate in a
critical discussion of United States policy
the Persian Gulf can do so by attending
the campus teach-in today.

ited, it can not effectively oppose U.S.
wishes for a protracted period of time,
and its economic strategy coincides with
American interests.
The Bush administration is unwilling
to permit the undemocratic and repres
sive regime of Saddam Hussein to exer
cise similar power because Saddam is less
amenable to American pressure and has
regional ambitions that may threaten the
stability of American clients.
So, as Friedman concluded, "troops

have been sent to retain control of oil in
the hands of a pro-American Saudi Ara
bia, so prices will remain low."
The price of oil has already increased
more than it might have if not a single
U.S. soldier had been sent to the Persian
Gulf. It could become difficult to persuade
the American people that we should,
nonetheless, resolutely defend an abso
lute monarchy where it is illegal for
women to drive cars or travel unaccompa
nied by male relatives.
So the Bush administration has
resorted to the politics of fear, undertak
ing a campaign to demonize Sad
dam Hussein despite its own previously
cozy relations with Iraq.
As the crisis drags on, it hÂ§s become
clear that United States forces are con
templating an offensive strike against
Iraq, although this has not been
announced by President Bush or
approved by Congress.
In a widely published interview, (Wash
ington Post, Sept. 16,1990) former Air
Force Chief of Staff General Michael J.
Dugan announced that the projected
United States assault on Iraq would fea
ture a massive air bombardment. Accord
ing to Dugan, who was summarily dis
missed for his revelations, "Downtown
Baghdad would be the cutting edge."
This antiseptic and technologically hip
jargon does not conceal that civilian sites

are prominent targets of the United
States strategy. Dugan also said that
there might be an effort to assassinate
Saddam Hussein, his family and his mis
tress. One week later the Washington
Post published a plan for a four-pronged
attack on Iraq.
Pentagon sources have estimated that
it could require as much as $15 billion to
maintain United States forces in the Mid
dle East through fiscal year 1990-91 even
if they do not fire a single bullet in com
bat.
Additional costs could include the
Bush administration's proposal to forgive
Egypt's $7 billion military debt as well as
the probability that it will also cancel
Israel's $4.5 billion military debt so that
it will not appear that United States-
Egyptian relations are becoming closer to
the detriment of United States-Israeli
relations.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have offered
to contribute $5 billion each to finance
the United States expedition, but half of
their contributions will be dispensed to
Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, who have suf
fered the heaviest direct economic losses
from the crisis.
Japan and western Europe have been
reluctant to finance the United States
military deployment directly and have
offered to provide assistance to affected
Middle Eastern states instead.

As a result, in the quite likely event
that forces remain in the Middle East for
another year, the United States could be
left with a bill amounting to more than
$20 billion.
Military contractors, however, will
profit handsomely from the proposed $20
billion sale of arms to Saudi Arabia, at
least part of which will be paid for out of
profits from the increased price of oil.
And United States oil corporations will
benefit from increased prices more than
the oil exporting states if past experience
is any guide.
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has provided
an opportunity to achieve a persistent
goal of United States policy since the Ira
nian revolution of 1979 removed the for
mer Shah of Iran as guardian of the sta
bility of the pro-American Arab oil
exporting states: securing a military base
in the Persian Gulf. .
Until now, requests for such facilities
were repeatedly turned down by all the
states of the region because they feared
that such open identification with the
United States would invite criticism from
Arab nationalism or Islamic radicals.
The drive to establish a direct, public
United States military presence in the
Persian Gulf in order to protect the
region's political order and thereby to
ensure control over the price and supply
of petroleum has been a principal, but
unstated, objective underlying the Bush
administration's response to Iraq's inva
sion of Kuwait.
Pursuing this goal will be futile and
expensive. In the long run, it is impossible
for the United States to prevent social
and political changes in fragile, undemo
cratic and socially regressive Arab oil-pro
ducing states like Kuwait.
The attempt to do so will debilitate the
American economy and widen the gap
between the small number of rich and the
growing number of poor, already exacer
bated by Reagan-era social policies. The
peace dividend will be squandered on mil
itary expenditures. In the process, the
United States will become a mercenary
state whose most important export is mil
itary force to repress the third world.

neighbors who want to participate in a
critical discussion of United States policy
the Persian Gulf can do so by attending

WHY ARE WE IN THE Persian
Gulf? Some 150,000 U.S. soldiers,
dozens of ships and hundreds of
aircraft are positioned in Saudi Arabia
and the Persian Gulf.
As we teeter on the brink of war, there
has been little public debate about
whether this massive operation, the
largest overseas military deployment
since Vietnam, is necessary and what its
ultimate purpose might be.
The Persian Gulf crisis has brought
about a rapid revision of the official U.S.
view of Iraq. In 1980, the Carter adminis
tration encouraged Iraq to attack Iran,
hoping to destroy the Iranian revolution.
Before the invasion of Kuwait both the
Reagan and Bush administration said lit
tle or nothing about Saddam Hussein's
massive human rights violations because
his regime, despite its extraordinary bru
tality, was regarded as a barrier to Iranian
influence in the Persian Gulf and the pro
tector of small pro-American Arab oil
exporting states like Kuwait.
The Bush administration's official jus
tification for the rapid military build-up is
that the troops have been dispatched to
defend Saudi Arabia from attack by Iraq.
Yet many knowledgeable observers,
including former U.S. Ambassador to
Saudi Arabia James Aikens and Israeli
military intelligence, believe that Iraq
had no intention of invading Saudi Arabia
after it occupied Kuwait.
Occupying Saudi Arabia would have
been much more difficult and more costly
than the takeover of Kuwait and unneces
sary to secure Iraq's purposes.
Saddam Hussein's objective in invad
ing Kuwait was to gain access to its oil
and use the income from its sale to
finance economic reconstruction after the
devastating war with Iran. Even if the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait were permit
ted to stand, the supply of oil would not
have been at risk.
The immediate issue in the Persian
Gulf crisis, which has not been publicly
articulated by the Bush administration is,
therefore, who may control the price of
oil.
Saudi Arabia has had the dominant
influence over international oil prices by
virtue of its control of some 25 percent of
the proven reserves outside the former
Soviet bloc.
Since they are not in need of immedi
ate additional income, the Saudis prefer
to pump oil out of the ground over a long
period of time, allowing the price to rise

gradually.
Saudi (and Kuwaiti) wealth is invested
mainly in the West, so the royal family
has been careful to avoid a recurrence of
the recessions associated with the oil
price shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-80.
The Saudis are also anxious to prevent
the price of oil from rising so high that
alternative energy sources become eco
nomically viable. So, despite occasional
frictions, the Saudis have generally coop
erated with Western interests by main
taining a relatively low price for oil and
recycling petrodollars into Europe and
North America.
In return, every U.S. president since
Franklin D. Roosevelt has guaranteed the
security of the Saudi royal family.
Iraq and Kuwait together contain 20
percent of the oil reserves outside the for
mer Soviet bloc. Iraq's control of these
resources, in addition to its capacity to
intimidate Saudi Arabia militarily, chal
lenges the Saudi position as international
pxic jetter.
At an OPEC meeting in July, preceding
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Saudis and
Iraqis agreed that the price of oil was too
low but disagreed on how much to
increase it.
The Saudis proposed an increase from
about $15-$ 18 a barrel to $21 a barrel,
while the Iraqis wanted to go as high as
$25 a barrel. According to Thomas Fried
man (The New York Times, Aug. 12,
1990), this difference would translate
into about five cents per gallon of gaso
line.
It is unlikely that the Iraqis would
have driven the price much higher
because they also understand that this
would stimulate conservation and devel
opment of alternative energy sources,
which could diminish the value of oil.
The Bush administration, like its pre
decessors, agrees that the undemocratic
and repressive Saudi royal family may
exercise the decisive influence over the
price of oil because its sovereignty is lim
ited, it can not effectively oppose U.S.
wishes for a protracted period of time,
and its economic strategy coincides with
American interests.
The Bush administration is unwilling
to permit the undemocratic and repres

sion of Kuwait.
Pursuing this goal will be futile and
expensive. In the long run, it is impossible
for the United States to prevent social
and political changes in fragile, undemo
cratic and socially regressive Arab oil-pro
ducing states like Kuwait.
The attempt to do so will debilitate the
American economy and widen the gap
between the small number of rich and the
growing number of poor, already exacer
bated by Reagan-era social policies. The
peace dividend will be squandered on mil
itary expenditures. In the process, the
United States will become a mercenary
state whose most important export is mil
itary force to repress the third world.

WHY ARE WE IN THE Persian
Gulf? Some 150,000 U.S. soldiers,
dozens of ships and hundreds of
aircraft are positioned in Saudi Arabia
and the Persian Gulf.
As we teeter on the brink of war, there
has been little public debate about
whether this massive operation, the
largest overseas military deployment
since Vietnam, is necessary and what its
ultimate purpose might be.
The Persian Gulf crisis has brought
about a rapid revision of the official U.S.
view of Iraq. In 1980, the Carter adminis
tration encouraged Iraq to attack Iran,
hoping to destroy the Iranian revolution.
Before the invasion of Kuwait both the
Reagan and Bush administration said lit
tle or nothing about Saddam Hussein's
massive human rights violations because
his regime, despite its extraordinary bru
tality, was regarded as a barrier to Iranian
influence in the Persian Gulf and the pro
tector of small pro-American Arab oil
exporting states like Kuwait.
The Bush administration's official jus
tification for the rapid military build-up is
that the troops have been dispatched to
defend Saudi Arabia from attack by Iraq.
Yet many knowledgeable observers,
including former U.S. Ambassador to
Saudi Arabia James Aikens and Israeli
military intelligence, believe that Iraq
had no intention of invading Saudi Arabia
after it occupied Kuwait.
Occupying Saudi Arabia would have
been much more difficult and more costly
than the takeover of Kuwait and unneces
sary to secure Iraq's purposes.
Saddam Hussein's objective in invad
ing Kuwait was to gain access to its oil
and use the income from its sale to
finance economic reconstruction after the
devastating war with Iran. Even if the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait were permit
ted to stand, the supply of oil would not
have been at risk.
The immediate issue in the Persian
Gulf crisis, which has not been publicly
articulated by the Bush administration is,
therefore, who may control the price of
oil.
Saudi Arabia has had the dominant
influence over international oil prices by
virtue of its control of some 25 percent of
the proven reserves outside the former
Soviet bloc.
Since they are not in need of immedi
ate additional income, the Saudis prefer
to pump oil out of the ground over a long
period of time, allowing the price to rise

gradually.
Saudi (and Kuwaiti) wealth is invested
mainly in the West, so the royal family
has been careful to avoid a recurrence of
the recessions associated with the oil
price shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-80.
The Saudis are also anxious to prevent
the price of oil from rising so high that
alternative energy sources become eco
nomically viable. So, despite occasional
frictions, the Saudis have generally coop
erated with Western interests by main
taining a relatively low price for oil and
recycling petrodollars into Europe and
North America.
In return, every U.S. president since
Franklin D. Roosevelt has guaranteed the
security of the Saudi royal family.
Iraq and Kuwait together contain 20
percent of the oil reserves outside the for
mer Soviet bloc. Iraq's control of these
resources, in addition to its capacity to
intimidate Saudi Arabia militarily, chal
lenges the Saudi position as international
pxic jetter.
At an OPEC meeting in July, preceding
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Saudis and
Iraqis agreed that the price of oil was too
low but disagreed on how much to
increase it.
The Saudis proposed an increase from
about $15-$ 18 a barrel to $21 a barrel,
while the Iraqis wanted to go as high as
$25 a barrel. According to Thomas Fried
man (The New York Times, Aug. 12,
1990), this difference would translate
into about five cents per gallon of gaso
line.
It is unlikely that the Iraqis would
have driven the price much higher
because they also understand that this
would stimulate conservation and devel
opment of alternative energy sources,
which could diminish the value of oil.
The Bush administration, like its pre
decessors, agrees that the undemocratic
and repressive Saudi royal family may
exercise the decisive influence over the
price of oil because its sovereignty is lim
ited, it can not effectively oppose U.S.
wishes for a protracted period of time,
and its economic strategy coincides with
American interests.
The Bush administration is unwilling
to permit the undemocratic and repres
sive regime of Saddam Hussein to exer
cise similar power because Saddam is less
amenable to American pressure and has
regional ambitions that may threaten the
stability of American clients.
So, as Friedman concluded, "troops

have been sent to retain control of oil in
the hands of a pro-American Saudi Ara
bia, so prices will remain low."
The price of oil has already increased
more than it might have if not a single
U.S. soldier had been sent to the Persian
Gulf. It could become difficult to persuade
the American people that we should,
nonetheless, resolutely defend an abso
lute monarchy where it is illegal for
women to drive cars or travel unaccompa
nied by male relatives.
So the Bush administration has
resorted to the politics of fear, undertak
ing a campaign to demonize Sad
dam Hussein despite its own previously
cozy relations with Iraq.
As the crisis drags on, it hÂ§s become
clear that United States forces are con
templating an offensive strike against
Iraq, although this has not been
announced by President Bush or
approved by Congress.
In a widely published interview, (Wash
ington Post, Sept. 16,1990) former Air
Force Chief of Staff General Michael J.
Dugan announced that the projected
United States assault on Iraq would fea
ture a massive air bombardment. Accord
ing to Dugan, who was summarily dis
missed for his revelations, "Downtown
Baghdad would be the cutting edge."
This antiseptic and technologically hip
jargon does not conceal that civilian sites

are prominent targets of the United
States strategy. Dugan also said that
there might be an effort to assassinate
Saddam Hussein, his family and his mis
tress. One week later the Washington
Post published a plan for a four-pronged
attack on Iraq.
Pentagon sources have estimated that
it could require as much as $15 billion to
maintain United States forces in the Mid
dle East through fiscal year 1990-91 even
if they do not fire a single bullet in com
bat.
Additional costs could include the
Bush administration's proposal to forgive
Egypt's $7 billion military debt as well as
the probability that it will also cancel
Israel's $4.5 billion military debt so that
it will not appear that United States-
Egyptian relations are becoming closer to
the detriment of United States-Israeli
relations.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have offered
to contribute $5 billion each to finance
the United States expedition, but half of
their contributions will be dispensed to
Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, who have suf
fered the heaviest direct economic losses
from the crisis.
Japan and western Europe have been
reluctant to finance the United States
military deployment directly and have
offered to provide assistance to affected
Middle Eastern states instead.

As a result, in the quite likely event
that forces remain in the Middle East for
another year, the United States could be
left with a bill amounting to more than
$20 billion.
Military contractors, however, will
profit handsomely from the proposed $20
billion sale of arms to Saudi Arabia, at
least part of which will be paid for out of
profits from the increased price of oil.
And United States oil corporations will
benefit from increased prices more than
the oil exporting states if past experience
is any guide.
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has provided
an opportunity to achieve a persistent
goal of United States policy since the Ira
nian revolution of 1979 removed the for
mer Shah of Iran as guardian of the sta
bility of the pro-American Arab oil
exporting states: securing a military base
in the Persian Gulf. .
Until now, requests for such facilities
were repeatedly turned down by all the
states of the region because they feared
that such open identification with the
United States would invite criticism from
Arab nationalism or Islamic radicals.
The drive to establish a direct, public
United States military presence in the
Persian Gulf in order to protect the
region's political order and thereby to
ensure control over the price and supply
of petroleum has been a principal, but
unstated, objective underlying the Bush
administration's response to Iraq's inva
sion of Kuwait.
Pursuing this goal will be futile and
expensive. In the long run, it is impossible
for the United States to prevent social
and political changes in fragile, undemo
cratic and socially regressive Arab oil-pro
ducing states like Kuwait.
The attempt to do so will debilitate the
American economy and widen the gap
between the small number of rich and the
growing number of poor, already exacer
bated by Reagan-era social policies. The
peace dividend will be squandered on mil
itary expenditures. In the process, the
United States will become a mercenary
state whose most important export is mil
itary force to repress the third world.
