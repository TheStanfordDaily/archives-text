## Balance a key in huge upset 
### David Earnest Senior Staff Writer 
The only person more generous
than Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis during Saturday's stun
ning 36-31 upset of Notre Dame
was Stanford coach Denny Green.
Just as Palumbis' passes found
every conceivable Stanford
receiver, Green hurled compli
ments toward every member of an
offensive unit that for one glori
ous afternoon found a balanced
attack capable of defeating the
nation's best college football
team.
"I think the big thing is con
trolling the ball," Green said after
the game. "We have an offense
that [requires us to] be balanced
with the pass and the run, to set
tle for three or four yards on the
run and sometimes three or four
on the pass."
That conservative, ball-control
offense mounted impressive
drives of 80, 62, 50 and 61 yards
against one of the toughest
defenses around. Palumbis con
nected with eight different Stan
ford receivers, and four running
backs tallied 87 yards on the
ground.
More importantly, Palumbis
converted a third-down and a
fourth-down play on the game
winning drive. On third down and
three at the Stanford 46-yard line
Palumbis found tailback Glyn Mil
burn to the right for an 8-yard
gain. Four plays later, after
Palumbis hit wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey for six yards on third
and-eight, the Cardinal quarter
back gained two yards on a fourth
and-two keeper to keep the drive
going.
"They couldn't tell what we
were doing and they were guess
ing," center Chris Dalman said.
"They couldn't tell if we were
going to run or pass it."
"I think we were a little edgy at
the beginning. Things weren't
working out; they were playing
good defense," Palumbis said.
"But then we started throwing
the ball downfield, opening up our
running game a little bit, and
things just started flowing."
Once the offense got going in
the second half, Palumbis and the
offense compiled impressive num
bers against the Fighting Irish
defense. Palumbis completed 26 of
34 passes for 256 yards. Fullback
Tommy Vardell scored four one
yard touchdowns and had 13 car
ries for 37 yards.
"We call number 44 'Touch
down Tommy.' He's a guy that
wants you know he's going to get
the ball. We know he's going to get
the ball, everybody knows he's
going to get the ball, and we want
you to stop him," Green said of
Vardell, who has scored 11 touch
downs in five games.
"You can't stop Tommy inside
the two," Palumbis said. "He will
bowl over anyone. How are you
going to stop a 230-pound guy div
ing over the line?"
The most impressive perfor
mance, however, belonged to
McCaffrey, who piled up 111 yards
on six receptions against Notre
Dame cornerback Todd Lyght. A
preseason choice for All-America
honors, the 6-foot-l Lyght was
dominated by the 6-foot-6 McCaf
frey and the lofted passes from
Palumbis.
"Ed McCaffrey played
extremely well," Green said. "He
made some big plays in the first
and second halves that enabled us
to do some good things."
"I don't know how many times
I've thrown to Ed down to the 1-
yard line ... but we keep doing
that and we've got Tommy bull
dozing over people for touch
downs."
Tailback Glyn Milburn, who
last week led the Cardinal in rush
ing and receiving yardage, was
held to just 23 yards on the
ground but caught six Palumbis
tosses. Tight end Cory Booker,
playing for the injured Turner
Baur, caught four balls and
Vardell caught five.
And when Palumbis throws,
Green tosses compliments to
everyone, his coaching staff
included.
"I think we run the best pro
gram, in my opinion, or one of the
best programs, in the country....
We're going to have some success
along the way, but the rest of the
way we have a very difficult sched
ule."
"We've got a lot of talent and
we've had a few losses," Palumbis
said. "We wanted to come in here
today and shock the world and
that's what we did. I'm really
proud of this team."

down Tommy.' He's a guy that
wants you know he's going to get
the ball. We know he's going to get
the ball, everybody knows he's
going to get the ball, and we want
you to stop him," Green said of
Vardell, who has scored 11 touch
downs in five games.
"You can't stop Tommy inside
the two," Palumbis said. "He will
bowl over anyone. How are you
going to stop a 230-pound guy div
ing over the line?"
The most impressive perfor
mance, however, belonged to
McCaffrey, who piled up 111 yards
on six receptions against Notre
Dame cornerback Todd Lyght. A
preseason choice for All-America
honors, the 6-foot-l Lyght was
dominated by the 6-foot-6 McCaf
frey and the lofted passes from
Palumbis.
"Ed McCaffrey played
extremely well," Green said. "He
made some big plays in the first
and second halves that enabled us
to do some good things."
"I don't know how many times
I've thrown to Ed down to the 1-
yard line ... but we keep doing
that and we've got Tommy bull
dozing over people for touch
downs."
Tailback Glyn Milburn, who
last week led the Cardinal in rush
ing and receiving yardage, was
held to just 23 yards on the
ground but caught six Palumbis
tosses. Tight end Cory Booker,
playing for the injured Turner
Baur, caught four balls and
Vardell caught five.
And when Palumbis throws,
Green tosses compliments to
everyone, his coaching staff
included.
"I think we run the best pro
gram, in my opinion, or one of the
best programs, in the country....
We're going to have some success
along the way, but the rest of the
way we have a very difficult sched
ule."
"We've got a lot of talent and
we've had a few losses," Palumbis
said. "We wanted to come in here
today and shock the world and
that's what we did. I'm really
proud of this team."

Tommy Vardell dives over the line to score the winning touchdown In the Cardinal's 36-31 upset of No. 1 Notre Dame. Vardell scored
four touchdowns in the game, one short of the school record, and now has a Pac-10-leading 11 on the season.
The only person more generous
than Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis during Saturday's stun
ning 36-31 upset of Notre Dame
was Stanford coach Denny Green.
Just as Palumbis' passes found
every conceivable Stanford
receiver, Green hurled compli
ments toward every member of an
offensive unit that for one glori
ous afternoon found a balanced
attack capable of defeating the
nation's best college football
team.
"I think the big thing is con
trolling the ball," Green said after
the game. "We have an offense
that [requires us to] be balanced
with the pass and the run, to set
tle for three or four yards on the
run and sometimes three or four
on the pass."
That conservative, ball-control
offense mounted impressive
drives of 80, 62, 50 and 61 yards
against one of the toughest
defenses around. Palumbis con
nected with eight different Stan
ford receivers, and four running
backs tallied 87 yards on the
ground.
More importantly, Palumbis
converted a third-down and a
fourth-down play on the game
winning drive. On third down and
three at the Stanford 46-yard line
Palumbis found tailback Glyn Mil
burn to the right for an 8-yard
gain. Four plays later, after
Palumbis hit wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey for six yards on third
and-eight, the Cardinal quarter
back gained two yards on a fourth
and-two keeper to keep the drive
going.
"They couldn't tell what we
were doing and they were guess
ing," center Chris Dalman said.
"They couldn't tell if we were
going to run or pass it."
"I think we were a little edgy at
the beginning. Things weren't
working out; they were playing
good defense," Palumbis said.
"But then we started throwing
the ball downfield, opening up our
running game a little bit, and
things just started flowing."
Once the offense got going in
the second half, Palumbis and the
offense compiled impressive num
bers against the Fighting Irish
defense. Palumbis completed 26 of
34 passes for 256 yards. Fullback
Tommy Vardell scored four one
yard touchdowns and had 13 car
ries for 37 yards.
"We call number 44 'Touch
down Tommy.' He's a guy that
wants you know he's going to get
the ball. We know he's going to get
the ball, everybody knows he's
going to get the ball, and we want
you to stop him," Green said of
Vardell, who has scored 11 touch
downs in five games.
"You can't stop Tommy inside
the two," Palumbis said. "He will
bowl over anyone. How are you

ing over the line?"
