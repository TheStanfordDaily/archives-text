# Shorthanded spikers sweep Washington, WSU
## 
### Harold Yu Staff Writer 
In volleyball, there are four mistakes
that are statistically recorded: reception
errors, service errors, blocking errors, and
hitting errors. This weekend Washington
State ande Washington committed all those
and invented a few more while succumbing
to Stanford at Burnham Pavilion.

The Cardinal (10-2, 7-1 in Pacific 10
Conference play) wallopped the Washing
tons in conference matches Friday and Sat
urday, crunching Washington State, 15-6,
15-10, 15-4 and munching UW, 15-5, 15-12,
15-6.
Both team's first error may have been
showing up. Washington State could expect
little from their one-player offense. Even
with Kelly Hankins, a .314 hitter, the
Cougars would need a cataclysmic turn of
events to throttle Stanford. Washington
meanwhile arrived fresh from a loss to last
place California and featured a starting
lineup that averaged a Division-11-like 5-
foot-9.
"I feel pretty good [about what hap
pened!," Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"We shouldn't really have trouble with
these teams."
The Cardinal certainly did not. Despite a
slow start against Washington State, Stan
ford dominated every aspect of the match.
Down 2-5 in the first game, the Cardinal
began to vary its offense. Reserve middle
blocker Nicole Appleman, starting in senior
Jessica Benton's absence, terrorized the
Cougars with relentless hitting.
While defenders concentrated on Stan
ford's three primary attackers, Appleman
pounded away. The El Toro, Calif., native
led the squad on a furious 15-1 run and fin
ished the night with nine kills for a match
high .667 hitting percentage.
"I've been waiting for a chance to play,"
Appleman said. "I just did my job."
After the brief intermission, the brutali
ties resumed. Sophomore Bev Oden made
sure Cougar blockers felt the brunt of their
impending defeat. She soared high on a set
from Carrie Feldman at 3-0 of game two to
smash the ball squarely in Hankins' face.
Hankins may have had that on her mind as
she proceeded to hit .000 on the night and
connect for only six kills.
Without Hankins' help, Washington
State floundered. The team committed 16
attack errors, eight service errors, seven
reception errors and two block errors. Two
Cougars hit negative on the night and the
team was virtually helpless at the net.
Washington State had three total blocks
while the Cardinal amassed nine.
Junior middle blocker Amy Cooper can

take much of the credit for that. Cooper
outblocked the entire Washington State
team, roofing five attacks while hitting a
torrid .444. "In practice, we concentrated
on their system," Cooper said. "Tonight, we
did what we were supposed to do."
If what they were supposed to do was
embarrass the opponent, then they did it.
Stanford had runs of 9-0 in game two and
11-2 in game three while winning in an
hour and seven minutes. The lopsided
nature of the affair allowed Shaw to utilize
his bench. All suited players entered the
match at some point including senior
Cheryl Conly who has recovered from an
early-season back injury.
The home vacation continued the next
night as Stanford bombed the hapless
Huskies. Washington had just lost to a win
less Pac-10 team and could strive for little
more than respectability at Burnham. Co
captain Kristin Klein took care of matters
sparking the Cardinal to runs of 6-0 and 9-
0 in game one with powerful hitting. The
junior outside hitter delivered a match-high
11 kills and rebutted would-be attackers
with five block assists. The Cardinal served
exceptionally, firing eight aces on the night.
Washington followed the wayward path
of its predecessors, struggling in every
phase of the game. The team had 20 attack
errors, eight service errors, eight reception
errors and three blocking errors.
Shaw again substituted liberally utiliz
ing 11 players. Freshman Danielle Everett
traded time with starter Jennifer Jackson.
Together, the left-side hitters combined for
seven kills. Piper Hahn was inserted in the
middle of game two and played the match
out. Redshirt freshman Kathy Jurgens,
sophomore Laurie Sawin and senior Tracy
Hughes all contributed stellar back row
play.
"The playing time is helping to develop
some players," Shaw said.
They all seem to be coming along fine.
Everett supported the Cardinal cause with
an ace at 6-5 of the second game, the only
close one of the match. Hahn served Stan
ford to a 12-3 advantage in game three to
terminate the evening's events.
However, the constants in the Stanford
equation did most of the damage. Oden
offered a .308 hitting percentage and six
kills while Cooper hit .545 without a single
attack error on the night.
"We played well tonight," Klein said.
"We're still making progress. This match
was good psychologically for us. I think
we'll be ready for the tough competition."
That competition is No. 2 Nebraska, the
only team that has defeated top-ranked
UCLA this year. The Cornhuskers will visit
Maples Pavilion Thursday and Friday for
the Stanford Invitational.
Before that the Cardinal meets Califor
nia this Tuesday night at Maples. One dol
lar from every ticket sold to that match will
be donated to a relief fund for the Cal stu
dents left homeless by the tragic fire that
struck a fraternity house on campus.
Thursday the Cardinal will open the

tournament against St. Mary's at 6 p.m.
Nebraska will face No. 15 Brigham Young
Universaity in the late match, beginning at
8 p.m.
Friday's consolation match will be
broadcast live on the Pacific Sports Net
work while the championship match will be

shown on a tape-delay basis, begining at 9
that night.
Card notes

Junior middle blocker Amy Cooper readies to pound a Carrie Feldman set to the
floor. Cooper Is one of three Cardinal starters hitting over .300 for the season and
has been a big part of the team's 10-2 start.
