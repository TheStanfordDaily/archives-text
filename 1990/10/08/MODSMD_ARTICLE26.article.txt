# Booters split in Stanford Invite
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's soccer sqaud,
the first annual Stanford/Security
Pacific National Bank Invitational
turned out to be a weekend of patience
and haste.
Saturday, the Cardinal (4-4-5) picked
up a 2-0 win against Boston University
with the return of fullback Robert Bro
phy, who had been out since Sept. 16
with a leg injury. But they were defeated
2-0 by 15th-ranked South Carolina Sun
day.
"We were patient in the first half,"
said Stanford goalkeeper Kyle Krpata of
Saturday's game. "We had our chances
later on, and we put them away.
Neither team scored in the first half,
but Stanford's Lance Killian changed
that as he beat BU's goalkeeper at the
77:10 mark. And just under four min
utes later, Brophy proved that he hadn't
lost his touch as he scored his first goal
of the season at the 81:27 mark.
Brophy, who almost lost his leg do to
a blow to his shin area, wasn't sastified
with his return, a goal, and a win this
weekend. "My leg feels a lot better, and
it is great to be back. But, I would have
traded my goal to win the tournament."
But, South Carolina had the same
idea. The Gamecocks were also playing
for the championship because they had
picked up two points for a win Saturday
as well. This unique tournament didn't
square off the winners in brackets like
most tournaments. Rather, the cham
pion was determined by gathering the

most amount of points. Each team with
a victory was awarded two points and
zero for a loss.
So, because Stanford and SC had
been scheduled to face each other Sun
day, it was by pure chance that the two
had won their previous games and had
turned yesterday's match into the
championship game.
The match proved to be nothing close
to a friendly game in the park. Stanford
wasn't about to be a gracious host. Just
six minutes into the game, the Cardi
nal's Bill "the Kidd" Bollenger picked
up a yellow card from the official for
tripping a Gamecock near midfield.
Eight minutes later, Stanford's Randy
Mann was issued the same card after he
tackled a SC offender down in the cor
ner.
The Cardinal's All-America mid
fielder Rhett Harty also displayed his
intensity. As a ball was crossed infront
of the SC goal, Harty and the Gamecock
keeper collided. The incidental contact
left the SC keeper on the grass for sev
eral moments before he was able to
resume play.
Despite these isolated incidents, the
Cardinal wasn't emotionally prepared
for the start of the game. "The first half,
we weren't ready to go," explained
Krpata.

back-to-back games.

flat. 9

Coach Colin Lindores felt that his
team might have been a little tired. "We
played two hard back-to-back games.
Today we were a little flat."
Tne Gamecocks came prepared
though. SC's Andy Ferguson streaked
down the sideline at the 29:49 mark and
hit a perfect cross to his teammate
Ruben Tufino, who deposited it in the
upper left hand corner of the net. "That
first goal was beautiful," said Harty. "It
was a beautiful cross."
That goal broke the Cardinal's
patience, which they had shown the day
before. They began to make hasty deci
sions and passes that weren't effective.
"They kept their poise longer than we
did," explained Lindores. "We didn't
develop any rhythm of play. After the
first goal, we pushed up a little too
much."
Harty agreed. "We pressed too early
in the second half."
The Gamecocks' first goal may have
been beautiful, but their second was no
Miss America. Ferguson streaked again,
but didn't dump it off. This time, he
took it himself and won a one-on-one
battle with Krpata before lazily putting
it in the net.
