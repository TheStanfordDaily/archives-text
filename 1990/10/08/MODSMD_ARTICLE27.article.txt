# Women's soccer triumphs twice to tie for tourney title
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Texas Christian must have wondered
about the strange bursts of cheers and
high fives in the stands at Maloney Field
Saturday.
While Stanford's women's soccer team
was dominating the Horned Frogs much
more than the 4-1 final indicated, the
Stanford fans — radios tuned to South
Bend, Ind. — were carrying on with great
jocularity throughout the second half.
Sunday Stanford had only to deal with
the distraction of being on cable television
for the first time, and the Cardinal
adjusted with equal aplomb, cutting down
George Mason by an identical 4-1 margin.
Stanford, llth-ranked and now 10-2
on the season, swept easily through its
own Stanford/Security Pacific Invita
tional and took another small step toward
the NCAA tournament. UC-Santa Bar
bara (10-0-1) was declared the winner of
the women's half of the tournament,
based on goal differential, because Stan
ford and Santa Barbara did not play gdch

other during the two day invitational.
The Gauchos beat George Mason 2-0 Sat
urday and hammered TCU 7-0 Sunday
morning.
But while Stanford coach Berhane
Andeberhan was not concerned about the
tournament championship — his club
may meet Santa Barbara again in the
postseason — he was excited about the
offensive punch his club displayed in the
two victories.
"This was great for us, it really keeps
hope alive," said Andeberhan, whose club
never trailed in the two games.
Texas Christian scored on its only shot
of the game Saturday, but Stanford out
shot the Horned Frogs 35-1 and could
easily have scored a half-dozen more
goals. Sophomore Julie Foudy led the
Cardinal assault with eight shots, but was
shut out for the first time in four games
before retiring midway through the sec
ond half.
Foudy was kept out of the goal again by
George Mason, but tallied an assist on a
second-half goal by freshman Nicole
Tremain. Despite not scoring, Foudy was

named the tournament MVFJ and was
joined on the all-tournament team by
Stanford's Elizabeth Joneschild, Jennifer
Rowland and Denise Denney.
Joneschild and Rowland scored two
goals each against the Horned Frogs.
Joneschild pounded in a short volley and
then followed minutes later with a cross
ing pass from the corner that found its
way into the top of the net.
In the second half, "Rocket" Rowland
lit up the scoreboard, taking a cross from
Sarah Rafanelli for one score and inter
cepting a pass to the goalie for a second.
TCU left Stanford with a 2-9-2 mark
after the twin drubbings. George Mason,
a past NCAA power, fell to- 2*2->2.. ■.-. > .

Against the Patriots on Sunday after
noon, Stanford went blow-to-blow with
the physical George Mason lineup, and
came out on top in both goals and fouls.
The tone for the match was set just six
minutes into play when Rafanelli was
tripped from behind in the penalty box.
Junior Heather Mclntyre converted the
free kick, and Stanford opened a 1-0
advantage.
"It was really good to play a good game
against these guys," said Andeberhan.
"They tried to change the rhythm by
playing physical — no dirty fouls just
physical play — and we restrained our
selves and played with composure. We
stumbled a little at first, but when we
adjusted to their style, it was easy."
The Patriots temporarily got back into
the game when Carol Lind scored past
Denney after goalie Elise Edwards had
been drawn out of the goal. But the left
foot of Rafanelli put Stanford on top to
stay three minutes later, as she collected a
pass from Rowland and rolled it in front
of a flat-flooted goalie Hollis Kosco.
"We looked strong," said freshman for"

ward Rafanelli, who scored her seventh
goal of the season and her first in the last
six games. "We're developing a style of
play that has everyone playing up to their
potential. We are still improving and it's
exciting to see us grow as a team."
Rafanelli is still in therapy for a knee
injury, but she says she is playing without
pain and the knee "feels very strong."
Stanford scored its most artistic goal of
the game 20 minutes into the second half
when Joneschild scored her third goal of
the tournament on a booming cross from
sophomore Carolyn Einstein. Joneschild
headed the ball into the top of the net,
increasing the Stanford lead to 3-1.
Tremain, on an assist from Foudy, fin
ished the scoring just seconds after being
inserted into the lineup, rolling in her
first collegiate goal and making Andeber
han look like a genius bench coach for his
timely substitution.
"It was very exciting," said Tremain,
who started celebrating before the ball
even crossed the goal line. "Foudy told me
1 was going to score a goal, and just like
that she gave it td me."
