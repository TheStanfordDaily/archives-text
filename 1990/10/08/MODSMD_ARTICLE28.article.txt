# Third-ranked Stanford comes up short against No. 1 Cal
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
While the Stanford football
team was busy upsetting the No. 1
team in the nation, the water polo
team was trying to do the same
thing.
The only problem was that No.
1-ranked California didn't go
along with the plans.
Before an estimated 700 fans
and cable television cameras at
deGuerre Pool Friday afternoon,
the Cardinal could not overcome
some key mistakes and were
defeated by a score of 11-7.
The Cardinal started out the
game looking as though it was the
No. 1 team and not Cal, but by the
end of the game, it was clear that
on this day, the Bears were indeed
the better team.
As coach Dante Dettamanti
said, "We did some things really
well, but we also did some pretty
bad things. We've got to be able to
overcome those mistakes that we
make, and we weren't able to do
that. Until we do, we don't
deserve to be the No. 1 or 2 team
in the country."
Behind great goalkeeping by
freshman Larry Bercutt and early
goals by three seniors — Chuck
Maguy, Greg Olson and Colin
Keely — the Cardinal jumped out
to an early 3-1 lead and seemed to
be in control of the match.
But then, after a Cal goal by

Water Polo

Golden Bears 11

Cardinal 7

All-American Chris Humbert cut
the lead to 3-2, disaster struck for
Stanford. Ail?r making a save,
Bercutt looked up and saw two
Cardinal players wide open on the
counter-attack. Bercutt threw
the ball to the open player, Olson,
but the throw was too short and
hit Olson in the head and bounced
back — right to a Cal player.
Within seconds, the ball was back
in front of the Stanford goal and
Humbert was putting in his third
goal of the day.
Needless to say, the two-goal
turnaround was a major turning
point in the game. "After that
play, everything just seemed to go
downhill," Dettamanti said. "It
was a psychologically damaging
play."
Keely agreed with his coach.
"That was a really bad break for
us. We would have had an easy
goal, and before we knew it, they
were the ones with the goad."
Following that play, the Bears
went on a scoring binge, outscor
ing Stanford 6-1 to take a com
manding 9-4 lead with only six
minutes left in the game.
The Cardinal valiantly fought
back, however, scoring three

unanswered goals, and when Chip
Blankenhorn took a pass from
Maguy and scored with three min
utes left in the game, the Cardinal
was only down 9-7. Unfortu
nately, that was as close as the No.
3-ranked Stanford was to get, as
Cal managed to run out the clock
and score two more goals.
Other than this scoring burst
and the early goals, Stanford's
offense, which was averaging
nearly 12 goals over the last nine
games, never really got in synch.
In fact, this was only the fourth
time all year the team has not
scored 10 goals. As Dettamanti
said, "Our front-court offense was
not effective, and we didn't take
nearly enough shots."
Other than Stanford's own
mistakes, what really did the Car
dinal in was Humbert. The 6-
foot-6 inch junior scored a whop
ping six times in the game and
showed why he led the U.S.
National Team in scoring at the
recently-held Goodwill Games. As
Dettamanti said, "Humbert is the
best collegiate player in the coun
try, and he just did a great job out
there."
Despite the loss, the Cardinal
know the season is hardly over.
"We have a lot of games left," Det
tamanti said. "We have to see
some improvement, and now, we
know what we have to improve
on."

the ball to the open player, Olson,
but the throw was too short and
hit Olson in the head and bounced
back — right to a Cal player.
Within seconds, the ball was back
in front of the Stanford goal and
Humbert was putting in his third
goal of the day.
Needless to say, the two-goal
turnaround was a major turning
point in the game. "After that
play, everything just seemed to go
downhill," Dettamanti said. "It
was a psychologically damaging
play."
Keely agreed with his coach.
"That was a really bad break for
us. We would have had an easy
goal, and before we knew it, they
were the ones with the goad."
Following that play, the Bears
went on a scoring binge, outscor
ing Stanford 6-1 to take a com
manding 9-4 lead with only six
minutes left in the game.
The Cardinal valiantly fought
back, however, scoring three

unanswered goals, and when Chip
Blankenhorn took a pass from
Maguy and scored with three min
utes left in the game, the Cardinal
was only down 9-7. Unfortu
nately, that was as close as the No.
3-ranked Stanford was to get, as
Cal managed to run out the clock
and score two more goals.
Other than this scoring burst
and the early goals, Stanford's
offense, which was averaging
nearly 12 goals over the last nine
games, never really got in synch.
In fact, this was only the fourth
time all year the team has not
scored 10 goals. As Dettamanti
said, "Our front-court offense was
not effective, and we didn't take
nearly enough shots."
Other than Stanford's own
mistakes, what really did the Car
dinal in was Humbert. The 6-
foot-6 inch junior scored a whop
ping six times in the game and
showed why he led the U.S.
National Team in scoring at the
recently-held Goodwill Games. As
Dettamanti said, "Humbert is the
best collegiate player in the coun
try, and he just did a great job out
there."
Despite the loss, the Cardinal
know the season is hardly over.
"We have a lot of games left," Det
tamanti said. "We have to see
some improvement, and now, we
know what we have to improve
on."
