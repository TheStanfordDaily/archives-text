# Stanford places well at cross country meet
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
The Cardinal cross country team,
which hosted the Stanford/Holiday Invi
tational Saturday, sure picked some
tough customers to put on its guest list.
Among what had been referred to as
"the strongest, field of any cross country
meet in the country," the Stanford
women took 12th place. The men fought
off most of their disi rict rivals to capture
a strong fourth in the race.
"We did very well," men's coach Scott
Chisam said of the race. "The fact that
we were able to run with all of those
excellent teams there, I have to say that
I'm extremely pleased with the results."
The men were defeated by only
Arkansas, Pacific 10 Conference rival
Arizona, and Wake Forest in the race.
Junior Fred Carter, who ran second
on the team with a 24:58 for the eight
kilometer course, agreed with Chisam's
assessment. However, he felt that the
team will have to do even better if Stan
ford expects to compete in the Pac-10
Championships and NCAA District-8
meet.
"Obviously, we are really happy with
how the scoring worked out," Carter
said. "Wake Forest, the third-place team
in the meet, is ranked No. 5 in the
nation. But, we're going to have to run
faster if we're going to do well later in
the year."

Men fourth, women 12th

at Stanford Invitational

Should Stanford continue racing
well, it has an excellent chance of quali
fying for the NCAA Championships.
The men were led by Jason Martin,
who finished 14th overall with a time of
24:37. Carter, Dave Scudamore, Gary
Stolz and Chris Rae rounded out the five
scorers for the Stanford men.
The women, led by senior Melanie
Bloch and sophomores Jill Shenkel and
Ashley Black, were praised equally by
Chisam, who coached the team last year.
"The women ran very well in that they
were able to run with the leaders of the
field for most of the race," he said.
"Brooks (Johnson, the women's coach)
asked a lot of the team, and they met the
challenge."
Bloch, who ran a 17:30 over five kilo
meters, Shenkel (18:02), Black (18:24),
Amy Ewing (18:33) and Alexa Lange
(18:42) were the top five Cardinal finish
ers.
"If our top five can all run under or
about 18, then the women will be able to
compete with anyone in the conference,
or, for that matter, the nation," Chisam
said. "The fact that our fifth woman ran
so well shows how close we are."
