After a year with a 7.1 earthquake,
large budget cuts and a visit by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, Stanford
received second place in the latest U.S.
News and World Report ranking of
"America's Best College."
Top-ranked Harvard beat out Stan
ford by only a tenth of a point, with a
score of 100 to 99.9.
Still, Stanford's 1990 ranking repre
sents a noted jump from last year's
mark of sixth place after Yale and sev
eral other top schools.
The rankings were based on the
responses to questionnaires of college
presidents, deans and admissions direc

tors, as well as objective factors such as
financial resources and ability to retain
students.
The report cited Harvard's "world
class faculty" and "nation's choosiest
admissions office" in selecting it as num
ber one.
Although a few students complained
about being second only to Harvard,
most downplayed the rankings* signifi
cance. "I don't really pay attention to
the rankings. I'm not sure what [they]
reveal," said Council of Presidents mem
ber Goodwin Liu.
Other students pointed to lighter
issues as evidence of the school's suc
cess. "I think Stanford is getting better,"
said sophomore Gary Stoltz. "Just look
at our football team."
