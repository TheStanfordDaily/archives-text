# Three-time defending NCAA champs net season-opening win over Irish
## 
### Peter J. Blum 
It could have been the flip-side of the
weekend.
Just as the Cardinal football team
upset No. 1 Notre Dame on Saturday,
the Fighting Irish tennis team had its
opportunity to stun the three-time
defending NCAA champion men's ten
nis team.
But Friday's contest was not so.
Entering the match with only two
days of practice under their belts, the
Cardinal men turned up the volume,
trouncing the young Irish team 8-1.
Although the match was not much of
a contest, a few matchups were of con
siderable interest:
•Making their NCAA debuts before a
clamoring crowd of nearly 1,000 specta
tors, freshmen singles players Chris
Cocotos and Vimal Patel led the Cardi
nal in the early going with two confident
victories.
•In what proved to be the clutch sin
gles performance, junior Alex O'Brien
fought of his tenacious No. 1 counter
part Dave Dilucia, 7-5, 6-3.
•The sophomore doubles duo of
Jonathan Stark and Jared Palmer fell at
the hands of Dilucia and Chuck Cole
man 7-6, 6-7, 5-7.
Patel, playing at the No. 6 singles
slot, defeated Ryan Lee 6-2, 6-3 to notch
the first Cardinal victory, and was soon
followed by the No. 4 Cocotos who in
turn shut down Ron Rossas 6-3, 6-4.

Patel's "controlled game plan with very
few unforced errors" and by Cocotos's
"feel for the match" as he "applied the
pressure when it was needed."
As Gould said, "Vimal and Chris gave
us a 2-0 lead which really lifted us. You
never know what freshmen will do in
their first matches and especially on a
quick indoor surface in front of so many
fans."
O'Brien, the seventh-ranked player
in the nation, had the No. 11 Dilucia
with his back against the wall, but could
not put on the shackles until it was
almost too late.
Serving at 4-1 in the first set, O'Brien
lost his service game and in no time was
down 5-4 with Dilucia serving for the
set.
At this point O'Brien said that "it
was like playing in a Davis Cup tie. The
crowd was trying to get into my kitchen,
but I thrived on it."
He subsequently broke Dilucia twice
en route to a 7-5 first set victory and a
tight 6-3 second set.
The real surprise of the affair was the
No. 1 doubles matchup between the
Cardinal's combo of Stark and Palmer
against Dilucia and Coleman.

The No. 1-ranked Stark/Palmer
immediately embroiled themselves in,
as Gould said, "a dogfight."
Winning the first set 7-6, the two
continued to a 5-3 lead in the second
with Stark serving for the match. But
the No. 14-ranked tandem of Dilucia
and Coleman averted a Stanford sweep
as they bounced back to win 6-7, 7-6, 7-
5.
At No. 2 singles, Palmer defeated
Coleman 6-2,6-4; senior Glenn Solomon
dropped the first three games butcame
back to top Mark Schmidt 6-4, 6-2 at
No. 3; and at No. 5 singles, senior Jason
Yee became the only Cardinal to drop a
set and prevail. Down a break in the
third set, Yee battled back to edge
Tommy North 7-5, 1-6, 7-5 in a three
hour marathon match.
In doubles, the Ail-American team of
O'Brien and Yee set down their Irish
adversaries 6-4, 6-4 at No. 2 while Coco
tos teamed up with yet another fresh
man, Michael Flanagan, to win 6-3, 7-5
at No. 3.
And so the Cardinal has kicked off
another season.
But this preseason match allowed
them to be a part of history — the tennis
team spent Saturday afternoon at Notre
Dame Stadium.
As Solomon said, "People were
stunned and we were going psycho."
Final score: Stanford 36-31, with an
8-1 slaughter as an appetizer.
