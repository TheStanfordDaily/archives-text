# Card men swimmers clobber Notre Dame

### Swaminatha Gurudevan 
As an impressive complement
to Cardinal football team's spec
tacular upset victory over the
Fighting Irish, the Stanford
men's swimming team was
extremely successful Friday, deci
sively defeating Notre Dame by a
score of 117-80. At one point, the
Cardinal led 117-33, so to prevent
the score from becoming any more
lopsided than it was, Stanford
entered all of its swimmers in the
last three events unofficially,
allowing the Fighting Irish swim
mers to accumulate 47 more
points.
The meet was insignificant in
terms of NCAA championship
implications, and was designed as
a way for Notre Dame swimmers
and Stanford freshmen swimmers
to gain valuable college swimming
experience.
Eddie Parenti, a freshman
from Ottawa, Canada won the 200
freestyle and the 200 butterfly,
posting times of 1:41.54 in the
freestyle and 1:54.38 in the but
terfly. After the meet, Parenti
remarked, "It was my first real
meet; I was just getting an idea of
the competitive timing of NCAA
meets.
"The whole team worked
together, and [the meet] showed
that we're a really close-knit
team." In the 200 butterfly, Par

Rouse and Andy Lloyd, who were
both Ail-Americans last year.
Rouse swam in several races
other than his traditional back
stroke events, such as the 200
butterfly, the 400 freestyle relay,
and the 400 medley relay. He
posted times of 2:00.52 (third
place) in the 200 butterfly, and his
team finished first in the freestyle
relay and second in the medley
relay.
In the 200 backstroke, Rouse
finished second with a time of
1:53.80. After the meet, Rouse
said, "It was a really positive expe
rience. The team came together
really well and the freshmen
swam well.
"Our small squad size allows us
to get closer, and know each other
better. A smaller team is more
focused on what it wants to do."
Lloyd swam in the 1,000
freestyle, the 200 butterfly, and
the 500 freestyle, posting times of
9:50.74 (second place), 2:03.86
(fifth place), and 4:51.65 (third
place), respectively. "This meet
really helped the team since the
freshmen swam really well,"
Lloyd said. "It gave them some
early season racing experience."
