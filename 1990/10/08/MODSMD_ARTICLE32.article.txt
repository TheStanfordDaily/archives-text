# Women swimmers easily beat Irish
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Going into a new season, a
coach usually has a little bit of
doubt. He can never be sure
how well his team is going to
start the new season, how his
returning athletes will be or
how the incoming freshmen
will perform at the collegiate
level. It is especially tricky
when your team opens the sea
son after only a week of prac
tice.
All of that reasoning went
out the window pretty quickly
for Richard Quick Friday. Com
peting in a dual meet at Notre
Dame, Quick's Cardinal swim
team opened up an early 111.5-
38-5 lead and coasted home for
an easy win over the Irish.
The final score of 111.5-85.5
was deceptive as all of Stan
ford's swimmers in the last
three events competed on an
unofficial basis. If not for that
act of compassion, the score
would have been much more
indicative of Stanford's domi
nation.
Senior Michelle Griglione
won a pair of events for the
Cardinal and six other Stan
ford swimmers posted wins in
the meet. The outcome seemed
obvious after the first event,
the 400-yard medley relay.
Dede Trimble, Lori Heisick,
Summer Sanders and Suzy
Buckovich won the event, fol
lowed closely by the Stanford B
team. Jody Smith, J.T. Toton,
Pam Minthorn and Susan
Johnson finished four seconds
behind the A team, but still
were more than nine seconds
ahead of the top Irish quartet.
The meet was the first colle
giate competition for freshmen
Sanders and Minthorn, two of
the nation's top recruits last
year. "Actually I was a little
nervous before I swam,"
Sanders said. Maybe the nerves
helped as she later won the 200
individual medley. Her class
mate Minthorn placed second

in that event.
Griglione, one of the few
Cardinal swimmers who didn't
train here with Quick over the
summer, showed the form that
made her the Cardinal's top
point-scorer at the 1989 NCAA
Championships. Friday she
won the 200 freestyle and the
100 freestyle ahead of her
teammates. Barb Metz took
second and Smith grabbed
third in the 200 while Johnson
was the runner-up in the 100.
Stanford also swept the
1,000 freestyle as sophomores
Janet Evans and Katherine
Comanor and junior Eva
Mortensen left the Notre Dame
swimmers behind. Evans' and
Comanor's classmates did their
share in the win as well. Janel
Jorgensen, still regaining her
strength after a bout with
mononucleosis over the sum
mer, edged Suzy Buckovich in
the 50 freestyle and Lori
Heisick placed fourth in that
event before winning the 200
breaststroke in an unofficial
capacity.
Trimble, Sanders and Smith
swept the Irish in the 200 back
stroke and Minthorn and Metz,
both swimming unofficially,
went one-two in the 500
freestyle.
Griglione, Evans, Morten
sen and Metz ended the meet
by racing to victory in the 400
freestyle relay.
"I think we did pretty well
considering we were so broken
down from working so hard,"
Sanders said. "I think we did
well all things considered. ... I
was happy with my times."
