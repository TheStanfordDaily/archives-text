# Netters sweep past No. 25 Notre Dame
## 
### Gretchen Atwood 
Freshman Emma Woodhouse
called it, "probably the greatest
moment of the trip."
"It was so amazing," according
to senior Debbie Graham.
Stanford assistant women's
tennis coach Lele Forood had,
"such a good time." What they
were referring to was the Stan
ford-Notre Dame football game
last Saturday.
The Stanford players stayed in
Notre Dame dorms after their
match against the Irish Friday.
The stay included a campus tour,
tickets for the game, and experi
encing Notre Dame on the day of a
home football game. "The whole
campus goes wild before a football
game . . . really different than
Stanford," said Graham.
"It was just fun," Graham said.
The Cardinal netters certainly
started the weekend well by
whitewashing the Irish 9-0 on Fri
day. Defending national singles
champion Debbie Graham started
with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Tracy
Barton. Graham said she was,
"kind of nervous about playing
No. 1," but used her patience and
potent net game to defeat Barton.
"I've never played anyone who hit
the ball so hard," said Graham.
Forood was also impressed by
Barton's play. "Debbie's opponent
played exceptionally well."
Teri Whitlinger defeated
Christy Faustmann in the No. 2
singles match. Teri was, "domi
nating like usual," according to
Forood.
At No. 3, freshman Laxmi

Poruri debuted for the Cardinal.
She began her Stanford career
with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Terri
Vitale.
Sophomore Heather Willens
won at No. 4, crushing Lisa
Tholen 6-2,6-0. "Heather was like
a wrecking crew," Forood said.
Notre Dame's Kim Pacella gave
sophomore Mario Carruth some
trouble early but Carruth won a
lot of big points to pull out the vic
tory in straight sets 7-5, 6-4.
"Impressive in her first college
match," is how Forood described
freshman Emma Woodhouse's
play. The freshman defeated
Kristy Doran 6-1, 6-4 at No. 6.
In doubles the Cardinal contin
ued its domination of the Irish,
taking all three matches.
Whitlinger and Poruri teamed up
at No. 1 doubles and decimated
Barton and Faustmann 6-1, 6-2.
At No. 2 Willens and Carruth
defeated Vitale and Tholen 7-5, 6-
3. The No. 3 doubles match pro
vided the closest match of the day.
Afler splitting the first two sets
2-6 and 6-3 with Doran and Katie
Clark, the pair of Woodhouse and
Carina Rolley found themselves
down 1-5 in the third set. Accord
ing to Forood they believed they
would pull out the match. And
win they eventually did, after
being down "at least 10 match
points," according to Forood.


Debbie Graham, the 1989 NCAA singles champ, showed she didn't
lose anything over the summer by posting an easy win at No. 1
singles Friday. Stanford defeated Notre Dame 9-0.
