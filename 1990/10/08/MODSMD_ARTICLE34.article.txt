## 
### George Malone 
The Stanford men's golf team
made a definitive statement this
weekend that it is a force to be
wary of in men's collegiate golf.
Led by an outstanding debut
from freshman Notah Begay, the
team was tied for first place after
the first two rounds and finished
in a solid third in the Coca-Cola
Classic Tournament in Las
Cruces, N.M. The Cardinal would
have placed higher but for a
remarkable sub-par final round by

at Coca* Cola Classic

host New Mexico State.
Coach Wally Goodwin called it
a "terrific tournament" in which
Stanford scored a 878, which was
third to New Mexico State's 869
and only one shot behind UC-
Santa Barbara's 877.
Stanford players performed

well in individual terms as well.
The tournament was won by
Derek Gilchrist of UC-Santa Bar
bara who shot an even-par 216,
but Cardinal Begay was only two
shots back at 218. Begay, playing
in his home state of New Mexico,
showed no sign of first-tourney
jitters by shooting a 3-under par
69 for the first round to lead the
tournament.
He finished with rounds of 77
and 72 to lead Stanford's team.
Second-place for the Cardinal was
sophomore Brad Lanning who

shot 71-73-76 for a total of 220.
Tied at 222 for third place for
Stanford were junior captain
Christian Cevaer, shooting 75-72-
75, and sophomore Mike Milliken
with a consistent 74-74-74.
Goodwin was extremely
pleased with the team's perfor
mance, saying, "It was a really
terrific first outing for us. I was
really happy that the freshman
played well on the last day, which
is always the toughest day. We did
well."
