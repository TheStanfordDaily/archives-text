The American Indian Dance
Theater presented a variety of tra
ditional and Native
American dances in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium yesterday afternoon
to a crowd of about 250 people.
The performance continued
the week-long celebration of the
Stanford American Indian Orga
nization's 20th anniversary.
The troupe consists of about 20
dancers of ail ages representing
various tribes, including Navaho,
Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche, Ara
paho and several others. Its pur
pose is to bring American Indian
culture to outside communities.
The ceremony opened with a
prayer in the Zuni language led by
the group's elder.
The dancers wore self-made
costumes of colorful, intricate
beadwork and eagle feathers, each
with a tribal and a religious signif
icance. Each dancer had his or her
own style of costume and dance.
Highlights of the program
included the Grass Dance, which
is normally danced in a circle. But
for the benefit of the audience, the
troupe performed it in a line.
Other dances, such as the
Ladies' Fancy Dance and the
Men's Fancy Dance were fast
paced and exciting to watch. The
group also presented a Drum Call,
where two male dancers competed
with each other on separate hand
held drums, creating a rhythmic
drum piece.

The dancers' rhythms were
supported by a drum and bells
they wore around their ankles.
Throughout the show, members of
the troupe would call out in sup
port of the dancers who were per
forming. Some dances were
accompanied by songs performed
by a few of the men in the group.
At the end of the performance,
the audience was invited to partic
ipate in a Round Dance with the
troupe. Several members of the
audience joined in enthusiasti
cally.
The presentation was followed
by a question-and-answer period,
in which dancers discussed how
the group chooses its members.
The troupe's producer recruits
new dancers from dances per
formed at powwows, including the
annual Stanford Powwow. Those
interested in the troupe may also
audition.
The group tours for six to eight
months each year and has trav
eled to many different parts of the
world. It is currently in the midst
of an eight-week tour which
includes Alaska, Los Angeles, Ari
zona, Texas, and will end in Min
nesota.
The dancers also performed at
the Gathering of the Tribes coo
cert Saturday at the Shore Line
Amphitheater in Mountain View.
They will dance tonight 8 p.m. at
the Pacific Auditorium in Santa
Cruz and will appear on MTV next
week.
