# Domestic partners policy pending
## Students expect Kennedy to issue a decision this week 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Students working for a policy
which would extend spouse
privileges to domestic partners
of gay and lesbian students
expect a decision from Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
this week.
The students expect the issue
to be raised when Kennedy
meets with the Board of
Trustees today and tomorrow.
However, the Trustees are not
scheduled to vote on it, accord
ing to Bob Hamrdla, assistant to
the president. Kennedy declined
to comment on the proposal.
The proposed policy would
give domestic partners access to
married student housing and
the ability to receive medical
care at Cowell Student Health
Center. In addition, a "courtesy
card," formerly known as a
"spouse card," would allow
them access to University facili
ties such as libraries, pools and
weight rooms.
If implemented, it would be

the first broad-based university
domestic partners policy in the
country, according to graduate
student David Bradfute, a mem
ber of the ad hoc committee for
domestic partner benefits.
Columbia Teacher's College
this summer passed a domestic
partners policy which applies
only to housing. In that policy,
students with children are given
first priority; gay and lesbian
couples and married students
are considered to be on equal
footing when applying for cou
ples' housing.
At Stanford, several gay and
lesbian couples have success
fully petitioned to live in one
bedroom units in Escondido Vil
lage.
The proposed policy — which
would make such arrangements
possible on a systematic rather
than case-by-case basis — has
undergone eight or nine revi
sions since students first raised
the issue last year.
A version submitted to the
Administrative Council in May
said married students and those

who "are practicably unable to
marry but are in an established
long-term domestic partnership
with a mutual commitment sim
ilar to that of marriage" would
be eligible for couples' housing.
The Administrative Council
made several changes, notably
the inclusion of heterosexual
domestic partners. Also, a "jus
tification" section of the earlier
version, including a restatement
of Stanford's nondiscrimination
policy with regard to sexual ori
entation, was eliminated.
This version is now before
Kennedy and the Trustees,
although the final decision rests
with Kennedy
The University will not
require proof of a long-term
relationship for eligibility.
According to the latest version
of the policy, "As in all matters
at Stanford, students are
trusted to be truthful, unless
there is cause for doubt in par
ticular cases."
Like all graduate student
housing, couples' housing is
allocated on a lottery basis.
