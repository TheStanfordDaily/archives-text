# Res Ed to RAs:
## Don't buy alcohol for those under 21 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
When James Lyons, then Dean
of Student Affairs, suggested in
January that the University pro
hibit the use of dorm funds to buy
alcohol, opposition to the proposal
was so vehement that it was
dropped.
But now, in the wake of a new
University policy prohibiting
underage drinking, the Office of
Residential Education suggested
Friday that such a ban should be
implemented, at least temporar
ily..
Under a new federal law, Stan
ford must prohibit the unlawful
use of alcohol and other drugs to
continue receiving government
funds. But the new University
policy has left many residence
staff members confused as to how,
or if, they should enforce it.
In an attempt to give interim
guidelines to RAs and RFs until
the University decides how to
enforce and implement its policy,
acting Director of Residential
Education Robin Hensley sug
gested in a memo Friday that RAs
and RFs not allow the use of dorm
funds to purchase alcohol or pur
chase alcohol themselves for resi
dents under 21.
Hensley said when RFs met

with administrators Thursday to
discuss the implications of the
new policy, many asked for guide
lines for handling alcohol in the
residences.
The two suggestions in the
memo reflect "the two areas of
strongest concern [among RFs] in
terms of liability," Hensley said.
When asked if the guidelines
would officially become part of the
University's alcohol policy, Hens
ley said, "We don't know."
She said administrators are
waiting until they meet with RAs
and RFs "and work together as a
community" to decide how to
implement and enforce the alco
hol policy.
The suggested guidelines "are
not putting RAs in an enforce
ment role," Hensley noted.
Some houses have already
altered their individual alcohol
policies in response to Hensley's
letter. Junior Eric Lassen, an RA
in Alondra House, said RAs there
reversed their initial decision to
purchase alcohol with dorm funds
for a happy hour last Friday after
receiving the memo.
Instead, he said, some mem
bers of the house pooled their own
money to buy a keg of beer.
The end result, according to
