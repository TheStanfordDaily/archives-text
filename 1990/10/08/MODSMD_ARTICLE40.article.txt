# Women of Color and the Law:
## Activist kicks off conference 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
"My uncle used to say, 'Watch
out, you don't want the laws to get
you.' As it turns out ... the laws
did get me," joked Angela Davis in
her keynote speech at the third
national Women of Color and the
Law conference.
Davis, a writer and activist,
spoke in Kresge Auditorium Sat
urday morning, kicking off a two
day conference attended by more
than 600 law students and others
from across the nation.
"I have always found the law to
be one of the most terrifying
dimensions of the social order,"
Davis admitted, adding that she
was honored to be the first non
lawyer to give a keynote address
at the annual conference.
Her talk addressed the lan
guage of law, issues of diversity
and the Supreme Court.
"We need to look at law as ide
ology, as a distorted reflection of
the truth, and ... to move outside
the law in order to form a critical
viewpoint," Davis said. "So some
times you have to leave the
books."

She urged law students who
are women of color to maintain a
critical stance throughout their
professions.
"A woman of color who enters
the law must always resist the
philosophical temptation to locate
herself on the side of the law,
therefore looking askahce at those
who are in a permanently antago
nistic stance with the law," Davis
said.
"The sister who looks at
lawyers as 'liars' may actually
possess very enlightening insights
into the law in our society."
Davis criticized the legal pro
fession's maxim that "all men are
equal before the law," saying,
"Entire communities have been
relegated to the margins of this
putative universality."
She noted how the language of
lawyers and others acts to
marginalize many members of
society, as in the phrase "minority
within a minority" to describe
women of color.
"As a matter of fact, I consider
myself a mtyority within a major
ity," Davis said. "There is a reason
why the term minority has been
thrust at us, and it has nothing to

do with our numbers."
Davis' role in recent American
history is well-established. The
author of numerous books and
articles and a two-time vice presi
dential candidate for the Commu
nist Party U.S.A., she has fought
for African-American liberation
since the 19605.
She was the subject of an
intense FBI hunt in 1970 and was
placed on the Ten Most Wanted
list for her association with the
Black Panthers. She was acquit
ted of all charges after defending
herself in a much publicized trial.
She now teaches women's stud
ies and ethnic studies at San
Francisco State University and in
the San Francisco County Jail.
Her latest book, "Ma Rainey,
Bessie Smith and Billie Holliday:
Black Women's Music and the
Shaping of Social Consciousness,"
is scheduled for publication this
year.
The conference also included
panels of speakers on the politics
of health, the socioeconomic sta
tus of women of color, violence
against women of color and build
ing coalitions.
