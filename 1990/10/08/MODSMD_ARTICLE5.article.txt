Emphasizing its commitment
to teaching and research, Stan
ford continued its Centennial Cel
ebration last weekend by hosting
a symposium on the impact of
"The Information Explosion."
The first of three Centennial
Symposia scheduled for this year,
the event was designed to address
progress in information technol

possible directions for the next
100 years.

The three symposia are the pri

Biological Nature and Social
Opportunities." The final sympo

Environment in an Interdepen

April.

Kennedy said he feared that
different generations might mis
understand each other and
warned against confusing the
style of communication with the
substance of the message.
In his address, Schultz empha
sized that human capacities for
understanding and analysis are
needed to use the possibilities of
new information technology. He
said greater access to information
would lead to faster economic
growth in less developed coun
tries. These countries are
recognizing that they "need this
information if they want to
develop," he added.
Schultz said he also saw the
