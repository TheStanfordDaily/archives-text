# Symposium tackles the information era
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Emphasizing its commitment
to teaching and research, Stan
ford continued its Centennial Cel
ebration last weekend by hosting
a symposium on the impact of
"The Information Explosion."
The first of three Centennial
Symposia scheduled for this year,
the event was designed to address
progress in information technol
ogy in the last century as well as
possible directions for the next
100 years.
Through a series of panel
discussions involving professors,
inventors and experts from vari
ous fields, the symposium
addressed the implications of the
information age — from sociopo
litical, humanistic, economic and
technical perspectives.
The three symposia are the pri
mary intellectual events of the
Centennial Celebration. In Jan
uary, Nobel laureate Paul Berg
will chair the second symposium,
"Beyond the Human Genome:
Biological Nature and Social
Opportunities." The final sympo
sium, "Ethnicity, Equity and the
Environment in an Interdepen
dent World," will take place in
April.
Underneath the majestic ban
ners commemorating the Centen

nial, University President Donald
Kennedy opened the symposium
in Memorial Auditorium. While
introducing the keynote speaker,
Business School Prof, and former
Secretary of State George Schultz,
Kennedy expressed conflicting
feelings about the progress of
communication.
"The world we live in is a stun
ning product of new technology,"
Kennedy said. "Information tech
nology will lead us to interna
tional understanding .. . but also
more babble and misunderstand
• - n
mg.
Kennedy said he feared that
different generations might mis
understand each other and
warned against confusing the
style of communication with the
substance of the message.
In his address, Schultz empha
sized that human capacities for
understanding and analysis are
needed to use the possibilities of
new information technology. He
said greater access to information
would lead to faster economic
growth in less developed coun
tries. These countries are
recognizing that they "need this
information if they want to
develop," he added.
Schultz said he also saw the
areas of finance, science and world
news changing because of the
"information explosion."
The symposium's first panel
discussion, "The New Informa
tion Technology: Changing the
Way We View the News," was
moderated by James Risser, pro
fessor of communication and
director of the Knight Fellowship
for Professional Journalists.
Risser and the panel guests, all
of whom had backgrounds in jour
nalism, discussed the effects new
technology would have on the con
tinuing importance of newspa
pers, television and other media.
While the opening panel grap
pled with the high speed of mod
ern communication, Saturday's
first panel, "The Creative Process:
New Tools, New Ideas", discussed
the often sluggish pace of techno
logical change.
"Change is not just slow, but
slow in getting started," said Paul
Saffo, Research Fellow at the
Institute for the Future. Saffo
said although society strives for
rapid advancement in technology,
change often takes many detours.
Other panelists, however,
asserted that new tools have
expanded options for creativity.
John Chowning, professor of
music and Director of the Center
for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics at Stanford Univer
sity, discussed current research
aimed at expressing art through a
combination of electronic music
and vocals.
A demonstration of this
research combined an electronic
instrument, the "radio baton,"
played by Music Prof. Max
Matthews with an opera excerpt
sung by Maureen Chowning. "If
we have made music easier to
play," Matthews asked, "is it a
good thing? For amateur music
players, it may be a great thing."
The next panel discussion,
"Markets, Trade and the Econ
omy: How Soon Do We Want to
Know?", explored the problems of
gaining financial information
through technology. Moderated by
Nobel Laureate and Economics
Professor Kenneth Arrow, the
panel included Stanford Assoc.
Law Prof. Joseph Grundfest and
Harvard Economics Prof.
Lawrence Summers.
This panel's primary debate
concerned the possibility of a

transaction tax on stock trading,
which has sharply increased in
volume because of the informa
tion explosion. Summers, who
advised Michael Dukakis during
the 1988 presidential campaign,
argued in favor of the tax, stating
it would control the market's
volatile nature.
However, Grundfest rebuked
Summers' theory, saying a trans
action tax would prove burden
some for all traders. "After listen
ing to Professor Summers,"
Grundfest said, "it's easy to know
why Massachusetts is in so much
trouble." However, both panelists
agreed that information will con
tinue to have profound effects
upon the world's economic mar
kets for the next century.
Fax machines may be a modern
convenience for many, but at Sat
urday's final panel Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute Prof. Lang
don Winner said he felt the fax
was merely one of a "bombard
ment of interruptions." Winner
criticized some products of tech
nology in"The Ideology of Infor
mation: At What Cost New Tech
nology?", which addressed the
interactions of information, tech
nology and society.
"While information machines
are getting smarter and smarter,
much of the human population
seems to be moving in the oppo
site direction," Winner said. He
blamed technological advances for
the deterioration of human intel
lect. "People are more concerned
about what Vanna White is wear
ing than information directly per
tinent to their daily lives," Winner
said.
However, Douglas Engelbart,
inventor of the computer
"mouse," stressed the importance
of shared information via a net
work of computers. In his speech,
Engelbart praised the value of
technology, stressing that comput
ers augment the capabilities of
both organizations and individu
als.
Sunday's panel series began
with "In the Information Age:
Crossing New Frontiers in Sci
ence and Medicine," moderated by
Joel Shurkin, science writer for
the Stanford News Service.
Shurkin captured the theme of
the panel discussion by crediting
the computer as a tool which
makes humans "look at the world
an entirely different way."
Medical School Prof. Edward
Shortliffe said computers perform
a variety of diverse functions,

'While information
machines are getting
smarter and smarter,
much of the human
population seems to
be moving in the
opposite direction.'

including disclosing specific
patients' medical history to physi
cians and assisting with the pro
cess of diagnosis and treatment
selection.
Oleg Jardetzky, director of the
Stanford Magnetic Resonance
Laboratory, also extolled the
virtues of computers, citing their
assistance in the study of chemical
compounds within the human
body.
"[Computers produce] very
good resolution of the images of
the internal parts of the human
body," Jardetsky said. However,
only the humap brain has the
capability to deal with the most
complex and sophisticated prob
lems, he said.
The symposium closed with a
keynote address from Arrow, one
of the primary organizers of the
three-day event. His speech con
centrated on the history, nature,
efficiency and consequences of the
information explosion.
"Information has the potential
to change one's view of the
world," Arrow said.
However, he said computers
cannot assume humans' intrinsic
part of the information loop.
Arrow also noted information
could increase inequalities in the
world if used improperly, as the
few people skilled in communica
tional areas will have enormous
power over others.
Arrow ended by addressing the
link between information explo
sion and global economies. "As we
absorb information," Arrow said,
"we will be reaping the economic
benefits as we are already reaping
the political benefits."
According to Arrow, individu
als, organizations and countries
must be prepared for the rapid
transformation the "information
explosion" is bound to produce.

Emphasizing its commitment
to teaching and research, Stan
ford continued its Centennial Cel
ebration last weekend by hosting
a symposium on the impact of
"The Information Explosion."
The first of three Centennial
Symposia scheduled for this year,
the event was designed to address
progress in information technol
ogy in the last century as well as
possible directions for the next
100 years.
Through a series of panel
discussions involving professors,
inventors and experts from vari
ous fields, the symposium
addressed the implications of the
information age — from sociopo
litical, humanistic, economic and
technical perspectives.
The three symposia are the pri
mary intellectual events of the
Centennial Celebration. In Jan
uary, Nobel laureate Paul Berg
will chair the second symposium,
"Beyond the Human Genome:
Biological Nature and Social
Opportunities." The final sympo
sium, "Ethnicity, Equity and the
Environment in an Interdepen
dent World," will take place in
April.
Underneath the majestic ban
ners commemorating the Centen

nial, University President Donald
Kennedy opened the symposium
in Memorial Auditorium. While
introducing the keynote speaker,
Business School Prof, and former
Secretary of State George Schultz,
Kennedy expressed conflicting
feelings about the progress of
communication.
"The world we live in is a stun
ning product of new technology,"
Kennedy said. "Information tech
nology will lead us to interna
tional understanding .. . but also
more babble and misunderstand
• - n
mg.
Kennedy said he feared that
different generations might mis
understand each other and
warned against confusing the
style of communication with the
substance of the message.
In his address, Schultz empha
sized that human capacities for
understanding and analysis are
needed to use the possibilities of
new information technology. He
said greater access to information
would lead to faster economic
growth in less developed coun
tries. These countries are
recognizing that they "need this
information if they want to
develop," he added.
Schultz said he also saw the
areas of finance, science and world
news changing because of the
"information explosion."
The symposium's first panel
discussion, "The New Informa
tion Technology: Changing the
Way We View the News," was
moderated by James Risser, pro
fessor of communication and
director of the Knight Fellowship
for Professional Journalists.
Risser and the panel guests, all
of whom had backgrounds in jour
nalism, discussed the effects new
technology would have on the con
tinuing importance of newspa
pers, television and other media.
While the opening panel grap
pled with the high speed of mod
ern communication, Saturday's
first panel, "The Creative Process:
New Tools, New Ideas", discussed
the often sluggish pace of techno
logical change.
"Change is not just slow, but
slow in getting started," said Paul
Saffo, Research Fellow at the
Institute for the Future. Saffo
said although society strives for
rapid advancement in technology,
change often takes many detours.
Other panelists, however,
asserted that new tools have
expanded options for creativity.
John Chowning, professor of
music and Director of the Center
for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics at Stanford Univer
sity, discussed current research
aimed at expressing art through a
combination of electronic music
and vocals.
A demonstration of this
research combined an electronic
instrument, the "radio baton,"
played by Music Prof. Max
Matthews with an opera excerpt
sung by Maureen Chowning. "If
we have made music easier to
play," Matthews asked, "is it a
good thing? For amateur music
players, it may be a great thing."
The next panel discussion,
"Markets, Trade and the Econ
omy: How Soon Do We Want to
Know?", explored the problems of
gaining financial information
through technology. Moderated by
Nobel Laureate and Economics
Professor Kenneth Arrow, the
panel included Stanford Assoc.
Law Prof. Joseph Grundfest and
Harvard Economics Prof.
Lawrence Summers.
This panel's primary debate
concerned the possibility of a

transaction tax on stock trading,
which has sharply increased in
volume because of the informa
tion explosion. Summers, who
advised Michael Dukakis during
the 1988 presidential campaign,
argued in favor of the tax, stating
it would control the market's
volatile nature.
However, Grundfest rebuked
Summers' theory, saying a trans
action tax would prove burden
some for all traders. "After listen
ing to Professor Summers,"
Grundfest said, "it's easy to know
why Massachusetts is in so much
trouble." However, both panelists
agreed that information will con
tinue to have profound effects
upon the world's economic mar
kets for the next century.
Fax machines may be a modern
convenience for many, but at Sat
urday's final panel Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute Prof. Lang
don Winner said he felt the fax
was merely one of a "bombard
ment of interruptions." Winner
criticized some products of tech
nology in"The Ideology of Infor
mation: At What Cost New Tech
nology?", which addressed the
interactions of information, tech
nology and society.
"While information machines
are getting smarter and smarter,
much of the human population
seems to be moving in the oppo
site direction," Winner said. He
blamed technological advances for
the deterioration of human intel
lect. "People are more concerned
about what Vanna White is wear
ing than information directly per
tinent to their daily lives," Winner
said.
However, Douglas Engelbart,
inventor of the computer
"mouse," stressed the importance
of shared information via a net
work of computers. In his speech,
Engelbart praised the value of
technology, stressing that comput
ers augment the capabilities of
both organizations and individu
als.
Sunday's panel series began
with "In the Information Age:
Crossing New Frontiers in Sci
ence and Medicine," moderated by
Joel Shurkin, science writer for
the Stanford News Service.
Shurkin captured the theme of
the panel discussion by crediting
the computer as a tool which
makes humans "look at the world
an entirely different way."
Medical School Prof. Edward
Shortliffe said computers perform
a variety of diverse functions,

'While information
machines are getting
smarter and smarter,
much of the human
population seems to
be moving in the
opposite direction.'

including disclosing specific
patients' medical history to physi
cians and assisting with the pro
cess of diagnosis and treatment
selection.
Oleg Jardetzky, director of the
Stanford Magnetic Resonance
Laboratory, also extolled the
virtues of computers, citing their
assistance in the study of chemical
compounds within the human
body.
"[Computers produce] very
good resolution of the images of
the internal parts of the human
body," Jardetsky said. However,
only the humap brain has the
capability to deal with the most
complex and sophisticated prob
lems, he said.
The symposium closed with a
keynote address from Arrow, one
of the primary organizers of the
three-day event. His speech con
centrated on the history, nature,
efficiency and consequences of the
information explosion.
"Information has the potential
to change one's view of the
world," Arrow said.
However, he said computers
cannot assume humans' intrinsic
part of the information loop.
Arrow also noted information
could increase inequalities in the
world if used improperly, as the
few people skilled in communica
tional areas will have enormous
power over others.
Arrow ended by addressing the
link between information explo
sion and global economies. "As we
absorb information," Arrow said,
"we will be reaping the economic
benefits as we are already reaping
the political benefits."
According to Arrow, individu
als, organizations and countries
must be prepared for the rapid
transformation the "information
explosion" is bound to produce.
