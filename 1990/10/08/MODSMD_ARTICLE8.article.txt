# Panel discusses technology's effect on news
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff 
Last weekend's Centennial
Symposium on the "Information
Explosion" opened with a discus
sion of the relationship between
emerging information technology
and news gathering and publish
ing.
According to the media experts
at the panel discussion, entitled
"The New Information Technol
ogy: Changing the Way We View
the News", technology and the
changing structure of the global
society will drastically alter news
coverage in the future.
This symposium, moderated by
Communication Prof. James
Risser, consisted of speeches by
the several experts — Stewart
Brand, author of the books "The
Media Lab" and"The Whole
Earth Catalog;" Stuart Loory, vice
president and editor-in-chief of
Cable News Network's "World
News Report;" Andrew Nibley,
editor of Reuters America, part of
an international wire news ser
vice; E Anthony Ridder, president
of Knight-Ridder, Inc., which
owns 28 daily newspapers and
Jean Gaddy Wilson, executive
director of New Directions for
News, a media think tank at the
University of Missouri.
Each speaker was allotted 15
minutes to discuss the impact of
computer and satellite technology
on the news media and the world,
or to "blindly predict what is to
come," Nibley said. The speakers
focused on a different aspect of
the issue.

Loory, the first speaker,
recounted the development of
CNN's four-year old "World News
Report," a daily half-hour show
which broadcasts news programs
from non-American and non-
British news organizations.
He said the broadcast allows
for more comprehensive coverage
of the world's events and hailed
its potential to "help further the
growth of understanding."
In response to early criticism
that the segment would become a
vehicle for the world's propagan
dists, Loory said, "The program
has not exactly worked out that
way."
In his speech, Ridder asserted
"newspapers are not dinosaurs"
in the face of new information
technology — they are still
"healthy, ... profitable" ventures
and can remain so in the future.
He presented statistics to dis
prove the notion that U.S. citizens
no longer read newspapers. Rid
der said 88 percent of the popula
tion read them at least occasion
ally in 1990 — only a slight
decline from the 91 percent who
read them daily in 1967.
Outlining the future of the
mass media, Ridder predicted that
by the year 2010, new technology
will afford computer and televi
sion news sources high-resolution
text and portability equal to news
papers today.
However, newspapers, perhaps
in electronic form, "will remain
the most important distributor of
news (and) entertainment ... for
at least 100 years," Ridder noted.
One way for them to survive is by

focusing on local coverage and
local markets, he said.
Nibley, a business journalist,
talked about the "somewhat
incestuous" relationship among
the government, the press and big
business that has developed from
instantaneous communication of
economic indicators.
"Speed has its risks," he
warned, because unscrupulous
traders can illegally access eco
nomic information through com
puters faster than government
regulators or the press can track
them.
Nibley said business journalists
of the future will have to be
extremely keen to market trends
for their stories to be beneficial to
individual investors, who will
demand prompt and sophisticated
advice.
Continuing on the theme of
newspapers in the future, Wilson
said the mission of her think tank
is "to reinvent newspapers,"
which are at a crossroads between
technological advances and reader
disinterest.
She showed videotaped inter
views with average citizens who
suffer from "time poverty," or lack
of free time, and thus do not
peruse papers.
Brand, the final speaker,
argued that other forms of mass
media play an active role in soci
ety.
He cited as an example a Bay
Area computer bulletin board he
established because its users com
ment on the news so frequently.
"This is news alive," he said.
