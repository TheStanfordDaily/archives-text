# Media watchdog:
## Mideast news is biased 
### Alex Hoye Staff writer 
Media watchdog Larry Bensky barked a
warning to the American public last night
in Kresge Auditorium, charging the press
with an inaccurate and biased presentation
of international news.
The media presents "what they want
you to think is going on, rather than what
really is going on," he said to a small crowd
in Kresge Auditorium.
Bensky, national affairs correspondent
for Pacifica Radio, unleashed his sarcastic
wit on the media establishment in his pre
sentation "Words in the Sand: The Media in
the Middle East." His keynote speech
capped an all-day Middle East Teach-in
that was intended to raise awareness of cur
rent developments in the Persian Gulf cri
sis.
Bensky accused journalists of pandering
to White House policy, charging that
reporters who risk being caught "out of
step with the White House lose their
access" to breaking news.
He said "60 Minutes," the nation's most
popular news and documentary program,
promulgated "pure propaganda." In last
Sunday's presentation of "Terror and Tor
ture: The Story of Saddam Hussein's
Regime in the Middle East," the popular

"info-tainment" series interviewed Iraqi
exiles arbitrarily and, more importantly,
asked the wrong questions, he accused.
Instead of asking why the western press
ignored reports of torture, arbitrary arrest,
sexual harassment and political persecu
tion undertaken by the Iraqi government
until now, Bensky said the news program
should have delved deeper into why the U.S.
government gave as much as $1 billion in
official aid to Iraq in 1986, while fully
aware of Saddam's atrocious policies.
Bensky then charged magazines like
Time and Newsweek with focusing on
"head-scratching" human interest stories
about "G.I. Joes and now G.I. Jills" eating
C-rations in the desert, instead of larger
questions such as the legitimacy of U.S. mil
itary presence in the region.
He also chided the publications for
extensive use of unattributed and unac-

countable sources like "a high
level State Department official"
in their stories.
Bensky cited several cases
where media giants appeared to
overwhelmingly support presi
dential policy, including a Time
segment that labeled a French
proposed diplomatic solution as a
"worrisome threat." He further
alleged that French President
Frangois Mitterand's four-stage
peace plan never hit the U.S.
press because it would be detri
mental to official policy.
Critical readers can delve
deeper than the popular media on
issues that interest them by using
sources like Amnesty Interna
tional and his own service, Paci
fica Radio, Bensky said.
Bensky urged people not to
underestimate their strength. He
gave assurance that White House
officials are aware of popularly
supported marches, teach-ins and
peace demonstrations and take
them into consideration when
forming policy.
If people participate in these
activities and challenge reporters
in cases where stories are overtly
or unfairly biased, Bensky said,
changes will occur.
