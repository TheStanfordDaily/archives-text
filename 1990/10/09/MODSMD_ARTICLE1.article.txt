# Media watchdog:
## Mideast news is biased 
### Alex Hoye Staff writer 
Media watchdog Larry Bensky barked a
warning to the American public last night
in Kresge Auditorium, charging the press
with an inaccurate and biased presentation
of international news.
The media presents "what they want
you to think is going on, rather than what
really is going on," he said to a small crowd
in Kresge Auditorium.
Bensky, national affairs correspondent
for Pacifica Radio, unleashed his sarcastic
wit on the media establishment in his pre

the Middle East." His keynote speech
capped an all-day Middle East Teach-in
that was intended to raise awareness of cur

Bensky accused journalists of pandering

sexual harassment and political persecu
tion undertaken by the Iraqi government
until now, Bensky said the news program
should have delved deeper into why the U.S.
government gave as much as $1 billion in
official aid to Iraq in 1986, while fully
aware of Saddam's atrocious policies.
Bensky then charged magazines like
Time and Newsweek with focusing on
"head-scratching" human interest stories
about "G.I. Joes and now G.I. Jills" eating
C-rations in the desert, instead of larger
questions such as the legitimacy of U.S. mil

He also chided the publications for
extensive use of unattributed and unac-
