Americans share Nobel prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Two
American doctors won the Nobel Prize in
medicine Monday for their work in transplant
ing human organs and bone marrow, revolu
tionary procedures that have saved thousands
of lives over three decades.
Joseph E. Murray, 71, who performed the
first successful organ transplant — a kidney —
and E. Donnall Thomas, 70, who pioneered
bone marrow transplants to cure leukemia, will
share the $704,000 (4 million kronor) prize.
Most Nobel Prizes in medicine have been
awarded for basic research, not for clinical
treatment.
"I really thought this work was too clinical
to ever win the prize," Thomas said from his
home in Bellevue, Wash. He is affiliated with
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
in Seattle, one of the world's major bone mar
row transplant institutions.
De Klerk OKs exiles' return
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Presi
dent F.W. de Klerk announced yesterday that
political exiles can begin applying to return to
South Africa, addressing a key demand of the
African National Congress.
His statement followed a three-hour meet
ing with ANC leader Nelson Mandela at which
they apparently differed on causes of black fac
tional fighting that has killed about 800 people
in eight weeks.
The move could help resolve one of the
megor stumbling blocks of peace talks between
the white-led government and Mandela's ANC,
the largest black opposition movement.
The ANC has demanded the return of its
estimated 20,000 exiles before beginning full
scale negotiations on black-white power shar
ing and ending apartheid.
Until yesterday, the government had agreed
in principle but never announced a mecha
nism.
Wealthy get poorer this year
NEW YORK (AP) — If misery loves com
pany, homeowners, junk-bond investors and
uninsured S&L depositors can take heart. The
richest people in America also are feeling a lot
poorer this year.
From debt-dogged Donald J. Trump to
financial felon Michael R. Milken and others,
fortunes of the wealthiest declined dramati
cally this year, Forbes magazine says.
Fifty-three members of the Forbes 400 list
suffered declines in net worth ranging from
$100 million to $880 million, the magazine said
in its Oct. 22 edition, released yesterday.
For the first time since Forbes began pub
lishing the list in 1082, the -minimvrrv jiet t
worth required to join the elite ranking
dropped, from $275 million in 1989 to $260
million this year.
U.S. servicemen killed, missing
(AP) Two American airmen who volun
teered for duty with the multinational force
facing Iraq died in a jet crash yesterday in
Saudi Arabia, and the Navy searched for two
helicopters and eight crew members missing in
the Arabian Sea.
The Pentagon said search and rescue crews
had spotted the wreckage of at least one heli
copter late yesterday but no bodies had been
found.
