# Budget bill passes
## Breakthrough ends government shutdown 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A government
shutdown ended early Tuesday after a
night of budget breakthroughs in Congress
that also saw the Senate give final approval
to a $500-billion deficit-reduction plan.
The Senate passed an emergency bill on
a voice vote Monday night that would let
the government open normally Tuesday
morning and the House concurred, 362-3 at
about 1:30 a.m. EDT.
The White House said President Bush
would sign the legislation and that all fed
eral employees should report to work as
scheduled.
Shortly after midnight, the Senate voted
66-33 for final approval to a separate mea
sure, a five-year, $500-billion package of tax
increases and spending cuts. The plan envi
sioned smaller cuts in Medicare, but possi
bly higher tax increases, than an earlier
version the House rejected last week.
"Tonight we reap the bitter harvest of a
decade of national indulgence," said Senate
Mtyority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
This outline plan mapped the way for
specific spending cuts and tax increases,
which Congress planned to put in a sepa
rate bill and pass by Oct. 19. The outline
does not require the president's signature,
but the later bill does.
The emergency spending measure would
allow the government to operate normally
through Oct. 19. Congressional leaders
hope all budget work will be completed by
then, and that the members can adjourn to
work on their re-election campaigns.
The Statue of Liberty, museums and
national parks have been closed since Sat
urday because the budget crisis had pre
vented Congress from approving any
spending legislation for the new fiscal year.
But the full brunt of the federal shutdown
was masked because of the long Columbus
Day weekend.
Earlier in the day, lawmakers warned of

chaos if the White House and Congress
failed to resolve their months-long impasse
over the federal deficit.
"We're not just dealing with programs,"
warned Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, urging his colleagues to
pass the measure quickly. "We're dealing
with individual human beings and families,
and their hopes and fears and dreams."
"This has just Been playing marshmal
low stuff" so far, said Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., the Senate's assistant Republican
leader, referring to the limited impact on
the government during the Columbus Day
holiday weekend.
Debate on the budget began in the early
evening. Leaders of both parties had spent
the day trying to line up support for the
budget and for a separate measure bringing
the shut-down government back to life
Tuesday morning.
"This is not a shining moment for any
one," Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn., said of the budget
mess as debate began. "And frankly, our
countrymen are rightly tired of it."
The House passed the budget outline
250-164 in a post-midnight session early
Monday. The measure contains far fewer
specific spending cuts and tax increases
than the version that went down to defeat
last week, putting off those decisions for
later in the month.
The vagueness of the new package left
some senators unhappy.
"I'm not going to sign onto this flll-in
the-blanks package," said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, who supported and
helped write the first package.
Sasser said of the new proposal, "The
best argument is it reduces the deficit by
historic proportions over the next five years
and gives Congress flexibility on issues and
problems that have troubled members and
constituents over the last few days."
