# Saddam turns Kuwait into Iraqi backwater

### 
JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — By
violence and stealth, Saddam Hussein
is rapidly transforming Kuwait from a
glittering emirate to an Iraqi backwa
ter, diplomats, exiled officials and
refugees say.
"The Iraqis are doing their best to
obliterate Kuwait's identity and seal it
off from the outside," said one senior
Western diplomat displaced by Iraq's

Aug. 2 invasion. "The world doesn't
realize how successful they are."
While noting that no accurate count
was possible, he estimated that hun
dreds, if not thousands, of Kuwaitis
had been put to death. Some were shot
in front of their families. Many others
were deported to Iraq.
Diplomats and Kuwaiti officials in
exile endorsed a recent Amnesty Inter

national report of "a horrifying picture
of widespread arrests, torture under
interrogation, summary executions
and mass extrajudicial killings."
In one incident, a Western diplomat
said, Iraqi soldiers shot to death five
hospital workers when doctors told
them that a wounded comrade they
brought in was already dead on arrival.
They said nearly every captured

Kuwaiti military and police officer was
either shot on the spot or taken ofT for
days and then returned to be executed
in front of relatives.
Holdout Western embassies have
maintained a defiant, if symbolic, pres
ence despite Iraqi orders that since
Kuwait has been declared Iraq's 19th
province, foreign embassies are no
longer permitted.
