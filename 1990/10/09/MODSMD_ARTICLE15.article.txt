The cold war showed further signs
of thawing last week as the United
States and the Soviet Union agreed
to limit non-nuclear weapons in
Europe.
In New York Wednesday, Secre
tary of State James Baker and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevard
nadze announced they had agreed to
the first treaty on non-nuclear arms

since negotiations in
that area were first
attempted 15 years
ago.
The accord regu-

lates the number of tanks and land
based aircraft each side may deploy.
Symbolically, this treaty is impor
tant. If it is followed, there is almost
no chance of a European land war.
Additionally, the United States and
the U.S.S.R. have taken one more

step toward an alliance that both will
need to protect their common inter
ests as their global power diminishes.
The agreement is not essential to
world security, however, when looked
at in light of recent developments in
each nation. As Political Science
Prof. David Holloway explained, it
was in fact because "Europe has
moved beyond a confrontational situ
ation" in the past year that the

agreement was reached so quickly.
Both superpowers have economi
cally drained themselves in their
long-running grudge match. Hol
loway said, "There are certainly in
the Soviet Union economic pressures
to reduce expenditures and, to a
lesser extent, in the United States as
well." He explained, however, that
the treaty was not shaped primarily
by economic concerns.
