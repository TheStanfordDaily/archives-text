## Sleepy Centennial 
### 
IN AN IRONIC TWIST of the
Centennial Celebration, last
weekend's symposium, "The
Information Explosion," let out
only a whimper among the Stan
ford student body.
As part of the Celebration activ
ities, the symposium was designed
to reemphasize the University's
commitment to teaching and
research.
Although the schedule of speak
ers comprised a myriad of fascinat
ing people, including former Secre
tary of State George Shultz and
newspaper conglomerate chair E
Anthony Ridder, student turnout
to the panel discussions was
extremely dismal.
To the symposium's credit,
Stanford students have a history
of apathetic attendance records at
various events, from afternoon
classes to volleyball matches. Most
individuals would prefer to view a

slide show and fireworks than lis
ten to an academic discussion.
Over the course of this year, the
University will continue to invite
the best and brightest to speak to
the Stanford community free of
charge. Students should take
advantage of all of the special
opportunities that the Centennial
Celebration presents.
But the Centennial Celebration
itself has to accept some of the
blame for doing a poor job of publi
cizing "The Information Explo
sion" to the student body. The few
posters and newspaper advertise
ments that did appear were far
from eye-catching.
The Centennial Celebration is
much more than a series of parties.
The year-long celebration is sup
posed to highlight and emphasize
Stanford's academic and cultural
history as well as our 100 th birth
day.
