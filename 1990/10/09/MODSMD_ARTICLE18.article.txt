# Happy 20th, SAIO
## 
### 
Twenty years after its
creation, the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization
deserves sincere congratulations
for making itself a heard voice on
campus and for exposing Stanford
to the rich and diverse cultures of
Native Americans here.
A clear example of the motiva
tion and purpose of SAIO members
is the Powwow that draws thou
sands to Stanford every year, mak
ing it the largest celebration of its
kind on the West Coast.
The entire community should
join SAIO as its celebrates its 20th
anniversary this week.
Tomorrow at 7 p.m., the co-chair
of a U.S. Department of Education
task force on Native American
nations will discuss "Indian
Nations At Risk? Contemporary

Issues Facing American Indians
and Alaska Natives" at Cubberley
Auditorium.
On Thursday at Cubberley, a
motion picture about Native Amer
icans in government boarding
schools will show at 7 p.m.
- A slide' show and discussion
about the history of SAIO will be
held Friday night in the Native
American Cultural Center, and two
exhibits of photography and art
will continue showing in Tresidder
Union and Meyer Library.
The celebration is an opportuni
ty to reflect upon the contributions
of Native Americans to both the
Stanford community and American
life in general â€” a thought with a
twinge of irony, considering the fes
tival coincides with Columbus Day.
Happy 20th, SAIO.
