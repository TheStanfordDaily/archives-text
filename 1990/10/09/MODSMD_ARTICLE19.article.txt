ASSU Sunday Flicks unfairly barred pass holders from film

READ THE SMALL PRINT: that
was the response the Flicks
staffers were giving to the angry
crowd Sunday night.
The small print on the back of each
Flicks pass. The small print about "Non
refundable." The small print about
"admission between other pass holders
will be on a first-come, first-served
basis."
"You entered into a contract," said
one of the staffers. Not that any of us
who bought the passes could have read
this before paying our money to get the
card. The big advertising banners failed
to mention this.
While the table just outside Memorial
Auditorium continued selling these
passes, the Flicks people told the rest of
the pass holders waiting on the steps of
the auditorium and lined up by the foun
tain to go home, that nobody else was

getting in, and, most of all, that none of
them were responsible.
The Flicks staff wasn't even prepared
to say if we could get a refund. While
claiming they were under no obligation
to give one, they said there was nothing
we could do about it tonight, but maybe
if we got back to the ASSU next week
they could talk about it.
Even if they were to give a refund for
the portion of our tickets corresponding
to one movie, the situation would hardly
be acceptable. We were led to believe that
a Flicks pass meant we could go to the
first Flick of the year, planned around it,
and invested our time and effort going to
stand in the Flicks line (always a mess
anyway, but at least a known hazard).
Further, most people clearly don't
value all the movies on this quarter's
schedule equally, and judging by the
turnout for this movie, many seemed to

value it more than one-twelfth of a
Flicks pass.
Perhaps everything Flicks did was
perfectly legal, but certainly it was not
right.
Sunday Flicks exists as a part of the
ASSU, supposedly to serve the Stanford
community, and particularly, one would
hope, to serve those who buy Flicks
passes.
The fact that Flicks oversells passes is
not necessarily wrong. If it is known that
not every pass holder is going to show up
for any single movie, everyone can save
money, or more people can have passes,
by overselling to some extent.
But if more pass holders show up
than there are seats, the cost in wasted
time, effort and opportunity (not to men
tion money for a useless pass) is high.
This cost is apparently not taken into
account by the Flicks staff, who have lit

tie to lose by selling more passes.
So what exactly is the process that led
to the decision to sell that many passes?
Is there anyone to take responsibility
and be subject to the consequences of a
bad decision? What can be done to make
sure this won't happen again?
Perhaps the ASSU would care more
about this if they weren't so free about
handing out free Flicks passes to them
selves. Who exactly in the ASSU is enti
tled to a free pass?
There's never much publicity about it,
but a number of people with ties to the
ASSU seem to get the free passes that
are on a different color paper.
Contests usually exclude employees of
the organizing body, but apparently in
the Flicks Lottery those in charge are
the only real winners.
