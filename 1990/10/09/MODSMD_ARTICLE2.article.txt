# Educators or enforcers?
## New alcohol policy has RAs, RFs concerned 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The new University policy forbidding
unlawful drug and alcohol use is turning
out to be a stiff drink for resident fellows
and assistants to swallow.
The policy is the result of federal legisla
tion requiring universities that receive fed
eral funds to outlaw illegal drug and alcohol
consumption.
Suggestions on how to comply with the
policy have left RAs and RFs concerned it
will change their roles from residential edu
ators to residential enforcers, as well as
arm students.
In response to RFs who requested that
lidelines be set until the University final
:es plans to implement and enforce its pol
y, Acting Director of Residential Educa
on Robin Hensley issued a memo Friday
recommending RAs and RFs not spend
dorm funds on alcohol nor personally buy
alcohol for residents under 21.
While Hensley said she didn't know if
these guidelines would become official pol
icy, several RAs and RFs have expressed
concern that the new policy and interim

regulations could drive underage drinkers
from a supervised environment to a closed,
unmonitored setting.
If alcohol cannot be purchased with
house funds, "it will make people go off
campus to drink and drive drunk," said
senior Ashley Lodato, an RAin Trancos.
Prohibiting unlawful drinking creates a
situation "where [underage drinkers] hide
their alcohol," Lodato said. "The drinking
won't stop; it will go on behind closed doors
and become uncontrolled."
Lodato also expressed concern that stu
dents will "pound their alcohol quick," so
they have less time in which they risk being
caught.
Junior Marliese Warren, an RAin
Madera, said, "The goal of the old policy
was a good one â€” to keep drinking in the
open, where RAs and other house members
were aware of the situation.
"If we go the opposite way, then fresh
men are going to drink in their rooms,"
Warren said.
"I don't see how this policy can work,"
said senior Kesinee Angkustsiri, an RAin
Branner Hall. "Minors will find
alcohol whether or not it's imme
diately available."
"Alcohol is a big part of our
society," Angkustsiri said. "Peo
ple should learn to handle it
responsibly."
Ed Frueh, an RF in Florence
Moore Hall, said the old policy
"provides a supportive atmo
sphere for an inevitable amount
of [experimental] drinking."
The new policy "will cause a lot
of underground, irresponsible
drinking," he said.
"I'd rather [students drink] in
a somewhat protective, support
ive environment than go 10 miles
off campus, drive in a car and
drive back," Frueh said.
Branner RA Jill Sporleder
raised an additional concern.
"When you don't serve any alco
hol, the drinkers and non
drinkers [do not] hang out
together," Sporleder, a senior,
said. "That can be a big problem .
.. because we need to be building
community in a frosh dorm."
Freshmen in some houses have
been stockpiling alcohol for fear
the University will soon forbid
the purchase of alcohol by dorms,
according to junior Eric Lassen,
an RAin Alondra House.
"Some freshmen have been
saying, 'Let's spend a lot [on alco
hol] now,' and that really con
cerns me," he said.
Trancos RA Matt Eldridge, a
senior, pointed out students could
find ways to get around the new
policy, such as pooling together
personal funds or voting for a
rebate from house dues to pur
chase alcohol.
RAs and RFs also worry they
will be placed in an enforcement
role, in which they would be
required to patrol students for
alcohol use and report underage
drinkers.
"I did not choose to be an RA to
be a policeman," said junior
Robert Almanzan, an RAin
Toyon Hall. "We're supposed to
be educators."
"RAs didn't apply to be RAs to

bust people," Lodato said.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry,
an RF in Soto, said he "will not
police underage drinking... It's
not our responsibility to enforce
state law."
His wife Frenchie said she
doubts the role of RFs will change
this year because "we all had a job
description we accepted, and
being alcohol police is not in the
description."
Some RFs and RAs said they
still aren't sure if, or how, their
role has changed under the new
policy.
"I find the whole situation
increasingly ambiguous," Frueh
said.
He said the University
"doesn't seem to be taking a clear
stance on the law" and has not
told RFs and RAs what their role
should now be.
