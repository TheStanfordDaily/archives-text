# Educators or enforcers?
## New alcohol policy has RAs, RFs concerned 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The new University policy forbidding
unlawful drug and alcohol use is turning
out to be a stiff drink for resident fellows
and assistants to swallow.
The policy is the result of federal legisla
tion requiring universities that receive fed
eral funds to outlaw illegal drug and alcohol
consumption.
Suggestions on how to comply with the
policy have left RAs and RFs concerned it
will change their roles from residential edu
ators to residential enforcers, as well as
arm students.
In response to RFs who requested that
lidelines be set until the University final
:es plans to implement and enforce its pol
y, Acting Director of Residential Educa
on Robin Hensley issued a memo Friday
recommending RAs and RFs not spend
dorm funds on alcohol nor personally buy
alcohol for residents under 21.
While Hensley said she didn't know if
these guidelines would become official pol
icy, several RAs and RFs have expressed
concern that the new policy and interim

regulations could drive underage drinkers
from a supervised environment to a closed,
unmonitored setting.
If alcohol cannot be purchased with
house funds, "it will make people go off
campus to drink and drive drunk," said
senior Ashley Lodato, an RAin Trancos.
Prohibiting unlawful drinking creates a
situation "where [underage drinkers] hide
their alcohol," Lodato said. "The drinking
won't stop; it will go on behind closed doors
and become uncontrolled."
Lodato also expressed concern that stu
dents will "pound their alcohol quick," so
they have less time in which they risk being
caught.
Junior Marliese Warren, an RAin
Madera, said, "The goal of the old policy
was a good one â€” to keep drinking in the
open, where RAs and other house members
were aware of the situation.
"If we go the opposite way, then fresh
men are going to drink in their rooms,"
Warren said.
"I don't see how this policy can work,"
