# Columnist should avoid generalizing

### 
I am writing in response to Heidi Dur
row's Oct. 4 column "Between different
worlds."
Durrow claims that after she gradu
ates, "My color will isolate me. Even as I
discuss Shakespeare or Kant, white folks
will note that I am tanner than the aver
age bear â€” that I am not like all the oth
ers. White folks will never see me with
out seeing my 6rou/nness[italics in origi
nal]."
Isn't Durrow guilty of making unjusti
fiably broad generalizations, if not out
right stereotyping?
No one denies that racism still exists,
but to imply that all white people are
unable to look beyond (or beneath) skin
color is unfair.
Durrow goes on to write, "There's

something quite thrilling about being
'unique.' Yet what white people would
really mean by this dubious compliment
is that I am 'better than black' and more
importantly that I am 'almost white.'
Again, if Durrow really believes this to
be true, I wish that she would at least
qualify her statement by writing "some
white people."
Unlike Durrow, I can't speak for the
whole white race, but I can say that most
of my white friends and I would never
think of any African-American (or Asian,
or Chicano, etc.) person as being "almost
white." To claim otherwise is unfair and,
frankly, a little ridiculous.
I hope that Durrow changes her opin
ions on these matters before she actually
graduates, for negative expectations have
a way of turning into self-fulfilling
prophesies.
