# Stanford in need of more school spirit
## 
### 
I find it quite surprising that, as we
celebrate Stanford's 100 th year, there
seems to be so little school unity or spir
it.
Stanford's undying commitment to
multiculturalism and diversity in general
has helped make our school a great uni
versity. Indeed, from the first day that
we enter Stanford, we are constantly
reminded of the fact not only by
Residential Education, but by our mere
participation in the Stanford community.
However, there are situations where
diversity is NOT a virtue. I am, of
course, speaking about football.
There are times for the occasional
"Donner!" or "Branner sucks!" cheer,
but if the majority had to hear them
every other play, there would be more
spectators at intramural football.

The football season is almost half over
and Big Game will soon be here.
As noted by the recent Daily editorial,
now may not be the most appropriate
time to pelt "Cal sucks!" and other more
colorful phrases at our Berkeley rivals.
But this is not all there is to the cen
tury-old rivalry. The more positive and
far more important aspect is school pride
and unity, which does not have to be
saved for times when we need to "block
that kick" (Big Game '88) and keep the
Axe from the hands of the dirty Golden
Bear for one more precious year.
By defeating Notre Dame, the team
has shown that it is capable of great
things. They deserve our support.
So let's get behind our team every
game (which isn't hard with the new stu
dent section). Whether the students'
cheers coincide with the yell leaders or
not, let's support the players.
Sock it to 'em, Stanford!
