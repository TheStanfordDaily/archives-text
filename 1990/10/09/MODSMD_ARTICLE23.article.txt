## The 						Columbus legacy 
### 
HOW WOULD YOU ALL FEEL if,
say, tomorrow, an alien fleet
landed in San Francisco, claiming
all that they could see, from the Marin
headlands to the East Bay to the Penin
sula, as their territory by right of discov
ery .. . and then proceeded to kill every
thing that moved, especially humans?
After all, we obviously haven't utilized
our natural resources properly. Why
bother keeping us around, always getting
underfoot and such?
Sometimes I dream of this happening,
and get a perverse pleasure out of think
ing that there would be a whole lot of
other people experiencing the nifty feel
ing of being an endangered species.
But, dreams aside, I know what you're
thinking. "Preposterous! They'd recog
nize that we've built a magnificent civi
lization on this planet, and that we are
certainly beings worthy of respect."
Uh-uh.
Let me just mention something, a little
reminder in case such things as 25 million
dollars worth of spacecraft called the
Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
being sent to Mars has clouded the mem
ory. Something akin to such a sce
nario happened here, on this continent
and throughout the "New World," start
ing approximately 500 years ago when
Columbus sailed ass-backwards onto the
shores of the Caribbean islands.
He couldn't be like the Vikings —
come, do a little fishin', maybe hang out
with the natives for a bit, and then head
home.
No, ol' Chris had to say "mine." And

millions have died because of that atti
tude.
I realize that it's too late to ask you to
think about this on Columbus Day. But
that's okay — it's something you should
think about every day, and every time
there's that upswelling of pride in having
built America into the great (cough,
cough — excuse me) place it is today
The people who came and colonized
this place, the people whose blood runs in
many of your veins, didn't create a civi
lization out of the wilderness.
They simply bulldozed over the ones
that were already in place, and con
structed America, the moral standard
bearer (chh-hack, cough — hmm, must be
the flu) of the world, on the ruins.
Some members of those civilizations
managed to escape the genocide, move on
to different lands and protect themselves.
A few even managed to regain a bit of
lost ground. But a large Dortipn couldn't
do either, and it is for that reason that
those who are descended from the sur
vivors look upon Columbus Day as a day
of mourning, not of celebration.
But we do have many other things to
celebrate, not the least the fact that we
are alive to refresh everybody's memory.
And this week, those of us here wish to
invite all of you to join with us as we cele
brate the 20th anniversary of the Stan
ford American Indian Organization.
Now, to others, our way of celebrating
may seem strange. We honor those who
went before us, we remember the ways of
our traditions, and we try to tell others
what we're so damn happy about. (After

The people who came and
colonized this place didn't
create a civilization out of
the wilderness.

all, if you got what you think is a good
thing, why not share it around?)
And, please, don't think of it as an
"educational experience." Think of it as,
well, a human experience.
We're all running through this zoo one
step behind and a little out of breath, try
ing to survive, enjoy ourselves and under
stand what's around us.
And a good many of those things we're
trying to understand are other people,
how and why they do what they do.
If we achieve some understanding of
them, even if only partially, we all breathe
a little easier, and, perhaps, even take
home an additional facet of existence.
So check it out. Trust me, it's more fun
than studying.
