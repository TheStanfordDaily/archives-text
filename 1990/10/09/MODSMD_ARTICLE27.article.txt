## Vonnegut's magic is at work in 'Hocus Pocus' 
### 
Hocus Pocus
by Kurt Vonnegut
Putnam, $21.95, 302 pages.
Reviewed by Cynthia Benton
Kurt Vonnegut's newest work is a
satire of life in the 20th century sup
posedly written by Eugene Debs
Hartke on scraps of paper while he
awaits trial in a prison.
Underneath a zany exterior, it cri
tiques many of the ills of contempo
rary life, such as racism, materialism,
the impact of the Vietnam War and
pollution.
Because of its view of racism as an
unsolvable problem, "Hocus Pocus" is
perhaps not a wise reading choice for
the adamantly multicultural student.
In the world Vonnegut creates, the
Supreme Court has ruled that it is
cruel and unusual punishment to
imprison people where their race is the
minority, which has led to segregation
of the prisons and the army.
Indeed, Hartke before being impris
oned was a teacher at a college for rich,
primarily white, learning-disabled stu
dents located across the lake from a
black prison run for profit by the
Japanese.
One of the most poignant passages
occurs when the black convicts escape
and then take over the college.
Hartke asks one of the convicts why
he isn't wearing the violet-colored
armbands the freedom fighters use as
a uniform. Referring to his skin color,
the soldier replies, "I was born in a
uniform."
Another surprising turn taken in
this fictional account of the late 20th
century is the take-over of the U.S.A.
by foreign investors.
All the Americans are eager to sell

after building up real businesses, leav
ing themselves rich and useless for the
rest of their lives. The sole exception to
this being the Mafia which hangs on to
everything it ever owned.
The impact of the Vietnam War on
those who fought in it is also dealt
with. Hartke graduated from W«st
Point and fought in the Vietnam War
as a commanding officer.
He often seems to feel that the war
was the only real part of his life and
that his new self is somehow separated

from the soldier he was in the past.
This is emphasized when Hartke
sees himself in old war footage in the
prison and calls out to the other pris
oners, "'There I am! There I am!'...
[continuing on to himself when the
convicts miss seeing him] But they
were too late. I was gone again. Where
did I go? Here I am."
Vonnegut confronts another serious
issue through a friend of Hartke's who
runs a restaurant he refuses to admit
is a whorehouse. Hartke writes that

Hooper's last words, "Okay, I admit it.
It really was a whorehouse," would be
an "apt epitaph for a plurality of work
ing adults in the 20th century."
These adults, although they refuse
to acknowledge it or accept responsi
bility, achieve a living through jobs
which either pollute the earth or are
morally and ethically incorrect.
In a related comment, Hartke pro
poses that a suitable epitaph for the
earth would be, "We could have saved
it, but we were too doggone cheap."
