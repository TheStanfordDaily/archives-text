Ever since his first novel, "The Ipcress
File", was published in 1962, Len
Deighton's writing has been improving,
albeit at an uneven pace.
Deighton's espionage novels are
always centered on the same themes: a
knowledgeable, cynical, and experienced
intelligence agent at odds with his manip
ulative superiors.
Those superiors are, in turn, amal
gams of various attributes of two other
Deighton archetypes. Despite a certain
bland quality to some of his writing, his
novels were generally well-received.
In 1983, with "Berlin Game," he
reached the top of his form. That book,
and sequels "Mexico Set" and "London

Match," were written in the first-person
from the perspective of Bernard Samson,
an agent of Britain's Secret Intelligence
Service.
Throughout the trilogy, Deighton
craftily developed the disastrous treach
ery of Bernard's wife, Fiona, another SIS
employee.
Following the defection of his wife,
Samson is constantly plagued by her
machinations, who for years has under
mined every effort the service has made.
Yet in 1988's "Spy Hook," which initi
ated a second Samson trilogy, Bernard
discovers tltat his wife may be a bril
liantly placed British agent in position to
blow open East Germany's intelligence
apparatus. Then "Spy Line" detailed the
edgy reconciliation between Samson and
his service, and concluded by relating the
violent recovery which brought Fiona
Samson back into the west.
And now? "Spy Sinker," a dreadfully

written novel which appears to have been
hastily slapped together.
Presumably it is meant to horrify by
uncovering the full extent of the service's
treachery; perhaps it is meant to expose
the troubled soul of Fiona. Its failure to
convincingly develop either theme is com
plete in virtually every respect.
Deighton uses a narrative which con
tinually shifts between various charac
ters. This leaves the book with no effec
tive center, which might have made for an
interesting work had Deighton been able
to sustain the style of writing.
But Deighton is out of his element —
his characters are limp and lifeless,
driven by ambiguous motivations. The
plot is worthy of little interest, proving to
be little more than a contrived effort to
convince the reader that there was a
deeper, more sinister level to every single
event of the past five novels.

Last year reviewers panned "Spy
Hook," largely because Deighton, unsur
prisingly, did not anticipate the radical
changes in Eastern Europe; his only ref
erence to glasnost was a cynical joke
implying that Gorbachev's reforms were
a sham.
Many have observed that recent politi
cal changes may put espionage writers
out of a job. But there are plenty of Com
munists who are conspiring to assassi
nate Gorbachev and his fictional counter
parts — which describes a theme of post
glasnost thrillers that's rapidly becoming
old hat.
And there are other ways to establish
conflict between Americans and Soviets.
The film version of "The Hunt for Red
October" clearly dated the picture before
reformers had become prominent in the
Soviet Union, but still managed to be
effective enough.
Yet in the end, all these fictional oppo

nents are contrivances, conjured up only
in order to drive forward an exciting plot.
Communists and drug dealers are in
no way vital to fiction. John le Carry's
brilliant and complex novel "The Russia
House" only furthered a prominent
theme of espionage fiction: namely, that a
close companion may often prove to be
more dangerous than "enemy" agents.
Violent confrontation, after all, is just
one form of conflict, and on the funda
mental level it is conflict that propels all
fiction.
Unfortunately, Len Deighton seems to
have misplaced his grasp of the basic ele
ments of fiction. It would be best to turn
back to older, better efforts for the
moment, until genre writers have come to
a few important realizations.
