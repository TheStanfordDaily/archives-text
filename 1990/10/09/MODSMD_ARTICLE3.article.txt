## Ramsey-Perez wants Greek system to be viewed in a positive light 
### Rebecca Schanberg 
In his new role as Program and
Fraternal Affairs Adviser, Michael
Ramsey-Perez said he envisions a
Greek system which is noted more for
its public service than its public par
ties.
The new post combines Ramsey-
Perez's previous position, Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs, and Frater
nal Affairs Adviser, a position previ
ously held by Michael Hughes.
Ramsey-Perez values the sense of
community which a fraternal atmo
sphere can provide for its members.
"If a freshman's only experience of the
fraternity is a 750-person party, that
sets up a system of expectations and
no one sees the other things that fra
ternities do," he said.
Ramsey-Perez said a primary prob
lem is the association between frater
nities and alcohol-related parties. He
stressed that many individuals in the

campus community are unaware of
other fraternal pursuits or the indi
vidual accomplishments of their mem
bers.
"I want to get people to understand
that we've got [Greek] people in our
classes and in our labs, our libraries —
that we've got fraternity and sorority
people all over the place," Ramsey-
Perez said. "I would have [fraternity
and sorority members] be much more
public about their scholarship stuff
and the community service that they
do."
"We had one fraternity last year in
which three members were voted Phi
Beta Kappa and one of them got one of
those great national scholarships," he
commented.
Ramsey-Perez said a great problem
with the fraternity system's image is
that fraternities receive most of their
publicity from negative incidents
rather than positive incidents. He sug
gested the media holds a double stan

dard for reporting problems in frater
nity parties and dormitory parties.
"Fraternities, because they are subjec
tively selective, are under closer
scrutiny," he said.
However, Ramsey-Perez noted that
although some universities' fraterni
ties and sororities require police-like
supervision, the Stanford Greek sys
tem has more of a need for a guidance
figure. He sees himself as "an advisor,
not a cop."
One of Ramsey-Perez's main goals
is bringing the Greek system into the
mainstream of the campus commu
nity life. Currently, he is developing
several programs in which fraternities
reach out to other students outside of
the party atmosphere.
One program he is considering
involves house-based classes which
would be held in the fraternities, co
hosted by a fraternity and a dormitory.

Fraternal affairs adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez says he wants fraternities to reach out to the campus community by
providing public service outside the party atmosphere.
These classes would provide a
forum for students to get to know
fraternity members in different
contexts.
Ramsey-Perez added these
programs might become a "condi
tion of living in a fraternity."
Another controversial issue
facing Ramsey-Perez is the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities
Act, which became effective Octo
ber 1. He said there is already
both an internal and an external
drive for fraternities to curb the
sizes of parties and to regulate the
availability of alcohol.
"Last year, or maybe the year
before, a couple of the fraternities
instituted the system of closed
parties," Ramsey-Perez said. A
large factor in these changes has
been the skyrocketing costs of
insurance, stemming from the
potential liability to fraternities
for incidents occurring at or after
their parties.
He also said more students are
recognizing the risks associated
with drinking and feeling more
comfortable about drinking in
moderation. "There are more and

'Right now, what I would like to see is a push
to get the [Greek] system where no one has
to question why we have it. It is a positive
contribution to the campus community.'

more people who feel quite com
fortable going to a party and not
drinking or only drinking punch
or something," he said.
A personal advocate of modera
tion, Ramsey-Perez pointed out
that the dangers associated with
drinking include potential car
accidents and sexual decisions.
"People who are judgment
impaired make bad sexual
choices. They engage in very risky
sexual behavior. More than half of
campus date rapes occur when
one or both of the parties have
had toe much to drink," he said.
Ramsey-Perez speculated that
the Drug-Free Schools Act would
have immediate effects on the
Stanford fraternal system, partic
ularly the rush process. "My
hunch is that we're certainly
going to have a dry rush." How
ever, Ramsey-Perez does not
know how the alcohol legislation
will affect campus life in general.

Ramsey-Perez's confidence in
the integrity of fraternities and
sororities is also reflected in his
plan to work with the Inter-Fra
ternity and Inter-Sorority Coun
cils. He hopes to strengthen their
internal judicial process and
develop standards for how frater
nities and sororities conduct
themselves.
Although he values single-sex
housing as an educational
resource, Ramsey-Perez has some
reservations about the subjective
selectivity of fraternities. "When
you select who's going to live in
your house," he said, "you're
called to a higher standard of
behavior."
"Right now, what I would like
to see is a push to get the [Greek]
system where no one has to ques
tion why we have it," Ramsey-
Perez said. "[The Greek system]
is a positive contribution to the
campus community."
