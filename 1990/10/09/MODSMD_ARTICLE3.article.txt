## Ramsey-Perez wants Greek system to be viewed in a positive light 
### Rebecca Schanberg 
In his new role as Program and
Fraternal Affairs Adviser, Michael
Ramsey-Perez said he envisions a
Greek system which is noted more for
its public service than its public par
ties.
The new post combines Ramsey-
Perez's previous position, Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs, and Frater
nal Affairs Adviser, a position previ
ously held by Michael Hughes.
Ramsey-Perez values the sense of
community which a fraternal atmo
sphere can provide for its members.
"If a freshman's only experience of the
fraternity is a 750-person party, that
sets up a system of expectations and
no one sees the other things that fra
ternities do," he said.
Ramsey-Perez said a primary prob
lem is the association between frater
nities and alcohol-related parties. He
stressed that many individuals in the

campus community are unaware of
other fraternal pursuits or the indi
vidual accomplishments of their mem
bers.
"I want to get people to understand
that we've got [Greek] people in our
classes and in our labs, our libraries —
that we've got fraternity and sorority
people all over the place," Ramsey-
Perez said. "I would have [fraternity
and sorority members] be much more
public about their scholarship stuff
and the community service that they
do."
"We had one fraternity last year in
which three members were voted Phi
Beta Kappa and one of them got one of
those great national scholarships," he
commented.
Ramsey-Perez said a great problem
with the fraternity system's image is
that fraternities receive most of their
publicity from negative incidents
rather than positive incidents. He sug
gested the media holds a double stan

dard for reporting problems in frater
nity parties and dormitory parties.
"Fraternities, because they are subjec
tively selective, are under closer
scrutiny," he said.
However, Ramsey-Perez noted that
although some universities' fraterni
ties and sororities require police-like
supervision, the Stanford Greek sys
tem has more of a need for a guidance
figure. He sees himself as "an advisor,
not a cop."
One of Ramsey-Perez's main goals
is bringing the Greek system into the
mainstream of the campus commu
nity life. Currently, he is developing
several programs in which fraternities
reach out to other students outside of
the party atmosphere.
One program he is considering
involves house-based classes which
would be held in the fraternities, co
hosted by a fraternity and a dormitory.
