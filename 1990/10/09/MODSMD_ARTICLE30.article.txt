## Volleyballers to fight charity battle against Bears 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Their story is so sad, even a diehard Stanford fan
may be moved. After a trip to the second-round of
the NCAA playoffs last year, they lost their finest
hitter to graduation. Then over the summer, their
highly-esteemed setter snubbed her teammates and
transferred to UCLA. Two freshmen middle block
ers have been ushered in, a backup setter has been
called to action and a dismal season has begun. And
now, for their travails, even California may deserve
our sympathy.
It would be foolhardy to think that Stanford will
oblige this sentiment. Whether the arch-enemy
Bears are in last place or not, the No. 6 Cardinal (10-
2, 7-1 in the Pac-10) will be as punishing as ever
when California visits Maples Pavilion tonight at
7:30.
The Bears have understandably struggled in
1990. Currently, California is in last place in the con
ference with a 6-8 record overall and a 2-6 mark in
the Pac-10. Before sweeping Washington and Wash
ington State this past weekend, the Golden Bears
were on a seven match losing streak. Cal coach Dave
DeGroot expected as much.
"The first time through the Pac-10 we may take
some licks, lose to some teams we shouldn't," Deg
root said. "But I think it's the second round that's
going to be good for us, where maybe we'll start
beating some teams that, on paper, we shouldn't."
Defeating Stanford would be a nice way to start
this upset run. The Golden Bears came to Burnham
Pavilion last year and fought the Cardinal hard in
three games. Despite having lost, California left an
impression. "[The Bears] are going to be fired up for
us tonight," Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"They've got some good young talent."
Most of that talent comes in All-Pac-10 outside
hitter Lisa Arce. Last year, Arce recorded the sec
ond-most kills in the conference with 483. She leads
the team currently in kills, digs and service aces.
"We don't want to let her go crazy on us," Shaw
said. "We'll be keeping an eye on her."
California's defensive task may be a bit more
intimidating. Stanford has the rare distinction of
having three starting attackers hitting over .300 on
the season. Sophomore Bev Oden is the second-lead
ing percentage hitter in the conference with a .340
mark. Middle blocker Amy Cooper, hitting .304 on
the year, continues to plague defenses with her quick
strikes. Junior All-American Kristin Klein is moving
rapidly up the Stanford career kills' list and has a

'They all have the right atti
tude.'

.311 hitting percentage.
The blocking chore is further complicated by
Shaw's emphasis on a diverse offense. He utilized
junior middle blocker Nicole Appleman with pleas
ing results against Washington and Washington
State and has instructed setter Carrie Feldman to
keep the defenses guessing.
"Carrie moved the ball around well against
Washington State," Shaw said. "That's what we're
looking to do. Our type of attack is varied."
If nothing else, the match may help resolve some
running sagas on the team. While Oden, Klein and
Cooper are fixtures, starting setter Carrie Feldman
is being pressured by freshman Piper Hahn. Hahn,
last year's national high school Player-of-the-Year,
has seen valuable time against UCLA and the
two teams to which Stanford has lost this season.
Shaw has played Hahn in most of the squad's
matches.
"Carrie isn't doing anything wrong," Shaw said.
"Sometimes we just need to pump up the volume.
Piper can give us a spark. The two setters have dif
ferent personalities. Carrie's steadier."
At 5-foot-7, Hahn's one decided disadvantage is
her height. When she plays the front row, teams
often hit to her side to seize the height mismatch.
Feldman is 5-foot-10.
The anticipated return of senior Jessica Benton
may cause some crowding at middle blocker. Her
substitute, Appleman, played flawlessly over the
weekend, and freshman Heidi Eick lurks in the
background.
Sophomore Kristi Paaso will begin practicing
with the team this week after suffering a back injury
early in the year. Incumbent Jennifer Jackson as
well as freshman Danielle Everett will compete with
Paaso, who started last season, for the position.
The most tenuous situation presides at defensive
specialist. Shaw currently has four defense-oriented
backrow specialists who have all excelled over the
season. Due to NCAA travel restrictions, the team
often can carry only two of the players.
"It's a tough situation," Shaw said. "The great
thing is that everyone is working really hard. They
all have the right attitude."

strikes. Junior All-American Kristin Klein is moving
rapidly up the Stanford career kills' list and has a

.311 hitting percentage.
The blocking chore is further complicated by
Shaw's emphasis on a diverse offense. He utilized
junior middle blocker Nicole Appleman with pleas
ing results against Washington and Washington
State and has instructed setter Carrie Feldman to
keep the defenses guessing.
"Carrie moved the ball around well against
Washington State," Shaw said. "That's what we're
looking to do. Our type of attack is varied."
If nothing else, the match may help resolve some
running sagas on the team. While Oden, Klein and
Cooper are fixtures, starting setter Carrie Feldman
is being pressured by freshman Piper Hahn. Hahn,
last year's national high school Player-of-the-Year,
has seen valuable time against UCLA and the
two teams to which Stanford has lost this season.
Shaw has played Hahn in most of the squad's
matches.
"Carrie isn't doing anything wrong," Shaw said.
"Sometimes we just need to pump up the volume.
Piper can give us a spark. The two setters have dif
ferent personalities. Carrie's steadier."
At 5-foot-7, Hahn's one decided disadvantage is
her height. When she plays the front row, teams
often hit to her side to seize the height mismatch.
Feldman is 5-foot-10.
The anticipated return of senior Jessica Benton
may cause some crowding at middle blocker. Her
substitute, Appleman, played flawlessly over the
weekend, and freshman Heidi Eick lurks in the
background.
Sophomore Kristi Paaso will begin practicing
with the team this week after suffering a back injury
early in the year. Incumbent Jennifer Jackson as
well as freshman Danielle Everett will compete with
Paaso, who started last season, for the position.
The most tenuous situation presides at defensive
specialist. Shaw currently has four defense-oriented
backrow specialists who have all excelled over the
season. Due to NCAA travel restrictions, the team
often can carry only two of the players.
"It's a tough situation," Shaw said. "The great
thing is that everyone is working really hard. They
all have the right attitude."

Tonight Carrie Feldman, Amy Cooper, and Co. will face the Golden Bears. One dollar from each ticket
sold will be donated to a relief fund for the California students left homeless by September's tragic fra
ternity fire.
Their story is so sad, even a diehard Stanford fan
may be moved. After a trip to the second-round of
the NCAA playoffs last year, they lost their finest
hitter to graduation. Then over the summer, their
highly-esteemed setter snubbed her teammates and
transferred to UCLA. Two freshmen middle block
ers have been ushered in, a backup setter has been
called to action and a dismal season has begun. And
now, for their travails, even California may deserve
our sympathy.
It would be foolhardy to think that Stanford will
oblige this sentiment. Whether the arch-enemy
Bears are in last place or not, the No. 6 Cardinal (10-
2, 7-1 in the Pac-10) will be as punishing as ever
when California visits Maples Pavilion tonight at
7:30.
The Bears have understandably struggled in
1990. Currently, California is in last place in the con
ference with a 6-8 record overall and a 2-6 mark in
the Pac-10. Before sweeping Washington and Wash
ington State this past weekend, the Golden Bears
were on a seven match losing streak. Cal coach Dave
DeGroot expected as much.
"The first time through the Pac-10 we may take
some licks, lose to some teams we shouldn't," Deg
root said. "But I think it's the second round that's
going to be good for us, where maybe we'll start
beating some teams that, on paper, we shouldn't."
Defeating Stanford would be a nice way to start
this upset run. The Golden Bears came to Burnham
Pavilion last year and fought the Cardinal hard in
three games. Despite having lost, California left an
impression. "[The Bears] are going to be fired up for
us tonight," Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"They've got some good young talent."
Most of that talent comes in All-Pac-10 outside
hitter Lisa Arce. Last year, Arce recorded the sec
ond-most kills in the conference with 483. She leads
the team currently in kills, digs and service aces.
"We don't want to let her go crazy on us," Shaw
said. "We'll be keeping an eye on her."
California's defensive task may be a bit more
intimidating. Stanford has the rare distinction of
having three starting attackers hitting over .300 on
the season. Sophomore Bev Oden is the second-lead
ing percentage hitter in the conference with a .340
mark. Middle blocker Amy Cooper, hitting .304 on
the year, continues to plague defenses with her quick
strikes. Junior All-American Kristin Klein is moving
rapidly up the Stanford career kills' list and has a
