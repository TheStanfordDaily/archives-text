# Field hockey shuts out Pacific 3-0
## 
### Brian Egan 
It looked like Saturday's
women's field hockey game
against the University of the
Pacific was going to be a blowout.
After a layoff of almost two
weeks, Stanford came out smok
ing. Thirty-four seconds into the
match, junior Michelle Beynet
scored from close range, with
assists from Katy Filner and Sara
Hallock.
But for the rest of the half, the
Cardinal offense seemed to be out
of sync. According to coach Sheryl
Johnson, "We started off great,
but we became really complacent.
At halftime, I tried to stress
increased intensity (to the
women.")
The change was obvious. Keep
ing the ball on UOP's side of the
field for most of the second half,
Stanford showed why it is unde
feated in Norpac play this year.
Hallock, a freshman, made it 2-
0 midway through the second half.

five feet. The call against Pacific, a
rarity in field hockey, was issued
because of a flagrant foul commit
ted against Stanford forward Jen
nifer Watts in the crease.
The defense played an out
standing game. Filner, a junior,
was all over the field, as was
Trisha McJennett, who started
the game despite being hampered
by a painful leg injury.
Even with the seemingly lop
sided score, Hallock was happy to
take home the victory. "We
weren't as strong or as fast as we
are capable of being. We look to
dominate every game. But, over
all, I'm always satisfied with a
win."
Coach Johnson echoed those
thoughts. "Every conference
game so far has been close, much
closer than the score has indi
cated. We take no one lightly."
Two Norpac games remain for
Stanford. With two wins, the Car
dinal will earn an automatic
NCAA playoff birth. Their next
match is at California, Oct. 13 at
11am.
