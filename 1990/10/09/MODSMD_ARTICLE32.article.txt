# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
It was the best of weekends. It was. . . the
best of weekends.
Almost every Stanford team that compet
ed was victorious. Most of those victories
were to be expected. One wasn't. It is there
fore appropriate that our two Athletes of the
Week represent both likely and unlikely vic
tors: Elizabeth Joneschild of the No. 11
Cardinal women's soccer team, and Jason
Palumbis of the dangerously underrated

Cardinal football team.
Joneschild, a 5-foot-6 junior forward from
Mercer Island, Washington, helped
Stanford's women hooters to two victories
and the tournament co-title of the
Stanford/Security Pacific Invitational by
scoring three goals in two games.
In the first game against the TCU Horned
Frogs, she fired in a short volley and then fol
lowed mere minutes later with a crossing
pass from the corner that invaded the goal at
the top of net. Stanford won that game 4-1.
The second contest was against the
George Mason Patriots, former powers of
NCAA soccer. Joneschild was on the scoring
end of a spectacular play in that game.
Sophomore Carolyn Einstein howitzered a
huge cross to her, and she headed the ball
into the top of the net for the point.

Although "Touchdown Tommy" Vardell
put 24 points on the board and Ed "No. 1
receiver in the nation" McCaffrey accounted
for 111 yards of gain, it was Palumbis, the 6-
3, 205-pound quarterback from Lake
Oswego, Oregon, who drove the Cardinal
offense.
He turned in a career performance
against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. He
completed 26 of 34 passes for 256 yards and
zero interceptions.
He converted two key plays on the final,
winning drive of the game, including a bold
scramble on a fourth-and-two to get the first
down.

Even down 24-7, he remained composed
and confident in the face of the awesome
Irish mystique. As a good quarterback
should, he led his troops both with his arm
and his attitude.
The Cardinal revolved around Palumbis.
After the game he said, "We wanted to
come in here and shock the world and that's
what we did. I'm really proud of this team."
And we're proud of you, Jason.
