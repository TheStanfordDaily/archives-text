# Macky ponders Card schedule
## 
### 
One of the extremely few
drawbacks of having a
job like this is that once
a week, throughout the year, I
have to come up with an origi
nal idea.
Sounds pretty tough, huh? I
know, it should be easy, but
let's try to remember that I'm a
sports writer, and sportswriters
have never exactly been known
for their cerebral capacities.
Ideas find their way into sports
hackers' heads almost as often
as Lagunita gets filled. As for
good column ideas, well, let's
just say they're as rare as Stan
ford football victories on the
road against legendary top
ranked teams.
This week, however, I
thought I had something
decent to write about and, in
fact, had been thinking about it
for several days. (Yes, some
times Daily columnists actually
think before they start to write.
But believe me, it doesn't hap
pen very often.) The subject
was football. I had something
different to talk about, some
thing that might have put a dis
appointing season into a new
perspective, something that
might have explained why the
Cardinal was 1-3 (soon to be 1-
4,1 figured) and who we should
all blame. It was perfect, it
made sense (well, a little), it
would perhaps ease the pain of
yet another losing season . . .
... and then, in the space of
a few beautiful hours on Satur
day, the football team blew my
idea straight to hell.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Okay, now we've got a 2-3
football team — oops, excuse
me, the best damn 2-3 football
team in the country! Or how
'bout the best 2-3 football team
ever! — but it still faces the
same problems last week's 1-3
squad did. I'm not talking
about the pass defense or the
offensive line or anything like
that. The Stanford football pro
gram's problem is far more
basic than the fact that every
quarterback this team faces
tends to become Dan Fouts,
Terry Bradshaw and Joe Mon
tana rolled into one. No, this is
a simple dilemma, and it's got a
mighty simple solution:
We've got to get rid of this
freaking schedule.
All right, I'm the first to
admit that Saturday's
win was one of the great
est events in the history of
Stanford football. It was magi
cal, it was wonderful, it was the

Super Bowl, World Series and
NBA Championship rolled into
one; it was positively the high
light of every single Stanford
student's time here; it was
Mom and apple pie and troops
in the Gulf (am I rambling?)...
well, maybe it wasn't that
great. After four mediocre (at
best) seasons, though, it felt
damn good.

That said, let's take a look at
how everyone was feeling
about, oh, four days ago, at the
end of the Dark Age now
known as B.N.D. (figure it out).
The football team was 1-3,
coming off a loss in which it
played like Buffalo dropp
ings/Bruin poop/your favorite
form of feces here (to para
phrase at least one player).
The 1-3 was actually the fun
part. What was coming up in
October? Oh, nothing much,
just Notre Dame, USC, Wash
ington and Oregon. That's not
a schedule, it's a free invite to
the annual convention of the
American Masochists Associa
tion.
Seriously, how many of us
figured a W was going to hap
pen in October? Let's see some
hands. Hey you! You're lying.
Fess up. C'mon: Notre Dame?
At Notre Dame? Or USC, with
Todd Marinovich looking to
shred our pass defense? Or
Washington, who pounded the
you-know-what out of USC? Or
Oregon, at Oregon, with quar
terback Bill "All-America"
Musgrave? One and seven,
stumbling into November.
Let's remember, we're talk
ing about the general mood
four days ago. And so, four days
ago, I decided the problem
wasn't with our team.
It was with our scheduling.
It stinks.
At least four Pac-10 teams
will go to bowls this year, and
Stanford has yet to play any of
them. With that kind of confer
ence slate, you'd think we'd
look for a couple non-league
games that would be a little
easier, right? (What's that? Oh,


Cameron
Macky
is that why we play San Jose St.?
Oops.)
Let's just forget that one, and
look at the other two non-Pac-10
games on the Stanford schedule:
Colorado on the road and Notre
Dame on the road.
This is not the way to go about
building a winning program.
Sure, it's great exposure, and
of course it leads to the occasional
world-shocking upset, but it also
tends to lead to records of, say, 3-
6-2 and 3-8. Those records will
become distant memories if the
football team keeps playing the
way it did this weekend, but with
this schedule it'll be tough. And
besides, real football schools don't
go shopping around for road
games against bowl teams. No, if
Stanford wants to be a top-20
team, it's going to have to sched
ule like other top-20 teams. And
that should be fairly simple.
Take, for example, Nebra
ska's schedule. You've
heard of Nebraska. Per
ennial top-20. Perennial bowl

team. Perennial money-maker
(oops, that's probably a sore spot).
This is as solid a football program
as there is, and they prove it every
year with their schedule. Aside
from seven games in the Big Eight
(a.k.a. the Big Three and Five Pop
Warner teams), Nebraska faced a
mammoth non-conference lineup
during the first four weeks of the
season: Baylor (at home), North
ern Illinois (at home), Minnesota
(at home) and Oregon State
(guess where).
The Huskers are 5-0 right now,
to the great surprise of exactly no
one.
Sure, top-20 schools do square
off against each other every now
and then, a la Michigan-Notre
Dame or Miami-Notre Dame, but
more often than not they get sick
of playing games they have a
chance of losing. Florida halted its
traditional rivalry with Miami
several years ago. Notre Dame is
backing out of playing the Hurri
canes after this season. (By the
way, the Irish are hosting Air
Force this weekend. Anyone
wanna give me 55 points on the
Falcons?)
If this is what it takes to be a
"real" football school, then, let's
stop messing around with the Col

orados and Notre Dames, darnit!
Bring on Kansas State! Bring on
Kent State! Bring on Chico State!
As for the tough conference
schedule, I figure all we have to do
is secede from the Pac-10. Then
we schedule whoever the heck we
please.
There are, however, a lot of
good reasons for scheduling
against the best: It's great expo
sure, it helps recruiting, it spurs
fan interest (at Stanford? hmm)
and, occasionally, it leads to a
sweet, unbelievable upset.
Four days ago, I couldn't have
cared less about all that, because
the schedule meant a lot of losses
as well as exposure. Now, since we
finally know we've got a football
team that can beat anyone — yes,
anyone — on the planet, I guess I
can live with the schedule. In fact,
now I don't think it's hard
enough. Forget San Jose St. It's
time for us to quit messing
around!
You think Miami can fit us in
next year?

If you see Cameron Macky today,
have a heart and try not to men
tion the two gopher balls Zane
Smith gave up against the Reds
yesterday.

As for the tough conference
schedule, I figure all we have to do
is secede from the Pac-10. Then
we schedule whoever the heck we
please.
There are, however, a lot of
good reasons for scheduling
against the best: It's great expo
sure, it helps recruiting, it spurs
fan interest (at Stanford? hmm)
and, occasionally, it leads to a
sweet, unbelievable upset.
Four days ago, I couldn't have
cared less about all that, because
the schedule meant a lot of losses
as well as exposure. Now, since we
finally know we've got a football
team that can beat anyone — yes,
anyone — on the planet, I guess I
can live with the schedule. In fact,
now I don't think it's hard
enough. Forget San Jose St. It's
time for us to quit messing
around!
You think Miami can fit us in
next year?

If you see Cameron Macky today,
have a heart and try not to men

Smith gave up against the Reds
yesterday.
One of the extremely few
drawbacks of having a
job like this is that once
a week, throughout the year, I
have to come up with an origi
nal idea.
Sounds pretty tough, huh? I
know, it should be easy, but
let's try to remember that I'm a
sports writer, and sportswriters
have never exactly been known
for their cerebral capacities.
Ideas find their way into sports
hackers' heads almost as often
as Lagunita gets filled. As for
good column ideas, well, let's
just say they're as rare as Stan
ford football victories on the
road against legendary top
ranked teams.
This week, however, I
thought I had something
decent to write about and, in
fact, had been thinking about it
for several days. (Yes, some
times Daily columnists actually
think before they start to write.
But believe me, it doesn't hap
pen very often.) The subject
was football. I had something
different to talk about, some
thing that might have put a dis
appointing season into a new
perspective, something that
might have explained why the
Cardinal was 1-3 (soon to be 1-
4,1 figured) and who we should
all blame. It was perfect, it
made sense (well, a little), it
would perhaps ease the pain of
yet another losing season . . .
... and then, in the space of
a few beautiful hours on Satur
day, the football team blew my
idea straight to hell.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Okay, now we've got a 2-3
football team — oops, excuse
me, the best damn 2-3 football
team in the country! Or how
'bout the best 2-3 football team
ever! — but it still faces the
same problems last week's 1-3
squad did. I'm not talking
about the pass defense or the
offensive line or anything like
that. The Stanford football pro
gram's problem is far more
basic than the fact that every
quarterback this team faces
tends to become Dan Fouts,
Terry Bradshaw and Joe Mon
tana rolled into one. No, this is
a simple dilemma, and it's got a
mighty simple solution:
We've got to get rid of this
freaking schedule.
All right, I'm the first to
admit that Saturday's
win was one of the great
est events in the history of
Stanford football. It was magi
cal, it was wonderful, it was the

Super Bowl, World Series and
NBA Championship rolled into
one; it was positively the high
light of every single Stanford
student's time here; it was
Mom and apple pie and troops
in the Gulf (am I rambling?)...
well, maybe it wasn't that
great. After four mediocre (at
best) seasons, though, it felt
damn good.

That said, let's take a look at
how everyone was feeling
about, oh, four days ago, at the
end of the Dark Age now
known as B.N.D. (figure it out).
The football team was 1-3,
coming off a loss in which it
played like Buffalo dropp
ings/Bruin poop/your favorite
form of feces here (to para
phrase at least one player).
The 1-3 was actually the fun
part. What was coming up in
October? Oh, nothing much,
just Notre Dame, USC, Wash
ington and Oregon. That's not
a schedule, it's a free invite to
the annual convention of the
American Masochists Associa
tion.
Seriously, how many of us
figured a W was going to hap
pen in October? Let's see some
hands. Hey you! You're lying.
Fess up. C'mon: Notre Dame?
At Notre Dame? Or USC, with
Todd Marinovich looking to
shred our pass defense? Or
Washington, who pounded the
you-know-what out of USC? Or
Oregon, at Oregon, with quar
terback Bill "All-America"
Musgrave? One and seven,
stumbling into November.
Let's remember, we're talk
ing about the general mood
four days ago. And so, four days
ago, I decided the problem
wasn't with our team.
It was with our scheduling.
It stinks.
At least four Pac-10 teams
will go to bowls this year, and
Stanford has yet to play any of
them. With that kind of confer
ence slate, you'd think we'd
look for a couple non-league
games that would be a little
easier, right? (What's that? Oh,


Cameron
Macky
is that why we play San Jose St.?
Oops.)
Let's just forget that one, and
look at the other two non-Pac-10
games on the Stanford schedule:
Colorado on the road and Notre
Dame on the road.
This is not the way to go about
building a winning program.
Sure, it's great exposure, and
of course it leads to the occasional
world-shocking upset, but it also
tends to lead to records of, say, 3-
6-2 and 3-8. Those records will
become distant memories if the
football team keeps playing the
way it did this weekend, but with
this schedule it'll be tough. And
besides, real football schools don't
go shopping around for road
games against bowl teams. No, if
Stanford wants to be a top-20
team, it's going to have to sched
ule like other top-20 teams. And
that should be fairly simple.
Take, for example, Nebra
ska's schedule. You've
heard of Nebraska. Per
ennial top-20. Perennial bowl

team. Perennial money-maker
(oops, that's probably a sore spot).
This is as solid a football program
as there is, and they prove it every
year with their schedule. Aside
from seven games in the Big Eight
(a.k.a. the Big Three and Five Pop
Warner teams), Nebraska faced a
mammoth non-conference lineup
during the first four weeks of the
season: Baylor (at home), North
ern Illinois (at home), Minnesota
(at home) and Oregon State
(guess where).
The Huskers are 5-0 right now,
to the great surprise of exactly no
one.
Sure, top-20 schools do square
off against each other every now
and then, a la Michigan-Notre
Dame or Miami-Notre Dame, but
more often than not they get sick
of playing games they have a
chance of losing. Florida halted its
traditional rivalry with Miami
several years ago. Notre Dame is
backing out of playing the Hurri
canes after this season. (By the
way, the Irish are hosting Air
Force this weekend. Anyone
wanna give me 55 points on the
Falcons?)
If this is what it takes to be a
"real" football school, then, let's
stop messing around with the Col

orados and Notre Dames, darnit!
Bring on Kansas State! Bring on
Kent State! Bring on Chico State!

(a.k.a. the Big Three and Five Pop
Warner teams), Nebraska faced a
mammoth non-conference lineup
during the first four weeks of the
season: Baylor (at home), North
ern Illinois (at home), Minnesota
(at home) and Oregon State
(guess where).
The Huskers are 5-0 right now,
to the great surprise of exactly no
one.
Sure, top-20 schools do square
off against each other every now
and then, a la Michigan-Notre
Dame or Miami-Notre Dame, but
more often than not they get sick
of playing games they have a
chance of losing. Florida halted its
traditional rivalry with Miami
several years ago. Notre Dame is
backing out of playing the Hurri
canes after this season. (By the
way, the Irish are hosting Air
Force this weekend. Anyone
wanna give me 55 points on the
Falcons?)
If this is what it takes to be a
"real" football school, then, let's
stop messing around with the Col

orados and Notre Dames, darnit!
Bring on Kansas State! Bring on
Kent State! Bring on Chico State!
As for the tough conference
schedule, I figure all we have to do
is secede from the Pac-10. Then
we schedule whoever the heck we
please.
There are, however, a lot of
good reasons for scheduling
against the best: It's great expo
sure, it helps recruiting, it spurs
fan interest (at Stanford? hmm)
and, occasionally, it leads to a
sweet, unbelievable upset.
Four days ago, I couldn't have
cared less about all that, because
the schedule meant a lot of losses
as well as exposure. Now, since we
finally know we've got a football
team that can beat anyone — yes,
anyone — on the planet, I guess I
can live with the schedule. In fact,
now I don't think it's hard
enough. Forget San Jose St. It's
time for us to quit messing
around!
You think Miami can fit us in
next year?

If you see Cameron Macky today,
have a heart and try not to men
tion the two gopher balls Zane
Smith gave up against the Reds
yesterday.
