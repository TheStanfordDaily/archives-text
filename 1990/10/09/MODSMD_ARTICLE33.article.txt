# Macky ponders Card schedule
## 
### 
One of the extremely few
drawbacks of having a
job like this is that once
a week, throughout the year, I
have to come up with an origi
nal idea.
Sounds pretty tough, huh? I
know, it should be easy, but
let's try to remember that I'm a
sports writer, and sportswriters
have never exactly been known
for their cerebral capacities.
Ideas find their way into sports
hackers' heads almost as often
as Lagunita gets filled. As for
good column ideas, well, let's
just say they're as rare as Stan
ford football victories on the
road against legendary top
ranked teams.
This week, however, I
thought I had something
decent to write about and, in
fact, had been thinking about it
for several days. (Yes, some
times Daily columnists actually
think before they start to write.
But believe me, it doesn't hap
pen very often.) The subject
was football. I had something
different to talk about, some
thing that might have put a dis
appointing season into a new
perspective, something that
might have explained why the
Cardinal was 1-3 (soon to be 1-
4,1 figured) and who we should
all blame. It was perfect, it
made sense (well, a little), it
would perhaps ease the pain of
yet another losing season . . .
... and then, in the space of
a few beautiful hours on Satur
day, the football team blew my
idea straight to hell.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Okay, now we've got a 2-3
football team — oops, excuse
me, the best damn 2-3 football
team in the country! Or how
'bout the best 2-3 football team
ever! — but it still faces the
same problems last week's 1-3
squad did. I'm not talking
about the pass defense or the
offensive line or anything like
that. The Stanford football pro
gram's problem is far more
basic than the fact that every
quarterback this team faces
tends to become Dan Fouts,
Terry Bradshaw and Joe Mon
tana rolled into one. No, this is
a simple dilemma, and it's got a
mighty simple solution:
We've got to get rid of this
freaking schedule.
All right, I'm the first to
admit that Saturday's
win was one of the great
est events in the history of
Stanford football. It was magi
cal, it was wonderful, it was the

Super Bowl, World Series and
NBA Championship rolled into
one; it was positively the high
light of every single Stanford
student's time here; it was
Mom and apple pie and troops
in the Gulf (am I rambling?)...
well, maybe it wasn't that
great. After four mediocre (at
best) seasons, though, it felt
damn good.

That said, let's take a look at
how everyone was feeling
about, oh, four days ago, at the
end of the Dark Age now
known as B.N.D. (figure it out).
The football team was 1-3,
coming off a loss in which it
played like Buffalo dropp
ings/Bruin poop/your favorite
form of feces here (to para
phrase at least one player).
The 1-3 was actually the fun
part. What was coming up in
October? Oh, nothing much,
just Notre Dame, USC, Wash
ington and Oregon. That's not
a schedule, it's a free invite to
the annual convention of the
American Masochists Associa
tion.
Seriously, how many of us
figured a W was going to hap
pen in October? Let's see some
hands. Hey you! You're lying.
Fess up. C'mon: Notre Dame?
At Notre Dame? Or USC, with
Todd Marinovich looking to
shred our pass defense? Or
Washington, who pounded the
you-know-what out of USC? Or
Oregon, at Oregon, with quar
terback Bill "All-America"
Musgrave? One and seven,
stumbling into November.
Let's remember, we're talk
ing about the general mood
four days ago. And so, four days
ago, I decided the problem
wasn't with our team.
It was with our scheduling.
It stinks.
At least four Pac-10 teams
will go to bowls this year, and
Stanford has yet to play any of
them. With that kind of confer
ence slate, you'd think we'd
look for a couple non-league
games that would be a little
easier, right? (What's that? Oh,
