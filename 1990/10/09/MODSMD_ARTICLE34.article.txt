# Profs, take issue with U.S. military deployment in Saudi Arabia
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Examining the United States'
response to the Persian Gulf crisis from
gender, multicultural and Arab perspec
tives, a panel of four Stanford professors
discussed and criticized U.S. deployment
in Saudi Arabia yesterday.
Titled "The Truth Behind the Head
lines," the afternoon discussion in Kresge
Auditorium was part of a day-long Middle
East Teach-in sponsored by the Penin
sula Peace Center in Palo Alto and cam
pus organizations.
Presenting a point of view different
from conventional economic and political
arguments, Anthropology Asst. Prof.
Carol Delaney talked about what she
described as a "slush of human suffering
and some murky gender issues" involving

the Gulf crisis.
Delaney, who was in Iraq last March as
part of a study-group sponsored by the
Baghdad government, observed that the
status of women in Iraq "is much closer
to our ideals" than in Kuwait.
Delaney said Iraqi women's right to
vote and serve in government is protected
by the constitution. Moreover, they are
eligible for a month of paid prenatal leave
and six months of post-natal leave, she
said.
In Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, on the
other hand, women cannot vote and have
to keep themselves covered at all times,
Delaney said. Female Iraqi students are
for the most part uncovered and wear
western attire, she added.
Delaney also mentioned that some
Kuwaiti men practice serial polygamy. "Is
that the kind of men that American

women want to support and die for?" she
questioned.
"If we are in the Gulf to defend Amer
ican freedom, we have to .. . see what
social regimes we defend," Delaney
exhorted.
She further characterized the media's
coverage of women in the crisis as "con
flictuaE" Delaney said the media focused
on helpless female hostages and children
but gave little attention to women who
serve in the armed forces or stayed in
Kuwait to defend the U.S. Embassy.
History Prof. Ciayborne Carson said
U.S. behavior must be examined in the
context of multiculturalism. How this
country behaves toward non-European
countries has often been "brutal," he
said.
Carson mentioned the ironic reality
that United States foreign intervention in

the past resulted in a large number of
non-whites being killed, so that peace and
democracy could only be enjoyed by those
who lived.
He said many have criticized the Viet
nam War because the U.S. employed black
troops to fight for democracy, which was
denied them at home.
Carson observed there has not been a
lot of emphasis on the racial composition
of forces in the Middle East. The armed
forces is the only area where the educa
tion level of blacks is higher than that of
whites, he said.
He explained there is no great public
outcry against U.S. deployment in the
Gulf region because the draft was abol
ished after the Vietnam War. "The army
is a professional one and becoming a mer
cenary one," he said.
Khalil Barboum, a senior lecturer in

linguistics, said race implications play a
part in American sentiment against
Iraq's possible use of chemical weapons.
He said it is a racist assertion that some
weapons are more dangerous in Arab
hands than under the control of others.
"I can't see how chemicals are more
horrible than the cluster bombs that
Israel uses," he said.
Barboum said the position of Arabs
has been dealt with "almost as an
afterthought" by westerners because of
their obsession with Saddam Hussein'u
"demonized" image.
History Assoc. Prof. Joel Beinin agreed
that the U.S. deployment is about oil and
not democracy. He said Saudi Arabia has
been a consistent "price dove" in OPEC,
controlling the oil industries in accor
dance with U.S. interest.
