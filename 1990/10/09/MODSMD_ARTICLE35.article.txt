# Rally kicks off teach-in against U.S. involvement in Persian Gulf
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
A sparsely attended noon rally in White Plaza
kicked off yesterday's "Middle East Teach-in," a
series of speeches, panel discussions and workshops
directed against U.S. intervention in the Persian
Gulf.
Sponsored by the Peninsula Peace Center in Palo
Alto and other campus groups, the opening event
featured David Harris, a former Stanford student
body president and anti-war organizer.
With more passion than organization, Harris
excoriated U.S. presence in the Gulf region. "The
people of Iraq deserve much better," he asserted. "I
[lie] awake at night and I can't believe they are actu
ally doing it."
"We are dealing with hypocrisy," he said. Harris is
currently a free-lance journalist.
Peggy Tuxen, who served as a nurse in the Viet
nam War and founded the Veterans Speakers
Alliance, said war is "immoral and unjustifiable."
Tuxen described in detail her experiences in Viet
nam that caused her to oppose the current military
intervention. "Maggots crawled in the wounds" of
soldiers, she said, urging listeners to picture some of

the gruesome scenes she witnessed in Vietnam.
Ben Olguin, a second year graduate student, crit
icized the over-representation of the poor and people
of color on the battle fields.
He described how some Chicano families have
three photos in their homes: Benito Juarez, John F.
Kennedy and a photo of a son killed in a previous
war.
Eduardo Cohen, a Vietnam War veteran, reproved
the American government for deception. "When a
country goes to war, the first casualty is truth,"he
said.
Cohen added that the media are accomplices in
that deception. "Today's news media are cheerlead
ers for the Pentagon," he said.
Various workshops held later in the afternoon at
the Law School reflected similar anti-war senti
ments.
One of the workshops, "The Draft and You," ques
tioned the necessity and equality of the draft, which
could be implemented now with the prospect of war.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg began by saying the
Selective Service system is problem-ridden. "All
back-burner issues such as student deferments and
gender issues will be rediscovered if a draft occurs,"
he said.

"Many of my students may . . . find it intellectu
ally necessary to argue against any exemptions to
the draft system," he added.
Fred Moore, a draft resister who was imprisoned
for two years for his vocal opposition to the Vietnam
War, said a draft is not likely because the United
States wants quick wars. The draft is a long-term
project that gives too many people too much time for
introspection and possible resistance to the war
effort, he said.
Despite this, Moore said the government is cur
rently trying to numb the American people's resis
tance to the draft.
"The Selective Service system is a farce," said
Moore. "The whole program is a sham. It only exists
to scare people and instill patriotism."
Moore criticized the current government policy
requiring students to register with Selective Service
in order to receive federal funds and college loans.
"The decision to oppose the draft is too great a deci
sion for young people to have to make," he said.
U.S. intervention in the Middle East was also
examined and opposed from a conservative stand
point in another workshop.
Speaking to an audience of about 35 people at a
workshop titled "Why Conservatives Should Oppose

U.S. Intervention in the Middle East," Williamson
Evers criticized President Bush's policies in the Gulf
as being "blatantly unconstitutional."
Evers, a Hoover scholar and member of the
recently formed Committee to Avert a Mideast Holo
caust, said any blockade of the sort that Bush has
imposed is unequivocally "an act of war."
Evers further criticized the Bush Administration
for bypassing Congress in ordering troops to Saudi
Arabia, despite its "original intent" interpretation of
the Constitution.
Evers, former chair of California's Libertarian
party, defined Libertarianism as a "political view
point that believes individual liberty and freedom to
be the primary political good."
Evers said he agreed with prominent conserva
tives Jean Kirkpatrick and Patrick Buchanan that
no vital national interests in the Gulf were threat
ened despite the media's emphasizing the contrary.
"It is George Bush and not Saddam Hussein who
has raised the price of oil," he said.
Evers attacked liberals who say a "new world
order" necessitates U.S. intervention in foreign
countries to uphold "freedom" and "justice." He said
conservatives are angry "at the surrender of U.S.
sovereignty" to the United Nations.

soldiers, she said, urging listeners to picture some of

the gruesome scenes she witnessed in Vietnam.
Ben Olguin, a second year graduate student, crit
icized the over-representation of the poor and people
of color on the battle fields.
He described how some Chicano families have
three photos in their homes: Benito Juarez, John F.
Kennedy and a photo of a son killed in a previous
war.
Eduardo Cohen, a Vietnam War veteran, reproved
the American government for deception. "When a
country goes to war, the first casualty is truth,"he
said.
Cohen added that the media are accomplices in
that deception. "Today's news media are cheerlead
ers for the Pentagon," he said.
Various workshops held later in the afternoon at
the Law School reflected similar anti-war senti
ments.
One of the workshops, "The Draft and You," ques
tioned the necessity and equality of the draft, which
could be implemented now with the prospect of war.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg began by saying the
Selective Service system is problem-ridden. "All
back-burner issues such as student deferments and
gender issues will be rediscovered if a draft occurs,"
he said.

"Many of my students may . . . find it intellectu
ally necessary to argue against any exemptions to
the draft system," he added.
Fred Moore, a draft resister who was imprisoned
for two years for his vocal opposition to the Vietnam
War, said a draft is not likely because the United
States wants quick wars. The draft is a long-term
project that gives too many people too much time for
introspection and possible resistance to the war
effort, he said.
Despite this, Moore said the government is cur
rently trying to numb the American people's resis
tance to the draft.
"The Selective Service system is a farce," said
Moore. "The whole program is a sham. It only exists
to scare people and instill patriotism."
Moore criticized the current government policy
requiring students to register with Selective Service
in order to receive federal funds and college loans.
"The decision to oppose the draft is too great a deci
sion for young people to have to make," he said.
U.S. intervention in the Middle East was also
examined and opposed from a conservative stand
point in another workshop.
Speaking to an audience of about 35 people at a
workshop titled "Why Conservatives Should Oppose

U.S. Intervention in the Middle East," Williamson
Evers criticized President Bush's policies in the Gulf
as being "blatantly unconstitutional."
Evers, a Hoover scholar and member of the
recently formed Committee to Avert a Mideast Holo
caust, said any blockade of the sort that Bush has
imposed is unequivocally "an act of war."
Evers further criticized the Bush Administration
for bypassing Congress in ordering troops to Saudi
Arabia, despite its "original intent" interpretation of
the Constitution.
Evers, former chair of California's Libertarian
party, defined Libertarianism as a "political view
point that believes individual liberty and freedom to
be the primary political good."
Evers said he agreed with prominent conserva
tives Jean Kirkpatrick and Patrick Buchanan that
no vital national interests in the Gulf were threat
ened despite the media's emphasizing the contrary.
"It is George Bush and not Saddam Hussein who
has raised the price of oil," he said.
Evers attacked liberals who say a "new world
order" necessitates U.S. intervention in foreign
countries to uphold "freedom" and "justice." He said
conservatives are angry "at the surrender of U.S.
sovereignty" to the United Nations.
