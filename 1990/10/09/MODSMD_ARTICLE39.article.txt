# Students in the dark about where to burn the midnight oil
## 
### Steve Mitzenmacher 
It's 1:30 a.m. and tomorrow's midterm is
approaching rapidly. There are still 300
pages to read, a problem set to complete
and an outline to write. Yet this has little
effect on the rowdy dormmates next-door,
who are celebrating, drinking and blasting
their music.
For many Stanford students, late night
studying is impossible because no suitable
facilities are open past midnight. While
other universities provide staggered library
hours or all-night study centers to ensure
quiet spots to study, students here are on
their own after midnight to find areas to
work.
"Last Sunday Tresidder was closed by 8
p.m., the Creamery is history and the Cof
fee House is too dark and noisy to get any
work done," senior Laura Powell said.
"It should be the University's responsi
bility to provide places to study," she added.
Green Library, Meyer Library and
Tresidder Union, three of the most com
mon study spots for undergraduate stu
dents, close nightly at midnight. Although
History Corner remains open late into the
night, the doors are locked at midnight,
making entry difficult for latecomers.

"lf you want to study late at night, you
have to go to Denny's," complained senior
Katie Birmingham.
Stanford is unique in its failure to pro
vide late night facilities. UC-San Diego, for
example, has a 24-hour student union
equipped for study.
Tresidder extended its hours this year to
midnight, after having closed as early as 10
or 11 p.m. in previous years.
Yet Tresidder director Bobbi Braden said
keeping the building open around the clock
would be impossible. "It is after midnight
that we clean Tresidder, and at that time
need for the building to be empty," she said.
"The issues of security and staffing are
also important. With funding cut by nearly
20 percent, it is not economically feasible to
maintain adequate security within the
building," she added.
Braden explained that reduced hours of
utility use saves money. "Electricity, heat
ing and air conditioning all add up to a
tremendous cost to the University."
Economics defines Stanford's library
policies as well.
Cathy Fehrn, office manager of Meyer
Library, sees budget cuts as a major cause
of the early library closures. "When budget
cuts occur in libraries, hours are the first to

go, as it is an easy and effective solution,"
Fehrn said.
Fehrn also reported that when Meyer
remained open until 2 a.m. as an experi
ment during one dead week and finals
week, there was little student demand.
"There were only three or four people in the
building at a time, and it was just not
worthwhile to staff the library." Meyer cur
rently remains open until 1 a.m. during
dead and finals weeks.
Karen Nagy, acting director of Meyer
and the Research Branch Libraries, also
expresses the difficulty in making changes
with a limited budget.
"In the last four years, library hours
have actually been extended from the past,"
she said. "Under the recent constraints of
budget and staffing, I would be surprised to
see the library hours continue to change for
the better."
Other universities provide alternative
plans that allow for extended library hours.
Harvard University operates library hours
on a rotating basis where one of three
undergraduate libraries remains open until
1 a.m. daily. Each dormitory also maintains
a small "house library," open 24 hours a
day, allowing for quiet study.
