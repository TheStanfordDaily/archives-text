# Reservoir cited as water waster

Despite the ongoing drought,
the Palo Alto Water Department
has wasted an estimated 200,000
to 400,000 gallons of water during
the past six months from a leaking
reservoir on Stanford land.
The Mayfield Reservoir, which
stores about 4 million gallons of
water, is located in the faculty
housing neighborhood on campus
and is run by the Palo Alto Water
Department.
Since April, it has been wasting
between 1,200 and 2,400 gallons

of water every day, according to
estimates by Raymond Levitt, a
Stanford civil engineering profes
sor who lives near the reservoir.
According to Dick Franklin, a
worker for the water department,
the October, 1989 earthquake
loosened the joints on the bottom
of the reservoir. In order to repair
these joints, the water level was
lowered substantially so workers
could go into the reservoir and
repair the damaged joints.
After the damage was repaired,
the reservoir was refilled, and
engineers from the water depart

ment did a leakage test on the
joints, which failed. In order to
repair them, they had to once
again lower the reservoir's water
level.
Levitt and Chemistry Prof.
James Collman both live in fac
ulty residences located near the
reservoir.
The professors said they heard
the loud sound of running water
about six months ago. After fur
ther investigation, they realized
the water was coming from a pipe
