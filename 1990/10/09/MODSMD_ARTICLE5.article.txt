# Reservoir cited as water waster

Despite the ongoing drought,
the Palo Alto Water Department
has wasted an estimated 200,000
to 400,000 gallons of water during
the past six months from a leaking
reservoir on Stanford land.
The Mayfield Reservoir, which
stores about 4 million gallons of
water, is located in the faculty
housing neighborhood on campus
and is run by the Palo Alto Water
Department.
Since April, it has been wasting
between 1,200 and 2,400 gallons

of water every day, according to
estimates by Raymond Levitt, a
Stanford civil engineering profes
sor who lives near the reservoir.
According to Dick Franklin, a
worker for the water department,
the October, 1989 earthquake
loosened the joints on the bottom
of the reservoir. In order to repair
these joints, the water level was
lowered substantially so workers
could go into the reservoir and
repair the damaged joints.
After the damage was repaired,
the reservoir was refilled, and
engineers from the water depart

ment did a leakage test on the
joints, which failed. In order to
repair them, they had to once
again lower the reservoir's water
level.
Levitt and Chemistry Prof.
James Collman both live in fac
ulty residences located near the
reservoir.
The professors said they heard
the loud sound of running water
about six months ago. After fur
ther investigation, they realized
the water was coming from a pipe
out of the reservoir. Levitt esti
mated that between 50 and 100
gallons of water were going from
the pipe into the storm drain
every hour. The flow ran at vary
ing rates until last week.
Levitt said he thinks the water
may be coming from one of two
places. One possibility is that the
water is from a leaky joint
between a pipe and the reservoir
wall. If this is the case, it could
mean the reservoir is in danger of
rupturing during an earthquake,
he said.
The other possibility is that the
water is coming from a faulty con
trol pipe used to dispose of
"excess" water, Levitt said.
Collman said he called the

water department to complain
about the situation and try to find
out why all of this water was being
sent down the storm drain. How
ever, no one at the department
came out to inspect the site. After
he called the department once
again, Collman contacted a Palo
Alto newspaper which refused to
write an article about the situa
tion.
In response to an inquiry by
The Daily, the department's direc
tor of operations, Roger Jensen,
inspected the site Friday. He said
he and department workers have
considerably reduced the amount
of water being wasted, but cannot
totally stop the flow until a dam
aged hydraulic control valve is
replaced.
Jensen said he was not aware
of Collman's previous calls to the
water department.
