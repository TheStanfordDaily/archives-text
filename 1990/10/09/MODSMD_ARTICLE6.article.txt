# Easy access
## Long distance codes may not be sufficiently secure 
### Tracy Clay 
"Hello, Forsythe Hall. May I help you?" says the
Communication Services receptionist.
"Yes, I'd like my personal access code. My name is
Jane Stanford, my I.D. is 9876543 and my birth date
is 10/9/70."
"Thank you. Your code is 123-4567."
Anyone can receive an access code over the phone
with only three pieces of identifying information â€”
student I.D. number, birth date and place.
According to Communication Services spokesper
son Ann Crowley the phone-in service was imple
mented for the convenience of students.
Communication Services disburses personal codes
for access to long-distance calling under the new
University phone system.
However convenient this phone-in pickup may be,
it may also be unsafe. This system opens up the pos
sibility of people gaining students' access codes with

little identifying information.
A Daily reporter was able to call the telephone
information service and obtain the code of another
student, even without the proper identification.
Crowley, when informed of this breach in securi
ty, did not seem disturbed. She insisted that three
pieces of identification were adequate safeguard, and
pointed out that Communication Services has had no
complaints either this year or last year, when the
University phone system was tested on students in
Roble Hall.
A greater problem, Crowley admitted, occurs
when "shrewd students" accurately guess other peo
ple's codes. It happens frequently, she said.
In order to stop guessers, the Communication
Services office runs weekly checks that note how fre
quently a code has been used. In case of excessive
use, the owner is contacted. A new code is issued if
there is a problem.
