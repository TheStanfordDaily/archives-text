## Maguire offers hope for N. Ireland

Describing her as "tiny and
power-packed," Joan Baez intro
duced Mairead Corrigan Maguire,
co-recipient of the 1977 Nobel
Peace Prize. Barely reaching the
microphone, Maguire, one of the
three founders of the Community
of the Peace People in Northern
Ireland, spoke in Annenberg
Auditorium last night.
Advocating social change
through nonviolence, Maguire
stressed that the problem North
ern Ireland is facing is not one of
religion, but one of human rights.
Speaking about Northern Ire
land, where two-thirds of the pop
ulation is "from the British tradi
tion" and one-third of the popula
tion is "of the Gaelic Nationalist
Catholic tradition," Maguire
described a society that denies the
minority community its basic civil
rights.
"The violence of the British is
coming into our streets," she said.
"We are plunged into a daily dose
of murder."
Maguire said she felt the costs
of war when her sister's three
young children were killed while
caught in a 1976 clash between
the Irish Republican Army and
British troops. This incident
prompted her to found Peace Peo
ple.
"We don't hate each other,"
asserted Maguire, addressing the
division between the Catholics
and the Protestants. "The one
driving force in Northern Ireland
is that of fear between the two
traditions."
"One (community) is afraid
that the other will take over," she
said. "We need to turn fear into a
positive force for change in the
world. That is the way of nonvio
lence."
Peace People includes both
Catholics and Protestants, and

members try to find nonviolent
solutions to the problems of
Northern Ireland.
They began with the Youth for
Peace Movement, introducing
teenagers from the opposing com
munities to each other, and hav
ing them spend a week together in
Norway so that they can become
friends and see that "the enemy is
just like themselves."
Peace People is working to
repeal the emergency laws the
British police have imposed upon
the Catholic population. Justice
under the emergency laws is
meted out of a one-judge, juryless
court. Many Catholics claim they
have been convicted by confes
sions they signed under duress.
Maguire spoke of a boy who
told her he signed a confession
because "he was badly beaten and
would have signed anything."
Reaching for a broader mes
sage, Maguire spoke emphatically
about the need to direct resources
toward environmental issues, the
Third World hunger problem and
homelessness instead of toward
nuclear weapons.
"We must work for disarma
ment," said Maguire. "We can't
destroy the knowledge for creat
ing nuclear weapons, but we can
destroy the lie that has been
planted in the human mind that
we can kill each other. That is a lie
... Life is a gift."
Maguire went on to denounce
the U.S. presence in the Middle
East and emphasized the need for
the United States to withdraw.
"Ten million die in Ethiopia
and we turn our heads," Maguire
said incredulously. "And the best
resources, the best men and the
best women are sent to save oil.
Because it is not [the policy mak
ers] who will die, it is the young
men and young women who will
die in the Middle East. It is the
Iraqis who will die."
