director, highlighted two potential benefits of
the change. "We hope this will help the stu

The Network for Student Information will
design the program as part of a larger system
which will allow students to access informa

for courses via computers throughout campus.
The Housing Center program will be
included as part of the Student Access System
next year. It may also be available as part of a

spring pilot program, but that remains uncer

The switch to the computerized system will
be accompanied by changes in several key
