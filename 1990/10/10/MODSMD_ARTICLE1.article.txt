# Housing Draw to go computerized next year
## 
### Dylan Tyson 
Prompted by University budget cuts and
new computer technology, the Draw, the Grad
uate Housing Lottery and the Summer House
Allocation will all go high-tech next year.
The Housing Center is working on a sys
tem that will computerize housing preference
forms and ultimately assign Draw numbers by
computer, eliminating the need to draw num
bers in person.
Bill Georges, assistant Housing Center
director, highlighted two potential benefits of
the change. "We hope this will help the stu

dent who won't have to line up for the Draw,"
he said. "Additionally, it will help our office
eliminate clerical labor."
Excluding start-up costs, which have not
yet been determined, "we hope to save several
thousand dollars each year," Georges said.
The Network for Student Information will
design the program as part of a larger system
which will allow students to access informa
tion at the Office of the Registrar and register
for courses via computers throughout campus.
The Housing Center program will be
included as part of the Student Access System
next year. It may also be available as part of a

spring pilot program, but that remains uncer
tain, according to network programming man
ager Tim Flood.
"We will be starting development in the lat
ter part of November. [The Network for Stu
dent Information] and the Housing Center
will work through the winter on the pro
gram," Flood said.
"From a technical standpoint I do not per
ceive this as a very difficult change," he added.
The switch to the computerized system will
be accompanied by changes in several key

facets of the current housing sys
tem. Students will have two
weeks as opposed to three days to
file their housing preferences
before the Draw. In addition,
theme houses will now give their
special priority indications by
computers.
Furthermore, the guaranteed
housing allocation process will be
modified. Freshmen and transfer
students have traditionally
selected their two guaranteed
years in the winter quarter of
their first year on campus.
Because of a more favorable

housing situation, students will
be able to choose their guaranteed
years when they file their housing
preferences-
The Housing Center hopes the
new system will be part of the
spring pilot program. Because
only a small number of students
will participate, the pilot program
will not actually issue Draw num
bers but will test the the other
aspects of the system for future
use.
No part of the Draw is safe
from budget cutting. Students
will not be hired this year to plan
an inventive theme or decorate
the The Clubhouse's bare walls.
And, appropriately, the theme for
this year's Draw is "reposition
