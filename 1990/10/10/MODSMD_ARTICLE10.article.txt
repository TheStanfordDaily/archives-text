# Prof. outlines California's role in exploitation

### Anna Rabinowicz 
"The charge of genocide
against the state of California is
clear and unequivocal," Jack Nor
ton, a professor of American
Indian studies at Humboldt State
University in Areata, said in a
controlled yet fervent speech
Monday night.
In his speech, Norton, a mem
ber of the Hupa Reservation, dis
cussed the destruction of the
Native American people. His
speech continued the weeklong
celebration of the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization's 20th
anniversary.

A self-described "Hupa man,
spiritual dancer, academician and
na-tin-no-hay ku winyainan ho is
taiman (Hupa for 'Indian man'),"
Norton targeted 1992 as the
500 th anniversary of Columbus'
discovery of America and the
beginning of Native American suf
fering.
Patterns of exploitation of
native peoples were deeply rooted
in the ideology developed by early
American settlers, he said.
From 1850 to 1859, the Ameri
can government essentially paid
"semi-pro Indian killers" in Cali
fornia nearly $1 million to per
form "Indian hunts under the

guise of war," Norton said.
Newspapers, diaries of miners
and official records of pioneers
provide accounts of rapes, beat
ings and killings committed
against Native Americans by set
tlers in Northern California, he
said.
During this time, gold-diggers
took about 10,000 Northern Cali
fornian Indians into indentured
servitude. Bought for the price of
$2, indentured servants labored
for an average of 16 years, Norton
noted.
Norton said he blames society
— not individuals — for the denial
of Native Americans' civil rights.

When California achieved state
hood in September 1850, it was
believed that Native Americans
held no aboriginal title to the land
and therefore had no treaty
rights, he explained.
He said it is possible to under
stand the basis of modern injus
tice by studying the early tragedy
of the Native Americans. Norton
equated the exile and murder of
Native Americans with the
destruction of the Jews during the
Holocaust.
"Early patterns of genocide,
committed by the government and
its agencies, have been woven into
the pattern of modern society."
