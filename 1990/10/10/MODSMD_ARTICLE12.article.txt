Knifing rampage fuels fear in South Africa
DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — Blacks armed with knives went
on a rampage yesterday and stabbed eight whites, raising the
specter of new racial violence, authorities said.
About 20 young blacks stole knives from a store and began
stabbing people along a street near the beach, police said.
"They were in a berserk state and were lashing out with knives
at anyone who was near them," witness Robert Trulock told the
independent South African Press Association.
Two suspects were shot and wounded by police, and seven were
arrested, police said.
Despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in South
Africa, there have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking
whites.
Oil prices hit an all-time high
NEW YORK (AP) — Crude oil futures prices hit an all-time
high of $40.40 a barrel yesterday as angry rhetoric from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein escalated Middle East war fears.
Traders said the deaths of 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem on
Monday and Saddam's threat of retaliation fed a buying spree
that has nearly doubled oil prices on the futures market since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The price of light sweet crude — the key grade of U.S. oil —
closed up $1.45 at $40.40 per 42-gallon barrel for November deliv
ery after gaining nearly $1 on Monday. The previous record close
was $39.54 on Sept. 27, when crude reached $40.10 during the
day.
Futures prices don't translate directly to increases at the gas
pumps, but gasoline prces have risen steadily since the invasion.
A spot survey released yesterday by the American Automobile
Association found the average price of self-service gasoline hit
$1.37 per gallon last week, up 29.5 cents from the day before the
invasion.
Mexico scores huge coke bust
MEXICO CITY (AP) — The attorney general announced yes
terday that police had seized more than six tons of Colombian
cocaine base, the largest such confiscation in Mexican history.
Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said Colombia's
notorious Medellin cocaine cartel was trying to smuggle the drug
through southern Mexico into the United States.
Alvarez said police learned of a shipment of Colombian drugs in
Guatemala and traced it to the El Retiro ranch, 50 miles north
west of the Guatemalan border.
Alvarez said the haul totaled 12,760 pounds of 96 percent pure
cocaine base. He described the bust as "the largest in the history
of our country."
Greenpeace activists detained by Soviets
MOSCOW (AP) — Greenpeace complained yesterday that
Soviet officials were ignoring their requests about the fate of 34
activists and a ship seized by the KGB near a Soviet nuclear
weapons test site.
Those seized Monday included four activists who were last seen
heading toward the test site at Novaya Zemlya in the Barents Sea,
said Rebecca Johnson, spokeswoman for the world environmen
talist organization in London.
Greenpeace identified the four as Ted Wood of Hollywood,
Calif.; Jorn Haye of Germany; Jeane Ni Ghormain of Ireland; and
Bjoern Okem of Norway.
"We are being stonewalled by the Soviet authorities," Ms.
Johnson said. "Their refusal to answer to the status of our ship
parallels their refusal to talk about nuclear testing."
Doctor claims Michelangelo painted a brain
CHICAGO (AP) — Michelangelo's "Creation of Adam" painted
on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel contains an image
misunderstood for 478 years — a huge brain that symbolizes God
bestowing intellect on man, a doctor says.
The fresco, completed in 1512 for Pope Julius 11, shows Adam
and God reaching toward one another, arms outstretched, fingers
almost touching. Many scholars have interpreted the painting to
mean God bestowed life on man.
But Frank Lynn Meshberger, a doctor at St. John's Medical
Center in Anderson, Ind., says Adam's eyes are already open, sug
gesting he's alive. He contends Michelangelo intended the paint
ing to portray God giving man the gift of intellect.
"Look at the image that surrounds God and the angels," Mesh
berger wrote in today's Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion. "This image is the shape of a brain."
D.C. city council restricts Barry's powers
WASHINGTON (AP) — The District of Columbia Council
passed emergency legislation yesterday to restrict Mayor Marion
Barry's spending authority in his last weeks in office.
Approved by voice vote were proposals to restrict Barry's abil
ity to lease property or award construction projects for the dis
trict, and require the council to review any city contracts proposed
by Barry that exceed $1 million.
The temporary, 90-day statutes can take effect without the
mayor's signature and will expire six days after Barry leaves office
on Jan. 2.
"The fact of the matter is we just don't want the mayor to
spend any money," said council member John Ray. "That's the
emergency."
"What we are seeing looks like an attempt to get a lot of things
signed, sealed and delivered before Jan. 2," said council member
Betty Ann Kane, who sponsored the bill intended to restrict the
mayor's leasing authority.
Barry was convicted in federal court Aug. 10 of a misdemeanor
charge of cocaine possession.
Council chairman David Clarke sponsored the bill that would
empower the council to review all contracts for goods and services
that exceed $1 million. Previously, the council could only review
proposed renewal of such contracts.

"They were in a berserk state and were lashing out with knives
at anyone who was near them," witness Robert Trulock told the
independent South African Press Association.
Two suspects were shot and wounded by police, and seven were
arrested, police said.
Despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in South
Africa, there have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking
whites.
Oil prices hit an all-time high
NEW YORK (AP) — Crude oil futures prices hit an all-time
high of $40.40 a barrel yesterday as angry rhetoric from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein escalated Middle East war fears.
Traders said the deaths of 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem on
Monday and Saddam's threat of retaliation fed a buying spree
that has nearly doubled oil prices on the futures market since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The price of light sweet crude — the key grade of U.S. oil —
closed up $1.45 at $40.40 per 42-gallon barrel for November deliv
ery after gaining nearly $1 on Monday. The previous record close
was $39.54 on Sept. 27, when crude reached $40.10 during the
day.
Futures prices don't translate directly to increases at the gas
pumps, but gasoline prces have risen steadily since the invasion.
A spot survey released yesterday by the American Automobile
Association found the average price of self-service gasoline hit
$1.37 per gallon last week, up 29.5 cents from the day before the
invasion.
Mexico scores huge coke bust
MEXICO CITY (AP) — The attorney general announced yes
terday that police had seized more than six tons of Colombian
cocaine base, the largest such confiscation in Mexican history.
Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said Colombia's
notorious Medellin cocaine cartel was trying to smuggle the drug
through southern Mexico into the United States.
Alvarez said police learned of a shipment of Colombian drugs in
Guatemala and traced it to the El Retiro ranch, 50 miles north
west of the Guatemalan border.
Alvarez said the haul totaled 12,760 pounds of 96 percent pure
cocaine base. He described the bust as "the largest in the history
of our country."
Greenpeace activists detained by Soviets
MOSCOW (AP) — Greenpeace complained yesterday that
Soviet officials were ignoring their requests about the fate of 34
activists and a ship seized by the KGB near a Soviet nuclear
weapons test site.
Those seized Monday included four activists who were last seen
heading toward the test site at Novaya Zemlya in the Barents Sea,
said Rebecca Johnson, spokeswoman for the world environmen
talist organization in London.
Greenpeace identified the four as Ted Wood of Hollywood,
Calif.; Jorn Haye of Germany; Jeane Ni Ghormain of Ireland; and
Bjoern Okem of Norway.
"We are being stonewalled by the Soviet authorities," Ms.
Johnson said. "Their refusal to answer to the status of our ship
parallels their refusal to talk about nuclear testing."
Doctor claims Michelangelo painted a brain
CHICAGO (AP) — Michelangelo's "Creation of Adam" painted
on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel contains an image
misunderstood for 478 years — a huge brain that symbolizes God
bestowing intellect on man, a doctor says.
The fresco, completed in 1512 for Pope Julius 11, shows Adam
and God reaching toward one another, arms outstretched, fingers
almost touching. Many scholars have interpreted the painting to
mean God bestowed life on man.
But Frank Lynn Meshberger, a doctor at St. John's Medical
Center in Anderson, Ind., says Adam's eyes are already open, sug
gesting he's alive. He contends Michelangelo intended the paint
ing to portray God giving man the gift of intellect.
"Look at the image that surrounds God and the angels," Mesh
berger wrote in today's Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion. "This image is the shape of a brain."
D.C. city council restricts Barry's powers
WASHINGTON (AP) — The District of Columbia Council
passed emergency legislation yesterday to restrict Mayor Marion
Barry's spending authority in his last weeks in office.
Approved by voice vote were proposals to restrict Barry's abil
ity to lease property or award construction projects for the dis
trict, and require the council to review any city contracts proposed
by Barry that exceed $1 million.
The temporary, 90-day statutes can take effect without the
mayor's signature and will expire six days after Barry leaves office
on Jan. 2.
"The fact of the matter is we just don't want the mayor to
spend any money," said council member John Ray. "That's the
emergency."
"What we are seeing looks like an attempt to get a lot of things
signed, sealed and delivered before Jan. 2," said council member
Betty Ann Kane, who sponsored the bill intended to restrict the
mayor's leasing authority.
Barry was convicted in federal court Aug. 10 of a misdemeanor
charge of cocaine possession.
Council chairman David Clarke sponsored the bill that would
empower the council to review all contracts for goods and services
that exceed $1 million. Previously, the council could only review
proposed renewal of such contracts.

Knifing rampage fuels fear in South Africa
DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — Blacks armed with knives went
on a rampage yesterday and stabbed eight whites, raising the
