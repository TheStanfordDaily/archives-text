# Naval academy releases report on harassment
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sexual
harassment of female students at
the Naval Academy is widespread,
and some victims don't complain
openly for fear of reprisal, accord
ing to an internal academy report
released yesterday.
"In such a climate it is not sur
prising that some midshipmen
have lost the ability to distinguish
a blatant incident of sexual
harassment from routine
pranks," it said.
The report by a seven-member
panel of academy faculty, military
staff and midshipmen said imme
diate action is needed to correct
the conditions allowing mistreat
ment of women.
"Most midshipmen readily
acknowledge women midshipmen
are not accepted as equals in the

[academy]," said the report by the
academy's Women Midshipmen
Study Group. "This lack of accep
tance has created an environment
in which steady, low-level sexual
harassment passes as normal
operating procedure in company
areas and classrooms alike."
The report was one of several
special inquiries prompted by a
hazing incident at the academy
last December in which a female
student was handcuffed by male
midshipmen to a urinal as other
men jeered and took photographs.
The woman, Gwen M. Dreyer, a
second-year student, resigned
from the academy last May, citing
her humiliation and anger at the
way the academy responded to it.
The Navy yesterday released
copies of the internal report as

well as other studies that were
reviewed by a special committee
appointed by the academy's Board
of Visitors. The committee was
comprised of Board Chairman
James M. Cannon, Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md.; Rep. Helen D.
Bentley, R-Md., and other out
siders.
Mrs. Mikulski issued a state
ment urging swift action to cor
rect conditions at the Annapolis
institution.
"There is a real and continuing
problem at the U.S. Naval
Academy," she said. "Women are
neither accepted as equals nor
treated with respect. The Annapo
lis administration — from the top
down — must act swiflly and deci
sively to end this harassment."
Mrs. Mikulski said she was

troubled by the investigators'
finding that a vocal minority of
midshipmen, officers, staff and
graduates believe women should
not be midshipmen.
"This attitude is antiquated,
unrealistic and unacceptable/'
she said.
At the Pentagon, Navy Secre
tary H. Lawrence Garrett 111 said
"prompt action will be forthcom
ing" to address the concerns
raised by the inquiry reports.
"I am confident that as the
result of these exhaustive studies,
necessary corrective actions will
enable the Naval Academy to
build on its impressive 145-year
history with a renewed sense of
purpose and mission," Garrett
said in a written statement.
