# U.S. will vote against Israel in U.N.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Bush administration, after day
long negotiations at the United
Nations, has decided to cast its
vote against Israel in criticism of
the slaying of at least 19 Pales
tinian Arabs in a Jerusalem
melee, U.S. officials said yester
day.
U.S. officials said it was the
first time the United States had
supported a U.N. resolution criti
cizing Israel since the Israeli inva
sion of Lebanon in 1982.
The resolution, drafted by
American diplomats, was adopted
by the four other permanent
members of the U.N. Security
Council and is thus veto-proof, the
officials told The Associated
Press.
It condemns the violence that
broke out Monday "and particu
larly the excessive Israeli
response," the officials said.
The resolution also welcomes
the decision by U.N. Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
send a delegation to Jerusalem to
investigate the incident.
The officials said the resolution
calls on all parties to refrain from
violence. In a gesture to Israel, it
expresses regret that worshipers
also were attacked.
The United States rarely votes
against Israel in the Security
Council. Far more frequently, it
uses its veto power to shield Israel
against what is judged to be unfair
criticism.
But, in this instance, the offi
cials said, the Bush administra
tion concluded Israeli policemen
used excessive force against Pales
tinian Arabs who hurled rocks
and bottles at Jews praying at the
Western Wall.
President Bush said Israeli
security forces should have acted
"with more restraint" in battling
Palestinian demonstrators out
side the holy Temple Mount in
Jerusalem.
"I am very, very saddened by
this needless loss of life," he said
at a news conference.
Bush added: "Israeli security
forces need to be better prepared
for such situations, need to act

with greater restraint, particu
larly when it comes to the use of
deadly force."
At least 19 Arabs were killed
and more than 100 wounded Sun
day during an hour-long battle
outside A 1 Aksa mosque as thou
sands of Arabs threw rocks and
bottles at Jews praying at the
Western Wall below. Eleven Jews
observing the festival of Succot
were hurt in the barrage.
At the United Nations, a repre
sentative from occupied Kuwait
joined his rival from Iraq and
more than 30 speakers in con
demning Israel's treatment of
Palestinians and demanding that
Israeli withdraw from territories

captured in the 1967 Middle East
war.
"We know full well the bitter
ness and sufferings of the
unarmed Palestinian people
under occupation, because we are
passing through a similar experi
ence," said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad
al-Jaber al-Sabah of Kuwait.
Iraq's deputy permanent envoy
Sabah Talat Kadrat accused the
United States and its allies of
"hypocrisy" for shielding Israel
over the years and failing to con
demn and punish Israel for vio
lence against Palestinians.
During his news conference,
Bush appealed for "calm on all
sides" and three times referred to

"the Palestine question" as need
ing a solution. Previous presi
dents are not known to have used
the phrase.
Arabs and their supporters
long have demanded the estab
lishment of a state called Pales
tine on Israeli-held land. Bush's
Mideast policy deals with East
Jerusalem, Gaza and the West
Bank as occupied territory but has
been opposed to Palestinian state
hood.
Bush did not intend to signal
anything with the phrase and
there is "no change in policy,"
Roman Popadiuk, the deputy
White House press secretary, srid.
