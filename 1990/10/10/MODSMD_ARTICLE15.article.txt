# Bush backs away from a tax trade-off
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush appeared to open the
door yesterday to higher income
taxes on the wealthy as part of a
budget compromise but later
abandoned that strategy under
pressure from Republican sena
tors, senators and officials said.
The quick turnabout came
after Bush met with GOP sena
tors and was told not to try to
trade lower capital gains taxes,
which he wants, for higher income
taxes on the wealthiest Ameri
cans, which Democrats want.
Bush initially voiced a new
readiness to bargain with congres
sional Democrats on the long-divi
sive tax issue after signing a tem
porary spending bill that ended a
three-day government shutdown.
The agreement gives Congress
until Oct. 19 to come up with a
new $500 billion, five-year deficit
reduction package.
At a morning news conference,
Bush had said — for the first time
— he could accept higher income
taxes on affluent taxpayers "at
some level" if it were coupled with
a reduction in capital gains taxes.
However, Republican leaders
warned Bush away from that idea.
After a late afternoon meeting
between Bush and GOP lawmak
ers, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.,
said, "We all put up our hands and
said, 'no deal on [tax] rates at all.'
He [Bush] just acquiesced in it."
Capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of assets such as
houses or corporate stock, cur
rently are taxed at the same rate
as ordinary income. The adminis
tration has argued that a lower
tax rate would stimulate the econ
omy; Democrats have countered
that most of the benefits would go
to the wealthy.
Although he declined to discuss
details at the news conference,
Bush had clearly indicated he
could support a compromise cou
pling higher taxes on the wealthi
est Americans in exchange for the
cut in capital-gains tax rates that
he has long sought.
"That's on the table. That's
been talked about. And if it's
proper, if it can be worked in
proper balance between the capi
tal gains rate and income tax
changes, fine," Bush said.
But later, Republican leaders
said they cautioned Bush against
pursuing such a trade, suggesting
Democrats would never agree to
drop capital gains taxe rates low
enough to make the bargain
worthwhile.
"The president agreed. Our

uniform position was that we will
not go up on the [income tax]
rates, no matter what," said Pack
wood, the senior Republican on
the Senate Finance Committee.
He said Bush asked the Senate
GOP leaders at the meeting if
they would hold fast to such a
position. "And to the man in the
room, every single person said we
will support that," Packwood said.
"Stop trying to buy us off with
capital gains. We're not going to
change that summit agreement,"
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
at a remark directed at
Democrats.
A senior administration offi
cial, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that Bush told
the GOP leaders that he did not
want to raise the marginal tax
rate — that is, the tax rate on the
last extra dollar of income, some
times called the "tax bracket" —
if he couldn't get a capital gains
rate cut at "an acceptable level."
"These guys said, 'you're not
going to get it' and he [Bush] said,
'fine, we don't need either one of
them. ... there's nothing in it for
us,"' the official said.
"Basically what they told him
was you're not going to get the
kind of capital gains [cut] you
want. The president said he didn't
want to raise the rates and the
conclusion was to forget all of it —
capital gains and the change in
the top rate."
Senate Msgority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, earlier hailed
Bush's seeming turnabout.
"I have personally advocated
[an increased tax rate] on those
making more than $200,000 a
year for some time. And I'm
pleased that the president has
now come around, or apparently
come around, to our point of view
and to recognize fairness of such a
change," Mitchell said.
And aides to Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of
the tax-writing Senate Finance
Committee, said he would ask the
panel to accept the idea.
After vetoing an earlier stopgap
spending bill on Saturday, Bush
gave his early morning signature
to a new temporary spending bill
that keeps the government oper
ating until Oct. 19 while Congress
tries to come up with the budget
accord.
Bush said he signed the new
measure while vetoing the first
one because both chambers subse
quently had passed a framework
budget agreement.

capital gains. We're not going to
change that summit agreement,"
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
at a remark directed at
Democrats.
A senior administration offi
cial, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that Bush told
the GOP leaders that he did not
want to raise the marginal tax
rate — that is, the tax rate on the
last extra dollar of income, some
times called the "tax bracket" —
if he couldn't get a capital gains
rate cut at "an acceptable level."
"These guys said, 'you're not
going to get it' and he [Bush] said,
'fine, we don't need either one of
them. ... there's nothing in it for
us,"' the official said.
"Basically what they told him
was you're not going to get the
kind of capital gains [cut] you
want. The president said he didn't
want to raise the rates and the
conclusion was to forget all of it —
capital gains and the change in
the top rate."
Senate Msgority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, earlier hailed
Bush's seeming turnabout.
"I have personally advocated
[an increased tax rate] on those
making more than $200,000 a
year for some time. And I'm
pleased that the president has
now come around, or apparently
come around, to our point of view
and to recognize fairness of such a
change," Mitchell said.
And aides to Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of
the tax-writing Senate Finance
Committee, said he would ask the
panel to accept the idea.
After vetoing an earlier stopgap
spending bill on Saturday, Bush
gave his early morning signature
to a new temporary spending bill
that keeps the government oper
ating until Oct. 19 while Congress
tries to come up with the budget
accord.
Bush said he signed the new
measure while vetoing the first
one because both chambers subse
quently had passed a framework
budget agreement.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush appeared to open the
door yesterday to higher income
taxes on the wealthy as part of a
budget compromise but later
abandoned that strategy under
pressure from Republican sena
tors, senators and officials said.
The quick turnabout came
after Bush met with GOP sena
tors and was told not to try to
trade lower capital gains taxes,
which he wants, for higher income
taxes on the wealthiest Ameri
cans, which Democrats want.
Bush initially voiced a new
readiness to bargain with congres
sional Democrats on the long-divi
sive tax issue after signing a tem
porary spending bill that ended a
three-day government shutdown.
The agreement gives Congress
until Oct. 19 to come up with a
new $500 billion, five-year deficit
reduction package.
At a morning news conference,
Bush had said — for the first time
— he could accept higher income
taxes on affluent taxpayers "at
some level" if it were coupled with
a reduction in capital gains taxes.
However, Republican leaders
warned Bush away from that idea.
After a late afternoon meeting
between Bush and GOP lawmak
ers, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.,
said, "We all put up our hands and
said, 'no deal on [tax] rates at all.'
He [Bush] just acquiesced in it."
Capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of assets such as
houses or corporate stock, cur
rently are taxed at the same rate
as ordinary income. The adminis
tration has argued that a lower
tax rate would stimulate the econ
omy; Democrats have countered
that most of the benefits would go
to the wealthy.
Although he declined to discuss
details at the news conference,
Bush had clearly indicated he
could support a compromise cou
pling higher taxes on the wealthi
est Americans in exchange for the
cut in capital-gains tax rates that
he has long sought.
"That's on the table. That's
been talked about. And if it's
proper, if it can be worked in
proper balance between the capi
tal gains rate and income tax
changes, fine," Bush said.
But later, Republican leaders
said they cautioned Bush against
pursuing such a trade, suggesting
Democrats would never agree to
drop capital gains taxe rates low
enough to make the bargain
worthwhile.
"The president agreed. Our

uniform position was that we will
not go up on the [income tax]
rates, no matter what," said Pack
wood, the senior Republican on
the Senate Finance Committee.
He said Bush asked the Senate
GOP leaders at the meeting if
they would hold fast to such a
position. "And to the man in the
room, every single person said we
will support that," Packwood said.
"Stop trying to buy us off with
capital gains. We're not going to
change that summit agreement,"
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
at a remark directed at
Democrats.
