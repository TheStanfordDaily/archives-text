## Overhaul the bylaws 
### 
Graduate assu sena
tor Douglas Bone's Bylaw
Reform Bill, which was
passed last Thursday, corrected a
series of 200 to 300 technical
errors, several typos and even a
split infinitive.
But the senate shouldn't stop at
â€¢correcting minor technicalities in
the bylaws.
While Bone's bill was a good first
step, the ASSU needs to take a seri
ous look at the bylaws and begin a
more extensive overhaul of them.
Last year's Council of Presidents
election once again brought up
issue of the bylaws and their inter
pretations. In the debate over
whether to count write-in votes,
even the senators seemed unsure
on the meaning and the applicabil
ity of the bylaws.
To many, it appeared that not
counting some of the write-in votes
violated the bylaws. However, the
senate voted to disregard the
bylaws because they had not been
followed in the past.

On other issues, a senator often
picks up the bylaws at the last sec
ond and uses them to block a
motion or bill at his or her conve
nience.
Clearly, the ASSU needs a con
sistent, clear set of bylaws that it
universally applies and follows.
Bylaw reform could help prevent
some of the controversy and confu
sion of last year's elections from
happening again.
The ASSU could also create a
new officer who would be responsi
ble for knowing and upholding the
bylaws. And it could require sena
tors to prove they know and under
stand the bylaws, perhaps by tak
ing a quiz.
At the very least, senators need
to be aware of the bylaws and their
applications.
Reforming the ASSU Bylaws is a
commendable and necessary idea.
But even if they are clarified gram
matically, they will be useless if no
one reads them.
