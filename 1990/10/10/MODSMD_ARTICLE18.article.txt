# A 						disgrace at Flicks
## 
### 
Last sunday's flicks
were a disgrace. With stu
dents pushing and shoving,
and angry people being turned
away, the situation was out of con
trol.
It's a given that the first flick of
the year is always well-attended,
and while we cannot condemn the
ASSU for the heavy attendance at
late Flicks — it is difficult to pre
dict the turnout for any one show
ing — the Flicks staff should have
considered other options rather
than turning eager students away.
For example, a third showing,
either on Saturday or late Sunday
night, may be feasible for a popular
movie.
Many students were also out

raged that they were turned away
without compensation.
Flicks should consider giving
refunds to the people who were
turned away. It makes no sense
that people who purchased a pass
two weeks before the first movie be
denied entrance while Flicks
passes were still being sold at the
door.
Safety at Flicks is also an impor
tant issue that should be discussed.
With hundreds of people trying to
push through a single opening, the
potential of injury is great.
Flicks should hire more security
personnel to keep the crowd in line,
and perhaps also let people in
through the side door.
