Minorities should be considered for high-level positions

WHILE SERVING BRIEFLY ON
THE University's Affirmative
Action Council, I became
intrigued with the human resources con
cept of "succession management." I was
especially enlightened as to how the pro
gram had been exploited to the advan
tage of somfe, and to the exclusion of
"others."
Succession management would mean
that the University (and communities of
color here) would be planning ahead.
This would mean not reacting to
appointments with the customary disap
pointments that do not advance the
cause of affirmative action.
For example, a good succession man
agement plan would have had a list of
candidates instantly available to the
president as soon as the Athletic Direc
tor announced his intent to resign. (Iron
ically, when I first discussed this notion

about top-down succession management
with a Human Resources officer about a
year ago, I specifically used the Athletic
Director's position as an example.)
In discussing with the Council how
the concept could be used to encompass
people of color and the disabled, I chided
my colleagues about their focus on
lower-level positions that are exempt and
salaried.
My thought was to think in terms of
"the president's position down" into the
University's administrative structure, as
far as time and resources would allow,
given the fact that there are over 2000
positions that aren't covered by the pre
sent proposal.
Besides, succession management is
more likely to occur at the highest eche
lons and the leveraging effect of one's
effort at those levels over time would be
far greater.

If the effort is focused on the presi
dent's position down, the population is of
about 300 positions; certainly this size is
more manageable, given limited
resources.
The need for such an active, fre
quently updated, top-down plan is woe
fully reflected in the fact that few people
of color have ever been on the presi
dent's staff, or have ever reported
directly to the president — be they vice
presidents or directors — in the 99+
years of the University's existence.
Lord knows, Stanford has never had a
president who was a person of color, so
we should focus on that position for a
moment. (In the process of doing so, we
should pause to congratulate UC-Berke
ley for the appointment of Chiang-Lin
Tien as Chancellor.)
Human Resources should address this
position like the White House focuses on

the U.S. Supreme Court, by always
maintaining a list of future nominees for
referral to the University's Board of
Trustees at a moment's notice.
What better testimony to the Univer
sity's affirmative action program could
there be than the appointment of a per
son of color as the next president?
There is an ample supply of individu
als on and off campus who have demon
strated their ability to preside over Stan
ford. In addition, in that Stanford
desires to pursue a corporate model,
there are also individuals of color in cor
porate executive ranks who can fill the
bill.
The point is, who will be the next resi
dent of Hoover House?
What about a miracle on Mirada?
