# Flicks director says they are not to blame for Sunday's fiasco
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Chris
Wilson's letter concerning last Sunday's
Flick. For the benefit of Mr. Wilson and
the others, I would like to clarify the
Flicks pass distribution policy and
address last Sunday's situation.
• The passes were not oversold. 3000
passes are sold. Given that there are two
showings of each Sunday Flick, there are
over 3400 seats available.
• The passes are not restricted to one
shewing or another, so that Stanford
students retain their freedom to choose
which performance they will attend.
• However, in order to deal with the
contingency of everyone trying to attend
the same showing, the ASSU Flicks

employees must include the "First-Come,
First-Serve" policy.
• If, in fact, Flicks goers continue to
attend the 9:30 show, while leaving hun
dreds of empty seats for the 7:00 show,
then the option of free choice may have
to be suspended.
• Given the unfortunate circumstance
of last Sunday's 9:30 showing of "Pretty
Woman," our greatest disappointment
was that some Stanford students did not
behave with the civility and considera
tion (i.e. pushing and shoving) that
would be expected of them.
• Under great pressure, the Flicks
security staff did their best to control the
situation.
• To all those who had passes and
were unable to attend the 9:30 showing,
the Flicks staff would like to extend our
deepest apologies.
Robert Florsheim
Director, ASSU Sunday Flicks
