# Everyone can rise above the mediocre
## 
### 
• Congratulations to the Stanford foot
ball team for defeating No. 1 ranked
Notre Dame.
The fascinating thing about football is
that the game mirrors life. Therefore,
there are lessons here that should not be
lost.
The difference between "mediocrity"
and "No. 1" is often a lot smaller than
we think.
This is equally true when comparing
the employee to the CEO or the kid in
East Palo Alto to the Stanford kid driv
ing the BMW.
If someone classes you as "mediocre"
and you disagree enough to do something
about it, you can!
On the other hand, if you are "No. 1"
and you lose your humble perspective

(unlike Notre Dame), you may get a rude
awakening!
To rise above mediocrity takes long,
hard, coordinated work. Coordination
comes from communication and coopera
tion. These happen when people break
down barriers that separate them (social,
racial, organizational, etc.) and develop
an atmosphere of trust. Trust only hap
pens when people act honestly with each
other in an ethically responsible manner.
These are not new ideas. For example,
W. E. Deming taught trust and removing
barriers to the Japanese in the 19505.
They assimilated his philosophy into
their workplace culture and the rest is
economic history.
What is new is the classic example
from last weekend. If everyone takes a
few of these timeless lessons to heart,
then the world will be a lot better off.
