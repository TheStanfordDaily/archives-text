## To Ph.D. or not to Ph.D. 
### 
CC \ LL I HAVE LEFT is the disser
/\ tation," I explain brightly to my
JL Adubious uncle who hasn't seen
me since my eighth birthday, when I
wanted to be a fireman.
The self-contradictory quality of my
statement is slowly reflected in his puz
zled face. "Oh, that's all? So how long is
that going to take?" he asks, as if the infi
nite mysteries of the creative process can
somehow be summed up in a number.
I consider quoting the national
median (6.9 years), or Stanford's average
(5.9), but instead I just offer a fairly inclu
sive range (3-45 years). It is, after all, a
discretionary thing, the duration of a
Ph.D. being about as elastic as a George
Bush campaign pledge.
Law students need not shy away from
from such questions, what with that nifty
short-hand of theirs: you're either a IL,
2L or 3L. Period. And MBAs scramble in
and out before you can say "fiduciary
responsibility."
This is a time-conscious society, and no
doubt there are quicker ways to a decent
job than toiling over a dissertation.
When you finish Ph.D. course-work
and qualifying exams, as I just have, you
are vulnerable to the illusion that a mean
ingful threshold has been crossed. "No
more piddling seminar papers," you
chortle, "I'll be setting my own deadlines
now, thank you!"
But before long this euphoria gives
way to a sober appraisal of the task await
ing you: (1) do "original research," i.e.
unearth previously unknown truths that
conveniently eluded Plato and his
successors, (2) impose solitary confine

ment on yourself while you commit this
Knowledge to paper — actually reams of
paper, and (3) orally defend this tome
before departmental examiners, satisfy
ing them that while what you have done
is indeed original, it's not so original as to
violate the discipline's prevailing
Paradigm.
To Ph.D. or not to Ph.D.: that is a
question. But it is not one that exercises
the "pragmatic" undergraduate's mind
for long.
And why should it? It appears to be an
absurdly time-consuming degree, comple
tion of which subjects one to the whimsy
of a competitive and not very lucrative job
market.
So why am I getting a Ph.D.? And why
might I humbly suggest that an under
graduate preparing for the LSAT or
GMAT pause to entertain it as a valid
option?
A Ph.D. offers one the opportunity,
quite simply, to define a question, and to
engage in the sustained pursuit of its
answer. Any question. And freedom to fol
low virtually wherever the search might
lead. This is an exhilarating, even intoxi
cating, proposition to one who is gen
uinely curious about how the world
works.
The obvious retort is that to under
stand the "real world," you must jump
headlong into it rather than observe it
from an Ivory Tower.
I don't reject this in principle, but a
telling comparison comes to mind. My
closest friends in the Ph.D. program are
currently doing field research in Moscow,
Chile, Peru, Kenya, Haiti and Ghana.

Recently an old college friend of mine,
who works for a prestigious law firm in
New York, collapsed and was hospitalized
for exhaustion at the end of a 90-hour
work week.
While his case is somewhat excessive
— he leads the firm in billable hours — I
was left to wonder who is truly living in
the real world? He or my colleague who is
waiting in Moscow bread lines and exam
ining the formation of new Russian polit
ical parties?
Of course, nearly all the virtues of the
Ph.D. can be perverted into vices. The
lack of a fixed timetable for the degree
demands internal discipline while making
perennial students out of those who lack
it. The pursuit of originality can breed
narrow and irrelevant dissertation topics.
It is surely not an ideal option for every
one.
But my sense is that many undergrad
uates dismiss it before noting the unique
promise at its core: the opportunity to
experience intellectual autonomy, to
think about what interests you most,
rather than what will best serve your
clients or shareholders.
