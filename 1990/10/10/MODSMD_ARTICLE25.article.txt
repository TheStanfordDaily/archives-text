## Michael Rubenstein Middle East discussion was forum for anti-government propaganda 
### 
I FIND IT HYPOCRITICAL that
"media watchdog" Larry Bensky
could accuse the media of "an inaccu
rate and biased presentation of interna
tional news" while participating in yester
day's "Middle East Teach-in."
The entire program consisted of speak
ers who blatantly oppose our govern
ment's military intervention in the Per
sian Gulf crisis.
Leftist, anti-Zionist professors like
Joel Beinin were given forum to spew out
their economic determinist interpreta
tions of the regional conflict, without
encountering legitimate arguments to the
contrary.
That's not discussion. It's propaganda.
Somehow, the creators of this event,
hearkening back to our mistakes in Viet
nam, sought to relive the days when oppo
nents of the government struggled to
have their voices heard. Unfortunately, in
the process, they excluded the voice of the
government itself.
Why, you might ask, didn't they invite
a government proponent to the event?

Because the real purpose of events like
Monday's is to promote a convoluted and
obsessive distaste for foreign policies that
serve our national economic interests.
When will Stanford's intellectuals
realize that our economic interests do not
have to bte mutually exclusive from our
political, social, and moral ones?

"We are only in the Persian Gulf for
oil," say the cynics. Even if I believed
that, so what? Oil is not just something
that rich American capitalists put into
their sports-cars.
Its price and availability affect every
aspect of the world economy. When the
economy of the industrial world suffers,

less investment can go into developing
countries. It's that simple.
People like Prof. Beinin, deluded by
Marxist reasoning, still believe that
wealth is a zero-sum game, as if the only
reason we are rich is that others are poor.
In his letter to The Daily on Monday,
Prof. Beinin asserts that Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait "to finance economic
reconstruction after the devastating war
with Iran." That's some home-improve
ment loan!
If Saddam were so concerned with the
welfare of his people, why did he start the
Iran-Iraq war in the first place? Why did
he waste the lives of tens of thousands of
Iraqis for the sake of objectives he dis
carded soon after the Kuwait invasion?
Why has he slaughtered his political
opponents and used chemical weapons on
his own citizens?
But the issue in the Middle East is not
democracy (even though Kuwait had one
of the closest things to it in the Arab
world before August 2). Rather, the issue
is world order.

Yes, we did fail by ignoring the human
rights violations and the proliferation of
weaponry in Iraq during the last decade.
Luckily, the Israelis did not, else Saddam
would have nuclear arms today. In any
case, that was then and this is now. Sad
dam must be stopped.
Hiding your heads in the isolationist,
non-interventionist sand won't make him
go away. Teach-ins and protests won't
redeem Kuwait sovereignty. Retreating to
Fortress America won't destroy Saddam's
chemical arsenal.
Maybe we are footing too much of the
Gulf crisis bill, in dollars and soldiers.
That doesn't mean we shouldn't be there.
We are a far cry from Beinin's mythical
"mercenary state whose most important
export is military force to repress the
third world."
Wake up, Stanford. The President and
the Congress deserve your support.

Michael B. Rubenstein is a senior in his
tory.
