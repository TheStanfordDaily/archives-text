## So you think you know about sex.. 
### Chris Patil 
Few adults would willingly admit ignorance
on the subject of sex. However, outcomes of
the first nationwide survey of sexual literacy
reveal that many Americans are still in the
dark on issues such as contraception and
AIDS.
The survey results, released last week by
the Kinsey Institute on Sex, Gender, and
Reproduction, suggest that the persistence of
sexual myths in the U.S. may contribute to the
prevalence of sex-related health risks, includ
ing unwanted pregnancies and sexually trans
mitted diseases.
The survey asked 1,974 adults to answer 19
questions the public frequently asked the
institute.
More than 80 percent of the participants
responded incorrectly to six or more of the
survey questions, and only four individuals
missed three or fewer.
Regionally, Midwesterners consistently
received the highest scores, while participants
from the Northeast and South made the poor

est showing.
According to the survey, roughly one-half of
Americans believe (inaccurately) that one can
acquire AIDS via anal sex with an uninfected
partner.
Some critics assert that this misconception
might have the positive effect of persuading
people to avoid such high-risk activity alto
gether.
However, June Reinisch, chief author of the
report and director of the Kinsey Institute,
says other gaps in knowledge prove that sex
ual illiteracy will hinder rather than help dis
ease control efforts.
For example, half the participants didn't
know that petroleum-based lubricants can
render condoms impotent as barriers to the
AIDS virus.
The study is the first of its size to focus on
sexual knowledge rather than individual
behavior. This focus has drawn fire from crit
ics, who argue that the questions require sta
tistical guesswork by participants, rather than
useful knowledge.
One such question asks women to estimate

how frequently men have extramarital affairs,
a fact considered irrelevant by critics.
However, Reinisch maintains that "It's very
important to know what people know," so that
educational campaigns can be more effectively
focused.
For instance, most of the surveyed women
did not realize that as many as one-third of
U.S. men have had homosexual experiences.
Ignorance of this statistic could lead women to
underestimate the chance that a male partner
has engaged in high-risk sex, Reinisch says.
Two-thirds of surveyed women underesti
mated the average age at which women first
have intercourse, which suggests that young
women may feel social pressure to have sex
before they are emotionally prepared, accord
ing to publicists for the study.
The survey results, now being prepared for
submission to an academic journal, were
released last week in a book entitled "The Kin
sey Institute New Report on Sex: What You
Must Know to Be Sexually Literate".
A promotional tour for the book is sched
uled for the first three weeks of October.
