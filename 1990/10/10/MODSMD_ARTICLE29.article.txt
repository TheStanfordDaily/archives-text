# Disaster prevention: copy your files
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Take this newspaper with you
and head immediately for your
computer. Find as many spare
floppy disks as you can gather and
start copying all the files you
would hate to lose on those flop
pies.
If you don't have any spare
disks, by all means go out and pick
some up immediately. Some of you
might also need a backup program
to preserve the files that are too
large to fit on a single disk. Try
HD Backup (free with every hard
drive equipped Mac), it will do for
now.
Why is Computer Corner treat
ing its readers like 4-year-olds
today? Simple. Friday night the
file server here at The Daily came
crashing down along with better
than two years' worth of data.
Because the paper lacked backups
of most of the files, they are gone
for good.
Granted, most of you won't

lose 100-plus mega
bytes of informa
tion like we did. If
you lose even one
third of your hard
disk, though, it will
probably be quite
traumatic for you.
Backing up is
not a glamorous
thing to do. Having

to resort to swapping floppies for
an hour after getting used to a
speedy hard disk is never going to
be anyone's idea of a fun way to
spend a Friday night. I know that.
I also know that trying in vain
for an entire weekend to retrieve
important files is even less fun —
sort of like having a dentist pull
out 11 of your less important
teeth with pliers.
Our crash occurred during a
process known as disk defragmen
tation. When your hard drive is
new and empty, files are stored on
it neatly, in contiguous sections of
the disk. If the computer wants a
file, it usually has to go to only one

place to pick it up.
That's fast and
efficient.
In time, however,
your files become
fragmented —
that is pieces of a
single file are
stored all over
your drive. It's
analogous to pick-

ing up the "Full Moon Fever"
album and having part of "You're
So Bad" and part of "Free Fallin' "
on the same track.
Anyway, to defragment our
disk, I used Disk Express by a
company called Alsoft. Do not ever
use this program. The risky way it
moves data was no doubt a con
tributing factor to the severity of
our crash.
Optimization is better left to a
little program called Speed Disk,
part of a phenomenal new package
called Norton Utilities for the
Macintosh. This collection of soft
ware ($99 at Computerware),
includes a data recovery program,

the Norton Disk Doctor; a special
INIT called Lifesaver that makes
data recovery go much faster
Speed Disk, the optimizer; Fast
Find, a desk accessory that is to
Apple's Find File what the Ferrari
is to the go-kart; and several oth
ers niceties.
The Lifesaver INIT (a small
program that runs whenever you
start you Mac), is installed on
your system and takes a snapshot
of what your drive is supposed to
look like at periodic intervals.
Then, in the event of a crash, Nor
ton is much more likely to be able
to put your drive together again.
Symantec Utilities for the Mac
intosh and Mac Tools Deluxe pro
vide a similar suite of programs to
Norton — and are comparably
priced. While none of the three
was able to adequately undo our
nightmare here, one of them
should be on your "must buy" list.
Consider it an insurance policy
for your computer.
