# Domestic partners awarded benefits
## Decision is victory for gay couples 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Stanford became the first uni
versity yesterday to systemati
cally extend student spouse bene
fits to lesbian and gay domestic
partners, as well as to unmarried
heterosexual couples.
Effective immediately, the pol
icy guarantees equal access to stu
dent housing, facilities and health
care.
Stanford's action could signal
to other universities that a work
able domestic partners policy is
possible, according to those who
have worked to implement the
change here.
"For me the benefits are per
sonal, like using the gym as a cou
ple," said Eleanor Feingold, a
graduate student who has been
working for domestic partner ben
efits at Stanford. "But I also think
it is an important civil rights
issue," she added.
Although the Board of
Trustees did not vote on the pol
icy, University President Donald
Kennedy informed the Trustees of
the change during a regularly
scheduled meeting Monday. Act
ing Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson announced the decision
yesterday.
The new policy's purpose is "to
ensure that students do not have
to choose between their domestic
commitments and their studies at
Stanford," Robinson said.
Gay and lesbian students have
been working to gain benefits for
their domestic partners since
1976. Stanford's non-discrimina
tion statement has prohibited dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation for the past four
years.
Although Columbia Teacher's
College has a student housing pol
icy which places gay and lesbian
domestic partnerships on equal
footing with married couples,

Stanford is the first
university to offer
spouse benefits to
gay and lesbian
domestic partners.

Stanford is the first to offer com
prehensive benefits.
The policy "brings lesbian and
gay students and partners more
fully into the academic commu
nity," law student Ed Swanson
said. M lt is a big step in making us
feel part of Stanford."
Under the policy, students who
say they are in a marriage recog
nized by California law or in an
"established long-term domestic
partnership" may live in one-bed
room apartments and purchase
health care through Coweil Stu
dent Health Center. Until now,
domestic partners have had access
to such benefits only by petition.
In addition, domestic partners
can now get a courtesy card by
request from the registrar's office,
allowing access to libraries, recre
ation facilities and some Univer
sity events.
The University will not require
proof of a long-term relationship
for eligibility, just as it does not
require students to submit mar
riage certificates.
Students who have been work
ing for the policy change
expressed a mixture of relief and
jubilation last night.
"We were afraid until the really
last minute that something horri
ble would happen, that the
trustees would say we needed to
study it for another five years or
something," Feingold said.
Graduate student David Brad
fute said, "It makes me feel a
whole lot better about being at
Stanford, that people really care
about us. A lot of administrators
really went out on a limb for us."
Many students were confident
that Stanford's decision will be

echoed by other universities.
But student domestic partners
benefits at Stanford are not the
last step, the students stressed.
"I really believe Stanford
should follow the non-discrimina
tion policy, and it is not fully
implemented yet," Bradfute said,
citing the fact that faculty and
staff do not have domestic partner
benefits under University policy.
