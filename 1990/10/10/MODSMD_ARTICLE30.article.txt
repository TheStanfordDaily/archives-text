The Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center is planning a
$100 to 200 million project to
explore the relationship
between matter and anti-mat
ter.
Providing they receive fed
eral funding, physicists at the
center plan to convert an old
particle colliding ring into a
specialized reactor designed to
produce subatomic particles,
known as B-mesons, in large
numbers.
However, with large amou
nts of money going into the
search for new particles, there
may not be enough left over in
the federal budget for a B-fac
tory, the name given to this
type of reactor.
Although this project will
cost considerably less than the
$8 billion Superconducting
Super Collider being planned
in Texas, it bucks against the
current vogue in particle
physics, which is to accelerate
particles to faster and faster
speeds, collide them and dis
cover new particles as a result.
According to Frank Porter, a
researcher with the center, the
Stanford group is working very
hard on the project, and plans
to submit a proposal to the
Department of Energy in Jan
uary.
Porter is hopeful about the
future of the project, as "the
physics [behind it] is excel
lent."
If federal funds are avail
able, Stanford will be vying
against Cornell University for
it. Outside of the U.S., B-fac
tory plans are also afoot in Ger
many, Switzerland, Japan and
the Soviet Union.
By studying the way B

mesons i:ind their anti-matter
equivalents behave in the reac
tor, scientists hope to better
understand the distinction
between matter and anti-mat
ter.
As anyone who has ever
seen Star Trek knows, matter
and anti-matter behave oppo
sitely and annihilate each other
when they come into contact.

This project
bucks against
the vogue in
physics, which is
to accelerate par
ticles to faster
and faster
speeds, collide
them and dis
cover new parti
cles as a result.

Mor j precisely, for every
type of fundamental particle in
physics, there is a correspond
ing an !,i-particle.
A particle and its anti-parti
cle ar/j opposites in all respects;
wher brought together, they
destvoy each other in a burst of
ene'.gy.
The exact distinction be
tween matter and anti-matter
has plagued the quark model of
particle physics since the '50s.
The quark model is an
