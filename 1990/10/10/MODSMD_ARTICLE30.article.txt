The Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center is planning a
$100 to 200 million project to
explore the relationship
between matter and anti-mat
ter.
Providing they receive fed
eral funding, physicists at the
center plan to convert an old
particle colliding ring into a
specialized reactor designed to
produce subatomic particles,
known as B-mesons, in large
numbers.
However, with large amou
nts of money going into the
search for new particles, there
may not be enough left over in
the federal budget for a B-fac
tory, the name given to this
type of reactor.
Although this project will
cost considerably less than the
$8 billion Superconducting
Super Collider being planned
in Texas, it bucks against the
current vogue in particle
physics, which is to accelerate
particles to faster and faster
speeds, collide them and dis
cover new particles as a result.
According to Frank Porter, a
researcher with the center, the
Stanford group is working very
hard on the project, and plans
to submit a proposal to the
Department of Energy in Jan
uary.
Porter is hopeful about the
future of the project, as "the
physics [behind it] is excel
lent."
If federal funds are avail
able, Stanford will be vying
against Cornell University for
it. Outside of the U.S., B-fac
tory plans are also afoot in Ger
many, Switzerland, Japan and
the Soviet Union.
By studying the way B

mesons i:ind their anti-matter
equivalents behave in the reac
tor, scientists hope to better
understand the distinction
between matter and anti-mat
ter.
As anyone who has ever
seen Star Trek knows, matter
and anti-matter behave oppo
sitely and annihilate each other
when they come into contact.

This project
bucks against
the vogue in
physics, which is
to accelerate par
ticles to faster
and faster
speeds, collide
them and dis
cover new parti
cles as a result.

Mor j precisely, for every
type of fundamental particle in
physics, there is a correspond
ing an !,i-particle.
A particle and its anti-parti
cle ar/j opposites in all respects;
wher brought together, they
destvoy each other in a burst of
ene'.gy.
The exact distinction be
tween matter and anti-matter
has plagued the quark model of
particle physics since the '50s.
The quark model is an
extremely elegant tool that can
explain the properties of a large
group of elemental particles by
assuming they are built from six
different fundamental elements,
or quarks.
The word "quark" was actually
invented by James Joyce in his
novel "Finnegan's Wake" when
he described the sound seagulls
make.
Physicists adopted Joyce's
nonsensical term when they came
up with the model because it is so
abstract.
From lightest to heaviest, the
six types of quark are "up,"
"down," "strange," "charmed,"
"bottom" and "top" quarks. To
date, particles have been discov
ered containing every type of
quark except the top quark.
Although quarks are funda
mental elements of matter, they
are always found together in
groups of two or three.
These groups, known as
hadrons, are the smallest pieces
of quark-containing matter that
exist. Protons and neutrons are
the most common examples of
hadrons.
On earth, up and down quarks
are the only ones we ever
encounter, being present in pro
tons and neutrons.

Anyone who has
ever seen an
episode of Star Trek
knows that matter
and anti-matter
behave oppositely-

The other four are heavier and
require high-energy particle colli
sions to produce them.
One place where these colli
sions occur is in the earth's upper
atmosphere, where high-energy
cosmic rays are constantly bom
barding the earth from space.
Another place is in high-energy
particle accelerators, where
higher energy makes for heavier
particles and requires more elabo
rate and expensive equipment.
The bottom quark had its hey
day about thirteen years ago,
when the discovery of the upsilon
particle marked its first appear
ance.
Since then, the discovery of
heavier particles and the search
for even more massive ones, like
one containing the top quark,
have greatly upstaged interest in
the bottom quark.
However, some physicists
believe an extensive study of B
mesons will produce a better
understanding of the quark
model by addressing a side of the

theory that has been problematic
in the past.
B-mesons are produced from
the decay of upsilon particles. An
upsilon particle consists of a bot
tom quark and an anti-bottom
quark. The upsilon particle
quickly decays, and under the
proper circumstances, it produces
a B-meson (containing an anti
bottom quark and a down quark)
and an anti-B-meson.
Work that was done in the '50s
observing kaons, which consist of
a down and a strange quark,
showed that kaons and anti
kaons decay in similar rather
than opposite ways, as was previ
ously believed.
This unexplained property led
scientists to add the notion of left
or right-handedness — based on
particle spin — into the quark
model.
The revised quark model
explained the observations quite
well until the '60s, when the dis
covery of more exotic forms of
kaon decay threw another mon
key wrench into the theory.
By adding the concept of cer
tain particles moving forward or
backward in time based on their
left or right-handedness, theopr
and observation were once again
reconciled.
But can this new model with
stand the scrutiny of extended B
meson study?
