Do you know what CFCs,
LRVs, STEMs, ICBMs, CRTs,
CPUs, PCBs, PRIs, and TLAs are?
If you don't, then write to the Sci
ence Bugs — remember, we're
grad students, we know every
thing.
(~\*l've noticed that my new
•scooter puffs out bluish
exhaust all the time — my friends
with old cars say that means my
engine is worn out. Have I
burned it out already ?

A. Even if you've been hot-rod
• ding your scooter down
Palrn Drive, chances are that your
engine is fine.
Blue smoke is usually a sign
that motor oil is being burned
with the gasoline. For cars, this is
a very bad sign, but for mopeds
and other vehicles with small
engines, it is normal.
This is because cars have four
stroke engines — that is, there are
four up or down strokes of the pis
ton per combustion cycle. These
engines are lubricated by oil
splashing around in the crankcase
at the bottom of the engine.
If the piston rings or other
parts are very worn, oil gets into
the combustion chamber and is
burned, turning the exhaust blue -
the sign of an engine headed for
that Great Highway in the Sky.
Your scooter has a two-stroke
engine that uses the crankcase in
the combustion cycle to do all that
a four-stroke engine does in two.
Because of this, the oil must be
mixed with the gas to lubricate
the engine properly. Since it is
mixed with the gas, it gets burned
with the it, making blue smoke all
the time.
Two-stroke engines are used in
scooters because they have fewer
moving parts than four-stroke
engines and are easier to make in
small sizes, although they are less
efficient. 112
Also, because the oil doesn t
have to sit in the bottom of the

engine, they can operate in any
position. That is why chainsaws
use two-stroke engines - the bet
ter to slice you up with, my dear.
Q.Afy roommate says that
• lightning travels from the
cioud to the ground, hut I remem
ber reading that it goes up. Who's
right?
A .Technically, you both are.
• The turbulence within a
thundercloud (a.k.a. cumulonim
bus cloud) generates a large nega
tive charge at its base. This
induces a local positive charge in
the earth.
When the difference reaches
approximately 100 million volts, a
small leader stroke of lightning
blazes a trail to the ground, ioniz
ing a column of air.
Next, because the earth has an
overall negative charge compared
to the atmosphere, a return stroke
from the earth carries the main
flow of electrons up to the cloud.
This return stroke travels up at
1/10 the speed of light and heats
the air white hot (30,000° C). This
process of leader stroke and
return stroke repeats several
times in about 1/5 of a second and
is seen as a single flash of light
ning.
When a single cloud really gets
cranking, it can produce about as
much power as several nuclear
power plants, almost one billion
watts.
