## Cooper sets all-time record as spikers wallop Bears 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
It has become tradition that after each Stanford
tally, fans in the cheering section scream in unison,
"Point Stanford." Spectators at last night's Stan
ford-California volleyball match soured their voices
trying to keep pace with the Cardinal offense and
especially with middle blocker Amy Cooper.
As expected, No. 6 Stanford (11-2, 8-1 in Pacific
-10 Conference) overwhelmed California at Maples
Pavilion, 15-3, 15-12, 15-3. In the process, Cooper
recorded an extremely rare perfect hitting night.

Cardinal 3

Golden Bears 0

The 6-foot-2 junior hit 1.000, amassing 13 kills in 13
attacks to set an NCAA all-time record for best hit
ting percentage in one match with a minimum of 10
attacks. A 1.000 hitting percentage has now been
accomplished only four times in recorded history.
The evening started innocently enough. Before a
sparse home crowd of 800, Stanford's core starters
rallied to a 3-0 game one lead. Cooper struck for the
first of her sweet thirteen at 2-0. The Cardinal
showed little mercy in exploiting the young Bear
blockers.
"They're really inexperienced," Stanford coach
Don Shaw said. "We just needed to handle the ball
well."
The Cardinal did that and continued to feed the
middle attack. Cooper struck again and again with
out resistance while her teammate Bev Oden posted
eight kills for a .375 mark. After surrendering two
points on broken plays, Stanford outscored Califor
nia 12-1. In the game, junior All-American Kristin
Klein made the first of her three solo blocks on the
night.
As Stanford repossessed the net, the Bears looked
for other alternatives. They found one in junior mid
dle blocker Morgan Cecil. California setter Sara Alli
son went out of her way to set Cecil for improved
results. The Berekely, Calif, native killed a team
high 11 balls and led the Bears out of its first game
slump.
California actually surged ahead in game two and
was not caught until point 9-9. Fittingly, Cooper

on pace.

struck both the sideout kill at 8-9 and the point kill
immediately afterwards. A solo block by Klein and
another Cooper kill propped Stanford ahead for
good.
"Stanford's pretty steady," California coach D&v >>
DeGroot said. "We just made a lot of unforced
errors."
He wasn't kidding. The Bears commmitted 20
total attack errors, seven service errors, eight recep
tion errors and hit .129 on the night. Things were
going so bad that Lisa Arce, California's top player,
smashed one set directly into the net on a play in
which the Cardinal had no blockers in the air.
The mistakes showed in game three. As Stanford
led 3-2, the Bears failed in four consecutive points to
return a serve over the net. Klein, who hit .308 on
the night, sealed matters with a kill at 8-3.
California would have been finished offensively
for the night. Stanford scored the next seven points
with little difficulty. Nicole Appleman, who substi
tuted for starter Jessica Benton throughout the
match, pounded a kill at 10-3. Oden continued to
leave more than mental impressions on her oppo
nents, solo blocking a hard-hit ball directly back into
Cal middle blocker Cara Dane's face.
Meanwhile, Cooper had rotated into the back row
and could sense the impending statistical feat. "I
was really excited," Cooper said. "It's such a good
feeling. Don just left it up to us to play. I thought we
played pretty well. It was a lot of fun."
It was more than that. It was history. Through
the 1988 season, no other player in the history of
NCAA volleyball had recorded a 13 for 13 night. The
previous high was 12 for 12 by Darby Bruning of SW
Texas State in 1985. Stanford's Laura Olesen, who
played from '85 to '89, also hit 1.000 in a match
against Oregon State in 1986. Olesen hit 10 for 10.

but there's potential for improve

by injuries last year, is surpassing
the form that earned her All-Pac

the year. Her percentage boosted
34 points on the virtue of last
night alone.
The rest of the Cardinal attack
didn't do so badly itself. Shaw's
empahsis on offensive variety
showed in the final statistics once
again. The team's 36 kills were
split among nine players. Stan

three players who are hitting over
.328 in Pac-10 competition. Few
teams have one starter with that
percentage.

Don Shaw said. "We just needed to handle the ball
well."
The Cardinal did that and continued to feed the
middle attack. Cooper struck again and again with
out resistance while her teammate Bev Oden posted
eight kills for a .375 mark. After surrendering two
points on broken plays, Stanford outscored Califor
nia 12-1. In the game, junior All-American Kristin
Klein made the first of her three solo blocks on the
night.
As Stanford repossessed the net, the Bears looked
for other alternatives. They found one in junior mid
dle blocker Morgan Cecil. California setter Sara Alli
son went out of her way to set Cecil for improved
results. The Berekely, Calif, native killed a team

struck both the sideout kill at 8-9 and the point kill
immediately afterwards. A solo block by Klein and
another Cooper kill propped Stanford ahead for
good.
"Stanford's pretty steady," California coach D&v >>
DeGroot said. "We just made a lot of unforced
errors."
He wasn't kidding. The Bears commmitted 20
total attack errors, seven service errors, eight recep
tion errors and hit .129 on the night. Things were
going so bad that Lisa Arce, California's top player,
smashed one set directly into the net on a play in
which the Cardinal had no blockers in the air.
The mistakes showed in game three. As Stanford
led 3-2, the Bears failed in four consecutive points to
return a serve over the net. Klein, who hit .308 on
the night, sealed matters with a kill at 8-3.
California would have been finished offensively
for the night. Stanford scored the next seven points
with little difficulty. Nicole Appleman, who substi
tuted for starter Jessica Benton throughout the
match, pounded a kill at 10-3. Oden continued to
leave more than mental impressions on her oppo
nents, solo blocking a hard-hit ball directly back into
Cal middle blocker Cara Dane's face.
Meanwhile, Cooper had rotated into the back row
and could sense the impending statistical feat. "I
was really excited," Cooper said. "It's such a good
feeling. Don just left it up to us to play. I thought we
played pretty well. It was a lot of fun."
It was more than that. It was history. Through
the 1988 season, no other player in the history of
NCAA volleyball had recorded a 13 for 13 night. The
previous high was 12 for 12 by Darby Bruning of SW
Texas State in 1985. Stanford's Laura Olesen, who
played from '85 to '89, also hit 1.000 in a match
against Oregon State in 1986. Olesen hit 10 for 10.
