# The 						legacy of the Notre Dame game
## 
### 
Nothing will ever be the
same again. For those of
you who have been
around long enough to remem
ber February 4,1988, you know
what I mean. On that day, the
Cardinal hoopsters felled the
mighty Arizona Wildcats, then
ranked No. 1 in the country,
and changed the face of Stan
ford basketball forever. From
anonymity to respectability in
one win.
The next year, a redheaded
freshman named Keefe showed
up on the Farm, and Stanford
beat Arizona again on their way
to the post-season party for the
first time in 47 years.

But the wide-eyed freshman
who stormed the court after
that win nearly three years ago
is now a mature senior. The
magnitude of that win could
never be duplicated, I told
myself, as friends and I laughed
about the upcoming game.
"Yeah, watch us lose to San
Jose State and then come back
to beat Notre Dame. Sure, why
not?"
But, deep down, perhaps I
suspected something. I wore my
"Cardinal Upsets Irish!" t-shirt
I bought last year on the Thurs
day before the game. On an
impulse, I picked Stanford to
win, 21-19, in my fraternity's
weekly football pool. Even as
the Mercury News raved about
the weapons of the Irish, I
sensed that perhaps the Notre
Dame juggernaut could be had.
Last year's game kept com
ing up in my mind. The Irish
were good this year, but not like
the 1989 squad. That team was
the defending national cham
pion, coming off a perfect sea
son in '88. They had Tony Rice,
an option cornerback who
found ways to win games with
his running, passing, and sheer
athletic ability. They were the
consensus No. 1, having
knocked off a powerful Michi
gan team earlier in the year.
They didn't walk, they
swaggered into Stanford Sta
dium, where the 1-3 Cardinal
awaited. Stanford wanted an
upset badly, and played perhaps
its best game of the season.
When the Cardinal tied the

game at 14 with a Tommy
Vardell two-point conversion in
the middle of the third quarter,
the normally sedate Stanford
crowd was screaming in joy and
disbelief.
But then Notre Dame
showed why it was No. 1, con
trolling the clock the rest of the
game. After surrendering a
quick touchdown, twice the
Stanford defense stopped Irish
drives inside the 10 yard line.
But the Cardinal offense man
aged only three more points the
rest of the game. Despite gain
ing more yards (316 to 296) and
first downs (21 to 16) than the
Irish, Stanford lost 27-17.
There are two vivid memo
ries I have from that game,
both occurring at the conclu
sion. I wanted to meet a friend
of mine that was on the Notre
Dame team, so I raced back to
Encina Gym, thinking that the
Irish would change there. I
soon found out I was wrong,
but not before I watched the
Stanford players file in. They
were dejected, but they were
also angry.
Two big linemen were slam
ming their fists and helmets
into the walls of the hallway,
muttering, "We had those
guys!"
I then ran back to wait for
the Irish outside the stadium.
My friend, Demetrius Dußose,
went to my high school, where
he was an all-state linebacker
recruited by (among others)
Stanford, Washington, and
defending national champion
Notre Dame. My high school
was Catholic, and our nickname
was "the Fighting Irish." His
choice wasn't too difficult.
As I waited, and watched
Notre Dame stars like Rice,
Ricky Watters, and Raghib
Ismail get mobbed by fans, I
thought about the game and
the Stanford players' reactions.
When Demetrius finally
emerged, I congratulated him
and echoed what I had just
heard the linemen say: "I
thought we had you guys
there."
He gave me that confident,
Notre Dame smile and said,
"No, you didn't."
Everyone who knows any
thing about college football
knows about Notre Dame.
They're the Christians who
always win. They're the suc
cessful college football program
that never gets put on proba
tion or has a player charged
with rape. When Tony Rice
came to South Bend and sat out


Dave
Hirning
a year because of Proposition 48
(he failed to score well on his
SATs), it was considered a mqjor
scandal.
Notre Dame is the program of
Heisman Trophy winners and
national championships—l 7 of
the latter, if you believe their
press guide, which by the way is
bigger than the Stanford Student
Directory. Joe Montana played at
Notre Dame. So did George Gipp,
he of "Win one for the Gipper"
fame. Knute Rockne coached
there.
I have this wrinkled, yellowing
Irish pennant on my wall at home.
It's actually my dad's. When he
was a kid growing up in Los Ange
les, he rooted for Notre Dame,
simply because he went to
Catholic schools. Every fall, the
nuns there would get down on
their knees and pray at mass for a
Notre Dame win.
Last year, Cardinal center
Chuck Gillingham made some
comments to the effect that Notre
Dame was just another program,
that their players didn't play any
differently than anybody else.
This, of course, was blasphemy.
You'd have thought Gillingham
had spit on the Pope. He forgot
that, if God did indeed follow col
lege football, he was on Notre
Dame's side. Didn't they have a
mosaic of Jesus Christ in view of
the football stadium, his arms
raised to signal a touchdown?
What could be better proof of the
divine providence that had been
bestowed on the Irish?
Stanford, on the other hand,
was populated by a bunch of free
thinking heathens who had a bor
ing mosaic on their church.
Before Saturday, however, the
results seemed to bear out this
view. While Stanford had suffered

two heartbreaking, last-second
losses and had a woeful 1-3 mark,
Notre Dame had pulled out two
close wins to keep its record
unblemished. The Irish were No.
1 with a bullet, and the Cardinal
were going nowhere.

It was almost a
religious experi
ence.

But someone forgot to tell
Stanford, who showed the
Catholics very little respect in
their own chapel, so to speak.
Someone forgot to tell Tommy
Vardell that he wasn't even sup
posed to play this season, with
1,000-yard man Jon Volpe and
Miami transfer Ellery Roberts
also at the fullback spot. Someone
forgot to tell Jason Palumbis that
he was a sore-armed QB who was
watching the Notre Dame game
from the bench last year.
With six minutes to go, Notre
Dame got the ball, could do noth
ing, and had to punt. Stanford
drove right down the field. When
all of Palumbis' receivers were
covered on fourth-and-two, he
scrambled for the first down,
making it by inches. Then it was
the McCaffrey and Vardell show.
When "Touchdown Tommy"
vaulted over from the one, Stan
ford had the lead with a half
minute to play.
Apparently, that same someone
had also forgotten to tell God.
Unless perhaps He decided that
Notre Dame was getting too big
for its britches. Perhaps He
thought that the Irish's new
multi-million dollar TV package
and pooh-poohing of steroid-use
allegations showed just a bit too
much brashness.
Or maybe He just heard the
prayers from the heathens' side,
where Gillingham was holding
entreating the heavens to help his
defense stop the Irish. Sixty thou
sand fans created pandemonium
as their team roared down the
field. They were sure that the
blessed Irish would rise up and
destroy the California infidels.
This was Notre Dame, after all.
It came down to one play, and it
went just as Coach Lou Holtz (or

maybe, God?) diagrammed it. As
time expired, Notre Dame's Derek
Brown reached out to gather in
the ball for the winning touch
down. Nice try, Stanford, but you
can't beat the holy tradition of
Notre Dame.
Brown dropped the ball.
The Irish media guide lists
Brown's football fantasy as "danc
ing in the end zone after a touch
down." Instead, it was the Cardi
nal who danced, before 60,000
hushed onlookers. The Stanford
players gathered at midfield, hug
ging, screaming, and crying. It
was almost a religious experience.
Back in his living room, this

mature, 21-year-old senior was
dancing too. Dancing as he did
that night long ago in Maples,
when Stanford had last played the
role of David, rising up to smote
the Goliath-like No. 1 team in the
country, and "shocked the world."
This time, he danced by him
self. In his underwear. And if God
does indeed follow college football,
He was up there somewhere, smil
ing.

Stanford players file in. They
were dejected, but they were
also angry.
Two big linemen were slam
ming their fists and helmets
into the walls of the hallway,
muttering, "We had those
guys!"
I then ran back to wait for
the Irish outside the stadium.
My friend, Demetrius Dußose,
went to my high school, where
he was an all-state linebacker
recruited by (among others)
Stanford, Washington, and
defending national champion
Notre Dame. My high school
was Catholic, and our nickname
was "the Fighting Irish." His
choice wasn't too difficult.
As I waited, and watched
Notre Dame stars like Rice,
Ricky Watters, and Raghib
Ismail get mobbed by fans, I
thought about the game and
the Stanford players' reactions.
When Demetrius finally
emerged, I congratulated him
and echoed what I had just
heard the linemen say: "I
thought we had you guys
there."
He gave me that confident,
Notre Dame smile and said,
"No, you didn't."
Everyone who knows any
thing about college football
knows about Notre Dame.
They're the Christians who
always win. They're the suc
cessful college football program
that never gets put on proba
tion or has a player charged
with rape. When Tony Rice
came to South Bend and sat out

a year because of Proposition 48
(he failed to score well on his
SATs), it was considered a mqjor
scandal.
Notre Dame is the program of
Heisman Trophy winners and
national championships—l 7 of
the latter, if you believe their
press guide, which by the way is
bigger than the Stanford Student
Directory. Joe Montana played at
Notre Dame. So did George Gipp,
he of "Win one for the Gipper"
fame. Knute Rockne coached
there.
I have this wrinkled, yellowing
Irish pennant on my wall at home.
It's actually my dad's. When he
was a kid growing up in Los Ange
les, he rooted for Notre Dame,
simply because he went to
Catholic schools. Every fall, the
nuns there would get down on
their knees and pray at mass for a
Notre Dame win.
Last year, Cardinal center
Chuck Gillingham made some
comments to the effect that Notre
Dame was just another program,
that their players didn't play any
differently than anybody else.
This, of course, was blasphemy.
You'd have thought Gillingham
had spit on the Pope. He forgot
that, if God did indeed follow col
lege football, he was on Notre
Dame's side. Didn't they have a
mosaic of Jesus Christ in view of
the football stadium, his arms
raised to signal a touchdown?
What could be better proof of the
divine providence that had been
bestowed on the Irish?
Stanford, on the other hand,
was populated by a bunch of free
thinking heathens who had a bor
ing mosaic on their church.
Before Saturday, however, the
results seemed to bear out this
view. While Stanford had suffered

two heartbreaking, last-second
losses and had a woeful 1-3 mark,
Notre Dame had pulled out two
close wins to keep its record
unblemished. The Irish were No.
1 with a bullet, and the Cardinal
were going nowhere.

It was almost a
religious experi
ence.

But someone forgot to tell
Stanford, who showed the
Catholics very little respect in
their own chapel, so to speak.
Someone forgot to tell Tommy
Vardell that he wasn't even sup
posed to play this season, with
1,000-yard man Jon Volpe and
Miami transfer Ellery Roberts
also at the fullback spot. Someone
forgot to tell Jason Palumbis that
he was a sore-armed QB who was
watching the Notre Dame game
from the bench last year.
With six minutes to go, Notre
Dame got the ball, could do noth
ing, and had to punt. Stanford
drove right down the field. When
all of Palumbis' receivers were
covered on fourth-and-two, he
scrambled for the first down,
making it by inches. Then it was
the McCaffrey and Vardell show.
When "Touchdown Tommy"
vaulted over from the one, Stan
ford had the lead with a half
minute to play.
Apparently, that same someone
had also forgotten to tell God.
Unless perhaps He decided that
Notre Dame was getting too big
for its britches. Perhaps He
thought that the Irish's new
multi-million dollar TV package
and pooh-poohing of steroid-use
allegations showed just a bit too
much brashness.
Or maybe He just heard the
prayers from the heathens' side,
where Gillingham was holding
entreating the heavens to help his
defense stop the Irish. Sixty thou
sand fans created pandemonium
as their team roared down the
field. They were sure that the
blessed Irish would rise up and
destroy the California infidels.
This was Notre Dame, after all.
It came down to one play, and it
went just as Coach Lou Holtz (or

maybe, God?) diagrammed it. As
time expired, Notre Dame's Derek
Brown reached out to gather in
the ball for the winning touch
down. Nice try, Stanford, but you
can't beat the holy tradition of
Notre Dame.
Brown dropped the ball.
The Irish media guide lists
Brown's football fantasy as "danc
ing in the end zone after a touch
down." Instead, it was the Cardi
nal who danced, before 60,000
hushed onlookers. The Stanford
players gathered at midfield, hug
ging, screaming, and crying. It
was almost a religious experience.
Back in his living room, this

mature, 21-year-old senior was
dancing too. Dancing as he did
that night long ago in Maples,
when Stanford had last played the
role of David, rising up to smote
the Goliath-like No. 1 team in the
country, and "shocked the world."
This time, he danced by him
self. In his underwear. And if God
does indeed follow college football,
He was up there somewhere, smil
ing.

Nothing will ever be the
same again. For those of
you who have been
around long enough to remem
ber February 4,1988, you know
what I mean. On that day, the
Cardinal hoopsters felled the
mighty Arizona Wildcats, then
ranked No. 1 in the country,
and changed the face of Stan
ford basketball forever. From
anonymity to respectability in
one win.
The next year, a redheaded
freshman named Keefe showed
up on the Farm, and Stanford
beat Arizona again on their way
to the post-season party for the
first time in 47 years.

But the wide-eyed freshman
who stormed the court after
that win nearly three years ago
is now a mature senior. The
magnitude of that win could
never be duplicated, I told
myself, as friends and I laughed
about the upcoming game.
"Yeah, watch us lose to San
Jose State and then come back
to beat Notre Dame. Sure, why
not?"
But, deep down, perhaps I
suspected something. I wore my
"Cardinal Upsets Irish!" t-shirt
I bought last year on the Thurs
day before the game. On an
impulse, I picked Stanford to
win, 21-19, in my fraternity's
weekly football pool. Even as
the Mercury News raved about
the weapons of the Irish, I
sensed that perhaps the Notre
Dame juggernaut could be had.
Last year's game kept com
ing up in my mind. The Irish
were good this year, but not like
the 1989 squad. That team was
the defending national cham
pion, coming off a perfect sea
son in '88. They had Tony Rice,
an option cornerback who
found ways to win games with
his running, passing, and sheer
athletic ability. They were the
consensus No. 1, having
knocked off a powerful Michi
gan team earlier in the year.
They didn't walk, they
swaggered into Stanford Sta
dium, where the 1-3 Cardinal
awaited. Stanford wanted an
upset badly, and played perhaps
its best game of the season.
When the Cardinal tied the

game at 14 with a Tommy
Vardell two-point conversion in
the middle of the third quarter,
the normally sedate Stanford
crowd was screaming in joy and
disbelief.
But then Notre Dame
showed why it was No. 1, con
trolling the clock the rest of the
game. After surrendering a
quick touchdown, twice the
Stanford defense stopped Irish
drives inside the 10 yard line.
But the Cardinal offense man
aged only three more points the
rest of the game. Despite gain
ing more yards (316 to 296) and
first downs (21 to 16) than the
Irish, Stanford lost 27-17.
There are two vivid memo
ries I have from that game,
both occurring at the conclu
sion. I wanted to meet a friend
of mine that was on the Notre
Dame team, so I raced back to
Encina Gym, thinking that the
Irish would change there. I
soon found out I was wrong,
but not before I watched the
Stanford players file in. They
were dejected, but they were
also angry.
Two big linemen were slam
ming their fists and helmets
into the walls of the hallway,

losses and had a woeful 1-3 mark,
Notre Dame had pulled out two
close wins to keep its record
unblemished. The Irish were No.
1 with a bullet, and the Cardinal
were going nowhere.

It was almost a
religious experi
ence.

But someone forgot to tell
Stanford, who showed the
Catholics very little respect in
their own chapel, so to speak.
Someone forgot to tell Tommy
Vardell that he wasn't even sup
posed to play this season, with
1,000-yard man Jon Volpe and
Miami transfer Ellery Roberts
also at the fullback spot. Someone
forgot to tell Jason Palumbis that
he was a sore-armed QB who was
watching the Notre Dame game
from the bench last year.
With six minutes to go, Notre
Dame got the ball, could do noth
ing, and had to punt. Stanford
drove right down the field. When
all of Palumbis' receivers were
covered on fourth-and-two, he
scrambled for the first down,
making it by inches. Then it was
the McCaffrey and Vardell show.
When "Touchdown Tommy"
vaulted over from the one, Stan
ford had the lead with a half
minute to play.
Apparently, that same someone
had also forgotten to tell God.
Unless perhaps He decided that
Notre Dame was getting too big
for its britches. Perhaps He
thought that the Irish's new
multi-million dollar TV package
and pooh-poohing of steroid-use
allegations showed just a bit too
much brashness.
Or maybe He just heard the
prayers from the heathens' side,
where Gillingham was holding
entreating the heavens to help his
defense stop the Irish. Sixty thou
sand fans created pandemonium
as their team roared down the
field. They were sure that the
blessed Irish would rise up and
destroy the California infidels.
This was Notre Dame, after all.
It came down to one play, and it
went just as Coach Lou Holtz (or

maybe, God?) diagrammed it. As
time expired, Notre Dame's Derek
Brown reached out to gather in
the ball for the winning touch
down. Nice try, Stanford, but you
can't beat the holy tradition of
Notre Dame.
Brown dropped the ball.
The Irish media guide lists
Brown's football fantasy as "danc
ing in the end zone after a touch
down." Instead, it was the Cardi
nal who danced, before 60,000
hushed onlookers. The Stanford
players gathered at midfield, hug
ging, screaming, and crying. It
was almost a religious experience.
Back in his living room, this

mature, 21-year-old senior was
dancing too. Dancing as he did
that night long ago in Maples,
when Stanford had last played the
role of David, rising up to smote
the Goliath-like No. 1 team in the
country, and "shocked the world."
This time, he danced by him
self. In his underwear. And if God
does indeed follow college football,
He was up there somewhere, smil
ing.

Nothing will ever be the
same again. For those of
you who have been
around long enough to remem
ber February 4,1988, you know
what I mean. On that day, the
Cardinal hoopsters felled the
mighty Arizona Wildcats, then
ranked No. 1 in the country,
and changed the face of Stan
ford basketball forever. From
anonymity to respectability in
one win.
The next year, a redheaded
freshman named Keefe showed
up on the Farm, and Stanford
beat Arizona again on their way
to the post-season party for the
first time in 47 years.

But the wide-eyed freshman
who stormed the court after
that win nearly three years ago
is now a mature senior. The
magnitude of that win could
never be duplicated, I told
myself, as friends and I laughed
about the upcoming game.
"Yeah, watch us lose to San
Jose State and then come back
to beat Notre Dame. Sure, why
not?"
But, deep down, perhaps I
suspected something. I wore my
"Cardinal Upsets Irish!" t-shirt
I bought last year on the Thurs
day before the game. On an
impulse, I picked Stanford to
win, 21-19, in my fraternity's
weekly football pool. Even as
the Mercury News raved about
the weapons of the Irish, I
sensed that perhaps the Notre
Dame juggernaut could be had.
Last year's game kept com
ing up in my mind. The Irish
were good this year, but not like
the 1989 squad. That team was
the defending national cham
pion, coming off a perfect sea
son in '88. They had Tony Rice,
an option cornerback who
found ways to win games with
his running, passing, and sheer
athletic ability. They were the
consensus No. 1, having
knocked off a powerful Michi
gan team earlier in the year.
They didn't walk, they
swaggered into Stanford Sta
dium, where the 1-3 Cardinal
awaited. Stanford wanted an
upset badly, and played perhaps
its best game of the season.
When the Cardinal tied the

game at 14 with a Tommy
Vardell two-point conversion in
the middle of the third quarter,
the normally sedate Stanford
crowd was screaming in joy and
disbelief.
But then Notre Dame
showed why it was No. 1, con
trolling the clock the rest of the
game. After surrendering a
quick touchdown, twice the
Stanford defense stopped Irish
drives inside the 10 yard line.
But the Cardinal offense man
aged only three more points the
rest of the game. Despite gain
ing more yards (316 to 296) and
first downs (21 to 16) than the
Irish, Stanford lost 27-17.
There are two vivid memo
ries I have from that game,
both occurring at the conclu
sion. I wanted to meet a friend
of mine that was on the Notre
Dame team, so I raced back to
Encina Gym, thinking that the
Irish would change there. I
soon found out I was wrong,
but not before I watched the
Stanford players file in. They
were dejected, but they were
also angry.
Two big linemen were slam
ming their fists and helmets
into the walls of the hallway,
muttering, "We had those
guys!"
I then ran back to wait for
the Irish outside the stadium.
My friend, Demetrius Dußose,
went to my high school, where
he was an all-state linebacker
recruited by (among others)
Stanford, Washington, and
defending national champion
Notre Dame. My high school
was Catholic, and our nickname
was "the Fighting Irish." His
choice wasn't too difficult.
As I waited, and watched
Notre Dame stars like Rice,
Ricky Watters, and Raghib
Ismail get mobbed by fans, I
thought about the game and
the Stanford players' reactions.
When Demetrius finally
emerged, I congratulated him
and echoed what I had just
heard the linemen say: "I
thought we had you guys
there."
He gave me that confident,
Notre Dame smile and said,
"No, you didn't."
Everyone who knows any
thing about college football
knows about Notre Dame.
They're the Christians who
always win. They're the suc
cessful college football program
that never gets put on proba
tion or has a player charged
with rape. When Tony Rice
came to South Bend and sat out


Dave
Hirning
a year because of Proposition 48
(he failed to score well on his
SATs), it was considered a mqjor
scandal.
Notre Dame is the program of
Heisman Trophy winners and
national championships—l 7 of
the latter, if you believe their
press guide, which by the way is
bigger than the Stanford Student
Directory. Joe Montana played at
Notre Dame. So did George Gipp,
he of "Win one for the Gipper"
fame. Knute Rockne coached
there.
I have this wrinkled, yellowing
Irish pennant on my wall at home.
It's actually my dad's. When he
was a kid growing up in Los Ange
les, he rooted for Notre Dame,
simply because he went to
Catholic schools. Every fall, the
nuns there would get down on
their knees and pray at mass for a
Notre Dame win.
Last year, Cardinal center
Chuck Gillingham made some
comments to the effect that Notre
Dame was just another program,
that their players didn't play any
differently than anybody else.
This, of course, was blasphemy.
You'd have thought Gillingham
had spit on the Pope. He forgot
that, if God did indeed follow col
lege football, he was on Notre
Dame's side. Didn't they have a
mosaic of Jesus Christ in view of
the football stadium, his arms
raised to signal a touchdown?
What could be better proof of the
divine providence that had been
bestowed on the Irish?
Stanford, on the other hand,
was populated by a bunch of free
thinking heathens who had a bor
ing mosaic on their church.
Before Saturday, however, the
results seemed to bear out this
view. While Stanford had suffered

two heartbreaking, last-second
losses and had a woeful 1-3 mark,
Notre Dame had pulled out two
close wins to keep its record
unblemished. The Irish were No.
1 with a bullet, and the Cardinal
were going nowhere.
