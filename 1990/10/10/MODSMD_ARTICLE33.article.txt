# The
						legacy of the Notre Dame game
## 
### 
Nothing will ever be the
same again. For those of
you who have been
around long enough to remem
ber February 4,1988, you know
what I mean. On that day, the
Cardinal hoopsters felled the
mighty Arizona Wildcats, then
ranked No. 1 in the country,
and changed the face of Stan
ford basketball forever. From
anonymity to respectability in
one win.
The next year, a redheaded
freshman named Keefe showed
up on the Farm, and Stanford
beat Arizona again on their way
to the post-season party for the
first time in 47 years.

But the wide-eyed freshman
who stormed the court after
that win nearly three years ago
is now a mature senior. The
magnitude of that win could
never be duplicated, I told
myself, as friends and I laughed
about the upcoming game.
"Yeah, watch us lose to San
Jose State and then come back
to beat Notre Dame. Sure, why
not?"
But, deep down, perhaps I
suspected something. I wore my
"Cardinal Upsets Irish!" t-shirt
I bought last year on the Thurs
day before the game. On an
impulse, I picked Stanford to
win, 21-19, in my fraternity's
weekly football pool. Even as
the Mercury News raved about
the weapons of the Irish, I
sensed that perhaps the Notre
Dame juggernaut could be had.
Last year's game kept com
ing up in my mind. The Irish
were good this year, but not like
the 1989 squad. That team was
the defending national cham
pion, coming off a perfect sea
son in '88. They had Tony Rice,
an option cornerback who
found ways to win games with
his running, passing, and sheer
athletic ability. They were the
consensus No. 1, having
knocked off a powerful Michi
gan team earlier in the year.
They didn't walk, they
swaggered into Stanford Sta
dium, where the 1-3 Cardinal
awaited. Stanford wanted an
upset badly, and played perhaps
its best game of the season.
When the Cardinal tied the

game at 14 with a Tommy
Vardell two-point conversion in
the middle of the third quarter,
the normally sedate Stanford
crowd was screaming in joy and
disbelief.
But then Notre Dame
showed why it was No. 1, con
trolling the clock the rest of the
game. After surrendering a
quick touchdown, twice the
Stanford defense stopped Irish
drives inside the 10 yard line.
But the Cardinal offense man
aged only three more points the
rest of the game. Despite gain
ing more yards (316 to 296) and
first downs (21 to 16) than the
Irish, Stanford lost 27-17.
There are two vivid memo
ries I have from that game,
both occurring at the conclu
sion. I wanted to meet a friend
of mine that was on the Notre
Dame team, so I raced back to
Encina Gym, thinking that the
Irish would change there. I
soon found out I was wrong,
but not before I watched the
Stanford players file in. They
were dejected, but they were
also angry.
Two big linemen were slam
ming their fists and helmets
into the walls of the hallway,
muttering, "We had those
guys!"
I then ran back to wait for
the Irish outside the stadium.
My friend, Demetrius Du√üose,
went to my high school, where
he was an all-state linebacker
recruited by (among others)
Stanford, Washington, and
defending national champion
Notre Dame. My high school
was Catholic, and our nickname
was "the Fighting Irish." His
choice wasn't too difficult.
As I waited, and watched
Notre Dame stars like Rice,
Ricky Watters, and Raghib
Ismail get mobbed by fans, I
thought about the game and
the Stanford players' reactions.
When Demetrius finally
emerged, I congratulated him
and echoed what I had just
heard the linemen say: "I
thought we had you guys
there."
He gave me that confident,
Notre Dame smile and said,
"No, you didn't."
Everyone who knows any
thing about college football
knows about Notre Dame.
They're the Christians who
always win. They're the suc
cessful college football program
that never gets put on proba
tion or has a player charged
with rape. When Tony Rice
came to South Bend and sat out
