# Joneschild has emerged as a force
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The forwards for the women's
soccer team are like fire and ice,
but when thrown together by the
goal, the result is nothing but
defensive burn.
Flashy senior Jennifer
"Rocket" Rowland races through
the defense with high-octane
energy and near-reckless aban
don, her red hair leaving a fiery
wake through the defense.
Diminutive junior Elizabeth
Joneschild is the perfect comple
ment, controlling the tempo, ana
lyzing the defense, and scoring
with cool calculation.
Playing together on the Cardi
nal front-line, Joneschild and
Rowland have helped Stanford to
a 10-2 record, a No. 9 national
ranking, and serious hopes for
NCAA tournament play when the
regular season ends in two weeks.
Stanford makes another stop
on its journey to the tourney
today when the Cardinal visit
Division II UC-Davis at 3:30.
"When you build your team
you want a combination of types,"
said coach Andeberhan. "Eliza
beth is our most tactically
advanced forward. Even though
she is the smallest, she is capable
of holding the ball in traffic and
she is very composed, very con
trolled."
"You also need a game-breaker
like Rocket [Rowland!, and
[Sarah] Rafanelli is somewhere in
between. Elizabeth is the glue
that holds the forwards together,"
Andeberhan said.
Joneschild, a 5-6 junior from
Mercer Islafid, Wa., scored three
goals this weekend and was
named to the all-tournament
team after directing Stanford to
twin 4-1 wins in the Stanford
Invitational. But Andeberhan
notes that her goal-scoring ability
is not all she brings to the team.
"In soccer, there may be a con
centration on scoring goals, but
the score is not really important,
the win is. I'm not really con
cerned by who scores the goals, as
long as the team wins. Sometimes
Rocket will get a bunch of goals on
assists from Elizabeth, and then
[Julie] Foudy or [Jen] Bloomer
will start scoring, That's a result
of our multiple options," Andeber
han said. "And as we saw this
weekend, Elizabeth has a great
ability to score goals as well."
Joneschild's role on offense is
to set the tempo and get the ball to
Rowland or Rafanelli, or to wait
for the midfielders and high-scor
ing sophomore Foudy to come into
range. Much of her hard work can
not be quantified statistically.
"I do a lot of thinking on the
field," said Joneschild, who has
four goals and two assists on the
year. "When I'm tracking the
defense, following the ball, and
running around a lot, I can make
the other team give the ball over

to Foudy and then she can score.
That's when I'm doing my job."
Joneschild and Rowland,
friends off the field and dangerous
teammates on, have advan
tage of their differing styles and
worked together to improve as a
unit.
"Rocket and I know each other
very well and we have fun playing
together," Joneschild said. "She's
a really hard worker and we really
complement each other. We check
each other's reactions and when I
see her working hard, I work
harder, and when she sees me, she
works hard too. We back each
other up and we have fun on the
field."
"I've really enjoyed playing
with her," said Rowland. "It really
helps a lot that coach gives us so
much stuff to work on in practice.
We tell each other what we are
doing wrong and a lot of the time
we know what the other person is
going to do."
The offensive duo teamed up in
typical style in a critical 2-1 vic
tory over St. Mary's on Sept. 11.
Joneschild controlled the ball in
traffic and then passed to a
streaking Rowland for the decid
ing goal. The win solidified Stan

ford's spot as a playoff contender.
"Sometimes it's almost effort
less. And if we mess up, we adjust
and try again," Joneschild said.
Joneschild, who starts and
plays nearly every minute for the
Cardinal, wasn't handed a leading
spot when she chose Stanford out
of Lakeside High. Her sophomore
season she tallied two goals and
five assists as one of the first play
ers off the bench.
"She's gone out and worked
hard and every year she's come
back better," Andeberhan said.
"From being a good, talented
player, now she's one of the lead
ers. And it shows."
Joneschild hasn't slacked off
the field either. The quietly
intense biology major plans on
medical school and is currently an
Advising Associate.
As Joneschild has improved, so
has Andeberhan'B program. From
being a middle-of-the-pack team
four years ago, Stanford is now a
national power with its sights
legitimately set on the champi
onship.
"There's no women's soccer
after college, so everyone's goal is
to play for the NCAA champi
onship," she said. "It will be a lot

of fun to play (in the playoffs). We
aren't North Carolina so we
aren't supposed to win. We can go
in and play our hardest and have
fvm. if we torn, then we know we
tried our hardest. I know we have
the talent; we just have to do it on
the field."
With Joneschild dissecting
defenses and Stanford continuing
to improve, there is little doubt
that the Cardinal will get the job
done.
Card notes
The UC-Davis Aggies are ranked
No. 2 in the West region of Division II
and held a 7-2-1 record entering the
weekend. Stanford solidified its hold
as the third seed in the strong West
region when St. Mary's, a 2-1 loser
earlier to Stanford, defeated Califor
nia 3-1 this weekend. Twelve teams
are invited to the NCAA tournament
in November.
Last year Stanford defeated Davis
3-0 at Maloney Field with goals from
Tonya Antonucci, Anne Hoge and
Foudy.
Sophomore Jen Potok was back on
the sideline Sunday after Friday
surgery on her knee. Potok is out for
the season after injuring her anterior
cruciate against UCLA.
