Tonight at 7:30 at Maloney
Field the Cardinal men's soccer
team will try to pass San Jose
State a solid defeat. The game
against the Spartans provides the
Cardinal with an opportunity to
boost its own record, which stands
at 4-4-5 after a win and a loss this
weekend at the Stanford/Security
Pacific National Bank Invitation
al, and do some revenging damage
to San Jose State (3-9-0).
Coach Colin Lindores is confi
dent in his team. Despite the fact
that Stanford doesn't always play
its best against less rigorous com
petition, which San Jose State
may prove to be, he said "We
should beat this team."
After last weekend's frusrating
tournament results, the Cardinal
is likely to work even harder,
while maintaing the same game
plan. "It could be a challenging
game," freshman Terry Favazza
said, "[but] our style isn't going to
change."
Lindores's philosophy is simi
lar. "There tire no quick fixes...
we try to stay with our strengths
and avoid our weaknesses."
He anticipates a strong season,
despite a tough schedule. Stanford
will play many of the top 20 teams
in the West.
"We're very competitive," Lin
dores said. "As a coach you always
want that edge."
Watch for Portland to be one of
Stanford's better games this sea

The Cardinal men's soccer team has had an up-and-down year, as coach Colin Llndores readily admits.
Lindores wants to turn up the intensity on a more consistent basis, beginning tonight with the San Jose
State Spartans.
son. Lindores said that Portland
will provide stiff competition,
which motivates his team to work
to full potential.
"We belong in the top 10 rank
ing, as far as the West is con
cerned," Coach Lindores said. And
despite some difficulties reflected
in upcoming competition and in

the current record, Stanford could
achieve that. Last week the Cardi
nal was ranked 10th, and the rest
of the season looks positive.
"We're close to moving up that
notch," Lindores said.
Stanford is playing with a
strong well-rounded team this
season. Look for Sophomores
Lance Killian and Jim Talluto to
help bring victory to the Cardinal.
Ricky Gode, the only freshman
starter this season, is another to
watch for.
