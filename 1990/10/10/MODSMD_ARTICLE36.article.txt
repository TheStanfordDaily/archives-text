# Football not out of the fire

Congratulations on beheading the man-eating
tigers. Now ford the shark-infested waters.
That's the scenario the Stanford football team
faces.
Coming off the one of the biggest upsets of Cardi
nal history, the squad has no time to gloat over last
Saturday. Stanford may have subdued No.l Notre
Dame 36-31, but the team's celebration must cease.
USC is next.
As in Top-20 Southern California. As in 4-1
Southern California. As in 14-consecutive-victories
over-Stanford Southern California.
"It takes a long time to get over a disappointing
loss, but it takes longer to get over an exciting win,"
coach Denny Green said. "[But] it didn't take me
very long to sober up after I saw what we're up
against. We can't say [Notre Dame] doesn't exist,
but the reality is we want to play how we're capable
of playing Saturday."
And the Trojans are favored to keep Stanford
under control.
Last weekend's victory was a huge boost for the
team, as well as the program, but the Cardinal has to
put away any thoughts of South Bend.
Containing USC has to take up all of its energies.
"I've played USC four times since I've been here
so it (facing the Trojans) really brings you to real
ity," said offensive guard Chuck Gillingham.
"They're the cream of the conference. This is as big
of a game as last week."
Because USC already has one conference loss — a
31-0 shellacking by Washington three weeks ago — a
victory could put the Cardinal in the middle of the
Rose Bowl race. But more importantly, the Trojans
are just as talented as the Fighting Irish. And will be
as much of a challange.
Stanford can't look back because three-time con
secutive Pacific 10 Conference Champion USC has
as potent an offense as the Cardinal has gone up
against this season.
Coming off a 30-17 trouncing of Washington
State, USC is averaging 375 total yards and 24
points a contest. A pass-oriented team until the
debacle in Seattle, the Trojans have found success
doing what it traditionally does best: running the
ball.
Following in the footsteps of such greats as Heis
man trophy winners O. J. Simpson, Charles White

and Marcus Allen, tailback Ricky Ervina is averag
ing 95 yards a game on the ground. When he went
down last week USC dusted off Mazio Royster. The
unhearalded back responded by gaining 203 yards.
And scoring two touchdowns.
"The run started happening in the Ohio State
game," USC coach Larry Smith said, "Once you get
a good thing going you might as well stay with it, so
it's back to basics. We're going to try to run more
and pass less."
But when Smith does decide to go through the air,
there's All-America candidate quarterback Todd
Marinovich. You know, the one Sports Illustrated
has already had two articles on.
Before Smith got run happy, Marinovich was hav
ing quite an adequate year. So adequate he was being
touted as a Heisman candidate by the second week of
the season.
The fact that Stanford's defense has, well, given
up a lot of big plays through the air does not escape
Smith.
"We hope that the run/pass balance is going to be
important, especially because Stanford has had
problems with pass defense," Smith said.
Of course Green and Co. recognize this, and are
working to shore up both Stanford's pass rush and
its secondary coverage.
Green, however, believes stopping the run is
going to be the key to the game.
"For us to be successful we have to stop the run,"
Green said. "Obviously we have to improve our pass
defense, but the primary thing is to play very good
first-down run defense.
"We have to be ready to put them in a situation
where they don't have the confidence to run on first
down, and that's going to take some doing."
Its offense isn't USC's only weapon, however.
The young Trojan defense isn't too shabby, either.
While USC has allowed its opponents 20 points a
game, its pass defense is one of the best in the coun
try. Opponents have only converted 50 percent of
their tosses. It isn't too generous on the run, either.
And defense was supposed to be the weakest part
of the squad's game.
Jason Palumbis, Glyn Milburn, Pac-10 Player of
the Week "Touchdown" Tommy Vardell, Ed McCaf
frey and the entire defense are going to be counted
on to prove last week wasn't a fluke.
"We have plenty of opportunity to show what
kind of football team we are [Saturday]," Green said.
USC is waiting to see.
