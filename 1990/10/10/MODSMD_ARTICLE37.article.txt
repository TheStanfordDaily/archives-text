# Years of planning reap rewards for Campaign

Since the 19605, Stanford has been
breaking records with fund-raising
drives. And the $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, the country's largest univer
sity fund-raising campaign in progress,
has continued that tradition.
The $100 million goal of the 1960-63
Pace Campaign — then the largest in the
history of U.S. universities — seems
puny by today's standards. Similarly, the
1972-77 Campaign for Stanford, which
brought in a record-breaking $300 mil
lion, can't compare with the current
effort.
So how does a University plan to raise
$1.1 billion? The massive project spans
five years, from 1987 to 1992 and
required four years of planning before it
began.
In 1982, the Office of Development
and the Board of Trustees recognized
the potential of a fund-raiser that would
coincide with the University's 100 th
anniversary celebration, according to
Richard Bennett, associate director of
the Centennial Campaign.
In six months, a campaign plan was
developed, outlining "the type of cam
paign, the institutional needs for a cam
paign and the size and feasibility of the
campaign," said Centennial Campaign
director Bruce Hinchliffe.
The campaign staff, which currently
numbers 200, also made a preliminary
evaluation of potential donors among
alumni and corporations. The staff
enlisted 3,000 volunteers around the
country.
The next step involved creating a pub
licity booklet, the case statement, which
was published in 1986.
The 40-page, glossy document con
tains explanations of each fund-raising

need, messages from University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse and paintings and pho
tographs of Stanford.
"The case Statement was an out
growth of the campaign plan," Hinch
liffe said. It "articulated the vision, pur
pose and goals of the Campaign" and
became "one of the (first) mtyor commu
nication vehicles," he added.
Kennedy personally presented the
case statement to potential donors —
both corporate and alumni — at Cam
paign banquets around the country.
Meanwhile, various divisions of the
Development Office divided the overall
campaign into several specific areas,
including an annual fund-raising plan, a
large gift plan and a corporate founda
tion plan.
The University also coordinated
"screening sessions" in 140 cities around
the country where volunteer alumni
would examine local lists of people and
identify those who might want to donate
to the campaign.
In 1987, with all the preparations
complete, the fund raising began. In the
past three years, the University has used
several different methods in the cam
paign.
For example, the Development Office
tracks alumni whose donations are
increasing and then approaches them to
give money to key parts of the Cam
paign.
Individual University representatives
visit potential corporate and alumni
donors over a period of months or years
and then request gifts.
Student efforts have participated in
fund-raising events such as the "Senior
Pledge," the "Junior Event"and the
"Sophomore PhoneFest" tele
thon, all sponsored by the Stan
ford Alumni Association. These
events "introduce volunteer and
fund-raising ideas to students,"
said Lucy Kohlmeier, associate
director of the Development
Office's Class Fund.
Although certain targeted

areas lag behind, the Campaign is
six months ahead of its overall
schedule, Bennett said. As a
result, the staff can concentrate
on meeting the goals of the lag
ging areas.
"People tend to focus on the
actual dollar figure, but what's
more important is getting the
funding for what is needed," Ben
nett explained. Therefore, the
Campaign will continue to raise
funds even after it has met its
$1.1 billion overall goal, he said.

Areas of the University tar
geted to receive Campaign funds
include:
• Undergraduate education —
student financial aid and student
research;
• Faculty — endowed humani
ties and social sciences professor
ships and faculty research;
• Near West campus develop
ment; and
• New facilities — additional
student housing and athletic and
academic buildings.
