# After 500 are turned away:
## Flicks may move late show to 10 p.m. 
### Abigail Derecho 
In an attempt to prevent the crowd
problems at last Sunday's ASSU Sun
day Flicks from reoccurring, Flicks
management may decide to move the
late showing from 9:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.
According to Stanford Police officers
who were present, about 2,500 students
gathered outside 1,700-seat Memorial
Auditorium to see the late showing of
"Pretty Woman," the year's first flick.
According to police, students were
pushing and shoving, and"the crowd
nearly overwhelmed the ticket-takers."
Police estimated 500 to 700 students
were turned away at the front door.
The officers assisted one woman who
feared being trampled by the masses,
but since the crowd was not riotous, no
further action was taken, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton.
"The problem with the first Flick of

the year is that several thousand people
show up for the late show," Flicks man
ager Bob Florsheim said. "Ideally, the
late show will begin at 10 p.m., so people
can clear out from the early show and
the late show crowd can be let in as they
come."
Florsheim called rescheduling the
late show "a strong possibility," but said
that the ASSU project managers will
discuss other suggestions for crowd con
trol at a future meeting.
Various measures, such as barricades
at the foot of the Memorial Auditorium
steps and added security personnel, will
be considered. In addition, Florsheim
said he "welcomes any suggestions from
the student body."
Later this week, Herrington will dis
cuss with acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson how Flicks manage
ment can better control late show
crowds.
"We're very concerned about over

crowding in Memorial Auditorium,
Herrington said. "It's an old facility -
we can't have people sitting in the
aisles "
"We [police officers] will make an
appearance if necessary, but we have to
make sure that the management is
doing their best to take care of the prob
lem, he added.
Florsheim said the ASSU will
attempt to create a plan to control
crowds for this year and future years.
However, Florsheim said the overcrowd
ing problem would not exist if more stu
dents attended the 7 p.m. showing
instead of the 9:30 p.m. show.
"Approximately 3,000 Flicks passes
were sold," he said. "Unfortunately, the
9:30 show is what everyone wants to go
to."
"In order for us to continue showing
the films we show, I don't think it's
unreasonable to ask people to come to
the early show," Florsheim noted.
