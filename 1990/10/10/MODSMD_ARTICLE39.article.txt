# Health care will be focus of conference
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
The United States currently spends
more on public health care than any
other country in the world. So evidence
that about one in every six Americans
receives inadequate health care poses a
particularly ironic problem, one that
Stanford students chose to examine in
this year's You Can Make a Difference
Conference.
The conference, slated for Jan. 26,
1991, is the eighth annual You Can
Make a Difference event, in which
speakers and workshops address a par
ticular social problem and inform the
public on how to produce positive
change.
Past conferences focused on topics
like environmental conservation and
the nation's education system.
The biggest hurdles facing the project
were manpower and money shortages,
said project coordinator Ron Park.
Park, a medical student, said the
manpower problem was solved dramati
cally Monday night, as more than 60
people crowded into Tresidder's Cypress
North room for an organizational meet
ing.
But the money problem lingers. Park
said that due to University budget cuts,
the conference will for the first time in
its history have to rely on off-campus
fund raising for the majority of its
money.

Conference coordinators set a goal of
raising $30,000 from off-campus
sources. While concerned about fund
raising, Park said he does not think
obtaining the money will present a
major obstacle to the conference's suc
cess.
"Health care is becoming one of the
hottest issues of the '905," he said.
"Companies are being squeezed to the
bone just to provide health care for their
workers." Park said businesses' interest
in reducing the cost of health care for
their workers will facilitate obtaining
corporate sponsorship.
According to Park, statistics show a
large discrepancy between the amount
the nation spends on health care and
theamount of care many Americans
receive. He said federal, state and local
governments spent about $650 billion
last year on health care — more than
the budgets for defense and education
combined.
Despite this massive spending, about
37 million Americans are without
health insurance, which denies them
access to the health care system. The
lack of health care is reflected in
national health statistics, which rank
the United States 15th among industri
alized nations. Health statistics for
American black males average near
those of males in several developing
nations.
This year's conference may include a
keynote speech by Surgeon General

Antonia Novello, as well as a panel dis
cussion that includes Dr. David
Lawrence, Vice-Chairman of Kaiser Per
manente Medical Group; Walter Maher,
Chrysler Corporation's Director of Fed
eral Relations and Dr. Janet Mitchell,
Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology in
New York's Harlem Hospital.
The closing keynote speaker will be
Senator John Rockefeller, the chair of
the recent Pepper Commission address
ing the state of health care in America.
The day-long conference also will pre
sent a series of workshops, each focus
ing on a specific aspect of the health care
problem. Workshop Coordinator Rena
Kramer, a senior, said possible topics
include AIDS, health care for the home
less and elderly and mental health.
Whatever challenges organizers face,
there seems to be no shortage of enthu
siasm for the project among volunteers.
Sophomore George Zanazzi said, "I
wanted to volunteer in some public ser
vice and the fact that it was health care
made me want to do it."
Senior Kari Hironaka said she was
"really impressed by past You Can Make
a Difference Conferences" and thought
working on the project would be a good
way to learn more about health care in
America.
Those still interested in volunteering
for the project can call the conference
office at 725-2872 or attend a meeting
today at 9:15 p.m. in the Tresidder
Cypress North Room.

in reducing the cost of health care for
their workers will facilitate obtaining
corporate sponsorship.
According to Park, statistics show a
large discrepancy between the amount
the nation spends on health care and
theamount of care many Americans
receive. He said federal, state and local
governments spent about $650 billion
last year on health care — more than
the budgets for defense and education
combined.
Despite this massive spending, about
37 million Americans are without
health insurance, which denies them
access to the health care system. The
lack of health care is reflected in
national health statistics, which rank
the United States 15th among industri
alized nations. Health statistics for
American black males average near
those of males in several developing
nations.
This year's conference may include a
keynote speech by Surgeon General

Antonia Novello, as well as a panel dis
cussion that includes Dr. David
Lawrence, Vice-Chairman of Kaiser Per
manente Medical Group; Walter Maher,

eral Relations and Dr. Janet Mitchell,
Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology in
New York's Harlem Hospital.
The closing keynote speaker will be
Senator John Rockefeller, the chair of
the recent Pepper Commission address
ing the state of health care in America.
The day-long conference also will pre
sent a series of workshops, each focus
ing on a specific aspect of the health care
problem. Workshop Coordinator Rena
Kramer, a senior, said possible topics
include AIDS, health care for the home
less and elderly and mental health.
Whatever challenges organizers face,
there seems to be no shortage of enthu
siasm for the project among volunteers.
Sophomore George Zanazzi said, "I
wanted to volunteer in some public ser
vice and the fact that it was health care
made me want to do it."
Senior Kari Hironaka said she was
"really impressed by past You Can Make
a Difference Conferences" and thought
working on the project would be a good
way to learn more about health care in
America.
Those still interested in volunteering
for the project can call the conference
office at 725-2872 or attend a meeting
today at 9:15 p.m. in the Tresidder
Cypress North Room.
