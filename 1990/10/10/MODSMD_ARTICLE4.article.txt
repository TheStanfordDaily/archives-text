# Nom Com may face reforms
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
As the ASSU Nominations
Commission begins interview
ing students for University com
mittees today, many in the
ASSU and some University
administrators are talking
about problems with the com
mission and are considering
reforming it.
The commission recom
mends students for dozens of
committees, ranging from the
Rhodes/Marshall Panel to the
Committee for Undergraduate
Studies. The ASSU Senate then
ratifies the nominations, and

University President Donald
Kennedy makes final appoint
ments.
But the old system hasn't
proven very effective, said
ASSU administrative manager
Sophia Shing. She pointed to
the cost of advertising for appli
cations to the various commit
tees, as well as the extensive
time spent interviewing, as evi
dence of the commission's inef
ficiency.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to
the president, said "the result of
the Nominations Commission's
deliberations is supposed to be a


Valerie Mih
list with a nominee for every posi
tion at a timely point at the end of
spring quarter. [Each year] the
list has had more and more
unfilled openings and lacked a bit
in form."
For example, Hamrdla said,
last spring's list had more than a
third of the spots open and gave
no reasons why particular nomi
nees were qualified.
According to Nominations
Commission chair Valerie Mih, a
senior, "For the past few years,
there's been some difficulty in
[the Nominations Commission]
appointing members to over 130
positions in the spring."
For example, the commission is
responsible for nominating three
students to the Committee on
Graduate Studies, which deliber
ates on issues such as teaching
assistant appointments and
degree requirements. However,
committee staffer Ann Fletcher
said the Nominations Commis
sion only nominated one student
last year and two students this

year. Each year the graduate stud
ies committee has had to appoint
students on its own, bypassing the
ASSU commission altogether.
Fletcher said that without stu
dents on the committee, there is
"no student point of view on
issues that affect them."
She also described an incident
in which a student showed up for
Nominations Commission inter
views and there were no commis
sioners there to interview him.
Michael Canul, another mem
ber of the commission, said that
part of the problem this year was
that he, Mih and the other four
commissioners were not
appointed until spring quarter
last year, instead of in the winter.
"We were selected so late, we
didn't end up running a good pro
cess at all," he said. "We were
under an amazing time crush."
Canul estimated the commis
sion was able to fill approximately
half of the slots last June and
July, much later than usual.
Because not all the positions were
filled, the commission is currently
undergoing a second interviewing
process.
He said that the commission
has a "much better process right

ture of the nomina
tions process.

now than last spring" in that it
has a chair and has done outreach
and advertising for the various
slots.
Mih said the commission has
received many applications this
fall, including many from fresh
men.
But despite the commission's
efforts this fall, many in the
ASSU are looking at reforming
the structure of the nominations
process. "We'll discuss possible
reforms and changes at the end of
this quarter," Mih said. She men
tioned as one possibility having
the commission appoint students
only to the more popular commit
tees.
But Mih expects to solicit input
from a variety of sources before
suggesting changes in the nomi
nation structure. "We'll try to pull

together a lot of people and get a
lot of ideas about how things
could be changed," she said.
According to Canul, Kennedy
sent Mih a letter last summer
indicating that unless the Nomi
nations Commission improves its
efficiency, the University would
have to find a "new way of naming
students to committees."
But Hamrdla said to his knowl
edge, no change is imminent.
"There's no proof yet that we
need a new structure," he said. "I
don't know that we're interested
in having the ASSU pull out" of
nominating students to commit
tees.
Hamrdla said because the com
missions had no nominations
ready before June 1, Kennedy told
the "appointing authorities" for
the various committees that they
could bypass the Nominations
Commission altogether if they
needed student committee mem
bers.
Kennedy allowed them to
appoint students of their choice to
their committees. Hamrdla said
that this had already happened in
at least two instances, one of
which was the Committee on
Graduate Studies.

slots.
Mih said the commission has
received many applications this
fall, including many from fresh
men.
But despite the commission's
efforts this fall, many in the
ASSU are looking at reforming
the structure of the nominations
process. "We'll discuss possible
reforms and changes at the end of
this quarter," Mih said. She men
tioned as one possibility having
the commission appoint students
only to the more popular commit
tees.
But Mih expects to solicit input
from a variety of sources before
suggesting changes in the nomi
nation structure. "We'll try to pull

together a lot of people and get a
lot of ideas about how things
could be changed," she said.
According to Canul, Kennedy
sent Mih a letter last summer
indicating that unless the Nomi
nations Commission improves its
efficiency, the University would
have to find a "new way of naming
students to committees."
But Hamrdla said to his knowl
edge, no change is imminent.
"There's no proof yet that we
need a new structure," he said. "I
don't know that we're interested
in having the ASSU pull out" of
nominating students to commit
tees.
Hamrdla said because the com
missions had no nominations
ready before June 1, Kennedy told
the "appointing authorities" for
the various committees that they
could bypass the Nominations
Commission altogether if they
needed student committee mem
bers.
Kennedy allowed them to
appoint students of their choice to
their committees. Hamrdla said
that this had already happened in
at least two instances, one of
which was the Committee on
Graduate Studies.
As the ASSU Nominations
Commission begins interview
ing students for University com
mittees today, many in the
ASSU and some University
administrators are talking
about problems with the com
mission and are considering
reforming it.
The commission recom
mends students for dozens of
committees, ranging from the
Rhodes/Marshall Panel to the
Committee for Undergraduate
Studies. The ASSU Senate then
ratifies the nominations, and

University President Donald
Kennedy makes final appoint
ments.
But the old system hasn't
proven very effective, said
ASSU administrative manager
Sophia Shing. She pointed to
the cost of advertising for appli
cations to the various commit
tees, as well as the extensive
time spent interviewing, as evi
dence of the commission's inef
ficiency.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to
the president, said "the result of
the Nominations Commission's
deliberations is supposed to be a


Valerie Mih
list with a nominee for every posi
tion at a timely point at the end of
spring quarter. [Each year] the
list has had more and more
unfilled openings and lacked a bit
in form."
For example, Hamrdla said,
last spring's list had more than a
third of the spots open and gave
no reasons why particular nomi
nees were qualified.
According to Nominations
Commission chair Valerie Mih, a
senior, "For the past few years,
there's been some difficulty in
[the Nominations Commission]
appointing members to over 130
positions in the spring."
For example, the commission is
responsible for nominating three
students to the Committee on
Graduate Studies, which deliber
ates on issues such as teaching
assistant appointments and
degree requirements. However,
committee staffer Ann Fletcher
said the Nominations Commis
sion only nominated one student
last year and two students this

year. Each year the graduate stud
ies committee has had to appoint
students on its own, bypassing the
ASSU commission altogether.
Fletcher said that without stu
dents on the committee, there is
"no student point of view on
issues that affect them."
She also described an incident
in which a student showed up for
Nominations Commission inter
views and there were no commis
sioners there to interview him.
Michael Canul, another mem
ber of the commission, said that
part of the problem this year was
that he, Mih and the other four
commissioners were not
appointed until spring quarter
last year, instead of in the winter.
"We were selected so late, we
didn't end up running a good pro
cess at all," he said. "We were
under an amazing time crush."
Canul estimated the commis
sion was able to fill approximately
half of the slots last June and
July, much later than usual.
Because not all the positions were
filled, the commission is currently
undergoing a second interviewing
process.
He said that the commission
has a "much better process right

ture of the nomina

and advertising for the various
