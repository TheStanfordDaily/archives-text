A Bay Area photographer's labor of love has cul
minated in a photo display that gives viewers a taste
of Stanford's past juxtaposed with images of the pre
sent.
The once bare, cream-colored walls of Memorial
Auditorium are now decorated with archival pho
tographs of the University mounted next to contem
porary photos.
The modern photos were taken by Peter Hen
ricks, a Mill Valley photographer who has works
published in the book "Stanford: From the Foothills
to the Bay." Henricks, who occasionally photographs
for the monthly Stanford Magazine, got the idea to
do the project for Stanford's Centennial Celebration.
Henricks said he undertook the task "because I
love the University so much, even though I didn't go
to school [here]." He said his dedication to the pro
ject prompted him to reach into his own pockets
when costs exceeded the $3,600 allotted by the Cen
tennial Operating Committee.
The work involved printing, planning and shoot
ing pictures for one year. With the help of University
Archivist Margaret Kimball and her associates,
Linda Long and Steve Mandeville-Gamble, Henricks
was able to borrow prints overnight and return
them the following day.
From partial historical records, he determined
the time of year and day the shots were taken, and
the camera angle used. Then, he started taking his

own pictures.
The archival photos, mounted next to the mod
ern black and white photos, are in perfect condition.
One dramatic pair of photos compare the inside of
Memorial Church's fallen dome in 1906 to the
severely damaged interior after last year's 7.1 tem
blor.
Only one empty frame in Memorial Auditorium
remains in the lobby. Henricks plans to shoot a pic
ture to fill it on Oct. 1, 1991 at the reopening day
ceremony. This new photo will correspond to a photo
of the Oct. 1, 1891 opening day ceremony.
Those who are interested in viewing the photos
will have time to see them this year and "perhaps
the photos will remain there permanently," said
Susan Wolfe, associate director of the Centennial
Celebration.
Henricks said he thinks those who see the photos
will agree that "as much as things change, they stay
the same and these photographs show how true that
is at this University."
