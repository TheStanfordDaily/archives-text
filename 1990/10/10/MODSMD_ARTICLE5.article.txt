# On its anniversary, SAIO celebrates 20 years of community
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
It's an organization that represents
one of the smallest segments of the Uni
versity community, yet it led a successful
drive to replace Stanford's mascot and it
coordinates the largest annual student
run event.
It's the Stanford American Indian
Organization — celebrating its 20th
anniversary this week.
"Though we're small, we try to have as
big an impact as we can," said Dean of the
Native American Cultural Center James
Larimore, who is also a resident fellow at
Muwekma Tah Ruk — the Native Amer
ican theme house.
Founded by four Native American stu
dents in 1970, SAIO now numbers 177
members. Native Americans at Stanford
automatically become members.
The membership includes the 127
Native American students and 50 Native
American staff members at Stanford.
There are no permanent Native Ameri
can faculty

In 1972, SAIO led a drive to replace
Stanford's mascot, a bulbous-nosed
Indian, which it considered insensitive
and racist. Despite a storm of alumni dis
approval, the 42-year-old mascot was
dropped and the Cardinal was adopted.
Cardinal has been the school color since
1920.
As part of the protest against the
Indian mascot, SAIO also held the first
annual Stanford Powwow.
The event has mushroomed in atten
dance, from 300 participants in its early
years to a crowd of 20,000 last year, mak
ing it the West Coast's largest gathering
of Native Americans. It includes tradi
tional dances and songs and authentic
vendors' booths.
Fifth-year senior Colin Hampson, who
was last year's resident assistant at
Muwekma Tah Ruk, said he believes the
Powwow is SAIO's greatest achievement,
considering the enormity of the event and
the small size of the Native American
population here.
Seeking an outlet for cultural educa
tion, SAIO created the Native American

Cultural Center in 1974.
In 1988, SAIO secured the founding of
a Native American theme house in Lath
rop, a row house which holds 30 resi
dents.
Last spring, the house was renamed

Muwekma Tah Ruk, which means
"House of the People" in the language of
the Ohlone Indians. The Ohlone lived on
what is now Stanford land 5,000 years
ago.
In recent years, SAIO has entered the
political arena in a highly visible way The
organization has assumed an active role
in camp'is politics along with other stu
dent of color gruups.
SAIO has spoken out on a variety of
issues, including the Western
Culture/CIV debates of 1987 and the
exclusion of Native Americans from the
staff report of the University Committee
on Minority Issues last year. Every year,
the organization celebrates "Rediscovery
Day" instead of Columbus Day.
The group participated in the 1987
Kainbow Agenda and the 1988 Students
of Color Coalition, two political activist
groups which also included the Black Stu
dent Union, the Asian American Student
Association and MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group.
SAIO also participated in the May
1989 takeover of University President

Donald Kennedy's office. The protesters'
demands included establishing of a
Native American Studies department and
hiring Native American professors and
full-time deans for the ethnic centers.
SAIO members are proud of the orga
nization's history of involvement with
other communities of color.
"We've seen different coalitions
around different issues," Larimore said,
"which come and go over the years." They
sometimes may seem to disappear for a
while, he added, but they always resur
face when "the communities come
together around one issue."
Hampson emphasized the organiza
tion's "soul to soul" connection with
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student group.
He said the two organizations have social
ties and share many common political
beliefs.
Because the Native American commu
nity is so small, SAIO "has had to be it"
for all the Native American students
here, said Larimore.

Though Hampson acknowledged
disagreement does sometimes
arise, "I've never heard anyone
say 'SAIO doesn't represent me',"
he said.
In fact, according to Larimore,
SAIO represents the entire
Native American community at
Stanford, not just students. And
it is a very diverse community —

the 177 Native Americans at
Stanford come from at least 50
different tribes.
With this tribal diversity, no
single group forms a majority.
"No group feels it is dominated by
any [other] group," Larimore
said.
The organization also interacts
with similar ones from around
the country through the Organi
zation of National American
Indian College Students — which
was founded last year by Stanford
students.

SAIO's small size makes it
easy for everyone to get involved,
Larimore said. However, different
levels of involvement exist. Some
participate in an "intensive way"
while others prefer to watch
actively from the sidelines, he
said.
Larimore said he appreciates
SAIO's diversity of talents, skills
and interests. "We try to nurture
peoples' interest in whatever area
they work hard at," he said.
"Then it benefits everyone."
