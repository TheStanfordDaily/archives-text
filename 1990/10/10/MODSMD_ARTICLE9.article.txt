# Overcrowding in classes causes concern

Some administrators are expressing con
cern about overcrowding in classes and say
they hope the problem is onlv temporary.
Impact on some aspects of University life is
inevitable with massive staff cuts, according
to Thomas Wasow, dean of Undergraduate
Studies. "I don't think that anybody ever said
that the educational process would remain
completely untouched, but the intention has
been to preserve core functions of the Univer
sity with a minimum of disruption," he said.
But Wasow said he doesn't think the bud
get cuts are responsible for the overcrowding.
He said he believes the overcrowding prob
lem is temporary. There is "no evidence to sug
gest that there is more of an overcrowding
problem in classes this year than there's ever
been,"he said.
But some enrollment numbers do not paint

a good picture.
In the case of some German classes, Wasow
noted, "There's been ... close to a doubling of
enrollment."
A number of Japanese classes have also
been affected. Ted Andersson, associate dean
of Undergraduate Studies, said, "The con
straint in Japanese... is that there are simply
not available teachers in Japanese. As a mat
ter of fact, there's a nationwide shortage."
As a result, classes in Japanese have seen a
marked increase in the number of students
per section over last year. The department has
not been able to keep to what Andersson calls
the optimum class size of 15 students in gen
eral language courses and fewer than 15 in
conversation classes.
Andersson, who recently had a meeting
with some Cultures, Ideas and Values lectur
ers, said the Great Works track is an area
where large section size is a concern. Section

sizes have increased to 18 or 19 students.
Wasow said he met last spring with the
Area One Program Committee and that "sec
tions were calculated at 16.5 students per sec
tion on average," he added.
"The plan that we had last spring for Great
Works was the same number of students and
the same number of sections (as the previous
year)," he said.
When asked how he viewed the problem of
overcrowding, Wasow responded that "in an
elementary language course, it would have to
be a small enough course so that there can be
real interactions between the teacher and each
of the students. That means when you're get
ting up over twenty it's a problem. I feel the
same way about the CIV sections."
"Enrollment patterns have changed and led
to some crowding, but that happens fre
quently. It's hard to anticipate [those
changes]," he added.
