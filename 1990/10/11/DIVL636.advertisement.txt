"AN EROTIC MASTERPIECE. Philip Kaufman has done
something remarkable. He has made a genuinely erotic film that celebrates a
woman's sexual awakening with unabashed enthusiasm. Fred Ward has great
humor, Uma Thurman is fascinating and Maria de Medeiros is ravishing, a
major discovery." s, rp iwn mo\ielim magwim
