# Schools have eroded Native American culture, education professor says
## 
### Dan Stearns 
Visiting Education Prof.
William Demmert targeted educa
tion as one of the most crucial
problems facing Native Americans
in a speech last night at the School
of Education.
Demmert's presentation, titled
"Indian Nations at Risk," contin
ued the weeklong celebration of
the Stanford American Indian
Organization's 20th Anniversary.
The speech was followed by a
lengthy question-and-answer ses
sion.
"The American Indian is in the
midst of a clear and identifiable
struggle," Demmert said. "The
struggle is economic, political,
social and academic."
Focusing on the educational
struggle, Demmert said "Schools
have eroded the language and cul
tural base of the Indian."
"There is direct and indirect
racism," he added, listing some of
the particular problems. "In
northern areas (Alaska) there is a
language barrier." Also, "the
Native has limited access to edu
cational grants for attending col
leges or universities."
"I have studied successful
Native leaders and noted that
they were all involved in extra
curricular activities when they

'Schools have
eroded the lan
guage and cultural
base of the Indian.'
— William Demmert

were in high school," he said. "But
few Native Indians participate in
them today."
Demmert, a Tlingit/Sioux
Indian, arrived at Stanford a week
and a half ago and will teach this
year in the School of Education.
He is also a member of the 15-
person task force U.S. Secretary of
Education Lauro Cavazos com
missioned in April to seek meth
ods to improve the education of
Native Americans. The task force
will issue a report to the federal
government next spring.
Demmert began by reading
excerpts from the task force's
report and asked the audience for
input.
In one of the more debated top
ics, one woman of Hopi descent
described how educating Native
Americans can backfire: "Going

away to college breaks the com
munity, but on the other hand, we
need the jobs."
Demmert responded by saying
that "education is an absolute
must."
"If we don't educate, our com
munities will continue to deterio
rate," he said. "The year 2000 will
bring about new technology, and
we need to be prepared."
Demmert gave a concrete
example of the importance of edu
cation and training in key voca
tions. "In circumpolar regions
many of the mammals today have
toxins in their bodies," he said.
"The people will hunt and eat
these mammals. We don't know
what problems babies will face
after being breast-fed from moth
ers who have eaten the toxined
meat. We need Native Indian doc
tors to deal with the situation."
Other problems facing Native
Americans today are a high drop
out rate in schools, teachers' unfa
miliarity with Native American
culture and a lack of counselors
and social workers for the home
less and unemployed, Demmert
said.
He said he was "optimistic"
about his report to the govern
ment. "Our goal is to give the
opportunity of an education to
those who want it."
