Shuttle lands in SoCal
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP)
— Shuttle Discovery sailed out of orbit and
landed yesterday after a four-day flight that
boosted NASA's confidence and sent a space
craft on a five-year mission to explore the sun's
poles.
"If you criticize our mistakes, then you
must also acknowledge our successes," space
shuttle director and former astronaut Robert
Crippen said after completion of the first shut
tle flight in nearly six months.
"I'm elated," he added. "It's been a long hot
summer, I'll tell you that. It's nice to be back
flying again. It is a high day for us."
About 5,500 spectators cheered as Discovery
touched down at 6:57 a.m. PDT, just seconds
before the sun rose over hills to the east. It was
the third smallest crowd for any shuttle land
ing open to public viewing.
