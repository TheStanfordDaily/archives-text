# Hundreds evacuate as more die in Gulf
## 
### 
(AP) — A plane carrying about
400 Americans and other foreign
captives in Kuwait and Iraq
arrived yesterday in Baghdad on a
planned flight to freedom in
America. Earlier, an Air Force jet
crashed in Saudi Arabia, killing
both crewmen.
Most of those aboard the Iraqi
Airways Boeing 747 had been held
in occupied Kuwait and signed up
for the first U.S.-chartered evacu
ation flight from there since Sept.
22. They were taken by bus to
Basra, Iraq. The State Depart
ment in Washington said they
then flew on a 50-minute flight to
the Iraqi capital.
It was not known when the for
eigners would be allowed to leave
for Britain and onward to North
Carolina. Officials in Washington
said it was believed the arrival at
the Raleigh-Durham airport
would occur today.
As in previous evacuation
flights, arrangements called for
Westerners on board to be limited
to women and children and to
Americans of Arab ancestry.
The jet crash yesterday was the
fourth U.S. military air accident
since the United States began
deploying forces in the Persian
Gulf region following Iraq's inva
sion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Two
helicopters also disappeared dur
ing a training flight. In all, 24 ser
vicemen have died and eight are
missing.
Meanwhile, the 10-week-old
crisis brought more bad news for
the U.S. economy Oil prices rose
to a record $41.15 a barrel on the
New York Exchange before closing
at $38.69, tumbling on an erro
neous rumor Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein had been killed.
On Tuesday, oil closed at
$40.40.
Traders said prices were
pushed higher in part by the slay
ings of 19 Palestinians in a clash
with police in Jerusalem on Mon
day, and by Saddam's threat to
retaliate against Israel.
On the New York Stock
Exchange, the Dow Jones indus
trial average fell 37.62 points to
2,407.92, its lowest since May
1989.
Saddam said Tuesday that Iraq
had added another missile to its

arsenal that could be launched
"against the targets of evil when
the day of reckoning comes."
He made it clear he was refer
ring to Israel and the U.S.-led
forces sent to Saudi Arabia after
Kuwait was captured. About
170,000 U.S. forces are deployed
in Saudi Arabia and on warships
in the gulf region.
Saddam has repeatedly tried to
link the status of Palestinians in
the Israeli-occupied territories
with Kuwait.
In Washington, families of
seven U.S. service personnel in the
crisis area; two congressmen —
Reps. Jim Moody and Gerald
Kleczka, both Wisconsin
Democrats —and religious leaders
expressed their concern at a news
conference about the military
deployment in Saudi Arabia.
The families wrote in an open
letter to Bush, "The Persian Gulf
crisis is not just a constitutional, a
military or an economic crisis. It is
a family crisis. All across the coun
try families are facing the possible
death of loved ones in a military
offensive they do not support."
They urged Bush to pledge no
offensive action and to make the
U.S. forces part of a "truly multi
national and purely defensive
peacekeeping force."
The United States has so far
taken no military action in the
gulf, but at least two dozen ser
vicemen have died in training or
other accidents, the Pentagon said
Wednesday.
Yesterday, an F-11l fighter
plane crashed in the southern
Arabian peninsula on a training
mission, U.S. military spokesman
Lt. Cmdr. J.D. van Sickle said,
adding that an investigation was
under way.
The Air Force identified the
victims as Capt. Fredrick A. Reid
of Harrisburg, Pa., the pilot, and
Capt. Thomas R. Caldwell of
Columbus, Ohio, the weapons sys
tems officer.
The Navy said it found no sur
vivors of the crash of two heli
copters over the northern Arabian
Sea on Monday and was suspend

In Washington, families of

expressed their concern at a news
conference about the military
deployment in Saudi Arabia.

letter to Bush, "The Persian Gulf
crisis is not just a constitutional, a
military or an economic crisis. It is
a family crisis. All across the coun

offensive they do not support."
They urged Bush to pledge no
offensive action and to make the
U.S. forces part of a "truly multi
national and purely defensive
peacekeeping force."

taken no military action in the
gulf, but at least two dozen ser

other accidents, the Pentagon said
Wednesday.

(AP) — A plane carrying about
400 Americans and other foreign
captives in Kuwait and Iraq
arrived yesterday in Baghdad on a
planned flight to freedom in
America. Earlier, an Air Force jet
crashed in Saudi Arabia, killing
both crewmen.
Most of those aboard the Iraqi
Airways Boeing 747 had been held
in occupied Kuwait and signed up
for the first U.S.-chartered evacu
ation flight from there since Sept.
22. They were taken by bus to
Basra, Iraq. The State Depart
ment in Washington said they
then flew on a 50-minute flight to
the Iraqi capital.
It was not known when the for
eigners would be allowed to leave
for Britain and onward to North
Carolina. Officials in Washington
said it was believed the arrival at
the Raleigh-Durham airport
would occur today.
As in previous evacuation
flights, arrangements called for
Westerners on board to be limited
to women and children and to
Americans of Arab ancestry.
The jet crash yesterday was the
fourth U.S. military air accident
since the United States began
deploying forces in the Persian
Gulf region following Iraq's inva
sion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Two
helicopters also disappeared dur
ing a training flight. In all, 24 ser
vicemen have died and eight are
missing.
Meanwhile, the 10-week-old
crisis brought more bad news for
the U.S. economy Oil prices rose
to a record $41.15 a barrel on the
New York Exchange before closing
at $38.69, tumbling on an erro
neous rumor Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein had been killed.
On Tuesday, oil closed at
$40.40.
Traders said prices were
pushed higher in part by the slay
ings of 19 Palestinians in a clash
with police in Jerusalem on Mon
day, and by Saddam's threat to
retaliate against Israel.
On the New York Stock
Exchange, the Dow Jones indus
trial average fell 37.62 points to
2,407.92, its lowest since May
1989.
