# Israel investigates killings

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Israel yesterday
appointed a panel headed by a former spy
chief to investigate the killing of 19 Pales
tinians in a riot on the Temple Mount. It
also rejected U.S. charges that police used
excessive force.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's gov
ernment urged Jews to gather at the Wail
ing Wall at the end of the religious festival
of Sukkot today in a show of defiance of the
Arab stoning attack that precipitated the
bloodbath.
To block further violence, the army kept
more than a million Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip con
fined to their homes by curfew. In
Jerusalem, police fired tear gas to break up
numerous protests by Palestinians.

Arab hospital officials in Gaza and the
West Bank said they treated at least 14
Palestinians shot and wounded by soldiers
in scattered clashes.
In Jordan, protests by thousands of Jor
danian and Palestinian university students
continued for the third day yesterday
Monday's rioting at the Temple Mount, a
site holy to both Jews and Moslems, began
with Palestinians stoning Jewish wor
shipers. Police charged onto the Mount,
first firing tear gas and then live ammuni
tion.
Shamir authorized the inquiry hours
before the U.N. Security Council was
expected to debate a resolution condemning
the "particularly excessive Israeli
response" to the Monday riot.
