# Bush keeps mum about taxes, says, 'read my hips'

WASHINGTON (AP) - Confusion
over President Bush's position on
higher taxes slowed congressional
efforts yesterday to start work in
earnest on a new budget agreement.
Bush showed no inclination to clar
ify matters, saying, "Let Congress
clear it up," and threatening to shut
down the government again if he
doesn't get an acceptable deal.
Congressional Democrats com
plained that an apparent Bush rejec
tion of higher taxes on the wealthiest
Americans — a reversal of the position
he took at his news conference Tues
day — would make it tougher to forge
a budget compromise.
But there was no shortage of
options, as both Republicans and
Democrats began floating new ver
sions of tax and spending plans on
Capitol Hill.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., and other lawmakers who met

with the president Tuesday night said
he had not ruled out the tax boost at
that private meeting, as reported by
Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters that Bush
"listened to" the GOP lawmakers
rather than stating a position.
Bush, on a campaign trip in the
South, was asked repeatedly about the
matter, but turned away the questions
with wisecracks.
He was asked as he jogged during a
break in St. Petersburg, Fla., if he
would care to clear up the confusion.
"Confusion?" he responded.
Was he giving up on his long-sought
capital gains tax rate cut, the item the
Democrats supposedly were to trade
for his support of higher income taxes
on rich people?
"Read my hips," he said, pointing,
as he jogged by.
Could he clear up his position?

"Let Congress clear it up."
At a fundraising reception in
Atlanta, Bush said he vetoed the tem
porary spending bill last weekend,
shutting down the government, to
keep the pressure on Congress that
otherwise would have gone home.
The bill that eventually passed
expires Oct. 19. "The clock is running
and it's going to keep on running, and
I'll veto it again if we don't get a satis
factory deal," Bush said.
The Senate Finance Committee
indefinitely postponed a meeting at
which it was to discuss a budget pack
age written by its chairman, Texas
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, generally in
line with the tax trade Bush endorsed
at his news conference.
"I had the deal all worked out until
the president changed his position on
taxes," said Bentsen.
Across the Capitol, the House Ways
and Means Committee adopted a plan

on a voice vote written by its chair
man, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-111.
The package was similar to the mea
sure Bentsen's panel had readied,
although it would add restrictions on
tax deductions available to people
earning more than $100,000 annually.
It also would add private planes
worth more than $100,000 to the list
of luxury items subject to a new 10
percent tax and place a 2-cent-per-gal
lon tax on petroleum products, exclud
ing home-heating oil.
Medicare spending is expected to be
cut, though not as much as in the bud
get package rejected by the House last
week, and taxes are axpected to be
increased on such consumer items as
gasoline, tobacco and alcohol.
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said, "I had hoped
for agreement on tax proposals along
the lines Sen. Bentsen had indicated."
