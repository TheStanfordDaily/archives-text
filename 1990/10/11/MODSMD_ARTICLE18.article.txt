## A 						teach-in that didn't 
### 
The teach-in on the
Middle East crisis
should have taught

Last Monday's teach-in
on the Persian Gulf crisis was
both a success and a failure.
The event was successful in that
it raised a number of crucial issues
that have rarely been heard in
national debate. These issues have
so far been either neglected or
ignored by the American press.
For example, the keynote
address by Paciflca Radio corre
spondent Larry Bensky raised a
number of key issues related to the
coverage by the press of the Middle
East crisis.
Particularly in weekly news
magazines such as Time and
Newsweek, coverage has been bla
tantly biased in favor of military
intervention and an American first
strike against Iraq.
This coverage fails to take into
account the legitimacy of anti-
American sentiment within much
of the Arab world, much of it due to
American actions that have under
mined Arab and Islamic move
ments in the past.
However, the teach-in failed to
give a balanced presentation of
viewpoints and attract the number
of people that should be expected
for such an important event.
Instead of taking the approach
of a teach-in, the event had a ten
dency to take the approach of a
"preach-in," presenting only one
viewpoint of a complex and highly
divisive issue.
This format was, of course, cho
sen for a reason. The rationale for
the one-sided approach was that
the American public has so far
been presented with only one side

of the issue, that of the American
government.
The American version of events
has dominated the press, denying a
forum for those in opposition to
U.S. intervention.
But the teach-in failed to serve
the purpose of educating the Stan
ford community. Instead, the event
served to educate the community
about one particular viewpoint in
the Gulf crisis.
The teach-in organizers should
have either advertised the event in
advance as a presentation of alter
nate viewpoints, or presented at
least one debate between a speaker
in favor of American intervention
and one against it if the presenters
wanted to gain more credibility for
the teach-in.
One of the most important
issues raised by the event was seen
not in the speeches or panels dis
cussing the Middle East, but in the
poor attendance for such a large
event.
Interest in attending the event
apparently was confined to mostly
off-campus community members
and bypassed the students almost
entirely. Given the nature of the
issue, it is remarkable that so few
students saw fit to attend the
event.
This generation of students
must at some point become
involved in the crisis, either by
supporting or opposing American
intervention now, or else being sent
to fight and possibly die on the
desert battlefields in the future.
Perhaps it is still too early in the
crisis to conceive of the reinstitu
tion of the draft and a massive mil
itary deployment to rival that of
the Vietnam War.
But students must become
aware of the possible dangers that
await them in the future. If noth
ing is said at this point, it may be
too late once a war does begin and
students are sent to the front lines.
