# GAO officials meet with Kennedy today

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Officials from the General
Accounting Office will meet for
three hours this morning with
University President Donald
Kennedy and other administra
tors as the agency begins its inves
tigation of Stanford's indirect
cost practices.
The GAO is one of two federal
agencies currently examining the
process by which Stanford has
been reimbursed for indirect costs
of federally sponsored research
here during the last decade. The
Office of Naval Research, the fed
eral agency with which Stanford
negotiates its indirect costs, is also
conducting an investigation.
Kennedy has said the Univer
sity will cooperate fully with the
investigations and has nothing to
hide. "We'll essentially open our
books," he said.
An internal audit of Stanford's

indirect costs during the last
decade has been completed and
was delivered to Kennedy over the
weekend. The document is
expected to be released to the pub
lic sometime next week.
Indirect costs are costs
incurred by researchers that are
not easily attributable to a specific
project. These costs include elec
tricity, building depreciation and
researchers' use of libraries.
In addition to Stanford, the
GAO is examining indirect-cost
practices at Harvard Medical
School and two other universities.
The investigation, which was
requested by the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations, is expected to take several
months.
The ONR investigation was
apparently prompted by a letter
written by Paul Biddle, the ONR
representative at Stanford, to his
superior. In his letter, Biddle
claims Stanford's relationship
with the ONR has been marred by
"fraud" and "abuse." University
officials have denied any wrongdo
ing on Stanford's part.
Several weeks ago, reports sur
faced in the Bay Area media that
Stanford had overbilled the fed
eral government for indirect costs
by as much as $300 million over
the past decade. Stanford admin
istrators have dismissed this fig
ure, saying it was irresponsible for
the area media to report unveri
fied information from unnamed
sources.
During the past decade, Stan
ford received $554 million in indi
rect-cost recovery from the federal
government, according to Dean of
Research Robert Byer.
