## We just want a little respect 
### 
AS I WALKED TO CLASS ONE DAY
with a friend, I heard a man yell at
us from across the Quad.
"Yo! Sweet-butterscotch-sayshaying
them-hips-honey-dipped-princess, what's
your name?"
"Who, me?" I asked.
"Yes you, fine little mama," the man
replied as he approached us.
"Well, uh, my name is Heidi. But, uh,
are you sure you don't want to talk to my
friend here? She's blonde and ..."
"Naw, baby. I'm talking to you. Them
Scandinavian babes are out."
"Out?"
"Yeah, out. I want me a fine, post-
Oprah-Winfrey black lady.
"See, Oprah made all you sisters angry
at black men talking about 'he-done-left
me-for' and 'he-done-did-me-wrong'
when, in fact, we haven't 'done' a thing."
"But that's exactly the problem
according to some black women," I
quipped.
"Listen, Oprah just dogs the black man
every chance she gets whether it's justi
fied or not.
He continued, "They've got you all in
such a rage at black men that some of us
didn't want to mess with y'all at all. But
it's a new age now."
"It is?"
"Baby, didn't you read Shahrazad Ali's
book 'The Blackman's Guide to Under
standing the Blackwoman'?" he asked,
waving a copy of the book in the air like it
was the Holy Word. "This lady's talking
about going back to the good old days
when black women weren't always scuf
fling with their men.

"Now don't get me wrong. I'm not
going for some of the stuff the woman
says because she says some outlandish
things," he continued.
"Like this one part where Mrs. Ali
writes: 'If [the Blackwoman] ignores the
authority and superiority of the Black
man, there is a penalty. When she crosses
this line and becomes viciously insulting,
it is time for the Blackman to soundly
slap her in the mouth' "
"Now, I can't be hitting on a woman I
love," he said. "But I do want to have the
pants on in the house."
"But you want me to iron them," I
sneered.
"Listen, I work hard every day. I can't
worry about all that ironing, washing and
cleaning. The black woman should enjoy
showing me her love by helping me with
those kind of chores."
"Well, you know, she could always go
out and find herself some white man or
something," I said.
"She ain't gonna do that because those
brothers may not want her anyway. White
men just aren't interested in dating black
women because most of them don't see
black as beautiful."
"This conversation is going nowhere,"
I said with exasperation.
"Hold up, baby. All I'm saying is this:
black men love black women. You are our
mothers, sisters, lovers, and friends. But
we just want some R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
Understand?"
"I understand. It just seems like you
could get it some other way than by trying
to belittle the black woman.
"Remember, you've got to give respect

to get it. And yeah, you're probably right.
There's no need for all the negativity
about black men, but at the same time it's
important to tell the truth. Black men
aren't perfect. "
"But then again neither are black
women," he said.
"You're absolutely right," I said. "And
we love you too, you know. You are our
fathers, and brothers, and lovers, and
friends. We need you just as much as you
all need us. Maybe we can figure this out
together," I said.
"Yeah, let's figure it out together,
baby."
"Wait. I still don't get it. How come you
thought I'd be the one who would cook
and clean and stand a step behind you all
the way?" I asked.
"Well, you subdued all them kinky
curls on your head, so I thought you had
subdued all those feminist ideas too. See,
without that quasi-Afro-look, you don't
look like you've got an attitude."
"Whatever! I just thought it might
have been something do with the light
skinned/dark-skinned issue. But I guess
that's something else entirely. Or is it?"
