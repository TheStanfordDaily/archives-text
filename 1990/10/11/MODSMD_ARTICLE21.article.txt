New meal policy has nearly destroyed language tables

PRESIDENT KENNEDY, YOU
HAVE recently confirmed Stan
ford's commitment to academic
excellence, and yet another university
polity has all but eliminated one type of
education which is unavailable through
lectures, readings, and experiments.
Through the removal of the meal
exchange card program, the University
has not only practically done away with
the most popular mealtime means of
meeting friends from other dorms, but it
has also undercut the effectiveness of
theme houses.
Morp specifically, the policy change
has nearly destroyed the theme house
language table programs.
Languages are not easy to master, and
practical experience is much more diffi
cult to acquire than book-learned knowl
edge. The social nuances of languages

are perhaps the most difficult points to
master, or even to get a grip on.
Language tables have been the most
effective method available on the Stan
ford campus for teaching such nuances.
Professors have unreservedly claimed
how those students who regularly attend
language tables generally progress at a
more rapid rate in understanding their
chosen language of study than other stu
dents.
Language tables also promote quality
interaction between graduate students
and undergraduate students, interaction
which is largely nonexistent on this cam
pus.
Through natives interacting with stu
dents of all abilities, language table con
versations serve a necessary function in
our academic community.
Yet the eradication of meal exchange

cards has brought serious question to
the University's commitment to the aca
demics in theme houses.
For instance, we at Slavianski Dom
are effectively unable to continue our
Russian Table due to the elimination of
meal exchange cards.
How can a self-op like ourselves afford
to invite dozens of people to learn and to
perfect practical language skills over
lunch or dinner?
We cannot absorb the cost of food and
a cook ourselves, nor can we expect resi
dents of other dorms to pay for their
meals twice â€” once at their residence
through their meal plan and once at the
Russian Table.
Our situation is not unique. The
Japanese Table at Hammarskjold House
has suffered a great decline in atten
dance. With the elimination of meal

exchange cards, the first two Japanese
speakers to arrive there are given free
meals, while the rest of those attending
must go without a meal or bring their
own.
Two language students do not make a
language table. Without successfully run
language tables, Stanford students have
little opportunity to speak uninhibitedly
with natives and fellow classmates.
If Stanford has a true commitment to
academic excellence and to the academics
upon which academic theme houses are
based, then the meal exchange card pro
gram should be reinstated Winter Quar
ter.
Only then will friends and language
enthusiasts rightfully be able to dine and
to converse together once again.
