# Daily coverage of Palestine is unfair
## 
### 
A front page headline in Tuesday's
Daily read: "Media watchdog: Mideast
news is biased." Page 3 of that same
paper provided convincing evidence.
A news photo on that page captioned
"Mass arrest" showed rows of Pales
tinian men kneeling in the sun with
their heads bowed and their hands tied
behind their backs.
The rest of the caption explains only
that the men were arrested "following
rock throwing and rioting at the Wailing
Wall, which killed at least 22 people and
injured 150."
The facts are that the dead and
were Palestinians, and it was not
"rioting" that killed or wounded them
but the Israeli police, who used bullets,
tear gas and helicopters against civilians
armed only with stones.
It is true that the Palestinians had

thrown stones, slightly injuring six
Israelis, but even this much provocation
did not warrant in return what one hos
pital administrator called "a massacre,"
and what prompted U.N. Secretary Gen
eral Javier Perez de Cuellar to express
shock at Israel's "use of excessive force."
What The Daily did not report is that
the Palestinians had gathered at the
Dome of the Rock, Islam's third holiest
shrine, to defend it from a militant Jew
ish group that has attempted eveiy year
at this time to lay the cornerstone of a
new Jewish temple at the site. In recent
days the extremists had distributed
leaflets vowing that they would try
again.
With an Israeli prime minister who
refers to them as "alien invaders in the
land of Israel," the Palestinians had no
reason to believe Israeli authorities
would protect their shrine from desecra
tion, so they armed themselves with
stones.
The New York Times reported that
witnesses disagree as to who started the

violence, but there is no question as to
whose blood was shed.
The episode at the Dome of the Rock
was only the most recent tragedy to
befall the Palestinians forced to live
under Israeli occupation. The present
Israeli government has vowed never to
give up an inch of territory and refuses
to negotiate a just peace with the Pales
tinians.
Our own government continues to
subsidize Israel's intransigence. The
least The Daily could do is give the vic
tims of these policies fair news coverage
