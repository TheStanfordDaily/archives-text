## Boston Red Sox never had a shot 
### 
Ybu knew it was coming.
It's October and the
Boston Red Sox have
been contending for the Ameri
can League pennant. They had
to lose.
Not to take anything away
from the Oakland Athletics,
who are clearly the best team
in baseball. But the Red Sox
were destined to lose. They
could have been playing the
Seattle Mariners for the cham
pionship and would have lost.
They have a rich history of los
ing. Baseball without monu
mental chokes by the Red Sox
is, well, unAmerican.

You can trace this year's
team's misfortunes back to
that fateful day in October of
1986, when Boston first base
man Bill Buckner allowed a
simple squibber up the first
base line to roll underneath his
glove. That error, in the bottom
of the 11th inning after the Red
Sox had taken a 5-3 lead in the
top half of the inning, cost the
Sox a 3-games-to-2 edge over
the New York Mets and most
likely the series. Was there ever
any doubt that the Mets would
lose as Ray Knight crossed
home plate to win the game?
The Red Sox tried again in
'88, when they were swept in
the ALCS by — guess who? —
the Oakland A's. In fact,
Boston has lost 10 straight
postseason games.
Then there was 1978, when
the Red Sox choked on a late
season 13 1/2-game lead in the
AL East and finished the sea
son tied with the New York
Yankees. The teams played a
one-game playoff at Fenway
Park for the division title the
day after the regular season
ended. That day, fate reared its
head in the unlikely visage of
the light-hitting Bucky Dent,
who smacked a late-inning
homer over the Green Monster
to propell the Yankees to the
division title, pennant and sec
ond consecutive world champi
onship.
Three seasons before, the
Sox played the Cincinnati Reds
in what many believe was the
best World Series ever. This
was the series in which Carlton
Fiskhit a 12th-inning towering
homer to win a do-or-die game
six for the Red Sox. The Boston
fans believed that maybe, just
maybe, this was the year. But it
wasn't, and naturally the Big
Red Machine won game seven.
Actually, it hasn't been the
Red Sox's year for some 70-odd
seasons now. The only baseball
teams with longer champi
onship droughts are the
Chicago White Sox and my
beloved Chicago Cubs.
It's been so long, in fact,
that the Boston fans have for
mulated a theory as to why the
baseball gods have cursed their
beloved Sox to season after sea
son of near misses. Boston
writer Dan Shaughnessy has
written a book, titled "The
Curse of the Bambino," in
which he argues that the spirit
of Babe Ruth is haunting the
Red Sox as revenge for the Sox
selling Ruth's contract to the
Yankees in 1920.
That trade was a crime of
hubris. The Red Sox felt they
were good enough to win with
out a legend like the Bambino.
And the baseball gods on
Mount Olympus had to punish
the proud mortals.
I'm not making this up.
That's how bad it is if you're a
Red Sox fan.
With such a miserable
legacy, and with the not-so

svelte specter of Babe Ruth
manipulating the team's des
tiny, it was only a question of
how the Red Sox would lose
this year's American League
Championship Series.
I eagerly anticipated what
form the gods' curse would
take this season.
In reality, this year's ALCS
wasn't even close. Oakland
won, Oakland was going to win,
and there was nothing that
anybody, in Boston or else
where, could do about it.
However, that did not keep
the baseball gods from tossing
in a few reminders to the Red
Sox and their fans about the
inevitability of their fate.
First of all, Boston manager
Joe Morgan mysteriously
metamorphosized from a base
ball genius who won the AL
East with little talent and no
depth in his rotation to an idiot
who couldn't even make rou
tine decisions during the series.
One baseball maxim is
"never run yourself out of an
inning." That's Morgan's
golden rule. He never puts on
the steal and only rarely puts
on the hit-and-run. But in
game three, with the Boston
bats hitting a paltry .198 and
an unforgivable 0-for-17 with
runners in scoring position,
Morgan had to start trying to
generate some offense. He had
to try and get his team going.
So inexplicably, he put Ellis
Burks, the team's fastest
player, in the cleanup spot.
Morgan refuses to run. Whitey
Herzog, erstwhile of the St.
Louis Cardinals and one of
baseball's brightest minds,
made a career of generating
runs. Morgan may lose his job
for refusing to even try.
Then, with one out in the
eighth inning of game three,
the A's up 4-1 and Dave Hen
derson on first, Morgan
allowed starter Mike Boddicker
to pitch to Terry Steinbach
without holding Henderson on
first. While Boddicker refused
to deliver from the stretch, the
aged-wonder and slow-footed
Henderson stole second base
standing up. Allowing a poten
tial back-breaking run into
scoring position in a late inning
of a do-or-die game doesn't
seem like good baseball sense
to me.
But Morgan's inexplicable
managing is only a small taste
of the bitter happenings in this
series. The strangest event
occured in the bizarre second
inning of yesterday's game.
With two outs, Mark McG
wire on first and one run
already in, Sox pitcher Roger
Clemens walked the A's Willie
Randolph on five pitches.
Clemens was clearly unhappy
about the strike zone of home
plate umpire Terry Cooney and
started cursing him from the
mound. As Mike Gallego
stepped into the batter's box
and Clemens continued to spit
out insults, Cooney decided he
had taken enough and tossed
the disbelieving Boston pitcher.
It was the earliest ejection in
playoff history. Why Cooney
would eject Clemens, without
warning him first, in the early
innings of the critical fourth
game of the championship
series is baffling. It was so
weird that hall of fame catcher
Johnny Bench, doing the color
commentary for CBS network
radio, said that "I'm shocked. I
really am shocked.... This is
the first time I've ever seen a
starting pitcher thrown out."
Johnny Bench has been
watching pitchers for close to
40 years.
But if the Red Sox are play
ing in October, nothing is unbe
lievable.

will fail to win the World
Series.
