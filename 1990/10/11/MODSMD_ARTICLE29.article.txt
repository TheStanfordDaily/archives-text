# Vardell wins league honor
## 
### 
After scoring four touchdowns
in leading Stanford to a 36-31 win
over No. 1 Notre Dame last week,
Stanford fullback Tommy Vardell
was named the Pacific 10
Conference Offensive Player of
the Week.
Vardell, a junior from El
Calif., scored on four seperate one
yard runs to hand the Fighting
Irish their first home loss since
1986. Vardell also recovered a
fumbled punt on the Irish nine

yard line to set up Stanford's
other touchdown.
The four touchdowns in one
game was one short of Darrin
Nelson's school record of five.
Vardell now has 11 touchdowns
on the year and he ranks third in
the nation in scoring at 13.2
points per game.
Stanford will meet another
team in the top 25 this weekend
when USC travels to Stanford
Stadium.
