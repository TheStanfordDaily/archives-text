# New residence plans suffer minor setback

The University's goal of four
years of guaranteed undergradu
ate housing hit a minor snag
Tuesday as the Board of Trustees
deferred approval of plans for
building two new student resi
dences on the site of Manzanita
Park.
However, "that doesn't mean
[the planl was rejected," accord
ing to Bob Hamrdla, assistant to
the president and secretary to the
Trustees. "Don't read more into
this than there is," he said.
The University still plans to
replace about half of the Man
zanita trailers by fall quarter,
1992 with two buildings housing
200 residents. The project has
been given the working title
"Manzanita Two."
But the trustees raised some
concerns over the design and
physical placement of the new res
idences within the site, acting
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson said.
The Trustees "are concerned

about the location of the buildings
and how well they will facilitate
the program ... and sense of resi
dential community . . . we're try
ing to develop," Robinson said.
Acting director of Residential
Education Robin Hensley
explained the concerns involve
how the two new residences are
arranged in relation to each other
and to Kimball Hall, the new dor
mitory currently under construc
tion
The location of the central cafe
teria facility, which will be shared
by all three buildings, is also a
matter of concern, Hensley said.
The Trustees want to ensure
that the "whole complex will be
brought together as a commu
nity," Hensley noted.
Each of the new Manzanita
Two residences will provide a
lounge, dining facilities and hous
ing for 100 students. Food will be
prepared in the central facility but
each house will eat in its own din
ing room.
