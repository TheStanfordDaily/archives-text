# Stanford comeback beats Davis 2-1
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford's ninth-ranked wo
men's soccer team started in a
slumber yesterday and awoke just
in time to avert a nightmarish
upset at the hands of Division II
UC-Davis.
Stanford trailed 1-0 in the first
half to the aggressive Aggies be
fore rising for a 2-1 road victory.
The brow-wiping win keeps Stan
ford's hopes alive for the playoffs
and gets the Cardinal safely to
Sunday's Maloney Field show
down with Colorado College.
"For the first 10 minutes, it
looked like they were the number
nine or 10 team in the nation, and
not us," said junior fullback Kerry
Stivaletti. "Even though we are in
the top 10, we weren't playing
with that kind of confidence."
"We came out really slow,"
echoed junior sweeper Heather
Mclntyre. "It was a bad feeling.
We were really flat, and some peo
ple were off."
Stanford lacked its usual quick
ness and execution in the opening
15 minutes and surrendered an
easy goal to the Aggies. After a
steal at midfield, the Aggies pene
trated the penalty box and scored
on a wide-open 18-yard straight
away shot.
But Stanford rebounded 20
minutes later when junior for
ward Elizabeth Joneschild scored
her fourth goal in the last three
games off a corner kick from se
nior Jennifer "Rocket" Rowland.
Joneschild's flare trickled off an
opponent and found its way across
the goal line, knotting the score at
1-1.
In the second half, Stanford
turned up the heat and had many
more opportunities to score. Julie
Foudy pounded in her team-lead
ing 10th goal of the season 20
minutes into the period after a
mis-hit shot by senior Denise Den
ney. Denney recovered a loose ball
following a corner kick and man
aged to get the ball to Foudy. With
one touch, Stanford's phenomenal
sophomore blazed the ball into the
back of the net.
Stanford coach Berhane Ande
berhan would like to see his club
play with confidence, composure
and a little more consistency. Ide
ally, Stanford — playing with the
same intensity it displayed
against No. 1 Santa Clara —
would stomp on less talented op
ponents like UC-Davis.
But, all idealisms considered,
Stanford must be happy to return
to Maloney Field with its 11-2
record and national standing in
tact.

"It's a victory, and we came
from behind so we'll take it," said
Stivaletti. "It wasn't a pretty
game."
The Division II Aggies are
ranked No. 2 in the region and are
no patsy as they illustrated Tues
day, losing just 1-0 to No. 14 St.
Mary's. Stanford beat the Gaels 2-
1 in a tough match earlier this
season.
"They were tough," said Sti
valetti. "They were winning a lot
of 50-50 balls, and they were not
intimidated."
But Stanford will have to play
much better down the home
stretch if it hopes to cross the fin
ish line at the top of the pack. Be
ginning with Colorado College on
Sunday, Stanford will be playing
four teams, ranked directly ahead
of it. The Cardinal hosts William
and Mary Monday before a tough

two-game trip to Duke and North
Carolina State.
"We'll get hammered if we keep
playing the same way," said team
captain Mclntyre. "These are big
teams and we basically get up for
the big games. If we lost today,
that would have been it. It would
have been all over."
Stanford may have been tired
from the two-game Stanford Invi
tational played over the weekend,
but the Aggies had battled St.
Mary's only the day before and
have their own big game to look
forward to. They play No. 1 (in Di
vision II) Sonoma State Saturday.
"We wanted to play a lot bet
ter," said Stivaletti. "Maybe it was
the bus ride or the two games that
affected us, but we need to put it
together."
Andeberhan let the team have
the day off from practice today in

preparation for the upcoming
games that will decide Stanford's
playoff fate.
"We are just glad to come home
with the win," said Rowland.
"The next four are the big ones."
Card notes
Rowland faced little sister Jill in a
high-orbit space battle while Stanford
and UC-Davis were playing. Jill, a
freshman forward for Davis, is Rock
et's little sister and a smaller stage of
Stanford's explosive scorer. Both Row
lands tallied assists.
"It was a lot of fun — she played re
ally well," said Stanford's Rowland.
Junior fullback Michele Sullivan
missed the game because of a bulging
disk in her back. She expects to return
to full service for Sunday's game.
Freshman fullback Glynnis
Roberts felt a little under the weath
er and missed part of the second half.
