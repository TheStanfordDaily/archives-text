# Men's soccer rolls over San Jose State
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
In a season that has seen the Cardinal post
a .500 record through its first 13 games, regis
ter five ties, extend an astounding eight games
into overtime, and that virtually guaranteed a
close game, it is refreshing to see a laugher.
Especially when Stanford's doing the
laughing.
The 5-4-5 Cardinal used four first-half

goals, including Jim Talluto's team-leading
seventh of the season, to coast to a 4-0 victory
over San Jose State that was perhaps even
more lopsided than the score indicates.
Stanford goalkeeper Kyle Krpata was
almost completely unchallenged throughout
the game. Except for a few plays at the begin
ning of the second half, after the game was
already well out of reach, Krpata had little to
do except watch the offense work its magic.
"I think we played well," Talluto said.

"They are a team with a good tactical concept,
but pretty low on technique, so it's easier to
exploit their mistakes."
Stanford opened the scoring when Randy
Mann put the ball into the net from 20 yards
out for his first goal of the year. The Spartan
goalkeeper, who played a decent game but was
simply overpowered by the Cardinal attack,
had no chance at a save as the ball was kicked
right in the corner of the net, a spot that is vir
tually impossible for the goalie to defend.
Smiles all around.
Talluto then came in and scored from three
yards out to make the score 2-0. Cardinal fans
were starting to smirk. Bill Bollengier later
scored off a throw-in as his header found its
way past the San Jose State keeper. A chuckle
or two emerged from the Cardinal bench. A
romp was clearly in the works. Shortly after,
Rhett Harty scored off a penalty kick to give
the Cardinal the four-goal lead that they
maintained for the duration.
That was it. Laugher officially in progress.
The Stanford booters were all smiles as
they walked off the field, but coach Colin Lin
dores, who after witnessing some of the unbe
lievable finishes of Cardinal games this year
will probably never feel comfortable with any
lead, refrained from joining in the merriment
and reminded them that they still had a half to
play.
It was during the opening moments of the
second half that the Spartans had their only
serious scoring opportunities. Krpata had to
make a diving save to preserve the shutout,
but after that, it was smooth sailing.
"Even though we didn't score in the second
half, we still played better than we usually do
with a lead," Talluto said. "We were composed,
more controlled, but we weren't sitting back
and relaxing. We didn't just try to hold the
lead, we kept at our game plan and had a few
more scoring opportunities."
Most of the games we've played this year
have been close," Talluto went on. "Usually,
we get up to play the good teams, but play
down to the level of the mediocre ones. Today,
we really came to play."
In addition to adding to his impressive goal
totals, Talluto, who is one yellow card shy of
receiving a suspension from the league, real
ized a goal that he had set when he got his last
yellow card on Sept. 16.
"I wanted to make it until we played Port
land before I got my fifth," he said. Talluto, a
native of Oregon, will get the chance to play
them this weekend, when Stanford squares off
against Portland this Saturday.
Hopefully, Stanford will be able to put on a
happy face once again.

the Cardinal the four-goal lead that they
maintained for the duration.
That was it. Laugher officially in progress.
The Stanford booters were all smiles as
they walked off the field, but coach Colin Lin
dores, who after witnessing some of the unbe
lievable finishes of Cardinal games this year
will probably never feel comfortable with any
lead, refrained from joining in the merriment
and reminded them that they still had a half to
play.
It was during the opening moments of the
second half that the Spartans had their only
serious scoring opportunities. Krpata had to
make a diving save to preserve the shutout,
but after that, it was smooth sailing.
"Even though we didn't score in the second
half, we still played better than we usually do
with a lead," Talluto said. "We were composed,
more controlled, but we weren't sitting back
and relaxing. We didn't just try to hold the
lead, we kept at our game plan and had a few
more scoring opportunities."
Most of the games we've played this year
have been close," Talluto went on. "Usually,
we get up to play the good teams, but play
down to the level of the mediocre ones. Today,
we really came to play."
In addition to adding to his impressive goal
totals, Talluto, who is one yellow card shy of
receiving a suspension from the league, real
ized a goal that he had set when he got his last
yellow card on Sept. 16.
"I wanted to make it until we played Port
land before I got my fifth," he said. Talluto, a
native of Oregon, will get the chance to play
them this weekend, when Stanford squares off
against Portland this Saturday.
Hopefully, Stanford will be able to put on a
happy face once again.
