# Prep hoops standout is coming to Farm
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Even though practice can
not officially start until Mon
day, men'B basketball coach
Mike Montgomery is already at
work. A summer of recruiting
has paid off already as David
Harbour announced his inten
tions to enroll at Stanford in
the fall of 1991.
Harbour, a 6-foot-2 guard
from Camarillo, Calif., said he
made his decision earlier this
week. He plans on signing a
letter of intent during the fall
signing period, which begins
next month.
"Stanford (is) a school I've
always wanted to go to," Har
bour said. "When I made my
trip the 28th through the 30th
(of September) I got along real
well with the players. I just
think I fit in real well there...
. I'm ready."
Harbour averaged 26.8
points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.4
assists per game for Camarillo
High School last year. His team
posted a 16-9 record last sea
son after being 19-6 and ad
vancing to the CIF Southern
Section quarterfinals his
sophomore year.
Harbour was a first-team
All-CIF 4A selection last year
after being a second-teamer as
a sophomore. He was named
all-state in division II by Cal-
Hi Sports and was listed as one
of California's top 15 juniors
last year.
In an interesting aside, Har
bour's father, John Harbour,
played basketball at Arizona
from 1967 to 1969. In the pre
season coaches' poll, Arizona
was picked as the preseason fa
vorite to win the Pacific 10
Conference this winter, fol

lowed by UCLA and Stanford.
Harbour visited Fresno
State andthe University of San
Diego before deciding on Stan
ford. He cancelled upcoming
visits to UC-Santa Barbara
and Pepperdine.
"I always thought that
would be the best school to go
to but I wanted to look
around," he said. "I love it. I'm
really looking forward to going
to Stanford. They all set goals
and want to reach them."
The Cardinal returns 14
players and all five starters
from the team that went 18-12
and played in the National In
vitation Tournament last sea
son. Stanford qualified for the
NCAA tournament for the first
time in 47 years in 1989 but
the team has the talent to re
turn there again this season.
"I really like [Montgom
ery's] system," Harbour said.
"It has a lot to do with a shoot
er and a post game. I think I'll
fit in well there.... With the
big guys I think it takes a lot of
pressure off the shooters."
Harbour describes himself
as a shooter with good knowl
edge of the game. "I like to play
a quick game but I've played a
lot of set offense too," he said.
"I'm the type of player who
works hard. I'd say the best
thing going for me is that I do
most things well but I don't do
anything great. I may not beat
you with quickness — not to
say that I'm slow, but I'm not
really quick — but I think my
knowledge of the game is an
advantage."
Harbour said is isn't sure
what he would like to major in
here on the Farm but he is
leaning toward industrial engi
neering with plans to go into
business.
