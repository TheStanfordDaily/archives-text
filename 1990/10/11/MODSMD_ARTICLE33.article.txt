# Card opens tourney
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
According to the St. Mary's vol
leyball media guide, the team's
required reading this year is
"Great Expectations." Stanford
believes that Dicken's "Hard
Times" will be a more appropriate
text for St. Mary's tonight.
Tonight the Cardinal (11-2, 8-1
in Pacific 10 Conference play)
looks to squash St. Mary's, high
hopes and all, in the first round of
the Stanford Invititational to be
held at Maples Pavilion. The two
day, four-team tournament will
feature No. 2 Nebraska and No.
14 Brigham Young in the second
match of the night at 8 p.m. Stan
ford will contend with the Gaels at
6 p.m.
The victors will meet in the
championship match tomorrow at
8 p.m. The consolation match will
be played at 6 p.m. Friday.
While Stanford is itching to
meet the second-ranked Corn
huskers, their immediate focus is
on St. Mary's.
"We need to be ready to play
tonight," Stanford coach Don
Shaw said. "There will be no
Nebraska if we don't beat St.
Mary's."
Considering the authority
Stanford has commanded in its
recent matches, that task does not
seem to be too burdensome. The
Cardinal is currently on a five
match winning streak. The team
has swept its last three opponents
and has surrendered only two
games since Sept. 25. Against Cal
ifornia, Stanford hit .409 as a
team and had five players hit over
.300 on the night.
Devising a defensive scheme
will not be an easy task for St.
Mary's coach Jim Cherniss as
Stanford continues to start the
most potent attack in the country.

Against California, junior Amy
Cooper set the all-time collegiate
record for best hitting percentage
in a match with a minimum of 10
attacks. The Aurora, 111., middle
blocker had 13 kills in 13 attacks.
Sophomore Bev Oden leads the
team in hitting percentage (.341),
kills (208), and blocks (72). She
remains an early favorite for
NCAA Player-of the-Year honors.
Junior co-captain Kristin Klein is
hitting .311 on the year and has
198 kills. She is the team leader in
digs with 169. Cherniss must also
be wary of middle blocker Nikki
Appleman who hit .667 against
Washington last weekend.
Despite the daunting nature of
the affair, the Gaels aren't quite
ready to roll over yet. St. Mary's
has compiled a 10-6 record and is
making great strides toward its
second consecutive winning sea
son. The team is reliant upon 6-
foot-3 outside hitter Kirsten
George. George is hitting .288 on
the year and has 173 kills. Setter
Tracie Heydukovich has made a
big name for herself with an 86-
assist performance against Michi
gan. The total is the highest in the
nation thus far.
"I know their coach well,"
Shaw said. "He's a good coach,
and his players all like to play for
him. He'll have them loose and
ready to play. They've improved
quite a bit."
Whether they have improved
enough is another question
entirely. Stanford remains one of
the nation's elite and is looking
ahead to a potential match with
Nebraska. Barring any upsets, the
Cardinal will have yet another
shot at top-flight competition Fri
day. Nebraska is the only squad
that has defeated No. 1 UCLA.
"I want to beat them badly,"
Cooper said. "They're really good,
but I'm not intimidated by them."

that has defeated No. 1 UCLA.
"I want to beat them badly,"
Cooper said. "They're really good,
but I'm not intimidated by them."

Sophomore Bev Oden records one of her many stuff blocks In lead
ing Stanford to victory last weekend. The Cardinal takes a five-match
winning streak into the Stanford Invitational tonight and tomorrow in
Maples Pavilion.
According to the St. Mary's vol
leyball media guide, the team's
required reading this year is
"Great Expectations." Stanford
believes that Dicken's "Hard
Times" will be a more appropriate
text for St. Mary's tonight.
Tonight the Cardinal (11-2, 8-1
in Pacific 10 Conference play)
looks to squash St. Mary's, high
hopes and all, in the first round of
the Stanford Invititational to be
held at Maples Pavilion. The two
day, four-team tournament will
feature No. 2 Nebraska and No.
14 Brigham Young in the second
match of the night at 8 p.m. Stan
ford will contend with the Gaels at
6 p.m.
The victors will meet in the
championship match tomorrow at
8 p.m. The consolation match will
be played at 6 p.m. Friday.
While Stanford is itching to
meet the second-ranked Corn
huskers, their immediate focus is
on St. Mary's.
"We need to be ready to play
tonight," Stanford coach Don
Shaw said. "There will be no
Nebraska if we don't beat St.
Mary's."
Considering the authority
Stanford has commanded in its
recent matches, that task does not
seem to be too burdensome. The
Cardinal is currently on a five
match winning streak. The team
has swept its last three opponents
and has surrendered only two
games since Sept. 25. Against Cal
ifornia, Stanford hit .409 as a
team and had five players hit over
.300 on the night.
Devising a defensive scheme
will not be an easy task for St.
Mary's coach Jim Cherniss as
Stanford continues to start the
most potent attack in the country.

Against California, junior Amy
Cooper set the all-time collegiate
record for best hitting percentage
in a match with a minimum of 10
attacks. The Aurora, 111., middle
blocker had 13 kills in 13 attacks.
Sophomore Bev Oden leads the
team in hitting percentage (.341),
kills (208), and blocks (72). She
remains an early favorite for
NCAA Player-of the-Year honors.
Junior co-captain Kristin Klein is
hitting .311 on the year and has
198 kills. She is the team leader in
digs with 169. Cherniss must also
be wary of middle blocker Nikki
Appleman who hit .667 against
Washington last weekend.
Despite the daunting nature of
the affair, the Gaels aren't quite
ready to roll over yet. St. Mary's
has compiled a 10-6 record and is
making great strides toward its
second consecutive winning sea
son. The team is reliant upon 6-
foot-3 outside hitter Kirsten
George. George is hitting .288 on
the year and has 173 kills. Setter
Tracie Heydukovich has made a
big name for herself with an 86-
assist performance against Michi
gan. The total is the highest in the
nation thus far.
"I know their coach well,"
Shaw said. "He's a good coach,
and his players all like to play for
him. He'll have them loose and
ready to play. They've improved
quite a bit."
Whether they have improved
enough is another question
entirely. Stanford remains one of
the nation's elite and is looking
ahead to a potential match with
Nebraska. Barring any upsets, the
Cardinal will have yet another
shot at top-flight competition Fri
day. Nebraska is the only squad
that has defeated No. 1 UCLA.
"I want to beat them badly,"
Cooper said. "They're really good,
but I'm not intimidated by them."
