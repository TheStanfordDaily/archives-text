## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY MICHAEL HEDGES One man, many sounds, one guitar at a time 
### Todd Santos 
Many people enjoy listening to the acoustic
guitar. Most of us have grown up with a
whole history of acoustic folk and rock
tunes. We hear the instrument in the
dorm, at the beach, on camping trips
and in coffee houses.
But none of this can really pre
pare you for what you will see
and hear when you walk into a
Michael Hedges show.
What you see is one
man holding one acoustic
guitar. What you hear is
something like two or three
of each, at times making
y thundering sounds you can't
r really believe.
What usually happens next is
that those audience members
, who are new to this phenomenon
112 stare, wide-eyed, at the people sit
ting around them and try to get some
kind of comfort, some reality check,
some nod of approval for their sur
prise.
over, these people walk out of
the auditorium very
exhilarated and a
\ little dazed,

SEHSsr,

fin
ished up his
formal school
ing by being
accepted to the
Peabody Conservatory
in Baltimore, where he
studied classical guitar and
' ' ;i
received a degree in compo-,
sition. He also took part in
an electronic music seminar
at Stanford in 1980.
When asked what led to his
unique style and his current
:> stage of development, he cites the
"blend of disciplines" afforded by
M his varied academic experiences
M with an array of instruments and
m genres, especially classical. He also
m cites a further "intuitional discipline"
r that came from the informal learning
listening to the Beatles, and later Joni
Mitchell, Pete Townsend and others.
What he does â€” and doesn't do
All of these experiences make Hedges a very
hard performer to quantify. Those who arc
quick to call him a "New Age"
artist are quickly enlightened
when they see him walk out
on stage and blow the audi- +
ence away with a thrashing
version of a Rolling Stones
tune or something by The
Who.
Then, when he's finished,
he stares out at the crowd
