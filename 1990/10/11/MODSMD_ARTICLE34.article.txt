# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY MICHAEL HEDGES One man, many sounds, one guitar at a time 
### Todd Santos 
Many people enjoy listening to the acoustic
guitar. Most of us have grown up with a
whole history of acoustic folk and rock
tunes. We hear the instrument in the
dorm, at the beach, on camping trips
and in coffee houses.
But none of this can really pre
pare you for what you will see
and hear when you walk into a
Michael Hedges show.
What you see is one
man holding one acoustic
guitar. What you hear is
something like two or three
of each, at times making
y thundering sounds you can't
r really believe.
What usually happens next is
that those audience members
, who are new to this phenomenon
112 stare, wide-eyed, at the people sit
ting around them and try to get some
kind of comfort, some reality check,
some nod of approval for their sur
prise.
over, these people walk out of
the auditorium very
exhilarated and a
\ little dazed,
> the com-

says that tl^
came along shortb"
afterward and hr
really started
getting into
the gui
tar.
SEHSsr,

fin
ished up his
formal school
ing by being
accepted to the
Peabody Conservatory
in Baltimore, where he
studied classical guitar and
' ' ;i
received a degree in compo-,
sition. He also took part in
an electronic music seminar
at Stanford in 1980.
When asked what led to his
unique style and his current
:> stage of development, he cites the
"blend of disciplines" afforded by
M his varied academic experiences
M with an array of instruments and
m genres, especially classical. He also
m cites a further "intuitional discipline"
r that came from the informal learning
listening to the Beatles, and later Joni
Mitchell, Pete Townsend and others.
What he does — and doesn't do
All of these experiences make Hedges a very
hard performer to quantify. Those who arc
quick to call him a "New Age"
artist are quickly enlightened
when they see him walk out
on stage and blow the audi- +
ence away with a thrashing
version of a Rolling Stones
tune or something by The
Who.
Then, when he's finished,
he stares out at the crowd



blankly, completely out of breath,
and says something like, "that was
the famous New Age hit 'Jumpin
Jack Flash' by the Rolline Stones."
Hedges doesn't mind being cat
egorized; he's flattered that people
talk about him. He simply wishes
people would come see him first
and pigeonhole him afterwards.
He's confident that "it's pretty dif
ficult to do."
Personally, Hedges likes to call
what he's been doing a progression
from initially "Thrash Acoustic"
to "Heavy Mental" to his latest
"Savage Myth Guitar" exemplified
by his new album Taproot. He
cautions, however, that these
labels are fun but not comprehen
sive, and always come after a song
is written.
Hedges believes every label has
its limiting baggage, even the body
of music coming to be called New
Age. "To me there's good New Age
and very bad.... But it's just like
anything else.... I can turn on a
country music station, and I'm
going to hear some really beauti
ful, well-written songs and some
really sappy awful stuff. One type
of music is no better than any
other."
What's next for Hedges
Hedges latest walk on the musi
cal edge is the use of "The Electric
Harp Guitar with Whammy Bar,"
also called the TransTrem guitar.
A bizarre instrument not unlike
the acoustic harp guitar Hedges

has used in the past (which is like
a regular acoustic with a tangential
set of five extra bass strings on the
side), his "Whammv Harp" has a
whammy bar, like tne ones heavy
metal rockers use to distort the
sound of the strings.
But on Hedges' new guitar, one
can do this while staying in tune,
transposing up or down.
After the Taproot promotion
tour, Hedges said he plans to pro
duce two or three new artists on
his own label which will be called
"Taproot Records." He quips that
it will be one of those obscure
"underground" labels, referring to
the "root" in the name, and
records will be available only be
mail.
Among the new material will be
a solo piano record by his first
music theory professor and good
friend, EJ. Ulrich. The Ulrich
piece will be a Christmas record of
very modern, groundbreaking
piano approaches to carols Like
"Silent Night" and "We Three
Kings."
Hedges warns it will not be sim
ply background music to holiday
activity around the house, but will
be something to sit down and con
centrate on, to take in and think
about.
For himself, Hedges says he
seems to be going in a "Strong
Beat" direction, but more toward
rock. But he doesn't like to be to
sure about the future because, he
says, "then I'd get really bored."

man holding one acoustic
guitar. What you hear is
something like two or three
of each, at times making
y thundering sounds you can't
r really believe.
What usually happens next is
that those audience members
, who are new to this phenomenon
112 stare, wide-eyed, at the people sit
ting around them and try to get some
kind of comfort, some reality check,
some nod of approval for their sur
prise.
over, these people walk out of
the auditorium very
exhilarated and a
\ little dazed,
> the com-

says that tl^
came along shortb"
afterward and hr
really started
getting into
the gui
tar.
SEHSsr,

fin
ished up his
formal school
ing by being
accepted to the
Peabody Conservatory
in Baltimore, where he
studied classical guitar and
' ' ;i
received a degree in compo-,
sition. He also took part in
an electronic music seminar
at Stanford in 1980.
When asked what led to his
unique style and his current
:> stage of development, he cites the
"blend of disciplines" afforded by
M his varied academic experiences
M with an array of instruments and
m genres, especially classical. He also
m cites a further "intuitional discipline"
r that came from the informal learning
listening to the Beatles, and later Joni
Mitchell, Pete Townsend and others.
What he does — and doesn't do
All of these experiences make Hedges a very
hard performer to quantify. Those who arc
quick to call him a "New Age"
artist are quickly enlightened
when they see him walk out
on stage and blow the audi- +
ence away with a thrashing
version of a Rolling Stones
tune or something by The
Who.
Then, when he's finished,
he stares out at the crowd



blankly, completely out of breath,
and says something like, "that was
the famous New Age hit 'Jumpin
Jack Flash' by the Rolline Stones."
Hedges doesn't mind being cat
egorized; he's flattered that people
talk about him. He simply wishes
people would come see him first
and pigeonhole him afterwards.
He's confident that "it's pretty dif
ficult to do."
Personally, Hedges likes to call
what he's been doing a progression
from initially "Thrash Acoustic"
to "Heavy Mental" to his latest
"Savage Myth Guitar" exemplified
by his new album Taproot. He
cautions, however, that these
labels are fun but not comprehen
sive, and always come after a song
is written.
Hedges believes every label has
its limiting baggage, even the body
of music coming to be called New
Age. "To me there's good New Age
and very bad.... But it's just like
anything else.... I can turn on a
country music station, and I'm
going to hear some really beauti
ful, well-written songs and some
really sappy awful stuff. One type
of music is no better than any
other."
What's next for Hedges
Hedges latest walk on the musi
cal edge is the use of "The Electric
Harp Guitar with Whammy Bar,"
also called the TransTrem guitar.
A bizarre instrument not unlike
the acoustic harp guitar Hedges

has used in the past (which is like
a regular acoustic with a tangential
set of five extra bass strings on the
side), his "Whammv Harp" has a
whammy bar, like tne ones heavy
metal rockers use to distort the
sound of the strings.
But on Hedges' new guitar, one
can do this while staying in tune,
transposing up or down.
After the Taproot promotion
tour, Hedges said he plans to pro
duce two or three new artists on
his own label which will be called
"Taproot Records." He quips that
it will be one of those obscure
"underground" labels, referring to
the "root" in the name, and
records will be available only be
mail.
Among the new material will be
a solo piano record by his first
music theory professor and good
friend, EJ. Ulrich. The Ulrich
piece will be a Christmas record of
very modern, groundbreaking
piano approaches to carols Like
"Silent Night" and "We Three
Kings."
Hedges warns it will not be sim
ply background music to holiday
activity around the house, but will
be something to sit down and con
centrate on, to take in and think
about.
For himself, Hedges says he
seems to be going in a "Strong
Beat" direction, but more toward
rock. But he doesn't like to be to
sure about the future because, he
says, "then I'd get really bored."

Tickets for the Concert Network
sponsored show are available at
the Tresidder Ticket Office. Stu
dent tickets cost $12.50.
Many people enjoy listening to the acoustic
guitar. Most of us have grown up with a
whole history of acoustic folk and rock
tunes. We hear the instrument in the
dorm, at the beach, on camping trips
and in coffee houses.
But none of this can really pre
pare you for what you will see
and hear when you walk into a
Michael Hedges show.
