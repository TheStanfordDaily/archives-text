Are you tired
of mainstream
L Mel Gibson flicks,
formula plots and
movies where you
-1

can guess the
hero's next quip? Are you ready
to get off campus for a few
hours? Do you consider San
Jose the nation's center for cut
ting-edge art? Then here's your
chance.
Cinequest, a film festival cel
ebrating independent, cutting
edge filmmakers, makes its
debut at the Camera 3 theaters
in San lose this weekend.
The vision of the festival is to
aid independent filmmakers in
the areas of exhibition and dis
tribution, the toughest obstacles

to artists just starting out,
according to executive director
Halfdan Hussie.
"We want to do something
concrete for these filmmakers,"
said Hussie, who created the
festival with the help of Kath
leen Powell, Michelle Vendelin,
vice president of promotions,
and Dave Vendelin, the chief
adviser.
For this reason, the non
profit venture will donate half of
its revenues to American inde
pendent filmmakers for the pur
pose of making exhibition and
distribution easier.
"Our philosophy is to create a
festival around the theme of
'maverick filmmakers' and indi
vidual expression," Hussie said.
"All of these filmmakers have

some type of edge.. .. they are
very individualistic, and their
films split audiences. Many of
them are not known yet, but the
world will catch up with them."
The festival opens Thursday
night at 7 p.m. with a "Gala Film
Feast" featuring a showing of
Henry Jaglom's "Eating," followed
by a party at Scott's Seafood in San
Jose (tickets are $35).
Friday's film feast features Jon
Amiel's "Time in Tbmorrow," fea
turing Peter Falk and Barbara Her
shey, followed by a reception and
comedy show at the Last Laugh
($2O).

For Sunday's "Art Film Feast,"
Jon Jost's "All the Vermeers in
New York," a film about a Wall
Street broker and a French actress
who find solace in the Vermeers in
New York, and Bernar Heber's
"Lalala Human Sex Duo" will be
followed by a party at Gordon Bier
sch in San Jose ($25).
While these film feasts are open
to the public, those on a budget
may prefer to attend the regular
showings, for which student tick
ets are only $3.50 ($6 for non-stu
dents).

Tickets for all showings are avail
able through BASS ticket offices.
The Camera 3 theaters are
located at San Carlos and Second
Streets in San Jose. For ticket
information, call 762-2277.
