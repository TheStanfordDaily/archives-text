# Lively Arts weekend hosts international lineup
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Canadian Brass
Sat., 8 p.m., Mem Aud
Tickets $19 to $25, students $3
off
Some of entertainment' 9 top
brass is coming to Stanford this
weekend. But then again, "top
brass" may be a misnomer for a
group that plays on gold instru
ments.

Canadian Brass,
known world-wide for
its brilliance, will take
the stage this weekend
with their gilded horns.
And even though
the instruments are
only plated, the group's
repertoire is as timeless
as the solid treasure.
Playing everything
from Bach to Dixie
land, Canadian Brass
has performed on the
Tbnight Show and
Sesame Street, and in
Carnegie Hall and the
People's Republic of
China.
More important
than the group's pedi
gree, however, is its
act, which includes
commentary and

humor.
Africa Oy*
Sun. 2:30, Mem Aud
Tickets $16 to $22, students $3
off
You can come back for another
dose of happiness when the curtain
rises on Africa Oy6, a 47-member
Pan-African dance troupe. Making
its first national toui; the tradition
ally-costumed troupe celebrates

African history with traditional
music, song, dance and mimicry.
Representing eight tribes, some
of the evening's more spectacular
acts include the influential Percus
sionists of Guinea and the Peul
Acrobats, also from Guinea.
This program has been a long

term goal for producer Mel
Howard. He described the frustra
tion of coordinating "an evening
that's musically and dramatically
balanced with people who are
totally inaccessible unless you go
thousands of kilometers by jeep
over dirt roads."
