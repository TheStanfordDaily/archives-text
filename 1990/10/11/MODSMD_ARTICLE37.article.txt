'Buddy 7 beats 'La Bamba'
After playing nearly a month at San Francisco's Golden Gate
Theatre, the American production of "Buddy. . . The Buddy Holly
Story" is in its final weekend before moving to the Shubert Theatre
in New York. The acclaimed musical that began in London and
played in Toronto on its way to the States has been called "an
unashamed, rabble-rousing fiesta" by the London Sunday Times.
Written by Alan Janes and directed by Rob Bettinson, the musical
profile stars American newcomer Paul Hipp. Performances are
Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., Saturday and Sunday at 2
p.m. Tickets range from $10 to $44 and are available by telephone
at 243-9001.

separate park admission. The park is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
