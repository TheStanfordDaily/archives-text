## 'Head' still classy without Hesseman 
### 
Head of the Class
ABC, Tuesdays, 8:30 p.m.
What happens when a hit series loses its
biggest draw? It either falls by the wayside, or it
finds another star that's just as appealing.
When Howard Hesseman left as the teacher on
ABC's "Head of the Class/' the show took the
latter course.
Replacing Dr. Fever is Scot Billy Connolly,
who plays the new teacher with a little more
witty charm than Hesseman's parental teacher
of-life character This past week's show featured
the class helping the recent New York trans
plant find a date through the personal ads.
Spicing up Billy's description — changing
poor, Scottish high school teacher to "non-mate
rialistic, British scholar/adventurer" — proved
to be a class-long activity where the women in
the class could express tneir admiration for the
handsome new teacher Once the ad is placed,
Billy sets up a date in a cafe with the "Southern
belle" who responded.
When Billy enters, he encounters Bernadette,
the Fillmore High secretary, who says she is
there waiting for her date. Not realizing the
obvious plot-twist, Billy sits at a neighboring
table to wait for his date. And time passes.
"I thought that fire drill today was extraordi
nary," Billy quips, breaking the ice. "Yup, that
was one hell of a fire drill."
Finally realizing that Bernadette is the
"Southern belle," Billy informs her that he is the
"scholar/adventurer," and they leave in embar
rassment.
Instead of playing into the traps of other sit
coms, where the two would go on for months
without admitting their attractions, the pair
immediately hit it off in a refreshing, true-to-life
style. Their conversation was natural and
unforced, rare for a sitcom "climax."
What all this has to do with the high school
classroom, I don't know. But it is a good way to
introduce and develop a new character, a part
which Connolly plays well.
