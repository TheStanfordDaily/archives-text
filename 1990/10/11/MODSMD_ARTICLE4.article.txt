# Misconduct cases skyrocket
## Judicial Affairs handled much larger caseload last year 
### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
Many more cases of student misconduct were
brought before the Judicial Affairs Office last year
compared to previous years, according to the 1989-
90 Judicial Affairs Report released yesterday.
The report also raises the possibility that some
broader changes will be made to the judicial system
as a whole.
Forty-nine Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code violations were reported last year, as opposed
to 18 in the 1988-89 academic year and 31 in 1987-
88. Last year's violations included assault, telephone
authorization code abuse, theft, plagiarism and
cheating.
While the overall number of judicial actions has
decreased from 71 in 1988-89, that figure includes
the 53 students charged with campus disruption for
th r takeover of University President Donald

Kennedy's office. There were no campus disruption
cases last year.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole expressed con
cern over the figures. "If it's a trend, it needs to be
stopped," she said.
Cole attributed the increase in Honor Code viola
tions to students' limited knowledge of the rules,
adding that instructors also sometimes fail to
remind students that collaborative work is not per
mitted.
However, "students can ensure that they know
what the rules are," she said. "The information is
there, and it's ultimately the students' responsibil
ity."
New violations, such as illegally using someone
else's telephone access code, also contributed to the
higher figures. Many students were unaware that
this form of theft can be detected by Communication
