# Misconduct cases skyrocket
## Judicial Affairs handled much larger caseload last year 
### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
Many more cases of student misconduct were
brought before the Judicial Affairs Office last year
compared to previous years, according to the 1989-
90 Judicial Affairs Report released yesterday.
The report also raises the possibility that some
broader changes will be made to the judicial system
as a whole.
Forty-nine Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code violations were reported last year, as opposed
to 18 in the 1988-89 academic year and 31 in 1987-
88. Last year's violations included assault, telephone
authorization code abuse, theft, plagiarism and
cheating.
While the overall number of judicial actions has
decreased from 71 in 1988-89, that figure includes
the 53 students charged with campus disruption for
th r takeover of University President Donald

Kennedy's office. There were no campus disruption
cases last year.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole expressed con
cern over the figures. "If it's a trend, it needs to be
stopped," she said.
Cole attributed the increase in Honor Code viola
tions to students' limited knowledge of the rules,
adding that instructors also sometimes fail to
remind students that collaborative work is not per
mitted.
However, "students can ensure that they know
what the rules are," she said. "The information is
there, and it's ultimately the students' responsibil
ity."
New violations, such as illegally using someone
else's telephone access code, also contributed to the
higher figures. Many students were unaware that
this form of theft can be detected by Communication
Services, according to the report.
Sally Mahoney, acting vice
president for student resources,
speculated that the number of
cases rose because the judicial
system has become more visible
and accessible to students. She
said last year's discussions about
the revised Fundamental Stan
dard Interpretation of Free
Expression and Discriminatory
Harassment put Judicial Affairs
in the spotlight.
"It is healthy to inquire
whether a complaint might be a
violation" in order to learn more
about the system, Mahoney said.
Cole agreed that the office's
visibility contributed to the rise in
incidents. However, she wrote in
the report that she sees "less indi
vidual energy directed towards

confronting and resolving individ
ual problems and more referrals
to external authority."
The report suggests that Judi
cial Affairs may see several
important changes this year,
including the application of the
revised Fundamental Standard
interpretation and a possible revi
sion of the Legislative and Judi
cial Charter.
Cole said she hopes the new
Fundamental Standard interpre
tation will serve to educate stu
dents. "Eveiyone in the commu
nity has the opportunity to
respond to the situation accord
ing to their role," she added.
Issues such as assault require
further definition than they did
when the judicial charter was
designed in 1968, Cole said. The
charter, which governs all aspects
of the student judicial process,
may be altered after the Sexual
Assault Task Force's recommen
dations to the University are

released this quarter.
In the future, "the locus of
activity will shift from the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
to the Committee of Fifteen as
changes in the outmoded charter
are made," she said.
The committee, consisting of
six students, six faculty and three
administrators, will be charged
with studying recommendations
and making changes to the char
ter. The committee will convene
in winter quarter.
According to Cole, "The pre
sent charter is outmoded because
there are statements of the rights
of the accused, but no parallel
statement specifying the rights of
the victim."
In the report, Cole also out
lined alternative judicial pro
cesses, including having the Stan
ford Judicial Council, which con
tains both students and faculty
members, hear all cases.

system has become more visible
and accessible to students. She
said last year's discussions about
the revised Fundamental Stan
dard Interpretation of Free
Expression and Discriminatory
Harassment put Judicial Affairs
in the spotlight.
"It is healthy to inquire
whether a complaint might be a
violation" in order to learn more
about the system, Mahoney said.
Cole agreed that the office's
visibility contributed to the rise in
incidents. However, she wrote in
the report that she sees "less indi
vidual energy directed towards

confronting and resolving individ
ual problems and more referrals
to external authority."
The report suggests that Judi
cial Affairs may see several
important changes this year,
including the application of the
revised Fundamental Standard
interpretation and a possible revi
sion of the Legislative and Judi
cial Charter.
Cole said she hopes the new
Fundamental Standard interpre
tation will serve to educate stu
dents. "Eveiyone in the commu
nity has the opportunity to
respond to the situation accord
ing to their role," she added.
Issues such as assault require
further definition than they did
when the judicial charter was
designed in 1968, Cole said. The
charter, which governs all aspects
of the student judicial process,
may be altered after the Sexual
Assault Task Force's recommen
dations to the University are

released this quarter.
In the future, "the locus of
activity will shift from the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
to the Committee of Fifteen as
changes in the outmoded charter
are made," she said.
The committee, consisting of
six students, six faculty and three
administrators, will be charged
with studying recommendations
and making changes to the char
ter. The committee will convene
in winter quarter.
According to Cole, "The pre
sent charter is outmoded because
there are statements of the rights
of the accused, but no parallel
statement specifying the rights of
the victim."
In the report, Cole also out
lined alternative judicial pro
cesses, including having the Stan
ford Judicial Council, which con
tains both students and faculty
members, hear all cases.
