# TWIN PEAKS UPDATE
## 
### 
Donna takes over Laura Palmer's old Meals
on Wheels route and tries to meet a mysterious
Mr. Smith. Leo is most definitely in a coma.
Shelly and Bobby romp in his father's Buick.
Audrey ties a phone cord around her perfume
boss' neck to find a way out of the brothel. She
calls Agent Cooper and tells him that she's
"almost out of trouble." As the show ends,
Blackie hangs the phone up and tells Audrey,
"Honey, you don't know what trouble means."
