# Reminiscing about the old alcohol policy
## 
### 
Seems like there's two kinds of
change in the world. And two sexes.
And two mfyor universities. . . .
Guess we'll write about change.
In short, there's big change and
there's little change. And then there's
pocket change. But who cares? At the
start of another year at Stanford, we
wouldn't have minded a few little
changes.
It would have been nice, for exam
ple, if the construction of Kimball Hall
had been delayed so workers could
place our new home, Governor's Cor
ner, somewhere in the local area code.
Say, in one of our decorative but impo
tent fountains.
We certainly wouldn't have been
disappointed if the Centennial Cele
bration was a bit more, um, exciting.
And it taxes our imagination only
slightly to dream of a world without
New Kids on the Block.
With a few exceptions, big change is
slow and exacting. Often, it's a bad
idea. We are understandably stunned,
therefore, to see some big changes on
campus.
Ironically, the same city that
brought us Marion "America's Funni
est Home Videos" Barry is lowering

the boom on Stanford's popular and
negligible alcohol policy. This now
defunct arrangement was noteworthy
in that it entailed a certain benevolent
ignorance on the part of the adminis
tration.
The powers that be smiled beatifi
cally upon us and said, "You are your
own masters. You and you alone have
the sole responsibility of deciding
whether or not to down that Schlitz."
And the students smiled back at the
University and downed that Schlitz.
The comprehensive new policy,
which prohibits use, distribution,
development, production and partial
hydrogenation of alcohol (and is even
rumored to frown upon conversation
about it), has many students and
administrators scrambling to react.
In fact, it is not unlikely that
younger fraternity members may soon
find themselves sleeping in the halls as
their elder brothers convert their
rooms into "beer cellars," massive
stockpiles of pre-October (i.e., Old
Alcohol Policy) Bud Light.
Viewed from this perspective, the
recent Kappa Alpha "Rumpus in
Reno" may have served a purpose the
rest of us were not quite aware of.

Obviously, it was nothing more than
a smoothly planned field trip to
increase revenue in preparation for
llth-hour booze procurement. The
mastermind of that plan deserves
applause for a nearly flawless effort. If
only the Strike Force hadn't begun
consuming the booty before reaching
home.
In any event, the stakes are high:
under 21 + alcohol = transfer to San
Jose State. But this doesn't mean stu
dents are the only ones who need to
watch their behavior.
Faculty and administrators will
have to keep their noses clean, too.
Their days of passively overlooking the
existence of campus drugs and alcohol
are over.
Many in the upper ranks are not
thrilled about having to confront this.
As Diana Conklin, acting assoc. dean
of Student Affairs, put it, "Frankly,
I'm grieved." No doubt.
Another thing. How are they going
to enforce this new plan? Hello? Has
anyone thought about this? Maybe
they'll round up faculty and staff to go
on nightly dorm booze patrols.
Or, wait. ... They could divide the
University into quadrants and assign a

resident fellow to each as a "Substance
Control Overlord." But with such fac
ulty involvement, the quality of our
education might suffer, so they'd prob
ably have to call in outside help.
They could bring in a crack
squadron of Liquor Sheriffs, equipped
with battalions of brutal yet keenly
sensitive police hounds. Every officer
would have the authority to bust on
sight, ask questions later.
Imagine Branner, surrounded by
barbed wire, bathed in flood lights, its
residents menaced by large, angry
dogs. ...
Then again, maybe that's not such a
bad idea.

Seems like there's two kinds of
change in the world. And two sexes.
And two mfyor universities. . . .
Guess we'll write about change.
In short, there's big change and
there's little change. And then there's
pocket change. But who cares? At the
start of another year at Stanford, we
wouldn't have minded a few little
changes.
It would have been nice, for exam
ple, if the construction of Kimball Hall
had been delayed so workers could
place our new home, Governor's Cor
ner, somewhere in the local area code.
Say, in one of our decorative but impo
tent fountains.
We certainly wouldn't have been
disappointed if the Centennial Cele
bration was a bit more, um, exciting.
And it taxes our imagination only
slightly to dream of a world without
New Kids on the Block.
With a few exceptions, big change is
slow and exacting. Often, it's a bad
idea. We are understandably stunned,
therefore, to see some big changes on
campus.
Ironically, the same city that
brought us Marion "America's Funni
est Home Videos" Barry is lowering

the boom on Stanford's popular and
negligible alcohol policy. This now
defunct arrangement was noteworthy
in that it entailed a certain benevolent
ignorance on the part of the adminis
tration.
The powers that be smiled beatifi
cally upon us and said, "You are your
own masters. You and you alone have
the sole responsibility of deciding
whether or not to down that Schlitz."
And the students smiled back at the
University and downed that Schlitz.
The comprehensive new policy,
which prohibits use, distribution,
development, production and partial
hydrogenation of alcohol (and is even
rumored to frown upon conversation
about it), has many students and
administrators scrambling to react.
In fact, it is not unlikely that
younger fraternity members may soon
find themselves sleeping in the halls as
their elder brothers convert their
rooms into "beer cellars," massive
stockpiles of pre-October (i.e., Old
Alcohol Policy) Bud Light.
Viewed from this perspective, the
recent Kappa Alpha "Rumpus in
Reno" may have served a purpose the
rest of us were not quite aware of.

Obviously, it was nothing more than
a smoothly planned field trip to
increase revenue in preparation for
llth-hour booze procurement. The
mastermind of that plan deserves
applause for a nearly flawless effort. If
only the Strike Force hadn't begun
consuming the booty before reaching
home.
In any event, the stakes are high:
under 21 + alcohol = transfer to San
Jose State. But this doesn't mean stu
dents are the only ones who need to
watch their behavior.
Faculty and administrators will
have to keep their noses clean, too.
Their days of passively overlooking the
existence of campus drugs and alcohol
are over.
Many in the upper ranks are not
thrilled about having to confront this.
As Diana Conklin, acting assoc. dean
of Student Affairs, put it, "Frankly,
I'm grieved." No doubt.
Another thing. How are they going
to enforce this new plan? Hello? Has
anyone thought about this? Maybe
they'll round up faculty and staff to go
on nightly dorm booze patrols.
Or, wait. ... They could divide the
University into quadrants and assign a

resident fellow to each as a "Substance
Control Overlord." But with such fac
ulty involvement, the quality of our
