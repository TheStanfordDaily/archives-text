# X-tinction revives mutant comic titles
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
I gave up on mutants a while ago.
In the world of comic books, turning
one's back on the "mutant mags" is
almost heretical. Industry giant Marvel
Comics has perennial hits with "X
-men," "X-Factor," and"The New
Mutants." Each book features a group of
characters who have received their pow
ers and talents by heredity, not by freak
accident.
But two to three years ago, all three of
these titles were bland and boring.
"X-men" had so many loose ends and
plot twists that it became impossible to
follow. The New Mutants took a boring
excursion to Asgard, kingdom of the
Norse gods. And "X-Factor" sported art
work that looked like third-grade mate
rial. Although they all continued to sell,
the titles were no more than mundane
mutant magazines.
Now, a new story entitled "X-Tinction
Agenda" is returning the titles to their
past glory. The series is nine issues long
and appears in three consecutive issues

Chris Claremont has written an exciting and interest
ing plot which maintains continuity throughout each
title.

of each book. And rumor has it that each
mutant group will undergo drastic
changes in its lineup.
Even more importantly, however,
Chris Claremont has written an exciting
and interesting plot which maintains
continuity throughout each title.
Some of the youngest members of the
New Mutants team have been kidnapped
by the country of Genosha and are
scheduled for immediate execution. War
lock, one of the New Mutants, has
already been killed, and three other
mutants have lost their powers or their
minds.
The crisis involves modern topics in
its subplots, including genetic engineer
ing, the lack of international authority
and the power of one country to forcibly
take "criminals" from another country's
territory.

Jim Lee's artwork in "X-Men" shines
the brightest of the three books. His
depictions of Wolverine display a savage,
bloodthirsty air, and his layouts flow
smoothly throughout the book.
Rookie Rob Liefeld's work on "New
Mutants" is good, including his trade
mark sideways-splash page, but below
the level of his work earlier this summer
And Al Milgrom still inks on "X-
Factor". . . well, two out of three isn't
bad.
"X-Tinction Agenda" proves that Mar
vel's mutant mags can be excellent
comics when given focused, interesting
storylines. As the comic industry
matures, it's good to watch the main
stream titles tackle serious issues and do
some growing up on their own.
