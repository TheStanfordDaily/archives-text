# BETWEEN THE LINES
## Rap takes aim at Elvis 
### 
Ever since Mojo Nixon called Michael
I. Fox the "Anti-Elvis" in his breakthrough
nit, "Elvis Is Everywhere," rap groups
have been trying to prove that Fox isn't
the only one.
A glance at rap lyrics from the past
Sar shows "the King" taking some heavy
ts from the self-proclaimed voices of the
black community.
Public Enemy started the anti-Elvis
barrage with the following line from
"Fight the Power": "Elvis was a hero to
most, But he never meant * * * * to me you
see/ Straight up racist that sucker was/
Simple and plain/ Mother **** him and
John Wayne."
Several other rap groups characteristi
cally followed PE's lead, with many
attacks coming through at the 1989 New
Music Seminar; even the liner notes from
Queen Latifah's debut album took a
swipe at the jump-suited one, by noting
special thanks to "Elvis (not Presley)."
Now. Living Colour has jumped on the
bandwagon with their song "Elvis is
Dead" off the "Time's Up" album.
So, where does all this Elvis-bashing
come from?
Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid
provides an insightful explanation in a
recent edition of Bam magazine. One pos
sible explanation is based on a quote
attributed to Elvis in Jet magazine: "The
only thing a black person can do is shine
my shoes and buy my records."
Elvis never responded to the quote, a
characteristic indifference to negative
press at that point in his career.
But considering Elvis' close friendships
with Sammy Davis Jn, Phineas Newborn
Jr. and 8.8. King, and his own expressed
love for black music — symbolized by his
being the only white person in attendance
at Bo Diddlev and 8.8. King concerts, the
unconfirmed quote would be a weak basis

to attack the man.
Another possible reason is the stream
of racist remarks spouted by Elvis' man
ager Colonel Tbm Parker In preparation
for the movie "The Defiant Ones," where
Elvis was to appear opposite Sammy
Davis, Jr., Parker refused — reportedly
saying, "I'm not going to have Elvis
chained to a nigger for a whole movie."
Again, though, Elvis can't be dis
counted for the actions of his managers
— who Reid says "manipulated" Elvis
anyway.
So, what does all the Elvis-bashing
mean? As Reid explains, "Elvis marks the
point at which black people suddenly
began to be marginalized in rock music.
And that's not so much the fault of Elvis
as it is the forces that determined he
would be the king of rock 'n' roll."
Basically, the crowning of Elvis meant
ignoring innovative artists like Little
Richard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and
Bo Diddley, who were relegated to a sec
ond-best status.
The real attack by Living Colour and
other groups is directed at the mania that
still surrounds him: "Tabloids scream/
Elvis seen at a shopping mall/ That's the
kind of talk/ That makes my stomach
crawl." The song explains that even while
Elvis is in the grave, we are still "slave" to
his persona.
In essence, the rap against Elvis
attacks the same thing Nixon was trying
to parody: Elvis-mania. So if you're start
ing to believe Spike Lee's comment that
no black people like Elvis, to paraphrase
Nixon's message, "Don't believe the
hype."
