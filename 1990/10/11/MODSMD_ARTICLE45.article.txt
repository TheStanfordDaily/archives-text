# Two Indigo Girls better than one

Indigo Girls
Nomads Indians Saints
Grade: B
On their first two albums, "Indigo
Girls" and "Strange Fire," Amy Saliers
and Amy Ray have strived to sound like
one entity, with melodies and harmonies
interweaving like a tapestry.
But on "Nomads Indians Saints," the
new album from the Indigo Girls, the pair
often performs separately. As expected,
the solo tracks pale in comparison with
the unique sound of the folk-singing duo.

As expected, the solo
tracks pale in compari
son with the unique
sound ot the tolk-slnglng
duo.

Fans of old Indigo Girls songs will not
be totally disheartened by the new album,
which includes many tracks that echo
"Land of Canaan," "Closer to Fine," "Kid
Fears" and "Crazy Game."
"Nomads Indians Saints" opens
strongly with "Hammer and a Nail," a
quick song with a vibrant melody that
highlights the duo's complex harmonies.
Ray accompanies Saliers' vocals in the
chorus as the pair laud the pleasure of
being environmentally conscious.
On "Watershed," "Hand Me Downs"
and "You and Me of the 10,000 Wars,"
the Indigo Girls sounds true to form. Ray
and Saliers complement each other no
matter which one is singing lead vocals,
and their guitars never drown out their
poignant lyrics.
When each woman tries her hand at a
solo track, however, one recognizes
marked differences. On "Girl with the
Weight of the World in Her Hands,"

Saliers' smooth voice and background
violins make the track especially touch
ing and personally moving.
Ray, on the other hand, falls short
while in the spotlight. Although "Keeper
of My Heart" flows well, Ray's gravel-like
vocals on "1 2 3" and "World Falls"
sound terrible on its own.
When Ray sings "I'm coming home

with a stone strapped to my back," one
wonders if she is referring to her own
vocals, which require Saliers' backups for
buoyancy.
"Nomads Indians Saints" spotlights
the talents of the Indigo Girls, but flails
on some of the solo tracks. In the case of
the Indigo Girls, two heads are clearly
better than one.
