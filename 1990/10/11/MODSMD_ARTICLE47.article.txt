# 'State,' Penn hit gangster revival bull's-eye
## 
### 
State of Grace
Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Robin
Wright
Grade: A
When you pull the trigger of a fully
automatic rifle, it's impossible to fire
one shot. You neither can stop the flow
of bullets nor do you want to. It's a rush
that you rarely get to experience.
Such is the case with the American
film industry's revival of the gangster
film. In just a matter of two weeks, sev
eral excellent mob movies have landed
on the screen. Each one hits the cine
matic target, but it is "State of Grace"
that scores a bull's-eye.
Currently, most of the critical atten
tion is divided between admiration for
Martin Scorsese's "Good Fellas" and
anticipation of Francis Ford Coppola's
"The Godfather, Part III." Director Phil
Joanou's jarring masterworlc will add a
third target discussion.
An important difference between the
three films lies in the social classes
focused upon. "The Godfather" films
follow the lives of a royal family in the
mob kingdom, while "Good Fellas" and
"State of Grace" bring you down among
the henchmen.
Both of the new films share a pen
chant for sudden, graphic violence,
while most of the dialogue consists of
profane variations on traditional, Holly
wood tough guy talk — yet the perfor
mances of the actors make it riveting
art.
The lead performances by Ray Liotta
in "Good Fellas" and Sean Penn in
"State of Grace" set the tones of the
films and provide them with their emo
tional centers.
Liotta's Henry Hill is a man who
wants more than anything else to be a
wiseguy, a goodfella. Since the film
unfolds from his viewpoint, much of
the mob is depicted in an enthusiastic,
almost favorable light.

In "State of Grace," the criminal
world of New York's Hell's Kitchen
inflicts emotional turmoil on Penn's
Tferry Noonan. He has attempted to
escape only to be pulled reluctantly in
again.
Even though Penn's delivery some
times sounds like nothing more than
drunken mumbling, his overall perfor
mance succeeds violently in creating a
moving character. Penn, who is used to
playing tough guys, does it with the
poignancy of a native son returning
home to witness the disintegration of
his culture.

"State of Grace," however, is not a
one-man show. The other three main
characters — Jackie Flannery (Gary
Oldman), his brother and boss Frankie
Flannery (Ed Harris) and their younger
sister Kathleen Flannery (Robin Wright)
— all come to life vividly.
Oldman, who plays the role of
Penn's explosive best friend, is like a
live wire as hot as Harris and Wright are
mercilessly cold.
Joanou skillfully adopts the late
Dennis Mclntyre's script, giving the
film suspense and emotional impact.
One of the year's most exciting scenes

occurs when Penn's and Oldman's Irish
gang awaits for the signal, in the form of
a phone call, to kill a group of Italian
mobsters. The only problem is that the
gang cannot remember whether the call
means they are to carry out the hit or go
home.

Although "Good Fellas" has been
worshiped by critics nationwide, "State
of Grace" deserves more attention. It's
one of those rare films that comes
along, seizes hold of you and just blows
you away.

one-man show. The other three main
characters — Jackie Flannery (Gary
Oldman), his brother and boss Frankie
Flannery (Ed Harris) and their younger
sister Kathleen Flannery (Robin Wright)
— all come to life vividly.
Oldman, who plays the role of
Penn's explosive best friend, is like a
live wire as hot as Harris and Wright are
mercilessly cold.
Joanou skillfully adopts the late
Dennis Mclntyre's script, giving the
film suspense and emotional impact.
One of the year's most exciting scenes

occurs when Penn's and Oldman's Irish
gang awaits for the signal, in the form of
a phone call, to kill a group of Italian
mobsters. The only problem is that the
gang cannot remember whether the call
means they are to carry out the hit or go
home.

Although "Good Fellas" has been
worshiped by critics nationwide, "State
of Grace" deserves more attention. It's
one of those rare films that comes
along, seizes hold of you and just blows
you away.
