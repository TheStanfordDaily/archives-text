Fantasia
Walt Disney
Grade: A
It is exactly 50 years since Walt
Disney's animated masterpiece
"Fantasia" came to life. In celebra
tion of this birthday of sorts, Dis
ney studios has restored the worn
film to its original auality.
And what a job they aid.
The first time I saw "Fantasia,"
about 12 years ago, the film was
cracked, the soundtrack fuzzy and
occasionally there were black spots
on the screen. But it was still one of
my favorite movies.
And now it's even better
Sure, you can still tell that it
was made a long time ago. Sure,
movies made today are of much
better quality — film quality, that
is. But nothing is like "Fantasia." It
was like seeing it for the first time
all over again.
I coula tell you all about "Fanta
sia." I could tell you how, when it
first came out, it was a flop. Not
just a little flop, but a huge one.
Not one critic liked it.
I could tell you how now it is
probably the most well-known and
well-liked movie ever I've never
heard a bad word said about it. At
least not since it immediately
came out.
I could tell you how the anima
tion is so creative and so amazing,
that even though it was created 50

years ago, it is still superior to any
I've seen recently.
Or I could tell you how it
seemed to fit so perfectly to the
music that I wondered how they
did it, creative geniuses or not. I
even found myself wondering if
there was any way the movie was
made first, though that's not any
where near a realm of possibility.
I could tell you any of those
things. But I think I'll let the audi
ence who saw it with me do the
telling.
"Wow. That's really cool!"
"Where's Mickey? Mommy,
when is Mickey coming?"
"That's neat!"
"Yeah! Even neater than the
Tbenage Mutant Ninja Hirtles!"
"Where's Mickey?"
"That looks like Batman!"
"Is Mickey soon? I want to see
Mickey."
"Where did they go? I liked
them."
"There's Mickey! Hi Mickey!"
I have never seen such a large
group of children aged three to
seven behave so well for so long.
They were enticed. They laughed
out loud and talked excitedly about
what they were seeing or had seen.
They left the theater asking
when they could go again. Tbnight?
Tomorrow? When, Mom? Huh?
They loved it. And so did I. And
so will you.
