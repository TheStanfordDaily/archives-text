# Stylish 'Crossing' finds mob character

Miller's Crossing
Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne,
Marcla Gay Harden
Grade: B+
Amid the recent flood of gang
ster films to hit the silver screen
("Goodfellas," "State of Grace"),
"Miller's Crossing" is strangely
distinct — not surprising consid
ering the makers of the film are
Joel and Ethan Co?n
The brotherly duo who
brought us the odd thriller "Blood
Simple" and bizarre comedy
"Raising Arizona" have again
lived up to their status with
"Miller's Crossing" — directed
by Joel, produced by Ethan and
written by both.
Set in a nameless eastern city
in 1929, the movie is at once an
homage to and a satire of two
genres: gangster films and film
noir.
But as much as the film trib
utes these classic genres, it
assuredly leaps from the formats'
constraints and delivers a won
derfully complex and ironic story
of friendship, ethics and charac
ter:
The story revolves around the
friendship of two Irish gangsters:
Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney), a
political boss whose control over
the city is slowly diminishing,
and Tbm Reagan (Gabriel Byrne),

Leo's clever and brooding right
hand man.
Despite his feelings of loyalty
to Leo, Tbm has been sleeping
with Leo's sexy, tough-talking
mistress, Verna (Marcia Gay
Harden), unbeknownst to Leo.
If a word could describe
"Miller's Crossing," it might be
"stylish." The Coens obsess
themselves with the look and feel
of every scene, every frame, and
the result is a visually beautiful
film. The story deals with the
dark relationships of men,
reflected in the richly dark color
scheme that penetrates almost
every scene.
The film's substance seems to
derive from the style and surface
of the film itself. The meaning of
the terse and fluid dialogue is
often less in the words than how
they are said.
In acknowledging its genre,
the film offers typical caricatures:
a greasy mobster, a weasel-like
bookie; but the characters are
made real — the mobster is a lov
ing, ill-tempered father and the
bookie has a male lover
A dark and melancholy soul
who has fallen away from his
ideals, Tbm has become existen
tial man, alone to defend himself
from a hostile environment with
only his wits to aid him.
