# A 						journey of sexual awakening

Henry & June
Maria de Madelros, Fred

Giade: A-
The controversy surrounding
its rating may have dominated
the press prior to the release of
"Henry and June," but this first
movie to be labeled NC-17 (no
children under 17 admitted) is
hardly the graphic stuff that the
initial X rating would suggest.
It is instead a mysterious and
beautiful journey into the realms
of body and spirit, of discovery
both erotic and intellectual.
Based on the bold and furi
ously-written diaries of Anais
Nin in 1931-32, it is she, and
neither Henry or June Miller,
who is the focus of the movie's
attention.
Maria de Medeiros, a French
theater star from Portugal, plays
Anais with a vulnerability and
concealed aggressiveness that
makes this story of her sexual
awakening both believable and
beautiful.
The relationship of Anais, a
beginning writer, and the more
experienced, though not pub

lished, Henry (Fred Ward), is
introduced by Anais' conven
tional husband Hugo and stems
from the awkward lending of a
typewriter. Yet soon Anais and
tne cocky American are sharing
work, bed and even Henry's
bisexual wife June (Uma Thur
man).
The relationships among the
three are anything but under
standable; yet these complicated
situations, narrated by Anais as
she writes in her diary, are han
dled with a sensibility that
makes even the most unconven
tional scenes seem natural, pas
sionate and incredibly intriguing.
We discover Henry's insensi
tivity and his tenderness, and
Anais' emerging from position of
seduced to skillful seductress.
But it is the enigma of June
which keeps the triangle spin
ning.
The sultry blonde, who floats
in and out of the others' lives at
random, forms a strong visual as
well as spiritual contrast to the
dark and naive Anais that is the
basis of much of the imagery and
symbolism in the movie.
June also is the one who, in a

rage over the way Henry and
Anais have both written about
her, divulges the themes; she
questions the writer's intentions
and makes the desire for experi
ence the link the between the
film's sexual and intellectual ele
ments.
While "Henry and June" is
definitely a movie that makes
you think, there is a is lighter
side that enriches the scenes
with an aura of wit and magic.
At one point, the Paris streets
fill with blue dancers, one of
whom, surprisingly enough, is
Hugo. On the street, in a dining
room there are performances of
amazing and wonderful tricks.
A backroom in a Spanish club
serves as scene of more than one
seduction, silhouettes of the
dancers huge behind the passion
of the darkened floor. A pick
pocketed wallet that turns into a
dove becomes a foreshadowing of
Anais' own discovery.
One warning: this movie is
long (135 minutes), but you'll
want to stay awake for the beau
tiful end to this incredible adven
ture into the nature of sex and
spirit.
