# Be forewarned about 'Warrant'
## Jean-Claude van Damme action flick tries for too much drama 
### 
Death Warrant
Jean-Claude van Damme
Grade: C-
There are connoisseurs for vir
tually every interest or field in
human life. Some learn every
aspect of wine, others devote huge
amounts of time and memory to
sports, while others immerse
themselves in the philosophy and
literature of the world; however, I
have lost myself in the realm of
violent, male-oriented, aggressive
films.
Thus, I can spurn the claims of
dilettantes who believe they under
stand the undercurrents swirling
below the topical superficialities of
such memorable flicks as
"Cyborg," "Rambo III" and "Hard
to Kill," for I have partaken of the
entire genre.
For example, this week, I have
had the golden opportunity to see
"I Come in Peace," "Death War
rant" and "Marked for Death." Few
could hope to aspire to such a
heady list as this.
As these kind of films go,
"Death Warrant," although better
than "I Come in Peace," is pretty
lame. Jean-Claude van Damme,

Van Damme, admired for his martial arts
prowess in "Bloodsport* and 'Kickboxer,' tries
to act a little too much for anyone's good.

who we all admired for his martial
arts prowess in "Bloodsport" and
"Kickboxer," tries to act a little too
much for anyone's good.
In fact, the plot buildup
stretches along for most of the
movie, so there are only a couple of
minutes worth of action. Forget
such paltry things as character
development and acting, these
characters are so two-dimensional
one hesitates to believe they can be
seen from the side. Thank good
ness for the flat movie screen.
As always, van Damme is a cop
who has a long-term enemy, this
one called the "Sandman." Van
Damme is sent into prison under
cover to figure out why so many
prisoners have been dying lately.
Teamed up with him is the
omnipresent mismatched partner,
this time in the form of a lawyer
(top of her class at Stanford,
nonetheless), played by Cynthia

Gibb, who also has to play the role
of van Damme's wife so she can
act as his liason from prison.
Blah blah blah blah blah.
So anyway, at the end of the
movie our hero faces off with the
prime bad guy, Gibb discovers that
her superiors in the government
are baa, and the two make love to
each other in a mobile home —
specially provided for prisoners
who are in solitary confinement
when their "wives" come to visit.
Every once in a while, I enjoy a
senseless flick just as much as the
next person; however, I've slipped
into a rut, and it's about time I saw
a real attempt at a movie. Save
yourself the time and the brain
cells and skip parole on "Death
Warrant," the title of which has
absolutely nothing to do with the
movie, if that's a surprise.
