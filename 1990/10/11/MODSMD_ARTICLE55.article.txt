# Company avoids pratfalls of Mozart's opera
## 
### Alexander Rawis 
Mozart's Die Entfuhrung aus
dem SeraiJ, currently being per
formed by the San Francisco
Opera, tells the story of a young
nobleman tries to rescue his
fiancee and two servants from slav
ery in Hirkey.
One of Mozart's great master
pieces, Entfuhrung is often ruined
by a common error in staging, one
which Bernard Shaw encountered
in the staging of his plays. As
Shaw's biographer wrote about the
opening run of Arms and the Man:
"The actors, who could make
neither head nor tail of the busi
ness, played with anxious serious
ness, and were rewarded with a
crazy success. The audience
laugned immoderately at nearly
everything. Unfortunately, the
actors, convinced by the laughs
that this strange piece must be a
farce, began to play for them on the
conventional farcical comedy
lines; and the first-night success
was never repeated."
Avoiding this pitfall is the key to
a successful Entfuhrung. The
opera is full of danger, and the com
edy is in the nature of comic relief
as courage stands up to power on
the stage.
Play it for its laughs, as the
Carmel Bach Festival did last sum
mer; and it goes all out of focus.
Neither can the beautiful music
redeem it when the characteriza

tions are wrong; the voice is guided
by the feelings, and if they are
wrong, the singing will be also.
I became worried about the San
Francisco production when the
brochure's description read as fol
lows: "Kurt Moll recreates his
'cherishable study in comic vil
lainy' ... as the lovable buffoon
Osmin, thwarting to hilarious
results the lovers' escape from the
Pasha's harem."
Osmin is a would-be rapist and
murderer and the scene following
the capture of the heroes is the
most threatening and tragic in the
opera.
As it turned out, howevei; the
dramatic pitch of the performance
was perfect, and every aspect of
Mozart's thrilling masterpiece fell
correspondingly in place.
In Act 111, for instance, when
the men set out with their ladder to
abduct the women, Pedrillo's light
hearted understatement elicits a
concerned laugh that refreshes the
tension and sets a perfect stage for
the singing of the signal for the
women to escape.
The lilting melody of this beau
tiful ballad is taken up pizzicato by
the strings who draw it out one
extra measure, two, before finally
letting it resolve.
Belmonte looks like he wants to
pull his hair out even as Pedrillo
nonchalantly lets fly with the next
verse. You can't help but laugh
even though you feel they are about

to get killed.
Of the principals, only Susan
Patterson, in the role of Constanza,
sang with seemingly effortless
beauty and carrying power Yet all
of the singers had good clear voices
and captured their parts most art
fully.
Once the dramatic pitch of Ent
fuhrung has been caught, the
opera's next challenge is to keep
the drama alive during the old
fashioned type solo arias where the
action would stop to express a par
ticular character's emotional state.
Mozart made every effort to
incorporate these arias into the
drama and one cannot help think
ing that, he would have gladly
abandoned most of the ones not
directly related to the plot if his
leading singers would have stood
for it.
The San Francisco production
includes many nice touches that
bring the solo arias into the drama,
as in Act I where Pasha Selim
encircles Constanza with the long
train of his cape, symbolizing his
absolute power over her.
In her aria she tells him that she
cannot give in to his love because
she loves another Being a man of
honor, Selim's instinct is to release
his grip on her who would spurn
his love, and so he moves away
from her angrily, like a lion.
Still, half of the solo arias (and
most of Belmonte's) are hopelessly
undramatic, even where they are

very beautiful. They are a welcome
adaition to people who have
acquired the taste, but they make
the opera less accessible to a
broader audience.
If some producer would take an
excellent staging of Entfuhrung
like this one, and ruthlessly edit it
down to a two-hour film, it would
be every bit as popular as a modern
masterpiece like "My Fair Lady."
Like most great art, Entfuhrung
is important as well as entertain
ing. It must be one of the earliest
feminist tracts on record, insisting
on a woman's right to be free from
all coercion. Constanza is willing
to die rather than succumb to
power, and in the most tempting
and provoking circumstances,
Pasha Selim is heroically unwilling
to use it.
Love, injustice, sacrifice, adven
ture; Mozart drenched himself in
work like this, and there is no
higher recommendation than that.

Performances are Saturday, Tues
day and next Friday. To go stand
ing room, arrive about two hours
before the show, buy a $6 ticket
and put a place keeper in line in
front of one of the several doors-,
come back before the doors open
one hour before the show, hustle
up the three stories to the Grand
Tier and put your place keeper on
the rail; and come back for the
opera.

before the show, buy a $6 ticket
and put a place keeper in line in
front of one of the several doors-,
come back before the doors open
one hour before the show, hustle
up the three stories to the Grand
Tier and put your place keeper on
the rail; and come back for the
opera.
Mozart's Die Entfuhrung aus
dem SeraiJ, currently being per
formed by the San Francisco
Opera, tells the story of a young
nobleman tries to rescue his
fiancee and two servants from slav
ery in Hirkey.
One of Mozart's great master
pieces, Entfuhrung is often ruined
by a common error in staging, one
which Bernard Shaw encountered
in the staging of his plays. As
Shaw's biographer wrote about the
opening run of Arms and the Man:
"The actors, who could make
neither head nor tail of the busi
ness, played with anxious serious
ness, and were rewarded with a
crazy success. The audience
laugned immoderately at nearly
everything. Unfortunately, the
actors, convinced by the laughs
that this strange piece must be a
farce, began to play for them on the
conventional farcical comedy
lines; and the first-night success
was never repeated."
Avoiding this pitfall is the key to
a successful Entfuhrung. The
opera is full of danger, and the com
edy is in the nature of comic relief
as courage stands up to power on
the stage.
Play it for its laughs, as the
Carmel Bach Festival did last sum
mer; and it goes all out of focus.
Neither can the beautiful music
redeem it when the characteriza

tions are wrong; the voice is guided
by the feelings, and if they are
wrong, the singing will be also.
I became worried about the San
Francisco production when the
brochure's description read as fol
lows: "Kurt Moll recreates his
'cherishable study in comic vil
lainy' ... as the lovable buffoon
Osmin, thwarting to hilarious
results the lovers' escape from the
Pasha's harem."
Osmin is a would-be rapist and
murderer and the scene following
the capture of the heroes is the
most threatening and tragic in the
opera.
As it turned out, howevei; the
dramatic pitch of the performance
was perfect, and every aspect of
Mozart's thrilling masterpiece fell
correspondingly in place.
In Act 111, for instance, when
the men set out with their ladder to
abduct the women, Pedrillo's light
hearted understatement elicits a
concerned laugh that refreshes the
tension and sets a perfect stage for
the singing of the signal for the
women to escape.
The lilting melody of this beau
tiful ballad is taken up pizzicato by
the strings who draw it out one
extra measure, two, before finally
letting it resolve.
Belmonte looks like he wants to
pull his hair out even as Pedrillo
nonchalantly lets fly with the next
verse. You can't help but laugh
even though you feel they are about

to get killed.
Of the principals, only Susan
Patterson, in the role of Constanza,
sang with seemingly effortless
beauty and carrying power Yet all
of the singers had good clear voices
and captured their parts most art
fully.
Once the dramatic pitch of Ent
fuhrung has been caught, the
opera's next challenge is to keep
the drama alive during the old
fashioned type solo arias where the
action would stop to express a par
ticular character's emotional state.
Mozart made every effort to
incorporate these arias into the
drama and one cannot help think
ing that, he would have gladly
abandoned most of the ones not
directly related to the plot if his
leading singers would have stood
for it.
The San Francisco production
includes many nice touches that
bring the solo arias into the drama,
as in Act I where Pasha Selim
encircles Constanza with the long
train of his cape, symbolizing his
absolute power over her.
In her aria she tells him that she
cannot give in to his love because
she loves another Being a man of
honor, Selim's instinct is to release
his grip on her who would spurn
his love, and so he moves away
from her angrily, like a lion.
Still, half of the solo arias (and
most of Belmonte's) are hopelessly
undramatic, even where they are

very beautiful. They are a welcome
adaition to people who have
acquired the taste, but they make
the opera less accessible to a
broader audience.
If some producer would take an
excellent staging of Entfuhrung
like this one, and ruthlessly edit it
down to a two-hour film, it would
be every bit as popular as a modern
masterpiece like "My Fair Lady."
Like most great art, Entfuhrung
is important as well as entertain
ing. It must be one of the earliest
feminist tracts on record, insisting
on a woman's right to be free from
all coercion. Constanza is willing
to die rather than succumb to
power, and in the most tempting
and provoking circumstances,
Pasha Selim is heroically unwilling
to use it.
Love, injustice, sacrifice, adven
ture; Mozart drenched himself in
work like this, and there is no
higher recommendation than that.

Performances are Saturday, Tues
day and next Friday. To go stand
