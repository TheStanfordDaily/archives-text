Friends and colleagues shared memories of
the late Mathematics Prof. Paul W. Berg at a
memorial service in Cubberley Auditorium
yesterday
Berg died of throat cancer June 11 at his
son's home in Baltimore. He was 65 years old.
Describing Berg as "a friend and valued col
league," Mathematics Prof. Harold Bacon
commented, "his ever-ready smile and good
humor . .. will never be forgotten."
Gerald Lieberman, professor of operations
research and statistics and a close friend of
Berg, spoke of the many memories and times
he and Berg shared. Referring to the many
Stanford football games they attended

together, he said, "It isn't quite the same this
year."
"Paul did the unthinkable," Lieberman
continued. "He was not concerned with the
impossible."
Recalling one particular memory, Lieber
man noted, "Paul said he needed one suitcase
for presents for his grandsons."
Berg was an influential member of the
Stanford community for 37 years. Along with
Prof. James McGregor, he co-authored the
highly acclaimed textbook "Elementary Par
tial Differential Equations."
In addition, Berg was instrumental in
developing both the applied linear algebra
sequence and the Mathematical and Computa
tional Science program, an interdisciplinary

mcgor.
Berg wa9 vice chair of the Mathematics
Department for 13 years, from 1967 to 1980.
He was also an undergraduate advisor and a
member of the faculty senate for much of his
time at Stanford.
Above all, however, Berg was a teacher.
"First and foremost, he liked teaching." He
was more than the average devoted teacher,
said his son Jeremy Berg in a phone interview
Tuesday.
"He was a teacher as a formal instructor
inclass, as an adviser to students and as a father
to me," he continued. "He eryoyed sharing
knowledge with people and enjoyed learning."
