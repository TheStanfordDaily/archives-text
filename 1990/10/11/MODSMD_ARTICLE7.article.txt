# Taking the next step: being openly gay in a non-gay world
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Senior Chris Hayes has been looking for
an excuse to tell his co-workers at Network
ing Services that he's gay Today, he has an
opportunity.
Today is National Coming Out Day,
when gays and lesbians across the country
are taking steps of all kinds toward letting
others know about their sexuality.
"I've been wanting to do it for some
time," says Hayes, who is an officer of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center. "Sometimes I find it difficult... to
just come out without any pretext. [Today]
provides me a reason to do so."
The event encourages gays and lesbians

to take their "next step" toward coming out
to their family, friends, co-workers and leg
islators, according to Lynn Shepodd, execu
tive director of the third annual National
Coming Out Day. "We want the conversa
tion about coming out to begin every
where."
The Daily spoke with three undergradu
ates, of various ethnicities, who are at dif
ferent stages of the coming-out process.
Each is concerned about different issues —
from finding other gays, to telling friends
and family, to being openly gay in a non-gay
world.
Their stories are by no means represen
tative of the entire spectrum of coming out
experiences, but they capture some of the
emotions and ordeals gay and lesbian peo

pie on this campus confront.
Dealing with gay feelings
"Doug" was barely a teenager when he
saw the man in the next bathroom stall tap
his foot. Curious, he tapped his own foot
back, and before he knew it, the man had
gotten down on his knees and was caressing
Doug's leg.
Although he found his first sexual part
ner "basically by accident," Doug, now an
undergraduate, looks back at that incident
as the first time he was able to express his
lifelong attraction toward other men.
As Doug grew older, anonymous bath
room sex became an addiction.
Whenever he felt he could not "handle
it,"he recalls, the following scenario

ensued: "I go to this one bathroom and sit
in a stall. I tap my foot and wait to see if
they tap back, as a signal."
Typically Doug and the other man would
engage in mutual masturbation and occa
sionally oral sex underneath the stall.
Doug was swamped by emotions each
time he had an encounter. "I felt guilty,
ashamed, depressed — I was nervous,
scared of the danger, angry with myself. M
He came to Stanford assuming that the
gay community on a college campus would
be more open about sexuality and that he
could be accepted as a gay man for the first
time. He quickly sought counseling and
"came out" for the first time.

Talking about his gay feelings was
a big relief for Doug. "I just felt
happy about myself, that I had
opened up a part of me that had
been hidden."
Doug has tried to reconcile his
homosexuality with his family's
strict Mormon faith. "I find it a
real struggle being Mormon and
being gay."
At times, Doug's frustrations
have driven him "very close" to
attempting to kill himself. He says
suicide sometimes "seems like the
only way 0ut.... You have to keep
•yourself hidden and bottle up
your feelings — and they build up
in rages."
• • •
Trudie Heming, a lesbian psy
chologist at Counseling and Psy
chological Services, says it's not
unusual for students who come
from backgrounds that reject
homosexuality, like Doug, to feel
tremendous tension.
"I have known cases where the
individual Mormon parents, say,
have been very accepting of their
Mormon child," she says. "But
there's still that loss because the
greater group doesn't accept
homosexuality and has made it so
clear."
Heming says suicidal thoughts
accompanying coming out at first
are quite common to people whose
culture rejects homosexuality.
"That's why it's so important
that there be a gay, lesbian and
bisexual community that people
coming out can become part of to
counteract those feelings of
despair and isolation," she says.
Students dealing with sexual
issues often turn to the Bridge,
the peer counseling center, for a
sympathetic ear. According to
senior Ariel Lang, a staffer at the
Bridge, gay students often like to
talk to gay peer counselors
"because they have more familiar
ity with the issues."
However, all the counselors at
the Bridge have received training
in sexual issues, and Lang says
"anyone is able and willing to talk
about gay and lesbian issues."
The Bridge has at least one gay
male and one lesbian peer coun
selor available to talk to students
on the phone or in person. Also, a
"Coming-Out Rap Group" meets
at the Bridge on Sundays from 4
to 6 p.m.

Telling friends and family
"Mitch" doesn't have a
boyfriend. If he did, the freshman
says he'd like to go with him
"through the middle of the Quad
at 12 noon holding hands." But
even Mitch's freshman roommate
doesn't know Mitch is gay.
"[My roommate] would have
an absolute herd of cows if he ever
found out. He's made many sexist
and racist comments, and I'm
assuming the pattern follows to
homophobic reactions," says
Mitch.
Most of Mitch's friends are
women, and he's comfortable
telling many of them he's gay. "We
have fun with it,"he says with a
grin. "We'll go mall-hopping, and
we'll pick out guys."
But Mitch is hardly out of the
closet. He says he waits to develop
a "level of trust" with a given
group or individual before decid
ing to come out.
"A mayor obstacle in fully com
ing out is the potential loss of
friends and acquaintances," he
says. He is concerned about being
stereotyped and labeled as gay.
Some of Mitch's gay friends
think his attitude about being gay
is hypocritical. "I am very accept
ing and understanding of who I
am," he explains. "It's part of my
identity, and I embrace it as such.
[But] I'm not fully out of the
closet. I don't wear pink triangles
(symbolizing gay pride), and some
of my homosexual friends say that
that is why I am hypocritical."
Mitch has a message for gays
who are still in the closet: "Don't
repress the feelings that you have.
Stifling such emotions will only
succeed in slitting your own
wrists. If you have those feelings,
pursue them as far and as wide as
you feel comfortable."
But he adds a word of caution.
"Mainstream society can be
oppressive and sometimes violent
to people of our persuasion."
Mitch's father knows Mitch is
gay. "My dad is very open, accept
ing and very liberal." However,
Mitch complains his being gay has
become "a game for him of sorts.
He'll take a dig in me every once
in a while."
Because he feels his stepfather
is "prejudiced," Mitch has chosen
not to tell his mother he's gay. "I
know I really should tell my
Mom," he says, adding that he
thinks she'd be even more sympa
thetic than his father.
Although Mitch may not be

open enough yet about his sexual
orientation to act upon his fantasy
of walking through the Quad
hand in hand with his boyfriend,
he says he has no conflicts about
feeling gay.
He shrugs. "I'm happy with it."

Heming, from CAPS, explains
that coming out to friends is often
the first step for many students.
But, "on this campus the ante is
really high when coming out to
friends. .. . It's quite frighten
ing," she says.
Gay students like Mitch must
deal with such issues as whether
their friends will reject them,
"freak out" or talk behind their
backs, Heming notes.
Sometimes, even when friends
have none of these reactions, a
certain "awkwardness" remains
in a relationship, Heming says.
Heming would like to remind
students such as Mitch's room
mate that when they're making
homophobic jokes and comments,
"it's quite possible that one of
their [secretly homosexual]
friends may be listening and
thinking 'I'd really like to tell so
and-so, but look at what they're
saying.'"
She says students who aren't
open about their orientation with
their friends listen carefully and
make judgments about how safe it
is to tell them.
While telling friends is diffi
cult, "family is often the hardest
to come out to, especially par
ents," says Hayes. "Parents invest
a certain emotional commitment
into what their children d 0.... It
often comes as a shock and a dis
appointment."
Hayes says a lot of gays come
out to siblings before telling their
parents. Students of both sexes
often find it easier to tell sisters
than brothers, he notes.
"When people think about
coming out to their parents, they
go through a stage where they
have to process all their worst fan
tasies," Heming says. "But I'm
happy to say I have yet to find a
situation when it's backfired.
Oftentimes, it's not wonderful,
but it initiates a process of dia
logue between the parents and the
child."
She says gays and lesbians
often ask themselves what they
are losing by not sharing such an
important aspect of their lives
with their families. Many feel they
cannot be close without being
totally honest, she adds.

"More and more we're seeing
people choosing to come out to
their parents," Heming says.
Her entire junior year in high
school, "Tracy" couldn't stop
thinking about the possibility she
might be a lesbian.
She read a lot of books at the
library — gay fiction and books on
human sexuality. Then, the sum
mer before her senior year, she
saw a group of lesbian sorority
members on the talk show "Don
ahue."
"It just clicked in my mind that
that was what I'd been struggling
with," she says.
Tracy's first sexual experience
was with a close friend, a woman a
few years her senior. "It was an
enjoyable experience," she says.
"But I knew I was gay before
then. I had been out for five
months before I had even kissed a
woman."
Tracy came out at her high
school last spring and has been
openly lesbian except to her par
ents ever since.
"I was out the minute I hit
campus," she says. Tracy partici
pated in events at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center during Prospective Fresh
man Week in May and has already
come out to many people in her
dormitory. She even plans to par
ticipate in a gay speaker's bureau
program in her dorm later this
month.
Tracy, who wears a pink trian
gle everywhere she goes, says the
people in the dorm who know she
is lesbian have reacted very well.
"No one in my dorm has given me
any flak about it."
She says she "definitely" plans
to tell her parents. Her siblings
already know, however.
Tracy says people should feel
comfortable talking about sexual
orientation. "I think if some
body's struggling with the issue or
thinking about the issue, they
should find somebody to talk to,
because keeping it inside is not
going to work."
• • •
Some Stanford gays and les
bians, like Tracy, are ready to
come out to their entire dorms
during freshman year.
Senior Horacio Tovar, who was
a resident assistant at Otero
House last year, remembers when
one of his freshmen came out to
the dorm.
"A gay man in a frosh dorm
usually will come out to the resi
dence staff or other [trustworthy]

people before coming out to the
entire group," says Tovar. "It's
kind of like testing the waters."
He says the residence staff
thought the dorm would be
accepting of the freshman's
homosexuality, so they advised
him to come out, which he did at a
dorm program. The residence
staff remained supportive of the
student.
According to Heming, coming
out to an entire community the
way Tracy did is like saying, "I
won't participate in the oppres
sion of myself and my group."
"A lot of (lesbian) women on
this campus feel a tremendous
responsibility to women who
aren't out," she says. "They want
to be visible and to be role models.
[These lesbians] want the women
who are struggling, who don't feel
good about themselves, to find
them."

Hayes says he chose to be
openly gay because he was "tired
of hiding it and compartmentaliz
ing" his life.
"For me, being gay is not some
thing which happens at certain
hours of the day,"he says. "I'm
always gay."
Junior Jake Veylupek, also
openly gay, calls coming out "a
never-ending process." Even peo
ple who have "been out in a large
way" can observe National Com
ing Out Day by taking a new step
in the process, he adds.
Shepodd says as more people
come out of the closet, "it is a little
safer every generation for young
gay and lesbian kids."
She emphasizes that her orga
nization is creating a day of pride.
"There's no reason in this world
for gay and lesbian people to feel
like there's something wrong with
them."
Senior Chris Hayes has been looking for
an excuse to tell his co-workers at Network
ing Services that he's gay Today, he has an
opportunity.
Today is National Coming Out Day,
when gays and lesbians across the country

at the Bridge on Sundays from 4
to 6 p.m.

Telling friends and family
"Mitch" doesn't have a
boyfriend. If he did, the freshman
says he'd like to go with him
"through the middle of the Quad
at 12 noon holding hands." But
even Mitch's freshman roommate
doesn't know Mitch is gay.
"[My roommate] would have
an absolute herd of cows if he ever
found out. He's made many sexist
and racist comments, and I'm
assuming the pattern follows to
homophobic reactions," says
Mitch.
Most of Mitch's friends are
women, and he's comfortable
telling many of them he's gay. "We
have fun with it,"he says with a
grin. "We'll go mall-hopping, and
we'll pick out guys."
But Mitch is hardly out of the
closet. He says he waits to develop
a "level of trust" with a given
group or individual before decid
ing to come out.
"A mayor obstacle in fully com
ing out is the potential loss of
friends and acquaintances," he
says. He is concerned about being
stereotyped and labeled as gay.
Some of Mitch's gay friends
think his attitude about being gay
is hypocritical. "I am very accept
ing and understanding of who I
am," he explains. "It's part of my
identity, and I embrace it as such.
[But] I'm not fully out of the
closet. I don't wear pink triangles
(symbolizing gay pride), and some
of my homosexual friends say that
that is why I am hypocritical."
Mitch has a message for gays
who are still in the closet: "Don't
repress the feelings that you have.
Stifling such emotions will only
succeed in slitting your own
wrists. If you have those feelings,
pursue them as far and as wide as
you feel comfortable."
But he adds a word of caution.
"Mainstream society can be
oppressive and sometimes violent
to people of our persuasion."
Mitch's father knows Mitch is
gay. "My dad is very open, accept
ing and very liberal." However,
Mitch complains his being gay has
become "a game for him of sorts.
He'll take a dig in me every once
in a while."
Because he feels his stepfather
is "prejudiced," Mitch has chosen
not to tell his mother he's gay. "I
know I really should tell my
Mom," he says, adding that he
thinks she'd be even more sympa
thetic than his father.
Although Mitch may not be

open enough yet about his sexual
orientation to act upon his fantasy
of walking through the Quad
hand in hand with his boyfriend,
he says he has no conflicts about
feeling gay.
He shrugs. "I'm happy with it."

Heming, from CAPS, explains
that coming out to friends is often
the first step for many students.
But, "on this campus the ante is
really high when coming out to
friends. .. . It's quite frighten
ing," she says.
Gay students like Mitch must
deal with such issues as whether
their friends will reject them,
"freak out" or talk behind their
backs, Heming notes.
Sometimes, even when friends
have none of these reactions, a
certain "awkwardness" remains
in a relationship, Heming says.
Heming would like to remind
students such as Mitch's room
mate that when they're making
homophobic jokes and comments,
"it's quite possible that one of
their [secretly homosexual]
friends may be listening and
thinking 'I'd really like to tell so
and-so, but look at what they're
saying.'"
She says students who aren't
open about their orientation with
their friends listen carefully and
make judgments about how safe it
is to tell them.
While telling friends is diffi
cult, "family is often the hardest
to come out to, especially par
ents," says Hayes. "Parents invest
a certain emotional commitment
into what their children d 0.... It
often comes as a shock and a dis
appointment."
Hayes says a lot of gays come
out to siblings before telling their
parents. Students of both sexes
often find it easier to tell sisters
than brothers, he notes.
"When people think about
coming out to their parents, they
go through a stage where they
have to process all their worst fan
tasies," Heming says. "But I'm
happy to say I have yet to find a
situation when it's backfired.
Oftentimes, it's not wonderful,
but it initiates a process of dia
logue between the parents and the
child."
She says gays and lesbians
often ask themselves what they
are losing by not sharing such an
important aspect of their lives
with their families. Many feel they
cannot be close without being
totally honest, she adds.

"More and more we're seeing
people choosing to come out to
their parents," Heming says.
Her entire junior year in high
school, "Tracy" couldn't stop
thinking about the possibility she
might be a lesbian.
She read a lot of books at the
library — gay fiction and books on
human sexuality. Then, the sum
mer before her senior year, she
saw a group of lesbian sorority
members on the talk show "Don
ahue."
"It just clicked in my mind that
that was what I'd been struggling
with," she says.
Tracy's first sexual experience
was with a close friend, a woman a
few years her senior. "It was an
enjoyable experience," she says.
"But I knew I was gay before
then. I had been out for five
months before I had even kissed a
woman."
Tracy came out at her high
school last spring and has been
openly lesbian except to her par
ents ever since.
"I was out the minute I hit
campus," she says. Tracy partici
pated in events at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center during Prospective Fresh
man Week in May and has already
come out to many people in her
dormitory. She even plans to par
ticipate in a gay speaker's bureau
program in her dorm later this
month.
Tracy, who wears a pink trian
gle everywhere she goes, says the
people in the dorm who know she
is lesbian have reacted very well.
"No one in my dorm has given me
any flak about it."
She says she "definitely" plans
to tell her parents. Her siblings
already know, however.
Tracy says people should feel
comfortable talking about sexual
orientation. "I think if some
body's struggling with the issue or
thinking about the issue, they
should find somebody to talk to,
because keeping it inside is not
going to work."
• • •
Some Stanford gays and les
bians, like Tracy, are ready to
come out to their entire dorms
during freshman year.
Senior Horacio Tovar, who was
a resident assistant at Otero
House last year, remembers when
one of his freshmen came out to
the dorm.
"A gay man in a frosh dorm
usually will come out to the resi
dence staff or other [trustworthy]

people before coming out to the
entire group," says Tovar. "It's
kind of like testing the waters."
He says the residence staff
thought the dorm would be
accepting of the freshman's
homosexuality, so they advised
him to come out, which he did at a
dorm program. The residence
staff remained supportive of the
student.
According to Heming, coming
out to an entire community the
way Tracy did is like saying, "I
won't participate in the oppres
sion of myself and my group."
"A lot of (lesbian) women on
this campus feel a tremendous
responsibility to women who
aren't out," she says. "They want
to be visible and to be role models.
[These lesbians] want the women
who are struggling, who don't feel
good about themselves, to find
them."

Hayes says he chose to be
openly gay because he was "tired
of hiding it and compartmentaliz
ing" his life.
"For me, being gay is not some
thing which happens at certain
hours of the day,"he says. "I'm
always gay."
Junior Jake Veylupek, also
openly gay, calls coming out "a
never-ending process." Even peo
ple who have "been out in a large
way" can observe National Com
ing Out Day by taking a new step
in the process, he adds.
Shepodd says as more people
come out of the closet, "it is a little
safer every generation for young
gay and lesbian kids."
She emphasizes that her orga
nization is creating a day of pride.
"There's no reason in this world
for gay and lesbian people to feel
like there's something wrong with
them."
Senior Chris Hayes has been looking for
an excuse to tell his co-workers at Network
ing Services that he's gay Today, he has an
opportunity.
Today is National Coming Out Day,
when gays and lesbians across the country
are taking steps of all kinds toward letting
others know about their sexuality.
"I've been wanting to do it for some
time," says Hayes, who is an officer of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center. "Sometimes I find it difficult... to
just come out without any pretext. [Today]
provides me a reason to do so."
The event encourages gays and lesbians

to take their "next step" toward coming out
to their family, friends, co-workers and leg
islators, according to Lynn Shepodd, execu
tive director of the third annual National
Coming Out Day. "We want the conversa
tion about coming out to begin every
where."
The Daily spoke with three undergradu
ates, of various ethnicities, who are at dif
ferent stages of the coming-out process.
Each is concerned about different issues —
from finding other gays, to telling friends
and family, to being openly gay in a non-gay
world.
Their stories are by no means represen
tative of the entire spectrum of coming out
experiences, but they capture some of the
emotions and ordeals gay and lesbian peo

pie on this campus confront.
Dealing with gay feelings
"Doug" was barely a teenager when he
saw the man in the next bathroom stall tap
his foot. Curious, he tapped his own foot
back, and before he knew it, the man had
gotten down on his knees and was caressing
Doug's leg.
Although he found his first sexual part
ner "basically by accident," Doug, now an
undergraduate, looks back at that incident
as the first time he was able to express his
lifelong attraction toward other men.
As Doug grew older, anonymous bath
room sex became an addiction.
Whenever he felt he could not "handle
it,"he recalls, the following scenario

ensued: "I go to this one bathroom and sit
in a stall. I tap my foot and wait to see if
they tap back, as a signal."
Typically Doug and the other man would
engage in mutual masturbation and occa
sionally oral sex underneath the stall.
Doug was swamped by emotions each
time he had an encounter. "I felt guilty,
ashamed, depressed — I was nervous,
scared of the danger, angry with myself. M
He came to Stanford assuming that the
gay community on a college campus would
be more open about sexuality and that he
could be accepted as a gay man for the first
time. He quickly sought counseling and
"came out" for the first time.

Talking about his gay feelings was
a big relief for Doug. "I just felt
happy about myself, that I had
opened up a part of me that had
been hidden."
Doug has tried to reconcile his
homosexuality with his family's
strict Mormon faith. "I find it a
real struggle being Mormon and
being gay."
At times, Doug's frustrations
have driven him "very close" to
attempting to kill himself. He says
suicide sometimes "seems like the
only way 0ut.... You have to keep
•yourself hidden and bottle up
your feelings — and they build up
in rages."
• • •
Trudie Heming, a lesbian psy
chologist at Counseling and Psy
chological Services, says it's not
unusual for students who come
from backgrounds that reject
homosexuality, like Doug, to feel
tremendous tension.
"I have known cases where the
individual Mormon parents, say,
have been very accepting of their
Mormon child," she says. "But
there's still that loss because the
greater group doesn't accept
homosexuality and has made it so
clear."
Heming says suicidal thoughts
accompanying coming out at first
are quite common to people whose
culture rejects homosexuality.
"That's why it's so important
that there be a gay, lesbian and
bisexual community that people
coming out can become part of to
counteract those feelings of
despair and isolation," she says.
Students dealing with sexual
issues often turn to the Bridge,
the peer counseling center, for a
sympathetic ear. According to
senior Ariel Lang, a staffer at the
Bridge, gay students often like to
talk to gay peer counselors
"because they have more familiar
ity with the issues."
However, all the counselors at
the Bridge have received training
in sexual issues, and Lang says
"anyone is able and willing to talk
about gay and lesbian issues."
The Bridge has at least one gay
male and one lesbian peer coun
selor available to talk to students
on the phone or in person. Also, a
"Coming-Out Rap Group" meets
at the Bridge on Sundays from 4
to 6 p.m.

Telling friends and family
"Mitch" doesn't have a
boyfriend. If he did, the freshman
says he'd like to go with him
"through the middle of the Quad

even Mitch's freshman roommate
doesn't know Mitch is gay.
"[My roommate] would have
an absolute herd of cows if he ever

and racist comments, and I'm

homophobic reactions," says
Mitch.

She says gays and lesbians
often ask themselves what they
are losing by not sharing such an
important aspect of their lives
with their families. Many feel they
cannot be close without being
totally honest, she adds.

"More and more we're seeing
people choosing to come out to
their parents," Heming says.
Her entire junior year in high
school, "Tracy" couldn't stop
thinking about the possibility she
might be a lesbian.
She read a lot of books at the
library — gay fiction and books on
human sexuality. Then, the sum
mer before her senior year, she
saw a group of lesbian sorority
members on the talk show "Don
ahue."
"It just clicked in my mind that
that was what I'd been struggling
with," she says.
Tracy's first sexual experience
was with a close friend, a woman a
few years her senior. "It was an
enjoyable experience," she says.
"But I knew I was gay before
then. I had been out for five
months before I had even kissed a
woman."
Tracy came out at her high
school last spring and has been
openly lesbian except to her par
ents ever since.
"I was out the minute I hit
campus," she says. Tracy partici
pated in events at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center during Prospective Fresh
man Week in May and has already
come out to many people in her
dormitory. She even plans to par
ticipate in a gay speaker's bureau
program in her dorm later this
month.
Tracy, who wears a pink trian
gle everywhere she goes, says the
people in the dorm who know she
is lesbian have reacted very well.
"No one in my dorm has given me
any flak about it."
She says she "definitely" plans
to tell her parents. Her siblings
already know, however.
Tracy says people should feel
comfortable talking about sexual
orientation. "I think if some
body's struggling with the issue or
thinking about the issue, they
should find somebody to talk to,
because keeping it inside is not
going to work."

Some Stanford gays and les
bians, like Tracy, are ready to
come out to their entire dorms
during freshman year.
Senior Horacio Tovar, who was
a resident assistant at Otero
House last year, remembers when
one of his freshmen came out to
the dorm.
"A gay man in a frosh dorm
usually will come out to the resi
dence staff or other [trustworthy]

people before coming out to the
entire group," says Tovar. "It's
kind of like testing the waters."
He says the residence staff
thought the dorm would be
accepting of the freshman's
homosexuality, so they advised
him to come out, which he did at a
dorm program. The residence
staff remained supportive of the
student.
According to Heming, coming
out to an entire community the
way Tracy did is like saying, "I
won't participate in the oppres
sion of myself and my group."
"A lot of (lesbian) women on
this campus feel a tremendous
responsibility to women who
aren't out," she says. "They want
to be visible and to be role models.
[These lesbians] want the women
who are struggling, who don't feel
good about themselves, to find
them."

Hayes says he chose to be
openly gay because he was "tired
of hiding it and compartmentaliz
ing" his life.
"For me, being gay is not some
thing which happens at certain
hours of the day,"he says. "I'm
always gay."
Junior Jake Veylupek, also
openly gay, calls coming out "a
never-ending process." Even peo
ple who have "been out in a large
way" can observe National Com
ing Out Day by taking a new step
in the process, he adds.
Shepodd says as more people
come out of the closet, "it is a little
safer every generation for young
gay and lesbian kids."
She emphasizes that her orga
nization is creating a day of pride.
"There's no reason in this world
for gay and lesbian people to feel
like there's something wrong with
them."
Senior Chris Hayes has been looking for
an excuse to tell his co-workers at Network
ing Services that he's gay Today, he has an
opportunity.
Today is National Coming Out Day,
when gays and lesbians across the country
are taking steps of all kinds toward letting
others know about their sexuality.
"I've been wanting to do it for some
time," says Hayes, who is an officer of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center. "Sometimes I find it difficult... to
just come out without any pretext. [Today]
provides me a reason to do so."
The event encourages gays and lesbians

to take their "next step" toward coming out
to their family, friends, co-workers and leg
islators, according to Lynn Shepodd, execu
tive director of the third annual National
Coming Out Day. "We want the conversa
tion about coming out to begin every
where."
The Daily spoke with three undergradu
ates, of various ethnicities, who are at dif
ferent stages of the coming-out process.
Each is concerned about different issues —
from finding other gays, to telling friends
and family, to being openly gay in a non-gay
world.
Their stories are by no means represen
tative of the entire spectrum of coming out
experiences, but they capture some of the
emotions and ordeals gay and lesbian peo

pie on this campus confront.
Dealing with gay feelings
"Doug" was barely a teenager when he
saw the man in the next bathroom stall tap
his foot. Curious, he tapped his own foot
back, and before he knew it, the man had
gotten down on his knees and was caressing
Doug's leg.
Although he found his first sexual part
ner "basically by accident," Doug, now an
undergraduate, looks back at that incident
as the first time he was able to express his
lifelong attraction toward other men.
As Doug grew older, anonymous bath
room sex became an addiction.
Whenever he felt he could not "handle
it,"he recalls, the following scenario

ensued: "I go to this one bathroom and sit
in a stall. I tap my foot and wait to see if
they tap back, as a signal."
Typically Doug and the other man would
engage in mutual masturbation and occa
sionally oral sex underneath the stall.
Doug was swamped by emotions each
time he had an encounter. "I felt guilty,
ashamed, depressed — I was nervous,
scared of the danger, angry with myself. M
He came to Stanford assuming that the
gay community on a college campus would
be more open about sexuality and that he
could be accepted as a gay man for the first
time. He quickly sought counseling and
"came out" for the first time.

Talking about his gay feelings was
a big relief for Doug. "I just felt
happy about myself, that I had
opened up a part of me that had
been hidden."
Doug has tried to reconcile his
homosexuality with his family's
strict Mormon faith. "I find it a
real struggle being Mormon and
being gay."
At times, Doug's frustrations
have driven him "very close" to
attempting to kill himself. He says
suicide sometimes "seems like the
only way 0ut.... You have to keep
•yourself hidden and bottle up
your feelings — and they build up
in rages."
• • •
Trudie Heming, a lesbian psy
chologist at Counseling and Psy
chological Services, says it's not
unusual for students who come
from backgrounds that reject
homosexuality, like Doug, to feel
tremendous tension.
"I have known cases where the
individual Mormon parents, say,
have been very accepting of their
Mormon child," she says. "But
there's still that loss because the
greater group doesn't accept
homosexuality and has made it so
clear."
Heming says suicidal thoughts
accompanying coming out at first
are quite common to people whose
culture rejects homosexuality.
"That's why it's so important
that there be a gay, lesbian and
bisexual community that people
coming out can become part of to
counteract those feelings of
despair and isolation," she says.
Students dealing with sexual
issues often turn to the Bridge,
the peer counseling center, for a
sympathetic ear. According to
senior Ariel Lang, a staffer at the
Bridge, gay students often like to
talk to gay peer counselors
"because they have more familiar
ity with the issues."
However, all the counselors at
the Bridge have received training
in sexual issues, and Lang says
"anyone is able and willing to talk
about gay and lesbian issues."
The Bridge has at least one gay
male and one lesbian peer coun
selor available to talk to students
on the phone or in person. Also, a
"Coming-Out Rap Group" meets
at the Bridge on Sundays from 4
to 6 p.m.

Telling friends and family
"Mitch" doesn't have a
boyfriend. If he did, the freshman
says he'd like to go with him
"through the middle of the Quad
at 12 noon holding hands." But
even Mitch's freshman roommate
doesn't know Mitch is gay.
"[My roommate] would have
an absolute herd of cows if he ever
found out. He's made many sexist
and racist comments, and I'm
assuming the pattern follows to
homophobic reactions," says
Mitch.
Most of Mitch's friends are
women, and he's comfortable
telling many of them he's gay. "We
have fun with it,"he says with a
grin. "We'll go mall-hopping, and
we'll pick out guys."
But Mitch is hardly out of the
closet. He says he waits to develop
a "level of trust" with a given
group or individual before decid
ing to come out.
"A mayor obstacle in fully com
ing out is the potential loss of
friends and acquaintances," he
says. He is concerned about being
stereotyped and labeled as gay.
Some of Mitch's gay friends
think his attitude about being gay
is hypocritical. "I am very accept
ing and understanding of who I
am," he explains. "It's part of my
identity, and I embrace it as such.
[But] I'm not fully out of the
closet. I don't wear pink triangles
(symbolizing gay pride), and some
of my homosexual friends say that
that is why I am hypocritical."
Mitch has a message for gays
who are still in the closet: "Don't
repress the feelings that you have.
Stifling such emotions will only
succeed in slitting your own
wrists. If you have those feelings,
pursue them as far and as wide as
you feel comfortable."
But he adds a word of caution.
"Mainstream society can be
oppressive and sometimes violent
to people of our persuasion."
Mitch's father knows Mitch is
gay. "My dad is very open, accept
ing and very liberal." However,
Mitch complains his being gay has
become "a game for him of sorts.
He'll take a dig in me every once
in a while."
Because he feels his stepfather
is "prejudiced," Mitch has chosen
not to tell his mother he's gay. "I
know I really should tell my
Mom," he says, adding that he
thinks she'd be even more sympa
thetic than his father.
Although Mitch may not be

open enough yet about his sexual
orientation to act upon his fantasy
of walking through the Quad
hand in hand with his boyfriend,
he says he has no conflicts about
feeling gay.
He shrugs. "I'm happy with it."
• • •
Heming, from CAPS, explains
that coming out to friends is often
the first step for many students.
But, "on this campus the ante is
really high when coming out to
friends. .. . It's quite frighten
ing," she says.
Gay students like Mitch must
deal with such issues as whether
their friends will reject them,
"freak out" or talk behind their
backs, Heming notes.
Sometimes, even when friends
have none of these reactions, a
certain "awkwardness" remains
in a relationship, Heming says.
Heming would like to remind
students such as Mitch's room
mate that when they're making
homophobic jokes and comments,
"it's quite possible that one of
their [secretly homosexual]
friends may be listening and
thinking 'I'd really like to tell so
and-so, but look at what they're
saying.'"
She says students who aren't
open about their orientation with
their friends listen carefully and
make judgments about how safe it
is to tell them.
While telling friends is diffi
cult, "family is often the hardest
to come out to, especially par
ents," says Hayes. "Parents invest
a certain emotional commitment
into what their children d 0.... It
often comes as a shock and a dis
appointment."
Hayes says a lot of gays come
out to siblings before telling their
parents. Students of both sexes
often find it easier to tell sisters
than brothers, he notes.
"When people think about
coming out to their parents, they
go through a stage where they
have to process all their worst fan
tasies," Heming says. "But I'm
happy to say I have yet to find a
situation when it's backfired.
Oftentimes, it's not wonderful,
but it initiates a process of dia
logue between the parents and the
child."
She says gays and lesbians
often ask themselves what they
are losing by not sharing such an
important aspect of their lives
with their families. Many feel they
cannot be close without being
totally honest, she adds.

"More and more we're seeing
people choosing to come out to

just come out without any pretext. [Today]
provides me a reason to do so."
The event encourages gays and lesbians

to take their "next step" toward coming out
to their family, friends, co-workers and leg
islators, according to Lynn Shepodd, execu
tive director of the third annual National
Coming Out Day. "We want the conversa
tion about coming out to begin every
where."
The Daily spoke with three undergradu
ates, of various ethnicities, who are at dif
ferent stages of the coming-out process.
Each is concerned about different issues —
from finding other gays, to telling friends
and family, to being openly gay in a non-gay
world.
Their stories are by no means represen
tative of the entire spectrum of coming out
experiences, but they capture some of the
emotions and ordeals gay and lesbian peo

pie on this campus confront.
Dealing with gay feelings
"Doug" was barely a teenager when he
saw the man in the next bathroom stall tap
his foot. Curious, he tapped his own foot
back, and before he knew it, the man had
gotten down on his knees and was caressing
Doug's leg.
Although he found his first sexual part
ner "basically by accident," Doug, now an
undergraduate, looks back at that incident
as the first time he was able to express his
lifelong attraction toward other men.
As Doug grew older, anonymous bath
room sex became an addiction.
Whenever he felt he could not "handle
it,"he recalls, the following scenario

ensued: "I go to this one bathroom and sit
in a stall. I tap my foot and wait to see if
they tap back, as a signal."
Typically Doug and the other man would
engage in mutual masturbation and occa
sionally oral sex underneath the stall.
Doug was swamped by emotions each
time he had an encounter. "I felt guilty,
ashamed, depressed — I was nervous,
scared of the danger, angry with myself. M
He came to Stanford assuming that the
gay community on a college campus would
be more open about sexuality and that he
could be accepted as a gay man for the first
time. He quickly sought counseling and
"came out" for the first time.

Talking about his gay feelings was
a big relief for Doug. "I just felt
happy about myself, that I had
opened up a part of me that had
been hidden."
Doug has tried to reconcile his
homosexuality with his family's
strict Mormon faith. "I find it a
real struggle being Mormon and
being gay."
At times, Doug's frustrations
have driven him "very close" to
attempting to kill himself. He says
suicide sometimes "seems like the
only way 0ut.... You have to keep
•yourself hidden and bottle up
your feelings — and they build up
in rages."
• • •
Trudie Heming, a lesbian psy
chologist at Counseling and Psy
chological Services, says it's not
unusual for students who come
from backgrounds that reject
homosexuality, like Doug, to feel
tremendous tension.
"I have known cases where the
individual Mormon parents, say,
have been very accepting of their
Mormon child," she says. "But
there's still that loss because the
greater group doesn't accept
homosexuality and has made it so
clear."
Heming says suicidal thoughts
accompanying coming out at first
are quite common to people whose
culture rejects homosexuality.
"That's why it's so important
that there be a gay, lesbian and
bisexual community that people
coming out can become part of to
counteract those feelings of
despair and isolation," she says.
Students dealing with sexual
issues often turn to the Bridge,
the peer counseling center, for a
sympathetic ear. According to
senior Ariel Lang, a staffer at the
Bridge, gay students often like to
talk to gay peer counselors
"because they have more familiar
ity with the issues."
However, all the counselors at
the Bridge have received training
in sexual issues, and Lang says
"anyone is able and willing to talk
about gay and lesbian issues."
The Bridge has at least one gay
male and one lesbian peer coun
selor available to talk to students
on the phone or in person. Also, a
"Coming-Out Rap Group" meets
at the Bridge on Sundays from 4
to 6 p.m.

Telling friends and family
"Mitch" doesn't have a
boyfriend. If he did, the freshman
says he'd like to go with him
"through the middle of the Quad
at 12 noon holding hands." But
even Mitch's freshman roommate
doesn't know Mitch is gay.
"[My roommate] would have
an absolute herd of cows if he ever
found out. He's made many sexist
and racist comments, and I'm
assuming the pattern follows to
homophobic reactions," says
Mitch.
Most of Mitch's friends are
women, and he's comfortable
telling many of them he's gay. "We
have fun with it,"he says with a
grin. "We'll go mall-hopping, and
we'll pick out guys."
But Mitch is hardly out of the
closet. He says he waits to develop
a "level of trust" with a given
group or individual before decid
ing to come out.
"A mayor obstacle in fully com
ing out is the potential loss of
friends and acquaintances," he
says. He is concerned about being
stereotyped and labeled as gay.
Some of Mitch's gay friends
think his attitude about being gay
is hypocritical. "I am very accept
ing and understanding of who I
am," he explains. "It's part of my
identity, and I embrace it as such.
[But] I'm not fully out of the
closet. I don't wear pink triangles
(symbolizing gay pride), and some
of my homosexual friends say that
that is why I am hypocritical."
Mitch has a message for gays
who are still in the closet: "Don't
repress the feelings that you have.
Stifling such emotions will only
succeed in slitting your own
wrists. If you have those feelings,
pursue them as far and as wide as
you feel comfortable."
But he adds a word of caution.
"Mainstream society can be
oppressive and sometimes violent
to people of our persuasion."
Mitch's father knows Mitch is
gay. "My dad is very open, accept
ing and very liberal." However,
Mitch complains his being gay has
become "a game for him of sorts.
He'll take a dig in me every once
in a while."
Because he feels his stepfather
is "prejudiced," Mitch has chosen
not to tell his mother he's gay. "I
know I really should tell my
Mom," he says, adding that he
thinks she'd be even more sympa
thetic than his father.
Although Mitch may not be

open enough yet about his sexual
orientation to act upon his fantasy
of walking through the Quad
hand in hand with his boyfriend,
he says he has no conflicts about
feeling gay.
He shrugs. "I'm happy with it."

Heming, from CAPS, explains
that coming out to friends is often
the first step for many students.
But, "on this campus the ante is
really high when coming out to
friends. .. . It's quite frighten
ing," she says.
Gay students like Mitch must
deal with such issues as whether
their friends will reject them,
"freak out" or talk behind their
backs, Heming notes.
Sometimes, even when friends
have none of these reactions, a
certain "awkwardness" remains
in a relationship, Heming says.
Heming would like to remind
students such as Mitch's room
mate that when they're making
homophobic jokes and comments,
"it's quite possible that one of
their [secretly homosexual]
friends may be listening and
thinking 'I'd really like to tell so
and-so, but look at what they're
saying.'"
She says students who aren't
open about their orientation with
their friends listen carefully and
make judgments about how safe it
is to tell them.
While telling friends is diffi
cult, "family is often the hardest
to come out to, especially par
ents," says Hayes. "Parents invest
a certain emotional commitment
into what their children d 0.... It
often comes as a shock and a dis
appointment."
Hayes says a lot of gays come
out to siblings before telling their
parents. Students of both sexes
often find it easier to tell sisters
than brothers, he notes.
"When people think about
coming out to their parents, they
go through a stage where they
have to process all their worst fan
tasies," Heming says. "But I'm
happy to say I have yet to find a
situation when it's backfired.
Oftentimes, it's not wonderful,
but it initiates a process of dia
logue between the parents and the
child."
She says gays and lesbians
often ask themselves what they
are losing by not sharing such an
important aspect of their lives
with their families. Many feel they
cannot be close without being
totally honest, she adds.

"More and more we're seeing
people choosing to come out to
their parents," Heming says.
Her entire junior year in high
school, "Tracy" couldn't stop
thinking about the possibility she
might be a lesbian.
She read a lot of books at the
library — gay fiction and books on
human sexuality. Then, the sum
mer before her senior year, she
saw a group of lesbian sorority
members on the talk show "Don
ahue."
"It just clicked in my mind that
that was what I'd been struggling
with," she says.
Tracy's first sexual experience
was with a close friend, a woman a
few years her senior. "It was an
enjoyable experience," she says.
"But I knew I was gay before
then. I had been out for five
months before I had even kissed a
woman."
Tracy came out at her high
school last spring and has been
openly lesbian except to her par
ents ever since.
"I was out the minute I hit
campus," she says. Tracy partici
pated in events at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center during Prospective Fresh
man Week in May and has already
come out to many people in her
dormitory. She even plans to par
ticipate in a gay speaker's bureau
program in her dorm later this
month.
Tracy, who wears a pink trian
gle everywhere she goes, says the
people in the dorm who know she
is lesbian have reacted very well.
"No one in my dorm has given me
any flak about it."
She says she "definitely" plans
to tell her parents. Her siblings
already know, however.
Tracy says people should feel
comfortable talking about sexual
orientation. "I think if some
body's struggling with the issue or
thinking about the issue, they
should find somebody to talk to,
because keeping it inside is not
going to work."
• • •
Some Stanford gays and les
bians, like Tracy, are ready to
come out to their entire dorms
during freshman year.
Senior Horacio Tovar, who was
a resident assistant at Otero
House last year, remembers when
one of his freshmen came out to
the dorm.
"A gay man in a frosh dorm
usually will come out to the resi
dence staff or other [trustworthy]

people before coming out to the
entire group," says Tovar. "It's
kind of like testing the waters."
He says the residence staff
thought the dorm would be
accepting of the freshman's
homosexuality, so they advised
him to come out, which he did at a
dorm program. The residence
staff remained supportive of the
student.
According to Heming, coming
out to an entire community the
way Tracy did is like saying, "I
won't participate in the oppres
sion of myself and my group."
"A lot of (lesbian) women on
this campus feel a tremendous
responsibility to women who
aren't out," she says. "They want
to be visible and to be role models.
[These lesbians] want the women
who are struggling, who don't feel
good about themselves, to find
them."

Hayes says he chose to be
openly gay because he was "tired
of hiding it and compartmentaliz
ing" his life.
"For me, being gay is not some
thing which happens at certain
hours of the day,"he says. "I'm
always gay."
Junior Jake Veylupek, also
openly gay, calls coming out "a
never-ending process." Even peo
ple who have "been out in a large
way" can observe National Com
ing Out Day by taking a new step
in the process, he adds.
Shepodd says as more people
come out of the closet, "it is a little
safer every generation for young
gay and lesbian kids."
She emphasizes that her orga
nization is creating a day of pride.
"There's no reason in this world
for gay and lesbian people to feel
like there's something wrong with
them."
Senior Chris Hayes has been looking for
an excuse to tell his co-workers at Network
ing Services that he's gay Today, he has an
opportunity.
Today is National Coming Out Day,
when gays and lesbians across the country
are taking steps of all kinds toward letting
others know about their sexuality.
"I've been wanting to do it for some
time," says Hayes, who is an officer of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center. "Sometimes I find it difficult... to
just come out without any pretext. [Today]
provides me a reason to do so."
The event encourages gays and lesbians

to take their "next step" toward coming out
to their family, friends, co-workers and leg
islators, according to Lynn Shepodd, execu
tive director of the third annual National

doesn't know Mitch is gay.
