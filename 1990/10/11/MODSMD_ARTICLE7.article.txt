# Taking the next step: being openly gay in a non-gay world
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Senior Chris Hayes has been looking for
an excuse to tell his co-workers at Network
ing Services that he's gay Today, he has an
opportunity.
Today is National Coming Out Day,
when gays and lesbians across the country
are taking steps of all kinds toward letting
others know about their sexuality.
"I've been wanting to do it for some
time," says Hayes, who is an officer of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center. "Sometimes I find it difficult... to
just come out without any pretext. [Today]
provides me a reason to do so."
The event encourages gays and lesbians

to take their "next step" toward coming out
to their family, friends, co-workers and leg
islators, according to Lynn Shepodd, execu
tive director of the third annual National
Coming Out Day. "We want the conversa
tion about coming out to begin every
where."
The Daily spoke with three undergradu
ates, of various ethnicities, who are at dif
ferent stages of the coming-out process.
Each is concerned about different issues —
from finding other gays, to telling friends
and family, to being openly gay in a non-gay
world.
Their stories are by no means represen
tative of the entire spectrum of coming out
experiences, but they capture some of the
emotions and ordeals gay and lesbian peo

pie on this campus confront.
Dealing with gay feelings
"Doug" was barely a teenager when he
saw the man in the next bathroom stall tap
his foot. Curious, he tapped his own foot
back, and before he knew it, the man had
gotten down on his knees and was caressing
Doug's leg.
Although he found his first sexual part
ner "basically by accident," Doug, now an
undergraduate, looks back at that incident
as the first time he was able to express his
lifelong attraction toward other men.
As Doug grew older, anonymous bath
room sex became an addiction.
Whenever he felt he could not "handle
it,"he recalls, the following scenario

ensued: "I go to this one bathroom and sit
in a stall. I tap my foot and wait to see if
they tap back, as a signal."
Typically Doug and the other man would
engage in mutual masturbation and occa
sionally oral sex underneath the stall.
Doug was swamped by emotions each
time he had an encounter. "I felt guilty,
ashamed, depressed — I was nervous,
scared of the danger, angry with myself. M
He came to Stanford assuming that the
gay community on a college campus would
be more open about sexuality and that he
could be accepted as a gay man for the first
time. He quickly sought counseling and
"came out" for the first time.
