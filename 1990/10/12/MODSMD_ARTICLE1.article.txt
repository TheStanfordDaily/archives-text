# Major restructuring of administration announced
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In an address to the Faculty
Senate yesterday, Provost James
Rosse unveiled sweeping changes
in Stanford's administrative
structure.
Beginning next week, a Univer
sity Cabinet will advise the presi
dent. Soon, there will be no vice
provosts. By this time next year,
there will no longer be a dean of
undergraduate studies.
And that's just part of the plan.
The changes are intended both
to streamline the University's
bureaucracy in a period of budget
cutting, and to more closely align
the University's management
structure with its academic mis
sion.
"Our intention is to bring the

institution back to its central aca
demic purpose," Rosse said. "The
old model had broken down."
In keeping with Stanford's
renewed commitment to its aca
demic mission, Rosse said, deans
of the seven Stanford schools will
be given an unprecedented role in
setting priorities and advising the
president on matters of Univer
sity policy. Until now, such
responsibilities fell on shoulders
of the vice presidents, he said.
The restructuring is effectively
"an inversion of the old order"
with respect to deans and vice
presidents, he explained. "It's a
rather dramatic change."
Giving the deans more say in
University policy is necessary to
make sure Stanford keeps focused
on its academic objectives, Rosse
said in an interview before the

address. "If you
put the deans in
charge," he said,
"you're going to
keep your eye on
the ball."
The role of the
vice presidents
will now be more
explicitly defined
by the support

services they provide, Rosse said.
After the elimination of some vice
presidencies, the addition of sev
eral others, and the renaming of a
position or two, Stanford will have
nine vice presidents.
They will oversee the following
areas: administrative resources,
development, general counsel,
human resources, libraries and
information resources, planning
and management, public affairs,

student resources and the Medical
School.
Rosse himself will drop the title
of vice president from his job
description. Until this year, he
was vice president and provost.
Now he is the provost and will
work more closely in a "partner
ship" with University President
Donald Kennedy to guide the Uni
versity. His position will be similar
to that of a chief operating officer
of a corporation, he said.
Some of the personnel restruc
turing had already begun. The
appointment last spring of Sally
Mahoney to the new position of
vice president for student
resources, for example, repre
sented one of the early changes in
the administrative structure.


Rosse
She effectively replaced the
retiring Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, but also took on sev
eral other functions as well.
Some administrators will effec
tively do the same job, but their
titles will change. The "vice
provost and director of planning
and management" will become
the "vice president for planning
and management." The "director
of personnel services" will become
the "vice president for human
resources."
At the heart of the new model
are two new advisory bodies to the
president: the University Cabinet
and the Operations Council.
The cabinet, chaired by
Kennedy and comprised primarily
of the deans of Stanford's seven
schools, will advise the president
on matters of University policy
and planning. The council,
chaired by Rosse and made up of
Stanford's vice presidents, will
coordinate the implementation of
the University's support services,
Rosse said.
While both the cabinet and
council are by definition advisory
bodies with no formal decision
making power, they will certainly
have "considerable influence" on
the president's actions, Rosse said
in an interview.
The cabinet will meet for the
first time next Wednesday.
Through their role in the aca
demic cabinet, deans as a group
will be given responsibility for
teaching, Rosse said. Because of
that development, the administra
tive level positions of dean of
undergraduate studies and dean

of graduate studies are no longer
needed, he said. These two posi
tions will be eliminated by next
fall.
Depending upon the issues
being discussed, a vice president
may be invited to attend a cabinet
meeting, and vice-versa, Rosse
said.
The crossover will provide "the
benefit of cross-fertilization," he
said, but also will blur somewhat
the distinction between the two

bodies.
While the goals of the cabinet
and council are distinct in the
abstract, Rosse said, making sure
the two bodies remain separate in
practice will be a difficult task.
"It's going to be hard to work that
out," he said.
But Rosse is banking quite a bit
on the success of the cabinet and
council — and on the success of
the restructuring efforts as a
whole. "If it doesn't work, we're

back in the business of budget
cutting," he said.
Rosse said he will know if the
new management structure is
working about a year from now.
Visible results will probably take
three to five years to surface, he
said. ,
The dramatic changes in struc
ture are unlikely to have an imme
diate impact on most students,
Rosse said. However, he added, in
the long run, the changes should

yield better educational programs
and more efficiently-run student
services.
Also, Rosse said, the restruc
turing should eventually reduce
the frustration for students wish
ing to offer input into the Univer
sity decision-making process. The

new structure should be much
more "transparent," Rosse said.
The restructuring plans were
the result of months of consulta
tion with administrators in the
University and business school
professors here and at other uni
versities.

tively do the same job, but their
titles will change. The "vice
provost and director of planning
and management" will become
the "vice president for planning
and management." The "director
of personnel services" will become
the "vice president for human
resources."
At the heart of the new model
are two new advisory bodies to the
president: the University Cabinet
and the Operations Council.
The cabinet, chaired by
Kennedy and comprised primarily
of the deans of Stanford's seven
schools, will advise the president
on matters of University policy
and planning. The council,
chaired by Rosse and made up of
Stanford's vice presidents, will
coordinate the implementation of
the University's support services,
Rosse said.
While both the cabinet and
council are by definition advisory
bodies with no formal decision
making power, they will certainly
have "considerable influence" on
the president's actions, Rosse said
in an interview.
The cabinet will meet for the
first time next Wednesday.
Through their role in the aca
demic cabinet, deans as a group
will be given responsibility for
teaching, Rosse said. Because of
that development, the administra
tive level positions of dean of
undergraduate studies and dean

of graduate studies are no longer
needed, he said. These two posi
tions will be eliminated by next
fall.
Depending upon the issues
being discussed, a vice president
may be invited to attend a cabinet
meeting, and vice-versa, Rosse
said.
The crossover will provide "the
benefit of cross-fertilization," he
said, but also will blur somewhat
the distinction between the two

bodies.
While the goals of the cabinet
and council are distinct in the
abstract, Rosse said, making sure
the two bodies remain separate in
practice will be a difficult task.
"It's going to be hard to work that
out," he said.
But Rosse is banking quite a bit
on the success of the cabinet and
council — and on the success of
the restructuring efforts as a
whole. "If it doesn't work, we're

back in the business of budget
cutting," he said.
Rosse said he will know if the
new management structure is
working about a year from now.
Visible results will probably take
three to five years to surface, he
said. ,
The dramatic changes in struc
ture are unlikely to have an imme
diate impact on most students,
Rosse said. However, he added, in
the long run, the changes should

yield better educational programs
and more efficiently-run student
services.
Also, Rosse said, the restruc
turing should eventually reduce
the frustration for students wish
ing to offer input into the Univer
sity decision-making process. The

new structure should be much
more "transparent," Rosse said.
The restructuring plans were
the result of months of consulta
tion with administrators in the
University and business school
professors here and at other uni
versities.

In an address to the Faculty
Senate yesterday, Provost James
Rosse unveiled sweeping changes
in Stanford's administrative
structure.
Beginning next week, a Univer
sity Cabinet will advise the presi
dent. Soon, there will be no vice
provosts. By this time next year,
there will no longer be a dean of
undergraduate studies.
And that's just part of the plan.
The changes are intended both
to streamline the University's
bureaucracy in a period of budget
cutting, and to more closely align
the University's management
structure with its academic mis
sion.
"Our intention is to bring the

institution back to its central aca
demic purpose," Rosse said. "The
old model had broken down."
In keeping with Stanford's
renewed commitment to its aca
demic mission, Rosse said, deans
of the seven Stanford schools will
be given an unprecedented role in
setting priorities and advising the
president on matters of Univer
sity policy. Until now, such
responsibilities fell on shoulders
of the vice presidents, he said.
The restructuring is effectively
"an inversion of the old order"
with respect to deans and vice
presidents, he explained. "It's a
rather dramatic change."
Giving the deans more say in
University policy is necessary to
make sure Stanford keeps focused
on its academic objectives, Rosse
said in an interview before the

address. "If you
put the deans in
charge," he said,
"you're going to
keep your eye on
the ball."
The role of the
vice presidents
will now be more
explicitly defined
by the support

services they provide, Rosse said.
After the elimination of some vice
presidencies, the addition of sev
eral others, and the renaming of a
position or two, Stanford will have
nine vice presidents.
They will oversee the following
areas: administrative resources,
development, general counsel,
human resources, libraries and
information resources, planning
and management, public affairs,

student resources and the Medical
School.
Rosse himself will drop the title
of vice president from his job
description. Until this year, he
was vice president and provost.
Now he is the provost and will
work more closely in a "partner
ship" with University President
Donald Kennedy to guide the Uni
versity. His position will be similar
to that of a chief operating officer
of a corporation, he said.
Some of the personnel restruc
turing had already begun. The
appointment last spring of Sally
Mahoney to the new position of
vice president for student
resources, for example, repre
sented one of the early changes in
the administrative structure.


Rosse
She effectively replaced the
retiring Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, but also took on sev
eral other functions as well.
Some administrators will effec
tively do the same job, but their
titles will change. The "vice

and management" will become
the "vice president for planning
