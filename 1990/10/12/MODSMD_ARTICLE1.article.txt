# Major restructuring of administration announced
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In an address to the Faculty
Senate yesterday, Provost James
Rosse unveiled sweeping changes
in Stanford's administrative
structure.
Beginning next week, a Univer
sity Cabinet will advise the presi
dent. Soon, there will be no vice
provosts. By this time next year,
there will no longer be a dean of
undergraduate studies.
And that's just part of the plan.
The changes are intended both
to streamline the University's
bureaucracy in a period of budget
cutting, and to more closely align
the University's management
structure with its academic mis
sion.
"Our intention is to bring the

institution back to its central aca
demic purpose," Rosse said. "The
old model had broken down."
In keeping with Stanford's
renewed commitment to its aca
demic mission, Rosse said, deans
of the seven Stanford schools will
be given an unprecedented role in
setting priorities and advising the
president on matters of Univer
sity policy. Until now, such
responsibilities fell on shoulders
of the vice presidents, he said.
The restructuring is effectively
"an inversion of the old order"
with respect to deans and vice
presidents, he explained. "It's a
rather dramatic change."
Giving the deans more say in
University policy is necessary to
make sure Stanford keeps focused
on its academic objectives, Rosse
said in an interview before the

address. "If you
put the deans in
charge," he said,
"you're going to
keep your eye on
the ball."
The role of the
vice presidents
will now be more
explicitly defined
by the support

services they provide, Rosse said.
After the elimination of some vice
presidencies, the addition of sev
eral others, and the renaming of a
position or two, Stanford will have
nine vice presidents.
They will oversee the following
areas: administrative resources,
development, general counsel,
human resources, libraries and
information resources, planning
and management, public affairs,

student resources and the Medical
School.
Rosse himself will drop the title
of vice president from his job
description. Until this year, he
was vice president and provost.
Now he is the provost and will
work more closely in a "partner
ship" with University President
Donald Kennedy to guide the Uni
versity. His position will be similar
to that of a chief operating officer
of a corporation, he said.
Some of the personnel restruc
turing had already begun. The
appointment last spring of Sally
Mahoney to the new position of
vice president for student
resources, for example, repre
sented one of the early changes in
the administrative structure.
