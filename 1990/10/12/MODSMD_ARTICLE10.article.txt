# Bike thieves hit Flo Mo
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Florence Moore Hall has been the tar
get of repeated thefts of bikes and bike
parts in the past two weeks, according to
a number of residents who have had
their bikes stolen or vandalized.
"Three bikes have been vandalized in
the past three nights" in front of the Flo
Mo office, said Eric Lassen, a resident
assistant at Alondra. He added that
there have been about five incidents
involving either bike theft or vandaliza
tion since the beginning of school.
Freshman Mike Mcßeynolds locked
his frame and front tire to a rack
Wednesday evening. The following
morning, he discovered part of his bike
was stolen.
"They broke the bike chain, took the
rear wheel, and took the seat and seat
post," Mcßeynolds said. "They also cut
the front tire which didn't do them any
good."
Mcßeynolds estimated it will cost
him $200 to replace the stolen parts.
That same evening Mcßeynolds* dor
mmate, Brooke Cowan, had her moun
tain bike stolen. "I locked my bike up
with two Kryptonite locks. There are a
lot of quick release things on the bike,
and I locked all of them up, too."
"They snipped all the cables that con
nect the handlebars to the brakes and
stole the handlebars," Cowan said. She

added it will cost about $185 to fix the
components and replace the stolen
parts.
"Older bikes that weren't even locked
to anything" were not touched, and it
was primarily the newer mountain bikes
that were stolen, according to Cowan.
According to Lassen, one of the resi
dents heard a lot of noise late Wednes
day night, but he wasn't sure whether
this was related to the thefts. He sug
gested Flo Mo might be a target because
it is centrally located on campus.
Freshman Seeta Badrinath also had
her bike stolen iast weekend. "I locked
it up, and Monday morning it was gone."
The bike was worth $550 and was one
year old.
Badrinath reported the incident to
the police but was discouraged by their
response. "The police took a report, gave
me some sympathy, and didn't even say
they're going to look for it."
"All they're doing is sending me a
copy of the report," Badrinath said.
According to Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer, the police "take a report and
get as much information on the bike as
possible."
The serial number is then entered
into a statewide computer, Niemeyer
said.
If students have a suspect, there may
be a follow up, but generally, there is
very little the police can do, Niemeyer
said.
