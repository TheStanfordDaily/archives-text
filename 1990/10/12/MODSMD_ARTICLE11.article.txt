# Housing deposit system eliminated
## Students will start receiving refunds on deposits in early December 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
Stanford students can stop grum
bling about a least one fee that is no
longer being charged by the University
— the $100 housing deposit charged to
new students.
As part of University-wide budget
cuts, tne Stanford Housing Center is
trimming its budget by eliminating the
housing deposit system, a feature of on
campus housing for years.
Beginning this fall, the Housing Cen
ter stopped collecting the $100 deposit
from all entering students; in early
December, the Center will begin refund
ing deposits currently on file.
The new policy will benefit everyone,
according to Asst. Director William
George. The center, George explained,
needed to cut about 16 percent of its
total budget.
This forced streamlining and cutting
back throughout the office. Because the
deposit system was "not necessary to
management of a housing system," the
center's staff decided to eliminate it
entirely.
Charging deposits are standard prac
tice in housing rental, primarily as a
way of assuring payment for damages
and extra cleaning. The system was
somewhat superfluous on campus, how
ever, since the University can bill stu
dents directly for damages or cleaning

The old system was super
fluous since the University
has the option of billing
students directly for dam
ages or cleaning costs.

costs, unlike a normal landlord.
Until this year, each entering student
was required to pay the deposit to live
in a University residence.
Students were then reminded by the
center to request reimbursement of the
deposit; the money was refunded in full
unless there were outstanding damage
or cleaning bills, which would then be
deducted from that money
The process was complicated and
time consuming, George said. It
involved verifying each student's status
with regard to outstanding bills for
damage, collecting payment and — if
the student's account was clear — writ
ing and distributing a check to each stu
dent. Under the new policy, the last step
is unnecessary.
Elimination of the deposit system is
expected to save time as well as money,
comprising nearly one-third of the bud
get cut for the center.
The savings result primarily from the
elimination of the position of deposit

system coordinator. Costs reductions for
maintenance of the requisite computer!
files, processing and storage are also
included, according to George.
Moreover, the move will save work in
the Bursar's and Controller's offices,;
which were involved in the previous sys- j
tem by checking bills and issuing
refunds.
George also noted that the change
will free up precious time during the
center's busiest period, Spring Quarter.
In past years, the center has had to coor
dinate the collection of nearly 3,000
deposits while dealing with refunds to
students and the housing lottery.
Students will benefit from the deci- J
sion as well. Entering students will have J
one less bill to pay, and current students \
can use the money to defer other costs of |
Stanford life.
Formal letters describing the new [
policy and refund procedures will be ;
mailed to students Oct. 15. Most stu-1
dents will receive a credit on their Uni
versity bill for Winter Quarter.
Students who will not be in Univer
sity housing in the Winter or who have a
valid reason for not receiving credit can
request refunds in the form of a check.
Some students — such as fraternity
residents — may not have paid deposits
or may have already received refunds.
Local residence offices will have infor
mation regarding the status of each stu
dent's account.
