# Bush gives up on budget talks

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House said yesterday although Presi
dent Bush would accept higher taxes on
the wealthiest Americans in exchange
for a deep cut in capital gains rates, he
prefers a deficit-cutting agreement that
omits both elements.
Caught in another day of budget con
fusion, Bush said he would not pursue
the tax trade in negotiations with the
House and Senate over a package of
spending cuts and tax increases
totalling $500 billion over five years.
"I think it's a waste of time because I
just don't think it can get through both
houses of Congress," Bush said of the
proposal.
There was no immediate reaction
from congressional Democrats.
The developments seemed to compli
cate efforts to draft the budget accord
before Oct. 19, when the government
faces the prospect of a shutdown in non
essential services.
Bush held a morning session at the
White House with GOP lawmakers.
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, emerging
from the meeting, suggested Bush had
decided on a strategy of seeking a pack
age of capital gains tax cuts combined

with a modest boost in income tax rates
for the wealthy. Bush had floated that
very idea at a news conference Tuesday
but then appeared to back away under
pressure from Republican senators.
Today, Archer said Bush expressed
unequivocal support for the package
again. But then the White House made
clear that the plan touted by Archer was
not the one that Bush would pursue.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater offered a candid explanation
for the confusion of the past two days.
"One of the phenomena of group meet
ings (between the President and law
makers) is people hear what they want
to hear."
The press spokesman apologized for
letting confusion reign for the past two
days. "I think we just made a mistake"
in not clearing things up.
Under the plan advocated by Archer,
the top income tax rate would be raised
for about 500,000 of the nation's
wealthiest taxpayers. The rate would be
lowered for about 4.5 million who earn
slightly less, he said. The tax on capital
gains would be cut for all who make
profits on the sale of stocks, real estate
and other investments.

Bush's new tax policy faced an uncer
tain reception in Congress, where many
Republicans philosophically oppose any
increase in tax rates, and some
Democrats are reluctant cut the capital
gains tax.
Richard Darman, White House bud
get director, said Republicans had pro
posed a hike in tax rates for the wealthy
during budget negotiations last month,
but said it was rejected by the
Democrats.
Under the proposal, the marginal tax
rate on the wealthiest Americans would
be raised from 28 percent to 31 percent,
but only if Congress lowers the capital
gains rate to 15 percent.
The White House statement said
Bush had authorized his budget nego
tiators to explore such an option more
than a month ago â€” even though today
was the first time it has surfaced.
The statement said that, while Bush
still supported the plan, he was afraid
that its formal presentation at this time
could actually lead to Democratic action
to raise the top tax rates to 33 percent.
"I will not tolerate ... raising rates
to 33 percent," Bush was quoted by
Fitzwater as saying.
