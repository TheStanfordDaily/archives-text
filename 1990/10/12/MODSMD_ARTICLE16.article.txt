# East German spies arrested

BERLIN (AP) — Former spies for East Germany
have handed over information about top-secret mili
tary projects in West Germany, including the devel
opment of the Tornado fighter jet, officials said yes
terday.
The new disclosures followed the arrest
Wednesday of eight alleged spies. For a people accus
tomed to wild tales of Cold War espionage in their
own backyards, the reports are causing some extra
head-shaking across the recently united Germany.
The alleged Communist East German spies
include a 63-year-old woman, her son and daughter
in-law.
The espionage activities stretch back to the 1960s
and the era of highest tensions between East and
West.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has
appealed to former East German spies to come in
from the cold, and it is speculated they could face
lighter prison terms for doing so.
Kohl, however, warned in an interview that the
legacy of the East German spy service must not "poi
son our nation's atmosphere."
"We must in no way open up a witch-hunt, but
protect our capacity for reconciliation," the
Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper quoted Kohl as
saying.
Earlier this week, Germans learned that the same
top secret intelligence summaries that reached
Kohl's desk each week wound up in Communist East
Germany's spy headquarters.
Klaus Kuron, a top spy, quickly started naming
names after turning himself in to authorities
Sunday. That led to the arrest of the eight spies
whose crimes were outlined by the chief federal pros
ecutor's office yesterday.
Interior Ministry spokesman Willi Hausmann
said Kuron was offered entry into the Soviet Union
by the KGB just before surrending, but the Soviets
offer "did not appear lucrative to him," so he turned
himself in instead.
One of the eight arrested, identified only as
Karlheinz S., allegedly passed on directly to the
Soviet KGB information about a new tank under
development, the chief federal prosecutor said.
No one knows when the latest round of arrests
and disclosures will stop. An official said there is a
pool of 8,000 former East German spies to pick from
in the coming months, and that more developments
are expected.
