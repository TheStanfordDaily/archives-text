system ot government inspired Nelson Mandela to
suspend the African National Congress' armed
struggle against the government.
Since then, however, there has been an explosion
of violence in black townshios around

Johannesburg, resulting in approximately eight hundred killings.
Among several factors that could have contributed to this out
burst of attacks is the notion of power struggle among political
leaders, suggested Political Science Prof. David Abernethy.
Negotiations between de Klerk and the ANC must necessarily
leave leaders of groups on both sides feeling ignored or "sold out,"
he said.

Other non-integrationalist parties also in contention for power
include the Pan-African Congress, the Conservative Party, and
the unofficial Afrikaaner Resistance Movement, Abernathy
added.
Thomas Henriksen, associate director and senior fellow of the
Hoover Institution, cited historical animosities as a cause for the
recent violence.
While the majority of national black political groups are not
organized along ethnic lines, "much of African politics is in fact
ethnic politics," he asserted.
Abernethy, on the other hand, warned that the United States
media have over-simplified a complex situation and exaggerated
the significance of the ethnic factor.
Economic and political factors have taken their toll as welL
The economy in South Africa has taken a serious downturn due to
international sanctions and the divestment of many businesses.
Henriksen said Mandela and de Klerk are doing the best to
relieve the situation. De Klerk initiated a government crackdown
called Operation Iron Fist to reduce the violence between sup
porters of the ANC and those of the Inkatha movement.
Henriksen said both groups must deal with their constituents
but can only move at a certain pace. He said there will always be
people fearful of change and people who are unhappy.
