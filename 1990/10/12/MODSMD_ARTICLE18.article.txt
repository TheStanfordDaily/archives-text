# Gulf update: world and Iraq in stalemate while hostages leave
## 
### 
J While the British are urging
Che world to remain united
Against Saddam Hussein, U.S. Air
Force training flights were halted
in Saudi Arabia after some fatal
accidents, and Israel, a U.S. ally,
was condemned by the United
Nations and Arab countries for
the killings of 19 Palestinians.
Meanwhile, more western
hostages are coming home from
Iraq and Kuwait.
Keeping the coalition intact
Britain's foreign secretary
warned yesterday that the world
will revert to anarchy if the inter
national coalition against Iraq col
lapses, and said Hussein must be
told force will be used if Iraq does
Oot pull out of Kuwait.
Speaking at the annual confer
ence of the governing Conserva
tive Party in Bournemouch, Eng
land, Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd urged the world to remain
united against Iraq's occupation.
"If it does not (hold), then
despite the coalition, despite the
leadership of the United States,
despite the cooperation of the
Soviet Union, we shall be back in a
world of anarchy punctuated by
explosions of force," Hurd said.
\ "The clouds would have extin
guished the light. We cannot allow
Oiis to happen."
I Hurd also said Saddam should
fcnow that force will be used if
Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait.
* "Day by day we must build in
tjie minds of the Iraqis the cer
tainty that they have to leave

Kuwait — if not peacefully, then
forced out by military action,"
Hurd said.
Air Force grounded
The U.S. Air Force, meanwhile,
grounded all training flights in
the Persian Gulf region for 24
hours to discuss air safety with
pilots. The order followed sepa
rate accidents this week during
which 12 U.S. servicemen have
died.
The grounding was declared
Wednesday at noon Saudi time
and was lifted yesterday noon,
said Pete Williams, the chief Pen
tagon spokesman.
The grounding exclueded
reconnaissance missions and
other "operational patrols," said a
second Pentagon spokesman, Col.
Miguel Monteverde.
The official death toll for
Desert Shield rose to 24 on
Wednesday, when an Air Force F
-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a
training mission in Saudi Arabia,
killing both crew members.
On Monday, two pilots were
killed in the crash of an Air Force
F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet
in Saudi Arabia. Hours earlier,
two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey
helicopters — each carrying four
crew members — crashed over the
Arabian Sea. The eight men are
listed as missing.
Williams said, however, that
the military's safety record since
troops began to be deployed two
months ago remained good under

the circumstances.
"Given the amount of flying
that has to be done, given the
extraordinary circumstances and
given the higher than ordinary
operating tempo in the area, I
think our service people are doing
very well," he said.

More westerners evacuated
A group of about 360 western
evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait
landed in Britain yesterday in the
first such flight in nearly three
weeks. Most of the passengers
were Americans and many were

children.
The Americans and Canadians
on the flight were to leave Friday
for Raleigh-Durham Interna
tional Airport in North Carolina,
said Andrew Varney, Gatwick air
port's director of public affairs.
Until yesterday, freedom

flights had transported about
1,900 Americans out of Iraq and
Kuwait. Recent State Department
estimates indicated more than
600 Americans were stranded in
Kuwait and more than 300 in
Iraq.
An undetermined number of
British, French and West German
citizens are also held in Iraq and
Kuwait as human shields around
strategic targets. Others are
believed hiding in Kuwait.
According to U.S. State Depart
ment figures, more than 900,000
of the estimated 3 million foreign*
ers in Kuwait and Iraq on Aug. 2,
when Iraqi forces overran Kuwait,
have left.
There are now less than 5,000
Soviets in Iraq, mostly oil workers
and construction specialists.
There are also 93 military advis
ers. About 2,000 are expected to
leave by late October.
Israel condemned
Monday's killing by Israeli
police of 19 Arabs during a riot in
Jerusalem brought international
outcry and united Arab nations
against Israel, a close ally of the
United States. There was concern
that the Israeli action might
weaken Arab support for the
multinational military presence in
the gulf.
The U.N. Security Council is
considering means of censuring
Israel that would satisfy outraged
Arab nations and also Israel's
allies.
