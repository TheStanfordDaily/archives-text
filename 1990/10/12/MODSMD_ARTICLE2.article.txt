# Cuts will damage libraries seriously, prof. tells Rosse
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In a frank exchange of opin
ions with Provost James
Rosse, the chair of the Faculty
Senate's committee on
libraries said yesterday he was
seriously concerned about the
damage being done to the Uni
versity library system by the
budget cuts.
The cuts will "freeze (the
library's) ability to be creative,

inventive and responsive," said
German Prof. Gerald Gillespie
following the annual report of
the committee on libraries to
the senate. "The pain is very
severe," he said.
The targeted cut of 12 per
cent of the library's operating
budget was very dangerous to
the entire Stanford academic
community, Gillespie said. He
said the cuts reflected poorly
on Stanford's academic commit
ment.
Rosse acknowledged that while
the cuts to the libraries budget
were "serious," they did not
"threaten the scholarship of the
institution."
Several senators expressed
concern about the divergent out

looks offered by Rosse and Gille
spie.
In other business, the senate
was scheduled to discuss pro
posed revisions to the distribution
requirements. Due to the length
of the discussion on the library
system and Rosse's report on
restructuring, that discussion
was postponed. The senate will
likely vote on the proposal in a
month.
In his report to the senate,
University President Donald

Kennedy said he and other
administrators had met with offi
cials from the General Account
ing Office for several hours ear
lier in the day. The GAO is one of
two federal agencies investigating
Stanford's indirect cost policies.
Another meeting with GAO
officials is scheduled for tomor
row. A team of auditors will be on
campus for a few months. "We
expect them to be with us for
quite some time," Kennedy said.
