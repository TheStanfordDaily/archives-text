New phone system
has some benefits,
but needs review

After much planning
and great expense, Stanford
University has installed a
new telephone system for stu
dents' use this year.
The promised benefits of the
new telephone system are many.
Students are already enjoying the
convenient five-digit phone num
bers which they have under the
new system. Bills will supposedly
be cheaper, and roommates will
receive separate long-distance bills.
But the system has some glaring
defects which must be corrected as
soon as possible.
First, the security of students'
personal access codes (PACs) has
come into serious question. Com
munications Services gives out
PACs over the phone to students
who can identify themselves by giv
ing their student ID number,
birthplace and date of birth.
The problem is that this infor
mation is fairly easy to obtain;
many dorms, in fact, post students'
birthdays and hometowns on the
walls. Last week, a Daily reporter
obtained another student's PAC
number as a test of system's secu
rity. Such breaches of security
make students vulnerable to fraud.
Furthermore, the new system
deprives students the right to
choose a long distance company.
The competitive long distance mar
ket has recently allowed students
to enjoy such benefits as substan
tial discounts for calls made at cer
tain times of day, a number of free
calls each month and airline fre
quent flyer miles for calls made.
The new system keeps students

from directly accessing long-dis
tance companies. Students may
use long-distance services other
than the University's only by using
a calling card number, which usu
ally costs the student a surcharge
every time it is used.
Though this policy arguably
conforms to the letter of the FCC
regulation insuring that phone
users are allowed to choose a long
distance company, it has the effect
of impeding students from using
any but the University's own long
distance system.
Students must be given the
right to choose their own long-dis
tance service.
The new system also lacks sev
eral services which were previously
available. For example, the Univer
sal Lifeline Service once allowed
financially disadvantaged students
to make long-distance calls at
reduced rates. The University
plans to phase out this service.
Students have also lost the
opportunity to use various privi
leges such as measured-rate
billing, a flat-fee billing rate which
saves money for students who
make few calls.
Finally, the University will have,
under the new system, a record of
all of the calls that students make
from their phones. This represents
a potential invasion of privacy by
the University or by investigative
and law enforcement agencies.
Long-distance companies have
strict and clear policies on the pri
vacy and security of users' phone
calls. The University should emu
late this policy.
Five-digit phone numbers, low
phone bills and personalized billing
make the new system attractive.
But there is still more to do. The
system must be modified to make
it satisfactory; students' concerns
should be addressed immediately.
