## Just me, my gender and I 
### 
THE NUMBER WAS 2267. For those
of you who are not math msgors,
that's the bottom quarter of the
draw. But I'm not bitter. I live in Robin
son House. And for those of you who
weren't forced to investigate the section
of campus closest to San Francisco,
Robinson is the Gender Issues Theme
House.
"No problem," I thought, "Gender
Issues. I'm a Gender Issue kind of guy." I
was proud of my new theme. It would give
me much needed focus behind my other
wise undirected existence. Plus, if I used
it right, it just might help me pull the
babes.
I could picture it. Late night talks on
the pros and cons of satin underwear. Or
the pros and cons of underwear for that
matter. Dorm programs on belly button
sex. I scoffed at my Branner home. I was
so common, so boring, so prudish, so ...
gender less.
My summer dragged on. My friends
couldn't relate to the new me. They
wanted to play baseball and drink beers; I
stayed at home and learned about trisex
uals from Sally Jesse Raphael.
I could no longer eat dinner with my
parents. They bantered about the Middle
East while I struggled with the reappear
ing image of phallic shapes in dental tools.
I arrived at Stanford early, eager to
decorate my new Robinson room. In the
spirit of multiculturalism, I celebrated
my gender. I strived to make my room
reek of all things male. My pride might
have been excessive, but it was not with
out legitimate enthusiasm; I was damn
proud of my penis and all that it repre-

sents.
I sprayed the room with a mixture of
Old Spice and Ben Gay. I hung posters of
scantily clad women draped around giant
bottles of Budweiser. I bought a replica of
an early 16th century Italian urinal —
rightfully proud of my gender's unique
ability to urinate from an upright posi
tion. I even began to wear a codpiece.
I left my door wide open, letting the
natural, manly smell pervade the Robin
son halls. At first visitors were scarce, but
the "Why Men Wouldn't Complain If
They Menstruated" calendar on my door
soon attracted some attention.
I was hurt and embarrassed to dis
cover that my newly found male-culture
was not equally appreciated by everyone
in the dorm. I was called a sexist. I was
called moronic. Someone even accused me
of having a breast fetish.
I was crushed. I went to my RA. She
made me shower. She made me remove
my fake chest hair. She also made me
spray my room with Pine-Scent Lysol. I
didn't feel like a man. I felt more like a
freshly shaven leprechaun.
At first I was angry. My culture had
been mocked. My identity had been
tossed aside as insubstantial. How could
I, being a male, be understood without
first understanding maleness? What kind
of a Gender Issues Theme House was this
anyway? I stormed back into my RA's
room.
I explained to her my needs to express
my male essence. She sat me down and
offered me an Otter Pop. I silently rel
ished the phallic imagery.
She politely explained to me that I was

not expressing my maleness, but only a
tawdry, commercialized stereotype. After
hastily proposing a male-theme house
and being dutifully directed toward the
Phi Delts, I reconsidered. Humbled, and
with neither focus nor identity, I begged
to be told the essence of maleness.
In the reconstructive days that fol
lowed, I learned quite a bit. I learned that
there are fewer differences between the
sexes than within them. I learned that it
is more important to be a person than a
male.
I learned that children of both sexes,
for some unexplained reason, undress
Barbie dolls.
I took off my neon green codpiece and
put it away for special occasions. Robin
son, though not offering the coed jello
wrestling that I had originally hoped for,
had already begun to teach me important
lessons about how limiting labels can be,
even gender-related ones.
It was more important, Robinson had
taught me, to get to know other people —
and myself — for who they really are,
than it is to try to mold a personality
around any group, culture or gender. I
was happy. I was more than a penis. I was
a person. A person with a penis, and not
the other way around.

Joel Stein is a handsome man. His col
