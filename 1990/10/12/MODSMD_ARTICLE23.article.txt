Stanford should vigorously enforce new alcohol policy

IS STANFORD UNIVERSITY still
part of the United States? When I
received my term bill a few months
ago, I'm almost positive I mailed my
check to a place in California (that's still
part of the United States, I think).
Why is it then that Stanford Univer
sity, or at least a portion of its students
and resident assistants, believes it is
exempt from the laws as set forth by the
United States of America?
I have followed the articles in The
Daily over the past several days concern
ing the "new" policy regarding drug and
alcohol consumption.
New policy? Does this mean that
before Oct. 1, 1990, my residence hous
ing funds could have been used to buy
cocaine and heroin, along with beer for
18-year-olds, but now those tyrants that
decide upon University policy are putting
an end to it?
Frankly, I am appalled at the reac-

tions and opinions expressed against this
policy in The Daily by several students
and RAs. I am appalled at the fact that
up until Oct. 1, 1990, Stanford Univer
sity had chosen to ignore the issue of
underage drinking.
WAKE UP, PEOPLE! It's against the
law for a minor to possess alcohol, for a
minor to consume alcohol, for an "adult"
(I use this term loosely) over the age of
21 to purchase alcohol for a minor.
I am not writing this letter to debate
whether such rules are right or wrong; it
is a personal decision one must make
regarding them — but be prepared to
face the music if j'ou are caught.
However, for Stanford University to
ignore such issues is bad enough; for
Stanford University to promote the bla
tant disregard of these laws is an out
rage!
To all the Ph. D.sand other geniuses
that govern Stanford University and pro

fess education as their goal but seem to
be influenced principally by money, can
you say L-I-A-B-I-L-I-T-Y?
I attended Rutgers University as an
undergraduate. For some time, Rutgers
also apparently ignored these alcohol
laws, although they did not promote
them. And then the spring 1988
semester took place and the policy mak
ers awakened.
What awakened them? Death. More
specifically, the deaths of two students,
within three months of one another, on
campus directly linked to the underage
consumption of alcohol.
Now Rutgers University realizes that
its purpose of educating students
extends beyond the books — it also
includes educating students about social
responsibility.
To the policy makers at Stanford Uni
versity, I implore you to stand strong in
your enforcements of this "new" alcohol

and drug policy. To my knowledge, Stan
ford University has not had a problem *
with alcohol and drug abuse; let's not
wait for a tragedy to awaken us.
Stanford University is not a law
enforcement agency, but there is also no
need to bring temptation to its doorstep.
To the students of Stanford Univer
sity, it is common knowledge that these
four years are part of an age of experi
mentation. No one can make the deci
sions that you will inevitably face for
you; before you choose, however, think
wisely about the consequences and if you
are willing to accept them.
As a word of warning, remember that
the basis of the television show "21
Jump Street" is not far from reality —
ponder this thought at the next happy
hour or fraternity party that you attend.
