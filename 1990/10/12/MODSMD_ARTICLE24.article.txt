# Kennedy is pulling the wool over the eyes of students
## 
### 
As an educator and a concerned
Stanford alumnus, I can no longer
remain silent as the administration and
University President Donald Kennedy
hem and haw while pulling wool over
people's eyes.
I, myself, must sadly admit to being
cleverly duped over the past two to three
years. The administration's campaign
has been well organized and complete
and, in my opinion, created to serve the
ambitions of its leader.
Kennedy's response to students' let
ters in the October 4 (Viewpoint) edition
was atrocious. By replying in a very con
descending manner, he trivializes their
concerns.

It makes me wonder who or what this
man thinks he is. Well, if I recall correct
ly, a more famous and respected presi
dent once said, "You can fool all of the
people sometimes and some of the people
all of the time, but you cannot fool all of
the people all of the time."
Kennedy should now realize that the
lamb-on-a-leash he thought he was lead
ing has turned out to be a lion.
As one who has witnessed, studied,
and analyzed teaching of both high and
low quality over the years, I am angered
and offended by Kennedy's non-reply to
Mr. Lewis' pointed questions as to what
Kennedy would do to improve teaching
at Stanford: "The faculty decides who is
to be on the faculty."
I would like to ask Kennedy what he
would do if he saw the faculty behaving
in a fascist manner. Would he adhere to
this stand and do nothing?
If Kennedy would like to say that such

a situation, to his knowledge, has never
occurred at Stanford, perhaps I should
bring out some skeletons from my closet
— and his.
The Stanford tradition, unlike the eli
tist (i.e. civil) East Coast culture that
Kennedy may be more comfortable with,
is one of plain, honest, open talk.
In keeping with that tradition it is
about time that the president put his
money where his mouth is — that is,
either put up or shut up. I personally
have some serious doubts as to whether
the administration and its leader can
deal with the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.
However, if Kennedy does not begin to
take important issues at Stanford more
seriously, I am afraid that he is going to
find himself on the short end of a no-con
fidence vote.
