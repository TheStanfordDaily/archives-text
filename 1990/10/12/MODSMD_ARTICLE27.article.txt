## Williamson M. Evers National service proposal deserves attention and debate 
### 
IN THE NEAR FUTURE, will all
American young people — both boys
and girls — have to perform service
work under the guidance of the federal
government? Although the prospects for
such an all-inclusive program might seem
remote, they have become more likely in
recent months as Congress has passed
bills that proponents of universal service
see as a beachhead from which they hope
to move on to establishing a program that
requires all young people to enlist.
The House passed a $183 million
national service bill (H.R. 4330) on Sept.
13. The Senate passed a $125 million bill
(S. 1430) on March 1. Now a conference
committee is reconciling the differences.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.; Sen. Charles
Robb, D-Va.; and Congressman Dave
McCurdy, D-Okla., say that a 1990
national service act should be the first
step toward a broadly inclusive, large
scale national service program.
Whether Congress establishes a pro
gram that encompasses massive numbers
of young people in the near future
depends in part on the shape of the 1990
bill that comes out of the conference com
mittee.
But, more importantly, it depends in
the long run on the attitude of pro-mili
tary members of Congress and on the
attitude of American young people.
What kind of bill comes out of the con
ference committee is important because
the Senate bill includes an experimental

program to pay participants $5,000
vouchers for each year of service. The
House bill would cancel the obligation of
those in national service to repay certain
federal student loans.
This voucher plan and this debt cancel
lation plan are slightly different
approaches, but each is part of an effort
by proponents of all-inclusive national
service to put in place substantial
rewards and penalties (at present, short
of the threat of a jail sentence for refusal
to enlist) in order to encourage massive
numbers of young people to enlist.
The 1989 Nunn-McCurdy bill, for
example made federal aid for most college
students conditional on doing service
work.
Indeed the Bush administration has
threatened a presidential veto of the 1990
national service bill not only because of
its probable price tag, but also because its
measures run counter to President
Bush's ideal of unpaid altruism.
If Congress were eventually to estab
lish a large-scale civilian labor program
under the rubric of national service, the
civilian program and the U.S. military
would compete to attract young people to
their ranks.
This may be a less important problem
than it than it was once, given reduced
tensions between the United States and
the Soviet Union and hence reduced U.S.
military manpower needs.
But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz; Sen.

Adopting a large-scale, broadly inclusive pro
gram of national service is one of the few pro
posals on the public policy agenda today that
would markedly change the American way of life
as we know it.

Rudy Boshwitz, R-Minn.; and Sen.
William Armstrong, R-Colo., pointed out
in debate on the Senate floor on Feb. 27
that the vouchers that would be awarded
under the Senate national service bill
were worth more than the benefits pro
vided military veterans under the Mont
gomery G.I. Bill, and Senator McCain
said on Feb. 27 and March 1 that little
thought had been given to measuring the
Senate bill's effect on military recruiting.
The end of the Cold War gives propo
nents of national service a chance to
emphasize civilian service programs. But
the end of the Cold War may detach pro
military politicians from the coalition
supporting national service.
Many members of Congress who have
supported a large, well-funded military
have also supported establishing national
service — often as a way of bringing back
a military draft.
Recently, because of U.S.-Soviet rap
prochement —'and despite the apparent

U.S. assumption of long-term military
duties in the Persian Gulf region —
Congress has begun to reduce the size of
the military.
A Senate bill would reduce the Army,
for example, by 40,000 next year, a House
bill by 68,500. As Doug Bandow, a syndi
cated columnist and opponent of national
service points out, lower militaiy man
power requirements mean that fewer
members of Congress want to establish
national service.
Despite opinion poll results that seem
to show widespread support for national
service among young people, according to
the late Morris Janowitz, an eminent
sociologist and a proponent of national
service, the majority of college students
have strong reservations.
According to Janowitz, the ''typical
young male or female*' does not want to
lose a year or two in"the struggle to
find a place in the occupational struc
ture."

At the same time, young people are
participating in increasing numbers in
volunteer public service work. If this flow
of young people into volunteer public ser
vice becomes a popular social-political
movement that unambiguously demands
a full-scale, comprehensive national ser
vice program, such a development would
alter the attitude of now-skeptical law
makers.
Yet both such possible developments
run counter to the normal American pat
tern. Usually the American people want
demobilization in times of peace, and
American young people value individual
liberty and personal independence. Young
people may well prefer to pursue their
interest in public service as independent
volunteers rather than as participants in
government-run national service.
The proponents and opponents of
national service are debating fundamen
tal issues — individual rights, civic
duties, and the scope of government
authority.
Adopting a large-scale, broadly inclu
sive program of national service is one of
the few proposals on the public policy
agenda today that would markedly
change the American way of life as we
know it. As such, national service is a pro
posal that deserves full and extended
debate.
