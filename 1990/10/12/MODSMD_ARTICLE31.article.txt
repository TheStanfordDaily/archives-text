The Daily Palo Alto
The lead editorial of the Daily
Palo Alto urged students to try
out to be one of the two assistants
to the "Yell Leader," or as the
Daily put it, "An opportunity is
presented ... to compete for two
of the most coveted positions in
the student body." The Daily, per
haps to warn those applicants that
did not measure up, said that
being a "Yell Leader" or an assis
tant "is an activity that calls for
plenty of gray matter and ability
in handling a mass of people in
addition to a pair of lusty lungs
and ability to wave the arms
rhythmically." Fifteen students
tried out a week later and were
"given three chances to prove
[their] ability as a noise inducer"
before the lucky two were chosen.
Oh, how the mighty have
fallen.
If only there were enough peo
ple on campus with "lusty lungs
and ability to wave the arms
rhythmically." An anonymous
source informs me that if we had
had such yell leaders last year we
would have beaten Harvard in the
U.S. News & World Report sur
vey.

The Stanford Daily
It was announced today that
the theme for the annual sopho
more dance would be "Let's Go
Slumming." The decoration com
mittee decided that "in keeping
with the theme, refreshments will
be served by typical bums" and
the women's gym will be "con

verted into a replica of London's
old Limehouse slum district."
And we wonder why people
accuse us of being rich snobs. But
hey, I can't think of anything else
that makes me want to party more
than to imagine myself destitute
and living in a diseased, rat
infested ghetto. Interestingly
enough, the next sophomore dance
had a similar theme, "Let's Go
Hungry," in which starving chil
dren served drinks and the gym
was decorated like a typical Third
World nation.

The Stanford Daily
Worried by new draft legisla
tion proposed by Congress for the
Korean conflict, Dean of Students
Donald Winbigler warned campus
fraternities that they could lose
up to "three-fourths of their
members by next September."
According to the Dean, the severe
consequences of such an action
means "there is a real reason for

[fraternities] to be concerned
about the stability of [houses] —
especially as to grade point aver
ages."
Isn't it admirable how Dean
Winbigler was able to cut to the
heart of the matter — not that
Stanford students might die
5,000 miles away defending a
parallel, but that these students
wouldn't be around to inflate the
house GPA? I'm sure that if fra
ternity men were drafted into the
Persian Gulf conflict today, Presi
dent Kennedy would not dwell on
such a trivial issue as house GPA,
but instead tell fraternities to con
cern themselves with whether they
would still be able to pay for dam
ages to hotels in Reno.

A 666-page report released
today showed that Stanford stu
dents did not fit into "the popular
stereotype of widespread sexual
promiscuity among college stu
dents."
According to the study, more
than three-fifths of Stanford men
and two-thirds of Stanford women
had not had sex by the middle of
their junior years. Also, "Roughly
a third of the men and a quarter of
the women seem to date little or
not at all even as college seniors,"
and more than half the students
had no dates at all in an average
week.
No dating at Stanford? The
earth-shattering revelation is
almost as surprising as the results
of an official Daily Survey, which
concludes that New Kids on the
Block suck.
