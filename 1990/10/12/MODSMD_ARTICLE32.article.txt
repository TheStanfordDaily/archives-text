# Guys: Fashion a myth, just don't wear blue shorts with cole slaw
## 
### Ken Wharton 
are concerned, is the concept of fashion.
As most of you people of the female
persuasion are aware, the average guy in
the world is approximately as fashion
conscious as a steamroller-induced road
kill.
The whole idea of certain colors "clash
ing" is a complete mystery. My personal
theory is that this is either a female plot
designed to make guys paranoid or a des
perate bid by the shopping malls of the
world to sell more shoes.
Despite the fact that the average
female already has enough shoes to start
her own franchise, every time they get a
new outfit, they feel compelled to buy yet
another pair.

[ It is a well-known fact that this world
\ is filled with things that simply cannot be
j explained. From the stench in White
{ Plaza to the fact that 40 percent of the
stores in shopping malls sell shoes, there
|"Will always be phenomena that defy any
rational explanation.

In fact, many of these things are sim
; ply accepted as a normal part of life â€”
; such as those ingenious spiral vending
' machine dispensers, which tend to "acci
| dentally" snag onto the bag of chips just
; before it falls, forcing you to buy another
' one in order to get anything at all.
But even more confounding and per
! plexing than these issues, at least as guys

The average guy in the world is approximately
as fashion-conscious as a steamroller-induced
roadkill.

Because of the nagging concern that
our natural choice of clothing looks as
appealing as the Manzanita trailers, guys
make some sort of attempt to be fashion
oriented. Many of us have sisters who
politely clue us in that, for example, it
looks bad to wear blue shorts while eating
cole slaw.
It's also possible that some guys get
their info from magazines like GQ,

although I've never met anyone who will
admit to reading it, let alone know what it
stands for. And as for myself, I just tell
people I'm on my way to a band rally.
And then, of course, there is the idea of
making a fashion statement. I've never
attempted to do this on my own, mainly
out of the fear of starting a fad. It's amaz
ing how easy it is to turn something
stupid into something popular. In fact,

I'm convinced that most of the stupid
fads in the world, such as piercing your
nose or lopping off your left ear, were cre
ated by guys who thought they had a grip
on "fashion," but actually only had a sis
ter who wanted to see them in a lot of
pain.
So when it comes to fashion, I'll just
smile and nod my head when people tell
me I look like a complete dufus. Maybe I'll
even make some minor clothing adjust
ments, such as not wrapping toilet paper
around my head.
I keep telling myself that with eteps
like this, I'll be fashion-conscious any day
now. It can't be that hard. After all, I
don't even like cole slaw.
