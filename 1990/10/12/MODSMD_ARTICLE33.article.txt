# Does the most recent Bible have a Bug or two in it?

ment. Many had even memorized
the passage and suavely spouted it
at cocktail parties. Now the con
cept of "receiving a stoning"
enters the picture.
What is a stoning? you ask.
(While you haven't explicitly
asked , I figured this question —
on the minds of many Stanford
students — would end up in my
Bug mailbox eventually.)

Dear Bug,
When I brought my Bible to
CIV section, the prof told me I had
the old, outdated version. She
said I'd have to invest in the 1990
edition. What's the deal with this
new Bible? Were new truths actu
ally discovered, or is this just a
Bible publisher's ploy ?

Dear C.M.,
Congratulations, you are a wise
and cynical shopper. You know
how publishers alter page num
bers, put a sleek new cover on the
book, add a few problems and
then issue a "Totally Revised"
textbook. Whatever happened to
"Thou Shall Not Exploit the Poor
Student By Extorting $75 For a
New Calculus Textbook??"
Unfortunately, this command
ment still hasn't made it into the
Bible. However, one new truth has
been included in the new edition,
and a couple of clarifications have
been made.
While the 1952 edition of the
Bible asserted that "Man does not
live by bread alone," the new ver
sion says, "One does not live by
bread alone." Whereas before it
may have been interpreted that
men alone were incapable of sur
viving on merely bread, it is now
clear that women and children
cannot survive on a bread-only
diet either.
Most of the Biblical changes
are merely clarifications.
Corinthians Part II 11:25 was
changed from, "Once I was
stoned," to "Once I received a
stoning."
The change has befuddled
many people, who, before the
change, thought they had mas
tered the meaning of the state-

In early Christian history, ston
ing was a popular punishment for
men and women accused of
heresy, adultery, thieving and
other hot crimes of the times. On
the morning of the stoning, men
scoured the earth for large stones.
They then brought them to the
event and hurled them, limit one
toss per person, at the hapless vic
tim.
Much like going to the movies
today — or the Flicks, for those of
you who don't get out much and
have forgotten the generic term
for Flicks — the stoning was con
sidered something of a social
event. Men congregated, stone in
hand, and discussed holy mira
cles, human sacrifices and other
current events.
Women were excluded from the
stonings because, they were told,
"You throw like a woman." Men
also viewed the task of stoning as
"man's work." Men may have

Women were excluded from the
stonings because, they were told, 'You
throw like a woman.' Men also viewed
the task of stoning as 'men's work.'

simply trumped up these two
excuses so they could turn the
stoning into a male-bonding expe
rience.
Throws to the head were pro
hibited because they would merci
fully knock the victim uncon
scious and deprive him or her of a
protracted, painful death. The
body of the stonee became rock
laden, and the victim eventually
suffocated under the rock collec
tion.
Animal lovers should take note
that the victim's sheep, pigs and
other livestock were often stoned
(Oops, I mean, received a stoning)
as well.
At this point, you may wonder
why someone (even a saint) would
go around saying, "Once I
received a stoning." While it
sounds like a grim ending to us,
the Ancients regarded it as an
honor to die a martyr's death.
"What better way to become a
martyr than to be pegged to death
by rocks?" they wondered.
According to them, the more
painful the death, the more
promising the eternal award.
Sheep and pigs, on the other
hand, highly resented the ston
ings because they didn't buy into
this notion of the "eternal award."
Although I've digressed
slightly, I hope you realize by now
how badly you need the new 1990
Revised Bible.
Dear Bug!
I'm a transfer student from

Skokie, Illinois, and I need a clar
ification of a term I've been hear
ing a lot lately. Is it grammati
cally correct to say "I'm stoked,"
or does a person have to be told
that he/she is stoked ?

Dear Beth!
You're so stoked!! I'm actually
answering your question. In Cali
fornia, "stoking" goes on in the
first person only if you are using
the verb in its traditional mean
ing, If you wish to express that
you have just raked coals over a
fire, you may indeed say "I've
stoked." However, I doubt you'll
be doing much of this sort of stok
ing — at least not at Stanford.
Stoking can never go on in the
first person passive, as in "I'm
stoked." You must be told that
you're stoked, or you must tell
somebody that he or she is.
Telling someone he or she is
stoked is more than just a state
ment of fact. Compare the follow
ing exclamations:
a) "You're so stupid!"
b) "You're so stoked!"
While sentence (a) merely tells
you something, phrase (b) actu
ally commands you to a certain
state of mind.
Since you cannot go around
saying "I'm stoked," you must be
told you're stoked before you truly
can be stoked. I realize that this
may sound confusing, but, in
practice, it's quite simple. You

merely listen to some fool telling
you that you're stoked, then smile
or nod and make a mental note
that you've been stoked.
Beth, as a newcomer to Stan
ford and to the rest of California, I
feel that you also need to be told
that professors should not be
greeted "Hey, Dude."

simply trumped up these two
excuses so they could turn the
stoning into a male-bonding expe
rience.
Throws to the head were pro
hibited because they would merci
fully knock the victim uncon
scious and deprive him or her of a
protracted, painful death. The
body of the stonee became rock
laden, and the victim eventually
suffocated under the rock collec
tion.
Animal lovers should take note
that the victim's sheep, pigs and
other livestock were often stoned
(Oops, I mean, received a stoning)
as well.
At this point, you may wonder
why someone (even a saint) would
go around saying, "Once I
received a stoning." While it
sounds like a grim ending to us,
the Ancients regarded it as an
honor to die a martyr's death.
"What better way to become a
martyr than to be pegged to death
by rocks?" they wondered.
According to them, the more
painful the death, the more
promising the eternal award.
Sheep and pigs, on the other
hand, highly resented the ston
ings because they didn't buy into
this notion of the "eternal award."
Although I've digressed
slightly, I hope you realize by now
how badly you need the new 1990
Revised Bible.
Dear Bug!
I'm a transfer student from

Skokie, Illinois, and I need a clar
ification of a term I've been hear
ing a lot lately. Is it grammati
cally correct to say "I'm stoked,"
or does a person have to be told
that he/she is stoked ?

(pseudonym)
Dear Beth!
You're so stoked!! I'm actually
answering your question. In Cali
fornia, "stoking" goes on in the
first person only if you are using
the verb in its traditional mean
ing, If you wish to express that
you have just raked coals over a
fire, you may indeed say "I've
stoked." However, I doubt you'll
be doing much of this sort of stok
ing — at least not at Stanford.
Stoking can never go on in the
first person passive, as in "I'm
stoked." You must be told that
you're stoked, or you must tell
somebody that he or she is.
Telling someone he or she is
stoked is more than just a state
ment of fact. Compare the follow
ing exclamations:
a) "You're so stupid!"
b) "You're so stoked!"
While sentence (a) merely tells
you something, phrase (b) actu
ally commands you to a certain
state of mind.
Since you cannot go around
saying "I'm stoked," you must be
told you're stoked before you truly
can be stoked. I realize that this
may sound confusing, but, in
practice, it's quite simple. You

merely listen to some fool telling
you that you're stoked, then smile
or nod and make a mental note
that you've been stoked.
Beth, as a newcomer to Stan
ford and to the rest of California, I
feel that you also need to be told
that professors should not be
greeted "Hey, Dude."

Dear Bug,
When I brought my Bible to
CIV section, the prof told me I had
the old, outdated version. She
said I'd have to invest in the 1990
edition. What's the deal with this
new Bible? Were new truths actu

Bible publisher's ploy ?

Dear C.M.,
Congratulations, you are a wise
and cynical shopper. You know
how publishers alter page num
bers, put a sleek new cover on the
book, add a few problems and
then issue a "Totally Revised"
textbook. Whatever happened to
"Thou Shall Not Exploit the Poor
Student By Extorting $75 For a
New Calculus Textbook??"
Unfortunately, this command
ment still hasn't made it into the
Bible. However, one new truth has
been included in the new edition,
and a couple of clarifications have
been made.
While the 1952 edition of the
Bible asserted that "Man does not
live by bread alone," the new ver
sion says, "One does not live by
bread alone." Whereas before it
may have been interpreted that
men alone were incapable of sur
viving on merely bread, it is now
clear that women and children
cannot survive on a bread-only
diet either.
Most of the Biblical changes
are merely clarifications.
Corinthians Part II 11:25 was
changed from, "Once I was
stoned," to "Once I received a
stoning."
The change has befuddled
many people, who, before the
change, thought they had mas
tered the meaning of the state-

In early Christian history, ston
ing was a popular punishment for
men and women accused of
heresy, adultery, thieving and
other hot crimes of the times. On
the morning of the stoning, men
scoured the earth for large stones.
They then brought them to the
event and hurled them, limit one
toss per person, at the hapless vic
tim.
Much like going to the movies
today — or the Flicks, for those of
you who don't get out much and
have forgotten the generic term
for Flicks — the stoning was con
sidered something of a social
event. Men congregated, stone in
hand, and discussed holy mira
cles, human sacrifices and other
current events.
Women were excluded from the
stonings because, they were told,

may sound confusing, but, in
practice, it's quite simple. You

merely listen to some fool telling
you that you're stoked, then smile
or nod and make a mental note
that you've been stoked.
Beth, as a newcomer to Stan
ford and to the rest of California, I
feel that you also need to be told
that professors should not be
greeted "Hey, Dude."
Dear Bug,
Can I ask you a question ? Why
is the grass green ?
— Joe
Dear Joe,
I've taken the liberty of ignor
ing your very feeble second ques
tion and simply answering the

first. Yes, Joe, you can ask me a
question — and I may even
answer it! While others have been
ignoring and shunning you all
these years, I may pay attention to
you.
In fact, ATTENTION ALL
READERS: I am now fielding
questions. If you have any ques
tions regarding Stanford phenom
ena, or are wondering about some
thing in the real world, please
drop me a line. Or drop me many
lines. Send questions through e
mail (macbeth) to b.bug, or feed
your question to my Bug box at
the Daily. If neither of the options
appeals to you, write to me at PO.
Box 6597, Stanford, Calif. 94309.
