# Carter rises to lead Card
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Fred Carter was late.
After showing up for an 11 o'clock appoint
ment at 11:05, the Littleton, Colo, native apol
ogized. "Sorry," he said, "but I was late
because I had to come on foot."
Judging from his performance on the cross
country course, Carter's going somewhere on
foot is no excuse for not getting there quickly.
Very quickly. Carter has exploded from relative
anonymity at Stanford to become the Cardi
nal's best cross-country runner, leading a team
that, despite lacking the superstars of years
past, has an excellent chance to make the
NCAA finals.
Carter's road to the top in the sports of
cross country and track and field has not been
a smooth one. During his senior year in high
school, he was touted as a contender for the
state title. When the meet came, however,
Carter was in the midst of a fierce battle with
the flu and collapsed as he crossed the finish
line, well behind the winner. Months later, bad
luck cost him another important race as he
was tripped up near the end of a qualifying
meet.
Carter's run of bad luck continued into his
collegiate career, as he has broken his arm
twice in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. "I feel
like I've paid my dues to the sport of track and
field," he said. "I think that I'm ready to do
well."
Not that he hasn't done well already. He fin
ished first on the men's team at the Michigan
State Invitational on Sept. 15 before winning
the individual title at the Ohio State Invita
tional the following week. Last weekend, at
the Stanford/Holiday Inn Invitational, Carter
ran a personal best of 24 minutes, 58 seconds
for 8,000 meters in placing second on the team
to senior Jason Martin.
"This year's been good for me," Carter said.
"I wasn't even in the top seven my freshman
year, and last year I ran fifth on the team, so
it's good to see that I'm improving."
"I was recruited out of high school as some
one with a lot of potential," Carter went on. "I
wasn't an All-American in high school, but
schools tried to get me in the hope that I would
get better."
Describing Carter's leap to promi
nence simply as "getting better"
is like calling Methuselah old.
Carter credits his quantum leap
at least in part to the fact that,
unlike much of the team, he
leaves the Farm each summer to
train over the mountainous ter
rain of his home state.
"Most of the team stays
around here over the summers to
get coaching," Carter said. "I pre
fer going back home. I think that
the high altitudes there make you
a little bit tougher."
That toughness paid off at
Ohio State, Carter's first of what
will could be several cross country
wins as a Cardinal.
It was this thrill of victory that
prompted Carter to make the
move from soccer, his favorite
sport in his early high school
years, to cross country. "The fact
that I was more successful as a
runner than as a soccer player
was the driving force behind my
switching sports," he said.
"There's nothing like the feeling
of winning a race."
Except, that is, for a berth at
the NCAA championships, which
will be held in Knoxville, Ten
nessee, on Nov. 19. To qualify, the
Cardinal runners will have to fin
ish third in the District-8 meet, in
which most West Coast schools
will participate.
The only other race of the year
for Carter will be the Pacific 10
Conference Championships on
October 27. Pac-10's are more for
bragging rights within the confer
ence than anything else, as they
have no effect upon the NCAA
championships. However, it is
very infrequent that any teams
from outside the Pac-10 emerge
as forces in the District-8 meet.
"I don't think that there will
be any surprises in the race [Dis
trict-B's]," Carter said. "If any
thing, we'll do most of the sur
prising."
Carter fully expects the Cardi
nal to make nationals. However,
don't expect Carter to act noncha
lant in any way if Stanford should
make the journey to Tennessee.
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do
if we made it,"he said. "I'd prob
ably just run around all over the
place."
Probably pretty quickly, too.
