# Carter rises to lead Card

### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Fred Carter was late.
After showing up for an 11 o'clock appoint
ment at 11:05, the Littleton, Colo, native apol
ogized. "Sorry," he said, "but I was late
because I had to come on foot."
Judging from his performance on the cross
country course, Carter's going somewhere on
foot is no excuse for not getting there quickly.
Very quickly. Carter has exploded from relative
anonymity at Stanford to become the Cardi
nal's best cross-country runner, leading a team
that, despite lacking the superstars of years
past, has an excellent chance to make the
NCAA finals.
Carter's road to the top in the sports of
cross country and track and field has not been
a smooth one. During his senior year in high
school, he was touted as a contender for the
state title. When the meet came, however,
Carter was in the midst of a fierce battle with
the flu and collapsed as he crossed the finish
line, well behind the winner. Months later, bad
luck cost him another important race as he
was tripped up near the end of a qualifying
meet.
Carter's run of bad luck continued into his
collegiate career, as he has broken his arm
twice in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. "I feel
like I've paid my dues to the sport of track and
field," he said. "I think that I'm ready to do
well."
Not that he hasn't done well already. He fin
ished first on the men's team at the Michigan
State Invitational on Sept. 15 before winning
the individual title at the Ohio State Invita
tional the following week. Last weekend, at
the Stanford/Holiday Inn Invitational, Carter
ran a personal best of 24 minutes, 58 seconds
for 8,000 meters in placing second on the team
to senior Jason Martin.
"This year's been good for me," Carter said.
"I wasn't even in the top seven my freshman
year, and last year I ran fifth on the team, so
it's good to see that I'm improving."
"I was recruited out of high school as some
one with a lot of potential," Carter went on. "I
wasn't an All-American in high school, but
schools tried to get me in the hope that I would
get better."
