# Parity on the wane in NFL and Majors
## 
### 
Ever since Washington
trounced Southern Cali
fornia 31-0 earlier in the
season, the Pacific 10 Confer
ence football title has been up
for grabs, with any of three or
four teams capable of going to
the R*)se Bowl.
USC has had that privilege
for the past three seasons, but
with their big loss to the
Huskies, the door has been
opened for a reasonable
amount of parity in the Pac-10
this year.

And on any given Saturday
this college football season,
who is to say if Miami would
beat Notre Dame, or Michigan
would beat Florida? The trend
in the college ranks has been
toward closer games and more
parity overall.
I mean, goshdam, USC is
only favored by six points
tomorrow over our giant
killing Cardinal. The line on
the Trojan game hasn't been
that low in about a generation
or two.
If only the same could be
said for professional-level foot
ball and baseball. Lately two
Bay Area teams — the San
Francisco 49ers and the Oak
land A's — have constructed
what amount to mini-dynasties
that don't show too many signs
of letting up. The whole busi
ness has gotten just a little too
predictable.
The A's just won (I'm sorry,
SWEPT) the American League
Championship Series for the
third year in a row. Despite
what the San Francisco Chron
icle would have you believe,
this is not such a surprising
event that it is worthy of a
headline that you can read
three blocks away from the
newsstand:
The AWESOME A'S
SWEEP THROUGH SERIES
that greeted me yesterday
morning had to have been

about as big as the one that
read: JAPANESE BOMB
PEARL HARBOR.
I could have told you at the
beginning of spring training,
actually at the beginning of
spring training 1988, that Oak
land would be in the World
Series this October. Sure, it's
great if you happen to be an A's
fan, but you just can't help
thinking that this all-star team
they have constructed in the
East Bay is not exactly in the
best interest of parity in the
Mtyor Leagues.
The only half-serious threat
to confront the A's all season
was the Chicago White Sox's
surge in the middle of the sum
mer. But the inevitable separa
tion from the rest of the pack
happened as August and
September came, and one
almost had to agree with Oak
land pitcher Dave Stewart's
assessment that the "White
Sox can't hold my jock." Nor
any team in the Mayors these
days.
This past Monday, my eyes
were again bombarded with
Bay Area sports fanaticism (or
propaganda, depending on how
you look at it) on the front page
of the Chronicle.
The headline, over the
dropped masthead (the gothic
script at the top of the page),
spewed out: NINERS BEAT
OILERS 24-21 or something
like that. Really? The Niners
beat the Oilers? Well, by all
means, run a full page photo
spread and 13 stories on it. A
Niners victory doesn't come
every week, you know. They
lost twice last season.
Last year in the playoffs,
San Francisco blew out the
Minnesota Vikings and the Los
Angeles Rams — two very solid
teams — on their way to the
well-known 66-10 Domination
in the Dome.
The Niners, it seems, are
head and shoulders and waist
and kneecaps above any other
team in the NFL right now. It
has to do with the "best ever"
theory. Put together the best
ever quarterback (Joe Mon
tana) with the best-ever wide
receiver (Jerry Rice) with one
of the best-ever all-around run


Rob
Pardington
ning backs (Roger Craig), with
the best-ever safety (Ronnie Lott)
and you have an okay team.
After the 49ers win this next
Super Bowl, it'll be getting a little
old. At least in football, players'
primes tend to be a little shorter
than in other sports, so maybe we

won't have to wait quite as long
for this super team to go down
hill.
For right now, it seems that the
A's and the Niners should be
playing in a higher league some
where. In fact, why don't we have
them play each other.
Tim McCarver: There are
two minutes left in the bottom of
the ninth quarter of the final
game of the World Bowl. Dennis
Eckersley winds up and pitches to

Roger Craig. Craig catches the
ball and takes off for the first
base. Mark McGwire forces him
into the infield, where he is tack
led out by Walt Weiss, coming
over from short safety to make
the play.
John Madden: Good stick by
Weiss. Boy, he's a tough, hard
nosed little guy, not afraid to get
in there and get a little mud on
his jersey.
McCarver: Okay, third down

and two out. Jerry Rice up. Here's
the pitch. It's caught. Rice sprints
out... jukes McGwire. .. rounds
first and is finally brought down
by Dave Henderson at second.
Fourth down. . . Joe Montana
up ... He catches the first pitch
and rolls out by the A's bench. He
avoids the rush by Canseco from
right field and throws the ball to a
streaking Rice at third base. Rice
catches it and heads for home.

Ricky Henderson is gaining on
him.
Madden: Boom, what a colli
sion! Rice gets up still holding
onto the ball. Niners win! Niners
win!
McCarver: Well, there's noth
ing new there, John.
