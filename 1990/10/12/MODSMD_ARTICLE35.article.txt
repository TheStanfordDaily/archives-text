# Parity on the wane in NFL and Majors
## 
### 
Ever since Washington
trounced Southern Cali
fornia 31-0 earlier in the
season, the Pacific 10 Confer
ence football title has been up
for grabs, with any of three or
four teams capable of going to
the R*)se Bowl.
USC has had that privilege
for the past three seasons, but
with their big loss to the
Huskies, the door has been
opened for a reasonable
amount of parity in the Pac-10
this year.

And on any given Saturday
this college football season,
who is to say if Miami would
beat Notre Dame, or Michigan
would beat Florida? The trend
in the college ranks has been
toward closer games and more
parity overall.
I mean, goshdam, USC is
only favored by six points
tomorrow over our giant
killing Cardinal. The line on
the Trojan game hasn't been
that low in about a generation
or two.
If only the same could be
said for professional-level foot
ball and baseball. Lately two
Bay Area teams — the San
Francisco 49ers and the Oak
land A's — have constructed
what amount to mini-dynasties
that don't show too many signs
of letting up. The whole busi
ness has gotten just a little too
predictable.
The A's just won (I'm sorry,
SWEPT) the American League
Championship Series for the
third year in a row. Despite
what the San Francisco Chron
icle would have you believe,
this is not such a surprising
event that it is worthy of a
headline that you can read
three blocks away from the
newsstand:
The AWESOME A'S
SWEEP THROUGH SERIES
that greeted me yesterday
morning had to have been

about as big as the one that
read: JAPANESE BOMB
PEARL HARBOR.
I could have told you at the
beginning of spring training,
actually at the beginning of
spring training 1988, that Oak
land would be in the World
Series this October. Sure, it's
great if you happen to be an A's
fan, but you just can't help
thinking that this all-star team
they have constructed in the
East Bay is not exactly in the
best interest of parity in the
Mtyor Leagues.
The only half-serious threat
to confront the A's all season
was the Chicago White Sox's
surge in the middle of the sum
mer. But the inevitable separa
tion from the rest of the pack
happened as August and
September came, and one
almost had to agree with Oak
land pitcher Dave Stewart's
assessment that the "White
Sox can't hold my jock." Nor
any team in the Mayors these
days.
This past Monday, my eyes
were again bombarded with
Bay Area sports fanaticism (or
propaganda, depending on how
you look at it) on the front page
of the Chronicle.
The headline, over the
dropped masthead (the gothic
script at the top of the page),
spewed out: NINERS BEAT
OILERS 24-21 or something
like that. Really? The Niners
beat the Oilers? Well, by all
means, run a full page photo
spread and 13 stories on it. A
Niners victory doesn't come
every week, you know. They
lost twice last season.
Last year in the playoffs,
San Francisco blew out the
Minnesota Vikings and the Los
Angeles Rams — two very solid
teams — on their way to the
well-known 66-10 Domination
in the Dome.
The Niners, it seems, are
head and shoulders and waist
and kneecaps above any other
team in the NFL right now. It
has to do with the "best ever"
theory. Put together the best
ever quarterback (Joe Mon
tana) with the best-ever wide
receiver (Jerry Rice) with one
of the best-ever all-around run
