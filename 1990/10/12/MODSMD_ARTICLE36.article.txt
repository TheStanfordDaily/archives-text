## Palumbis has found health, success 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal is estatic about the
emergence of a bona-fide team leader.
For the first time in three years every
one knows who'll be taking the snaps
on Saturdays.
No one is happier than Jason
Palumbis.
Before getting the starting call this
spring, Palumbis played yo-yo at the
up-for-grabs quarterback position for
the past two years. He was a starter.
Then he wasn't.
He bounced to the depths of Stan
ford football before he found his way
back to the top.
You see, the Cardinal's starting sig
nal caller was fourth-string last sea

son. Not second. Not third. Fourth. As
in no-traveling-to-road-games fourth.
You can't sink much lower.
But it took last year for Palumbis to
realize that maybe the truth was the
best policy after all.
The honorable mention All-Ameri
can high school quarterback , known
for his arm strengh and accuracy, sep
arated his right shoulder his senior
year. But it just wasn't worth mention
ing to Stanford's coaching staff. It
would get better.
It hung in there for a while. He was
starting quarterback for the last seven
games of his redshirt-freshman sea
son, and did a decent job getting the
ball to receivers.
Then it deteriorated.
"I wasn't throwing great back when

[coach Denny] Green and his staff
came (spring ball '89)," Palumbis said.
"I don't know if they knew but it got so
bad I could barely throw the ball.
"Even when I was starting two
years ago my arm was bad. I think they
just knew something was wrong, but I
really didn't want to complain and look
like I was whining so I tried to just stay
quiet and keep plugging away."
He stayed so quiet that the new
coaching staff dropped him to official
bench warmer. And he sat and waited.
"I didn't know at all," said offensive
coordiator/quarterbacks coach Ron
Turner. "I had heard from other people
that he had a really strong firm coming
out of high school but when I got here
his technique wasn't good, and I
thought his mechanism was really bad.

But he wouldn't tell me."
The coaching staff, and Stanford
fans, just thought Palumbis couldn't
throw anymore. By the time he told
Green what was going on, it was a
wonder he could raise his right arm,
not to mention loft a pigskin 30 yards.
"I'm not quite sure if the coaches
knew [how bad it was]. By the time I
had surgery I had no cartiledge in my
arm. I had bone spurs all over my clav
icle. Dr. Bunce, a past Ail-American
quarterback here, cut off part of my
clavicle and cleaned out my shoulder
[Nov. 28]," Palumbis said.
Obviously the results have been
positive.
