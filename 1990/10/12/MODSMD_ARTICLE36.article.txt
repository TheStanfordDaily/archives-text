## Palumbis has found health, success 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal is estatic about the
emergence of a bona-fide team leader.
For the first time in three years every
one knows who'll be taking the snaps
on Saturdays.
No one is happier than Jason
Palumbis.
Before getting the starting call this
spring, Palumbis played yo-yo at the
up-for-grabs quarterback position for
the past two years. He was a starter.
Then he wasn't.
He bounced to the depths of Stan
ford football before he found his way
back to the top.
You see, the Cardinal's starting sig
nal caller was fourth-string last sea

son. Not second. Not third. Fourth. As
in no-traveling-to-road-games fourth.
You can't sink much lower.
But it took last year for Palumbis to
realize that maybe the truth was the
best policy after all.
The honorable mention All-Ameri
can high school quarterback , known
for his arm strengh and accuracy, sep
arated his right shoulder his senior
year. But it just wasn't worth mention
ing to Stanford's coaching staff. It
would get better.
It hung in there for a while. He was
starting quarterback for the last seven
games of his redshirt-freshman sea
son, and did a decent job getting the
ball to receivers.
Then it deteriorated.
"I wasn't throwing great back when

[coach Denny] Green and his staff
came (spring ball '89)," Palumbis said.
"I don't know if they knew but it got so
bad I could barely throw the ball.
"Even when I was starting two
years ago my arm was bad. I think they
just knew something was wrong, but I
really didn't want to complain and look
like I was whining so I tried to just stay
quiet and keep plugging away."
He stayed so quiet that the new
coaching staff dropped him to official
bench warmer. And he sat and waited.
"I didn't know at all," said offensive
coordiator/quarterbacks coach Ron
Turner. "I had heard from other people
that he had a really strong firm coming
out of high school but when I got here
his technique wasn't good, and I
thought his mechanism was really bad.

But he wouldn't tell me."
The coaching staff, and Stanford
fans, just thought Palumbis couldn't
throw anymore. By the time he told
Green what was going on, it was a
wonder he could raise his right arm,
not to mention loft a pigskin 30 yards.
"I'm not quite sure if the coaches
knew [how bad it was]. By the time I
had surgery I had no cartiledge in my
arm. I had bone spurs all over my clav
icle. Dr. Bunce, a past Ail-American
quarterback here, cut off part of my
clavicle and cleaned out my shoulder
[Nov. 28]," Palumbis said.
Obviously the results have been
positive.
For the first time since John Paye

led Stanford to the Gator Bowl
during the 1987 season, the "tra
ditional quarterback school" has
one No. 1 quarterback.
And Palumbis is doing a more
than-adequate-job filling the role.
In addition to leading Stanford
past then No. 1-ranked Notre
Dame at South Bend last week
end, the junior has the confidence
of his coaches and teammates. No
one is wondering what is going to
happen in the middle this year.
"This season he's definitely the
leader of the team; he's definitely
the quarterback, and there are
questions — that's something we
haven't had in quite a while. Ever
since John Paye graduated after
the Gator Bowl it's been a lottery
on how many guys would start.
It's nice to see the position solid
ify, and it's kind of nice to know
there's one guy, and he's doing the
right things," said offensive guard
Chuck Gillingham.
"He's having a great year,"
Green said. "He's been playing
really solid and has good poise and
accuracy."
He has also been posting the
numbers.
While it took Palumbis a few
games to get rolling — no surprise
after he hadn't played a down for
an entire season — his statistics
have become quite sufficient. In
fact, they're rather impressive.
In five games he's 107-of-152
for 1151 yards. That's a 230 yard
per -game average. Toss in four
touchdowns, and you've got some
pretty decent stats.
In fact, his 70 percent comple
tion percentage is on par with
Stanford greats Steve Dils and
Turk Schonert.
"Jason is really making a lot of
progress," Green said. "He has a
good grasp of the offense, and he
knows exactly what he's supposed
to do. He has a good feel for what
the defense is doing and is doing a
good job recognizing man from
zone coverage."
The quarterback confidence
has returned. Not only is
Palumbis sure that he can move
the Cardinal 80 yards every time
he takes the field, so is the rest of
the team.
"We're confident accross the
board, and obviously Jason's a big
part of that because he gets the
ball in the right guys' hands,"

Gillingham said. "Compared with
two years ago he's matured a lot
as a quarterback and as an
individual, and that's nice to see."
Some, however, have ques
tioned Palumbis's ability to throw
deep. While he was recruited out
of Lake Oswego, Ore. for his great
arm, the lean, dark-haired quar
terback didn't throw a pass over
10 yards during the first four
games. A five-yarder in the flat,
eight yards underneath, a shovel
pass to the fullback appeared to be
the pattern.
Was it because of the coverage?
Or was his arm just not strong
enough?
Notre Dame silenced the crit
ics. A 43-yarder to Ed McCaffrey
on first down. An 18-yarder to Jon
Pinckney on third-and-10. A 26-
yard cross pattern to McCaffrey
on third down with less than two
minutes remaining.
The ability, it seems, is there.
"He can get the ball there when
he needs to," Turner said. "Last
week he threw some intermediate
crossing routes. I knew he could
throw long but it was encouraging
nonetheless."
"Right now he's just being
smart and hitting the open guy."
"I don't see a lot of the reads
but from what I see out there the
ball is going to the guys in the
white hats' hands, and that's
what we need. We have a very sim
plistic view of the game as an
offensive lineman, and I really
like what he's doing right now so I
can't complain," Gillingham said.
The whole team really likes
what the personable Palumbis has
been doing, both on and off the
field. Not only is he leading the
Cardinal in the huddle, but he is
being given responsibility in the
planning stages and on the side
lines, although from talking to the
modest signal caller you would
never know.
Because for Palumbis, football
is the team. He may be important
in the Cardinal's functioning, but
the word "I" does not exist in the
quarterback's vocabulary.
He takes the concept of "we"
mentality to the extreme.
"I try to dwell on team confi
dence, not on individual confi
dence. I try to be a "we" player,"
Palumbis said. "My goals are team
goals. I try not to think about
individual things during the sea
son. I just try to think about the
team."
"He doesn't just talk it, he lives
it," Turner said. "He doesn't care
as long as we just get it in [the
endzone], It doesn't matter if he
doesn't have any touchdown
passes as long as we score."
So now that things are looking
up, what would Palumbis liked to
have done about that arm of his?
Would surgery earlier have
changed his whole career?

"If I could do it all over again I
would have had surgery in high
school. But if I could do it all over
again I wouldn't change a thing
because it made me a better per
son, and it made me realize what a
great game football is. It makes
me not take anything for granted
anymore. Every time I step even
onto the practice field I thank God
for giving me a second chance,"
Palumbis said.
"I'm just keeping the faith and
hoping things go our way."
It looks like the nice guy is
coming out on top this time.

"He's having a great year,"
Green said. "He's been playing
really solid and has good poise and
accuracy."
He has also been posting the
numbers.
While it took Palumbis a few
games to get rolling — no surprise
after he hadn't played a down for
an entire season — his statistics
have become quite sufficient. In
fact, they're rather impressive.
In five games he's 107-of-152
for 1151 yards. That's a 230 yard
per -game average. Toss in four
touchdowns, and you've got some
pretty decent stats.
In fact, his 70 percent comple
tion percentage is on par with
Stanford greats Steve Dils and
Turk Schonert.
"Jason is really making a lot of
progress," Green said. "He has a
good grasp of the offense, and he
knows exactly what he's supposed
to do. He has a good feel for what
the defense is doing and is doing a
good job recognizing man from
zone coverage."
The quarterback confidence
has returned. Not only is
Palumbis sure that he can move
the Cardinal 80 yards every time
he takes the field, so is the rest of
the team.
"We're confident accross the
board, and obviously Jason's a big
part of that because he gets the
ball in the right guys' hands,"

Gillingham said. "Compared with
two years ago he's matured a lot
as a quarterback and as an
individual, and that's nice to see."
Some, however, have ques
tioned Palumbis's ability to throw
deep. While he was recruited out
of Lake Oswego, Ore. for his great
arm, the lean, dark-haired quar
terback didn't throw a pass over
10 yards during the first four
games. A five-yarder in the flat,
eight yards underneath, a shovel
pass to the fullback appeared to be
the pattern.
Was it because of the coverage?
Or was his arm just not strong
enough?
Notre Dame silenced the crit
ics. A 43-yarder to Ed McCaffrey
on first down. An 18-yarder to Jon
Pinckney on third-and-10. A 26-
yard cross pattern to McCaffrey
on third down with less than two
minutes remaining.
The ability, it seems, is there.
"He can get the ball there when
he needs to," Turner said. "Last
week he threw some intermediate
crossing routes. I knew he could
throw long but it was encouraging
nonetheless."
"Right now he's just being
smart and hitting the open guy."
"I don't see a lot of the reads
but from what I see out there the
ball is going to the guys in the
white hats' hands, and that's
what we need. We have a very sim
plistic view of the game as an
offensive lineman, and I really
like what he's doing right now so I
can't complain," Gillingham said.
The whole team really likes
what the personable Palumbis has
been doing, both on and off the
field. Not only is he leading the
Cardinal in the huddle, but he is
being given responsibility in the
planning stages and on the side
lines, although from talking to the
modest signal caller you would
never know.
Because for Palumbis, football
is the team. He may be important
in the Cardinal's functioning, but
the word "I" does not exist in the
quarterback's vocabulary.
He takes the concept of "we"
mentality to the extreme.
"I try to dwell on team confi
dence, not on individual confi
dence. I try to be a "we" player,"
Palumbis said. "My goals are team
goals. I try not to think about
individual things during the sea
son. I just try to think about the
team."
"He doesn't just talk it, he lives
it," Turner said. "He doesn't care
as long as we just get it in [the
endzone], It doesn't matter if he
doesn't have any touchdown
passes as long as we score."
So now that things are looking
up, what would Palumbis liked to
have done about that arm of his?
Would surgery earlier have
changed his whole career?

"If I could do it all over again I
would have had surgery in high
school. But if I could do it all over
again I wouldn't change a thing
because it made me a better per
son, and it made me realize what a
great game football is. It makes
me not take anything for granted
anymore. Every time I step even
onto the practice field I thank God
for giving me a second chance,"
Palumbis said.
"I'm just keeping the faith and
hoping things go our way."
It looks like the nice guy is
coming out on top this time.
The Cardinal is estatic about the
emergence of a bona-fide team leader.
For the first time in three years every
one knows who'll be taking the snaps
on Saturdays.
No one is happier than Jason
Palumbis.
Before getting the starting call this
spring, Palumbis played yo-yo at the
up-for-grabs quarterback position for
the past two years. He was a starter.
Then he wasn't.
He bounced to the depths of Stan
ford football before he found his way
back to the top.
You see, the Cardinal's starting sig
nal caller was fourth-string last sea

son. Not second. Not third. Fourth. As
in no-traveling-to-road-games fourth.
You can't sink much lower.
But it took last year for Palumbis to
realize that maybe the truth was the
best policy after all.
The honorable mention All-Ameri
can high school quarterback , known
for his arm strengh and accuracy, sep
arated his right shoulder his senior
year. But it just wasn't worth mention
ing to Stanford's coaching staff. It
would get better.
It hung in there for a while. He was
starting quarterback for the last seven
games of his redshirt-freshman sea
son, and did a decent job getting the
ball to receivers.
Then it deteriorated.
"I wasn't throwing great back when

[coach Denny] Green and his staff
came (spring ball '89)," Palumbis said.
"I don't know if they knew but it got so
bad I could barely throw the ball.
"Even when I was starting two
years ago my arm was bad. I think they
just knew something was wrong, but I
really didn't want to complain and look
like I was whining so I tried to just stay
quiet and keep plugging away."
He stayed so quiet that the new
coaching staff dropped him to official
bench warmer. And he sat and waited.
"I didn't know at all," said offensive
coordiator/quarterbacks coach Ron
Turner. "I had heard from other people
that he had a really strong firm coming
out of high school but when I got here
his technique wasn't good, and I
thought his mechanism was really bad.

But he wouldn't tell me."
The coaching staff, and Stanford
fans, just thought Palumbis couldn't
throw anymore. By the time he told
Green what was going on, it was a
wonder he could raise his right arm,
not to mention loft a pigskin 30 yards.
"I'm not quite sure if the coaches
knew [how bad it was]. By the time I
had surgery I had no cartiledge in my
arm. I had bone spurs all over my clav
icle. Dr. Bunce, a past Ail-American
quarterback here, cut off part of my
clavicle and cleaned out my shoulder
[Nov. 28]," Palumbis said.
Obviously the results have been
positive.

led Stanford to the Gator Bowl

And Palumbis is doing a more
than-adequate-job filling the role.
In addition to leading Stanford
past then No. 1-ranked Notre
Dame at South Bend last week
end, the junior has the confidence
of his coaches and teammates. No
one is wondering what is going to
happen in the middle this year.
"This season he's definitely the

the quarterback, and there are

haven't had in quite a while. Ever
since John Paye graduated after
the Gator Bowl it's been a lottery

have done about that arm of his?
Would surgery earlier have
changed his whole career?

"If I could do it all over again I
would have had surgery in high
school. But if I could do it all over
again I wouldn't change a thing
because it made me a better per
son, and it made me realize what a
great game football is. It makes
me not take anything for granted
anymore. Every time I step even
onto the practice field I thank God
for giving me a second chance,"
Palumbis said.
"I'm just keeping the faith and
hoping things go our way."
It looks like the nice guy is
coming out on top this time.
The Cardinal is estatic about the
emergence of a bona-fide team leader.
For the first time in three years every
one knows who'll be taking the snaps
on Saturdays.
No one is happier than Jason
Palumbis.
Before getting the starting call this
spring, Palumbis played yo-yo at the
up-for-grabs quarterback position for
the past two years. He was a starter.
Then he wasn't.
He bounced to the depths of Stan
ford football before he found his way
back to the top.
You see, the Cardinal's starting sig
nal caller was fourth-string last sea

son. Not second. Not third. Fourth. As
in no-traveling-to-road-games fourth.
You can't sink much lower.
But it took last year for Palumbis to
realize that maybe the truth was the
best policy after all.
The honorable mention All-Ameri
can high school quarterback , known
for his arm strengh and accuracy, sep
arated his right shoulder his senior
year. But it just wasn't worth mention
ing to Stanford's coaching staff. It
would get better.
It hung in there for a while. He was
starting quarterback for the last seven
games of his redshirt-freshman sea
son, and did a decent job getting the
ball to receivers.
Then it deteriorated.
"I wasn't throwing great back when

[coach Denny] Green and his staff
came (spring ball '89)," Palumbis said.
"I don't know if they knew but it got so
bad I could barely throw the ball.
"Even when I was starting two
years ago my arm was bad. I think they
just knew something was wrong, but I
really didn't want to complain and look
like I was whining so I tried to just stay
quiet and keep plugging away."
He stayed so quiet that the new
coaching staff dropped him to official
bench warmer. And he sat and waited.
"I didn't know at all," said offensive
coordiator/quarterbacks coach Ron
Turner. "I had heard from other people
that he had a really strong firm coming
out of high school but when I got here
his technique wasn't good, and I
thought his mechanism was really bad.

But he wouldn't tell me."
The coaching staff, and Stanford
fans, just thought Palumbis couldn't
throw anymore. By the time he told
Green what was going on, it was a
wonder he could raise his right arm,
not to mention loft a pigskin 30 yards.
"I'm not quite sure if the coaches
knew [how bad it was]. By the time I
had surgery I had no cartiledge in my
arm. I had bone spurs all over my clav
icle. Dr. Bunce, a past Ail-American
quarterback here, cut off part of my
clavicle and cleaned out my shoulder
[Nov. 28]," Palumbis said.
Obviously the results have been
positive.
For the first time since John Paye


Damlan Marhefka — Daily

terback tomorrow: the Trojan sophomore Todd Marinovich. With Marlnovich at the helm, the USC offense Is one of
the most lethal in the nation.
led Stanford to the Gator Bowl
during the 1987 season, the "tra
ditional quarterback school" has
one No. 1 quarterback.
And Palumbis is doing a more
than-adequate-job filling the role.
In addition to leading Stanford
past then No. 1-ranked Notre
Dame at South Bend last week
end, the junior has the confidence
of his coaches and teammates. No
one is wondering what is going to
happen in the middle this year.
"This season he's definitely the
leader of the team; he's definitely
the quarterback, and there are
questions — that's something we
haven't had in quite a while. Ever
since John Paye graduated after
the Gator Bowl it's been a lottery
on how many guys would start.
It's nice to see the position solid
ify, and it's kind of nice to know
there's one guy, and he's doing the
right things," said offensive guard
Chuck Gillingham.
"He's having a great year,"
Green said. "He's been playing
really solid and has good poise and
accuracy."
He has also been posting the
numbers.
While it took Palumbis a few
games to get rolling — no surprise
after he hadn't played a down for
an entire season — his statistics
have become quite sufficient. In
fact, they're rather impressive.
In five games he's 107-of-152
for 1151 yards. That's a 230 yard
per -game average. Toss in four
touchdowns, and you've got some
pretty decent stats.
In fact, his 70 percent comple
tion percentage is on par with
Stanford greats Steve Dils and
Turk Schonert.
"Jason is really making a lot of
progress," Green said. "He has a
good grasp of the offense, and he
knows exactly what he's supposed
to do. He has a good feel for what
the defense is doing and is doing a
good job recognizing man from
zone coverage."
The quarterback confidence
has returned. Not only is
Palumbis sure that he can move
the Cardinal 80 yards every time
he takes the field, so is the rest of
the team.
"We're confident accross the
board, and obviously Jason's a big
part of that because he gets the
ball in the right guys' hands,"

Gillingham said. "Compared with
two years ago he's matured a lot
as a quarterback and as an
individual, and that's nice to see."
Some, however, have ques
tioned Palumbis's ability to throw
deep. While he was recruited out
of Lake Oswego, Ore. for his great
arm, the lean, dark-haired quar
terback didn't throw a pass over
10 yards during the first four
games. A five-yarder in the flat,
eight yards underneath, a shovel
pass to the fullback appeared to be
the pattern.
Was it because of the coverage?
Or was his arm just not strong
enough?
Notre Dame silenced the crit
ics. A 43-yarder to Ed McCaffrey
on first down. An 18-yarder to Jon
Pinckney on third-and-10. A 26-
yard cross pattern to McCaffrey
on third down with less than two
minutes remaining.
The ability, it seems, is there.
"He can get the ball there when
he needs to," Turner said. "Last
week he threw some intermediate
crossing routes. I knew he could
throw long but it was encouraging
nonetheless."
"Right now he's just being
smart and hitting the open guy."
"I don't see a lot of the reads
but from what I see out there the
ball is going to the guys in the
white hats' hands, and that's
what we need. We have a very sim
plistic view of the game as an
offensive lineman, and I really
like what he's doing right now so I
can't complain," Gillingham said.
The whole team really likes
what the personable Palumbis has
been doing, both on and off the
field. Not only is he leading the
Cardinal in the huddle, but he is
being given responsibility in the
planning stages and on the side
lines, although from talking to the
modest signal caller you would
never know.
Because for Palumbis, football
is the team. He may be important
in the Cardinal's functioning, but
the word "I" does not exist in the
quarterback's vocabulary.
He takes the concept of "we"
mentality to the extreme.
"I try to dwell on team confi
dence, not on individual confi
dence. I try to be a "we" player,"
Palumbis said. "My goals are team
goals. I try not to think about
individual things during the sea
son. I just try to think about the
team."
"He doesn't just talk it, he lives
it," Turner said. "He doesn't care
as long as we just get it in [the
endzone], It doesn't matter if he
doesn't have any touchdown
passes as long as we score."
So now that things are looking
up, what would Palumbis liked to
have done about that arm of his?
