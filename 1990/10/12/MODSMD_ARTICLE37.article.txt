um.
RECORDS — Stanford (2-3, 1-1 Pac-10
play), USC (4-1, 1-1 in the Pac-10).
MATCHUP — Stanford, coming off a
36-31 shocker over No. 1 Notre
Dame, is on quite a high. USC, after
demolishing Washington State last
weekend, is looking to bring the Car
dinal crashing to earth. It is a must-win
situation on either end as both
squads have already lost a confer
ence game and both are looking to
remain in the race. The game is es
pecially crucial for the Trojans as they
were favored to win the Pac-10 and
cannot afford to lose another game
if they are to have a shot at the title.
Stanford wants to prove Notre Dame
ya7oq not a fVuko
HIGHLIGHTING - Jason Palumbis, the
steady man at the helm for the Car
dinal, proved last weekend not only
that his arm is back but that he can
execute under pressure. He's only
getting better. "Big" Ed McCaffrey
is his favorite receiver, and is on pace
to snag some All-American honors as
well. He will be severely challenged
by USC's potent secondary. Even
with the early departure of lineback
er/roamer Junior Seau to the NFL
the Trojans don't give up much
through the air.
