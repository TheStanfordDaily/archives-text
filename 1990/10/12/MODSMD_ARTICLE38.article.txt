# Cardinal spikers annihilate Gaels
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Four years ago, St. Mary's was
a Division II team. Last night,
Stanford made them wish that
they still were.
The Cardinal (12-2, 8-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play) over
whelmed St. Mary's in the first
round of the Stanford Invitational
Tournament, 15-4, 15-4, 15-12.
The team advances to the champi
onship match tonight against No.
2 (AVCA/Tachikara) Nebraska
which will be played at 8:00 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. The consola
tion match will precede it at 6:00
p.m.
With all respect, the match
wasn't even as close as the score.
At 13-2 of the second game, Stan
ford coach Don Shaw began to
gradually replace each of his
starters. Throughout most of
game three, sophomore Bev Oden,
junior Amy Cooper and co-captain
Kristin Klein watched from the
sidelines as Stanford's future
played out the game.
The future didn't look half bad.
Freshman Danielle Everett
recorded nine kills for a .563 hit
ting percentage, statistics that
were identical to those of All-
American Klein on the night.
Standout setter Piper Hahn
excited the crowd with another
sizzling jump serve ace while set
ting about half the game. Reserve
middle blocker Nicole Appleman
continued to push for a starting
spot with a four block assist per
formance. Freshman Kathy Jur
gens provided the steady defen
sive work that has solidified her
role as the team's top backrow
substitute.
"I'm very excited about getting
a chance to play," Jurgens said. "I
thought we played pretty well."
The statistics indicate as much.
The Cardinal had seven players
hit over .300. The squad had 51
total kills in the three games and
recorded a .390 overall hitting
percentage. Stanford served four
aces and had 17 total block assists.
"We started out strong and
kept to the basics," setter Carrie
Feldman said. "Everyone did their
part."
The starters may have done
their part a little too well. With
the first team in, Stanford cruised
with effortless ease in games one
and two. The Cardinal tallied the
first four points of the match and
then blitzed the Gaels with an 11-
2 run. Cooper, who has been
streaking, aided the cause with
kills at 10-4, 11-4 and 12-4 of the
game. Cooper finished the night

with match highs of 10 kills and a
.571 hitting percentage.
Not to be overshadowed, Klein
turned up the volume in game
two, smashing balls at 3-0 and 5-
0. Stanford surged to a 6-0 lead
before surrendering a point. Klein
and Cooper pounded and pounded
until a 12-1 rotation error
awarded St. Mary's one of its few
points of the night. Shaw, how
ever, would have no more. He
stopped the fight before it got out
of hand and began to substitute
liberally.
Before long, the Cardinal was
playing a front line of Hahn (5-
foot-7), Jennifer Jackson (5-foot
-9) and Jodi Birk (5-foot-9). After
the Cardinal sealed game two,
even more unorthodox arrange
ments were used. In the middle of

A victory tonight would launch Stanford
up the national rankings and would
maintain the team's momentum as it
heads to UCLA next week.

the third game, Shaw played all
four freshmen and two sopho
mores simultaneously.
"It's a difficult situation for
them to be put into," Shaw said.
"They fought hard. It was nice."
The Cardinal continues to
streak against lesser competition.
The team has annihilated its last
four opponents in three-game
sweeps and has won 13 games in a
row. Stanford has won its last six
matches and is very seriously
threatening to move up the
national rankings. The Cardinal
has been fixed at No. 6 the entire
season.
Stanford's latest drive may be
closely related to the performace
of middle blocker Cooper. The 6-
foot-2 All-Pac-10 selection is hit
ting an unreal .660 in her last four

matches and is hitting .350 on the
year. She is coming off 1.000 and
.571 hitting performances and is
quickly gaining recognition as one
of the nation's best quick-hitters.
With Cooper, Stanford has four
starters hitting .320 or better on
the season. Setter Feldman is hit
ting .340, Oden is at .335 and
Klein is at .320. It is extremely
rare that a single team have more
than- one hitter above .300
throughout a season.
"It's wonderful playing with
hitters like these," Everett said.
"We're improving every day."
Stanford's next task may be its
biggest challenge of the year.
Nebraska (16-1) has been ranked
first or second all season and is
the only team that has defeated
UCLA this year. Nebraska is cur
rently ranked No. 1 by the NCAA.
The Cornhuskers have a vari
ety of options and an extremely
capable team leader. Setter Val
Novak is a first-team All-Ameri
can and is probably the most effec
tive setter in the nation. Novak
has several outstanding offensive

Stanford's women's volleyball team blew out the Gaels In Burnham Pavilion last night. But tonight they
must duel with the No. 1 Cornhuskers of Nebraska. Although they are 0-2 against top-three competition,
the Cardinal feel that they can fell the mighty tonight.
options. Hitter Janet Kruse, a
first team Ail-American, recorded
a .330 hitting percentage last sea
son. Junior Cris Hall is a 6-foot-2
outside hitter with power compa
rable to Klein's. Sophomore
Eileen Shannon led the team in
kills last year as a freshman and
last night hit a match-high .375 in
her squad's rout of Brigham
Young. Stephanie Thater, a 6-foot

2 sophomore, is a gifted blocker
and is among the nation's leaders
in hitting percentage.
Nebraska's major strength is
their blocking. Last night, the
Cornhuskers had 14 total blocks
in only three games against the
14-ranked Cougars. "They are
very good," Shaw said. "They are
strong, and they are disciplined. It
will be an interesting match."
Nebraska will be the third elite
team Stanford has faced this sea
son. The Cardinal has met both
UCLA and UOR losing in both
matches. A victory tonight would

launch Stanford up the national
rankings and would maintain the
team's momentum as it heads to
UCLA next week.
"Stanford is one of the best
teams in the country every year,"
Nebraska coach Terry Petit said.
"I don't think there will be any
secrets tonight."
Nebraska defeated BYU 15-10,
15-6, 15-6 last night to reach the
championship match. They were
led by Shannon who had 12 kills
and Hall who recorded 13. The
only squad that has beaten them
this season is UOP *
