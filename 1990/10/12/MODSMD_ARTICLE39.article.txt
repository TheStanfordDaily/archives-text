# Ballistic Jen Rowland 'rockets' through defenses
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
When senior Jennifer "Rocket" Row
land was a freshman, she used to laugh
with teammates about the Final Four.
Rowland could talk seriously about the
final four games of the season, the chance
of winning four games, or the final four
problems on a human biology test, but
talk of the Final Four of the NCAA
women's soccer tournament brought just
a knowing giggle from the young Stan
ford forward.
Nobody is laughing now.
"Elise (Edwards) and I used to laugh at
the Final Four, but now we have to take
ourselves seriously," said Rowland, one of
only four seniors on the team. "It's amaz
ing how much the program has improved
in four years,"
Stanford, 11-2 on the year and ranked
No. 9, tackles No. 5 Colorado College
Sunday in a game that can launch Row
land and the Cardinal ever closer to their
first-ever NCAA playoff berth. The kick

off at Stanford's Maloney Field is 2 p.m.
And after the Tigers leave town, Stan
ford must quickly re-load its scoring
guns. Monday at 3:30 the Cardinal host
William and Mary, another top-10 power
with hopes for NCAA tournament play.
"It will be tough playing two days in a
row," said Rowland, Stanford's only
senior forward and its prime breakaway
threat on the frontline. "We'll have to be
ready on Sunday and then — win or lose
— we have to prepare for the next team."
But if there is anyone in Stanford's
lineup who can battle for two straight
games it is Rowland. Although she is
listed as a forward, Stanford coach
Berhane Andeberhan often has her drop
ping back to a midfield position, but then
sprinting past the defense on attack. The
5-foot-4 speedster is most dangerous
when she is penetrating toward the goal
at the front-end of a Stanford attack.
Rowland, a human biology mqjor from
Sacramento, Calif., has overcome the Jen
Curse — the mysterious knee injuries
sustained by each of the team's four Jen

nifers — to score 32 career goals. Last
year she led the team with 13 goals,
despite missing the last three games of
the year after her knee injury, and was
named First Team All-Far West.
Rowland was nicknamed Rocket by
first-year coach Andeberhan her fresh
man year, and together they have pow
ered Stanford into the upper-echelons of
the soccer world. Rowland is quick to
share the credit with Andeberhan, who
quickly turned a mediocre program into a
contender.
"He's a senior now too, and he expects
more of the team — he has good reason
to," she said.
Andeberhan can't ask for more from
Rowland. The perfunctory Jen-knee
brace just recently tossed aside, she has
returned to her spunky play of old and is
second on the team with seven goals. And
she is glad to be rid of the brace, thank
you.
"It feels great," said Rowland, who
injured her knee Oct. 27 last year. "I'ro
just really happy to be able to play again."

The speedster is most
dangerous at the front
end of an attack.

And not only is Rowland playing again,
she is the quick-scoring threat for an
offense that has continued to improve its
punching power. Rowland pounded in two
goals as Stanford scored a total of eight
last weekend in wins over Texas Chris
tian and George Mason.
Wednesday in a come-from-behind 2-1
win at UC-Davis, Rowland fired a corner
kick to junior Elizabeth Joneschild, who
tied the game and got Stanford back on
track for the victory.
"We've worked on our offense," said
Rowland. "Berhane said we can score a
goal on any team in the nation. Before,
we'd try for a shutout and counter-attack
on offense, but now we expect more."

Stanford will need more than high
expectations to beat Colorado College
Sunday. The Tigers are a perennial NCAA
power and blanked Stanford 1-0 last year,
scoring in the closing minutes of over
time.
"They are a strong team all-around,"
said Rowland. "They lost a few All-Amer
icana to graduation, but they are still very
strong."
Rowland remembers the loss at Col
orado College because there were more
fans watching the women's soccer game
than the varsity football game that was
going on at the same time next door. But
it was also the first loss of the season for
the Cardinal, who went to Colorado Col
lege with a 6-0 record.
The loss to the Tigers started a three
game slide which was probably the differ
ence when 11-4-3 Stanford narrowly
missed the playoffs.
But Rocket doesn't expect a slide in
1990, and she wants to end her Stanford
career with a Final Four bang, not the
laughter of four years ago.

"He's a senior now too, and he expects
more of the team — he has good reason
to," she said.
Andeberhan can't ask for more from
Rowland. The perfunctory Jen-knee
brace just recently tossed aside, she has
returned to her spunky play of old and is
second on the team with seven goals. And
she is glad to be rid of the brace, thank
you.
"It feels great," said Rowland, who
injured her knee Oct. 27 last year. "I'ro
just really happy to be able to play again."

The speedster is most
dangerous at the front
end of an attack.

And not only is Rowland playing again,
she is the quick-scoring threat for an
offense that has continued to improve its
punching power. Rowland pounded in two
goals as Stanford scored a total of eight
last weekend in wins over Texas Chris
tian and George Mason.
Wednesday in a come-from-behind 2-1
win at UC-Davis, Rowland fired a corner
kick to junior Elizabeth Joneschild, who
tied the game and got Stanford back on
track for the victory.
"We've worked on our offense," said
Rowland. "Berhane said we can score a
goal on any team in the nation. Before,
we'd try for a shutout and counter-attack
on offense, but now we expect more."

Stanford will need more than high
expectations to beat Colorado College
Sunday. The Tigers are a perennial NCAA
power and blanked Stanford 1-0 last year,
scoring in the closing minutes of over
time.
"They are a strong team all-around,"
said Rowland. "They lost a few All-Amer
icana to graduation, but they are still very
strong."
Rowland remembers the loss at Col
orado College because there were more
fans watching the women's soccer game
than the varsity football game that was
going on at the same time next door. But
it was also the first loss of the season for
the Cardinal, who went to Colorado Col
lege with a 6-0 record.
The loss to the Tigers started a three
game slide which was probably the differ
ence when 11-4-3 Stanford narrowly
missed the playoffs.
But Rocket doesn't expect a slide in
1990, and she wants to end her Stanford
career with a Final Four bang, not the
laughter of four years ago.
When senior Jennifer "Rocket" Row
land was a freshman, she used to laugh
with teammates about the Final Four.
Rowland could talk seriously about the
final four games of the season, the chance
of winning four games, or the final four
problems on a human biology test, but
talk of the Final Four of the NCAA
women's soccer tournament brought just
a knowing giggle from the young Stan
ford forward.
Nobody is laughing now.
"Elise (Edwards) and I used to laugh at
the Final Four, but now we have to take
ourselves seriously," said Rowland, one of
only four seniors on the team. "It's amaz
ing how much the program has improved
in four years,"
Stanford, 11-2 on the year and ranked
No. 9, tackles No. 5 Colorado College
Sunday in a game that can launch Row
land and the Cardinal ever closer to their
first-ever NCAA playoff berth. The kick

off at Stanford's Maloney Field is 2 p.m.
And after the Tigers leave town, Stan
ford must quickly re-load its scoring
guns. Monday at 3:30 the Cardinal host
William and Mary, another top-10 power
with hopes for NCAA tournament play.
"It will be tough playing two days in a
row," said Rowland, Stanford's only
senior forward and its prime breakaway
threat on the frontline. "We'll have to be
ready on Sunday and then — win or lose
— we have to prepare for the next team."
But if there is anyone in Stanford's
lineup who can battle for two straight
games it is Rowland. Although she is
listed as a forward, Stanford coach
Berhane Andeberhan often has her drop
ping back to a midfield position, but then
sprinting past the defense on attack. The
5-foot-4 speedster is most dangerous
when she is penetrating toward the goal
at the front-end of a Stanford attack.
Rowland, a human biology mqjor from
Sacramento, Calif., has overcome the Jen
Curse — the mysterious knee injuries
sustained by each of the team's four Jen

nifers — to score 32 career goals. Last
year she led the team with 13 goals,
despite missing the last three games of
the year after her knee injury, and was
named First Team All-Far West.
Rowland was nicknamed Rocket by
first-year coach Andeberhan her fresh
man year, and together they have pow
ered Stanford into the upper-echelons of
the soccer world. Rowland is quick to
share the credit with Andeberhan, who
quickly turned a mediocre program into a
contender.
"He's a senior now too, and he expects
more of the team — he has good reason
to," she said.
