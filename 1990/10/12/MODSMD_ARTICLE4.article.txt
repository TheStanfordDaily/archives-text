# Alcohol law is already policy at other schools

While a federal law requiring universi
ties to ban illegal drug and alcohol use has
Stanford in a frenzy, other universities
have not even heard of it.
An informal survey of universities
nationwide shows that most are not really
affected by the Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act because their alcohol
policies already meet the requirements out
lined by the law.
University alcohol policy never clearly
prohibited underage drinking on campus
until Oct. 1, when the University passed a
policy that would comply with the national
law.
Stanford dorms have traditionally been
able to purchase alcohol with house funds.
But last week, Acting Director of Residen
tial Education Robin Hensley issued a
memo suggesting that resident assistants
and fellows ban the practice until decisions
on how to enforce and implement Stan
ford's new policy are made.
While Stanford has traditionally left the
responsibility for unlawful drinking with
the individual student, other schools' alco
hol policies have not been so liberal.

According to Dave Schafer, a senior at
Washington State University, "the thought
of buying alcohol with dorm funds [at
WSU] is unheard of."
While many here fear prohibiting the
purchase of alcohol by dorms may drive stu
dents to drink behind doors, that's just the
case at Washington State. Schafer said that
students 21 and over "must be in their
room with the door closed" if they drink,
and underage drinking is prohibited by
school policy.
Both the University of Southern Califor
nia and the University of Pennsylvania
have similar alcohol policies that prohibit
underage drinking, do not allow the pur
chase of alcohol with dorm funds and
require legal drinkers to stay behind closed
doors, students there said.
Penn senior Brent Mitchell said kegs are
not allowed in dorms, and students cannot
keep empty kegs or beer bottles in their
rooms, "even as decorations."
Schafer said at Washington State, stu
dents 21 and over are allowed no more than
half a case of beer or a standard bottle of
hard alcohol per room.
Several schools also have policies explic-
