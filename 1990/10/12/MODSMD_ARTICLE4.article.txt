# Alcohol law is already policy at other schools
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
While a federal law requiring universi
ties to ban illegal drug and alcohol use has
Stanford in a frenzy, other universities
have not even heard of it.
An informal survey of universities
nationwide shows that most are not really
affected by the Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act because their alcohol
policies already meet the requirements out
lined by the law.
University alcohol policy never clearly
prohibited underage drinking on campus
until Oct. 1, when the University passed a
policy that would comply with the national
law.
Stanford dorms have traditionally been
able to purchase alcohol with house funds.
But last week, Acting Director of Residen
tial Education Robin Hensley issued a
memo suggesting that resident assistants
and fellows ban the practice until decisions
on how to enforce and implement Stan
ford's new policy are made.
While Stanford has traditionally left the
responsibility for unlawful drinking with
the individual student, other schools' alco
hol policies have not been so liberal.

According to Dave Schafer, a senior at
Washington State University, "the thought
of buying alcohol with dorm funds [at
WSU] is unheard of."
While many here fear prohibiting the
purchase of alcohol by dorms may drive stu
dents to drink behind doors, that's just the
case at Washington State. Schafer said that
students 21 and over "must be in their
room with the door closed" if they drink,
and underage drinking is prohibited by
school policy.
Both the University of Southern Califor
nia and the University of Pennsylvania
have similar alcohol policies that prohibit
underage drinking, do not allow the pur
chase of alcohol with dorm funds and
require legal drinkers to stay behind closed
doors, students there said.
Penn senior Brent Mitchell said kegs are
not allowed in dorms, and students cannot
keep empty kegs or beer bottles in their
rooms, "even as decorations."
Schafer said at Washington State, stu
dents 21 and over are allowed no more than
half a case of beer or a standard bottle of
hard alcohol per room.
Several schools also have policies explic-
itly outlawing open containers of
alcohol in public places, even resi
dence halls.
Debra Luck, a sophomore at
Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, said RAs there "don't care
what you do behind closed doors,
but if you walk out in the hallway,
you put [the alcohol] in a cup"
rather than carry it in a can or
bottle, to be less conspicuous.
At schools prohibiting under
age drinking or public consump
tion of alcohol, the degree of
enforcement and severity of sanc
tions vaiy by both the school and
the character of individual RAs.
At Miami, many RAs "just look
the other way" when they see stu
dents violating the alcohol policy,
according to Luck.
"RAs tend to lose themselves

on weekends, especially if there's
going to be a big party in some
one's room," Luck said.
She said if a student is "being
really obvious" about illegal
drinking, an RA will usually issue
the student a warning.
At USC, "you can be written up
for underage drinking if you're
caught," USC junior Erin Nordby
said. If a student causes problems
such as inflicting bodily harm or
damaging property when drink
ing, she said the student may be
put on housing probation and
must perform community service.
Chris Vaughn, a senior at
Texas A & M University, said one
friend of his lived in a dorm where
the RA would use fire drills as an
opportunity to look for beer in the
rooms of underage drinkers.
He added that although "some
of them think they're cops, some
don't bother with it."
Vaughn said when a student is
caught violating the alcohol pol

icy, an RA may write the student
up. After three write-ups, the stu
dent goes before the school con
duct board, which decides upon
appropriate punishment â€”
including suspension in extreme
cases.
UC-Berkeley RAs "are more
along the lines of policing than
educating people not to drink,"
Berkeley senior Todd Diamond
said.
At Washington State, Schafer
said underage students caught
drinking alcohol may be written
up and then forwarded to a con
duct board, which then reviews
the case and decides the punish
ment, ranging from a warning to
20 hours of community service
work.
Schafer said students may be
expelled from the residence halls
for repeated violations.
Without the opportunity to
lawfully drink in the dorms, many
underage drinkers at campuses

choose to attend parties at frater
nity houses, some of which lie out
side university jurisdiction.
Luck said Miami administra
tors "leave the fraternities and
sororities alone." The 20 to 25 fra
ternity houses are all off-campus,
she said, and "everybody knows
when there's a frat party."
At USC fraternity parties
"there's tons of alcohol," Nordby
said. Fraternity members "are
supposed to be carding, but often
they're not."
Nordby added that most soror
ity houses at USC decide not to
buy alcohol with house funds, and
that under pressure from national
chapters, many fraternities are
following suit, even though "most
frats are upset" about it.
At Berkeley, Diamond said,
"you need an ID [21 or over] to
receive a bracelet, and a bracelet
is necessary to drink."
Diamond said fraternities

there are required to hire a bar
tending service for parties, and
that members of Berkeley's inter
fraternity council often patrol the
Greek system to make sure frater
nities are carding students.
At Miami, Luck said many
freshmen go to fraternities to
drink alcohol since they are not
allowed to in their dorms. In addi
tion, she said, "they drink in their
rooms, they just don't get
caught."
Before the federal law went
into effect, Grinnell College in
lowa had an alcohol policy similar
to Stanford's. Jessica Weisel, a
Grinnell senior, said that under
the former alcohol policy, "stu
dents were encouraged to obey
[state] law, but it was never
enforced."
While Grinnell must now
explicitly prohibit underage
drinking, Weisel said "drinking on
campus hasn't been changed."
