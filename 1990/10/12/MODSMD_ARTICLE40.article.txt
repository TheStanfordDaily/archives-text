# Hard-hitting Ronnie Lott takes his best shot at Greeks
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
The ancient Greeks were never
boring. They built beautiful tem
ples, invented the Olympics and
fought a lot of wars with the Per
sians and one another.
Unpredictable and interesting
were those Greeks. The Daily's
Greeks, though, are so truly trite
and banal that they might just put
you to sleep.
With six of the eight pigskin
prognosticators perilously
perched within one game of each
other, the group selected similarly
from side to side of the Greek grid.
About the only interesting
news is that the 49ers, owners of
many an NFL title, have laid a
semi-permanent claim to the
Guest Greek spot. Following
owner Eddie Deßartolo, who was
miserable last week, the Niners
offer safety Ronnie Lott this time
through.
A LJSC graduate, the unflap
pable Lott picked his alma mater
to end the Cardinal's win streak
at one. Given that Stanford hasn't
beaten the Trojans since Gerald
Ford was President, that seems
like a safe pick.

But...
Mark Rogowsky, who along
with Debbie Spander, is coming
off a 9-1 week, had a vision a week
ago. He saw the Cardinal evening
its record at 3-3 after upsetting
both Notre Dame and USC.
Unlikely? Perhaps, but a week ago
you'd never have believed Stan
ford would take out the Irish in
South Bend, Ind. Would you?
Since Cal beat the Spartans
and the Spartans beat the Cardi
nal and the Cardinal beat the for
mer-No. 1 Irish, a case could be
made that the Golden Bears are
the best team in the country.
Nah!
While the Greeks are unani
mous in selecting Washington to
take down Oregon, the Ducks
could pull the week's big surprise.
This Oregon team, as hard as it
may be to believe, is really quite
good. No, the Huskies aren't too
shabby either.
Cameron Macky gets the Head
Scratcher Award of the week by
selecting Missouri over Nebraska.
If the Tigers can't get a win when
they actually do beat Colorado,
how are they going to take out the
'Huskers?
