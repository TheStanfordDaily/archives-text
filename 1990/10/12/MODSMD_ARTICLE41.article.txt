# Booter Mann means business

When sophomore Randy Mann steps onto the soc
cer field, he is second to none.
"I hate being anything but the best," says Mann.
"That's my attitude, and it's got me to the level I'm
at."
Mann's attitude, in addition to his skill, has
allowed him to progressively to reach the apex of
U.S. soccer. Beginning in high school, a younger but
"just as driven" Mann made the Olympic Develop
ment Soccer Program's California State Squad.
Two years later, he was a member of the under
-18 U.S. National Squad and on his way to the Soviet
Union. While there, Mann experienced the sensation
of competing against Europe's best young players.
"The trip to the U.S.S,R. has been the highlight of
my career," explains Mann. "I haven't felt anything
like it since."
"Everywhere our team went, we were mobbed by
little kids who wanted our autographs," Mann con
tinues. "We got to play in full-size stadiums, and we
were watched by thousands of screaming fans. I
really felt like a professional athlete."
Mann followed his Soviet adventure with a suc
cessful tryout with the under-20 U.S. National
Squad. During his time with the under-20 team,
Mann played with the older, more experienced mem
bers of the U.S. National Team, where he augmented
his abilities.
"1 gained a lot of confidence playing with the
national team," relates Mann. "I also had the oppor
tunity to test my skills against some of our country's
greatest players. I now feel that I can play right up
there with the best."
Hopefully, Mann will play for the U.S. National

Squad in the near future. But currently, Mann has
an integral role as a leader of the Stanford squad.
His charisma has been essential in inspiring the Car
dinal players.
Freshman Terry Favazza attests, "Randy is
always out there encouraging us. His desire to win
spreads through the team like an epidemic, infecting
everybody."
Coach Colin Lindores also feels that Man's ability
"to verbalize his feelings" has been an important
factor in the team's success. Lindores, however, cites
several of Mann's other attributes as key to helping
lead the Cardinal.
"Randy impresses me because he's got that drive
that few athletes possess. He's also got incredible
instincts that few American soccer players have.
Most players are predictable. He's very creative,
making him unpredictable and much more exciting
to watch."
Finally, Lindores sees Mann's love for the game as
his most impressive attribute. "There's no doubt
about it — Randy just loves to play," says Lindores
in admiration. "And he doesn't take the game too
seriously. He just looks happy to be out on the field.
I think that side of him rubs off onto his team
mates."
With Mann's unique talents and some better
luck, the 5-4-5 Cardinal hope to achieve a playoff
berth. Their quest begins on Saturday when Stan
ford meets visiting Portland in what Lindores sees
as "a good test." But Mann sees it differently.
"We've got the ability to beat Portland, and I
think we will. We've started to play better. When the
playoffs come, we'll be there. And I think we'll sur
prise a lot of people."
