# Senior Maguy leads No. 3 Cardinal against No. 4 Trojans
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
He may not be the biggest, and
he may not be the fastest member
of the water polo team, but so far
this year, Chuck Maguy is cer
tainly showing that he is one of
the best players on the team.
As Coach Dante Dettamanti

said, "He doesn't have all the
great physical attributes that
some of the other players have,
but he manages to get the job
done. He works really hard in
there and does what he has to do.
He is definitely tenacious."
Maguy, who is a senior, agrees
that he may not be the most tal
ented player on the team. "I'm not

as naturally gifted as some other
guys, but I try to overcome this by
working hard and using my
head."
Maguy has indeed done a great
job of overcoming his limitations,
as he has developed into one of the
leading scorers for the No. 3 Car
dinal.
"Chuck has become really con

sistent and has developed into one
of our leaders," Dettamanti said.
"It's gotten to the point where I
can count on him to score two or
three goals a game."
Coming out of high school in
Visalia, Ca., the 6-foot-3 inch,
190-pound Maguy was regarded
as a sleeper by Dettamanti. "He
wasn't one of our top recruits, but
I knew he had talent. I really did
not know what to expect from
him, so I certainly have been
pleasantly surprised."
After playing a reserve role his
first two years, Maguy really came
into his own last year as the first
man off the bench for the Cardi
nal. In his role as the "super-sub,"
Maguy was "the one who would
come into the game and spark up
the team," he said. He did such a
good job that he wound up with 39
goals, the fourth most on the
team.
Dettamanti is obviously
pleased with how Maguy has pro
gressed. "He's really worked his
way all the way up. His first year
or two, he made a lot of mental
mistakes, but now, he has learned
how to play the game and no
longer makes those mistakes. He
uses his head a lot and makes good
decisions and judgements in the
pool."
In addition, because he is not
as strong or big as some of his
opponents, Maguy feels he has
had to use his head even more. "I

know I'm not going to be able to
muscle people out of the way, so I
have to rely on all the experience
I've acquired and the little tricks
I've picked up along the way."
One of those tricks is lulling his
opponents into believing that he
just isn't that much of a threat in
the pool. "I'm not that fast a
swimmer, but I have deceptive
speed," he said. "If I have the ball
and no one is in front of me, then
there's no one who's going to
catch me."
That includes the referees, who
often don't see a lot of what goes
on underneath the water. As
Maguy explained, "That's what I
really like about water polo. It's
the only sport I know of that you
have the opportunity to physically
retaliate against someone without
getting caught. In water polo,
you're able to let the other guy
know you're there, and I like
that."
He continued. "Anyone can
swim up and down the pool, but to
swim with someone holding on to
you, well, that's a different story."
Maguy, who is majoring in eco
nomics, is also one of the team's
most-liked players. "He's just a
really good-natured guy," Detta
manti said. "He never gets down
and is always having fun out
there. He's one of the guys I'm
really going to miss when he
leaves here."

Someone else who is going to
miss Maguy is his younger
brother Bill, who is a freshman on
this year's team. "It's really fun to
be on the same team as him," Bill )
said. "He helps me out a lot and
always gets me up when I'm feel
ing down."
Dettamanti also knows that he i
can count on Maguy if the chips t.
are down for the Cardinal. "If we j
need a goal at the end of a game, I
know Chuck could do it for us.
He's just that type of a guy."
Card Notes
Saturday at 10:30 at deGuerre
pool, Stanford will take on No. 4 USC
in a prelim to the football game. Det- '
tamanti feels this is a must-win situa- ♦
tion for the Cardinal. "One of our »
goals is to win the Pac-10, and after
our loss to Cal, we can't afford ■«
another one. We weren't supposed to
beat Cal, but we are supposed to beat
USC, and we have to if we want to
accomplish the goals we all have."
USC has lost to No. 2 UCLA, who
beat the Cardinal 12-6, two times, but
both times the margin was only one
goal. Freshman Larry Bercutt will
start in goal for Stanford against the
powerful USC offense.
On Sunday at 12:00, the Cardinal
will host seventh-ranked Fresno
State. Stanford has already beaten
Fresno twice this year, by close scores
of 10-9 and 10-6.
