# Several fraternities and sororities to host non-alcoholic parties
## 
### Nicholas Hass 
Several sororities and fraternal organi
zations will host non-alcoholic parties next
weekend during National Collegiate Alco
hol Awareness Week, which begins Sunday.
The idea for dry parties was discussed
last year, and serious planning began this
fall. The Intersorority Council and Inter
fraternity Council are currently collecting
agreements from Stanford Greek chapters
"not to include alcoholic beverages in social
events" next week.
The pledge also "is to affirm our belief

that low-risk drinking practices, including
abstinence, are preferred methods of alco
hol-related experiences."
ISC President Erin Scalley, a senior, said
the organizations are concerned about
safety at parties where alcohol is served.
"Abstinence is obviously one way of having
safe parties," she said.
Fraternities are also concerned about
alcohol-related problems at parties, accord
ing to IFC President Erik Jorgensen, a
senior.
Both presidents expressed concern over
liability issues. In an effort to reduce alco

hol-related risks, the ISC and IFC have
agreed that representatives from all sorori
ties and fraternities must attend an alcohol
management program, Oct. 23, 24 and 30.
The program is the first step in gaining
certification from Project R 2 ISC, a part of
Cowell Health Promotions that attempts to
educate students about alcohol-related dan
gers. Fraternities and sororities must pre
sent a plan of how they will hold safe par
ties in order to be certified.
If not certified within a month, fraterni
ties will be unable to serve alcohol at par
ties. Sororities must be certified by winter

quarter in order to host parties.
Next week, some fraternities are hosting
dry parties, while others are postponing
parties until the awareness week is over,
Jorgensen said.
Scalley said the awareness week is a good
opportunity for students to see how enjoy
able dry parties can be.
According to Project R 2 ISC Director
Louise Miller, the awareness week is a
nationwide effort to show that a dry event
can be enjoyable and less dangerous than a
party with alcohol.
