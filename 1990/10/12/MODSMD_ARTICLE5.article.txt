# Stanford Police captain:
## New schoolwide alcohol policy won't affect police enforcement 
### Howard Libit 
Stanford Police have no plans to
increase enforcement of alcohol laws
despite new University and federal regu
lations prohibiting illegal use.
"Our position is not going to change
one bit," said Police Capt. Marvin Moore.
California laws "have always said that
it is illegal to drink or purchase alcohol if
you are under the age of 21, and we
enforce those laws," he added.
Beginning Oct. 1, the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act required
universities to prohibit the unlawful use
of alcohol and other drugs in order to con

tinue receiving federal funds.
Stanford has complied by enacting a
policy which states that alcohol and drug
use is illegal and students can be disci
plined for breaking alcohol and drug laws.
"We do not care about the University
posture," Moore said. "If a person under
the age of 21 is caught drinking alcohol or
if someone over the age of 21 purchases
alcohol for someone under it, something
will happen."
Police issue citations to hundreds of
students each year for violating local alco
hol laws, but a limited number of officers
cannot enforce alcohol laws everywhere
on campus, according to Moore.

We don't have the
resources to focus only on
underage drinking each
weekend.

"We do not have the resources to focus
only on underage drinking each weekend.
We have more important uses for the
resources," Moore said.
"Our philosophy is to individualize it.
If in the course of duties we catch under
age drinking, we will act on a case-by-case

individual basis," he continued.
Police do not enter houses and rooms
looking for alcohol without cause because
of "respect for individual's rights and pri
vacy," according to Moore.
This policy extends to dorm parties in
which resident assistants purchase alco
hol for students under 21.
"We will do as we have always done,"
said Moore. "If we find that students over
the age of 21 purchased alcohol for stu
dents under 21, we could prosecute them.
We will try to be fair and prefer to look at
the objective facts of each situation."
Moore said he believes the police
department and the University will com

municate more closely about alcohol law
violations.
"The University is now saying that
underage drinking is illegal," Moore said.
"They must now take a more active role
in prohibiting consumption of alcohol by
minors instead of the passive role they
have taken in the past."
Stanford officials, like the general pub
lic, have the right to examine police
records for citations of students over the
age of 18 who are cited for underage
drinking.
Moore said he believes some mecha-
