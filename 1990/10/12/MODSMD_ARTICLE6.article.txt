# Sexual assault specialist leaves
## Police captain maintains campus will remain safe for students 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
The departure of the Stanford
Police Department's sexual
assault specialist has created
some administrative shuffling
this fall, although campus police
and administrators are confident
the quality of investigations into
sexual assault cases will not suf
fer.
Sgt. Chris Lefferts, now at
Hastings Law School, came to
Stanford in October 1986, follow
ing 10 years of specializing in
investigating sexual assault
crimes in city police departments.
During his tenure at Stanford,
he held numerous positions rang
ing from patrol officer to supervi
sor of investigative services.
He was praised by campus
groups for bringing a high level of
expertise to the University's Sex

ual Assault Task Force in dealing
with issues of sex-related crime on
campus.
"There is going to be some loss
of experience, but I am confident
that [my former colleagues] can
and will do an excellent job," Lef
ferts said.
Stanford police officials said
their ability to handle assault
cases will not diminish.
"While Lefferts was very capa
ble, his departure is nothing
unusual," stressed Police Capt.
Marvin Moore. "If anyone leaves,
the quality of our services is not
going off the deep end. No organi
zation relies solely on one individ
ual."
Moore said officers 1 are trained
to develop investigative skills and
handle a broad range of campus
crimes ranging from burglary to
rape.
An officer lacking expertise in

any one area, such as sexual
assault, is sent to an investigative
school specializing in the neces
sary skills. After training, officers
are rotated throughout the
department as needed, Moore
added.
Echoing Moore, Pat Fabiano,
director of health promotions at
Cowell, said that Lefferts' depar
ture should only create a "tempo
rary shock" since Stanford police
are "highly sensitized to issues of
sexual assault on campus" and
quick "to correct any systemic
problems in assault investiga
tions."
Fabiano added, "The police are
so deeply committed that it will be
only a matter of time before
[Police Chief Marvin] Herrington
finds a way to pick up Chris'
work."
