# Sexual assault specialist leaves
## Police captain maintains campus will remain safe for students 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
The departure of the Stanford
Police Department's sexual
assault specialist has created
some administrative shuffling
this fall, although campus police
and administrators are confident
the quality of investigations into
sexual assault cases will not suf
fer.
Sgt. Chris Lefferts, now at
Hastings Law School, came to
Stanford in October 1986, follow
ing 10 years of specializing in
investigating sexual assault
crimes in city police departments.
During his tenure at Stanford,
he held numerous positions rang
ing from patrol officer to supervi
sor of investigative services.
He was praised by campus
groups for bringing a high level of
expertise to the University's Sex

ual Assault Task Force in dealing
with issues of sex-related crime on
campus.
"There is going to be some loss
of experience, but I am confident
that [my former colleagues] can
and will do an excellent job," Lef
ferts said.
Stanford police officials said
their ability to handle assault
cases will not diminish.
"While Lefferts was very capa
ble, his departure is nothing
unusual," stressed Police Capt.
Marvin Moore. "If anyone leaves,
the quality of our services is not
going off the deep end. No organi
zation relies solely on one individ
ual."
Moore said officers 1 are trained
to develop investigative skills and
handle a broad range of campus
crimes ranging from burglary to
rape.
An officer lacking expertise in

any one area, such as sexual
assault, is sent to an investigative
school specializing in the neces
sary skills. After training, officers
are rotated throughout the
department as needed, Moore
added.
Echoing Moore, Pat Fabiano,
director of health promotions at
Cowell, said that Lefferts' depar
ture should only create a "tempo
rary shock" since Stanford police
are "highly sensitized to issues of
sexual assault on campus" and
quick "to correct any systemic
problems in assault investiga
tions."
Fabiano added, "The police are
so deeply committed that it will be
only a matter of time before
[Police Chief Marvin] Herrington
finds a way to pick up Chris'
work."
However, LefTerts said he was
not fully certain his replacement,
Sgt. Dale Bandy, or other depart
ment officials could provide a
commensurate level of expertise
on assault issues, even with train
ing.
"The best type of preparation
for assault cases is actually con
fronting incidences through
which one gains experience in
handling the survivor while trying
to apprehend the criminal," he
continued.
He noted that Stanford's low
rate of reporting incidences of sex
ual assault makes it difficult for
officers to gain additional experi
ence in investigating such cases.
While casework experience is
important, having technically
competent workers can be just as

significant. "We can train techni
cal skills but we cannot train com
mon sense," Moore said.
Experience is not necessary to
having quality investigations, said
Moore, who noted that this sum
mer's case in which a woman was
raped in the Foothills was solved
after LefTerts' departure from the
force.
Sexual assault investigations
may not suffer without LefTerts,
but the campus community
stands to lose what Fabiano called
"an invaluable educator in issues
of sexual assault."
LefTerts played an active role in
the development of the Sexual
Assault Task Force Report, to be
released next month.
The report recommends
mandatory training for all people
who are likely to be sought out
immediately following a sexual
assault — particularly resident
fellows, resident assistants and
law enforcement authorities.

The report also urges survivors J
of sexual assault to recognize that
there is action that can be taken J
such as going to the authorities,
Lefferts added. He encouraged
survivors of rape to talk with
police, find out their options and
make informed decisions.
"Otherwise people will be oper
ating in the dark," Lefferts said.
Reflecting on his experiences at
Stanford, Lefferts noted a mud
dying conflict of interest between
the police's desire to bring the per
petrator of sexual assault to jus
tice and the University's goal to
educate perpetrators.
But the former sexual assault !
officer credited his previous train- !
ing at city police forces with giving j
him a clear picture of the potential '
role of law enforcement in assault „
cases.
"Lefferts has given the commu->J
nity a sense of the broad responsi-£
bilities of the police," Fabiano*
said.

some administrative shuffling
this fall, although campus police
and administrators are confident
the quality of investigations into
sexual assault cases will not suf
fer.
Sgt. Chris Lefferts, now at
Hastings Law School, came to
Stanford in October 1986, follow
ing 10 years of specializing in
investigating sexual assault
crimes in city police departments.
During his tenure at Stanford,
he held numerous positions rang
ing from patrol officer to supervi
sor of investigative services.
He was praised by campus
groups for bringing a high level of
expertise to the University's Sex

ual Assault Task Force in dealing
with issues of sex-related crime on
campus.
"There is going to be some loss
of experience, but I am confident
that [my former colleagues] can
and will do an excellent job," Lef
ferts said.
Stanford police officials said
their ability to handle assault
cases will not diminish.
"While Lefferts was very capa
ble, his departure is nothing
unusual," stressed Police Capt.
Marvin Moore. "If anyone leaves,
the quality of our services is not
going off the deep end. No organi
zation relies solely on one individ
ual."
Moore said officers 1 are trained
to develop investigative skills and
handle a broad range of campus
crimes ranging from burglary to
rape.
An officer lacking expertise in

any one area, such as sexual
assault, is sent to an investigative
school specializing in the neces
sary skills. After training, officers
are rotated throughout the
department as needed, Moore
added.
Echoing Moore, Pat Fabiano,
director of health promotions at
Cowell, said that Lefferts' depar
ture should only create a "tempo
rary shock" since Stanford police
are "highly sensitized to issues of
sexual assault on campus" and
quick "to correct any systemic
problems in assault investiga
tions."
Fabiano added, "The police are
so deeply committed that it will be
only a matter of time before
[Police Chief Marvin] Herrington
finds a way to pick up Chris'
work."
However, LefTerts said he was
not fully certain his replacement,
Sgt. Dale Bandy, or other depart
ment officials could provide a
commensurate level of expertise
on assault issues, even with train
ing.
"The best type of preparation
for assault cases is actually con
fronting incidences through
which one gains experience in
handling the survivor while trying
to apprehend the criminal," he
continued.
He noted that Stanford's low
rate of reporting incidences of sex
ual assault makes it difficult for
officers to gain additional experi
ence in investigating such cases.
While casework experience is
important, having technically
competent workers can be just as

significant. "We can train techni
cal skills but we cannot train com
mon sense," Moore said.
Experience is not necessary to
having quality investigations, said
Moore, who noted that this sum
mer's case in which a woman was
raped in the Foothills was solved
after LefTerts' departure from the
force.
Sexual assault investigations
may not suffer without LefTerts,
but the campus community
stands to lose what Fabiano called
"an invaluable educator in issues
of sexual assault."
LefTerts played an active role in
the development of the Sexual
Assault Task Force Report, to be
released next month.
The report recommends
mandatory training for all people
who are likely to be sought out
immediately following a sexual
assault — particularly resident
fellows, resident assistants and
law enforcement authorities.

The report also urges survivors J
of sexual assault to recognize that
there is action that can be taken J
such as going to the authorities,
Lefferts added. He encouraged
survivors of rape to talk with
police, find out their options and
make informed decisions.
"Otherwise people will be oper
ating in the dark," Lefferts said.
Reflecting on his experiences at
Stanford, Lefferts noted a mud
dying conflict of interest between
the police's desire to bring the per
petrator of sexual assault to jus
tice and the University's goal to
educate perpetrators.
But the former sexual assault !
officer credited his previous train- !
ing at city police forces with giving j
him a clear picture of the potential '
role of law enforcement in assault „
cases.
"Lefferts has given the commu->J
nity a sense of the broad responsi-£
bilities of the police," Fabiano*
said.
