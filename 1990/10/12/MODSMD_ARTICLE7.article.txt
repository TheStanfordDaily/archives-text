# Hope for cancer, AIDS patients
## Stanford-researched drugs may improve cure rates 
### Monica Uddin 
A set of experimental drugs,
currently being researched at
Stanford, is renewing hope for
the future of AIDS and cancer
patients by increasing the
body's production of white
blood cells.
Studies conducted by Dr.
Peter Greenberg, a Stanford
professor of medicine, are
largely responsible for this dra
matic treatment.
Greenberg and other
researchers have spent the last
15 years investigating what reg
ulates production of white blood
cells, the body's main defense
against disease and infection, in
the bone marrow
The drugs, known as G-CSF
and GM-CSF, have already been

found to cure children with con
genital, fatally-low levels of
white blood cells. G-CSF and
GM-CSF stand for granulocyte
colony stimulating factor and
granulocyte macrophage colony
stimulating factor, respectively.
Stimulating factors in the
drugs activate a part of the
white blood cells called neu
trophils. Neutrophils act as the
cell's first line of defense
against bacterial infection, and
thus prevent their destruction.
Because chemotherapy often
destroys both cancer cells and
white blood cells along with
other essential tissue, many
cancer patients are forced to
discontinue treatment to
decrease the risk of infection.
Some AIDS patients are also
susceptible to this phe

nomenon, as AZT, a drug used
to treat this disease, has been
found to decrease white cell
counts among its users.
However, the experimental
drugs help build white blood
cells and counteract the nega
tive effects of these treatments.
"With these drugs we can use
higher doses of chemotherapy
and AZT to improve cure rates,"
Greenberg confirmed.
"The main purpose [of the
drugs] is as an adjunct to stan
dard chemotherapy" and to
"treat patients to previously
unattainable levels," Greenberg
said.
Studies investigating the
drugs' potential in treating
patients in early stages of
leukemia are also currently
underway.
