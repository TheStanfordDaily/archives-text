About AutHtioii.
Exec. Chef Jeff Edelnuin
If good nut rition is the foundation for good health,
why would anyone not want to promote it? Perhaps
it's because if just isn't easy to combine good
nutrition with great cuisine.
After all, you have to use only the finest, freshest
ingredients. Then prepare them with a minimum of
oils and saturated fats (and be eager to respond to
special dietary requests). Arid finally, present the
kind of food critics rave about.
So why do we work so hard to make sure our cui
sine is as nutritious as possible? That's easy. We
want you around for a king time.
