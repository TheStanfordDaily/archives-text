Next time you see senior Rick
McNair walking around campus,
take a second look. There's more
star quality to this self-described
"very average guy" than he might
want you to thank.
McNair has been playing water
polo for seven years, first for his
high school team in Lafayette, and
now a few miles south on the
nationally third-ranked Stanford
squad. In that rather short time
span, McNair has become one of
the country's most feared oppo
nents in the pool.
Although McNair does not con
sider himself "a star," his phe
nomenal success as a water polo
player since his sophomore year
has earned him that status. In the
1988 and 1989 seasons, McNair
scored 87 goals and was an NCAA
Ail-American both as a sophomore
and junior. During his junior year,
he was one of only two collegiate
athletes on the U.S. National
Team.
With all of these credentials,
McNair cited last year's Big
Splash against California as his
best moment at Stanford. The
monumental 8-7 victory came

before nearly 2,000 fans, who had
gathered for the Big Game week
end to watch Stanford beat Cali
fornia, first in water polo, then in
football.
On a more personal level,
McNair jumped into the limelight
with his performance a year ear
lier as a sophomore. As a "wet
nosed kid," McNair scored three
goals in the 1988 Big Splash.
Despite Stanford's ultimate
defeat in the match, the moment
was memorable for McNair.
According to coach Dante Det
tamanti, McNair's sophomore
year was when he really began to
live up to his tremendous poten
tial. Both Dettamanti and McNair
said that motivational pressure
from the teacher spurred the
pupil into working harder and
more aggressively.
But this bona fide 1990 All-
America candidate was not always
such a comfortably secure phe
nomenon. Although since his
junior year in high school he was
"Stanford all the way," McNair
found adapting to the Farm as a
difficult transition.
