# Gordon powers into Cardinal gameplan
## 
### Andy Eiser 
Darrien Gordon is not "The
Flash," rather just a quiet guy in a
uniform. He's not unpopular, just
unassuming. As a matter of fact,
he could be the person occupying
the seat next to you in that cold
auditorium for Economics lecture
each morning at 9:00.
So even if you have not yet
awakened to the presence of Gor
don, a 6-foot, 183-pound left cor
nerback for the Cardinal football
team, off the field, you most likely
have seen No. 21 do battle on it.
Gordon, who was recruited out
of Shawnee, Okla., as a wide
receiver as well as a defensive
back, came to Stanford expecting
to influence the Cardinal's offen
sive play calls. Instead, after
spending what he called a "disap
pointing, wasted year" earning his
letter as a backup pass catcher, he
has spent the 1990 season alter
ing the formations of his oppo
nents.
And from the sound of things,
Gordon will be a fixture in Stan
ford's defense for a couple of years
to come.
Gordon reached a football pin
nacle of sorts in last Saturday's

thrilling 36-31 victory over Notre
Dame. Not only did he and his
defensive teammates thwart the
final comeback attempt of the
Fighting Irish, but Gordon also
had the pleasure of making his
first collegiate start in the sport's
most hallowed stadium.
"I was mesmerized, because
that is what college football is all
about," Gordon stated.
Even a minor elbow injury that
he incurred in the first quarter of
that contest could not keep him
from realizing his dreams to
become a big-time performer. "I
didn't miss a single play," said
Gordon. "In that situation, the
adrenaline just takes over."
This persistence has caught
the eye of Cardinal coaches over
the last two seasons. "We use him
on every defensive down," Coach
Denny Green said. "His quickness
and size are assets in our run sup
port, nickel and long yardage
packages."
Certainly, Gordon, even as an
all-state performer in his senior
year in high school, could not
have expected events to take such
a fortuitous turn in such a brief
span of time events which, to
be sure, will have a pronounced

effect upon the rest of his football
career.
The question then begs to be
asked: How did this strapping 19-
year-old evolve from idolizing the
powerful Oklahoma Sooners pro
gram as a child into the subject of
the admiration of many both in
his home state and in the Bay
Area?
Or, how did Gordon go from
idolizing one Heisman Trophy

winner (Billy Sims of the Sooners)
to attempting to stop a bona fide
Heisman candidate (quarterback
Todd Marinovich) in today's game
against USC?
Part of the answer lies in the
family tradition that the Gordons
have carved for themselves in the
football ranks. His cousin, Fred,
played for North Texas State and
the Oakland Raiders, while his
father saw college action and his
two older brothers were high
school standouts.
In fact, Gordon's father guided
him through his academic and
athletic ventures since his ele
mentary school and Pop Warner
days. According to Gordon, his
father is still quite simply "the
most influential person in my
life."
However, the other half of the
complex explanation for Gordon's
seemingly "sudden" emergence
on the Stanford football scene has
much to do with the player him
self.
Gordon is a subdued character,
yet one who is well-liked by his
teammates because of his
unselfishness and persistent will
ingness to contribute. He has
always enjoyed and been able to

handle the individual attention
that comes with being in the spot
light, yet he holds the team's goals
in high esteem as well.
While Notre Dame, his second
choice of schools, is located a lot
closer to his childhood home, Gor
don chose Stanford because of
both his familiarity with the cam
pus he has an uncle in Sacra
mento and his realization of
the importance of academic
achievement. He is looking at a
possible major in psychology.
Gordon stated that he also felt
as if he would "fit in" more com
fortably with the atmosphere of
the Stanford campus.
Last weekend, which for the
Cardinal was proof positive that it
is capable of defeating even the
most formidable opposition,
merely served to reaffirm, rather
than convince, Gordon that he
made the "right" decision in
attending Stanford.
"We feel that we can win all of
our remaining games in the Pac
-10 Conference and go to the Rose
Bowl," Gordon said.
Yet, as Confucius once philoso
phized, "a journey of a thousand


Darrien Gordon
miles begins with a single step."
That single step for the Cardinal
is this week's tilt with USC, and
Stanford's plans to defeat the
Trojans hinge in large part on
Gordon's ability to shut down
USC's running attack and the
quick "out" patterns that Mari
novich likes to throw.
When Gordon trots out on the
field for his first defensive series
today, he will put on hold his
intentions to become a two-time
Ail-American at his position, play
in the National Football League
for a few years, and open his own
business.
With his father on hand to wit
ness, Gordon will look exclusively

at giving the Cardinal a winning
record in Pac-10 play.
All of those other aspirations,
just like his pleasant classroom
and off-the-field persona, will
simply fade into the storied wood
work while the stadium clock
ticks away.

asked: How did this strapping 19-
year-old evolve from idolizing the
powerful Oklahoma Sooners pro
gram as a child into the subject of
the admiration of many both in
his home state and in the Bay
Area?
Or, how did Gordon go from
idolizing one Heisman Trophy

winner (Billy Sims of the Sooners)
to attempting to stop a bona fide
Heisman candidate (quarterback
Todd Marinovich) in today's game
against USC?
Part of the answer lies in the
family tradition that the Gordons
have carved for themselves in the
football ranks. His cousin, Fred,
played for North Texas State and
the Oakland Raiders, while his
father saw college action and his
two older brothers were high
school standouts.
In fact, Gordon's father guided
him through his academic and
athletic ventures since his ele
mentary school and Pop Warner
days. According to Gordon, his
father is still quite simply "the
most influential person in my
life."
However, the other half of the
complex explanation for Gordon's
seemingly "sudden" emergence
on the Stanford football scene has
much to do with the player him
self.
Gordon is a subdued character,
yet one who is well-liked by his
teammates because of his
unselfishness and persistent will
ingness to contribute. He has
always enjoyed and been able to

handle the individual attention
that comes with being in the spot
light, yet he holds the team's goals
in high esteem as well.
While Notre Dame, his second
choice of schools, is located a lot
closer to his childhood home, Gor
don chose Stanford because of
both his familiarity with the cam
pus he has an uncle in Sacra
mento and his realization of
the importance of academic
achievement. He is looking at a
possible major in psychology.
Gordon stated that he also felt
as if he would "fit in" more com
fortably with the atmosphere of
the Stanford campus.
Last weekend, which for the
Cardinal was proof positive that it
is capable of defeating even the
most formidable opposition,
merely served to reaffirm, rather
than convince, Gordon that he
made the "right" decision in
attending Stanford.
"We feel that we can win all of
our remaining games in the Pac
-10 Conference and go to the Rose
Bowl," Gordon said.
Yet, as Confucius once philoso
phized, "a journey of a thousand


Darrien Gordon
miles begins with a single step."
That single step for the Cardinal
is this week's tilt with USC, and
Stanford's plans to defeat the
Trojans hinge in large part on
Gordon's ability to shut down
USC's running attack and the
quick "out" patterns that Mari
novich likes to throw.
When Gordon trots out on the
field for his first defensive series
today, he will put on hold his
intentions to become a two-time
Ail-American at his position, play
in the National Football League
for a few years, and open his own
business.
With his father on hand to wit
ness, Gordon will look exclusively

at giving the Cardinal a winning
record in Pac-10 play.
All of those other aspirations,
just like his pleasant classroom
and off-the-field persona, will
simply fade into the storied wood
work while the stadium clock
ticks away.

With his father on
hand to witness,
Gordon will look

giving the Cardinal
a winning record in
Pac-10 play.
Darrien Gordon is not "The
Flash," rather just a quiet guy in a
uniform. He's not unpopular, just
unassuming. As a matter of fact,
he could be the person occupying
the seat next to you in that cold
auditorium for Economics lecture
each morning at 9:00.
So even if you have not yet
awakened to the presence of Gor
don, a 6-foot, 183-pound left cor
nerback for the Cardinal football
team, off the field, you most likely
have seen No. 21 do battle on it.
Gordon, who was recruited out
of Shawnee, Okla., as a wide
receiver as well as a defensive
back, came to Stanford expecting
to influence the Cardinal's offen
sive play calls. Instead, after
spending what he called a "disap
pointing, wasted year" earning his
letter as a backup pass catcher, he
has spent the 1990 season alter
ing the formations of his oppo
nents.
And from the sound of things,
Gordon will be a fixture in Stan
ford's defense for a couple of years
to come.
Gordon reached a football pin
nacle of sorts in last Saturday's

thrilling 36-31 victory over Notre
Dame. Not only did he and his
defensive teammates thwart the
final comeback attempt of the
Fighting Irish, but Gordon also
had the pleasure of making his
first collegiate start in the sport's
most hallowed stadium.
"I was mesmerized, because
that is what college football is all
about," Gordon stated.
Even a minor elbow injury that
he incurred in the first quarter of
that contest could not keep him
from realizing his dreams to
become a big-time performer. "I
didn't miss a single play," said
Gordon. "In that situation, the
adrenaline just takes over."
This persistence has caught
the eye of Cardinal coaches over
the last two seasons. "We use him
on every defensive down," Coach
Denny Green said. "His quickness
and size are assets in our run sup
port, nickel and long yardage
packages."
Certainly, Gordon, even as an
all-state performer in his senior
year in high school, could not
have expected events to take such
a fortuitous turn in such a brief
span of time events which, to
be sure, will have a pronounced

effect upon the rest of his football
career.
