# LSJUMB show cut short
## 
### Benjamin Myers 
Due to the enthusiastic student
response to our first preview of the
halftime hand show, the editors of
Cardinal Today have determined
to make this a weekly event. In
concern for the crowd's confusion
during the (short) halftime show,

we would like to offer our assis
tance in trying to figure out what
is happening on the turf.
Halftime (3 minutes. Count 'em.)
1) When jewelers want to reuse
old silver, they melt it down. And
while we hope that the Lone
Ranger's faithful horse didn't
meet a similar end, the fate of

Tommy Trojan's pathetic mount
is an entirely different matter.
Why set him out to stud when you
can send him to Mr. Elmer's
famous factory! With all due
respect to "Airplane!", "Looks like
I picked the right week to stop
sniffing glue."
Song: "Dead Man'B Party"
