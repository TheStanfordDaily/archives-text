# A 						Cardinal Glance into the Irish haven
## 
### Allen Thorpe 
Who cares if the game was a
week ago. Heck, we should milk
the Notre Dame victory for all it's
worth.

Call it luck or intuition, maybe
a gut feeling or something. Last
month when I bought my plane
ticket to Indiana for the Notre
Dame game, I knew the trip would
be worth the cost of my student
fare. Hell, we had just narrowly
missed upsetting Colorado and
looked poised to beat the Irish this
year. Never mind that three weeks
and two losses later, I was poised
to call the airline to cancel my
flight.
Luckily I didn't. Thanks to
Denny Green's "goddam Stanford
Cardinal,'' my pilgrimage to the
mecca of college football turned
into aij incredible weekend. Being
in Notre Dame Stadium for the
Cardinal's upset of the Fighting
Irish was dramatically different
from what we Stanford students
know as a "football game."
Although Stanford and Notre
Dame are a mere 2,000 miles
apart geographically, there is
enough contrast between the two

places to consider them separate
worlds. For better and for worse,
the Notre Dame "experience" is
like nothing else. This is how
some of the basic differences
struck me on my very first (and
possibly last) trip into the Hoosier
State.
Palo Alto and South Bend
If you've ever complained
about the nightlife in Palo Alto,
stay away from South Bend. From
the moment I was welcomed to
town by a huge billboard bearing
Mayor Joe Kernan's cheesy grin, I
knew this town was different
from anything in the South Bay.
This is a place where there is a
church every 20 yards, and where
the streets are named things like
Main, Olive, Lincoln and Birch
(those are the big ones). Excite
ment in the land of Bird means
three kids in black Chuck Taylors
shooting hoops into a basket
nailed to the wall.
This is where your grandma
and grandpa live, not where you'd
put a major university. How does
South Bend see itself? The South
Bend Tribune has a large mural
which proclaims this place, "A
Perfect Hometown." 'Nuff said.

Picnicking and tailgating
Fans and alumni from both
schools seem equally adept at the
ritualistic pregame festivities of
food and grog, yet there is a slight
difference in its implications. In
Stanford's Chuck Taylor Grove,
you'll see a wine-tasting extrava
ganza complete with tablecloths,
catered finger foods and filet
mignon.
In the Notre Dame parking lot,
you'll see a big blue bus called
"The Gipper II" and a gaudy
green and gold "Irish Express"
with a small caricature of "St. Lou
[Holtz]" on the side. Irish flags fly
high and the locals drink plenty of
beer with their corned beef.
I even saw three or four old
alumni nerds dressed up like lep
rechauns. If any Stanford alums
dressed up like a tree they would
be laughed out of Palo Alto and
probably the state of California.
The stadiums
Stanford Stadium can't hold a
candle to the Irish's home field.
Notre Dame Stadium is small, but
since it doesn't have a track, the
stands are almost on top of the
field (fans in the end zones are

close enough to touch the play
ers), and there isn't a bad seat in
the house (even for students). It
gets so loud that it's easy to forget
there are only 60,000 seats in the
place.
Our fans and their fans
This is a joke. I'm sure it made
our players a little jealous when
they heard the Notre Dame
crowd. These are the people who
cheer wildly when their team
takes the field after an opponent's
touchdown.
If a player makes even the
slightest gesture of encourage
ment to the crowd, the place
erupts. It was a wonder to see
people were actually paying atten
tion to the entire game. Besides
that, they have good cheerleaders
who lead the whole stadium in
chants. Gosh, if our fans could
ever ... um, right.
LSJUMB and the Fightin'
Irish Band
Their band is brutal. They
have about 400 people in it and
sound almost as loud as a sixth
grade orchestra. Decked out in
cute little scarfs, they march
poorly and act like dorks on the
sidelines, and they aren't even
drunk. I say, if you're going to

have a band the size of a small
Midwestern town, at least be loud
and obnoxious.
Religious Mosaics
I wasn't sure what to expect
from Notre Dame's infamous
monument, Touchdown Jesus,
but I was very underwhelmed.
The thing is really kind of dumb
and I couldn't even see it from my
seat. I've also got to question its
effectiveness: either Derek Brown
isn't Catholic or Touchdown
Jesus wasn't looking.
Hoover Tower and The
Golden Dome
Tough call on the phallic sym
bols. We've got height but they've
got that confident glow.
The Campuses
Notre Dame is a beautiful place
as long as you wind up there dur
ing one of the two weeks of the
year when the weather is not mis
erably horrendous. Transplanted
to anywhere outside of the Mid
west, Notre Dame would be a very
enticing place to attend footba...
uh, classes.

policy. He hates John Wagner.

poorly and act like dorks on the
sidelines, and they aren't even
drunk. I say, if you're going to

have a band the size of a small
Midwestern town, at least be loud
and obnoxious.
Religious Mosaics
I wasn't sure what to expect
from Notre Dame's infamous
monument, Touchdown Jesus,
but I was very underwhelmed.
The thing is really kind of dumb
and I couldn't even see it from my
seat. I've also got to question its
effectiveness: either Derek Brown
isn't Catholic or Touchdown
Jesus wasn't looking.
Hoover Tower and The
Golden Dome
Tough call on the phallic sym
bols. We've got height but they've
got that confident glow.
The Campuses
Notre Dame is a beautiful place
as long as you wind up there dur
ing one of the two weeks of the
year when the weather is not mis
erably horrendous. Transplanted
to anywhere outside of the Mid
west, Notre Dame would be a very
enticing place to attend footba...
uh, classes.

Allen Thorpe is a junior in public
policy. He hates John Wagner.
Who cares if the game was a
week ago. Heck, we should milk
the Notre Dame victory for all it's
worth.

Call it luck or intuition, maybe
a gut feeling or something. Last
month when I bought my plane
ticket to Indiana for the Notre
Dame game, I knew the trip would
be worth the cost of my student
fare. Hell, we had just narrowly
missed upsetting Colorado and
looked poised to beat the Irish this
year. Never mind that three weeks
and two losses later, I was poised
to call the airline to cancel my
flight.
Luckily I didn't. Thanks to
Denny Green's "goddam Stanford
Cardinal,'' my pilgrimage to the
mecca of college football turned
into aij incredible weekend. Being
in Notre Dame Stadium for the
Cardinal's upset of the Fighting
Irish was dramatically different
from what we Stanford students
know as a "football game."
Although Stanford and Notre
Dame are a mere 2,000 miles
apart geographically, there is
enough contrast between the two

places to consider them separate
worlds. For better and for worse,
the Notre Dame "experience" is
like nothing else. This is how
some of the basic differences
struck me on my very first (and
possibly last) trip into the Hoosier
State.
Palo Alto and South Bend
If you've ever complained
about the nightlife in Palo Alto,
stay away from South Bend. From
the moment I was welcomed to
town by a huge billboard bearing
Mayor Joe Kernan's cheesy grin, I
knew this town was different
from anything in the South Bay.
This is a place where there is a
church every 20 yards, and where
the streets are named things like
Main, Olive, Lincoln and Birch
(those are the big ones). Excite
ment in the land of Bird means
three kids in black Chuck Taylors
shooting hoops into a basket
nailed to the wall.
This is where your grandma
and grandpa live, not where you'd
put a major university. How does
South Bend see itself? The South
Bend Tribune has a large mural
which proclaims this place, "A
Perfect Hometown." 'Nuff said.

Picnicking and tailgating
Fans and alumni from both
schools seem equally adept at the
ritualistic pregame festivities of
food and grog, yet there is a slight
difference in its implications. In
Stanford's Chuck Taylor Grove,
you'll see a wine-tasting extrava
ganza complete with tablecloths,
catered finger foods and filet
mignon.
In the Notre Dame parking lot,
you'll see a big blue bus called
"The Gipper II" and a gaudy
green and gold "Irish Express"
with a small caricature of "St. Lou
[Holtz]" on the side. Irish flags fly
high and the locals drink plenty of
beer with their corned beef.
I even saw three or four old
alumni nerds dressed up like lep
rechauns. If any Stanford alums
dressed up like a tree they would
be laughed out of Palo Alto and
probably the state of California.
The stadiums
Stanford Stadium can't hold a
candle to the Irish's home field.
Notre Dame Stadium is small, but
since it doesn't have a track, the
stands are almost on top of the
field (fans in the end zones are

close enough to touch the play
ers), and there isn't a bad seat in
the house (even for students). It
gets so loud that it's easy to forget
there are only 60,000 seats in the
place.
Our fans and their fans
This is a joke. I'm sure it made
our players a little jealous when
they heard the Notre Dame
crowd. These are the people who
cheer wildly when their team
takes the field after an opponent's
touchdown.
If a player makes even the
slightest gesture of encourage
ment to the crowd, the place
erupts. It was a wonder to see
people were actually paying atten
tion to the entire game. Besides
that, they have good cheerleaders
who lead the whole stadium in
chants. Gosh, if our fans could
ever ... um, right.
LSJUMB and the Fightin'
Irish Band
Their band is brutal. They
have about 400 people in it and
sound almost as loud as a sixth
grade orchestra. Decked out in
cute little scarfs, they march
poorly and act like dorks on the
sidelines, and they aren't even
drunk. I say, if you're going to

have a band the size of a small
Midwestern town, at least be loud
and obnoxious.
