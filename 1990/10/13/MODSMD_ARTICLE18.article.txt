The Stanford football victory
last weekend against No. 1-
ranked Notre Dame has caused a
wave of excitement to sweep over
the Stanford community. Return
ing as heroes from South Bend,
Ind., the football team has gained
respect from students, staff and
faculty alike.
Shocked and ecstatic, Stanford
football fans have quickly forgot
ten the generally pessimistic sen
timent that existed toward the
football team only a week ago.
"It's natural to 'jump on the
bandwagon' when a team that is
associated with you has a victory
of such magnitude," senior Dan
Chin said. "Whether or not you
follow the football team, you find
yourself associated with a win
ner."
The rise in student support for
the Stanford football team serves
more than one purpose. It is a nat
ural reaction to an outstanding
accomplishment, yet it also acts as
a indication of how little support
actually existed before last Satur
day.
"I think people really do care,
they were just frustrated," Chin
said. "Stanford students are in
general serious about their
schoolwork and do not tend to
make a priority of spending three
to four hours watching their team
lose."
Two last-second losses and a 1-
3 record going into the Notre

Dame game had left fans disap
pointed. A winning season was
seemingly out of reach. Now all
eyes are on the football team with
expectations of beating USC this
weekend.
The problem is that old losing
attitudes die hard.
"Honestly, I think the victory
against Notre Dame was lucky,"
junior Megyn Price said. Stanford
coach Denny Green, however, sees
it a different way.
"I don't think it was luck,"
Green said. "Notre Dame is a very
calculating team. They take
advantage of people who don't
know exactly what they want to
do. We went out there knowing
what we wanted."
Though some feel that a
chance to play in the Rose Bowl
this year is a little far-fetched,
Stanford students have recently
been heard shouting "Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!". The rise of confi
dence in the Stanford football
team has "lifted everybody's spir
its," says acting athletic director
Alan Cummings.
"The success of our athletic
teams at Notre Dame last week
end (men's and women's swim
ming and tennis) left Stanford 5-
0. We proved that we have the best
athletic teams in the country."
The swimmers and tennis play
ers that competed at Notre Dame
were among the 5,000 Stanford
fans at the football game.
"It was definitely a once-in-a
lifetime experience," senior tennis
player Glen Solomon said. "To be
there watching our team beat the
No. 1-ranked team in the country
at Notre Dame was enough. But
to be there with other Stanford
students on the swimming and

tennis teams made it all the more
special."
Senior swimmer Jody Smith
was ecstatic, but not surprised by
the Stanford victory.
"I knew they were a good team
and that they could do it," Smith
said. "I'm glad they finally proved
what they are capable of doing."
Teammate Janet Evans, who

among other swimmers was sit
ting in the Notre Dame section,
said that the Stanford students
"went crazy when Stanford
started catching up."
"I've never been so nervous
about a football game," Evans
admitted. She pinpoints her
excitement for the victory in the
fact that "Stanford was breaking
a tradition in beating Notre
Dame." The Irish have not been
beaten at home since the 1985-86
season.
"It took a lot of heart to pull a
victory like that," Chin added.
"We've given away a lot of games
in the last quarter. This game we
turned the tables."
In terms of revenue, a success
ful football team means a stronger
athletic department. There is an
expected increase of 20,000 fans
for this week's home game against
USC. But Cummings claims that

the increase in student support
outweighs the financial aspects of
winning a football game.
"Financially, it helps when you
win, but that is not the first prior
ity in regards to excitement,"
Cummings said.
"That's one thing we can learn
from the Notre Dame crowd,"
Smith said. "Even when their
team was down, the Notre Dame
crowd was cheering. Being there
and seeing the support from their
crowd made us realize that we
should be the same."
Green agrees that the excite
ment over the victory against
Notre Dame should translate into
enthusiasm at home games.

"The enthusiasm and atmo
sphere in the stadium is very
important," Green said. "The
team is very conscious of the
buzzing in the crowds, the excite
ment when the players come out
and the anticipation that things
will work out. It's very important
for the players to know that they
have support."
Thus we come to the moral of
Stanford's story against Notre
Dame.
"It is OK to hop on the band
wagon, but fans have to stick with
it (supporting the team even when
it is down)," Smith said. "They
have to carry their support
through and keep it constant."

"That's one thing we can learn
from the Notre Dame crowd,"
Smith said. "Even when their
team was down, the Notre Dame
crowd was cheering. Being there
and seeing the support from their
crowd made us realize that we
should be the same."
Green agrees that the excite
ment over the victory against
Notre Dame should translate into
enthusiasm at home games.

"The enthusiasm and atmo
sphere in the stadium is very
important," Green said. "The
team is very conscious of the
buzzing in the crowds, the excite
ment when the players come out
and the anticipation that things
will work out. It's very important
for the players to know that they
have support."
Thus we come to the moral of
Stanford's story against Notre
Dame.
"It is OK to hop on the band
wagon, but fans have to stick with
it (supporting the team even when
it is down)," Smith said. "They
have to carry their support
through and keep it constant."

The Stanford football victory
last weekend against No. 1-
ranked Notre Dame has caused a
wave of excitement to sweep over
the Stanford community. Return
ing as heroes from South Bend,
Ind., the football team has gained
respect from students, staff and
faculty alike.
Shocked and ecstatic, Stanford
football fans have quickly forgot
ten the generally pessimistic sen
timent that existed toward the
football team only a week ago.
"It's natural to 'jump on the
bandwagon' when a team that is
associated with you has a victory
of such magnitude," senior Dan
Chin said. "Whether or not you
follow the football team, you find
yourself associated with a win
ner."
The rise in student support for
the Stanford football team serves
more than one purpose. It is a nat
ural reaction to an outstanding
accomplishment, yet it also acts as
a indication of how little support
actually existed before last Satur
day.
"I think people really do care,
they were just frustrated," Chin
said. "Stanford students are in
general serious about their
schoolwork and do not tend to
make a priority of spending three
to four hours watching their team
lose."
Two last-second losses and a 1-
3 record going into the Notre

Dame game had left fans disap
pointed. A winning season was
seemingly out of reach. Now all
eyes are on the football team with
expectations of beating USC this
weekend.
The problem is that old losing
attitudes die hard.
"Honestly, I think the victory
against Notre Dame was lucky,"
junior Megyn Price said. Stanford
coach Denny Green, however, sees
it a different way.
"I don't think it was luck,"
Green said. "Notre Dame is a very
calculating team. They take
advantage of people who don't
know exactly what they want to
do. We went out there knowing
what we wanted."
Though some feel that a
chance to play in the Rose Bowl
this year is a little far-fetched,
Stanford students have recently
been heard shouting "Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!". The rise of confi
dence in the Stanford football
team has "lifted everybody's spir
its," says acting athletic director
Alan Cummings.
"The success of our athletic
teams at Notre Dame last week
end (men's and women's swim
ming and tennis) left Stanford 5-
0. We proved that we have the best
athletic teams in the country."
The swimmers and tennis play
ers that competed at Notre Dame
were among the 5,000 Stanford
fans at the football game.
"It was definitely a once-in-a
lifetime experience," senior tennis
player Glen Solomon said. "To be
there watching our team beat the
No. 1-ranked team in the country
at Notre Dame was enough. But
to be there with other Stanford
students on the swimming and

tennis teams made it all the more
special."
Senior swimmer Jody Smith
was ecstatic, but not surprised by
the Stanford victory.
"I knew they were a good team
and that they could do it," Smith
said. "I'm glad they finally proved
what they are capable of doing."
Teammate Janet Evans, who

among other swimmers was sit
ting in the Notre Dame section,
said that the Stanford students
"went crazy when Stanford
started catching up."
"I've never been so nervous
about a football game," Evans
admitted. She pinpoints her
excitement for the victory in the
fact that "Stanford was breaking
a tradition in beating Notre
Dame." The Irish have not been
beaten at home since the 1985-86
season.
"It took a lot of heart to pull a
victory like that," Chin added.
"We've given away a lot of games
in the last quarter. This game we
turned the tables."
In terms of revenue, a success
ful football team means a stronger
athletic department. There is an
expected increase of 20,000 fans
for this week's home game against
USC. But Cummings claims that

the increase in student support
outweighs the financial aspects of
winning a football game.
"Financially, it helps when you
win, but that is not the first prior
ity in regards to excitement,"
Cummings said.
"That's one thing we can learn
from the Notre Dame crowd,"
Smith said. "Even when their
team was down, the Notre Dame
