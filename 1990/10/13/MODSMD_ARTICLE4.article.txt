# Green looking to slow down USC backfield
## 
### T.C.Hall Editorial staff 
Twelfth-ranked USC presents
Stanford with a Catch-22 in
today's crucial Pacific 10 Confer
ence showdown.
The Trojans come into Stan
ford Stadium today with the
vaunted quarterback man-child
Todd Marinovich, a player who
has the capability to shred the
already swiss-cheese Cardinal sec
ondary. Yet USC also has a back
field that features Ail-American
candidate Ricky Ervins and a sec
ond stringer by the name of Mazio
Royster, whose 203 yards against
Washington State last week
proved that "backup" is a relative
term.
Stanford (2-3, 1-1 in the Pac
-10) has proven all season long
that it can defend the run, but if
they ignore the pass, Marinovich
will have a Heisman-hype field
day. Concentrate on the red
haired southpaw, and the Trojans
(4-1, 1-1) will plow through the
line for big gains. What is a coach
to do?
"I think for us to be successful
we have to stop the run," Stanford
head Coach Denny Green said. "I
don't give a damn what takes
place with the pass, you have to
stop the run in this conference.
Obviously we have to improve on
our pass defense, and our pass
rush and things like that, but I
think the first thing we have to do
is play very good run defense."
In other words, do what they
have been doing all year, which is
scary if you remember a guy
named Ralph Martini, the seem
ingly average San Jose State quar
terback whose 361 yards and four
touchdowns landed him in Sports
Illustrated as the offensive player
of the week. Stanford lost that
game, if anyone cares to remem
ber.
Stanford also lost to quarter
back Tommy Maddox, whoops,
UCLA in the last seconds of the
fourth quarter as the Cardinal
secondary gave the Bruin
receivers enough cushion to pad a
shuttle landing.
The same thing almost hap
pened in the all-world win last
weekend against Notre Dame, but
the no-luck Irish dropped the ball
in the end zone. It makes you
wonder if there is some kind of
pattern out there.
"I think it's that we are playing
a little too soft, in that I think we
are willing to give up too much,"

safety Jimmy Klein said. "I think
we really need to lay down the line
a little more, not give up the deep
pass, but you gotta play the
underneath routes a little bit."
Whatever the Cardinal does is
probably fine with Marinovich
because he can go long or short,
up and down, and probably side
ways too. What is scary about this
kid, and USC in general, is that he
will only be as good as he must.
Last week Marinovich was 14
of 19 for 159 yards, and for the
season is 79 of 126 for 935 yards,
good for fourth in the Pac-10. Not
god-like numbers, but when your
team picks up 307 rushing yards,
like the Trojans did against WSU,
you don't need to be Joe Montana
to win the football game.
Of course if your team falters
on the ground, as USC did for the
first part of the season, then you
go to the air. In the first three
games of the year USC only had
248 rushing yards, Marinovich on
the other hand had 657 passing
yards, including a career high 337
in the opener against Syracuse.
The good thing is that he is fal
lible, something he showed in
USC's 31-0 thrashing by the
Washington Huskies, provided
partly through Marinovich's 7-of

16, 80-yard, two-interception per
formance.
If USC is to win it cannot have
its quarterback virtuoso having
such an off-key day, which is
unlikely against a Cardinal
defense that is giving up an aver
age of 235.4 passing yards a game.
Not that head Coach Larry Smith
is worried. He is happy sticking
with his running game.
"Once you get a good thing
going, you might as well stay with
it," Smith said. "So it's back to
basics. We are going to to try to
run more and pass less."
Smith has reason to be confi
dent. After their dismal 248-yard
start, the Trojan backfield has
piled up 638 rushing yards in the
past two games. Included in this
total is 331 yards against Ohio
State, the nation's third-ranked
run defense at the time.
Tailback Ervins got 199 yards
before an ankle sprain took him
out of the game. Royster took his
place against WSU and got his
200-yarder, joining fullback Scott
Lackwood (102 yards) in breaking
the century mark.
What USC has to worry about
is that Stanford can be just as pro
lific offensively. The Cardinal will
not have more than one back

break 100 yards but will spread
things out and move the ball. The
Cardinal game plan is to bang the
ball into the end zone once inside
the 20-yard line.
The Cardinal has been inside
that mark 22 times this year and
has scored on 20 of those chances.
Eleven of those 20 scores have
been been due to "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell, a man that Green
is glad to have around.
"I have always felt that Tommy
Vardell was a tremendous player,"
Green said. "[Right now] he is
playing some great football, catch
ing some passes and controlling
the defense on the perimeter. He
is a complete football player; I
think he is ideally suited to the
type of offense we want to run
because of his target over the mid
dle and his blocking."
Close to the goal line, Vardell
has recorded his 11 touchdowns
from a total of 24 yards out
eight from 1 yard, and one each
from 3, 5 and 8 yards. The two
Stanford players responsible for
getting Vardell so close to the end
zone have been have been sopho
more Glyn Milburn and senior Ed
McCaffrey.
Milburn's 174.2 all-purpose
yards per game average is fifth in

the nation, while "Easy Ed" is
now the top rated receiver in the
land. McCaffrey's six receptions
last week brought his season aver
age to 8.5 catches a game, and his
111 reception yards solidified his
112..5 receiving yards per game
average.
"Ed is just playing so well, his
confidence and his timing are just
exceptional," Green said. "He is a
very complete player, very hard to
cover one-on-one, very hard to
tackle one-on-one."
The good news for Cardinal
fans is that as bad as the Stanford
defensive secondary is, the Tro
jans are actually worse. USC is
giving up an average of 237.4
passing yards a game, two more
than the Cardinal.
Also, according to the stats,
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis is better than Mari
novich. With Palumbis connecting
on 107 passes in 157 attempts for
a school record 70.4 passing per
centage, he is this week's second
ranked Pac-10 passer.
Hoping to stop the Cardinal's
balanced offensive threat is a Tro
jan defense that WSU head Coach
Mike Price says is having a
"reloading year" even though it
lost seven starters. Leading the
team in tackles is cornerback
Stephan Pace and linebacker Kurt
Barber with 34 each.
The 6-foot Pace will probably
have the unfortunate task of
guarding the 6-5 McCaffrey, but if
Butkus Award candidate Scott
Ross and Outland Trophy candi
date Mark Tucker have anything
to do with it, Palumbis won't get
any time to throw the ball.
As far as Denny Green is con
cerned though, you can forget the
Trojan defense, because his team
has proven all year long that they
can put points on the board. While
you are at it, you might as well
forget Marinovich, because as
Green has said before, he thinks
the key to winning this game will
be on the ground.
"USC has shown a new resolve
to run the football in the last two
games. Their passing yardage has
gone down in those two games and
they have played their best foot
ball of the year in those two
games," Green said.
"We have shown that we can
play good run defense. We will be
up against our biggest challenge
of the year, but I think we are
going to go out and be really ready
to meet that challenge."

total is 331 yards against Ohio
State, the nation's third-ranked
run defense at the time.
Tailback Ervins got 199 yards
before an ankle sprain took him
out of the game. Royster took his
place against WSU and got his
200-yarder, joining fullback Scott
Lackwood (102 yards) in breaking
the century mark.
What USC has to worry about
is that Stanford can be just as pro
lific offensively. The Cardinal will
not have more than one back

break 100 yards but will spread
things out and move the ball. The
Cardinal game plan is to bang the
ball into the end zone once inside
the 20-yard line.
The Cardinal has been inside
that mark 22 times this year and
has scored on 20 of those chances.
Eleven of those 20 scores have
been been due to "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell, a man that Green
is glad to have around.
"I have always felt that Tommy
Vardell was a tremendous player,"
Green said. "[Right now] he is
playing some great football, catch
ing some passes and controlling
the defense on the perimeter. He
is a complete football player; I
think he is ideally suited to the
type of offense we want to run
because of his target over the mid
dle and his blocking."
Close to the goal line, Vardell
has recorded his 11 touchdowns
from a total of 24 yards out
eight from 1 yard, and one each
from 3, 5 and 8 yards. The two
Stanford players responsible for
getting Vardell so close to the end
zone have been have been sopho
more Glyn Milburn and senior Ed
McCaffrey.
Milburn's 174.2 all-purpose
yards per game average is fifth in

the nation, while "Easy Ed" is
now the top rated receiver in the
land. McCaffrey's six receptions
last week brought his season aver
age to 8.5 catches a game, and his
111 reception yards solidified his
112..5 receiving yards per game
average.
"Ed is just playing so well, his
confidence and his timing are just
exceptional," Green said. "He is a
very complete player, very hard to
cover one-on-one, very hard to
tackle one-on-one."
The good news for Cardinal
fans is that as bad as the Stanford
defensive secondary is, the Tro
jans are actually worse. USC is
giving up an average of 237.4
passing yards a game, two more
than the Cardinal.
Also, according to the stats,
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis is better than Mari
novich. With Palumbis connecting
on 107 passes in 157 attempts for
a school record 70.4 passing per
centage, he is this week's second
ranked Pac-10 passer.
Hoping to stop the Cardinal's
balanced offensive threat is a Tro
jan defense that WSU head Coach
Mike Price says is having a
"reloading year" even though it
lost seven starters. Leading the
team in tackles is cornerback
Stephan Pace and linebacker Kurt
Barber with 34 each.
The 6-foot Pace will probably
have the unfortunate task of
guarding the 6-5 McCaffrey, but if
Butkus Award candidate Scott
Ross and Outland Trophy candi
date Mark Tucker have anything
to do with it, Palumbis won't get
any time to throw the ball.
As far as Denny Green is con
cerned though, you can forget the
Trojan defense, because his team
has proven all year long that they
can put points on the board. While
you are at it, you might as well
forget Marinovich, because as
Green has said before, he thinks
the key to winning this game will
be on the ground.
"USC has shown a new resolve
to run the football in the last two
games. Their passing yardage has
gone down in those two games and
they have played their best foot
ball of the year in those two
games," Green said.
"We have shown that we can
play good run defense. We will be
up against our biggest challenge
of the year, but I think we are
going to go out and be really ready
to meet that challenge."


Al Green — Daily file
For the Cardinal to win today it must break through the Trojan offensive line. Stanford's defense hopes
to spend a lot of time around USC quarterback Todd Marinovich this afternoon.
Twelfth-ranked USC presents
Stanford with a Catch-22 in
today's crucial Pacific 10 Confer
ence showdown.
The Trojans come into Stan
ford Stadium today with the
vaunted quarterback man-child
Todd Marinovich, a player who
has the capability to shred the
already swiss-cheese Cardinal sec
ondary. Yet USC also has a back
field that features Ail-American
candidate Ricky Ervins and a sec
ond stringer by the name of Mazio
Royster, whose 203 yards against
Washington State last week
proved that "backup" is a relative
term.
Stanford (2-3, 1-1 in the Pac
-10) has proven all season long
that it can defend the run, but if
they ignore the pass, Marinovich
will have a Heisman-hype field
day. Concentrate on the red
haired southpaw, and the Trojans
(4-1, 1-1) will plow through the
line for big gains. What is a coach
to do?
"I think for us to be successful
we have to stop the run," Stanford
head Coach Denny Green said. "I
don't give a damn what takes
place with the pass, you have to
stop the run in this conference.
Obviously we have to improve on
our pass defense, and our pass
rush and things like that, but I
think the first thing we have to do
is play very good run defense."
In other words, do what they
have been doing all year, which is
scary if you remember a guy
named Ralph Martini, the seem
ingly average San Jose State quar
terback whose 361 yards and four
touchdowns landed him in Sports
Illustrated as the offensive player
of the week. Stanford lost that
game, if anyone cares to remem
ber.
Stanford also lost to quarter
back Tommy Maddox, whoops,
UCLA in the last seconds of the
fourth quarter as the Cardinal
secondary gave the Bruin
receivers enough cushion to pad a
shuttle landing.
The same thing almost hap
pened in the all-world win last
weekend against Notre Dame, but
the no-luck Irish dropped the ball
in the end zone. It makes you
wonder if there is some kind of
pattern out there.
"I think it's that we are playing
a little too soft, in that I think we
are willing to give up too much,"

safety Jimmy Klein said. "I think
we really need to lay down the line
a little more, not give up the deep
pass, but you gotta play the
underneath routes a little bit."
Whatever the Cardinal does is
probably fine with Marinovich
because he can go long or short,
up and down, and probably side
ways too. What is scary about this
kid, and USC in general, is that he
will only be as good as he must.
Last week Marinovich was 14
of 19 for 159 yards, and for the
season is 79 of 126 for 935 yards,
good for fourth in the Pac-10. Not
god-like numbers, but when your
team picks up 307 rushing yards,
like the Trojans did against WSU,
you don't need to be Joe Montana
to win the football game.
Of course if your team falters
on the ground, as USC did for the
first part of the season, then you
go to the air. In the first three
games of the year USC only had
248 rushing yards, Marinovich on
the other hand had 657 passing
yards, including a career high 337
in the opener against Syracuse.
The good thing is that he is fal
lible, something he showed in
USC's 31-0 thrashing by the
Washington Huskies, provided
partly through Marinovich's 7-of

16, 80-yard, two-interception per
formance.
If USC is to win it cannot have
its quarterback virtuoso having
such an off-key day, which is
unlikely against a Cardinal
defense that is giving up an aver
age of 235.4 passing yards a game.
Not that head Coach Larry Smith
is worried. He is happy sticking
with his running game.
"Once you get a good thing
going, you might as well stay with
it," Smith said. "So it's back to
basics. We are going to to try to
run more and pass less."
Smith has reason to be confi
dent. After their dismal 248-yard
start, the Trojan backfield has
piled up 638 rushing yards in the
past two games. Included in this
total is 331 yards against Ohio
State, the nation's third-ranked
run defense at the time.
Tailback Ervins got 199 yards
before an ankle sprain took him
out of the game. Royster took his
place against WSU and got his
200-yarder, joining fullback Scott
Lackwood (102 yards) in breaking

The Trojans come into Stan
ford Stadium today with the
vaunted quarterback man-child
Todd Marinovich, a player who
has the capability to shred the
already swiss-cheese Cardinal sec
ondary. Yet USC also has a back
field that features Ail-American
candidate Ricky Ervins and a sec
ond stringer by the name of Mazio
Royster, whose 203 yards against
Washington State last week
proved that "backup" is a relative
term.
Stanford (2-3, 1-1 in the Pac
-10) has proven all season long
that it can defend the run, but if
they ignore the pass, Marinovich
will have a Heisman-hype field
day. Concentrate on the red
haired southpaw, and the Trojans
(4-1, 1-1) will plow through the
line for big gains. What is a coach
to do?
"I think for us to be successful
we have to stop the run," Stanford
head Coach Denny Green said. "I
don't give a damn what takes
place with the pass, you have to
stop the run in this conference.
Obviously we have to improve on
our pass defense, and our pass
rush and things like that, but I
think the first thing we have to do
is play very good run defense."
In other words, do what they
have been doing all year, which is
scary if you remember a guy
named Ralph Martini, the seem
ingly average San Jose State quar
terback whose 361 yards and four
touchdowns landed him in Sports
Illustrated as the offensive player
of the week. Stanford lost that
game, if anyone cares to remem
ber.
Stanford also lost to quarter
back Tommy Maddox, whoops,
UCLA in the last seconds of the
fourth quarter as the Cardinal
secondary gave the Bruin
receivers enough cushion to pad a
shuttle landing.
The same thing almost hap
pened in the all-world win last
weekend against Notre Dame, but
the no-luck Irish dropped the ball
in the end zone. It makes you
wonder if there is some kind of
pattern out there.
"I think it's that we are playing
a little too soft, in that I think we
are willing to give up too much,"

safety Jimmy Klein said. "I think
we really need to lay down the line
a little more, not give up the deep
pass, but you gotta play the
underneath routes a little bit."
Whatever the Cardinal does is
probably fine with Marinovich
because he can go long or short,
up and down, and probably side
ways too. What is scary about this
kid, and USC in general, is that he
will only be as good as he must.
Last week Marinovich was 14
of 19 for 159 yards, and for the
season is 79 of 126 for 935 yards,
good for fourth in the Pac-10. Not
god-like numbers, but when your
team picks up 307 rushing yards,
like the Trojans did against WSU,
you don't need to be Joe Montana
to win the football game.
Of course if your team falters
on the ground, as USC did for the
first part of the season, then you
go to the air. In the first three
games of the year USC only had
248 rushing yards, Marinovich on
the other hand had 657 passing
yards, including a career high 337
in the opener against Syracuse.
The good thing is that he is fal
lible, something he showed in
USC's 31-0 thrashing by the
Washington Huskies, provided
partly through Marinovich's 7-of

16, 80-yard, two-interception per
formance.
If USC is to win it cannot have
its quarterback virtuoso having
such an off-key day, which is
unlikely against a Cardinal
defense that is giving up an aver
age of 235.4 passing yards a game.
Not that head Coach Larry Smith
is worried. He is happy sticking
with his running game.
"Once you get a good thing
going, you might as well stay with
it," Smith said. "So it's back to
basics. We are going to to try to
run more and pass less."
Smith has reason to be confi
dent. After their dismal 248-yard
start, the Trojan backfield has
piled up 638 rushing yards in the
past two games. Included in this
total is 331 yards against Ohio
State, the nation's third-ranked
run defense at the time.
Tailback Ervins got 199 yards
before an ankle sprain took him
out of the game. Royster took his
place against WSU and got his
200-yarder, joining fullback Scott
Lackwood (102 yards) in breaking
the century mark.
What USC has to worry about
is that Stanford can be just as pro
lific offensively. The Cardinal will
not have more than one back

break 100 yards but will spread
things out and move the ball. The
Cardinal game plan is to bang the
ball into the end zone once inside
the 20-yard line.
The Cardinal has been inside
that mark 22 times this year and
has scored on 20 of those chances.
Eleven of those 20 scores have
been been due to "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell, a man that Green
is glad to have around.
"I have always felt that Tommy
Vardell was a tremendous player,"
Green said. "[Right now] he is
playing some great football, catch
ing some passes and controlling
the defense on the perimeter. He
is a complete football player; I
think he is ideally suited to the
type of offense we want to run
because of his target over the mid
dle and his blocking."
Close to the goal line, Vardell
has recorded his 11 touchdowns
from a total of 24 yards out
eight from 1 yard, and one each
from 3, 5 and 8 yards. The two
Stanford players responsible for
getting Vardell so close to the end
zone have been have been sopho
more Glyn Milburn and senior Ed
McCaffrey.
Milburn's 174.2 all-purpose
yards per game average is fifth in

the nation, while "Easy Ed" is
now the top rated receiver in the
land. McCaffrey's six receptions
last week brought his season aver
age to 8.5 catches a game, and his
111 reception yards solidified his
112..5 receiving yards per game
average.
"Ed is just playing so well, his
confidence and his timing are just
exceptional," Green said. "He is a
very complete player, very hard to
cover one-on-one, very hard to
tackle one-on-one."
The good news for Cardinal
fans is that as bad as the Stanford
defensive secondary is, the Tro
jans are actually worse. USC is
giving up an average of 237.4
passing yards a game, two more
than the Cardinal.
Also, according to the stats,
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis is better than Mari
novich. With Palumbis connecting
on 107 passes in 157 attempts for
a school record 70.4 passing per
centage, he is this week's second
ranked Pac-10 passer.
Hoping to stop the Cardinal's
balanced offensive threat is a Tro
jan defense that WSU head Coach
Mike Price says is having a
"reloading year" even though it
lost seven starters. Leading the
team in tackles is cornerback
Stephan Pace and linebacker Kurt
Barber with 34 each.
The 6-foot Pace will probably
have the unfortunate task of
guarding the 6-5 McCaffrey, but if
Butkus Award candidate Scott
Ross and Outland Trophy candi
date Mark Tucker have anything
to do with it, Palumbis won't get
any time to throw the ball.
As far as Denny Green is con
cerned though, you can forget the
Trojan defense, because his team
has proven all year long that they
can put points on the board. While
you are at it, you might as well
forget Marinovich, because as
Green has said before, he thinks
the key to winning this game will
be on the ground.
"USC has shown a new resolve
to run the football in the last two
games. Their passing yardage has
gone down in those two games and
they have played their best foot
ball of the year in those two
games," Green said.
"We have shown that we can
play good run defense. We will be
up against our biggest challenge
of the year, but I think we are
going to go out and be really ready
to meet that challenge."
