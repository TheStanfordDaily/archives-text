1975. The last year that the
Cardinal football team defeated
the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
1975. The last year that senior
strong safety Tuan Van Le lived
in Saigon, Vietnam.
During the past 15 years, the
performances of Stanford against
USC and the development of Van
Le have gone in entirely different
directions. But today the senior
strong safety will attempt to lead
Stanford on a path out of annual
despair with a victory over the No.
12 Trojans.
As a reserve behind sophomore
Jimmy Klein, Van Le has fought
to make a name for himself on the
Cardinal squad with his hard-hit
ting style. Van Le has received his
share of playing time in the nickel
defense, recording impressive
statistics thus far this season.
After Stanford's first five games,
Van Le, with 17 unassisted and six
assisted tackles, trails only sopho
more Seyon Albert and Klein in
total tackles out of the secondary.
Fifteen years ago, Van Le did
not have the opportunity to even
watch such athletic matchups,
much less have an active role
within them.
Born in 1968 in Saigon, Van Le
is the child of a black American
serviceman and a Vietnamese
restaurant owner.
"I never knew my father," Van
Le said. "I was told that he was
killed in the [Vietnam] War, but I
still do not know the truth."
Although his family life has
been divided with the lingering
question of his father and with his
two sisters who still remain in
Vietnam, Van Le's family means
everything to him.
"Not a day goes by where I do

not think of my family. I feel
proud when I make a big hit or a
big play, but I feel even better for
the pride that I have given my
family.
"My family is proud of who I
have become and for holding up
the family name. When they're
proud, I'm proud."
Raised by his mother who ran
two restaurants and four or five
bars, he spent his first seven years
just "playing and having fun" in
Saigon.
But as the United States forces
began to pull out of his homeland,
Van Le, along with his mother and
two uncles, sought a better life for
himself and fled Vietnam for the
United States "maybe a week
before the last forces were evacu
ated."
Van Le and his family moved
from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco before settling down in the
East Bay when he was about eight
years old.
Attending De La Salle High
School in Concord, Van Le played
beside former Stanford standout
Rob Hinckley (now with the
Detroit Lions), Jim Hinckley and
Chris Hawkins (both currently on
medical leave).
At De La Salle, Van Le led his
team to an undefeated season his
senior year en route to being
named USA Today Honorable
Mention All-America, Super Prep
All-Region, East Bay Player of the
Year and NorCal Player of the
Year.
After redshirting his freshman
year at Stanford under Coach
Jack Elway, Van Le shot upon the
football scene during the 1988 Big
Game matchup with California.
With four seconds remaining
and the score tied at 19-19, Cali
fornia's Robbie Keen was
attempting his fifth field goal of

the afternoon. But Keen's 20-yard
attempt was blocked by a diving
Van Le. Stanford preserved the tie
and held onto The Axe.
"Cal was too busy with big Rob
Hinckley to think about me," Van
Le said. "I timed it beautifully and
got the block with my name going
into the record books.
"When I look back, lending
that hand in Big Game history
was the greatest moment in my
career."
During most of his career at
Stanford, Van Le has seen the
majority of his action on special
teams with a backup role at
strong safety.
Despite not obtaining the
glamor of starting, he has no
qualms about special teams. "I
enjoy special teams the most
because as a regular defender you
always get an extra shot. On spe
cial teams, you only get one shot
and it's exciting.
"It's a team effort. There's a
time for me (on special teams) to
get my glory and for my friends,"
he said. "As long as I produce
when I am called upon, the most
important thing to me is the Big
'W.'"
Such a unique approach to
football is not uncharacteristic.
Van Le knows that he is different
and he is proud of it.

"Knowing that I am not fully
black— I am bi-racial I always
had to live somewhere where I
was not completely accepted," Van
Le said.
Van Le found himself hassled
by other children because of his
background, but now utilizes
those experiences to move beyond
difficult challenges.
"I look back upon that part of
my life and I appreciate where I
am: getting an education, playing
football, and enjoying life."
Enjoying life is a them for Van
Le's lifestyle that seems ominpre
sent.
He skateboards to class, carries
his cellular phone everywhere,
and dyes his hair red. People often
think that he is trying to support
an image with his phone, but Van
Le vehemently denies it.
"I worked hard this summer
and got used to using a cellular
phone. I liked using a cellular and
so I bought one," he commented.
"When people like a car, they go
out and buy one. I did the same. It
was not to look good."
For the same reasons, Van Le
plays hard-nosed, trash-talking
football. He plays because he
enjoys the challenge.
"Football is a fun sport and
when it becomes boring then it is
time for me to leave," he said.
Van Le has travelled an ardu
ous journey since his early days on
the streets of Saigon. Today he
hopes that Stanford will be able to
join him on the way up.

assisted tackles, trails only sopho
more Seyon Albert and Klein in
total tackles out of the secondary.
Fifteen years ago, Van Le did
not have the opportunity to even
watch such athletic matchups,
much less have an active role
within them.
Born in 1968 in Saigon, Van Le
is the child of a black American
serviceman and a Vietnamese
restaurant owner.
"I never knew my father," Van
Le said. "I was told that he was
killed in the [Vietnam] War, but I
still do not know the truth."
Although his family life has
been divided with the lingering
question of his father and with his
two sisters who still remain in
Vietnam, Van Le's family means
everything to him.
"Not a day goes by where I do

not think of my family. I feel
proud when I make a big hit or a
big play, but I feel even better for
the pride that I have given my
family.
"My family is proud of who I
have become and for holding up
the family name. When they're
proud, I'm proud."
Raised by his mother who ran
two restaurants and four or five
bars, he spent his first seven years
just "playing and having fun" in
Saigon.
But as the United States forces
began to pull out of his homeland,
Van Le, along with his mother and
two uncles, sought a better life for
himself and fled Vietnam for the
United States "maybe a week
before the last forces were evacu
ated."
Van Le and his family moved
from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco before settling down in the
East Bay when he was about eight
years old.
Attending De La Salle High
School in Concord, Van Le played
beside former Stanford standout
Rob Hinckley (now with the
Detroit Lions), Jim Hinckley and
Chris Hawkins (both currently on
medical leave).
At De La Salle, Van Le led his
team to an undefeated season his
senior year en route to being
named USA Today Honorable
Mention All-America, Super Prep
All-Region, East Bay Player of the
Year and NorCal Player of the
Year.
After redshirting his freshman
year at Stanford under Coach
Jack Elway, Van Le shot upon the
football scene during the 1988 Big
Game matchup with California.
With four seconds remaining
and the score tied at 19-19, Cali
fornia's Robbie Keen was
attempting his fifth field goal of

the afternoon. But Keen's 20-yard
attempt was blocked by a diving
Van Le. Stanford preserved the tie
and held onto The Axe.
"Cal was too busy with big Rob
Hinckley to think about me," Van
Le said. "I timed it beautifully and
got the block with my name going
into the record books.
"When I look back, lending
that hand in Big Game history
was the greatest moment in my
career."
During most of his career at
Stanford, Van Le has seen the
majority of his action on special
teams with a backup role at
strong safety.
Despite not obtaining the
glamor of starting, he has no
qualms about special teams. "I
enjoy special teams the most
because as a regular defender you
always get an extra shot. On spe
cial teams, you only get one shot
and it's exciting.
"It's a team effort. There's a
time for me (on special teams) to
get my glory and for my friends,"
he said. "As long as I produce
when I am called upon, the most
important thing to me is the Big
'W.'"
Such a unique approach to
football is not uncharacteristic.
Van Le knows that he is different
and he is proud of it.

"Knowing that I am not fully
black— I am bi-racial I always
had to live somewhere where I
was not completely accepted," Van
Le said.
Van Le found himself hassled
by other children because of his
background, but now utilizes
those experiences to move beyond
difficult challenges.
"I look back upon that part of
my life and I appreciate where I
am: getting an education, playing
football, and enjoying life."
Enjoying life is a them for Van
Le's lifestyle that seems ominpre
sent.
He skateboards to class, carries
his cellular phone everywhere,
and dyes his hair red. People often
think that he is trying to support
an image with his phone, but Van
Le vehemently denies it.
"I worked hard this summer
and got used to using a cellular
phone. I liked using a cellular and
so I bought one," he commented.
"When people like a car, they go
out and buy one. I did the same. It
was not to look good."
For the same reasons, Van Le
plays hard-nosed, trash-talking
football. He plays because he
enjoys the challenge.
"Football is a fun sport and
when it becomes boring then it is
time for me to leave," he said.
Van Le has travelled an ardu
ous journey since his early days on
the streets of Saigon. Today he
hopes that Stanford will be able to
join him on the way up.
