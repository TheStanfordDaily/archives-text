If USC superstar Todd Mari
novich is attempting to rid him
self of the Robo-Quarterback
image, the comments that he now
gives to the press certainly do not
help the cause.
The redshirt sophomore sensa
tion from Mission Viejo, Calif.,
enrolled at USC after being
chronicled in a 1988 Sports Illus
trated article depicting his sys
tematic development into the
most highly recruited quarter
back in the nation. The article
noted that Marinovich had never
eaten an Oreo, drank a Coke or
sipped a beer in concern for his
physical well-being.
"The whole 'Robo-QB' thing
has been going on since I was a
freshman in high school, but now
it's starting to fade," Marinovich
said. "Some people have said that
the whole training program was
what my dad wanted, that I was
bred to be a quarterback. But it
was really what I wanted for
myself... It's gratifying to know
that all the hard work was worth
it."

Now that his unparalleled ded
ication to sport has begun to pay
off, Marinovich offers the media
only responses which seem to
have been learned in a classroom
lecture on ways to handle press
conferences.
When asked to comment on
Stanford's shocking upset of No. 1
Notre Dame, Marinovich refused
to give the Cardinal coaches any
juicy locker room quotes. Rather,
he noted his respect for the Cardi
nal passing game.
"I wasn't really surprised by
the outcome," he said. "Any team
that can throw the ball can beat
Notre Dame."
Along similar lines, when
describing his decision to attend
USC instead of Stanford, Mari
novich did not offer Stanford any
insulting quotes.
Rather, he quietly explained
that both schools offered incredi
bly positive experiences, that for a
time he thought that Stanford
was his first choice and that he
had to face his "hardest meeting
ever" when he told former Cardi
nal coaches Jack Elway and


Ken Beer — Daily file
Trojan quarterback Todd Marinovich has been groomed to be a quarterback all his life. If he continues
on his current pace he will become the most prolific USC passer ever.
Jimmy Walsh that he had decided
to head south.
"I was a hair away from sign
ing up there," Marinovich said.
"The trip convinced me that SC
was the place to go. You have to go
with the decision and make the
best of it."
Marinovich faced rather monu
mental expectations to make the
best of when he stepped onto the
turf last season for his first game
as a Trojan.
As a senior at Capistrano Val
ley High, Marinovich finished his
career with a national-record
9,194 passing yards the only
high school thrower ever to
eclipse the 9,000-yard mark.
Along the way, Marinovich gar
nered nearly every award that
could have been imagined, includ
ing being recognized as USA
Today's Offensive Player of the
Year. By enrolling at perennial
national football power USC,
Marinovich knew he would have
to face the glare of the national
media examining his throwing
motion.
After redshirting his freshman
season behind current Detroit
Lion quarterback Rodney Peete
and learning from him how to
handle the pressures of college
football, Marinovich stepped into
the starting slot last season and
performed at a level unparalleled
by any newcomer to USC.
"If he keeps going the way he
has, he will be the quarterback
that all other quarterbacks at

USC are measured by," former
USC and Los Angeles Rams sig
nal-caller Pat Haden said earlier
this season.
As the first freshman quarter
back to start a USC season opener
since at least World War 11, he fin
ished the year with the second
best completion rate ever
recorded at USC.
In just one season, Marinovich
moved into the sixth position on
the all-time Trojan passing list,
was honored as the nation's top
freshman football player by UPI
and The Sporting News, and was
named as the first freshman quar
terback on the All-Pac-10 first
team since records were kept in
1952. Marinovich, as a sopho
more, was named by USA Today
as one of four preseason choices to
win the 1990 Heisman Trophy.
If he can duplicate his 1989
statistics, Marinovich will far out
distance every Trojan throwing
record in the books. This season,
he has already recorded stellar
performances against Syracuse,
Penn State and Washington State.
Against the Orangemen, Mari
novich threw for a career-high
337 yards and 3. touchdowns;
against Penn State, he had a 22-
of-34 afternoon for 240 yards and
one touchdown; against Washing
ton State last week, he equaled his
best performance ever, based on
completion percentage, by hitting
77.8 percent of his throws.
In five games, Marinovich has
recorded 79 completions, which
puts him two completions away
from moving into third place on
the list of all-time Trojan passing
leaders. On his current pace,
Marinovich will easily be in the

second position by the end of his
sophomore season.
"I never had any doubts I could
do it (effectively direct the USC
offense). I have a lot of confidence
in myself," Marinovich said.
However, against a powerful
Washington squad three weeks
ago, Marinovich struggled to an
uncharacteristic 7-of-16 perfor
mance with two interceptions.
After the 31-0 pummeling by
the Huskies, and after undoubt
edly his worst performance in a
Trojan uniform, Marinovich has
to be wondering if USC will be
able to make its fourth trip to the
Rose Bowl in a row.
"Anything can happen in the
Pac-10," Marinovich said. "We
have to be focused on winning our
next six games. If we lose another
game, we're out of the hunt."
For Marinovich, this aspect,
not his return to Stanford Sta
dium where he must have envi
sioned on his 1988 recruiting trip
throwing Elway-like passes, will
make today's game so important.
Like every other game, he realizes
that his opponents will be fired up
to bring him down.
"Whenever someone comes
into town or SC goes somewhere,
everyone (on the opposing team)
will be playing above their heads
and trying to beat the Trojans,"
he said.
At Washington, Marinovich, as
a football machine, malfunctioned
for one brief, uncharacteristic
moment. However, in front of
reporters, regardless of their mag
netic pressure, do not expect the
safely programmed responses
from Marinovich to backfire in
the all too near future.

novich threw for a career-high
337 yards and 3. touchdowns;
against Penn State, he had a 22-
of-34 afternoon for 240 yards and
one touchdown; against Washing
ton State last week, he equaled his
best performance ever, based on
completion percentage, by hitting
77.8 percent of his throws.
In five games, Marinovich has
recorded 79 completions, which
puts him two completions away
from moving into third place on
the list of all-time Trojan passing
leaders. On his current pace,
Marinovich will easily be in the

second position by the end of his
sophomore season.
"I never had any doubts I could
do it (effectively direct the USC
offense). I have a lot of confidence
in myself," Marinovich said.
However, against a powerful
Washington squad three weeks
ago, Marinovich struggled to an
uncharacteristic 7-of-16 perfor
mance with two interceptions.
After the 31-0 pummeling by
the Huskies, and after undoubt
edly his worst performance in a
Trojan uniform, Marinovich has
to be wondering if USC will be
able to make its fourth trip to the
Rose Bowl in a row.
"Anything can happen in the
Pac-10," Marinovich said. "We
have to be focused on winning our
next six games. If we lose another
game, we're out of the hunt."
For Marinovich, this aspect,
not his return to Stanford Sta
dium where he must have envi
sioned on his 1988 recruiting trip
throwing Elway-like passes, will
make today's game so important.
Like every other game, he realizes
that his opponents will be fired up
to bring him down.
"Whenever someone comes
into town or SC goes somewhere,
everyone (on the opposing team)
will be playing above their heads
and trying to beat the Trojans,"
he said.
At Washington, Marinovich, as
a football machine, malfunctioned
for one brief, uncharacteristic
moment. However, in front of
reporters, regardless of their mag
netic pressure, do not expect the
safely programmed responses
from Marinovich to backfire in
the all too near future.
If USC superstar Todd Mari
novich is attempting to rid him
self of the Robo-Quarterback
image, the comments that he now
gives to the press certainly do not
help the cause.
The redshirt sophomore sensa
tion from Mission Viejo, Calif.,
enrolled at USC after being
chronicled in a 1988 Sports Illus
trated article depicting his sys
tematic development into the
most highly recruited quarter
back in the nation. The article
noted that Marinovich had never
eaten an Oreo, drank a Coke or
sipped a beer in concern for his
physical well-being.
"The whole 'Robo-QB' thing
has been going on since I was a
freshman in high school, but now
it's starting to fade," Marinovich
said. "Some people have said that
the whole training program was
what my dad wanted, that I was
bred to be a quarterback. But it
was really what I wanted for
myself... It's gratifying to know
that all the hard work was worth
it."

Now that his unparalleled ded
ication to sport has begun to pay
off, Marinovich offers the media
only responses which seem to
have been learned in a classroom
lecture on ways to handle press
conferences.
When asked to comment on
Stanford's shocking upset of No. 1
Notre Dame, Marinovich refused
to give the Cardinal coaches any
juicy locker room quotes. Rather,
he noted his respect for the Cardi
nal passing game.
"I wasn't really surprised by
the outcome," he said. "Any team
that can throw the ball can beat
Notre Dame."
Along similar lines, when
describing his decision to attend
USC instead of Stanford, Mari
novich did not offer Stanford any
insulting quotes.
Rather, he quietly explained
that both schools offered incredi
bly positive experiences, that for a
time he thought that Stanford
was his first choice and that he
had to face his "hardest meeting
ever" when he told former Cardi
nal coaches Jack Elway and


Ken Beer — Daily file
Trojan quarterback Todd Marinovich has been groomed to be a quarterback all his life. If he continues
on his current pace he will become the most prolific USC passer ever.
Jimmy Walsh that he had decided
to head south.
"I was a hair away from sign
ing up there," Marinovich said.
"The trip convinced me that SC
was the place to go. You have to go
with the decision and make the
best of it."
Marinovich faced rather monu
mental expectations to make the
best of when he stepped onto the
turf last season for his first game
as a Trojan.
As a senior at Capistrano Val
ley High, Marinovich finished his
career with a national-record
9,194 passing yards the only
high school thrower ever to
eclipse the 9,000-yard mark.
Along the way, Marinovich gar
nered nearly every award that
could have been imagined, includ
ing being recognized as USA
Today's Offensive Player of the
Year. By enrolling at perennial
national football power USC,
Marinovich knew he would have
to face the glare of the national
media examining his throwing
motion.
After redshirting his freshman
season behind current Detroit
Lion quarterback Rodney Peete
and learning from him how to
handle the pressures of college
football, Marinovich stepped into
the starting slot last season and
performed at a level unparalleled
by any newcomer to USC.
"If he keeps going the way he
has, he will be the quarterback
that all other quarterbacks at

USC are measured by," former
USC and Los Angeles Rams sig
nal-caller Pat Haden said earlier
this season.
As the first freshman quarter
back to start a USC season opener
since at least World War 11, he fin
ished the year with the second
best completion rate ever
recorded at USC.
In just one season, Marinovich
moved into the sixth position on
the all-time Trojan passing list,
was honored as the nation's top
freshman football player by UPI
and The Sporting News, and was
named as the first freshman quar
terback on the All-Pac-10 first
team since records were kept in
1952. Marinovich, as a sopho
more, was named by USA Today
as one of four preseason choices to
win the 1990 Heisman Trophy.
If he can duplicate his 1989
statistics, Marinovich will far out
distance every Trojan throwing
record in the books. This season,
he has already recorded stellar
performances against Syracuse,
Penn State and Washington State.
