If USC superstar Todd Mari
novich is attempting to rid him
self of the Robo-Quarterback
image, the comments that he now
gives to the press certainly do not
help the cause.
The redshirt sophomore sensa
tion from Mission Viejo, Calif.,
enrolled at USC after being
chronicled in a 1988 Sports Illus
trated article depicting his sys
tematic development into the
most highly recruited quarter
back in the nation. The article
noted that Marinovich had never
eaten an Oreo, drank a Coke or
sipped a beer in concern for his
physical well-being.
"The whole 'Robo-QB' thing
has been going on since I was a
freshman in high school, but now
it's starting to fade," Marinovich
said. "Some people have said that
the whole training program was
what my dad wanted, that I was
bred to be a quarterback. But it
was really what I wanted for
myself... It's gratifying to know
that all the hard work was worth
it."

Now that his unparalleled ded
ication to sport has begun to pay
off, Marinovich offers the media
only responses which seem to
have been learned in a classroom
lecture on ways to handle press
conferences.
When asked to comment on
Stanford's shocking upset of No. 1
Notre Dame, Marinovich refused
to give the Cardinal coaches any
juicy locker room quotes. Rather,
he noted his respect for the Cardi
nal passing game.
"I wasn't really surprised by
the outcome," he said. "Any team
that can throw the ball can beat
Notre Dame."
Along similar lines, when
describing his decision to attend
USC instead of Stanford, Mari
novich did not offer Stanford any
insulting quotes.
Rather, he quietly explained
that both schools offered incredi
bly positive experiences, that for a
time he thought that Stanford
was his first choice and that he
had to face his "hardest meeting
ever" when he told former Cardi
nal coaches Jack Elway and

Trojan quarterback Todd Marinovich has been groomed to be a quarterback all his life. If he continues
on his current pace he will become the most prolific USC passer ever.
