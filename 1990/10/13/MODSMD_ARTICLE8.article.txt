# Stanford/USC Matchups
## 
### 
Rodriguez and Hopkins stand
out as two of the most successful
kickers in the history of USC and
Stanford. With his left-footed ap
proach, Rodriguez has connected
on 74.1 percent of his career field
goals and 24-of-25 inside the 30.
Before the Washington State
game, Rodriguez had put through
60 consecutive PATs. Coming off
the other sidelines, Hopkins had
a less-than-spectacular field goal
performance last weekend against
Notre Dame.

When Marinovich steps onto the
field, the opposing secondary bet
ter be on its toes. Marinovich has
-the ability to find the defense's
weak link, especially late in the
game, and immediately change
the outlook of a game. Klein, who
has been forced to answer numer
ous questions about his pass cov
erage on the final play of the
Notre Dame game, must have a
solid game in the Stanford sec
ondary if the Cardinal hopes to
stay close on the scoreboard.

"Touchdown Tommy" Vardell
jumped into the national limelight
with his impressive four
touchdown showing against the
Fighting Irish. Everyone knows
that Vardell will get the ball when
the Cardinal gets close to the goal
line, but no defensive squad has
found away to stop him so far
this season. Fruge will need to
use his 6-5, 260-pound frame to
fill up the middle when Vardell
comes hurtling toward the line.

With Ricky Ervins down with
an ankle sprain, Royster stepped
into the illustrious Trojan tailback
position and carried the ball for
50 yards the first time he touched
the ball. Last week he ran for 203
yards and three touchdowns. Gar
nett marked up a career-high 12
tackles last weekend with one
quarterback sack and one tackle
for-loss. The Cardinal defense has
aimed all season at sending the
opposition for negative yardage on
first down and, if successful this
weekend, the Cardinal secondary
will have a much better shot at
slowing down the USC passing
game.

McCaffrey currently leads the
nation in pass receptions per
game and is the player to whom
Palumbis looks in crucial situa
tions. McCaffrey averages 8.5 re
ceptions a game for 112.5 yards.
At 6-0, Pace will be stretching his
neck just to watch the lanky
McCaffrey take off. Pace has two
interceptions this season, but his
main task will be to smash into
McCaffrey when he stretches out
for one of his receptions. The Car
dinal offense will continue to flow
effectively if Pace and the rest of
the Trojan secondary cannot stop
McCaffrey's trek to first team All-
America.

Could the Trojan Marching
Band (TMB) play that fight song
one more time? The producers of
"The Naked Gun" realized that
even bad jokes can be funny, and
the TMB filled in nicely. What is
so cool about militaristic precision
anyway? The Leland Stanford
Junior (pause) University March
ing Band (LS JUMB) is haphazard
and weird, but as David Lynch
has shown, weird is hip. Also, our
"fight" song is rock-n-roll.
Thanks for coming, Trojans
See ya!
