When the tapes dictated by Nikita Khrushchev
in retirement first made their way to the West,
there were key gaps in the narrative.
Krushchev himself had authorized the
deletions, for apparent political reasons. Two
decades would pass before those gaps could
be filled. Now, newly released material provides
provocative information. Among the revelations:
• In the midst of the Cuban missle crisis, Fidel
Castro urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear
attack on the United States.
• Khrushchev wanted to return to Japan
islands in the Kurl chain seized by the Ussr
at the end of World War 11, and thereby
resotre normal relations between the two
countries.
The new tapes also provide valuable
information on the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop
pact and its secret protocol "giving" Lithuania,
Estonia, and Latvia to the Soviet Union;
fascinating background on the publication of
Aleksandr Solzhenrtsyn's One Day in the Life of
Ivan Denisovich and Leonid Brezhnev's
subsequent suppression of the author and his
works; revealing and acid asides on Brezhnev
and his allies; and Khrushchev's candid
thoughts and doubts on the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslavakia and the crushing of the Prague
Spring.

When the tapes dictated by Nikita Khrushchev
in retirement first made their way to the West,
there were key gaps in the narrative.
Krushchev himself had authorized the
deletions, for apparent political reasons. Two
decades would pass before those gaps could
be filled. Now, newly released material provides
provocative information. Among the revelations:
• In the midst of the Cuban missle crisis, Fidel
Castro urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear
attack on the United States.
• Khrushchev wanted to return to Japan
islands in the Kurl chain seized by the Ussr
at the end of World War 11, and thereby
resotre normal relations between the two
countries.
The new tapes also provide valuable
information on the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop
pact and its secret protocol "giving" Lithuania,
Estonia, and Latvia to the Soviet Union;
fascinating background on the publication of
Aleksandr Solzhenrtsyn's One Day in the Life of
Ivan Denisovich and Leonid Brezhnev's
subsequent suppression of the author and his
works; revealing and acid asides on Brezhnev
and his allies; and Khrushchev's candid
thoughts and doubts on the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslavakia and the crushing of the Prague
Spring.
