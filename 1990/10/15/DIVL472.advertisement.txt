With Apple's introduction of three new
Macintosh'computers, meeting the challenges of college
life just got a whole lot easier. Because now, everybody
can afford a Macintosh.
'Ihe pABWIBWBHtMIM is our most affordable
model, yet it comes with everything you need-including
a hard disk drive.The MMKMHH combines color
capabilities with affordability. And the HWBIHBHBIIBB is
perfect for students who need a computer with extra
power and expandability.
No matter which Macintosh you choose, you'll
have a computer that lightens your work load without
giving you another tough subject to learn. Every Macintosh
computer is easy to set up and even easier to master. And
when you've learned one program, you're well on your
way to learning them all. That's because thousands of
available programs all work in the same, consistent manner.
You can even share information with someone who uses a
different type of computer-thanks to Apple's versatile
Super Driver which reads from and writes to Macintosh,
MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple* II floppy disks.
See the new Macintosh computers for yourself,
and find out how surviving college just got a whole lot
easier.
