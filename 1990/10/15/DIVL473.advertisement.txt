Meet the Future
Of Creative Thinking
Amiga doesn't just improve your work. It improves your
thinking. Just working hard isn't enough anymore.
Creative thinking is what sets winners apart.
The Amiga computer was designed precisely with
that thought in mind. It starts with the ability to handle
routine tasks, then lets you go all the way to innovation
and invention.
Whatever you can imagine, Amiga
has the power to produce. Easily.
Its built-in technology is
a major advancement
in a computer of this
size and price range.
With a mouse and
simple icons, Amiga com
bines a full color display, full
stereo sound, graphics, 3-D
animation, video capability and
text as no other computer can.
It has the power to run soft
ware sophisticated enough to
manipulate vast amounts of data,
as well as the creative genius to
create the complete score for an
orchestral composition.
