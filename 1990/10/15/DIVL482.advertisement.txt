mN RAND
Famous for The Fountainhead and Atlas
Shrugged, Ayn Rand is also the originator of
Objectivism, a philosophy as radical and elec
trifying as her novels. In a mere 33 years, as the
walls of totalitarianism come tumbling down,
Objectivism has spread from a lecture hall in
New York to campuses all over the world.
OBJECTIVISM—A PHILOSOPHY
FOR LIVING ON EARTH
Ayn Rand challenges the anti-mind doctrines
still polluting our culture and classrooms. She
holds that:
• Reality exists as an objective fact
• Reason is man's only means of knowledge
• Rational selfishness is the essence of virtue
• Laissez-faire capitalism is the
moral social system
"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of
man as a heroic being, with his own happiness
as the moral purpose of his life, with productive
achievement as his noblest activity, and reason
as his only absolute." (Atlas Shrugged)
