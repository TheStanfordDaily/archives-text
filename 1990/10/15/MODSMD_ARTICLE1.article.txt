# Ujamaa celebrates 20 years
## Theme house has been 'a place to feel comfortable'

Ujamaa residents new and
old are celebrating the 20th an
niversary this year of the crea
tion of the African-American
theme house.
The house's founding came
on the heels of the civil rights
movement and student protests
of the 19605. Following months
of unrelenting pressure in 1970
by members ot the Black Stu
dent Union and a supporting
cast of administrators and fac
ulty, the Office of Residential
Education transformed Cedro
House into the Black Concen
tration House. Black students
comprised nearly one-third of
the residents and African-
American culture was stressed.
The house represented a
coup for black students
who had desired a sense of com
munity and a central gathering
place on campus.

"Having to completely stifle
one's way of life is one of the
most frustrating experiences
for a black student at a pre
dominantly white institution,"
wrote Thomas Massey. who was
co-director of the Black Student
Volunteer Center in 1969,
before the house opened.
The University was skeptical
the idea of placing black stu
dents with other students in a
special residence would
succeed, according to Psychia
try Prof. Richard Dement, the
first resident fellow of the
Black Concentration House.
At a reunion event on Friday,
Dement extolled the success of
the first year. "That was the
the greatest year that could
have possibly happened. It just
worked out beautifully."
Patterned after the old settle
ment houses found in im
migrant communities, Cedro
was designed to create warmth
and energy, a sense of family.

Some former residents said the
house provided Stanford's tiny,
black community — only one
percent of the total student Dop
ulation at the time was black
— with a much needed spiritual
and cultural center and also
forged an informal support net
work.
"It was a place where blacks
could meet and feel comforta
ble," said Lenard Austin, a


First in a four-part series on
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
