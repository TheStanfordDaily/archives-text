# Ujamaa celebrates 20 years
## Theme house has been 'a place to feel comfortable' 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
Ujamaa residents new and
old are celebrating the 20th an
niversary this year of the crea
tion of the African-American
theme house.
The house's founding came
on the heels of the civil rights
movement and student protests
of the 19605. Following months
of unrelenting pressure in 1970
by members ot the Black Stu
dent Union and a supporting
cast of administrators and fac
ulty, the Office of Residential
Education transformed Cedro
House into the Black Concen
tration House. Black students
comprised nearly one-third of
the residents and African-
American culture was stressed.
The house represented a
coup for black students
who had desired a sense of com
munity and a central gathering
place on campus.

"Having to completely stifle
one's way of life is one of the
most frustrating experiences
for a black student at a pre
dominantly white institution,"
wrote Thomas Massey. who was
co-director of the Black Student
Volunteer Center in 1969,
before the house opened.
The University was skeptical
the idea of placing black stu
dents with other students in a
special residence would
succeed, according to Psychia
try Prof. Richard Dement, the
first resident fellow of the
Black Concentration House.
At a reunion event on Friday,
Dement extolled the success of
the first year. "That was the
the greatest year that could
have possibly happened. It just
worked out beautifully."
Patterned after the old settle
ment houses found in im
migrant communities, Cedro
was designed to create warmth
and energy, a sense of family.

Some former residents said the
house provided Stanford's tiny,
black community — only one
percent of the total student Dop
ulation at the time was black
— with a much needed spiritual
and cultural center and also
forged an informal support net
work.
"It was a place where blacks
could meet and feel comforta
ble," said Lenard Austin, a

freshman during the house's
first year. "For many of us who
came from predominantly black
settings it helped in our transi
tion into Stanford."
Some white students also said
they benefited from the cultural,
social and educational experi
ence uniquely fostered in Wilbur
Hall that year. Jim Morgan had
only read about black history
when he arrived at Stanford
from his native Hawaii 20 years
ago.
"The experience of living in
Cedro opened my eyes to many
things and I learned about
blacks and whites alike. I have
carried those experiences with
me since," Morgan said. "It lives
on long after you have left," he
added.
Over the years the black
theme house survived despite
hopscotching across campus. In
1971 the house relocated from
Cedro to Roble Hall, where it
remained for 3 years before
moving in 1974 to Lagunita, its
current home.
Today the house is tucked
away in a corner of Lagunita
Hall and is known by a different
name. In 1975 it was dubbed
Ujamaa, the Swahili word for
"cooperative economics."
The house currently is a
mosaic of more than 100 stu
dents from different races, reli
gions, beliefs and sexual
preferences.
Last fall, 65 percent of
Ujamaa's residents were black,
20 percent white and the
remaining 15 percent evenly
divided between Asian-
Americans, Chicanos and
foreign students.
Like Cedro, Ujamaa is popular
as a social gathering place for
black students. But the days of
Monday Night Football watch
ing — popular in Wilbur — have
been replaced by a new Thurs
day night ritual. "The Cosby
Show" brings residents and stu
dents from all over campus to •
Ujamaa's television lounge each
week.
In the spring the house spon
sors a popular semi-formal,
"Club Ui," that is one of the
more wiaely attended events on

campus.
Despite the dorm's various so
cial offerings, Ujamaa's primary
purpose remains educating its
residents and the campus com
munity. It still strives to provide
an environment in compliance
with Res Ed's mission statement
for theme houses: to be places
"in which exploration and the
study of racial and cultural iden
tity and the celebration of plu
ralism is promoted."
Ujamaa has four resident as
sistants, like most dormitories,
but also six theme associates re
sponsible for bringing cultural
programming and awareness to
the dorm.
"It's one place at Stanford
where black people can be to
tally normal ana let down the
shield and armor they have to
wear in white society," said
Leroy Davis, a coterminal stu
dent in Engineering Economic
Systems, who has lived in
Lfjamaa for three years.
But living in Ujamaa is not
an entirely positive experience
for some students. Kim Kamin,
a sophomore, lived there last
year and said, "It was a great
place to live and really special.
But sometimes, people could feel
self-segregated, isolated and un
comfortable."
The hallways, spotted with vi
brant decorations, reflect a
theme significant in the African-
American experience, while the
house's main lounge is a
veritable celebration of black
culture. Glass-paneled show
cases contain pamphlets and
newspapers chronicling the his
tory and achievement of black
people throughout the world.
In the central area of the main
lounge, a large sign drapes down
from a overhanging facade. Em
boldened with black, green and
red lettering, it states: "Ujamaa:
The message is unity."
Black Student Union meet
ings convene here every other
week. No other ethnic theme
dorm hosts the student of color
organization of its particular
ethnicity. Some students have
complained, however, that this
fact divides the dorm politically
and racially.
Theme associate Maggie
Chapman, a sophomore, said,
"As the hub of the black com
munity, it is appropriate to have
that element present."

"This dorm is definitely a
place where students who are
either black or non-black can
participate and learn from a dif
ferent point of view," said resi
dent assistant James Rucker, a
senior.
But despite the-aims of edu
cation and openness of social
and cultural exchange between
residences, some argue that that
Ujamaa has fallen snort of those
goals.
A report conducted in 1985
by Hoover Fellow John Bunzel
said that theme houses like
Uiamaa do a "much better job
of serving the internal needs of
the community than of address
ing the relationships between
minority and non-minority
students."
A letter written to The Daily
in 1987 by Stanford graduate
Ken Whitney said that tne prob
lem of theme houses is that
"while some may benefit from
the social and educational pro
grams, others simply seek
camaraderie and protection they
perceive can be had by isolating
themselves from the outside
world."
Sophomore Joe Matal, who
resided in Ujamaa last year, said
a "large number of white stu

dents" formed a subculture be
cause they just did not feel
comfortable there.
"The feelinp that I got is that
if you give Ujamaa the goals of
educating white freshman and
centralizing black power, while
serving as a serious place for
black culture, you would find
those goals incompatible," said
Matal.
Although Matal said some
white students did ei\joy them
selves, he noted it was not the
best place for a freshman to live,
because freshman "have certain
needs and insecurities that are
not served or addressed by the
dorm."
Rucker said that it is impos
sible for a house to be idyllic
but that he seeks to insure that
people feel comfortable and part
of tne house.
Racial tensions flared in 1988
with the infamous Ujamaa in
cident, when two white students
drew derogatory caricatures of
blacks on a poster. Commenting
on the incident, Rischa Williams
Slade, who lived in Cedro twenty
years ago and graduated in
1974, said that it indicated
"while things are better today,
some things do not change.. ..
Obviously, we need the house."

Ujamaa residents new and

The house's founding came

of the 19605. Following months
of unrelenting pressure in 1970
by members ot the Black Stu

Over the years the black
theme house survived despite
hopscotching across campus. In
1971 the house relocated from
Cedro to Roble Hall, where it
remained for 3 years before
moving in 1974 to Lagunita, its
current home.
Today the house is tucked
away in a corner of Lagunita
Hall and is known by a different
name. In 1975 it was dubbed
Ujamaa, the Swahili word for
"cooperative economics."
The house currently is a
mosaic of more than 100 stu
dents from different races, reli
gions, beliefs and sexual
preferences.
Last fall, 65 percent of
Ujamaa's residents were black,
20 percent white and the
remaining 15 percent evenly
divided between Asian-
Americans, Chicanos and
foreign students.
Like Cedro, Ujamaa is popular
as a social gathering place for
black students. But the days of
Monday Night Football watch
ing — popular in Wilbur — have
been replaced by a new Thurs
day night ritual. "The Cosby

dents from all over campus to •
Ujamaa's television lounge each
week.
In the spring the house spon
sors a popular semi-formal,
"Club Ui," that is one of the
more wiaely attended events on

campus.
Despite the dorm's various so
cial offerings, Ujamaa's primary
purpose remains educating its
residents and the campus com
munity. It still strives to provide
an environment in compliance
with Res Ed's mission statement
for theme houses: to be places
"in which exploration and the
study of racial and cultural iden
tity and the celebration of plu
ralism is promoted."
Ujamaa has four resident as
sistants, like most dormitories,
but also six theme associates re
sponsible for bringing cultural
programming and awareness to
the dorm.
"It's one place at Stanford
where black people can be to

hopscotching across campus. In
1971 the house relocated from
Cedro to Roble Hall, where it
remained for 3 years before
moving in 1974 to Lagunita, its
current home.
Today the house is tucked
away in a corner of Lagunita
Hall and is known by a different
name. In 1975 it was dubbed
Ujamaa, the Swahili word for
"cooperative economics."
The house currently is a
mosaic of more than 100 stu
dents from different races, reli
gions, beliefs and sexual
preferences.
Last fall, 65 percent of
Ujamaa's residents were black,
20 percent white and the
remaining 15 percent evenly
divided between Asian-
Americans, Chicanos and
foreign students.
Like Cedro, Ujamaa is popular
as a social gathering place for
black students. But the days of
Monday Night Football watch
ing — popular in Wilbur — have
been replaced by a new Thurs
day night ritual. "The Cosby
Show" brings residents and stu
dents from all over campus to •
Ujamaa's television lounge each
week.
In the spring the house spon
sors a popular semi-formal,
"Club Ui," that is one of the
more wiaely attended events on

campus.
Despite the dorm's various so
cial offerings, Ujamaa's primary
purpose remains educating its
residents and the campus com
munity. It still strives to provide
an environment in compliance
with Res Ed's mission statement
for theme houses: to be places
"in which exploration and the
study of racial and cultural iden
tity and the celebration of plu
ralism is promoted."
Ujamaa has four resident as
sistants, like most dormitories,
but also six theme associates re
sponsible for bringing cultural
programming and awareness to
the dorm.
"It's one place at Stanford
where black people can be to
tally normal ana let down the
shield and armor they have to
wear in white society," said
Leroy Davis, a coterminal stu
dent in Engineering Economic
Systems, who has lived in
Lfjamaa for three years.
But living in Ujamaa is not
an entirely positive experience
for some students. Kim Kamin,
a sophomore, lived there last
year and said, "It was a great
place to live and really special.
But sometimes, people could feel
self-segregated, isolated and un
comfortable."
The hallways, spotted with vi
brant decorations, reflect a
theme significant in the African-
American experience, while the
house's main lounge is a
veritable celebration of black
culture. Glass-paneled show
cases contain pamphlets and
newspapers chronicling the his
tory and achievement of black
people throughout the world.
In the central area of the main
lounge, a large sign drapes down
from a overhanging facade. Em
boldened with black, green and
red lettering, it states: "Ujamaa:
The message is unity."
Black Student Union meet
ings convene here every other
week. No other ethnic theme
dorm hosts the student of color
organization of its particular
ethnicity. Some students have
complained, however, that this
fact divides the dorm politically
and racially.
Theme associate Maggie
Chapman, a sophomore, said,
"As the hub of the black com
munity, it is appropriate to have
that element present."

"This dorm is definitely a
place where students who are
either black or non-black can
participate and learn from a dif
ferent point of view," said resi
dent assistant James Rucker, a
senior.
But despite the-aims of edu
cation and openness of social
and cultural exchange between
residences, some argue that that
Ujamaa has fallen snort of those
goals.
A report conducted in 1985
by Hoover Fellow John Bunzel
said that theme houses like
Uiamaa do a "much better job
of serving the internal needs of
the community than of address
ing the relationships between
minority and non-minority
students."
A letter written to The Daily
in 1987 by Stanford graduate
Ken Whitney said that tne prob
lem of theme houses is that
"while some may benefit from
the social and educational pro
grams, others simply seek
camaraderie and protection they
perceive can be had by isolating
themselves from the outside
world."
Sophomore Joe Matal, who
resided in Ujamaa last year, said
a "large number of white stu

dents" formed a subculture be
cause they just did not feel
comfortable there.
"The feelinp that I got is that
if you give Ujamaa the goals of
educating white freshman and
centralizing black power, while
serving as a serious place for
black culture, you would find
those goals incompatible," said
Matal.
Although Matal said some
white students did ei\joy them
selves, he noted it was not the
best place for a freshman to live,
because freshman "have certain
needs and insecurities that are
not served or addressed by the
dorm."
Rucker said that it is impos
sible for a house to be idyllic
but that he seeks to insure that
people feel comfortable and part
of tne house.
Racial tensions flared in 1988
with the infamous Ujamaa in
cident, when two white students
drew derogatory caricatures of
blacks on a poster. Commenting
on the incident, Rischa Williams
Slade, who lived in Cedro twenty
years ago and graduated in
1974, said that it indicated
"while things are better today,
some things do not change.. ..
Obviously, we need the house."
Ujamaa residents new and
old are celebrating the 20th an
niversary this year of the crea
tion of the African-American
theme house.
The house's founding came
on the heels of the civil rights
movement and student protests
of the 19605. Following months
of unrelenting pressure in 1970
by members ot the Black Stu
dent Union and a supporting
cast of administrators and fac
ulty, the Office of Residential
Education transformed Cedro
House into the Black Concen
tration House. Black students
comprised nearly one-third of
the residents and African-
American culture was stressed.
The house represented a
coup for black students
who had desired a sense of com
munity and a central gathering
place on campus.

"Having to completely stifle
one's way of life is one of the
most frustrating experiences
for a black student at a pre
dominantly white institution,"
wrote Thomas Massey. who was
co-director of the Black Student
Volunteer Center in 1969,
before the house opened.
The University was skeptical
the idea of placing black stu
dents with other students in a
special residence would
succeed, according to Psychia
try Prof. Richard Dement, the
first resident fellow of the
Black Concentration House.
At a reunion event on Friday,
Dement extolled the success of
the first year. "That was the
the greatest year that could
have possibly happened. It just
worked out beautifully."
Patterned after the old settle
ment houses found in im
migrant communities, Cedro
was designed to create warmth
and energy, a sense of family.

Some former residents said the
house provided Stanford's tiny,
black community — only one
percent of the total student Dop
ulation at the time was black
— with a much needed spiritual
and cultural center and also
forged an informal support net
work.
"It was a place where blacks
could meet and feel comforta
ble," said Lenard Austin, a


First in a four-part series on
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.

freshman during the house's
first year. "For many of us who
came from predominantly black
settings it helped in our transi
tion into Stanford."
Some white students also said
they benefited from the cultural,
social and educational experi
ence uniquely fostered in Wilbur
Hall that year. Jim Morgan had
only read about black history
when he arrived at Stanford
from his native Hawaii 20 years
ago.
"The experience of living in
Cedro opened my eyes to many
things and I learned about
blacks and whites alike. I have
carried those experiences with
me since," Morgan said. "It lives
on long after you have left," he
added.
