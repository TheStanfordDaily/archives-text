# Court upholds dismissal of ousted Bhutto

LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) â€” A court upheld
yesterday the dismissal of Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, ruling that corruption and
mismanagement had stalled her government
after 20 months in office. The Lahore High
Court's decision will likely be challenged in
the Supreme Court. National elections are set
for Oct. 24, so a victory for either side would
merely be a moral one.
Four lawsuits filed by supporters of Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party argued that President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan had overstepped his con
stitutional authority by abruptly dismissing
her government Aug. 6.
Khan fired Bhutto on charges of corruption,

nepotism and abuse of power and installed a
military-backed caretaker government. The
former prime minister has denied the charges
and called her dismissal a political move.
Meanwhile, a poll released yesterday showed
that although Bhutto's opponents would likely
win the October elections, the ousted prime
minister would command a formidable polit
ical force after the balloting.
The poll by Gallup Pakistan indicated
Bhutto and her Pakistan People's Party would
take 30 percent of the vote. The largely right
wing coalition, the Islamic Democratic Alli
ance, would win 40 to 45 percent, it said. The
poll gave no margin of error.

The six-judge panel rejected yesterday the
contentions of the People's Party and cited
eight grounds for Bhutto's ouster and the
appointment of a caretaker government. "We
find that the president was justified in the
opinion that the government could not be
carried on in accordance with the constitution
and an appeal to the electorate was necessary."
Bhutto is being tried on corruption and
other charges by special one-judge tribunals
in Lahore and her hometown of Karachi.
The court also accused Bhutto of publically
ridiculing the Senate and the judiciary and
alleged she misused millions of dollars in gov
ernment funds to buy political favors.
