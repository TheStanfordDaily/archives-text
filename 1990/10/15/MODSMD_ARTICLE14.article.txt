# Soviets say Iraq may partially withdraw

MOSCOW (AP) â€” Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein indicated to a
visiting Soviet official last week
he might remove his troops from
Kuwait in return for some
Kuwaiti territory along the Per
sian Gulf, a Soviet news agency
reported.
The government-run Novosti
Press Agency said the shift in
Iraq's position raised the Krem
lin's hopes for a diplomatic solu
tion to the standoff. But an editor
at the official Iraqi News Agency
denied Iraq had made any offer
of a partial withdrawal.
Novosti, in a dispatch published
yesterday by the labor newspaper
Rabochaya Tribuna, said Saddam
made the comments in talks with
Yevgeny Primakov, a top Kremlin
aide whom President Mikhail Gor
bachev sent to Baghdad last week
to discuss the gulf crisis.
"In talks with Saddam Hussein,
not once did (Saddam) mention
the historical rights of Iraq to the
territory of Kuwait, amounting to
a definite softening of the Iraqi
president's position," Novosti re
ported.
From these remarks, it follows
that Iraq might withdraw its
army from Kuwait, retaining for
itself southern Rumaillah and the
islands Warba and Bubiyan,
opening up exits to the sea," the
news agency continued.
Soviet presidential spokesman
Vitaly Ignatenko had said last
week that Soviet officials were op
timistic after the Saddam-
Primakov meetings, but gave no
details.

Historical claims to Kuwaiti ter
ritory have been among Saddam's
official justifications for Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of the oil-rich
kingdom. He also claimed the
Kuwait government was taking oil
that belonged to Baghdad, and
that the rule of Kuwaiti's
monarchy was illegitimate.
The islands of Bubiyan and
Warba are off the Kuwaiti coast
near the border with Iraq.
Rumaillah is one of Kuwait's
oil fields along the Kuwaiti-
Iraqi border near the coast.
By acquiring the three addi
tional sites, Hussein could vastly
expand his oil production capacity
and open new ports. Iraq cur
rently has only a small coastline
from which to export most of its
oil, its main source of revenue.
A U.S.-led international eco
nomic embargo against Iraq, en
forced by a U.N.-sanctioned air
and sea blockade, has cut off
Iraq's mtyor oil markets.
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney is visiting Moscow Wed
nesday, and an official at the Pen
tagon said Cheney would ask for
intelligence on Iraq. The official
complained Moscow had failed to
provide Washington with data on
the Iraqi military which the So
viet Union has been arming for
a decade.
The Soviet Union has backed
U.N. sanctions against Iraq and
has two ships in the gulf, but
Gorbachev has declined to send
in more, saying the conflict should
be settled peacefully.
