JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
rejected yesterday the U.N. deci
sion to investigate the Israeli
shooting of 19 Palestinians on
Temple Mount and would not
cooperate if the world body sends
a delegation.
The decision came after a four
hour meeting of the Israeli
Cabinet and was announced by
Foreign Minister David Levy.
Israel radio reported the
Cabinet turned down Housing
Minister Ariel Sharon's proposal
to block U.N. investigators from
entering the country.
Levy, speaking on Israeli radio,
said the government unanimously
rejected the Friday decisions of
the U.N. Security Council and
"determined its refusal to accept
such a mission."
The Cabinet's rejection came
despite a recommendation from
Israel's U.N. delegation, which
advised accepting the mission in
order to prevent a confrontation
with the United Nations and the
United States.
The Security Council on Friday
condemned Israel and decided to
send a team under Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar
to investigate the slayings. Israeli

troops on Monday fired live am
munition at Palestinian protest
ers on Temple Mount, known in
Arabic as Haram al-Sharif, or
Noble Enclosure. Haram al-Sharif
is considered Islam's third holiest
shrine.
Israel maintained that its police
were provoked by Palestinian
rioters who threw rocks from the
Moslem compound on Temple
Mount at Jews worshiping at the
adjacent Western Wall, also known
as the Wailing Wall.
Israeli officials first said Pales
tinians planned the stoning of
Jewish worshipers in advance,
hoping to prompt an incident that
would divert world attention from
the Gulf crisis.
Police Commissioner Yaacov
Terner later said he believed the
riot was spontaneous.
Levy said a U.N. investigation
would violate Israel's sovereignty
over Jerusalem. The site of the
shootings, holy to both Moslems
and Jews, is in Arab east
Jerusalem, which Israel captured
in the 1967 Middle East War and
later annexed.
Levy said he hoped the Cabinet
decision would not lead to a con
frontation with the United States.

Miriam Tessler, Chicago resident and Holocaust victim, supports the Israeli police
during a rally by Jewish victims of Arab terrorism. The group demands that full
sovereignty of Temple Mount be returned to Israeli authorities. The protest came
after last week's rioting that left 19 Palestinians dead.
