# Quayle says Bush 'Violently' opposes tax hikes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle said yesterday that
the Bush administration is "violently
opposed" to a Democratic plan for a
large increase in the top tax rates paid
by the wealthiest Americans.
But a principal supporter of the in
crease, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chair
man of House Ways and Means
Committee, said he would seek its ap
proval this week as part of a deficit
reduction plan in an election campaign
test of strength.
I'm not going to deny that we're
trying to make a political statement,
and there certainly is evidence that
there's now a division between Dem
ocrats and Republicans," said Ros
tenkowski, D-111.
Quayle and Rostenkowski made
their comments on television news pro
grams yesterday, setting the stage for
this week's attempt in Congress to
fashion a $500 billion five-year pack
age of spending cuts and tax increases
to rein in the federal deficit.
If Congress fails to approve an ac

ceptable deficit reduction plan before
midnight Friday, White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu said chances are
"relatively high" the federal govern
ment would shut down for a second
time this month.
Aside from the deficit reduction
plan, Congress hopes to complete work
on comprehensive clean air legislation,
a civil rights bill, a new farm bill and
several other major pieces of legisla
tion before it adjourns for the year
sometime in the next two weeks.
There are several hundred billion
dollars in spending cuts in the package,
including more than $13 billion in
agriculture spending.
Any deficit reduction plan also is
expected to curb the defense buildup,
cut Medicare, and restrain spending
in hundreds of federal programs. But
most of the debate in recent days has
centered around whose taxes should
be raised and by how much.
Rostenkowski's House Ways and
Means Committee approved a proposal
that would raise the top tax bracket

from 28 percent to 33 percent.
"We want to protect middle income
and poor America, and we want every
body to share in the pain of govern
ing," Rostenkowski said on CNN's
"Newsmaker Sunday." He said al
though he would be willing to com
promise, he believes the 33 percent
tax rate is necessary.
However, Sununu said on NBC's
"Meet the Press" that the administra
tion was "opposed to playing around
with the income tax rate for Americans
across the board."
An alternative plan was approved
by the Senate Finance Committee
early Saturday without the increase
in the upper tax bracket. That plan
relies on limiting deductions taken by
the wealthy to increase tax collections.
In addition, both plans would raise
the taxes on gasoline, alcohol, tobacco
and such luxury items as furs, jewelry
and expensive cars.
"I had tried to get a 33 percent rate,
and the president could not accept it
at all," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-

Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
He said his committee "came
through the back door" by limiting
deductions on wealthy Americans.
"And that means that we have a
progressive table, that those making
the highest income will pay the highest
increase in the taxes," he said on
ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley."
Quayle, on CBS* "Face the Nation,"
said Bush was prepared to reject any
deficit-reduction plan he dislikes, re
gardless: of how long the process takes.
"They are going to have to stay in
town and pass a budget," Quayle said,
referring to members of Congress.
"The president is simply not going to
let the Congress go home until they
pass a good deficit-reduction plan that
is going to avoid a recession."
The original package, which in
cluded the budget for the 1991 fiscal
year that began Oct. 1, was killed by
the Houme.

ceptable deficit reduction plan before
midnight Friday, White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu said chances are
"relatively high" the federal govern
ment would shut down for a second
time this month.
Aside from the deficit reduction
plan, Congress hopes to complete work
on comprehensive clean air legislation,
a civil rights bill, a new farm bill and
several other major pieces of legisla
tion before it adjourns for the year
sometime in the next two weeks.
There are several hundred billion
dollars in spending cuts in the package,
including more than $13 billion in
agriculture spending.
Any deficit reduction plan also is
expected to curb the defense buildup,
cut Medicare, and restrain spending
in hundreds of federal programs. But
most of the debate in recent days has
centered around whose taxes should
be raised and by how much.
Rostenkowski's House Ways and
Means Committee approved a proposal
that would raise the top tax bracket

from 28 percent to 33 percent.
"We want to protect middle income
and poor America, and we want every
body to share in the pain of govern
ing," Rostenkowski said on CNN's
"Newsmaker Sunday." He said al
though he would be willing to com
promise, he believes the 33 percent
tax rate is necessary.
However, Sununu said on NBC's
"Meet the Press" that the administra
tion was "opposed to playing around
with the income tax rate for Americans
across the board."
An alternative plan was approved
by the Senate Finance Committee
early Saturday without the increase
in the upper tax bracket. That plan
relies on limiting deductions taken by
the wealthy to increase tax collections.
In addition, both plans would raise
the taxes on gasoline, alcohol, tobacco
and such luxury items as furs, jewelry
and expensive cars.
"I had tried to get a 33 percent rate,
and the president could not accept it
at all," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-

Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
He said his committee "came
through the back door" by limiting
deductions on wealthy Americans.
"And that means that we have a
progressive table, that those making
the highest income will pay the highest
increase in the taxes," he said on
ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley."
Quayle, on CBS* "Face the Nation,"
said Bush was prepared to reject any
deficit-reduction plan he dislikes, re
gardless: of how long the process takes.
"They are going to have to stay in
town and pass a budget," Quayle said,
referring to members of Congress.
"The president is simply not going to
let the Congress go home until they
pass a good deficit-reduction plan that
is going to avoid a recession."
The original package, which in
cluded the budget for the 1991 fiscal
year that began Oct. 1, was killed by
the Houme.
