### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) â€” Iran
and Iraq reopened embassies in
each other's capitals yesterday,
resuming full diplomatic ties and
ending a decade of enmity, Iran's
Islamic Republic News Agency re
ported.
The exchange of diplomats
came only two years after a U.N.-
brokered cease-fire halted hostil
ities in the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war.
The Iraqi charge d'affaires took
up his post yesterday and his
Iranian counterpart was to leave
for Baghdad shortly, said the news
agency monitored in Cyprus.
Neither officials has been
named, but the Tehran Times
quoted Iranian political circles as
saying the likely Iranian envoy
would be Javad Turkabadi, Iran's
former charge d'affaires in
Kuwait.

Turkabadi now heads the Per
sian Gulf Affairs desk at the
Iranian Foreign Ministry.
Iraqi President Saddam Hus
sein is believed to be seeking
Iranian assistance in circumvent
ing the U.N. economic embargo
imposed to force him out of
Kuwait. There have been reports
of food shipments crossing from
Iran into Iraq along their 730-mile
border.
Tehran has officially con
demned Saddam's invasion of
Kuwait and called for his with
drawal. But at the same time, Iran
has condemned the presence of
Western forces in Saudi Arabia,
home of Islam's holiest shrines.
The decision to reestablish full
diplomatic ties came during a Sep
tember visit to Tehran by Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
