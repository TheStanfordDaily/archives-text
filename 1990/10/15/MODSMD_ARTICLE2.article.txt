Debating topics such as whether Stan
ford's alcohol policy is morally right, the
Stanford Debate Team placed second and
seventh this weekend at the Harvard Par
liamentary Debate Tournament.
Sophomore Erez Kalir, a member of
the second-place team, said, "It was a
boon. We did much better than we
thought we would."
The Harvard tournament is the largest
in the country, with 170 teams participat
ing.
The competition consisted of five pre
liminary rounds of ofT-topic debate and

a runoff between four undefeated teams.
In off-topic debate, a team receives its
topic 15 minutes before the start of the
debate.
Sophomores Michelle Mello and Victor
Jih placed seventh as a team, debating
on the alcohol policy among other topics.
Junior Dimitri Melhorn and Kalir lost in
the championship round to the Columbia
University team. Princeton and Yale
placed third and fourth, respectively.
In their final debate, Melhorn and Kalir
argued in favor of a U.S. withdrawal
from NATO. The audience split with a
five-to-three vote in favor of Columbia,

'It's important for Stanford to get on the map. The
debate program has been pretty dead since the 19605.
We want to reinvoke the tradition.'

and the judges voted unanimously for
Columbia.
However, Melhorn called the second
place achievement a "bombshell" because
Stanford asserted itself in a competition
with more experienced Eastern schools
for the first time in recent years.
"It's important for Stanford to get on
the map. The debate program has been

pretty dead since the 19605. We want to
reinvoke the tradition," Kalir said.
The current debate club was founded
in 1984. In 1989, an alumnus from Eng
land donated an annual sum of $20,000
to the program. The funds help provide
the team with a part-time coach and more
money for traveling expenses.
"The team had to make a lot of finan

rial sacrifices for us to participate in the
tournament," said Mello. "We were
pleased with the result."
After this weekend's success, many of
the Eastern teams invited Stanford to
other competitions. These events will aid
in the recruitment of new people, Kalir
said.
"High school experience helps, but you
can [start debating in college] if you prac
tice and you've got the will to develop
your talent," Kalir said. Melhorn added
that the team is willing to send beginners
to local and regional tournaments.
The Stanford Debate Club also hosts
an annual high school tournament.
