## Try going dry 
### 
Dorms should join
Greeks this week,
host dry parties

IN THE MIDST of a campus
wide debate over the institu
tion of a new University alcohol
policy, the National Collegiate Al
cohol Awareness Week will give
students the opportunity to reflect
upon and discuss the role of alcohol
in the Stanford community.
The week began yesterday with
a service at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and will continue with a non
alcoholic beer tasting in White
Plaza on Tuesday, a comedy show
Tuesday night at the Coffee House
and a debate over the proposed
alcohol user tax on Wednesday.
The week's organizers at Project
R 2 ISC, Risk Reduction of In
toxicants in the Stanford Commu
nity, have also asked fraternities
and sororities to provide a weekend
of dry parties in an attempt to
demonstrate how enjoyable dry
parties can be.
But the organizers of the dry
weekend will hardly be able to
achieve this goal alone. The large
number of Stanford students who
attend fraternity parties to drink
alcohol will most likely find their
alcohol at alternative locations.
In order to make next weekend
a successful one, the support of
the dorms is also needed, in addi
tion to that of the fraternities and
sororities. If alcohol is served freely
at dorm parties this weekend, stu
dents will simply migrate from the
fraternities to the dorms, and the
point of awareness week will have
been missed.
Individual dorms should take it
upon themselves to provide an
alcohol-free environment at all par
ties this coming weekend. This will

advance the goals of the planners
of alcohol awareness week and will
also benefit the dorms, given the
uncertainty surrounding the new
alcohol policy and how the Univer
sity will implement it.
The attempt to ban alcohol at
fraternity and sorority parties next
weekend will probably have little
practical effect on alcohol con
sumption in the long term. It is
unlikely that a single alcohol-free
weekend will convince many Stan
ford students to remain dry.
But that is not the point of the
week. It is a week not of alcohol
prohibition but of alcohol aware
ness. It is a week in which students
can reflect upon the role of alcohol
in the Stanford community and its
dangers.
The increased chance of acci
dents, such as that of the student
who was hit by a truck after drink
ing at a fraternity party last Sep
tember, and the increased potential
for date rape as a result of alcohol
consumption must be discussed as
part of the awareness week.
The possibilities of date rape
after the consumption of alcohol
have yet to be explored in sufficient
depth at Stanford. Alcohol "im
pairs a person's ability to say no,
and it makes a person raping you
less responsive to your needs," ac
cording to senior Suzanne O'Brien,
a member of the University Task
Force on Sexual Assault. This week
will hopefully provide a forum for
discussion on such issues.
The alcohol-free weekend will
also give students the opportunity
to realize that the option of going
to a party and not drinking alcohol
is a viable one.
In order to make this week suc
cessful, members of Project R 2 ISC
will need to provide a forum for
discussion of alcohol-related issues
and avoid preaching on the dangers
of alcohol. It's a task they've per
formed well in the past.
