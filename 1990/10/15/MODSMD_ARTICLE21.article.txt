Writer abused rhetoric to justify U.S. Gulf policy

IN HIS VIEWPOINT of Oct. 10,
Michael Rubenstein notes correctly,
as does The Daily's editorial of Oct.
11, that the Middle East Teach-In of
Oct. 9 represented points of view that
were consistently against U.S. military
intervention in the Persian Gulf.
Perhaps the event could have been
titled differently. But it remains the
case that the pro-intervention point of
view is so overwhelmingly represented
in the media that giving voice to criti
cal alternatives was the highest prior
ity of the Teach-in organizers. How
ever, we are not opposed to organizing
debates in the future.
But in attempting to discredit the
Teach-in and Prof. Joel Beinin's view
point of the same date, Rubenstein
resorts to some heavy-handed rhetoric
that deserves a careful, point-by-point
response.
Rubenstein writes, "Leftist, anti-
Zionist professors like Joel Beinin were
given forum to spew out their eco
nomic determinist interpretations of
the regional conflict." Anyone who read
Beinin's article should realize that,
while he places high emphasis on the
economic roots of the conflict, he in
fact has a very complex and nuanced
understanding of the Middle East and
of U.S. foreign policy. Calling him
"leftist" and "anti-Zionist" and refer
ring to his speech as "spewing" are all
rhetorical devices to discredit without
content.
Rubenstein continues, "The real
purpose of events like Monday's is to
promote a convoluted and obsessive
distaste for foreign policies that serve
our national interests." Beinin's article
in fact makes the point that our mili
tary intervention is not in the eco
nomic interest of the U.S. in either the
short run (as the price of oil has
increased more than it would have
otherwise) or in the long run, as U.S.
intervention contributes to the long-

term instability of the Middle East
region.
A shooting war involving the U.S.
would have devastating effects on
U.S.-Arab relations, relations that are
already strained by our government's
policy of indifference to the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank, Gaza,
the Golan Heights and southern
Lebanon.

Beinin's article, in fact,
makes the point that
our military interven
tion is not in the eco
nomic interest of the
U.S.

Rubenstein tries to make the point
that what we are doing is not just
self-interest, it's good for the rest of
the world, too, because the economic
health of the West is important for
investment (and thus the economic
health) of the developing world. "It's
that simple," he claims.
It is not now and has never been
that simple; industrial relations have
never invested in the developing world
with the idea of helping those coun
tries. While such investment has
resulted in better standards of living
for some segments of society in some
developing countries, Western invest
ment has generally ignored the needs
of developing countries to utilize their
own natural and human resources to
their best interest, and has resulted in
the destruction of native agricultural
systems and the undermining of their
cultures and has produced a new
poverty of overwhelming proportions.

In his final five paragraphs,
Rubenstein tries to get to the heart of
the dispute between those who oppose
U.S. military intervention and those
who support it."The issue is world
order."
That Hussein's invasion of Kuwait
raises the issue of world order no one
would deny. Most opponents of U.S.
intervention oppose the invasion of
Kuwait and support U.N. sanctions to
force an Iraqi withdrawal; most also
support the existence of either a multi
national Arab or United Nations
peacekeeping force in Saudi Arabia to
deter further Iraqi aggression.
However, the point of those of us
who oppose U.S. intervention, and a
point which Rubenstein ignores, is that
the U.S. government has no respect for
world order and is cynically manipulat
ing that rhetoric to conceal its other
purposes.
He does note that we "failed in
ignoring the human rights violations
and the proliferation of weaponry in
Iraq." The point, however, is that that
was not a failure; that is U.S. policy,
as practiced around the world. Ignore
human rights violations and belliger
ence when it's in your interest, and
claim the moral high ground when it's
not.
It seems almost unnecessary to
repeat the examples where the U.S.
has shown its blatant contempt for the
United Nations and international law
that it is now claiming to speak for.
The invasion of Panama and the
financing of the Contra war against
Nicaragua, the latter in direct con
tempt of a World Court ruling, should
provide ample evidence of the hypoc
risy of the U.S. in the current situa
tion.
It is true that teach-ins and protests
will not redeem Kuwait's sovereignty.
However, it is not the role of the U.S.
to launch a war to redeem that

sovereignty. If we want to help estab
lish respect for national sovereignty we
should start by respecting it ourselves.
Nor is it our role to destroy Iraq's
chemical arsenal. The U.S. has its own
chemical arsenal, has not hesitated to
use it (remember Vietnam?) and is in
no position to say who shouldn't have
such an arsenal, no less to attempt
militarily to enforce that position. We
strongly support a ban on chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons, but
that ban must be a universal one
rather than one selectively enforced by
the U.S.
We welcome further dialogue with
Rubenstein and others on these issues
because we believe our points will
stand up to scrutiny far better than
those he offers in his letter or those
put forth by the U.S. government. In
the meantime, we urge those opposed
to a U.S. war against Iraq to make
their voices heard.
