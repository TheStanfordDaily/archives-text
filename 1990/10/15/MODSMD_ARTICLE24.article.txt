## Ongoing 'out of control' 
### 
I THINK I'M REALLY beginning to
lose control of myself. I do a lot of
things on impulse now, and it
really worries me that so few of my
decisions these days are based on
rational thinking. Actually, come to
think of it, very few of my actions are
based on any kind of thinking at all,
rational or not.
Just this afternoon, for instance, a
friend and I tied the belts of our
bathrobes together and dangled a teddy
bear with a note attached to it in front
of the window on the floor below us.
We swung the bear against the
window until the occupants of the
room noticed that there was something
hanging out there. We heard a short
debate about who was going to open
the window and retrieve the bear
before the window opened and the
stuffed messenger disappeared inside.
The episode was good for a giggle at
the time, but now it seems kind of
irrational. One minute I was staring
out the window, and the next I was
seized with an urge to lower something
over the side of the building. I've had
strange impulses before, so that in
itself was not surprising. What was
odd was the fact that I actually gave
in to it.
Usually I'm calm and rational and
responsible, but I find myself becoming
less so with each passing day — espe
cially the responsible part.
I've been neglecting my schoolwork
for a good part of the week now.
Every time I sit down to try to get
some work done, a diversion beckons

to me and I follow it. And if there's no
diversion readily apparent, I manufac
ture one. I just make up the errands
for myself.
For example, I will all of a sudden
decide that it is imperative that I do
the laundry at that very minute, even
if I'm in the middle of reading Genesis
32 for one of my classes.
Or it will suddenly and miraculously
be revealed to me that there's a very
important piece of mail that's just
dying to be opened, which requires an
immediate trip to my post office box.
There is, of course, never anything in
the box, but that's never stopped me
before.
Actually, the best diversion is spend
ing money. One day I was really frus
trated because I didn't feel like doing
any work, so I mail-ordered something.
It made me feel much better. I think
the act of purchasing something must
be therapeutic.
I still didn't want to do any work,
but I at least had the satisfaction of
knowing that I had done something
besides look at a blank computer
screen. Besides, I can now look forward
to receiving a package in a couple of
weeks.
But with so many people around,
diversions are usually not in short
supply. There's a dorm congregation in
someone's room almost nightly during
which everything from pick-up tech
nique to the ills of the American jus
tice system are shared and discussed.
I was at such a congregation the
other night when the permanent resi-

dent 9 of the room, who obviously had
more sense than the rest of us,
dropped us a few cues to leave. So
about five of us went into another
room and listened to music for a while.
Then, at around 2 a.m., someone
gets an idea to go to the Rodin sculp
ture garden. So off we go trooping
around campus in the middle of the
night to look at some naked bronze
statues. The conversation wandered
anywhere from the value, or lack of
value, of marriage to the etymology of
colloquial phrases like "screwed up"
and "shafted."
The nagging thought that I had a
test and a midterm coming up followed
me throughout the night, but I man
aged to ignore it. I'm getting good at
that — ignoring nagging thoughts. I
suppose in a perverse way it is a form
of the ultimate self-control. It's really
hard to not think about what you're
thinking about.
Sometimes I fear that my newfound
impulsiveness will get me into some
kind of trouble from which it will be
difficult, if not impossible, to extricate
myself. But then I think, what the
hell, why worry.
