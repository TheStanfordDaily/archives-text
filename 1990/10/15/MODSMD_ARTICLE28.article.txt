## Trojans end Stanford's one-game win streak, 37-22 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Stanford is a great football
team. Until it faces third down.
The Cardinal has had trouble
converting third down plays,
and preventing opponents from
converting them, all season.
USC magnified the problem
Saturday.

Trojans 37

You can't win a ballgame with
out first downs. Although Stan
ford executed brillantly in the
first quarter, it came up against
its old nemesis the remainder of
the contest. And came up short
against the deservedly highly
ranked Trojans.
"They played an aggressive
game. But we did not make the
key plays. We did not convert the
first downs, be it dropping passes,
fumbles, or protection," said run
ning back Glyn Milburn.
"[Third downs] are kind of a
cyclical thing with us," he contin
ued. "It's just a matter of execut
ing plays. Sometimes receivers
were open but we didn't get them
the ball. Sometimes receivers
weren't open but the running
backs would fumble the ball. Just
a lot of things that you can't put
your finger on happened."
But you can put your finger on
the fact that Stanford was three
for 12 in third-down efficiency.
After the first 15 minutes of play
ing time Stanford just couldn't
get that magical first down. It's
hard to get on the scoreboard
without moving 10 yards.
USC, however, thrived on third
down situtions. The Cardinal de
fense did an admirable job of
stopping the potent Trojan of
fense. For two downs, at least.
It seemed like quarterback
Todd Marinovich and the Trojans
repeatedly had their backs up
against it in third-and-long. And
continually converted them for
first downs.
"Definitely the most frustrating
aspect of the game was having
them third-and-13, third-and-18
and not being able to force them
to punt," free safety Jimmy Klein
said. "We've had trouble with that
throughout the year. I don't know
what it's going to take. I guess a
combined team effort."
Stanford had that effort, on
both offense and defense, the first
quarter. It opened the home con

test with a drive to the one-yard
line. Quarterback Jason Palumbis
and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
were on fire.
A fumble on the one halted
drive No. 1.
The Cardinal quickly bounced
back from its turnover, denying
the Trojans a single first down
and driving to USC's 12. But it
could not convert on third-and
seven and had to settle for a field
goal.
The next play, however, J.J.
Lasley forced Trojan kick
returner Curtis Conway to cough
up the ball, and it was Stanford
with a first-and-10 on USC's 26.
Again the Cardinal could not get
past third down, but this time
John Hopkins' 40-yard field goal
attempt was no good.
Three drives. Three points.
You just can't do that against
a team of USC's caliber.
"We showed we had a very ex

plosive offense in the first quarter
but we just weren't coming away
with any points and that's the
key. You win games with more
points," Palumbis said.
"It's frustrating when you drive
to the goal line three times in a
row and come away with three
points. We just kept trying to plug
away but we had some key turn
overs."
The Cardinal finally had a suc
cessful drive 10 minutes into the
first quarter, with Palumbis con
necting on a 22-yarder to McCaf
frey for the TD. Milburn returned
the Trojan's ensuing punt to the
38, and tight end Cory Booker
took Palumbis's bullet over the
middle all the way for a 16-7 Stan
ford advantage. In one period
Stanford amassed 230 yards and
looked like it couldn't be stopped.
But USC was alreday chipping
away at the Cardinal's confidence.
In the second quarter the Car

dinal's frustration, and the
Trojans' ability, became apparent:
penalties, turnovers, dropped
balls.
The first-quarter offensive ma
chine was rendered inept.
"Turnovers and penalties hurt
us a lot. Things that usually never
happen happened today but I
wouldn't call it a fluke, becuase
we just werenut consistent."
Palumbis said.
USC, conversely, was.
After a quarter of searching for
its sync, the mighty Trojan of
fense found its rhythm the second
period. A 77-yard pass from
Marinovich to Gary Wellman put
the Trojans on the board in the
waning minutes of the opening
quarter.
At the half USC led 20-16 and
never looked back.
Stanford, however, still thought
it was very much in the game
when it hit the field after

halftime.
"We were prety confident com
ing into halftime. We just weren't
moving the ball effectively, but
our defense was playing well,"
Palumbis said.
The reason Stanford couldn't
move the ball, and therefore
couldn't score, was the Trojan de
fense.
USC did what Notre Dame
could not last weekend.
It completely shut down Stan
ford's running game. As in no
yards.
Milburn, who can usually find
a hole in a brick wall and break
three tackles in route, was
silenced: nine yards on nine
carries. Tommy Vardell, who
scored four touchdowns last week
end against Notre Dame, gained
a mere five yards on three carries.

Al Green â€” Daily
Coming off the monumental victory over Notre Dame last week, Stanford was unceremoniously returned to earth Saturday by USC.
The Trojans racked up 500 yards of total offense while holding the powerful Cardinal ground attack to only four yards in a 37-22 USC
win.
