## Trojans end Stanford's one-game win streak, 37-22 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Stanford is a great football
team. Until it faces third down.
The Cardinal has had trouble
converting third down plays,
and preventing opponents from
converting them, all season.
USC magnified the problem
Saturday.

Trojans 37

Cardinal 22

You can't win a ballgame with
out first downs. Although Stan
ford executed brillantly in the
first quarter, it came up against
its old nemesis the remainder of
the contest. And came up short
against the deservedly highly
ranked Trojans.
"They played an aggressive
game. But we did not make the
key plays. We did not convert the
first downs, be it dropping passes,
fumbles, or protection," said run
ning back Glyn Milburn.
"[Third downs] are kind of a
cyclical thing with us," he contin
ued. "It's just a matter of execut
ing plays. Sometimes receivers
were open but we didn't get them
the ball. Sometimes receivers
weren't open but the running
backs would fumble the ball. Just
a lot of things that you can't put
your finger on happened."
But you can put your finger on
the fact that Stanford was three
for 12 in third-down efficiency.
After the first 15 minutes of play
ing time Stanford just couldn't
get that magical first down. It's
hard to get on the scoreboard
without moving 10 yards.
USC, however, thrived on third
down situtions. The Cardinal de
fense did an admirable job of
stopping the potent Trojan of
fense. For two downs, at least.
It seemed like quarterback
Todd Marinovich and the Trojans
repeatedly had their backs up
against it in third-and-long. And
continually converted them for
first downs.
"Definitely the most frustrating
aspect of the game was having
them third-and-13, third-and-18
and not being able to force them
to punt," free safety Jimmy Klein
said. "We've had trouble with that
throughout the year. I don't know
what it's going to take. I guess a
combined team effort."
Stanford had that effort, on
both offense and defense, the first
quarter. It opened the home con

test with a drive to the one-yard
line. Quarterback Jason Palumbis
and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
were on fire.
A fumble on the one halted
drive No. 1.
The Cardinal quickly bounced
back from its turnover, denying
the Trojans a single first down
and driving to USC's 12. But it
could not convert on third-and
seven and had to settle for a field
goal.
The next play, however, J.J.
Lasley forced Trojan kick
returner Curtis Conway to cough
up the ball, and it was Stanford
with a first-and-10 on USC's 26.
Again the Cardinal could not get
past third down, but this time
John Hopkins' 40-yard field goal
attempt was no good.
Three drives. Three points.
You just can't do that against
a team of USC's caliber.
"We showed we had a very ex

plosive offense in the first quarter
but we just weren't coming away
with any points and that's the
key. You win games with more
points," Palumbis said.
"It's frustrating when you drive
to the goal line three times in a
row and come away with three
points. We just kept trying to plug
away but we had some key turn
overs."
The Cardinal finally had a suc
cessful drive 10 minutes into the
first quarter, with Palumbis con
necting on a 22-yarder to McCaf
frey for the TD. Milburn returned
the Trojan's ensuing punt to the
38, and tight end Cory Booker
took Palumbis's bullet over the
middle all the way for a 16-7 Stan
ford advantage. In one period
Stanford amassed 230 yards and
looked like it couldn't be stopped.
But USC was alreday chipping
away at the Cardinal's confidence.
In the second quarter the Car

dinal's frustration, and the
Trojans' ability, became apparent:
penalties, turnovers, dropped
balls.
The first-quarter offensive ma
chine was rendered inept.
"Turnovers and penalties hurt
us a lot. Things that usually never
happen happened today but I
wouldn't call it a fluke, becuase
we just werenut consistent."
Palumbis said.
USC, conversely, was.
After a quarter of searching for
its sync, the mighty Trojan of
fense found its rhythm the second
period. A 77-yard pass from
Marinovich to Gary Wellman put
the Trojans on the board in the
waning minutes of the opening
quarter.
At the half USC led 20-16 and
never looked back.
Stanford, however, still thought
it was very much in the game
when it hit the field after

halftime.
"We were prety confident com
ing into halftime. We just weren't
moving the ball effectively, but
our defense was playing well,"
Palumbis said.
The reason Stanford couldn't
move the ball, and therefore
couldn't score, was the Trojan de
fense.
USC did what Notre Dame
could not last weekend.
It completely shut down Stan
ford's running game. As in no
yards.
Milburn, who can usually find
a hole in a brick wall and break
three tackles in route, was
silenced: nine yards on nine
carries. Tommy Vardell, who
scored four touchdowns last week
end against Notre Dame, gained
a mere five yards on three carries.
When sacks are considered, Stan


Al Green — Daily
Coming off the monumental victory over Notre Dame last week, Stanford was unceremoniously returned to earth Saturday by USC.
The Trojans racked up 500 yards of total offense while holding the powerful Cardinal ground attack to only four yards in a 37-22 USC
win.
ford gained a net of four yards
on the ground. Four.
"The running game definitely
was having some problems. They
were playing an aggressive run
defense, and as an offense we have
to have the balanced attack that
we didn't have today," Milburn
said.
When a team shuts you down
on the ground, it knows you only
have one other option.
USC's defense knew the Cardi
nal had to pass the second half.
And made the necessary adjust
ments. It switched from man cov
erage to zone defense, and put
much more pressure on Palumbis.
It's hard to get the ball off when
there are four 300-pound linemen
in your face.
"(The) difference after the first
quarter was the pass rush," said
coach Denny Green. "They did not
give our quarterback time to set
up. We had a fumble, a couple of
dropped passes, things that really
make it difficult for you when

you're throwing the football."
"The pass rush was a lot better
(during the second half),"
Palumbis added. "They knew we
weren't going to run the ball.
That's to USC's credit. They
stopped the run well."
Palumbis did finish the day 30
for 45 for 360 yards and three
touchdowns. McCaffrey snagged
seven receptions for 127 yards,
and two touchdowns. Milburn
brought in 10 for another 90
yards. Chris Walsh, in his first
big game this season, caught five
passes for 48 yards, and Booker
added two for 43 yards and a
score.
But you just can't win on pass
ing alone.
As demonstrated by USC.
The Trojans utilized a very
balanced attack. And Stanford
couldn't stop it.
Usually able to shut down the
run, the Cardinal defense couldn't
get a hold on Mazio Royster, the
Trojan's second-string tailback.
Every time he touched the ball
he powered for five yards, gaining
112 over the afternoon. Fullback
Scott Lockwood added another 45
on the ground.

And Marinovich played like
former Cardinal coach Jack Elway
knew he could. The third-year
sophomore, who turned down
Stanford to throw the ball for the
traditional football powerhouse,
was quite impressive. He came
through with the big plays and
the third-down completions, going
17-for-30 for 338 yards and three
touchdowns.
It was just what the Trojans
needed. And just what Stanford
couldn't halt.
"They were a litle overpowering
offensively. We couldn't quite do
the things we wanted to do and
never really got control of first
down even though we did have
some plays," Green said.
"We basically forced them into
the situation we wanted to —
third and long — but it's been
our nemesis all year," added cor
nerback Kevin Scott. "We haven't
been able to stop teams on third
down. It was the same problem
today."
A key ingredient of the inabilty
was Stanford's lack of a pass rush.
When Marinovich decided to pass,
he had all day.
"I wouldn't really call it a little

trouble," linebacker Jono Tunney
said. "It seems like its been that
way the whole year. The only time
we've been able to get pressure
is when we blitz and we can't do
that every time."
Put Stanford execution troubles
together with USC's abilty and
you have another disappointing
Stanford loss, its fourth of the
year.
This time the team's frustration
was defintely apparent.
"We had a real tough day,"
Palumbis said. "It's really frus
trating when you think you
should win a ballgame and you
don't. This has just happened to
us too many times. I have to give
USC credit, they did a great job
today, especially in the second
half. I'm very disappointed to say
the least."
So is the entire squad.
Card notes
McCaffrey was named the Com
padres' player of the game.
Hopkins' missed PAT after Stan
ford's second touchdown broke his
streak of 71 straight. It is only the
second he has ever missed during his
four years on the Farm.

"They played an aggressive
game. But we did not make the
key plays. We did not convert the
first downs, be it dropping passes,
fumbles, or protection," said run
ning back Glyn Milburn.
"[Third downs] are kind of a
cyclical thing with us," he contin
ued. "It's just a matter of execut
ing plays. Sometimes receivers
were open but we didn't get them
the ball. Sometimes receivers
weren't open but the running
backs would fumble the ball. Just
a lot of things that you can't put
your finger on happened."
But you can put your finger on
the fact that Stanford was three
for 12 in third-down efficiency.
After the first 15 minutes of play
ing time Stanford just couldn't
get that magical first down. It's
hard to get on the scoreboard
without moving 10 yards.
USC, however, thrived on third
down situtions. The Cardinal de
fense did an admirable job of
stopping the potent Trojan of
fense. For two downs, at least.
It seemed like quarterback
Todd Marinovich and the Trojans
repeatedly had their backs up
against it in third-and-long. And
continually converted them for
first downs.
"Definitely the most frustrating
aspect of the game was having
them third-and-13, third-and-18
and not being able to force them
to punt," free safety Jimmy Klein
said. "We've had trouble with that
throughout the year. I don't know
what it's going to take. I guess a
combined team effort."
Stanford had that effort, on
both offense and defense, the first
quarter. It opened the home con

test with a drive to the one-yard
line. Quarterback Jason Palumbis
and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
were on fire.
A fumble on the one halted
drive No. 1.
The Cardinal quickly bounced
back from its turnover, denying
the Trojans a single first down
and driving to USC's 12. But it
could not convert on third-and
seven and had to settle for a field
goal.
The next play, however, J.J.
Lasley forced Trojan kick
returner Curtis Conway to cough
up the ball, and it was Stanford
with a first-and-10 on USC's 26.
Again the Cardinal could not get
past third down, but this time
John Hopkins' 40-yard field goal
attempt was no good.
Three drives. Three points.
You just can't do that against
a team of USC's caliber.
"We showed we had a very ex

plosive offense in the first quarter
but we just weren't coming away
with any points and that's the
key. You win games with more
points," Palumbis said.
"It's frustrating when you drive
to the goal line three times in a
row and come away with three
points. We just kept trying to plug
away but we had some key turn
overs."
The Cardinal finally had a suc
cessful drive 10 minutes into the
first quarter, with Palumbis con
necting on a 22-yarder to McCaf
frey for the TD. Milburn returned
the Trojan's ensuing punt to the
38, and tight end Cory Booker
took Palumbis's bullet over the
middle all the way for a 16-7 Stan
ford advantage. In one period
Stanford amassed 230 yards and
looked like it couldn't be stopped.
But USC was alreday chipping
away at the Cardinal's confidence.
In the second quarter the Car

dinal's frustration, and the
Trojans' ability, became apparent:
penalties, turnovers, dropped
balls.
The first-quarter offensive ma
chine was rendered inept.
"Turnovers and penalties hurt
us a lot. Things that usually never
happen happened today but I
wouldn't call it a fluke, becuase
we just werenut consistent."
Palumbis said.
USC, conversely, was.
After a quarter of searching for
its sync, the mighty Trojan of
fense found its rhythm the second
period. A 77-yard pass from
Marinovich to Gary Wellman put
the Trojans on the board in the
waning minutes of the opening
quarter.
At the half USC led 20-16 and
never looked back.
Stanford, however, still thought
it was very much in the game
when it hit the field after

halftime.
"We were prety confident com
ing into halftime. We just weren't
moving the ball effectively, but
our defense was playing well,"
Palumbis said.
The reason Stanford couldn't
move the ball, and therefore
couldn't score, was the Trojan de
fense.
USC did what Notre Dame
could not last weekend.
It completely shut down Stan
ford's running game. As in no
yards.
Milburn, who can usually find
a hole in a brick wall and break
three tackles in route, was
silenced: nine yards on nine
carries. Tommy Vardell, who
scored four touchdowns last week
end against Notre Dame, gained
a mere five yards on three carries.
When sacks are considered, Stan


Al Green — Daily
Coming off the monumental victory over Notre Dame last week, Stanford was unceremoniously returned to earth Saturday by USC.
The Trojans racked up 500 yards of total offense while holding the powerful Cardinal ground attack to only four yards in a 37-22 USC
win.
ford gained a net of four yards
on the ground. Four.
"The running game definitely
was having some problems. They
were playing an aggressive run
defense, and as an offense we have
to have the balanced attack that
we didn't have today," Milburn
said.
When a team shuts you down
on the ground, it knows you only
have one other option.
USC's defense knew the Cardi
nal had to pass the second half.
And made the necessary adjust
ments. It switched from man cov
erage to zone defense, and put
much more pressure on Palumbis.
It's hard to get the ball off when
there are four 300-pound linemen
in your face.
"(The) difference after the first
quarter was the pass rush," said
coach Denny Green. "They did not
give our quarterback time to set
up. We had a fumble, a couple of
dropped passes, things that really
make it difficult for you when

you're throwing the football."
"The pass rush was a lot better
(during the second half),"
Palumbis added. "They knew we
weren't going to run the ball.
That's to USC's credit. They
stopped the run well."
Palumbis did finish the day 30
for 45 for 360 yards and three
touchdowns. McCaffrey snagged
seven receptions for 127 yards,
and two touchdowns. Milburn
brought in 10 for another 90
yards. Chris Walsh, in his first
big game this season, caught five
passes for 48 yards, and Booker
added two for 43 yards and a
score.
But you just can't win on pass
ing alone.
As demonstrated by USC.
The Trojans utilized a very
balanced attack. And Stanford
couldn't stop it.
Usually able to shut down the
run, the Cardinal defense couldn't
get a hold on Mazio Royster, the
Trojan's second-string tailback.
Every time he touched the ball
he powered for five yards, gaining
112 over the afternoon. Fullback
Scott Lockwood added another 45
on the ground.

And Marinovich played like
former Cardinal coach Jack Elway
knew he could. The third-year
sophomore, who turned down
Stanford to throw the ball for the
traditional football powerhouse,
was quite impressive. He came
through with the big plays and
the third-down completions, going
17-for-30 for 338 yards and three
touchdowns.
It was just what the Trojans
needed. And just what Stanford
couldn't halt.
"They were a litle overpowering
offensively. We couldn't quite do
the things we wanted to do and
never really got control of first
down even though we did have
some plays," Green said.
"We basically forced them into
the situation we wanted to —
third and long — but it's been
our nemesis all year," added cor
nerback Kevin Scott. "We haven't
been able to stop teams on third
down. It was the same problem
today."
A key ingredient of the inabilty
was Stanford's lack of a pass rush.
When Marinovich decided to pass,
he had all day.
"I wouldn't really call it a little

trouble," linebacker Jono Tunney
said. "It seems like its been that
way the whole year. The only time
we've been able to get pressure
is when we blitz and we can't do
that every time."
Put Stanford execution troubles
together with USC's abilty and
you have another disappointing
Stanford loss, its fourth of the
year.
This time the team's frustration
was defintely apparent.
"We had a real tough day,"
Palumbis said. "It's really frus
trating when you think you
should win a ballgame and you
don't. This has just happened to
us too many times. I have to give
USC credit, they did a great job
today, especially in the second
half. I'm very disappointed to say
the least."
So is the entire squad.
Card notes
McCaffrey was named the Com
padres' player of the game.
Hopkins' missed PAT after Stan
ford's second touchdown broke his
streak of 71 straight. It is only the
second he has ever missed during his
four years on the Farm.
Stanford is a great football
team. Until it faces third down.
The Cardinal has had trouble
converting third down plays,
and preventing opponents from
converting them, all season.
USC magnified the problem

the fact that Stanford was three
for 12 in third-down efficiency.
After the first 15 minutes of play
ing time Stanford just couldn't
get that magical first down. It's
hard to get on the scoreboard
without moving 10 yards.
USC, however, thrived on third
down situtions. The Cardinal de
fense did an admirable job of
stopping the potent Trojan of
fense. For two downs, at least.
It seemed like quarterback
Todd Marinovich and the Trojans
repeatedly had their backs up
against it in third-and-long. And
continually converted them for
first downs.
"Definitely the most frustrating
aspect of the game was having
them third-and-13, third-and-18
and not being able to force them
to punt," free safety Jimmy Klein
said. "We've had trouble with that
throughout the year. I don't know
what it's going to take. I guess a
combined team effort."
Stanford had that effort, on
both offense and defense, the first
quarter. It opened the home con

test with a drive to the one-yard
line. Quarterback Jason Palumbis
and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
were on fire.
A fumble on the one halted
drive No. 1.
The Cardinal quickly bounced
back from its turnover, denying
the Trojans a single first down
and driving to USC's 12. But it
could not convert on third-and
seven and had to settle for a field
goal.
The next play, however, J.J.
Lasley forced Trojan kick
returner Curtis Conway to cough
up the ball, and it was Stanford
with a first-and-10 on USC's 26.
Again the Cardinal could not get
past third down, but this time
John Hopkins' 40-yard field goal
attempt was no good.
Three drives. Three points.
You just can't do that against
a team of USC's caliber.
"We showed we had a very ex

plosive offense in the first quarter
but we just weren't coming away
with any points and that's the
key. You win games with more
points," Palumbis said.
"It's frustrating when you drive
to the goal line three times in a
row and come away with three
points. We just kept trying to plug
away but we had some key turn
overs."
The Cardinal finally had a suc
cessful drive 10 minutes into the
first quarter, with Palumbis con
necting on a 22-yarder to McCaf
frey for the TD. Milburn returned
the Trojan's ensuing punt to the
38, and tight end Cory Booker
took Palumbis's bullet over the
middle all the way for a 16-7 Stan
ford advantage. In one period
Stanford amassed 230 yards and
looked like it couldn't be stopped.
But USC was alreday chipping
away at the Cardinal's confidence.
In the second quarter the Car

dinal's frustration, and the
Trojans' ability, became apparent:
penalties, turnovers, dropped
balls.
The first-quarter offensive ma
chine was rendered inept.
"Turnovers and penalties hurt
us a lot. Things that usually never
happen happened today but I
wouldn't call it a fluke, becuase
we just werenut consistent."
Palumbis said.
USC, conversely, was.
After a quarter of searching for
its sync, the mighty Trojan of
fense found its rhythm the second
period. A 77-yard pass from
Marinovich to Gary Wellman put
the Trojans on the board in the
waning minutes of the opening
quarter.
At the half USC led 20-16 and
never looked back.
Stanford, however, still thought
it was very much in the game
when it hit the field after

halftime.
"We were prety confident com
ing into halftime. We just weren't
moving the ball effectively, but
our defense was playing well,"
Palumbis said.
The reason Stanford couldn't
move the ball, and therefore
couldn't score, was the Trojan de
fense.
USC did what Notre Dame
could not last weekend.
It completely shut down Stan
ford's running game. As in no
yards.
Milburn, who can usually find
a hole in a brick wall and break
three tackles in route, was
silenced: nine yards on nine
carries. Tommy Vardell, who
scored four touchdowns last week
end against Notre Dame, gained
a mere five yards on three carries.
When sacks are considered, Stan


Al Green — Daily
Coming off the monumental victory over Notre Dame last week, Stanford was unceremoniously returned to earth Saturday by USC.
The Trojans racked up 500 yards of total offense while holding the powerful Cardinal ground attack to only four yards in a 37-22 USC
win.
ford gained a net of four yards
on the ground. Four.
"The running game definitely
was having some problems. They
were playing an aggressive run
defense, and as an offense we have
to have the balanced attack that
we didn't have today," Milburn
said.
When a team shuts you down
on the ground, it knows you only
have one other option.
USC's defense knew the Cardi
nal had to pass the second half.
And made the necessary adjust
ments. It switched from man cov
erage to zone defense, and put
much more pressure on Palumbis.
It's hard to get the ball off when
there are four 300-pound linemen
in your face.
"(The) difference after the first
quarter was the pass rush," said
coach Denny Green. "They did not
give our quarterback time to set
up. We had a fumble, a couple of
dropped passes, things that really
make it difficult for you when

you're throwing the football."
"The pass rush was a lot better
(during the second half),"
Palumbis added. "They knew we
weren't going to run the ball.
That's to USC's credit. They
stopped the run well."
Palumbis did finish the day 30
for 45 for 360 yards and three
touchdowns. McCaffrey snagged
seven receptions for 127 yards,
and two touchdowns. Milburn
brought in 10 for another 90
yards. Chris Walsh, in his first
big game this season, caught five
passes for 48 yards, and Booker
added two for 43 yards and a
score.
But you just can't win on pass
ing alone.
As demonstrated by USC.
The Trojans utilized a very
balanced attack. And Stanford
couldn't stop it.
Usually able to shut down the
run, the Cardinal defense couldn't
get a hold on Mazio Royster, the
Trojan's second-string tailback.
Every time he touched the ball
he powered for five yards, gaining
112 over the afternoon. Fullback
Scott Lockwood added another 45
on the ground.

And Marinovich played like
former Cardinal coach Jack Elway
knew he could. The third-year
sophomore, who turned down
Stanford to throw the ball for the
traditional football powerhouse,
was quite impressive. He came
through with the big plays and
the third-down completions, going
17-for-30 for 338 yards and three
touchdowns.
It was just what the Trojans
needed. And just what Stanford
couldn't halt.
"They were a litle overpowering
offensively. We couldn't quite do
the things we wanted to do and
never really got control of first
down even though we did have
some plays," Green said.
"We basically forced them into
the situation we wanted to —
third and long — but it's been
our nemesis all year," added cor
nerback Kevin Scott. "We haven't
been able to stop teams on third
down. It was the same problem
today."
A key ingredient of the inabilty
was Stanford's lack of a pass rush.
When Marinovich decided to pass,
he had all day.
"I wouldn't really call it a little

trouble," linebacker Jono Tunney
said. "It seems like its been that
way the whole year. The only time
we've been able to get pressure
is when we blitz and we can't do
that every time."
Put Stanford execution troubles
together with USC's abilty and
you have another disappointing
Stanford loss, its fourth of the
year.
This time the team's frustration
was defintely apparent.
"We had a real tough day,"
Palumbis said. "It's really frus
trating when you think you
should win a ballgame and you
don't. This has just happened to
us too many times. I have to give
USC credit, they did a great job
today, especially in the second
half. I'm very disappointed to say
the least."
So is the entire squad.
Card notes
McCaffrey was named the Com
padres' player of the game.
Hopkins' missed PAT after Stan
ford's second touchdown broke his
streak of 71 straight. It is only the
second he has ever missed during his
four years on the Farm.
Stanford is a great football
team. Until it faces third down.
The Cardinal has had trouble
converting third down plays,
and preventing opponents from
converting them, all season.
USC magnified the problem
Saturday.

You can't win a ballgame with
out first downs. Although Stan
ford executed brillantly in the
first quarter, it came up against
its old nemesis the remainder of
the contest. And came up short
against the deservedly highly
ranked Trojans.
"They played an aggressive
game. But we did not make the
key plays. We did not convert the
first downs, be it dropping passes,
fumbles, or protection," said run
ning back Glyn Milburn.
"[Third downs] are kind of a
cyclical thing with us," he contin
ued. "It's just a matter of execut

were open but we didn't get them
the ball. Sometimes receivers
weren't open but the running
backs would fumble the ball. Just
a lot of things that you can't put
