# USC football team lives up to past

### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
USC looked a little less in
timidating before Saturday's
game than they have in a while.
For one thing, they had been
beaten — and Dadly — by Wash
ington. The point spread was
down to a single digit.
USC had lost four star defen
sive players to the NFL. On of
fense, receiver John Jackson had
also graduated. Sure, they still
had Todd Marinovich, but their
starting tailback, Ricky Ervins,
was out. Their big play potential
seemed to be missing, and they
were vulnerable for a defeat.
As it turned out, however, the
Trojans had plenty of big plays
to spare. Most of the big plays
were supplied by the defense,
supposedly in a rebuilding stage,
and mostly in the second half,
when USC pulled away.
USC ranked only sixth in the
Pacific 10 Conference in total
defense coming into the game,
but sacks ana turnovers, pro
vided by the defensive line in
particular, decided Saturday's
game.
In the first half, the Trojan
defense was tough on the Car
dinal running attack, as wit
nessed by the minus three yards
on the ground that Stanford had
at intermission. But quarter
back Jason Palumbis had the
Cardinal's short-passing game
clicking, and ridaled the USC
secondary for 275 yards in the
half.
Then, in the second half, it
became clear that Stanford was
overmatched in the trenches.
The Trojan defense, confident
that the Cardinal could not run
on them, concentrated on rush
ing Palumbis. They came up
with enough sacks and big plays
to shut down Stanford with just
six points the rest of the way.
USC's four sacks in the second
half could have been 14, as
Palumbis was hurried on nearly
every play.
"When they stop the running
attack," Palumbis said, "you
know you have to pass."
Trojan linebacker Scott Ross
said that he was on his heels
the whole second half getting
ready to drop into pass coverage,
because he knew that Stanford
would go to the air.
The defensive line, likewise,
felt free to surge in immediately
and rush Palumbis.
"We picked it up (the pass
rush) sometimes, ' Stanford
coach Dennis Green said, "but
they had an excellent pass rush.
A pass rush affects your ability
to comfortably go out and throw
the ball."
The result was a stifled Car
dinal passing game. Palumbis
was 12 of 18 in the second half,
but the completions went for
onlv 85 yards. The running at
tack gained only seven more.
USC switched from man-to
man coverage to a zone, and
even the short passes weren't
moving the offense like they had
in the first half.
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey,
who burned the Trojan defense
for 125 first-half yards, had only
one catch for two yards in the
second half.

"USC is a great team," McCaf
frey said. "They have great
[defensive backs] and a great
pass rush."

'USC is a great
team.'
— Ed McCaffrey

On the game, USC came up
with five sacks of Palumbis, in
cluding one that forced a fumble
with 2:15 left in the half and
may have been the turning point
in the game.
The Cardinal was down by
only one point at the time of
the fumble, 17-16, but was out-!
scored 20-6 from then on.
The Trojans recovered three
Stanford fumbles in all, and
picked off one pass. The inter
ception, with 1:15 to go in the
game, was inconsequential, but
it sealed the fate of the Cardinal
and was indicative of the whole
second half, in which the USC
defense just took control of the
game.
