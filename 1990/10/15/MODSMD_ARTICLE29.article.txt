# USC football team lives up to past

USC looked a little less in
timidating before Saturday's
game than they have in a while.
For one thing, they had been
beaten — and Dadly — by Wash
ington. The point spread was
down to a single digit.
USC had lost four star defen
sive players to the NFL. On of
fense, receiver John Jackson had
also graduated. Sure, they still
had Todd Marinovich, but their
starting tailback, Ricky Ervins,
was out. Their big play potential
seemed to be missing, and they
were vulnerable for a defeat.
As it turned out, however, the
Trojans had plenty of big plays
to spare. Most of the big plays
were supplied by the defense,
supposedly in a rebuilding stage,
and mostly in the second half,
when USC pulled away.
USC ranked only sixth in the
Pacific 10 Conference in total
defense coming into the game,
but sacks ana turnovers, pro
vided by the defensive line in
particular, decided Saturday's
game.
In the first half, the Trojan
defense was tough on the Car
dinal running attack, as wit
nessed by the minus three yards
on the ground that Stanford had
at intermission. But quarter
back Jason Palumbis had the
Cardinal's short-passing game
clicking, and ridaled the USC
secondary for 275 yards in the
half.
Then, in the second half, it
became clear that Stanford was
overmatched in the trenches.
The Trojan defense, confident
that the Cardinal could not run
on them, concentrated on rush
ing Palumbis. They came up
with enough sacks and big plays
to shut down Stanford with just
six points the rest of the way.
USC's four sacks in the second
half could have been 14, as
Palumbis was hurried on nearly
every play.
"When they stop the running
attack," Palumbis said, "you
know you have to pass."
Trojan linebacker Scott Ross
said that he was on his heels
the whole second half getting
ready to drop into pass coverage,
