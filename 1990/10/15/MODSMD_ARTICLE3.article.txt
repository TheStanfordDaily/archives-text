# Smoke and mirrors
## Roble residents evacuated Friday due to unattended saucepan 
### 
Roble residents were forced to
evacuate at 8:60 a.m. Friday morning
when maintenance workers smelled
smoke coming from a kitchenette on
the second floor.
The fumes were caused by a
saucepan left unattended on a stove
in the kitchenette, firefighters deter
mined after they arrived. When all of
the water in the pan had boiled off,
a residue left in the pan began to
smolder.
Residents had to wait outside for

about 45 minutes while firefighters
checked the entire building to make
sure the fumes were not coming from
another source, a resident said.
A group of students who smelled
the smoke first tried to find its source,
according to freshman Eric Grasser,
a second-floor resident.
"We went upstairs and downstairs,
and the smoke wasn't coming from
any of the rooms," Grasser said.
He added they were about to check
the kitchenette when they met up with

two custodians who had also smelled
the smoke.
The custodians then told them
everyone had to leave the building
and said Grasser should set off the
fire alarm to help do so, he said.
Many of the residents were asleep
or eating breakfast when the alarm
went off. Nonetheless, people in the
house heeded the alarm and used the
appropriate fire exits.
Three fire trucks, a battalion chief
and a police car responded.
