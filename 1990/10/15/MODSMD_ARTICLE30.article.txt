Cardinal 3

Cornhuskers 0

The sixth-ranked Cardinal buried any
doubts they couldn't play with the best,
shelling the highly-touted Cornhuskers
in three straight games, 15-8, 15-10, 15-8
Friday night. In winning the Stanford
Invitational, the Cardinal unveiled its
best team performance of the season and
gained considerable momentum for its
upcoming road trip to Southern Califor
nia.
"That was our best match of the year,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said. "We were
better in every phase of the game."
Probably the most improved phase was
mental. While the Cardinal this season
has clobbered every team ranked below
it, the squad has had its difficulties with
teams ranked above. In high-intensity
matches with No. 3 University of the
Pacific and No. 2 UCLA, Stanford
struggled with the basics.
"For the first time," starting outside
hitter Jennifer Jackson said, "we didn't
take this as a pressure game."
The results were instantaneous. Stan
ford punished Nebraska's hardwood as
first-team Ail-American Bev Oden and
All-Pacific 10 Conference middle blocker
Amy Cooper went berzerk. "Those two
are awfully hard to stop," Shaw said.
"They're so quick to the ball that they
put a lot of pressure on the other teams."
Cooper is fast raising the standards of
newsworthy hitting percentages. The
Aurora, 111. product hit .600 against the
Cornhuskers while tallying 12 kills and
two blocks. Cooper committed no attack
errors on the night.
In her last three matches, she has hit
1.000, .571 and .600. During the past

week, she attacked at a .702 clip. For
her astonishing performances, Cooper
was named to the All-Tournament team.
Oden, who attacked from every position
and angle on the court, took on an air
of invincibility Friday night. The sopho
more hitter struck at will against Ne
braska, collecting a match-high 22 kills
in only three games while hitting .528.
Oden made life miserable for the
Cornhuskers' big hitters, collecting four
blocks. She was subsequently honored as
the invitational's most valuable player.
This season, the sophomore sensation has
been named MVP of both tournaments
in which Stanford has participated.
"We played out of our minds," Oden
said, "it wasn't like before when we
freaked out against a team that was
ranked higher than us. We came out con
fident and we stayed steady throughout
the match."
That confidence resulted directly in a
4-1 first-game spurt. Oden and Cooper
both offered two kills apiece in the run
while senior Jessica Benton served the
first of her two aces on the night.
Nebraska's All-America setter Val
Novak remained poised throughout the
game. She dumped a ball over the net
to pull the Cornhuskers to 2-4 and was
instrumental as Nebraska traded sideouts
with the Cardinal.
Oden nevertheless continued to pound
away as she slammed Stanford to a 10-4
advantage. At 10-7, after a spectacular
dig by Kathy Jurgens, Carrie Feldman
set Oden who converted another of her
12 first-game kills. The scoring stalled
with Stanford ahead 12-7. The teams
traded seven sideouts before the Cardinal
struck for point 13.
Cooper singlehandedly sealed the game
for Stanford with a sideout kill and two
consecutive aces. "It felt natural out
there," Cooper said. "We finally played
as a team. We just executed much better."
Nebraska noticed. Stanford hit a sky
high .404 in the first game recording 21
kills and only two attack errors. "I
thought they played very well," Nebraska
outside hitter Eileen Shannon said.
"They are very powerful."
The Cornhuskers showed some power
of their own in launching to a 3-0 ad
vantage in game two. In the run, middle
blocker Stephanie Thater made a
monstrous block of a Stanford attack.
Despite a kill by Oden at 1-3, Nebraska
struck three more times, forcing Shaw
to call timeout.
Whatever he said, the Cardinal got the

idea. Cooper emerged from the team
huddle to put down two kills and assist
in a block with setter Feldman.
Co-captain Kristin Klein subsequently
contributed two of her 14 kills to run
Stanford back into the contest. The Car
dinal caught the Cornhuskers at 6-6 and
then sped furiously ahead.
Jackson struck four kills and Benton
roofed an attack as Stanford sizzled on
a 6-1 run. Cooper finalized matters with
a tremendous kill at 13-9. She finished
game two with five kills in five attacks.
"I get fired up when the setter starts
setting me," Cooper said.
Nebraska's problem was that Feldman
was setting others as well — to equally
impressive results. Left-side attacker
Jackson hit .304 during the match. Klein
hit .290 and recorded a team-high eight

digs. The team as a whole hit .366 on
the night, 100 points higher than Ne
braska's high-voltage attack.
As the noise in Maples mounted and
the enormity of their task became clear,
the machine that is Nebraska came un
done. The Cornhuskers committed six
reception errors in addition to blowing
numerous passes, stalling their offensive
machinery.
"We didn't play well tonight," Ne
braska standout Shannon said. "Our
chemistry, our communication was
missing."
Stanford exploited their letdown,
seizing game three in no-doubt-about-it
fashion. Thanks to five Klein kills, the
Cardinal burst to a 7-1 advantage in the
final game. Cooper and Oden proved too
much to handle as Stanford coasted in.

"It's very exciting," said Jurgens who
started the match and contributed six
digs. "We were confident; we just went
for it."
Indeed they did. The Cardinal out
blocked, outhit, outserved and outplayed
a team that had lost only one match all
season and had been ranked first or sec
ond all year. For their efforts, Stanford
will likely drop the Cornhuskers from
their No. 1 pedestal atop the NCAA poll
when the new rankings are announced
this week.
Stanford has won seven consecutive
matches and has swept its last five op
ponents in improving to a 13-2 season
mark. For their outstanding perform
ances in the tournament, Cooper, Klein,
and setter Feldman were named to the
All-Tournament team.
