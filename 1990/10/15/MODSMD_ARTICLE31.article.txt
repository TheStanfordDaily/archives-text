# Third-ranked water polo topples USC, Fresno State
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Don't go late to any Stanford water
polo games this year. If you do, then you
might miss the entire game.
You see, so far this year the Cardinal
has made it a habit of jumping out to
commanding leads in the early going and
then holding on for the victory.

Cardinal 9, Trojans 6

Cardinal 12, Bulldogs 10

This weekend against Fresno State and
USC was no different. Against Fresno
State yesterday, the Cardinal quickly
opened up a 6-1 lead and held off a
furious Fresno rally to win the game
12-10. And against USC the morning
before, Stanford sprinted past the
Trojans, taking 4-0 and 8-3 leads, before
eventually prevailing by a score of 9-6.
Junior dreg Morris tried to explain
the team's great starts. "We're really
coming out strong and just playing ex
tremely well as a group,' he said.
"There s not one thing I can point to,
other than that we're just doing every
thing right at the beginning of the
games."
Senior Rick McNair added, "At the
start of the games, nobody seems to be
hesitating and afraid to snoot the ball,
so we're getting off a lot of shots. They

might not all go in, but a lot of them
are, and this is giving us good leads."
Coach Dante Dettamanti is obviously
pleased with how his team has been start
ing out the games. "It's certainly a good
sign to start out so well. The true quality
of a team is the beginning of a game
when all the starters are in, and we've
been dominating during these times."
So dominating that by the end of the
first quarter, or at the latest, halftime,
the Cardinal have pretty much had the
games locked away. Yesterday's game
against the No. 8 Bulldogs from Fresno
was a perfect example of this early dom
ination. After Stanford took the huge
lead behind Greg Olson's two first-period
goals, the game was never in question
and even five fourth-period goals by
Fresno were not enough to cause any
concern on the Stanford bench.
"We played really well today in all
aspects of the game," Dettamanti said.
"Our offense produced 12 goals, which
is right about the number we want, and
our defense was pretty darn good also."
Besides Olson, who wound up with
three goals, McNair, Morris, and sopho
more J.T. Matarangas also had big days,
respectively scoring three, two and two
goals. Junior goalie Jim Cairns also did
a commendable job in the goal, making
seven saves and only letting in five
Fresno goals before the fourth quarter.

country, was supposed to give the Car

morning dew had even had a
chance to dry up on the grass,
this game was over as well.
With the offense executing
and the defense playing super
bly, the Cardinal was never chal
lenged by the Trojans and held
on for the victory. USC did close
to within 8-6 in the fourth pe
riod, but a spectacular Stanford
goal ended all thoughts of a USC
comeback.
On a 6-on-5 advantage situa
tion, Olson grabbed the rebound
of a missecf shot and with his
back to the goal, flipped the ball
to teammate Bob Sternfels who
was right in front of the cage.
The goalie came out to Sternfels,
who proceeded to tap the ball
over nis head almost into the
goal. Then, Matarangas beat the
defense to the ball and pushed
it in to climax the exciting goal.
After convincingly defeating
these two top teams, Stanford
has solidified its hold on the
number three ranking in the na
tion. As Morris said, "These
wins will only add to our con
fidence. We're soundlv beating
everybody who is ranked below
us, and now we just need to
beat the teams that are ranked
ahead of us."
The Cardinal will get this
chance almost immediately, as
the team's next game will be
against No. 2 UCLA.

defense to the ball and pushed
it in to climax the exciting goal.
After convincingly defeating
these two top teams, Stanford
has solidified its hold on the
number three ranking in the na
tion. As Morris said, "These
wins will only add to our con
fidence. We're soundlv beating
everybody who is ranked below
us, and now we just need to
beat the teams that are ranked
ahead of us."
The Cardinal will get this
chance almost immediately, as
the team's next game will be
against No. 2 UCLA.

might miss the entire game.
You see, so far this year the Cardinal
has made it a habit of jumping out to
commanding leads in the early going and
then holding on for the victory.

Cardinal 9, Trojans 6

Cardinal 12, Bulldogs 10

This weekend against Fresno State and
USC was no different. Against Fresno
State yesterday, the Cardinal quickly
opened up a 6-1 lead and held off a
furious Fresno rally to win the game
12-10. And against USC the morning
before, Stanford sprinted past the
Trojans, taking 4-0 and 8-3 leads, before
eventually prevailing by a score of 9-6.
Junior dreg Morris tried to explain
the team's great starts. "We're really
coming out strong and just playing ex
tremely well as a group,' he said.
"There s not one thing I can point to,
other than that we're just doing every
thing right at the beginning of the
games."
Senior Rick McNair added, "At the
start of the games, nobody seems to be
hesitating and afraid to snoot the ball,
so we're getting off a lot of shots. They

might not all go in, but a lot of them
are, and this is giving us good leads."
Coach Dante Dettamanti is obviously
pleased with how his team has been start
ing out the games. "It's certainly a good
sign to start out so well. The true quality
of a team is the beginning of a game
when all the starters are in, and we've
been dominating during these times."
So dominating that by the end of the
first quarter, or at the latest, halftime,
the Cardinal have pretty much had the
games locked away. Yesterday's game
against the No. 8 Bulldogs from Fresno
was a perfect example of this early dom
ination. After Stanford took the huge
lead behind Greg Olson's two first-period
goals, the game was never in question
and even five fourth-period goals by
Fresno were not enough to cause any
concern on the Stanford bench.
"We played really well today in all
aspects of the game," Dettamanti said.
"Our offense produced 12 goals, which
is right about the number we want, and
our defense was pretty darn good also."
Besides Olson, who wound up with
three goals, McNair, Morris, and sopho
more J.T. Matarangas also had big days,
respectively scoring three, two and two
goals. Junior goalie Jim Cairns also did
a commendable job in the goal, making
seven saves and only letting in five
Fresno goals before the fourth quarter.

country, was supposed to give the Car

morning dew had even had a
chance to dry up on the grass,
this game was over as well.
With the offense executing
and the defense playing super
bly, the Cardinal was never chal
lenged by the Trojans and held
on for the victory. USC did close
to within 8-6 in the fourth pe
riod, but a spectacular Stanford
goal ended all thoughts of a USC
comeback.
On a 6-on-5 advantage situa
tion, Olson grabbed the rebound
of a missecf shot and with his
back to the goal, flipped the ball
to teammate Bob Sternfels who
was right in front of the cage.
The goalie came out to Sternfels,
who proceeded to tap the ball
over nis head almost into the
goal. Then, Matarangas beat the
defense to the ball and pushed
it in to climax the exciting goal.
