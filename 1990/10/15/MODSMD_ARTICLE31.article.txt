## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Don't go late to any Stanford water
polo games this year. If you do, then you
might miss the entire game.
You see, so far this year the Cardinal
has made it a habit of jumping out to
commanding leads in the early going and
then holding on for the victory.

Cardinal 9, Trojans 6

Cardinal 12, Bulldogs 10

This weekend against Fresno State and
USC was no different. Against Fresno
State yesterday, the Cardinal quickly
opened up a 6-1 lead and held off a
furious Fresno rally to win the game
12-10. And against USC the morning
before, Stanford sprinted past the
Trojans, taking 4-0 and 8-3 leads, before
eventually prevailing by a score of 9-6.
Junior dreg Morris tried to explain
the team's great starts. "We're really
coming out strong and just playing ex
tremely well as a group,' he said.
"There s not one thing I can point to,
other than that we're just doing every
thing right at the beginning of the
games."
Senior Rick McNair added, "At the
start of the games, nobody seems to be
hesitating and afraid to snoot the ball,
so we're getting off a lot of shots. They

might not all go in, but a lot of them
are, and this is giving us good leads."
Coach Dante Dettamanti is obviously
pleased with how his team has been start
ing out the games. "It's certainly a good
sign to start out so well. The true quality
of a team is the beginning of a game
when all the starters are in, and we've
been dominating during these times."
So dominating that by the end of the
first quarter, or at the latest, halftime,
the Cardinal have pretty much had the
games locked away. Yesterday's game
against the No. 8 Bulldogs from Fresno
was a perfect example of this early dom
ination. After Stanford took the huge
lead behind Greg Olson's two first-period
goals, the game was never in question
and even five fourth-period goals by
Fresno were not enough to cause any
concern on the Stanford bench.
"We played really well today in all
aspects of the game," Dettamanti said.
"Our offense produced 12 goals, which
is right about the number we want, and
our defense was pretty darn good also."
Besides Olson, who wound up with
three goals, McNair, Morris, and sopho
more J.T. Matarangas also had big days,
respectively scoring three, two and two
goals. Junior goalie Jim Cairns also did
a commendable job in the goal, making
seven saves and only letting in five
Fresno goals before the fourth quarter.
USC, the No. 5-ranked team in the
country, was supposed to give the Car
dinal a tough test on Saturday at
