# Ninth-ranked women tie fifth-ranked Colorado College
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The women's sofccer team
would like to have switched to
sowjy Maloney Field for the sec
ona half of yesterday's 1-1 tie
with No. 6 Colorado College.
With Maloney temporarily
closed due tp a sprinkler acci
dent the night before, No. 9
Stanford played the Tigers on
an adjacent practice fiela. Soph
omore standout Julie Foudy put
Stanford on top with an unas
sisted first-hair goal, but Stan
ford's prevent defense might
have appreciated some help
from operations and mainte
nance in bogging down quick
Colorado College in the second
half.
Stanford will return to
Maloney today for a scheduled
3:30 swamp battle against No.
7 William and Mary in the sec
ond game of a four-game streak
against NCAA tournament
bound teams. The Tribe was un
ceremoniously thumped 4-1 by
No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara yester
day in a game also played at
Stanford.
Colorado College emloited nu
merous leaks in Stanford's
second-half shell defense before
Cissy Wafford converted a
penalty kick 29 minutes into the
stanza. In the second half and
30-minute overtime, Colorado
College out-shot Stanford 14-4
and dictated the tempo on its
offensive end of the field.
The tie was reminiscent of
Stanford's last home game
against a top contender, No. 1
Santa Clara. In that Sept. 29
game, Foudy scored a brilliant
goal in the first half, but Stan
ford's prevent defense was pen
etrated for two second-naif
scores in a frustrating 2-1
defeat.
Yesterday Stanford lost its
momentum in the second half
again, but held on for the tie,
pushing its season record to 11-
2-1. The Tigers return to
Colorado Springs with a 10-1-2
mark, but just 2-1-2 on the road.

"They are a great team and
great teams fina a way to score.
It happens," said Stanford coach
Berhane Andeberhan. "But I am
so full of pride. We really hung
in there with a lot of courage.
"This says we are right
there," Andeberhan continued.
"Colorado College will definitely
go (to the NCAA tournament).'

The tie does not severely af
fect Stanford's position for the
12-team NCAA tournament.
The next three games —
William and Mary and then a
two-game trip to No. 6 Duke
and No. 8 North Carolina State
— will decide Stanford's playoff
fate. Stanford concludes its reg
ular season Oct. 27 against USF
at Maloney.
Foudy scored her team
leading 11th goal of the season
36 minutes into the game. After
faking out a fullback on the
right end-line, she scored over
goalie Kris Zeits with a twisting
shot off the outside of her foot.
But in the second half and
overtime, Stanford's only of
fense was on counteipunches as
forwards Sarah Rafanelli and
Elizabeth Joneschild carried
much of the load by themselves.
Wafford, a junior forward,
scored her 13th goal of the
season for Colorado College
after a trip in the penalty box
rave the Tigers a cnarity shot.
Before the penalty, Stanford
goalie Elise Edwards had
luiocked the ball away from the
goal after she lost a crossing
shot in the sun. In the ensuing
scramble, Stanford was assessed
a foul and Wafford eased the
penalty kick untouched to Ed
ward's left into the net.
The Tigers almost scored a
second goal on a cross to the
left side, but Edwards made a
one-handed save diving to the
left, pinning the flip-shot to the

ground.
Andeberhan was pleased with
his team's defensive effort
against the Tigers, a team that
has only lost to Wisconsin and
tied North Carolina State.
Colorado College defeated
William and Mary 2-1.
"This is the best team defense
we've played," he said. "We
didn't give them any chances
because of lack of concentration

or composure. They earned
every chance they got."
Stanford should have a better
chance today against William
and Mary. The Tribe entered
yesterday's game against Santa
Barbara riding a four-game win
streak in which they had out
scored opponents 20-0, but they
were throttled by the powerful
Gauchos, who scored three
times in the first 15 minutes.

Stanford lost to No. 5 Santa Bar
bara 1-0 on the road, the only
game all season Stanford has
been shut out.
A win against William and
Mary would be an impressive
entry in Stanford's application
for the NCAA tournament. The
Tribe has made six consecutive
playoff appearances and was 14-
4-2 last year.
"We'll hold our own and have

a chance to win," said Andeber
han. "They are a good team.
Their team is very similar to
George Mason, but more
talented."
William and Mary, which lost
to Santa Clara 2-0 earlier this
year, is led by junior forward
Peggy Melanson (seven goals,
five assists) and senior forward
Jennifer Tepper (six goals, eight
assists).


Tracy Allen — Daily
Sophomore fullback Lenl Nonoshita clears the ball away from a Colorado College attacker in yesterday's game. After tying the fifth-ranked
Tigers 1-1, the No. 9 Cardinal meets seventh-ranked William and Mary this afternoon in an opportunity to improve their seeding for
the upcoming NCAA tournament.
