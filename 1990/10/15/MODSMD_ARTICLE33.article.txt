# Men's soccer tops Portland and USIU over weekend
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
It was quite a weekend for
the Stanford men's soccer squad.
It squeeked out a 2-1 victory
over nationally-ranked Univer
sity of Portland Saturday and
blew out U.S. International Uni
versity 8-0 yesterday.
Saturday's upset victory over
the Pilots was a real boost to
the team's confidence. "It was
a turning point for us," said Car
dinal fullback Randy Mann. "It
proves that we can not only stay
with good teams, but we can
beat tnem."
Stanford asst. coach Greg
Peterson agreed. "Stanford is a
real good team," he said. "The
kids proved their worth with a
real good match."
Jim Talluto, the Cardinal's
leading scorer, let everyone
know that he was worth more
than pocket change. He scored
both goals, including the one in
overtime that put Stanford in
the lead for good. The first came
at the 30:51 mark when Talluto
hit a high ball over the out
stetched Portland keeper, Kasey
Keller.
At the 54:48 minute mark,
the Pilots struck back. Fullback
Sam Singer hit a pass to forward
Joe Loenetti who shot it past
Stanford's keeper, Kyle Krpata.
Although neither team could
break the deadlock in the ex
tremely aggressive second peri
od, the Cardinal did manage to
catch a break. Portland's for
ward Yari Allnut picked up his
second yellow card of the day
and was-ejected from the match.
It was the fifth of six yellow
cards issued during the game as
each team received three.

"It was a physical match, but
Portland has been taught to play
the game properly," said Peter
son. "That one player had prob
lems, but the referee dealt with
him correctly."
Bv "correcly", Peterson meant
sending him to the bench, which
is exactly where the Cardinal
wanted him. His ejection gave
Stanford a one-man advantage.

In the first overtime period,
the Cardinal got a throw-in. As
usual, fullback Brandon Farley
launched the ball towards the
net. It brushed off midfielder
Niels Bruckner to the feet of
Talluto who put it in the net
for his ninth goal of the season.
Unlike Saturday's close duel,
Sunday's match against USIU
proved to be no contest. USIU
looked as if they had had several
players ejected and were playing
with a two or three defenders
and a keeper.
Stanford began the route in
the first period with forward
Jason Vanacour picking up a
cross from the wing that he
dropped over the head of the
goalkeeper. Bill "the Kidd" Bol
lengier also scored for the Car
dinal when he gathered a tipped
ball in front of the goal and hit
a hard blow into the net.
Scoring his first goal of the
season, Farley capitalized on a
corner kick. Talluto shot the ball
over the middle and no one
touched it until it met Farley's
head on the far side of the post.
"The coach said to keep working

on the heading and it payed off,"
explained Farley. "Maybe next
time I'll get one in a big game."
Stanford's midfielder Peter
Jeans rounded out the first pe
riod by scoring his second goal
of the season. Mann hit a long
pass to forward Lance Killian,
who shot wide to the right. With
the keeper out of position, Jeans
picked up the free ball and shot
into the empty net.
The second period proved to
be equally productive for the
Cardinal, especially for
midfielder Bruckner. The soph
more scored two goals off of two
beautiful passes — one from
Mann and the other from senior
midfielder John Howlett.
As Bruckner headed down the
sideline, Mann hit a long pass
that glided over the head of
USIU defender Luay Ahmed.
Bruckner, standing at the top
of the 18-vard line, headed the
ball over tne middle. It was shot
right back to him, and he lofted
it over the keeper's head.
Bruckner's second goal was an
act of unselfishness. Howlett
gathered a loose ball infront of
the goal and could have taken
a shot himself, but he dumped
it off to Bruckner who found an
open net.
However, Howlett was just re
turning the favor. A few minutes
before, Bruckner had given
Howlett a pass near the goal.
Stanford's final goal came just
minutes before the end of the
match. Howlett had been tripped
inside the 18 and Jason Keyes
shot the penalty kick into the
lower righthand corner.
"You don't want to run the
score up," said coach Colin Lin
dores. "But it's darn difficult to
tell the guys not to score."

leading scorer, let everyone
know that he was worth more
than pocket change. He scored
both goals, including the one in
overtime that put Stanford in
the lead for good. The first came
at the 30:51 mark when Talluto
hit a high ball over the out
stetched Portland keeper, Kasey
Keller.
At the 54:48 minute mark,
the Pilots struck back. Fullback
Sam Singer hit a pass to forward
Joe Loenetti who shot it past
Stanford's keeper, Kyle Krpata.
Although neither team could
break the deadlock in the ex
tremely aggressive second peri
od, the Cardinal did manage to
catch a break. Portland's for
ward Yari Allnut picked up his
second yellow card of the day
and was-ejected from the match.
It was the fifth of six yellow
cards issued during the game as
each team received three.

"It was a physical match, but
Portland has been taught to play
the game properly," said Peter
son. "That one player had prob
lems, but the referee dealt with
him correctly."
Bv "correcly", Peterson meant
sending him to the bench, which
is exactly where the Cardinal
wanted him. His ejection gave
Stanford a one-man advantage.

In the first overtime period,
the Cardinal got a throw-in. As
usual, fullback Brandon Farley
launched the ball towards the
net. It brushed off midfielder
Niels Bruckner to the feet of
Talluto who put it in the net
for his ninth goal of the season.
Unlike Saturday's close duel,
Sunday's match against USIU
proved to be no contest. USIU
looked as if they had had several
players ejected and were playing
with a two or three defenders
and a keeper.
Stanford began the route in
the first period with forward
Jason Vanacour picking up a
cross from the wing that he
dropped over the head of the
goalkeeper. Bill "the Kidd" Bol
lengier also scored for the Car
dinal when he gathered a tipped
ball in front of the goal and hit
a hard blow into the net.
Scoring his first goal of the
season, Farley capitalized on a
corner kick. Talluto shot the ball
over the middle and no one
touched it until it met Farley's
head on the far side of the post.
"The coach said to keep working

on the heading and it payed off,"
explained Farley. "Maybe next
time I'll get one in a big game."
Stanford's midfielder Peter
Jeans rounded out the first pe
riod by scoring his second goal
of the season. Mann hit a long
pass to forward Lance Killian,
who shot wide to the right. With
the keeper out of position, Jeans
picked up the free ball and shot
into the empty net.
The second period proved to
be equally productive for the
Cardinal, especially for
midfielder Bruckner. The soph
more scored two goals off of two
beautiful passes — one from
Mann and the other from senior
midfielder John Howlett.
As Bruckner headed down the
sideline, Mann hit a long pass
that glided over the head of
USIU defender Luay Ahmed.
Bruckner, standing at the top
of the 18-vard line, headed the
ball over tne middle. It was shot
right back to him, and he lofted
it over the keeper's head.
Bruckner's second goal was an
act of unselfishness. Howlett
gathered a loose ball infront of
the goal and could have taken
a shot himself, but he dumped
it off to Bruckner who found an
open net.
However, Howlett was just re
turning the favor. A few minutes
before, Bruckner had given
Howlett a pass near the goal.
Stanford's final goal came just
minutes before the end of the
match. Howlett had been tripped
inside the 18 and Jason Keyes
shot the penalty kick into the
lower righthand corner.
"You don't want to run the
score up," said coach Colin Lin
dores. "But it's darn difficult to
tell the guys not to score."
