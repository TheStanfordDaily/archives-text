# Third-ranked golf heads for Seattle
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth 
The Cardinal women's golf team
is ready to settle the score in
Seattle this week at the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational. They've
played in the tournament for the
last five years but have yet to win
it.
"We've come close before, but
now its our turn," said Stephanie
Davis. This would be an especially
big win for Davis and teammate
Audrey Wooding, who are both
natives of the Seattle area. "It is
always fun to go home," Davis
said.
Going home may be fun, but
playing in Seattle often includes
rainy, cold weather, and this week
is no exception. "We're going into
rough stuff, and this is one of the
toughest courses in the West,"
coach Tim Baldwin said.
The competition will be tough
too, with No. 4-ranked USC, Brig
ham Young, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Washington and nine other teams,
all aiming to pull a win out of
the drizzling Seattle rain.
"Despite the weather the team
feels good and strong about them
selves," said Baldwin. And they
have reason to feel good. With a
preseason No. 3 ranking and four
out of five returning starters, the
Cardinal is a definite force to con
tend with out on the greens.

Senior Jodi Figley and juniors
Adele Moore, Wooding and Davis
have years of experience under
their belts.
The Cardinal finished third in
its last tournament in Albuquer
que, N.M., where Wooding shot
an impressive one-under-par 72
in the last round. Stanford did
that despite having only four gol
fers competing there.
Davis was the runner-up in last
year's U.S. Amateur Tournament.
Moore will play No. 1 in Seattle,
although Baldwin said he switches
these top four around because,
"all four are very, very, good
players."
Rounding out the Seattle squad
will be freshman Melinda Daniels,
from the Sacramento Valley area.
Although she played on her high
school's men's team, this will be
her first big tournament.
"Melinda is a superb athlete,
new to the game of golf, and we
anticipate improvement through
out this season and the next four
years," said Baldwin.
Martha Richards, another
strong player, will begin compet
ing with the team in April, after
her basketball season is over.
Despite being without Richards,
Wooding is optimistic about her
homecoming. "Realistically we
can win this tournament, she said.
"We're familiar with the course."
