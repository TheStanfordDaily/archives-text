Dressed in military uniforms,
members of the Stanford Central
American Action Network
deposited 13 "corpses" in front of
the Central Intelligence Agency
booth at the Stanford Career
Faire Friday.
The "corpses" were their fellow
SCAAN members disguised to
look like mutilated bodies, and the
action was a guerrilla theater
protest against CIA recruiting on
campus.
The protesters lay motionless
in the intense midday heat for 45
minutes. Those dressed in army
fatigues pretended to work for the
CIA, while others played family
members of the "deceased."
The demonstration was similar
to one the network organized at
last year's Career Faire. According
to fifth-year senior Steve Levitsky,
a SCAAN member, the group will
protest whenever the CLA is on
campus.
The purpose of the demonstra
tion was to show what the CIA
is doing to innocent people in
Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador,
Levitsky said. He added the CIA
has furnished the governments of
El Salvador and Guatemala with
lists of "subversives," who have
subsequently been killed by
government-supported death
squads.
During the fair, SCAAN mem
bers handed out leaflets of "al

ternative information" about the
CIA. Some members satirically
claimed the leaflets showed how
American tax dollars were being
used to support a kinder and
gentler nation.
Despite the chants of, "CIA,
CIA, how many children have you
killed today?" the CIA recruiters
conducted business as usual.
However, most of the recruiters
from other companies were on
their lunch break and took the
time to watch the demonstration.
According to David Porter, a
CIA recruiter, Stanford is the
West Coast university from which
the agency hires the most people.
Of the 150 booths, the ClA's was
one of the busiest at the fair. Even
during the protest, Stanford stu
dents waited patiently in line to
speak with a recruiter.
One student who was trying to
maneuver her way through the
demonstrators echoed the feelings
of others when she said, "They're
in my way and I want to go talk
to the CIA."
Many student bystanders said
they supported what the protest
ers were doing and felt it was
necessary. Emily Waff, a coter
minal student in English, said, "I
think this is a very helpful and
informative demonstration be
cause it educates people."
However, many students said
they considered the protest yet
another impediment on their way
to classes through White Plaza.
