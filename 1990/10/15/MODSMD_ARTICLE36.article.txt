# Trustee donates stock in publishing company

Robert and Anne Bass have
donated to the University a sub
stantial amount, of stock in the
Times Publishing Company.
But Stanford does not know the
exact cash amount and will not
be able to use the money for
months.
A graduate of the School of
Business, Robert Bass has served
on its advisory council since 1986
and was elected to the Universi
ty's Board of Trustees in April
1989. He is president of the
Robert M. Bass Group, Inc. in
Fort Worth, Texas.
Anne Bass graduated from and
is a trustee of Smith College in
Northampton, Mass.
Others contributed to the gift
but wish to remain anonymous.
The Bass family has donated
money to the University in the
past for such projects as the Bass
Center, which houses students in
the Stanford-in-Washington pro
gram.
Although the University now
legally owns the stock, it cannot
be sold until its value is appraised
for the Bass' tax purposes. This
process is complicated because the
stock has not been available for
public trading.
Stanford probably will not see
the money in cash form for
months, according to Donald
Meyer, director of planned giving
for the Office of Development.

'These funds will
help faculty to fur
ther their research
agendas.'

Because the University will not
know how much the stock will
bring on the market until it is
sold, the funds cannot be alloca
ted. "There is no time schedule
or set values for this gift," Meyer
said.
However, a portion of the funds
will go to the dean's fund at the
Business School to support faculty
research and to aid in hiring new
faculty members and retaining
current faculty.
"These funds will enable faculty
to further their research agendas,
which ultimately improve the
quality of management educa
tion," said Business School Dean
Michael Spence.
When the time comes to decide
how the rest of the funds will be
used, the Bass family will have a
say, Meyer said. It is "the Uni
versity's policy to honor the
donor."
But since there is no formal
agreement between the two par
ties, the University can allocate
the money where it is needed
most.
