# Students show little interest in new 'Z' parking permits
## 
### Sarah Truitt 
Since the introduction of $5 "Z permits"
at the beginning of the year, the Trans
portation Programs Department has en
countered almost no student interest in
buying the new permits.
According to department representative
Leina Johanssonn, the one-year experimen
tal plan offers 200 low-cost parking spaces
for resident students and commuters in
three new lots on the periphery of campus.
While very few resident students have
bought the new permits, the commuter
permits are almost sold out. Half of the
permits are reserved for residents.
The department is now allowing students
who have already bought the more expen
sive A or C permits, which allow parking
closer to the center of campus, to return
the permits for a full refund in exchange
for buying a Z permit.

The Z permit is a significantly cheaper
than the $200-per-year A permit and the
$50-per-year C permit.
The three Z lots are located on the corner
of Campus Drive and Serra Street, on Gal
vez Street near the Track House and at
Campus Drive West and Stockfarm Road.
Although the Z lots are not as centrally
located as the A and C areas, they provide
a discount for people who need their cars
only occasionally. The A and C spaces near
the center of campus will be available for
those who use their cars more frequently
during the day, Johanssonn said.
"It is a new procedure," she added. "We
want input from different people on how
we can improve the project."
Later in the year, the department plans
to take a student opinion poll about the Z
permit.
The permits are available at the Stanford
Police Station on Serra Street.
