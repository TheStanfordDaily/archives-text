# One wing down, one to go
## Business School quake repair now halfway there 
### Dylan Tyson Staff writer 
It took one summer to reinforce the
north wing of the Graduate School of
Business after the Oct. 17 earthquake,
and it will take another to repair the
south wing.
But the reconstruction project should
ensure that when the next big quake
hits, the building will be usable within
a week.
During the summer, R.C. Benson and
Sons, a contracting firm, worked to
repair the north wing of the earthquake
damaged Business School at a cost of
$5.2 million. The south wing will be
finished next summer for an additional
$1.8 million. When completed, the build
ing will conform to a higher life-safety
standard.
"The minimum goal [for Stanford
buildings] is life safety," said Fouad Ben
dimerad, a Stanford engineer and
member of the subcommittee on design
criteria.
Important campus buildings are built

to even more rigorous standards, Ben
dimerad said. Known as damage-control
buildings, ideally these would be usable
within one week of a quake.
It is harder to reinforce existing build
ings than to build new, structurally
sound buildings, Bendimerad said.
However, he said the completed Business
School will be considered a damage
control building, the highest level of Hfe
safety.
Contractors used 75 truckloads of con
crete and 65 tons of steel to add or
reinforce 1,000 linear feet of walls. The
new walls run from the basement to the
top floor to help absorb shock from fu
ture earthquakes. The walls were not
connected vertically before the repairs.
Although the building is relatively new,
it was damaged because it was con
structed under the lenient seismic stand
ards used in 1966. Older buildings such
as Roble Hall and Lou Henry Hoover
House were reinforced prior to the earth
quake, but engineers were not as con
cerned about the Business School.
Immediately after last year's quake,
the Business School was thought to be
severely damaged. However, the damage
turned out to be more visual than struc
tural. Classes resumed in some parts of
the building only five days alter the
quake.
Paul Johnson, associate dean of the
Business School for administration, em
phasized the building was safe prior to
reinforcement.

"Without this work, the building was
safe — it wouldn't have come down in
another quake," he said. "But we decided
to do the work now to avoid the proba
bility that portions of the building would
have to be shut down for months again
after another m£yor quake while we did
extensive repairs."
The Business School is also increasing
its efforts to promote earthquake aware
ness.
"There were no serious injuries last
time," said Johnson, "and we want to
be sure we do everything we can to
protect people and facilities in future
quakes."
