# One wing down, one to go
## Business School quake repair now halfway there 
### Dylan Tyson Staff writer 
It took one summer to reinforce the
north wing of the Graduate School of
Business after the Oct. 17 earthquake,
and it will take another to repair the
south wing.
But the reconstruction project should
ensure that when the next big quake
hits, the building will be usable within
a week.
During the summer, R.C. Benson and
Sons, a contracting firm, worked to
repair the north wing of the earthquake
damaged Business School at a cost of
$5.2 million. The south wing will be
finished next summer for an additional
$1.8 million. When completed, the build
ing will conform to a higher life-safety
standard.
"The minimum goal [for Stanford
buildings] is life safety," said Fouad Ben
dimerad, a Stanford engineer and
member of the subcommittee on design
criteria.
Important campus buildings are built

to even more rigorous standards, Ben
dimerad said. Known as damage-control
buildings, ideally these would be usable
within one week of a quake.
It is harder to reinforce existing build
ings than to build new, structurally
sound buildings, Bendimerad said.
However, he said the completed Business
School will be considered a damage
control building, the highest level of Hfe
safety.
Contractors used 75 truckloads of con
crete and 65 tons of steel to add or
reinforce 1,000 linear feet of walls. The
new walls run from the basement to the
top floor to help absorb shock from fu
ture earthquakes. The walls were not
connected vertically before the repairs.
Although the building is relatively new,
it was damaged because it was con
structed under the lenient seismic stand
ards used in 1966. Older buildings such
as Roble Hall and Lou Henry Hoover
House were reinforced prior to the earth
quake, but engineers were not as con
