# Awareness week will focus on responsibility, not new policy
## 
### Sarah Morisseau 
Although events during Alcohol Aware
ness Week at Stanford will range from a
sermon to non-alcoholic beer tasting, they
won't touch the topic brewing in everyone's
mind — the new alcohol policy.
Because those working on the program
want to concentrate on making educated
choices, they plan to avoid the issue of the
new policy. "We are trying to put it back
in student hands, emphasizing that you
need to make your own decisions," said
junior Kerren Hedlund, one of Stanford's
coordinators of National Collegiate Alcohol
Awareness Week.
Hedlund does expect that discussion of
the new policy will come up in one of the
debates, but "We're going to be steering
away from it," she said.
The program is sponsored by Project
R 2 ISC, Risk Reduction of Intoxicants in
the Stanford Community.
The week's events started yesterday
morning with a sermon in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium by Rev. Diana Akiyama on
"Spirituality and Recovery."
"Unbeknownst to me when I contacted
her for the program, she once was an al
cohol and drug rehab counselor," said
R 2 ISC director Louise Miller. "She wove
in stories of her work in her speech."
After the services, Rabbi Amy Eilberg of
the chaplain program at Stanford Hospital
spoke to a group of about 10 people on
her own recovery as a codependent.
"There are a lot of different aspects when
you drink alcohol. We're trying to address
each one in a different way, giving a broad
overview," Hedlund explained.
One aspect will be explored tomorrow in
"Safe Suds," a tasting of non-alcoholic
beers in White Plaza from noon to 1 p.m.
"People drink for different reasons," Hed
lund said. "One is the taste."

TUESDAY:
•"Safe Suds," a tasting of non
alcoholic beers, White Plaza, 12*1 p.m.
•"Alcohol Problems as Perceived
by Scientists, Citizens and Cultures,"

cohol Research Group, El Centro Chi

Live!", Branner, 7-9 p.m.

Support for the week has pleased the
program coordinators. "We have a lot of
support through the Greek system," Hed
lund said. "[Most houses] are pledging to
have dry parties this week."
Hedlund said she feels the main goal of
the week is "to get people to start think
ing."
"I would be happy if a good percentage
went to one event and learned just one
thing and gave some good honest thought
to it," Miller said.
