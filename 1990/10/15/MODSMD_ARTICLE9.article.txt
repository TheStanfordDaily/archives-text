D.C. Students
stage takeover
District of Columbia University was
forced to shut down all three of its
campuses when more than 100 angry
students took over two administration
buildings and forced the administra
tors to evacuate.
Students instigated the takeover
after trustees refused to meet with
them to discuss their concerns about
the institution's management.
During the takeover the students
made several demands, including the
resignation of several trustees. They
also demanded the university take fur
ther action regarding a controversy
over obscene art.
The university recently volunteered
to house the artwork of controversial
feminist artist Judy Chicago. Mem
bers of Congress became angry at the
idea of the university's housing what
they consider obscene artwork, and
the U.S. House of Representatives has
voted to cut $1.6 million in funding
to the university.
Students are concerned about the
impact of the cut and want more ac
tion by the trustees to prevent it.
Washington Mayor Marion Barry
met with the protesters to discuss
their demands. The students are also
scheduled to meet with Miles Mark
Fisher, the university's interim pres
ident. Officials are unsure when
classes will resume.

Two papers
called anti-Semitic
Two student-run newspapers have
been denounced for publishing articles
that officials said contained "appall
ing" and "blatant" anti-Semitism.
"The Dartmouth Review" and the
City University of New York's City
College's "The Campus" have been ac
cused of bigotry, resulting in staff up
heavals and resignations.
The Review published a passage
from Hitler's Mein Kampf in the space
under its masthead usually reserved
for the paper's credo. The passage
read: "I believe today that I am acting
in the sense of the Almighty Creator:
By warding off the Jews, I am fighting
for the Lord's work." This issue was
published on Yom Kippur, the most
important of the Jewish holidays.
Editors at the Review claim to have
had no knowledge of how the passage

got into the paper, and have issued
three separate apologies to the
campus. Immediately following the in
cident, the Review's president and
three reporters resigned.
The Campus also published an anti-
Semitic opinion late last month. The
author, Vivek Golikeri, a former grad
uate student, wrote that a "cunning
Jewish clique" of "powerful, arrogant
people" had been "manipulating the
sympathy" that people feel about the
Holocaust.
Bernard Harleston, the university's
president, denounced the article and
urged the paper's editors to reject fu
ture submissions that expressed such
bigoted opinions.

Duke adds
assault amendment
A rape and sexual assault amend
ment has been added to Duke Uni
versity's Judicial Code and awaits
final approval by the administration.
In the past, those accused of rape
or sexual assault have been tried un
der the assault and battery portion
of the Judicial Code. Now, violators
will be tried under the new amend
ment.
The proposed amendment defines
sexual assault as "rape, forcible
sodomy, forcible sexual penetration,
however slight . . . the touching of an
unwilling person's intimate parts . ..
or forcing an unwilling person to
touch another's intimate parts."
A committee is being assembled to
study the legality of the amendment
and possible complications surround
ing its implementation.

Students warned about
religious groups
Amherst College is preparing a
mailing to the student body warning
students about aggressive religious
groups. The mailing is prompted by
the activities of the Springfield
Church of Christ, whose members
have harassed students from Smith
College and the University of Massa
chusetts at Amherst.
In addition, campus ministries at
Massachusetts have provided a
pamphlet titled "Protect Yourself
from Destructive Religious Groups."
While the pamphlet doesn't specifi
cally identify the Springfield group, it

does advice students to beware of sit
uations where they feel coerced, in
sulted or pressured.

UCLA disputes
civil rights charges
UCLA will appeal a federal agency's
finding that the university has vio
lated the civil rights of five Asian-
American graduate candidates by
denying them admission.
University officials have refuted the
findings of the U.S. Department of
Education's Office of Civil Rights, but
would not comment further because
of the pending appeal.
However, Asian community leaders
at UCLA are unsatisfied with the ef
fort the university has made so far.
Glenn Omatsu, associate editor of the
Amerasia Journal, said that the uni
versity is spending too much time dis
puting the findings and not enough
time seeking improvements and rem
edies.
Omatsu said he was not surprised
by the agency's findings, and that
UCLA has a history of discriminating
against Asian-American students. He
cites the lack of Asian-Americans in
the top levels of the university, in
cluding the graduate schools, admin
istration, faculty and admissions.
University officials say that if their
appeal fails, they will take the matter
to court. If UCLA is found guilty, they
could be forced to admit the five
Asian-Americans and may lose federal
funding.

Northwestern sets
up GALA hotline
Tha Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Northwestern University is striving
to publicize its GALA hotline, de
signed to help anyone who has ques
tions concerning homosexuality.
The service provides one-on-one
contact for students who are too in
hibited to use other avenues of
obtaining information about homo
sexuality. Operators are prepared to
answer questions not only from gay
and lesbian students, but also from
the university's heterosexual popula
tion, who may have questions about
friends or relatives who are gay.
