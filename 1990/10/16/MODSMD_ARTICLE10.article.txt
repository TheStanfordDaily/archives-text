# Repair procedure rattles Escondido residents
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
On a typical day, Glenn Carroll, manager of
apartment facilities at Escondido Village, and
his staff of seven receive about 40 requests for
maintenance work on campus. But as stu
dents return in the fall, the number of com
plaints can climb as high as 1,000 to 1,200 per
day.
With such a large number of complaints, it
is not unusual that there is some backlog in
the system that causes delays in repairs.
This year, however, the wait may be longer
for some students due to a restructuring of the
University maintenance system that was
undertaken as part of University-wide budget
cuts.
While the changes affect all of campus
housing facilities, the problem seems most
acute at Escondido, which is just now adopting
the standard campus maintenance proce
dures.
In the past, Escondido residents were only

required to call the maintenance office and
report problems to the supervisor there. Now,
though, students must fill out a "fix-it" form
like those used by other residences for all non
urgent problems.
Some students call the new system more
troublesome than beneficial. One Escondido
high-rise resident said the forms are not avail
able in her building and that the walk to the
central office is inconvenient.
When she complained to the office last
week, she was told that boxes with the fix-it
forms were going to be installed shortly, but
they are still not in place.
Carroll acknowledged that it has taken a
while to install all the boxes, but emphasized
that they will be available soon.
Residents of the Row have had problems as
well, but to a lesser degree than those in
Escondido Village. Kenny Zeitung, vice presi
dent of Theta Xi fraternity, said that a missing
mirror in one of his house's bathrooms has
not been replaced.
In general, however, response to mainte

nance problems seems to be running fairly
smoothly. Lynn Glick, associate manager of
housing operations, said she had not received
an unusual number of complaints this year.
She said the number of repair requests
actually seems lower than in the past, perhaps
due to earthquake restoration.
During the year, a fix-it form filled out by
students is sent to the maintenance supervi
sor of each residence. The supervisor must
examine the damage before repairs can be
done so that the right kind of maintenance
technician is sent to do the job.
Some repairs, such as overflowing toilets or
missing locks on doors, receive high priority
and are fixed immediately. But other prob
lems, such as missing towel bars in student
rooms, are not considered imperative and are
frequently placed behind jobs.
Glick acknowledged this procedure may
take several days, and even as long as a month
if parts need to be ordered. At present, she
said, there is less than a two-week backlog for
fixing problems on the row.
