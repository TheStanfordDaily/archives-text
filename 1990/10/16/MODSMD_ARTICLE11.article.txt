## 
### Dylan Tyson Staff writer 
A Stanford student was
assaulted outside Stern Hall late
Saturday night while walking
home from Sigma Nu's Islander
party, according to police.
Although the woman's name
was not revealed, Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington did give
details of the assault.
The student was apparently
returning home from Governor's
Corner with a group of acquain
tances when she saw a man she

had met at the party and left the
group.
The two continued walking
toward her dorm in Stern Hall,
when the man shoved her into the
bushes near Serra for an unex
plained reason. She pushed him
back and started to scream,
prompting someone who heard
her to call the police. The man
struck her in the face and ran off
before people nearby could come
to her aid.
The police found the woman in
a building near the Campus Bike
Shop, where a group of students

were comforting her.
She was taken to the hospital
and treated for a bloody nose and
swollen lip.
"We don't know what this was
about," Herrington said. "The
motive was probably sexual
assault." However, Herrington
said the case was being classified
by the police as assault and bat
tery.
The white male suspect is
thought to be between 19 and 21.
He was reported to be thin, 5 feet
9 inches tall and 150 pounds. He

has short blond-to-brown hair cut
above the collar.
The suspect was wearing stone
washed jeans and a dark crew
neck pullover sweatshirt with long
sleeves.
Herrington said police assume
the assailant is a Stanford stu
dent. He said police have no leads,
but the investigation is not over.
"We are talking to [the victim]
more to see if she can remember
any details," Herrington explain
ed. He said he hopes for more
clues to guide the search.
