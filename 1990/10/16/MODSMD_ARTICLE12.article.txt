Hrawi unifies war-torn Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — President Elias
Hrawi started dismantling Beirut's dividing
Green Line yesterday to unify what he hopes
will be a militia-free capital after the defeat of
rebel Gen. Michel Aoun.
Government bulldozers removed mounds of
earth, rocks and other obstacles from the
Galerie Semaan crossing, on the highway link
ing Moslem south Beirut with the Christian
suburbs of Hazmiyeh and Baabda.
Motorists then drove across the intersec
tion, waving their hands to helmeted Lebanese
soldiers and honking their horns in jubilation.
Syrian and Lebanese troops crushed Aoun's
11-month mutiny in an eight-hour assault Sat
urday that killed 160 and wounded 800.
Students strike to free Ukraine
MOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of students
went on strike yesterday in Kiev, the capital of
the Ukraine, to support hunger strikers'
demands for independence, Soviet media
reported.
As many as 50,000 students blocked central
streets and marched to the Ukrainian parlia
ment building, where some held a sit-in
protest, the independent news agencies Inter
fax and Postfactum said.
The Ukraine is one of 13 Soviet republics
seeking greater autonomy from the central
government in Moscow. Although its parlia
ment has declared sovereignty — defined as
the right to overrule national laws — the stu
dents contend the republic should move more
quickly and decisively toward secession.
U.S. diet still too fatty
DENVER (AP) — Americans may be get
ting closer to the ideal diet, but they still eat
too much fat, cholesterol and sodium, accord
ing to a federal report discussed in Denver yes
terday.
The Department of Agriculture report on
the nation's eating habits — which includes
the USDA's revised dietary guidelines — was
the focus of the 73rd annual American Dietetic
Association meeting. Participants discussed a
draft of the report, which is scheduled for
release in its final form Nov. 5.
As in the past, the USDA will appeal to
Americans to consume less saturated fat,
sodium and cholesterol, try a variety of foods
that include plenty of vegetables, fruits and
grain products, and maintain a healthy weight.
Spread of AIDS increases TB cases
GENEVA (AP) — Tuberculosis-related
deaths should increase sharply because of the
"parallel epidemic" of AIDS, the World Health
Organization warned yesterday.
A survey by the Geneva-based group esti
mated that almost half of the 6 million to 8
million people believed infected with the virus
that causes AIDS also have TB, which claims
about 3 million lives annually and is the No. 1
killer among contagious diseases.
Data collected by WHO suggest those with
both TB and the HIV virus develop acquired
immune deficiency syndrome "dramatically"
faster.
