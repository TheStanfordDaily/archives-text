OSLO, Norway (AP) â€” Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev won the 1990 Nobel
Peace Prize yesterday for easing interna
tional tensions, but claimed it as an en
dorsement of wrenching changes he has
made at home.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said
the 59-year-old Soviet leader displayed a
"leading role in the peace process which
today characterizes important parts of the
international community."
"Words fail one at such moments. I am
moved," Gorbachev said in a television in
terview.
"I perceive this action of the most au
thoritative organization of the global com
munity first of all not in personal terms,
but as recognition of the significance of
the immense cause of perestroika for the
destiny of the entire world."
Gorbachev has been criticized at home
because some of his social and economic
reforms, called perestroika, have led to
bloody ethnic and food rioting, and de
mands by most Soviet republics for inde
pendence.
"We know that there are great problems
(in the Soviet Union), but that is not what
he got his prize for," said Gidske Anderson,
leader of the five-person Nobel Committee.
"The big thing that is happening in the
world is the reconciliation of the super
powers.
"If you will read the text you will see
we are talking mainly about international
policy," she said.
The committee's citation said the
"greater openness (Gorbachev) has brought

about in Soviet society has also helped
promote international trust."
The committee said Gorbachev had made
many contributions to the "dramatic
changes" in East-West relationships since
he came to power in 1985:
"Confrontation has been replaced by ne
gotiations. Old European nation states
have regained freedom. The arms race is
slowing down and we see a definite and
active process in the direction of arms con
trol and disarmament."
Gorbachev told a Norwegian TV inter
viewer his reforms were popular outside
the Soviet Union because "the world was
ripe for change.
"It had grown tired of the Cold War, the
arms race, the hardships resulting from
an overload of current problems facing the
world community," he said.
In the past five years, the Soviet Union
has agreed to reduce nuclear and conven
tional armed forces, helped settle regional
conflicts in Africa, Asia and Latin America,
and withdrawn its forces from Afghanistan.
Many world leaders praised the award,
but several said they hoped it would lead
to even more freedom in the Soviet Union.
"If this prize contributes to the peaceful
and quiet transition of the Soviet Union
to a society of equal nations and citizens,
we welcome it warmly," said Vaclav Havel,
a former dissident who became Czechoslo
vakia's president after the Soviet Union
eased its grip on the East bloc.
President Bush called Gorbachev "a cou
rageous force for peaceful change in the
world."


Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, shown during a session of the
Supreme Soviet, was named winner of the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize
yesterday for his decisive role In helping to end the Cold War.
