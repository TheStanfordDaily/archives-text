# Democrats plan to up taxes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Democratic
deficit-reduction plan under attack from
the Bush administration would raise taxes
on all but the poorest Americans, socking
the richest 1 percent with increases averag
ing nearly $14,000 a year.
The proposal would cut taxes slightly on
those with incomes under $20,000 a year,
according to an analysis yesterday by the
staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.
Those above the $200,000 income level
would face a 7.4 percent tax increase.
For people between those extremes, the
legislation would result in tax increases in
the 1 percent range. That would result
from putting higher consumer taxes on
alcohol and tobacco; giving up next year's
income tax adjustment to offset inflation,
and raising the amount of wages subject
to the Medicare tax.
Economists for the House Ways and
Means Committee, which wrote the pro
posal, estimated its tax changes and cost
increases for Medicare beneficiaries would
cost the average family $352 next year.
Analysts said:
•The poorest one-fifth of families, with
after-tax income averaging $7,316, would
get a $14 tax cut.
•The second-poorest one-fifth, averaging
$16,917, would pay $114 more.

*The middle group, averaging $25,896,
would pay $183 more.
*The second-richest 20 percent, averag
ing $36,481, would face a $280 tax increase.
•The top 20 percent, whose incomes
average $81,934, would pay $1,173 more.
•Those with incomes averaging over
$428,000 — the richest 1 percent — would
face a $13,951 tax increase.
Although other deficit plans are being
considered, the House Democratic version
is getting most of the attention now because
of the administration's opposition and be
cause it seems to have support from most
of the party's House members.
President Bush, after meeting with the
congressional Republican leaders, Sen. Bob
Dole of Kansas and Rep. Bob Michel of
Illinois, said yesterday that they were
"pretty much on the same wavelength" in
preferring a different tax increase approved
by the Senate Finance Committee. "What
I'll do is say the action's in the Congress
and I will take a look at what comes out,"
Bush told reporters on a campaign trip to
Texas.
Unlike the House Democrats' plan, the
Finance Committee version would avoid
changes in income tax rates but would
limit itemized deductions for people earn
ing over $100,000.
