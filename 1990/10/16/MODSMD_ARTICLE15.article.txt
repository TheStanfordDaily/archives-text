# Israeli leader accuses world of hypocrisy

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir yester
day accused the world of
hypocrisy, ignoring murders of
Israelis while condemning Israel
for killing 19 Palestinians in
Jerusalem last week.
In a strongly worded warning
to Iraq, Shamir also said any
intervention in neighboring Jor
dan that upset that country's sta
bility would bring swift Israeli
retaliation.
Addressing Parliament, Shamir
defended his Cabinet's rejection

Sunday of a U.N. Security Council
resolution urging a U.N. investiga
tion of the deaths on the Temple
Mount a week ago.
The Cabinet action was criti
cized yesterday by left-wing par
ties, and the largest opposition
faction, the center-left Labor
Party, said it would join a no-con
fidence vote against Shamir's con
servative government.
Shamir, reacting to the Secu
rity Council condemnation, said
critics ignored the fact that police
charged the Mount only after

Palestinians unleashed a barrage
of stones at Jewish worshipers at
the adjacent Western Wall.
"The citizens of Israel and all
Jews everywhere cannot but be
astonished and protest at the
voices of criticism ... in which
what stood out was an absence of
any mention of the grave attack
on the Jewish people's holiest
place," he said.
Shamir complained that the
Security Council failed to respond
in any way to the murders of 16
Israeli tourists in two attacks in

Egypt, one in 1985 by a deranged
Egyptian policeman and another
last February by unidentified gun
men.
Shamir did not follow other
Israeli politicians in directly criti
cizing the United States, Israel's
chief ally, for joining in the unani
mous Security Council vote.
But he suggested that backing
for the resolution was motivated
by the need to hold together the
U.S.-backed force against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's
takeover of Kuwait.
