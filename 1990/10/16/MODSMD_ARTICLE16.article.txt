# Senate cuts SDI spending in bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate approved a
defense spending bill yesterday that leaves intact
President Bush's 1991 budget request for the B-2
stealth bomber but trims spending on the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
By a vote of 79-16, the Senate adopted the $268
billion package for the fiscal year which began Oct. 1
after turning aside a serious challenge to Bush's B-2
program.
The legislation meets the levels set by Congress in
the recently approved budget resolution and largely
conforms to the military authorization bill setting
spending ceilings adopted by the Senate in August.
Negotiators for the House and Senate will meet
this week to hammer out a final version of the
spending blueprint. The House-approved legislation
slashes more than $2 billion from the SDI budget
and stops production of the B-2 bomber at 15 planes,
putting bargainers at sharp odds.
The Senate bill would reduce U.S. troop levels by
100,000, including 50,000 in Europe; would cut
about $1 billion from Bush's request of $4.7 billion
for the Strategic Defense Initiative and would
approve the administration's call for purchase of
two B-2 bombers in fiscal 1991.
By a vote of 50-44, the Senate defeated a measure
that would have eliminated about $2.7 billion that
Bush requested in his budget to buy two new
bombers. The provision would have halted overall
construction at six planes.
The amendment touched off a fierce fight on the
Senate floor as opponents of the aircraft argued that
the 75 bombers planned, at nearly $865 million a
copy, are excessive for a nation on the brink of finan
cial disaster
"There is a threat to the nation greater than the
Soviet air defense," said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine, a mem
ber of the Armed Services Committee, said that

although the Soviet Union is still modernizing its
strategic forces, "it's also moving ahead into an
abyss."
"They can't house their soldiers. They can't feed
their people," he said.
The chair of the Armed Services panel and a B-2
proponent, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the bombers
"change the nature of warfare and change it in our
favor."
"Opponents do not understand we're talking
about revolutionary technology," said Nunn, who
pointed out that a predecessor of the B-2, the B-18,
is failing to meet some Pentagon performance stan
dards.
The sponsor of the amendment, Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., urged his colleagues to "make the
stealth truly invisible — and make it disappear right
here and now."
Though the amendment to delete the B-2 failed,
it picked up support from four senators who had
voted against it previously — Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
John Heinz, R-Pa., John McCain, R-Ariz., and
James McClure, R-Idaho.
In August, the full Senate narrowly rejected a
similar amendment when it adopted a defense
authorization bill that sets spending ceilings. 1 he
measure was defeated 56-43.
The House already has called for stopping P ro "
duction at 15 planes. Negotiators for the House and
Senate hope to agree by week's end on the B-2 ques
tion and other points of dispute in both the defense
appropriations and authorization bills.
The spending bill also includes $238 million for
the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft Bush has
sought to cancel the past two years; eliminates $1.1
billion the Pentagon sought for the MILSTAR com
munications satellite and scales back the adminis
tration's request for land-based nuclear missiles.
