# U.N.'s role debated
## 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
When the United Nations
Security Council took the
unprecedented step of estab
lishing a trade embargo
against Iraq, many analysts
__________ saw the U.N. as
News " " e J n „ for -®
emerging in
analysis world pontics.
But Charles
Hill, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution, dis
agrees. "There is no police
man role possible for the
U.N.," said Hill, who served as
deputy assistant Secretary of
State for the Middle East dur
ing the Reagan Administra
tion.
Hill represents one of two
perspectives on the U.N. in the
post-cold war world. "Force is
needed to counter force. It is
very unlikely that the United
Nations can come together
with sufficient unanimity to
use the force that is required,"
he said.
There is no nation that
matches the superpower
strength of the United States,
Hill added. "If there is going
to be a policing force, it's the
U.S. that will have to do it."
George Ball, an arms con
trol official in the Kennedy
Administration, and now a
visiting scholar at the Stan
ford Center for International
Security and Arms Control,
explained the opposite per
spective on the U.N. "If your
long term goal is serious
reduction of military forces
worldwide, you've got to have
something to fill in,"he said.

The "ultimate concept"
would be a system of "regional
organizations, plus the U.N. to
fill in," Ball said. "If you are
the United States, then
maybe you want to be police
man of the world, but the rest
of the world is not going to
like it. They would much
rather go through the U.N."
But in the short run, at
least, strong nations like the
U.S. will continue to act
according to their own self
interest, with or without the
U.N. sheriff badge of approval.
This, according to Hill, will
most likely mean war between
the United States and Iraq.
He predicted a likely sce
nario for the outbreak of war
in the Middle east. "Some
thing of an emergency would
arise," and the United States
would react with immediate
military action. The U.N.
would then debate the action
and would probably condemn
the breakout of war. Under
this scenario, Hill said the
United States would be seen
by many as having under
mined international coopera
tion.
With war inevitable, Hill
suggested that the U.N.
should prepare for its own
political damage control.
"It is very important for
the countries of the U.N. not
t0... make such a stink about
it that they undermine their
own case by saying 'What is
happening now destroys
everything,'" Hill said. He
further advised the United
Nations to take its gains and
salvage what it can for the
next crisis.
