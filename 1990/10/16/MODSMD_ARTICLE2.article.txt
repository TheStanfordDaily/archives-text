# Standing under the same umbrella
## VP says new organization aims to coordinate student services 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
In an effort to reconcile budget cuts
with attempts to improve student ser
vices, the University has created a
streamlined Office of Student Resources
to oversee several previously decentral
ized offices.
Student Resources is the new
umbrella organization for Student
Affairs, the Financial Aids Office, the

Registrar, Admissions, the Undergradu
ate Advising Center and several other
University offices.
While the heads of these departments
used to report to the President, Provost
or one of several academic deans, all of
them now report to Sally Mahoney, the
acting vice president of Student
Resources.
The position was created in last May
in response to impending budget cuts
and is "intended to consolidate a lot of

functions that reported in a variety of
places," Mahoney said.
In a memo dated last month,
Mahoney said the mission of her office is
twofold:
• "To provide support directly to stu
dents," and
• "To enable the president, the
provost and the deans' council to realize
their vision for strengthening ties
between faculty and students that
are essential to education."
While most of the units now
reporting to her are housed in Old
Union, Mahoney said, until a few
years ago "there was no regular
place that this set of people
(department heads) naturally
came to the table to talk." This
resulted in redundancy, she said,
and "people deciding things in
isolation because they were not
sharing information."
This changed five years ago
when James Rosse became
provost, according to Mahoney.
Rosse instigated biweekly meet
ings to allow heads of different
departments to confer with each
other on overlapping issues.
Yet even under this system, the
provost, president and deans
found their time taxed by all of
the different groups reporting to
them.
Mahoney said administrators
questioned whether the Univer
sity "could get more effective ser
vices to students ... if we formal
ized an organization that would
encompass all of these functions."
Earlier this year, a committee
called Action Plans for Change
was created to find ways to make
student services more coherent.
Shortly after that, Mahoney said
looming budget cuts served as

further incentive to reorganize
student services.
The repositioning has resulted
in a 15 percent reduction of the
student services budget.
While it is too soon to measure
the effects of the repositioning,
Mahoney said last week at a meet
ing of various departments in stu
dent services that "what was so
exciting to see was people talking
about how given limited
resources . . . they could continue
to give quality service."
She said department heads
"had good things to say" and were
optimistic that while forced to
respond to a reduced budget, they
might actually work more closely
together than under the old struc
ture.
What this means for students,
Mahoney said, is that "we will be
able to configure services more
coherently" and make undergrad
uate and graduate programs
"accessible . . . and supportive."
For now, the Office of Student
Resources plans to make further
organizational changes in several
departments. Mahoney said she
hopes to integrate the Financial
Aids, Graduate Awards and Bur
sar's Offices more closely to save
students time •
Mahoney added she hopes to
decentralize graduate admissions,
awards and degree programs.
The search for a new Dean of
Student Affairs and redefinition
of that position will begin later
this quarter.
