## An overdue change 
### 
A victory for many
domestic partners,
but not for faculty

Although gay and les
bian students have been
working on the issue for 14
years, Stanford just became the
first university in the nation to
guarantee equal access to student
housing, facilities and health care
to domestic partners of students.
The students affected by the de
cision will no longer "have to
choose between their domestic
commitments and their studies at
Stanford," said Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson in an
nouncing the new policy on Oct. 9.
This policy, consistent with the
University's non-discrimination
statement prohibiting discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual
orientation, is long overdue.
Heterosexual married students
are not the only long-term couples
at the University. They should not
have been the only ones treated as
such.
Now gay, lesbian and unmarried
couples can more freely participate
in community life, whether it be
living together or just using the
gyms as couples.'
The University never required
proof of marriage from married

couples seeking these benefits, and
it will not require proof of a long
term commitment from gay, les
bian and unmarried couples now.
Although this quirk opens the
possibility of undergraduate cou
ples exploiting the new policy to
be able to live together, one thing
will deter them: domestic partners'
housing is in Escondido Village,
hardly a haven on campus. The
desire to live there should be proof
enough of the seriousness of a re
lationship.
Unfortunately, a large group of
couples still face obstacles at Stan
ford — gay, lesbian and unmarried
faculty and staff couples. It is un
just that domestic partner benefits
have not been extended to them.
Hopefully, the extra money re
quired — even in this time of
budget cuts — to guarantee serv
ices to this group is not an issue.
It would be an ugly reflection
on the University's priorities if the
cost of providing life insurance and
other benefits to professors' and
staffers' partners is the reason
equal access remains denied to
them.
Nevertheless, Stanford has
taken a step in the right direction
by eliminating another discrimina
tory practice.
Hopefully other universities and
national institutions will soon fol
low suit. They are long overdue in
providing equal rights under the
law, too.
