## Back to Charlie Brown 
### 
ON MY WAY BACK FROM AN
internship in Denver at the end
of this summer, I stopped by my
grandmother's house in Northern
California. My mom had said that she
wasn't doing so well, and I better go
see her while, well, while I still could.
So I got out of the car intending on
staying for just a short while, long
enough to say hello and eat something
(can't leave my grandmother's house
without eating — house rules). But,
two hours later, I found myself still
there.
Why? It wasn't that I felt like I had
to see as much as possible of her
because there wouldn't be another
chance. The family, all of us, had
already gone through that stage about
a year ago.
My grandmother finally got so tired
of all the near-mourners (it's a big
brood) tramping around her house —
interrupting her naps and upsetting
her parakeet — that she told every
body to go away and let her live in
peace.
Though her condition had
deteriorated since then, I knew her
attitude was pretty much the same:
come see me if you want to say hi, but
don't be wearing black if you do.
No, it was something which came up
after about five minutes of talking to
her. She said to me, "Charlie Brown,
go get yourself a soda. You look like
you're steaming at the ears."
She was right about the steaming;
her house has a swamp-cooler that
only manages to drip water, so the
place is always like a sauna.

I was halfway to the fridge before I
realized that she'd called me Charlie
Brown. I hadn't heard that since I was
14 years old. It was the nickname she
gave me because of the fact that, well,
my skin's brown.
Having been adopted into a white
family, that was the most noticeable
thing about me, and so, for the same
reason that my cousin Dwayne was
called Flop Ears because of the wings
attached to either side of his head, I
was called Charlie Brown.
But it wasn't only the fact that she
had dredged up a long-buried nick
name. When I got back to the living
room, she started giving me hell for
throwing a dart into the back of Flop
Ears' leg.
Searching my memory, I recalled
that that incident had happened almost
ten years ago, back when I could still
convince my cousin of anything, such
as being the dartboard in our game of
darts.
My grandmother was talking like it
happened 10 minutes ago. And what
was worse, she was talking like a
spanking was going to come 10
minutes hence.
She wasn't delirious; she wasn't
rambling. The details were all very
concise, but there was the same disre
gard for temporal linearity and identity
of person that young children possess
— with the added experience of four of
my life-times to enrich the story.
At first it frightened me — I
thought she was losing her mind. But
after a bit, after I accepted it and
really listened, it was like listening to a

grand bed-time story, with all my
relatives as the characters.
I got all kinds of dirt, understood
my mom a little better and kinda
enjoyed being the linchpin for all her
musings. But my favorite parts were
when little old Charlie Brown made his
appearances and I got to know myself
as I was then.
When I finally got up to leave, I
bent down to kiss her, only to be
greeted by a, "I'll give you a kiss when
you graduate from that place down
there. You've been fartin' around too
long."
After I recovered from my shock at
this sudden here-and-nowness — the
last time I, Jason, had appeared I was
stationed somewhere overseas — 1 told
her not to worry.
Getting in the car, I had a feeling
far better than I had thought I would.
There was something comforting in
knowing that there was a replica of
myself, moving about her mental
world, who would always be young,
smart-assy and able to see life as a
collection of possibilities for the enact
ing.
Now, if I can just carry through on
my promise.. .

her. She said to me, "Charlie Brown,
go get yourself a soda. You look like
you're steaming at the ears."
She was right about the steaming;
her house has a swamp-cooler that
only manages to drip water, so the
place is always like a sauna.

I was halfway to the fridge before I
realized that she'd called me Charlie
Brown. I hadn't heard that since I was
14 years old. It was the nickname she
gave me because of the fact that, well,
my skin's brown.
Having been adopted into a white
family, that was the most noticeable
thing about me, and so, for the same
reason that my cousin Dwayne was
called Flop Ears because of the wings
attached to either side of his head, I
was called Charlie Brown.
But it wasn't only the fact that she
had dredged up a long-buried nick
name. When I got back to the living
room, she started giving me hell for
throwing a dart into the back of Flop
Ears' leg.
Searching my memory, I recalled
that that incident had happened almost
ten years ago, back when I could still
convince my cousin of anything, such
as being the dartboard in our game of
darts.
My grandmother was talking like it
happened 10 minutes ago. And what
was worse, she was talking like a
spanking was going to come 10
minutes hence.
She wasn't delirious; she wasn't
rambling. The details were all very
concise, but there was the same disre
gard for temporal linearity and identity
of person that young children possess
— with the added experience of four of
my life-times to enrich the story.
At first it frightened me — I
thought she was losing her mind. But
after a bit, after I accepted it and
really listened, it was like listening to a

grand bed-time story, with all my
relatives as the characters.
I got all kinds of dirt, understood
my mom a little better and kinda
enjoyed being the linchpin for all her
musings. But my favorite parts were
when little old Charlie Brown made his
appearances and I got to know myself
as I was then.
When I finally got up to leave, I
bent down to kiss her, only to be
greeted by a, "I'll give you a kiss when
you graduate from that place down
there. You've been fartin' around too
long."
After I recovered from my shock at
this sudden here-and-nowness — the
last time I, Jason, had appeared I was
stationed somewhere overseas — 1 told
her not to worry.
Getting in the car, I had a feeling
far better than I had thought I would.
There was something comforting in
knowing that there was a replica of
myself, moving about her mental
world, who would always be young,
smart-assy and able to see life as a
collection of possibilities for the enact
ing.
Now, if I can just carry through on
my promise.. .

ON MY WAY BACK FROM AN
internship in Denver at the end
of this summer, I stopped by my
grandmother's house in Northern
California. My mom had said that she
wasn't doing so well, and I better go
see her while, well, while I still could.
So I got out of the car intending on
staying for just a short while, long
enough to say hello and eat something
(can't leave my grandmother's house
without eating — house rules). But,
two hours later, I found myself still
there.
Why? It wasn't that I felt like I had
to see as much as possible of her
because there wouldn't be another
chance. The family, all of us, had
already gone through that stage about
a year ago.
My grandmother finally got so tired
of all the near-mourners (it's a big
brood) tramping around her house —
interrupting her naps and upsetting
her parakeet — that she told every
body to go away and let her live in
peace.
Though her condition had
deteriorated since then, I knew her
attitude was pretty much the same:
come see me if you want to say hi, but
don't be wearing black if you do.
No, it was something which came up
after about five minutes of talking to
her. She said to me, "Charlie Brown,
go get yourself a soda. You look like
you're steaming at the ears."
She was right about the steaming;
her house has a swamp-cooler that
only manages to drip water, so the
place is always like a sauna.
