## Graduate students need a larger selection in housing 
### 
I AM A FRESH GRADUATE stu
dent from a foreign country and
hence think that I am eminently
qualified to comment on the degree of
isolation experienced by international
graduate students.
The Oct. 3 Daily article "Turmoil
beneath the tranquility" succinctly
sums up the problems that may exist,
except that the culture at Stanford is
pretty much the same as in any large
urbanized area in other parts of the
world (or in Asia).
Then, why is it that graduate stu
dents face a sense of isolation?
The answer, in my view, is to be
found in the graduate living options
that are available.
Staying in Rains Houses or Escon
dido Village is isolating in its very
nature.
There are absolutely no avenues for
a graduate student living in an apart
ment to meet the same group of people

on a day to day basis.
The result — international graduate
students form little cliques comprised
of students from the same country,
with little or no interaction with the
local populace.
The solution — my personal experi
ence. I know that this is going to
sound corny to a lot of folks, but the
warmth and friendship that one experi
ences living in a co-operative atmos
phere is hard to match.
Just as undergraduates get a good
chance to form social bonds by inter
acting with their peers while living
together for the first year, similarly
graduate students in their first year
should be provided with a substantial
number of co-op-like residences.
Further, international graduate
students must be advised to opt for
friendlier housing, such as co-ops.
