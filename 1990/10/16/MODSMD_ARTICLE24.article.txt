# New policy on domestic partners doesn't make sense
## 
### 
An open letter to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy:
As a newly married couple, we are
very distressed over the decision that
you made on Oct. 10 in regard to the
allotting of spouse benefits to lesbian
and gay domestic partners, as well as
to unmarried heterosexual couples.
We were especially astonished with
your decision as neither the State of
California nor the United States of
America recognizes the gay and lesbian
community to be the beneficiary of
marital privileges. Why then, would
one university make such a decision?
In regard to the unmarried hetero

sexual couples, why should they receive
the same benefits as those married
couples who have been recognized by
the State of California? It does not
make any sense.
Unmarried couples have many op
tions: They may participate in the
Draw together, they may join fraterni
ties or sororities, and they may even
choose to live oft campus.
Married student housing is just that
— for married students — not for a
man and a woman who want to live
together, nor a man and a man, nor a
woman with a woman. We would have
been very upset, as would other
married couples, if we were unable to
receive married housing because it was
occupied by unmarried heterosexual or
homosexual couples.
