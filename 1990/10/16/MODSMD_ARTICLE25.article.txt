# A 						cappella songs stereotyped women
## 
### 
Last Friday night, we attended the
Senior Event, which included perform
ances by several of the Stanford a
cappella groups. Although we appreci
ated their skill and generally enjoyed
their shows, we are concerned that two
of the songs/skits contained language
and imagery that reinforced damaging
stereotypes of men and women.
In particular, we found the song
performed by the Mendicants, "Paddlin'
Madeline," which contains the line,
"She nevers says 'No,' so I just kiss
and go," an irresponsible choice in a
society trying to eradicate sexual as
sault.
In addition, one haiku in Fleet
Street's "Haiku Hut" spoof perpetuated

the equation of beer and "babes"
(women) as essential commodities in
tended for consumption at any success
ful party. It is precisely these kind of
images that obstruct efforts to end
rape and other forms of sexual abuse.
Though each group, of course, is free
to choose any song they want, we hope
they realize the significant social con
sequences of that choice. We would like
to join Civil Engineering Prof. Gilbert
Masters, who also spoke on Friday, in
reminding us all that, "If you're not
part of the solution, you're part of the
problem."
That means we need to be responsi
ble for all of our language â€” even in
small or entertaining moments.
