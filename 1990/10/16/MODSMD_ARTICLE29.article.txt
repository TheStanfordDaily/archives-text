The General paid no atten

the overwhelming revelation that
the headlong race between his
misfortunes and his dreams was

— "The General in His Labyrinth"

In his latest novel, Nobel Prize
winning writer Gabriel Garcia
Marquez brings us once again into
his somber, magical world.
But this time the basis for the
tale is factual, not fictional. "The
General in His Labyrinth" is the
story of the last days in the life
of Simon Bolivar, the great
liberator of South America.
The book is the product of two
long years of historical research
by Garcia Marquez, who gives
credit to many scholars for their
help in a note at the end of the
book.
Using documented facts about
Bolivar's life as a starting point,
Garcia Marquez paints a vivid
psychological portrait of the

Liberator and delves deeply into
the complex and often contradic
tory forces that shaped Bolivar's
life.
The last days of Bolivar's life
are marked by his trip down
Colombia's Magdalena River after
losing power. Garcia Marquez's in
terest in the river, which he
traveled 11 times as a student
growing up in Colombia, began
early. This interest combined with

a friend's idea to do a book on
Bolivar to give birth to "The Gen

Garcia Marquez fills in the
pieces of the General's life by de
scribing these memories. The past
and present of the book sometimes
merge in a style reminiscent of
William Faulkner.
Garcia Marquez also gives
details about Bolivar's com
panions. Everyone has a story and
Garcia Marquez tells them all
with consummate skill.
Bolivar's memories and his
reflections are much like the at
tempts of an individual to find a
way out of a maze.
Bolivar follows the thread of dif
ferent ideas to try and understand
his life and make sense of it. Each
memory leads off from the dull
progression of his consciousness
and offers hope for escape.
But the fact that the structure
of this book can be classified as
labyrinthian is only icing on the
cake. It is a little intellectual perk
for someone who sits down to
think about the novel.
The work itself doesn't need
any tricks. Garcia Marquez
creates vivid, memorable charac
ters. He is a master of mood and,
even translated into English, the
language of his story rivals (and
beats) that of almost any native
English writer today.
While "The General in His
Labyrinth" is not as memorable
as "Love in the Time of Cholera"
or as ambitious as "One Hundred
Years of Solitude," it is still a
great piece of work.
If you are a Garcia Marquez
fan, you may be a little disap
pointed. If you aren't a Garcia
Marquez fan, "The General in His
Labyrinth" might be a good way
to start on the road to becoming
one.
