# Stanford vulnerable on indirect cost issues
## Library charges illustrate larger complexities 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Shortly after allegations first surfaced
that Stanford had overbilled the federal
government for indirect costs, a banner
headline ran across the front page of The
Peninsula Times Tribune:
FEDS MAY SEEK $300 MILLION
FROM STANFORD.
The Times Tribune story, like several
others that popped up in the Bay Area

media at the same time,
asserted that over the last
decade Stanford had repeat
edly overcharged the gov
ernment for indirect costs

incurred by researchers doing federally
sponsored work here.
The stories noted that Paul Biddle, a fed
eral regulator based at Stanford, had
accused the University of "fraud" and
"abuse," and that two federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost policies had
subsequently been launched.
The total cost of the alleged wrongdoing,
estimated at $300 million in the Times Tri
bune story — but $200 million in some
other newspapers — was attributed to a
"congressional source, who asked not to be
identified."
In the following days, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy curtly dismissed the
media account as "imaginative," even jok
ing at a Faculty Senate meeting later that
week that the Times Tribune headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to their cardi
ologists."
Quite clearly, he said, the allegations just
didn't square with the available data. Over
the last decade, Stanford has received
roughly $554 million in indirect cost recov
ery from the federal government.
The $300 million figure that circulated
represented more than half that amount,
Kennedy noted. The figure in the Times-
Tribune story had been "plucked out of the
air," he told The Daily.
While in their public assertions Kennedy
and other administrators here have

The process may not
quit until it finds some
small pound of flesh.'

adamantly argued that Stanford has noth
ing to hide, privately they express concern
that they will likely see several more nega
tive headlines in the upcoming months.
It's not that Stanford administrators are
conceding any fault on the University's
part. Rather, they have realized that the
complexities involved in calculating indi
rect costs and the political controversy this
issue has recently generated leaves Stan
ford very vulnerable to charges of wrongdo
ing.
Representatives from the General
Accounting Office, one of two federal agen
cies scrutinizing indirect cost practices at
Stanford, arrived on campus last week to
begin an investigation that is likely to take
several months.
In addition, the Office of Naval
Research, the agency that represents the
government in indirect cost negotiations
with Stanford, has launched a review of
practices here following the charges of
abuse made by Biddle, who is the ONR's
representative assigned to Stanford.
As these investigations proceed, sensi
tive policy issues will be fully exposed and
many complicated practices will be rigor
ously questioned, making it difficult for the
press and the public to untangle questions
of policy and questions of propriety.
Due to this potential for misunderstand
ing, "it's really not in our interests to have
the whole process become a public one,"
said Dean of Research Robert Byer.
Federal investigations such as those now
underway are inherently political, adminis
trators say. They tend to have winners and
losers. "This process may not quit until it
finds some small pound of flesh," said one
Stanford administrator.
Concerns about Stanford's
integrity are being voiced at the
same time many in Washington
are attacking long-standing gov
ernment indirect cost policies. As
the federal deficit has increased,
government regulators have
become increasingly alarmed
about rising indirect cost rates at
prominent research universities
nationwide.
Strained relations
At the same time, many in
academia feel the partnership
between government and univer
sities that has guided federal
research policy for decades is cur
rently crumbling.
"There no longer exists in the
Congress or the Administration a
strong, shared vision of how and
why the federal government
should support research ... in
universities," according to a
December 1988 draft of a report
by the American Association of
Universities. "As a result, the
underpinnings of the system ...
have come under increasing
attack."
At the request of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, the GAO is now
examining four universities as
part of a larger probe into federal
indirect cost policies.
While a staff member of the
House subcommittee said the
GAO has had "no given criteria"
for selecting the universities it will
investigate, the reason Stanford
was chosen is quite clear.
"Because we know of problems
with the indirect cost rates there,"
she said.
In the same conversation, the
staff member repeated the allega
tion that had appeared in the
Times Tribune and other Bay
Area media. Stanford, she said,
had overbilled the federal govern
ment by between $200 and $300
million over the last decade.
She asked not to be identified
and said her information about
Stanford came from a source "con
sidered reliable by the subcommit
tee."
Overcharging for libraries
More specifically, Stanford has
overcharged the government by
$50 million during the last decade
for use of University libraries for
research purposes, the staff mem
ber said, and offered details of how
that figure had been computed.
University administrators have
subsequently dismissed the alle
gation of library overbilling as
"way out of line" as well.
While the allegation of over
billing related to use of Stanford's
libraries represents just a fraction
of the alleged wrongdoing, a closer

look at that particular charge
highlights many of the issues cen
tral to the federal investigations.
A closer look underlines the
complex and controversial system
of indirect cost recovery that has
evolved between the government
and research universities. It illus
trates why such disparate views of
reality are being presented by the
House subcommittee staff and
Stanford officials.
In addition, examination of
library-related indirect costs
explains why Stanford adminis

trators fear that
even if Stanford
has not broken
any rules, the
University is un
likely to escape
the federal in
vestigations un
scathed.
Indirect costs
are those costs

that researchers incur that are
not easily attributable to a specific
project. If a researcher uses a
Stanford library for work on a fed
erally sponsored research project,
there is an indirect cost incurred.
The fraction of the library's
operating budget that is necessary
to support that researcher's work
is considered a legitimate indirect
cost, and Stanford can be reim
bursed by the government for that
amount.
If a graduate student assisting
that researcher uses a scientific
journal in a Stanford library for
federally sponsored research, the
corresponding fraction of the
library's operating cost, as well as
a fraction of the cost of the sub
scription price, is considered an
indirect cost of the research.
Taking such things into consid
eration, a University must project
what percentage of the operating

expenses of its libraries it believes
will be used to support research in
upcoming years. Estimates on
library and other indirect costs
must be made in ...Ivance so that
researchers seeking federal grants
know what to ask for.
At Stanford, where the indirect
cost rate is 74 percent, a
researcher who wants to conduct
$100,000 worth of research must
seek an additional $74,000 from
the government to cover indirect
costs. Stanford's rate is among the
highest in the nation.

The Defense Con
tracting Audit Agency
'has bigger fish to
catch than Stanford.'
— Robert Byer

The process of determining
what qualifies as a legitimate indi
rect cost and what does not is a
controversial one. Well-inten
tioned people often disagree over
such matters, administrators say.
A little guesswork
Computing the indirect cost
rate is not an easy task either.
Doing so involves multi-variable
mathematical formulas and com
plex computer programs. It also
involves some guesswork. "All we
can do is make our best guess and
hope we're close," said Byer, the
dean of research.
For the most part, Stanford has
guessed well. Projected indirect
costs rates have been within 2 per
cent of the rate later settled upon
by Stanford and federal auditors.
A provision called "carry-forward"
is built into the system to account
for this difference. If Stanford,

based on its projections, over
recovers or under-recovers in a
given year, the difference affects
the rate in subsequent years.
During fiscal years 1981 and
1982, for example, Stanford
under-recovered by $6.3 million.
That money was later captured by
adjusting the indirect cost rate
upward for 1987, 1988 and 1989.
Allegations of wrongdoing aside,
Provost James Rosse says the
University has in fact under
recovered by roughly $13 million
over the last decade.
Most administrators agree that
if the carry-forward process is to
function properly, the government
must perform audits promptly.
The Defense Contracting Audit
Agency is the federal agency that
audits Stanford's indirect cost
recovery.
As of last month, the only years
during the last decade that had
been audited by the DCAA were
1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. The
1984-86 reports were sent to Stan
ford in May 1990.
According to Stanford adminis
trators, auditing the University's
indirect cost recovery has been
low on the priority list of the
DCAA. The agency has been
understaffed for the last several
years and must also audit large
defense contractors that do busi
ness with the Navy, said Byer. The
DCAA "has bigger fish to catch
than Stanford," he said.
Indirect cost rate guidelines
The methodology used in pro
jecting indirect costs, including
those attributed to the libraries, is
outlined in federal guidelines
titled Circular A-21.
The guidelines offer a standard
methodology for computing
library costs, but also allow insti
tutions to conduct a "special
study" to determine some aspects
of its indirect costs if the institu
tion believes it is necessary. Stan
ford has conducted several special
studies, including one with regard
to use of its libraries.
Based on the special study, a
"memoranda of understanding" is
signed by the university and the
government representative as
signed to the university. The docu
ment in effect replaces the section
of the A-21 guidelines relevant to
the study, and is generally valid
for several years.
In most areas, Circular A-21
provides a great deal of this kind
of flexibility. But that flexibility
also creates confusion.
"The system's intended flexi
bility has allowed different univer
sities to interpret and adhere to
the guidelines in a myriad of
ways," according to the report by
the Association of American Uni
versities. "The lack of clarity has
caused a great deal of friction
among Congress, sponsoring
agencies and universities."
Stanford's library study was
originally conducted in 1965. The
basic methodology of that study
was then utilized in three later
studies, the most recent going into
effect in 1984.
The terms of the 1984 study
expired in 1988, but are still used
in calculating indirect costs
attributable to the libraries,
according to Byer.
There were plans to repeat the
library study in 1989, but that
never happened, Byer said. Con
cerns Biddle raised about method
ology derailed the effort, accord
ing to Byer.
As a result, the library study
has "fallen between the cracks,"
Byer said. "It's in this state of
limbo now."
Byer said Biddle has been slow
to relate his specific concerns
about the methodology. Biddle has
been unavailable for comment.
According to University Con
troller Frank Riddle, one of the
library studies conducted in the
early 1970s was rigorously
reviewed by both the ONR and the
DCAA. The terms of the study
that resulted were the product of

tough negotia
tions between
these agencies
and Stanford rep
resentatives. "We
acquiesced on a
couple of ele
ments," Riddle
recalled.
When the
1984 study was

completed, however, the DCAA
declined to audit its results, Rid
dle said. A DCAA spokesman said
he is not at liberty to discuss
issues relevant to the ongoing
investigations.
"Statistically flawed" data
In the meantime, Stanford con
tinues to use an unaudited study
which has since expired to calcu
late its library costs.
The Oversight and Investiga
tions subcommittee staff member
who spoke to The Daily said the
library studies Stanford has used
are "statistically flawed" and "far
too generous" to Stanford.
The studies have allowed Stan
ford to charge the government
"well in excess of the A-21 guide
lines," the subcommittee staff

member said. "The government
may have overpaid by $50 million
on the library."
The alleged "overtoiling" she
referred to is the difference
between what Stanford recovered
under the terms of its special
studies and what she calls "stan
dard A-21 methodology." But, she
conceded, until Biddle stepped in,
the government had not voiced
opposition to the studies. "It's not
really fair just to blame Stanford
University," she says. "We're look
ing at all sides."
According to the subcommittee
staff member, the $50 million fig
ure comes from calculations made
by Biddle. She said her office
obtained a memo from the DCAA

backing Biddle's
overtoiling fig
ures for three
years: 1984, 1985
and 1986.
A DCAA spokes
man would neither
confirm nor deny
that such a memo
exists.

According to
the subcommittee staff member,
the DCAA supported the following
assertions made by Biddle: that
the government had overpaid
Stanford on library costs by $5
million in 1984, $5.4 million in
1985 and $5.9 million in 1986.
Using these numbers, Biddle then
made projections to include three
other years (1983, 1987 and
1988), producing an overbilling
total of around $50 million for the
period in question, she said.
A substanial fraction
The alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recov
ered on library costs. In 1985, for
example, Stanford recovered $7.1
million in indirect costs associated

anybody's building
swimming pools or
taking trips to Tahiti.'

with libraries. Biddle is in effect
questioning $5.4 million of that
amount, according to the data
supplied by the subcommittee
staff member.
The allegation "doesn't seem
logical to me," said Riddle.
Stanford does recover much
more on its library than do most
universities. Figures released by
Stanford show that over the past
decade about 7 percent of Stan
ford's indirect cost rate has been
derived from library costs each
year.
Most universities have library
rates between two and four per
centage points, according to the
Association of American Universi
ties report. However, the report
notes, a small number of schools
claim higher recovery, based on

The charge of over
billing on the library
'doesn't seem logical

special facilities or patterns of use,
and library costs do differ signifi
cantly from university to univer
sity.
According to Riddle and other
University administrators, Stan
ford's indirect costs attributable
to the library are higher than
other universities primarily
because "Stanford spends more on
its libraries than a lot of other
institutions."
In his March 6 letter, Biddle,
the ONR representative, referred
to "flaws in the special study of
the library." He concluded that,
due in part to these alleged flaws,
the "government should scruti
nize carefully what has been
agreed to in the past before allow-

ing these agreements to bind us in
the future."
More generally, Biddle asserted
that Stanford should not be
allowed to enter into memoranda
of understanding with the govern
ment due to past abuses: "I
believe (memoranda of under
standing) should be instituted
only for those institutions which
evidence a respect for the process
(and) do not distort the intent of
government."
In a May 1989 letter from Bid
dle to Janet Sweet, Stanford's
assistant controller, Biddle wrote
that it "may well be . . . prefer
able" that Stanford compute
library costs by the method out
lined in Circular A-21, rather than
by special study.
Byer, Stanford's dean of
research, openly acknowledges
that Stanford's indirect costs rate
on libraries is "higher than the
(Circular A-21) default rate." But
that, he said, is due to special
studies that both Stanford and the
government have agreed to.
"We think our methodology is
correct," he said. There can be
legitimate differences of opinion
on how indirect costs are deter
mined, he said, but once that is
done, "you should live with the
outcome."
Rosse concurred. "Surely this
is a dispute that can be resolved by
an appeal to the records," he said.
"There's nothing illegal about it.
It's not as though anybody's
building swimming pools or tak
ing trips to Tahiti."
Nevertheless, Rosse said, he is
quite sure more headlines about
questionable indirect cost prac
tices at Stanford will make it into
print. The media, he said, are
often eager to damage the reputa
tions of prestigious institutions.
"Sometimes I wish we'd go back to
being a sleepy regional universi
ty," he said, chuckling.

backing Biddle's
overtoiling fig
ures for three
years: 1984, 1985
and 1986.
A DCAA spokes
man would neither
confirm nor deny
that such a memo
exists.

According to
the subcommittee staff member,
the DCAA supported the following
assertions made by Biddle: that
the government had overpaid
Stanford on library costs by $5
million in 1984, $5.4 million in
1985 and $5.9 million in 1986.
Using these numbers, Biddle then
made projections to include three
other years (1983, 1987 and
1988), producing an overbilling
total of around $50 million for the
period in question, she said.
A substanial fraction
The alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recov
ered on library costs. In 1985, for
example, Stanford recovered $7.1
million in indirect costs associated

anybody's building
swimming pools or
taking trips to Tahiti.'

with libraries. Biddle is in effect
questioning $5.4 million of that
amount, according to the data
supplied by the subcommittee
staff member.
The allegation "doesn't seem
logical to me," said Riddle.
Stanford does recover much
more on its library than do most
universities. Figures released by
Stanford show that over the past
decade about 7 percent of Stan
ford's indirect cost rate has been
derived from library costs each
year.
Most universities have library
rates between two and four per
centage points, according to the
Association of American Universi
ties report. However, the report
notes, a small number of schools
claim higher recovery, based on

The charge of over
billing on the library

special facilities or patterns of use,
and library costs do differ signifi
cantly from university to univer
sity.
According to Riddle and other
University administrators, Stan
ford's indirect costs attributable
to the library are higher than
other universities primarily
because "Stanford spends more on
its libraries than a lot of other
institutions."
In his March 6 letter, Biddle,
the ONR representative, referred
to "flaws in the special study of
the library." He concluded that,
due in part to these alleged flaws,
the "government should scruti
nize carefully what has been
agreed to in the past before allow-

ing these agreements to bind us in
the future."
More generally, Biddle asserted
that Stanford should not be
allowed to enter into memoranda
of understanding with the govern
ment due to past abuses: "I
believe (memoranda of under
standing) should be instituted
only for those institutions which
evidence a respect for the process
(and) do not distort the intent of
government."
In a May 1989 letter from Bid
dle to Janet Sweet, Stanford's
assistant controller, Biddle wrote
that it "may well be . . . prefer
able" that Stanford compute
library costs by the method out
lined in Circular A-21, rather than
by special study.
Byer, Stanford's dean of
research, openly acknowledges
that Stanford's indirect costs rate
on libraries is "higher than the
(Circular A-21) default rate." But
that, he said, is due to special
studies that both Stanford and the
government have agreed to.
"We think our methodology is
correct," he said. There can be
legitimate differences of opinion
on how indirect costs are deter
mined, he said, but once that is
done, "you should live with the
outcome."
Rosse concurred. "Surely this
is a dispute that can be resolved by
an appeal to the records," he said.
"There's nothing illegal about it.
It's not as though anybody's
building swimming pools or tak
ing trips to Tahiti."
Nevertheless, Rosse said, he is
quite sure more headlines about
questionable indirect cost prac
tices at Stanford will make it into
print. The media, he said, are
often eager to damage the reputa
tions of prestigious institutions.
"Sometimes I wish we'd go back to
being a sleepy regional universi
ty," he said, chuckling.



Shortly after allegations first surfaced
that Stanford had overbilled the federal
government for indirect costs, a banner
headline ran across the front page of The
Peninsula Times Tribune:
FEDS MAY SEEK $300 MILLION
FROM STANFORD.
The Times Tribune story, like several
others that popped up in the Bay Area

News
analysis

media at the same time,
asserted that over the last
decade Stanford had repeat
edly overcharged the gov
ernment for indirect costs

incurred by researchers doing federally
sponsored work here.
The stories noted that Paul Biddle, a fed
eral regulator based at Stanford, had
accused the University of "fraud" and
"abuse," and that two federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost policies had
subsequently been launched.
The total cost of the alleged wrongdoing,
estimated at $300 million in the Times Tri
bune story — but $200 million in some
other newspapers — was attributed to a
"congressional source, who asked not to be
identified."
In the following days, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy curtly dismissed the
media account as "imaginative," even jok
ing at a Faculty Senate meeting later that
week that the Times Tribune headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to their cardi
ologists."
Quite clearly, he said, the allegations just
didn't square with the available data. Over
the last decade, Stanford has received
roughly $554 million in indirect cost recov
ery from the federal government.
The $300 million figure that circulated
represented more than half that amount,
Kennedy noted. The figure in the Times-
Tribune story had been "plucked out of the
air," he told The Daily.
While in their public assertions Kennedy
and other administrators here have

The process may not
quit until it finds some
small pound of flesh.'

adamantly argued that Stanford has noth
ing to hide, privately they express concern
that they will likely see several more nega
tive headlines in the upcoming months.
It's not that Stanford administrators are
conceding any fault on the University's
part. Rather, they have realized that the
complexities involved in calculating indi
rect costs and the political controversy this
issue has recently generated leaves Stan
ford very vulnerable to charges of wrongdo
ing.
Representatives from the General
Accounting Office, one of two federal agen
cies scrutinizing indirect cost practices at
Stanford, arrived on campus last week to
begin an investigation that is likely to take
several months.
In addition, the Office of Naval
Research, the agency that represents the
government in indirect cost negotiations
with Stanford, has launched a review of
practices here following the charges of
abuse made by Biddle, who is the ONR's
representative assigned to Stanford.
As these investigations proceed, sensi
tive policy issues will be fully exposed and
many complicated practices will be rigor
ously questioned, making it difficult for the
press and the public to untangle questions
of policy and questions of propriety.
Due to this potential for misunderstand
ing, "it's really not in our interests to have
the whole process become a public one,"
said Dean of Research Robert Byer.
Federal investigations such as those now
underway are inherently political, adminis
trators say. They tend to have winners and
losers. "This process may not quit until it
finds some small pound of flesh," said one
Stanford administrator.
Concerns about Stanford's
integrity are being voiced at the
same time many in Washington
are attacking long-standing gov
ernment indirect cost policies. As
the federal deficit has increased,
government regulators have
become increasingly alarmed
about rising indirect cost rates at
prominent research universities
nationwide.
Strained relations
At the same time, many in
academia feel the partnership
between government and univer
sities that has guided federal
research policy for decades is cur
rently crumbling.
"There no longer exists in the
Congress or the Administration a
strong, shared vision of how and
why the federal government
should support research ... in
universities," according to a
December 1988 draft of a report
by the American Association of
Universities. "As a result, the
underpinnings of the system ...
have come under increasing
attack."
At the request of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, the GAO is now
examining four universities as
part of a larger probe into federal
indirect cost policies.
While a staff member of the
House subcommittee said the
GAO has had "no given criteria"
for selecting the universities it will
investigate, the reason Stanford
was chosen is quite clear.
"Because we know of problems
with the indirect cost rates there,"
she said.
In the same conversation, the
staff member repeated the allega
tion that had appeared in the
Times Tribune and other Bay
Area media. Stanford, she said,
had overbilled the federal govern
ment by between $200 and $300
million over the last decade.
She asked not to be identified
and said her information about
Stanford came from a source "con
sidered reliable by the subcommit
tee."
Overcharging for libraries
More specifically, Stanford has
overcharged the government by
$50 million during the last decade
for use of University libraries for
research purposes, the staff mem
ber said, and offered details of how
that figure had been computed.
University administrators have
subsequently dismissed the alle
gation of library overbilling as
"way out of line" as well.
While the allegation of over
billing related to use of Stanford's
libraries represents just a fraction
of the alleged wrongdoing, a closer

look at that particular charge
highlights many of the issues cen
tral to the federal investigations.
A closer look underlines the
complex and controversial system
of indirect cost recovery that has
evolved between the government
and research universities. It illus
trates why such disparate views of
reality are being presented by the
House subcommittee staff and
Stanford officials.
In addition, examination of
library-related indirect costs
explains why Stanford adminis

trators fear that
even if Stanford
has not broken
any rules, the
University is un
likely to escape
the federal in
vestigations un
scathed.
Indirect costs
are those costs

that researchers incur that are
not easily attributable to a specific
project. If a researcher uses a
Stanford library for work on a fed
erally sponsored research project,
there is an indirect cost incurred.
The fraction of the library's
operating budget that is necessary
to support that researcher's work
is considered a legitimate indirect
cost, and Stanford can be reim
bursed by the government for that
amount.
If a graduate student assisting
that researcher uses a scientific
journal in a Stanford library for
federally sponsored research, the
corresponding fraction of the
library's operating cost, as well as
a fraction of the cost of the sub
scription price, is considered an
indirect cost of the research.
Taking such things into consid
eration, a University must project
what percentage of the operating

expenses of its libraries it believes
will be used to support research in
upcoming years. Estimates on
library and other indirect costs
must be made in ...Ivance so that
researchers seeking federal grants
know what to ask for.
At Stanford, where the indirect
cost rate is 74 percent, a
researcher who wants to conduct
$100,000 worth of research must
seek an additional $74,000 from
the government to cover indirect
costs. Stanford's rate is among the
highest in the nation.

The Defense Con
tracting Audit Agency
'has bigger fish to
catch than Stanford.'
— Robert Byer

The process of determining
what qualifies as a legitimate indi
rect cost and what does not is a
controversial one. Well-inten
tioned people often disagree over
such matters, administrators say.
A little guesswork
Computing the indirect cost
rate is not an easy task either.
Doing so involves multi-variable
mathematical formulas and com
plex computer programs. It also
involves some guesswork. "All we
can do is make our best guess and
hope we're close," said Byer, the
dean of research.
For the most part, Stanford has
guessed well. Projected indirect
costs rates have been within 2 per
cent of the rate later settled upon
by Stanford and federal auditors.
A provision called "carry-forward"
is built into the system to account
for this difference. If Stanford,

based on its projections, over
recovers or under-recovers in a
given year, the difference affects
the rate in subsequent years.
During fiscal years 1981 and
1982, for example, Stanford
under-recovered by $6.3 million.
That money was later captured by
adjusting the indirect cost rate
upward for 1987, 1988 and 1989.
Allegations of wrongdoing aside,
Provost James Rosse says the
University has in fact under
recovered by roughly $13 million
over the last decade.
Most administrators agree that
if the carry-forward process is to
function properly, the government
must perform audits promptly.
The Defense Contracting Audit
Agency is the federal agency that
audits Stanford's indirect cost
recovery.
As of last month, the only years
during the last decade that had
been audited by the DCAA were
1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. The
1984-86 reports were sent to Stan
ford in May 1990.
According to Stanford adminis
trators, auditing the University's
indirect cost recovery has been
low on the priority list of the
DCAA. The agency has been
understaffed for the last several
years and must also audit large
defense contractors that do busi
ness with the Navy, said Byer. The
DCAA "has bigger fish to catch
than Stanford," he said.
Indirect cost rate guidelines
The methodology used in pro
jecting indirect costs, including
those attributed to the libraries, is
outlined in federal guidelines
titled Circular A-21.
The guidelines offer a standard
methodology for computing
library costs, but also allow insti
tutions to conduct a "special
study" to determine some aspects
of its indirect costs if the institu
tion believes it is necessary. Stan
ford has conducted several special
studies, including one with regard
to use of its libraries.
Based on the special study, a
"memoranda of understanding" is
signed by the university and the
government representative as
signed to the university. The docu
ment in effect replaces the section
of the A-21 guidelines relevant to
the study, and is generally valid
for several years.
In most areas, Circular A-21
provides a great deal of this kind
of flexibility. But that flexibility
also creates confusion.
"The system's intended flexi
bility has allowed different univer
sities to interpret and adhere to
the guidelines in a myriad of
ways," according to the report by
the Association of American Uni
versities. "The lack of clarity has
caused a great deal of friction
among Congress, sponsoring
agencies and universities."
Stanford's library study was
originally conducted in 1965. The
basic methodology of that study
was then utilized in three later
studies, the most recent going into
effect in 1984.
The terms of the 1984 study
expired in 1988, but are still used
in calculating indirect costs
attributable to the libraries,
according to Byer.
There were plans to repeat the
library study in 1989, but that
never happened, Byer said. Con
cerns Biddle raised about method
ology derailed the effort, accord
ing to Byer.
As a result, the library study
has "fallen between the cracks,"
Byer said. "It's in this state of
limbo now."
Byer said Biddle has been slow
to relate his specific concerns
about the methodology. Biddle has
been unavailable for comment.
According to University Con
troller Frank Riddle, one of the
library studies conducted in the
early 1970s was rigorously
reviewed by both the ONR and the
DCAA. The terms of the study
that resulted were the product of

tough negotia
tions between
these agencies
and Stanford rep
resentatives. "We
acquiesced on a
couple of ele
ments," Riddle
recalled.
When the
1984 study was

completed, however, the DCAA
declined to audit its results, Rid
dle said. A DCAA spokesman said
he is not at liberty to discuss
issues relevant to the ongoing
investigations.
"Statistically flawed" data
In the meantime, Stanford con
tinues to use an unaudited study
which has since expired to calcu
late its library costs.
The Oversight and Investiga
tions subcommittee staff member
who spoke to The Daily said the
library studies Stanford has used
are "statistically flawed" and "far
too generous" to Stanford.
The studies have allowed Stan
ford to charge the government
"well in excess of the A-21 guide
lines," the subcommittee staff

member said. "The government
may have overpaid by $50 million
on the library."
The alleged "overtoiling" she
referred to is the difference
between what Stanford recovered
under the terms of its special
studies and what she calls "stan
dard A-21 methodology." But, she
conceded, until Biddle stepped in,
the government had not voiced
opposition to the studies. "It's not
really fair just to blame Stanford
University," she says. "We're look
ing at all sides."
According to the subcommittee
staff member, the $50 million fig
ure comes from calculations made
by Biddle. She said her office
obtained a memo from the DCAA

backing Biddle's
overtoiling fig
ures for three
years: 1984, 1985
and 1986.
A DCAA spokes
man would neither
confirm nor deny
that such a memo
exists.

According to
the subcommittee staff member,
the DCAA supported the following
assertions made by Biddle: that
the government had overpaid
Stanford on library costs by $5
million in 1984, $5.4 million in
1985 and $5.9 million in 1986.
Using these numbers, Biddle then
made projections to include three
other years (1983, 1987 and
1988), producing an overbilling
total of around $50 million for the
period in question, she said.
A substanial fraction
The alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recov
ered on library costs. In 1985, for

1984-86 reports were sent to Stan
ford in May 1990.
According to Stanford adminis
trators, auditing the University's
indirect cost recovery has been
low on the priority list of the
DCAA. The agency has been
understaffed for the last several
years and must also audit large
defense contractors that do busi
ness with the Navy, said Byer. The
DCAA "has bigger fish to catch
than Stanford," he said.
Indirect cost rate guidelines
The methodology used in pro
jecting indirect costs, including
those attributed to the libraries, is
outlined in federal guidelines
titled Circular A-21.
The guidelines offer a standard
methodology for computing
library costs, but also allow insti
tutions to conduct a "special
study" to determine some aspects
of its indirect costs if the institu
tion believes it is necessary. Stan
ford has conducted several special
studies, including one with regard
to use of its libraries.
Based on the special study, a
"memoranda of understanding" is
signed by the university and the
government representative as
signed to the university. The docu
ment in effect replaces the section
of the A-21 guidelines relevant to
the study, and is generally valid
for several years.
In most areas, Circular A-21
provides a great deal of this kind
of flexibility. But that flexibility
also creates confusion.
"The system's intended flexi
bility has allowed different univer
sities to interpret and adhere to
the guidelines in a myriad of
ways," according to the report by
the Association of American Uni
versities. "The lack of clarity has
caused a great deal of friction
among Congress, sponsoring
agencies and universities."
Stanford's library study was
originally conducted in 1965. The
basic methodology of that study
was then utilized in three later
studies, the most recent going into
effect in 1984.
The terms of the 1984 study
expired in 1988, but are still used
in calculating indirect costs
attributable to the libraries,
according to Byer.
There were plans to repeat the
library study in 1989, but that
never happened, Byer said. Con
cerns Biddle raised about method
ology derailed the effort, accord
ing to Byer.
As a result, the library study
has "fallen between the cracks,"
Byer said. "It's in this state of
limbo now."
Byer said Biddle has been slow
to relate his specific concerns
about the methodology. Biddle has
been unavailable for comment.
According to University Con
troller Frank Riddle, one of the
library studies conducted in the
early 1970s was rigorously
reviewed by both the ONR and the
DCAA. The terms of the study
that resulted were the product of

tough negotia
tions between
these agencies
and Stanford rep
resentatives. "We
acquiesced on a
couple of ele
ments," Riddle
recalled.
When the
1984 study was

completed, however, the DCAA
declined to audit its results, Rid
dle said. A DCAA spokesman said
he is not at liberty to discuss
issues relevant to the ongoing
investigations.
"Statistically flawed" data
In the meantime, Stanford con
tinues to use an unaudited study
which has since expired to calcu
late its library costs.
The Oversight and Investiga
tions subcommittee staff member
who spoke to The Daily said the
library studies Stanford has used
are "statistically flawed" and "far
too generous" to Stanford.
The studies have allowed Stan
ford to charge the government
"well in excess of the A-21 guide
lines," the subcommittee staff

member said. "The government
may have overpaid by $50 million
on the library."
The alleged "overtoiling" she
referred to is the difference
between what Stanford recovered
under the terms of its special
studies and what she calls "stan
dard A-21 methodology." But, she
conceded, until Biddle stepped in,
the government had not voiced
opposition to the studies. "It's not
really fair just to blame Stanford
University," she says. "We're look
ing at all sides."
According to the subcommittee
staff member, the $50 million fig
ure comes from calculations made
by Biddle. She said her office
obtained a memo from the DCAA

backing Biddle's
overtoiling fig
ures for three
years: 1984, 1985
and 1986.
A DCAA spokes
man would neither
confirm nor deny
that such a memo
exists.

According to
the subcommittee staff member,
the DCAA supported the following
assertions made by Biddle: that
the government had overpaid
Stanford on library costs by $5
million in 1984, $5.4 million in
1985 and $5.9 million in 1986.
Using these numbers, Biddle then
made projections to include three
other years (1983, 1987 and
1988), producing an overbilling
total of around $50 million for the
period in question, she said.
A substanial fraction
The alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recov
ered on library costs. In 1985, for
example, Stanford recovered $7.1
million in indirect costs associated

'It's not as though
anybody's building
swimming pools or
taking trips to Tahiti.'
— James Rosse

with libraries. Biddle is in effect
questioning $5.4 million of that
amount, according to the data
supplied by the subcommittee
staff member.
The allegation "doesn't seem
logical to me," said Riddle.
Stanford does recover much
more on its library than do most
universities. Figures released by
Stanford show that over the past
decade about 7 percent of Stan
ford's indirect cost rate has been
derived from library costs each
year.
Most universities have library
rates between two and four per
centage points, according to the
Association of American Universi
ties report. However, the report
notes, a small number of schools
claim higher recovery, based on

The charge of over
billing on the library

special facilities or patterns of use,
and library costs do differ signifi
cantly from university to univer
sity.
According to Riddle and other
University administrators, Stan
ford's indirect costs attributable
to the library are higher than
other universities primarily
because "Stanford spends more on
its libraries than a lot of other
institutions."
In his March 6 letter, Biddle,
the ONR representative, referred
to "flaws in the special study of
the library." He concluded that,
due in part to these alleged flaws,
the "government should scruti
nize carefully what has been
agreed to in the past before allow-

ing these agreements to bind us in
the future."
More generally, Biddle asserted
that Stanford should not be
allowed to enter into memoranda
of understanding with the govern
ment due to past abuses: "I
believe (memoranda of under
standing) should be instituted
only for those institutions which
evidence a respect for the process
(and) do not distort the intent of
government."
In a May 1989 letter from Bid
dle to Janet Sweet, Stanford's
assistant controller, Biddle wrote
that it "may well be . . . prefer
able" that Stanford compute
library costs by the method out
lined in Circular A-21, rather than
by special study.
Byer, Stanford's dean of
research, openly acknowledges
that Stanford's indirect costs rate
on libraries is "higher than the
(Circular A-21) default rate." But
that, he said, is due to special
studies that both Stanford and the
government have agreed to.
"We think our methodology is
correct," he said. There can be
legitimate differences of opinion
on how indirect costs are deter
mined, he said, but once that is
done, "you should live with the
outcome."
Rosse concurred. "Surely this
is a dispute that can be resolved by
an appeal to the records," he said.
"There's nothing illegal about it.
It's not as though anybody's
building swimming pools or tak
ing trips to Tahiti."
Nevertheless, Rosse said, he is
quite sure more headlines about
questionable indirect cost prac
tices at Stanford will make it into
print. The media, he said, are
often eager to damage the reputa
tions of prestigious institutions.
"Sometimes I wish we'd go back to
being a sleepy regional universi
ty," he said, chuckling.



Shortly after allegations first surfaced
that Stanford had overbilled the federal
government for indirect costs, a banner
headline ran across the front page of The
Peninsula Times Tribune:
FEDS MAY SEEK $300 MILLION
FROM STANFORD.
The Times Tribune story, like several
others that popped up in the Bay Area

News
analysis

media at the same time,
asserted that over the last
decade Stanford had repeat
edly overcharged the gov
ernment for indirect costs

incurred by researchers doing federally
sponsored work here.
The stories noted that Paul Biddle, a fed
eral regulator based at Stanford, had
accused the University of "fraud" and
"abuse," and that two federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost policies had
subsequently been launched.
The total cost of the alleged wrongdoing,
estimated at $300 million in the Times Tri
bune story — but $200 million in some
other newspapers — was attributed to a
"congressional source, who asked not to be
identified."
In the following days, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy curtly dismissed the
media account as "imaginative," even jok
ing at a Faculty Senate meeting later that
week that the Times Tribune headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to their cardi
ologists."
Quite clearly, he said, the allegations just
didn't square with the available data. Over
the last decade, Stanford has received
roughly $554 million in indirect cost recov
ery from the federal government.
The $300 million figure that circulated
represented more than half that amount,
Kennedy noted. The figure in the Times-
Tribune story had been "plucked out of the
air," he told The Daily.
While in their public assertions Kennedy
and other administrators here have

The process may not
quit until it finds some
small pound of flesh.'

adamantly argued that Stanford has noth
ing to hide, privately they express concern
that they will likely see several more nega
tive headlines in the upcoming months.
It's not that Stanford administrators are
conceding any fault on the University's
part. Rather, they have realized that the
complexities involved in calculating indi
rect costs and the political controversy this
issue has recently generated leaves Stan
ford very vulnerable to charges of wrongdo
ing.
Representatives from the General
Accounting Office, one of two federal agen
cies scrutinizing indirect cost practices at
Stanford, arrived on campus last week to
begin an investigation that is likely to take
several months.
In addition, the Office of Naval
Research, the agency that represents the
government in indirect cost negotiations
with Stanford, has launched a review of
practices here following the charges of
abuse made by Biddle, who is the ONR's
representative assigned to Stanford.
As these investigations proceed, sensi
tive policy issues will be fully exposed and
many complicated practices will be rigor
ously questioned, making it difficult for the
press and the public to untangle questions
of policy and questions of propriety.
Due to this potential for misunderstand
ing, "it's really not in our interests to have
the whole process become a public one,"
said Dean of Research Robert Byer.
Federal investigations such as those now
underway are inherently political, adminis
trators say. They tend to have winners and
losers. "This process may not quit until it
finds some small pound of flesh," said one
Stanford administrator.
Concerns about Stanford's
integrity are being voiced at the
same time many in Washington
are attacking long-standing gov
ernment indirect cost policies. As
the federal deficit has increased,
government regulators have
become increasingly alarmed
about rising indirect cost rates at
prominent research universities
nationwide.
Strained relations
At the same time, many in
academia feel the partnership
between government and univer
sities that has guided federal
research policy for decades is cur
rently crumbling.
"There no longer exists in the
Congress or the Administration a
strong, shared vision of how and
why the federal government
should support research ... in
universities," according to a
December 1988 draft of a report
by the American Association of
Universities. "As a result, the
underpinnings of the system ...
have come under increasing
attack."
At the request of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, the GAO is now
examining four universities as
part of a larger probe into federal
indirect cost policies.
While a staff member of the
House subcommittee said the
GAO has had "no given criteria"
for selecting the universities it will
investigate, the reason Stanford
was chosen is quite clear.
"Because we know of problems
with the indirect cost rates there,"
she said.
In the same conversation, the
staff member repeated the allega
tion that had appeared in the
Times Tribune and other Bay
Area media. Stanford, she said,
had overbilled the federal govern
ment by between $200 and $300
million over the last decade.
She asked not to be identified
and said her information about
Stanford came from a source "con
sidered reliable by the subcommit
tee."
Overcharging for libraries
More specifically, Stanford has
overcharged the government by
$50 million during the last decade
for use of University libraries for
research purposes, the staff mem
ber said, and offered details of how
that figure had been computed.
University administrators have
subsequently dismissed the alle
gation of library overbilling as
"way out of line" as well.
While the allegation of over
billing related to use of Stanford's
libraries represents just a fraction
of the alleged wrongdoing, a closer

look at that particular charge
highlights many of the issues cen
tral to the federal investigations.
A closer look underlines the
complex and controversial system
of indirect cost recovery that has
evolved between the government
and research universities. It illus
trates why such disparate views of
reality are being presented by the
House subcommittee staff and
Stanford officials.
In addition, examination of
library-related indirect costs
explains why Stanford adminis

trators fear that
even if Stanford
has not broken
any rules, the
University is un
likely to escape
the federal in
vestigations un
scathed.
Indirect costs
are those costs

that researchers incur that are
not easily attributable to a specific
project. If a researcher uses a
Stanford library for work on a fed
erally sponsored research project,
there is an indirect cost incurred.
The fraction of the library's
operating budget that is necessary
to support that researcher's work
is considered a legitimate indirect
cost, and Stanford can be reim
bursed by the government for that
amount.
If a graduate student assisting
that researcher uses a scientific
journal in a Stanford library for
federally sponsored research, the
corresponding fraction of the
library's operating cost, as well as
a fraction of the cost of the sub
scription price, is considered an
indirect cost of the research.
Taking such things into consid
eration, a University must project
what percentage of the operating

expenses of its libraries it believes
will be used to support research in
upcoming years. Estimates on
library and other indirect costs
must be made in ...Ivance so that
researchers seeking federal grants
know what to ask for.
At Stanford, where the indirect
cost rate is 74 percent, a
researcher who wants to conduct
$100,000 worth of research must
seek an additional $74,000 from
the government to cover indirect
costs. Stanford's rate is among the
highest in the nation.

The Defense Con
tracting Audit Agency
'has bigger fish to
catch than Stanford.'
— Robert Byer

The process of determining
what qualifies as a legitimate indi
rect cost and what does not is a
controversial one. Well-inten
tioned people often disagree over
such matters, administrators say.
A little guesswork
Computing the indirect cost
rate is not an easy task either.
Doing so involves multi-variable
mathematical formulas and com
plex computer programs. It also
involves some guesswork. "All we
can do is make our best guess and
hope we're close," said Byer, the
dean of research.
For the most part, Stanford has
guessed well. Projected indirect
costs rates have been within 2 per
cent of the rate later settled upon
by Stanford and federal auditors.
A provision called "carry-forward"
is built into the system to account
for this difference. If Stanford,

based on its projections, over
recovers or under-recovers in a
given year, the difference affects
the rate in subsequent years.
During fiscal years 1981 and
1982, for example, Stanford
under-recovered by $6.3 million.
That money was later captured by
adjusting the indirect cost rate
upward for 1987, 1988 and 1989.
Allegations of wrongdoing aside,
Provost James Rosse says the
University has in fact under
recovered by roughly $13 million
over the last decade.
Most administrators agree that
if the carry-forward process is to
function properly, the government
must perform audits promptly.
The Defense Contracting Audit
Agency is the federal agency that
audits Stanford's indirect cost
recovery.
As of last month, the only years
during the last decade that had
been audited by the DCAA were
1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. The
1984-86 reports were sent to Stan
ford in May 1990.
According to Stanford adminis
trators, auditing the University's
indirect cost recovery has been
low on the priority list of the
DCAA. The agency has been
understaffed for the last several
years and must also audit large
defense contractors that do busi
ness with the Navy, said Byer. The
DCAA "has bigger fish to catch
than Stanford," he said.

and said her information about
Stanford came from a source "con
sidered reliable by the subcommit
tee."
Overcharging for libraries
More specifically, Stanford has
overcharged the government by
$50 million during the last decade
for use of University libraries for
research purposes, the staff mem
ber said, and offered details of how
that figure had been computed.
University administrators have
subsequently dismissed the alle
gation of library overbilling as
"way out of line" as well.
While the allegation of over
billing related to use of Stanford's
libraries represents just a fraction
of the alleged wrongdoing, a closer

look at that particular charge
highlights many of the issues cen
tral to the federal investigations.
A closer look underlines the
complex and controversial system
of indirect cost recovery that has
evolved between the government
and research universities. It illus
trates why such disparate views of
reality are being presented by the
House subcommittee staff and
Stanford officials.
In addition, examination of
library-related indirect costs
explains why Stanford adminis

trators fear that
even if Stanford
has not broken
any rules, the
University is un
likely to escape
the federal in
vestigations un
scathed.
Indirect costs
are those costs

that researchers incur that are
not easily attributable to a specific
project. If a researcher uses a
Stanford library for work on a fed
erally sponsored research project,
there is an indirect cost incurred.
The fraction of the library's
operating budget that is necessary
to support that researcher's work
is considered a legitimate indirect
cost, and Stanford can be reim
bursed by the government for that
amount.
If a graduate student assisting
that researcher uses a scientific
journal in a Stanford library for
federally sponsored research, the
corresponding fraction of the
library's operating cost, as well as
a fraction of the cost of the sub
scription price, is considered an
indirect cost of the research.
Taking such things into consid
eration, a University must project
what percentage of the operating

expenses of its libraries it believes
will be used to support research in
upcoming years. Estimates on
library and other indirect costs
must be made in ...Ivance so that
researchers seeking federal grants
know what to ask for.
At Stanford, where the indirect
cost rate is 74 percent, a
researcher who wants to conduct
$100,000 worth of research must
seek an additional $74,000 from
the government to cover indirect
costs. Stanford's rate is among the
highest in the nation.

The Defense Con
tracting Audit Agency
'has bigger fish to
catch than Stanford.'
— Robert Byer

The process of determining
what qualifies as a legitimate indi
rect cost and what does not is a
controversial one. Well-inten
tioned people often disagree over
such matters, administrators say.
A little guesswork
Computing the indirect cost
rate is not an easy task either.
Doing so involves multi-variable
mathematical formulas and com
plex computer programs. It also
involves some guesswork. "All we
can do is make our best guess and
hope we're close," said Byer, the
dean of research.
For the most part, Stanford has
guessed well. Projected indirect
costs rates have been within 2 per
cent of the rate later settled upon
by Stanford and federal auditors.
A provision called "carry-forward"
is built into the system to account
for this difference. If Stanford,

based on its projections, over
recovers or under-recovers in a
given year, the difference affects
the rate in subsequent years.
During fiscal years 1981 and
1982, for example, Stanford
under-recovered by $6.3 million.
That money was later captured by
adjusting the indirect cost rate
upward for 1987, 1988 and 1989.
Allegations of wrongdoing aside,
Provost James Rosse says the
University has in fact under
recovered by roughly $13 million
over the last decade.
Most administrators agree that
if the carry-forward process is to
function properly, the government
must perform audits promptly.
The Defense Contracting Audit
Agency is the federal agency that
audits Stanford's indirect cost
recovery.
As of last month, the only years
during the last decade that had
been audited by the DCAA were
1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. The
1984-86 reports were sent to Stan
ford in May 1990.
According to Stanford adminis
trators, auditing the University's
indirect cost recovery has been
low on the priority list of the
DCAA. The agency has been
understaffed for the last several
years and must also audit large
defense contractors that do busi
ness with the Navy, said Byer. The
DCAA "has bigger fish to catch
than Stanford," he said.
Indirect cost rate guidelines
The methodology used in pro
jecting indirect costs, including
those attributed to the libraries, is
outlined in federal guidelines
titled Circular A-21.
The guidelines offer a standard
methodology for computing
library costs, but also allow insti
tutions to conduct a "special
study" to determine some aspects
of its indirect costs if the institu
tion believes it is necessary. Stan
ford has conducted several special
studies, including one with regard
to use of its libraries.
Based on the special study, a
"memoranda of understanding" is
signed by the university and the
government representative as
signed to the university. The docu
ment in effect replaces the section
of the A-21 guidelines relevant to
the study, and is generally valid
for several years.
In most areas, Circular A-21
provides a great deal of this kind
of flexibility. But that flexibility
also creates confusion.
"The system's intended flexi
bility has allowed different univer
sities to interpret and adhere to
the guidelines in a myriad of
ways," according to the report by
the Association of American Uni
versities. "The lack of clarity has
caused a great deal of friction
among Congress, sponsoring
agencies and universities."
Stanford's library study was
originally conducted in 1965. The
basic methodology of that study
was then utilized in three later
studies, the most recent going into
effect in 1984.
The terms of the 1984 study
expired in 1988, but are still used
in calculating indirect costs
attributable to the libraries,
according to Byer.
There were plans to repeat the
library study in 1989, but that
never happened, Byer said. Con
cerns Biddle raised about method
ology derailed the effort, accord
ing to Byer.
As a result, the library study
has "fallen between the cracks,"
Byer said. "It's in this state of
limbo now."
Byer said Biddle has been slow
to relate his specific concerns
about the methodology. Biddle has
been unavailable for comment.
According to University Con
troller Frank Riddle, one of the
library studies conducted in the
early 1970s was rigorously
reviewed by both the ONR and the
DCAA. The terms of the study
that resulted were the product of

tough negotia
tions between
these agencies
and Stanford rep
resentatives. "We
acquiesced on a
couple of ele
ments," Riddle
recalled.
When the
1984 study was

completed, however, the DCAA
declined to audit its results, Rid
dle said. A DCAA spokesman said
he is not at liberty to discuss
issues relevant to the ongoing
investigations.
"Statistically flawed" data
In the meantime, Stanford con
tinues to use an unaudited study
which has since expired to calcu
late its library costs.
The Oversight and Investiga
tions subcommittee staff member
who spoke to The Daily said the
library studies Stanford has used
are "statistically flawed" and "far
too generous" to Stanford.
The studies have allowed Stan
ford to charge the government
"well in excess of the A-21 guide
lines," the subcommittee staff

member said. "The government
may have overpaid by $50 million
on the library."
The alleged "overtoiling" she
referred to is the difference
between what Stanford recovered
under the terms of its special
studies and what she calls "stan
dard A-21 methodology." But, she
conceded, until Biddle stepped in,
the government had not voiced
opposition to the studies. "It's not
really fair just to blame Stanford
University," she says. "We're look
ing at all sides."
According to the subcommittee
staff member, the $50 million fig
ure comes from calculations made
by Biddle. She said her office
obtained a memo from the DCAA

backing Biddle's
overtoiling fig
ures for three
years: 1984, 1985
and 1986.
A DCAA spokes
man would neither
confirm nor deny
that such a memo
exists.

According to
the subcommittee staff member,
the DCAA supported the following
assertions made by Biddle: that
the government had overpaid
Stanford on library costs by $5
million in 1984, $5.4 million in
1985 and $5.9 million in 1986.
Using these numbers, Biddle then
made projections to include three
other years (1983, 1987 and
1988), producing an overbilling
total of around $50 million for the
period in question, she said.
A substanial fraction
The alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recov
ered on library costs. In 1985, for
example, Stanford recovered $7.1
million in indirect costs associated

'It's not as though
anybody's building
swimming pools or
taking trips to Tahiti.'

with libraries. Biddle is in effect
questioning $5.4 million of that
amount, according to the data
supplied by the subcommittee
staff member.
The allegation "doesn't seem
logical to me," said Riddle.
Stanford does recover much
more on its library than do most
universities. Figures released by
Stanford show that over the past
decade about 7 percent of Stan
ford's indirect cost rate has been
derived from library costs each
year.
Most universities have library
rates between two and four per
centage points, according to the
Association of American Universi
ties report. However, the report
notes, a small number of schools
claim higher recovery, based on

The charge of over
billing on the library

special facilities or patterns of use,
and library costs do differ signifi
cantly from university to univer
sity.
According to Riddle and other
University administrators, Stan
ford's indirect costs attributable
to the library are higher than
other universities primarily
because "Stanford spends more on
its libraries than a lot of other
institutions."
In his March 6 letter, Biddle,
the ONR representative, referred
to "flaws in the special study of
the library." He concluded that,
due in part to these alleged flaws,
the "government should scruti
nize carefully what has been
agreed to in the past before allow-

ing these agreements to bind us in
the future."
More generally, Biddle asserted
that Stanford should not be
allowed to enter into memoranda
of understanding with the govern
ment due to past abuses: "I
believe (memoranda of under
standing) should be instituted
only for those institutions which
evidence a respect for the process
(and) do not distort the intent of
government."
In a May 1989 letter from Bid
dle to Janet Sweet, Stanford's
assistant controller, Biddle wrote
that it "may well be . . . prefer
able" that Stanford compute
library costs by the method out
lined in Circular A-21, rather than
by special study.
Byer, Stanford's dean of
research, openly acknowledges
that Stanford's indirect costs rate
on libraries is "higher than the
(Circular A-21) default rate." But
that, he said, is due to special
studies that both Stanford and the
government have agreed to.
"We think our methodology is
correct," he said. There can be
legitimate differences of opinion
on how indirect costs are deter
mined, he said, but once that is
done, "you should live with the
outcome."
Rosse concurred. "Surely this
is a dispute that can be resolved by
an appeal to the records," he said.
"There's nothing illegal about it.
It's not as though anybody's
building swimming pools or tak
ing trips to Tahiti."
Nevertheless, Rosse said, he is
quite sure more headlines about
questionable indirect cost prac
tices at Stanford will make it into
print. The media, he said, are
often eager to damage the reputa
tions of prestigious institutions.
"Sometimes I wish we'd go back to
being a sleepy regional universi
ty," he said, chuckling.



Shortly after allegations first surfaced
that Stanford had overbilled the federal
government for indirect costs, a banner
headline ran across the front page of The
Peninsula Times Tribune:
FEDS MAY SEEK $300 MILLION
FROM STANFORD.
The Times Tribune story, like several
others that popped up in the Bay Area

News
analysis

media at the same time,
asserted that over the last
decade Stanford had repeat
edly overcharged the gov
ernment for indirect costs

incurred by researchers doing federally
sponsored work here.
The stories noted that Paul Biddle, a fed
eral regulator based at Stanford, had
accused the University of "fraud" and
"abuse," and that two federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost policies had
subsequently been launched.
The total cost of the alleged wrongdoing,
estimated at $300 million in the Times Tri
bune story — but $200 million in some
other newspapers — was attributed to a
"congressional source, who asked not to be
identified."
In the following days, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy curtly dismissed the
media account as "imaginative," even jok
ing at a Faculty Senate meeting later that
week that the Times Tribune headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to their cardi
ologists."
Quite clearly, he said, the allegations just
didn't square with the available data. Over
the last decade, Stanford has received
roughly $554 million in indirect cost recov
ery from the federal government.
The $300 million figure that circulated
represented more than half that amount,
Kennedy noted. The figure in the Times-
Tribune story had been "plucked out of the
air," he told The Daily.
While in their public assertions Kennedy
and other administrators here have

The process may not
quit until it finds some
small pound of flesh.'

adamantly argued that Stanford has noth
ing to hide, privately they express concern
that they will likely see several more nega
tive headlines in the upcoming months.
It's not that Stanford administrators are
conceding any fault on the University's
part. Rather, they have realized that the
complexities involved in calculating indi
rect costs and the political controversy this
issue has recently generated leaves Stan
ford very vulnerable to charges of wrongdo
ing.
Representatives from the General
Accounting Office, one of two federal agen
cies scrutinizing indirect cost practices at
Stanford, arrived on campus last week to
begin an investigation that is likely to take
several months.
In addition, the Office of Naval
Research, the agency that represents the
government in indirect cost negotiations
with Stanford, has launched a review of
practices here following the charges of
abuse made by Biddle, who is the ONR's
representative assigned to Stanford.
As these investigations proceed, sensi
tive policy issues will be fully exposed and
many complicated practices will be rigor
ously questioned, making it difficult for the
press and the public to untangle questions
of policy and questions of propriety.
Due to this potential for misunderstand
ing, "it's really not in our interests to have
the whole process become a public one,"
said Dean of Research Robert Byer.
Federal investigations such as those now
underway are inherently political, adminis
trators say. They tend to have winners and
losers. "This process may not quit until it
finds some small pound of flesh," said one
Stanford administrator.
Concerns about Stanford's
integrity are being voiced at the
same time many in Washington
are attacking long-standing gov
ernment indirect cost policies. As
the federal deficit has increased,
government regulators have
become increasingly alarmed
about rising indirect cost rates at
prominent research universities
nationwide.
Strained relations
At the same time, many in
academia feel the partnership
between government and univer
sities that has guided federal
research policy for decades is cur
rently crumbling.
"There no longer exists in the
Congress or the Administration a
strong, shared vision of how and
why the federal government
should support research ... in
universities," according to a
December 1988 draft of a report
by the American Association of
Universities. "As a result, the
underpinnings of the system ...
have come under increasing
attack."
At the request of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, the GAO is now
examining four universities as
part of a larger probe into federal
indirect cost policies.
While a staff member of the
House subcommittee said the
GAO has had "no given criteria"
for selecting the universities it will
investigate, the reason Stanford
was chosen is quite clear.
"Because we know of problems
with the indirect cost rates there,"
she said.
In the same conversation, the
staff member repeated the allega
tion that had appeared in the
Times Tribune and other Bay
Area media. Stanford, she said,
had overbilled the federal govern
ment by between $200 and $300
million over the last decade.
She asked not to be identified
and said her information about
Stanford came from a source "con
sidered reliable by the subcommit
tee."

incurred by researchers doing federally
sponsored work here.
The stories noted that Paul Biddle, a fed
eral regulator based at Stanford, had
accused the University of "fraud" and
"abuse," and that two federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost policies had
subsequently been launched.
The total cost of the alleged wrongdoing,
estimated at $300 million in the Times Tri
bune story — but $200 million in some
other newspapers — was attributed to a
"congressional source, who asked not to be
identified."
In the following days, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy curtly dismissed the
media account as "imaginative," even jok
ing at a Faculty Senate meeting later that
week that the Times Tribune headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to their cardi
ologists."
Quite clearly, he said, the allegations just
didn't square with the available data. Over
the last decade, Stanford has received
roughly $554 million in indirect cost recov
ery from the federal government.
The $300 million figure that circulated
represented more than half that amount,
Kennedy noted. The figure in the Times-
Tribune story had been "plucked out of the
air," he told The Daily.
While in their public assertions Kennedy
and other administrators here have

The process may not
quit until it finds some
small pound of flesh.'

adamantly argued that Stanford has noth
ing to hide, privately they express concern
that they will likely see several more nega
tive headlines in the upcoming months.
It's not that Stanford administrators are
conceding any fault on the University's
part. Rather, they have realized that the
complexities involved in calculating indi
rect costs and the political controversy this
issue has recently generated leaves Stan
ford very vulnerable to charges of wrongdo
ing.
Representatives from the General
Accounting Office, one of two federal agen
cies scrutinizing indirect cost practices at
Stanford, arrived on campus last week to
begin an investigation that is likely to take
several months.
In addition, the Office of Naval
Research, the agency that represents the
government in indirect cost negotiations
with Stanford, has launched a review of
practices here following the charges of
abuse made by Biddle, who is the ONR's
representative assigned to Stanford.
As these investigations proceed, sensi
tive policy issues will be fully exposed and
many complicated practices will be rigor
ously questioned, making it difficult for the
press and the public to untangle questions
of policy and questions of propriety.
Due to this potential for misunderstand
ing, "it's really not in our interests to have
the whole process become a public one,"
said Dean of Research Robert Byer.
Federal investigations such as those now
underway are inherently political, adminis
trators say. They tend to have winners and
losers. "This process may not quit until it
finds some small pound of flesh," said one
Stanford administrator.
Concerns about Stanford's
integrity are being voiced at the
same time many in Washington
are attacking long-standing gov
ernment indirect cost policies. As
the federal deficit has increased,
government regulators have
become increasingly alarmed
about rising indirect cost rates at
prominent research universities
nationwide.
Strained relations
At the same time, many in
academia feel the partnership
between government and univer
sities that has guided federal
research policy for decades is cur
rently crumbling.
"There no longer exists in the
Congress or the Administration a
strong, shared vision of how and
why the federal government
should support research ... in
universities," according to a
December 1988 draft of a report
by the American Association of
Universities. "As a result, the
underpinnings of the system ...
have come under increasing
attack."
At the request of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, the GAO is now
examining four universities as
part of a larger probe into federal
indirect cost policies.
While a staff member of the
House subcommittee said the
GAO has had "no given criteria"
for selecting the universities it will
investigate, the reason Stanford
was chosen is quite clear.
"Because we know of problems
with the indirect cost rates there,"
she said.
In the same conversation, the
staff member repeated the allega
tion that had appeared in the
Times Tribune and other Bay
Area media. Stanford, she said,
had overbilled the federal govern
ment by between $200 and $300
million over the last decade.
She asked not to be identified
and said her information about
Stanford came from a source "con
sidered reliable by the subcommit
tee."
Overcharging for libraries
More specifically, Stanford has
overcharged the government by
$50 million during the last decade
for use of University libraries for
research purposes, the staff mem
ber said, and offered details of how
that figure had been computed.
University administrators have
subsequently dismissed the alle
gation of library overbilling as
"way out of line" as well.
While the allegation of over
billing related to use of Stanford's
libraries represents just a fraction
of the alleged wrongdoing, a closer

look at that particular charge
highlights many of the issues cen
tral to the federal investigations.
A closer look underlines the
complex and controversial system
of indirect cost recovery that has
evolved between the government
and research universities. It illus
trates why such disparate views of
reality are being presented by the
House subcommittee staff and
Stanford officials.
In addition, examination of
library-related indirect costs
explains why Stanford adminis

trators fear that
even if Stanford
has not broken
any rules, the
University is un
likely to escape
the federal in
vestigations un
scathed.
Indirect costs
are those costs

that researchers incur that are
not easily attributable to a specific
project. If a researcher uses a
Stanford library for work on a fed
erally sponsored research project,
there is an indirect cost incurred.
The fraction of the library's
operating budget that is necessary
to support that researcher's work
is considered a legitimate indirect
cost, and Stanford can be reim
bursed by the government for that
amount.
If a graduate student assisting
that researcher uses a scientific
journal in a Stanford library for
federally sponsored research, the
corresponding fraction of the
library's operating cost, as well as
a fraction of the cost of the sub
scription price, is considered an
indirect cost of the research.
Taking such things into consid
eration, a University must project
what percentage of the operating

expenses of its libraries it believes
will be used to support research in
upcoming years. Estimates on
library and other indirect costs
must be made in ...Ivance so that
researchers seeking federal grants
know what to ask for.
At Stanford, where the indirect
cost rate is 74 percent, a
researcher who wants to conduct
$100,000 worth of research must
seek an additional $74,000 from
the government to cover indirect
costs. Stanford's rate is among the
highest in the nation.

The Defense Con
tracting Audit Agency
'has bigger fish to
catch than Stanford.'
— Robert Byer

The process of determining
what qualifies as a legitimate indi
rect cost and what does not is a
controversial one. Well-inten
tioned people often disagree over
such matters, administrators say.
A little guesswork
Computing the indirect cost
rate is not an easy task either.
Doing so involves multi-variable
mathematical formulas and com
plex computer programs. It also
involves some guesswork. "All we
can do is make our best guess and
hope we're close," said Byer, the
dean of research.
For the most part, Stanford has
guessed well. Projected indirect
costs rates have been within 2 per
cent of the rate later settled upon
by Stanford and federal auditors.
A provision called "carry-forward"
is built into the system to account
for this difference. If Stanford,

based on its projections, over
recovers or under-recovers in a
given year, the difference affects
the rate in subsequent years.
During fiscal years 1981 and
1982, for example, Stanford
under-recovered by $6.3 million.
That money was later captured by
adjusting the indirect cost rate
upward for 1987, 1988 and 1989.
Allegations of wrongdoing aside,
Provost James Rosse says the
University has in fact under
recovered by roughly $13 million
over the last decade.
Most administrators agree that
if the carry-forward process is to
function properly, the government
must perform audits promptly.
The Defense Contracting Audit
Agency is the federal agency that
audits Stanford's indirect cost
recovery.
As of last month, the only years
during the last decade that had
been audited by the DCAA were
1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. The
1984-86 reports were sent to Stan
ford in May 1990.
According to Stanford adminis
trators, auditing the University's
indirect cost recovery has been
low on the priority list of the
DCAA. The agency has been
understaffed for the last several
years and must also audit large
defense contractors that do busi
ness with the Navy, said Byer. The
DCAA "has bigger fish to catch
than Stanford," he said.
Indirect cost rate guidelines
The methodology used in pro
jecting indirect costs, including
those attributed to the libraries, is
outlined in federal guidelines
titled Circular A-21.
The guidelines offer a standard
methodology for computing
library costs, but also allow insti
tutions to conduct a "special
study" to determine some aspects
of its indirect costs if the institu
tion believes it is necessary. Stan
ford has conducted several special
studies, including one with regard
to use of its libraries.
Based on the special study, a
"memoranda of understanding" is
signed by the university and the
government representative as
signed to the university. The docu
ment in effect replaces the section
of the A-21 guidelines relevant to
the study, and is generally valid
for several years.
In most areas, Circular A-21
provides a great deal of this kind
of flexibility. But that flexibility
also creates confusion.
"The system's intended flexi
bility has allowed different univer
sities to interpret and adhere to
the guidelines in a myriad of
ways," according to the report by
the Association of American Uni
versities. "The lack of clarity has
caused a great deal of friction
among Congress, sponsoring
agencies and universities."
Stanford's library study was
originally conducted in 1965. The
basic methodology of that study
was then utilized in three later
studies, the most recent going into
effect in 1984.
The terms of the 1984 study
expired in 1988, but are still used
in calculating indirect costs
attributable to the libraries,
according to Byer.
There were plans to repeat the
library study in 1989, but that
never happened, Byer said. Con
cerns Biddle raised about method
ology derailed the effort, accord
ing to Byer.
As a result, the library study
has "fallen between the cracks,"
Byer said. "It's in this state of
limbo now."
Byer said Biddle has been slow
to relate his specific concerns
about the methodology. Biddle has
been unavailable for comment.
According to University Con
troller Frank Riddle, one of the
library studies conducted in the
early 1970s was rigorously
reviewed by both the ONR and the
DCAA. The terms of the study
that resulted were the product of

tough negotia
tions between
these agencies
and Stanford rep
resentatives. "We
acquiesced on a
couple of ele
ments," Riddle
recalled.
When the
1984 study was

completed, however, the DCAA
declined to audit its results, Rid
dle said. A DCAA spokesman said
he is not at liberty to discuss
issues relevant to the ongoing
investigations.
"Statistically flawed" data
In the meantime, Stanford con
tinues to use an unaudited study
which has since expired to calcu
late its library costs.
The Oversight and Investiga
tions subcommittee staff member
who spoke to The Daily said the
library studies Stanford has used
are "statistically flawed" and "far
too generous" to Stanford.
The studies have allowed Stan
ford to charge the government
"well in excess of the A-21 guide
lines," the subcommittee staff

member said. "The government
may have overpaid by $50 million
on the library."
The alleged "overtoiling" she
referred to is the difference
between what Stanford recovered
under the terms of its special
studies and what she calls "stan
dard A-21 methodology." But, she
conceded, until Biddle stepped in,
the government had not voiced
opposition to the studies. "It's not
really fair just to blame Stanford
University," she says. "We're look
ing at all sides."
According to the subcommittee
staff member, the $50 million fig
ure comes from calculations made
by Biddle. She said her office
obtained a memo from the DCAA

backing Biddle's
overtoiling fig
ures for three
years: 1984, 1985
and 1986.
A DCAA spokes
man would neither
confirm nor deny
that such a memo
exists.

According to
the subcommittee staff member,
the DCAA supported the following
assertions made by Biddle: that
the government had overpaid
Stanford on library costs by $5
million in 1984, $5.4 million in
1985 and $5.9 million in 1986.
Using these numbers, Biddle then
made projections to include three
other years (1983, 1987 and
1988), producing an overbilling
total of around $50 million for the
period in question, she said.
A substanial fraction
The alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recov
ered on library costs. In 1985, for
example, Stanford recovered $7.1
million in indirect costs associated

'It's not as though
anybody's building
swimming pools or
taking trips to Tahiti.'

with libraries. Biddle is in effect
questioning $5.4 million of that
amount, according to the data
supplied by the subcommittee
staff member.
The allegation "doesn't seem
logical to me," said Riddle.
Stanford does recover much
more on its library than do most
universities. Figures released by
Stanford show that over the past
decade about 7 percent of Stan
ford's indirect cost rate has been
derived from library costs each
year.
Most universities have library
rates between two and four per
centage points, according to the
Association of American Universi
ties report. However, the report
notes, a small number of schools
claim higher recovery, based on

The charge of over
billing on the library
'doesn't seem logical

— Frank Riddle

special facilities or patterns of use,
and library costs do differ signifi
cantly from university to univer
sity.
According to Riddle and other
University administrators, Stan
ford's indirect costs attributable
to the library are higher than
other universities primarily
because "Stanford spends more on
its libraries than a lot of other
institutions."
In his March 6 letter, Biddle,
the ONR representative, referred
to "flaws in the special study of
the library." He concluded that,
due in part to these alleged flaws,
the "government should scruti
nize carefully what has been
agreed to in the past before allow-

ing these agreements to bind us in
the future."
More generally, Biddle asserted
that Stanford should not be
allowed to enter into memoranda
of understanding with the govern
ment due to past abuses: "I
believe (memoranda of under
standing) should be instituted
only for those institutions which
evidence a respect for the process
(and) do not distort the intent of
government."
In a May 1989 letter from Bid
dle to Janet Sweet, Stanford's
assistant controller, Biddle wrote
that it "may well be . . . prefer
able" that Stanford compute
library costs by the method out
lined in Circular A-21, rather than
by special study.
Byer, Stanford's dean of
research, openly acknowledges
that Stanford's indirect costs rate
on libraries is "higher than the
(Circular A-21) default rate." But
that, he said, is due to special
studies that both Stanford and the
government have agreed to.
"We think our methodology is
correct," he said. There can be
legitimate differences of opinion
on how indirect costs are deter
mined, he said, but once that is
done, "you should live with the
outcome."
Rosse concurred. "Surely this
is a dispute that can be resolved by
an appeal to the records," he said.
"There's nothing illegal about it.
It's not as though anybody's
building swimming pools or tak
ing trips to Tahiti."
Nevertheless, Rosse said, he is
quite sure more headlines about
questionable indirect cost prac
tices at Stanford will make it into
print. The media, he said, are
often eager to damage the reputa
tions of prestigious institutions.
"Sometimes I wish we'd go back to
being a sleepy regional universi
ty," he said, chuckling.



Shortly after allegations first surfaced
that Stanford had overbilled the federal
government for indirect costs, a banner
headline ran across the front page of The
Peninsula Times Tribune:
FEDS MAY SEEK $300 MILLION
FROM STANFORD.
The Times Tribune story, like several
others that popped up in the Bay Area

media at the same time,
asserted that over the last
decade Stanford had repeat
edly overcharged the gov
ernment for indirect costs

incurred by researchers doing federally

The stories noted that Paul Biddle, a fed

1985 and $5.9 million in 1986.
Using these numbers, Biddle then
made projections to include three
other years (1983, 1987 and
1988), producing an overbilling
total of around $50 million for the
period in question, she said.
A substanial fraction
The alleged overbilling repre
sents a substantial fraction of the
total money Stanford has recov
ered on library costs. In 1985, for
example, Stanford recovered $7.1
million in indirect costs associated

with libraries. Biddle is in effect
questioning $5.4 million of that
amount, according to the data
supplied by the subcommittee
staff member.
The allegation "doesn't seem
logical to me," said Riddle.
Stanford does recover much
more on its library than do most
universities. Figures released by
Stanford show that over the past
decade about 7 percent of Stan
ford's indirect cost rate has been
derived from library costs each
year.
Most universities have library
rates between two and four per
centage points, according to the
Association of American Universi
ties report. However, the report
notes, a small number of schools
claim higher recovery, based on

special facilities or patterns of use,
and library costs do differ signifi
cantly from university to univer
sity.
According to Riddle and other
University administrators, Stan
ford's indirect costs attributable
to the library are higher than
other universities primarily
because "Stanford spends more on
its libraries than a lot of other
institutions."
In his March 6 letter, Biddle,
the ONR representative, referred
to "flaws in the special study of
the library." He concluded that,
due in part to these alleged flaws,
the "government should scruti
nize carefully what has been
agreed to in the past before allow-

ing these agreements to bind us in
the future."
More generally, Biddle asserted
that Stanford should not be
allowed to enter into memoranda
of understanding with the govern
ment due to past abuses: "I
believe (memoranda of under
standing) should be instituted
only for those institutions which
evidence a respect for the process
(and) do not distort the intent of
government."
In a May 1989 letter from Bid
dle to Janet Sweet, Stanford's
assistant controller, Biddle wrote
that it "may well be . . . prefer
able" that Stanford compute
library costs by the method out
lined in Circular A-21, rather than
by special study.
Byer, Stanford's dean of
research, openly acknowledges
that Stanford's indirect costs rate
on libraries is "higher than the
(Circular A-21) default rate." But
that, he said, is due to special
studies that both Stanford and the
government have agreed to.
"We think our methodology is
correct," he said. There can be
legitimate differences of opinion
on how indirect costs are deter
mined, he said, but once that is
done, "you should live with the
outcome."
Rosse concurred. "Surely this
is a dispute that can be resolved by
an appeal to the records," he said.
"There's nothing illegal about it.
It's not as though anybody's
building swimming pools or tak
ing trips to Tahiti."
Nevertheless, Rosse said, he is
quite sure more headlines about
questionable indirect cost prac
tices at Stanford will make it into
print. The media, he said, are
often eager to damage the reputa
tions of prestigious institutions.
"Sometimes I wish we'd go back to
being a sleepy regional universi
ty," he said, chuckling.
