# Stanford vulnerable on indirect cost issues
## Library charges illustrate larger complexities 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Shortly after allegations first surfaced
that Stanford had overbilled the federal
government for indirect costs, a banner
headline ran across the front page of The
Peninsula Times Tribune:
FEDS MAY SEEK $300 MILLION
FROM STANFORD.
The Times Tribune story, like several
others that popped up in the Bay Area

media at the same time,
asserted that over the last
decade Stanford had repeat
edly overcharged the gov
ernment for indirect costs

incurred by researchers doing federally
sponsored work here.
The stories noted that Paul Biddle, a fed
eral regulator based at Stanford, had
accused the University of "fraud" and
"abuse," and that two federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost policies had
subsequently been launched.
The total cost of the alleged wrongdoing,
estimated at $300 million in the Times Tri
bune story — but $200 million in some
other newspapers — was attributed to a
"congressional source, who asked not to be
identified."
In the following days, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy curtly dismissed the
media account as "imaginative," even jok
ing at a Faculty Senate meeting later that
week that the Times Tribune headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to their cardi
ologists."
Quite clearly, he said, the allegations just
didn't square with the available data. Over
the last decade, Stanford has received
roughly $554 million in indirect cost recov
ery from the federal government.
The $300 million figure that circulated
represented more than half that amount,
Kennedy noted. The figure in the Times-
Tribune story had been "plucked out of the
air," he told The Daily.
While in their public assertions Kennedy
and other administrators here have

The process may not
quit until it finds some
small pound of flesh.'

adamantly argued that Stanford has noth
ing to hide, privately they express concern
that they will likely see several more nega
tive headlines in the upcoming months.
It's not that Stanford administrators are
conceding any fault on the University's
part. Rather, they have realized that the
complexities involved in calculating indi
rect costs and the political controversy this
issue has recently generated leaves Stan
ford very vulnerable to charges of wrongdo
ing.
Representatives from the General
Accounting Office, one of two federal agen
cies scrutinizing indirect cost practices at
Stanford, arrived on campus last week to
begin an investigation that is likely to take
several months.
In addition, the Office of Naval
Research, the agency that represents the
government in indirect cost negotiations
with Stanford, has launched a review of
practices here following the charges of
abuse made by Biddle, who is the ONR's
representative assigned to Stanford.
As these investigations proceed, sensi
tive policy issues will be fully exposed and
many complicated practices will be rigor
ously questioned, making it difficult for the
press and the public to untangle questions
of policy and questions of propriety.
Due to this potential for misunderstand
ing, "it's really not in our interests to have
the whole process become a public one,"
said Dean of Research Robert Byer.
Federal investigations such as those now
underway are inherently political, adminis
trators say. They tend to have winners and
losers. "This process may not quit until it
finds some small pound of flesh," said one
