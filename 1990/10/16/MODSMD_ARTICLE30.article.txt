The "Late Night with David Let
terman" Book of Top Ten Lists
By David Letterman and the
"Late Night with David Letter
man" writers
Pocket Books, $8.95, 169 pages
Letterman and his cronies have
spewed out the 175 best "Top
Ten" lists into an easily holdable
and readable book. It is paperback
proof that the toilet book genre
is yet to fade away.
The lists are for the most part
hilarious, although they lack Let
terman's inimitable delivery and
style.
From the "Fears of Snuggles
the Fabric Softener Bear" to
"Amish pickup lines," from
"Brooke Shields' Best Papers
written at Princeton" to "Princess
Diana's complaints about Prince
Charles," Dave's tongue-in-cheek
irreverence is always there.
And Letterman's penchant for
the absurd is abundantly present
here, with a "surprise" photo sec
tion featuring a wide variety of
extremely random visuals.
The format that originated on
his show has now become
entrenched in popular culture. Ad
vertising and editorials, and the
ever present T-shirt, all bear tes
timony to the fact that "Top Ten"
lists is a Letterman legacy that
is likely to be here for quite some
time.
The College Student's Guide to
Transferring Schools: The Hows,
Whcns and Whys of Switching
Colleges
By Jennifer Wilcha and David
A. Smith
Avon, $9.95, 225 pages

This is a paperback that ex
amines various aspects of an ex
tremely difficult decision-making
process. It is aimed to help stu
dents and parents make that
choice.
The book deals with the process
in six distinct steps. It first asks
the student to re-evaluate the
time they have spent at their
school, looking at both the positive
and negative feelings about their
initial position at the college.
The guide then outlines various
other stages in the process, if the
decision to go through with it is
taken. Financial, social and aca
demic reasons are all discussed,
as well as the possibility of re
ceiving financial aid and transfer
credits.
It goes through the researching
of prospective choices, and the ap
plication process.
The authors also deal with the
problems a student may face in a
new environment, suggesting that
transferring is not always the best
option.
Sometimes, a year abroad may
prove to be a better alternative
by providing a student with a tem
porary break from the school.
Wilcha and Smith have exten
sive background on the subject,
as they include several comments
from interviews with transfer stu
dents. There is also the occasional
essay by a transfer student that
provides useful insights into the
validity of various reasons used
to justify transferring.
An appendix at the end of the
book provides specific transfer in
formation for about 100 colleges.
"The Guide" is a useful handbook
for students considering the pos
sibility of a second choice.
