Closer to Houston

Stanford professor Richard Fagen's
first novel is an ambitious attempt to
combine a politically charged commentary
on Central America with a Robert
Ludlum-style spy novel.
The unnamed country in which "Closer
to Houston" takes place is in the throes
of a civil war between a repressive mil
itary regime and the Marxist guerrillas
of a generic National Liberation Front.
For the most part, Fagen, a professor
of political science, adheres closely to the
formula for a popular espionage novel: a
middle-aged, worldly male protagonist; a
bold female collaborator (who inevitably
ends up in bed with the hero); clearly
delineated good guys and bad guys.
In keeping with requirements of the
genre, the main character, Charlie, is a
cynical and disillusioned, but good
hearted, employee of the Sterling Foun
dation, an American organization
dedicated to supporting development
causes worldwide, or, as it is described
sarcastically by one rebel, "the benevolent
gringos bringing science and culture to
the natives."
Michelle is an assertive journalist (in

this genre, an occupation
found only slightly less
frequently than ex-CIA
agent and slightly more
often than Russian defec
tor or fundamentalist
terrorist) with a
sympathy for the guer
rillas and a past relation
ship with Charlie.
While the book pro-

vides some important insights into the
desperate circumstances of present-day
Central America, because so much of this
short novel is spent on the requisite in
trigue and military scenarios, the char
acters are little more than stereotypical
sketches.
The author makes a feeble effort in
several places to paint the illiterate
teenage soldiers who constitute the rank
and file of the army as victims, linked
through no fault of their own to an unjust
system.
The nuns and priest who play roles in
the struggle clearly subscribe to libera
tion theology, but their beliefs and lives
are never explored. Even Charlie and Mi
chelle seem to be important more for the
roles they play than for any personal
characteristics.
"Closer to Houston" is billed as "a
novel of politics and love." Certainly
Fagen lives up to the first assertion. The

strife depicted corresponds closely to the
present situation in El Salvador but, as
he undoubtedly intends the reader to per
ceive, the basic scenario applies to most
of Central America.
Replete with CIA advisers and
virulently anti-communist army officers,
Fagen's portrait of the repressive and
arbitrarily violent military apparatus
rings true. These are, without a doubt,
the bad guys.
The good guys are the highly roman
ticized Marxist guerrilleiros. The book's
best passages occur when Charlie and
Michelle visit the insurgency movement's
base of operations in the mountains. Not
coincidentally, this is the stuff Fagen
knows best from his thirty years of schol
arly writing.
He writes of the national dynamic: im
perialist penetration, capitalist exploita
tion, popular opposition and
organization, dictatorial repression, new
levels of mass consciousness, new levels
of opposition and organization and so on.
Typical best-seller fodder this is not,
and it is disorienting, appearing as
abruptly as it does one-third of the way
through what until this point is a for
mulaic action story.
In a monologue that could be straight
out of Freire's "Pedagogy of the Op
pressed," one guerrilla leader explains
that "poverty does not by itself breed

consciousness or revolutionary senti
ments. If that were the case, half the
world would be in flames."

obviously in his element. Unfortunately,
he does not weave this powerful social
and political commentary into the fabric
of the novel.
Instead of presenting a subtext for the
action, the historical background he gives
reads like an excerpt from a textbook
and serves to interrupt the predictable
plot.
The book's prose varies greatly in
quality. The dialogue, especially between
Charlie and Michelle, is often nonde
script. Octavio, an idealized rebel leader,
provides some quiet sarcasm in addition
to inspirational revolutionary rhetoric.
Fagen provides compelling images of
the guerrilleiros and the countryside. In

one passage, he beautifully describes the
guerrilla practice of a roll call for fallen
companions.
In other instances, however, he crosses
the fine line between eloquent and over
done with phrases like "The noon still
ness was on the land."
In writing "Closer to Houston," Fagen's
self-proclaimed goal was to free himself
from"the constraints of the language of
the academic social sciences." In doing
so, he has adopted the restrictive format
of the action novel.
Though in some places he clearly ig
nores the boundaries of this formula,
Fagen does not allow himself the space
or the literary freedom to explore the
essence of the Central American crisis:
the motivations and emotions of the in
dividuals who effect change and are af

Fagen has a clear message to present.

Closer to Houston
By Richard Fagen
John Daniel, $8.95, 157 pages
Reviewed by Kecia Albright
Stanford professor Richard Fagen's
first novel is an ambitious attempt to
combine a politically charged commentary
on Central America with a Robert
Ludlum-style spy novel.
The unnamed country in which "Closer
to Houston" takes place is in the throes
of a civil war between a repressive mil
itary regime and the Marxist guerrillas
of a generic National Liberation Front.
For the most part, Fagen, a professor
of political science, adheres closely to the
formula for a popular espionage novel: a
middle-aged, worldly male protagonist; a
bold female collaborator (who inevitably
ends up in bed with the hero); clearly
delineated good guys and bad guys.
In keeping with requirements of the
genre, the main character, Charlie, is a
cynical and disillusioned, but good
hearted, employee of the Sterling Foun
dation, an American organization
dedicated to supporting development
causes worldwide, or, as it is described
sarcastically by one rebel, "the benevolent
gringos bringing science and culture to
the natives."
Michelle is an assertive journalist (in

this genre, an occupation
found only slightly less
frequently than ex-CIA
agent and slightly more
often than Russian defec
tor or fundamentalist
terrorist) with a
sympathy for the guer
rillas and a past relation
ship with Charlie.
While the book pro-

vides some important insights into the
desperate circumstances of present-day
Central America, because so much of this
short novel is spent on the requisite in
trigue and military scenarios, the char
acters are little more than stereotypical
sketches.
The author makes a feeble effort in
several places to paint the illiterate
teenage soldiers who constitute the rank
and file of the army as victims, linked
through no fault of their own to an unjust
system.
The nuns and priest who play roles in
the struggle clearly subscribe to libera
tion theology, but their beliefs and lives
are never explored. Even Charlie and Mi
chelle seem to be important more for the
roles they play than for any personal
characteristics.
"Closer to Houston" is billed as "a
novel of politics and love." Certainly
Fagen lives up to the first assertion. The

strife depicted corresponds closely to the
present situation in El Salvador but, as
he undoubtedly intends the reader to per
ceive, the basic scenario applies to most
of Central America.
Replete with CIA advisers and
virulently anti-communist army officers,
Fagen's portrait of the repressive and
arbitrarily violent military apparatus
rings true. These are, without a doubt,
the bad guys.
The good guys are the highly roman
ticized Marxist guerrilleiros. The book's
best passages occur when Charlie and
Michelle visit the insurgency movement's
base of operations in the mountains. Not
coincidentally, this is the stuff Fagen
knows best from his thirty years of schol
arly writing.
He writes of the national dynamic: im
perialist penetration, capitalist exploita
tion, popular opposition and
organization, dictatorial repression, new
levels of mass consciousness, new levels
of opposition and organization and so on.
Typical best-seller fodder this is not,
and it is disorienting, appearing as
abruptly as it does one-third of the way
through what until this point is a for
mulaic action story.
In a monologue that could be straight
out of Freire's "Pedagogy of the Op
pressed," one guerrilla leader explains
that "poverty does not by itself breed

consciousness or revolutionary senti
ments. If that were the case, half the
world would be in flames."
