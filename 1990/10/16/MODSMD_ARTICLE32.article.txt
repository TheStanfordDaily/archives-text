## Card tops No. 7 Tribe 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The Tribe of William and Mary Col
lege must not like Maloney Field too
much right about now.
After falling to UC-Santa Barbara
4-1 there Sunaay, the No. 7 Tribe met
ninth-ranked Stanford yesterday. And
while the 1-0 loss sent William and
Mary home with more unhappy
thoughts, the Cardinal women's soccer
team took another confident stride
toward its first-ever NCAA playoff ap
pearance.

"Without cutting corners, without
scholarships, with the admissions stand
ards, we have accomplished this," said
Stanford coach Berhane Andeberhan
after his team silenced the Tribe. "The
team is showing that you don't have to
cut corners — to compromise — to be
good. And we are making a lot of noise
in the soccer world."
Stanford's defense was spectacular, al
lowing no first-half shots on goal in a
hard-hitting victory. Freshman Sarah
Rafanelli headed in a second-half goal to
give Stanford the only score it needed.
One day after playing No. 6 Colorado
College to a 1-1 tie, the Cardinal turned
up its defensive intensity another notch
against a playoff-bound opponent.
"I don't know what it is, but from the
start of Sunday's game we've been com
municating a lot better and playing great
team defense," said Stanford goalie Elise
Edwards. "We were already playing well,
but this has been a dramatic change. We
are hanging in tough against tough
teams."
William and Mary (10-5) entered the
game ranked No. 7 nationally, while Stan
ford (12-2-1) was ranked No. 9, but it
was clear from the opening drives that
for an alleged underdog, Stanford had a
mean defensive bite.
"We matched up well, whereas against
Colorado College we didn't," said An
deberhan. "They were a physical team
and our team relishes playing against
physical teams. Sooner or later you'll
break them, but if you let the rough play
get to you, then they'll beat you. I thought
we played it well."
The victory puts Stanford one step

closer to the 12-team NCAA playoffs, but
the Cardinal can't be assured of anything
until after a two-game trip into America's
college soccer heartland, North Carolina.
Stanford plays at Duke Saturday and
North Carolina State Sunday, before con
cluding the regular season at home
against the University of San Francisco,
Oct. 27.
"We are right on track," said Andeber
han, whose team narrowly missed the
playoffs last year with an 11-4-3 mark.
"We improved our chances significantly
today."
William and Mary, whicK plays in the
weaker Northeast region, still is the top
team in its region and will play in the
NCAA tournament, Andeberhan said.
The Tribe, which has played in six con
secutive NCAA tournaments, lost Sunday
to the No. 5 Gauchos and was defeated
earlier by both Colorado College and
Santa Clara.
The Cardinal shut down William and
Mary's quick outside drives and
prevented high-scoring forwards Peggy
Melanson and Jennifer Tepper from op
erating near the goal. The Tribe didn't
come close to getting a shot on goal in
the first 45 minutes and managed only
five shots in the second half. Stanford
fired at goalie Kathy Carter 16 times,
but Rafanelli's head-ball was all that mat
tered.
With 19 minutes gone in the second
half, Stanford struck. Senior Denise Den
ney set the attack at midfield, laying the
ball off to freshman Glynnis Roberts on
the right flank.
Roberts was uncovered, charging from
her fullback position, and after blowing
past one defender, crossed the ball to the
near post, where Rafanelli volleyed it over
Carter and into the back of the net.
The freshman-to-freshman score was
Rafanelli's eighth goal and Roberts' third
assist of the season. Rafanelli didn't start
for the first time in 15 games, but came
in midway through the first half and
remained in the game.
"People were tired," explained An
deberhan, who substituted more than
usual due to the back-to-back games.
"Our forwards killed themselves playing
defense against Colorado College, so I
tried to keep somebody fresh all the time.
I wanted to have Rafanelli and Rocket
(Jen Rowland) up front when things
settled down."
Andeberhan's rotation paid dividends
in the second half when senior Rowland
left the game after banging her

previously-injured knee in a collision. To
be careful, Andeberhan replaced her with
Anita Koshy with 35 minutes remaining
in the game. Rowland, who just recently
replaced her brace with a less-significant
knee sleeve, said after the game she had
not re-injured the knee.
Stanford's offensive momentum almost
led to another goal just 90 seconds later.
Sophomore midfielder Julie Foudy

whipped a high 20-yard shot at goalie
Carter that she deflected with her fin
gertips before it bounced off the crossbar.
In the first half, Rowland had a one
on-one breakaway against the goalie, but
Carter knocked her shot wide to the right.
"Our offense wasn't quite as sharp
today," said Andeberhan, whose team has
been shut out only once all year. "Sunday
was the best we had played all year."

In the second half, Stanford's appar
ently impenetrable defense sprung a few
leaks and almost blew a gasket when the
Tribe missed an excellent opportunity to
score. Sophomore Jennifer Livingstone
fired point-blank at the Stanford goal
after a perfect cross from the right corner,
but the shot slipped off the outside of

Junior stopper Kerry Stivaletti led a stingy Stanford defense against William and Mary today. After Sarah Rafaneiii scored in the
second half, the Cardinal kept the seventh-ranked Tribe at bay to preserve the 1-0 wia
her foot and missed to the right.
Stanford's defense was
bolstered by the return of junior
fullback Michele Sullivan, who
had been out 10 days with a bul
ging disk, and by the start of soph

omore Leni Nonoshita.
Nonoshita started only her sec
ond game of the season, but
meshed well with the regulars and
may see more playing time.
"Leni has been playing really
well," said Andeberhan. "She has
such a positive focus and attitude,
and tactically she is one of our
smartest defenders."

Junior stopper Kerry Stivaletti led a stingy Stanford defense against William and Mary today. After Sarah Rafaneiii scored in the
second half, the Cardinal kept the seventh-ranked Tribe at bay to preserve the 1-0 wia
her foot and missed to the right.
Stanford's defense was
bolstered by the return of junior
fullback Michele Sullivan, who
had been out 10 days with a bul
ging disk, and by the start of soph

omore Leni Nonoshita.
Nonoshita started only her sec
ond game of the season, but
meshed well with the regulars and
may see more playing time.
"Leni has been playing really
well," said Andeberhan. "She has
such a positive focus and attitude,
and tactically she is one of our
smartest defenders."
The Tribe of William and Mary Col
lege must not like Maloney Field too
much right about now.
After falling to UC-Santa Barbara
4-1 there Sunaay, the No. 7 Tribe met
ninth-ranked Stanford yesterday. And
while the 1-0 loss sent William and
Mary home with more unhappy
thoughts, the Cardinal women's soccer
team took another confident stride
toward its first-ever NCAA playoff ap
pearance.

"Without cutting corners, without
scholarships, with the admissions stand
ards, we have accomplished this," said
Stanford coach Berhane Andeberhan
after his team silenced the Tribe. "The
team is showing that you don't have to
cut corners — to compromise — to be
good. And we are making a lot of noise
in the soccer world."
Stanford's defense was spectacular, al
lowing no first-half shots on goal in a
hard-hitting victory. Freshman Sarah
Rafanelli headed in a second-half goal to
give Stanford the only score it needed.
One day after playing No. 6 Colorado
College to a 1-1 tie, the Cardinal turned
up its defensive intensity another notch
against a playoff-bound opponent.
"I don't know what it is, but from the
start of Sunday's game we've been com
municating a lot better and playing great
team defense," said Stanford goalie Elise
Edwards. "We were already playing well,
but this has been a dramatic change. We
are hanging in tough against tough
teams."
William and Mary (10-5) entered the
game ranked No. 7 nationally, while Stan
ford (12-2-1) was ranked No. 9, but it
was clear from the opening drives that
for an alleged underdog, Stanford had a
mean defensive bite.
"We matched up well, whereas against
Colorado College we didn't," said An
deberhan. "They were a physical team
and our team relishes playing against
physical teams. Sooner or later you'll
break them, but if you let the rough play
get to you, then they'll beat you. I thought
we played it well."
The victory puts Stanford one step

closer to the 12-team NCAA playoffs, but
the Cardinal can't be assured of anything
until after a two-game trip into America's
college soccer heartland, North Carolina.
Stanford plays at Duke Saturday and
North Carolina State Sunday, before con
cluding the regular season at home
against the University of San Francisco,
Oct. 27.
"We are right on track," said Andeber
han, whose team narrowly missed the
playoffs last year with an 11-4-3 mark.
"We improved our chances significantly
today."
William and Mary, whicK plays in the
weaker Northeast region, still is the top
team in its region and will play in the
NCAA tournament, Andeberhan said.
The Tribe, which has played in six con
secutive NCAA tournaments, lost Sunday
to the No. 5 Gauchos and was defeated
earlier by both Colorado College and
Santa Clara.
The Cardinal shut down William and
Mary's quick outside drives and
prevented high-scoring forwards Peggy
Melanson and Jennifer Tepper from op
erating near the goal. The Tribe didn't
come close to getting a shot on goal in
the first 45 minutes and managed only
five shots in the second half. Stanford
fired at goalie Kathy Carter 16 times,
but Rafanelli's head-ball was all that mat
tered.
With 19 minutes gone in the second
half, Stanford struck. Senior Denise Den
ney set the attack at midfield, laying the
ball off to freshman Glynnis Roberts on
the right flank.
Roberts was uncovered, charging from
her fullback position, and after blowing
past one defender, crossed the ball to the
near post, where Rafanelli volleyed it over
Carter and into the back of the net.
The freshman-to-freshman score was
Rafanelli's eighth goal and Roberts' third
assist of the season. Rafanelli didn't start
for the first time in 15 games, but came
in midway through the first half and
remained in the game.
"People were tired," explained An
deberhan, who substituted more than
usual due to the back-to-back games.
"Our forwards killed themselves playing
defense against Colorado College, so I
tried to keep somebody fresh all the time.
I wanted to have Rafanelli and Rocket
(Jen Rowland) up front when things
settled down."
Andeberhan's rotation paid dividends
in the second half when senior Rowland
left the game after banging her

previously-injured knee in a collision. To
be careful, Andeberhan replaced her with
Anita Koshy with 35 minutes remaining
in the game. Rowland, who just recently
replaced her brace with a less-significant
knee sleeve, said after the game she had
not re-injured the knee.
Stanford's offensive momentum almost
led to another goal just 90 seconds later.
Sophomore midfielder Julie Foudy

whipped a high 20-yard shot at goalie
Carter that she deflected with her fin
gertips before it bounced off the crossbar.
In the first half, Rowland had a one
on-one breakaway against the goalie, but
Carter knocked her shot wide to the right.
"Our offense wasn't quite as sharp
today," said Andeberhan, whose team has
been shut out only once all year. "Sunday
was the best we had played all year."

In the second half, Stanford's appar
ently impenetrable defense sprung a few
leaks and almost blew a gasket when the
Tribe missed an excellent opportunity to
score. Sophomore Jennifer Livingstone
fired point-blank at the Stanford goal
after a perfect cross from the right corner,
