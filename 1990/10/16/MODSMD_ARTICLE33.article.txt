# There is no joy in Pittsburgh for the mighty Bucs struck out
## 
### 
Time was runnin' short
for the Pirates last Friday:
They was losin' to Cincinnati
with just one inning left to play.
Pittsburgh had got one lousy hit,
had shown neither power nor speed,
But at least the Bucs' three — count 'em! — errors
had handed the Reds a 2-1 lead.
Bobby Bonilla came to the plate
and, well, he popped straight up.
As he jogged beck to the bench, I tell ya,
I just alxjut wanted to throw up.
But whoa! Barry Bonds was put onto first
thanks to a Randy Myers ball four.
As Carmelo Martinez dug in at the plate
I felt a big finish in store.
Martinez, well, he worked the count to full
Against the so-called Nasty Boy.
And then — CRACK! — he hit a shot out t'wards
right
And Pirate fans felt a small tug of joy.
But right fielder Glen Braggs was racing back fast,
He pedaled to the track — to the wall!
He reached far above his head, and he jumped . . .
Oh, how the hell did he ever catch that ball?
The final Pirate to bat was Don Slaught,
As if he even stood a chance.
He watched two quick strikes, swung at the third —
and Cincy started to dance.
Oh, somewhere the A's and Reds are playing
For the coveted World Champeen's crown.
Somewhere there are many happy people,
For the Series is comin' to their town.
Somewhere Stewart and Welch are pitching,
Somewhere Jose and Eric still hit,
But there's no World Series in Pittsburgh
'Cuz the mighty Pirates done played like s—.
Nuff said. In fact, 1 think I'll avoid watching,
talking about, or having anything to do with
the World Series this year. After all, as a
friend told me this weekend, "It's like the Antichrist
vs. Hitler!" Or something like that.
After all, there are plenty of other sports-related
happenings around. Let's see ... hey, the Steelers
are at Candlestick next week! All right, I know,
enough with Pittsburgh already.
Here we go! Let's play a little imagination game.
Close your eyes, let your profs droning voice fade
away ...
... and imagine you're a college football coach.
You've just been hired by a Division 1 school that
has absolutely no tradition whatsoever in football.
The team was terrible last season and even worse
the year before that. Four years ago there was no
team at all.
Oh, so you love a challenge, huh? Great. The
team's all yours, Coach, and you've got our full
support. You've got fine facilities, enough financial
backing and enthusiasm from the administration.
What you don't have are scholarships. None.

Oh, stop whining. You can't have everything,
y'know. There's this little problem we're having
with budget deficits right now, Coach, so you'll just
have to make do.
Hey, how hard could it be to find a bunch of
football players willing to work their tails off for
free? Okay, maybe the notion is a little naive, but
we've got no choice. The team's all yours, pal. Have
fun!

All right, you can wake up. Doesn't sound like a
heck of a lot of fun, does it? Recruiting would be
a nightmare: You scout a player, send a coach to
meet him, call him every day for six months, send
him on a Caribbean cruise, buy him a car or two
and then, when it comes time to sign the letter of
intent, you have to tell him you can't give him any
money.
Gee, I'm sure lots of first-rate football players
would be willing to play at No-Free-Ride U. anyway,
right? Give me a break.
But consider this: What would we think of a
coach who actually managed to put a good team
together with no scholarships? How 'bout a coach
who took the team into the top 20 one season after
taking the job? A coach who got two straight national
No. 1 recruits to commit to his team, turning down
free rides from other football powers?
Let's be honest: If a football coach could pull off
any of this his school would give him a lifetime
contract worth the GNP of Central America, a huge
new house, cars, boats and a bridge or two. Alumni
would pay for his children to go to school anywhere
in the world. They'd kiss his feet, wash his car,
you name it. Name the stadium after him? Heck,
they'd rename the school.
Given, then, that the entire world would go stark
raving nuts over such a miracle worker, all I've got
is one question:
How come nobody's paying any attention to our
women's soccer team?
Consider this: Stanford didn't have a women's
soccer program in 1983. Three years later
the team was, well, going nowhere in a great
big hurry: three wins, 12 losses and a tie.
Berhane Andeberhan took over the team in 1987.
What's he done since then? Not much:
He's taken the Cardinal women, 4-11-4 in '87, to
records of 13-4-2 (No. 14 in the country!) the next
season, 11-4-3 (No. 17) in '89 and 12-2-1 (No. 9
and movin' up) so far this season;
He's signed the last two national No. 1 high-school
recruits — Julie Foudy and Sarah Rafanelli — even
though he doesn't have a single dime to give in
scholarships (perennial power North Carolina gives
