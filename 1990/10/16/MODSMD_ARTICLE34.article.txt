Despite less than impressive
conditions, the third-ranked
women'B golf team definitely got
off to an impressive start yes
terday at the Edean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational in Seattle, grabbing
the lead with a team total of
306.
Despite the 45-degree rainy
weather, everyone played
"strong and solid," according to
coach Tim Baldwin, "This is one
of the hardest courses we play
on all year.
"Today I was just hoping the
girls would learn how to play
in their rain suits," Baldwin
continued. The golfers were
bundled up in turtlenecks,
sweaters, jackets and warm
pants.
Jodi Figley also had thoughts
about the weather: "With these
conditions and this tough of a
course, anything under 80 is
great."
If that was the case, four of

Stanford's five golfers were
great. The Cardinal women
made a fantastic showing on the
par-72 course. Audrey Wooding
shot a remarkable 73, placing
first by three strokes after one
round. The poor weather con
ditions didn't daunt the Seattle
native. "Audrey played solid golf
today, she continues to improve
and really impress," said
Baldwin.
Figley is tied for second place
with a score of 76. "My key
today was to hit the fairways,"
said Figley. "There were a lot
of trees, the course was really
tight."
Adele Moore and Stephanie
Davis had scores of 78 and 79,
respectively. Freshman Melinda
Daniels scored 90 in her NCAA
golfing debut. Overall, Figley
was, "really excited about our
scores today."
The main competition for the
Cardinal is coming from Okla
homa, in second place at 310,
and host Washington, in third

at 319. "These are the best
teams Oklahoma and Washing
ton have had in years," said
Baldwin.
U.S. International University
finished yesterday's round at
fourth, Brigham Young came in
fifth, Kansas placed sixth,
Washington State finished
seventh, New Mexico placed
eighth and USC, with a presea
son No. 4 ranking, ended up in
ninth place after the first round
of this three-day tournament.
Today should be challenging
for the Cardinal. The rain is
expected to continue, making
this already difficult course
really soggy.
"You just have to disregard
[the weather! and say 'Okay,
this is the challenge,' " accord
ing to Figley.
Baldwin added, "I'm just
looking for the girls to buck up
and give it their best."
At the rate they are going,
the Cardinal women appear un
stoppable, rain or shine.
