# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Deciding on the Athletes of the Week is
always interesting. Sometimes, we haggle
and haggle before finally coming to agree
ment. Sometimes, its fairly easy.
And then there's this week. For perform
ances far above and beyond even the excep
tional standard normally set on the Farm,
Amy Cooper of the volleyball team and Jim

Talluto of the soccer team are this week's
winners.
Cooper, a 6-foot-2 junior from Aurora,
111., certainly had a week to remember. She
started it with a bang, recording 13 kills on
13 tries in a 15-3, 15-12, 15-3 victory over
California. She became only the fourth per
son ever to have a hitting percentage of
1.000 in a match with 10 or more attacks.
And, no one had ever recorded 13 kills in
a match while being perfect.
Two days later, against St. Mary's, Cooper
had 10 kills, actually made a hitting error
and was dug three times for a hitting per
centage of .571. Friday, in the final of the
Stanford Invitational, she hit .600 with 12
kills in leading the Cardinal to a 15-8, 15-10,
15-8 demolition of No. 1/No. 2 (depending
on which poll you use) Nebraska.

Talluto, a sophomore forward from
Beaverton, Ore., has been a force on the
Cardinal soccer team all season long, but
never was it more apparent, or important,
than Saturday.
At Maloney Field, Stanford met a Portland
team that was highly ranked in the West.
But the Cardinal was unintimidated, as it
has been all season.
Thirty minutes into the contest Talluto
put a ball into the net over the head of
goalkeeper Kasey Keller, moving the Cardi
nal ahead 1-0.
The Pilots, like all good teams, bounced

back, however. They equalized at the 54-
minute mark and the game eventually went
into overtime. Fullback Brandon Farley took
a throw-in during the first overtime and
Niels Bruckner touched it to Talluto.
The sophomore beat Keller again for his
second goal of the game and ninth of the
season.
