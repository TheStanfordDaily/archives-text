# Release of University internal audit expected this afternoon

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The results of an internal
audit of Stanford's indirect cost
recovery practices are expected
to be released to the public this
afternoon.
The report was completed
and delivered to University
President Kennedy a week and
a half ago. It has since circulat
ed among relevant administra
tors for their comments and
review.
Kennedy ordered the audit
in late July, after the
University first became aware
of concerns raised by Paul

Biddle, the Office of Naval
Research representative
assigned to Stanford. The ONR
is the federal agency that regu
lates Stanford's indirect cost
recovery.
In a letter addressed but
never sent to his superior,
Biddle said the negotiation pro
cess between Stanford and the
ONR had been marred by
"fraud" and "abuse."
The audit was originally
scheduled to be completed on
Sept. 28, but was delayed due
to the amount of work
involved, according to Peter
Millington, the University's
director of internal audits.
