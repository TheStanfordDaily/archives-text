# Indirect Costs: A Glossary
## 
### 
Who's Who
House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations: Chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., this subcommittee of the U.S. House
of Representatives instructed the General
Accounting Office to look into indirect cost
recovery practices at Stanford and several
other universities. A staff member of the sub
committee has said Stanford may owe the fed
eral government as much as $300 million for
past over-recovery of indirect costs. University
President Donald Kennedy has said this figure
was "plucked out of the air."
General Accounting Office: The GAO is
one of two government agencies currently
investigating indirect cost recovery practices at
Stanford and several other universities, includ
ing Harvard Medical School. The GAO review
was requested by the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations. GAO officials
arrived on campus Thursday, May 10.
Office of Naval Research: The ONR is the
federal agency that negotiates with Stanford to
determine the University's indirect cost rate.
Apparently prompted by a March 6 letter writ
ten by Paul Biddle, its campus representative
at Stanford, the ONR has begun an investiga
tion of its relationship with Stanford.
Paul Biddle: The ONR campus
representative assigned to Stanford. In a March
6 letter addressed but never sent to his supe
rior in the Navy, Biddle charged that the negoti
ations process at Stanford had been marred by
"fraud" and "abuse." The letter apparently
prompted the ONR review. Biddle arrived at
Stanford in October 1988. He has declined to
talk to the press since the allegations of wrong
doing at Stanford became public.
Defense Contracting Audit Agency: The
DCAA is the federal agency that audits Stan
ford's Indirect cost recovery. The DCAA has not
completed an audit of Stanford's indirect costs
since the early 1980s.
Frank Riddle: The University Controller Do
not confuse him with Paul Biddle, the ONR
campus representative.

What's What
Indirect costs: Those costs which are nec
essary to conduct research but are not easily
attributable to a particular research project are
considered indirect costs. These costs include
electricity, building depreciation and use of the
University library system. When researchers
obtain government grants, the University is
reimbursed for indirect costs incurred by the
research.
Indirect cost rate: The ratio of all the indi
rect costs associated with doing research at
Stanford divided by the direct costs of doing
research at Stanford. (More precisely, the indi
rect costs divided by the "total modified direct
costs.") At Stanford, the indirect cost rate is 74
percent. That means if a researcher wants to
perform $100,000 of research, $74,000 in indi
rect costs must also be requested.
Circular A-21: The federal guidelines on
indirect cost policy published by the Office of
Management and Budget. In 1947, the Office
of Naval Research, then the primary supporter
of university research, negotiated the first for
mal principles of determining applicable
research costs based on actual costs. In 1958,
these principles were revised and issued as
Bureau of the Budget Circular A-21. Between
1961 and 1983, Circular A-21 was revised eight
times.
Special study: Under Circular A-21 guide
lines, a university may conduct a special study
to determine how much it can recover in a spe
cific area, such as libraries.
Memoranda of Understanding: Following
the completion of special cost studies, a mem
oranda of understanding are signed between
the university and government to put the
agreements into place for a finite lifetime.
Carry-forward: When a university over
recovers or under-recovers for a certain period,
this amount is carried forward to affect the indi
rect cost rate in following years.

Stanford divided by the direct costs of doing
research at Stanford. (More precisely, the indi
rect costs divided by the "total modified direct
costs.") At Stanford, the indirect cost rate is 74
percent. That means if a researcher wants to
perform $100,000 of research, $74,000 in indi
rect costs must also be requested.
Circular A-21: The federal guidelines on
indirect cost policy published by the Office of
Management and Budget. In 1947, the Office
of Naval Research, then the primary supporter
of university research, negotiated the first for
mal principles of determining applicable
research costs based on actual costs. In 1958,
these principles were revised and issued as
Bureau of the Budget Circular A-21. Between
1961 and 1983, Circular A-21 was revised eight
times.
Special study: Under Circular A-21 guide
lines, a university may conduct a special study
to determine how much it can recover in a spe
cific area, such as libraries.
Memoranda of Understanding: Following
the completion of special cost studies, a mem
oranda of understanding are signed between
the university and government to put the
agreements into place for a finite lifetime.
Carry-forward: When a university over
recovers or under-recovers for a certain period,
this amount is carried forward to affect the indi
rect cost rate in following years.
