# More institutions seek domestic-partner rights
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Gay and lesbian students here
are celebrating Stanford's deci
sion last week to allow them — as
well as unmarried heterosexual
students — to live with their
lovers in University housing.
But this fall, the issue of
domestic partner benefits is a
topic of debate both in and out of
the university setting.
Other universities, San Mateo
County and the city of San Fran
cisco have implemented or are
considering policies that would
give domestic partnerships equal
status with legal marriages.
Although most policies include
heterosexual couples, the laws are
expected to affect gays and les
bians most because their relation
ships are not recognized by state
laws.

In addition to providing cam
pus housing, Stanford's policy
grants students' domestic part
ners access to University facilities
such as gyms and libraries and
gives them the option to purchase
health care at Cowell Student
Health Center.
Although it does not cover staff
and faculty, the policy places stu
dent domestic partnerships on an
equal level with marriages
in all aspects of University life.
Students who worked to get the
change implemented expect Stan
ford's decision to have a nation
wide impact.
"It is a landmark because it is
so broad," doctoral student David
Bradfute said. "I would not be
surprised to see most of the [Ivy
League schools] adopt similar
policies within six months to a
year."
"It is very possible that other
schools will see this as a chance to
adopt a similar policy," said law
student Ed Swanson.
But administrators down
played the national effect of Stan
ford's decision. "I suspect that
each place will evaluate the issue
based on its own needs, not on
what we or anybody else is doing,"
said Acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson.

The recent drive for family
housing rights by gays and les
bians has helped reshape Univer
sity policy. Yet this drive is not
unique to Stanford.
"For a lot of reasons, gays and
lesbians are really starting to go
for family rights," said Bradfute.
"The gay rights movement has
taken a new tack, and there has
been a lot of organizing around
this issue," he continued. "Peo
ple's priorities are changing."
The University of Oregon is
one institution whose policies
reflect this shift. "Family hous
ing" is available to married cou
ples with or without children, and
single parents.

And since Sept. 1, the policy
has allowed single parents to have
another adult live with them, rela
tionship and gender unspecified.
"That is the only part that
could include gay and lesbian stu
dents, but it doesn't specifically
. . . say 'gay and lesbian,' " said
Joyce Settelmeyer, a family hous
ing department employee who
assigns students to residences.
At Harvard, the situation is
slightly different, according to
Asst. Dean for Coeducation Janet
Vigiani. The University does not
offer married undergraduate
housing, and graduate student
housing is handled by Harvard
Real Estate.

The recent drive for family housing rights by
gays and lesbians has helped reshape
University policy.

A year ago, Harvard Real
Estate entered into an agreement
with the Massachusetts Commis
sion Against Discrimination not
to discriminate on the basis of
marital status.
In addition, the union of Har
vard clerical workers and support
staff has been working for health
insurance and other benefits for
domestic partners, but "to the
best of my knowledge that has not

produced any results yet," Vigiani
said.
Domestic partnership is an
issue outside the university set
ting as well.
San Mateo County recently
signed a two-year contract that
makes domestic partners of
county employees eligible for full
dental and counseling benefits.
The agreement, effective Oct. 1,
also allows employees to list

domestic partners for family sick
leave and bereavement leave.
It does not include a medical
plan, which would have added sig
nificantly to the cost of health
insurance coverage for plan-hold
ers.
Last fall, San Francisco voters
narrowly defeated Proposition FJ
which would have granted equal
rights to domestic partners. Next
month they will vote on Proposi
tion K, which would allow unmar
ried couples to register their rela
tionships with the city.
If the proposition passes, cou
ples will be able to sign a symbolic
"declaration of domestic partner
ship" that carries no legal weight.
