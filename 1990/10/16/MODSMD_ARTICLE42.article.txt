# Stove-less students cook over open fire
## 
### Tracy Clay 
Residents of the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest fear their bro
ken stove problem has been
put on the back burner by Row
Facilities, despite assurances
to the contrary that they aren't
being left out in the cold.
Since the beginning of the
academic year, residents in the
new cooperative — located in
what was formerly the Alpha
Delt house — have been with
out a properly working stove
and have been cooking their
meals over an open fire.
The stove is working, but at
such low temperatures that
cooking is impossible, accord
ing to resident Robin Jones, a
junior. Forced to find alterna
tive methods of cooking, resi
dents have been building a
small fire in an outdoor grill,
and then boiling water over the
meager flame.
The primitive cooking
arrangements have been a
hardship for the residents for
several reasons. As Forest
dweller Susanna Jech explains,
the house does not hire its own
chef. Cooking duties are
shared. Many residents have
schedules that make it difficult
to begin cooking at 2 p.m.,
when meal preparation starts.
"We just don't have the time
to wait four hours for water to
boil," said Jech. And since rice
and boiled vegetables are a
mainstay for this mostly-vege

tarian bunch, boiling water is a
daily battle.
Despite the difficulties, the
house has come through with
flying colors — and edible
meals. "The dinners have been
super. People put a lot of time
and energy into preparing the
meals. As a result, the dinners
have been very successful,"
Jones said.
Jech agreed, adding she
hopes that the situation will
finally be resolved. "We have
called the Row offices several
times and they have been very
supportive. Someone even
came out and promised us a
pool table for all our trouble,"
she said.
"Somehow, though, I got
the impression we were being
put on the back burner
because of other Row emergen
cies."
Julie Coopet of Row Facili
ties says the house has not
been forgotten by the Row
offices. "We don't want people
to think we don't know there is
a problem there. We are aware
of the situation and are work
ing on it."
According to Coopet, she
and Lynn Glick, associate
manager of student facilities,
have been working closely with
the house manager and resi
dent assistant Katherine Baer
in "exploring all of the
options" for solving the prob
lem quickly.
