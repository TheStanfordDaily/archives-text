# Game rules changed to protect IM players

In an attempt to make intramural football
more safe, a number of rules have been
changed that will protect the players, accord
ing to Intramural Director Howard Dallmar.
Dallmar said the changes made are not a
result of pressure from any person or organi
zation. "These rule changes have become a
nationwide trend over the last five to six years,
and although some schools are staying with
the older rules, we want to make the changes
that most other colleges have made," he said.
Intramural football was marred last year
by an injury to junior Greg Smith, who landed
on his neck while attempting to catch a pass.
Smith suffered a multiple cervical spine
fracture after another player fell on him. He
underwent surgery at Stanford Hospital, but
was permanently paralyzed from the neck
down as a result of the iryury.
Dallmar said at the time that Smith's

injury was a freak accident, not the result of
rough play, and that no changes would be
made in IM rules because of that one incident.
He said the accident that injured Smith could
not have been avoided by the implementation
of stricter IM rules.
This IM season, however, rule changes have
been made for IM football games. Any contact
below the waist after the ball is down is now
prohibited. This rule is designed to avoid pile
ups and possible injuries.
Also, screen blocking rules will apply when
the ball is downfield for all-male games and
everywhere on the field for all-female and coed
games. Under the new rules, it is illegal to
interfere with the movement of the player cov
ering the pass receiver.
Dallmar said the rule changes are not con
nected to Smith's injury. National IM rules are
starting to move in the direction of flag foot
ball and screen blocking, supposedly making
IM football safer. Stanford is including some
of these nationwide changes in its own rules.

Dallmar said he does not want to switch to
flag football play. "We think that flag football
is more dangerous The way in which the
players must twist and turn to grab the flag
presents a very real possibility of an ankle or
knee injury."
But IM football could someday be com
pletely flag play "We want to make the change
gradual," Dallmar explained. "If we feel we
should move to flag [football], we will. But
most players don't like it." A survey taken last
year found that 90 percent of students pre
ferred touch football.
Most colleges nationwide are switching to
screen blocking, and many schools are insti
tuting flag football for intramural play.
According to Dallmar, UCLA and UC-Berkeley
intramurals have gone completely to flag play.
Because of this change, some adjustments
may have to be made if Stanford IM teams are
pitted against other collegiate teams during
special competitions. But, Dallmar said, "the
adjustments wouldn't be a problem.
