# ASSU to offer $500 for best business idea
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
From a Chinese food delivery
service to a video store, the ASSU
is currently looking for proposals
for a "start-up project" to replace
the washed-up dry-cleaning ser
vice.
The ASSU is in the first part of
a two-phase process to solicit busi
ness ideas, according to financial
manager Torrence Boone. The
current phase, he said, involves
soliciting one-page prospectuses
from students describing their
ideas. Each prospectus, which
Boone dubbed "a brief synopsis of
an idea," for a business project is
due Dec. 3.

"We're anticipating a big
response," Boone said, noting the
ASSU plans to award $500 to the
person who submits the winning
proposal.
The ASSU Senate dissolved the
dry-cleaning service last spring
after it had been operated at a
loss.
Boone said a committee con
sisting of himself, one of the assis
tant financial managers, two sen
ators and a COP member will
choose "no more than five" of the
prospectuses to move on to the
second phase of the process.
Those proposals will be selected
by the end of the quarter.
