# ASSU to offer $500 for best business idea
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
From a Chinese food delivery
service to a video store, the ASSU
is currently looking for proposals
for a "start-up project" to replace
the washed-up dry-cleaning ser
vice.
The ASSU is in the first part of
a two-phase process to solicit busi
ness ideas, according to financial
manager Torrence Boone. The
current phase, he said, involves
soliciting one-page prospectuses
from students describing their
ideas. Each prospectus, which
Boone dubbed "a brief synopsis of
an idea," for a business project is
due Dec. 3.

"We're anticipating a big
response," Boone said, noting the
ASSU plans to award $500 to the
person who submits the winning
proposal.
The ASSU Senate dissolved the
dry-cleaning service last spring
after it had been operated at a
loss.
Boone said a committee con
sisting of himself, one of the assis
tant financial managers, two sen
ators and a COP member will
choose "no more than five" of the
prospectuses to move on to the
second phase of the process.
Those proposals will be selected
by the end of the quarter.
During the second phase, stu
dents will be asked "to submit a
much more detailed business
plan," Boone said, adding that his
office would be prepared to help
those students with their plans
and explain to them various
aspects of running an ASSU busi
ness.
After the committee selects its
favorite business idea during the
middle of Winter Quarter, it will
present the idea to the Senate,
which will vote on making it an
ASSU business.
Boone also said the person who
submits the winning proposal
may be able to run the business if
interested.
He suggested there were two
types of proposals the ASSU
would consider. One would be a
"business project start-up," which
could include a video store or a
food delivery service.
The other type of project would
be to "contract out the dry-clean
ing space or some other space in
the ASSU" to another company.
An example of this idea would be a
video store run by Blockbuster
out of the old ASSU dry-cleaning
space.

Boone said the pro
jects should be cre
ative, original types of
student services.

Mike Curry, one of the senators
on the committee, said he planned
to submit that exact type of pro
posal. He called his idea "sort of a
branch library of a video store
around here."
Curry, who is also the chair of
the senate's student activities
committee, said the costs for an
independent video store would be
prohibitive. "There would be too
many sunk costs to buy all those
videos" independently, he said.
The committee is open to a
wide variety of ideas, according to
both Curry and Boone. Boone said
proposals should be creative, orig
inal and"in line with the mission
of the ASSU â€” it has to be some
kind of student service."
Curry said profitability was
another important factor. "We will
look at how much money it will
make," he said.
He mentioned that two other
ideas he had heard students sug
gest were a yogurt bar and an
office for reviving the now
defunct ASSU course guide.
