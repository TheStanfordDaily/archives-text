# Theme house strives for 'inclusion'

Sitting at the head of the Row,
right behind the Braun Music
Eftiilding, is what junior Arcy
Hernandez calls "Stanford's lit
tle secret" — Muwekma-tah
ruk, the Native American theme
house.

Second in a five-part series on
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
The house, which is begin
ning its third year as a theme
house, has grown into a home
for Stanford's entire Native
American community, as well as
anyone else who has ventured
beyond its doors.
Resident fellows Jim and
Karen Larimore said they want
to make the house inclusive, and
many of the residents said they
can feel that sense of inclusion.
"I don't think anybody feels
left out," said junior Magda
Escobar.
An invitation to freshmen
Although the house invites all
Native American freshmen to
visit, freshmen cannot live in
Muwekma-tah-ruk. For that rea
son, "It's so much more mellow"
in Muwekma-tah-ruk than in
freshman or four-class dorms,
Escobar said.
"There's no ruckus in the
halls," Hernandez said. "It's
good for studying."
Many Native American fresh
men do frequent the house,

though, eating lunch or dinner
there or watching television in
the lounge. Some even sleep on
the couches in breaks between
classes, Escobar said.
Karen Larimore said she and
her husband welcome all the
freshmen because they want to
make the atmosphere of the
house a comfortable one for
everyone in the Native American
community.
However, resident Jonathan
Weedon said the presence of the
visiting freshmen is "kind of
annoving." But, he quickly
added, the atmosphere in the
house is still conducive to study
ing.

"It's not like it's boring,
though," Escobar noted. "It's
like a home."
The freshmen are beginning
to learn what residents have
known for a long time — "The
food is so good," said Hernandez.
Although the house is part of
University Food Service, it has
its own cook who fixes all the
dinners, including "wonderful"
desserts every night.
Good food, however, has its
drawbacks. "We're literally
crushed together in the dining
room," said junior Ray John, a
member of the Choctaw tribe.
Lunch is served for only 15 min
utes, dinner for 30.

Out of Muwekma-tah-ruk'B
30 residents, 16 are Native
American. A number of non-
Native American residents said
they were somewhat apprehen
sive about how they would fit
into the house before the year
began.
"I was a little worried at
first," said Weedon. However,
residents said their fears have
been lifted by the house's
warmth.
Junior Noel Bravo, who lived
in Casa Zapata his first two
years and was a theme associate
there last year, said that since he
is not a Native American, he is

Residents of Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native American theme house, say the house has a welcoming
atmosphere and has become a second home for Native American students who live elsewhere.
