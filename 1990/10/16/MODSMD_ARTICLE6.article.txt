# Theme house strives for 'inclusion'
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Sitting at the head of the Row,
right behind the Braun Music
Eftiilding, is what junior Arcy
Hernandez calls "Stanford's lit
tle secret" — Muwekma-tah
ruk, the Native American theme
house.

Second in a five-part series on
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
The house, which is begin
ning its third year as a theme
house, has grown into a home
for Stanford's entire Native
American community, as well as
anyone else who has ventured
beyond its doors.
Resident fellows Jim and
Karen Larimore said they want
to make the house inclusive, and
many of the residents said they
can feel that sense of inclusion.
"I don't think anybody feels
left out," said junior Magda
Escobar.
An invitation to freshmen
Although the house invites all
Native American freshmen to
visit, freshmen cannot live in
Muwekma-tah-ruk. For that rea
son, "It's so much more mellow"
in Muwekma-tah-ruk than in
freshman or four-class dorms,
Escobar said.
"There's no ruckus in the
halls," Hernandez said. "It's
good for studying."
Many Native American fresh
men do frequent the house,

though, eating lunch or dinner
there or watching television in
the lounge. Some even sleep on
the couches in breaks between
classes, Escobar said.
Karen Larimore said she and
her husband welcome all the
freshmen because they want to
make the atmosphere of the
house a comfortable one for
everyone in the Native American
community.
However, resident Jonathan
Weedon said the presence of the
visiting freshmen is "kind of
annoving." But, he quickly
added, the atmosphere in the
house is still conducive to study
ing.

"It's not like it's boring,
though," Escobar noted. "It's
like a home."
The freshmen are beginning
to learn what residents have
known for a long time — "The
food is so good," said Hernandez.
Although the house is part of
University Food Service, it has
its own cook who fixes all the
dinners, including "wonderful"
desserts every night.
Good food, however, has its
drawbacks. "We're literally
crushed together in the dining
room," said junior Ray John, a
member of the Choctaw tribe.
Lunch is served for only 15 min
utes, dinner for 30.

Out of Muwekma-tah-ruk'B
30 residents, 16 are Native
American. A number of non-
Native American residents said
they were somewhat apprehen
sive about how they would fit
into the house before the year
began.
"I was a little worried at
first," said Weedon. However,
residents said their fears have
been lifted by the house's
warmth.
Junior Noel Bravo, who lived
in Casa Zapata his first two
years and was a theme associate
there last year, said that since he
is not a Native American, he is

Residents of Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native American theme house, say the house has a welcoming
atmosphere and has become a second home for Native American students who live elsewhere.
"interested, but not as excited" as
he was in Zapata, where Chicanos
and Latinos are the focus. "But I
don't feel excluded," he said.
Bravo's favorite part of life at
Muwekma-tah-ruk is that it's not
as socially active as Zapata. "I can
do my own thing," he said, "hang
out with everyone or be by
myself."
According to Escobar, many
people decide to live in Muwekma
tah-ruk because they have friends
who lived there the year before.
Others have more practical rea
sons. Weedon's motives for com
ing to Muwekma-tah-ruk were
being on the Row and being close
to the center of campus. However,
he said, he's enjoyed learning
about Native American culture.
Weedon said he enjoys the
theme because it "gives people a
reason for living together,"
whereas other houses are often
just filled with random people
through the luck of the Draw.
Giselle Perez de la Garza was
intrigued by the atmosphere she
sensed in visits to the house last
year.
But, she said, noting the circles
of friends many upperclassmen
already have, "It's been a little
harder than I thought it would be
to get to know people. People
aren't diving into [friendships]."
Sophomore Tammie Edwards
agreed. "Here, you've got to make
an effort to get to know people
well," she said.
Some non-Native American
students said they feel a little left
out because many of the Native
Americans already know each
other from Stanford's three-week
American Indian Summer Insti
tute Program.
Still, Perez de la Garza added,
"I don't feel alienated. I feel like
it's home.
"It beats Flo Mo," she laughed.
"Because this is actually a
house, you feel like you're actually
coming home" at the end of the
day, Edwards said. She decided to
live in Muwekma-tah-ruk when
she "walked by and it looked like
my house at home. It's the stair
case that did it," she said, smiling.
Muwekma-tah-ruk is also like
her house back home, she said,
because she leaves the house to
"party" and then comes back to
the house to study. "I think my
GPA's gonna be really psyched,"
she said.
A brief history
Karen Larimore is a junior in
sociology at Santa Clara Univer

sity. "I started a little late," she
laughed.
She said her husband, an asso
ciate dean of student affairs and
director of the Native American
Cultural Center, was involved in
the theme house proposal in 1987.
When the house was approved,
the Larimores, both Native Amer
icans, were the first choice to be
RFs for what was then known as
Lathrop.
In the beginning of 1987 — the
house's transitional year, before it
officially became a theme house —
a Sioux medicine man came to
bless the house.
Last year, Lathrop's first full
year as the official theme house,
residents and members of Stan
ford's Native American commu
nity decided to rename the house
in the language of the Ohlone
Indians, who lived for 5,000 years
on what is now Stanford land.
In a ceremony this spring, the
house was renamed Muwekma
tah-ruk, which means "The House
of the People."
Many people who don't live in
the house have a difficult time
saying the new name, which is
pronounced "Moo-WAYK-muh tah
rook." Many people call the house
"Muwekma," while others still
refer to it as Lathrop.
So far, the Ohlone name has
not been subjected to the abbrevi
ated fate of many campus building
names such as "Hoo Tow" or
"Mem Chu" — no one has called
the house "Mu-Ta-Ru."
A variety of programs
The recent nine-day celebra
tion of the Stanford American
Indian Organization's 20th
anniversary kept residents busy
with a flood of speeches and pro
grams.
During the rest of the year,
however, the cultural emphasis
continues. All Muwekma-tah-ruk
residents are required to coordi
nate a theme project related to the
Native American experience. Lari
more said the residents will soon
meet to coordinate common
theme projects.
Theme associate Nicole Stern,
a junior, said the two theme asso
ciates and the one resident assis
tant "are spending a lot of time
helping [the residents! organize
their own projects."
Edwards, who is black but also
part Cherokee, Seminole, Chicka
saw and Comanche, said she plans
to create a program about the
"parallel, hidden history" of racial
intermixing between African-
Americans and Native Americans.
Bravo said he wants to set up a
program examining Native Amer
ican politics and public policy,
especially at the reservations.
Many of the residents are col

laborating on a two-week spring
break trip to an Indian reserva
tion. Last year, many Muwekma
tah-ruk and Zapata residents
spent two weeks at a Havasupai
reservation in Arizona.
Other project ideas focus upon
traditional Native American
methods of healing, the influence
of food and dance on Native Amer
ican culture, pottery-making and
a backpacking trip to learn about
edible plants and Native American
outdoors techniques.
Another regular program is
the house's Tuesday Night Films,
which are open to the public and
feature movies from the Native
American Film Festival in San
Francisco.

Many residents agreed that the most memo
rable house bonding experience was the
'Great Circle,' a Native American tradition in
which members share their feelings.

Outside of structured pro
grams, residents have also had
some valuable "bonding" exer
cises. Many residents agreed that
the most memorable house bond
ing experience was the "Great Cir
cle," a Native American tradition.
In the ceremony, the residents
and the RFs hold hands in a large
circle, and the people in the circle
pass around a small "stone of the
earth." They take the stone with
their left hand — since it is the
one closest to their heart — and
pass it with the right hand —
since it is closest to the heart of
the next person.
Whoever has the stone has the
right to talk as long as they want.
No one can interrupt the speaker,
and no one can leave or enter the
"sacred" circle until everyone has
spoken.
Larimore said the house sat in
the Great Circle at the end of last
year, when the residents discussed
their feelings about their experi
ence in the house. This year, the
circle was part of a four-hour ori
entation workshop for the resi
dents, in which they brought forth
their goals for the house.
Getting in
One of the biggest goals for the
RFs, Larimore said, is to "need
and get a bigger house." The 1990
Draw cutoff number was quite low
for women — 544 — while for men
it was 2216.
Ethnic priorities for the house
are given to students with Native
American heritage, and regular
priorities are given to people who
present theme project proposals to
the RFs.
During the 1987-88 year, when
the house was in a transitional
period and was not yet the official
theme house, Larimore said many
people were assigned to the house
who did not care about the theme.
"Last year was the turning
point," she said. People seeking

priorities in the 1989 Draw num
bered 300 — four times the
amount in the 1988 Draw. This
year's Draw showed similar fig
ures.
"Everyone who got in
expressed an interest in the
theme," Larimore said.
She said she and Jim want to
interact with — and not just learn
the names of — as many residents
as possible this year.
A cozy setting
Residents live in a mixture of
singles, doubles and triples on the
second and third floors. Only 30
students live in Muwekma-tah
ruk, the smallest of the Row

houses. Most of the residents say
the small size is one of the biggest
advantages to life there.
Roommates David Parra and
lain Lamb, sophomores who both
lived in Florence Moore Hall last
year, agreed.
"I like the small house a lot
more," said Parra. "People are
more responsible for their
actions" in a small house than a
larger dorm, Lamb added. He also
noted that people in Muwekma
tah-ruk are very helpful.
Hernandez agreed. "People
around here look out for each
other," she said.
The house, which is approxi
mately 70 years old, has three
floors, two lounges, a study lounge
with two Macintoshes and a twist
ing maze of halls, balconies and
tiny getaways. Native American
paintings and prints line the
walls.
A sand volleyball court sits
right next to the house. Room
mates Bravo and John said the
house will start using the court as
soon as it cleans out the mess left
by cats who thought the court was
a huge litter box.
Some of the most attractive
features of the house are the bal
conies. Residents take full advan
tage of them, setting out lines of
clothes to dry, studying, eating,
sleeping (Parra and Lamb have a
hammock in their balcony) or just
sitting on them and thinking.
Sitting on a balcony, just as the
sun has almost sunk beneath the
horizon and the trees glow with
the light of dusk, one gets a sense
of traditional Native American
philosophy emphasizing the
beauty of nature and the slow pas
sage of time.
And throughout Muwekma
tah-ruk, residents said they also
get a sense of another foundation
of Native American life — the
family.
Sitting at the head of the Row,
right behind the Braun Music
Eftiilding, is what junior Arcy
Hernandez calls "Stanford's lit
tle secret" — Muwekma-tah
ruk, the Native American theme
house.

Muwekma-tah-ruk is also like
her house back home, she said,
because she leaves the house to
"party" and then comes back to
the house to study. "I think my
GPA's gonna be really psyched,"
she said.
A brief history
Karen Larimore is a junior in
sociology at Santa Clara Univer

sity. "I started a little late," she
laughed.
She said her husband, an asso
ciate dean of student affairs and
director of the Native American
Cultural Center, was involved in
the theme house proposal in 1987.
When the house was approved,
the Larimores, both Native Amer
icans, were the first choice to be
RFs for what was then known as
Lathrop.
In the beginning of 1987 — the
house's transitional year, before it
officially became a theme house —
a Sioux medicine man came to
bless the house.
Last year, Lathrop's first full
year as the official theme house,
residents and members of Stan
ford's Native American commu
nity decided to rename the house
in the language of the Ohlone
Indians, who lived for 5,000 years
on what is now Stanford land.
In a ceremony this spring, the
house was renamed Muwekma
tah-ruk, which means "The House
of the People."
Many people who don't live in
the house have a difficult time
saying the new name, which is
pronounced "Moo-WAYK-muh tah
rook." Many people call the house
"Muwekma," while others still
refer to it as Lathrop.
So far, the Ohlone name has
not been subjected to the abbrevi
ated fate of many campus building
names such as "Hoo Tow" or
"Mem Chu" — no one has called
the house "Mu-Ta-Ru."
A variety of programs
The recent nine-day celebra
tion of the Stanford American
Indian Organization's 20th
anniversary kept residents busy
with a flood of speeches and pro
grams.
During the rest of the year,
however, the cultural emphasis
continues. All Muwekma-tah-ruk
residents are required to coordi
nate a theme project related to the
Native American experience. Lari
more said the residents will soon
meet to coordinate common
theme projects.
Theme associate Nicole Stern,
a junior, said the two theme asso
ciates and the one resident assis
tant "are spending a lot of time
helping [the residents! organize
their own projects."
Edwards, who is black but also
part Cherokee, Seminole, Chicka
saw and Comanche, said she plans
to create a program about the
"parallel, hidden history" of racial
intermixing between African-
Americans and Native Americans.
Bravo said he wants to set up a
program examining Native Amer
ican politics and public policy,
especially at the reservations.
Many of the residents are col

laborating on a two-week spring
break trip to an Indian reserva
tion. Last year, many Muwekma
tah-ruk and Zapata residents
spent two weeks at a Havasupai
reservation in Arizona.
Other project ideas focus upon
traditional Native American
methods of healing, the influence
of food and dance on Native Amer
ican culture, pottery-making and
a backpacking trip to learn about
edible plants and Native American
outdoors techniques.
Another regular program is
the house's Tuesday Night Films,
which are open to the public and
feature movies from the Native
American Film Festival in San
Francisco.

Many residents agreed that the most memo
rable house bonding experience was the
'Great Circle,' a Native American tradition in
which members share their feelings.

Outside of structured pro
grams, residents have also had
some valuable "bonding" exer
cises. Many residents agreed that
the most memorable house bond
ing experience was the "Great Cir
cle," a Native American tradition.
In the ceremony, the residents
and the RFs hold hands in a large
circle, and the people in the circle
pass around a small "stone of the
earth." They take the stone with
their left hand — since it is the
one closest to their heart — and
pass it with the right hand —
since it is closest to the heart of
the next person.
Whoever has the stone has the
right to talk as long as they want.
No one can interrupt the speaker,
and no one can leave or enter the
"sacred" circle until everyone has
spoken.
Larimore said the house sat in
the Great Circle at the end of last
year, when the residents discussed
their feelings about their experi
ence in the house. This year, the
circle was part of a four-hour ori
entation workshop for the resi
dents, in which they brought forth
their goals for the house.
Getting in
One of the biggest goals for the
RFs, Larimore said, is to "need
and get a bigger house." The 1990
Draw cutoff number was quite low
for women — 544 — while for men
it was 2216.
Ethnic priorities for the house
are given to students with Native
American heritage, and regular
priorities are given to people who
present theme project proposals to
the RFs.
During the 1987-88 year, when
the house was in a transitional
period and was not yet the official
theme house, Larimore said many
people were assigned to the house
who did not care about the theme.
"Last year was the turning
point," she said. People seeking

priorities in the 1989 Draw num
bered 300 — four times the
amount in the 1988 Draw. This
year's Draw showed similar fig
ures.
"Everyone who got in
expressed an interest in the
theme," Larimore said.
She said she and Jim want to
interact with — and not just learn
the names of — as many residents
as possible this year.
A cozy setting
Residents live in a mixture of
singles, doubles and triples on the
second and third floors. Only 30
students live in Muwekma-tah
ruk, the smallest of the Row

houses. Most of the residents say
the small size is one of the biggest
advantages to life there.
Roommates David Parra and
lain Lamb, sophomores who both
lived in Florence Moore Hall last
year, agreed.
"I like the small house a lot
more," said Parra. "People are
more responsible for their
actions" in a small house than a
larger dorm, Lamb added. He also
noted that people in Muwekma
tah-ruk are very helpful.
Hernandez agreed. "People
around here look out for each
other," she said.
The house, which is approxi
mately 70 years old, has three
floors, two lounges, a study lounge
with two Macintoshes and a twist
ing maze of halls, balconies and
tiny getaways. Native American
paintings and prints line the
walls.
A sand volleyball court sits
right next to the house. Room
mates Bravo and John said the
house will start using the court as
soon as it cleans out the mess left
by cats who thought the court was
a huge litter box.
Some of the most attractive
features of the house are the bal
conies. Residents take full advan
tage of them, setting out lines of
clothes to dry, studying, eating,
sleeping (Parra and Lamb have a
hammock in their balcony) or just
sitting on them and thinking.
Sitting on a balcony, just as the
sun has almost sunk beneath the
horizon and the trees glow with
the light of dusk, one gets a sense
of traditional Native American
philosophy emphasizing the
beauty of nature and the slow pas
sage of time.
And throughout Muwekma
tah-ruk, residents said they also
get a sense of another foundation
of Native American life — the
family.
Sitting at the head of the Row,
right behind the Braun Music
Eftiilding, is what junior Arcy
Hernandez calls "Stanford's lit
tle secret" — Muwekma-tah
ruk, the Native American theme
house.

Second in a five-part series on
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
The house, which is begin
ning its third year as a theme
house, has grown into a home
for Stanford's entire Native
American community, as well as
anyone else who has ventured
beyond its doors.
Resident fellows Jim and
Karen Larimore said they want
to make the house inclusive, and
many of the residents said they
can feel that sense of inclusion.
"I don't think anybody feels
left out," said junior Magda
Escobar.
An invitation to freshmen
Although the house invites all
Native American freshmen to
visit, freshmen cannot live in
Muwekma-tah-ruk. For that rea
son, "It's so much more mellow"
in Muwekma-tah-ruk than in
freshman or four-class dorms,
Escobar said.
"There's no ruckus in the
halls," Hernandez said. "It's
good for studying."
Many Native American fresh
men do frequent the house,

though, eating lunch or dinner
there or watching television in
the lounge. Some even sleep on
the couches in breaks between
classes, Escobar said.
Karen Larimore said she and
her husband welcome all the
freshmen because they want to
make the atmosphere of the
house a comfortable one for
everyone in the Native American
community.
However, resident Jonathan
Weedon said the presence of the
visiting freshmen is "kind of
annoving." But, he quickly
added, the atmosphere in the
house is still conducive to study
ing.

"It's not like it's boring,
though," Escobar noted. "It's
like a home."
The freshmen are beginning
to learn what residents have
known for a long time — "The
food is so good," said Hernandez.
Although the house is part of
University Food Service, it has
its own cook who fixes all the
dinners, including "wonderful"
desserts every night.
Good food, however, has its
drawbacks. "We're literally
crushed together in the dining
room," said junior Ray John, a
member of the Choctaw tribe.
Lunch is served for only 15 min
utes, dinner for 30.

Out of Muwekma-tah-ruk'B
30 residents, 16 are Native
American. A number of non-
Native American residents said
they were somewhat apprehen
sive about how they would fit
into the house before the year
began.
"I was a little worried at
first," said Weedon. However,
residents said their fears have
been lifted by the house's
warmth.
Junior Noel Bravo, who lived
in Casa Zapata his first two
years and was a theme associate
there last year, said that since he
is not a Native American, he is

Residents of Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native American theme house, say the house has a welcoming
atmosphere and has become a second home for Native American students who live elsewhere.
"interested, but not as excited" as
he was in Zapata, where Chicanos
and Latinos are the focus. "But I
don't feel excluded," he said.
Bravo's favorite part of life at
Muwekma-tah-ruk is that it's not
as socially active as Zapata. "I can
do my own thing," he said, "hang
out with everyone or be by
myself."
According to Escobar, many
people decide to live in Muwekma
tah-ruk because they have friends
who lived there the year before.
Others have more practical rea
sons. Weedon's motives for com
ing to Muwekma-tah-ruk were
being on the Row and being close
to the center of campus. However,
he said, he's enjoyed learning
about Native American culture.
Weedon said he enjoys the
theme because it "gives people a
reason for living together,"
whereas other houses are often
just filled with random people
through the luck of the Draw.
Giselle Perez de la Garza was
intrigued by the atmosphere she
sensed in visits to the house last
year.
But, she said, noting the circles
of friends many upperclassmen
already have, "It's been a little
harder than I thought it would be
to get to know people. People
aren't diving into [friendships]."
Sophomore Tammie Edwards
agreed. "Here, you've got to make
an effort to get to know people
well," she said.
Some non-Native American
students said they feel a little left
out because many of the Native
Americans already know each
other from Stanford's three-week
American Indian Summer Insti
tute Program.
Still, Perez de la Garza added,
"I don't feel alienated. I feel like
it's home.
"It beats Flo Mo," she laughed.
"Because this is actually a
house, you feel like you're actually
coming home" at the end of the
day, Edwards said. She decided to
live in Muwekma-tah-ruk when
she "walked by and it looked like
my house at home. It's the stair
case that did it," she said, smiling.
Muwekma-tah-ruk is also like
her house back home, she said,
because she leaves the house to
"party" and then comes back to
the house to study. "I think my
GPA's gonna be really psyched,"
she said.

theme house, Larimore said many
people were assigned to the house
who did not care about the theme.
"Last year was the turning
point," she said. People seeking

priorities in the 1989 Draw num
bered 300 — four times the
amount in the 1988 Draw. This
year's Draw showed similar fig
ures.
"Everyone who got in
expressed an interest in the
theme," Larimore said.
She said she and Jim want to
interact with — and not just learn
the names of — as many residents
as possible this year.
A cozy setting
Residents live in a mixture of
singles, doubles and triples on the
second and third floors. Only 30
students live in Muwekma-tah
ruk, the smallest of the Row

houses. Most of the residents say
the small size is one of the biggest
advantages to life there.
Roommates David Parra and
lain Lamb, sophomores who both
lived in Florence Moore Hall last
year, agreed.
"I like the small house a lot
more," said Parra. "People are
more responsible for their
actions" in a small house than a
larger dorm, Lamb added. He also
noted that people in Muwekma
tah-ruk are very helpful.
Hernandez agreed. "People
around here look out for each
other," she said.
The house, which is approxi
mately 70 years old, has three
floors, two lounges, a study lounge
with two Macintoshes and a twist
ing maze of halls, balconies and
tiny getaways. Native American
paintings and prints line the
walls.
A sand volleyball court sits
right next to the house. Room
mates Bravo and John said the
house will start using the court as
soon as it cleans out the mess left
by cats who thought the court was
a huge litter box.
Some of the most attractive
features of the house are the bal
conies. Residents take full advan
tage of them, setting out lines of
clothes to dry, studying, eating,
sleeping (Parra and Lamb have a
hammock in their balcony) or just
sitting on them and thinking.
Sitting on a balcony, just as the
sun has almost sunk beneath the
horizon and the trees glow with
the light of dusk, one gets a sense
of traditional Native American
philosophy emphasizing the
beauty of nature and the slow pas
sage of time.
And throughout Muwekma
tah-ruk, residents said they also
get a sense of another foundation
of Native American life — the
family.
Sitting at the head of the Row,
right behind the Braun Music
Eftiilding, is what junior Arcy
Hernandez calls "Stanford's lit
tle secret" — Muwekma-tah
ruk, the Native American theme
house.

Second in a five-part series on
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
The house, which is begin
ning its third year as a theme
house, has grown into a home
for Stanford's entire Native
American community, as well as
anyone else who has ventured
beyond its doors.
Resident fellows Jim and
Karen Larimore said they want
to make the house inclusive, and
many of the residents said they
can feel that sense of inclusion.
"I don't think anybody feels
left out," said junior Magda
Escobar.
An invitation to freshmen
Although the house invites all
Native American freshmen to
visit, freshmen cannot live in
Muwekma-tah-ruk. For that rea
son, "It's so much more mellow"
in Muwekma-tah-ruk than in
freshman or four-class dorms,
Escobar said.
"There's no ruckus in the
halls," Hernandez said. "It's
good for studying."
Many Native American fresh
men do frequent the house,

though, eating lunch or dinner
there or watching television in
the lounge. Some even sleep on
the couches in breaks between
classes, Escobar said.
Karen Larimore said she and
her husband welcome all the
freshmen because they want to
make the atmosphere of the
house a comfortable one for
everyone in the Native American
community.
However, resident Jonathan
Weedon said the presence of the
visiting freshmen is "kind of
annoving." But, he quickly
added, the atmosphere in the
house is still conducive to study
ing.

"It's not like it's boring,
though," Escobar noted. "It's
like a home."
The freshmen are beginning
to learn what residents have
known for a long time — "The
food is so good," said Hernandez.
Although the house is part of
University Food Service, it has
its own cook who fixes all the
dinners, including "wonderful"
desserts every night.
Good food, however, has its
drawbacks. "We're literally
crushed together in the dining
room," said junior Ray John, a
member of the Choctaw tribe.
Lunch is served for only 15 min
utes, dinner for 30.

Out of Muwekma-tah-ruk'B
30 residents, 16 are Native
American. A number of non-
Native American residents said
they were somewhat apprehen
sive about how they would fit
into the house before the year
began.
"I was a little worried at
first," said Weedon. However,
residents said their fears have
been lifted by the house's
warmth.
Junior Noel Bravo, who lived
in Casa Zapata his first two
years and was a theme associate
there last year, said that since he
is not a Native American, he is

Residents of Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native American theme house, say the house has a welcoming
atmosphere and has become a second home for Native American students who live elsewhere.
"interested, but not as excited" as
he was in Zapata, where Chicanos
and Latinos are the focus. "But I
don't feel excluded," he said.
Bravo's favorite part of life at
Muwekma-tah-ruk is that it's not
as socially active as Zapata. "I can
do my own thing," he said, "hang
out with everyone or be by
myself."
According to Escobar, many
people decide to live in Muwekma
tah-ruk because they have friends
who lived there the year before.
Others have more practical rea
sons. Weedon's motives for com
ing to Muwekma-tah-ruk were
being on the Row and being close
to the center of campus. However,
he said, he's enjoyed learning
about Native American culture.
Weedon said he enjoys the
theme because it "gives people a
reason for living together,"
whereas other houses are often
just filled with random people
through the luck of the Draw.
Giselle Perez de la Garza was
intrigued by the atmosphere she
sensed in visits to the house last
year.
But, she said, noting the circles
of friends many upperclassmen
already have, "It's been a little
harder than I thought it would be
to get to know people. People
aren't diving into [friendships]."
Sophomore Tammie Edwards
agreed. "Here, you've got to make
an effort to get to know people
well," she said.
Some non-Native American
students said they feel a little left
out because many of the Native
Americans already know each
other from Stanford's three-week
American Indian Summer Insti
tute Program.
Still, Perez de la Garza added,
"I don't feel alienated. I feel like
it's home.
"It beats Flo Mo," she laughed.
"Because this is actually a
house, you feel like you're actually
coming home" at the end of the
day, Edwards said. She decided to
live in Muwekma-tah-ruk when
she "walked by and it looked like
my house at home. It's the stair
case that did it," she said, smiling.
Muwekma-tah-ruk is also like
her house back home, she said,
because she leaves the house to
"party" and then comes back to
the house to study. "I think my
GPA's gonna be really psyched,"
she said.
A brief history
Karen Larimore is a junior in
sociology at Santa Clara Univer

sity. "I started a little late," she
laughed.
She said her husband, an asso
ciate dean of student affairs and
director of the Native American
Cultural Center, was involved in
the theme house proposal in 1987.
When the house was approved,
the Larimores, both Native Amer
icans, were the first choice to be
RFs for what was then known as
Lathrop.
In the beginning of 1987 — the
house's transitional year, before it
officially became a theme house —
a Sioux medicine man came to
bless the house.
Last year, Lathrop's first full
year as the official theme house,
residents and members of Stan
ford's Native American commu
nity decided to rename the house
in the language of the Ohlone
Indians, who lived for 5,000 years
on what is now Stanford land.
In a ceremony this spring, the
house was renamed Muwekma
tah-ruk, which means "The House
of the People."
Many people who don't live in
the house have a difficult time
saying the new name, which is
pronounced "Moo-WAYK-muh tah
rook." Many people call the house
"Muwekma," while others still
refer to it as Lathrop.
So far, the Ohlone name has
not been subjected to the abbrevi
ated fate of many campus building
names such as "Hoo Tow" or
"Mem Chu" — no one has called
the house "Mu-Ta-Ru."
A variety of programs
The recent nine-day celebra
tion of the Stanford American
Indian Organization's 20th
anniversary kept residents busy
with a flood of speeches and pro
grams.
During the rest of the year,
however, the cultural emphasis
continues. All Muwekma-tah-ruk
residents are required to coordi
nate a theme project related to the
Native American experience. Lari
more said the residents will soon
meet to coordinate common
theme projects.
Theme associate Nicole Stern,
a junior, said the two theme asso
ciates and the one resident assis
tant "are spending a lot of time
helping [the residents! organize
their own projects."
Edwards, who is black but also
part Cherokee, Seminole, Chicka
saw and Comanche, said she plans
to create a program about the
"parallel, hidden history" of racial
intermixing between African-
Americans and Native Americans.
Bravo said he wants to set up a
program examining Native Amer
ican politics and public policy,
especially at the reservations.
Many of the residents are col

laborating on a two-week spring
break trip to an Indian reserva
tion. Last year, many Muwekma
tah-ruk and Zapata residents
spent two weeks at a Havasupai
reservation in Arizona.
Other project ideas focus upon
traditional Native American
methods of healing, the influence
of food and dance on Native Amer
ican culture, pottery-making and
a backpacking trip to learn about
edible plants and Native American
outdoors techniques.
Another regular program is
the house's Tuesday Night Films,
which are open to the public and
feature movies from the Native
American Film Festival in San
Francisco.

Many residents agreed that the most memo
rable house bonding experience was the
'Great Circle,' a Native American tradition in
which members share their feelings.

Outside of structured pro
grams, residents have also had
some valuable "bonding" exer
cises. Many residents agreed that
the most memorable house bond
ing experience was the "Great Cir
cle," a Native American tradition.
In the ceremony, the residents
and the RFs hold hands in a large
circle, and the people in the circle
pass around a small "stone of the
earth." They take the stone with
their left hand — since it is the
one closest to their heart — and
pass it with the right hand —
since it is closest to the heart of
the next person.
Whoever has the stone has the
right to talk as long as they want.
No one can interrupt the speaker,
and no one can leave or enter the
"sacred" circle until everyone has
spoken.
Larimore said the house sat in
the Great Circle at the end of last
year, when the residents discussed
their feelings about their experi
ence in the house. This year, the
circle was part of a four-hour ori
entation workshop for the resi
dents, in which they brought forth
their goals for the house.
Getting in
One of the biggest goals for the
RFs, Larimore said, is to "need
and get a bigger house." The 1990
Draw cutoff number was quite low
for women — 544 — while for men
it was 2216.
Ethnic priorities for the house
are given to students with Native
American heritage, and regular
priorities are given to people who
present theme project proposals to
the RFs.
During the 1987-88 year, when
the house was in a transitional
period and was not yet the official
theme house, Larimore said many
people were assigned to the house
who did not care about the theme.
"Last year was the turning
point," she said. People seeking

priorities in the 1989 Draw num
bered 300 — four times the
amount in the 1988 Draw. This
year's Draw showed similar fig
ures.
"Everyone who got in
expressed an interest in the
theme," Larimore said.
She said she and Jim want to
interact with — and not just learn
the names of — as many residents
as possible this year.

in Casa Zapata his first two
years and was a theme associate
there last year, said that since he
is not a Native American, he is



April Pearson — Daily
Residents of Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native American theme house, say the house has a welcoming
atmosphere and has become a second home for Native American students who live elsewhere.
"interested, but not as excited" as
he was in Zapata, where Chicanos
and Latinos are the focus. "But I
don't feel excluded," he said.
Bravo's favorite part of life at
Muwekma-tah-ruk is that it's not
as socially active as Zapata. "I can
do my own thing," he said, "hang
out with everyone or be by
myself."
According to Escobar, many
people decide to live in Muwekma
tah-ruk because they have friends
who lived there the year before.
Others have more practical rea
sons. Weedon's motives for com
ing to Muwekma-tah-ruk were
being on the Row and being close
to the center of campus. However,
he said, he's enjoyed learning
about Native American culture.
Weedon said he enjoys the
theme because it "gives people a
reason for living together,"
whereas other houses are often
just filled with random people
through the luck of the Draw.
Giselle Perez de la Garza was
intrigued by the atmosphere she
sensed in visits to the house last
year.
But, she said, noting the circles
of friends many upperclassmen
already have, "It's been a little
harder than I thought it would be
to get to know people. People
aren't diving into [friendships]."
Sophomore Tammie Edwards
agreed. "Here, you've got to make
an effort to get to know people
well," she said.
Some non-Native American
students said they feel a little left
out because many of the Native
Americans already know each
other from Stanford's three-week
American Indian Summer Insti
tute Program.
Still, Perez de la Garza added,
"I don't feel alienated. I feel like
it's home.
"It beats Flo Mo," she laughed.
"Because this is actually a
house, you feel like you're actually
coming home" at the end of the
day, Edwards said. She decided to
live in Muwekma-tah-ruk when
she "walked by and it looked like
my house at home. It's the stair
case that did it," she said, smiling.
Muwekma-tah-ruk is also like
her house back home, she said,
because she leaves the house to
"party" and then comes back to
the house to study. "I think my
GPA's gonna be really psyched,"
she said.
A brief history
Karen Larimore is a junior in
sociology at Santa Clara Univer

sity. "I started a little late," she
laughed.
She said her husband, an asso
ciate dean of student affairs and
director of the Native American
Cultural Center, was involved in
the theme house proposal in 1987.
When the house was approved,
the Larimores, both Native Amer
icans, were the first choice to be
RFs for what was then known as
Lathrop.
In the beginning of 1987 — the
house's transitional year, before it
officially became a theme house —
a Sioux medicine man came to
bless the house.
Last year, Lathrop's first full
year as the official theme house,
residents and members of Stan
ford's Native American commu
nity decided to rename the house
in the language of the Ohlone
Indians, who lived for 5,000 years
on what is now Stanford land.
In a ceremony this spring, the
house was renamed Muwekma
tah-ruk, which means "The House
of the People."
Many people who don't live in
the house have a difficult time
saying the new name, which is
pronounced "Moo-WAYK-muh tah
rook." Many people call the house
"Muwekma," while others still
refer to it as Lathrop.
So far, the Ohlone name has
not been subjected to the abbrevi
ated fate of many campus building
names such as "Hoo Tow" or
"Mem Chu" — no one has called
the house "Mu-Ta-Ru."
A variety of programs
The recent nine-day celebra
tion of the Stanford American
Indian Organization's 20th
anniversary kept residents busy
with a flood of speeches and pro
grams.
During the rest of the year,
however, the cultural emphasis
continues. All Muwekma-tah-ruk
residents are required to coordi
nate a theme project related to the
Native American experience. Lari
more said the residents will soon
meet to coordinate common
theme projects.
Theme associate Nicole Stern,
a junior, said the two theme asso
ciates and the one resident assis
tant "are spending a lot of time
helping [the residents! organize
their own projects."
Edwards, who is black but also
part Cherokee, Seminole, Chicka
saw and Comanche, said she plans
to create a program about the
"parallel, hidden history" of racial
intermixing between African-
Americans and Native Americans.
Bravo said he wants to set up a
program examining Native Amer
ican politics and public policy,
especially at the reservations.
Many of the residents are col

laborating on a two-week spring
break trip to an Indian reserva
tion. Last year, many Muwekma
tah-ruk and Zapata residents
spent two weeks at a Havasupai
reservation in Arizona.
Other project ideas focus upon
traditional Native American
methods of healing, the influence
of food and dance on Native Amer
ican culture, pottery-making and
a backpacking trip to learn about
edible plants and Native American
outdoors techniques.
Another regular program is
the house's Tuesday Night Films,
which are open to the public and
feature movies from the Native
American Film Festival in San
Francisco.

Many residents agreed that the most memo
rable house bonding experience was the
'Great Circle,' a Native American tradition in
which members share their feelings.

Outside of structured pro
grams, residents have also had
some valuable "bonding" exer
cises. Many residents agreed that
the most memorable house bond
ing experience was the "Great Cir
cle," a Native American tradition.
In the ceremony, the residents
and the RFs hold hands in a large
circle, and the people in the circle
pass around a small "stone of the
earth." They take the stone with
their left hand — since it is the
one closest to their heart — and
pass it with the right hand —
since it is closest to the heart of
the next person.
Whoever has the stone has the
right to talk as long as they want.
No one can interrupt the speaker,
and no one can leave or enter the
"sacred" circle until everyone has
spoken.
Larimore said the house sat in
the Great Circle at the end of last
year, when the residents discussed
their feelings about their experi
ence in the house. This year, the
circle was part of a four-hour ori
entation workshop for the resi
dents, in which they brought forth
their goals for the house.
Getting in
One of the biggest goals for the
RFs, Larimore said, is to "need
and get a bigger house." The 1990
Draw cutoff number was quite low
for women — 544 — while for men
it was 2216.
Ethnic priorities for the house
are given to students with Native
American heritage, and regular
priorities are given to people who
present theme project proposals to
the RFs.
During the 1987-88 year, when
the house was in a transitional
period and was not yet the official
theme house, Larimore said many
people were assigned to the house
who did not care about the theme.
"Last year was the turning
point," she said. People seeking

priorities in the 1989 Draw num
bered 300 — four times the
amount in the 1988 Draw. This
year's Draw showed similar fig
ures.
"Everyone who got in
expressed an interest in the
theme," Larimore said.
She said she and Jim want to
interact with — and not just learn
the names of — as many residents
as possible this year.
A cozy setting
Residents live in a mixture of
singles, doubles and triples on the
second and third floors. Only 30
students live in Muwekma-tah
ruk, the smallest of the Row

houses. Most of the residents say
the small size is one of the biggest
advantages to life there.
Roommates David Parra and
lain Lamb, sophomores who both
lived in Florence Moore Hall last
year, agreed.
"I like the small house a lot
more," said Parra. "People are
more responsible for their
actions" in a small house than a
larger dorm, Lamb added. He also
noted that people in Muwekma
tah-ruk are very helpful.
Hernandez agreed. "People
around here look out for each
other," she said.
The house, which is approxi
mately 70 years old, has three
floors, two lounges, a study lounge
with two Macintoshes and a twist
ing maze of halls, balconies and
tiny getaways. Native American
paintings and prints line the
walls.
A sand volleyball court sits
right next to the house. Room
mates Bravo and John said the
house will start using the court as
soon as it cleans out the mess left
by cats who thought the court was
a huge litter box.
Some of the most attractive
features of the house are the bal
conies. Residents take full advan
tage of them, setting out lines of
clothes to dry, studying, eating,
sleeping (Parra and Lamb have a
hammock in their balcony) or just
sitting on them and thinking.
Sitting on a balcony, just as the
sun has almost sunk beneath the
horizon and the trees glow with
the light of dusk, one gets a sense
of traditional Native American
philosophy emphasizing the
beauty of nature and the slow pas
sage of time.
And throughout Muwekma
tah-ruk, residents said they also
get a sense of another foundation
of Native American life — the
family.
Sitting at the head of the Row,
right behind the Braun Music
Eftiilding, is what junior Arcy
Hernandez calls "Stanford's lit
tle secret" — Muwekma-tah
ruk, the Native American theme
house.

Second in a five-part series on
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
The house, which is begin
ning its third year as a theme
house, has grown into a home
for Stanford's entire Native
American community, as well as
anyone else who has ventured
beyond its doors.
Resident fellows Jim and
Karen Larimore said they want
to make the house inclusive, and
many of the residents said they
can feel that sense of inclusion.
"I don't think anybody feels
left out," said junior Magda
Escobar.
An invitation to freshmen
Although the house invites all
Native American freshmen to
visit, freshmen cannot live in
Muwekma-tah-ruk. For that rea
son, "It's so much more mellow"
in Muwekma-tah-ruk than in
freshman or four-class dorms,
Escobar said.
"There's no ruckus in the
halls," Hernandez said. "It's
good for studying."
Many Native American fresh
men do frequent the house,

though, eating lunch or dinner
there or watching television in
the lounge. Some even sleep on
the couches in breaks between
classes, Escobar said.
Karen Larimore said she and
her husband welcome all the
freshmen because they want to
make the atmosphere of the
house a comfortable one for
everyone in the Native American
community.
However, resident Jonathan
Weedon said the presence of the
visiting freshmen is "kind of
annoving." But, he quickly
added, the atmosphere in the
house is still conducive to study
ing.

"It's not like it's boring,
though," Escobar noted. "It's
like a home."
The freshmen are beginning
to learn what residents have
known for a long time — "The
food is so good," said Hernandez.
Although the house is part of
University Food Service, it has
its own cook who fixes all the
dinners, including "wonderful"
desserts every night.
Good food, however, has its
drawbacks. "We're literally
crushed together in the dining
room," said junior Ray John, a
member of the Choctaw tribe.
Lunch is served for only 15 min
utes, dinner for 30.

Out of Muwekma-tah-ruk'B
30 residents, 16 are Native
American. A number of non-
Native American residents said
they were somewhat apprehen
sive about how they would fit
into the house before the year
began.
"I was a little worried at
first," said Weedon. However,
residents said their fears have
been lifted by the house's
warmth.
Junior Noel Bravo, who lived
in Casa Zapata his first two
years and was a theme associate
there last year, said that since he
is not a Native American, he is

don't feel excluded," he said.
