# Heating up interest in new energy forms
## Profs, seek support for project

Paul Kruger, professor of
nuclear civil engineering at
Stanford, and Yuri Dyadkin of
the Leningrad Mining Insti
tute, may not be able to draw
blood from a stone, but they
can pull out something more
practical.
The two professors have just
completed a month-long cam
paign before the American sci
entific community, where they
tried to heat up interest in
geothermal energy.
The actual process behind
geothermal energy involves
tapping into the heat of the
rock that composes the earth's
crust. This heat, created by the
decay of naturally occurring
radioactive elements, is used to
heat water that turns turbines
and creates electricity.
Currently, the joint effort
between Stanford and the
Leningrad Mining Institute
has divided its work into sev
eral tasks. One of these
involves the preparation of a
three-volume monograph on
geothermal energy, written by
U.S. and Soviet specialists.
Most of the tasks, however,
involve mining geothermal
energy in new ways and places.

An example of this is the work
they are doing in developing
moderate temperature re
sources. Since the field is cur
rently limited to very hot water
resources, only a small fraction
of the total potential is being
realized unless they can create
energy from rock and water of
lower temperatures.
Perhaps the greatest task of
all, however, is trying to win a
$2 million award from the U.S.
government that would go
toward implementing their
projects. "There isn't a lot of
money in Washington for new
programs," Kruger said, but he
hopes that by requesting the
money from several different
departments, they will win fed
eral funding.
The idea of harnessing
geothermal energy is not new.
Kruger himself has been
involved in the field for 20
years.
The joint effort between
Kruger and Dyadkin to develop
geothermal energy sources is
made possible by a technical
agreement between Leningrad
Mining Institute and Stanford.
Their current activities involve
traveling around the nation
and asking various institutions
for their participation.
