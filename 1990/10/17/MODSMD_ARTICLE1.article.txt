### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
Business School Prof. Emeri
tus William Sharpe was one of
three people awarded the 1990
Nobel Prize in Economics for
work in financial economics and
corporate finance, the Swedish
Academy of Sciences announced
yesterday.
Sharpe, 56, was rewarded for
his contributions to the Capital
Asset Pricing Model, a portfolio
theory for investments. He
becomes the ninth Nobel laureate

on the Stanford faculty and the
first member of the Business
School to garner the award.
"I feel great, delighted and
overwhelmed. It is an incredible
thing to have happen, almost
impossible to comprehend,"
Sharpe said in an interview yes
terday.
"There is not much more any
one in this field can aspire to. This
is the top," he added.
Sharpe will share $700,000 in
prize money with his co-winners,
Harry Markowitz of the City Uni
versity of New York and Merton

Miller of the University of
Chicago. All three are experts in
theoretical and practical corporate
and investment finance.
Sharpe's model provides a way
of balancing potential gain from
investment with potential risk.
Considered the standard for the
investment industry, the theory is
used by corporate, institutional
and pension fund managers to
evaluate investments.
"It is a statement. .. that secu
rities with large amounts of mar
ket risk should be priced so that in
the long run you should expect to

do better," Sharpe explained.
"Basically, the more market risk
you take, the greater should be
your expected long-run return."
The theory is based in part on
earlier work done by other
economists, including Stanford
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow,
who won the Nobel prize in 1972.
"Sharpe's model is one of the
most famous papers in the last 30
years," Arrow said. "It has
become influential in economic
theory and for practical investors.
This is quite unusual."
Colleagues at Stanford and

throughout the nation congratu
lated Sharpe on the award and
praised his contributions to eco
nomic theory.
"The prize is a wonderful
recognition of his creativity and
insight. It is also gratifying that
this recognition should come to a
person who has been a gifted
teacher for all of his academic
career," lauded Business School
Dean A. Michael Spence.
Economics Prof. Michael
Boskin, currently serving as chair


William Sharpe
of President Bush's Council of
Economic Advisors, also said that
Sharpe's honor was "well
deserved."
In a telephone interview from
Washington, D.C., Boskin called
Sharpe "a pioneer in modern
finance theory who has helped
fundamentally to change the anal
ysis of asset pricing."
"His work is reflected in the
way finance is taught in our col

leges and universities, in the way
economists think about financial
markets today and in financial
practices," Boskin continued.
"[The Nobel] is great for Bill,
it's great for Stanford, and it's
great for the field of financial eco
nomics," he said.
Sharpe, who joined Stanford's
faculty in 1970, said he is still
overcoming the initial shock of
yesterday's news. He added he is
uncertain what he will do with the
award money, which will be be
presented at a formal ceremony in
Stockholm Dec. 10.
