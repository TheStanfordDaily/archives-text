# Budget war roars onward
## Tax increase for the rich provokes sharpest debate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Major
ity Democrats muscled their
deficit-cutting plan toward House
approval yesterday in an election
season bid to impose a sharp tax
increase on the wealthy. President
Bush promised a veto.
The Democrats' measure
would slash billions from govern
ment spending and raise the cost
of Medicare benefits, steps
Democrats said were essential to
bring the federal deficit under
control.
But it was the tax increase,
heavily tilted toward the well-to
do, that provoked the sharpest
debate.
"American people beware:
$160 billion in tax increases on
every working man and woman,"
said Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H.
"Watch how your congressman
votes."
The proposal would boost the
federal bite from a variety of taxes
on all but the very poorest Ameri

cans. It would force a one-time
increase for everyone who pays
income tax and set permanently
higher rates for the wealthy. Ard
it would slash spending on dozens
of programs, including Medicare,
farmers' assistance and college
students' loans.
The budget fight came just four
days before the government's
authority to spend money was to
lapse. Bush has said that unless
he receives a budget he likes, he
will let the government shut down
again on Saturday.
"It's a Democratic tax plan,"
Bush said at a political rally in
Glen Ellyn, 111. "If it reaches my
desk, the one that comes out of
the House of Representatives, I
will veto it because it raises the
income taxes of the working men
and women in this country, and I
am not going to do that."
Across the Capitol, the Senate
prepared to debate a compromise

plan worked out by the leaders of
both parties. It would not raise
tax rates on the wealthy, but it
would limit the deductions they
could claim. It would also double
the 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax,
and increase from $51,300 to
$125,000 the wage base from
which Medicare taxes are
deducted.
Democratic Sens. David Boren
of Oklahoma and Sam Nunn of
Georgia said they would try to
amend that measure to raise
income tax rates on the wealthy —
as in the House bill — reduce
taxes on investment profits and
rejuvenate tax-free savings
accounts.
The Senate bill and the House
Democratic package were de
signed as part of an overall plan to
slice $40 billion from the deficit in
the federal budget year that
started Oct. 1, and $500 billion
over the next five years.
