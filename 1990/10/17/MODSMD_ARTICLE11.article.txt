### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Mikhail S. Gor
bachev yesterday scaled back plans to
transform the Soviet economy, elimi
nating a 500-day deadline for switch
ing to a free-market system.
His action drew an angry response
from rival Boris N. Yeltsin, Gor
bachev's onetime partner in economic
reform, who termed the program an

attempt "to preserve the administra
tive-bureaucratic system."
Yeltsin, president of the Russian
republic, said Russia, the largest
republic in the Soviet Union, might
ignore the plan and set up its own cur
rency, customs service and army. Rus
sian officials have vowed to start a 500-
day transition from a planned to a free

market economy Nov. 1.
The president's 66-page blueprint,
bearing his signature and delivered to
committees of the Soviet legislature, is
at least the fourth in a series of plans
for reviving the Soviet economy.
The latest version would give the
Soviet republics new powers to run the
nation's economy, free many prices

that had been artificially fixed and
allow private ownership of businesses.
The newest Gorbachev plan is the
result of a three-week effort with top
economists to work out how to alter a
highly centralized system that fails to
provide adequate food, shelter or ser
vices for the country's 285 million peo
ple.
