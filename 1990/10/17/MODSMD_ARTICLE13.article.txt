# U. of Iowa will not burn dogs

lOWA CITY, lowa (AP) â€” The University of
lowa's plan to incinerate more than 1,000 radioac
tive dog carcasses has been suspended indefinitely, a
university official said yesterday.
But environmental groups, who have been pres
suring the university to hold a public hearing before
burning the carcasses, can't take credit for the deci
sion, said James Morrison, vice president for
research.
"I don't think that we've done a good enough job
of providing answers to our own employees," said
Morrison. Holding a public hearing "would be a bit of
a circus," he added.
Plans, instead, call for a series of meetings, possi
bly as news conferences, with employees, media and
state legislators, Morrison said.
"We're not in any hurry. We can spend months
trying to explain everything," he said. "But I'll tell
you this, we won't start any burning without giving
the public a two-week notice."
Environmental Advocates and lowans for Animal
Rights have expressed concerns about how much
radioactivity would be released in the air if the uni
versity went ahead with plans to burn some 900 bar
rels containing the slightly radioactive carcasses.
They were to be burned in a refurbished 25-year
old incinerator at the Oakdale campus, a few miles
west of downtown lowa City.
In a similar case in Spokane, Wash., hundreds of
dead dogs, the remains of a Cold War radiation
experiment, were shipped to the Hanford nuclear
reservation for burial last month.
The 828 dead beagles, shipped from California in
55-gallon drums, were buried in trenches at Hanford
a few weeks ago. Their remains had been stored in
freezers at the Institute of Toxicology and
Environmental Health on the University of
California campus at Davis.
