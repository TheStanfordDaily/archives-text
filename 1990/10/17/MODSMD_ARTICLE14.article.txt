# Bush threatens to veto civil rights bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush declared yesterday that
a civil rights bill designed to
combat job discrimination would
spur employers to adopt hiring
quotas and said he would veto the
measure if it reached his desk.
Democratic leaders of the Sen
ate, meanwhile, struggled to bring
the bill to a vote.
"This bill ... is neither sound
nor practical," Bush said. "I am
convinced it will have the effect of
forcing businesses to adopt quotas
in hiring an promotion."
In a letter to Sen. Slade Gor
ton, R-Wash., the president said
the bill would also "foster divi
siveness and litigation" and "do
more to promote legal fees than
civil rights."
"If this bill is presented to me,
I will feel compelled to veto it,"
Bush said.
Civil rights and business lobby
ists packed the anterooms off the
Senate chamber as lawmakers
debated the measure, which
would overturn six Supreme
Court decisions handed down last
year.
Following Senate action, spon
sors hoped for quick House pas
sage to put the bill on the presi
dent's desk. Too much delay
would enable the president to kill
the bill by pocket veto — letting it
die without his signature while
Congress is in adjournment.

The president has 10 days to
act on any bill reaching him, and
Congress hopes to adjourn by Oct.
27 at the latest.
Provisions of the bill range
from a ban on racial harassment
in the workplace to punitive dam
ages in extreme job discrimination
cases.
The sharpest clashes, however,
have come over complex changes
in ground rules governing job dis
crimination lawsuits. The changes
would make it easier for those fil
ing suit to win and harder for
employers to defend themselves.
Administration officials say the
changes would be so hard on
employers that they would turn to
quota hiring to have a readv-made
defense in case they found them
selves in court. They have warned
for months of a veto.
Civil rights forces scoff at that
view. Lawmakers on both sides
have been bemoaning the confu
sion arising from the sheer com
plexity of the provision.
"It is not ... a battle between
David Duke and the rest of us for
the soul of the Republican Party,"
Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo.,
said. "It is a quibbling over words
that lawyers have been involved
in."

ham Lincoln?" he said. "Or is this
the Republican Party of David
Duke?"
Republicans winced at the
mention of the former Ku Klux
Klan leader and Louisiana state
legislator who counts himself as a
Republican even though GOP offi
cials have taken enormous pains
to repudiate him.
"I think bringing in David
Duke is hitting below the belt a
bit," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah.
A chastened Metzenbaum came
back to the floor later and said it
had been "inappropriate and
improper" to associate Republi
cans with Duke.
"There's no argument," he
said. "Republicans are not Nazis.
They're not Ku Klux Klanners.
They're not anti-semites. They're
not anti-black."
He recalled that Republican
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
defended him against a "smear"

several years ago "and I can well
understand his resentment."
Despite Bush's statement in
his letter to Gorton, backers of the
bill hoped the president wouold
sign it.
Some lawmakers believe, how
ever, that Bush will opt to "pocket
veto" the bill, allowing it to die for
lack of a signature after Congress
adjourns and leaves Washington
for the campaign trail.
As a practical matter, lobbyists
said, Bush would probably be able
to pocket veto the legislation if he
wanted to do so if it arrived on his
desk much later than yesterday
night.
It was unclear whether Bush
would prefer to pocket-veto the
measure or instead veto the mea
sure outright and send to
Congress an alternative that he
would be willing to sign. But lob
byists said it seemed clear he
would want the pocket-veto
option available.

Republicans winced at the
mention of the former Ku Klux

legislator who counts himself as a
Republican even though GOP offi

"I think bringing in David

A chastened Metzenbaum came
back to the floor later and said it
had been "inappropriate and
improper" to associate Republi

to pocket veto the legislation if he

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush declared yesterday that
a civil rights bill designed to
combat job discrimination would
spur employers to adopt hiring
quotas and said he would veto the
measure if it reached his desk.
Democratic leaders of the Sen
ate, meanwhile, struggled to bring
the bill to a vote.
"This bill ... is neither sound
nor practical," Bush said. "I am
convinced it will have the effect of
forcing businesses to adopt quotas
in hiring an promotion."
In a letter to Sen. Slade Gor
ton, R-Wash., the president said
the bill would also "foster divi
siveness and litigation" and "do
more to promote legal fees than
civil rights."
"If this bill is presented to me,
I will feel compelled to veto it,"
Bush said.
