Congress OKs billion-dollar sub
WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate
budget negotiators reached a preliminary
agreement yesterday that the Navy should
build a second Seawolf submarine.
The decision, which could be subject to
change, overturns an earlier Senate recom
mendation that the Seawolf be delayed and
that two more of an older, less expensive sub
marine be built.
The early versions of the Seawolf are
expected to cost about $1.6 billion each. The
Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in
Groton, Conn., already has been awarded the
contract for the first Seawolf.
Earlier this year the Senate Armed Services
Committee had recommended that instead of
funding a second Seawolf that money be pro
vided for two smaller, less expensive Los Ange
les-class submarines.
But the House Armed Services Committee,
which prefers moving ahead with the Seawolf,
prevailed in the House-Senate negotiations.
Byatt wins Booker Prize
LONDON (AP) — Critic and novelist A.S.
Byatt yesterday won the Booker Prize,
Britain's most prestigious literary award, for
her tale of two young scholars investigating
the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets.
The five judges deliberated two hours
before awarding the $39,000 prize to Antonia
Byatt for "Possession," one of six finalists in
the 21-year-old competition.
Last year's Booker winner was Kazuo Ishig
uro for his novel, "The Remains of the Day."
Byatt, who earlier this month won the
$43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for
international fiction for the same work, has
published five novels since 1964.
U.S. may be in recession
WASHINGTON (AP) - The head of the
organization charged with determining when
recessions begin said yesterday that the coun
try may have entered a downturn in August,
but it's too soon to say whether the first reces
sion in eight years has started.
"The general principle has been to declare a
recession only after six months" of a turning
point, said Martin Feldstein, president of the
National Bureau of Economic Research.
Feldstein said the four criteria the NBER
generally uses to mark turning points in the
economy — employment, personal income,
retail sales and production — all declined in
August.
