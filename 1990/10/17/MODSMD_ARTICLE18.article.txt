Stanford should offer
classes, hold drills to
prepare for the Big One

Today we celebrate the
anniversary of the Loma Pri
eta earthquake. The 7.1 tem
blor that hit us on this date last
year has been the theme for parties
and social functions across cam
pus.
Indeed, we should be happy that
no Stanford resident was hurt and
that the University recovered with
amazing speed after the earth
shaking event.
However, the fact that the Big
One may hit any time should
somber us in our celebration and
make us reflect on how to make
this campus safer than ever from
the detrimental effects of earth
quakes.
The University has made a great
effort to ensure that the campus
remains functional after a debili
tating quake.
But having emergency supplies
is not enough. Students need to
know what to do with them.
Although most resident fellows
and resident assistants were told
what to do in the event of an earth
quake, one has to realize that
power structures will change in the
event that the people in charge
now are injured and other students
have to take on their responsibili
ties.
Some colleges have a system in
which the first five students from a
dorm to report to a designated area
after a quake are given vests that
indicate leadership roles in the
emergency situation. Stanford
should emulate this plan because it
relieves RFs and RAs of some of
their burdens.
In the case of a quake,

each dorm is supposed to send a
runner to the Emergency Opera
tions Center at the Stanford Police
Department to get instructions.
The University should have a
map prominently located in the
dorm indicating where all earth
quake support centers are located.
In addition, all students who
signed up for rescue and first aid
squads should be given adequate
training. First aid applied incor
rectly can cause more harm than
good.
In just the short period of time
since fall quarter started, the Uni
versity has done an admirable job
informing students about earth
quake safety.
But this should not merely be a
short term project. Continued edu
cation is a must in this quake
prone country.
Because many students still do
not know anything about earth
quakes other than what they expe
rienced last year, there should be
more dorm programming on safety
and preparedness issues. Twain is
doing an earthquake simulation
this week — an excellent dorm ini
tiative.
But simulations should be more
than just dorm initiatives. Perhaps
they could be institutionalized into
a mandatory drill similar to fire
drills.
Another issue of concern is how
to account for students after a
quake.
Students should be allowed to
take refuge in the nearest dorm
they find, where the local RAs or
RFs can inform the students' resi
dence staff of their whereabouts.
It is important that the Stanford
community retain its sense of
order and sanity after a major dis
aster.
Because of the University's
unique resources and organization,
we may be called upon to take a
leadership role for neighboring
communities as well.
