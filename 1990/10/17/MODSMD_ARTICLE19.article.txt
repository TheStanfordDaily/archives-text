Unauthorized use of
student PAC numbers
is not a large problem
The Daily ran an article and an edito
rial last week suggesting that Communi
cation Service's security procedures for
distributing personal access codes for
student use on the Stanford telephone
system were insufficient.
The Daily also implied that the
department, and I in particular, seemed
unconcerned with a possible "breech in
security."
Communication Services instituted
the service allowing students to obtain
their codes by calling our office as a
direct response to student requests.
We considered security issues, and
after discussion with various campus
departments with similar security con
cerns, we instituted procedures used by
other University areas such as the Regis
trar's Office and the Bursar's Office.
Since most students, when given the
option of calling or coming over to
Forsythe Hall, chose to call, this service
seemed to be considered a convenience
for the majority.
My comment relating to individuals
"frequently" guessing codes related to
codes of 6-digit length and was meant to
explain why Communication Services
extended the lengths of the codes to
seven digits, an action which signifi
cantly improved security.
Based on our experience with admin
istrative departments and students,
unauthorized use of telephone access
codes is not a large-scale problem at
Stanford.
Nevertheless, students who suspect
someone is using their code should call
Communication Services immediately.
We can cancel your existing code and
issue a new one at no charge.
Communication Services is very con
cerned with security. We investigate
every case of reported unauthorized use

and have instituted several automated
procedures to detect such use at an early
stage.
Since inappropriate use of access
codes is a violation of the Fundamental
Standard, cases in which a student has
misused codes are referred to the Judi
cial Affairs Office.
During this initial year of offering ser
vice to all campus residences, Communi
cation Services will constantly be review
ing its services and procedures to assure
the best profile possible.
If, after talking to individual students
and advisory groups, it becomes evident
that additional security procedures are
required, Communication Services will
institute them based on their recommen
dations.

The alcohol policy
will not accomplish
what it intends to do
What's all the brouhaha about the
new alcohol policy?
I've always wanted to use that word,
just for the sound of it. But isn't that all
this is, noise?
Letter after letter is too polarized to
make a real point. "Beware the transfor
mation of Stanford into a police state!"
Or, "Praise Stanford's rise from the law
less depths!"
Let's get back to the basics. The new
alcohol policy seeks to reduce alcohol
abuse.
Let's not pretend that the law or the
policy can prevent underage drinking. So
is the new alcohol policy going to accom
plish its purpose?
NOT.
Now if I knew more about psychology,
I might explain how punishing disobedi
ence is less effective than rewarding
exemplary conduct.
If I had some statistics, I might delin

eate the lower incidence of teenage alco
holism in Europe, where drinking alcohol
is legal for minors, relative to the U.S.
If I could combine the experience of
my friends and myself, I might deluge
you with examples of how drinking is
more out of control in other schools,
where policies are more unforgiving than
they are here.
The whole philosophy of the
Fundamental Standard is investing trust
in students. Stanford does not ignore the
law; it is simply confident its students
can take responsibility for their own
actions.
In the past, this policy has been suc
cessful, and regardless of events else
where under such circumstances,
Stanford students have shown they mer
ited this trust.
Strict enforcement of the new alcohol
policy would be contradictory and conde
scending.

Tresidder will end use
of styrofoam supplies,
with student support
Disposable plates, cups and silver
ware, particularly styrofoam cups and
plates, are an environmental problem.
They take up space in our landfills;
they cause litter on campus. With most
styrofoam, ozone-depleting chlorofluoro
carbons are byproducts of the manufac
turing process.
In short, they should be avoided
whenever and wherever possible.
Richard Calbow, manager of Food
Services at Tresidder, has indicated that
he is willing to discontinue the use of
styrofoam at Tresidder to the extent pos
sible, provided there is adequate student
support.
This is an opportunity for Stanford
students to demonstrate their commit-

ment to the environment.
Please indicate your support for elimi
nating styrofoam and disposable dishes
on campus by filling out a suggestion
card next time you are at Tresidder.
Together, we can make a difference!

Why is the University
waiting until April to
fix Memorial Church?
Thank you for your articles over the
past month on the status of Memorial
Church.
However, there is still one thing I am
not clear about: why the University is
waiting until April to repair the church?
It has already been a year since the
earthquake, but structural repairs have
not begun. Why the eighteen-month
delay?
