# Still unstable
## Fiscal, structural woes are legacy of 7.1 quake 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
One year after a disastrous earthquake jolted the
Bay Area, Stanford is performing a difficult balanc
ing act in its attempt to recover fully from the pow
erful temblor.
On the one hand, University administrators are
grappling with the damaging impact the earthquake
has had on Stanford's budget and are seeking mil
lions of dollars in earthquake-relief money to repair
several damaged University buildings.
And at the same time, the University is doling out
money in an effort to

educate people about
the constant danger
earthquakes pose. The
University must also
try to lessen the blow of
a seismic jolt predicted
to come within the next
30 years that might
unleash more destruc
tion than last October's
7.1 temblor.
With its epicenter
about 55 miles south-

east of campus, the
Loma Prieta earthquake struck one year ago today
at 5:04 p.m., sending the ground from San Francisco
to Monterey Bay heaving for a quarter of a minute.
The temblor is blamed for the deaths of 63 people
around the Bay area and for injuring more than
3,700 others. An estimated 12,000 homes were
declared uninhabitable and some estimates place
total damage to the region at about $7 billion.
While many consider the University lucky
because no deaths were reported here, the earth
quake left its mark on campus by damaging several
buildings.
Nearly 250 students were forced out of their
severely damaged residences following the earth
quake. Sixteen Row houses have reopened over the
past year, but decisions are still pending for the most
badly damaged student residences: Synergy, Delta
Tau Delta and Phi Psi.
University officials have placed an overall $172
million price tag on repairs and reconstruction pro
jects around campus. Some of the damaged buildings
in need of funding are Memorial Church, the Stan
ford Museum, parts of Green Library, the Geology
and Language corners of the Quad and parts of the
Art Gallery.
To comply with state law, Stanford must present
Santa Clara County officials with a plan by Decem
ber outlining how it will reinforce its masonry build
ings. The University will propose a nine-year pro-
gram to complete the work,
according to Facilities Project
Management planners.
Much of the work on unrein
forced masonry will take place in
the Quad, and University admin
istrators say the work will be com
pleted next winter.
Memorial Church is slated to
undergo $10 million in repairs,
which will involve removing the
roof, strengthening parts of the
internal structure and then
replacing the clay tiles.
Existing walls at the Stanford
Museum will be reinforced with
steel, and University planners
want to reinforce parts of Green
Library with concrete towers.
Construction on the Art
Gallery is still on hold until suffi
cient funds can be raised.
The multi-million dollar fix-it
tag presents University budget
planners a daunting figure made
even more difficult because Stan
ford underestimated the original
costs of the damage and overesti
mated federal funding.
Asst. Provost for Planning and
Management John Hughes
explained that this funding gap of
$38 million is the result of three
factors: continuing negotiations
with the Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency, low initial esti
mates of building repair costs and
overlooking the necessity of
strengthening the Quad's arcades.
To make up the shortfall, the
University is slowing construction
of the planned Near West Campus.
In addition, Stanford may have to
defer some earthquake repairs or
reallocate money for planned
maintenance.
The University has already
begun an earthquake fund raising
drive which has met with limited
success. Over the past year, Stan
ford has received $6 million in
gifts and pledges for earthquake
recovery. Most of that money has
gone toward restoring the badly
damaged Memorial Church.
But, Hughes said fund raising
for buildings is difficult. "It's hard
to raise money for bricks and mor
tar," he said.
The earthquake will have
implications on the budget crisis

for years to come, Hughes warned.
The University is taking on some
long-term debt to help pay for
building repair. Last week the
Board of Trustees approved a 1.2
percent debt for the operating
budget, which is approximately
$36 million.
Hughes said taking on that
amount of debt restricts budget
planners' options when discussing
future growth and programming.
He said flatly, "I'm afraid we
haven't gotten all the bad news
about cost estimates."
While dollars and structures
are causing headaches for campus
planners, others at the University
are busy reminding those who live
and work on campus that the
threat of slipping fault lines has
not disappeared.
Today's Quakefest in White
Plaza — featuring emergency sup
plies and demonstrations by the
Red Cross — and yesterday's
earthquake disaster drill in Twain
House are the most recent exam
ples of the University's efforts to

• FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency): like an insurance company, provides money for repairs in the event of natural
disaster.
• Unrestricted funds: funds in the university operating budget that are not designated to specific projects.
• Long-term debt: will be figured into future annual budgets to help pay for improvements.
• General Plant Improvements: part of budget that normally allows for repair of sidewalks, streets, lighting, etc. around campus.
• Fund Raising: Fund Raising, silly...

show how to prepare for the "Big
One."
Last month, in anticipation of
the services needed during a major
earthquake, many dormitories
devoted house meetings to divid
ing residents into rescue, first aid
and support teams.
During the past year, Univer
sity faculty and administrators
have formed committees responsi
ble for anticipating the havoc a
major earthquake would unleash.
One committee operating before
last year's temblor, the
Housing/Earthquake Preparation
Group, oversaw the secret burial
this summer of 12 fiberglass silos
which hold enough food for 10,000
people for two days.
Group member Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Food Ser
vice, recently noted an irony in
last October's earthquake:
"Before the quake it was hard to
get scheduled by (resident fellows)
to speak at dorms," he noted. But
the earthquake served to pique
people's attention.

Doug Davis — Daily
Guy said he thought the group
will continue in its work. "We're
going to continue to hone what
we've got," he said.
But for all the good intentions
of University committees and pro
grams, many people admit to a
casual attitude about future
earthquakes.
But some are worried that even
this heightened awareness that
earthquakes can strike unexpect
edly may disappear within a few
years.
Serra RF Ross Shachter said
the real question of how prepared
the University is will come "when
all those who have experienced the
quake" have graduated. He said
he is afraid that as time passes the
emphasis on preparation might
dissipate.
"I think the campus is very well
prepared," Shachter said.
Although no one can predict when
earthquakes will unleash their
power, people "have control over
the decisions we make now," he
said.

$38 million is the result of three
factors: continuing negotiations
with the Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency, low initial esti
mates of building repair costs and
overlooking the necessity of
strengthening the Quad's arcades.
To make up the shortfall, the
University is slowing construction
of the planned Near West Campus.
In addition, Stanford may have to
defer some earthquake repairs or
reallocate money for planned
maintenance.
The University has already
begun an earthquake fund raising
drive which has met with limited
success. Over the past year, Stan
ford has received $6 million in
gifts and pledges for earthquake
recovery. Most of that money has
gone toward restoring the badly
damaged Memorial Church.
But, Hughes said fund raising
for buildings is difficult. "It's hard
to raise money for bricks and mor
tar," he said.
The earthquake will have
implications on the budget crisis

for years to come, Hughes warned.
The University is taking on some
long-term debt to help pay for
building repair. Last week the
Board of Trustees approved a 1.2
percent debt for the operating
budget, which is approximately
$36 million.
Hughes said taking on that
amount of debt restricts budget
planners' options when discussing
future growth and programming.
He said flatly, "I'm afraid we
haven't gotten all the bad news
about cost estimates."
While dollars and structures
are causing headaches for campus
planners, others at the University
are busy reminding those who live
and work on campus that the
threat of slipping fault lines has
not disappeared.
Today's Quakefest in White
Plaza — featuring emergency sup
plies and demonstrations by the
Red Cross — and yesterday's

disaster.
• Unrestricted funds: funds in the university operating budget that are not designated to specific projects.

Last month, in anticipation of
the services needed during a major
earthquake, many dormitories
devoted house meetings to divid
ing residents into rescue, first aid
and support teams.
During the past year, Univer
sity faculty and administrators
have formed committees responsi
ble for anticipating the havoc a
major earthquake would unleash.
One committee operating before
last year's temblor, the
Housing/Earthquake Preparation
Group, oversaw the secret burial
this summer of 12 fiberglass silos
which hold enough food for 10,000
people for two days.
Group member Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Food Ser
vice, recently noted an irony in
last October's earthquake:
"Before the quake it was hard to
get scheduled by (resident fellows)
to speak at dorms," he noted. But
the earthquake served to pique
people's attention.

Doug Davis — Daily
Guy said he thought the group
will continue in its work. "We're
going to continue to hone what
we've got," he said.
But for all the good intentions
of University committees and pro
grams, many people admit to a
casual attitude about future
earthquakes.
But some are worried that even
this heightened awareness that
earthquakes can strike unexpect
edly may disappear within a few
years.
Serra RF Ross Shachter said
the real question of how prepared
the University is will come "when
all those who have experienced the
quake" have graduated. He said
he is afraid that as time passes the
emphasis on preparation might
dissipate.
"I think the campus is very well
prepared," Shachter said.
Although no one can predict when
earthquakes will unleash their
power, people "have control over
the decisions we make now," he
said.

One year after a disastrous earthquake jolted the
Bay Area, Stanford is performing a difficult balanc
ing act in its attempt to recover fully from the pow
erful temblor.
On the one hand, University administrators are
grappling with the damaging impact the earthquake
has had on Stanford's budget and are seeking mil
lions of dollars in earthquake-relief money to repair
several damaged University buildings.
And at the same time, the University is doling out
money in an effort to

the constant danger
earthquakes pose. The
University must also
try to lessen the blow of
a seismic jolt predicted
to come within the next
30 years that might
unleash more destruc
tion than last October's
7.1 temblor.
With its epicenter
about 55 miles south-

east of campus, the
Loma Prieta earthquake struck one year ago today
at 5:04 p.m., sending the ground from San Francisco
to Monterey Bay heaving for a quarter of a minute.
The temblor is blamed for the deaths of 63 people
around the Bay area and for injuring more than
3,700 others. An estimated 12,000 homes were
declared uninhabitable and some estimates place
total damage to the region at about $7 billion.
While many consider the University lucky
because no deaths were reported here, the earth
quake left its mark on campus by damaging several
buildings.
Nearly 250 students were forced out of their
severely damaged residences following the earth
quake. Sixteen Row houses have reopened over the
past year, but decisions are still pending for the most
badly damaged student residences: Synergy, Delta
Tau Delta and Phi Psi.
University officials have placed an overall $172
million price tag on repairs and reconstruction pro
jects around campus. Some of the damaged buildings
in need of funding are Memorial Church, the Stan
ford Museum, parts of Green Library, the Geology
and Language corners of the Quad and parts of the
Art Gallery.
To comply with state law, Stanford must present
Santa Clara County officials with a plan by Decem
ber outlining how it will reinforce its masonry build
ings. The University will propose a nine-year pro-
gram to complete the work,
according to Facilities Project
Management planners.
Much of the work on unrein
forced masonry will take place in
the Quad, and University admin
istrators say the work will be com
pleted next winter.
Memorial Church is slated to
undergo $10 million in repairs,
which will involve removing the
roof, strengthening parts of the
internal structure and then
replacing the clay tiles.
Existing walls at the Stanford
Museum will be reinforced with
steel, and University planners
want to reinforce parts of Green
Library with concrete towers.
Construction on the Art
Gallery is still on hold until suffi
cient funds can be raised.
The multi-million dollar fix-it
tag presents University budget
planners a daunting figure made
even more difficult because Stan
ford underestimated the original
costs of the damage and overesti
mated federal funding.

going to continue to hone what
we've got," he said.
But for all the good intentions
of University committees and pro
grams, many people admit to a
casual attitude about future
earthquakes.
But some are worried that even
this heightened awareness that
earthquakes can strike unexpect
edly may disappear within a few
years.
Serra RF Ross Shachter said
the real question of how prepared
the University is will come "when
all those who have experienced the
quake" have graduated. He said
he is afraid that as time passes the
emphasis on preparation might
dissipate.
"I think the campus is very well
prepared," Shachter said.
Although no one can predict when
earthquakes will unleash their
power, people "have control over
the decisions we make now," he
said.
