# Still unstable
## Fiscal, structural woes are legacy of 7.1 quake 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
One year after a disastrous earthquake jolted the
Bay Area, Stanford is performing a difficult balanc
ing act in its attempt to recover fully from the pow
erful temblor.
On the one hand, University administrators are
grappling with the damaging impact the earthquake
has had on Stanford's budget and are seeking mil
lions of dollars in earthquake-relief money to repair
several damaged University buildings.
And at the same time, the University is doling out
money in an effort to

educate people about
the constant danger
earthquakes pose. The
University must also
try to lessen the blow of
a seismic jolt predicted
to come within the next
30 years that might
unleash more destruc
tion than last October's
7.1 temblor.
With its epicenter
about 55 miles south-

east of campus, the
Loma Prieta earthquake struck one year ago today
at 5:04 p.m., sending the ground from San Francisco
to Monterey Bay heaving for a quarter of a minute.
The temblor is blamed for the deaths of 63 people
around the Bay area and for injuring more than
3,700 others. An estimated 12,000 homes were
declared uninhabitable and some estimates place
total damage to the region at about $7 billion.
While many consider the University lucky
because no deaths were reported here, the earth
quake left its mark on campus by damaging several
buildings.
Nearly 250 students were forced out of their
severely damaged residences following the earth
quake. Sixteen Row houses have reopened over the
past year, but decisions are still pending for the most
badly damaged student residences: Synergy, Delta
Tau Delta and Phi Psi.
University officials have placed an overall $172
million price tag on repairs and reconstruction pro
jects around campus. Some of the damaged buildings
in need of funding are Memorial Church, the Stan
ford Museum, parts of Green Library, the Geology
and Language corners of the Quad and parts of the
Art Gallery.
To comply with state law, Stanford must present
Santa Clara County officials with a plan by Decem
ber outlining how it will reinforce its masonry build
ings. The University will propose a nine-year pro-
