## Just say no to telecourses 
### 
WHEN I CALLED the Immigration
and Naturalization Service
recently to inquire about visa
options on behalf of a foreign friend, the
phone was answered not by a human
being, not even by a bureaucrat, but by a
computer programmed with generic
answers to generic questions.
The computer-simulated voice fea
tured the same metallic resonance and
mechanical intonation as the one which
spells phone numbers out in slow motion
when you call directory assistance.
I followed its instructions dutifully,
making selections from an interminable
sequence of menus by pushing buttons on
my touch-tone phone.
Forced at one point to commit to one of
two potentially appropriate choices, I was
momentarily paralyzed by the realization
that if I later changed my mind and
wanted to go back to the previous menu, I
would have to hang up and endure the
whole Kafkaesque maze again from the
beginning.
The automated "interaction" left me
feeling that I had been robbed of my voice
— my ability to articulate the particulari
ties of my friend's situation to someone
who could give an informed response
about what she should do.
In dealing with high-volume federal
bureaucracies like the INS, however, I
must admit that I am becoming resigned
to such industrial-strength doses of
impersonality.
But I am alarmed that the modern
trend toward substituting machines for
humans has now crept into Stanford ped
agogy Prof. Zimbardo's spring 1990 ver

sion of Psychology 1, touted as an experi
mental "telecourse," involved one weekly
lecture on Wednesdays, and video presen
tations of his 26-part PBS series on Mon
days and Fridays.
The course coordinator justified this
heavy reliance on video on the grounds
that it made the material more vivid: stu
dents watched live footage of psychologi
cal experiments instead of hearing them
described in lecture.
While the bestowal of numerous dis
tinguished teaching awards on Zimbardo
may justify some deference to his choice,
it also underscores the magnitude of the
loss faced by those students whose oppor
tunities for direct classroom interaction
with such a gifted teacher were reduced
by the course's video emphasis.
Furthermore, once telecourses are
made acceptable by teachers of his
stature, they may be a seductive option
for other professors anxious to retreat
from the classroom for other, non-peda
gogical reasons.
Video instruction threatens to reduce
students to passive receptacles, to rob
them of their voices and to reinforce the
already overwhelming predominance of
visual imagery over written and oral com
munication in their lives.
The effects of this predominance can
be seen in their diminished power of ver
bal expression: in seeking to describe
their emotions, for example, young people
today frequently say: "I was like ",
and then make a contorted facial gesture
to visually fill in the blank.
Granted a picture is sometimes worth

a thousand words, but traditional modes
of expression are already endangered
enough by trends in the wider society
without having to withstand subversion
in their long-time bastion: the classroom.
Students share some blame for these
trends. Perceptive teachers like Zimbardo
probably notice that they can hold stu
dents' TV-stunted attention spans better
through video images, and so they seek to
exploit that "channel" to their psyche.
If students want teachers to respect
the integrity of their voices, they must
use them far more than they do cur
rently: by being more active in the class
room, by freely articulating their reac
tions to course material, and by asking
questions relentlessly when instructors'
presentations lack clarity or vividness.
The emergence of video instruction
indicates how far undergraduate educa
tion has strayed from the Socratic ideal of
teacher-student interaction.
Video may be useful as a teaching sup
plement, but it should only be used when
a course's number of lecture hours per
week is at least at or above the average,
and even then only as a secondary
resource after written material.

WHEN I CALLED the Immigration
and Naturalization Service
recently to inquire about visa
options on behalf of a foreign friend, the
phone was answered not by a human
being, not even by a bureaucrat, but by a
computer programmed with generic
answers to generic questions.
The computer-simulated voice fea
tured the same metallic resonance and
mechanical intonation as the one which
spells phone numbers out in slow motion
when you call directory assistance.
I followed its instructions dutifully,
making selections from an interminable
sequence of menus by pushing buttons on
my touch-tone phone.
Forced at one point to commit to one of
two potentially appropriate choices, I was
momentarily paralyzed by the realization
that if I later changed my mind and
wanted to go back to the previous menu, I
would have to hang up and endure the
whole Kafkaesque maze again from the
beginning.
The automated "interaction" left me
feeling that I had been robbed of my voice
— my ability to articulate the particulari
ties of my friend's situation to someone
who could give an informed response
about what she should do.
In dealing with high-volume federal
bureaucracies like the INS, however, I
must admit that I am becoming resigned
to such industrial-strength doses of
impersonality.
But I am alarmed that the modern
trend toward substituting machines for
humans has now crept into Stanford ped
agogy Prof. Zimbardo's spring 1990 ver

sion of Psychology 1, touted as an experi
mental "telecourse," involved one weekly
lecture on Wednesdays, and video presen
tations of his 26-part PBS series on Mon
days and Fridays.
The course coordinator justified this
heavy reliance on video on the grounds
that it made the material more vivid: stu
dents watched live footage of psychologi
cal experiments instead of hearing them
described in lecture.
While the bestowal of numerous dis
tinguished teaching awards on Zimbardo
may justify some deference to his choice,
it also underscores the magnitude of the
loss faced by those students whose oppor
tunities for direct classroom interaction
with such a gifted teacher were reduced
by the course's video emphasis.
Furthermore, once telecourses are
made acceptable by teachers of his
stature, they may be a seductive option
for other professors anxious to retreat
from the classroom for other, non-peda
gogical reasons.
Video instruction threatens to reduce
students to passive receptacles, to rob
them of their voices and to reinforce the
already overwhelming predominance of
visual imagery over written and oral com
munication in their lives.
The effects of this predominance can
be seen in their diminished power of ver
bal expression: in seeking to describe
their emotions, for example, young people
today frequently say: "I was like ",
and then make a contorted facial gesture
to visually fill in the blank.
Granted a picture is sometimes worth

a thousand words, but traditional modes
of expression are already endangered
enough by trends in the wider society
without having to withstand subversion
in their long-time bastion: the classroom.
Students share some blame for these
trends. Perceptive teachers like Zimbardo
probably notice that they can hold stu
dents' TV-stunted attention spans better
through video images, and so they seek to
exploit that "channel" to their psyche.
If students want teachers to respect
the integrity of their voices, they must
use them far more than they do cur
rently: by being more active in the class
room, by freely articulating their reac
tions to course material, and by asking
questions relentlessly when instructors'
presentations lack clarity or vividness.
The emergence of video instruction
indicates how far undergraduate educa
tion has strayed from the Socratic ideal of
teacher-student interaction.
Video may be useful as a teaching sup
plement, but it should only be used when
a course's number of lecture hours per
week is at least at or above the average,
and even then only as a secondary
resource after written material.
