## We didn't start the fire — should we put it out?

Didn't Smokey always tell us
forest fires were a bad thing?
Isn't it logical to extinguish
fires right away — before they can
get out of control — rather than
letting some burn themselves out,
as national policy dictates?
You might have asked yourself
these questions if you were one of
the many outdoors-enthusiasts
whose vacation plans were
thwarted by the fires in Yosemite
National Park this summer.
Although this summer's fires
in Yosemite and those which rav
aged Yellowstone in 1988 did
become unwieldy, the policy of let
ting fires burn in national parks is
based on solid ecological princi
ples.
However, when this policy
clashes with tourism, the
National Park Service comes
under fire from citizens and politi
cians alike.
People widely believe fires are
causing the death of forests.
But fires don't kill forests, they
actually initiate their rebirth;

replacing stagnant older growth
with younger, more dynamic
ecosystems.
Research, including the exami
nation of historical records and
the study of surviving trees which
have been scarred by flames, has
indicated the historical impor
tance of fires in parks such as Yel
lowstone and Yosemite.
Although from 1878 to 1963,
national park policy required the
suppression of all forest fires, cur
rent policy dictates that naturally
occurring fires (usually sparked
by lightning) be allowed to burn
freely in remote areas of parks.
However, fires caused by
human negligence — or those
dangerously near inhabited areas
— which may threaten life, prop
erty or important resources are
deemed "wildfires," and steps are
immediately taken to extinguish,
or at least contain, them.
This policy recognizes the
importance of fires as natural
agents of ecological change which
occurred regularly and indeed,
frequently in nature before gov
ernment suppression policies
were in place.

Certain species thrive in the
aftermath of a fire, finding a
nearly ideal environment in the
ash-covered soil, which serves as a
natural fertilizer.
The lodgepole pine, for exam
ple, possesses an extraordinary
adaptation causing some of its
seeds to germinate only when
charred, as in the wake of a fire. It
is therefore one of the first species
to regerminate.
Immediately after a fire, herba
ceous plants, such as grasses,
wildflowers and bushes, grow
back in the region, which is still
interspersed with dead trees. This
low lying vegetation, which domi
nates the area for the first 50
years after a fire, is very moist and
resistant to fire, allowing
regrowth to take place.
This first stage of succession
after a fire lasts about 50 years,
during which lodgepole saplings
grow to about 15-20 feet. Many
animal species, such as woodpeck
ers and elk, are supported by this
open, sunny forest.
During the second stage of suc
cession, which lasts for about 100
years, the pines reach heights of

30-50 feet and begin to block the
sun.
In the third stage, which lasts
for about another 100 years, the
lodgepole pines begin to thin out,
increasing sunlight to the under
story and allowing the growth of
other trees, such as spruce and fir,
as well as renewed vegetation on
