# Spotted owl conflict nearing resolution
## Stanford biologist had hand in policy recommendation 
### Alison Russell 
The Bush Administration may be poised to imple
ment a "scientifically credible" conservation plan for
the northern spotted owl, according to a Stanford
biologist.
However, implementation may only be partial,
depending on proposed pro-logging legislation by
Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, according to Dennis
Murphy, director of Stanford's Center for Conserva
tion Biology, a separate institute within the Biology
Department.
The spotted owl is a threatened species whose
habitat, old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest,
is threatened by logging activities.
The owl was thrust into the national media spot
light earlier this year when environmentalists con
cerned with preserving the bird's habitat and those
whose livelihoods depend on the timber industry
came into conflict over the forests' future.
Last fall, Congress created a committee to investi
gate policy options concerning the spotted owl.
Murphy was among the 12 members of the
committee, and characterized his position on it as
the "neutral player from academia."
He said he was asked to serve on the committee
due to the Center's reputation for conflict resolution
between competing land users, particularly federal
agencies and conservationists.
The conservation strategy devised by the group,
known as the Thomas Report, was the result of more
than six months' intensive study of the threatened
species and its habitat.
Murphy said the Thomas Report "redefined the
paradigm of conservation planning" by developing a
viable owl recovery plan while taking into considera
tion its possible economic effects on the regions
involved.

In striking a balance, the plan allows for further
loss of 50 percent of the present owl population,
which Murphy estimates at approximately 8,000
birds.
Under the plan, existing Spotted Owl Habitat
Areas would be replaced by larger habitat conserva

tion areas, each of which could support approxi
mately 20 pairs of breeding owls. The existing habi
tats support only one to three pairs of owls each.
The proposed habitats could be as large as
600,000 acres, although land ownership and land
scape patterns in many areas would necessitate
smaller areas, some less than 100 acres.
The report calls for maximum distance between
conservation areas of 12 miles, improving "connec
tivity" between groups. Distances between existing
habitats, on the other hand, tend to be greater, dis
couraging owl dispersal and interbreeding.
After receiving the interagency report, the Bush
Administration in June decided to allow logging to
continue in the Northwest until a newly formed task
force could come up with a different plan.
At the same time, Fish and Wildlife Service Direc
tor John Turner declared the spotted owl a threat
ened species.
As of now, the new task force has failed to come up
with a new plan.
Murphy stands by the Thomas Report, saying the
committee "was given a clear directive to do the job,
and did it in a balance fashion using good science."
Although the Bush Administration "couldn't
shoot down the report," Murphy said it is unclear
whether the plan will be fully adopted.
The Forest Service "has not embraced but is going
to implement" most of the plan's recommendations.
The Bureau of Land Management, on the other had,
is refusing to do so, Murphy said.
Meanwhile Packwood is proposing an amendment
that would immediately invoke the Endangered
Species Committee "to consider an exemption from
the requirements of the Endangered Species Act"

with regard to the owl.
Packwood's alleged attempt to
circumvent the Endangered
Species Act is "wholly indefensi
ble," Murphy said.
The amendment would do
away with the 90-day consulta
tion period between federal agen
cies and the U. S. Fish and
Wildlife Service designed to come

up with "modifications or reason
able and prudent alternatives"
that would not threaten the sur
vival of the species.
In Murphy's view, Packwood's
planned amendment would
exterminate the owl and destroy
the ecosystem in exchange for a
short-term fix of a few thousand
jobs."
As it is however, the timber
industry, "top-heavy with rich
CEOs (high level management) is
calling the shots for the North
west," Murphy said.
