# New research helps explain visual process

What you see isn't always what you get,
researchers say.
Stanford scientists are on the road to simu
lating perceptions of motion by directly stimu
lating specific brain cells.
Dr. William Newsome and colleagues at the
School of Medicine have shown that a certain
cluster of nerve cells functions in controlling
the visual perception of motion.
These nerve cells are located in the visual
cortex â€” a general region on the exterior sur
face of the brain which interprets what we see.
In the process of seeing, the eye functions
like a camera. It takes a picture of light, dark,
and color in the form of electrical signals.
These signals flow along pathways called
nerves into the brain and are then interpreted
to form what we describe as an image.
"How this interpretation comes about lies
at the heart of contemporary brain science,"
Newsome said, but there has been very little
laboratory evidence to explain how this occurs.
What investigators prior to Newsome had
done was "map out" the visual cortex and dis
cover some basic information about it.
For instance, they found that a certain
region of the cortex responds to objects that
are in the upper portion of our visual field.
Researchers also learned that certain clus
ters of nerve cells respond to specific visual
inputs such as a particular color or an object at
a certain distance from the observer.
Newsome's aimed to show that an electrical
signal occurring along an extremely small sec
tion of neurons could cause the perception of
upward motion.
