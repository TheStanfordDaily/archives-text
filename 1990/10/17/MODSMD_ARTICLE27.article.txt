# New research helps explain visual process

What you see isn't always what you get,
researchers say.
Stanford scientists are on the road to simu
lating perceptions of motion by directly stimu
lating specific brain cells.
Dr. William Newsome and colleagues at the
School of Medicine have shown that a certain
cluster of nerve cells functions in controlling
the visual perception of motion.
These nerve cells are located in the visual
cortex — a general region on the exterior sur
face of the brain which interprets what we see.
In the process of seeing, the eye functions
like a camera. It takes a picture of light, dark,
and color in the form of electrical signals.
These signals flow along pathways called
nerves into the brain and are then interpreted
to form what we describe as an image.
"How this interpretation comes about lies
at the heart of contemporary brain science,"
Newsome said, but there has been very little
laboratory evidence to explain how this occurs.
What investigators prior to Newsome had
done was "map out" the visual cortex and dis
cover some basic information about it.
For instance, they found that a certain
region of the cortex responds to objects that
are in the upper portion of our visual field.
Researchers also learned that certain clus
ters of nerve cells respond to specific visual
inputs such as a particular color or an object at
a certain distance from the observer.
Newsome's aimed to show that an electrical
signal occurring along an extremely small sec
tion of neurons could cause the perception of
upward motion.
One of the first steps was teaching rhesus
monkeys to report whether dots
of light on a television screen
were moving up or down.
After this, Stanford medical
student Daniel Salzman and
postdoctoral fellow Kenneth Brit
ten began working with New
some. Since a series of initial
experiments was successful, they
electrically stimulated a few
nerve cells that they thought
were sensitive to upward motion
in the visual cortex of the mon
keys.
In essence, what this did was
send a fake image to the cells
responsible for interpreting
motion. Thus, the animals
reported that they saw upward
motion when the dots on the TV
screen were actually moving
down.
"This result was more exciting
than any I've been involved in, in
my entire career — to do the key
experiment and have it pay off in
spades is a thrilling feeling,"

Newsome said.
"Still, one question arises
when you look at the results.
What is the animal actually see
ing? If he could talk to us, would
he say, 'I saw upward motion?' or
would he tell us, 'I saw downward
motion, yet I reported upward
motion; why in the world did I do
that?"' Newsome said.
Newsome hopes to eventually
answer these questions by doing a
similar study with humans. At
present though, Newsome said
he is "trying to characterize the
phenomena more fully."
Experiments such as New
some's, which demonstrate how
the eye and the brain interact to
give animals the ability to see may
help scientists to build machines
with this ability.
A more exciting potential
application is the development of
a device that will help people see
who have damaged eyes but a nor
mal visual cortex.
But Newsome said such a
usage is only "science fiction"
now because of the immense com
plexity of the system.
