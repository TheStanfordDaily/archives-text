# What good is exercise, anyway?

Exercise is defined by Web
ster's New World Dictionary as
"any activity of the body or mind."
Most of us may be familiar with
this vague definition, but exactly
what benefits does exercise really
offer?
Most doctors would tell us that
exercise counters the risk of heart
disease and stroke by lowering
serum cholesterol levels and blood
pressure. But most college stu
dents don't give a. . .well, you
know, about disorders that aren't
prevalent in people their ages.
So why should you exercise
now when you may not have to
worry about heart disease or
stroke for another 30 years or so?
Because exercising will make
you look and feel as good as Don
Kennedy himself on his way back
from the Dish.

First, exercise is the key to per
manent weight loss for those who
are trying to win the battle of the
bulge. Dieting alone may be a tem
porary cure, but it can also lead to
serious problems, such as malnu
trition, and eventually, the pounds
will reappear.
Exercise helps you stay trim
because it increases your
metabolic rate. For you fuzzies
out their, that means it resets the
body thermostat to a higher tem

perature, causing you to burn fuel
— and thus, fat — faster.
Exercise is a natural relaxant
and produces a lasting euphoric
effect. Therefore, it is a great way
to combat tension, anxiety, anger,
frustration, and even boredom —
ailments that almost all college
students suffer from at some
point.
And you don't have to run a
marathon to get adequate exer
cise. Tennis, biking, volleyball,
and even brisk walking are great
ways to exercise and have fun at
the same time.
How much exercise do you
need? A good rule of thumb is to
exercise for 20-30 minutes, at
least three times a week. If you're
doing vigorous exercise such as
swimming or running, you can
keep the time limit down to
around 20 minutes.
But if you're only exercising

moderately or lightly — playing
tennis, walking etc. — you may
want to extend the allotted time to
45 minutes or more.
To gain maximum short and
long-term benefits from exercise,
make sure that you are exercising
your heart and lungß.
Although most sports and
activities are aerobic, two com
mon exceptions are weightlifting
and sprinting.
So if you spend the majority of
your exercise time pumping iron
make an effort to include other,
more aerobic activities in your
exercise schedule.
So get out and enjoy the Cali
fornia weather. Leave that
English paper for later. Grab a
frisbee and go play some ultimate.
Exercise is one of the keys to
staying sane in the not-so-sane
world of Stanford University.
