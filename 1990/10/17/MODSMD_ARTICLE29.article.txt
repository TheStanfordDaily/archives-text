Ql've noticed a line of half
• buried cement silos in the
• foothills right near
Junipero Serra Boulevard — are
they a missile defense for Hoover
Tower or what ?
A At first, we thought they
• were pillboxes put in to
• defend the Reagan

Library against rampaging home
less people, but it seems that nei
ther of us is right. We called the
San Francisco Water Department,
which is responsible for many odd
underground things and they
quickly demolished our Maginot
line theory.
Their senior civil engineer, Bill
Camp, said that those turret-like
cement boxes are access manholes
and vents for one of the two main
aqueducts that supply water to
the bay area. Most of the towns
around here buy some of their
water from the department,
which gets most of its water from
the Hetch Hetchy system origi
nating near Yosemite.
Water from Yosemite flows to
Sunol, in the East Bay, where it is
treated to make it drinkable. The
flow then splits into four pipes,
two crossing the bay near the
Dumbarton Bridge and two pass
ing under San Jose. The pipes
from the Dumbarton Bridge
travel near route 101, while the
San Jose pipes pass through the
Foothills.
Those pillboxes trace the path
of the aqueduct as it connects to
the Pulgas Water Temple near the
Crystal Springs Reservoir. There,
the four pipes rejoin, and the
water flows to San Francisco.
Along the way, local towns tap
off the water that they need to

supplement what they get from
local wells and springs.
The four pipes are there to pro
vide back-up in case one bursts or
needs repair. Without the Hetch
Hetchy water, most of the Bay
Area would run dry very quickly.
One final bit of hydraulic
trivia: the two pipes crossing by
the Dumbarton Bridge have
inside diameters of 60 and 66
inches, and the pipes in the
Foothills 72 and 90 inches. This
adds up to a lot of water, roughly
250 million gallons every day.
/""X Why does the moon
• appear so much larger
\f • when it's near the hori
zon than it does when it's over
head?
AThis phenomenon,
• known as the "moon illu
• sion," is most prominent
when the moon is full and is seen
with the sun as well. Although it
has been observed since before
Yoda was born, it has been
explained only recently.
The moon has a diameter of
3,476 kilometers and an average
distance from the Earth of
384,400 km. This translates (with
the arctangent button on your cal
culator) to an angle of a little over
1/2 degree of arc.
This angle, and its correspond

mg image size on our retinas, is
not changed significantly by the
atmosphere (or by smog or air pol
lutants) when the moon is near
the horizon.
Instead, the increase in size is
due to our perception of the
object, not by any physical or
astronomical effect.
When we see the moon over
head, there are almost no visual
cues as to its actual size or dis
tance. We therefore perceive the
moon to be a certain arbitrary
size, without realizing how incred
ibly far away it really is.
However, when the moon is
near the horizon, our brains are
bombarded with visual cues
telling us that it is really far away.
It lies behind, and therefore far
ther away than, any buildings,
trees or mountains.
Our brains then make the sen
sible conclusion that if the moon
is farther away than anything on
this planet, and it still has a rela
tively large angular size for a dis
tant object, then it must be really
big. With a backdrop of familiar
objects, the moon appears larger
than in the open sky.
So, to apply the words of
William Shakespeare, "The fault,
dear Brutus, is not in our stars
but ourselves."

However, when the moon is
near the horizon, our brains are
bombarded with visual cues
telling us that it is really far away.
It lies behind, and therefore far
ther away than, any buildings,
trees or mountains.
Our brains then make the sen
sible conclusion that if the moon
is farther away than anything on
this planet, and it still has a rela
tively large angular size for a dis
tant object, then it must be really
big. With a backdrop of familiar
objects, the moon appears larger
than in the open sky.
So, to apply the words of
William Shakespeare, "The fault,
dear Brutus, is not in our stars
but ourselves."

Ql've noticed a line of half
• buried cement silos in the
• foothills right near
Junipero Serra Boulevard — are
they a missile defense for Hoover
Tower or what ?
A At first, we thought they
• were pillboxes put in to
• defend the Reagan

Library against rampaging home
less people, but it seems that nei
ther of us is right. We called the
San Francisco Water Department,
which is responsible for many odd
underground things and they
quickly demolished our Maginot
line theory.
Their senior civil engineer, Bill
Camp, said that those turret-like
cement boxes are access manholes
and vents for one of the two main
aqueducts that supply water to
the bay area. Most of the towns
around here buy some of their
water from the department,
which gets most of its water from
the Hetch Hetchy system origi
nating near Yosemite.
Water from Yosemite flows to
Sunol, in the East Bay, where it is
treated to make it drinkable. The
flow then splits into four pipes,
two crossing the bay near the
Dumbarton Bridge and two pass
ing under San Jose. The pipes
from the Dumbarton Bridge
travel near route 101, while the
San Jose pipes pass through the
Foothills.
Those pillboxes trace the path
of the aqueduct as it connects to
the Pulgas Water Temple near the
Crystal Springs Reservoir. There,
the four pipes rejoin, and the
water flows to San Francisco.
Along the way, local towns tap
off the water that they need to

supplement what they get from
local wells and springs.
The four pipes are there to pro
vide back-up in case one bursts or
needs repair. Without the Hetch
Hetchy water, most of the Bay
Area would run dry very quickly.
One final bit of hydraulic
trivia: the two pipes crossing by
the Dumbarton Bridge have
inside diameters of 60 and 66
inches, and the pipes in the
Foothills 72 and 90 inches. This
adds up to a lot of water, roughly
250 million gallons every day.
/""X Why does the moon
• appear so much larger
\f • when it's near the hori
zon than it does when it's over
head?
AThis phenomenon,
• known as the "moon illu
• sion," is most prominent
when the moon is full and is seen
with the sun as well. Although it
has been observed since before
Yoda was born, it has been
explained only recently.
The moon has a diameter of
3,476 kilometers and an average
distance from the Earth of
384,400 km. This translates (with
the arctangent button on your cal
culator) to an angle of a little over
1/2 degree of arc.
This angle, and its correspond

mg image size on our retinas, is
not changed significantly by the
atmosphere (or by smog or air pol
lutants) when the moon is near
the horizon.
Instead, the increase in size is
due to our perception of the
object, not by any physical or
astronomical effect.
When we see the moon over
head, there are almost no visual
cues as to its actual size or dis
tance. We therefore perceive the
moon to be a certain arbitrary
size, without realizing how incred
ibly far away it really is.
However, when the moon is
near the horizon, our brains are
bombarded with visual cues
telling us that it is really far away.
It lies behind, and therefore far
ther away than, any buildings,
trees or mountains.
Our brains then make the sen
sible conclusion that if the moon
is farther away than anything on
this planet, and it still has a rela
tively large angular size for a dis
tant object, then it must be really
big. With a backdrop of familiar
objects, the moon appears larger
than in the open sky.
So, to apply the words of
William Shakespeare, "The fault,
dear Brutus, is not in our stars
but ourselves."
