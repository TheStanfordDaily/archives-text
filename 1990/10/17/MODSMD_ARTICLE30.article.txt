# The 						Quake of '89, One year later
## Communities get rebuilt after quake

"They said the damage is
minor, but I have a bad feeling
we'll be living somewhere else."
— Lisa Brooks, Columbae resi
dent, October 17, 1989.
Although most Stanford
students displaced by the Oct. 17
earthquake received new housing
within weeks, extensive struc
tural damage kept seven houses
closed for the rest of the year. This
fall, all of the seven houses have
reopened or relocated.
After repairs were completed
over the summer, Columbae,
Durand, Roth and Theta Xi
reopened in their original loca
tions.
However, the original homes of
Phi Psi, Synergy and Delta Tau
Delta have not yet been repaired.
University officials have not
announced definite repair plans
for the three houses.
This year, these groups have
moved into other campus resi
dences which did not suffer struc
tural damage.
Phi Psi now resides in the for
mer AD House, which was
renamed the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest. Synergy took over Grove-
Lasuen and Grove-Mayfleld. The
Delts now occupy 553 Mayfield.
Many returning residents from
these houses said they are relieved
to find more permanent housing
after their evacuation and reloca
tion experiences last year.
After the temblor, most dis
placed students accepted on-cam
pus housing in converted guest
rooms, study rooms and lounges.
Students were placed in Toyon,
Wilbur, Roble and Florence Moore
Halls and in several Row houses.
Residents of Columbae and
Synergy tried to preserve their co
operative community by renting
off-campus houses. Ten students

from Columbae moved to a house
in Menlo Park which they nick
named "Hermosa." They held
house meetings there once or
twice a quarter.
Some Phi Psi residents had a
more difficult time maintaining
contact with each other, even
though the community held its
traditional Halloween party at
Theta Chi House and continued to
meet for happy hours throughout
the year.
One returning Phi Psi resident
noted she had completely lost con
tact with some former house
mates. "Having lived together for
only three weeks, it was difficult
to luiow everyone from the house
well," she said.
The Delts were forced to evacu
ate their house after living in it for
fifteen years. With about 80 per
cent of the fraternity members
playing varsity sports and most
moving off-campus, it was diffi
cult to keep attendance high at
last year's house meetings.
Adam Badgett, a resident assis
tant in Theta Xi, said losing the
house and having a large number
of new pledges led to organiza
tional problems. "It's a shame
that we were spread all over cam
pus," he said.
Badgett added he noticed a
"really bitter tone" last year
among the fraternity members
toward the Stanford Housing
Center. This year, with a newly
renovated house, Theta Xis are
not only more positive towards
University Housing administra
tors, but also "a lot more courte
ous," he said. "People are more
caring about the condition of the
house."
Despite their change of housing
status, both fraternities had suc
cessful spring rushes. The Delts

had their best rush in ten years,
drawing twenty-six pledges, fif
teen more than their average.
House manager John Carpenter
suggested the central location of
the new house, 553 Mayfield,
might have been a drawing factor.
In order to continue to recruit
new co-op members, Synergy resi
dents Eric Rose and Joanna
Davidson sponsored a SWOPSI
course on cooperative living last
year. Students from the course
developed a co-op outreach pro
gram for the entire campus, post
ing flyers and holding informa
tional meetings.
Columbae was a popular choice
in last year's Draw. Of its thirty
one undergraduate residents,
Columbae was the first choice of
thirty and the second choice of
one.
Columbae, Synergy, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest and

both fraternities have noticed an
unusual amount of enthusiasm
among their residents.
"The sense of community is
amazing now," according to Delt
President Rob Robbins. "We've
always been excited about coming
back from summer, but now we're
coming back after eleven months
of being apart."
Senior Adrianne Estill, a
returning Columbae resident, said
her house is especially eager for
the new year and has already
instituted new house guidelines.
One change involves a Columbae
resident who was meditating on
the house roof when the earth
quake struck. "We've urged him
not to meditate anymore," Estill
said.
Neither Durand nor Roth has
as strong a returning resident tra
dition as the fraternities or co-ops.
Kim Kochaver, Durand's RA,
found herself accepting a position
in a house she had never even
seen. But other than having to
delay the room draw until this
fall, life has been "business as
usual," Kochaver said.

fall, all of the seven houses have
reopened or relocated.
After repairs were completed
over the summer, Columbae,
Durand, Roth and Theta Xi
reopened in their original loca
tions.
However, the original homes of
Phi Psi, Synergy and Delta Tau
Delta have not yet been repaired.
University officials have not
announced definite repair plans
for the three houses.
This year, these groups have
moved into other campus resi
dences which did not suffer struc
tural damage.
Phi Psi now resides in the for
mer AD House, which was
renamed the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest. Synergy took over Grove-
Lasuen and Grove-Mayfleld. The
Delts now occupy 553 Mayfield.
Many returning residents from
these houses said they are relieved
to find more permanent housing
after their evacuation and reloca
tion experiences last year.
After the temblor, most dis
placed students accepted on-cam
pus housing in converted guest
rooms, study rooms and lounges.
Students were placed in Toyon,
Wilbur, Roble and Florence Moore
Halls and in several Row houses.
Residents of Columbae and
Synergy tried to preserve their co
operative community by renting
off-campus houses. Ten students

from Columbae moved to a house
in Menlo Park which they nick
named "Hermosa." They held
house meetings there once or
twice a quarter.
Some Phi Psi residents had a
more difficult time maintaining
contact with each other, even
though the community held its
traditional Halloween party at
Theta Chi House and continued to
meet for happy hours throughout
the year.
One returning Phi Psi resident
noted she had completely lost con
tact with some former house
mates. "Having lived together for
only three weeks, it was difficult
to luiow everyone from the house
well," she said.
The Delts were forced to evacu
ate their house after living in it for
fifteen years. With about 80 per
cent of the fraternity members
playing varsity sports and most
moving off-campus, it was diffi
cult to keep attendance high at
last year's house meetings.
Adam Badgett, a resident assis
tant in Theta Xi, said losing the
house and having a large number
of new pledges led to organiza
tional problems. "It's a shame
that we were spread all over cam
pus," he said.
Badgett added he noticed a
"really bitter tone" last year
among the fraternity members
toward the Stanford Housing
Center. This year, with a newly
renovated house, Theta Xis are
not only more positive towards
University Housing administra
tors, but also "a lot more courte
ous," he said. "People are more
caring about the condition of the
house."
Despite their change of housing
status, both fraternities had suc
cessful spring rushes. The Delts

had their best rush in ten years,
drawing twenty-six pledges, fif
teen more than their average.
House manager John Carpenter
suggested the central location of
the new house, 553 Mayfield,
might have been a drawing factor.
In order to continue to recruit
new co-op members, Synergy resi
dents Eric Rose and Joanna
Davidson sponsored a SWOPSI
course on cooperative living last
year. Students from the course
developed a co-op outreach pro
gram for the entire campus, post
ing flyers and holding informa
tional meetings.
Columbae was a popular choice
in last year's Draw. Of its thirty
one undergraduate residents,
Columbae was the first choice of
thirty and the second choice of
one.
Columbae, Synergy, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest and

both fraternities have noticed an
unusual amount of enthusiasm
among their residents.
"The sense of community is
amazing now," according to Delt
President Rob Robbins. "We've
always been excited about coming
back from summer, but now we're
coming back after eleven months
of being apart."
Senior Adrianne Estill, a
returning Columbae resident, said
her house is especially eager for
the new year and has already
instituted new house guidelines.
One change involves a Columbae
resident who was meditating on
the house roof when the earth
quake struck. "We've urged him
not to meditate anymore," Estill
said.
Neither Durand nor Roth has
as strong a returning resident tra
dition as the fraternities or co-ops.
Kim Kochaver, Durand's RA,
found herself accepting a position
in a house she had never even
seen. But other than having to
delay the room draw until this
fall, life has been "business as
usual," Kochaver said.
"They said the damage is
minor, but I have a bad feeling
we'll be living somewhere else."
