# Future quake more likely
## Experts have increased odds since 1989 temblor

Geologists now believe there is a 67 per
cent chance another major earthquake will
rattle the Bay Area in the next 30 years,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park.
Before last year's 7.1 temblor, geologists
had set the figure at 33 percent.
Geophysics Prof. Robert Kovach said the
Loma Prieta earthquake "raised concern"
among geologists over the possibility of
another quake in another part of Northern
California.
Because of low seismic activity in the
Loma Prieta area in the years before 1989,
experts had pinpointed the area as suscepti
ble to a earthquake. Now, they are focusing
their studies on another area that has not
had much activity.
Called the Peninsula Gap, this area is
located between downtown San Francisco
and the Portola Valley. A gap region is an
area that has not experienced a large earth
quake in 100 years, according to Kovach. It
is believed that the lack of activity in gaps
makes them likely locations for future
earthquakes.
The Peninsula Gap is of special concern
because of the amount of industry in the
area. "It could cause a lot of problems,"
Kovach warned.
Experts had predicted a large earth-

quake for August 1989 â€” missing the date
of the Oct. 17 earthquake by about two
months. Geologists are hoping that by mon
itoring all seismological activity even more
carefully, they can predict more accurately
when the next "Big One" will occur.
Stanford's Geophysics department has
also played a part in this effort. It monitors
the seismographic activity at numerous
locations along the San Andreas fault,
attempting to measure all earthquakes that
occur in the area.
The department acquired new equip
ment Friday which will allow it to measure
msyor earthquakes quickly and more accu
rately. Called the Streckheisen broad-band
sensor, the device can record earthquake
waves over a large frequency and range,
according to Kovach.
While the department was previously
unable to accurately measure large quakes,
now it can do so in a matter of seconds.
The device is currently being tested at
the Geophysics department, but it will
eventually be located will be near the golf
course.
