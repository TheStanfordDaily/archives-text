# Modulars: Here to stay?

How temporary is "temporary?" It might be up to
20 years in the case of the earthquake modulars con
structed last March. Built to replace earthquake
damaged Quad buildings, the modulars are serving
as temporary classroom and office space.
Although University officials expect mtyor build
ing repairs to be completed during the next few
years, Stanford must also undertake the long task of
reinforcing all of its masonry buildings — including
the entire Inner Quad — to comply with California
law.
Until the University completes these renovations,
displaced classrooms and offices will continue to
operate out of the modulars, according to Asst.
Provost for Planning and Management John
Hughes.
Renovations to Buildings 300, 31.0 and 370 —
which housed offices of the Department of English,
the Office of Planning and Management and the Val
ues, Technology, Science and Society Program —
should be completed next fall, Hughes said. The
more heavily damaged Geology and Language Cor
ners will not be ready before winter quarter of 1993.
Hughes estimated the cost of setting up the
Galvez, Wilbur and Roble modulars, keeping them
open and moving offices to them when Quad build
ings are restored will cost about $4 million.
Even the president's office in Building 10 may not
be spared from renovation. But Hughes said he
doubted University President Donald Kennedy
would actually be moved to a modular because some
other Quad building would probably be able to
accommodate him.
Another factor in how long the modulars remain
is a University plan to buy the Galvez and Roble
modulars outright instead of continuing to rent
them. Stanford already owns the Wilbur modulars,
which were donated by International Business
Machines Corp.
Hughes said it is "highly likely" the University
will buy the modulars to save money. The cost of
buying the two modulars at $200,000 apiece will be
cheaper than continuing to pay the $9,000-per
month rent for the next two years alone.
Although many people originally disliked having
the modulars on campus, some seem to have grown
accustomed to them. Acting Registrar Jack Farrell
