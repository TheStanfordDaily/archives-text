# Stanford develops safety programs
## Both residences and hospital prepare to face worst-case scenario 
### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
Caught off-guard by last year's 7.1
earthquake, Stanford safety officials
are busy readying themselves for the
next big one.
New earthquake programs are
being implemented at many levels.
"We have come a long way from last
year," according to Chris Griffith,
assistant director of graduate resi
dences and member of the Office of
Residential Education's earthquake
committee.
The committee was formed before
last year's earthquake and includes
representatives from the Housing
Center, University Food Service and
the Office of Student Affairs. This
year, the committee is trying to pre
pare students living on campus for a
worst-case scenario.
For the first time, resident assis
tants received earthquake training
during RA Orientation. RAs were
instructed how to organize their dor
mitories into three student-staffed
help squads — support, rescue and
first aid.
"RAs were not trained that well
last year and squads were not out

lined," Griffith said.
In the event of a meyor earthquake,
one student from each dorm would be
designated the "dorm runner" and
would report to the Emergency Oper
ation Center, which would be located
at the Stanford Police department in
the event of an earthquake.
After arriving at the center, the des
ignated student would be responsible
for reporting damaged buildings and
missing students to the police and
writing them on a large white board.
Res Ed is also considering develop
ing a phone tree of individual stu
dents' emergency numbers to inform
parents or guardians of the situation,
according to Griffith.
"We need to cope with that scenario
better than we did last year," Griffith
said. She added she was relieved that
some potential procedural problems
had been identified in the wake of the
Oct. 17 earthquake.
In addition to instituting new com
munication procedures, the Univer
sity has also taken steps to provide for
the community in the days following a
mayor earthquake.
Twelve silos have been buried at
undisclosed locations on campus to be
opened after a mayor earthquake. The

silos contain food and first aid sup
plies for about 10,000 people for two
days as well as other necessary equip
ment.
A number of University staff mem
bers have been told the location of the
silos and will be in charge of retrieving
and distributing the supplies after a
earthquake.
The University is also focusing on
increasing students' awareness of
earthquake dangers. "Students must
be more prepared on an individual
level," said Margaret Wong, the Uni
versity's disaster preparedness coordi
nator.
Wong, an 1990 graduate, works at
the Stanford Police Department and is
responsible for dispersing information
to help students be more prepared.
The University is also better pre
pared to deal with structural damage
from future temblors. "We have a
much better understanding of our risk
and of the buildings on this campus"
as a result of the earthquake, accord
ing to Fouad Bendimerad, structural
engineer for Facilities Project Man
agement.
Bendimerad is also a member of the
University's earthquake commis
sion, which reviews policies on
earthquake preparedness. The
commission has spent the last
eight months reviewing all "com
ponents relating to earthquakes,"
he said.
The commission is co-chaired
by Asst. Provost for Planning and
Management John Hughes and
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh
Shah.
The commission completed its
final report of recommendations
regarding earthquake policy Fri
day.
"We have a program that has
been approved," Bendimerad
said, which includes procedures
for upgrading and retrofitting
buildings and standards for
design of new buildings.
The Stanford Hospital is also
currently reviewing its perfor
mance during last year's earth
quake and is preparing for future
earthquakes.

In case of a mtgor earthquake,
the hospital will be expected to
provide services for not only the
Stanford community, but sur
rounding areas as well.
After last year's earthquake,
the hospital encountered a prob
lem transporting patients in ele
vators that were jammed and
overused. Officials are currently
looking for alternate routes,
according to hospital sources.
The hospital also relied too
heavily on the phone system,
which may not be in operation
after a larger earthquake. In the
future, a special radio frequency
devoted solely to earthquake
related business will be used.
In addition, training programs
have been implemented in the
various hospital departments for
generic emergency situations.
Physicians have been given a
manual that is expected to help
prepare them for a future earth
quake.
"Stanford is one of the most
prepared places in this area,"
Wong said. "There is nothing like
an earthquake to get people inter
ested in earthquake awareness."

design of new buildings.
The Stanford Hospital is also
currently reviewing its perfor
mance during last year's earth
quake and is preparing for future
earthquakes.

In case of a mtgor earthquake,
the hospital will be expected to
provide services for not only the
Stanford community, but sur
rounding areas as well.
After last year's earthquake,
the hospital encountered a prob
lem transporting patients in ele
vators that were jammed and
overused. Officials are currently
looking for alternate routes,
according to hospital sources.
The hospital also relied too
heavily on the phone system,
which may not be in operation
after a larger earthquake. In the
future, a special radio frequency
devoted solely to earthquake
related business will be used.
In addition, training programs
have been implemented in the
various hospital departments for
generic emergency situations.
Physicians have been given a
manual that is expected to help
prepare them for a future earth
quake.
"Stanford is one of the most
prepared places in this area,"
Wong said. "There is nothing like
an earthquake to get people inter
ested in earthquake awareness."
Caught off-guard by last year's 7.1
earthquake, Stanford safety officials
are busy readying themselves for the
next big one.
New earthquake programs are
being implemented at many levels.
"We have come a long way from last
year," according to Chris Griffith,
assistant director of graduate resi
dences and member of the Office of
Residential Education's earthquake
committee.
The committee was formed before
last year's earthquake and includes
representatives from the Housing
Center, University Food Service and
the Office of Student Affairs. This
year, the committee is trying to pre
pare students living on campus for a
worst-case scenario.
For the first time, resident assis
tants received earthquake training
during RA Orientation. RAs were
instructed how to organize their dor
mitories into three student-staffed
help squads — support, rescue and
first aid.
"RAs were not trained that well
last year and squads were not out

lined," Griffith said.
In the event of a meyor earthquake,
one student from each dorm would be
designated the "dorm runner" and
would report to the Emergency Oper
ation Center, which would be located
at the Stanford Police department in
the event of an earthquake.
After arriving at the center, the des
ignated student would be responsible
for reporting damaged buildings and
missing students to the police and
writing them on a large white board.
Res Ed is also considering develop
ing a phone tree of individual stu
dents' emergency numbers to inform
parents or guardians of the situation,
according to Griffith.
"We need to cope with that scenario
better than we did last year," Griffith
said. She added she was relieved that
some potential procedural problems
had been identified in the wake of the
Oct. 17 earthquake.
In addition to instituting new com
munication procedures, the Univer
sity has also taken steps to provide for
the community in the days following a
mayor earthquake.
Twelve silos have been buried at
undisclosed locations on campus to be
opened after a mayor earthquake. The

silos contain food and first aid sup
plies for about 10,000 people for two
days as well as other necessary equip
ment.
A number of University staff mem
bers have been told the location of the
silos and will be in charge of retrieving
and distributing the supplies after a
earthquake.
The University is also focusing on
increasing students' awareness of
earthquake dangers. "Students must
be more prepared on an individual
level," said Margaret Wong, the Uni
versity's disaster preparedness coordi
nator.
Wong, an 1990 graduate, works at
the Stanford Police Department and is
responsible for dispersing information
to help students be more prepared.
The University is also better pre
pared to deal with structural damage
from future temblors. "We have a
much better understanding of our risk
and of the buildings on this campus"
as a result of the earthquake, accord
ing to Fouad Bendimerad, structural
engineer for Facilities Project Man
agement.
Bendimerad is also a member of the
University's earthquake commis
sion, which reviews policies on
earthquake preparedness. The
commission has spent the last
eight months reviewing all "com
ponents relating to earthquakes,"
he said.
The commission is co-chaired
by Asst. Provost for Planning and
Management John Hughes and
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh
Shah.
The commission completed its
final report of recommendations
regarding earthquake policy Fri
day.
"We have a program that has
been approved," Bendimerad
said, which includes procedures
for upgrading and retrofitting
buildings and standards for
design of new buildings.
