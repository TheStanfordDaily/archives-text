# Bay Area buildings, lives remain in shattered state of disrepair
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Compared to the rest of the Bay Area,
Stanford emerged from the Oct. 17 earth
quake with but a scratch.
The arches of Memorial Church may be
crumbling, but the double-decker section of
Oakland's Nimitz Freeway completely col
lapsed. As fraternities and co-operatives are
settling into their campus residences again,
some Watsonville and Santa Cruz residents
are still living out of motels and mobile
homes.
And while Stanford's estimated damages
total about $172 million, preliminary esti
mates of physical damage for the entire the
Bay Area exceed $7 billion. One year later,
residents are still rebuilding their lives,
homes and businesses from the devastation
of the temblor
The 15-second earthquake destroyed
over 12,000 homes and iryured 3,700 peo
ple. Sixty-three died — 42 of them in the
disaster on the Nimitz Freeway. Today, the
remnants of the freeway have been
removed, leaving a bare dirt island in its
place.
Another area which suffered particularly
extensive damage was the Marina District
in San Francisco, 60 miles from the earth
quake's epicenter. Many apartment build
ings collapsed, and cracks opened on area
streets.
A year after the earthquake, many of the
streets and buildings have been returned to
their original state.
According to local and federal officials,
much progress has been made toward

restoring the damaged structures and the
disrupted lives throughout the Bay Area.
However, many people are not satisfied
with the pace of repairs.
Santa Cruz Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt
told The Los Angeles Times, "Obviously,
things haven't gone fast enough." She
blamed the weakened national economy for
the slowed progress.
But many people claim the bureaucratic
ineptitude of government agencies has
become the greatest obstacle to the rebuild
ing process. Some apartments in Wat
sonville, for example, are awaiting federal
housing assistance before reconstruction
can begin.
In Los Gatos and Hollister, shop owners
cannot rebuild their ravaged businesses,
which lay dormant behind blocks of chain
link fences, until federal aid is approved.
Local governments have also added to
the delays. Owners of many mountain
homes in Santa Cruz County cannot even
start to rebuild until county officials issue
them building permits. Over 400 displaced
families in the area are still waiting for
building inspectors and geologists to review
their properties.
The delays have forced many families
throughout the Bay Area to live in tempo
rary housing. Some displaced residents in
Watsonville are living in homeless shelters,
while others crowd ramshackle motels.
"I don't want to have to raise my son in
a place like this," one father told The San
Jose Mercury News, "but if we left here
we'd have to live in the car."

Ravaged by fire# and collapsed buildings, the Marina District was one of the hardest hit parts In the Bay Area. Today,
reconstruction continues on the disfigured streets and crumbled structures.
In addition, many of these
families are strapped by dual
housing payments — rent for
their apartments and mortgages
on their damaged homes.
Santa Cruz, one of the hardest
hit cities in the Bay Area, has lost
more than $1 million in sales and
property tax revenues this year.
Dozens of businesses in the city
currently operate with makeshift
stands under temporary white
tents.
The city's financial woes are
compounded by a sharp dip in
tourism throughout entire
region. Apparently, frequent
aftershocks — as large as 5.4 on
the Richter scale — are rattling
prospective tourists as much as
residents.
Mental aftershocks of the
earthquake are also common,
according to some Bay Area coun
selors and psychologists. The San
Francisco After Quake Project, a
federally-funded program, has
provided free and confidential

counseling to over 30,000 individ
uals coping with the catastrophe.
The service will continue through
February 1991.
Many of the program's coun
selors are preparing for a barrage
of calls stimulated by the anniver
sary of the earthquake — com
monly referred to as an "anniver
sary reaction."
According to Diane Myers, con
sultant to the California Depart
ment of Health, "It's extremely
common for people to re-experi
ence memories of the disaster."
Some residents feel that
because the media dramatized the
destruction of Marina District
and the Nimitz Freeway, other
devastated areas have not been
addressed.
According to Wormhaudt,
"There are some indications that
people don't see a light at the end
of the tunnel."
"People have to realize this
was one of the greatest natural
disasters in the history of the
state," Santa Clara County
Supervisor Jan Beautz told The
San Francisco Chronicle. "It
takes time to recover and
rebuild."

families are strapped by dual
housing payments — rent for
their apartments and mortgages
on their damaged homes.
Santa Cruz, one of the hardest
hit cities in the Bay Area, has lost
more than $1 million in sales and
property tax revenues this year.
Dozens of businesses in the city
currently operate with makeshift
stands under temporary white
tents.
The city's financial woes are
compounded by a sharp dip in
tourism throughout entire
region. Apparently, frequent
aftershocks — as large as 5.4 on
the Richter scale — are rattling
prospective tourists as much as
residents.
Mental aftershocks of the
earthquake are also common,
according to some Bay Area coun
selors and psychologists. The San
Francisco After Quake Project, a
federally-funded program, has
provided free and confidential

counseling to over 30,000 individ
uals coping with the catastrophe.
The service will continue through
February 1991.
Many of the program's coun
selors are preparing for a barrage
of calls stimulated by the anniver
sary of the earthquake — com
monly referred to as an "anniver
sary reaction."
According to Diane Myers, con
sultant to the California Depart
ment of Health, "It's extremely
common for people to re-experi
ence memories of the disaster."
Some residents feel that
because the media dramatized the
destruction of Marina District
and the Nimitz Freeway, other
devastated areas have not been
addressed.
According to Wormhaudt,
"There are some indications that
people don't see a light at the end
of the tunnel."
"People have to realize this
was one of the greatest natural
disasters in the history of the
state," Santa Clara County
Supervisor Jan Beautz told The
San Francisco Chronicle. "It
takes time to recover and
rebuild."
Compared to the rest of the Bay Area,
Stanford emerged from the Oct. 17 earth
quake with but a scratch.
The arches of Memorial Church may be
crumbling, but the double-decker section of
Oakland's Nimitz Freeway completely col
lapsed. As fraternities and co-operatives are
settling into their campus residences again,
some Watsonville and Santa Cruz residents
are still living out of motels and mobile
homes.
And while Stanford's estimated damages
total about $172 million, preliminary esti
mates of physical damage for the entire the
Bay Area exceed $7 billion. One year later,
residents are still rebuilding their lives,
homes and businesses from the devastation
of the temblor
The 15-second earthquake destroyed
over 12,000 homes and iryured 3,700 peo
ple. Sixty-three died — 42 of them in the
disaster on the Nimitz Freeway. Today, the
remnants of the freeway have been
removed, leaving a bare dirt island in its
place.
Another area which suffered particularly
extensive damage was the Marina District
in San Francisco, 60 miles from the earth
quake's epicenter. Many apartment build
ings collapsed, and cracks opened on area
streets.
A year after the earthquake, many of the
streets and buildings have been returned to
their original state.
According to local and federal officials,
much progress has been made toward

restoring the damaged structures and the
disrupted lives throughout the Bay Area.
However, many people are not satisfied
with the pace of repairs.
Santa Cruz Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt
told The Los Angeles Times, "Obviously,
things haven't gone fast enough." She
blamed the weakened national economy for
the slowed progress.
But many people claim the bureaucratic
ineptitude of government agencies has
become the greatest obstacle to the rebuild
ing process. Some apartments in Wat
sonville, for example, are awaiting federal
housing assistance before reconstruction
can begin.
In Los Gatos and Hollister, shop owners
cannot rebuild their ravaged businesses,
which lay dormant behind blocks of chain
link fences, until federal aid is approved.
Local governments have also added to
the delays. Owners of many mountain
homes in Santa Cruz County cannot even
start to rebuild until county officials issue
them building permits. Over 400 displaced
families in the area are still waiting for
building inspectors and geologists to review
their properties.
The delays have forced many families
throughout the Bay Area to live in tempo
rary housing. Some displaced residents in
Watsonville are living in homeless shelters,
while others crowd ramshackle motels.
"I don't want to have to raise my son in
a place like this," one father told The San
Jose Mercury News, "but if we left here
we'd have to live in the car."
