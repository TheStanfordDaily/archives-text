# The
						Quake of '89 One year later
## Community flippant about earthquakes 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Like true Californians, many members
of the Stanford community take earth
quakes in stride.
Admitting that earthquakes are a fact of
life here, University President Donald
Kennedy said there is "no way" he would
prefer to be president of Harvard Univer
sity just because there are no quakes on the
East coast. "They're due for the 'Big One'
back there," he quipped.
Tolerating earthquakes is "part of the
deal" of living in the area, Kennedy said.
Most students and community members
who lived through the Oct. 17 earthquake
seem to concur.
"The challenge is to go about life as
usual," said Kas Badiozamani, a senior
from Idaho. Badiozamani said he would
react to another earthquake in the same
way as his Southern Californian friends,
who grew up in a quake-prone area.
Despite the fact that he still feels unpre
pared for future quakes, Badiozamani
never regretted that he came to Stanford.
"If it's not earthquakes, it's tornadoes and
hurricanes," he said.
Victor Prince, a second-year business
student, also assumes a pragmatic attitude
about living on the West coast. He paid
Stanford and the Bay Area have attractions
that clearly "outweigh" those on the East
coast.
Prince lives in Cupertino and feels safe
because of his house's sturdy structure and
location. "It's a pretty open area," he said.
Other off-campus students, however,
feel less secure.
Junior John Bartol and his two room
mates plan to purchase emergency supplies
for their apartment in case a big earth
quake hits. "[Living off campus] made us
more conscious that we're not under the
protective umbrella" of the University's
emergency resources, he said.
Bartol is not the only cautious person in
town. Lorraine Morgan, resident fellow of
Adams House, has a bag packed right by
her bed. And to play it safe, she automati
cally looks for exits when she walks into a
theater or checks in at a hotel.
Former Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell said he does not keep
emergency supplies. After the last earth
quake, Campbell said he drove home, had a
martini and went straight to bed. He awoke
the next morning to find a water leaking
out of his swimming pool and a broken
chandelier.
Campbell is not troubled by earth
quakes. He is, in fact, extremely confident
of the safety of Hoover Tower, where his
office is located.
The tower is a very well constructed
building designed to withstand an earth
quake of magnitude 8.6, Campbell said.
"Why so much damage occurred around
campus is beyond me," he quipped.
Campbell's office is on the eleventh floor,

which he said "swayed nicely" with the
earthquake. "If it goes over, the whole cam
pus will be flattened anyway."
Music Lecturer Timothy Zerlang also
experienced the gentle swaying of the tower
during the earthquake. He was just getting
ready to play the bells in Hoover Tower
with Electrical Engineering Prof. James
Angell when he felt a sharp jolt. "We rode it
out" amid shelves tumbling down, Zerlang
said.
Like Campbell and Zerlang, sophomore
Mike Franz is not bothered by the prospect
of future quakes. He is more concerned
about whether or not he is a psychic.
"I was in the Quad with a friend, under a
Spanish arch," Franz said, recounting the
dream he had the night of October 16. He
dreamed about a 6.9 quake â€” the strength
originally reported for the Oct. 17 quake.
Franz said he woke up at 4 a.m. and read
his earthquake brochures. That afternoon,
as he was walking out of Memorial Church
with the same friend, the quake hit.
Although most students have recovered
from their initial post-quake paranoia, par
ents are another story. Many have to be
reassured of the campus' safety.
"For a little while my dad wanted to
move. He was a lot more nervous [than I],"
said Toby Shimizu, a sophomore from Fre
mont. "I wasn't really freaked out until I
found out what happened around the Bay
area," she said.
Shimizu said she feels safer now on cam
pus because of all the precautions the Uni
versity is taking. However, she still gets
nervous if "someone walks upstairs and
something wiggles."
Bartol said his father, who was on the
West coast during the temblor, saw Wilbur
Hall still standing and had his fears allayed.
Shimizu'B roommate Mairi Dupar is a
sophomore from Scotland, where she said
there are no earthquakes. But Dupar likes
Stanford so much that the possibility of
earthquakes did not deter her return in the
fall.
Dupar is not worried about the "Big
One" because she heard a rumor that it is
going to hit farther down south. She admit
ted there is no basis for the rumor but finds
it comforting nonetheless. "We believe what
we like to believe," she said.
Dupar said although her parents are still
apprehensive about her safety, her mother,
who came to Stanford and knows "how
good it is," will never prevent her from com
ing back. "A lot of parents worry unneces
sarily," she asserted.
Senior Adam Chipkin was enrolled in the
overseas program in Spain last year and
said he "felt bad" about missing the quake.
Chipkin, who is from north San Francisco,
said he would feel better if he had been here
with his family and friends and learned
about their conditions right away.
Chipkin is glad to be back on campus and
feels safe. "I don't think California is going
to drop off in the ocean," he said.
