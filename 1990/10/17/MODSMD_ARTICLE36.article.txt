# Quake damaged University's image
## Fetter says some applicants may have shied away, but most did not

Earthquake-damaged buildings re
main eerily empty, surrounded by steel
fences. Sandstone archways are braced
with colorfully painted wooden sup
ports. Work continues daily to repair
millions of dollars worth of structural
damage.
But the damage Stanford suffered in
the Oct. 17 earthquake is not merely
structural or financial. The temblor also
changed the perspectives many students
in this year's freshman class had about
the Farm. Although these opinions may
have damaged the University in less
concrete ways than did the actual
quake, Stanford's public image is also
undergoing a process of repair.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter believes the earthquake had
some effect on last year's admissions
process but had difficulty estimating the
full extent of the consequences.
"As of October 3, 1990, we have had
100 more inquiries about undergradu
ate admissions than the same date in
1989, which was before the earth
quake," Fetter said. "Interest from high
school seniors and transfer students
looks to be the same as years past, and
might even be looking up."
In a survey of 248 admitted students
who chose not to attend Stanford, only 4

cited fear of earthquakes as a reason for
their decision, Fetter said.
The earthquake further complicated
the decision to attend Stanford for this
year's crop of freshmen. Many fresh
man, along with their parents and rela
tives, faced the frightening realization
that by attending Stanford, they might
be endangering themselves if another
"Big One" hits.

'[My family] seemed
more afraid of an
earthquake than I did.'

Caroline Kim, a freshman from
Urbana, 111., took the earthquake threat
seriously when considering Stanford as
her future home.
"After hearing all about the San
Francisco earthquake, I was quite
unnerved by the prospect of possibly liv
ing through one while here," Kim said.
"But I knew the benefits of being at
Stanford outweighed the fear of any
natural disaster.
"I did get all sorts of advice from
friends and relatives on what to do dur
ing an earthquake," she continued.

"But they seemed more afraid of an
earthquake than I did."
Michelle Friedland, a freshman from
Westfield, N.J., considered last year's
earthquake the "Big One."
"It wasn't until after the earthquake
that I seriously considered Stanford,"
she said. "After seeing how the school
recovered from the ordeal, I was assured
of the safety of being here."
The earthquake also has become the
focus of many questions asked of Stan
ford student tour guides. According to
Tricia Chang, program coordinator of
the Guide and Visitor Service, "Visitors
ask many questions about the damage
to buildings and other structures, espe
cially Memorial Church."
"Many of the [high school] seniors
visiting the campus ask about damage
to dorms and other housing," Chang
continued. "But we try not to over
emphasize the effects of the quake on
the tour. We have not altered the tour
since the quake and try not to scare off
any potential applicants with any seem
ingly frightening information."
Because natural disasters strike in a
variety of forms, every university is vul
nerable to catastrophe, Fetter said.
"Having just returned from the East
Coast, where hurricane warnings have
been in effect for the last few weeks, it
really comes down to choosing your dan
ger," she said.
