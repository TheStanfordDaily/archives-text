# University prepares for trauma of next temblor
## CAPS, Bridge stress long-term services 
### Peter Robison 
The Oct. 17 earthquake
wrought psychological as well as
physical damage on Stanford. One
year later, the University's coun
seling services are trying to use
what they learned from that expe
rience to prepare for the emo
tional damage another large
quake would cause.
Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, said his staff needs to be
aware that "people don't have the
same reactions [to earthquakes]."
"Those who are near the actual
damage are more likely to be dis
rupted psychologically," Martinez
said.
After the earthquake, CAPS
dealt with psychological trauma
in two primary ways — by setting
up a drop-in center at Tresidder
Union and by sending teams of
counselors to the residences to
discuss problems.
Very few students went to the
drop-in center, but Martinez said
it was important to provide the
service. "We need to have differ
ent resources," he said.
"The concept of a drop-in cen
ter will be an important resource
for students and faculty who
aren't dorm-based" in the event of
another large quake, Martinez
added.
Last year, teams of counselors
were designed to "go into the
dorms and offer support to both
staff and faculty," Martinez said.
Teams were organized after the
extent of the damage was deter
mined, he added.
In the future, the teams would
be important because they would
"give residents a forum for discus
sion in their own living space,"
said Doug Daher, a CAPS clinical
staff psychologist.
Martinez said the University's
psychological services are not as
important immediately after an
earthquake, when the physical
damage is still being assessed.
"Our service is most critical a few

days after the actual quake," he
explained. "Initially, people are
concerned with only the physical
damage."
"We need to be available to peo
ple on a long-term basis," he
noted.
Counselors at the Bridge, the
student-run peer counseling cen
ter, echoed Martinez's senti
ments. The Bridge received fewer
calls after last year's earthquake
than the staff expected. Most of
their calls were not received until
several days after the earthquake.
Students experienced a wide
range of different psychological
reactions to the earthquake,
Daher said.
Some students were both
"frightened" and "inconve
nienced" — forced to deal with
psychological effects while moving
out of their damaged residences,
he said. This group will be "more
[psychologically] vulnerable to
tremors" in the future, Daher
added.
"For some people, earth shak
ing represents a tremendous dis
ruption because of what it sym
bolizes — it's a disruption of the
very foundation of our lives,"
Daher said.
However, "The realization of
vulnerability may have been an
important growth experience," he
added. "These people may have
learned and benefited from their
experience."
The anniversary may lead to a
recurrence of emotional trauma
relating to the earthquake,
including such symptoms such as
irritability, worrying excessively
about earthquakes, mild nausea,
fear of being alone and alcohol or
substance abuse.
To combat this earthquake
stress, CAPS recommended talk
ing with others about thoughts
and memories, maintaining a
healthy diet, balancing school
work and rest, avoiding the use of
alcohol and drugs and taking the
time to heal.


The Oct. 17 earthquake stimulated a wide range of psychological reactlona from
Stanford students. Displaced students, like these residents of Columbae, may be psy
chologically vulnerable should another earthquake atrlke.
