# Frosh feel fake quake
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
A few of the rubbery, deep red globs Mar
garet Wong spread out on a table at the Stan
ford Police station had yellow spots. Others
contained tiny white protrusions.
"The yellow spots are festering burns, and
the white is broken bones," Wong, the Univer
sity's disaster preparedness coordinator, said
happily The red was obviously blood gushing
from an open gash.
The fake wounds, along with a gallon of fake
blood, were applied to the "injured" victims of
the "fake quake" in Twain House yesterday,
perhaps the most dramatic event at Stanford
commemorating the one-year anniversary of
the Oct. 17 earthquake.
To increase awareness of emergency proce
dures for a severe earthquake, Twain residents
and staff simulated earthquake responses by
evacuating the house and assisting their fellow
residents who were assigned roles of dead,
injured or missing persons.
"It's important to know the limitations of
emergency procedures under the conditions of
a severe earthquake," said Twain resident fel
low Valerie Phillips, one of the event's organiz
ers.
Along with the phony wounds on the iiyured
residents, macabre decorations transformed
the dormitory into an eerily real disaster area.
Rubble was scattered along the floors, and a
mural blocked off a staircase that had suppos
edly collapsed. Students wore charcoal-colored
make-up to simulate the dust and debris from
collapsed walls.
At 3:45 p.m. yesterday the fire alarm
sounded, signaling the beginning of the rum
bling of a severe quake — one measuring 8.0 or
more on the Richter scale. Emergency fire and
medical crews soon arrived as residents
assumed their roles.
The parts were distributed to the residents
last night. To avoid having the fake quake
appear staged, residents were not briefed on
how to act, according to Twain resident assis
tant Tracy Turner. Residence staff, who
received extensive training over the summer,
directed the rescue efforts.
The most sought-after role was probably
that of the psychologically traumatized.
"We have a lot of hams in our dorm," Phillips said
laughing.
Emergency personnel and RAs instructed the
unharmed students on other emergency routines,
including searching for the disabled and calming the
traumatized.
By 5:15 p.m. the missing had been found, the
dead zipped into body bags and the injured washed
up. Residents then met to discuss the afternoon's
events, and T-shirts Wong designed were distributed
to all participants. The T-shirts will also be on sale
this week, and proceeds will go to the earthquake
education fund.
Wong also helped organize a less glitzy yet equally
informative Quakefest in White Plaza today from 10
a.m. until noon. Vendors will sell earthquake sur
vival kits and local utilities will demonstrate home
safety tips for the aftermath of a major temblor.
A model of the 12 earthquake silos, underground
caches of medical supplies and food buried around
campus this summer will also be on display.
Observers will be able to sample the food stored in
the silos.
The Quakefest has taken place for the past five
years, except last year when it was scheduled for
Oct. 19, two days after the earthquake.
The idea for a simulated earthquake resulted
from meetings between the Stanford Police and sev
eral RFs after last year's earthquake.
Phillips said she and other RFs were concerned
they had not given the University their input on
dorm life when safety officials were formulating
emergency guidelines.
"The RFs wanted to shift the focus from securing
buildings to securing students," Phillips said.
After a few meetings on their own, three RFs
joined up with the Stanford Police and Housing and
Food Service Director Keith Guy in January to plan
the simulation. Since Phillips was the only RF on
campus over the summer when the plans were final
ized, Twain was the obvious location for the fake
quake.
Wong and Phillips said they hope the simulation
will heighten preparedness for the next earthquake.
Wong added that the simulation will probably be
held in a different house next year. Phillips said the
University is not finished formulating a complete
emergency response policy.
Before the simulation, Wong said she was worried
some of the students might be bothered it. But "I
hope it makes people think," she said. "And I hope
Twain will have a lot of fun with it."

The parts were distributed to the residents
last night. To avoid having the fake quake
appear staged, residents were not briefed on
how to act, according to Twain resident assis
tant Tracy Turner. Residence staff, who
received extensive training over the summer,
directed the rescue efforts.
The most sought-after role was probably
that of the psychologically traumatized.
"We have a lot of hams in our dorm," Phillips said
laughing.
Emergency personnel and RAs instructed the
unharmed students on other emergency routines,
including searching for the disabled and calming the
traumatized.
By 5:15 p.m. the missing had been found, the
dead zipped into body bags and the injured washed
up. Residents then met to discuss the afternoon's
events, and T-shirts Wong designed were distributed
to all participants. The T-shirts will also be on sale
this week, and proceeds will go to the earthquake
education fund.
Wong also helped organize a less glitzy yet equally
informative Quakefest in White Plaza today from 10
a.m. until noon. Vendors will sell earthquake sur
vival kits and local utilities will demonstrate home
safety tips for the aftermath of a major temblor.
A model of the 12 earthquake silos, underground
caches of medical supplies and food buried around
campus this summer will also be on display.
Observers will be able to sample the food stored in
the silos.
The Quakefest has taken place for the past five
years, except last year when it was scheduled for
Oct. 19, two days after the earthquake.
The idea for a simulated earthquake resulted
from meetings between the Stanford Police and sev
eral RFs after last year's earthquake.
Phillips said she and other RFs were concerned
they had not given the University their input on
dorm life when safety officials were formulating
emergency guidelines.
"The RFs wanted to shift the focus from securing
buildings to securing students," Phillips said.
After a few meetings on their own, three RFs
joined up with the Stanford Police and Housing and
Food Service Director Keith Guy in January to plan
the simulation. Since Phillips was the only RF on
campus over the summer when the plans were final
ized, Twain was the obvious location for the fake
quake.
Wong and Phillips said they hope the simulation
will heighten preparedness for the next earthquake.
Wong added that the simulation will probably be
held in a different house next year. Phillips said the
University is not finished formulating a complete
emergency response policy.
Before the simulation, Wong said she was worried
some of the students might be bothered it. But "I
hope it makes people think," she said. "And I hope
Twain will have a lot of fun with it."

Residents In Twain simulated the after-effects of a major earthquake yesterday, assist
ing "Injured" neighbors and evacuating the entire dormitory.
A few of the rubbery, deep red globs Mar
garet Wong spread out on a table at the Stan
ford Police station had yellow spots. Others
contained tiny white protrusions.
"The yellow spots are festering burns, and
the white is broken bones," Wong, the Univer
sity's disaster preparedness coordinator, said
happily The red was obviously blood gushing
from an open gash.
The fake wounds, along with a gallon of fake
blood, were applied to the "injured" victims of
the "fake quake" in Twain House yesterday,
perhaps the most dramatic event at Stanford
commemorating the one-year anniversary of
the Oct. 17 earthquake.
To increase awareness of emergency proce
dures for a severe earthquake, Twain residents
and staff simulated earthquake responses by
evacuating the house and assisting their fellow
residents who were assigned roles of dead,
injured or missing persons.
"It's important to know the limitations of
emergency procedures under the conditions of
a severe earthquake," said Twain resident fel
low Valerie Phillips, one of the event's organiz
ers.
Along with the phony wounds on the iiyured
residents, macabre decorations transformed
the dormitory into an eerily real disaster area.
Rubble was scattered along the floors, and a
mural blocked off a staircase that had suppos
edly collapsed. Students wore charcoal-colored
make-up to simulate the dust and debris from
collapsed walls.
At 3:45 p.m. yesterday the fire alarm
sounded, signaling the beginning of the rum
bling of a severe quake — one measuring 8.0 or
more on the Richter scale. Emergency fire and
medical crews soon arrived as residents
assumed their roles.
The parts were distributed to the residents
last night. To avoid having the fake quake
appear staged, residents were not briefed on
