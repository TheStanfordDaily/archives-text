## Superstardom can be yours

"This," as the man in the commercial says,
"you cannot do."
Yet we all do do it, don't we? When we play
these sports ourselves, we attempt to suspend
reality in our brains and imagine that we are
actually doing the things we can only dream
about. That is, until we miss the basket com
pletely, fall down on a swinging whiff, and trip
trying to avoid the first tackier.
This is the reason why so many millions of
people are rabid, incurable sports fans who will
watch any sport, no matter who's playing. It is
because we wish to see athletes do the impossi
ble, the things we cannot. As Michael Jordan
soars in to slam from the foul line or Jerry Rice
leaps high in the air to make the catch, we too
are lifted emotionally and re-enact the play in

our minds and in our dorm lounges. Only in
the replay, it is we who are the stars.
But there are those of us for whom mental
images are not enough. For these would-be
athletes, there exists the wonderful world of
"pseudosports."
Ybu may ask, in a scoffing tone, "What in
the heck is a 'pseudosport?' " A very good
question, and one that deserves a very
good answer. Luckily, I came up with one yes
terday.
A pseudosport is an activity that mimics a
real athletic sport, but in one way or another
distorts the parameters of that sport. Now, I
haven't exactly worked out all the kinks to this
definition, so I may wait awhile before sending
it off to Mr. Webster. But it'll do for now.
But I'm sure you need an explanation, or
better yet, an example. For Exhibit A, I give
you Wiffleball.
Wiffleball is basically baseball, but is played
with a thin plastic bat and a plastic ball with six
oblong holes punched through the top of it.
The theory goes that the ball was developed in
this form by a concerned father who wanted to
prevent his son from injuring his arm trying to
throw a curveball.
With a normal baseball, the wrist and arm
must twist at the point of release to impart the
spin necessary for the ball to curve. With a wif
fleball, you just throw the sucker straight, and
by the time it reaches its destination, it has
curved, looped, and slipped all over the place.
And for those of you who are still scoffing,
let me inform you that Kevin Mitchell, the
Giants' left-fielder who was the NL Most Valu
able Player in 1989, learned to hit the curveball
playing Wiffle. His grandmother pitched to
him (which shows you just how far the param
eters of this sport are stretched).
I'm sure that many of you have probably
played this game when you were a kid, or at
least seen it played somewhere. But, as another
ad says, "Have you played the game.. . lately?"
If you haven't, you're obviously missing out.
There is nothing like the sound of plastic meet
ing plastic, and watching the Wiffleball sail out
over the "fence" (actually a crack in the con
crete). Put Wade Boggs to shame as you grittily
foul off pitch after pitch before poking a single
past the diving pitcher. Don't watch the World
Series this weekend, a bag of chips which your
body doesn't need surgically attached to your
side. Get out and play!
I dabbled in Wiffle as a kid, but nothing pre
pared me for the high-intensity match-ups that
happened my freshman year in Madera, in
Wilbur Hall. We created our own stadium in
the courtyard out back, using only a little tape
(for the strikezone), and our imaginations.
There was hitting, pitching, and fielding —
only running bases was absent (a runner
advanced when "pushed" by another runner).
On this field (dubbed the "Gomer Dome,"
the world's only open-air dome, by the regu
lars), I spent many carefree, blow-off-the-read
ing hours at play. Something new always hap
pened, which usually required a quick re-eval
uation of the rules. There were tight pitching
matchups and knock-down slugfests. No-hit
ters were pitched. So were no-outers.
The players took on new identities. There
was "the Jayster," a smooth-moving gangly
youth from the streets of Queens who modelled
himself after Daryl Strawberry. "Slap" was a
hard thrower from the depths of Texas. Our
thesis-writing RA became the feared "Bun
head." I, a gamer from Seattle, was simply
"Hack," referring to my odd, one-handed swing
that appeared occasionally. My frosh roommate
still calls me that, three years later.
This was fun, but it was also serious stuff.
After months of play, some of us became good
pitchers who could pick at the corners of the
strikezone or throw the Linda Rondstat spe
cial, the "Blew-by-you" fastball. Others were
feared hitters, the kind you simply did not
throw a fastball over the plate to, unless you
wanted to watch it hit to Okada. Yet new play
ers were always welcome, and some people who
we thought had never played sports turned out
to be great athletes who perhaps just didn't
like the competition of serious athletics (as
pick-up hoops often turns out to be).
I kept playing after that memorable year.
The Jayster and I came back as Orientation
Volunteers the next year and taught the new
crop of Maderans the game. New stars were

reunited in a best-of-seven Wiffle
World Series. We created two neu
tral fields, one in back of the Mir
rielees Apartments and one in
front of Littlefield Memorial at
the Biz School.
Despite a break in play due to
the earthquake (although, unlike
the real thing, we weren't on the
field when the quake struck), we
had a great, exciting series.

Wiffle is my sport of choice,
but the world of pseu
dosports is by no means
limited. That's the beauty of it —
just dowhatchalike. Wanna be
Charles Barkley? Go to the grade
school behind Rains where there
are eight-foot hoops and dunk
and rebound to your heart's con
tent. Can't spike like Kristin
Klein? Set up your own net, at
your own height.
Why play IM football (or
worse, tackle, at which I lost a
tooth sophomore year — yet
another good reason for pseu
dosports) when you can play with
a Nerf and anywhere from one to
10 friends? Frisbee golf is a great
pseudosport that combines a very

"serious pastime" with a recre
ational item. Or how about stick
ball? The New York street game
requires just a rubber ball and
long piece of wood. Remember
that Hank Aaron got his start
swinging a broomstick at bottle
caps.
As yet another ad says, the
only limit is your own imagina
tion. For most of us at this school,
that really should be no limit at
all.

Hack's column appears every
Wednesday. He dares you to
abandon your TV and try to hit
off him and the Jayster on the
Mirrielees field Friday evenings
at sp.m.
