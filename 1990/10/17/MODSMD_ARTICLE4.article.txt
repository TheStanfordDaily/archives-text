# Stanford self-study finds no wrongdoing on indirect costs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
An internal audit of Stanford's indi
rect cost practices released yesterday
found no wrongdoing on the part of the
University.
The finding comes as two federal agen
cies are investigating Stanford's indirect
cost policies. At least one of the investiga
tions was apparently prompted by
charges of "fraud" and "abuse" made by a
federal regulator assigned to Stanford.
Indirect costs are those costs incurred

by researchers but not attributable to a
specific project. The U.S. government
reimburses Stanford for the indirect costs
of federally sponsored research here.
While Stanford's self-study found no
impropriety, it did note indirect cost nego
tiations between Stanford and the gov
ernment have been characterized by a
lack of timeliness on both sides.
In a statement yesterday, University
President Donald Kennedy said he has
instructed William Massy, the Univer
sity's chief financial officer, "to take steps
to ensure that Stanford's future partici

pation in the rate-setting process is
timely and well-documented."
In a March 6 letter addressed but
never sent to his superior, Paul Biddle,
the Office of Naval Research's regulator
assigned to Stanford, raised several ques
tions about the validity of several "special
studies" the University had conducted in
past years to justify some indirect cost
reimbursements.
The internal audit found no justifica
tion for those concerns. According to the
report, "the rationale for, the assump
tions made in and the methodology used

by Stanford in generating these docu
ments are adequate and appropriate."
The internal study, however, details
repeated delays during the last decade in
the negotiation and auditing of Stan
ford's indirect costs. The ONR is the fed
eral agency that negotiates with the Uni
versity to determine its indirect cost rate.
The Defense Contracting Auditing
Agency is responsible for auditing the
indirect cost recovery Stanford receives.
The ONR launched its investigation of
Stanford following Biddle's assertions.
The internal report notes that Stan

ford has on several occasions missed an
established March deadline for submit
ting proposals on its indirect cost rate to
the DCAA. Four of the nine submissions
between 1981 and 1988 were dated after
March, the internal report notes.
"The University has routinely
requested extensions of an additional 90
days because it feels the deadline is nei
ther required nor practicable," according
to the study
The DCAA has often taken years to
