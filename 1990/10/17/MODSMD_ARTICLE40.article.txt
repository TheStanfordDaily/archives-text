The Cardinal women's golf team is hang
ing on to a one-shot lead over Oklahoma
going into the final round of the Edean
Ihlandfeldt Invitational in Seattle.
"The girls played really tough," said
coach Tim Baldwin. "They were all strong

Audrey Wooding tied with Ellen Mielke
of Oklahoma for the fourth-best round of
the day, shooting a 76. Wooding still leads
the tournament by three with a score of 149
after 36 holes.
"I didn't do as well as yesterday," said
Wooding. "I didn't make as many putts.
Overall, though, I felt good and played
pretty solid.
"Tomorrow I just need to play smart and
keep my head on straight."
Cardinal golfers Stephanie Davis, Adele
Moore and Jodi Figley are tied with 156
after two rounds. Yesterday Davis shot 77,
Moore got 78 and Figley shot 80.
"I hit the ball really well, except that I
had 37 putts which did the round in," said
Moore, who also shot a 78 Monday.
"Nothing went in for me, but I think I
played better today. Golf is funny in that
you can shoot the same score but feel like
you played better.
"There are some things with my swing
that I need to work on. At this point, the
tournament is more of a learning experi
ence for me. I fell apart at the end today."
Rookie freshman Melinda Daniels is also
treating this tournament as a learning
experience. "I'm not going to be too hard on
myself because this is my first big tourna
ment. Also, it is the first time I've played a
tournament in the rain." Daniels shot 90 in
the first round and 89 in the second.
"Today I tried to concentrate more. I
wasn't as nervous and I tried to play safe,
not go for long shots. My driver was work
ing well, but I hope I shoot better tomor

row. The course is really long and narrow."
Daniels wasn't the only one dealing with
the inclement weather. According to Bald
win, "We played through rain, hail and cold.
The conditions were very difficult. It didn't
clear until late in the day."
The hard rains at night made the course
really wet. "The water makes the course
longer because the ball doesn't have as
much roll," said Moore.

'Tomorrow I just need to
play smart and keep my
head on straight.'

To compensate for this, the women
played "winter rules". This means they can
lift the ball, clean it off and place it back
within six inches of where it landed.
Naturally, the Northwest rain is
expected to continue today, but the Cardi
nal women are not distracted.
"Our goal is definitely to win the tourna
ment. It would be our first win since my
freshman year in Hawaii," said Moore.
"We need to all stay focused — every
shot counts and good putts," said Wooding.
"Oklahoma will be tough. They are in
the mood to get strokes on us." Yesterday
the Sooners narrowed the Cardinal lead
with outstanding performances by Mielke
and Beth Brown.
"Oklahoma played much better today,"
Moore said.
Baldwin said,"They're a strong team but
I really look for good things. I think we're
going to get some really solid golf cut of
Audrey, Adele, Jodi and Stephanie. In fact,
I'm very confident of it. I can't control what
Oklahoma does, but you can count on these
four."
