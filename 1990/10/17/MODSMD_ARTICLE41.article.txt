# Huskies will try to run for the Roses Saturday
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Contestants: the Cardinal backfield vs. the Husky
defensive line.
Battle: Saturday, Oct. 20, Stanford Stadium.
Prize: game victory.
When Pacific 10 Conference leader Washington
comes sauntering onto the Farm Saturday, the con
test may very well be decided by the run. As in how
much Stanford gains on the ground and to what
extent Washington snuffs out the Cardinal's poten
tial.
It just might be that simple.
The Huskies are leading the nation in run
defense. Basically, no one gets through its eight-man
forest. No one. Not USC's Ricky Ervins. Not San
Jose State's Sheldon Canley. Last week, Washington
held Oregon to a team team total of seven yards, and
forced them to cough up three fumbles. For the sea
son the Huskies have allowed a meager 42 yards a
contest on the ground, and that includes the mental
lapse against Colorado when Eric Bieniemy was
allowed to power for 143 yards.
Stanford, on the other hand, must establish the
run. Although the Cardinal gained 360 yards
through the air last week, it lost. And, according to
coach Denny Green, the Cardinal's talented back
field must find a way to break loose. No Glyn Mil
burn and Tommy Vardell yards, no "W." A single
front attack just won't do it in the Pac-10 these days.
"A combination of rushing offense and rushing
defense usually spells success," Green said. "You
force people to a passing game and you control the
game.
"Therefore, we have to get a run going. Our rush
ing attack hasn't been what we want it to be the past
few weeks. We need to get the run going to be suc
cessful."
But even if Stanford does find a way to get Mil
burn and Vardell across the line of scrimmage, it
may not be easy street. Washington's defensive tal
ent does not stop with its linebackers.
The Huskies also lead the conference in total
defense, as well as in scoring defense. While the
squad has given up a few more yards through the air
than on the ground, it still ranks first in the Pac-10
in pass defense efficiency. Multiple sacks, intercep

For the Cardinal to leavel its Pac-10 record at 2-2 this Saturday, the team will need to have a lot of
success running the football. Ellery Roberts and his backfleld mates will have a tough time of it
against the conference's top run defense.
tions and deflections are just a
regular day for the Husky D.
The story here is its blitz.
Coach Don James often puts all
his iparbles in one bag — and
usually wins. By concentrating on
the passer, defensive end Travis
Richardon and Co. have creamed
some pretty respectable signal
callers 20 times in five games.
Just last weekend they brought
Heisman Trophy candidate Bill
Musgrave to reality four times.
"It's not any one guy. They
have a very balanced eight-man
front," Green said. "Any one of
those guys can make a sack, so if
you have one missed assignment
it allows them to make a play."
Green, however, is actually
welcoming the Huskies' deadly
blitzing corps. He's looking for
Stanford success to come when

Washington goes for Jason
Palumbis.
"A big part will be getting
Washington to blitz," said Green.
"The outcome of the game may
rest on how successfully we play
one-one-one in these situations.
[Wide receiver Ed] McCaffrey is
very difficult to cover one-on
one."
"They blitz a lot and play man
coverage, and we're best as a
receiving corps when teams play
man," added wide receiver Jon
Pinckney.
So what exactly does all this
ofTense-defense stand-off really
signify?
"The key will be us making big
plays," said Green. "They are
going to play big-play defense. We
need to have more big plays on
offense than they do on defense."
Great. But where does Wash
ington's offense come into the pic
ture?
Granted, the Huskies are lead
ing the Pac-10 for their defensive

abilites — it's hard to win when
you're only allowed to score 14
points. And quarterback Mark
Brunell does have a measely 47-
percent completion percentage.
But you can't forget Greg
Lewis. As in Heisman Candidate,
No. 1 rusher in the Pac-10 Greg
Lewis. He's only averaging 135
yards a game. And is the first per
son since Marcus Allen to rush for
over 100 yards every week for a
season. He galloped over the
Ducks for another 165 last week.
Oh. Him.
"He's a very strong power
back, very shifty. We really need
to attack [him] at the line of
scrimmage. He's not the type of
guy you can knock down very eas
ily," Green said.
Whether or not Stanford gets
him at the line, however, it still
has to grind out its own yards on
the ground against the nation's
stingiest team.

much Stanford gains on the ground and to what
extent Washington snuffs out the Cardinal's poten
tial.
It just might be that simple.
The Huskies are leading the nation in run
defense. Basically, no one gets through its eight-man
forest. No one. Not USC's Ricky Ervins. Not San
Jose State's Sheldon Canley. Last week, Washington
held Oregon to a team team total of seven yards, and
forced them to cough up three fumbles. For the sea
son the Huskies have allowed a meager 42 yards a
contest on the ground, and that includes the mental
lapse against Colorado when Eric Bieniemy was
allowed to power for 143 yards.
Stanford, on the other hand, must establish the
run. Although the Cardinal gained 360 yards
through the air last week, it lost. And, according to
coach Denny Green, the Cardinal's talented back
field must find a way to break loose. No Glyn Mil
burn and Tommy Vardell yards, no "W." A single
front attack just won't do it in the Pac-10 these days.
"A combination of rushing offense and rushing
defense usually spells success," Green said. "You
force people to a passing game and you control the
game.
"Therefore, we have to get a run going. Our rush
ing attack hasn't been what we want it to be the past
few weeks. We need to get the run going to be suc
cessful."
But even if Stanford does find a way to get Mil
burn and Vardell across the line of scrimmage, it
may not be easy street. Washington's defensive tal
ent does not stop with its linebackers.
The Huskies also lead the conference in total
defense, as well as in scoring defense. While the
squad has given up a few more yards through the air
than on the ground, it still ranks first in the Pac-10
in pass defense efficiency. Multiple sacks, intercep


Damlan Marhefka — Dally file
For the Cardinal to leavel its Pac-10 record at 2-2 this Saturday, the team will need to have a lot of
success running the football. Ellery Roberts and his backfleld mates will have a tough time of it
against the conference's top run defense.
tions and deflections are just a
regular day for the Husky D.
The story here is its blitz.
Coach Don James often puts all
his iparbles in one bag — and
usually wins. By concentrating on
the passer, defensive end Travis
Richardon and Co. have creamed
some pretty respectable signal
callers 20 times in five games.
Just last weekend they brought
Heisman Trophy candidate Bill
Musgrave to reality four times.
"It's not any one guy. They
have a very balanced eight-man
front," Green said. "Any one of
those guys can make a sack, so if
you have one missed assignment
it allows them to make a play."
Green, however, is actually
welcoming the Huskies' deadly
blitzing corps. He's looking for
Stanford success to come when

Washington goes for Jason
Palumbis.
"A big part will be getting
Washington to blitz," said Green.
"The outcome of the game may
rest on how successfully we play
one-one-one in these situations.
[Wide receiver Ed] McCaffrey is
very difficult to cover one-on
one."
"They blitz a lot and play man
coverage, and we're best as a
receiving corps when teams play
man," added wide receiver Jon
Pinckney.
So what exactly does all this
ofTense-defense stand-off really
signify?
"The key will be us making big
plays," said Green. "They are
going to play big-play defense. We
need to have more big plays on
offense than they do on defense."
Great. But where does Wash
ington's offense come into the pic
ture?
Granted, the Huskies are lead
ing the Pac-10 for their defensive

abilites — it's hard to win when
you're only allowed to score 14
points. And quarterback Mark
Brunell does have a measely 47-
percent completion percentage.
But you can't forget Greg
Lewis. As in Heisman Candidate,
No. 1 rusher in the Pac-10 Greg
Lewis. He's only averaging 135
yards a game. And is the first per
son since Marcus Allen to rush for
over 100 yards every week for a
season. He galloped over the
Ducks for another 165 last week.
Oh. Him.
"He's a very strong power
back, very shifty. We really need
to attack [him] at the line of
scrimmage. He's not the type of
guy you can knock down very eas
ily," Green said.
Whether or not Stanford gets
him at the line, however, it still
has to grind out its own yards on
the ground against the nation's
stingiest team.
Run offense vs. run defense.
For 15 rounds.
Contestants: the Cardinal backfield vs. the Husky
defensive line.
Battle: Saturday, Oct. 20, Stanford Stadium.
Prize: game victory.
