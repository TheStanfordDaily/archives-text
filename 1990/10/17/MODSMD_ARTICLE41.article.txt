Contestants: the Cardinal backfield vs. the Husky
defensive line.
Battle: Saturday, Oct. 20, Stanford Stadium.
Prize: game victory.
When Pacific 10 Conference leader Washington
comes sauntering onto the Farm Saturday, the con
test may very well be decided by the run. As in how
much Stanford gains on the ground and to what
extent Washington snuffs out the Cardinal's poten
tial.
It just might be that simple.
The Huskies are leading the nation in run
defense. Basically, no one gets through its eight-man
forest. No one. Not USC's Ricky Ervins. Not San
Jose State's Sheldon Canley. Last week, Washington
held Oregon to a team team total of seven yards, and
forced them to cough up three fumbles. For the sea
son the Huskies have allowed a meager 42 yards a
contest on the ground, and that includes the mental
lapse against Colorado when Eric Bieniemy was
allowed to power for 143 yards.
Stanford, on the other hand, must establish the
run. Although the Cardinal gained 360 yards
through the air last week, it lost. And, according to
coach Denny Green, the Cardinal's talented back
field must find a way to break loose. No Glyn Mil
burn and Tommy Vardell yards, no "W." A single
front attack just won't do it in the Pac-10 these days.
"A combination of rushing offense and rushing
defense usually spells success," Green said. "You
force people to a passing game and you control the
game.
"Therefore, we have to get a run going. Our rush
ing attack hasn't been what we want it to be the past
few weeks. We need to get the run going to be suc
cessful."
But even if Stanford does find a way to get Mil
burn and Vardell across the line of scrimmage, it
may not be easy street. Washington's defensive tal
ent does not stop with its linebackers.
The Huskies also lead the conference in total
defense, as well as in scoring defense. While the
squad has given up a few more yards through the air
than on the ground, it still ranks first in the Pac-10
in pass defense efficiency. Multiple sacks, intercep

For the Cardinal to leavel its Pac-10 record at 2-2 this Saturday, the team will need to have a lot of
success running the football. Ellery Roberts and his backfleld mates will have a tough time of it
against the conference's top run defense.
