# Rijo outduels Stewart in game one
## Reds get the jump on Oakland with 7-0 victory

CINCINNATI (AP) - The A's aren't
invincible, after all.
The Cincinnati Reds shocked Oak
land and maybe even themselves last
night, routing the Athletics 7-0 in
Game 1 of the World Series.
It was Jose Rijo who was awesome,
not Dave Stewart.
Rijo, a former Athletics prospect,
pitched seven shutout innings and
ended Oakland's 10-game winning
streak in the postseason, while
Stewart was wild from the start and
lasted only four innings.
It was Eric Davis who got the big
hit, not Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire
or the rest of Oakland's bruisers.
Davis, Cincinnati's slumping star
who has been bothered by a sore left
shoulder and aching wrists and ankles,
pierced the A's aura right away with
a two-run homer in the first inning.
It was Billy Hatcher who provided
the spark, not Rickey Henderson.
Hatcher went 3-for-3 with two dou
bles and a walk, and led an aggressive
attack on the bases. Henderson did
have three hits, including two doubles.

but nothing he did matched what
Hatcher did for the Reds.
Most of all, it was the underdog
Reds, not the top-dog Athletics. By
the fourth inning, Cincinnati led 4-0
— matching the total number of runs
the A's gave up in sweeping Boston
in the American League playoffs —
and by the time Rob Dibble relieved
Rijo to start the eighth, it was over
and it matched Oakland's worst
shutout defeat of the season.
Cincinnati's victory put the World
Series in a different light. Color it Red,
for now.
For the Athletics, it was not a devas
tating defeat — not like the Kirk Gib
son game in the 1988 World Series,
from which they never recovered. But
it did show that baseball's winningest
team could not win them all.
Only two teams, the New York
Yankees in 1927-28 and 1938-39, had
swept consecutive World Series. Those
Babe Ruth-led clubs also won a record
12 straight postseason games.
Oakland will try to start a one-game
winning streak Wednesday night in

Game 2 when Bob Welch faces Danny
Jackson. Stewart, a 22-game winner
this season, and Welch, who won 27,
made consecutive starts 29 times this
year and only twice lost both.
Cincinnati only outhit the Athletics
10-9, but made a lot more of what it
got.
Davis, who hit .174 in the National
League playoffs and failed to get the
ball out of the infield in 18 of 23
at-bats, drove in three runs and Chris
Sabo's two-run single capped a three
run fifth that made it 7-0.
The Athletics, less imposing without
designated hitter Harold Baines, had
their chances and did nothing with
them. They left runners at first and
third in three innings and, after bat
ting .343 with the bases loaded this
season, stranded three runners in the
fifth when McGwire popped out.
Oakland has 21 players who have
been in the World Series, compared to
just one for Cincinnati. Still, the Reds
were the ones who were cool while the
A's were jittery.
Stewart fell behind on nearly every

hitter in the early going, and it cost
him. He walked Hatcher with one out
in the first and Davis hit a two-out
homer deep over the center-field fence.
Earlier this week, Reds manager
Lou Piniella asked Davis to consider
moving from the fourth spot in the
lineup to leadoff. Davis rejected the
idea, saying he was meant to bat
cleanup, and then proved it.
Stewart, who waa working on five
days' rest, worked around two more
walks in the second, and walked Barry
Larkin to start the third. Hatcher fol
lowed with an RBI-double and took
third when shortstop Mike Gallego,
playing in place of injured Walt Weiss,
threw wildly to the plate.
A chop to the right side of the mound
by Paul O'Neill scored Hatcher, and
Stewart left after the fourth.
Stewart, who was starting the
opening game of the World Series for
the third straight year, had won six
straight postseason games; only Bob
Gibson's seven-game streak was
