# ASSU fee refunds now computerized
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
After two days in operation, the revised
ASSU fee refund reimbursement system has
received student responses ranging from luke
warm praise to outright anger.
"It seems like people aren't that thrilled
about the new system," said ASSU financial
manager Torrence Boone, who devised the
computerized form for fee refunds this sum
mer to make the system cheaper and more
convenient.
Beginning Monday afternoon, students
have been able to come into the ASSU office
and fill out a computerized form indicating
which parts of their ASSU fees they would like
refunded. However, refunds will not be avail
able until the end of the quarter.
On the table where the forms are kept,
there is a sheet on which students can com
ment on the new program. As of yesterday
afternoon, most comments criticized the sys
tem harshly.
Earlier this month, the ASSU Senate
approved a bill which allowed the timing of the
fee refunds to be moved back to the end of this
quarter in order to give Boone more time to
implement his system.
When the bill was approved, several sena
tors expressed reservations about the delay.
Other senators asked Boone to include a com
ponent in his system that would allow stu

dents to request that their fee refunds be
mailed to them. About 10 percent of the
refunds will be mailed at the end of this quar
ter to students who requested that option,
Boone said.
One comment called the new system "much
more inefficient and impractical."
Brad Lanning, a sophomore who filled out
his form yesterday, agreed that the system was
a hassle for students. "It just seems like a lot
of extra work," he said. "It's probably more
convenient for the ASSU, but it's not more
convenient for us."
Not all students reacted negatively to the
new system, however. Junior Matt Kratter,
who filled out his form yesterday, said he liked
the option of having a check mailed to him.
Another student wrote on the comment
sheet, "This is far too time consuming —
hardly worth the bother — or was that the
idea?"
Boone completely rejected what he called
the "false conception" that the new system
was a political move designed to deter stu
dents from collecting fee refunds.
"The change has no political implications,"
he said. It has administrative implications.
People don't realize the internal problems that
existed with the previous system."
He noted two problems — the time involved
in staff training and the "huge liability issue"

of having $30,000 to $40,000 in the ASSU's
sqFG
Other student comments asked to have
their refunds in cash right away, and one stu
dent wrote that he took more refunds as com
pensation for the "added inconveniences" of
the new system.
Boone said the system will be fully in place
earlier next quarter, and students should
receive their checks during the normal time
period, the third and fourth weeks of the quar
ter. He also said the money the ASSU saves
under the new system will eventually trans
late into reduced student fees.
Senator Kim Walsh had warm praise for
the new system. "Torrence has done a great
job," she said, citing the efficiency and thrift of
the new process. "It's a much improved sys
tem."
Students also raised the issue of confiden
tiality of the forms. Until today, students have
had the option of mailing in their fllled-out
forms or placing them on a pile on a table in
the ASSU, which were picked up every 15 to
20 minutes.
But in response to complaints from sena
tors and other students about the question of
confidentiality, Boone announced at last
night's senate meeting that the forms would
be placed in a closed "institutionalized drop
off box."
