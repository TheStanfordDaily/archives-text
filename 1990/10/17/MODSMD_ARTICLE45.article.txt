# Scholar predicts war in Persian Gulf
## 
### Dan Stearns 
Daniel Pipes, a specialist on Middle
East affairs, surprised his audience last
night by predicting war in the Persian
Gulf rather than sticking to his adver
tised topic — the relationship between
the United States and Israel.
"U.S.-Israeli relations are a sideshow
to the conflict in the Middle East," Pipes
told the audience in Kresge Auditorium.
"I believe the future of the Middle East
hinges on the outcome of this confronta
tion."
Pipes' talk focused on what he con
siders the inevitability of war in the
Gulf. "With great reluctance I think we
should use force," he said. "It's either
war now, or a big war later."
Pipes currently serves as director of
the Foreign Policy Research Institute
and editor of Orbis, a quarterly journal.
He previously worked for the U.S. State
Department.

His talk opened with a brief history of
Kuwait, followed by a description of the
younger, more populous nation of Iraq.
He listed three reasons for Iraqi Presi
dent Saddam Hussein's invading
Kuwait.
"He wanted 10 percent of the world's
oil reserves to pay his country's $80 bil
lion debt," Pipes said.
In addition, he said Saddam views
the United States as a threat to auton
omy in the Middle East. Because of the
Soviet Union's recent decline as an eco
nomic superpower, the United States
can exercise greater influence in the
Gulf region to meet its oil needs, he
added.
Finally,"he thought he could get
away with it," Pipes said, adding that
Saddam has "a limited understanding"
of world politics.
"Saddam is an unpredictable, highly
imaginative character," Pipes said. "He
has had so many opportunities to with-

draw, and he has not. I am inclined to
think he will use force."
A number of audience members
pointed out in the discussion afterward
that an Iraqi attack against Israel might
sway many Arab nations to Iraq's side.
Concerning US. military options,
Pipes listed withdrawal, an air attack
and a joint air and ground force attack
as possibilities. "The aerial bombard
ment is our type of thing," he said. "It is
long-range and it is high-tech."
Pipes estimated that using the U.S.
military in combat could result in up to
50,000 American casualties, and he said
he believes the Persian Gulf could see
war as soon as mid-November.
"The American build-up ends this
week," he said. "The climate (in the
Gulf) is cooling down, and U.S. elections
will be over then."
Pipes is also the author of six books,
including "The Rushdie Affair: the
Novel, the Ayatollah and the West."
