# Manley, protesters heading for court
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Five demonstrators pleaded
innocent yesterday to charges
stemming from an Aug. 30 sit-in
at Hoover Tower protesting Uni
versity layoffs.
After a 100-person march from
Tresidder, the five locked them
selves into the Herbert Hoover
room and sat on the rug in front
of the desk Hoover once used.
They were arrested and charged
with unlawful assembly, refusal to
disperse and misdemeanor tres
passing.
The protesters include Political
Science Prof. John Manley, who
has been a vocal supporter of
many USW causes; USW officials
Sammy Brooks and Reuben
Serna; and USW members Linda
Crouse and Ray Henson, two for
mer custodians at Tresidder.
Yesterday, in Palo Alto Munici
pal Court, USW lawyer Jim Eggle
ston entered a plea of "not guilty"
on all counts for the five. The
demonstrators must return to the
court Dec. 13 for a pretrial hear
ing, when a date for a jury trial
will be set.
"We got arrested to uphold a

higher standard for the
University," Manley said in a
statement on behalf of the
protesters. "Our peaceful civil dis
obedience was in self-defense of
workers'jobs and livelihoods."
Crouse and Henson, along with
six other Tresidder workers, were
laid off Aug. 31 as part of Univer
sity-wide repositioning. In all, 71
Stanford workers — 16 of whom
were USW members — were laid
off.
The University has replaced
the workers with a union contrac
tor, American Building Mainte
nance, to handle janitorial ser
vices. Keith Smith, acting man
ager of employee relations, said
financial projections show the
University will save $112,000 by
hiring the new contractor.
Smith said a task force com
posed of managers, faculty, stu
dents and staff — including one
USW member — determined a
need for cuts at Tresidder and
that an outside contractor was
necessary. Although management
had "ultimate responsibility," he
said, the decision was made with
the task force's input.
A statement released by the
Office of Human Resources to all

Stanford employees Aug. 30 said
using an outside contractor would
allow Tresidder "to avoid spend
ing money on janitorial equip
ment" and "provide more flexibil
ity in building operation hours by
making janitorial service available
24 hours a day." In addition, it
would streamline managers'
responsibilities.
But, according to Crouse, the
layoff of the eight Tresidder work
ers — some of whom have been
working here for more than 20
years — is an example of poor
judgment and financial misman
agement.
Crouse called Tresidder "a
microcosm of what is going on in
the rest of the campus," saying
that the repositioning is not cost
effective.
However, she expressed con
cern that some new workers are
earning "near-poverty-level"
wages, at only $7 an hour. Some
Tresidder workers used to make
$10 or $11 an hour, she said.
The "equivalent wages" clause
is open to interpretation by Amer
ican Building Maintenance since
it does not call for "identical"
wages, Smith said.
Eggleston said the idea that the
new contractor will save money is
a "bogus myth" because sever
ance pay and conversion costs will
end up costing the University
more than it will save.
The USW had proposed elimi
nating two upper-level manage
ment positions at Tresidder
which, Crouse said, are "basically

paper-pushers."
According to Crouse, the com
bined salaries of the two man
agers equal the total salaries of
the eight displaced workers. The
proposal was turned down.
In addition, Eggleston said the
"callous" layoff of the workers is a
violation of the Stanford-USW
contract.
But Smith said the University
has not violated the contract.
"Our contract with the USW stip
ulates exactly how laid-off
employees are to be treated,
including cases of employees laid
off because we contracted work
out," he said.
The contract states if the Uni
versity hires an outside contrac
tor, "the contractor is obligated to
offer employment at substantially
equivalent wages to the laid-off
workers, to the extent" the work
ers possess the ability to perform
the job without additional train
ing.
Of the eight Tresidder work
ers, three took jobs with the new
contractor, three have exercised
their contractual rights by
"bumping" other Stanford
employees with less seniority, one
has retired and Crouse is doing
volunteer work in the union
office.
Smith said the University's
objective "is to place as many peo
ple as possible" within the Uni
versity before they are laid off.
Thirty-two of the workers who
were scheduled to be laid off were
placed in other campus jobs.

dents and staff — including one
USW member — determined a
need for cuts at Tresidder and
that an outside contractor was
necessary. Although management
had "ultimate responsibility," he
said, the decision was made with
the task force's input.
A statement released by the
Office of Human Resources to all

Stanford employees Aug. 30 said
using an outside contractor would
allow Tresidder "to avoid spend
ing money on janitorial equip
ment" and "provide more flexibil
ity in building operation hours by
making janitorial service available
24 hours a day." In addition, it
would streamline managers'
responsibilities.
But, according to Crouse, the
layoff of the eight Tresidder work
ers — some of whom have been
working here for more than 20
years — is an example of poor
judgment and financial misman
agement.
Crouse called Tresidder "a
microcosm of what is going on in
the rest of the campus," saying
that the repositioning is not cost
effective.
However, she expressed con
cern that some new workers are
earning "near-poverty-level"
wages, at only $7 an hour. Some
Tresidder workers used to make
$10 or $11 an hour, she said.
The "equivalent wages" clause
is open to interpretation by Amer
ican Building Maintenance since
it does not call for "identical"
wages, Smith said.
Eggleston said the idea that the
new contractor will save money is
a "bogus myth" because sever
ance pay and conversion costs will
end up costing the University
more than it will save.
The USW had proposed elimi
nating two upper-level manage
ment positions at Tresidder
which, Crouse said, are "basically

paper-pushers."
According to Crouse, the com
bined salaries of the two man
agers equal the total salaries of
the eight displaced workers. The
proposal was turned down.
In addition, Eggleston said the
"callous" layoff of the workers is a
violation of the Stanford-USW
contract.
But Smith said the University
has not violated the contract.
"Our contract with the USW stip
ulates exactly how laid-off
employees are to be treated,
including cases of employees laid
off because we contracted work
out," he said.
The contract states if the Uni
versity hires an outside contrac
tor, "the contractor is obligated to
offer employment at substantially
equivalent wages to the laid-off
workers, to the extent" the work
ers possess the ability to perform
the job without additional train
ing.
Of the eight Tresidder work
ers, three took jobs with the new
contractor, three have exercised
their contractual rights by
"bumping" other Stanford
employees with less seniority, one
has retired and Crouse is doing
volunteer work in the union
office.
Smith said the University's
objective "is to place as many peo
ple as possible" within the Uni
versity before they are laid off.
Thirty-two of the workers who
were scheduled to be laid off were
placed in other campus jobs.
Five demonstrators pleaded
innocent yesterday to charges
stemming from an Aug. 30 sit-in
at Hoover Tower protesting Uni
versity layoffs.
After a 100-person march from
Tresidder, the five locked them
selves into the Herbert Hoover
room and sat on the rug in front
of the desk Hoover once used.
They were arrested and charged
with unlawful assembly, refusal to
disperse and misdemeanor tres
passing.
The protesters include Political
Science Prof. John Manley, who
has been a vocal supporter of
many USW causes; USW officials
Sammy Brooks and Reuben
Serna; and USW members Linda
Crouse and Ray Henson, two for
mer custodians at Tresidder.
Yesterday, in Palo Alto Munici
pal Court, USW lawyer Jim Eggle
ston entered a plea of "not guilty"
on all counts for the five. The
demonstrators must return to the
court Dec. 13 for a pretrial hear
ing, when a date for a jury trial
will be set.
"We got arrested to uphold a

higher standard for the
University," Manley said in a
statement on behalf of the
protesters. "Our peaceful civil dis
obedience was in self-defense of
workers'jobs and livelihoods."
Crouse and Henson, along with
six other Tresidder workers, were
laid off Aug. 31 as part of Univer
sity-wide repositioning. In all, 71
Stanford workers — 16 of whom
were USW members — were laid
off.
The University has replaced
the workers with a union contrac
tor, American Building Mainte
nance, to handle janitorial ser
vices. Keith Smith, acting man
ager of employee relations, said
financial projections show the
University will save $112,000 by
hiring the new contractor.
