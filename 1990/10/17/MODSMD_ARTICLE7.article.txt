# Kennedy gives senate address
## Alcohol, mascots, Harvard presidency among topics 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Addressing last night's ASSU Senate meeting,
University President Donald Kennedy answered a
variety of questions ranging from financial aid to the
alcohol policy.
But Kennedy spent most of his time commenting
on issues that haven't been in the headlines.
Kennedy left open the possibility for "renewed
discussion" on the presence of ROTC at Stanford,
presented a list of prerequisites for a new Stanford
mascot and said there was "zero" chance of his
becoming president of "Stanford of the East."
In the opening remarks of his quarterly address to
the senate, Kennedy described some areas he is cur
rently focusing on, including the Centennial Cam
paign, indirect cost recovery issues, and the reorga
nization and "new governance structure" for the
University.
But, he emphasized, the administrative responsi
bilities of his job are not his favorite role. He
described his position as being "half manager and
half principal," adding, "I really like the principal
part better."
Kennedy answered about a dozen questions from
senators and the Council of Presidents.
Graduate senator David Bradfute thanked
Kennedy for his help in changing the University's
policy on rights for domestic partners of unmarried
gay, lesbian and heterosexual students. Applause fol
lowed.
Bradfute then questioned the University's
involvement with "programs that discriminate
against gay and lesbian students." He cited compa
nies and organizations that recruit at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, as well as ROTC, as
examples of such programs.
In an extended response, Kennedy invited Brad
fute to submit to him "a thoughtful argument" on

the issue, and promised to respond.
He said he considered the issues involved with
CPPC recruiting somewhat different from those of
the ROTC program. With regard to recruiting on
campus, "I find it acceptable to include on the list
organizations who have policies which I don't
approve of," he said, adding that he reserved the
right to try to persuade students to avoid those orga
nizations.
Speaking to Bradfute, Kennedy said the issue of
the ROTC program "probably needs renewed discus
sion. Probably you should launch one."
Senator Jason Moore, a junior, told Kennedy he
had heard several student concerns about the Uni
versity's mascot, the Cardinal. The senate applauded
Moore's suggestion that the University look into
adopting a new mascot.
"I find nothing inadequate about the Cardinal,"
Kennedy said. "Stanford apathy does not have
anything to do with animal deprivation."
Kennedy then rattled off some qualities that a
mascot would have to possess — non-racist, non-sex
ist and "environmentally sound," among others.
He first suggested the name "Robber Barons"
would not be appropriate but then corrected himself.
"Maybe Robber Barons is acceptable," he said.
Kennedy said that any new nickname would
require support from athletes, as well as "warm and
wide community support." He also hinted that a new
mascot would need his approval.
He bemoaned the fact that questions about the
mascot keep recurring. He asked, "How many times
do I have to hear about the mascot?"
Kennedy told the senate he was not under consid
eration for the presidency of Harvard, flatly stating,
"I don't have any interest in doing this job anywhere
else."
In response to a question by sophomore senator
Alison Alter about financial aid,
Kennedy said plans to improve financial
aid budgets for undergraduates were a
priority of the University's fund-raising
efforts. He added that the reduced avail
ability of work-study jobs because of
budget cuts were a "particular prob
lem" the University was working on.
"We can minimize the pain once
we're through the reorganization," he
said. "We understand that right now it's
not so good, and I'm sorry about that."
He also said the most common com
plaint from undergraduates was that

their aid packages were less now than
they had been their freshman year. He
explained that freshman-year awards
are based on incomplete information,
and that as more details about financial
status come in, the financial aid is re
calculated, usually to the detriment of
students.
He also pointed out that "as families
get a year older, they have more income
and assets," thus reducing the level of
financial aid.
Kennedy then answered questions
from senators Ben Wang and John
Overdeck on the alcohol policy.
"We are going to try to develop, with
lots of student input, some understand
ings about enforcement mechanisms"
with regard to underage drinking, he

said. "I don't propose to police things in
a different way, but ... a certain
amount of caution would be desired."
Kennedy also addressed concerns
that the new policy would infringe upon
students' privacy rights. He described a
law that was in effect while he had a
home in Palo Alto which prohibited him
from selling or making alcohol in his
home. He said that while the law was
"on the books ... the Palo Alto police
didn't check my basement for a still."
In other business, the senate passed
bills institutionalizing the dorm repre
sentatives program and voted to allo
cate funds to bring Fred Friendly, cre
ator of PBS's "Ethics in America" pro
gram, to campus.

the ROTC program. With regard to recruiting on
campus, "I find it acceptable to include on the list
organizations who have policies which I don't
approve of," he said, adding that he reserved the
right to try to persuade students to avoid those orga
nizations.
Speaking to Bradfute, Kennedy said the issue of
the ROTC program "probably needs renewed discus
sion. Probably you should launch one."
Senator Jason Moore, a junior, told Kennedy he
had heard several student concerns about the Uni
versity's mascot, the Cardinal. The senate applauded
Moore's suggestion that the University look into
adopting a new mascot.
"I find nothing inadequate about the Cardinal,"
Kennedy said. "Stanford apathy does not have
anything to do with animal deprivation."
Kennedy then rattled off some qualities that a
mascot would have to possess — non-racist, non-sex
ist and "environmentally sound," among others.
He first suggested the name "Robber Barons"
would not be appropriate but then corrected himself.
"Maybe Robber Barons is acceptable," he said.
Kennedy said that any new nickname would
require support from athletes, as well as "warm and
wide community support." He also hinted that a new
mascot would need his approval.
He bemoaned the fact that questions about the
mascot keep recurring. He asked, "How many times
do I have to hear about the mascot?"
Kennedy told the senate he was not under consid
eration for the presidency of Harvard, flatly stating,
"I don't have any interest in doing this job anywhere
else."
In response to a question by sophomore senator
Alison Alter about financial aid,
Kennedy said plans to improve financial
aid budgets for undergraduates were a
priority of the University's fund-raising
efforts. He added that the reduced avail
ability of work-study jobs because of
budget cuts were a "particular prob
lem" the University was working on.
"We can minimize the pain once
we're through the reorganization," he
said. "We understand that right now it's
not so good, and I'm sorry about that."
He also said the most common com
plaint from undergraduates was that

their aid packages were less now than
they had been their freshman year. He
explained that freshman-year awards
are based on incomplete information,
and that as more details about financial
status come in, the financial aid is re
calculated, usually to the detriment of
students.
He also pointed out that "as families
get a year older, they have more income
and assets," thus reducing the level of
financial aid.
Kennedy then answered questions
from senators Ben Wang and John
Overdeck on the alcohol policy.
"We are going to try to develop, with
lots of student input, some understand
ings about enforcement mechanisms"
with regard to underage drinking, he

said. "I don't propose to police things in
a different way, but ... a certain
amount of caution would be desired."
Kennedy also addressed concerns
that the new policy would infringe upon
students' privacy rights. He described a
law that was in effect while he had a
home in Palo Alto which prohibited him
from selling or making alcohol in his
home. He said that while the law was
"on the books ... the Palo Alto police
didn't check my basement for a still."
In other business, the senate passed
bills institutionalizing the dorm repre
sentatives program and voted to allo
cate funds to bring Fred Friendly, cre
ator of PBS's "Ethics in America" pro
gram, to campus.
Addressing last night's ASSU Senate meeting,
University President Donald Kennedy answered a
variety of questions ranging from financial aid to the
alcohol policy.
But Kennedy spent most of his time commenting
on issues that haven't been in the headlines.
Kennedy left open the possibility for "renewed
discussion" on the presence of ROTC at Stanford,
presented a list of prerequisites for a new Stanford
mascot and said there was "zero" chance of his
becoming president of "Stanford of the East."
In the opening remarks of his quarterly address to
the senate, Kennedy described some areas he is cur
rently focusing on, including the Centennial Cam
paign, indirect cost recovery issues, and the reorga
nization and "new governance structure" for the
University.
But, he emphasized, the administrative responsi
bilities of his job are not his favorite role. He
described his position as being "half manager and
half principal," adding, "I really like the principal
part better."
Kennedy answered about a dozen questions from
senators and the Council of Presidents.
Graduate senator David Bradfute thanked
Kennedy for his help in changing the University's
policy on rights for domestic partners of unmarried
gay, lesbian and heterosexual students. Applause fol
lowed.
Bradfute then questioned the University's
involvement with "programs that discriminate
against gay and lesbian students." He cited compa
nies and organizations that recruit at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, as well as ROTC, as
examples of such programs.
In an extended response, Kennedy invited Brad
fute to submit to him "a thoughtful argument" on

the issue, and promised to respond.
