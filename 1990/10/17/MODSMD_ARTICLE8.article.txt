# Family main goal at Zapata
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Whether students travel
thousands of miles or only
across the San Francisco Bay to
reach Stanford, Casa Zapata
tries to provide what most leave
at home — "la familia."

That strong sense of family
was missing for freshman Tania
Butkovic when she arrived at
Stanford a few weeks ago.
Unable to live in the Chicano
and Mexican-American theme
house, her first residence choice,
she was placed in nearby Twain
in Stern Hall, where she found
only one other Chicano/Latino
freshman living in the dorm.
"In the first week, it was
hard. It felt like no one else had
the same views as I did," said
Butkovic.
Yet while visiting Zapata,

Butkovic felt "much more sup
port." That support is derived,
in large part, from the sense of
familial togetherness cultivated
by Zapata's large residence staff
— ten resident assistants and
theme assistants, plus the two
resident fellows, Tony and
Cecilia Burciaga.
The stafT plays a critical role
in creating "la familia," —
which Tony Burciaga defined as
an attempt to form "one team,
to create a family unit in the
sense that everyone counts."
"When [students] come here,
we don't try to shove Chicano
programs on them. Our first pri
ority is to build a sense of
belonging and security," he said.
Last year's Draw book
described Zapata as "a special
program house emphasizing
cross-cultural experiences in
Chicano culture through educa
tion, music, food, politics, lan
guage and philosophy."
But former Zapata resident
Sharon Flom, a senior, said Zap
ata is much more than a theme
dorm. With the encouragement
of the resident fellows, Zapata
becomes "a home where people
care about each other, as
opposed to a place where people
just live together," she said.
And the sense of unity seems
to extend beyond the 98 stu
dents currently living in the
dorm. "Once you're a Zapatista,

you're always a Zapatista," said
theme associate Aki McKinzie, a
sophomore.
Past Zapata residents fre
quently return for parties and
reunions which are "incredibly
well attended," according to
theme associate Marty Grimes,
a senior.
Festivities involving Zapata's
ethnic theme are also popular.
All students are invited to Zap
ata for such occasions as Cinco
de Mayo, the national Mexican
holiday; Zoot Suit Week, a series
of movies, dances and lectures
celebrating the Zoot Suit cul
ture and Floricanto, a festival of
Chicano poets and singers.
Other theme-related activi
ties this year will include a clas
sic Mexican film series and a
weekly Spanish dinner table at
which only Spanish is spoken.
Although Spanish may draw
Zapata residents together, not
all residents speak the language.
Nor do all residents have direct
ties to Chicano/Mexican-Ameri
can culture.
A maximum of 50 percent of
dorm residents may be assigned
to Zapata through special ethnic
priorities. Last year, 40.2 per
cent of Zapata's residents were
Chicano/Latino, according to
Bill Georges, assistant director
of the Housing Center. The rest

Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
