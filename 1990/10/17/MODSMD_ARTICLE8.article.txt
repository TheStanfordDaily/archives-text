# Family main goal at Zapata
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Whether students travel
thousands of miles or only
across the San Francisco Bay to
reach Stanford, Casa Zapata
tries to provide what most leave
at home — "la familia."

That strong sense of family
was missing for freshman Tania
Butkovic when she arrived at
Stanford a few weeks ago.
Unable to live in the Chicano
and Mexican-American theme
house, her first residence choice,
she was placed in nearby Twain
in Stern Hall, where she found
only one other Chicano/Latino
freshman living in the dorm.
"In the first week, it was
hard. It felt like no one else had
the same views as I did," said
Butkovic.
Yet while visiting Zapata,

Butkovic felt "much more sup
port." That support is derived,
in large part, from the sense of
familial togetherness cultivated
by Zapata's large residence staff
— ten resident assistants and
theme assistants, plus the two
resident fellows, Tony and
Cecilia Burciaga.
The stafT plays a critical role
in creating "la familia," —
which Tony Burciaga defined as
an attempt to form "one team,
to create a family unit in the
sense that everyone counts."
"When [students] come here,
we don't try to shove Chicano
programs on them. Our first pri
ority is to build a sense of
belonging and security," he said.
Last year's Draw book
described Zapata as "a special
program house emphasizing
cross-cultural experiences in
Chicano culture through educa
tion, music, food, politics, lan
guage and philosophy."
But former Zapata resident
Sharon Flom, a senior, said Zap
ata is much more than a theme
dorm. With the encouragement
of the resident fellows, Zapata
becomes "a home where people
care about each other, as
opposed to a place where people
just live together," she said.
And the sense of unity seems
to extend beyond the 98 stu
dents currently living in the
dorm. "Once you're a Zapatista,

you're always a Zapatista," said
theme associate Aki McKinzie, a
sophomore.
Past Zapata residents fre
quently return for parties and
reunions which are "incredibly
well attended," according to
theme associate Marty Grimes,
a senior.
Festivities involving Zapata's
ethnic theme are also popular.
All students are invited to Zap
ata for such occasions as Cinco
de Mayo, the national Mexican
holiday; Zoot Suit Week, a series
of movies, dances and lectures
celebrating the Zoot Suit cul
ture and Floricanto, a festival of
Chicano poets and singers.
Other theme-related activi
ties this year will include a clas
sic Mexican film series and a
weekly Spanish dinner table at
which only Spanish is spoken.
Although Spanish may draw
Zapata residents together, not
all residents speak the language.
Nor do all residents have direct
ties to Chicano/Mexican-Ameri
can culture.
A maximum of 50 percent of
dorm residents may be assigned
to Zapata through special ethnic
priorities. Last year, 40.2 per
cent of Zapata's residents were
Chicano/Latino, according to
Bill Georges, assistant director
of the Housing Center. The rest

Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
of the dorm population was 37
percent white, 8.7 percent Asian-
American, 5.4 percent Native
American, 4.3 percent black and
4.3 percent international.
Because such a high percentage
of the dorm is Chicano/ Latino,
some students of other ethnicities
wonder, at least initially, whether
they really belong in "la familia de
Zapata." When freshman
Jean Chao fdled out information
forms this summer, she didn't
request to live in the
Chicano/Mexican-American
theme house. But she was one of
nearly twenty non-Chicano fresh
men assigned to Zapata this fall.
Chao said she became worried
during Orientation when Zapata
resident assistants began speak
ing in rapid Spanish to the Chi
cano/Latino parents present. "I
wasn't sure what was going on,"
she said, "and I wondered, 'Is this
going to be a basically Spanish
speaking dorm?' "
Overall, Spanish is not spoken
in Zapata "as much as you would
think," Grimes said. In some situ
ations, even native Spanish speak
ers hesitate to speak Spanish to
avoid offending non—Spanish
speakers, he added.
When Spanish is used in dorm
conversations, speedy translations
usually accompany any unfamiliar
words, said junior Tina Gandera.
At a recent program on Aztec cul
ture, for example, the speaker's
Spanish explanations were trans
lated into English for the non-
Spanish speaking audience mem
bers.
Some Chicano/Latino students
explore their culture for the first
time at Zapata. Junior Noel Mau

rer, who said his Chicano heritage
is "distant," hopes this year "to
get a taste of the Chicano experi
ence in the United States."
"I never even knew the word
'Chicano' before I came to Califor
nia," he said. "No one in New York
uses that word."
Like the dorm population, Zap
ata's residence staff is racially
mixed. This year, while all four
RAs are Chicano/Latino, three of
the six theme assistants have
other ethnic backgrounds.
Grimes, who is white, said the
ethnic diversity among residence
staff members may contribute to
non-Chicano/Latino students'
sense of belonging in Zapata.
"When I was a freshman I
always felt comfortable here, but
it was encouraging to me to see
that some of the staff were like me
and were accepted as part of the
house," he said.
Grimes also noted extensive
non-Chicano/Latino student
involvement in Zapata's house
government this year. "It goes to
show that anybody can feel a part
of this house," he said.
But not all Zapata residents
agree. At the beginning of the
quarter, one student expressed his
or her frustration on Zapata's
"Issue Board," where residents
can respond in writing to various
newspaper and magazine articles
posted on the wall.
The anonymous comment read,
"Too Mexican oriented. Speak
about more non-Hispanic issues.
It's not our fault that people were
involuntarily placed here."
Grimes responded with a
request for the writer to "give it a
chance — you'll love it."
He said, "Traditionally, we
have had two or three upperclass
men who didn't want to be a part
of the dorm and came in with a

bad attitude," but most viewed the
dorm more positively by the end of
the year.
Gandera, now a junior, recalled
three upperclassmen living in the
dorm during her freshman year
who "hated it here." She said
those dissatisfied residents
"didn't participate in any of the
programming. ... They didn't try
to fit in at all."
According to Flom, who is
white, cross-cultural exchange in
Zapata is possible and can be very
rewarding. She said, "Friendships
across cultures take more time to
develop. ... It took longer for me
to get to know some of the Chi
cano students than the non-Chi
cano students because of differ
ences in backgrounds."
Flom also said she never felt
excluded because of her ethnicity.
"I felt like people went to pretty
great lengths to explain what they
were doing and what their tradi
tions were," she noted.
One Zapata tradition is throw
ing people in the shower on their
birthdays, then serenading them
with the song "Las Mananitas."
Another tradition which has
developed is mural painting. Vir
tually every available wall surface
is covered with bold, colorful
designs depicting various aspects
of Mexican—American social and
political culture.
Zapata RA Anita DeLucio, who
has completed a research project
on the murals, said the transfor
mation of the dorm's interior
began in 1973. Zapata was estab
lished in 1972 with the renaming
of Stern's Muir House.

Students have collaborated
with professional artists on many
of the murals throughout the last
two decades. The most recent
mural was completed on an outer
wall last spring-
Some of the murals have not
been welcomed by the entire Stan
ford community. For example,
DeLucio said "The Spirit of
Hoover", which protests conser
vatism at the Hoover Institution,

generated controversy when it
was completed in 1986.
Some of the murals continue to
have a strong impact on those
entering Zapata. Freshman Silvia
Robles said, "When I first came in,
I thought the murals were really
radical. ... A lot of people can be
intimidated by them."
Nevertheless, support for the
murals has contributed to dorm
unity, DeLucio said. "Murals can

really have the effect of bringing
dorms together."
While ethnic theme program
ming may be an important part of
the Zapata experience, Flom said,
"The place where you really learn
about a culture and the people of a
culture is in relationships and
friendships."
"This is home," said Tony Bur
ciaga. "The theme comes second
— but not very far behind."

forms this summer, she didn't
request to live in the
Chicano/Mexican-American
theme house. But she was one of
nearly twenty non-Chicano fresh
men assigned to Zapata this fall.
Chao said she became worried
during Orientation when Zapata
resident assistants began speak
ing in rapid Spanish to the Chi
cano/Latino parents present. "I
wasn't sure what was going on,"
she said, "and I wondered, 'Is this
going to be a basically Spanish
speaking dorm?' "
Overall, Spanish is not spoken
in Zapata "as much as you would
think," Grimes said. In some situ
ations, even native Spanish speak
ers hesitate to speak Spanish to
avoid offending non—Spanish
speakers, he added.
When Spanish is used in dorm
conversations, speedy translations
usually accompany any unfamiliar
words, said junior Tina Gandera.
At a recent program on Aztec cul
ture, for example, the speaker's
Spanish explanations were trans
lated into English for the non-
Spanish speaking audience mem
bers.
Some Chicano/Latino students
explore their culture for the first
time at Zapata. Junior Noel Mau

rer, who said his Chicano heritage
is "distant," hopes this year "to
get a taste of the Chicano experi
ence in the United States."
"I never even knew the word
'Chicano' before I came to Califor
nia," he said. "No one in New York
uses that word."
Like the dorm population, Zap
ata's residence staff is racially
mixed. This year, while all four
RAs are Chicano/Latino, three of
the six theme assistants have
other ethnic backgrounds.
Grimes, who is white, said the
ethnic diversity among residence
staff members may contribute to
non-Chicano/Latino students'
sense of belonging in Zapata.
"When I was a freshman I
always felt comfortable here, but
it was encouraging to me to see
that some of the staff were like me
and were accepted as part of the
house," he said.
Grimes also noted extensive
non-Chicano/Latino student
involvement in Zapata's house
government this year. "It goes to
show that anybody can feel a part
of this house," he said.
But not all Zapata residents
agree. At the beginning of the
quarter, one student expressed his
or her frustration on Zapata's
"Issue Board," where residents
can respond in writing to various
newspaper and magazine articles
posted on the wall.
The anonymous comment read,
"Too Mexican oriented. Speak
about more non-Hispanic issues.
It's not our fault that people were
involuntarily placed here."
Grimes responded with a
request for the writer to "give it a
chance — you'll love it."
He said, "Traditionally, we
have had two or three upperclass
men who didn't want to be a part
of the dorm and came in with a

bad attitude," but most viewed the
dorm more positively by the end of
the year.
Gandera, now a junior, recalled
three upperclassmen living in the
dorm during her freshman year
who "hated it here." She said
those dissatisfied residents
"didn't participate in any of the
programming. ... They didn't try
to fit in at all."
According to Flom, who is
white, cross-cultural exchange in
Zapata is possible and can be very
rewarding. She said, "Friendships
across cultures take more time to
develop. ... It took longer for me
to get to know some of the Chi
cano students than the non-Chi
cano students because of differ
ences in backgrounds."
Flom also said she never felt
excluded because of her ethnicity.
"I felt like people went to pretty
great lengths to explain what they
were doing and what their tradi
tions were," she noted.
One Zapata tradition is throw
ing people in the shower on their
birthdays, then serenading them
with the song "Las Mananitas."
Another tradition which has
developed is mural painting. Vir
tually every available wall surface
is covered with bold, colorful
designs depicting various aspects
of Mexican—American social and
political culture.
Zapata RA Anita DeLucio, who
has completed a research project
on the murals, said the transfor
mation of the dorm's interior
began in 1973. Zapata was estab
lished in 1972 with the renaming
of Stern's Muir House.

Students have collaborated
with professional artists on many
of the murals throughout the last
two decades. The most recent
mural was completed on an outer
wall last spring-
Some of the murals have not
been welcomed by the entire Stan
ford community. For example,
DeLucio said "The Spirit of
Hoover", which protests conser
vatism at the Hoover Institution,

generated controversy when it
was completed in 1986.
Some of the murals continue to
have a strong impact on those
entering Zapata. Freshman Silvia
Robles said, "When I first came in,
I thought the murals were really
radical. ... A lot of people can be
intimidated by them."
Nevertheless, support for the
murals has contributed to dorm
unity, DeLucio said. "Murals can

really have the effect of bringing
dorms together."
While ethnic theme program
ming may be an important part of
the Zapata experience, Flom said,
"The place where you really learn
about a culture and the people of a
culture is in relationships and
friendships."
"This is home," said Tony Bur
ciaga. "The theme comes second
— but not very far behind."


Vljay Ramakrlshnan — Dally
Residents eat dinner In front of one of Case Zapata's well-known murals. The Chlcano and Mexican-
American theme house strives for a family atmosphere.
Whether students travel
thousands of miles or only
across the San Francisco Bay to
reach Stanford, Casa Zapata
tries to provide what most leave
at home — "la familia."

That strong sense of family
was missing for freshman Tania
Butkovic when she arrived at
Stanford a few weeks ago.
Unable to live in the Chicano
and Mexican-American theme
house, her first residence choice,
she was placed in nearby Twain
in Stern Hall, where she found
only one other Chicano/Latino
freshman living in the dorm.
"In the first week, it was
hard. It felt like no one else had
the same views as I did," said
Butkovic.
Yet while visiting Zapata,

Butkovic felt "much more sup
port." That support is derived,
in large part, from the sense of
familial togetherness cultivated
by Zapata's large residence staff
— ten resident assistants and
theme assistants, plus the two
resident fellows, Tony and
Cecilia Burciaga.
The stafT plays a critical role
in creating "la familia," —
which Tony Burciaga defined as
an attempt to form "one team,
to create a family unit in the
sense that everyone counts."
"When [students] come here,
we don't try to shove Chicano
programs on them. Our first pri
ority is to build a sense of
belonging and security," he said.
Last year's Draw book
described Zapata as "a special
program house emphasizing
cross-cultural experiences in
Chicano culture through educa
tion, music, food, politics, lan
guage and philosophy."
But former Zapata resident
Sharon Flom, a senior, said Zap
ata is much more than a theme
dorm. With the encouragement
of the resident fellows, Zapata
becomes "a home where people
care about each other, as
opposed to a place where people
just live together," she said.
And the sense of unity seems
to extend beyond the 98 stu
dents currently living in the
dorm. "Once you're a Zapatista,

you're always a Zapatista," said
theme associate Aki McKinzie, a
sophomore.
Past Zapata residents fre
quently return for parties and
reunions which are "incredibly
well attended," according to
theme associate Marty Grimes,
a senior.
Festivities involving Zapata's
ethnic theme are also popular.
All students are invited to Zap
ata for such occasions as Cinco
de Mayo, the national Mexican
holiday; Zoot Suit Week, a series
of movies, dances and lectures
celebrating the Zoot Suit cul
ture and Floricanto, a festival of
Chicano poets and singers.
Other theme-related activi
ties this year will include a clas
sic Mexican film series and a
weekly Spanish dinner table at
which only Spanish is spoken.
Although Spanish may draw
Zapata residents together, not
all residents speak the language.
Nor do all residents have direct
ties to Chicano/Mexican-Ameri
can culture.
A maximum of 50 percent of
dorm residents may be assigned
to Zapata through special ethnic
priorities. Last year, 40.2 per
cent of Zapata's residents were
Chicano/Latino, according to
Bill Georges, assistant director
of the Housing Center. The rest

of the dorm population was 37
percent white, 8.7 percent Asian-
American, 5.4 percent Native
American, 4.3 percent black and
4.3 percent international.
Because such a high percentage
of the dorm is Chicano/ Latino,
some students of other ethnicities
wonder, at least initially, whether
they really belong in "la familia de
Zapata." When freshman

tions were," she noted.
One Zapata tradition is throw
ing people in the shower on their
birthdays, then serenading them
with the song "Las Mananitas."
Another tradition which has
developed is mural painting. Vir
tually every available wall surface
is covered with bold, colorful
designs depicting various aspects
of Mexican—American social and
political culture.
Zapata RA Anita DeLucio, who
has completed a research project
on the murals, said the transfor
mation of the dorm's interior
began in 1973. Zapata was estab
lished in 1972 with the renaming
of Stern's Muir House.

Students have collaborated
with professional artists on many
of the murals throughout the last
two decades. The most recent
mural was completed on an outer
wall last spring-
Some of the murals have not
been welcomed by the entire Stan
ford community. For example,
DeLucio said "The Spirit of
Hoover", which protests conser
vatism at the Hoover Institution,

generated controversy when it
was completed in 1986.
Some of the murals continue to
have a strong impact on those
entering Zapata. Freshman Silvia
Robles said, "When I first came in,
I thought the murals were really
radical. ... A lot of people can be
intimidated by them."
Nevertheless, support for the
murals has contributed to dorm
unity, DeLucio said. "Murals can

really have the effect of bringing
dorms together."
While ethnic theme program
ming may be an important part of
the Zapata experience, Flom said,
"The place where you really learn
about a culture and the people of a
culture is in relationships and
friendships."
"This is home," said Tony Bur
ciaga. "The theme comes second
— but not very far behind."


Vljay Ramakrlshnan — Dally
Residents eat dinner In front of one of Case Zapata's well-known murals. The Chlcano and Mexican-
American theme house strives for a family atmosphere.
Whether students travel
thousands of miles or only
across the San Francisco Bay to
reach Stanford, Casa Zapata
tries to provide what most leave
at home — "la familia."

That strong sense of family
was missing for freshman Tania
Butkovic when she arrived at
Stanford a few weeks ago.
Unable to live in the Chicano
and Mexican-American theme
house, her first residence choice,
she was placed in nearby Twain
in Stern Hall, where she found
only one other Chicano/Latino
freshman living in the dorm.
"In the first week, it was
hard. It felt like no one else had
the same views as I did," said
Butkovic.
Yet while visiting Zapata,

Butkovic felt "much more sup
port." That support is derived,
in large part, from the sense of
familial togetherness cultivated
by Zapata's large residence staff
— ten resident assistants and
theme assistants, plus the two
resident fellows, Tony and
Cecilia Burciaga.
The stafT plays a critical role
in creating "la familia," —
which Tony Burciaga defined as
an attempt to form "one team,
to create a family unit in the
sense that everyone counts."
"When [students] come here,
we don't try to shove Chicano
programs on them. Our first pri
ority is to build a sense of
belonging and security," he said.
Last year's Draw book
described Zapata as "a special
program house emphasizing
cross-cultural experiences in
Chicano culture through educa
tion, music, food, politics, lan
guage and philosophy."
But former Zapata resident
Sharon Flom, a senior, said Zap
ata is much more than a theme
dorm. With the encouragement
of the resident fellows, Zapata
becomes "a home where people
care about each other, as
opposed to a place where people
just live together," she said.
And the sense of unity seems
to extend beyond the 98 stu
dents currently living in the
dorm. "Once you're a Zapatista,

you're always a Zapatista," said
theme associate Aki McKinzie, a
sophomore.
Past Zapata residents fre
quently return for parties and
reunions which are "incredibly
well attended," according to
theme associate Marty Grimes,
a senior.
Festivities involving Zapata's
ethnic theme are also popular.
All students are invited to Zap
ata for such occasions as Cinco
de Mayo, the national Mexican
holiday; Zoot Suit Week, a series
of movies, dances and lectures
celebrating the Zoot Suit cul
ture and Floricanto, a festival of
Chicano poets and singers.
Other theme-related activi
ties this year will include a clas
sic Mexican film series and a
weekly Spanish dinner table at
which only Spanish is spoken.
Although Spanish may draw
Zapata residents together, not
all residents speak the language.
Nor do all residents have direct
ties to Chicano/Mexican-Ameri
can culture.
A maximum of 50 percent of
dorm residents may be assigned
to Zapata through special ethnic
priorities. Last year, 40.2 per
cent of Zapata's residents were
Chicano/Latino, according to
Bill Georges, assistant director
of the Housing Center. The rest

Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
of the dorm population was 37
percent white, 8.7 percent Asian-
American, 5.4 percent Native
American, 4.3 percent black and
4.3 percent international.
Because such a high percentage
of the dorm is Chicano/ Latino,
some students of other ethnicities
wonder, at least initially, whether
they really belong in "la familia de
Zapata." When freshman
Jean Chao fdled out information
forms this summer, she didn't
request to live in the
Chicano/Mexican-American
theme house. But she was one of
nearly twenty non-Chicano fresh
men assigned to Zapata this fall.
Chao said she became worried
during Orientation when Zapata
resident assistants began speak
ing in rapid Spanish to the Chi
cano/Latino parents present. "I
wasn't sure what was going on,"
she said, "and I wondered, 'Is this
going to be a basically Spanish
speaking dorm?' "
Overall, Spanish is not spoken
in Zapata "as much as you would
think," Grimes said. In some situ
ations, even native Spanish speak
ers hesitate to speak Spanish to
avoid offending non—Spanish
speakers, he added.
When Spanish is used in dorm
conversations, speedy translations
usually accompany any unfamiliar
words, said junior Tina Gandera.
At a recent program on Aztec cul
ture, for example, the speaker's
Spanish explanations were trans
lated into English for the non-
Spanish speaking audience mem
bers.
Some Chicano/Latino students
explore their culture for the first
time at Zapata. Junior Noel Mau

rer, who said his Chicano heritage
is "distant," hopes this year "to
get a taste of the Chicano experi
ence in the United States."
"I never even knew the word
'Chicano' before I came to Califor
nia," he said. "No one in New York
uses that word."
Like the dorm population, Zap
ata's residence staff is racially
mixed. This year, while all four
RAs are Chicano/Latino, three of
the six theme assistants have
other ethnic backgrounds.
Grimes, who is white, said the
ethnic diversity among residence
staff members may contribute to
non-Chicano/Latino students'
sense of belonging in Zapata.
"When I was a freshman I
always felt comfortable here, but
it was encouraging to me to see
that some of the staff were like me
and were accepted as part of the
house," he said.
Grimes also noted extensive
non-Chicano/Latino student
involvement in Zapata's house
government this year. "It goes to
show that anybody can feel a part
of this house," he said.
But not all Zapata residents
agree. At the beginning of the
quarter, one student expressed his
or her frustration on Zapata's
"Issue Board," where residents
can respond in writing to various
newspaper and magazine articles
posted on the wall.
The anonymous comment read,
"Too Mexican oriented. Speak
about more non-Hispanic issues.
It's not our fault that people were
involuntarily placed here."
Grimes responded with a
request for the writer to "give it a
chance — you'll love it."
He said, "Traditionally, we
have had two or three upperclass
men who didn't want to be a part
of the dorm and came in with a

bad attitude," but most viewed the
dorm more positively by the end of
the year.
Gandera, now a junior, recalled
three upperclassmen living in the
dorm during her freshman year
who "hated it here." She said
those dissatisfied residents
"didn't participate in any of the
programming. ... They didn't try
to fit in at all."
According to Flom, who is
white, cross-cultural exchange in
Zapata is possible and can be very
rewarding. She said, "Friendships
across cultures take more time to
develop. ... It took longer for me
to get to know some of the Chi
cano students than the non-Chi
cano students because of differ
ences in backgrounds."
Flom also said she never felt
excluded because of her ethnicity.
"I felt like people went to pretty
great lengths to explain what they
were doing and what their tradi
tions were," she noted.
One Zapata tradition is throw
ing people in the shower on their
birthdays, then serenading them
with the song "Las Mananitas."
Another tradition which has
developed is mural painting. Vir
tually every available wall surface
