suit salesman's success
By AMY SCHULMAN
HARVARD Business School student John
Francis puts on his best business suit, only to
be badgered for buying it in the Erst place.
"How much did you pay for this suit? Is this
custom-made or ready-made?" R.M. Rock
asks, tugging at the seat of Francis' pants, "I
mean this suit — how old is this suit? I don't
want to say anything but this is ridiculous. This
is three, four inches too big around the hips."
Francis takes no offense — he just smiles.
He is about to be measured for Rock's
perfect-fitting, completely custom-made suit
In fact he's going to take three. With a $250 to
$500 price range depending on the fabric
Francis chooses, each suit will cost him less
than the off-the-rack monstrosity he is
wearing.
"I'll make from scratch anything you want,"
Rock promises. He takes a battery of measure
ments and two Polaroids of a shirtless Francis
so the tailors in Hong Kong can make the suit
to St his posture and symmetry.
The suits will have rubber stays on the
pants' waistband so Francis' shirt wont un
tuck, and the jackets will have his full name
inscribed on the inside of the coat pocket
. "Any detail you want I can do it" Rock says.
"Paisley lining, pleat no pleat one leg cuff, the
other leg no cuff. I can do anything."
Francis is relieved. Rock is everything his
Harvard Business School classmates say he is.
Rock, an independent salesman of Hong
Kong tailored clothing, has been suiting up the
men at Harvard Business School for 20 years.
The students call him an "HBS institution."
Born in India and schooled only until age 12,
Rock has come a long way since his first $4-
per-month job.
At 43, he dresses elegantly in Bally shoes,
tailored silk pants, tailored shirt and silk tie.
He makes it his business to know what is ap
propriate on Wall Street and in the corporate
boardroom.
"Blue or gray —no brown,"he advises the
future corporate elite. "Dress very conserva
tive. If you're with a company five, six years
you can wear anything. When you're new you
wear conservative clothes."
Rock sees 10 to 20 people daily in his
Charles Hotel room during the five-week trips
he makes each year to Cambridge from his
Granada Hills, Califs home. Most of his student
clients complain that off-the-rack suits are not
made for athletic men with big shoulders and
small waists.
Steve Stearns has already bought two suits
and a tuxedo from Rock "Even if you get a
good deal on it like at Filene's Basement who
wants to buy a nice suit just to have it all
chopped up?" says Stearns.
Some 5,000 swatches are laid out on the
hotel beds, including cottons for custom suits,
fine European wool, wool crepe, cashmere,
mink, kid mohair and worsted silk fabrics in
glen plaid, pin stripes, tweeds, herringbone,
flecks and solids.
He's able to buy Dunhill and SaviDe Row
fabrics that are top-of-the-hne," says Christo
pher Baker, a vice president at Prudential-
Bache Securities in Boston and a 1978 Harvard
MBA "Fve seen suits made of the same fabric
in Louis (of Boston) for triple the cost"
Baker says he has bought about 20 Rock
suits since his Harvard years, and he is only
one of the many who keep coming back for
more.
"I gef them while they are students," Rock
says. "They buy a few suits or a few shirts from
me now. but Tm hoping they get good jobs,
make a lot of money, become rich and famous
— and theyH make me rich."
It seems to be working. Rock says he now
has 2,000 clients in New York City alone who
are either Harvard Business School gradu
ates, thet friends or business associates.
"That's the McDonald's theory — get them
while they're kids," business student Mark
Demetree says.
Rock never planned on the franchise he
now enjoys. Twenty years ago he was ap
proached in Seattle by an HBS student asking
where he could q ret a suit Hke the one Rock
was wearing.
That student quickly became a customer,
and told Rock it would be worth his while to
make a business trip to Harvard. As any good
business school student would do, he offered
to be a campus agent and set up appoint
ments for a small commission on sales.
"I told him, You're crazy," Rock says."I
never heard of Harvard Business SchooL " The
student persisted, and Rock has never been
sorry he made the trip.
Current agents Charles Adams and Mike
Anthony have tried to expand Rock's clientele
to include students at Harvard Law School
and the business schools at Boston University
and Boston College.
Rock has also added Wharton and Stanford
Business School to his traveling itinerary.
Andy Eckert 6-foot-d and a recent Stanford
graduate who is now a senior associate at
Summit Partners in Boston, will wear his Rock
tuxedo at his wedding next month.
"Fve gone through four or five Hong Kong
tailors, and Mr. Rock's the best" he says.

suit salesman's success
By AMY SCHULMAN
HARVARD Business School student John
Francis puts on his best business suit, only to
be badgered for buying it in the Erst place.
"How much did you pay for this suit? Is this
custom-made or ready-made?" R.M. Rock
asks, tugging at the seat of Francis' pants, "I
mean this suit — how old is this suit? I don't
want to say anything but this is ridiculous. This
is three, four inches too big around the hips."
Francis takes no offense — he just smiles.
He is about to be measured for Rock's
perfect-fitting, completely custom-made suit
In fact he's going to take three. With a $250 to
$500 price range depending on the fabric
Francis chooses, each suit will cost him less
than the off-the-rack monstrosity he is
wearing.
"I'll make from scratch anything you want,"
Rock promises. He takes a battery of measure
ments and two Polaroids of a shirtless Francis
so the tailors in Hong Kong can make the suit
to St his posture and symmetry.
The suits will have rubber stays on the
pants' waistband so Francis' shirt wont un
tuck, and the jackets will have his full name
inscribed on the inside of the coat pocket
. "Any detail you want I can do it" Rock says.
"Paisley lining, pleat no pleat one leg cuff, the
other leg no cuff. I can do anything."
Francis is relieved. Rock is everything his
Harvard Business School classmates say he is.
Rock, an independent salesman of Hong
Kong tailored clothing, has been suiting up the
men at Harvard Business School for 20 years.
The students call him an "HBS institution."
Born in India and schooled only until age 12,
Rock has come a long way since his first $4-
per-month job.
At 43, he dresses elegantly in Bally shoes,
tailored silk pants, tailored shirt and silk tie.
He makes it his business to know what is ap
propriate on Wall Street and in the corporate
boardroom.
"Blue or gray —no brown,"he advises the
future corporate elite. "Dress very conserva
tive. If you're with a company five, six years
you can wear anything. When you're new you
wear conservative clothes."
Rock sees 10 to 20 people daily in his
Charles Hotel room during the five-week trips
he makes each year to Cambridge from his
Granada Hills, Califs home. Most of his student
clients complain that off-the-rack suits are not
made for athletic men with big shoulders and
small waists.
Steve Stearns has already bought two suits
and a tuxedo from Rock "Even if you get a
good deal on it like at Filene's Basement who
wants to buy a nice suit just to have it all
chopped up?" says Stearns.
Some 5,000 swatches are laid out on the
hotel beds, including cottons for custom suits,
fine European wool, wool crepe, cashmere,
mink, kid mohair and worsted silk fabrics in
glen plaid, pin stripes, tweeds, herringbone,
flecks and solids.
He's able to buy Dunhill and SaviDe Row
fabrics that are top-of-the-hne," says Christo
pher Baker, a vice president at Prudential-
Bache Securities in Boston and a 1978 Harvard
MBA "Fve seen suits made of the same fabric
in Louis (of Boston) for triple the cost"
Baker says he has bought about 20 Rock
suits since his Harvard years, and he is only
one of the many who keep coming back for
more.
"I gef them while they are students," Rock
says. "They buy a few suits or a few shirts from
me now. but Tm hoping they get good jobs,
make a lot of money, become rich and famous
— and theyH make me rich."
It seems to be working. Rock says he now
has 2,000 clients in New York City alone who
are either Harvard Business School gradu
ates, thet friends or business associates.
"That's the McDonald's theory — get them
while they're kids," business student Mark
Demetree says.
Rock never planned on the franchise he
now enjoys. Twenty years ago he was ap
proached in Seattle by an HBS student asking
where he could q ret a suit Hke the one Rock
was wearing.
That student quickly became a customer,
and told Rock it would be worth his while to
make a business trip to Harvard. As any good
business school student would do, he offered
to be a campus agent and set up appoint
ments for a small commission on sales.
"I told him, You're crazy," Rock says."I
never heard of Harvard Business SchooL " The
student persisted, and Rock has never been
sorry he made the trip.
Current agents Charles Adams and Mike
Anthony have tried to expand Rock's clientele
to include students at Harvard Law School
and the business schools at Boston University
and Boston College.
Rock has also added Wharton and Stanford
Business School to his traveling itinerary.
Andy Eckert 6-foot-d and a recent Stanford
graduate who is now a senior associate at
Summit Partners in Boston, will wear his Rock
tuxedo at his wedding next month.
"Fve gone through four or five Hong Kong
