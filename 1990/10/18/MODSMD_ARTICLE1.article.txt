# Buildings slow to be quake-proofed
## Unsecured objects pose danger 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Little has been done to
secure objects within many
campus buildings in prepara
tion for future earthquakes,
but University officials dis
agree whether this inaction is
due to a lack of effort or a lack
of funding.
The science laboratories and
the Graduate School of Busi
ness are the only areas where
significant progress has been
made in earthquake prepara
tion, according to Environmen
tal Health and Safety Director
Tom Mcßride.
Work on laboratory safety
began even before last year's
Loma Prieta earthquake, and
more than $200,000 has
already been spent in this area.
Another $100,000 has since
been allocated to complete the
project.
"The laboratories have
already been done because
there are many risks and there
was money provided before last
year's earthquake," said
Mcßride. "Lab safety was our
highest priority."
In order to make the inte
rior of a building safe, furni
ture such as bookcases and file
cabinets should be secured to
walls, heavy items should be
placed on lower shelves and
book restraints should be

installed on
bookshelves.
Building man
agers should
survey each
room in order
to determine
what needs to
be secured and
submit a spe-

Mcßride cial work order
to Operations and Maintenance,
Mcßride said.
"There has been no incen
tive to secure contents in other
buildings (besides labs)
because the general public per
ceived that there was no risk,"
said Mcßride. "However, ur.n'v
cured items could cause serious
injury if an earthquake
occurs."
Mcßride also said that some
building managers have
neglected to make the neces
sary surveys of their buildings.
However, Terry Adams, pro
ject engineer for Operations
and Maintenance, offered
another reason for the delay.
"It was strictly a matter of
funding," Adams said. "We did
a number of buildings and
departments after the quake,
but it was an expensive pro
cess.
"Building managers have
expressed concerns. They have
entered requests to their
