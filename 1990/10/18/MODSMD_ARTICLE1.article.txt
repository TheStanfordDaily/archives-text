# Buildings slow to be quake-proofed
## Unsecured objects pose danger 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Little has been done to
secure objects within many
campus buildings in prepara
tion for future earthquakes,
but University officials dis
agree whether this inaction is
due to a lack of effort or a lack
of funding.
The science laboratories and
the Graduate School of Busi
ness are the only areas where
significant progress has been
made in earthquake prepara
tion, according to Environmen
tal Health and Safety Director
Tom Mcßride.
Work on laboratory safety
began even before last year's
Loma Prieta earthquake, and
more than $200,000 has
already been spent in this area.
Another $100,000 has since
been allocated to complete the
project.
"The laboratories have
already been done because
there are many risks and there
was money provided before last
year's earthquake," said
Mcßride. "Lab safety was our
highest priority."
In order to make the inte
rior of a building safe, furni
ture such as bookcases and file
cabinets should be secured to
walls, heavy items should be
placed on lower shelves and
book restraints should be

installed on
bookshelves.
Building man
agers should
survey each
room in order
to determine
what needs to
be secured and
submit a spe-

Mcßride cial work order
to Operations and Maintenance,
Mcßride said.
"There has been no incen
tive to secure contents in other
buildings (besides labs)
because the general public per
ceived that there was no risk,"
said Mcßride. "However, ur.n'v
cured items could cause serious
injury if an earthquake
occurs."
Mcßride also said that some
building managers have
neglected to make the neces
sary surveys of their buildings.
However, Terry Adams, pro
ject engineer for Operations
and Maintenance, offered
another reason for the delay.
"It was strictly a matter of
funding," Adams said. "We did
a number of buildings and
departments after the quake,
but it was an expensive pro
cess.
"Building managers have
expressed concerns. They have
entered requests to their

departments but have not
received the funding," Adams con
tinued.
Funding for anchoring building
contents will come from the $172
million earthquake fund, said
Asst. Provost for Planning and
Management John Hughes.
M No precise budget estimate
has been completed, but I would
guess that it will cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars," Hughes
said. "This is the most cost-efTec
tive way to decrease the risks."
Health and Safety will be
responsible for allocation of funds,
he added.
However, some departments
which have already secured con
tents of their buildings have paid
for much of the work on their
own.
The Business School chose to
have a contractor survey all offices
and brace bookcases while repair
ing structural damage, said Paul
Johnson, associate dean of admin
istration for the Business School.
While the University paid for
some of the work, the Business
School paid for the majority, he
said.
Hughes said he hopes the
recent release of the Stanford
Earthquake Risk Management

Commission's report will inform
departments of the availability of
funds to anchor building contents,
but he said he could not estimate
how much will be paid by the Uni
versity earthquake fund and how
much will be paid by each depart
ment.
One of the five primary recom
mendations of the commission's
report, which was released last
Friday, was to "secure potentially
hazardous building contents by
August, 1992. Falling objects pre
sent the greatest danger to most
people on campus."
Director of Housing and Food
Services Keith Guy said his
department will examine its facili
ties in order to secure the contents
in the near future.
"We plan to survey the kitchens
and storerooms with [earthquake
safety] in mind in order to protect
our employees," Guy said.
Students must be responsible
for the safety of their own rooms,
said Barbara Tieraan, coordinator
of health and safety for Housing
and Food Services.
The "Quakesafe" flyer dis
tributed in dorms during the first
week of school is one mechanism
for educating students, Guy said.
Although securing building
contents makes up only a fraction
of the massive program of earth
quake repairs, Mcßride said he
believes that it is an essential part
of preparation.

already been done because
there are many risks and there
was money provided before last
year's earthquake," said
Mcßride. "Lab safety was our
highest priority."
In order to make the inte
rior of a building safe, furni
ture such as bookcases and file
cabinets should be secured to
walls, heavy items should be
placed on lower shelves and
book restraints should be

installed on
bookshelves.
Building man
agers should
survey each
room in order
to determine
what needs to
be secured and
submit a spe-

Mcßride cial work order
to Operations and Maintenance,
Mcßride said.
"There has been no incen
tive to secure contents in other
buildings (besides labs)
because the general public per
ceived that there was no risk,"
said Mcßride. "However, ur.n'v
cured items could cause serious
injury if an earthquake
occurs."
Mcßride also said that some
building managers have
neglected to make the neces
sary surveys of their buildings.
However, Terry Adams, pro
ject engineer for Operations
and Maintenance, offered
another reason for the delay.
"It was strictly a matter of
funding," Adams said. "We did
a number of buildings and
departments after the quake,
but it was an expensive pro
cess.
"Building managers have
expressed concerns. They have
entered requests to their

departments but have not
received the funding," Adams con
tinued.
Funding for anchoring building
contents will come from the $172
million earthquake fund, said
Asst. Provost for Planning and
Management John Hughes.
M No precise budget estimate
has been completed, but I would
guess that it will cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars," Hughes
said. "This is the most cost-efTec
tive way to decrease the risks."
Health and Safety will be
responsible for allocation of funds,
he added.
However, some departments
which have already secured con
tents of their buildings have paid
for much of the work on their
own.
The Business School chose to
have a contractor survey all offices
and brace bookcases while repair
ing structural damage, said Paul
Johnson, associate dean of admin
istration for the Business School.
While the University paid for
some of the work, the Business
School paid for the majority, he
said.
Hughes said he hopes the
recent release of the Stanford
Earthquake Risk Management

Commission's report will inform
departments of the availability of
funds to anchor building contents,
but he said he could not estimate
how much will be paid by the Uni
versity earthquake fund and how
much will be paid by each depart
ment.
One of the five primary recom
mendations of the commission's
report, which was released last
Friday, was to "secure potentially
hazardous building contents by
August, 1992. Falling objects pre
sent the greatest danger to most
people on campus."
Director of Housing and Food
Services Keith Guy said his
department will examine its facili
ties in order to secure the contents
in the near future.
"We plan to survey the kitchens
and storerooms with [earthquake
safety] in mind in order to protect
our employees," Guy said.
Students must be responsible
for the safety of their own rooms,
said Barbara Tieraan, coordinator
of health and safety for Housing
and Food Services.
The "Quakesafe" flyer dis
tributed in dorms during the first
week of school is one mechanism
for educating students, Guy said.
Although securing building
contents makes up only a fraction
of the massive program of earth
quake repairs, Mcßride said he
believes that it is an essential part
of preparation.
