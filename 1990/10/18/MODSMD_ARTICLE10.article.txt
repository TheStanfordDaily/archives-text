Critics attack Gorbachev's plans
MOSCOW (AP) — Critics attacked Presi
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev's toned-down eco
nomic reform plan yesterday, and an architect
of a more radical transition program protested
the retreat by offering his resignation.
The reaction came two days after Gorbachev
won the Nobel Peace Prize and the day after he
unveiled his comparatively slow plan for build
ing a Western-style market economy in the
Soviet Union.
Grigory Yavlinsky, co-author of the original
500-day plan, offered his resignation as deputy
prime minister of Russia, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics.
In a speech to the Russian parliament,
which adopted the 500-day plan on Sept. 11,
Yavlinsky did not mention Gorbachev by name.
But he predicted the president's reforms would
set off* disastrous price increases.
Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia and Gor
bachev's main political rival, on Tuesday criti
cized the president's plan, calling it a "catas
trophe" that is "doomed to fail" within
months.
Racism common at high
schools, says study
BOSTON (AP) — Many U.S. high school
students experience racism in their schools and
communities, and four of every 10 questioned
for a survey released yesterday admitted they
harbor racial or religious prejudices.
"The survey shows that our children have
learned how to hate," said Dr. Richard
Lapchick, director of the Center for the Study
of Sport in Society at Northeastern University.
The national survey, conducted by Louis
Harris and Associates, found 57 percent of
1,865 high school students questioned had wit
nessed or heard about a racial incident.
Acts considered racially motivated included
taunts, graffiti and violent acts against people
of a particular religion or race, said Louis Har
ris, chairman of the polling company.
The study had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percent.
Harris said 25 percent of the students
reported having been the target of racial con
frontations with violent overtones, though not
necessarily with actual violence. Blacks had
the highest frequency at 70 percent, followed
by Hispanics at 67 percent.
Vietnam, U.S. cooperate
to find missing servicemen
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States and
Vietnam agreed yesterday to "new levels of
cooperation" in their efforts to obtain an
accounting for the nearly 1,700 American ser
vicemen still missing from the Vietnam War.
President Bush's special emissary on POW
MIA matters, Gen. John Vessey Jr., made the
disclosure after several hours of discussions
with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach.
