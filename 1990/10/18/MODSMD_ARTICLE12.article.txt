# Student unrest ousts Ukrainian state chief
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Street demonstra
tions, student hunger strikes and class
room boycotts forced the resignation yes
terday of the prime minister of the
Ukraine, the second most populous Soviet
republic.
The ouster of Prime Minister Vitaly
Masol signalled an upsurge in the sepa
ratist movement in the Ukraine, known as
the Soviet breadbasket.
The Ukrainian parliament also passed a
resolution embracing other student
demands, including the transfer of owner
ship of Communist Party property to the
government and refusal to sign a new
treaty of union proposed by Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev, the state news
agency Tass reported.
The parliament earlier proclaimed
Ukraine's right to overrule national laws
and barred Ukrainian youths drafted by the
Soviet military from serving outside the
republic.
The unrest in the Ukraine and criticism
of Gorbachev's economic program struck
new blows at the Soviet president's
attempts to maintain a semblance of cen
tral authority.
Radicals have rejected Gorbachev's pro
posed treaty of union, which would redefine
political and economic links among the 15
republics, nearly all of which have declared
some form of sovereignty from the central
government.
Yeltsin and others want the republics to
negotiate forms of cooperation among
themselves.
Tens of thousands of students in the
Ukrainian capital of Kiev celebrated their
victory by marching yestersday evening
through October Revolution Square, which
they renamed Independence Square to
reflect the growing separatist movement,
said spokeswoman Natalia Preobrazhen
skaya.
Members of the Ukrainian legislature,
opposition leaders and students addressed

the festive rally, called to celebrate the end
of a hunger strike that started on Oct. 2,
she said.
The students began the hunger strike
demanding the Ukrainian government
move faster to achieve independence from
the Soviet Union.
By the end, about 200 students were
going without food, pressing for the resig
nation of Masol, dissolution of parliament
and new elections for the republic.
News media that reported Masol's resig
nation did not indicate whether parliament
would be dissolved or new elections sched
uled.
The Ukraine was independent briefly
after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The
eastern Ukraine had been part of czarist
Russia from about the year 1700, when the
nomadic warriors known as Cossacks threw
their allegiance from Poland to Russia. The
western Ukraine was part of Poland until
World War 11.
Masol told Ukrainian President Leonid
Kravchuk of his decision to quit Tuesday,
and submited his resignation yesterday,
Tass said, quoting an unidentified parlia
mentary source. Masol, 62, was appointed
prime minister in June.
Doctors sent an appeal to the Ukrainian
legislature yestersday warning the stu
dents' health was being damaged by their
hunger strike.
Rukh, a nationalist Ukrainian organiza
tion, said 100,000 students marched peace
fully through Kiev to the republic's
Supreme Soviet building yesterday. The fig
ure could not be confirmed independently.
The protests also spread to other
Ukrainian cities, reported Interfax, an '
independent news agency. In Lvov, along
the Polish border, 20,000 students boy
cotted classes on Tuesday and 40 students
and instructors from the Polytechnic Insti- •
tute staged a one-day hunger strike, Inter
fax reported.
