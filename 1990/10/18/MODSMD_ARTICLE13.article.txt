BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - The
world trade embargo on Iraq has
begun to have an effect, officials
said yesterday, and some Iraqis
said they would put President
Bush on "trial" for denying their
children milk.
"We are in a very bad shape so
far as milk is concerned," one offi
cial said on condition of
anonymity. "There is no way we
can get it."
The government has listed
milk along with rice, wheat, sugar,
cooking oil, tea, soap, detergent
and beans as items in short supply

and subject to rationing.
Although Iraq has begun
rationing some goods, reporters in
Baghdad have seen no evidence of
any shortages.
"There is not enough milk for
the newborn babies and the block
ade has affected nourishment of
expectant mothers," Hamad
Saleh al-Rawi, president of the
Iraqi Bar Association, said in a
statement released yesterday.
He said about 50 expectant
mothers planned to testify against
Bush at a "trial" organized by the
bar association and various

women's and students' groups.
Al-Rawi said Bush will be
charged with "imposing an eco
nomic blockade against the people
of Iraq and depriving the same of
food, medicine and children's
milk."
Diplomatic sources in Baghad
have called the trial a publicity
stunt.
The trial was to have begun
Tuesday in Baghdad, but al-Rawi
said it was delayed because orga
nizers want to move it to Algeria
to avoid charges the proceedings
were slanted in favor of Iraq.
