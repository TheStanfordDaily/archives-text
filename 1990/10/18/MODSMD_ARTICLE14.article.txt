# House preserves 'covert' U.S. aid to UNITA
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
voted yesterday to preserve covert U.S.
military support for Angola's anti-gov
ernment rebels after an unusual public
debate on the technically secret pro
gram.
But lawmakers also provided that
the aid could be suspended if Angola's
Marxist government agrees to a cease
fire in the 15-year-old civil war and
schedules elections in which the
UNITA rebels may participate.
On a vote of 246-175, lawmakers
rejected an attempt to cut off aid to the
rebels unless it is openly requested by
President Bush as important to U.S.
national security. The amendment had

been proposed by Reps. Ron Dellums
and Mervyn Dymally, both D-Calif.,
and Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.
Later the House adopted, 213-200,
a less drastic approach proposed by
Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., providing
for the suspension of rebel aid if the
government moves toward a peaceful
settlement. Under a modification
offered by Rep. John Miller, R-Wash.,
Soviet military aid to the Luanda gov
ernment also would have to be cut off
before U.S. aid could be suspended.
The votes came during more than
five hours of open discussion on the
House floor over aid to UNITA, the
Portuguese acronym for the National

Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
The rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi,
have been fighting the Angola's Marx
ist government with covert support
from the United States backed by both
U.S. political parties. The war
has cost an estimated 200,000 lives.
Sources have said the total U.S. mil
itary amounts to roughly $60 million a
year, compared with some $500 million
in support given this year by the Soviet
Union to the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola, the Marxist
group which controls the government.
The sources say the primary reason

the operation is covert is to provide
cover for neighboring Zaire, which
cooperates with the United States in
funneling aid to UNITA.
The program "is a Cold War
anachronism," Dellums argued, citing
the toll of orphaned and maimed chil
dren. "It is an unnecessary and expen
sive drain on limited resources. We are
in the throes of a economic crisis
in this country."
Opponents argued that removing
the aid program would remove pres
sure on the Angolan government to
pursue a diplomatic solution to the
conflict.
