# State breaks up insurance scam

LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Auto insurance
fraud rings that cost policyholders an esti
mated $45 million were smashed by a govern
ment sting that resulted in charges against 51
people, the district attorney said yesterday.
All but four of the 51 were arrested or sur
rendered in what District Attorney Ira Reiner
called the nation's biggest auto insurance scam
roundup.
Two doctors and a lawyer were among those
charged with manufacturing phony injury
claims after accidents staged according to
scripts provided by ringleaders.
The arrests broke up two insurance fraud
rings which Reiner estimated had cost Los
Angeles insurance policy holders $45 million.
One ring had been in business for 10 years, he
said.
"Automobile insurance fraud is a billion
dollar underground industry," Reiner said and
warned consumers that they are paying for the
phony claims.
"In Los Angeles, we pay 50 cents on every
dollar of insurance premiums for fraud," he
said. "If your auto insurance rates are too
high, half of them are going to scam artists."
He said policyholders in other parts of Cali
fornia pay 25 percent of their premiums to
cover such fraud.
The charges, filed in four separate cases,
resulted from a multi-agency Auto Insurance
Fraud Task Force which sent investigators out
to pose as recruits for the fraud rings, Reiner
said.
