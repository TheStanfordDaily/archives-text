## End Nom Com now 
### 
Give the individual
committees chances
to choose members

The assu nominations
Commission needs to be
abolished; indeed, the entire
process by which students are cho
sen for the various University com
mittees has to be revamped.
Simply put, the current system
of filling student positions on Uni
versity committees is impractical
and inefficient.
Even now, many spaces are still
open, despite a spring selection
process in which many applicants
were turned down.
After all, what incentive does
Nom Com have for ensuring that
all the committees get all the stu
dents they need or that the stu
dents who are appointed are suffi
ciently qualified?
The answer is none whatsoever.
Nom Com has no stake in the effec
tiveness of the committees.
Moreover, it would be ridiculous
to expect that Nom Com could be
sufficiently expert in the needs of
all the committees to be able to
know which candidates are best
qualified to serve.
As it is, Nom Com has failed in
the one area in which it should
have excelled. With the appoint
ment process for all committees
centralized, Nom Com should have
been able to effectively publicize
the appointment process. It didn't.
Consider the fliers which listed
all the available positions. Com
mittee on this, committee on that,
the council of 15 What on
earth is the council of 15, and
who's going to take the time to
print up a resume for something
that he or she knows nothing
about?

We need a new system.
Each committee should be inde
pendently responsible for publiciz
ing and filling any and all of its stu
dent positions.
With the current process, com
mittees whose permanent mem
bers earnestly seek out student
opinion are continually snubbed by
Nom Corn's unreliable efforts to
fill student positions. Left to their
own devices, each committee
would ensure that it filled its posi
tions.
More important is the issue of
expertise. Different committees
address different issues. In the cur
rent system, a student can apply
for four different committee posi
tions and be accepted or refused
based on only one interview.
If each committee conducted its
own search, replacing the generic
interview with questions germane
to its particular responsibilities,
the likelihood of a strong match
between student and committee
would be greatly increased.
Certainly, such a transition
would require the various commit
tees to do more work recruiting
students than they have in the
past. Each committee would have
to advertise its openings.
But whereas Nom Com filled its
fliers with nothing but lists and
deadlines, the individual commit
tees could disseminate pertinent
information such as the specific
requirements of each position. The
individual committees could
answer questions like, "What does
this committee do?" and "How
often does it meet?"
Given such additional informa
tion, more students would be likely
to apply than have in the past, the
result of which would be an
improvement in the quality and
influence of student input on Uni
versity committees.
