Bisexuals face problems even within gay community

SO WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
coming out only as gay or lesbian?
The National Coming Out Day
article in the Oct. 11 Daily was a blatant
insult to many bisexual people who have
struggled to come out as bisexual in a
vehemently queer-hating society as well
as in a largely bi-phobic "gay and les
bian" community.
The complete failure to even mention
bisexual people in the article (let alone to
actually interview one) sends out a clear
message to people: It is not OK to come
out as bisexual.
This essentially forces those of us who
are bisexual to consider ourselves as

either straight or gay/lesbian, which is
ironically contrary to the very purpose of
Coming Out Day: being honest and
strong and open about who we are, even
in a society or community which
demands that we be otherwise.
Many bisexuals do not feel explicitly
included and welcomed in organizations
like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford and in events like Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week.
The omission of "Bisexual" in the
names of the organizations and events is
unfortunately paralleled in the bi-phobic
attitudes of several people within them
— as if a queer-hating mainstream isn't

enough for us to to deal with.
Unlearning bi-phobia is not easy, nor
is unlearning sexism and racism.
Just as the voices of women and of
people of color in organizations must not
be trivialized, invalidated or ignored, our
voice and our anger as bisexuals must be
listened to.
The stereotypes surrounding bisexual
ity threaten us in very real and very
immediate ways.
Some people have images of bisexuals
as sex-crazed maniacs screwing every
thing that moves; fence-sitters who are
so emotionally unstable that they cannot
ever maintain a long-term relationship
but desperately need to screw people of

both sexes on the side; and (perhaps
most dangerously) carriers of HIV from
the gay community to the "general popu
lation."
Just as with gays and lesbians, the
more we bi-women and bi-men come out,
the more we'll break down the stereo
types and provide positive images for
other people.
To rejoice and celebrate our diversity
and our beauty and our power and our
queerness is to affirm that all of us
queers — lesbian, gay, AND bisexual —
are indeed the fruit of this earth.
