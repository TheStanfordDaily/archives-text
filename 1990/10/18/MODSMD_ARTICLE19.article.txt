# New housing policy affirms rights of homosexual couples
## 
### 
An open letter to Kenny and Brandi
Ammann:
In your recent letter to The Daily, you
claimed that it does not make sense for
one university to treat homosexual cou
ples the same as it does married hetero
sexual couples while the State of
California and the United States do not
even grant the right of marriage to
homosexual couples.
Let me tell you what does not make
sense to me.
It does not make sense to me that the
State of California discriminates against
homosexual couples in the granting of
marriage licenses based on a policy of
fear, ignorance and prejudice.
It does not make sense to me that a
marriage certificate is seen by many to
be more important than love in deter
mining the validity of a relationship.
It does not make sense to me that

many heterosexuals cannot or will not
believe that there can be just as much
love and commitment between two
women or two men as there can be
between a man and a woman.
It does not make sense to me that
young intelligent people are willing to let
the State of California and the U.S. gov
ernment decide what is right and wrong.
And it does not make sense to me that
anyone should be upset by the granting
of equal rights to a group of people who
have long had none.
What does make sense to me is that
those favored by the inequality of the law
will forever support the status quo, even
if it means continuing the dehumanizing
process of stripping minorities of their
rights.
If it would make you angry to be
unable to obtain couples housing at
Stanford, think how you would feel if
you had gone to get your marriage
license and had been turned down
because the State of California had
declared your relationship invalid.
How would you have felt to be forced
to live in separate housing because you
did not have a marriage license?
Well, thanks to the new domestic

partner policy at Stanford and others
like it which may soon be enacted in
California, the day when this will no
longer happen to gay and lesbian couples
is a little bit closer.
A marriage valid in one state is valid
in any state. Thanks, Don.
