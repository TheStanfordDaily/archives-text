# Preparing for 'next time'
## Festival offers information on quake readiness 
### Roberta Woolley 
The annual "Quakefest" in White Plaza
yesterday afternoon brought together
earthquake preparedness groups and local
businesses to showcase quake safety pro
grams.
The Stanford Public Safety Department
has sponsored the Quakefest every October
for the past six years. This year's Quake
fest, also sponsored by the University
Earthquake Commission, is an anniversary
event commemorating last year's Loma
Prieta earthquake, according to Margaret
Wong, the Quakefest coordinator.
"A lot of people want to find out more
about earthquakes but they never find the
time," Wong said. "We hope that by putting
information right out in front of them we
can make the students more earthquake
aware."
Scientists now foresee a 67 percent
chance of a 7.0 or greater earthquake in the
Bay Area within the next 30 years, accord
ing to a U.S. Geological Survey display of
various earthquake maps and information
at the event. The agency distributed pam

phlets on earthquake safety and informa
tion on the San Andreas fault.
Local businesses such as Beehive Sup
plies and the Emergency Equipment Cen
ter displayed and promoted emergency
food, water and general survival kits.
Students sampled survival meals and
learned how to turn off a model gas tank.
"The food is almost as good as dorm food,"
commented one student who tasted the
packaged food. Various booths also sold
earthquake T-shirts and books.
ACME Fiberglass displayed a 4-by-9 foot
model of one of the 12 earthquake safety
silos buried at undisclosed locations around
campus. Company representatives dis
played food samples similar to the 40,000
food packets placed inside the buried silos
and demonstrated how to open the silos in
case of an earthquake emergency.
"I'm from the East Coast, and I've never
been through an earthquake before," said
Marc Berman, a freshman who attended
the event. "Seeing what happened to the
campus and seeing these necessary survival
kits here makes me realize how dangerous
[an earthquake] could be."
