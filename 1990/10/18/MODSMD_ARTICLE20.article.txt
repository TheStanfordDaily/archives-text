# Performance wasn't meant to offend
## 
### 
This is in reply to the letter titled "A
cappella songs stereotyped women" in
Tuesday's Daily.
When Henry's Haiku Hut tries to sell
an audience a "satanic haiku" that
sounds like Darth Vader speaking back
wards through an inner tube, the Stan
ford Fleet Street Singers do not really
intend the audience to consider convert
ing to devil worship.
Similarly, when one of the group
swaggers forward and gasps out a semi
articulate haiku (Beer flowing
wildly,l Out of total kegs while the,/ Babes
are major hot,) we don't mean to present

that character's attitudes in a compli
mentary light.
Basically, the character is a moron,
and his attitude toward women and alco
hol are a reflection of that.
We certainly agree that as performers
we have a responsibility to present per
formances which are sensitive to social
problems, and we are sorry if Henry's
Haiku Hut seemed to some audience
members to deviate from responsibility.
In the future, please feel free to speak
to any group member alter our perfor
mances or to call the business manager
at 323-2173 if you have suggestions
about our shows.
