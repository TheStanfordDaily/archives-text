## The 						message is still unity 
### 
Even though foot-tall
Afros, bell bottoms, Sister Sledge
and Black Power activists never
made it beyond the 19705, a campus cre
ation did: 20 years after its inception,
Stanford's black theme house lives.
In the beginning, the black theme
house was known by a different name and
housed in a different home than it is
today. But Ujamaa — even in its various
forms — always was and always will be
the home of unity. . .won't it?
"Ujamaa: The message is unity."
Yes, the message is unity. But after two
decades, is that message still reaching
every member of the black community?
It is true that in 1970, because Stan
ford's black population was much smaller,
it was easier for black students to come
together in the house and think of Uja
maa as their home whether or not they
lived there.
Although it is more difficult to achieve
unity now because our community is
larger and more diverse, unity is still nec
essary.
But perhaps we, as a black community,
should not simply seek to remember the
origins of our black theme house, but ask
ourselves if we have completely realized
the original goal of the house as well. If
the goal is unity, has it been achieved?
While there are those who would yell a
quick and resounding "yes," my own
response is more hesitant.
"Yes." It is true that Ujamaa is a nur
turing environment for its black resi
dents, especially black freshmen.
Often new black students, who are not
used to attending a majority white school.

find comfort in knowing that at least they
are not the minority in their own resi
dence.
These same freshmen also find a lot of
spiritual support in the house because
there are many other black students.
In other dorms, where there are often
as few as three black students in a 100-
person residence, new black students
have only a very limited support network.
In this respect, Ujamaa lives up to its
original goal.
But consider this: what about the
black students who do not live in the
house?
Although it is not every non-Ujamaa
frosh that feels left out of the house-based
black community, there are many who do
feel alienated.
And as long as there are those in the
black community who believe themselves
to be on the outside, then the original goal
of unity has not been achieved.
Ujamaa's staff and residents should
reach out to those freshmen who feel iso
lated and alienated. They should broaden
their ideas of "dorm unity" to encompass
"community unity" too.
Because by not actively working to
incorporate the whole of the black com
munity into the house, the black theme
house falls short of its original intent, and
the black community misses out on the
talents of our marginalized black peers.
Of course some may simply see this as
yet another "attack" on Ujamaa - a house
that is closely scrutinized and always
heavily criticized as a self-segregationist
bastion of blacks.
But hopefully those same people will

recall my own enthusiastic support of the
house - a house that promotes black
America's often unrecognized contribu
tions, and encourages people who other
wise may not learn about black culture to
experience it first-hand.
Ujamaa is a valuable experiment in liv-;
ing for both black and non-black students
alike and should always have a home on
this campus.
However, let us, as a black community,;
not be so defensive that we refrain from
being self-critical.
We cannot simply glorify all that is
black without question. It is only through
questioning ourselves about our own
practices and institutions that we will be
able to improve them.
Ujamaa is definitely one of the most
positive and successful projects that con
cerns Stanford's black students. Yet, it is
also problematic in that it is a project that
has the potential to exclude black stu
dents as well.
So as we remember the origins of the
black theme house during this 20th
anniversary year, let us also work to com
pletely realize the dorm's original goal of
completing community unity.
