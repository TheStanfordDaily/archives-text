## A 						tale of several cities 
### 
£ ■ joo hoo. My heart bleeds for my col
li league, Cameron Macky. His poor
£ -A—J Pirates "done played like s—" and
> lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the
National League Championship. What a
bummer.
And if there's anything that irritates
« me more than hearing Cameron com
« plain about the Bucs, it's listening to
Bay Area fans complain about the 49ers
? or the Athletics. Neither a Pittsburgh
fan nor a San Francisco/Oakland fan has
;* a legitimate sports gripe.
You both have had your fair share of
. championships. It's time to share the
5 wealth.

By my count, Macky has lived
through a Pirate world championship (in
1979) and four Steeler Super Bowl victo
ries in the 19705. That's five world
championships right there.
Bay Area fans have had it even better.
The A's won three straight world series
in the 1970s and one last year, the Nin
ers won four NFL titles over the last
decade and the Oakland Raiders won
two before heading south. Throw in the
Los Angeles Raiders' Super Bowl victory
in 1983, which doubtlessly pleased all of
the Raider fans still present in the Bay
Area, and that's 11 world championships
over the last two decades.
Combined, Pittsburgh and the Bay
Area have had 10 of 20 NFL titles and
five of 20 world series titles. So those of
you from these areas, be content with
your dynasties of the past.
In all fairness, I have little reason to
complain as well, having grown up in
Denver. Sure the Broncos have choked in
three of the last four Super Bowls, being
outscored 136-40 in those three losses.
But at least the boys in orange have
played in the title game. Similarly, the
Nuggets have had two 50-win seasons
and two Midwest Division titles over the
last decade.
No, I can't complain. I've been lucky
enough to be a fan of a couple of pretty
good teams.
But there are fans from certain cities
that have never had a winning team of
any sort. These are the fans that have
the reserved right to bemoan their mis
fortune.
Take, for example, Atlanta. The
Hawks are respectable but haven't yet
really contended for the Eastern Divi
sion crown.
Then there's the poor Falcons, who,
after a few good seasons in the early '80s

with stars like Steve Bartkowski and
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson, have been
absolutely inept since then. They
showed early season promise this year
with new head coach Jerry Galnville and
with new black uniforms, but are only 2-
3 in 1990.
The Falcons, however, are Atlanta's
talented team. The disgrace of Fulton
County is the hapless Braves. The peren
nial cellar dweller of the National
League West showed no improvement
this season over last year, finishing with
the worst record in the majors at 65-97.
But in spite of the team's lackluster per
formance year-in and year-out, it still
turns a profit thanks to the television
empire of team owner Ted Turner.
Turner and the Braves prove that win
ning isn't everything.
Teams from Seattle have also tradi
tionally been fairly bad. The Seahawks
have shown a remarkable penchant for
choking in the playoffs, though the
Mariners have yet to earn the right to
prove that they too can choke in the
playoffs.
Poor New Orleans not only had to suf
fer through the ignominious years of the
"Aint's," as the winless Saints were
often called, but had to endure the
migration of the NBA's Jazz to, of all
places, Utah.
Cleveland scratched its collective
head a two seasons ago when the Indi
ans, led by Cory Snider and Joe Carter,
finished last in the American League
East in spite of the fact that baseball
experts tabbed the Indians as the divi
sion's preseason favorite. All the while,
the Browns seemed to be finding new
ways to hand the Broncos a trip to the
Super Bowl. The Cavaliers? No titles
there.
But the fact is that some of us are des
tined to root for either perennial losers
or perennial runners-up. After all, we
can't all be from Pittsburgh or the Bay
Area or Los Angeles or New York or
Boston.
The fans from those cities should be
content with championships of years
past. And while we wait for our champi
onships, we must content ourselves with
the little victories.
In the inaugural season of Arena
Football (the "50-yard indoor war) the
Denver Dynamite finished the regular
season 4-2 and earned the right to face
the Pittsburgh Gladiators for the league
championship. Denver traveled to Pitts
burgh and shocked the Gladiators at
home to win the title.

ons of indoor football. The Pittsburgh
Gladiators, one-time Arena Football
Championship Game losers.
Eat your heart out, Cameron.

? or the Athletics. Neither a Pittsburgh
fan nor a San Francisco/Oakland fan has
;* a legitimate sports gripe.
You both have had your fair share of
. championships. It's time to share the
5 wealth.

By my count, Macky has lived
through a Pirate world championship (in
1979) and four Steeler Super Bowl victo
ries in the 19705. That's five world
championships right there.
Bay Area fans have had it even better.
The A's won three straight world series
in the 1970s and one last year, the Nin
ers won four NFL titles over the last
decade and the Oakland Raiders won
two before heading south. Throw in the
Los Angeles Raiders' Super Bowl victory
in 1983, which doubtlessly pleased all of
the Raider fans still present in the Bay
Area, and that's 11 world championships
over the last two decades.
Combined, Pittsburgh and the Bay
Area have had 10 of 20 NFL titles and
five of 20 world series titles. So those of
you from these areas, be content with
your dynasties of the past.
In all fairness, I have little reason to
complain as well, having grown up in
Denver. Sure the Broncos have choked in
three of the last four Super Bowls, being
outscored 136-40 in those three losses.
But at least the boys in orange have
played in the title game. Similarly, the
Nuggets have had two 50-win seasons
and two Midwest Division titles over the
last decade.
No, I can't complain. I've been lucky
enough to be a fan of a couple of pretty
good teams.
But there are fans from certain cities
that have never had a winning team of
any sort. These are the fans that have
the reserved right to bemoan their mis
fortune.
Take, for example, Atlanta. The
Hawks are respectable but haven't yet
really contended for the Eastern Divi
sion crown.
Then there's the poor Falcons, who,
after a few good seasons in the early '80s

with stars like Steve Bartkowski and
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson, have been
absolutely inept since then. They
showed early season promise this year
with new head coach Jerry Galnville and
with new black uniforms, but are only 2-
3 in 1990.
The Falcons, however, are Atlanta's
talented team. The disgrace of Fulton
County is the hapless Braves. The peren
nial cellar dweller of the National
League West showed no improvement
this season over last year, finishing with
the worst record in the majors at 65-97.
But in spite of the team's lackluster per
formance year-in and year-out, it still
turns a profit thanks to the television
empire of team owner Ted Turner.
Turner and the Braves prove that win
ning isn't everything.
Teams from Seattle have also tradi
tionally been fairly bad. The Seahawks
have shown a remarkable penchant for
choking in the playoffs, though the
Mariners have yet to earn the right to
prove that they too can choke in the
playoffs.
Poor New Orleans not only had to suf
fer through the ignominious years of the
"Aint's," as the winless Saints were
often called, but had to endure the
migration of the NBA's Jazz to, of all
places, Utah.
Cleveland scratched its collective
head a two seasons ago when the Indi
ans, led by Cory Snider and Joe Carter,
finished last in the American League
East in spite of the fact that baseball
experts tabbed the Indians as the divi
sion's preseason favorite. All the while,
the Browns seemed to be finding new
ways to hand the Broncos a trip to the
Super Bowl. The Cavaliers? No titles
there.
But the fact is that some of us are des
tined to root for either perennial losers
or perennial runners-up. After all, we
can't all be from Pittsburgh or the Bay
Area or Los Angeles or New York or
Boston.
The fans from those cities should be
content with championships of years
past. And while we wait for our champi
onships, we must content ourselves with
the little victories.
In the inaugural season of Arena
Football (the "50-yard indoor war) the
Denver Dynamite finished the regular
season 4-2 and earned the right to face
the Pittsburgh Gladiators for the league
championship. Denver traveled to Pitts
burgh and shocked the Gladiators at
home to win the title.
The Denver Dynamite, world champi
ons of indoor football. The Pittsburgh
Gladiators, one-time Arena Football
Championship Game losers.
Eat your heart out, Cameron.

£ ■ joo hoo. My heart bleeds for my col

National League Championship. What a
bummer.
And if there's anything that irritates
