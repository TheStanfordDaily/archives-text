Cardinal wins Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational

The Cardinal hit the bulls-eye yester
day after five years of missing the mark
at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational.
The tricky course threw many teams for
a loop, but not the Cardinal. The women
played through the Seattle rain, wind
and hail as if they'd been doing it for
years.
A few of the Cardinal golfers have,
including tournament champion,
Audrey Wooding. Wooding, who grew up
in the Seattle drizzle, shot a 226 to place
first. Going into the final round Wood
ing said, "I just need to keep my head on
straight and play smart."
Her smart playing paid off. This was
Wooding's first collegiate win.
"This puts her right up there with
the top college players in the country."
said coach Tim Baldwin, "and she keeps
improving weekly."
Wooding started off the tournament
with an impressive 73, then shot 76 and

77 in the following rounds. Wooding has
played at this tournament for several
years, so this hometown win was really
special.
Jodi Figley had a great final round,
shooting 75. She placed third overall
with 231. "Jodi played a great tourna
ment for us," said Baldwin. In earlier
rounds Figley shot 76 and 80.
Coming in fourth place was Adele
Moore with 232. Moore shot a 76 in the
third round, and 78 in both the first and
second rounds. Her plan to "go out and
play steady" in the third round seemed
to work.
Stephanie Davis, also from Washing
ton state, finished with a 239. In yester
day's round, she shot 83. With earlier
scores of 79 and 77 she finished in a
three-way tie for 11th place.
Freshman Melinda Daniels improved
her daily score once again by shooting
88 for a tournament total of 267.
Baldwin had nothing but praise for
the women's effort yesterday. "We
started with a one-shot lead over Okla
homa, but coming into the last nine
holes Oklahoma caught us and led by a
shot. We had really strong back nines
from Jodi and Adele. Of course, Audrey
played excellent golf throughout. It was
an excellent team effort."
The Cardinal finished with 928 while
Oklahoma tallied 932. The tournament
host, Washington, finished third at 951.
No. 4-ranked USC ended up in a disap
pointing seventh place with 984.

'This puts her right up
there with the top col
lege players in the
country, and she
keeps improving
weekly.'

This tournament brought anything
but disappointment for the Stanford
women. The Cardinal has not won a
tournament since playing at Hawaii, a
year and a half ago.
"It's been a long time coming and it's
a great win to get under our belt, espe
cially when we have an individual win
ner also," said Baldwin, "This is an
accumulation of a lot of good, hard work
by the girls."
And work they did. The weather was
once again miserable. Umbrellas, turtle
necks and sweaters were the fashion of
the day.
"We had very difficult playing condi
tions on a very difficult course," said
Baldwin. The Cardinal proved it could
handle the challenge this week and
come out on the top of the pile. The
women now have their sights set on the
Stanford Invitational next week.
