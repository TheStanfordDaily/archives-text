# Sophomore is leading by speeding

### Uri Attia Staff writer 
It's a good thing Ashley Black can't
wave a pom-pom.
After getting cut from the drill team
as a high school freshman, Black turned
to cross country running to occupy her
free time. The success that she has expe
rienced over her five-year career has
certainly been far greater than anything
that the drill team had to offer.
Black, a sophomore from Palos
Verdes, Calif., has emerged as a star this
year despite bearing the additional bur
den of being a team leader. Black is one
of a handful of upperclassmen on a Car
dinal squad that consists almost entirely
of freshmen. After what she terms a
sub-par year last year running for Stan
ford, she has dashed off several impres
sive times this year.
Earlier this season, she finished first
in the Ohio State Invitational, winning
with a time of 18:17 for the hilly five
kilometer course. The win was Black's
first as a collegiate runner and her

greatest racing thrill since high school.
What, you might ask, could top an
individual championship? When asked
to recount her greatest feat as a runner,
Black did not hesitate.
"Making the Kinney Nationals my
junior year was definitely my biggest
thrill," she said. "The top eight finishers
in our district race got to go, and I was
going back and forth with another run
ner for the final spot for most of the
race."
Using the mental tenacity and com
petitive drive that has helped her
throughout her career, she outsprinted
her opponent and headed for the
national championships. "During the
last half-mile of that race, I just thought
to myself, 'I've come this far, and there's
just no way I'm going to let her beat
me.' " And she didn't.
Black's high school career was simply
one success story after another. She
cracked the Palos Verdes High School
top seven in her freshman year despite
the fact that the team was far and away
the best in the state. The school was the

California Interscholastic Federation
champ in cross country her freshman
and sophomore years, and California
state champs for the next two seasons.
As a junior and a senior, she finished
sixth and fourth, respectively, at the
state championship meet. It was in high
school that she ran her personal best of
17:45.
After over a year of college running,
she finally appears ready to challenge
her record once again. "I think that [a
personal bestl is a reasonable goal for
the yeai;*.*he said. "Of course, I hope
that I can; do even better than that, but
if I can break 17:45, I'll be happy."
Black will have at least two chances
to break her old standard: Oct. 27, when
Stanford hosts the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, and Nov. 10, when
the team will travel to Fresno for the
District-8 meet. A first- or second-place
finish there would send the team to
Knoxville, Tenn., Nov. 19 for the NCAA
Championships.
