# Sophomore is leading by speeding
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
It's a good thing Ashley Black can't
wave a pom-pom.
After getting cut from the drill team
as a high school freshman, Black turned
to cross country running to occupy her
free time. The success that she has expe
rienced over her five-year career has
certainly been far greater than anything
that the drill team had to offer.
Black, a sophomore from Palos
Verdes, Calif., has emerged as a star this
year despite bearing the additional bur
den of being a team leader. Black is one
of a handful of upperclassmen on a Car
dinal squad that consists almost entirely
of freshmen. After what she terms a
sub-par year last year running for Stan
ford, she has dashed off several impres
sive times this year.
Earlier this season, she finished first
in the Ohio State Invitational, winning
with a time of 18:17 for the hilly five
kilometer course. The win was Black's
first as a collegiate runner and her

greatest racing thrill since high school.
What, you might ask, could top an
individual championship? When asked
to recount her greatest feat as a runner,
Black did not hesitate.
"Making the Kinney Nationals my
junior year was definitely my biggest
thrill," she said. "The top eight finishers
in our district race got to go, and I was
going back and forth with another run
ner for the final spot for most of the
race."
Using the mental tenacity and com
petitive drive that has helped her
throughout her career, she outsprinted
her opponent and headed for the
national championships. "During the
last half-mile of that race, I just thought
to myself, 'I've come this far, and there's
just no way I'm going to let her beat
me.' " And she didn't.
Black's high school career was simply
one success story after another. She
cracked the Palos Verdes High School
top seven in her freshman year despite
the fact that the team was far and away
the best in the state. The school was the

California Interscholastic Federation
champ in cross country her freshman
and sophomore years, and California
state champs for the next two seasons.
As a junior and a senior, she finished
sixth and fourth, respectively, at the
state championship meet. It was in high
school that she ran her personal best of
17:45.
After over a year of college running,
she finally appears ready to challenge
her record once again. "I think that [a
personal bestl is a reasonable goal for
the yeai;*.*he said. "Of course, I hope
that I can; do even better than that, but
if I can break 17:45, I'll be happy."
Black will have at least two chances
to break her old standard: Oct. 27, when
Stanford hosts the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, and Nov. 10, when
the team will travel to Fresno for the
District-8 meet. A first- or second-place
finish there would send the team to
Knoxville, Tenn., Nov. 19 for the NCAA
Championships.
The women's cross country pro
gram has relied heavily on its
freshmen all season long. They
have outdone themselves, and a
team that was once considered to
be two years away from becoming
a favorite in the Pac-10 has
become a force before its time.
The team, in turn, has depended
and continues to rely on runners
such as Black for leadership.
"Nobody really expects, as a
sophomore, to be in a leadership
position, but we have a very
young team," Black said. "Some
one once referred to me as a team
captain (the team has no official
captains), and that sounded really
strange." The role has had no
adverse effect upon Black's run
ning, as she has bettered last
year's times by an average of
almost a full minute.
Despite the vast improvement
in her running, Black, exhibiting
a sort of dissatisfaction in her
own performance that is the mark
of a great athlete, strives for still
greater achievements. "I would
like to finish in the top 10 at Pac
-10s," she said. "I'm not sure what
kind of time it will take to get
that, but I think I can do it."
If she succeeds in her goal, it is
very likely that she will wind up
taking teammate Jill Shenkel
with her. Shenkel, also a sopho
more, and Black have been
engaged in what Black calls an

"extremely friendly rivalry" that
has worked for their mutual ben
efit.
"Jill has helped me a lot," Black
said. "We compete with each
other, but we're competitive in a
very good way. We manage to help
each other out without hurting
each other in any way." Black and

'Nobody really

ership position, but
we have a very young
team. Someone once
referred to me as a
team captain (the
team has no official
captains), and that
sounded really
strange.'

Shenkel are currently trading
places among the number two
and three positions on the team,
behind senior Melanie Bloch.
Her relationship with Shenkel
is just one of the many reasons
that Black is enjoying practices
and meets more than last year.
"We're having much more fun
this season," Black said. "The fact
that we're all getting along so well
has helped our performance as a
team."

that, but I think I can do it."
If she succeeds in her goal, it is
very likely that she will wind up
taking teammate Jill Shenkel
with her. Shenkel, also a sopho
more, and Black have been
engaged in what Black calls an

"extremely friendly rivalry" that
has worked for their mutual ben
efit.
"Jill has helped me a lot," Black
said. "We compete with each
other, but we're competitive in a
very good way. We manage to help
each other out without hurting
each other in any way." Black and

'Nobody really
expects, as a sopho
more, to be in a lead
ership position, but
we have a very young
team. Someone once
referred to me as a
team captain (the
team has no official
captains), and that
sounded really
strange.'

Shenkel are currently trading
places among the number two
and three positions on the team,
behind senior Melanie Bloch.
Her relationship with Shenkel
is just one of the many reasons
that Black is enjoying practices
and meets more than last year.
"We're having much more fun
this season," Black said. "The fact
that we're all getting along so well
has helped our performance as a
team."
And so has Ashley Black.
It's a good thing Ashley Black can't
wave a pom-pom.
After getting cut from the drill team
as a high school freshman, Black turned
to cross country running to occupy her
free time. The success that she has expe
rienced over her five-year career has
certainly been far greater than anything
that the drill team had to offer.
Black, a sophomore from Palos
Verdes, Calif., has emerged as a star this
year despite bearing the additional bur
den of being a team leader. Black is one
of a handful of upperclassmen on a Car
dinal squad that consists almost entirely
of freshmen. After what she terms a
sub-par year last year running for Stan
ford, she has dashed off several impres
sive times this year.
Earlier this season, she finished first
in the Ohio State Invitational, winning
with a time of 18:17 for the hilly five
kilometer course. The win was Black's
first as a collegiate runner and her

greatest racing thrill since high school.
What, you might ask, could top an
individual championship? When asked
to recount her greatest feat as a runner,
Black did not hesitate.
"Making the Kinney Nationals my
junior year was definitely my biggest
thrill," she said. "The top eight finishers
in our district race got to go, and I was
going back and forth with another run
ner for the final spot for most of the
race."
Using the mental tenacity and com
petitive drive that has helped her
throughout her career, she outsprinted
her opponent and headed for the
national championships. "During the
last half-mile of that race, I just thought
to myself, 'I've come this far, and there's
just no way I'm going to let her beat
me.' " And she didn't.
Black's high school career was simply
one success story after another. She
cracked the Palos Verdes High School
top seven in her freshman year despite
the fact that the team was far and away
the best in the state. The school was the

California Interscholastic Federation
champ in cross country her freshman
and sophomore years, and California
state champs for the next two seasons.
As a junior and a senior, she finished
sixth and fourth, respectively, at the
state championship meet. It was in high
school that she ran her personal best of
17:45.
After over a year of college running,
she finally appears ready to challenge
her record once again. "I think that [a
personal bestl is a reasonable goal for
the yeai;*.*he said. "Of course, I hope
that I can; do even better than that, but
if I can break 17:45, I'll be happy."
Black will have at least two chances
to break her old standard: Oct. 27, when
Stanford hosts the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, and Nov. 10, when
the team will travel to Fresno for the
District-8 meet. A first- or second-place
finish there would send the team to
Knoxville, Tenn., Nov. 19 for the NCAA
Championships.
The women's cross country pro
gram has relied heavily on its
freshmen all season long. They
have outdone themselves, and a
team that was once considered to
be two years away from becoming
a favorite in the Pac-10 has
become a force before its time.
The team, in turn, has depended
and continues to rely on runners
such as Black for leadership.
"Nobody really expects, as a
sophomore, to be in a leadership
position, but we have a very
young team," Black said. "Some
one once referred to me as a team
captain (the team has no official
captains), and that sounded really
strange." The role has had no
adverse effect upon Black's run
ning, as she has bettered last
year's times by an average of
almost a full minute.
Despite the vast improvement
in her running, Black, exhibiting
a sort of dissatisfaction in her
own performance that is the mark
of a great athlete, strives for still
greater achievements. "I would
like to finish in the top 10 at Pac
-10s," she said. "I'm not sure what
kind of time it will take to get
that, but I think I can do it."
If she succeeds in her goal, it is
very likely that she will wind up
taking teammate Jill Shenkel
with her. Shenkel, also a sopho
