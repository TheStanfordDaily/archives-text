# Another Nobel for Stanford
## Physicist wins for quark research 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
Dr. Richard Taylor, professor of
physics at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, was awarded
the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics
yesterday, becoming the second
Stanford professor this year to
win the prestigious Nobel award.
Taylor won the prize for
research proving that protons and
neutrons, once thought to be the
basic particles of matter, are actu
ally composed of smaller particles
called quarks.
He becomes the tenth Nobel
laureate on the Stanford faculty
and the second at SLAC. SLAC
director Burton Richter received a
Nobel Prize for Physics in 1976.
In addition, five scholars affiliated
with the Hoover Institution have
also won the award.
The Nobel Prize in Economics
was awarded Tuesday to Gradu
ate School of Business Prof.
William Sharpe, who will share
the prize with two professors, one
at the University of Chicago and
the other at the City University of
New York.
Taylor will share the physics
prize with two of his colleagues
from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Jerome Friedman
and Henry Kendall.
From 1967 through 1973, the
three researchers led a group of
about 30 scientists who conducted
experiments in which high-energy
electrons produced by the acceler
ator were fired at high speed at
protons and neutrons. The pat
terns caused by the collision ofthe
particles confirmed the existence

of quarks.
Scientists had been trying since
1964 to isolate the quark, but had
failed before the experiments of
Taylor and his team.
Using giant magnetic devices,
called spectrometers, to observe
the results of collisions between
electrons and either protons or
neutrons, the research team dis
covered not just one, but five dif
ferent kinds of quarks. A sixth
type is believed to exist, although
it has not yet been identified.

The SLAC physicist
becomes the second
Stanford professor in
as many days to win a
Nobel Prize.

Speaking to reporters at a press
conference yesterday, Taylor
downplayed his role in the experi
ments, lauding the contributions
of every member of his research
team. "I'm here because I'm the
oldest and probably the loudest of
that group," he said.
He also credited former SLAC
director Wolfgang Panofsky for
"his vision and hard work" in
making the experiment possible.
Still, Taylor noted that his
work was important because it
examined "the structure of the
proton, which I think of as the
structure of matter."
