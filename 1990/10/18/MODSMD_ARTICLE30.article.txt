# Stanford puts No. 5 ranking to the test at USC tonight
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
In two and a half years at Stanford,
Kristin Klein has done a fair number of
things. The junior from Pacififc Palisades,
palif., has been named first team All-
American, Pacific 10 Conference Fresh
bnan of the Year and All-tournament in
three different competitions. Klein has
played for a team that went 28-3 and has
set a kills pace that will make her the
most prolific attacker in school history.
►; Kristin Klein has never beaten UCLA.
\\ In five career matches with the Bruins,

Klein and her Cardinal teammates have
been on the losing end five consecutive
times. That, however, is bound to change.
The Cardinal will get another chance
to right some wrongs as the team travels
to Southern California to clash with USC
tonight and No. 1 UCLA tomorrow. While
No. 5 Stanford hesitates to completely
overlook the Trojans, the Cardinal cer
tainly has one overriding objective in
mind right now.
"We all know we can beat USC," Klein
said. "Our main focus is UCLA."
No offense intended, Southern Cal.
But USC has had its problems this sea

son. The Trojans were expected to finish
third in the Pac-10 this year and started
the season with a lofty national ranking.
Due to a 7-8 overall record and a 4-5
league mark, USC has fallen from
national esteem.
The Trojans can boast of two top-flight
players in seniors Lonise Norfleet and
Megan McCallister. Norfleet is one of the
conference's hardest hitters and is the
team leader in kills at the moment.
McCallister is second in kills on the team
and is the leading digger. The two, how
ever, are hitting .228 and .224 respec
tively.

Stanford has already defeated USC
this season, toppling Southern Cal 15-10,
15-7, 15-9 at Burnham Pavilion in the
team's first home match of the season.
Since then, the squads have gone in oppo
site directions.
"USC is struggling right now," Stan
ford coach Don Shaw said. "I expected
them to be better than they have been.
But last time we went down, they played
a flawless match."
While some Stanford players may
remember this stunning loss to Southern
Cal last season, most will probably recall
last week's monumental victory against
No. 2 Nebraska more clearly.
"Right now, we feel really good about
going down because we're coming off
such a big win," All-American Bev Oden
said. "We couldn't be in a better position."
The team probably couldn't. Stanford
has all its offensive cylinders running in
fine form as the team prepares to meet its
Southern foes. Oden, Klein and junior
Amy Cooper are all playing at peak level
and stock the most dreaded arsenal in the
country.

Cooper had a week that would make
some players' careers look uneventful. In
three matches last week, the 6-foot-2
middle blocker hit .702, including a per
fect attacking performance against Cali
fornia. In the match, she tallied 13 kills in
13 attempts to set the NCAA record for
highest hitting percentage in a match
with at least 10 attempts. For her
achievements, Cooper was named Pac-10
Player of the Week.
Outside hitter Klein continues to
pound opponents' floors out of recogni
tion. She currently is hitting .318 on the
season and has 221 total kills. An adept

player, Klein is also the team leader in
digs with 188.
Sophomore Oden continues to amaze.
The Irvine, Calif., attacker is the team
leader in kills with 240 and blocks with
82. She is hitting .353 over the season and
has managed to save her best for the big
teams. In the team's matches against No.
1 UCLA, No. 2 University of the Pacific
and No. 4 Nebraska, Oden has hit .445
and has averaged 23.3 kills a match. The
last time the Cardinal played UCLA,
Oden left the Bruins gaping with a 29-
kill, 22-dig performance.
While Stanford has had problems solv
ing the Bruin mystique, the team
promises that things will be different this
time around. "We have finally proven to
ourselves that we can play with any
team," Klein said. "We're really fired up."
This match will be the last opportunity
for the Cardinal to undo UCLA before the
NCAA tournament. If the Bruins win,
they will have a virtual lock on the confer
ence championship. The conference win
ners traditionally have first say as to the
location of the Western Regional.
"We'll be really disappointed if we lose
because we know we can beat them,"
Oden said.

attackers, former Stanford men'i volleyball

Stanford has already defeated USC
this season, toppling Southern Cal 15-10,
15-7, 15-9 at Burnham Pavilion in the
team's first home match of the season.
Since then, the squads have gone in oppo
site directions.
"USC is struggling right now," Stan
ford coach Don Shaw said. "I expected
them to be better than they have been.
But last time we went down, they played
a flawless match."
While some Stanford players may
remember this stunning loss to Southern
Cal last season, most will probably recall
last week's monumental victory against
No. 2 Nebraska more clearly.
"Right now, we feel really good about
going down because we're coming off
such a big win," All-American Bev Oden
said. "We couldn't be in a better position."
The team probably couldn't. Stanford
has all its offensive cylinders running in
fine form as the team prepares to meet its
Southern foes. Oden, Klein and junior
Amy Cooper are all playing at peak level
and stock the most dreaded arsenal in the
country.

Cooper had a week that would make
some players' careers look uneventful. In
three matches last week, the 6-foot-2
middle blocker hit .702, including a per
fect attacking performance against Cali
fornia. In the match, she tallied 13 kills in
13 attempts to set the NCAA record for
highest hitting percentage in a match
with at least 10 attempts. For her
achievements, Cooper was named Pac-10
Player of the Week.
Outside hitter Klein continues to
pound opponents' floors out of recogni
tion. She currently is hitting .318 on the
season and has 221 total kills. An adept

player, Klein is also the team leader in
digs with 188.
Sophomore Oden continues to amaze.
The Irvine, Calif., attacker is the team
leader in kills with 240 and blocks with
82. She is hitting .353 over the season and
has managed to save her best for the big
teams. In the team's matches against No.
1 UCLA, No. 2 University of the Pacific
and No. 4 Nebraska, Oden has hit .445
and has averaged 23.3 kills a match. The
last time the Cardinal played UCLA,
Oden left the Bruins gaping with a 29-
kill, 22-dig performance.
While Stanford has had problems solv
ing the Bruin mystique, the team
promises that things will be different this
time around. "We have finally proven to
ourselves that we can play with any
team," Klein said. "We're really fired up."
This match will be the last opportunity
for the Cardinal to undo UCLA before the
NCAA tournament. If the Bruins win,
they will have a virtual lock on the confer
ence championship. The conference win
ners traditionally have first say as to the
location of the Western Regional.
"We'll be really disappointed if we lose
because we know we can beat them,"
Oden said.
Card notes
To simulate some of the hard-hitting UCLA
attackers, former Stanford men'i volleyball
setter Parker Blackmail and Shaw himself
participated in practice this week. Blackman
graduated last year afler setting the Cardinal
to a third-place WIVA finish and a No. 1 rank
ing throughout much of the season. He is cur
rently playing with the U.S. National Team.


Al Green — Dally
After a thrilling victory over second-ranked Nebraska last week, the Cardinal women's volleyball team has little time to
relax. Kristin Klein and Co. will be put to the test again this weekend with matches at USC and No. 1 UCLA.
In two and a half years at Stanford,
Kristin Klein has done a fair number of
things. The junior from Pacififc Palisades,
palif., has been named first team All-
American, Pacific 10 Conference Fresh
bnan of the Year and All-tournament in
three different competitions. Klein has
played for a team that went 28-3 and has
set a kills pace that will make her the
most prolific attacker in school history.
►; Kristin Klein has never beaten UCLA.
\\ In five career matches with the Bruins,

Klein and her Cardinal teammates have
been on the losing end five consecutive
times. That, however, is bound to change.
The Cardinal will get another chance
to right some wrongs as the team travels
to Southern California to clash with USC
tonight and No. 1 UCLA tomorrow. While
No. 5 Stanford hesitates to completely
overlook the Trojans, the Cardinal cer
tainly has one overriding objective in
mind right now.
"We all know we can beat USC," Klein
said. "Our main focus is UCLA."
No offense intended, Southern Cal.
But USC has had its problems this sea

son. The Trojans were expected to finish
third in the Pac-10 this year and started
the season with a lofty national ranking.
Due to a 7-8 overall record and a 4-5
league mark, USC has fallen from
national esteem.
The Trojans can boast of two top-flight
players in seniors Lonise Norfleet and
Megan McCallister. Norfleet is one of the
conference's hardest hitters and is the
team leader in kills at the moment.
McCallister is second in kills on the team
and is the leading digger. The two, how
ever, are hitting .228 and .224 respec
tively.

Stanford has already defeated USC
this season, toppling Southern Cal 15-10,
