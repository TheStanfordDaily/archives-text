# Sailing squad starts season successfully

A view across the Bay and
around the nation in the past
weeks showed the Stanford sailors
off to an incredible fall start.
Although classes began only three
weeks ago, the Stanford sailing
team has already competed in five
mcyor regattas. With strong show
ings in the West Coast fall champi
onships, singlehanded champi
onships and West Coast women's
fall championships as well as two
prestigious East Coast intersec
tionals, the team has proven that
it has the depth and talent to win
the national championship.
At the traditionally tough
Harry Anderson Regatta at Yale
and the Nevins Trophy at Kings
Point, the Cardinal sailed consis
tently strong and posted two top
-10 finishes. At Yale, the team
made its best showing in years.
Senior Dave Dowd and Dominique
Blom finished sixth in an A divi
sion tightly packed by some of the
country's best sailors. In B divi
sion, Matt Sanford and Jen Yeh
came back from a rocky start,
moving up four places on the sec
ond day to finish eighth.
Although they improved Sun
day, the team was edged out by a
strong Tufts team and placed sev
enth out of 17 overall.
"Racing in the East in the
beginning of the season always
gives us a taste of what we're up
against for the spring. I think
Stanford is really up to the chal
lenge this year, " said Dowd. "The

most important thing is that the
team stays focused on our goal â€”
to win nationals." Stanford placed
eighth in last year's team racing
nationals at MIT.
At Kings Point, Stanford again
battled the nation's top teams.
Dowd and Sanford teamed up
with crews Heidi Park and
Catherine Ivey. Senior A 1 Sargent
also joined them in this three-divi
sion event.
The Cardinal again soared with
the best in the nation, combining
top-10 finishes in all three divi
sions to place a close eighth
behind St. Mary's.
Although pleased by their over
all finish, the team felt that it
could have done substantially bet
ter. Coach Blake Middleton said,
"The funny thing about it is that
we didn't come close to sailing up
to our potential, and yet were still
finishing in the top 10." Based on
these two regattas, the Cardinal
will be ranked 11th in the country
as the fall season begins.
Returning to the West Coast,
Stanford sailors set out to prove
their dominance. Two weekends
ago at California, the team
romped in the season opener, the
Stoney Burke West Coast Fall
Championships. Stanford pushed
Cal back to a third-place finish
after a the two teams were tied
following the first day's races.
Dowd and Ivey in A, joined by
Rick Rosen and Rebecca Bryson in
B, garnered the championship for
Stanford.
Fighting back from a prema

ture start on Saturday, they fol
lowed Bryson and Rosen's huge
30-point win in their division to
take first place. Even more
impressive than just winning the
regatta, the Cardinal also took
second with Brady Sih and Matt
Dunbar in A and Peter Somers
and Paula Gani in B; and fourth
place with Haley King and Jen
Yeh in A and Jeremy Mclntyre
and Geoff Mac Donald in B,
emphasizing the overwhelming
Stanford dominance on the West
Coast.
"The confidence that this team
is showing on the water this early
in the year is fantastic," said
Somers, who clearly remembers
Stanford's disappointing loss of
last year's Northern California
Series to Cal.
In the past weekend's action,
the Stanford women's team,
presently ranked eighth in the
nation and definitely moving up,
sailed in the fall championship at
Redwood City, while the laser
team traveled down to Santa Cruz
for the national qualifier. At the
Stanford sailing center, King and
Gani led the team with an impres
sive 16-point victory.
King, a sophomore and the
women's captain, is a dominant
force in women's events as well as
a strong contender in the coed
regattas. This victory carries
extra importance, as it determines
the berths awarded to intersec
tionals next spring. Stanford
women sailed impressively
throughout the fleet, as Ivey and

Amy Lightner placed fifth, a mere ;
six points out of third.
The singlehanded team of Sar-!
gent and Sanford came up just shy
in their bid for nationals. In
extremely light winds at Santa
Cruz, the two sailors battled with ;
14 other competitors. UC-Irvine's
Randy Lake had the event
wrapped up early in the second
day but the second spot remained
in hot contention. Sargent, who
made the cut last year and fin-;
ished ninth at nationals, was
favored to take the other national
place, only to have three disap
pointing races near the end of the
regatta.
Although he came out strong in
the last two races, he couldn't
quite close the point gap, losing
second by a single point to
Hawaii's JefT Olsen. The series
came down to the last second of
the last race when Olsen beat
Sargeant by inches at the finish.
Sanford, who trailed by 23 points
with five races to go, sailed
strongly too late in the races and
could only climb back to within
eight points of Olsen for a fourth
place finish.
Both sailors were frustrated
with their near misses. "We just
didn't quite get the job done. The
regatta was ours to take, and we
fell short," said Sanford.
The Cardinal sailors face their
most important fall challenge in
three weeks at the North-South
intersectional at Santa Barbara.
