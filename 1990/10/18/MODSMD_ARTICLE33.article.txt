# Israeli advocates negotiation
## 
### Ashok Rai Staff writer 
In an impassioned and pow
erful speech Tuesday, Israeli
student Eviatar Shafrir argued
that his government should
change with the times, remove
their "big ear plugs" and push
for dialogue as a means to settle
the Arab-Israeli conflict in the
Middle East.
Shafrir, a graduate student in
industrial engineering, spoke as
part of a series of noon presen
tations titled "International
Perspectives on Peace," held at
the Bechtel International Cen
ter.
Shafrir served in the Israeli
army from 1977 to 1980, and his
undergraduate education was
interrupted when he was called
to participate in the war against
Lebanon in 1982. He has been
at Stanford since 1985.
He pointed out that in this
"pragmatic world of 1990,"
where even Nelson Mandela and
F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
have sat down at the same table
and attempted to sort out their
differences, it is possible to
resolve the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict by negotiation.

He spoke of the Palestine
Liberation Organization as a
viable player in bringing stabil
ity to the Middle East. Terror
ism is a matter of perception, he
argued, citing examples of
nations where former "terror
ists," like Robert Mugabe in
Rhodesia or Indian revolution
aries under British rule,
replaced governments that they
had opposed.
Shafrir's talk was inter
rupted several times by shout
ing from audience members,
one of whom said that Shafrir's
opinion was unrepresentative of
Israeli student sentiment and
was being presented as fact.
Shafrir said Israelis take
pride in perceiving themselves
as the "chosen people" and in
their justice system, which is
strong enough to convict high
ranking Israeli military officers
for misuse of power. Conse
quently, Israelis claim "moral
high ground" in the conflict
with the Palestinians, in
Shafrir's view.
Shafrir, pointing to Israeli
actions that caused Palestinians
to flee after the 1948 war, said
this claim of a higher morality is
partly a myth. Giving examples

of undemocratic Arab states or
Arabs who engage in civilian
bloodshed is no justification for
Israeli policy, he said, because
they are not the standard for
Israeli morality.
Negotiations have not taken
place, Shafrir observed, because
the Israelis are afraid of losing
this moral superiority, while the
Arabs are unwilling to lose face.
Shafrir turned to the current
Persian Gulf crisis in the last
few minutes of his presentation.
He said he thought Israel's mil
itary would very much like to
have a war, but would do it only
with support from its political
establishment.
He also dismissed Iraqi Pres
ident Saddam Hussein's idea of
linking Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait to Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip
as "gibberish."
Shafrir was hopeful that
Egypt could be the
place" for resolution."
"If there is a peaceful solu
tion in the Gulf then there is no
question in my mind that there
is a peaceful solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict," he
concluded.
