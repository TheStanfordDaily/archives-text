# Symposium addresses right to die
## 
### Gerard Manning 
The question of a patient's right to die was tack
led at yesterday's symposium titled "Instituting and
Withdrawing Life-Support from Adults: The impli
cations of the recent Supreme Court decision
regarding Nancy Cruzan."
Thomas Rafiin and Eml6 Young, professors at
the School of Medicine and co-directors of the Stan
ford Center for Biomedical Ethics, joined Law Prof.
Henry Greely to discuss the legal and ethical ques
tions of the Nancy Cruzan case with an audience of
about 400 people in Fairchild Auditorium.
In 1983, then 26-year-old Cruzan suffered severe
brain damage in a car crash. After three weeks in a
coma, she woke to a persistent vegetative state in
which she could breathe, sleep and wake, but
showed no signs of awareness and could not make
directed movements.
Part of her brain functioned in maintaining body
metabolism, but no signs of any thought processes
were found. Soon after waking, she lost the ability to
swallow and since then has been kept alive by a feed
ing tube inserted into her stomach. Doctors say
Cruzan could be kept alive in this state for up to 30
years.
Some 10,000 patients in the United States are
now in this state. The condition was thought to be
irreversible until Carrie Coons, an 86-year-old
woman, regained consciousness after five months —
only days after her family had been granted a court
order to remove her feeding tube. Since then, she
has fallen back into a vegetative state and no other
recoveries have been reported.
When no recovery was seen, Cruzan's parents
requested removal of her feeding tube, which was
denied by the hospital. In the ensuing court battle,
the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that the hospital
could not be forced to remove life support.
An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court upheld that
decision by a 5-4 ruling. The decision, Greely said,
indicates that the court does believe in a right to die
but found this right inapplicable in the Cruzan case.

Cruz an's parents have since gathered more evi
dence that she had expressed a wish not to be kept
on life support. As a result, the state of Missouri has
dropped its challenge to their request to have life
support removed.
Young spoke on the ethical questions of high
technology intensive care, which he described as "a
double-edged sword" which could save life, but could
also prolong the suffering of the terminally ill. He
quoted California law, which weighs the benefits of
invasive medical action with its potential harm. Sim
ply continuing life support is not avoiding a decision,
he argued, but rather a course of action with definite
repercussions.
Many states, including California, now recognize
the right to refuse extraordinary medical interven
tion. In cases such as Cruzan's, where the patient is
legally incompetent to make any decisions, a durable
power of attorney form signed before a life-threaten
ing situation arises may decide the matter. This doc
ument records whether or not the patient wishes to
be kept alive on life support.
The speakers urged the audience to complete
such forms, which were available at the symposium.
In cases where the patient is incompetent and has
not left the power of attorney, the guardians or fam
ily of the patient are left to decide whether or not life
support should be continued.
The ethics center was established in January by
Young and Rafiln to provide education and research
on questions of medical ethics at Stanford. A
required ethics course has been established for med
ical students and the center is currently working
with staff at Stanford Hospital.
In addition, the center conducts research on
bioethics through visiting scholars and its own
research staff, and a master's course in bioethics is
now being planned.
The series of public programs continues today
with a talk by Dr. H. Rex Greene of the University of
Southern California titled "Has the time come to
decriminalize drugs?" The program will take place
in room Mlo4 of the Medical Center.
