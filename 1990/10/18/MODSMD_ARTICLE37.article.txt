# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY DEEP PURPLE 
### Margaret Fitzpatrick 
For the duration of the radiation treatment for
cancer, purple ink marks the body that is to be
treated.
"Purple Breasts," beginning its current Bay Area
tour at Foothill College this weekend, is a new play
dealing with one woman's struggle against breast
cancer. Based on the personal experience of primary
writer and producer Daryl Lyndstrom, who suc
cumbed to metastatic breast cancer on Oct. 29,
1989, the terrifying scenario of a worst nightmare
come true is played out for the purpose of facilitat
ing dialogue about breast cancer.
Stanford alumna Allaire Paterson, co-producer,
co-author and lead in the play, said of the play, "It's
heavy, but I also try to emphasize that it is positive
and that there is humor in it. It's not so much
about dying as it is about living with cancer."
Margaret Vaughan, reviewing the play for The
Glasgow Herald after the Edinburgh Festival Fringe
this summer in Scotland, explained, "Compassion
ate humour lightened what might have been a
starkly dismal piece of theatre."
The late Lyndstrom decided to create and pro
duce the play to present the often overlooked
patient's point of view, the sometimes dehumaniz
ing aspects of treatment and the alternatives avail
able to help a cancer patient regain some sense of
control over her life.
She began developing the play by bringing
together Paterson, Gloria Galant Symon, Susan
McMahon and Sidney Markus. These four women
proceeded to cowrite the play with Lyndstrom by
watching videotapes on breast cancer, discussing
the topic and then exploring the issues at a deeper
level by improvisational acting.
"Purple Breasts" was first presented as a work in
progress at San lose City College in March 1989. It
has since developed into a more polished piece of
theater; According to Lyndstrom's wishes, the third
and current incarnation of the play was presented
at the Tidlnburgfffestival and continues to receive
more and more exposure.

Symon and Paterson,
who are now co-produc
ing the play, hope the
current tour will attract
an underwriter to trans
late the play onto video
tape. "The beauty of live
theater is that you're
breathing with the per
son," Paterson said.
"But a videotape could
be used as an educa
tional tool, particularly
for health care Drofes-

sionals. They need to be more aware of the
patient's perspective."
Symon stressed that the next big step is to have
the play published. "We need to have it out there so
it can be seen by as many theatergoers as possible,
because bringing the issues out in the open can help
patients, caretakers and everyone involved."
After each performance, there is a discussion
session between the audience and the actors, dur
ing which people can raise questions, or just talk
about their feelings and impressions of the work.
One of the main points that the artists are trying to
convey through the play and in the discussions is
that a cancer patient does have choices.

Anguish of Breast Cancer

"Choose your treatment," Pater
son said. "Be actively involved. Be
as educated as you can." Some of
the lesser known options explored
are transcendental meditation,
macrobiotics and Chinese herbal
remedies.
Symon explained that the
awareness of choices can empower
all people, not only cancer
patients. "It's not just about can
cer," she said. "It's about relation
ships. It's about living in the
moment. It's as much about living
as it is about facing death. You
don't have to be involved with can
cer to get a lot out of the play."
As to the long-term future
prospects of the play, Paterson
said, "I wish it could be a period
piece, and no one will want to do it
because a cure will have been
found. Dying from breast cancer
will be a thing of the past."
