The bare necessities. Words
are good enough to get those.
Almost inevitably, though,
they fail to express the heights
and depths of the human spirit.
For that, there is music, wherein

each note reveals both joys and
sorrows of generations. Music is
the history of the soul.
And "just as history moves
on," writes musician Juan Jorge
Laura, "so the creative energy
and innovation of each era
develop and find expression in
living music."
This Friday, Laura and his
five-member group, Rumillajta,


Cellist Janos Starker will perform with pianist Dennis Russell
Davles Tuesday and Wednesday In Dlnkelspiel Auditorium.

innovation inspired by their lives
and history in Bolivia.
"It reflects the mystery of the
mountains. . . the jungle. .
Laura says of the group's music.
"It expresses the ancient and living
belief in mother earth and father
sun."
Many of group's 15 different
instruments, which include gigan
tic panpipes, are handmade by the
musicians. This tradition extends
back over 400 years to the pre-
Incan Bolivian Andes, where some
group members trace their ances
try.
Rumillajta has recorded eight
albums, and has toured through
out Europe. Last year's appearance
at the Santa Fe Chamber Music
Festival marked the group's first
U.S. performance.
