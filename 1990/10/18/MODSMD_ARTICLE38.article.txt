The bare necessities. Words
are good enough to get those.
Almost inevitably, though,
they fail to express the heights
and depths of the human spirit.
For that, there is music, wherein

each note reveals both joys and
sorrows of generations. Music is
the history of the soul.
And "just as history moves
on," writes musician Juan Jorge
Laura, "so the creative energy
and innovation of each era
develop and find expression in
living music."
This Friday, Laura and his
five-member group, Rumillajta,


Cellist Janos Starker will perform with pianist Dennis Russell
Davles Tuesday and Wednesday In Dlnkelspiel Auditorium.
