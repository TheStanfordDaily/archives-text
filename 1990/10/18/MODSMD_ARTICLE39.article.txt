# 'Saturday, Sunday and Monday' hits with comedic characters
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Eduardo De Filippo's hit comedy, "Satur
day, Sunday and Monday," is being given a
rare staging this month by American Con
servatory Theater in San Francisco.
De Filippo is one of the most original
playwrights of the Italian theater and has
been touted by some critics as a "modern
Moliere."
Before he died in 1985, De Filippo said,
"When I am dead, my plays will be presented
more as dramas than as farces, and they will
make no one laugh."
He wasn't entirely off the mark, for the
subtle humor of his folksy play may not cap
ture a modern audience. While the charac
ters of "Saturday, Sunday and Monday" are
comedic, the theme is essentially dramatic.
Like all of De Filippo's plays, "Saturday,
Sunday and Monday" is set in Naples, where
an extended family, headed by Rosa and Pep
pino Priore (Sharon Lockwood and Will
Marchetti), go about their weekly ritual of
preparing a Sunday feast. The dinner is dis
rupted when their longtime friend Luigi
(Rick Hamilton) showers Rosa with yet
another expensive gift.
Assuming that there's something more
than friendship between them, Peppino
wildly accuses his wife — at the crowded
dinner table — of having an affair with Luigi.
Rosa has a fainting spell, but the rest of
the family reacts with amusement, and Pep
pino is embarrassed to face them the next
day.
De Fillipo's story follows the simple, daily
interaction of human beings as they work,

The playwright has been
touted by some as a 'mod
ern Moliere.'

argue, laugh and make love. His skill at char
acterization is extraordinary.
While minor characters and their situa
tions seem unrelated to the basic plot, they
all fit in well with the central theme of fam
ily ethics.
Peppino's son Rocco (Scott Freeman)
competes with his father's clothing business
by opening his own trendy store. The spir
ited Guilianella (Vilma Silva) wants to work
on television, and heatealy breaks her
engagement with her fiance when he criti
cizes her.
Peppino's sister Amelia (vividly portrayed
by Ruth Kobart) brings wisdom to the family
dinner table, along with her sickly, over
weight son Attilio (Hector Correa). William
Paterson, in a confident performance as
Grandfather Antonio, serves as a balanced
and humorous observer
While John B. Wilson's set design and
spectacular backdrop of the city add beauty
and scope to the production, the overlapping
world of these and other lively characters
creates a realistic picture of the values and
emotionally charged relationships of a con
temporary Neapolitan family.

"Saturday, Sunday and Monday" will be pre
sented at the Stage Door Theater, 420

25. Tickets are available by calling (415)
