# Okada offers cross-cultural learning
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Are you looking for a place where
you can eat rice for dinner every night,
experience numerous Asian-American
cultural events and feel part of a close
residential community?
Some people think Okada, the
Asian-American theme house, could
fit the bill for you.
Okada, located in Wilbur Hall, cele
brated its 10th anniversary last year.
Each spring it hosts Extravaganza, an
Asian-American cultural fair, which is
traditionally the house's largest event.
"The Okada Extravaganza gives
everyone in the Stanford community a
chance to learn about Asian-American
culture," according to resident assis
tant Steve Kim, a senior.
Theme associate Laura Chi, also a
senior, explained that the house
extends an invitation to the entire Bay
Area to come watch performances by
both Stanford and professional groups
at Extravaganza. Food booths and

craft demonstrations also fill White
Plaza as part of the event.
In-house activities
Within the house, activities tend to
be a mix of theme-related and non
theme activities. In addition to RAs
and academic advisers, which all
dorms with freshmen have, Okada's
staff includes six theme associates
who plan events specifically dealing
with Asian-American issues.
"We show films, invite speakers and

conduct workshops," Chi said.
In the past, programs have ranged
from talks on Asian-American history
to workshops on interracial relation
ships to discussions of current events,
according to Kim.
"Living in a theme house, you are
exposed to everything other houses
have, but you also have the opportu
nity for cross-cultural learning," he
said. "I look at it as icing on the cake."
Upcoming house programs include
a talk on Asian-American athletes, an
international food night and a staged
reading co-sponsored by the Asian
American Theater Project of a play
titled "F. 0.8.," a derogatory term for
recent immigrants meaning "Fresh
Off the Boat," according to theme
associate Nancy Wallace, a senior.
Helping residents feel comfortable
Aside from planning events, Okada
RAs and theme associates see their
role as helping residents feel as com-

fortable as possible.
"We have tried to create a home
atmosphere," Kim said. "Every
one, I believe, has responded and
we have a really unified house
right now."
The house is 60 percent Asian-
American, with a handful of Chi
cano/Latino and black students.
White students comprise the rest
of the dorm, according to RA
Tyler Cozzens, a junior.
The unusually high number of
Asian-Americans at Okada this
year — the figure is normally
about 40 percent — is due to a
large number of upperclassmen,
many of whom are returning resi
dents, Cozzens said.
Fifth-year senior Brett Sevilla,
who is half-Filipino and half
white, is in his second year at
Okada. Despite his "unusual
background," he said he feels
comfortable in the house.
"Initially I did not feel very
welcome in the Asian-American
community," said Sevilla, who
identifies himself as a Filipino-
American. "Because I look some
what white, there is some pres
sure to prove that you're Asian."
Living in Okada has turned out
to be "a better way for me to be
involved with the community," he
said. "I find it is more accepting in
terms of how I want to think of
myself.... I like being in an envi
ronment where mainstream
white culture is not dominant."
Cultural differences
Because freshmen in the house

come from different backgrounds,
the potential for friction exists.
But Okada staff and residents say
it has not been a problem, and
that initial apprehensions are
quickly cleared up.
"I lived here as a freshman,
and I was apprehensive at first,"
said Wallace, who is black. "But I
didn't feel like I was excluded
Everyone was really friendly."
Part of the function of the
theme house is to aid Asian-Amer
ican students in adjusting to Stan
ford life. "Some students come
from families which still have
very close ties to Asia, and grew
up in a much more traditional
background," Cozzens said. "So
we have to be more sensitive to
cultural differences."
Support mechanisms such as
the weekly Karen Huang Hour,
when an Asian-American thera
pist from Counseling and Psycho
logical Services comes to Okada to
talk with anyone who needs her,
are designed to help students
adjust to new surroundings.
Some white students find being
in the minority "disorienting" at
first, Cozzens said. "But there has
not been much friction.... Resi
dents have a really strong sense of
belonging."
The staff tries to foster this
sense of community by maintain
ing an atmosphere of openness. "I
try to treat them all as individuals
and be careful to avoid stereo
types," Cozzens said.
"We are not going to push any
political views on residents," Chi
said. "Politics is not our primary
focus ... but that is not to say
that we are not concerned about
issues facing the Asian-American

community."
A more political past
This is a significant change
from the house's early years,
according to Anthropology Prof.
Harumi Befu, the house's first
resident fellow.
"It was started to have a place
for ethnic [students] to not only
get together socially, but also for
political purposes. It was a forum
to air their views and to organize
politically," said Befu, who has
been an RF at EAST house and is
now a freshman adviser at Okada.
"It has gone through ups and
downs, but I think the level of
political awareness and involve
ment has declined," he continued.
"When it got started ... the polit
ical awareness was very high,
because the blacks and Chicanos
and Native Americans had paved
the way, so there was a strong ide
ology and strong feelings about
the ethnic movement."
Following the establishment of
two other ethnic theme dorms on
campus and pressure from the
Asian American Student Alliance
(now the Asian American Student
Association), an Asian-American
theme house was placed in
Junipero, a Wilbur dorm. The
theme house's first year was
1971-72, Befu said.
The dorm was renamed in 1980
after John Okada, author of the
book "No-no Boys," according to
current RF Jack Chin.
Last year, Okada celebrated the
10th anniversary of the name
change with a reunion featuring
former resident David Henry
Hwang, writer of the acclaimed
play "M. Butterfly."

"We decided to have a plaque
with names of former residents
who later contribute to the
greater Asian-American commu
nity, and he was the first name on
it," Kim said.
Weakened ties with AASA
AASA also celebrated its 20th
anniversary last year. Over the
years, Okada's ties to the organi
zation have weakened, but "we
are working on it," Chi said. "We
are trying to work out a good rap
port with them, because we are
both mEyor resources for Asian-
Americans on campus."
Junior Valerie Mih said that
like many AASA members, she
lives in the house because "it is a
good place to talk about issues
that would not be talked about in
other dorms."
"There are people here inter
ested in Asian-American culture
and issues, and other issues hav
ing to do with people of color," she
said.
While residents express enthu
siasm for living in Okada, they are
aware that the house may not
have a positive image on campus.
"I think it has the stigma of
being a dumpy dorm where all the
Asians go to study," Sevilla said.
"It's really an undeserved reputa
tion."
"I think at first some people
were apprehensive about living
here and were wondering, 'Would
it be too quiet?' But as the year
has gone on, I think people have
been reassured," Mih said.

after John Okada, author of the
book "No-no Boys," according to
current RF Jack Chin.
Last year, Okada celebrated the
10th anniversary of the name
change with a reunion featuring
former resident David Henry
Hwang, writer of the acclaimed
play "M. Butterfly."

"We decided to have a plaque
with names of former residents
who later contribute to the
greater Asian-American commu
nity, and he was the first name on
it," Kim said.

AASA also celebrated its 20th
anniversary last year. Over the
years, Okada's ties to the organi
zation have weakened, but "we
are working on it," Chi said. "We
are trying to work out a good rap

Junior Valerie Mih said that
like many AASA members, she
lives in the house because "it is a

that would not be talked about in
other dorms."
"There are people here inter
ested in Asian-American culture
and issues, and other issues hav
ing to do with people of color," she
said.
While residents express enthu

aware that the house may not
have a positive image on campus.
"I think it has the stigma of

Within the house, activities tend to
be a mix of theme-related and non
theme activities. In addition to RAs
and academic advisers, which all
dorms with freshmen have, Okada's
staff includes six theme associates
who plan events specifically dealing
with Asian-American issues.
"We show films, invite speakers and

conduct workshops," Chi said.
In the past, programs have ranged
from talks on Asian-American history
to workshops on interracial relation
ships to discussions of current events,
according to Kim.
"Living in a theme house, you are
exposed to everything other houses
have, but you also have the opportu
nity for cross-cultural learning," he
said. "I look at it as icing on the cake."
Upcoming house programs include
a talk on Asian-American athletes, an
international food night and a staged
reading co-sponsored by the Asian
American Theater Project of a play
titled "F. 0.8.," a derogatory term for
recent immigrants meaning "Fresh
Off the Boat," according to theme
associate Nancy Wallace, a senior.
Helping residents feel comfortable
Aside from planning events, Okada
RAs and theme associates see their
role as helping residents feel as com-

fortable as possible.
"We have tried to create a home
atmosphere," Kim said. "Every
one, I believe, has responded and
we have a really unified house
right now."
The house is 60 percent Asian-
American, with a handful of Chi
cano/Latino and black students.
White students comprise the rest
of the dorm, according to RA
Tyler Cozzens, a junior.
The unusually high number of
Asian-Americans at Okada this
year — the figure is normally
about 40 percent — is due to a
large number of upperclassmen,
many of whom are returning resi
dents, Cozzens said.
Fifth-year senior Brett Sevilla,
who is half-Filipino and half
white, is in his second year at
Okada. Despite his "unusual
background," he said he feels
comfortable in the house.
"Initially I did not feel very
welcome in the Asian-American
community," said Sevilla, who
identifies himself as a Filipino-
American. "Because I look some
what white, there is some pres
sure to prove that you're Asian."
Living in Okada has turned out
to be "a better way for me to be
involved with the community," he
said. "I find it is more accepting in
terms of how I want to think of
myself.... I like being in an envi
ronment where mainstream
white culture is not dominant."
Cultural differences
Because freshmen in the house

come from different backgrounds,
the potential for friction exists.
But Okada staff and residents say
it has not been a problem, and
that initial apprehensions are
quickly cleared up.
"I lived here as a freshman,
and I was apprehensive at first,"
said Wallace, who is black. "But I
didn't feel like I was excluded
Everyone was really friendly."
Part of the function of the
theme house is to aid Asian-Amer
ican students in adjusting to Stan
ford life. "Some students come
from families which still have
very close ties to Asia, and grew
up in a much more traditional
background," Cozzens said. "So
we have to be more sensitive to
cultural differences."
Support mechanisms such as
the weekly Karen Huang Hour,
when an Asian-American thera
pist from Counseling and Psycho
logical Services comes to Okada to
talk with anyone who needs her,
are designed to help students
adjust to new surroundings.
Some white students find being
in the minority "disorienting" at
first, Cozzens said. "But there has
not been much friction.... Resi
dents have a really strong sense of
belonging."
The staff tries to foster this
sense of community by maintain
ing an atmosphere of openness. "I
try to treat them all as individuals
and be careful to avoid stereo
types," Cozzens said.
"We are not going to push any
political views on residents," Chi
said. "Politics is not our primary
focus ... but that is not to say
that we are not concerned about
issues facing the Asian-American

community."
A more political past
This is a significant change
from the house's early years,
according to Anthropology Prof.
Harumi Befu, the house's first
resident fellow.
"It was started to have a place
for ethnic [students] to not only
get together socially, but also for
political purposes. It was a forum
to air their views and to organize
politically," said Befu, who has
been an RF at EAST house and is
now a freshman adviser at Okada.
"It has gone through ups and
downs, but I think the level of
political awareness and involve
ment has declined," he continued.
"When it got started ... the polit
ical awareness was very high,
because the blacks and Chicanos
and Native Americans had paved
the way, so there was a strong ide
ology and strong feelings about
the ethnic movement."
Following the establishment of
two other ethnic theme dorms on
campus and pressure from the
Asian American Student Alliance
(now the Asian American Student
Association), an Asian-American
theme house was placed in
Junipero, a Wilbur dorm. The
theme house's first year was
1971-72, Befu said.
The dorm was renamed in 1980
after John Okada, author of the
book "No-no Boys," according to
current RF Jack Chin.
Last year, Okada celebrated the
10th anniversary of the name
change with a reunion featuring

the weekly Karen Huang Hour,
when an Asian-American thera
pist from Counseling and Psycho
logical Services comes to Okada to
talk with anyone who needs her,
are designed to help students
adjust to new surroundings.
Some white students find being
in the minority "disorienting" at
first, Cozzens said. "But there has
not been much friction.... Resi
dents have a really strong sense of
belonging."
The staff tries to foster this
sense of community by maintain
ing an atmosphere of openness. "I
try to treat them all as individuals
and be careful to avoid stereo
types," Cozzens said.
"We are not going to push any
political views on residents," Chi
said. "Politics is not our primary
focus ... but that is not to say
that we are not concerned about
issues facing the Asian-American

community."
A more political past
This is a significant change
from the house's early years,
according to Anthropology Prof.
Harumi Befu, the house's first
resident fellow.
"It was started to have a place
for ethnic [students] to not only
get together socially, but also for
political purposes. It was a forum
to air their views and to organize
politically," said Befu, who has
been an RF at EAST house and is
now a freshman adviser at Okada.
"It has gone through ups and
downs, but I think the level of
political awareness and involve
ment has declined," he continued.
"When it got started ... the polit
ical awareness was very high,
because the blacks and Chicanos
and Native Americans had paved
the way, so there was a strong ide
ology and strong feelings about
the ethnic movement."
Following the establishment of
two other ethnic theme dorms on
campus and pressure from the
Asian American Student Alliance
(now the Asian American Student
Association), an Asian-American
theme house was placed in
Junipero, a Wilbur dorm. The
theme house's first year was
1971-72, Befu said.
The dorm was renamed in 1980
after John Okada, author of the
book "No-no Boys," according to
current RF Jack Chin.
Last year, Okada celebrated the
10th anniversary of the name
change with a reunion featuring
former resident David Henry
Hwang, writer of the acclaimed
play "M. Butterfly."

"We decided to have a plaque
with names of former residents
who later contribute to the
greater Asian-American commu
nity, and he was the first name on
it," Kim said.
Weakened ties with AASA
AASA also celebrated its 20th
anniversary last year. Over the
years, Okada's ties to the organi
zation have weakened, but "we
are working on it," Chi said. "We
are trying to work out a good rap
port with them, because we are
both mEyor resources for Asian-
Americans on campus."
Junior Valerie Mih said that
like many AASA members, she
lives in the house because "it is a
good place to talk about issues
that would not be talked about in
other dorms."
"There are people here inter
ested in Asian-American culture
and issues, and other issues hav
ing to do with people of color," she
said.
While residents express enthu
siasm for living in Okada, they are
aware that the house may not
have a positive image on campus.
"I think it has the stigma of
being a dumpy dorm where all the
Asians go to study," Sevilla said.
"It's really an undeserved reputa
tion."
"I think at first some people
were apprehensive about living
here and were wondering, 'Would
it be too quiet?' But as the year
has gone on, I think people have
been reassured," Mih said.
