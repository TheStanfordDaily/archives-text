Are you looking for a place where
you can eat rice for dinner every night,
experience numerous Asian-American
cultural events and feel part of a close
residential community?
Some people think Okada, the
Asian-American theme house, could
fit the bill for you.
Okada, located in Wilbur Hall, cele
brated its 10th anniversary last year.
Each spring it hosts Extravaganza, an
Asian-American cultural fair, which is
traditionally the house's largest event.

Upcoming house programs include

reading co-sponsored by the Asian
