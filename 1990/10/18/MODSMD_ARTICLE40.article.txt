# HIP HOT & HAPPENING
## 
### 
Hangin' out with J.T.
The concert of the year (and every year, for that matter)
will be happening Saturday at Shoreline Amphitheater and
Sunday at Concord Pavilion, when everybody's favorite
mood singer takes the stage to share his songs about love
and passion with thousands. This Is an event appropriate for
dates, even for Stanford students. With Jimmy Buffett making
a resurgence as of late, even though "Margarltavllle" was his
only real hit, Taylor should have no problem filling the great
outdoors. Tickets are available for the 8 p.m. concert at all
BASS ticket outlets, or by calling 762-BASS.
