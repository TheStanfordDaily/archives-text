## Rent the movies: Buck, Bueller bust in TV translation 
### 
Is there a creative mind left in network TV?
Sure, there's David Lynch, but he's too busy
making "Twin Peaks" hopelessly confusing to
save the rest of prime-time.
Instead, the programming gurus of CBS and
NBC have resorted to the time-honored practice
of dismantling entertaining movies into lame
sit-coms. The latest casualties: "Uncle Buck"
and "Ferris Bueller."
To call them bastardizations of the original
John Hughes' classics may not capture how
much these shows lose in their translation to the
tube.
The networks have failed to recognize that
there was nothing particularly funny about the
situations in the film versions of "Buck" and
"Bueller."
It was not their premises, but Hughes' ability
as writer/director to impart his comedies with
rich dialogue and terrifically complex characters
that made the movies so fabulous.
While not even in the same league as its
inspiration, "Uncle Buck" (Monday at 8:00 PM,
CBS) actually enjoys a few amusing moments.
Kevin Meaney's handling of the title role is ade
quate because he avoids the large temptation to
simply mimic John Candy's grand performance.
In fact, Meaney claims that he has never seen
the movie which has given him his first major
TV break. If he had, he'd realize that he's about
150 pounds lighter than the gargantuan Candy.
Despite Meaney's more svelte physique, the
writers of "Buck" nave opted for the "Married..
.with Children" school of comedy. Fat jokes,
sexual folly and innuendo dominate the half
hour and provide for some sophomoric laughs.
"Bueller" (Monday at 8:30 PM, NBC) is abso
lutely miserable. Charlie Schlatter's Ferris is lit
tle more than a annoying impersonation of
Matthew Broderick — the producers would have
done better to get Rich Little as star.
The main characters of Cameron, Sloane,
Grace and the ever-bumbling Ed Rooney are
simply cheap parodies of their film counterparts.
It's as if the "Bueller" cast had rented the movie,
then set out on devising a pathetic rip-off of the
flick.
Your Monday TV time is better spent with
Al, Dan and the male Giff on "Monday Night
Football." At least they're original.
