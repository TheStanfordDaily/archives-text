# Stanford's quake days not as cool as snow days
## 
### 
AH, October 18! This date last year
we were sleeping late, enjoying Califor
nia's typically quirky response to the
good ola-fashioned "snow day": Instead
of seven inches on the ground, we had
seven points on the Richter scale.
Though the net result ("NO
SCHOOL!") may have been the same,
something was lost in the translation.
Maybe it was the nagging feeling that at
$40/ class period, we were the ones los
ing out this time. Or maybe it's just a
lot more fun throwing snowballs at
each other than pieces of the Quad.
Freshmen may not understand what
a profound impact the earthquake had.
For months after it hit, one's entire
social life — or lack thereof — revolved
around the single, inescapable ques
tion: "So, where were YOU?"
My Dear Friend Chester, who had
saved some woman from certain death
by knocking her away from a falling
AJmanac of British Gentry in Green
Library, suddenly found himself atop a
tidal wave of popularity. One great
earthquake story changed his life:
Strange girls started asking him out; fra
ternities scrambled to offer him bids in
a reverse rush; loving fans, recalling toy
stores of long ago, dubbed him "the next
Peter Brady."
Yes, Chester milked his saga for all it
was worth, even making it onto that
hallowed tome of true social status:

The Sigma Chi Guest List.
And myself?
Well, poor old Chris here, who had
only been "playing tennis" during the
earthquake, stayed at home on week
ends, friendless, waiting in vain for the
phone to ring. I wasn't even allowed
into "Loro Rocks," let alone the frater
nity parties. Lonely, outcast and
rejected I was, all because nobody
wanted to hear how I Won the Point
Anyway.
But as I hid, shunned and trembling,
in the dark corners of one party, gazing
at the beautiful people as they traded
perfect earthquake stories, eagerly
scraping droplets of beer from the floor
whenever nearby freshmen collided, I
heard Chester rehash his epic. And I
noticed how the almanac had become
that much heavier, his leap that much
greater, and — by some weird twist of
mnemonic mitosis — the single
woman he saved had multiplied into a
cluster of senior citizens.
Right then, I knew that I had found
my ticket out of the social sewer. I could
lie through my teeth.
So welcome the "new Chris Harris":
cool, confident — and creative.
"So, where were YOU?"
"Oh, nowhere special, I guess....
But when I saw those poor, innocent,
God-fearing, flag-waving American
children who never disobeyed their par

ents and always said "Please " and
"Thank you" stricken with fear under
neath the falling power lines, I knew I
had to act fast. I hit an extremely high
10b...."
"Chris?"
"Well, I Won the Point Anyway."
"Really, where were you?"
"(Sniff) Playing handball against
Columbae."
"C'mon."
"OK, I was high-jumping. I was in
the air when it happened and missed
the whole thing."
For some crazy reason, I'm still not
on that guest list.
Inevitably, earthquakes are like alco
hol: In small doses, they're a great way
to loosen things up and break the ice,
but too much at once and you're bound
to get smashed.
And speaking of transitional state
ments, how 'bout that USC game? As
the student body roared into Stanford

Stadium on Saturday, three burning
questions filled the mind of each indi
vidual:
Burning question No. 1: With a
shocking victory over Notre Dame
("Does that make us No. 1 now?"), had
Stanford finally kicked its habit of con
sistently playing just below the level of
its opponent?
Answer: YES. This past week, Stan
ford proved that it could in fact play far
below the level of its opponent as well.
After a tremendous first quarter,
what went wrong? What crushing
fiasco, what catastrophic event could
have stopped the football team cold,
shaken them so hard as to utterly
destroy their game? One player's touch
ing confession best captures the team's
emotion: "Gosh, it still hurts to talk
about it, but after poor Scott Lange
missed his shot at a free tuition, well..
.. We on the sidelines were all so bro
ken up, we just couldn't carry on."
In that case, good luck to the next
"Time Out for Hiition" contestant.
We're all rooting for you, but don't bet
on success: that moon has hardly been
looking very blue these days. ...
Burning question No. 2: Would this
be the week that Branner students real
ized we're all rooting for the same team,
and stopped cheering for themselves?
