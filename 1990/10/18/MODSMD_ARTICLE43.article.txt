# Kings Arms re-creates Brit restaurant
## 
### Sunil Perkash Staff writer 
If you have ever been to England, you
have probably experienced the great tradi
tion of the British pub. Now, with the
recent opening of the Kings Arms Restau
rant, you can get a little touch of British
culture right here in Menlo Park.
Constructed as an extension to the
British Bankers Club, the Kings Arms
dining room meticulously recreates its
English prototype.
With its dimmed lighting and authen
tic English decor, the overall atmosphere
is quite different than most places in Palo
Alto.
The menu at the Kings Arms is fairly
limited, consisting primarily of grilled
meats and seafood, including fresh
salmon and fresh swordfish. There are
also three pasta dishes on the menu,
including a vegetarian tortellini primav
era and a seafood linguine.

Of course, there is a good selection of
draught beers on tap, a necessity for an
English style pub, including Bass Ale,
Newcastle Brown Ale, Guinness, Young's
Bitter and Harp Lager. All are served by
the pint (20 oz.) as they would be in Eng
land at $3.50 per glass.
We began our dinner with the French
onion soup topped with melted cheese
($4.50) and a dinner salad ($2.75), the
latter being nothing more than a wedge of
lettuce accompanied by a couple of sliced
tomatoes and cucumbers neatly arranged
on a plate. Both the soup and salad were
tasty, yet simple, and thus served as a
nice prelude to the rest of our meal.
Next, we had the veal chop ($13.95),
grilled and served in a Jack Daniels
Whiskey sauce with mushrooms, and the
Duke's chicken ($11.25), "served to the
Duke of York on his visit to Musgrove
Manor in 1924" (as if anyone knows who
this person was or where in the world
"Musgrove Manor" is located), which

was a breast of chicken baked in puff pas
try with prosciutto, Swiss cheese and
spinach.
Both main courses were served with a
generous portion of fresh vegetables and
a choice of rice or potatoes. Both were
cooked to perfection, and due to the huge
portions, they were difficult to finish.
For dessert, we had the Profiteroles
($4.50), cream-filled pastries smothered
in a chocolate sauce. They were not too
rich and served as a nice way to end the
meal.
While the Kings Arms overall does not
present the most innovative culinary
breakthroughs, it does provide a nice
English atmosphere with simple but
hearty food to match.
Because of the large portions, an
entree (ranging from $9.95 to $14.95)
could easily be sufficient food to order,
making this restaurant not too pricey for
a nice dinner out in a British setting.
