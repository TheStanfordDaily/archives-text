# There's no Question: Comic has identity
## 
### David Amann Staff writer 
The release of the first issue
of The Question Quarterly
reminded me of a long, hot
summer in Tfexas when my
mind first turned to the Ques
tion.
The star of one of the first
attempts to aim a mainstream
comic at an adult audience, Vic
Sage searched for his true iden
tity in a world of violence and he
most often found it behind a
no-faced mask.
As the Question, he'd beat
up the bad guys one moment
and wax philosophical the next
in a book full of literary allu
sions.
When Sage collided with
Lady Shiva and the Reverend
Jeremiah Hatch, his search took
an abrupt turn from near death
to the Zen-like martial arts
training of Richard Dragon.
Afterwards, the Question
searched for his true identity
down a more spiritual path.
However, the Question's
return to the chaotic, crime-rid
den world of Hub City soon
erodes his new found peace and
forces him to escape the lawless
urban sprawl.
I was as hopeful to see the
new series begin as I was sad to
see the old series end. Entitled
"Any Man's Death," The Ques

tion Quarterly begins one year
after Sage's retreat from Hub
City into the Amazon rainfor
est.
Relying on the literary style
of Dennis O'Neil, the abstract
artistic eye of Denys Cowan,
and the familiar reliance on a
classic source (in this issue,
John Donne) ,' The Question
Quarterly merely transplants
the familiar Vic Sage from the
urban jungle of Hub City to the
more natural jungles in South
America.
When yet another crazed,
South American drug dealer
named Tirseus (after the The
ban prophet in "Oedipus Rex")
destroys the Indian village that
befriends Sage and kidnaps the
young girl he's sworn to protect,
Sage reverts to his violent and
fundamental nature.
As he enters the city Silva de
Plata, Sage finally completes his
return to his identity of the
Question by donning the famil
iar trench coat and faceless
mask. Upon making an entry
to Janice's unguarded strong
hold, the Question twists upon
an interesting (if somewhat pre
dictable) conclusion.
The setting is different, but
the story's the same. Those
who liked The Question will
neither be inspired nor disap
pointed by The Question Quar
terly.
