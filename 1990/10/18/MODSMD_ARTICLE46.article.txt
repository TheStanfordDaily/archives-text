# Festival 2000 defines City's cultural map
## Poetry festival makes great read

Who would have expected to hear Lawrence Fer
linghetti, a surviving voice of the counter-cultural
Beat generation, reading his poetry in one of San Fran
cisco's established cultural institutions?
One might not have expected to see it, but last Fri
day at the M.H. De Young Museum, the institution
and the evening belonged to Ferlinghetti.
The occasion was the opening night of the fourth
annual National Poetry Week Festival — a
combination awards ceremony and poetry reading
entitled "The Nature of Nature: The Poet and Plane
tary Crisis."
For those who love the informality and loose struc
ture of most poetry readings, rest assured that the
evening was not too constrained by convention —
beginning 25 minutes late and opening with Kush
(the association's archivist) in his grey sweatshirt and
red baseball cap singing Welch chants before taking
his place behind a video recorder for the rest of the
evening.
After the opening, festival organizer Jack Mueller
gave awards for Lifetime Service to Poetiy, Poets and
Society to both Ferlinghetti and Gwendolyn Brooks.
Mueller praised their work for consistently fighting
against both "social injustice and racial injustice."
Ferlinghetti, the accomplished poet, painter, pub
lisher and co-founder of City Lights Bookstore, looked
somewhat embarrassed as he waited during a very
long round of applause to speak and then saia simply,
"I wish I could send this to my mother-in-law in
heaven so she can see I'm not a bum after all."
Poet and critic Gloria Hull accepted Brooks award
on her behalf — praising the Pulitzer Prize winning
poet for her personal warmth as well as her talent.
Hull also recited some of Hull's poetry including
"We Real Cool" — a line possibly more well-known
than the poet herself thanks to its presence all over
the country in subways and on park benches.
Surrealist poet Philip Lamantia read some of his
poetry, including a poem written the night of the
Loma Prieta earthquake. Much of Lamantia's poetry
was too dense to absorb through his reading, but a
line from "Unachieved" did clarify what it is to be a
surrealist poet. He said, "I refuse to come to my
senses since I'm in them."
Ferlinghetti's spare poems and gifted reading were
true and clear. At first he was the experienced story
teller, entertaining while making the audience laugh
at ourselves and society. Laughter was interspersed
with comments such as one from the row behind,
"This is great stuff!"
As Ferlinghetti read successive poems, he became
more expressive and personal — both in terms of
delivery and in the poems he chose. In the "Poet as
Fisherman," he spoke of the poet coming "face to face
with reality," and in"The Uses of Poetry," he says,"I
am a news reporter from another planet."
He showed his congeniality the more strongly
when he pulled out a reporter's notebook and read
poetry he had written just a week before during a trip
to Europe.
Although these poems often referred to "the old
man," the work made clear Ferlinghetti is not a relic
from the past but is an enduring talent.

Other contemporary talent can be heard this week as
the National Poetry Week Festival continues. The
World Series Poetry Grand Slam Finals take place
tonight at Fort Mason with champions from New
York, Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area being
judged in an Olympic-style competition. Friday
night's events focus on ecological action, and the
International Weekend brings major poets from
around the world to the Bay Area. Call 776-6602 for
information or BASS for tickets.
