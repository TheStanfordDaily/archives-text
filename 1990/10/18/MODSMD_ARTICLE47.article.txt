# Urban Bush Women mold culture, contemporary dance

Defining art appears to be the focus of the
art world tnese days. In a society that tends
to view opera ana ballet as art and ethnic
music ana dance as free entertainment to be
enjoyed at a street faii; proponents of multi
culturalism are attempting to broaden the
definition of high art.
Like the L.A. Festival last month, San
Francisco's Festival 2000, now in its second
of three weeks, is an attempt to "celebrate
the rich diversity of cultures" in the local
community.
Festival 2000 has an additional goal â€”
that of "showcasing works on the cutting
edge." The Urban Bush Women's West
Coast premiere of the dance/drama "Praise
House" is an excellent example of the blend
ing of cultural heritage and contemporary
idioms.
The collaboration between Jawole Willa
Jo Zollar (artistic director and choreographer
of the Urban Bush Women), Carl Riley
(composer), Angelyn Debord (script writer)

and Leni Schweninger (visual designer) tells
the story of the spiritual relationship
between Hannah (Viola Sheely) and her
grandmother (April Greene) and their down
to-earth relationship with their mother/
daughter (Theresa Cousar).
Despite the deaths of the two older
women, the mood of "Praise House" is
uplifting.
The moving vocal performances by the
gospel choir Street Sounds and of Brother
Meshack (Ayodele Martin Aubert), as well as
the mesmerizing dances of the angels, are
something of a cross between a revival and a
Broadway show. The reaction of the Oct. 14
sold-out house is best expressed by one audi
ence member who announced during inter
mission, "You can't help but sing!"
The only flaw in the production is the
confusion resulting from the inability to
understand some of the heavily accented
solos or from multiple performers singing
different words at once.
At these times, one could wish for more of
the twirling, weighty dance which expressed
Hannah's dreams and turmoils so well.
