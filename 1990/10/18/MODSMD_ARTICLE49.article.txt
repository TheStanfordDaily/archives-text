# MORE TO MUSIC Dan Levitin
## Finding and producing the art 
### 
Orjin Keepnews is one of the most pro
lific producers in history. Although he has
never actually counted, he has produced
more than 500 records in his 35-year
career. That works out to more than one
record every four weeks.
He was the first to record legendary
artists Bill Evans and Wes Montgomery,
and he has figured prominently in the
careers of Cannonball Adderly, Thelo
nious Monk, McCoy Tyner, Sonny
Rollins, Bobby Hutcherson and Flora
Purim. He is currently president of Land
mark Records.
He recently spoke to The Daily about
discovering new talent and the art of pro
ducing.
Dan Levitin: You have been a big dis
coverer of talent. What do you listen for
when you hear a new artist?
Orrin Keepnews: When I first heard
Wes Montgomery, I flew out to Indi
anapolis, sat down at the bar where Wes
was playing, and I would say it took me
between 14 and 20 seconds to realize that
I was in the presence of something god
damned important.
The first time I heard Thelonious
Monk, I heard a test pressing of his first
session for Blue Note, and I knew I was in
the presence of something special.
DL: How?
OK: It is someone with an individual
voice, somebody who sounds like them
self on that instrument.
I would also say that it's someone
whose obvious passion for what he's
doing makes itself known to you, I mean,
you just hear the music and you are hear
ing passion, you are hearing creativity,
you are hearing the cry of an artist.
And it's not one of those things where
you're sitting there thinking, "Gee, I'm
now hearing the cry of an artist."
It seems like it's all happening instinc
tively and swiftly like a flash of lightning,
but what's actually happening is that your
taste, your experience, your judgment are

all constantly operating within you and
the something comes along whicn strikes
you as being an embodiment of all these
things together.
DL: What is the most important job of
the producer during a recording session?
OK: The problem about jazz, and
music in general, as it functions in a cap
italist system is that it has to be an art
and a business at the same time, and
that's one of the most anti-creative things
imaginable.
I Delieve it is the function of the pro
ducer to gain control of the environment,
so I spent as much of my time and inge
nuity as I could working against all those
ticking clock situations by booking large
blocks of time in advance.
Then all I have to worry about is get
ting product, good, creative, finished
music, which of course is what it's all
about anyway.
The single most important ingredient
in creating jazz records is to remove all of
the unnecessary tensions, while being
careful not to remove any of the necessary
tensions, and there is a distinction.
DL: How do you relate to the technol
ogy of recording? How involved do you get
with sounds, for instance?
OK: I think there are instances in
which I will believe in the validity of over
dubbing and layering, but I also believe
that it can be drastically overused to
undercut the spontaneity that's a very
important part of jazz.
A lot of that comes out now that so
many people are recording live to two
track again with digital. And yet multi
track digital, which is now finally free of
glitches, remains incredibly expensive
from the perspective of a typical jazz bud
get.
