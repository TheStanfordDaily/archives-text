Every once in a while, you just
can't help falling in love. That's what
happened when I first listened to the
debut album of 26-year-old Kristen
Vigard.
It's also what happened when I lis
tened again and again, and again.
The name may not be familiar, but
the voice should be. The daughter of
actress Mallory Millet Danaher, Vigard
starred as the original "Annie," preceded
by roles in "Hair" and"I Remember
Mama." Her acting credits include "The
Guiding Light," "One Life to Live" and
two feature films.

This Is music of emotion
and expression, not pre
tentious politics.

Despite the experienced background,
though, life hasn't been all that cushy for
Vigard. The singer/songwriter spent a
period of time singing solo in Paris sub
way stations to make money before she
became part of the underground Los
Angeles music scene.
It's about time to welcome Vigard
back to the surface. Her debut effort, an
enchanting collection of contemplative
folk and funk, is one of the brightest
beginnings I've heard in awhile.
By taking her experiences with chums
Fishbone and the Red Hot Chili Peppers,
and mixing them with elements of rock,
blues, jazz, folk and New Age, Vigard has
compiled an eclectic but thoroughly
accessible sound that defies description
based on other forms.
Traversing from the bluesy "12 Bar
Blues" to the soulful "Stone City," Vigard
handles herself with a cool air of confi
dence — making the distinct musical
forms blend into one smooth sound
behind the glue of Vigard's voice.
While the music is amazingly strong
for a debut, Vigard's voice is the light that
makes the album shine. Enchanting like
Til Hiesday's Aimee Mann, soothing
like Bonnie Raitt and biting like 10,000
Maniacs' Natalie Merchant, Vigard
mixes the best of all vocal worlds to cre
ate a relaxing mood that simultaneously
keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Then, there are the lvrics. With
insights into all aspects of life, Vigard
shows that she is either mature beyond
her years or has keen observation pow
ers. Especially powerful is "Stone City," a

critique of guess-which-town in South
ern California: "Stone City/ Don't let it
eat you alive/ Such a pity you only try to
survive/ You could be living the life that
you dreamed as a boy/ But you stalk
around the town with a gun/ What a toy."
Even Vigard's love songs have original
expressions, as in "Paint My Head":
"How did you know that I was looking
for some trouble tonight?/ A prescription
for distraction, and you filled it just right/

... Love's for real, but it didn't show/
'Cause I was cleverly disguised as some
one who wasn't wise to you."
This is music of emotion and expres
sion, not pretentious politics for a pur
pose.
Being a debut album on a small label
(Private Music), Kristen Vigard may run
into trouble getting heard. She won't
have trouble getting people to listen.

Twenty-six year old Krlsten Vigard may look young, but her debut album
shows she has as much experience merging different torms of music as Paul
Simon.
