Do It A Cappellci
Spike & Co. (various artists)
Grade: B+
Spike Lee can't sing.
Or perhaps he can. However, you won't find the
answer to this question on his new album, "Do It
A Capella," performed by "Spike & Co."
Although Lee makes no musical contributions
to the album, his name surprisingly appears
prominently on the disc and jacket.
Behind the egoism lies an excellent disc,
though, filled with 13 a capella numbers from
some of the industry's finest vocal groups, includ
ing Ladvsmith Black Mambazo, Take 6, the Persua
sions, tne Mint Juleps, Rockapella and Thie Image.

To his credit, Lee was the individual who
brought these six groups together for the PBS tele
vision special that produced these tracks.
But the soundtrack album shines for the amaz
ing talents of the a cappeila groups, not the exploits
of the television producer
Ladysmith Black Mambazo's three tracks typify
the group's trademark style, marked by slow,
rhythmic backgrounds and rich harmonies.
"Phansi Em Godini (Down In the Mines)" fades
and crescendoes with each voice in synchronicity.
On "The Lion Sleeps Tbnight," which also com
bines the voices of the Mint Juleps, the back
grounds of Ladysmith sound far better than the

lead vocals.
The track's pace is markedly
slower than the original song and
the version currently performed by
Stanford's Talisman.
Rockapella, a male quartet,
jumps into its tracks with inten
sity and energy. "Zombie Jam
boree" has lyrics similar to the cult
song "Monster Mash," but the
quick beat, excellent bass and
strong lead vocals make the track
both uplifting and fun.
The gospel group Hike 6 only
contributes one track, "Get Away
Jordan," but their voices have such
presence that the lyrical emotion
is successfully conveyed.
Some of the other groups pale in
comparison with some of the more
experienced groups. The Mint
Juleps fail to hold the momentum
of "Higher and Higher;" and the
three numbers by the Persuasions
often strike an unharmonious
chord.
However, as a whole, "Do It A
Capella" is a strong soundtrack
recording, primarily due to the tal
ent of the contributing groups. It's
too bad that Spike Lee uses the
album to blow his own horn; like a
cappella music, the vocals of the
groups should stand alone.
