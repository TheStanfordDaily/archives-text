Are You Okay?
Was (Not Was)
Grade: A-
The fourth record from the Was
Brothers is the long-awaited fol
low-up to 1988's "What's Up,
Dog."
"Are You Okay?" features guest
vocalists Leonard Cohen, Syd
Straw (sounding remarkably Eaie
Brickell-ish), The Roches, MTV's
Downtown Julie Brown and more.
The music is tighter than ever.
For those of you whp don't read
album notes in your spare time,
Don Was has spent the last year
producing the new Dylan and
Elton John albums, as well as Bon
nie Raitt's "Nick of Time" and
some tracks off the B-52's "Cosmic
Thing" album.

Don Was told me recently,
"good production is really about
getting good vocals on good songs."
This is the strength of Was (Not
Was.)
Vocalists Sweet Pea Atkinson
and Sir Harry Bowens deliver con
sistently powerful and convincing
vocals to songs which border on
the silly and absurd, lyrically, yet
are serious, thumping grooves,
musically. Take the title cut, for
example:
You stared at me 'til your eye
balls smoked/ Was it anger? Or
love? Or the caffeine in your coke?/
I searched my soul for words to
soothe you/ But nothin' that I did
ever seemed to move you ...
The fact that Was (Not Was) can
make this work so well is their
strength. The rhythm section is

The music is tighter
than ever.

tighter than anybody's, and every
thing is delivered with just enough
tongue in cheek that you wonder if
they know they're just on the verge
of seeming too clever for anyone's
own good.
But it's hard to find fault with a
guy who names his publishing
company "1-800-Don Was, Inc."
For real Was (Not Was) fans,
Geffen has just re-released their
second album as a budget CD,
"Born to Laugh at Tbrnadoes."
This is also a masterpiece, highly
recommended, with a hilarious
cameo vocal by Mel 7brm6.
