# Travis and friends: country classics

Heroes and Friends
Randy Travis
Grade: A-
The current release from country's new traditional
ist finds him teaming up with some of Nashville's
biggest names, from Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard
to Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette.
Though the idea of an all-duet album may seem
gimmicky, Travis pulls it off because of his sincerity
and entnusiasm for the material. "Heroes and
Friends" is upbeat, without succumbing to the ten
dency for happy country albums to be syrupy.
It is an instant classic, sure to be found in honky
tonks and bars throughout the country, and sure to
stay in their juke boxes for many years to come.
It is testimony to Travis' now-established ability
that he can work with such musical legends as those
assembled here without ever seeming awkward or out
of his element.
This is very much a Randy Travis album, and the
fact that he retains his musical personality while

allowing it to be complemented by these strong duet
partners is the best evidence of his vocal talent. Randy
is here to stay.
Dolly joins him on her original composition, "Do I
Ever Cross Your Mind," which she recorded 15 years
ago for a Chet Atkins album (Chet and Friends, RCA).
Chet repeats his role here on gut-string acoustic gui
tar, adding occasional vocal harmonies.
For Merle Haggard fans, there is a lot to enjoy.
Merle sings half of the old classic "All Night Long,"
(penned by legends Johnny Gimble and Bob Wills) and
two Merle Haggard compositions are included,
"Shopping for Dresses" and "We're Strangers Again,"
sung with Randy by Loretta Lynn and Tammy
Wynette, respectively.
The one anomaly is the inclusion of Clint
Eastwood as a duet partner on "Smokin' the Hive."
The news: Clint can't really sing. But the song
somehow works, as Clint half-speaks and half-warbles
through it with enough good-natured humility to
make his effort affable and successful.
