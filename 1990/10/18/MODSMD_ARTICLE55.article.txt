The Icicle Thief
Caterlna Sylos Lablnl, Heidi
Komarek
Grade: B
The black and white film rolls,
and the hero, riding along the river
bank, sees a drowning woman.
But wait! She's in color, that is,
until he rubs her dry with his black
and white coat. How did they do
that?
No, not by magic, but a clever
mixture of black and white and
color films that makes "The Icicle
Thief" an amusing satire of the
modern mass media in all of its
many angles.
Tnis Italian film that has been
acclaimed at the San Francisco
Film Festival begins by rushing us
through the ridiculously hectic
pace of the TV studio and the
antics of the hopelessly confused
director, Nicholetti.
When his film "The Icicle
Thief" begins to air on TY how
ever, it is the slow, sad, sentimental
tale of a postwar Italian family:
unemployed father, mother aspir
ing to be a stage girl, two adorable
and neglected children.
On the other side of the screen
we meet another typical, though
more modern, family, with tne
babbling wife, husband who hides
behind his newspaper and two
equally adorable and neglected
children, none of whom seems to
notice when the movie begins to
trade characters with the sensa
tionalized commercials that keep
interrupting the plot.
And it is the interaction, or
should I say collision, of all these
elements tnat drives Nicholetti's
film to complete absurdity but cap-

Doesn't anybody
care what happens
on television?

tures the true point of the movie:
Doesn't anybody care what hap
pens on television?
The visual aspect of the film is
its most striking feature. The con
trasting types of film highlight the
wide though equally ridiculous
extremes oT content in that they
portray.
The black and white drips of
sappiness in the domestic struggles
of a poor family in a more innocent
era, while the the intense color
magnifies the superficiality, and
even callousness, of modern life
with the commercials of scantily
clad women and even its the real
world of couch potato families.
The smooth incorporation of so
many sides of the TV problem
makes the movie amusing and
thought provoking. Yet for all its
fancy filmmaking, it does have sev
eral problems of its own: The sto
ryline drags at the beginning when
tne silly movie within the movie is
developing.
And because all the characters
in the entire movie are stereotypes,
it is easy to get bored with tnem,
and hence with the film as a whole.
But maybe this tendency to
make you realize the the potential
brain-numbing power of the mass
media is the real strength of the
movie. You'll certainly never
watch your TV set the same way
again.
