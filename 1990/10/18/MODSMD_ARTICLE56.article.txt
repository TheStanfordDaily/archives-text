Grade: B+
In World War 11, men from
around the United States were
called upon to risk life and limb
for the sake of their country and
their world.
While many Hollywood
offerings about the war depict
those men as cool and calm
machines, middle-aged John
Waynes bravely swooping down
on Nazi fighter planes, a new
film attempts to proffer a
slightly more realistic portrayal.
"Memphis Belle" is a film
about boys who become men
3,000 miles from home while
fighting an enemy that is both
fatal and faceless. It is the story
about the 10-man crew of the
Memphis Belle, a B-17 bomber
of the U.S. Army Air Corps,
which was the first to complete
25 successful missions, making
them heroes for an entire
nation.
"Memphis Belle," produced
by former Columbia Pictures
cnief David Puttnam ("Chariots
of Fire" and"The Killing
Fields"), is divided into two
parts: The first third of the film
devotes itself to introducing the
10 characters as they prepare for
their final mission, and the last
two-thirds depict the bomb run
itself.
The first part of the movie
almost makes "Memphis Belle"
crash and burn before it can
even get off the ground.
The filmmakers desire to
stress human realism by
demonstrating the diverse
nature and relative physical and
emotional youthfulness of the
bulk of the troops.
Unfortunately, the resulting
cliches and almost inhibiting
sappy dialogue create awkward
scenes and characters almost as
two-dimensional as those in
1940 war films.
This is too bad, considering
the fine cast of young stars

employed, including Matthew
Modine, Eric Stoltz, and Harry
Connick Jr. (yes, the singer).
In the last two-thirds of the
film, "Memphis Belle" gets off
the ground and soars to new
heights in cinematic battle
scenes, making any other faults
in script or execution com
pletely forgivable.
The audience is taken on a
hair-raising, nail-biting, awe
inspiring flight over Nazi Ger
many, evoking the first real
emotion of the film: fear.
Director Michael Caton-
Jones offers the most realisti
cally stunning portrayal of
aerial battle ever presented on
the screen as the Memphis Belle
gets beaten up by flack bursts
and shot at by fighter planes.
Using actual bombers and fight
ers and employing wonderful
special effects, the result is the
lifeblood of "Memphis Belle."
Besides the aerial cinematog
raphy, there are some genuinely
nice moments. In particular, the
previously stilted interaction of
the men on the ground is
replaced by emotional depth
and irony in the scenes between
the crew while in the air
In addition is a scene where
the stereotypically stoic and by
the-books officer is shown to be
a highly compassionate surro
gate for the worries of his men's
parents.
And in an unexpectedly nice
touch, one scene inserts actual
German aerial footage from the
war as a backdrop to the reading
of letters by parents whose sons
were killed in battle.
