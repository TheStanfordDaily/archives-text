# Definitely dumb: 'Peace' deserves a D for Dolph
## 
### 
I Come In Peace
Dolph Lundgren, Brian Benben
Grade: D
"I Come in Peace" has it all — drug lords,
mismatched cop partners, aliens, Dolph Lund
gren, silicon breasts and more aliens; on the
other hand, it lacks a few essentials of a good
movie — a coherent plot, adequate acting and
an interesting storyline.
Basically this movie is such a mishmash of
plots that it resembles a head-on-collision of
"Red Heat" and "Masters of the Universe."
Dolph, co-star of "Rocky IV" and star of such
inspiring works as "Masters" and "Red Scor
pion," plays a New York cop. Dolph's partner is
quickly killed off, and surprise, he gets an
annoying, nerdy, by-the-book partner.
These two then go off to solve the murder,

getting tangled up with the evil government
Bureaucracy and the evil alien.
Basically, to call this movie clich6d is to label
it with much too much originality. The plot
strings along in a totally predictable manner,
except of course for the utterly preposterous
plot twists which strike the viewer with the
utter stupidity of this flick's makers.
A prominent example of how dumb this
movie is the very basis of the plot. Dolph is
waiting outside while his soon-to-be-deceased
partner acts as an impostor in a drug deal.
Dolph sees a holdup going down in a liquor
store across the street, so he bails on backing up
his partner. The drug dealers then kill Dolph's
partner, but before they get away the alien
comes in for their heroin.
It's not a very practical way to get the ball
rolling.

The hardest thing to figure out is which of
the many huge actors is Dolph. At first I
thought he was the drug-dealing alien, a seven
foot tall behemoth with long blond hair and
opaque contacts. Then, the good-guy police
alien appears, possessing the same physical
characteristics as the first, except he has dark
hair and a receding hairline.
Dolph, however, has a nice yuppie hairdo
and lacks the liquid paper eyes. His voice inflec
tion and timbre, however possess the same
monotone as the aliens'.
Maybe the fact that they so closely resem
bled each other was some sort of deep message
about the problems facing all societies across
the globe and how we should unite across all
bounds to fight the social problems plaguing us.
Naaaah, probably not.

Choose the good guy
"I Come In Peace" is so bad that it's difficult to tell who are the good guys and who are the bad guys — and It's even tougher to like
either set. If you named Dolph Lundgren (left) as the good guy, you made the right call. The two evil aliens are Matthias Hues and Jay
Bilas (center and right), both of whom apparently got the same bad set of contacts.
