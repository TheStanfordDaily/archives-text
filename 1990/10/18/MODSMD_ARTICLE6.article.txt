# Debate panel discusses 'green' ballot options

### Cynthia Benton 
In a forum sponsored by the
Environmental Law Society last
night, a panel of speakers from
politics, law and industry
addressed the four environmental
propositions that will be included
on the Nov. 6 general election bal
lot.
The first initiative addressed at
the Law School debate was Propo
sition 128, or "Big Green," as it is
commonly called. The proposal is
a comprehensive environmental
legislation package that will regu
late pesticides, require reduced
emissions of greenhouse gases,
create an oil spill response fund,
establish water quality criteria
and appropriate money for envi
ronmental research and the acqui
sition of primeval forests.
Robert Brownstein, a member
of the board of directors of the
environmental group Campaign

California, spoke in favor of Big
Green. He said the proposition
was "deliberately and consistently
far-sighted" with a view "to pre
vent future environmental prob
lems."
One specific topic he addressed
was pesticide management. "To
call current methods for manag
ing pesticides scientific is prepos
terous," Brownstein said.
Current methods proscribe dif
ferent standards for pesticides in
processed fruits than those for
pesticides in raw fruits. Big Green
would standardize pesticide regu
lation as well as make it more
stringent by banning use of can
cer-causing pesticides.
In response to criticism that
the banning of pesticides and sub
stances which contribute to ozone
depletion and the greenhouse
effect will have a disastrous eco
nomic effect, Brownstein said,
"Those that innovate now have
the prospect of defining for them
selves a role" in the newly envi
ronmentally-conBcious Western
economies.
John Ronan of the Sedwick,
Detert, Moran and Arnold law
firm spoke against Big Green, cit
ing primarily economic reasons.
Ronan said the proposition
would "build an invisible wall
around the state of California"
because it would not allow the
importation of products made
with banned substances or, in the
case of fruit, grown with banned
pesticides.
Ronan also said the greenhouse
gas reduction plan alone is pre
dicted to cause "one million fewer
jobs in the state of California by
the year 2000."
In response to the new pesti
cide regulations, Ronan quoted
former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop who said that Big
Green would have no positive
effect on public health. Big Green
would allow pesticides to "be
banned on suspicion" rather than
on evidence, he added.
A more moderate initiative,
Proposition 135, which was
drafted in response to "Big

Green," was supported last night
by one of its co-writers, Robert
Shuler.
The main focus of Prop. 135 is
responsible management of pesti
cide use. Among other things, it
would require analysis of the inert
ingredients in pesticides. Al
though they constitute the bulk of
pesticides, these ingredients,
which do not have a direct role in
killing pests, are currently not
tested or regulated.
The next propositions debated
were Propositions 138 and 130.
Proposition 138 provides money
for forest and park restoration,
limits timber cutting practices on
certain private lands and insti
tutes several environmental stud
ies.
Proposition 130, commonly
called "Forests Forever," provides
for purchase of ancient forests by
the state, limits logging sites and
timber cutting practices, bans
clear-cutting and imposes sus
tained yield standards which will
not allow logging companies to cut
more than they grow.
