# New hope for AIDS
## DNA breakthrough could result in cure 
### Chris Patil 
Stanford biochemists have dis
covered a chemical trigger that
can inhibit cell reproduction,
paving the way for cancer and
AIDS cures, according to a report
published today in a scientific
journal.
These results, from experi
ments conducted in part by Dr.
Arthur Kornberg, a professor of
biochemistry at the School of
Medicine and a Nobel Prize recip
ient, were published in a recent
issue of Cell magazine.
DNA is the genetic material
which controls cell functions and
reproduction in all forms of life.
Regulating DNA replication is
crucial in an adult cell because
failing to inhibit reproduction
produces the uncontrollably
spreading, invasive mass of cells
commonly known as cancer.
The research was conducted in
the DNA of the common bac
terium Escherischia Coli. The cell
of an E. Coli isn't as complicated
as an animal cell, but it's still
extremely complex, Kornberg
said.
"If we can get this far with a
simple bacterium, we should use
that both as an inspiration and a
guide to do something comparable
for the mouse, the fruit fly, the
frog and the human cell."
The initiation and termination
of DNA synthesis are key pro
cesses in human development
because they regulate the differ
entiation of embryonic cells into
distinct, specialized organs.
The fields of genetic mutation
and embryonic development will
therefore benefit greatly from the
new knowledge, Kornberg said.
Kornberg lauded the willing
ness of the National Institute of
Health and the National Science
Foundation to continue financing
studies such as his even though
his research has no direct or
immediate application to the
treatment of a specific disease.
However, Kornberg also
lamented the increasing scarcity
of funding available to young,
bright researchers and asserted
that money needed for basic
research is being siphoned away
by crusades that promise quick
cures for cancer and other dis
eases.
The replication of an individual
chromosome is regulated by an
"off-on switch," a section of the
DNA molecule in which that chro
mosome's reproductive instruc
tions are encoded.
These switches are relatively

small when compared to the bac
terium's total genetic informa
tion: E. Coli chromosomes con
tain about four million chemical
subunits, or "base pairs," but a
switch is comprised of only 245
base pairs.
Romberg's group first identi
fied the enzyme system that acti
vates the E. Coli replication
switch in 1981.
After developing 40 technical
reports describing the functions of
each element in the complex sys
tem, the Romberg group was able
to begin the search for the specific
trigger that terminates DNA
replication in the bacterial cells.
"We discovered that the DNA

in the origin region, which is a
double helix and wound tightly,
open up and forms a bubble,"
Komberg said.
"It's in that bubble that the
DNA chains are started and sub
sequent replication events take
place. We found that the 'off
switch' is a protein, called 33-
kDA. By attaching to this region it
prevents that bubble from being
opened."
The protein's regulatopr role
was confirmed by experiments
that indicated its inhibitory effect
was only exerted on DNA in the
origin region, where DNA synthe
sis begins.
He pointed out that his group's

research resulted from nine years
of intensive work and many
related laboratory studies.
"If one wishes to design effec
tive antibiotics or drugs for can
cer, or AIDS treatment, it's essen
tial that we identify the switches
that activate cells from the adult
to a tumor state," Romberg said.
"And you don't get this informa
tion through a lottery."
Kornberg gives major credit for
the breakthrough to the chief
author of the report, Dr. Deog Su
Hwang, a postdoctoral fellow from
Seoul, South Korea who is cur
rently working with the Kornberg
group.
