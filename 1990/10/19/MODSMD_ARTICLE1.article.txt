# New hope for AIDS
## DNA breakthrough could result in cure 
### Chris Patil 
Stanford biochemists have dis
covered a chemical trigger that
can inhibit cell reproduction,
paving the way for cancer and
AIDS cures, according to a report
published today in a scientific
journal.
These results, from experi
ments conducted in part by Dr.
Arthur Kornberg, a professor of
biochemistry at the School of
Medicine and a Nobel Prize recip
ient, were published in a recent
issue of Cell magazine.
DNA is the genetic material
which controls cell functions and
reproduction in all forms of life.
Regulating DNA replication is
crucial in an adult cell because
failing to inhibit reproduction
produces the uncontrollably
spreading, invasive mass of cells
commonly known as cancer.
The research was conducted in
the DNA of the common bac
terium Escherischia Coli. The cell
of an E. Coli isn't as complicated
as an animal cell, but it's still
extremely complex, Kornberg
said.
"If we can get this far with a
simple bacterium, we should use
that both as an inspiration and a
guide to do something comparable
for the mouse, the fruit fly, the
frog and the human cell."
The initiation and termination
of DNA synthesis are key pro
cesses in human development
because they regulate the differ
entiation of embryonic cells into
distinct, specialized organs.
The fields of genetic mutation
and embryonic development will
therefore benefit greatly from the
new knowledge, Kornberg said.
Kornberg lauded the willing
ness of the National Institute of
Health and the National Science
Foundation to continue financing
studies such as his even though
his research has no direct or
immediate application to the
treatment of a specific disease.
However, Kornberg also
lamented the increasing scarcity
