### 
Lyda Kahn, the wife of a pro
fessor in the Art Department,
passed away in her home on
Wednesday after a battle with
cancer. She was 65.
Born in the Netherlands,
Kahn moved to Israel in 1938
and came to the United States
eight years later. She attended
the Cranbrook Academy of Art
in Michigan for two years,
where she studied design and
weaving.
In 1950, she married Art
Prof. Matt Kahn, whom she
met in Michigan, and joined
him at Stanford. Since then,
she had worked on various pro
jects with her husband and had

become an accomplished
weaver and interior designer.
Kahn is survived by her hus
band and two children, Ira and
Claire, both alumni of
Stanford, as well as her moth
er, step-mother, two sisters and
a brother.
Interment today at the Alta
Mesa Cemetery in Palo Alto
will be private, and a public
gathering in her memory will
take place at the Faculty Club
next Thursday at 4 p.m.
The family has requested
that, in lieu of flowers, dona
tions be sent to Point Lobos
Natural History Association,
Route 1, Box 62, Carmel,
California 94923.
