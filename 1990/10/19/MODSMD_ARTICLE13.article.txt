D.C. curfew proposal criticized
WASHINGTON (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union
and a National Guard official criticized Mayor Marion Barry's
suggestion yesterday that curfews be imposed and troops called
out to help slow the number of drug-related homicides in the
nation's capital.
Barry said Wednesday night that the city's drug wars and
homicide rate are "out of control." He said he may impose a cur
few to keep drug dealers off city streets and may ask President
Bush to send National Guard troops to conduct traffic patrols and
help man roadblocks in drug-ravaged areas.
De Klerk meets ANC demand
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - President F.W. de
Klerk, meeting a key African National Congress demand yester
day, lifted the 4-year-old state of emergency in violence-plagued
Natal Province.
The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups welcomed the move,
which de Klerk said removed all obstacles to negotiating power
sharing between the dominant white minority and the black
mtyority.
"There is only one route to peace and reconciliation — that is
through peaceful negotiation," the president said in Pretoria.
"The door to this is now fully open, and I am appealing to all lead
ers and all South Africans to accept the challenge."
Emergency ballots for Gulf troops
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Thousands of voters will be in Saudi
Arabia on Election Day, but a Raleigh company is helping some of
them obtain absentee ballots from home via facsimile machines.
"This is an emergency ballot process that's been developed to
make sure the troops get to vote," said W. Edward Weems Jr.,
president of Election Technology Co., which is handling fax voting
for U.S. personnel taking part in Operation Desert Shield.
Weems said elections officials can use the system to fax ballots
through a communications system established with AT&T. In
almost all cases, soldiers will mail their ballots back to their local
elections board.
Hostages' freedom put on hold
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Freedom for British hostages in
Lebanon may take time if the restoration of diplomatic ties
between Syria and Britain is made a condition for their release, a
Western diplomatic source said yesterday.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said he
saw no linkage between British and U.S. hostages. He said there
was "nothing special" to indicate any U.S. hostages would be
freed soon.
