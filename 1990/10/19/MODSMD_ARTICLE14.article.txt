# Big boost slated for social security checks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's 40
million Social Security recipients will receive
their biggest benefit boost in 8 1/2 years next
January, a 5.4 percent increase that will give
an average retiree an extra $31 a month.
The annual cost-of-living increase,
announced by the government yesterday, will
mean that the typical benefit check will climb
to $602 per month next year from $571 this
year.
The maximum monthly benefit for a work
er retiring in 1991 at age 65 will rise by $47 to
$1,022, the Social Security Administration
said.
Since 1975, benefits have risen automatical

ly each year, keeping pace with the annual
inflation rate, with the exception of six months
in 1983 that were skipped to help bail the
Social Security system out of a crisis.
The 1991 increase became known with the
release of the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index for September. The cost-of-living
change is derived by comparing the CPI price
level in the July-August-September period
with the index for the same period a year earli
er.
The 5.4 percent rise, which will show up in
Jan. 3 benefit checks, followed increases of 4.7
percent this year and 4 percent in 1989. It will
be the biggest advance since a 7.4 percent jump

in July 1982.
The Social Security increase will be mir
rored in 5.4 percent increases in other govern
ment programs, including the Supplemental
Security Income program for poor people and
federal pension programs for retired civilian
and military personnel.
In making yesterday's announcement,
Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S.
King said the increase in payments for Social
Security and SSI recipients "will be their
assurance that those checks will continue to
allow them to pay for needed goods and ser
vices."
