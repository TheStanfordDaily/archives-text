# U.N. weighs war reparations measure while Iraq offers cheap oil
## 
### 
Members of the U.N. Security
Council were weighing a war
reparations measure against Iraq
yesterday.
At the United Nations, diplo
mats said the five permanent
Security Council members had
reached general agreement on a
measure that would allow nations
hurt economically by the invasion
of Kuwait to seek compensation
from Iraq.
The British, French, Soviet,
Chinese and U.S. ambassadors
presented the draft to the other
10 council members yesterday
after settling on a text in closed
door consultations.
Under the measure, countries
could apply for compensation out
of Iraq's frozen assets or against
its future oil earnings, diplomats
said. No formal council meeting
has yet been set to consider it.
U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, meanwhile, was

quoted as saying hopes for a
peaceful solution appeared dim.
"The U.N. Charter's Article 42
permits military action," he told
the German news magazine
Stern. "Should the Security
Council come to that decision,
that would be completely legal."
Oil on sale
In other developments, the
Baghdad government, battered by
global sanctions, ordered
rationing of medicines and offered
to sell oil — cheap.
In what was widely seen as a
bid to get around U.N.-imposed
sanctions, Iraq offered yesterday
to sell its oil to anyone — includ
ing the United States — at pre
invasion prices of $21 a barrel.
The sale of Iraqi oil has been
frozen under an embargo imposed
after the invasion.
Iraq said its offer to sell cheap
oil was a humanitarian gesture,

but diplomatic sources in Bagh
dad dismissed the offer as a ploy
to try to divide the world commu
nity, which has been largely
united on the sanctions issue.
In an indication of the sanc
tions' impact, Iraq's Ministry of
Health ordered drug rationing at
all hospitals and private pharma
cies. The government daily Al-
Jumhouriya quoted a ministry
spokesman as saying the move
was prompted by the economic
embargo.
The Baghdad government is
also rationing some foodstuffs.
U.S. economy affected
But Iraq is not alone in feeling
the effects of the gulf crisis.
High oil prices, fueled by the
12-week-old Persian Gulf crisis,
pushed up the cost of living for
Americans and helped widen the
U.S. trade deficit, the government
said Wednesday in two reports.
The U.S. government said
energy prices in September
jumped 5.6 percent, the steepest
rise on record since the Labor
Department began tracking them
in 1957.
Higher oil prices also pushed
imports to a record high, widening
the U.S. merchandise trade deficit
by 2.4 percent in August.
Although oil prices have risen
dramatically since the invasion,
they fell back on yesterday.
On the New York Mercantile
Exchange, a key oil market, the
price of benchmark light-sweet
crude for November delivery
dropped to $35 a barrel, down
from $36.72 on Wednesday. It was
also down from a record high of
$41 a barrel earlier this month.
Soviets propose peace plan
In a renewed diplomatic bid to
break the gulf impasse, Secretary
of State James A. Baker 111 met
with an envoy from Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev yester
day. The envoy, Evgeny Primakov,
is to meet with President Bush
tomorrow.
The Washington Times auoted
yesterday unnamed U.S. officials
as saying Primakov was carrying

a Soviet peace plan. The proposal
calls on Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait — possibly in exchange
for elections in the emirate and
cash compensation to Iraq to set
tle an oil claims dispute.
But Baker earlier this week
ruled out any solution short of
total Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait, which it overran on Aug.

Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, arriving in
Vienna for talks yesterday with
his French counterpart, Roland
Dumas, was -asked about
prospects for a breakthrough.
"It's difficult to talk about new
ideas. I have not brought any
ready-made concept with me,"
Shevardnadze said. "Nobody has
»»
one.

On other fronts:
In other gulf-related develop
ments:
• Iran and Iraq continued a
rapprochement begun after the
invasion. Tehran Radio said the
two would resume a prisoner-of
war exchange next week, and Iran
said its Baghdad embassy would
officially reopen Saturday. Iran
and Iraq had closed embassies in
one another's capitals during
their 1980-88 war.
• A plan under consideration
by Japanese lawmakers to send
Japanese troops to the gulf con
tinued to fuel protests. About 250
Japanese police entered the Kyoto
University campus in western
Japan and arrested two students
occupying the dean's office to
protest the plan. Police said about

80 people rallied outside the For
eign Ministry in Tokyo.
Critics say the deployment of
troops, even in non-combat roles,
would violate Japan's postwar
constitution.
• Three Japanese nationals
were given exit visas by the Iraqis
and arrived in Amman, Jordan,
then flew on to London. A fourth
Japanese national was due in Jor
dan from Iraq.
• Iraq claimed yesterday that
two war planes had violated its
airspace near the Saudi border
this week. It said it made a formal
protest to Saudi Arabia. The U.S.
military and Saudi Arabia have
denied at least two previous
claims of violations of Iraqi
airspace.
