# Japan apologizes for racial remark
## 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic Party said yesterday it will send a
group of lawmakers to Washington to follow
up new apologies by a Cabinet minister for
racial remarks that infuriated black Ameri
cans.
In his remarks on Sept. 21 following a
police raid on a Tokyo red-light district, Jus
tice Minister Seiroku Fujiyama compared the
arrival of foreign prostitutes in Japan to
blacks moving into white neighborhoods in
the United States.
Foreign Ministry officials said
apologized in a letter to the U.S. Congressional
Black Caucus, which demanded his resigna
tion. They said Japanese Ambassador Ryohei
Murata delivered Kajiyama's letter of apology
in Washington on Wednesday to Rep. Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the 24-member
caucus.
Murata also asked the caucus to reconsider
its proposed resolution demanding the resig
nation, but received no immediate response,

an official said.
The resolution, to be presented to the U.S.
House of Representatives, asks that Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu officially apologize and
suggests programs to improve Japanese offi
cials' understanding of racial issues.
Murata later delivered a letter from Kaifu
to the National Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People in which the prime
minister apologized for Kajiyama's remarks
and pledged to work for more awareness
among the Japanese of American minority
problems, said a Foreign Ministry official.
Kfyiyama retracted his comments four days
after making them. He also apologized to U.S.
Ambassador Michael Armacost.
Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-general of the Lib
eral Democrats, said yesterday the party
decided to send a group of legislators to the
United States to make further explanations.
He said the delegates would meet with con
gressional leaders, particularly the Black Cau
cus, in hopes of heading off the resolution. He

said passage of the resolution "could damage
the relations between Japan and the United
States."
In his latest letter, Kajiyama said he did not
intend any racial discrimination in his com
ments.
"I learned again how deeply I have hurt the
feelings of the American people, particularly
African-Americans," he said.
"What I thoughtlessly said on Sept. 21 was
wrong and grossly improper. Although I am
acutely aware how difficult it is to heal the
wounds that my remarks inflicted, I will per
sonally do whatever I can to strengthen
Japan's relationship with the African-Ameri
can community."
Kajiyama is not the first Japanese politi
cian to have offended minorities with public
racial remarks.
In 1988, former Finance Minister Michio
Watanabe said American blacks have few
qualms about going bankrupt and implied
they walk away from debts.
