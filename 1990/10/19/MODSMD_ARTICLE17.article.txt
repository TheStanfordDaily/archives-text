# Killed amendment stalls budget talks

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate voted 55-45 yesterday to
defeat an effort of raising taxes on
the rich and moderating a Medi
care premium increase as it strug
gled to complete work on a deficit
reduction plan.
The vote killed an amendment
by Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn. 112
and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
that would have scaled back
increases in gasoline taxes and
Medicare premiums and substi
tuted a House-approved, three
pronged attack on those with
higher incomes.
The amendment was one of
more than two dozen prepared for
Senate consideration, many of
which have been designed to move

the Senate bill closer to the soak
the-rich package that won House
approval Tuesday.
"Do we want to ask senior citi
zens in the hospital to pay more so
the wealthiest in our society can
pay less?" Gore asked before the
vote on his amendment.
"The middle class has no more
to give," Mikulski said.
Democratic leaders praised the
aim of the amendment but said it
would have killed the deficit
reduction package because Presi
dent Bush has promised to veto
any plan raising the top tax rate
on the wealthiest Americans to 33
percent. The proposal would have
raised that rate from 28 percent.
