### Samantha Sherman 
The recent explosion of violence at the Temple Mount in East
Jerusalem has put an additional strain on the already fragile
alliance against Saddam Hussein led by the United States.
On the morning of Oct. 8, Jewish worshipers at the Western
Wall in Jerusalem were attacked by a Palestinian showering of

Although President Bush quickly joined the U.N.
Security Council last Friday to condemn Israel, he
has nevertheless been put in an extremely difficult
position in dealing with a U.S. ally. The United

Nations resolved to investigate the Israeli shooting.
Any sign of weakness in the United Nations coalition agaipst
Iraq will encourage Hussein to hold out. History Assoc. Prof. Joel
Beinin said one of the most dominant reasons for Bush's response
was the necessity to maintain the alliance against Iraq.
A U.S. veto of the resolution would paint the United States as
Israel's blind defender, embarrassing both the United States and
the moderate Arab countries with which it is allied.
An American veto would also have supported Hussein's claims
that he is a veritable leader of the Arabs and a defender of the
Palestinians, Beinin suggested.
"Had the United States not acted, a harsher resolution would
have resulted which the United States could not and would not
have supported," Beinin said.
The Bush administration has long felt uncomfortable with the
hard stance taken by the Israeli government under Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Beinin said while this tension has only been verbally expressed,
it is possible that at some point further the United States might
take a more drastic approach.
Israel has openly rejected the U.N. resolution. Shamir
announced the Israeli government will refuse to cooperate with
any kind of U.N.-sponsored investigation and would treat the
team "as tourists." U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar has responded to this by postponing the mission.
