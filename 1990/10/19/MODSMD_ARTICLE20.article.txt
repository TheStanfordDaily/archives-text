## A 						clearer structure 
### 
Cabinet of deans
should reinforce
academic mission

STANFORD UNIVERSITY
has undertaken an ambitious
and farsighted step in
restructuring the upper levels of
its administration.
The change is in line with both
the University's repositioning
efforts and its renewed commit
ment to teaching.
By streamlining the Univer
sity's bureaucracy, the changes will
reduce its costs. The more corpo
rate structure of University
administration will hopefully cre
ate a more efficient bureaucracy.
The University is also showing
that its "repositioning" is not
merely a euphemism for laying off
lower-level employees. In eliminat
ing positions in the upper echelons
of the administration, Stanford is
showing its commitment to reposi
tioning at all levels.
The new structure also clarifies
the responsibilities and authorities
of every University position, a
move which may reduce conflicts
and facilitate goal-setting.
What's more, the University has
designed its new administrative
structure around the academic
mission which University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy described to
students in his April address.
The main body of policy recom
mendation for the University will
be the cabinet, which will be com
prised primarily of the deans of
Stanford's seven schools. The
cabinet will advise the president on
matters of University policy and

planning. Previously, such respon
sibilities had been reserved for the
vice presidents.
The new structure gives Stan
ford's academic arm an unprece
dented role in setting University
priorities and advising the presi
dent on policy.
In what Provost James Rosse
described as "an inversion of the
old order," Stanford has put its pol
icy-making process iri the hands of
those most conscious of the Uni
versity's academic mission.
In a period when many of our
nation's universities are being crit
icized for having lost sight of their
academic purpose, it is good to see
that President Kennedy's dedica
tion to Stanford's academic mis
sion is such a strong commitment.
Giving the deans such influence
over University policy is a bold and
admirable step in achieving
Kennedy's goal.
It is also notable that the Direc
tor of the Hoover Institution has
been included on the cabinet, a
sign that relations between Hoover
and the University have warmed.
Students will benefit from the
restructuring. They may soon
enjoy more efficiently run student
services and, in the long run, better
educational programs.
Even more exciting is the spirit
of thoughtful self-reflection with
which Kennedy, Rosse and others
seem to be approaching the reposi
tioning process.
"Budget cut" and "reposition
ing" are, in many circles, feared
and dreaded words.
It is reassuring to see that Stan
ford is using this budget crisis as
an opportunity for thoughtful self
examination and a renewed com
mitment to that which is most
important.
