A cappella material does not promote sexist stereotype

WE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND
to Susan McKean's and Sofia
Sorenson's letter concerning the
song "Paddlin' Madeline Home" sung by
the Mendicants, and the assertion in
that letter that language in this song is
"part of the problem" rather than part of
the solution in attempts to eradicate sex
ual assault.
Without wishing to belittle the serious
problem of sexual assault, we do not see
now this song could possibly be inter
preted as "irresponsible."
In particular, McKean and Sorensen
were offended by the line "She never
says no, so I kiss her and go."
In this line, and in the entire song, it
is clear that kissing is as far as the two
people go. The first two lines of the song
state that these two people are in love
with each other, and paddle in a canoe
every evening.
Surely a reference to how Madeline

"never says no" to a kiss (and only a
kiss) from the man she loves does not
suggest a sexual stereotype that is part
of the problem of sexual assault.
This is not a first date, nor a casual
relationship. It is instead a prolonged
and loving relationship, where a kiss is
surely commonplace.

The only reference in the song to any
thing beyond a kiss is one of the final
lines in the song, which goes, "If she'd
only say, throw your paddle away..
This line makes several points clear.
Consent for anything further than a kiss
rests with her, and anything beyond a
kiss is only wishful thinking on his part,

even though both are in love.
He may wish for more, but he still
paddles her home every night without
receiving anything more than the kiss.
Surely a song that refers to a loving,
consensual relationship in which old
fashioned courting is the subject is not
part of the problem.
If everything must fall onto one side
or the other of this issue, surely a song
offering such a wholesome alternative is
part of the solution, not the problem.
We expect to continue to sing this
song, neither in defiance, nor in igno
rance of the problem of sexual assault.
Instead, we will sing it for its musical
qualities, confident that the song, in its
entirety, does not contribute to the sorts
of stereotypes that inhibit attempts to
eradicate sexual assault.
