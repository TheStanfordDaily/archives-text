# Multiple-choice test on alcohol policy
## 
### 
Time for a quiz, everyone! Don't
worry, there's only one question on this
quiz, and it's multiple-choice.
1. If you don't agree with a law (the
state drinking-age law, for example), you
should:
(a) Disregard it.
(b) Whine that your university won't
institute a means of circumventing it.
(c) Obey it, but only if there's a lot of
grant money at stake.
(d)Tiy to change it into something
you can respect.
Persons who chose (a), Ob), or (c) score
two points. Persons who chose (d) may

wish to contemplate why the hell they're
at Stanford.
