# Columnist inspired slew of offbeat ideas for Stanford
## 
### 
After reading Virginia Tsai's last col
umn, we all breathed a sigh of relief.
We've always felt sort of alone in our
belief that we're surrounded by a bunch
of fun-loathing doo-doo-heads.
We were sitting around late last night,
talking (we know, wacky, wacky, wacky!),
when we came up with a list of even
more madcap antics for all of us to try:
•Go "out through the"in" door at
the bookstore;

• Push the 5 button in Meyer elevator,
well knowing that you can only get to 4;
• Read the graffiti on the carrels in
Green, and chuckle lightly to yourself;
• Wake up late, don't take a shower,
and wear a hat to class;
• Heck, let's get really zany: wake up
late, don't take a shower, don't wear a
hat and don't even go to class;
• Use a computer without a priority
card;
• Talk with friends out loud at Meyer,
third floor;
• Why not, talk with friends even after
you leave Meyer;
• At Flicks, throw paper at people you
don't know;
• Ride your bike through walk-bike
tie-dye-salespeople-zone;
•Do Daily crossword... in class!;
• Take three Rice Crispie treats when
it says to take only two;
• Buy required books only, and bag

the recommended ones;
• Don't register refrigerator, and hide
it in your car over break;
• Miss a house meeting;
• Sneak a copy of the Review into your
room and read it under the covers;
• Return a Meyer book to Green.
We hope that our kookiness is truly
inspirational and encourages more of our
community to take a walk on that oh-so
less-trodden-wild-side.
