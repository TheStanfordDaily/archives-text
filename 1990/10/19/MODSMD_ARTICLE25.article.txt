## Grown-up, shmown-up 
### 
Three days a week i work at
Bing Nursery School. Three days a
week I read stories to four-year
olds. Three days a week I make boogers
out of rubber cement.
Last Wednesday, I was innocently
swinging on a tire, when one of the kids
walked up to me and told me that I wasn't
allowed on the swings.
"Whaddya mean?" I asked — pur
posely confusing my phonemes in order to
fit in.
"You can't play. You're a grown-up."
1...2...3...4...1 slowly counted
to ten, remembering what Bert had
taught me to do when I got angry.
I knew I wasn't a grown-up, and, more
importantly, I knew that the philosophy
department had given me the skills to
destroy even the largest group of four
year-olds in an analytical debate.
"First of all," I began, "I do not work; I
go to school. Grown-ups work, they do not
to school. Ergo, as this syllogism incon
trovertibly ascertains, I am not a grown
up."
I had yet begun to Hegelize. I needed to
prove to myself that I still had plenty of
time to lead a happy, care-free life o' fun.
I was no senior; I had no Career Faires to
go to, no appointments at the CPPC. I
had three more Exotic Erotics to attend
before I had to undergo any kind of matu
ration.
This was no longer about the tire
swing. They were telling me to get off the
playground of life. They were sending me
metaphysical letters telling me to declare
a and decide what I want to be
when I grow up.

I began to yawp. "A grown-up?! A
GROWN-UP?!!!" But I was yawping at no
one. They had since dispersed around the
playground.
I sat down on a chair which was clearly
too small for me and began to deal with
my post-pubescent crisis. I was wearing a
metaphorical three-piece suit. I pictured
myself shaking peoples' hands and say
ing, "It's a pleasure to meet you." I would
have to start using utensils at meals.
I was scared. I was frightened. I was a
master of synonyms. I was afraid of being
deserted by the comfort of childhood,
thrown out of the womb without so much
as a woobie to help me write my resume.
"Guys," I called to them hesitantly.
"Where do the ducks go in the winter?" I
sensed that they had missed the literary
reference. "No. What I mean is, what
makes someone a grown-up?"
I was told that grown-ups can eat as
much ice cream as they want, have no
bedtime and get to go to power lunches
(Hey, they're all from Palo Alto).
Although this certainly was an attrac
tive picture of the post-college world, I
doubted that 3 a.m. conferences with
Michael Eisner at Swensen's was an accu
rate description of adulthood.
I know what my parents do for fun.
They go out to dinner and the movies. If
they feel crazy they see a play or, if they're
lucky, Peter Allen is in town. Every so
often, they go to couple-parties. I get the
feeling that the craziest it gets is when
they giggle over lewd Pictionary draw
ings.
My parents wouldn't take their whif
fle bats in front of the suites and pretend

they're '50s baseball stars playing Home
Run Derby. They wouldn't tie the belts of
their bathrobes together and dangle
teddy bears out the window. And I
couldn't picture either of them on the tire
swing.
I knew I was at a pivotal moment in my'
life. The background music began to'
crescendo. There was no time for a com-j
mercial break.
I ran toward the tire swings and
jumped on. The kids started to tell me to\
get off but I covered my ears and started ;
to sing, "I can't hear you! La-la-la-la-la! I •
can't hear you!"
They tried to tell me that I was a J
grown-up, but this time I didn't care; 11
knew better. "I know you are but what am ;
I?! I know you are but what am I?!"
I was unstoppable. One little boy^
whined, "Let me have a turn. I love the
tire swing!"
"Then why don't you marry it!" I;
yelled as I swung higher and higher.
Growing up is a decision you make*
yourself. It's an attitude. And it happens
when you go to Miyake's and you don't
yell "Heh-shay!" because you're afraid of;
what other people will think.

bedtime and get to go to power lunches
(Hey, they're all from Palo Alto).
Although this certainly was an attrac
tive picture of the post-college world, I
doubted that 3 a.m. conferences with
Michael Eisner at Swensen's was an accu
rate description of adulthood.
I know what my parents do for fun.
They go out to dinner and the movies. If
they feel crazy they see a play or, if they're
lucky, Peter Allen is in town. Every so
often, they go to couple-parties. I get the
feeling that the craziest it gets is when
they giggle over lewd Pictionary draw
ings.
My parents wouldn't take their whif
fle bats in front of the suites and pretend

they're '50s baseball stars playing Home
Run Derby. They wouldn't tie the belts of
their bathrobes together and dangle
teddy bears out the window. And I
couldn't picture either of them on the tire
swing.
I knew I was at a pivotal moment in my'
life. The background music began to'
crescendo. There was no time for a com-j
mercial break.
I ran toward the tire swings and
jumped on. The kids started to tell me to\
get off but I covered my ears and started ;
to sing, "I can't hear you! La-la-la-la-la! I •
can't hear you!"
They tried to tell me that I was a J
grown-up, but this time I didn't care; 11
knew better. "I know you are but what am ;
I?! I know you are but what am I?!"
I was unstoppable. One little boy^
whined, "Let me have a turn. I love the
tire swing!"
"Then why don't you marry it!" I;
yelled as I swung higher and higher.
Growing up is a decision you make*
yourself. It's an attitude. And it happens
when you go to Miyake's and you don't
yell "Heh-shay!" because you're afraid of;
what other people will think.

Three days a week i work at
Bing Nursery School. Three days a
week I read stories to four-year
olds. Three days a week I make boogers
out of rubber cement.
Last Wednesday, I was innocently
swinging on a tire, when one of the kids
walked up to me and told me that I wasn't
allowed on the swings.
"Whaddya mean?" I asked — pur
posely confusing my phonemes in order to
fit in.
"You can't play. You're a grown-up."
1...2...3...4...1 slowly counted
to ten, remembering what Bert had
taught me to do when I got angry.
I knew I wasn't a grown-up, and, more
importantly, I knew that the philosophy
department had given me the skills to
destroy even the largest group of four
year-olds in an analytical debate.
"First of all," I began, "I do not work; I
go to school. Grown-ups work, they do not
to school. Ergo, as this syllogism incon
trovertibly ascertains, I am not a grown
up."
I had yet begun to Hegelize. I needed to
prove to myself that I still had plenty of
time to lead a happy, care-free life o' fun.
I was no senior; I had no Career Faires to
go to, no appointments at the CPPC. I
had three more Exotic Erotics to attend
before I had to undergo any kind of matu
ration.
This was no longer about the tire
swing. They were telling me to get off the
playground of life. They were sending me
metaphysical letters telling me to declare
a and decide what I want to be
when I grow up.

I began to yawp. "A grown-up?! A
GROWN-UP?!!!" But I was yawping at no
one. They had since dispersed around the
playground.
I sat down on a chair which was clearly
too small for me and began to deal with
my post-pubescent crisis. I was wearing a
metaphorical three-piece suit. I pictured
myself shaking peoples' hands and say
ing, "It's a pleasure to meet you." I would
have to start using utensils at meals.
I was scared. I was frightened. I was a
master of synonyms. I was afraid of being
deserted by the comfort of childhood,
thrown out of the womb without so much
as a woobie to help me write my resume.
"Guys," I called to them hesitantly.
"Where do the ducks go in the winter?" I
sensed that they had missed the literary
reference. "No. What I mean is, what
makes someone a grown-up?"
I was told that grown-ups can eat as
much ice cream as they want, have no
bedtime and get to go to power lunches
(Hey, they're all from Palo Alto).
