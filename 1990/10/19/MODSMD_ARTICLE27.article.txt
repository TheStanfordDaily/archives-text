## Jon Reider Stanford in 2090 has Reagan Hall, Disney and the Rodin forgeries 
### 
Many of the old-timers
shook their heads in dismay and
disbelief, but in their hearts they
had known the day of reckoning was
bound to come someday.
But who among them had suspected it
would come on what would have been the
second Centennial of what used to be
known as Stanford University?
No one alive could remember the days
of greatness, the acme of the first Centen
nial of 1990, but since the idea of a Cen
tennial was too good an idea to jettison
after merely six years of celebration, some
could recall the later stages of that Cen
tennial extending far into the 21st cen
tury, as Stanford commemorated the
Centennial of each building and great
moment as its turn came, culminating in
the Centennial of Coed Housing in 2066.
Thus the irony of the timing of the
final collapse was not lost on those with a
historical sensibility.
The closure of the University was a
field day for the historians, of course, as
they sifted through the debris of the past
century's archives, looking for the tell
tale clues to the eventual decline and fall
of the Great Western University. It had
changed its name in 2075 after being
absorbed by a savings and loan conglom
erate that had bought up most of its junk
bonds.
It had already changed its name once
before: to the University of Northern Cal
ifornia in imitation of its mtyor rival to
the south, which by 2040 exceeded it in
academic eminence as well as in football
prowess.
That name change had made sense,
since in 2031 President Glenn Campbell
111 had declared the school mascot to be
the Greeks (vs. the Trojans) and had
required that all the students live in fra
ternities and sororities.
All of the traditional dorms had been
taken over by University offices in the
2020'5, as the bureaucracy had repro
duced itself again and again.
The famous repositioning of 1990 was
long forgotten as the Office of Student
Consultative International Patent
Licensing Information took over Wilbur
(more recently Reagan Hall), and the
Computerized Network of Multicultural

Academic Service Resources Assistance
occupied earthquake-safe Roble (now
renamed Quayle Hall in honor of the
President who had led the country to vic
tory in the Third Iraqi War of 2004).
In 2090, the few remaining traditional
ists thought it fitting that the last presi
dent of Stanford, as they still insisted on
calling it, was named Leland, in imitation
of its founder.
Yes, it was true that President Leland
Disney had done his best to save the place
at the end. The move into outer space was
a striking gesture, following the tradition
of past Overseas Studies Programs, but
the cost of maintaining a campus on Mars
for only three student-astronauts ulti
mately added to the strain on the budget.
Selling library books to students
instead of loaning them out had seemed a
clever idea at first, but the library, like oil
a century earlier, was a finite resource,

and once the books were gone, nothing
could replace them as a source of revenue.
Selling the Biology Department to Syntex
had raised some cash at the end, but not
enough.
The scandals had hurt too, of course.
The attempt to sell off the Rodin sculp
tures had ended in a fiasco when it was
found that many of them were late 20th
century forgeries, and imperfect ones at
that.
President Rebholz's investigation in
2010 showed that the forgeries had been
hidden with the supposed earthquake
supplies in 1990, but nobody could prove
who had made them. Some doubts had
lingered about the excessive amount of
bronze that had been ordered for the
reconstruction of Memorial Church.
Yet some historians thought that this
sort of analysis overemphasized the more
obvious examples of decadence and decay,

as if the decline of the Roman Empire
could be blamed solely on the madness of
Caligula.
These historians, known as recon
structive post-hedonists, searched for
more subtle clues that went unnoticed a
century ago as the university reached its
apparent zenith.
It was not, they suggested, the fault of
the budget cuts, the rumors of overcharg
ing the government for research over
head, the earthquake, the decline in the
applicant pool or the orgy of self-congrat
ulation that characterized the Centen
nial.
These were in fact quite bearable, even
signs of strength as the university
marched on. Rather, the fatal weakness
was something more insidious and decep
tively benign.
The Centennial of 1990 had been built
on great achievements, not only of the

early period of Stanford's founding, but
also of the great debates of the 1960s
about the role of a university as a forum
for social action and the responsibility of
intellectuals to speak the truth against
power.

Selling library books to
students instead of loan
ing them out had seemed
a clever idea at first.

ROTC, the draft, civil rights, Vietnam
â€” human lives were on the line about
these issues. Even as recently as the late
1980s, the University had been alive with
intellectual ferment about the content of
the Western Culture/CIV requirement,
the debate over freedom of speech versus
freedom from harassment and the con
flicting demands of research and teach
ing.
To be sure, these debates had produced
their share of impassioned rhetoric as
well as some enlightenment, but at least
one had a sense they were about real
issues that mattered in people's lives.
Honest people could agree to disagree
since the issues were complex, but no one
thought them trivial.
Suddenly, these topics vanished from
public discussion as if genuine intellec
tual discourse had become too great a
burden to be sustained.
In their place could be found only ster
ile and unbecoming tempests about
cheerleaders, phone systems, football
seats and alcohol policy.
All of these seemed normal at first,
even harmless, since they aroused only
false passions, but as time passed and
nothing of significance was ever discussed
again, the seeds of decay began to sprout.
As flash increasingly replaced sub
stance, it was only a matter of time before
the freedom to think became less fashion
able than the freedom to drink.
The long slide toward 2090 had begun.
