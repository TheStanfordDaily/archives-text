# Child care becomes a top priority of the '90s

"Child care is going to be one of the big
issues of the 19905," said Kathleen Ritchie,
director of Stanford's Office of Family and
Child Services.
Ritchie is one of many child care profession
als at Stanford and nationwide who are trying
to cope with what they call a critical time for
child care in the country.
"The need for child care has become even
more critical in the last ten years," said

Ritchie.
The influx of single parents and households
where both parents must work or attend
school has forced the issue of child care
options to the top of the priority list for many
employees and employers.
To cast light on some of the challenges sur
rounding child care, Stanford later this month
will host a conference titled: "The Future Is
Now: Voice For Children."
Scheduled for October 27 from 8:15 a.m. to
12:15 p.m., the event will take place in the
Faber Auditorium at the Stanford Children's

Hospital.
The conference will focus on the needs of
young children and their families and the
resources available to them.
The emphasis will be on current legal, edu
cational and health issues, and on the respon
sibility of government and society to children
in the 19905, according to organizers.
The program includes a keynote address by
Richard Behrman, M.D., director of the David
and Lucile Packard Foundation Center for the
Future of Children.
Panelist presentations on legis
lation, legal and health issues will
follow the keynote address, as
well as panels on child care and
early childhood education.
The conference is sponsored by
the Office of Child and Family
Services, individual Stanford
child care programs, the Chil
dren's Hospital and the Stanford
chapter of Children Now.
Ritchie stressed the impor
tance of examining child care
issues not just in the Stanford
community, but on a national
level, as a societal obligation to
care for its children, instead of
just a logistical care program.
She referred to the quote by
Marion Wright Edelman of the
Children's Defense Fund that
appears on the front of the confer
ence brochure as embodying one
of the most important issues fac
ing our country in the next decade
and beyond.

"We are currently sacrificing
more than one-fifth of our chil
dren," Edelman is quoted as say
ing. "It's not too late to save our
children â€” or our nation's future.
But to do it, we have to give chil
dren our voices. Speak up for chil
dren."
Ritchie stressed the "impera
tive investment that must be
made in our children." She added
that the country as a whole must
support the health and develop
ment of each new generation.
"This isn't just a problem par
ents must face on their own," she
emphasized. "It must be a com
munity and societal responsibil
ity, as well, if we are to support
the growth of our nation's chil
dren."
Because of the high costs
involved in running a child care
program, fees continue to rise.
"Because child care is a very
staff-intensive business, a good
staff is the key to a good pro
gram," Ritchie stressed.
Child care professionals are
traditionally underpaid, even
though they carry a high level of
responsibility and must possess a

face on their own. It must be a community and

support the growth of our nation's children.'

high skill level.
In order to hire good child care
staff and keep them from leaving,
a large part of the facilities expen
ditures goes to staff salaries.
"Stanford has done a lot in
terms of programs and diversity,"
Ritchie said. "Now our goal is to
make it more affordable."
She commented that the
affordability of the program is a
major obstacle, and one of the
issues the Office of Family and
Child Services plans to address in
upcoming years.
It doesn't matter how diverse
or well-run the programs are, she
explained, if parents aren't able to
afford to keep their children in
the centers.
Several options are currently
being explored to help improve
the affordability of child care
facilities.

Ritchie is hopeful that the Uni
versity may begin a subsidization
program in the next few years for
the Stanford community pro
grams.
Another option is cafeteria
style benefits. The employer
offers a selection of benefits, as a
cafeteria offers a variety of meals
to choose from.
The employee can choose
health insurance, dental insur
ance, child care, life insurance or
other possible benefits that are
offered.
This program would be benefi
cial for parents who both work.
One of the parents would receive
health insurance benefits
through his employer that would
cover his entire family, while his
spouse, who then wouldn't need
health care benefits, could receive
child care benefits instead.
