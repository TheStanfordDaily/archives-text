An earthquake measuring 7.1 on the
Richter scale struck Stanford's campus,
and tHfc entire Bay Area, at 5:04 p.m. today.
While no one at Stanford was killed or
maimed, the temblor caused millions of dol
lars in damage to the campus. University
officials had to close numerous buildings
and dormitories, and all classes for the fol

We had snow days back in the Midwest
where I went to high school, and even one
fog day, but we never had quake days. I just

locusts on the day of my CSIOSA final ?
More than 500 students whose houses
were damaged were left homeless during
the next few days, and about 150 ended up
being reassigned to other dorms for the
remainder of the year. Lisa Brooks, a
Columbae resident, said the day after the
quake, "I have a bad feeling we'll be living
somewhere else." To ensure the homeless
would not go hungry, University Food Ser-

Talk about getting hit when you're

ences a violent shuddering that causes
major internal damage, and then so do you.
By the way, Brooks, a senior, also had bad
feelings about the Berlin Wall, about bet
ting on Mike Tyson against Buster Douglas
and about accepting that job after gradua
tion in Kuwait City.
