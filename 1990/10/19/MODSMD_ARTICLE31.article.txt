# In a quake, is any floor safe?
## 
### Amy Gillett 
Dear Bug,
Is it better to be on the first floor
or the third floor if an earthquake
hits?
— ZAP Resident
Dear ZAP Resident,
In case you haven't looked
lately, your residence only has two
floors. But, your question is still a
valid one. Or is it? Mr. Fouad
Bendimerad, manager of the Seis
mic Risk Project, implied that my
question was really stupid, at
which point I wished I had your
name so I could pass the blame
more effectively.
Bendimerad said that it was
impossible to predict which floor
would be the safest in the event of
a quake. He posed the question:
"Would you prefer to come crash
ing througn two floors with
debris, or would you rather have
people and debris come crashing
down on you?"
No matter how you look at it,
you'll end up in the same place.
He said that there are "so
many more important considera
tions" influencing your status
after an earthquake. He cited the
"kind of activity" going on at the
time of an earthquake as one of
the chief determining factors.
In other words, if you and your
friends are playing "Let's Stand
Under a Very Heavy Wall Hang
ing" — a favorite campus party
game — your chances of injury are
heightened.
Dear Bug,
Can you explain the Earth
quake "Buddy System ?"

— Chim Moj (Third-Year Wilbur
resident)
Dear Chim,
This system, outlined in the
University pamphlet "Be Quake
Safe," envisions students pairing
up to help each other in case of
emergency The plan of pairing in
case of flood by broken water pipe,
which calls to mind the days of
Noah and his ark, is yet another
example of how the Bible influ
ences University policy.

Dating, by the way, has picked
up at Stanford since the Univer
sity instituted the mandatory
Buddy System. Check the "Be
Quake Safe" pamphlet for more
details on how to ask someone to
be your "buddy."
Dear Bug,
Who is Loma Prieta, and why
is the 1989 earthquake named
after her?
—Pem Stevenson
Dear Pem,
Before heavily researching
your question, I assumed that
Loma was probably some luckless
woman whose parents really
wanted to call her Lola, but signed

her birth certificate wrong. (Kind
of like how your parents may have
meant to name you Pam.)
Anyway, I figured, Loma's
home must have been directly
above the epicenter of the earth
quake.
While my conjecture sounds
entirely credible, it turns out to be
all wrong. A true disappointment
for those of us who were starting
to feel very close to Loma Prieta,
the woman. Loma Prieta is actu
ally a region, through which the
San Andreas fault runs.
Then I discovered that, in
Spanish, Loma means "small
hill." Prieta can mean either
black, tight, compact, swarthy or
dark-complexioned, allowing for a
variety of interpretations.
I prefer to translate Prieta as
"dark-complexioned" because it
reminds me of Loma Prieta, the
woman I once believed existed.
The Bug needs more QUES
TIONS!!! This week, in honor of
the upcoming holiday, I am field
ing Halloween questions, as well
as general queries.
If you write to me at my e-mail
account (b.bug on macbeth), I
guarantee you a personal
response and possible publication
in the Daily. Questions may also
be dropped in the Daily's Bug
mailbox.
Quite a controversy developed
on the question of stoking, raised
in last week's Bug. It turns out
many people, mostly from South
ern California do indeed say I'm
stoked," but the BUG still refuses
to endorse this usage. Signing off
until next Friday. ..
