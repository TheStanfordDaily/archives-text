# When the next one hits, don't call home

It was a vaguely familiar quivering
sensation that awoke me at 6:45 on
the morning of September 23.
As I skidded back and forth on my
sheetless mattress (having never
ordered ASSU linen) and drowsily
watched the window frames waver, 1
thought of what an appropriate wel
come this was.
I had arrived at Stanford the night
before, following a six-day drive from
Washington, D.C. After a summer on
the East Coast, I had almost forgotten
what an earthquake feels like.
Naturally the first thing I did when
the trembling stopped was to call
home and nonchalantly mention to
my mother that there had been a
tremor moments before.
When I decided to apply to colleges
in California, my mother stayed calm.
In fact, my father kept mentioning
Georgetown University, two miles
from our house.
Eventually they both resigned
themselves to sending their daughter
to school 2,418 miles from home,
although my father still sends me
notes asking, "Do you ever study out
there?"
For my parents, it started to hurt
on Oct. 17, 1989. Suddenly my ratio

nal, calm mother panicked. She stayed
up all night. She waited for the phone
to ring while talking on the other line.
She called every friend and relation
who owned a telephone. Our relatives
in Venice must have heard about the
earthquake before Italian news ser
vices.
When she visited me last spring,
she was intent on seeing any damage,
from cracks in Columbae to wooden
arch supports in the quad.
Because she had attended informa
tion sessions for Stanford parents in
Washington, she knew more earth
quake stories than I did. She could
pinpoint the epicenter and cite statis
tics for future quakes.
But my mother is not the only par
ent to suddenly become a seismic
expert. Mrs. Crocker, whose three
daughters attend Stanford, has devel
oped a superb sensitivity to earth
quakes. Sophomore Rennie Crocker
says that when they walk around cam
pus, her mother feels tremors imper
ceptible to anyone else. She'll say "Did
you feel that? It was at least a 1.2!"
Even parents of future Stanford
students must have been worried by
the quake. There was a 13 percent
drop in undergraduate applications
last year, and a lower attrition rate
than usual, especially among appli

cants from the East Coast.
This summer I found out that my
little brother has been informally for
bidden to apply to Stanford or Berke
ley by my normally libertarian par
ents.
On the other hand, junior John
MacKenzie's parents "weren't con
cerned at ail" when he called in the
middle of the night to assure them
that he wasn't in danger. But he lives
in Colorado.
A senior said that his call woke his
parents, who weren't worried. His
parents telephoned his girlfriend's
parents, waking them. They weren't
aware that there had been an earth
quake. All those parents live in Illi
nois.
Is it because the East Coast is more
than 2,500 miles from Stanford that
parents living there worry more?
In my opinion, the buses and sub
way trains that rumble by our flimsy
house in Washington are practically as
threatening as earthquakes here.
Buses pass my house 20 times a day.
And no one worried about my safety
last winter when I was standing by a
glass storefront in Washington's
Union Station. A train passing over
head rattled the panes. Why are my
parents worried about earthquakes at
Stanford?
