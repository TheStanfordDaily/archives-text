## Pro salaries are in line 
### 
Last weekend, there was a little blurb in
the paper about NBA star Clyde
Drexler's new contract. It is a multi-year
deal, and it tops off at $8 million for the 1996
season.
"Hold on now," I heard several people
scream, "Eight million dollars?! That s just
insane. Now things are really out of control.
It's entirely too much for a guy like that to be
making."
On hearing a complaint such as this, one
needs to break down tne reasons for the indig
nation. In most cases, I find, the ranting is
unjustified. Professional athletes deserve
whatever they receive in terms of compensa
tion.

The first reason that folks get so up in arms
over player salaries is the sheer size of the con
tracts, which are now stretching into the tens
of millions of dollars over several years (for the
top athletes in the meyor sports). However,
when you consider that the owners and front
office fat cats are pulling down much more
than that in most cases, the salaries don't
seem so high.
No athlete, for instance, can be found in the
recentlv-published Fortune 500 of individuals.
Several owners of professional franchises can.
These are men who are worth hundreds of mil
lions of dollars, which is in a whole different
range than the athletes.
The second-most heard complaint is that no
one should be making that much money just
for bouncing/throwing/running with a ball.
Well, truthfully, it's not as easy as that. Profes
sional athletes have devoted their lives to
building their bodies up to an incredible level
of performance. They train year-round for sev
eral hours a day with sophisticated training
methods to keep themselves in this shape.
Well, sure, you say, but I'd trade places with
them any day. Of course you would, but you
can't. It takes a lot of natural talent and work
your-butt-off determination to make it to the
top of these professions.
And that s another thing that should be
considered. Players in the NBA, NFL, and
Mqjor League Baseball have made it to the pin
nacle league of their sports.
When you make it to high management in
any other business, you are paid accordingly.
The same goes for sports. Minor league base
ball and CBA basketball players, on the other
hand, are riding in buses and just barely get
ting by.
