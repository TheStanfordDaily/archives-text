# Whitfield trying to be simply the best
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The simplistic assessment of the game can be
deceiving.
While life on the offensive line may result in an
elementary approach to football, unsophisticated
does not equal unproficient.
Quite the opposite, actually.
Offensive tackle Bob Whitfield is one of the most
talented players to suit up in cardinal and white.
Ever.
Whitfield may see the game from the angle of
"make a hole" or "stop that guy," but Stanford sees
success behind the broad back of the second-year
player.
"Our (offensive line) goal is to get three yards a
run, three yards a run, and four yards a pass, every
series," Whitfield said. "If he (coach Denny Green)
calls a running play, it's my job to make sure the run
ner gets three yards."
Simplistic yes. But potential isn't measured by
position.
Fighting in the trenches may not be acknowl
edged as the treasure chest of college football, but
Whitfield is the jewel of the 1989 recruiting class.
And of the Stanford line.
As a true sophomore, the 6-foot-7, 300-pound
player is already among the nation's best at his posi
tion. And is only getting better.
"He's outstanding," said Green. "He has great
quickness, and he plays hard. He plays when he's
hurt, he plays with a high level of intensity, and he's
been very productive.
"I think he can be the best lineman in the country,
given time. He's one of the best right now, and he's
only 18. Most players you talk about are 22, 23.
That's what really makes him an extrodinary
player."
As a true freshman, Whitfield earned second
team all-Pacific 10 Conference honors and was given
Stanford's Iron Man Award for playing every single
down.
Expectations were even higher this year for the
big man on the left. He was labeled a preseason All-
American by a number of publications, was named
the sixth-best offensive lineman in the country by
The Sporting News, and was the player highlighted
by Sports Illustrated in the Pac-10 preview story.
The left tackle hasn't let his supporters down.
"We expected big things out of Bob, and he has
lived up to those expectations," said offensive coordi
nator Ron Turner. "He impacts the other guys (on
the line) with his performance. He's very young but
he's already learning the work habits it takes to be a
great player."
"He's been playing real well. He's been banged up
a bit but he's been doing a great job of protecting
that left side," Green said. "Obviously we run behind
him and Brian Cassidy in those short yardage situa
tions which has enabled us to be one of the best
short-yardage goal-line teams in the entire country."
The amount of pressure on such a young player
might disrupt the concentration of less motivated
athletes. It doesn't affect Whitfield.
He thrives under the spotlight.
"He likes that kind of pressure because he has the
same kind of expectations for himself," Turner said.
"Everybody wants to see if you're on top of every
thing," Whitfield said. "I'm human, I can get beat —
someone has to get beat. If I do, I'm still going to
come back next week and do some damage."
In fact, Whitfield has higher expectations for him
self than his coaches and the media do.
"I want to be No. 1 in the country because I can

play hard every down, every Saturday. You can be
ranked, a lot of people can hype you up, but if you
can't go out every Saturday and play hard you're not
really anything," Whitfield said.
This driveness, this sense of a mission is what
helps lift the sophomore from Carson, Calif, onto a
different level.
While other players play to get the job done, Whit
field strives for perfection.
This aspect, however, has left him disappointed
with his season thus far.
Although coaches and peers have nothing but
praise for the intense, yet extremely friendly player,
Whitfield finds fault.
"I didn't start the season well. I played average,
wishy-washy ball," Whitfield said. "I've been picking
it up the last two games, but two games aren't
enough. I feel like I've let the team down so far.
"Physically I've been prepared but a lot of mental
lapses have brought my game down."
His coaches, however, can't seem to find as many
problems with his play. Whitfield has once again
played in every down this year, except for the fourth
quarter of the Oregon State contest when starters
were given a rest.
"Against San Jose State his play wasn't as sharp
(as usual) and he still wasn't terrible. He just has
such high expectations that if he doesn't play great
he's disappointed," Turner said.
"He struggled a little early but he's playing real
good football now," said fellow offensive lineman
Chuck Gillingham. "His pass blocking has really
improved and he's driving well in run blocking. He's
playing into his size."
Expectations aside, what is a player of Whitfield's
caliber doing on the Farm — not exactly a football
powerhouse? The Banning High graduate was

labeled one of, if not the, top recruit in the country.
He was an Ail-American on every publiations' list.
He led his team to the Los Angeles city finals.
Why Stanford over Notre Dame, Miami or UCLA?
"My family and I did a lot of thinking, and I fig
ured this would be the best place for me," he said. "I
always think a team has room for improvement. I
