# Football vs. Washington
## 
### 
TOMORROW — TV: ABC split-national broadcast with
Brent Musburger and Dick Vermeil Radio: KZSU
(90.1 FM), KCBS (740 AM). 12:37 p.m. kickoff at
Stanford Stadium.
RECORDS — Stanford (2-4, 1-3 in Pac-10 play), Wash
ington (5-1, 3-0 and first in the Pac-10).
MATCHUP — Washington is flying high. Coming off
a route of Oregon, they are heading to the Rose
Bowl. They can't, however, affort any conference
losses since three teams are hanging on their tail.
Stanford, loaded with potential, is coming off yet
another disappointing loss. This might just be the
week. The Cardinal matches up well with the Huskies:
they like to run. Stanford has proved it can actually
stop the run. Even on third down Washington does,
however, have one of the best defenses in the nation.
FEATURING — Quarterback Jason Palumbis is coming
off some of the best games of his life. Wide receiver
Ed McCaffrey is equally hot, leading the nation in
receptions per game Glyn Milburn has had trouble
the past two weeks establishing the run, but this
might be the rebound week. The Huskies feature
running back Greg Lewis, who is leading the Pac-10
and is third in the nation in yardage. He has yet to
have a sub-100-yard game this season.
