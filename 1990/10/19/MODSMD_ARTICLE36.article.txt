# Stanford tunes up for No. 1 Bruins by beating USC
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
USC may not be Nebraska, but
they're no pushover either.
Despite a disappointing season,
unranked and unheralded Southern Cal
managed to fight the high-flying Cardi
nal hard last night at North Gym. But
after capturing the first game, the Tro
jans came undone allowing No. 5 Stan
ford to emerge, 10-15, 15-8, 15-10, 15-
10.
"This was a good win," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said. "USC played
great. We were a little sluggish and they
played very aggressively."
The Trojans certainly had something
to prove. USC suffered a lopsided loss to
Stanford a month ago at Burnham
Pavilion thanks to abysmal individual
performances. But seniors Lonise Nor
fleet and Megan McCallister rebounded
yesterday to charge the Trojans on a
powerful first-game run.
"They played really well," Stanford
setter Carrie Feldman said. "They
didn't play like that when they came up
here. They always get pumped up to

Cardinal 3

Trojans 1

play us."
Stephanie Bodison led the way for
USC. The little-known middle blocker
suddenly became a big part of the Tro
jan attack, killing 18 balls and hitting
.429 on the night. She and Norfleet
helped the Trojans outhit Stanford .292
to .106 in the first game.
Shaw, however, did everything but hit
the panic button when Southern Cal jet
tisoned ahead. Even though Stanford
had not lost a single game in six previ
ous matches, Shaw felt the Cardinal was
still in control.
"They jumped on us early," Shaw
said. "But I thought we were passing
the ball well and we just kept siding
out."
And when Stanford sides out, good
things tend to happen. As is customary,
those good things came in the form of
Amy Cooper and Bev Oden.
Cooper, who has become a one-person
offensive wrecking crew, contributed
another spectacular performance. The
6-foot-2 middle blocker recorded 12
kills, three blocks and a .380 hitting per
centage. In her last six matches, Cooper
has hit over .600 and has 58 kills.
Sophomore Oden is making a mock
ery of every defense in the nation. The
Irvine, Calif, hitter pounded down 21
kills, blocked four attacks and hit .463.
She now has 261 kills and 86 blocks on
the year.
"Bev and Amy were unstoppable
again," Shaw said. "Bev hit from all the
different positions on the court and
Amy hit from the middle. We relied on
them a lot."
Meanwhile, the Trojans started get
ting hasty. Intent on making or break
ing it, USC unleashed the brunt of its
offensive power. Trojan coach Lisa Love
seemed to give her players a permanent
green light to swing away.
They took kindly to the offer. Hard
hitting Norfleet and McCallister swung
viciously at the ball, sometimes connect
ing for kills, but often committing hor
rid errors.

"USC had some huge kills, it was
scary," Shaw said. "But sometimes it
was a matter of us getting out of the way
before the ball hit the walls."
The Trojans indeed committed 31
total attack errors, self-destructing in
frantic attempts to get ahead. "We just
let them make the mistakes," Feldman
said.
Despite recording fewer blocks and
digs, the Cardinal sped ahead in the
remaining three games. The team fin
ished with a .248 hitting percentage and
eight service aces. Junior co-captain
Kristin Klein helped in the squad's
resurgence by posting 14 kills on the
night.
Sophomore Kathy Jurgens has
become something of a defensive phe
nom. The 5-foot-8 Riverside, 111. product
had eight digs and three aces in limited
backrow play. Junior hitter Jennifer
Jackson also shined, leading the team in
digs with 16.
"It was a good all-around effort,"
Shaw said. "We accomplished what we
set out to do."
The Cardinal is currently on a fiery
eight-match win streak. Last night was
the first time in the last six matches
that Stanford had actaully lost a game.
During this run, the squad has
defeated No. 2 Nebraska and has lost
only three games. All season long, the
Cardinal has been pushed to five games
only once.
The Bruins loom ominously on the
horizon, however. UCLA, whom Stan
ford will play tonight, was the team that
ended Stanford's last streak, a 6-0 sea
son start. "They're going to know us
well," Shaw said. "I expect them to play
well. We're just going to have to play
harder and execute better."
Stanford will likely not catch the
Bruins off guard. After seeing No. 2
Nebraska fall in three straight games in
Maples Pavilion, UCLA will be wary of
the Cardinal attack.
UCLA this week moved firmly to the
top of both the Tachikara Coaches' poll
and the NCAA poll. The team nas

an early-season loss to Nebraska.
While the Bruins have looked
unimpressive against some of its
lesser opponents, UCLA has
always managed to play well
against the Cardinal. UCLA
downed Stanford handily Sept. 22
despite a 29-kill, 22-dig perfor
mance by Oden.
"We have to play like we know
we can," Feldman said. "We can't
just freak out."
The match takes on added
meaning beacuse it will probably

Should UCLA win, the team
will virtually lock up a first-place
finish and will have first say as to
the location of the playoffs.
If Stanford wins, that contest
would remain wide open. At the
moment, there are no other
teams close to UCLA and Stan
ford in the conference.

USC may not be Nebraska, but
they're no pushover either.
Despite a disappointing season,
unranked and unheralded Southern Cal
managed to fight the high-flying Cardi
nal hard last night at North Gym. But
after capturing the first game, the Tro
jans came undone allowing No. 5 Stan
ford to emerge, 10-15, 15-8, 15-10, 15-
10.
"This was a good win," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said. "USC played
great. We were a little sluggish and they
played very aggressively."
The Trojans certainly had something
to prove. USC suffered a lopsided loss to
Stanford a month ago at Burnham
Pavilion thanks to abysmal individual
performances. But seniors Lonise Nor
fleet and Megan McCallister rebounded
yesterday to charge the Trojans on a
powerful first-game run.
"They played really well," Stanford
setter Carrie Feldman said. "They
didn't play like that when they came up
here. They always get pumped up to

Cardinal 3

Trojans 1

play us."
Stephanie Bodison led the way for
USC. The little-known middle blocker
suddenly became a big part of the Tro
jan attack, killing 18 balls and hitting
.429 on the night. She and Norfleet
helped the Trojans outhit Stanford .292
to .106 in the first game.
Shaw, however, did everything but hit
the panic button when Southern Cal jet
tisoned ahead. Even though Stanford
had not lost a single game in six previ
ous matches, Shaw felt the Cardinal was
still in control.
"They jumped on us early," Shaw
said. "But I thought we were passing
the ball well and we just kept siding
out."
And when Stanford sides out, good
things tend to happen. As is customary,
those good things came in the form of
Amy Cooper and Bev Oden.
Cooper, who has become a one-person
offensive wrecking crew, contributed
another spectacular performance. The
6-foot-2 middle blocker recorded 12
kills, three blocks and a .380 hitting per
centage. In her last six matches, Cooper
has hit over .600 and has 58 kills.
Sophomore Oden is making a mock
ery of every defense in the nation. The
Irvine, Calif, hitter pounded down 21
kills, blocked four attacks and hit .463.
She now has 261 kills and 86 blocks on
the year.
"Bev and Amy were unstoppable
again," Shaw said. "Bev hit from all the
different positions on the court and
Amy hit from the middle. We relied on
them a lot."
Meanwhile, the Trojans started get
ting hasty. Intent on making or break
ing it, USC unleashed the brunt of its
offensive power. Trojan coach Lisa Love
seemed to give her players a permanent
green light to swing away.
They took kindly to the offer. Hard
hitting Norfleet and McCallister swung
viciously at the ball, sometimes connect
ing for kills, but often committing hor
rid errors.

"USC had some huge kills, it was
scary," Shaw said. "But sometimes it
was a matter of us getting out of the way
before the ball hit the walls."
The Trojans indeed committed 31
total attack errors, self-destructing in
frantic attempts to get ahead. "We just
let them make the mistakes," Feldman
said.
Despite recording fewer blocks and
digs, the Cardinal sped ahead in the
remaining three games. The team fin
ished with a .248 hitting percentage and
eight service aces. Junior co-captain
Kristin Klein helped in the squad's
resurgence by posting 14 kills on the
night.
Sophomore Kathy Jurgens has
become something of a defensive phe
nom. The 5-foot-8 Riverside, 111. product
had eight digs and three aces in limited
backrow play. Junior hitter Jennifer
Jackson also shined, leading the team in
digs with 16.
"It was a good all-around effort,"
Shaw said. "We accomplished what we
set out to do."
The Cardinal is currently on a fiery
eight-match win streak. Last night was
the first time in the last six matches
that Stanford had actaully lost a game.
During this run, the squad has
defeated No. 2 Nebraska and has lost
only three games. All season long, the
Cardinal has been pushed to five games
only once.
The Bruins loom ominously on the
horizon, however. UCLA, whom Stan
ford will play tonight, was the team that
ended Stanford's last streak, a 6-0 sea
son start. "They're going to know us
well," Shaw said. "I expect them to play
well. We're just going to have to play
harder and execute better."
Stanford will likely not catch the
Bruins off guard. After seeing No. 2
Nebraska fall in three straight games in
Maples Pavilion, UCLA will be wary of
the Cardinal attack.

top of both the Tachikara Coaches' poll
and the NCAA poll. The team nas

an early-season loss to Nebraska.
While the Bruins have looked
unimpressive against some of its
lesser opponents, UCLA has
always managed to play well
against the Cardinal. UCLA
downed Stanford handily Sept. 22
despite a 29-kill, 22-dig perfor
mance by Oden.
"We have to play like we know
we can," Feldman said. "We can't
just freak out."
The match takes on added
meaning beacuse it will probably

Should UCLA win, the team
will virtually lock up a first-place
finish and will have first say as to
the location of the playoffs.
If Stanford wins, that contest
would remain wide open. At the
moment, there are no other
teams close to UCLA and Stan
