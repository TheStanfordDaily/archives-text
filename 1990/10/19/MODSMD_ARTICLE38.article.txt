# Sophomore set to show Stanford soccer's shining bright
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Julie Foudy is a sweet shooter
on the soccer field, but when she
returns to North Carolina this
weekend she will be dumping salt
into some open wounds.
And it won't be the last time.
Stanford embarks on a two
game swing to No. 12 Duke and
No. 7 North Carolina State, and
for Stanford's sensational sopho
more midfielder it's a chance to
show the Tarheel state what it's
missing.

When Foudy, now a superstar
sophomore, was the nation's most
sought-after women's soccer
recruit, she visited North Car
olina when the Tarheels were
playing in the Final Four.
Foudy will be watching the No.
3 Tarheels again this weekend
against No. 1 Virginia, but this
time it isn't the only game in
town. The eyes of the soccer estab
lishment will be watching Foudy
and the No. 9 Cardinal as they
seek their first-ever NCAA tour
nament berth.
"Now we have the potential to

be national champions," Foudy
said. "It's not we're going to be
good, we are good now."
And one of the reasons Stan
ford has transformed from a
mediocre team to a national con
tender is the recruiting of coach
Berhane Andeberhan. Starting
with sweeper Heather Mclntyre,
and following with Foudy and
freshman Sarah Rafanelli, Ande
berhan has been catching the
biggest fish in the recruiting net
— even though Stanford has no
scholarships for women's soccer.
Stanford snatched Foudy away

from North Carolina — a team
that dominated women's soccer in
the 1980's and has eight women's
soccer scholarships — and held on
tight.
"It came down to the deadline
between North Carolina and
here," said Foudy, from Laguna
Niguel, Calif. "I had a really good
time there, but I talked it over
with my family and I really
wanted to come here."
"They dined her through the
midnight hour," said Andeberhan.
"I left for Europe on Thursday
(coaching a junior national team)
and for five hours Friday he was
meeting with her family. There
were all sorts of overt and covert
promises about her position on
the national team."
"And of course he kept men
tioning the financial burden on
the family," said Andeberhan.
The"he" Andeberhan refers to
is North Carolina and U.S.
National coach Anson Dorrance.
Dorrance and Andeberhan will be
in a recruiting duel again this
weekend. Two top recruits from
California — both heavily
recruited by Stanford — will be in
North Carolina watching the
Tarheels. But a pair of Stanford
wins might persuade them to fol
low Foudy's bold trail.
"They are extremely valuable. I
scouted them and he recruits
them," said Andeberhan.
"He (Dorrance) gets every
recruit he goes for — or at least he
did. The top-notch players mostly
went there," Foudy said. "I
wanted to take a chance and be
the one to make an impact at a dif
ferent school."
Foudy's impact at Stanford has
left a moon-sized crater in the soc
cer program that will never be
replaced. The 5-foot-6 midfielder
was named Stanford's Freshman
Athlete of the Year after leading
the team in scoring, and she has
led the Stanford team in only one
direction this season: the NCAA
playoffs.
"First we want to get to the
playoffs, then we can go from
there," she said. "We've come so
far — I'm totally pleased."
Last year Stanford narrowly
missed the playoffs with an 11-4-3
record. This year Stanford (12-2-

1) has fared better against top-10
competition and Foudy has been a
big reason why, scoring key goals
against No. 6 Colorado College,
Santa Clara, St. Mary's and Cali
fornia.
"This year we have come so
much farther and we have finally
put it together," she said. "Last
year we couldn't get that extra
goal in the big games, but this
year we are better."
But the biggest games on Stan
ford schedule loom this weekend
and in the playoffs. Should Stan
ford make it, Foudy relishes a
prospective first-round match
with either Santa Clara or UC-
Santa Barbara, the two teams
that have defeated Stanford this
year.
"If we were to go — and you
hate to say this — but I would love
to play them again, especially
Santa Clara," said Foudy, who
scored Stanford's only goal in a
frustrating 2-1 loss to the then
top-ranked Broncos, but was
silenced in a 1-0 loss to No. 5
Santa Barbara.
This weekend, North Carolina
State, ranked No. 7 nationally,
will be the tougher of the two
opponents. The Wolfpack plays a
4-4-3 alignment with Canadian
National Team player Fabienne
Gareau (11 goals, five assists) at
forward. The Wolfpack is a pun
ishing physical team, but Foudy is
familiar with being the target of a
defense and doesn't shy away
from contact.
"I don't mind teams that play
rough," said Foudy. "A lot of times
they don't have the technical
skills and they are easy to disrupt.
We do well against those teams."
Duke, ranked No. 12, has fallen
on losing times of late and is less
physical than N.C. State. "Duke is
a very hard working team, they
are similar to us. I think we may
have an advantage," said Ande
berhan. "Either they may be
really hungry now or they may be
down a lot."
"I've been trying to think dis
passionately about the playoffs,"
said Andeberhan. "I felt a split of
the four games would put us in a
good position and we've already
come close to that. If we beat N.C.
State then we would really solidify

our position."
In two critical games at Mal
oney Field this week, Stanford
tied No. 6 Colorado College 1-1
and edged No. 7 William and Mary
1-0. Poudy scored Stanford's goal
against Colorado College with an
unassisted shot from the corner
that twisted into the top of the
net. It was her team-leading 11th
goal of the season after topping
the squad in points as a freshman
with 12 goals and 10 assists.
Stanford has only one more
game after the two-game trip r a
home game with the University of
San Francisco, Oct. 27. Playoff
seedings are announced Oct. 29,
and Stanford will be listening
closely.
But the sweetest news for the
women's soccer team is that
Foudy will be back for two more
years. And as Stanford asserts
itself near the top of the soccer
pack, Foudy will have ample
opportunity to inflict much bitter
ness on the old Atlantic soccer
powers.
Card notes
Foudy hasn't attained the popular
ity of slugger Jose Canseco, but
teammates are encouraging her to get
her own 900-phone line. But not so
fans can call in and see what she had
for lunch. This one is so fans can call
in their votes on whether Foudy
should cut her shaggy-brown mane.

After being named the Los Angeles Times high school Player of the Decade, Julie Foudy didn't take
long to adapt to collegiate soccer. Foudy will lead the No. 9 Cardinal against ACC powers Duke and
North Carolina State this weekend In the Tarheel state.
