# Rosse: Stanford won't collect money it says government owes
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The University has no intention of try
ing to collect the $13 million it believes the
government owes Stanford for under-recov
ery of indirect costs during the last decade,
according to Provost James Rosse.
Rosse said the University will not try to
claim the $13 million because doing so
would cause Stanford's indirect cost rate —
already among the highest in the nation —
to jump several more points, seriously
endangering Stanford's ability to compete
with other schools for federal research
money.
The negative effects of an even higher
indirect cost rate, Rosse said, don't out
weigh the benefit of collecting the $13 mil
lion."The cost of having it is too high," he
said.
Indirect costs are those charges incurred
by researchers but not attributable to a spe
cific project. The U.S. government reim
burses Stanford for indirect costs of feder
ally sponsored research here.
Stanford's indirect cost practices are
currently under investigation by two fed
eral agencies, with some regulators saying

the University has overbilled the govern
ment by as much as $300 million over the
last decade.
But an internal audit of the University's
indirect cost practices released Wednesday
concluded Stanford had generally under
recovered during the period in question,
with a resulting $13 million that remains
unrecovered from the government.
Negotiations between Stanford and the
government are carried out under a system
in which over-recoveries and under-recov
eries for any one year are carried over to
future years.
If Stanford has under-recovered, several
percentage points would be added to its
indirect cost rate in upcoming years to
make up for the shortfall.
Last spring, the University announced it
would cap its indirect cost rate at 78 per
cent in an effort to keep the rates from spi
raling out of control and endangering the
Stanford's ability to compete for research
grants.
Collecting the $13 million would have
pushed the University's indirect cost rate
up to 84 percent within the next few years,

Over the last two decades, Stanford's Indirect cost rate has splraled upward, mostly the result of Increased space-relat
ed expenses. The University has Imposed a cap of 78 percent for fiscal year 1991 and beyond. Due In large part to the
cap, Stanford has slowed Its Near West Campus building schedule. Furthermore, the University has Indicated it will not
seek the $13 million It says the government owes It for under-recovery during the past decade. Were Stanford to recov
er the money and continue building Near West as originally Intended, the Indirect cost rate would have lumped to 84 per
cent within a few years.
