# Men's golf opens home season
## 
### Noah Blake 
Have you ever been to a golf
tournament? Do you think that
golf is boring? Well, this week
end the Stanford Cardinal Invi
tational, a 54-hole tournament,
could change your views.
The 21-team tournament is
being held today and tomorrow
at the Stanford Golf Course.
Check it out.
The Cardinal will have a
young but highly competitive
squad out on the tee at 7:30 this
morning for 36 holes of play.
They should finish around six
this evening and play 18 holes
between 7:30 a.m. and 12:30
p.m. tomorrow.
Stanford coach Wally Good
win will turn David Rutkowsky,
Mike Milliken, Casey Martin,
Notah Begay and Brad Lan
ning, playing positions one
through five respectively, loose
on their home course with the
feeling that "we'll be a force."
This tournament is very
important because early results

have much greater influence on
regular-season rankings than
do the preseason rankings. A
good showing by the Cardinal
against such top competition as
California, Cal State-
Northridge, Rice and North
western will also boost the
team's confidence, a valuable
asset over the long season.
However, this squad of two
sophomores and three fresh
man will be missing the services
of junior Christian Cevaer, who
has gone to New Zealand to rep
resent his home country,
France, in the World Amateur
Championships.
In Goodwin's opinion,
Cevaer's absence won't stop the
Cardinal. "I've got some very
competitive kids who will play
as hard as they can on every
hole."
Of course, it can't hurt to
play on your home course. The
Stanford squad will have the
advantage of not having to learn
the course as they play the first
round and thus will be able to

pick up some early shots that
could pay off in the end. Good
win is worried, however, that
the increased expectations that
come with playing at home
might negate this advantage.
The difficulty of the course
as determined by the pin place
ments will increase from today
to tomorrow, as Goodwin and
tournament organizers "want
to allow the better teams to step
forward."
All rounds have a shotgun
start, so instead of having
everyone tee off from the first
and 10th holes, the course will
be filled with golfers from
beginning to end. This type of
start insures quicker rounds
and is necessary for such a large
tournament.
What a deal! You get to follow
the players around instead of
sitting in the gallery, you don't
have to pay anything (save
those laundry quarters), and
you still can catch the football
game. Check it out. You might
even have some fun.
