# Stanford plays two in Seattle
## Star scorer making a mark with defense 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Question: can you begin a soccer career
when you yourself are barely bigger than a
soccer ball?
Answer: Yes, if you're Rhett Harty.
Harty, a junior fullback for the surprisingly
successful 1990 men's soccer team, played his
first organized soccer at age five. "My dad had
to lie a little to get me into a soccer league at
that age," he said.
Fifteen years later, the Whittier, Calif.,
native has led the Cardinal booters to a posi
tion where they can challenge for an NCAA
tournament berth. After spearheading the
Cardinal offense for two years, Harty has now
become the backbone of Stanford's formidable
defense.
This is not to say that this season has been
Harty's first opportunity to receive attention
from the soccer world. In high school, he led
his team to the final eight in the California
state championships and was recruited by
countless schools, among them Virginia, a
Crennial power which won the NCAA title
»t year.
"A lot of people thought I was crazy not to
go to Virginia," Harty said. "But, you can't
pass up an opportunity to go to Stanford."
It is obvious that Virginia was justified in
their attempts to snare Harty. His ability still
shines long after he left the high school ranks.
His great play for the Cardinal led to an offer
by the San Francisco Blackhawks, a profes
sional soccer team, last summer. Harty turned
them down to continue playing for Stanford,
where he was transplanted from his usual
midfleld position to fullback this season.
"The transition was not as big a deal as it
might seem," Harty said of the switch in posi
tion. "I played fullback this summer for the
under-23 National Team, so I feel right at
home playing defense." The under-23 team,
which consists of the top 18 American players,
will become the U.S. Olympic team in 1992.
Yes, the Olympics.
A quick look at the statistic charts may
leave some less-than-knowledgeable people
wondering why Rhett Harty was singled out

for this honor. After leading the team in scor
ing in each of his first two years on the Farm,
Harty's goal and assist statistics have dipped
with his move to the fullback position. He has
one goal and two assists on the season.
Of course, the reason for this is that
Harty's function on the team is no longer to
score goals, but to prevent opponents from
doing the same. "The past couple of years, I
was the guy that people would go to when we
had a scoring chance," Harty said. "Now, my
job is to take the ball away from people, and
give the ball to either Jim (Talluto) or Lance
(Killian) when we've got an opportunity to get
a goal."
Although Harty fully enjoys his new posi
tion, he acknowledges some lack of glory that
inevitably accompanies becoming a defender.
"A lot of people who saw me playing last year
and scoring will ask me 'What happened?'"
Harty said.
Well, what happened is that the Stanford
soccer team, with Harty keeping opposing for
wards at bay, is doing far better than it has in
a long time. As the squad heads to the Pacific
Northwest this weekend for two tough
matches, the thought that is foremost in
everybody's mind was unimaginable at the
start of the season: playoffs.
"At the beginning of the year, nobody, not
even Colin (Lindores, the coach) thought we
had a chance," Harty said. "But now, we're
playing great soccer and we're all starting to
realize that we have a shot."
The Cardinal will square off against Wash
ington and Oregon State this weekend, with
the Cardinal's playoff hopes hanging in the
balance as a loss would all but eliminate Stan
ford from the playoff picture. Harty, although
wary of the team's opponents, is confident
that the team can return home with two more
W's under its belt.
"Washington's a great team. . .. They're
ranked in the top 20 nationally, and fourth in
the West," Harty said. "But I can tell that
everyone on the team is really ready to get out
there and hand them the defeat.
"Oregon State's a very new program, and
even though they've played some good soccer
on occasion, I'm sure we'll beat them." Harty

went on. "We're peaking at just the right time.
Colin has even told us, 'Hey, you guys are
really surprising me."* t
Stanford heads north coming off the team s
first three-game winning streak in well over e
year. They have outscored their opponents 14-
1 over that span, thumping San Jose State 4-0,
beating the University of Portland 2-1, and
kicking the you-know-what out of U. S. Inter
national University, 8-0.

'At the beginning of the year,
nobody, not even Colin
(Lindores, the coach) thought
we had a chance. But now,
we're playing great soccer
and we're all starting to real
ize that we have a shot.'
— Rhett Harty

"The USIU game really showed us how well
we've been playing," Harty said. "They've
played well against a couple of tough teams. ..
. I never thought we'd beat them by eight
goals."
When asked for the reasons for the team's
success, Harty was quick to move the spotlight
off himself and to credit Lindores, who has
done wonders with the team in his first year as
coach.
"What's great about Colin is that he really
knows how to deal with us," Harty saia.
"When you've done something badly, he knows
how to let you know that you've got to improve
without taking away your self confidence.
"Colin's strongest asset as a coach is his
ability to teach tactical awareness," Harty con
tinued. "That really makes the biggest differ
ence. It can take a good soccer player and make
him a great soccer player."
Or, in Harty's case, take a great soccer
player and make him a still greater one.
