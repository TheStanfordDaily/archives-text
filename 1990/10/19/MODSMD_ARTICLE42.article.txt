# Olson quietly becoming a leader in the pool
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
While the No. 3-ranked Stan
ford water polo team has been
making a lot of noise in destroying
almost every opponent this year,
isenior Greg Olson has quietly
emerged as one of the team's lead-
scorers.
In fact, after 19 games, Olson
has scored 34 goals, which ties
him for the team scoring lead with
classmate Rick McNair.
After Olson scored 24 times
last year, everyone knew he could
score, but no one thought he
would score this many goals. "I
expected a lot of production from
him," coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "But I didn't expect him to
be our leading scorer. He's reaily
been a pleasant surprise."
What has added to this surprise
is the way that the senior from
San Clemente, Calif, has suc
ceeded in scoring so many goals.
As Dettamanti said, "Greg has
quietly scored more goals than
anyone else. He isn't flamboyant
and is so unassuming that you
don't always notice what he's
doing in the pool. But when you
look at the scoring sheet at the
end of the game, it turns out that
he's scored two or three times and
is the game's leading scorer."
Indeed, it seems that the only
person who is not surprised at his
play so far is Olson himself. "I
knew I could score if I got the
chance to play a lot, and now I'm
getting this chance."

Coming out of high school,
Olson was an All-American and
was on the U.S. Junior National
Team, yet the college game
required a lot of adjustments for
the 5-foot-11 inch Olson, so he did
not see much playing time until
last year.
As Dettamanti said, "It took
him a while to make the adjust
ments, but now everything seems
to have come along. He's gotten a
lot tougher and has learned the
subtleties of the game."
Olson has been such a good stu
dent that he has emerged as one of
the Cardinal's most consistent
players and as someone who can
be counted on to score a couple of
goals each game. "I probably
won't score more than three goals
in a game," the soft-spoken Olson

said. "Yet I also probably won't
score less than one goal either."
Olson's statistics clearly reveal
this point. He has scored at least
once in 15 of the team's 19 games
and has been the leading scorer in
eight of those games.
But what is especially impres
sive about his season so far is that
he has saved his best games for
the toughest opponents. "Greg
has gotten a lot of his goals in our
most important games and has
usually been our leading scorer in
these games," Dettamanti said.
"Anyone can score against the
weaker teams, but to score against
the tougher defenses is that much
more impressive. The fact that he
has done this is a sure sign that he
has developed into an outstanding
player."
What has enabled Olson to per
form so well is primarily his
quickness in the water. "I'm not
necessarily the fastest swimmer
on the team, but in the water I'm
pretty quick and am able to make
quick moves around guys."
Familiarity with the game is
certainly not a problem of Olson's
either. The youngest of five chil
dren, Olson has been around the
game since his early childhood
and began playing water polo
when he was only nine years old.
Though most water polo players
begin swimming at an early age,
few start playing water polo
before high school, and this extra
experience seems to have benefit
ted Olson.
As Dettamanti said, "He just

has a real feel for the game. He
seems to know where everyone is
at all times and is always thinking
out there."
Since Olson is not the largest
or strongest of players, he has had
to develop other areas of his game
such as shooting, which he now
excels in."He has a knack for
shooting the ball," Dettamanti
said. "He's the best pure shooter
we have. He's not the hardest
shooter, but he has great place
ment and touch on the ball. With
his shooting ability, he can really
turn a game around and win it for
us."
But don't be surprised if he
does it quietly.
