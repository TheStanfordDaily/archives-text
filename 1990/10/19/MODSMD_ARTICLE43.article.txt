deGuerre Pool.
RECORDS - Stanford (15-4,
ranked third), UCLA (19-1, sec
ond).
NOTES â€” This is the Cardinal's
final home Pac-10 game. Stan
ford is facing a Bruin squad that
not only has the nation's best
record but also defeated the
Cardinal 12-6 earlier this year.
That was Stanford's worst loss
since 1983. Brum Stefan Pol-
Iman, a member of the German
Junior National Team, has
scored 78 goals already this
year, more than twice any Car
dinal player. Coach Dante Det
tamanti called today's matchup
the most important game of the
season for his team.
