# Shorthanded runners race at NorCal meet
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
If the Oakland A's were to
play a game without Jose
Canseco, Mark McGwire,
Rickey Henderson and Willie
Randolph, you'd probably be
right in assuming that the
game wasn't a very important
one.
The same would be true if
the 49ers decided not to start
Joe Montana, Roger Craig,
Jerry Rice and Ronnie Lott.
What conclusion, then,
would you be led to draw if the
Stanford cross country team
went to a meet without its four
best runners?
The wrong one.
As the Cardinal heads to
Crystal Springs for the NorCal
Invitational, Fred Carter,
Jason Martin, Dave Scud
amore and Gary Stok will not
be among the athletes compet
ing. As far as the team struc
ture for the upcoming champi
onship meets goes, however,
this meet will be more impor
tant than any other.
"We have 10 guys in the
running for the last three spots
in our top seven," men's cross
country coach Scott Chisam
said. "This meet will play an
enormous role in determining

our roster for future races."
After the NorCal, the
team's next contest will be the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, which will take place
Oct. 27. That race will take
place at the Stanford Golf
Course at 4 p.m.
Two weeks later comes the
District 8 meet in Fresno, Cali
fornia, and then, the NCAA
Championships Nov. 19. This
means that this weekend's
meet is essentially Chisam's
last chance to determine who
will fill the last three openings.
"Of course, if someone runs
very poorly at Pac-lOs, they
will get the hook," Chisam
said. "But I would expect the
top seven to remain the same
in all three races." This, of
course, assumes that Stanford
does qualify for nationals, a
possibility which appears more
and more likely as time goes on
and times go down.
Chisam has pulled his top
four because he has assured
them of a top-seven spot and
would rather they trained
through the race. "Barring
injury or death, Jason, Gary,
Fred and Dave are in," Chisam
said, then jokingly corrected
himself and added, "On second
thought, death is not an
excuse."
