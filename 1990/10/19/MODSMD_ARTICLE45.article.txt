# Pac-10's Tom Hansen attempts to jump-start Guest Greek

Dame and Miami. The series ends
this year because of some lame
Irish excuse about being unable to
schedule the best team in college
football over the past decade.
Auburn meets Florida State in
a game with national title implica
tions for the Tigers/War Eagles. If
Pat Dye's troops take down the
Seminoles, they will be in the
hunt for the big enchilada.
Michigan State, coming oft its
referee-aided upset of Michigan,
faces the vaunted Illinois defense
in a noteworthy Big Ten matchup.
(Note that Big Ten is spelled out
while Pac-10 is numerical. Why?
Because.)
If the Huskies (3-0 in confer
ence) fall to the Cardinal, the Big
Ten champ will likely face Cal,
UCLA or USC — each of which
has one loss. Though many of the
Greeks are picking the Bears this
week, they should note that Cal
has dropped 18 straight to the
Bruins.
A week ago this time, Oregon
State was on its way to an 0-11
season. Then they shocked
Arizona 35-21. Now they hope to
push the win streak to two by
beating Washington State.
Cameron likes the Cougars.
Smart money says take the
Beavers and the points.

Once upon a time, there was a
man named Cameron Macky. He
picked against the Cardinal, he
picked the Cardinal, he picked a
new pope — all in the name of try
ing to win the Greek.
Then, he picked against every
one. Hell, he picked Missouri to
beat Nebraska. Nobody knows
why. Except Cameron. Then
again, maybe he doesn't even
know. But we can't ask him
because he's in Los Angeles.
Why? To watch the women's
volleyball team beat UCLA. He's
picking us. Uh oh.
Tom Hansen, the Pacific 10
Conference commissioner and a
graduate of Washington, becomes
the third consecutive Guest Greek
to pick against the Cardinal. So
far, that's been a mixed proposi
tion.
Stanford has beaten the
Huskies just once in its last 11
tries dating back to the inaugura
tion of Jimmy Carter.
Washington's defense is suppos
edly pretty good, but hey, we still
beat Notre Dame.
Others games on the Greek
slate include the Catholics vs.
Convicts matchup between Notre
