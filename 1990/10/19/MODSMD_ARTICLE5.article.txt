# RAs voice concern over alcohol policy
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Stanford has a long way to go
before deciding how to implement
and enforce its new alcohol policy,
if yesterday's meeting between
Acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson and residence
staff is any indication.
A procedure for implementing
the new University alcohol policy
will not be ready until at least Dec.
3 and will not be enforced until
winter quarter, Robinson said.
To maintain eligibility for mil
lions of dollars in federal funding,
Stanford introduced a policy Oct.
1 that prohibits the unlawful use
or possession of alcohol on cam
pus.
While the University's policy
now meets federal requirements,
implementation and enforcement
procedures have yet to be man
dated.
Robinson said he wanted to get
"the best possible suggestions
from the widest possible audi
ence," but resident fellows and
assistants voiced more frustra
tions than solutions.
Roble Hall RF Rob Robinson
expressed disapproval of both the
new policy and state drinking
laws.
"The state law is not a good
law," he said. "It drives drinking

underground. A bad law has now
become a bad policy."
Several RAs voiced fears that
they would be expected to police
underage drinking. Kristin
Kuntz, an RAin Eucalypto, said
she "would fight tooth and nail" if
asked to enforce the alcohol policy.
Many residence staff members
felt the new policy creates a para
dox that forbids them from pur
chasing alcohol with dorm funds,
yet encourages underage resi
dents to drink in private, poten
tially dangerous situations.
"If we're abiding by the laws of
University policy," Cedro RA Jenn
Allison said, "I don't see how we
can go on spending house funds
on alcohol."
Yet as ZAP RA Merrill Langfitt
said, "I feel very strongly that if
we go to really strong policy mea
sures, it's going to drive people
off-campus, behind doors. It's
going to make things much
worse."
"We're more than educators,
we're also caretakers," said Todd
Ortega, another Cedro RA. He
argued that a stringent alcohol
policy could "damage severely my
relationship with my frosh."
Kuntz said, "It's impossible to
support the use of dorm funds to
purchase alcohol" in lieu of the
new policy, adding that if RAs
must enforce it, "people will hide
from their RAs" to drink.
"I find it scary to lose the con
trol and openness with drinking
we have now," Madera RA Ellen
Schur said.
Robinson assured RAs and RFs
that while "it's up to the Univer
sity to enforce its own policy,
we're not asking you to report
people."
"I have complete faith in our
ability to leave the maximum
responsibility with individual stu
dents and student groups," Robin
son said. "We are educators. We're
not regulators, enforcers or police.
We need to keep those perspec
tives in mind."
Several RAs said they worried
that the new policy could increase
their liability if an underage
drinker gets hurt at a party under
the RA's supervision.
Robinson responded that con
cern about the health and safety
of residents, not RA liability,
should be "the driving force."
Others wondered if residence
staff members would be obligated
to report all underage drinkers
they catch.
"Is there some way Stanford
can prove its accountability to the
federal government without using
numbers [of write-ups]?" one RA
asked.
In addition, some RAs were
frustrated by the lack of guide

lines as to how they should
enforce the new policy before for
mal solutions are reached.
"No one's told us what our role
is going to be," Whitman RA Beth
Davidow echoed.
Despite an atmosphere of anxi
ety and frustration, a few RAs and
RFs offered suggestions on how to
enforce the new policy.
Veronica Gomez, an RAin
Toyon Hall, suggested an enforce
ment policy whereby RAs would
report underage drinkers only in
connection with another viola
tion,
Instead of inflicting punish
ment on underage drinkers,
Kuntz said they should be given
"increased education" on the risks
of alcohol.
However, for the most part,
those who attended thought the
meeting failed to adequately
address the issues at hand. "I
don't feel like anything got
resolved today," Allison said.
"People aren't suggesting
things, they're still saying this is a
bad policy, but not how we can live
with this policy," Davidow said.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Diana Conklin and Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson will be taking comments
and suggestions from concerned
students and faculty until Oct. 29.
They plan to issue a draft pro
posal outlining execution and
sanctioning procedures of the new
policy Nov. 9.
After that, they will hold open
meetings with the community
before submitting a final draft to
Robinson Dec. 3.
