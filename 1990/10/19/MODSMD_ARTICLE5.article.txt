# RAs voice concern over alcohol policy
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Stanford has a long way to go
before deciding how to implement
and enforce its new alcohol policy,
if yesterday's meeting between
Acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson and residence
staff is any indication.
A procedure for implementing
the new University alcohol policy
will not be ready until at least Dec.
3 and will not be enforced until
winter quarter, Robinson said.
To maintain eligibility for mil
lions of dollars in federal funding,
Stanford introduced a policy Oct.
1 that prohibits the unlawful use
or possession of alcohol on cam
pus.
While the University's policy
now meets federal requirements,
implementation and enforcement
procedures have yet to be man
dated.
Robinson said he wanted to get
"the best possible suggestions
from the widest possible audi

assistants voiced more frustra

Roble Hall RF Rob Robinson
expressed disapproval of both the
new policy and state drinking
laws.
"The state law is not a good
law," he said. "It drives drinking

underground. A bad law has now
become a bad policy."
Several RAs voiced fears that
they would be expected to police
underage drinking. Kristin
Kuntz, an RAin Eucalypto, said
she "would fight tooth and nail" if
asked to enforce the alcohol policy.

chasing alcohol with dorm funds,
yet encourages underage resi
dents to drink in private, poten
tially dangerous situations.
"If we're abiding by the laws of
University policy," Cedro RA Jenn
Allison said, "I don't see how we
can go on spending house funds
on alcohol."
Yet as ZAP RA Merrill Langfitt
said, "I feel very strongly that if
we go to really strong policy mea
sures, it's going to drive people
off-campus, behind doors. It's
going to make things much
worse."
"We're more than educators,
we're also caretakers," said Todd
Ortega, another Cedro RA. He
argued that a stringent alcohol
policy could "damage severely my
relationship with my frosh."
Kuntz said, "It's impossible to
support the use of dorm funds to
purchase alcohol" in lieu of the
