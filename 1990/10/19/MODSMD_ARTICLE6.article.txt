The extensive murals that
adorn the walls of Casa Zapata
have increased yet again, incorpo
rating a series of three paintings
by a Bay Area muralists.
Originally rejected by the
house in a meeting last spring,
Zapata's 19th mural — "Estatues
of Liberty" — will be dedicated
tonight, combining an artist's
vision with a powerful message.
The mural, which was created
by two Bay Area muralists and the
students of a spring 1990
SWOPSI class, will be officially
dedicated in conjunction with the
annual reunion of past and pre
sent residents of the
Chicano/Latino theme house.
"The mural dedication is in
recognition of muralists, the
mural students, the SWOPSI
classes, art in public places, and a
celebration of all of these," said
resident fellow Tony Burciaga, a
nationally-known poet, writer and
muralist.
San Francisco muralist Ray
Patl6n, one of the original pio
neers of the contemporary mural
art movement, proposed the
three-part mural to the students

of Casa Zapata in spring, 1989.
Patl6n's mural plan was ini
tially rejected by Zapata residents
who thought the mural was too
violent because it portrayed a
number of gun-toting figures.
Abandoning the idea briefly,
Patl6n called the controversy
"silly" and said students were liv
ing in a "fantasy world at Stan
ford."
In spring 1990, Patl&n — along
with new Bay Area muralist
Eduardo Pineda — taught a
SWOPSI class called "Chicano
and Asian-American Mural Work
shop."
They asked the 11 students to
give their input about possible
changes in the mural's design.
The class as a whole decided to
replace the guns in the original
sketch with flowers.
According to Burciaga, the
three-part mural deals with "the
liberation struggles of the
Latino/Chicano people from
throughout the American conti
nent."
The first panel is an overhead
portrayal of a native Aztec Indian
