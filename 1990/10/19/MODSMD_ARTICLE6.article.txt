# New Zapata mural celebrates struggle
## 
### Roberta Chavez 
The extensive murals that
adorn the walls of Casa Zapata
have increased yet again, incorpo
rating a series of three paintings
by a Bay Area muralists.
Originally rejected by the
house in a meeting last spring,
Zapata's 19th mural — "Estatues
of Liberty" — will be dedicated
tonight, combining an artist's
vision with a powerful message.
The mural, which was created
by two Bay Area muralists and the
students of a spring 1990
SWOPSI class, will be officially
dedicated in conjunction with the
annual reunion of past and pre
sent residents of the
Chicano/Latino theme house.
"The mural dedication is in
recognition of muralists, the
mural students, the SWOPSI
classes, art in public places, and a
celebration of all of these," said
resident fellow Tony Burciaga, a
nationally-known poet, writer and
muralist.
San Francisco muralist Ray
Patl6n, one of the original pio
neers of the contemporary mural
art movement, proposed the
three-part mural to the students

of Casa Zapata in spring, 1989.
Patl6n's mural plan was ini
tially rejected by Zapata residents
who thought the mural was too
violent because it portrayed a
number of gun-toting figures.
Abandoning the idea briefly,
Patl6n called the controversy
"silly" and said students were liv
ing in a "fantasy world at Stan
ford."
In spring 1990, Patl&n — along
with new Bay Area muralist
Eduardo Pineda — taught a
SWOPSI class called "Chicano
and Asian-American Mural Work
shop."
They asked the 11 students to
give their input about possible
changes in the mural's design.
The class as a whole decided to
replace the guns in the original
sketch with flowers.
According to Burciaga, the
three-part mural deals with "the
liberation struggles of the
Latino/Chicano people from
throughout the American conti
nent."
The first panel is an overhead
portrayal of a native Aztec Indian
performing a spiritual call on a
conch, a large seashell. He is hold
ing marigolds, the traditional
flowers Aztecs used to celebrate
death.
The middle panel — the most
eye-catching of the three — is a
representation of a black and
white photograph of two urban
guerrilla soldiers. The two are
huddled in defensive positions
behind the corner of a building.
Instead of guns, the soldiers
are carrying lilies, the traditional
flowers for the dead in Mexican
culture. The lilies are painted in
color, in opposition to the black
and white photograph.
The instructors and students
agreed that the lilies make the
mural much more powerful in
representing the theme of life ver
sus death.
"The soldiers could be any
where in the world," Patl&n said.
And, he added, the intentional
lack of color is appropriate
because "death is black and
white."
The third panel is taken from a
Patl&n mural in Balmy Alley, a
famous concentration of murals
in San Francisco's Mission Dis
trict.
The panel portrays a woman
seen from overhead carrying a
concealed weapon in a bag of
roses. She is walking past a door
way in which the shadow of a mil
itary figure looms.
The importance of the third
panel is twofold. First, according
to Burciaga, the mural points out

The three-part mural deals with 'the liberation
struggles of the Latino/Chicano people from
throughout the American continent.'

the role of women in Central and
South American warfare.
Second, Patl&n said the panel
was a way of bringing San Fran
cisco's "La Raza" community to
Stanford. "Murals are symbols
that make a statement about our
history and culture," he said.
Senior Anita De Lucio, a resi
dent assistant at Zapata who is
currently researching the Zapata
murals, added that bringing a
piece of art from San Francisco
"preserves it in the art gallery of
Zapata" and therefore makes a
"significant contribution" to the
house.
When walking by the mural,
class member Stephen Dorow said
he can take pride in knowing
"that I painted that rose petal."
But, he said, the most exciting
experience was "being able to
work with an artist like [Patl6n]."
Dorow, a junior who lived in
Zapata his first two years,
acknowledged that "students at
Stanford for the most part
wouldn't be able to name very
many contemporary muralists."
At the beginning of the class,
he noted, many of the students
were unaware that Patl&n, who is
scheduled to attend the dedication
ceremony, is an internationally
renowned muralist.
Patl£n said working with stu
dents — who present a "challenge
and different approach" — helps

develop his abilities as a muralist.
"Many times students give me
much more than I give them," he
said.
According to De Lucio, the pro
cess of mural-making is suspense
ful. "First there is white, then the
images, then the final mural," she
said.
Watching the students "bring
the images to life" is like "seeing a
reflection of yourself on a wall,"
Patldn added.
Burciaga summed up the phi
losophy behind mural apprecia
tion.
"Murals and art are supposed
to be viewed and appreciated," he
said, "not only according to one's
own perspective, but also by try
ing to appreciate and understand
what the artists were trying to
say."
