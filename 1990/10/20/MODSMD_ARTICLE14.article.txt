# Big Game hero ready to see more playing time
## 
### Brian Egan 
He was one of the most heavily
recruited running backs in the
state of California in 1987. He
rushed for 101 yards and scored a
touchdown against California last
year. He began spring practice
number one on the Cardinal run
ning back depth chart.
Glyn Milburn? No. Tommy
Vardell or Jon Volpe? Guess again.
His name is J. J. Lasley, and 1990
has certainly been frustrating for
the sophomore from Van Nuys,
Calif.

"Yeah, I thought I had nailed
down the (starting) job. It's been
tough sitting on the sidelines, but
I'm ready," he said. "I'm just wait
ing for my opportunity."
To Lasley, sharing the
is old hat. He teamed with current
California sophomore standout
Russell White at Crespi High
School in both 1986 and 1987.
This "Dream Backfield" was
widely considered to be one of the
best in state high school football
history
His senior year, Lasley totaled
over 1000 total yards despite han
dling the ball less than 4.5 times a
game.
After a long recruiting battle,
Lasley decided on Stanford over
USC. To him, the choice was an
easy one.
"I was raised in L.A., and I
lived a couple of blocks from
Southern Cal. I wouldn't have
been going away to school if I
went to USC," Lasley said. "Plus,
it was (USC Coach) Larry Smith's
first year, so the program seemed
sort of unstable."
As it turned out, 1988 was Jack
Elway's last year at Stanford.
Lasley was redshirted in 1988 and
began his collegiate career under
current coach Denny Green in
1989. He started three games,
rushing for a total of 185 yards,
with an impressive performance
in the Big Game standing out as
the highlight of his season.
"After the Cal game, everyone
was telling me how well I played,"

he said. "I was thinking, 'lf they
think that was good, wait until
next year.' "
Next year, however, took an
unfortunate turn. After a winter
spent working on his quickness
and running form under the tute
lage of Cardinal track and field
coach Brooks Johnson, Lasley
entered April practice in good run
ning shape and ready to maintain
his spot on the starting squad. To
his disappointment, the redshirt
sophomore fell victim to an
untimely knee injury on the first
day of workouts.
"It was the last run of the day.
A split left was called. I took the
ball, stretched it across the field,
and cut back when the cornerback
overran the play. I felt a pop in my
knee, but I ran the play out. After
the whistle blew, I couldn't make
it back to the huddle."
Lasley remained on the side
lines for the rest of the spring,
watching his teammates practice
and perfect their skills.
Upon his return in August, he
had lost his starting spot and
found himself in the unfamiliar
position of fighting for playing
time. He used this more as an
inspiration than a setback.
"I wasn't depressed at all," he
said. "I wanted the ball, and my
goal was to start against Colorado
in the season opener."
By the Colorado game, Lasley
had worked his way up to the sec
ond team, behind sophomore Mil
burn.
This season, Lasley has thrived
when given the opportunity to
play, rushing for 44 yards on only
7 carries. More impressively, he
has become an integral part of the
Cardinal special teams unit, a job
he enjoys. Lasley has been harass
ing opposing return units
throughout the season with his
speed downfield and his aggres
sive, hard-hitting style.
Last week against USC, his
efforts paid off when he recovered
a critical Trojan punt fumble to
keep the Cardinal's hopes alive
early in the game.

"I think I'd go crazy if I didn't
have special teams," Lasley said.
"Kickoff returns give me the
opportunity to get crazy and hit
some people."
Though obviously disappointed
by his lack of playing time, Lasley
has remained optimistic about his
future on the team.
"We have a saying on special
teams, 'live it and love it.' I'm dis
appointed in my playing time, but
I'm ready to go at any time, be it
because of an injury or whatever."
Without whining, Lasley has
attempted to figure out why he
does not get more time on the
field.
"I've talked to the coaches, and
said, 'What do I have to do to

play?"' he said. "Although I'm not
seeing too much action, I've still
got two years ahead of me."
Green has been pleased with
Lasley's attitude.
"J. J. still gives us 100 percent
every day, and has been great on
special teams," Green said. "We'd
love to play him more, and if we
can get our offense going, we'll do
it."
Although he and Milburn are
competing for the same slot,
Lasley stressed that it is friendly
competition.

"Glyn and I are good friends,
and we've known about each
other since high school," he said.
"We have a competitive relation
ship. There's a difference between
rivalries, which drag people down,
and good competition, which lifts
you up."
After doubling up with super
stars for most his career, Lasley
recognizes that team goals stretch
beyond glamorous individual
statistics.
"The team's playing great, and
I'm having fun. I know I'll get my
chance to shine."

ing for my opportunity."
To Lasley, sharing the
is old hat. He teamed with current
California sophomore standout
Russell White at Crespi High
School in both 1986 and 1987.
This "Dream Backfield" was
widely considered to be one of the
best in state high school football
history
His senior year, Lasley totaled
over 1000 total yards despite han
dling the ball less than 4.5 times a
game.
After a long recruiting battle,
Lasley decided on Stanford over
USC. To him, the choice was an
easy one.
"I was raised in L.A., and I
lived a couple of blocks from
Southern Cal. I wouldn't have
been going away to school if I
went to USC," Lasley said. "Plus,
it was (USC Coach) Larry Smith's
first year, so the program seemed
sort of unstable."
As it turned out, 1988 was Jack
Elway's last year at Stanford.
Lasley was redshirted in 1988 and
began his collegiate career under
current coach Denny Green in
1989. He started three games,
rushing for a total of 185 yards,
with an impressive performance
in the Big Game standing out as
the highlight of his season.
"After the Cal game, everyone
was telling me how well I played,"

he said. "I was thinking, 'lf they
think that was good, wait until
next year.' "
Next year, however, took an
unfortunate turn. After a winter
spent working on his quickness
and running form under the tute
lage of Cardinal track and field
coach Brooks Johnson, Lasley
entered April practice in good run
ning shape and ready to maintain
his spot on the starting squad. To
his disappointment, the redshirt
sophomore fell victim to an
untimely knee injury on the first
day of workouts.
"It was the last run of the day.
A split left was called. I took the
ball, stretched it across the field,
and cut back when the cornerback
overran the play. I felt a pop in my
knee, but I ran the play out. After
the whistle blew, I couldn't make
it back to the huddle."
Lasley remained on the side
lines for the rest of the spring,
watching his teammates practice
and perfect their skills.
Upon his return in August, he
had lost his starting spot and
found himself in the unfamiliar
position of fighting for playing
time. He used this more as an
inspiration than a setback.
"I wasn't depressed at all," he
said. "I wanted the ball, and my
goal was to start against Colorado
in the season opener."
By the Colorado game, Lasley
had worked his way up to the sec
ond team, behind sophomore Mil
burn.
This season, Lasley has thrived
when given the opportunity to
play, rushing for 44 yards on only
7 carries. More impressively, he
has become an integral part of the
Cardinal special teams unit, a job
he enjoys. Lasley has been harass
ing opposing return units
throughout the season with his
speed downfield and his aggres
sive, hard-hitting style.
Last week against USC, his
efforts paid off when he recovered
a critical Trojan punt fumble to
keep the Cardinal's hopes alive
early in the game.

"I think I'd go crazy if I didn't
have special teams," Lasley said.
"Kickoff returns give me the
opportunity to get crazy and hit
some people."
Though obviously disappointed
by his lack of playing time, Lasley
has remained optimistic about his
future on the team.
"We have a saying on special
teams, 'live it and love it.' I'm dis
appointed in my playing time, but
I'm ready to go at any time, be it
because of an injury or whatever."
Without whining, Lasley has
attempted to figure out why he
does not get more time on the
field.
"I've talked to the coaches, and
said, 'What do I have to do to

play?"' he said. "Although I'm not
seeing too much action, I've still
got two years ahead of me."
Green has been pleased with
Lasley's attitude.
"J. J. still gives us 100 percent
every day, and has been great on
special teams," Green said. "We'd
love to play him more, and if we
can get our offense going, we'll do
it."
Although he and Milburn are
competing for the same slot,
Lasley stressed that it is friendly
competition.

"Glyn and I are good friends,
and we've known about each
other since high school," he said.
"We have a competitive relation
ship. There's a difference between
rivalries, which drag people down,
and good competition, which lifts
you up."
After doubling up with super
stars for most his career, Lasley
recognizes that team goals stretch
beyond glamorous individual
statistics.
"The team's playing great, and
I'm having fun. I know I'll get my
chance to shine."

Coming out of Crespi High in Los Angeles, J.J. Lasley was one of the most highly recruited running
backs in the nation. The redshirt sophomore ran for 101 yards against Cal last year, but has found him
self fighting Glyn Milburn for playing time this year. Lasley has found success on special teams, but is

He was one of the most heavily
recruited running backs in the
state of California in 1987. He
rushed for 101 yards and scored a
touchdown against California last

number one on the Cardinal run

Glyn Milburn? No. Tommy
