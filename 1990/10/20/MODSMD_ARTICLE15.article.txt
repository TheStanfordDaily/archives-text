# Recruiters look for mix of sport and study
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Each year, the month of August
brings a new wave of football play
ers to The Farm. As they begin
their Cardinal careers, these 25
freshman represent the future of
Stanford football. They are the
product of a rigorous recruiting
and admissions process through
which they have risen to the top of
a pool of 6,000 would be super
stars.
The recruiting office at Stan
ford bears the task of sifting
through data on every possible
recruit and then narrowing down
the pool until only 60 names
remain to be sent to the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions. In
Stanford's case, the top candi
dates must be the best athletes
who also excel academically.

"That's an obstacle that other
schools don't have," recruiting
coodinator Keith Sparks said.
"It's tough to compete with
schools like Notre Dame and USC
in attracting the top high school
players that are more athletically
than academically oriented. Some
are not persuaded that we are
serious in establishing a winning
program."
The recruiting process involves
a complex series of interactions
between players, coaches, teach
ers and parents. Every one of the
Stanford football players has dif
ferent reasons for choosing and
being chosen by Stanford. Though

every story is different, each
begins as a suggested name.
The recruiting office receives
approximately 6,000 names of
possible recruits from numerous
sources including coaches,
recruiting publications, alumni,
parents, and even the high school
players themselves. The names
come in at a constant pace
throughout the whole year and in
January questionnaires are sent
to the coaches of the high schools
asking to list their most promi
nent juniors.
Stanford, in return, begins to
open lines of communication to
these players either by mail or by
phone.
"I was first contacted by
schools in the winter of my junior
year," junior Tony Trousset said.
A majority of the players are
contacted by 50 or more schools.
While the players begin to narrow
down their choices, so do the
recruiting offices.
"At that point we do an initial
review of all the candidates and
assess them according to their
size, speed and grades." Sparks
said. The applicant pool is then
cut in half to 3,000 names.
After this initial checkoff, a
Stanford University football pro
file is sent to each of the remain
ing candidates. The profile asks
for personal information, SAT
and ACT scores, GPA, athletic and
academic honors, hobbies and
other general information. Ap
proximately 2,000 completed pro

files are sent back to the recruit
ing office where they are in turn
sent to one of the 10 coaches who
are each responsible for a particu
lar region.
The recruits are immediately
classified into one of five possible
categories:
• Superblue: top candidates
who are very actively recruited.
• Blue: good candidates that
are actively recruited.
• Red plus: possibly good
recruits but need further investi
gation.
• Red: Good recruits in one
area but lack in others (i.e. excel
lent grades but not an extraordi
nary athlete).
• White: rejections (i.e. com
bined SAT score of 700).
"The system is very subjective
and it is an imperfect one," Keith
said. "We limit our active recruit
ing list to the 'blues' and
'superblues' which usually totals
around 125. All those that end up
playing for Stanford are for the
most part 'blues' with a few
'superblues'."
The recruiting office then
begins to actively recruit the 125
names that are no longer just
names, but possible Stanford foot
ball stars. The athletes must send
in videotapes of themselves in
action.

Background checkups on them
are done by maintaining constant
contact with coaches, guidance
counselors, teachers and parents.
Letters are sent to the players

eveiy week and phone interaction
remains continual throughout the
recruiting season. When legal,
Stanford coaches also attend high
school games.
At this point of the year, Stan
ford now has approximately 115
candidates that are being actively
recruited as well as assessed.
These names will eventually be
cut down to 60.
"We are looking for athletic and
academic ability," Sparks said.
"Neither academics nor athletics
comes first. If they have them
both, we want them and will
actively recruit them. If they are
not as strong as the others in one
area, we have to rule them out."
The Stanford recruiting office
claims that it "sells the Stanford
experience" when actively recruit
ing. The virtues of Stanford that
are emphasized are the location,
the coaching staff (Denny Green
being a former Superbowl coach),
and Stanford's position at the top
of the country's academic pro
grams.
"No other school in the country
can offer a marriage of athletics
and academics the way Stanford
can," Sparks said.
Despite the fact that these
virtues are key elements in the
many of the players' decisions to
commit to Stanford, some players
claim that the people on the Stan
ford team were most effective in
convincing them to come to this
school.
"I liked the Stanford players a

lot," Trousset said. "They were so
much fun and all laughs. They
took me to great restaurants,
introduced me to the campus as
well as the student body."
Senior Chuck Gillingham also
found his visit to Stanford to be a
key factor in his decision to com
mit here.
"The trips that I took to other
schools were all drinking and par
tying," Gillingham said. "Here it
was more subdued. The players
were trying to show me 'this is
what Stanford really is'. That's
what impressed me the most."
For some players, fitting in
with the team was not weighted as
much. Others were attracted to
the fact that Stanford plays in one
of the top conferences in the
nation. Stanford's trip to the
Gator Bowl in 1986 also turned
many heads towards the Farm.
"If we weren't in the Gator
Bowl the year I was recruited, I'm
not sure if I would be here."
Trousset said.
Stanford's victory against then
No. 1 in the nation Notre Dame is
expected to have a similar impact
on this year's recruiting season.
The win has resulted in national
exposure in the New York Times
as well as in Sports Illustrated.
"The victory at Notre Dame
put us on the map as a program
that is on the upswing," Sparks
said. "We are a program that
means business in achieving sue-
cess. Success breeds success."
Sparks adds that television
exposure is very important in
recruiting top players.
"The recruits are 17-18-year
old kids," Sparks said. "They want
the glamorous life, to be on ABC
and to strut their stuff. They rel
ish the opportunity of having a
national audience."
Once the final decisions in the

recruiting office are made, the
names of the 60 top candidates are
sent to the Admissions Office. At
this point it is strictly an admis
sions decision.

"It's out of our hands," Sparks
said. "We can recruit them but
they have to get in. All we can do
is present the players that we feel
are the best candidates academi
cally and athletically."
While the admissions process is
omitted at most univerisities,
Stanford takes pride in the aca
demic caliber of its football play
ers.

When all the commitment
papers are signed and the fresh
man football class is set, about 25
players pack their bags for The
Farm.
Then the process starts all over
again.
