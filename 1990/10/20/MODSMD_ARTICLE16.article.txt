# Secondary under scrutiny
## 
### dy Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The setting: a mock discussion
concerning the Cardinal sec
ondary at a pregame tailgate
party before today's Stanford-
Washington showdown.

The Stanford Student:
What is up with the secondary?
Dean Jean Fetter: Why are
the defensive backs getting
burned on third and long?
President Donald Kennedy:
Is it lack of experience?
The Tree: What packages are
being tooled? Is it the nickel, the
zone, or the man-on-man?
The Alumnus: Can the DB's
make the correct adjustments for
today's game with Washington?
The Stanford Defense: We
wish we knew the right answer.
It seems like a trend nowadays
to pin all the blame on the Cardi
nal secondary. When the football
team loses, the secondary takes
the heat. For it is the secondary
which always seems to fall apart
when the game is on the line.
Yet, this chic criticism is nar
row-minded.

Granted, the defensive backs
have been burned in every defeat
most glaringly in last week's
37-22 loss to USC but they are
not alone. People forget that there
is something called a defensive
line.
Like any other traditional
defensive game plan, Stanford's
scheme calls for its linemen to
force the quarterback to scramble,
to hurry passes and to be intimi
dated.
Yet, the Cardinal line has not
applied enough pressure, and as a
result the secondary has been left
high and dry.
"The problem with the sec
ondary is not only a secondary
problem," said sophomore strong
safety Jimmy Klein. "We rely on
the Line for the pass rush and
regardless if it doesn't put on the
pressure or if the defensive backs
don't, the secondary looks bad."
So what is wrong with the
defensive unit?
"What it comes down to is that
we are not playing aggressive
enough," said Coach Denny
Green. "When the ball's hiked we
play hard, but our number of
sacks (19), interceptions (5), and
pass interferences (0) shows that

we need to still play more aggres
sive. We need tighter coverage and
a pass rush applying more pres
sure."
The aggressive nature of play
ing goes hand-in-hand with expe
rience, and that is one aspect that
the Cardinal defense lacks.
Among the starting secondary,
senior cornerback Kevin Scott
leads a corps of sophomores
free safety Seyon Albert, corner
back Darrien Gordon and the
strong safety Klein with little
or no experience prior to this year.
The fact that linebacker Jono
Tunney is the only senior among
the entire defensive front only
amplifies the team's inexperience.
Nose tackle Frank Busalacchi, left
tackle Estevan Avila, right tackle
Tyler Batson, left outside
linebacker Ron George, right out
side linebacker Dave Garnett, and
right inside linebacker Dan Byers
are all in their second year of ath
letic eligibility.
"We will struggle, we'll play
hard, we'll hang in there, and as
we get older we'll get better," said
defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
of his young cast of players.

The Stanford defensive secondary has been under the microscope
all season. Cornerback Albert Richardson (above) and company
have been blamed for much of the Cardinal's losses this season, but
as any coach will attest, the job of stopping the pass is the job of the
whole defense, not just the job of the defensive backs.
Nonetheless, Scott does not
feel that inexperience is an issue
anymore: "We're young, but we're
six games into the year and we
need to play like we are a veteran
defensive unit.
"If a quarterback has the time

to sit back, he can pick apart any
secondary. The defensive backs
have to make the plays," Scott
continued.
And the defensive unit is hun
gry. Ranked dead last in the
Pacific' 10 Conference in passing
defense having 1,524 yards and 12
touchdowns thrown against it, it
has a chip on its shoulder and an
image of toast it wishes to dispel.
Yet, the defensive strategy

seems simple as ever.
"We're not going to change
anything," said Shaw. "We're
going to control the run and con
tain the quarterback."
With Washington possessing
the Pac-10's Conference's best
rushing offense, this will be no
mean feat. Yet if Stanford does
stop the run, Washington will
have to go to the air against their
opponent's questionable sec
ondary.
