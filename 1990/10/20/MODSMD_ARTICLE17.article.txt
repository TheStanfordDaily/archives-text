# Yelling to a quiet crowd

### Swaminatha Gurudevan 
There are many things at a
Cardinal football game that can
distract the common sports fan:
the wave, the halftime show, the
incessant cheers of enthusiastic
sports fans and the new Stan
ford yell leaders.

Not only has the last item on
the list distracted many specta
tors, but it has also caused much
controversy. While the Athletic
Department and the football team
have expressed their support for
the squad, many students have
called for the removal of the yell
leaders from the football field.
Stanford has not had a cheer
leading squad since the early '7os.
In a previous sampling of 285 stu
dents, 45.6 percent disapproved of
the Athletic Department's deci
sion to create the squad in the
first place, while only 24 percent
thought it was a good idea.
In a bitter invective, senior
David Hyatt wrote, "Every time
the 'leaders' tried to start a cheer,
their efforts crashed and burned
in a mangled heap of disgrace."
Hyatt urged the Stanford Ath
letic Department to scrap the yell
leader program altogether.
Many students feel that a
financial resource tradeoff has
occurred between the yell leader
program and other important ath
letic programs.
Eh Cates, a senior from New
York, remarked, "It's a complete
waste of money. I'm stunned and
amazed that the University cut
funds to certain sports programs
last year because they thought
that they wouldn't last."
Samuel Lu, a senior from San
Jose, offered a different explana

tion. He noted, "Frankly, I think
they're there to placate the alums.
Alumni think that the band is
immature. As long as [the yell
leaders] stay on the alumni sec
tion, it'll be fine with me."
In light of this, the yell leaders
have been working overtime in an
attempt to win back the crowd.
Aaron Poirier, a sophomore yell
leader, noted, "I think that we're
working very hard and we have a
lot of obstacles in our way, like
being new, getting criticism, and
learning all the new cheers."
Amid complaints that the uni
versity was wasting money on the
yell leading squad, Poirier appar
ently has a discrepancy of opinion.
"We have no real budget, per
se," he said. "We have no money to
go to games. All [the university]
gave us was our uniforms, and we
had to work for those."
Poirier expects the squad to
work even harder today against
Washington, the Pacific 10 Con
ference front-runner.
"We've added more cheer and
more stunts, and a cleaner perfor
mance for the crowd. Everyone's
going to be more fired up," he
said. "[The fans] are going to
cheer no matter what. Maybe
they'll direct their energies
towards the team. If they do,
that's great."
Additionally, there has been
considerable support for the yell
leader squad coming from within
the Stanford football organiza
tion.

Hart well Brown, a freshman
inside linebacker, had many words

of praise for the yell leaders. "I
feel that cheerleading is an inte
gral part of college football and
college life in general.
"I think it's great that we have
them, and they're really helping
the team," he said. "It's ridiculous
that there's such a big contro
versy over this."
Poirier has reacted with
courage to the swarm of criticism
that has befallen the Stanford yell
leaders. Despite all of the harsh
tones directed at the squad, he

feels the yell leaders have
maintained their confidence and
poise.
"The morale is really high on
the squad," he said. "I knew we'd
have criticism, just from the way
things happened last year."
As the the football season
heads into its second half, the yell
leaders know that their funding
may be on the line if they do not
receive more fan support.
"It really helps the team if
they're in a crucial situation and
driving and the crowd is behind
them," he said. "All we're here to
do is help Stanford Athletics and
build school spirit."

The morale is really
high on the squad. I
knew we would have
criticism, just from
the way things hap
pened last year.'

The yell leaders have been the center of much controversy this year.
Funded at a time of many athletic cut-backs, the group has been
faced with student resentment and a general sense of apathy.
Students may not like them, but the yell-leaders are doing their best
to help spur the Cardinal onto victory.

receive more fan support.
"It really helps the team if
they're in a crucial situation and
driving and the crowd is behind
them," he said. "All we're here to
do is help Stanford Athletics and
build school spirit."

The morale is really
high on the squad. I
knew we would have
criticism, just from
the way things hap
pened last year.'


Al Green—Dally File
The yell leaders have been the center of much controversy this year.
Funded at a time of many athletic cut-backs, the group has been
faced with student resentment and a general sense of apathy.
Students may not like them, but the yell-leaders are doing their best
to help spur the Cardinal onto victory.
There are many things at a
Cardinal football game that can
distract the common sports fan:
the wave, the halftime show, the
incessant cheers of enthusiastic
sports fans and the new Stan
ford yell leaders.

Not only has the last item on
the list distracted many specta
tors, but it has also caused much
controversy. While the Athletic
Department and the football team
have expressed their support for
the squad, many students have
called for the removal of the yell
leaders from the football field.
Stanford has not had a cheer
leading squad since the early '7os.
In a previous sampling of 285 stu
dents, 45.6 percent disapproved of
the Athletic Department's deci
sion to create the squad in the
first place, while only 24 percent
thought it was a good idea.
In a bitter invective, senior
David Hyatt wrote, "Every time
the 'leaders' tried to start a cheer,
their efforts crashed and burned
in a mangled heap of disgrace."
Hyatt urged the Stanford Ath
letic Department to scrap the yell
leader program altogether.
Many students feel that a
financial resource tradeoff has
occurred between the yell leader
program and other important ath
letic programs.
Eh Cates, a senior from New
York, remarked, "It's a complete
waste of money. I'm stunned and
amazed that the University cut
funds to certain sports programs
last year because they thought
that they wouldn't last."
Samuel Lu, a senior from San
Jose, offered a different explana

tion. He noted, "Frankly, I think
they're there to placate the alums.
Alumni think that the band is
immature. As long as [the yell
leaders] stay on the alumni sec
tion, it'll be fine with me."
In light of this, the yell leaders
have been working overtime in an
attempt to win back the crowd.
Aaron Poirier, a sophomore yell
leader, noted, "I think that we're
working very hard and we have a
lot of obstacles in our way, like
being new, getting criticism, and
learning all the new cheers."
Amid complaints that the uni
versity was wasting money on the
yell leading squad, Poirier appar
ently has a discrepancy of opinion.
"We have no real budget, per
se," he said. "We have no money to
go to games. All [the university]
gave us was our uniforms, and we
had to work for those."
Poirier expects the squad to
work even harder today against
Washington, the Pacific 10 Con
ference front-runner.
"We've added more cheer and
more stunts, and a cleaner perfor
mance for the crowd. Everyone's
going to be more fired up," he
said. "[The fans] are going to
cheer no matter what. Maybe
they'll direct their energies
towards the team. If they do,
that's great."
Additionally, there has been
considerable support for the yell
leader squad coming from within
the Stanford football organiza
tion.

Hart well Brown, a freshman
inside linebacker, had many words

of praise for the yell leaders. "I
feel that cheerleading is an inte
gral part of college football and
college life in general.
"I think it's great that we have
them, and they're really helping
the team," he said. "It's ridiculous
that there's such a big contro
versy over this."
Poirier has reacted with
courage to the swarm of criticism
that has befallen the Stanford yell
leaders. Despite all of the harsh
tones directed at the squad, he

feels the yell leaders have
maintained their confidence and
poise.
"The morale is really high on
the squad," he said. "I knew we'd
have criticism, just from the way
things happened last year."
As the the football season
heads into its second half, the yell
leaders know that their funding
may be on the line if they do not
receive more fan support.
"It really helps the team if
they're in a crucial situation and
driving and the crowd is behind
them," he said. "All we're here to
do is help Stanford Athletics and
build school spirit."
