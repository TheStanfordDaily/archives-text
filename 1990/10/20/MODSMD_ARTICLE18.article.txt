# LSJUMB takes control of a noisy halftime
## 
### Janet Feldstein Staff writer Benjamin Myers LSJUMB Public Relations 
A cheer rises up from the crowd
at the packed football stadium.
The Stanford fans are actually
cheering? Is it another last
minute, save-the-day play? Not
exactly.
The Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching
Band has taken the field for its
halftime entertainment bonanza.
Despite administrator Dr.
Arthur E Barnes' declaration,
"The Band is wimpy [and] has no
hair," and the generally negative
publicity from the national audi
ence the band has received in the
past few years, the Stanford
crowd appears to like what they
see.
The band's premier goal, in
fact, has always been to please the
audience. However, LSJUMB has
recently made more of an effort to
deliver.
"We've been doing the same
things for the past 25 years," said
band manager Linda Kay Brown.
"It's time we freshened up."
"The band has tried to refocus
on being interesting, innovative
and challenging," member
Dwayne Virnau said.
In the past 10 years, the band
has attempted to bring its musical
selection up to date, drawing more
pieces from the funk, rock-and
roll and jazz fields. Band members
have added their own touch to the
selections by providing the band
with personal renditions of the
music.

In addition, the band has made
a concerted effort to bridge out to
the Bay Area community, playing
at various corporations and in
local carnivals.

Pleasing its audience is not,
however, the only goal of the
Band. As one member pointed
out, "This isn't fun; It's a binge!"
"Why iron polish and stifle
yourself in a 19-piece, 19th cen
tury military uniform when you
can sport a bright red polyester
sport coat, fashionable white
sneakers, a hat that other bands
will trade almost anything for and
the ugliest tie your father never
wore?" questioned drum major
Greg Louden.
Everyone in the band seems to
speak glowingly about positive
attitudes, great friendships, true
cameraderie and the joint effort to
.create a fresher image.
"The band poses a dilemma to
the modern hedonist; fun is too

often perceived as a finite dimen
sion," junior Jay Podgurski
explained.
Barnes may be the band's only
non-believer in the trend
towards-a-more-positive-attitude
philosophy. "It's a safe thing (for
people) to say; I don't know
whether or not it's true," he said.
"The band was much more excit
ing 20 years ago ... so were stu
dents. Students are pretty much
boring now."

Since 1963 Barnes has had a
vital, if occasionally cynical, pres
ence in the band. At that time, he
was given the official administra
tive control of the newly reformed
LSJUMB; realistically, though,
the band members took control at
that point.
"He got control of the band by
giving control to the band," said
Louden.
In 1963 the band revolted
against the administration's con
trol of it and refused to play for
three games. According to public
relations director Ben Myers, "We
pretty much still think we're
revolting."
Among other possibly revolting
things the band controls is the
Band Shak, called home since the
early '7os. Presently a condemned
residency, the Shak was once a
steam plant and was later a ROTC
firing range.
Now, the Shak is jam-packed
with various road signs col
lected on roadtrips and borrowed
indefinitely, according to Brown.
The following warning and adver
tising signs are included in the
extensive assemblage: "CAU
TION - Respirator Required in
This Area"; "Beaver Crossing";
"Moaning Cavern Park"; "Emer
gency Pass Out Gate"; and the
sign over the front door, "Child
Development and Mental Retar
dation Center."

Almost unnoticeable is a tiny,
dark, carved-wood sign in Gothic
lettering: "Stanford University
Marching Band."

Facing our nation's financial
crisis, the Stanford Band feels a
patriotic responsibility to ask the
one question on every citizen's
mind: "Do you want fries with
that?" Although the answer
eludes us, we might as well
address the federal deficit. It's big,
it's bad, and it's making George
Bush refer to unsavory parts of
his anatomy. Rushing in where
Graham-Rudman fears to tread,
LSJUMB presents ways to end
Washington's fiscal woes.
1) Any entrepreneur will tell
you motivation is the key to suc
cess. But how do you motivate 535
pork-barrel Congressmen to
reduce excessive Federal spend
ing? The Band suggests we exe
cute one legislator every hour
until Congress agrees to cut the
budget. As Groucho might say,
"I've heard of Capitol punish
ment, but this is ridiculous .. ."
Song: "One at a Time" (break
out the guillotines)
2) While Gorbachev favors free
markets, years of running a
socialist state have taught him to
play a mean game of Monopoly. He
knows that there's an easy way
for D.C. to raise extra money: a
hotel on Boardwalk.
Song: "Livin' in the USA"
3) Given the crisis, we'd all be
happier if President Bush had
opened that letter from Ed McMa
hon. Still, with limited assets,
inside information, and a little
help from Pete Rose, the feds
"could still be a winner." Sure, rig
ging lotteries is a crime ... but, in
this case, crime pays.
Song: the Jeopardy! theme
4) Besides being economic pow
erhouses, what do Japan and Ger
many have in common? Well, for
starters, they both lost World War
II to the U.S. Forty-five years
later, with a deficit as large as the
Weimar Republic, we should
retroactively surrender, and get
them to rebuild our economy.
Song: "I'm Turning
Japanese"
5) Members of the world's old
est profession have always known
how to make a buck. And now that
the government owns Reno's
scenic Mustang Ranch, budget
woes are over. By imitating
McDonald's and franchising
across the country, Uncle Sam will
rake in dough with his high
payin' ho's.
Song: "Love Shak"

The band was much
more exciting 20
years ago. ..so were
students. Students
are pretty much bor
ing now.'

retroactively surrender, and get

A cheer rises up from the crowd
at the packed football stadium.
The Stanford fans are actually
cheering? Is it another last
minute, save-the-day play? Not
exactly.
The Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching
Band has taken the field for its
halftime entertainment bonanza.
Despite administrator Dr.
Arthur E Barnes' declaration,
"The Band is wimpy [and] has no
hair," and the generally negative
publicity from the national audi
ence the band has received in the
past few years, the Stanford
crowd appears to like what they
see.
The band's premier goal, in
fact, has always been to please the
audience. However, LSJUMB has
recently made more of an effort to
deliver.
"We've been doing the same
things for the past 25 years," said
band manager Linda Kay Brown.
"It's time we freshened up."
"The band has tried to refocus
on being interesting, innovative
and challenging," member
Dwayne Virnau said.
In the past 10 years, the band
has attempted to bring its musical
selection up to date, drawing more
pieces from the funk, rock-and
roll and jazz fields. Band members
have added their own touch to the
selections by providing the band
with personal renditions of the
music.

In addition, the band has made
a concerted effort to bridge out to
the Bay Area community, playing
at various corporations and in
local carnivals.

Pleasing its audience is not,
however, the only goal of the
Band. As one member pointed
out, "This isn't fun; It's a binge!"
"Why iron polish and stifle
yourself in a 19-piece, 19th cen
tury military uniform when you
can sport a bright red polyester
sport coat, fashionable white
sneakers, a hat that other bands
will trade almost anything for and
the ugliest tie your father never
wore?" questioned drum major
Greg Louden.
Everyone in the band seems to
speak glowingly about positive
attitudes, great friendships, true
cameraderie and the joint effort to
.create a fresher image.
"The band poses a dilemma to
the modern hedonist; fun is too

often perceived as a finite dimen
sion," junior Jay Podgurski
explained.
Barnes may be the band's only
non-believer in the trend
towards-a-more-positive-attitude
philosophy. "It's a safe thing (for
people) to say; I don't know
whether or not it's true," he said.
"The band was much more excit
ing 20 years ago ... so were stu
dents. Students are pretty much
boring now."

Since 1963 Barnes has had a
vital, if occasionally cynical, pres
ence in the band. At that time, he
was given the official administra
tive control of the newly reformed
LSJUMB; realistically, though,
the band members took control at
that point.
"He got control of the band by
giving control to the band," said
Louden.
In 1963 the band revolted
against the administration's con
trol of it and refused to play for
three games. According to public
relations director Ben Myers, "We
pretty much still think we're
revolting."
Among other possibly revolting
things the band controls is the
Band Shak, called home since the
early '7os. Presently a condemned
residency, the Shak was once a
steam plant and was later a ROTC
firing range.
Now, the Shak is jam-packed
with various road signs col
lected on roadtrips and borrowed
indefinitely, according to Brown.
The following warning and adver
tising signs are included in the
extensive assemblage: "CAU
TION - Respirator Required in
This Area"; "Beaver Crossing";
"Moaning Cavern Park"; "Emer
gency Pass Out Gate"; and the
sign over the front door, "Child
Development and Mental Retar
dation Center."

Almost unnoticeable is a tiny,
dark, carved-wood sign in Gothic
lettering: "Stanford University
Marching Band."

Facing our nation's financial
crisis, the Stanford Band feels a
patriotic responsibility to ask the
one question on every citizen's
mind: "Do you want fries with
that?" Although the answer
eludes us, we might as well
address the federal deficit. It's big,
it's bad, and it's making George
Bush refer to unsavory parts of
his anatomy. Rushing in where
Graham-Rudman fears to tread,
LSJUMB presents ways to end
Washington's fiscal woes.
1) Any entrepreneur will tell
you motivation is the key to suc
cess. But how do you motivate 535
pork-barrel Congressmen to
reduce excessive Federal spend
ing? The Band suggests we exe
cute one legislator every hour
until Congress agrees to cut the
budget. As Groucho might say,
"I've heard of Capitol punish
ment, but this is ridiculous .. ."
