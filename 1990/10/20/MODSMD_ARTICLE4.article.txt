# Huskies romp into Stanford ahead of the Pac
## 
### T.C. Hall Editorial staff 
Stanford offensive tackle Bob
Whitfield calls the Pacific 10 the
"any thing-goes conference",
which is probably why University
of Washington coach Don James
refuses to comment on the Rose
Bowl just yet.
"We don't talk about the Rose
Bowl here in Seattle," James said.

"We take things one game at a
time."

Smart man. In a conference
that sees then 0-5 Oregon State
beat 4-1 Arizona by 14 points, it is
probably hard to take anything for
granted. After a 31-22 (mostly sec
ond-half) thrashing by USC, the
Cardinal is now seventh in the
Pac-10 at 1-2 and 2-4 overall.
Hardly numbers that would seem
to strike fear in the heart of a man

whose team (3-0, 5-1 overall) is in
firm control of the Pac-10 title
race, but James has been around
long enough to know better.
"I worry about everything
about Stanford. I think they have
a lot of outstanding athletes,"
James said. "Everyone raves
about how big our line is; heck,
Stanford's line is bigger than
ours."
The line in question belongs to

Stanford's offense, a collection of
behemoths that average 290
pounds per body. The Cardinal
has used this wall of flesh to roll
up an average 27.7 points a game
and, along the way, knock off once
No.l Notre Dame.
Save for last week's second half
offensive woes, Stanford has
shown that it can put points on
the board. It is exactly this offen
sive threat the Huskies know can
create the upset they are trying so
hard to avoid.
"We have been impressed with
Stanford's offense this year,"
James said. " (Ed) McCaffrey and
(Glyn) Milburn are both having
great years."
True, but neither of the Cardi
nal stars have had to face the kind
of defense that the Huskies will
bring into Stanford Stadium.
Washington is the owner of the
nation's best run defense, and
also leads the Pac-10 in passing
defense, scoring defense, and, of
course, total defense. Last week,
the Huskies limited Oregon to
only 7 yards on 35 attempts and
they are now allowing just 47.5
yards per game.
The scary thing is that they
also own the best rushing offense
in the conference. Behind the Pac
-10 leader Greg Lewis's 135.8
yards a game, the Huskies have
been averaging 229.0 yards on the
ground every game. This combi
nation of rushing give-and-take is
the main reason that the Huskies
are ranked No. 17 in the country.
"A good combination of rushing
offense and rushing defense usu
ally means success. The closer you
get to the end zone, the harder it
is to throw the football," Green
said. "We are going to need to keep

them below 200 yards (rushing) to
beat them.
After last week's USC game,
Green knows the importance of a
good running game. The Cardi
nal's Jason Palumbis passed for
360 yards and the team rolled
early, but as soon as USC realized
that Stanford was not effective
running the ball, they stepped up
their pass rush.
The result was a frequently
sacked Palumbis and a prolific
Trojan performance which
outscored the Cardinal 30-6 after
the first quarter.
"We are going to need to estab
lish the run if we are going to
(beat Washington)," Green said.
"Right now it looks like we will
lead the conference in passing,
and we don't want that. We are
looking for a more balanced
attack."
Balanced will mean getting the
running game back on track after
its horrible performance against
USC. Milburn gained 234 yards in
total offense last weekend, but
only got 9 rushing yards on nine
attempts.
After all the pluses and
minuses were added up the team
wound up with just 4 yards on 19
attempts. The Cardinal has the
muscle and the talent to run, it
just has to make sure it does the
job.
"I feel we are the most physical
offense in the conference and in
the country," the 300-pound pre
season All-America candidate
Whitfield said.

"We are just not getting the job
done. If we don't get three yards
running, three yards running, and


Chris Eisenberg—Daily File
All—purpose player Glyn Mllburn (above) is the Pac-10's second leading receiver with an average of six
catches a game, but if Stanford is to beat Washington today, the speedster from Santa Monica will need
to stick to his running game. The Huskies have the Pac-10's best rushing defense, but as the Cardinal
learned last week, you cannot win football games without running the ball.
