# Chalk talk: Gap Exchange
## 
### 
Washington has solidified its offense hy establishing a strong run
ning game in each matchup this season. Tailback Greg Lewis has
accumulated over 100 yards rushing in every game and has opened
up quarterback Mark BruneLTs passing options. In order to throw off
the Huskies' balanced attack, the Cardinal defense must stop Lewis
at the line of scrimmage. The gap exchange is designed to meet Lewis
head-on as he cuts off the block of his strong tackle. Left tackle
Estevan Avila stunts right while left inside linebacker Jono Tunney
comes around the outside to fill in the gap. If the play shapes up as
drawn, all that is left is for the Stanford defenders to wrap up Lewis.
