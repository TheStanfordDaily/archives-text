# Stonehouse tries to find old kicking form
## 
### Andy Eiser 
It goes something like, "I'll just
have to punt."
We have all heard this expres
sion of lament from the mouth of
someone who feels as if he or she
were out of options, with their
back to the wall and time running
short. Paul Stonehouse has heard
it as well.
Stonehouse, to be exact, heard
the ciy from the Stanford football
program about two years ago,
when he was earning his reputa
tion as the No. 1 prep punter/
placekicker in the nation during
his senior year at Loyola High
School in Los Angeles.
The rest, as they say, is history,
and both Stonehouse and the Car
dinal have been getting their kicks
out of the relationship ever since.
To hear his name Stone
house brings to mind the image
of a middle linebacker. Yet stand
ing at 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds,
Stanford's punter has a fragile
build for someone with a pen
chant for the pigskin. This
becomes clearer in light of the fact
that some of the other men who
don the cardinal and white each
week are nearly one foot taller
than Stonehouse and weigh twice
as much.
Yet stature has never been an
obstacle for Stonehouse, who
stands tall among his admiring
teammates. The outgoing 19-
year-old has always been able to
keep the size issue in perspective,
and in fact, he made it one of the
crucial factors in his ultimate
decision to attend Stanford over
Michigan, UCLA, and Syracuse.
"I would love to play in the
, pros, but I realize that the solid
educational background that
Stanford offers will give me some
thing to fall back on if that doesn't
pan out," Stonehouse said.
A political science major who
would like to attend either law or

business school, Stonehouse has
achieved a balance that embodies
the ideals of college athletics.
But "the pros" those magical
words that could only signify the
National Football League keep
recurring like a vivid dream when
talking about a talent like that
which Stonehouse possesses.
Imagine the glory of being drafted
two months prior to graduation
and signing a multi-year contract
to render your services for a stag
gering seven-figure salary?
Not so fast Stonehouse, aver
aged 43 yards a punt during his
final high school season (including
an 80-yard effort), made 10 of 12
field goals (among those a 50-
yarder) and did an admirable job
on kickoffs for a team that was
ranked No. 1 in the nation for five
weeks. He was indeed a veritable
juggernaut coming out of his
hometown of Pasadena.

After all, how many football
players can boast, like this young
man can, of consulting with for
mer NFL great Dick Butkus
(whose son Matt was a teammate
of Stonehouse on the Loyola
Cubs) and a well-traveled profes
sional kicking coach (Ray Pelfrey
of Reno, Nev.) before entering the
college ranks?
Certainly, the resources, as well
as the odds, were stacked in favor
of Stonehouse when he arrived at
Stanford a year ago, and he has
done little to bring about the
reversal of his kind fate.
As a true freshman, Stone
house averaged 37.6 yards on 49
punts for Stanford in 1989. He
boomed a 61-yard kick against
Utah and had seven punts travel
over 50 yards, the conventional
yardstick by which excellence in
punting is measured.
So far in 1990, Stonehouse is
still producing long-distance
punts despite some observations
that his performance has some
how fallen off from that of a year

ago.
"He has improved his yardage
but has not yet punted as well as
he could because his hang time is
not as good as it was last year,"
special teams coach Chris Foer
ster said. "But he has always
worked commendably hard and
has the ability to be the best
punter in the [Pacific 10 Confer
ence]."

Coach Denny Green agreed
with Foerster and also added that
Stonehouse's timing has been off
but should improve over the last
five games of this season.
How, then, would Stonehouse
rate his performance this year,
particularly in last week's disap
pointing 37-22 loss to USC?
"I feel that Thad my bad game
and that this week's game with
Washington is important for both
myself and the team," Stonehouse
said. "I want to see if I can come
out and have a great game, while
the team needs a win to keep their
bowl hopes alive."
An honest appraisal from a
man who has strong basic values.
Witness: Stonehouse gives much
of the credit for his athletic suc
cess to his father, who got him
started playing the game he loves
and hired Pelfrey specifically to
prepare his son for the transition
into a pure punter.
As a matter of fact, Stonehouse
admitted that his choice of Stan
ford over the numerous other
schools by which he was recruited
was influenced by the campus' rel
ative proximity to Southern Cali
fornia, where his father and
brother (who now kicks for Loyola
High) reside.

So how does Stonehouse like
his position in this awkward spot
light, where he is the "last line of
offense." for the {-Stanford Cardi
nal? How does he view himself in
regard to being a safety valve, a
"punter" in the true sense of the

word?
"I want people to trust in me
when we don't get the first down,"
Stonehouse said.
Ah, trust, yet another steady
virtue. With that trust, it is possi
ble that Paul Stonehouse could
become a leader on Stanford's

football team in his two remaining
years.
If he does, let it be known that
this comparatively small "stone"
will be more than a mere paper
weight in holding down a corner
stone of the Stanford football pro
gram.

coach helping to aid his progress, the true sophmore has garnered
the tools to be a successful Collegiate punter. Stonehouse has not
been able to match his high school numbers, but remains confident
that he can perform for the team.
It goes something like, "I'll just
have to punt."
We have all heard this expres
sion of lament from the mouth of
someone who feels as if he or she
were out of options, with their
back to the wall and time running
short. Paul Stonehouse has heard
it as well.
Stonehouse, to be exact, heard
the ciy from the Stanford football
program about two years ago,
when he was earning his reputa
tion as the No. 1 prep punter/
placekicker in the nation during
his senior year at Loyola High
School in Los Angeles.
The rest, as they say, is history,
and both Stonehouse and the Car
dinal have been getting their kicks
out of the relationship ever since.
To hear his name Stone
house brings to mind the image
of a middle linebacker. Yet stand
ing at 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds,
Stanford's punter has a fragile
build for someone with a pen
chant for the pigskin. This
becomes clearer in light of the fact
that some of the other men who
don the cardinal and white each
week are nearly one foot taller
than Stonehouse and weigh twice
as much.
Yet stature has never been an
obstacle for Stonehouse, who
stands tall among his admiring
teammates. The outgoing 19-
year-old has always been able to
keep the size issue in perspective,
and in fact, he made it one of the
crucial factors in his ultimate
decision to attend Stanford over
Michigan, UCLA, and Syracuse.
"I would love to play in the
, pros, but I realize that the solid
educational background that
Stanford offers will give me some
thing to fall back on if that doesn't
pan out," Stonehouse said.
A political science major who
would like to attend either law or

business school, Stonehouse has
achieved a balance that embodies
the ideals of college athletics.
But "the pros" those magical
words that could only signify the
National Football League keep
recurring like a vivid dream when
talking about a talent like that
which Stonehouse possesses.
Imagine the glory of being drafted
two months prior to graduation
and signing a multi-year contract
to render your services for a stag
gering seven-figure salary?
Not so fast Stonehouse, aver
aged 43 yards a punt during his
final high school season (including
an 80-yard effort), made 10 of 12
field goals (among those a 50-
yarder) and did an admirable job
on kickoffs for a team that was
ranked No. 1 in the nation for five
weeks. He was indeed a veritable
juggernaut coming out of his
hometown of Pasadena.

After all, how many football
players can boast, like this young
man can, of consulting with for
mer NFL great Dick Butkus
(whose son Matt was a teammate
of Stonehouse on the Loyola
Cubs) and a well-traveled profes
sional kicking coach (Ray Pelfrey
of Reno, Nev.) before entering the
college ranks?
Certainly, the resources, as well
as the odds, were stacked in favor
of Stonehouse when he arrived at
Stanford a year ago, and he has
done little to bring about the
reversal of his kind fate.
As a true freshman, Stone
house averaged 37.6 yards on 49
punts for Stanford in 1989. He
boomed a 61-yard kick against
Utah and had seven punts travel
over 50 yards, the conventional
yardstick by which excellence in
punting is measured.
So far in 1990, Stonehouse is
still producing long-distance
punts despite some observations
that his performance has some
how fallen off from that of a year

ago.
"He has improved his yardage
but has not yet punted as well as
he could because his hang time is
not as good as it was last year,"
special teams coach Chris Foer
ster said. "But he has always
worked commendably hard and
has the ability to be the best
punter in the [Pacific 10 Confer
ence]."

Coach Denny Green agreed
with Foerster and also added that
Stonehouse's timing has been off
but should improve over the last
five games of this season.
How, then, would Stonehouse
rate his performance this year,
particularly in last week's disap
pointing 37-22 loss to USC?
"I feel that Thad my bad game
and that this week's game with
Washington is important for both
myself and the team," Stonehouse
said. "I want to see if I can come
out and have a great game, while
the team needs a win to keep their
bowl hopes alive."
An honest appraisal from a
man who has strong basic values.
Witness: Stonehouse gives much
of the credit for his athletic suc
cess to his father, who got him
started playing the game he loves
and hired Pelfrey specifically to
prepare his son for the transition
into a pure punter.
As a matter of fact, Stonehouse
admitted that his choice of Stan
ford over the numerous other
schools by which he was recruited
was influenced by the campus' rel
ative proximity to Southern Cali
fornia, where his father and
brother (who now kicks for Loyola
High) reside.

So how does Stonehouse like
his position in this awkward spot
light, where he is the "last line of
offense." for the {-Stanford Cardi
nal? How does he view himself in
regard to being a safety valve, a
"punter" in the true sense of the

word?
"I want people to trust in me
when we don't get the first down,"
Stonehouse said.
Ah, trust, yet another steady
virtue. With that trust, it is possi
ble that Paul Stonehouse could
become a leader on Stanford's

football team in his two remaining
years.
If he does, let it be known that
this comparatively small "stone"
will be more than a mere paper
weight in holding down a corner
stone of the Stanford football pro
gram.
