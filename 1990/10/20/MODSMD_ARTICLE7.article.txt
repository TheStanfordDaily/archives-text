# Lewis powers into records

Close your eyes Stanford fans.
Here comes another spectacular
athlete that Cardinal recruiters
just missed.
Washington senior tailback
Greg Lewis like a certain quar
terback who chose to attend USC
instead of Stanford and subse
quently shredded the Cardinal
secondary last weekend nar
rowed his choices down to Stan
ford and Washington. Then, he
decided to stay away from the
Farm.

"Stanford is a great educa-.
tional institution," Lewis said. "A
degree means a lot from there."
However, Lewis decided that
remaining near the brisk breezes
and the damp Seattle environ
ment was more important.
"I have received a lot from the
Seattle community," he said. "I
wanted to give a little back to
them."

As a four-year letterman at
Ingraham High School in Seattle,
Lewis had already made a name
for himself in the Northwest. He
averaged 6.7 yards a carry as a
senior and garnered 1,293 yards
rushing. He led his squad into the
state AAA playoffs with a 7-3
record. At the end of the season,
he was named All-State, All-
Metro, and honorable mention
All-America.

Four years later, Lewis is again
receiving extensive media cover
age, except this time it is on the
national level. Lewis is being con
sidered for Ail-American honors
and is mentioned as a candidate
for the Heisman Trophy.
"I don't pay any attention to
the Heisman it's a media
award," Lewis said. "It's not as
important to me as the next game,
but I'll let the media have its fun."
While the media is having its
fun selecting who will receive its
awards, Lewis will be having his
own fun in continuing his assault
on the Husky record books. He
started the season in the No. 11
spot on the all-time Husky rush

ing list, but his average of 135.5
yards per game this season has
pushed him into the No. 6 spot.
He needs just 88 yards to move up
on the list and is on pace to finish
his career in the No. 2 position.
More significantly, Lewis is bid
ding to become the first Washing
ton back to put together succes
sive 1,000-yard seasons. With 813
yards already this year, he should
shatter Steele's 1978 single-sea
son rushing mark of 1,111 yards.
"Greg is a player who is trying
to do his job well in all areas,"
Washington coach Don James
said. "He is a great team player."
According to James, Lewis can
be counted on not only to rack up
yardage but also to make the key
block for pass protection.
As far as finding the holes that
his offensive line has opened up
this season, Lewis has responded
to his teammates' execution with
most effective running. He leads
the Pacific 10 Conference and
ranks third in NCAA Division I-A
rushing. Lewis has rushed for
over 100 yards in every game this
season.

"If he breaks through the line,
he will gain yardage," Stanford
coach Denny Green said. "He's
not the type of guy you can knock
down easily."
Unlike Cardinal standout Glyn
Milburn who is gaining a reputa
tion for his quick, flashy running,
Lewis has established himself as a
powerful, hard-nosed back who
will find the opening in the offen
sive line and push his way upfield.
Despite increasing his speed in
each year since entering Washing
ton so that he now can run a 4.4-
second 40-yard dash, his greatest
asset remains the ability to read
the play and the movement of his
offensive line. Lewis puts the
credits for his tremendous success
this season on the shoulders of his
line.

"If I run for over 100 yards,
then we know that our offense is
playing well," he said. "It means
our offensive line is opening up
big holes, and our passing game is
effective."

If he is marking up over 100
yards, it also means that the
Huskies are most likely on the
way to recording a victory. During
his 11 100-yard efforts, Washing
ton has won 10 games. The sole
loss came against Colorado earlier
this year.
"He doesn't have the darting
quickness like Milburn," James
said. "If he was a half-step
quicker, he would break longer
runs ... but I'm not exactly ready
to trade Lewis."

Next season, however, James
will have to sit down and figure
out how his team will operate
without him. Lewis will receive
his degree in political science in
June and remains uncertain
about what the future will bring
to him.

While NFL scouts have been
watching him perform,' Lewis rec
ognizes that he will need to sit
down at the end of this season and
look at his different options.
"I would like to get the oppor
tunity to play in the NFL, but I
have made no concrete decisions,"
he said. "I have taken law classes
and, with my GPA, will have the
opportunity to go to law school."
For now, Lewis has all of his
attention focused on today's
game. With each game in the Pac
-10 having such a great effect on
the race to the Rose Bowl, Wash
ington has approached every sin
gle contest with heightened con
centration. The Huskies realize
that the path to the Rose Bowl lies
under their control.
"For us, it is a one-game season
right now," Lewis said. "Stanford
is both the only and the best team
on our schedule."
After having trouble slowing
down USC's tailbacks last week
end, the Cardinal will have its
hands full in today's matchup.
Stanford needs to find away, first,
to slow down Lewis and, second,
to gang-tackle him so he does not
break out of the pack.
"This game means a lot to me,"
Lewis said. "Any time you line up
as a football player and as a
competitor you want to win."

centration. The Huskies realize
that the path to the Rose Bowl lies
under their control.
"For us, it is a one-game season
right now," Lewis said. "Stanford
is both the only and the best team
on our schedule."
After having trouble slowing
down USC's tailbacks last week
end, the Cardinal will have its
hands full in today's matchup.
Stanford needs to find away, first,
to slow down Lewis and, second,
to gang-tackle him so he does not
break out of the pack.
"This game means a lot to me,"
Lewis said. "Any time you line up
as a football player and as a
competitor you want to win."

The University of Washington's Greg Lewis has been running away
from opponents all season with great success. Lewis is currently
leading the Pac-10, and is third in the nation in rushing at 135.5
yards a game. The senior from Seattle is both an All—America and
Heisman Trophy candidate, and is line for a second consecutive
1,000 yard season.
Close your eyes Stanford fans.
Here comes another spectacular
athlete that Cardinal recruiters
just missed.
Washington senior tailback
Greg Lewis like a certain quar
terback who chose to attend USC
instead of Stanford and subse
quently shredded the Cardinal
secondary last weekend nar
rowed his choices down to Stan
ford and Washington. Then, he
decided to stay away from the
Farm.

"Stanford is a great educa-.
tional institution," Lewis said. "A
degree means a lot from there."
However, Lewis decided that
remaining near the brisk breezes
and the damp Seattle environ
ment was more important.
"I have received a lot from the
Seattle community," he said. "I
wanted to give a little back to
them."

As a four-year letterman at
Ingraham High School in Seattle,
Lewis had already made a name
for himself in the Northwest. He
averaged 6.7 yards a carry as a
senior and garnered 1,293 yards
rushing. He led his squad into the
state AAA playoffs with a 7-3
record. At the end of the season,
he was named All-State, All-
Metro, and honorable mention
All-America.

Four years later, Lewis is again
receiving extensive media cover
age, except this time it is on the
national level. Lewis is being con
sidered for Ail-American honors
and is mentioned as a candidate
for the Heisman Trophy.
"I don't pay any attention to
the Heisman it's a media
award," Lewis said. "It's not as
important to me as the next game,
but I'll let the media have its fun."
While the media is having its
fun selecting who will receive its
awards, Lewis will be having his
own fun in continuing his assault
on the Husky record books. He
started the season in the No. 11
spot on the all-time Husky rush

ing list, but his average of 135.5
yards per game this season has
pushed him into the No. 6 spot.
He needs just 88 yards to move up
on the list and is on pace to finish
his career in the No. 2 position.
More significantly, Lewis is bid
ding to become the first Washing
ton back to put together succes
sive 1,000-yard seasons. With 813
yards already this year, he should
shatter Steele's 1978 single-sea
son rushing mark of 1,111 yards.
"Greg is a player who is trying
to do his job well in all areas,"
Washington coach Don James
said. "He is a great team player."
According to James, Lewis can
be counted on not only to rack up
yardage but also to make the key
block for pass protection.
As far as finding the holes that
his offensive line has opened up
this season, Lewis has responded
to his teammates' execution with
most effective running. He leads
the Pacific 10 Conference and
ranks third in NCAA Division I-A
rushing. Lewis has rushed for
over 100 yards in every game this
season.

"If he breaks through the line,
he will gain yardage," Stanford
coach Denny Green said. "He's
not the type of guy you can knock
down easily."
Unlike Cardinal standout Glyn
Milburn who is gaining a reputa
tion for his quick, flashy running,
Lewis has established himself as a
powerful, hard-nosed back who
will find the opening in the offen
sive line and push his way upfield.
Despite increasing his speed in
each year since entering Washing
ton so that he now can run a 4.4-
second 40-yard dash, his greatest
asset remains the ability to read
the play and the movement of his
offensive line. Lewis puts the
credits for his tremendous success
this season on the shoulders of his
line.

"If I run for over 100 yards,
then we know that our offense is
playing well," he said. "It means
our offensive line is opening up
big holes, and our passing game is
effective."

If he is marking up over 100
yards, it also means that the
Huskies are most likely on the
way to recording a victory. During
his 11 100-yard efforts, Washing
ton has won 10 games. The sole
loss came against Colorado earlier
this year.
"He doesn't have the darting
quickness like Milburn," James
said. "If he was a half-step
quicker, he would break longer
runs ... but I'm not exactly ready
to trade Lewis."

Next season, however, James
will have to sit down and figure
out how his team will operate
without him. Lewis will receive
his degree in political science in
June and remains uncertain
about what the future will bring
to him.

While NFL scouts have been
watching him perform,' Lewis rec
ognizes that he will need to sit
down at the end of this season and
look at his different options.
"I would like to get the oppor
tunity to play in the NFL, but I
have made no concrete decisions,"
he said. "I have taken law classes
and, with my GPA, will have the
opportunity to go to law school."
For now, Lewis has all of his
attention focused on today's
game. With each game in the Pac
-10 having such a great effect on
the race to the Rose Bowl, Wash
ington has approached every sin
gle contest with heightened con
centration. The Huskies realize
that the path to the Rose Bowl lies
under their control.
"For us, it is a one-game season
right now," Lewis said. "Stanford
is both the only and the best team
