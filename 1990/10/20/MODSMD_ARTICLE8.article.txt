# Washington/Stanford Matchups
## 
### 
Lewis has marked up hard
nosed yardage consistently to lead
the Pac-10 in rushing. He has
averaged 5.5 yards per carry and
135.5 yards per game. The Cardi
nal defense, led by Tunney, must
not allow Lewis to continue his
march to the Pac-10 rushing title
if Stanford hopes to stay close on
the scoreboard. Tunney will need
to slow down Lewis and look for
help from the rest of the defensive
core to bring him to the ground.

Whenever a punting team is on
the field, expect to see some excit
ing fakes, bursts and spins coming
back the other way. Milburn and
Bryant sit atop of the Pac-10 in
punt returns, with 16.4 and 15.6
yard averages, respectively.
Bryant suits up as the second
string tailback to Lewis, but, after
his 82-yard touchdown return
earlier this season, opposing
squads know who he is. Milburn,
on the other hand, is a well-known
Cardinal threat at every moment
during the game. He has broken
one return for 73 yards and has
been one step away on multiple
occasions.

So far this season, no squad has
come close to stopping McCaffrey
from recording All-American
statistics. McCaffrey's 8.2 recep
tions per game lead the nation and
his 115.4 receiving yards put him
in the second position. Briscoe will
be giving away six inches to
McCaffrey, but his 5-foot-11
frame has not slowed him down
this year. Briscoe is tied for the
Pac-10 lead with 5 interceptions.
McCaffrey is the most instrumen
tal part of the Cardinal's offensive
success, and Briscoe will look to
dismantle this key joint.

Vardell and the rest of the Car
dinal rushing corps ran into a
solid wall of Trojan defenders last
weekend, and, after the first quar
ter, the entire offense sputtered
because of it. The Huskies, led by
Hoffman with 43 tackles, present
Vardell with an even steeper chal
lenge. Washington is the top
ranked, Division I-A rushing
defense in the nation, allowing an
average of 47.5 yards a game.
Vardell will need to bully his way
past Hoffman and his defensive
teammates if the Cardinal hopes
to present a balanced, effective
attack.

Fraley has also played a key
role in the Huskies unmatched
defensive effort with 42 tackles.
Not only has this defense stopped
the run, but it has also stymied
the pass. Washington leads the
Pac-10 in pass efficiency defense.
Gillingham, the sole senior start
ing on the Cardinal line, will need
to find some way to hold off the
Huskies' pass rush in order to give
Palumbis some time to look down
field. The winner of the battle in
the trenches will walk away from
this game victorious.

Hey, we have Nobel prize winners
and world record holders, we are
the best and the brightest; why
lower ourselves by doing
somthing so ordinary as rooting
on our football team. Besides,
cheering is so, so ... state school.
We dance around after a touch
down don't we? We cheer when
the team actually does something,
what more do you need? Look at
that UW fan. He paints his face,
and he is not even a freshman
what a geek. He probably follows
his school's yell-leaders too, the
loser. Bet he can't analyze Dante.
Probably won't get into a good
grad school either.

Fraley has also played a key
role in the Huskies unmatched
defensive effort with 42 tackles.
Not only has this defense stopped
the run, but it has also stymied
the pass. Washington leads the
Pac-10 in pass efficiency defense.
Gillingham, the sole senior start
ing on the Cardinal line, will need
to find some way to hold off the
Huskies' pass rush in order to give
Palumbis some time to look down
field. The winner of the battle in
the trenches will walk away from
this game victorious.

Hey, we have Nobel prize winners
and world record holders, we are
the best and the brightest; why
lower ourselves by doing
somthing so ordinary as rooting
on our football team. Besides,
cheering is so, so ... state school.
We dance around after a touch
down don't we? We cheer when
the team actually does something,
what more do you need? Look at
that UW fan. He paints his face,
and he is not even a freshman
what a geek. He probably follows
his school's yell-leaders too, the
loser. Bet he can't analyze Dante.
Probably won't get into a good
grad school either.
