We're looking for people who
look at this glass and say:
"There's gotta be other
glasses of water."
Vs
We need people capable of going
beyond half-full or half-empty
thinking. People who see subtleties.
Who are quite frankly bored by easy
answers and off the-shelf solutions.
People who are constantly
challenging their own thinking and
are thirsty for new ideas and
knowledge.
You'll have a degree from a top
school. Getting a job won't really be
an issue. The question is: which job?
Which industry?
You don't want to get locked
into one area and then discover
three to five years from now that you
don't like it. By then you've invested
too much.
Andersen Consulting offers you
the chance to work on a variety
of projects—with ciients in a wide
range of industries.
We are the leader in helping
organizations apply information
technology to their business advan
tage. Every hour of every business
day, we implement a solution to help
one of our more than 5,000 clients
worldwide.
What makes that possible is the
quality of our people. And the quality
of our training. We're known for both.
Because business and tech
nology are ever-changing, we see
training as a continuing process.
And our $123-milhon Center for
Professional Education in St. Charles,
Illinois, is just one measure of our
commitment. We train you for a
career—not just a job.
Are you the kind of person we're
talking about? The kind of person
with an unquenchable desire for
challenge and professional growth?
If so, come talk to us. And
find out more about a career with
Andersen Consulting.
