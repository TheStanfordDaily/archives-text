The toughest job
you'll ever love
PUT YOUR DEGREE TO WORK
WHERE IT CAN DO A WORLD
OF GOOD
Your first job after graduation should offer
you more than just a paycheck. We can
offer you an experience that lasts a life
time.
Working together with people in a dif
ferent culture is something you'll never
forget. It's a learning experience everyone
can benefit from.
In Science or Engineering, Education,
Agriculture, or Health, Peace Corps pro
jects in developing countries around the
world are bringing help where it's needed.
If you're graduating this year, look into a
unique opportunity to put your degree to
work where it can do a world of good. Look
into Peace Corps.
