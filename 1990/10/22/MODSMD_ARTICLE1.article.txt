# It's official: Overseas program in Tours will close
## 
### Miranda Doyle 
After months of debate, Stanford
announced Friday it will close the Over
seas Center in Tours, France, next year,
saving the University about $120,000
annually.
In its place, the University will estab
lish a second tier of the current Paris pro
gram.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas made the decision on the
recommendation of the Program Com
mittee on Overseas Studies. He rejected
the option, preferred by the French
Department, of sharing the Tours center
with Carnegie Mellon University.

The current Paris program, which
requires two years of French and concen
trates on literature and culture, will con
tinue to accept about 20 students. Begin
ning next fall, 30 students with at least
two quarters of French experience will be
placed in the new second tier which will
emphasize language.
The consolidation of the Paris and
Tours programs will reduce the total
number of spaces in France open to stu
dents from around 140 to 100 annually,
or 50 spaces each fall and winter quarter.
"Closing the Tours campus would free
up money to be allocated elsewhere,"
Thomas said, mentioning Berlin and
Kyoto as possible centers to be strength

ened. Stanford is also considering start
ing programs in the Soviet Union and
China, although no negotiations have
taken place yet.
The program committee has been con
sidering its options since May, when
Thomas deferred a decision on the Tours
campus because he said he needed more
information.
Accepting the Carnegie Mellon plan
would have saved Stanford around
$160,000 annually. About 40 student
spaces would also have been lost under
this plan.
Thomas justified the decision, saying
sharing a campus would have meant
extra administrative costs. In addition, he

said he believes the cultural richness of
Paris will allow students to experience a
broader cross-section of the world.
But Thomas admitted the French
department "has a clear preference for
staying in Tours."
The department's reasons include the
welcoming environment in the smaller
city, the greater opportunity for learning
about French culture and the dedicated
staff, Thomas explained. He said he has
met with the department three times to
discuss the closure and "asked them to be
supportive."
"We recommended that the Tours pro
gram be continued," said French and Ital
ian Department Chair Jean-Marie Apos

tolides. "It is easier to develop language
skills in a smaller town," he noted.
"Closer contacts with the French people
are possible."
But he said the department does
understand Thomas' position on the bud
get and will do its best to support the deci
sion.
Kimberly Loffer, a senior meyoring in
French, agreed with Apostolides' assess
ment of the advantages of Tours. Loffer
spent last winter and spring quarters
there.
