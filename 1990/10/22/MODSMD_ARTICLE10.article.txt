# Gorbachev is on shaky ground

### 
MOSCOW (AP) - More
than 30 Russian groups united
yesterday to form the nation's
largest political bloc opposing
the Communist Party, and the
new movement demanded that
Kremlin leaders resign.

National legislators and key
officials of the Russian republic
attended the two-day founding
conference of the Democratic
Russia Movement, the broadest
grouping yet to openly chal
lenge President Mikhail Gor

bachev.
But the conference glossed
over sharply divergent views
among the republic's various
groups, and gave them the right
to pull out of the movement.
The movement's chances of
becoming a unified political
force were uncertain.
Many small parties have
been created since the Commu
nist Party surrendered its con
stitutionally guaranteed
monopoly on power last Febru
ary. None, however, have any
where near the Communists' 18
million members.
The new movement joined
Christian Democrats with labor
unions, scholars with peasants,
and Red Army officers with dis
abled veterans. They united
around a sweeping platform
that called for Russian
sovereignty as well as the resig
nation of Gorbachev and his
prime minister, Nikolai
Ryzhkov.
The platform underlined
growing disenchantment with
the Soviet leader.
The conference also formed a
commission to organize "civil
disobedience" if necessary. It
was not clear under what condi
tions civil disobedience would
be used.
It delegated another commis
sion to find ways to create a
market economy in Russia, the
largest and most populous of
the 15 Soviet republics.

movie theater In downtown Moscow yesterday to support the
first congress of the Democratic Russia Movement, designed
to rival the Communist Party. The slogan reads: "Ryzhkov must
resign."
