# Arab stabs three Israelis in revenge
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - An Arab
laborer shouting "God is Great!"
stabbed three Israelis to death
yesterday as he rampaged
through a Jewish neighborhood,
apparently seeking revenge for
the Temple Mount killings, police
said.
One victim managed to shoot
and wound the attacker, who was
then seized by furious residents,
ending the rampage in the Baka
area of southern Jerusalem.
The attack inflamed tensions
in the capital and brought in a
stream of police reinforcements as
vengeance-seeking Jews took
briefly to the streets.
Angry Israeli youths stoned
Arab-owned cars on a Jerusalem
highway. Shouts of "Death to the
Arabs!" resounded in the streets
of Baka.
Police spokesman Aharon
Elchayani said his forces would
bar Arabs from traveling into
Jerusalem today.
Two Palestinian factions
claimed responsibility for the
attack, but police said they
believed the assailant acted alone.
The suspect was identified as
Omar Abu Sirhan, a 19-year-old
Arab laborer from the village of
Übbadiyeh in the occupied West
Bank.
Police said his motive appar
ently was revenge for the Oct. 8
blood bath on the Temple Mount,
in which Israeli police fired at
stone-throwing Palestinians,
killing at least 19 of them.
Avi Cohen, the officer leading
the interrogation, said the
attacker seemed to have chosen

his victims at random. He said
Abu Sirhan had no known crimi
nal background.
Israel television showed scenes
of Abu Sirhan being led down a
corridor by policemen. He wore a
bloodstained hospital smock, his
head and leg were bandaged and
his ankles were chained.
Shouting "Allahu Akbar" —
Arabic for "God Is Great" — the
attacker killed an 18-year-old
woman soldier, a 43-year-old gar
den nursery owner and a 28-year
old member of an elite police anti
terrorism unit, police said.
Defense Minister Moshe Arens
voiced fears that Arab-Jewish
communal violence was reducing
prospects of a Mideast peace set
tlement. He told Israel television
that he feared "a chasm is open
• - >1
ing.
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek
appealed for calm, saying the
attack was "a tough test of peo
ple's patience and tolerance."
Some Israeli politicians
demanded broader powers for
troops and police to fire on attack
ers. They also said the off-duty
policeman should have immedi
ately shot the assailant dead.
"If someone attacks with
intent to kill, he should be killed
on the spot," Agriculture Minister
Raphael Eitan said.
Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's senior adviser, Avi
Pazner, said the U.N. Security
Council's condemnation of Israel
for the Temple Mount clash cre
ated "an atmosphere that incites
extremist actions against inno
cent Jewish civilians."
