# Aoun supporter slain in Beirut

### 
BAABDA, Lebanon (AP) — Gunmen burst into
the home of a top supporter of Christian Gen.
Michel Aoun yesterday and shot him, his wife and
two sons to death, police said. Only an 11-month-old
girl survived.
The daybreak massacre of Dany Chamoun and
his family in their suburban Beirut apartment came
a week after a Syrian and Lebanese government
troops crushed Aoun's mutiny in

Lebanon's Christian enclave.
Chamoun, a Maronite Catholic
and the son of late President
Camille Chamoun, was one of the
most outspoken critics of Presi
dent Elias Hrawi and Syria's mil
itary presence in Lebanon.
He also was at odds with
Christian warlord Samir Geagea,
whose Lebanese Forces militia
fought a four-month war with
Aoun's troops early this year for
mastery of the Christian areas of
east Beirut.
No group immediately claimed
responsibility for the slayings,
which were branded by Christian
and Moslem leaders alike as an
attempt to block a plan to end the
15-year-old civil war.

Aoun took refuge a week ago in
the French Embassy. France has granted him asy
lum, but the Lebanese government insists he stay
and stand trial for alleged crimes, including the theft
of $75 million from the state treasury.
Five uniformed gunmen, using silencer-equipped
9mm pistols, riddled Chamoun, 56; his wife, Ingrid
Abdel-Noor, 35, and their sons, Tarek, 7, and Julien,
5, with bullets, according to police.
They said the 5-year-old was taken to a nearby
hospital and died a short time later. Of the family,
only Chamoun's daughter, Tamara, escaped
unharmed.
Reporters saw the baby being cradled by her
weeping Lebanese governess at the apartment in
Baabda, east of Beirut.

"I am shocked by the horrific slayings," Hrawi
was quoted by several Beirut radio stations as say
ing. "That's a crime against the state aimed at sabo
taging efforts to reunite the country and army after
Aoun's ouster."
Radios said Hrawi made the comment in Damas
cus, where he is talking with Syrian President Hafez
Assad on how to enforce an Arab League-brokered

plan aimed at ending the civil war
between Moslems and Christians.
"We have declared that the
peace process is open to all to join
after the end of Aoun's mutiny
and that we should bury the past
and begin a new era of frater
nity," Hrawi was quoted as say
ing.
"Today's crime is a stab in the
back."
In Paris, Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas expressed horror
at the slayings.
"Dany Chamoun had opened a
perspective toward reconciliation
in Lebanon," Dumas said. "It's
this chance they wanted to assas
sinate."
The British-educated Cha
moun made his political debut

soon after the outbreak of
Lebanon's civil war in 1975. He was appointed secre
tary of defense of his father's rightist Christian
National Liberal Party and commander of the
party's "Tigers" militia.
Chamoun forged friendships with Druse warlord
Walid Jumblatt and Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion Chairman Yasser Arafat's security chief, Ali
Hassan Salameh, who was assassinated in Moslem
west Beirut in 1979.
These friendships helped free scores of kidnap
victims in Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors
during the conflict.
Chamoun — who loved hunting, sports cars and
scuba-diving — often advocated diplomacy over the
gunbarrel.
