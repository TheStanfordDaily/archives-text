Housing office
shows streamlining
can make sense

Through a series of
changes in the past few
weeks, the Housing Office
has demonstrated that streamlin
ing can be successful, after all.
By deciding to eliminate the
physical drawing of numbers in the
Draw and axing the antiquated
system of housing deposits, the
office has given us an example of
the best effects of our current bud
get cuts: the careful trimming of
superfluous programs while
retaining the quality of University
life.
While the switch to a computer
ized lottery will definitely elimi
nate the excitement and mystique
of using Ouija boards and lucky
rabbits' feet to get the best num
bers, it will also eliminate the
blame for poor numbers usually
heaped upon the person who
reaches in to get the number.
At first, students may miss the
feeling of control in actually
pulling the number out of the bin
themselves, but hopefully we'll all
understand that odds, whether
they come from a trash can filled
with cards or a random number
generator hidden in the innards of
a computer, are just odds.
At the very least, this switch will
help the University and students
to save time and money. At the
very best, this switch will help to
make the entire process a little less
stressful.
By making the Draw less of a
production, students may treat the
housing process as more of a rou
tine.
Students seem to already have

their hands full with preventing
hurt feelings as they form their
Draw groups and choose their pref
erences. Having a number
assigned may remove some of the
burden of receiving housing.
Eliminating the Draw produc
tion will also give X-TV 20 or so
extra hours to air some of its more
original and in-depth work. X-TV
reporters, staff and crew will also
be free to work on creative and
high-quality projects instead of
having to repeatedly ask hundreds
of people where they're going to
live next year.
A possible way to create some
more excitement would be to place
a few numbers under 1,000 in the
unguaranteed pool, just to give
everyone hope.
On the down side, the switch to
a computerized system may pose
problems if students can manipu
late the computer program that
assigns numbers. It should be
interesting to see what percentage
of the top 100 numbers go to com
puter science majors this spring.
In the same vein, by doing away
with the housing deposits, both the
University and the students are
relieved of the burden of paying
the deposit in the first place, then
going through the hassle of getting
the deposit back upon graduation.
Finally, the Housing Office
understands that the entire pro
cess is more easily handled with
the general University billing.
The above changes, when com
bined with last spring's pushing
back of the Draw to after resident
assistant and fraternity selections,
demonstrate that the Housing
Office is willing to make changes
that will improve the system for
all.
Its actions should stand as a tes
tament to the fact that the Univer
sity can streamline numerous
areas without affecting important
services and programs.
