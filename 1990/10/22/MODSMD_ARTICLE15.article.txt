Philosophy behind
new alcohol policy
irritating, stupid
In the heat of controversy regarding
the new federal policies concerning ille
gal drug and alcohol use, there has been
a flurry of speculation about what these
policies will do to the atmosphere here at
Stanford.
After talking to many, from veteran
resident fellows to the new frosh, I get a
sense that people are concerned enough
about maintaining an open and support
ive environment, that not much will
change outside of the creative implemen
tation of new, non-University sanc
tioned, ways of getting alcohol.

What irritates me most
is the entire philoso
phy underlying the fed
eral government's
imposition. Losing fed
eral money would
mean that good pro
grams would suffer.

No one seems interested in a strict
policing of the dorms, especially not the
RAs or RFs. And I don't think we'll be
having people hiding behind closed doors
â€” at least I hope not.
So far, I think that the University has
handled the situation with a certain
degree of grace under the pressure of los
ing federal money.
Our old "friend" William Bennett,
now drug czar (whatever that choice of
title is supposed to indicate) probably

wouldn't mind finding fault with
Stanford and saying "Aha! I was right."
What irritates me most is the entire
philosophy underlying the federal gov
ernment's imposition. Losing federal
money would mean that good programs
would suffer.
I would hate to think that research
into, say, artificial hearts would suffer if
some officer found a freshman drinking
at a University-sponsored party.
This just doesn't make sense.
Although I agree that underage drinking
and drug use are illegal, and Stanford is
not a refuge from the law, there is a fun
damental inconsistency between the
"crime" and the "punishment."
There would be one very effective way
to show the government the hypocrisy of
the entire policy.
If they plan to withhold money if col
leges can't prove that they are drug and
alcohol free, why don't we withhold taxes
until Congress proves to us that they
themselves are drug and alcohol free?
I am certain that would be a much
more difficult proof and would send
many of them behind closed doors. If
they are taking such measures to secure
constituencies and popular vote (sur
prise, surprise), it is sad that people are
voting the way they are, and even sadder
that others aren't voting at all.

Stanford could, use
debate on domestic
partner controversy
In response to the open letter to
President Kennedy from Kenny and
Brandi Ammann in the Oct. 16 Daily in
regard to the Domestic Partner ruling, I
want to commend them for openly
expressing their reservations regarding
the issue. I'm sure they're not the only
ones with such concerns.

While I and many others do not agree
with them and applaud the courage of
the Trustees for passing the Domestic
Partners regulation, I do believe there
needs to be an in-depth conversation
regarding these matters in the Stanford
community.
In order to assist making this happen,
Lutheran Campus Ministry, Memorial
Church, Escondido Village and the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center have planned three forums enti
tled "Living Differently and Living
Together" to be held in the Escondido
Village Cottage Room at 7:30 p.m. on
Monday evenings.
On October 22 the topic will be "Gay,
Lesbian, Straight and Bi: All Part of the
Stanford Mix;" on October 29,
"Sexuality, Religion, and Ethnicity;" and
on November 5, "Domestic Partners."
We invite all members of the Stanford
community to join us at these forums to
help bring about better understanding of
the issues surrounding the Domestic
Partners ruling.

The Farm should be
agricultural as well
as multicultural
I would like to complain about The
Daily's insensitivity to the needs of an
oppressed minority in the Stanford com
munity: the redneck.
Rural Americans are regularly
ridiculed in classes and virtually ignored
in your publication.
The urban orientation of this institu
tion causes rednecks to feel isolated and
afraid to assert their cultural heritage.
Fortunately, Stanford has great
potential to provide opportunities for the
agriculturally aware.
I propose a redneck theme house to be

located high in the Foothills, where only
a four-wheel-drive pickup truck equipped
with a gun rack can go.
In this unique environment, rednecks
could pursue such rural activities as pos
sum huntin' and tobacco spittin' without
fear of persecution.
Only after the Ag Co-op is established
will rednecks feel empowered to confront
the urbanocentricity of the Farm.

And by the way...
Regarding the picture of coed showers
in the Oct. 18 Daily: Is it possible to
become Shower Associates, and if so,
what are the quarterly rates?
