## Death in the fast lane 
### 
I DON'T NORMALLY THINK about
death, but this past Saturday the
prospect of it did cross my mind sev
ered times as I cowered in the back seat
of a flimsy compact car all the way to
San Francisco, the unsuspecting passen
ger — victim, really — of a reckless
driver.
One of my dormmates had invited me
to go to the City with her and some of
her friends who were visiting from
southern California, one of whom would
be driving.
I didn't give it a second thought and
just hopped in the car, ready to relax and
enjoy myself.
It wasn't until we were roaring up
University Avenue at 55 to 60 miles an
hour that I realized that I had my life to
worry about.
We whizzed by a cop and ran a red
light immediately afterward. The driver
didn't make an attempt of any sort to
slow down before we got to either the
police officer or the traffic signal.
In fact, I'm not sure she even noticed
that they were there. No doubt if she
had, she would have started accelerating.
After we ran the light I started to
pray. I'm not at all religious, but when
faced with what seemed to be imminent
doom, that little matter of faith seemed
rather inconsequential.
I just needed someone or something
to protect me, some higher authority to
hold accountable, and I figured I might
as well say a few words, just in case He,
She or It was out there and listening.
So I looked upward and pleaded with
the Higher Being, whomever or what-

ever it might have been, to please not let
me die, not in an old reddish-orange Toy
ota Celica GT.
My parents were paying some 20-odd
thousand dollars a year to enlighten my
brain, and I didn't want it to end up
splattered all over the asphalt, especially
since I hadn't gotten their money's
worth yet.
I imagined how my family, starting
with my mother, would take it if some
cop knocked on the door and said that I
had been killed in a traffic accident. I
had worked my way through most of my
family by the time we got on the freeway.
I saw all those cars we had the possi
bility of smashing into and I started to
repent for my past misdeeds, but before I
got very far we started weaving through
the moderately heavy traffic at 70, 80
miles per hour, and I couldn't concen
trate on anything besides clutching the
seat belt.
I was only mildly comforted by the
fact that the driver seemed to at least
look before she swerved and that she did
occasionally use the brake.
Besides, I knew from all the horns
that were beeping at us that other
drivers were paying attention and obey
ing traffic rules.
The situation didn't really get much
better in the City. We almost went down
the wrong way on a one-way street and
almost mowed down a few pedestrians in
the parking garage.
At one point, the driver started read
ing anecdotes to us from a book she had
while the guy in the passenger seat
guided the steering wheel.

Granted, the stories were funny, but I
was too worried that we were going to
run into something to.ei\joy them. We
suggested that the driver pay attention
to the car or the road instead.
I've never realized before how helpless
the passengers in a vehicle are, how
much they are at the mercy of the driver.
The even scarier thing is the fact that
you have no way of knowing what kind
of driver a person is until you actually
get into the car.
In my life-harrowing situation, for
example, I was completely unsuspecting.
The question of whether or not my dor
mmate's friend is a good driver never
came into consideration.
Although I suppose there were a few
warning indications that I simply didn't
pay any attention to, like the fact that
this driver made the drive from Los
Angeles to Stanford, usually around six
hours, in only four.
And I should have known by the way
she roared out of the parking lot that my
survival was in doubt, but by then it was
too late.
I'm just grateful to be back in one
piece, suffering from only minor trauma.
I suppose another prayer is in order.

as well say a few words, just in case He,
She or It was out there and listening.
So I looked upward and pleaded with
the Higher Being, whomever or what-

ever it might have been, to please not let
me die, not in an old reddish-orange Toy
ota Celica GT.
My parents were paying some 20-odd
thousand dollars a year to enlighten my
brain, and I didn't want it to end up
splattered all over the asphalt, especially
since I hadn't gotten their money's
worth yet.
I imagined how my family, starting
with my mother, would take it if some
cop knocked on the door and said that I
had been killed in a traffic accident. I
had worked my way through most of my
family by the time we got on the freeway.
I saw all those cars we had the possi
bility of smashing into and I started to
repent for my past misdeeds, but before I
got very far we started weaving through
the moderately heavy traffic at 70, 80
miles per hour, and I couldn't concen
trate on anything besides clutching the
seat belt.
I was only mildly comforted by the
fact that the driver seemed to at least
look before she swerved and that she did
occasionally use the brake.
Besides, I knew from all the horns
that were beeping at us that other
drivers were paying attention and obey
ing traffic rules.
The situation didn't really get much
better in the City. We almost went down
the wrong way on a one-way street and
almost mowed down a few pedestrians in
the parking garage.
At one point, the driver started read
ing anecdotes to us from a book she had
while the guy in the passenger seat
guided the steering wheel.

Granted, the stories were funny, but I
was too worried that we were going to
run into something to.ei\joy them. We
suggested that the driver pay attention
to the car or the road instead.
I've never realized before how helpless
the passengers in a vehicle are, how
much they are at the mercy of the driver.
The even scarier thing is the fact that
you have no way of knowing what kind
of driver a person is until you actually
get into the car.
In my life-harrowing situation, for
example, I was completely unsuspecting.
The question of whether or not my dor
mmate's friend is a good driver never
came into consideration.
Although I suppose there were a few
warning indications that I simply didn't
pay any attention to, like the fact that
this driver made the drive from Los
Angeles to Stanford, usually around six
hours, in only four.
And I should have known by the way
she roared out of the parking lot that my
survival was in doubt, but by then it was
too late.
I'm just grateful to be back in one
piece, suffering from only minor trauma.
I suppose another prayer is in order.
