# Fraternity put on probation
## Sigma Chis investigated following complaints 
### Allison Shue Staff writer 
The University has placed the Sigma Chi fraterni
ty on social probation following alcohol-related inci
dents in which members allegedly caused late-night
disturbances in two dorms.
The administration's decision came during an
investigation by the Interfraternity Council Judicial
Committee of complaints about the incidents.
About four Florence Moore Hall residents com
plained to the IFC after seven Sigma Chi active
members and pledges allegedly ran through Flo Mo
halls making a lot of noise around 2:30 a.m. on Oct.
9, according to IFC Judicial Committee chair Keith
Rabois, a senior.
Another grievance was filed by a Branner Hall
resident assistant for a similar incident around 4
a.m. that night. The complaint alleged that five
Sigma Chis created a commotion in Branner, waking
several residents and causing two RAs to call the
police, according to Rabois.
Rabois said the IFC investigation found alcohol to
be a factor in the incidents.
Social probation is an interim measure taken
while decisions on disciplinary action are pending.
While on probation, a fraternity may not hold social
events without University approval.
Program and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Ramsey-Perez said, "We're just very concerned. This
is no way to start the school year."
Rabois said the administration is also asking the

Judicial Committee to consider a third incident â€”
the alleged harassment of several Flo Mo residents
by Sigma Chi members while waiting in line
overnight for seats at a football game.
University administrators sent a letter Friday to
Sigma Chi President Wes Ehlers, a junior, informing
him of their decision to place the fraternity on social
probation until the Judicial Committee finalized its
investigation and submitted a report recommending
disciplinary action, if applicable.
Ehlers expressed concern that the University is
"jumping to conclusions" by placing the fraternity on
probation before the Judicial Committee has fin
ished its investigation.
The committee met last night to finalize its
report, which will then be forwarded to the IFC
Executive Committee. Rabois added, "I hope that the
University is willing to respect our structure."
According to IFC President Erik Jorgensen, a
senior, the administration is working with the IFC
on a new policy this year that would delegate more
judicial power to the council.
Jorgensen also said he hoped the IFC could work
toward correcting situations like these incidents
with remedies that would benefit the Stanford com
munity, rather than with purely punitive measures.
"Social suspension is not really anything that
helps anyone," he said. "Nobody gains."
Because he is a Sigma Chi member, Jorgensen
said he would remove himself from Executive
Committee decisions concerning the incidents.
