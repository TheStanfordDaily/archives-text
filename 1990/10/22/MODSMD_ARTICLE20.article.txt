## The
						ASSU Nominations Commission Nam Com editorial contained many flaws, but few facts 
### 
THE DAILY'S OCT. 18 EDITORIAL
on the ASSU Nominations Com
mission was sadly devoid of facts.
As members of this year's nominations
commission, we write to provide the
facts of the situation.
The editorial states that "Even now,
many spaces are still open..."
Ironically, two days before the edito
rial, the commission presented its nomi
nations to the ASSU Senate. We nomi
nated students to fill virtually all the
open positions; 76 out of 81 open posi
tions were filled.
The remaining five positions were
graduate positions, and we are asking
the help of the Dean of Graduate Studies
to fill these positions. The nominations
passed with an undivided voice vote.
In regards to publicity and outreach,
we welcome suggestions.
This fall alone, the commission publi
cized with billboard fliers, table-top
fliers, a table at the Opportunities Fair, a
presentation at the ASSU Open House,
announcements at house meetings, as
well as three ads in The Daily.
The final measure of effective public
ity is the response. We received more
than 100 applications.
At the same time, we are constantly
looking for ways to increase awareness of
University committees. To this end, we
had already conducted a survey of all

committee applicants, soliciting input on
ways to improve outreach.
The editorial mentions the"council of
fifteen." For the record, the official
name is the Committee of Fifteen, and
its work is to review the Fundamental
Standard.
This year, during winter auarter, the
Committee of Fifteen will be looking at
the Sexual Assault Task Force Recom
mendations and deciding how they will
affect official University policy.
Students could call the commission,
and many did, to get more specific infor
mation on the committees.
In addition, the commission and the
ASSU Committee Staff Assistant have
already discussed other ideas for making
information accessible to students.
For example, the staff assistant will be
working with this year's student com
mittee members to develop descriptions,
from a student's perspective, for each of
the University committees.
The commission was formed for two
primary reasons:
One, to provide a means for students
to be placed on University committees.
It would be extremely difficult for each
of the more than 100 University commit
tees to advertise and interview indepen
dently.
Two, in many cases it is important
that the student committee members are

selected by other students through a sys
tematic process.
Particularly for committees that make
decisions affecting the entire student
body, such as the Committee of Fifteen,
the selection of students by other stu
dents, rather than by the committees
themselves, is a crucial factor in ensur
ing student representation.
In addition, the commission has
worked with other groups in the ASSU
to help student members provide broad
based student representation on Univer
sity committees.
Members of the commission have
worked on developing ASSU programs
that can serve as resources for the stu
dent members of university committees.
For the first time, student committee
members have the opportunity to work
through the ASSU dorm reps system to
gather input on specific committee issues
this year.
All these efforts are directed toward
realizing the full potential of what the
University committee system could be
for students.
The committee system is a way for
students to keep abreast of the policies
and actions of the University. It is a way
for students to have direct input into the
workings of the University.
With the help of the student members
themselves, we are involved in an ongo-

that the commission has

committee positions in the
abstract, we are, in fact,
highly motivated.

ing process to connect student commit
tee members with the concerns and ideas
of the greater student body.
Finally, the Daily editorial failed to
recognize how much the commission
worked to fill the positions.
Although the editorial said that the
commission has no incentive to fill all
the committee positions in the abstract,
we are, in fact, highly motivated.
Only a highly motivated group of six
students would conduct 100 interviews
over four days. About 25 hours of inter
views were scheduled, with an average of
three commission members present for
each interview.
The individual members of the com
mission spent a sum total of 75 hours
interviewing. Moreover, the five voting
members are volunteers, receiving no
monetary compensation whatsoever.
The editorial calls for the commission

to be abolished immediately. While the
commission completed the bulk of its
work in successfully filling committee
positions this year, in some ways our
work has just begun.
The commission has been and will
continue to be involved in a review of the
current nominations system. In fact, the
commission itself is and will continue to
be a primary motivating force in trying
to improve the present system.
Discussions that had already begun
last year will be furthered and acted
upon. We are working with the adminis
tration, other members of the ASSU and
past members of University committees
as well as past members of the commis
sion.
We welcome anyone who has ideas
and suggestions to engage in the process.
It will be through this process, rather
than a simplistic and unconstructive
"End Nom Com Now" approach, that we
will be able to develop a better system.
