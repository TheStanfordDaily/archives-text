## Card outexecuted by league-leading Huskies, 52-16 Errors plague team in loss 
### David Earnest Senior sports writer Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The final play of Saturday's 52-
16 loss to Washington, an inter
ception of Stanford backup quar
terback John Lynch by Husky free
safety Shane Pahukoa, seemed to
be the only appropriate ending to
a Stanford performance marred
by five Cardinal turnovers. The
three fumbles and two intercep
tions, along with numerous other
penalties, ended any hope that the
Cardinal had of upending the
Rose Bowl frontrunning Huskies.

'How you play on
Saturday is the
direct result of how
you play during the
week. The fact is
we didn't practice
well last week.'

"We had a couple of bad plays
and turnovers that hurt us,"
Stanford coach Denny Green said
after the game. "They hurt us a
lot because they gave [Washing
ton] a touchdown and some good
field position. We just never got
back on track afterwards."
Washington derailed the Cardi
nal early when Stanford tailback
Glyn Milburn fumbled at Stan
ford's 17-yard line in the first
quarter. Already leading 10-0,
rover back Eric Briscoe scooped
up Milburn's fumble and returned
it the 17 yards for a touchdown,
giving Washington a 17-point
cushion with 19 seconds left in the
first quarter.
"I don't know what happened,"
Milburn said of the fumble. "I just
got hit and the ball popped out. It
happened so fast."
After that play, the Stanford
offense collapsed as Washington's
defense forced Stanford error
after error.
Trailing 31-0 with time wind
ing down in the second quarter,
Stanford starting quarterback
Jason Palumibs killed a sustained
Cardinal drive by throwing an
interception at Washington's 17-
yard line. In the third quarter
with the Stanford offense on the

Washington 14, Palumbis dropped
back to pass, was broadsided by
blitzing Husky linebacker Brett
Collins, and fumbled. The
Huskies recovered to thwart
another Stanford drive.
Palumbis, who never saw
Collins blitzing, was replaced by
Lynch on the next offensive set of
downs. "Apparently I fumbled,
but I can't remember that play,"
Palumbis said.
Lynch, however, was as ineffec
tive as Palumbis. The backup
quarterback turned the ball over
to Washington on the next Stan
ford drive when he fumbled as he
was being sacked by Washington

defensive end Andy Mason.
After the Huskies had scored
on the drive resulting from that
fumble, Cardinal kickoff returner
Charlie Young muffed the ensuing
kickoff but recovered his own
fumble. Lynch's game-ending
interception consummated the
Cardinal's lackluster perfor
mance.
The turnovers, in addition to
five dead-ball fouls on the offense,
reflected what several Stanford
players identified as a week of
poor practices and bad prepara
tion.
"How you play on Saturday is
the direct result of how you play

during the week," said senior
Chuck Gillingham, who moved
over from his usual offensive
guard position to start at center
for the injured Chris Dalman.
"The fact is we didn't practice well
last week."
"I think we're losing our games
on the practice field," said Jimmy
Klein, who started at outside
linebacker on Saturday instead of
at strong safety. "I think we're
going to have to come out and pre
pare well this week."
"The coaches had a good
scheme prepared for us this week
but we just didn't execute it
Gillingham said. "The fact is we

need to go out [to the practice
field] and correct the mistakes we
made. We have to give it a better
effort on Tuesday and Wednesday
to get those problems squared
away."
Gillingham assures that prepa
ration for Saturday's game at Ore
gon will be much more intense
after the loss to Washington.
"The motivation is definitely
there to practice harder," he said.
"Practice will definitely be up
tempo this week.... The guys will
be out there playing for pride this
week. [But] it will take us a while
to get the taste of this one out of
our mouths."

The question is elementary.
How can a team that upset
Notre Dame be punished by Wash
ington?
How can a team that beat the
No. 1-ranked Fighting Irish in
South Bend be decimated by the
12th-ranked Huskies at home?
Stanford is still searching for
the answer.

"Mentally we weren't there,
physically we weren't there. That
enthusiam that 'we want to go out
and beat them' wasn't there. Put
those three together. We played
like a Molly-putz team and they
treated us like one," said
linebacker Ron George.
"We didn't have 95 people come
to play today and if that happens
some negative things are going to
happen," added running back
Glyn Milburn.
They definitely did.
Washington is a good team. No,
an excellent team. Probably better
than its ranking indicates.
But Stanford has held its own
against very good, maybe even
great, teams previously this sea
son.
What happened to the Cardinal
that just barely got nipped by Col
orado. That led USC 16-7? That
beat Notre Dame?
Physically it was in Stanford
Stadium Saturday.
Mentally it was in Disneyland.
Or the chem lab.
"They're good but they're not
52-16 better than us. We helped
them out a lot today," said strong
safety-turned-linebacker Jimmy
Klein.
"Our [minds are! not letting us
play to our physical ability. There
is no team that is physically that
much better than us. They
weren't close to being that much
better than us."
But Stanford definitely let
Washington be that much better
than them — for the entire con
test. From the opening kickofT the
Cardinal was never in the game.
Washington controlled every
aspect from start to finish. Stan
ford never gave itself a chance. It
played like it knew Washington is
heading for the Rose Bowl, and it
wanted to watch television during


Al Green - Dally
Stanford tried its best Saturday, but it just wasnt enough against 12th-ranked Washington. Here quarterback Jason Palumbis attempts
to get a pass off before being dumped to the ground.
winter break.
If practice is any indication of
performance on Saturday, maybe
it does.
"Practice was kind of lack
adaisical. We weren't concen
trated. We made a lot of mistakes.
We were talking to our friends,''
George said. "We didn't come out
t<3 play as a team and we couldn't
get it together.
"It wasn't the coaching or the
plays, it was just that starting on
Tuesday we just didn't have
etough energy. We woke up Mon
day morning and just went
through the week."
- This trend continued on the
field. If Stanford was giving 100
pfercent, then Washington gave
I{lo. But a team that's giving its
aH doesn't make mistakes wire to
wire. The Cardinal did.
IA perfect Stanford perfor
mance still might have come up
sl)ort against the Huskies, who
performed on offense, defense and
special teams. But Stanford was
far from stellar.
I If it wasn't a turnover it was a
penalty. If it wasn't a holding call
it; was a missed block. Or a sack.
• Stanford turned the ball over
five times, two of which were
iiiside Washington's 20. It's diffi
cult to score if you don't have the
ball. The Cardinal was also penal
ized 11 times for 75 yards, a num
ber of which were called during
cfucial downs on scoring drives.
Washington is difficult to beat
on any day but Stanford ensured
that the Huskies continue their
perfect conference record.
. "They are really good, they're
probably going to go to the Rose
Bowl, but it was a lot of our part.
We gave them a lot of things,"
George said. "We weren't in posi
tion; people wern't covering their
gaps; we were getting knocked off
the ball. Our coverages were not
right and we weren't getting a lot
pressure on the quarteback.
"Coach (Willie) Shaw told us
right before we went out there
that mental errors and penalties
lose games. We had a lot of both."
Washington, however, has a lot
of talent. Stanford knew what it
was going up against but just
couldn't stop the Husky offense,
and couldn't get by one of the
nation's best defenses.
It's pretty difficult to win if you

can't get your offense going and
can't stop the opponent.
Washington scored on its first
{>ossession of the game and never
ooked back. Stanford knew that
to have a chance at victoiy it had
to stop Washington's run-based
offense. It couldn't.
Heisman Trophy candidate
Greg Lewis ran wild. The senior,
who is vying to tie Marcus Allen's
mark of rushing for 100 yards in
every game for a season, contin
ued his quest by romping for 108
yards and a touchdown. Backup
fullback Matt Jones contributed
another 53 yards — on three car
ries — and two touchdowns to add
to a team total of 262 yards on the
ground.
"Lewis is a good back. We knew
we had to contain him, not give
him any big runs, but we had a
hard time containing him and
stopping the pass," cornerback
Kevin Scott said. "It pretty much
kept us off balance for the rest of
the game."
The pass, however, is not Wash
ington's strength. Quarterback
Mark Brunell came into the con
test lugging a 47-percent-comple
tion percentage. The Stanford
defense gave his season rating a
boost.
His first pass was a touchdown.
He finished the day 9 of 16 for 148
yards and two touchdowns. Stan
ford even gave his backup, Billy Jo
Hobart, an oportunity to see some
action, and Hobart responded by
completing two passes in two
attempts for 29 yards.
Once again Stanford had trou
ble covering receivers, and, of
course, rushing the passer.
The Husky's eight-man front
had no such difficulties. It pres
sured quarterback Jason
Palumbis, and his back-up John
Lynch, relentlessly. The two were
sacked a total of nine times, once
for a fumble. Washington's blitz
oriented rush made it difficult for
the Cardinal to get the ball off all
afternoon.
"They come off the ball hard
and get to the quarterback. What
they do is play the pressure eight
man front, and they give you a
bunch of different looks," said
center Chuck Gillingham. "You
look at it and you're thinking
'Jesus, where do you go?' They
play real good football, there's no
question.
"[But] we did not assert our
selves physically and use our size
and our strength and the advan
tages that we have up front as

individuals."
Palumbis finished the day 17 of
28 for 177 yards, way below his
season average, and Lynch was 4
of 8 in his quarter and a half of
play.
But not only does Washinton
have a great pass rush, it also has
the nation's best run defense.
Which creates a problem if you're
trying to establish a balanced
attack.
For the second week in a row
Stanford was slowed on the
ground. Gillingham and Co. just
couldn't make holes faster than
the Washington defenders filled
them. Milbum was limited to 27
yards rushing, although he did
run back a punt for a touchdown.
Tommy Vardell did manage to
gain 40 yards and Stanford's only
touchdown from scrimmage, but
it was not what coach Denny
Green was hoping for.
"They play the pass real well
and make you make mistakes in
the run game," Gillingham said.
"They do a great job, no question.
"They played great football but
at the same time we stunk it up.
There's no question offensively
we were pretty shitty. It'll be a
long week of practice."
To give Stanford a complete
look, special teams also had prob
lems. While tacklers had trouble
covering punt returner Beno
Bryant, punter Paul Stonehouse
had difficulties of his own. He just
couldn't seem to get the ball in the
air and heading downfield. His
punts continually gave Washing
ton field position inside Stanford
territory. The lowlight was a 19-
yarder that put Washington on
the Cardinal 36. Whoops.
"Today we did not play well and
ran into a team that is really good
and really played well," said
Green.
It was a game to forget.
Card notes
The Cardinal played with a very
interesting lineup, due to a minor
shake-up and lots of injuries. Gilling
ham started at center and Glen
Cavanaugh started at right guard
because center Chris Dalman had
lower back pain. Freshman Vaughn
Bryant started at wide receiver, and
running back Milburn was used in the
position. Defensively, Klein started at
outside linebacker because Jono
Tunney also had back pain, and Her
bie Berry took Klein's place at strong
safety. Freshman Ross McQuivey
started at left defensive tackle.
