## Card outexecuted by league-leading Huskies, 52-16 Errors plague team in loss 
### David Earnest Senior sports writer Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The final play of Saturday's 52-
16 loss to Washington, an inter
ception of Stanford backup quar
terback John Lynch by Husky free
safety Shane Pahukoa, seemed to
be the only appropriate ending to
a Stanford performance marred
by five Cardinal turnovers. The
three fumbles and two intercep
tions, along with numerous other
penalties, ended any hope that the
Cardinal had of upending the
Rose Bowl frontrunning Huskies.

'How you play on
Saturday is the
direct result of how
you play during the
week. The fact is
we didn't practice
well last week.'

"We had a couple of bad plays
and turnovers that hurt us,"
Stanford coach Denny Green said
after the game. "They hurt us a
lot because they gave [Washing
ton] a touchdown and some good
field position. We just never got
back on track afterwards."
Washington derailed the Cardi
nal early when Stanford tailback
Glyn Milburn fumbled at Stan
ford's 17-yard line in the first
quarter. Already leading 10-0,
rover back Eric Briscoe scooped
up Milburn's fumble and returned
it the 17 yards for a touchdown,
giving Washington a 17-point
cushion with 19 seconds left in the
first quarter.
"I don't know what happened,"
Milburn said of the fumble. "I just
got hit and the ball popped out. It
happened so fast."
After that play, the Stanford
offense collapsed as Washington's
defense forced Stanford error
after error.
Trailing 31-0 with time wind
ing down in the second quarter,
Stanford starting quarterback
Jason Palumibs killed a sustained
Cardinal drive by throwing an
interception at Washington's 17-
yard line. In the third quarter
with the Stanford offense on the

Washington 14, Palumbis dropped
back to pass, was broadsided by
blitzing Husky linebacker Brett
Collins, and fumbled. The
Huskies recovered to thwart
another Stanford drive.
Palumbis, who never saw
Collins blitzing, was replaced by
Lynch on the next offensive set of
downs. "Apparently I fumbled,
but I can't remember that play,"
Palumbis said.
Lynch, however, was as ineffec
tive as Palumbis. The backup
quarterback turned the ball over
to Washington on the next Stan
ford drive when he fumbled as he
was being sacked by Washington

defensive end Andy Mason.
After the Huskies had scored
on the drive resulting from that
fumble, Cardinal kickoff returner
Charlie Young muffed the ensuing
kickoff but recovered his own
fumble. Lynch's game-ending
interception consummated the
Cardinal's lackluster perfor
mance.
The turnovers, in addition to
five dead-ball fouls on the offense,
reflected what several Stanford
players identified as a week of
poor practices and bad prepara
tion.
"How you play on Saturday is
the direct result of how you play

during the week," said senior
Chuck Gillingham, who moved
over from his usual offensive
guard position to start at center
for the injured Chris Dalman.
"The fact is we didn't practice well
last week."
"I think we're losing our games
on the practice field," said Jimmy
Klein, who started at outside
linebacker on Saturday instead of
at strong safety. "I think we're
going to have to come out and pre
pare well this week."
"The coaches had a good
scheme prepared for us this week
but we just didn't execute it
Gillingham said. "The fact is we

need to go out [to the practice
field] and correct the mistakes we
made. We have to give it a better
effort on Tuesday and Wednesday
to get those problems squared
away."
Gillingham assures that prepa
ration for Saturday's game at Ore
gon will be much more intense
after the loss to Washington.
"The motivation is definitely
there to practice harder," he said.
"Practice will definitely be up
tempo this week.... The guys will
be out there playing for pride this
week. [But] it will take us a while
to get the taste of this one out of
our mouths."

The question is elementary.
How can a team that upset
Notre Dame be punished by Wash
ington?
How can a team that beat the
No. 1-ranked Fighting Irish in
South Bend be decimated by the
12th-ranked Huskies at home?
Stanford is still searching for
the answer.

"Mentally we weren't there,
physically we weren't there. That
enthusiam that 'we want to go out
and beat them' wasn't there. Put
those three together. We played
like a Molly-putz team and they
treated us like one," said
linebacker Ron George.
"We didn't have 95 people come
to play today and if that happens
some negative things are going to
happen," added running back
Glyn Milburn.
They definitely did.
Washington is a good team. No,
an excellent team. Probably better
than its ranking indicates.
But Stanford has held its own
against very good, maybe even
great, teams previously this sea
son.
What happened to the Cardinal
that just barely got nipped by Col
orado. That led USC 16-7? That
beat Notre Dame?
Physically it was in Stanford
Stadium Saturday.
Mentally it was in Disneyland.
Or the chem lab.
"They're good but they're not
52-16 better than us. We helped
them out a lot today," said strong
safety-turned-linebacker Jimmy
Klein.
"Our [minds are! not letting us
play to our physical ability. There
is no team that is physically that
much better than us. They
weren't close to being that much
better than us."
But Stanford definitely let
Washington be that much better
than them â€” for the entire con
test. From the opening kickofT the
Cardinal was never in the game.
Washington controlled every
aspect from start to finish. Stan
ford never gave itself a chance. It
played like it knew Washington is
heading for the Rose Bowl, and it
wanted to watch television during
