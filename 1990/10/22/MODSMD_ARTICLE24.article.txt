# Bruin comeback tops spikers
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — The UCLA campus has never
been kind to the Cardinal women's volleyball team.
After going 0-4 there over the past two years, a
change seemed to be in order.
For two and a half hours Friday night, it was. But
the Bruins stormed back from a huge deficit to win
their 46th consecutive Pacific 10 Conference match.
And in the end, even Bev Oden's school-record 41
kills were not enough.
Or maybe they were too much.
The Cardinal won the first and third games and
led 12-4 in the fourth. But Stanford could not shut
the door on UCLA.

While Stanford never gave in, the Bruins heated
up, extending the match nearly another hour. In the
end, UCLA won 13-15, 15-6, 7-15, 17-15, 15-11 in
three hours and 16 minutes. And while the rest of
the match allowed Oden to obliterate the school kills
record of 32, held by her sister Kim, she would have
much rather seen the Cardinal put three more
points on the scoreboard.
"I was really disappointed we didn't win," coach
Don Shaw said. "We had it right there in our grasp. .
. . Overall I thought we fought real hard. We had our
moments but we did not get it done."
Top-ranked UCLA imporved to 18-1 overall, 10-0
in the Pac-10. Stanford, ranked fifth, is now 14-3
overall, 9-2 in league, with both the losses coming to
UCLA.
After the Cardinal took the 12-4 lead in game
four, the Bruins regrouped to score several unan
swered points. UCLA actually served for the game at
one point, but Stanford fought back to take a 15-14
lead.
On the Cardinal's second match point, 6-foot-l
sophomore Natalie Williams hit a ball for the Bruins
that appeared to be just out. The lineman called it in
and UCLA went on to win the game.
"I thought we played pretty well for the most
part," Bev Oden said, "but by letting them back into
it in the fourth game we led the crowd back into it
and that got us down There's no way we should
lose that game "
With the momentum, and the support of most of
the 1,899 people in the Wooden Center, UCLA raced
out to a 7-1 iead in the fifth game and the match
appeared to be over. The Bruins extended the lead to
11-6 before the Cardinal came back.
Stanford strung together 14 consecutive side outs
and tied the fifth game up at 11. A Stanford spike

sailed just wide to make it 12-11, then Bruin senior
Samantha Shaver produced a kill to make it 13-11.
Later Marissa Hatchett and Holly McPeak
blocked Krisitn Klein to set up match point, but
Klein alertly slapped the ball to the UCLA floor to
save the Cardinal. Shaver got the ball back for UCLA
with a kill to set up a second match point. After a
long rally, Natalie Williams recorded her 37th kill of
the match from out of the back row and UCLA had
won.
"I never thought we weren't going to win,"
McPeak said, "but it was scary.... We had a lot of
confidence; we just started playing our game."
In addition to her 41 kills, Oden had 18 digs and
hit .326 ("Bev played unreal, as usual," according to
McPeak). Klein had career-highs of 27 kills and 28
digs, the latter figure falling one short of the school
record, to go along with four aces. Amy Cooper added
a career-high 20 kills and Carrie Feldman had a
career-best 83 assists.
Williams, who like Oden hit from both the front
and back rows all night, hit .350 and had 18 digs to
go along with her 37 kills. Jenny Evans added 32
kills and 23 digs while hitting .403, Hatchett had 25
kills and a whopping 13 blocks and Shaver chipped in
with 24 kills. McPeak had 17 digs and seven blocks to
go along with her 97 assists, the most recorded in the
nation this year.
"It's the longest match I've ever played in," said
Oden, whose career high in kills was 18 before this
year. She recorded 25 against then-No. 7 Illinois ear
lier this season and had 29 in the earlier loss to the
Bruins.
While the match was obviously very disappointing
for the Cardinal, both Shaw and Oden think it will
help in the long run. "It's disappointing because we
should have won and didn't," Shaw said. "But its
encouraging because when you consider what we've
done the past few weeks, beating No. 2 Nebraska up
here and having control of this match, I think we've
proven we're right up there.
"We have to keep improving.... We had a chance
and we didn't take advantage of it, but hopefully
we'll get another chance."
"I know now that we can beat them," Oden said,
"and I know the team knows that we can beat them.
We have more confidence than we've had since I've
been here. ... I think it depends a lot more on what
we do than on what they do. If we can get it together
I think we'll have a lot more initiative and a lot more
will to kill them instead of let them back in it. We
always say this but I really think next time we won't
let it happen."
Next time just might be in the Western Regional
finals of the NCAA Tournament in December. UCLA
has won the Western Regional two straight years
before being upset in the final four as the nation's
top-ranked team. Stanford, meanwhile, has been
upset in the second round of the five-round NCAA
tournament, one match short of a contest with the
Bruins for a final four berth. Both of those loses

were, needless to say, in UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
Both Shaw and Oden feel the Cardinal will need
to improve its blocking to beat UCLA, however. "I
think that was one of our big problems," Oden said.
"Whenever the ball was going out to the left side, the
ball kept going underneath our middle blocker to a
spot where we didn't have any diggers.
"I think once you get their hitters down, they stay
down for a while. It would have been different if we
blocked a few of those balls."
Stanford will attempt to rebound against Arizona
State and Arizona this weekend at Burnham Pavil
ion. Those matches will give the Cardinal a chance to
get back on the right track going into a frightening
contest. One week from tomorrow the team travels
to No. 2 University of the Pacific to face the Tigers
and their thousands of orange-and-black clad fans

the night before Halloween. At last count the Tigers
had won 22 straight games.
Card notes
Last Friday night's match will be shown on a tape-delay
basis by ESPN beginning at 9:30 pm tomorrow.
Walking through the UCLA student union before the
match Friday, a strange sight presented itself. This tall guy
was walking down one of the hallways and just kept getting
bigger and bigger as he came closer and closer. A little
deductive reason by the two intrepid Daily staffers led us to
believe it was Mike Lanier.
Lanier, who transfered to UCLA from Hardin-Simmons
University in Texas, is a 7-foot-6 (yep, 7-foot-6) center for
the Bruin basketball squad. Basically, he is as much taller
than Adam Keefe as Keefe is taller than your typical 6-
foot Stanford student.

change seemed to be in order.
For two and a half hours Friday night, it was. But
the Bruins stormed back from a huge deficit to win
their 46th consecutive Pacific 10 Conference match.
And in the end, even Bev Oden's school-record 41
kills were not enough.
Or maybe they were too much.
The Cardinal won the first and third games and
led 12-4 in the fourth. But Stanford could not shut
the door on UCLA.

While Stanford never gave in, the Bruins heated
up, extending the match nearly another hour. In the
end, UCLA won 13-15, 15-6, 7-15, 17-15, 15-11 in
three hours and 16 minutes. And while the rest of
the match allowed Oden to obliterate the school kills
record of 32, held by her sister Kim, she would have
much rather seen the Cardinal put three more
points on the scoreboard.
"I was really disappointed we didn't win," coach
Don Shaw said. "We had it right there in our grasp. .
. . Overall I thought we fought real hard. We had our
moments but we did not get it done."
Top-ranked UCLA imporved to 18-1 overall, 10-0
in the Pac-10. Stanford, ranked fifth, is now 14-3
overall, 9-2 in league, with both the losses coming to
UCLA.
After the Cardinal took the 12-4 lead in game
four, the Bruins regrouped to score several unan
swered points. UCLA actually served for the game at
one point, but Stanford fought back to take a 15-14
lead.
On the Cardinal's second match point, 6-foot-l
sophomore Natalie Williams hit a ball for the Bruins
that appeared to be just out. The lineman called it in
and UCLA went on to win the game.
"I thought we played pretty well for the most
part," Bev Oden said, "but by letting them back into
it in the fourth game we led the crowd back into it
and that got us down There's no way we should
lose that game "
With the momentum, and the support of most of
the 1,899 people in the Wooden Center, UCLA raced
out to a 7-1 iead in the fifth game and the match
appeared to be over. The Bruins extended the lead to
11-6 before the Cardinal came back.
Stanford strung together 14 consecutive side outs
and tied the fifth game up at 11. A Stanford spike

sailed just wide to make it 12-11, then Bruin senior
Samantha Shaver produced a kill to make it 13-11.
Later Marissa Hatchett and Holly McPeak
blocked Krisitn Klein to set up match point, but
Klein alertly slapped the ball to the UCLA floor to
save the Cardinal. Shaver got the ball back for UCLA
with a kill to set up a second match point. After a
long rally, Natalie Williams recorded her 37th kill of
the match from out of the back row and UCLA had
won.
"I never thought we weren't going to win,"
McPeak said, "but it was scary.... We had a lot of
confidence; we just started playing our game."
In addition to her 41 kills, Oden had 18 digs and
hit .326 ("Bev played unreal, as usual," according to
McPeak). Klein had career-highs of 27 kills and 28
digs, the latter figure falling one short of the school
record, to go along with four aces. Amy Cooper added
a career-high 20 kills and Carrie Feldman had a
career-best 83 assists.
Williams, who like Oden hit from both the front
and back rows all night, hit .350 and had 18 digs to
go along with her 37 kills. Jenny Evans added 32
kills and 23 digs while hitting .403, Hatchett had 25
kills and a whopping 13 blocks and Shaver chipped in
with 24 kills. McPeak had 17 digs and seven blocks to
go along with her 97 assists, the most recorded in the
nation this year.
"It's the longest match I've ever played in," said
Oden, whose career high in kills was 18 before this
year. She recorded 25 against then-No. 7 Illinois ear
lier this season and had 29 in the earlier loss to the
Bruins.
While the match was obviously very disappointing
for the Cardinal, both Shaw and Oden think it will
help in the long run. "It's disappointing because we
should have won and didn't," Shaw said. "But its
encouraging because when you consider what we've
done the past few weeks, beating No. 2 Nebraska up
here and having control of this match, I think we've
proven we're right up there.
"We have to keep improving.... We had a chance
and we didn't take advantage of it, but hopefully
we'll get another chance."
"I know now that we can beat them," Oden said,
"and I know the team knows that we can beat them.
We have more confidence than we've had since I've
been here. ... I think it depends a lot more on what
we do than on what they do. If we can get it together
I think we'll have a lot more initiative and a lot more
will to kill them instead of let them back in it. We
always say this but I really think next time we won't
let it happen."
Next time just might be in the Western Regional
finals of the NCAA Tournament in December. UCLA
has won the Western Regional two straight years
before being upset in the final four as the nation's
top-ranked team. Stanford, meanwhile, has been
upset in the second round of the five-round NCAA
tournament, one match short of a contest with the
Bruins for a final four berth. Both of those loses

were, needless to say, in UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
Both Shaw and Oden feel the Cardinal will need
to improve its blocking to beat UCLA, however. "I
think that was one of our big problems," Oden said.
"Whenever the ball was going out to the left side, the
ball kept going underneath our middle blocker to a
spot where we didn't have any diggers.
"I think once you get their hitters down, they stay
down for a while. It would have been different if we
blocked a few of those balls."
Stanford will attempt to rebound against Arizona
State and Arizona this weekend at Burnham Pavil
ion. Those matches will give the Cardinal a chance to
get back on the right track going into a frightening
contest. One week from tomorrow the team travels
to No. 2 University of the Pacific to face the Tigers
and their thousands of orange-and-black clad fans

the night before Halloween. At last count the Tigers
had won 22 straight games.

Walking through the UCLA student union before the
match Friday, a strange sight presented itself. This tall guy
was walking down one of the hallways and just kept getting
bigger and bigger as he came closer and closer. A little
deductive reason by the two intrepid Daily staffers led us to
believe it was Mike Lanier.
Lanier, who transfered to UCLA from Hardin-Simmons
University in Texas, is a 7-foot-6 (yep, 7-foot-6) center for
the Bruin basketball squad. Basically, he is as much taller
than Adam Keefe as Keefe is taller than your typical 6-
foot Stanford student.
