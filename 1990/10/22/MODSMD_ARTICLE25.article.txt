# Keely, Stanford post marathon win over No. 2 UCLA
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
It was only right.
After regulation was over and
five grueling overtimes, including
three sudden-death periods, had
been played, the Stanford water
polo team finally emerged a 10-9
victor over a No. 2-ranked UCLA
team that just wouldn't give in.

Bruins 9, OT

And it was only right that
senior Colin Keely was the one to
put an end to this epic battle. With
a little over two minutes to play in
the third sudden death, a wide
open Keely took a pass from goalie
Larry Bercutt, swam in with the
ball toward the UCLA goal, and
then with the mightiest of shots,
fired the ball into the net to give
the Cardinal the thrilling victory.
The goal was the final play of
one of the greatest Stanford water
polo games ever, and it also cli
maxed an incredible individual
performance by Keely. The goal
was his fifth of the game, but
what is even more remarkable is
that Keely never came out of the
marathon game.
Yet he still had enough
strength to win all seven sprints
he was in at the beginning of each
period and had enough speed left
to blow past everyone and get
himself completely alone for the
winning goal.
"To win all seven sprints is an
amazing feat," an excited coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "That
takes a lot of energy, and then to
come back and win the game for
us, well that's just an unreal per
formance. Colin is really gutsy."
The beginning of the game did
not give any impressions of the
happy times that were to follow,
however, as UCLA took advantage

of Stanford mistakes and jumped
out to a 4-2 advantage. At this
point, Dettamanti had a bad feel
ing that the game was looking
very similar to an earlier 12-6 loss
to the Bruins that was Stanford's
worst defeat since 1983.
"Mistakes really hurt us in the
first quarter, and I just had a feel
ing that we were going to go
through that nightmare again."
The nightmare was over soon,
however, as Dettamanti's team
eliminated the mistakes and basi
cally dominated the game from
the second quarter on. One of the
keys to the turnaround was the
Stanford defense, which held
UCLA to only five more goals for
the rest of the game.
Bercutt, who ended up with 14
saves, had a lot to do with stop
ping the powerful Bruin offense.
"Larry had a good game after the
first quarter," Dettamanti said.
"He really settled down and made
some key saves for us."
Someone else who did a great
job on defense was senior Rick
McNair. McNair is usually the
Cardinal's main offensive threat,
but against UCLA, he was given
the challenge of defending
UCLA's German superstar Stefan
Pollman. Pollman asserted him
self in the early going, scoring
four of his team's first five goals,
but after that, McNair and his
teammates completely shut him
down.
"I was just able to do the job on
him today," McNair said. "He's
killed me in the past, but today we
just played really physically and
wore him down."
The same can be said of the
entire UCLA team, as the Cardi
nal was clearly the fresher and
quicker team at the end of the
game. As Dettamanti said, "It
looked like they got a little tired,
and we had enough energy left to
pull it out. I guess all those extra
workouts we've had finally paid
ofT."
Indeed, in the sudden-death

periods, Stanford was so much
stronger than UCLA that the visi
tors could barely even get any
shots off as the Cardinal defense
stole ball after ball from its weary
opponents.
It was hardly an easy feat for
the Cardinal to get into overtime,
however. After the first quarter,
the teams traded goals and with
four minutes until halftime, the
Cardinal was still down 5-3. But
then, Keely scored on an outside
shot and Stanford's defense tight
ened up, stopping the Bruins on
two straight 6-on-5 advantages.
Stanford finally evened the score
at 5 with 35 seconds left in the
half on a great skip shot by J.T.
Matarangas as the shot clock was
running down.
UCLA came right back to score
before halftime, so Stanford was
behind once again. After the half
time break, Bercutt and his coun
terpart for the Bruins, Dan Hack
ett, would not let anything past
them, and neither team scored
until UCLA's Oliver Will con
verted on a 4-meter penalty shot
to make the score 7-5. Stanford
then capitalized on a two-man
advantage as Mark Waliin took a
Keely pass and scored to bring the
Cardinal back within one goal.
That was all the scoring in the
third quarter, so going into the
final regulation period, the score
was 7-6, UCLA.
Both teams were now playing
great defense, and it wasn't until
three minutes were left in the
game that Keely showed off his
speed and stamina by breaking
away from everyone and scoring
on the counterattack to tie up the
game.
Keely wasn't done, however.
After a UCLA goal with two min
utes left, Stanford had a 6-on-5
advantage and Keely once again
tied up the score as his shot into
the upper right hand corner beat
Hackett and set the crowd into a
frenzy.
But even this didn't seem to be

enough for the Cardinal. With 18
seconds left, UCLA had a 6-on-5,
but Stanford incredibly would not
give in, and Bercutt stopped a
hard Bruin shot as time ran out.
Then came the overtimes.
After taking the lead on a Greg
Olson goal, Stanford seemed to
have the game won until UCLA's
Philip Hadfield scored with only
nine ticks left on the clock.
So, the two teams had to
regroup and get set for sudden
death. Time after time, it seemed
like someone was going to score,

but neither team could manage to
end the game.
That is, until two minutes were
left in the third sudden-death
period.
The winning goal started when
Chip Blankenhorn stole the ball
from his opponent on the defen
sive end. Before anyone could
even think, Keely was off sprint
ing towards the Bruin goal and
was way ahead of the tired UCLA
players. Blankenhorn did not see
him, however, and passed the ball

back to Bercutt. Bercutt didn't see
Keely at first either, but Keely was
so open that when the ball finally
arrived to him, he still had enough
time to get the ball and take it in
for the win.
As an ecstatic yet physically
drained Keely said, "There was no
way I was going to swim back
down the pool again, so I figured I
better score."
And score he did for the No. 3,
and soon to be No. 2, Cardinal.

In the biggest win of the season, the Cardinal water polo team topped UCLA in overtime No. 5
Friday. The loss should drop the second-ranked Bruins, who had the nation's best record at 19-1
coming Into the contest, and allow No. 3 Stanford to move up a notch in the polls.

"Mistakes really hurt us in the
first quarter, and I just had a feel
ing that we were going to go
through that nightmare again."
The nightmare was over soon,
however, as Dettamanti's team
eliminated the mistakes and basi
cally dominated the game from
the second quarter on. One of the
keys to the turnaround was the
Stanford defense, which held
UCLA to only five more goals for
the rest of the game.
Bercutt, who ended up with 14
saves, had a lot to do with stop
ping the powerful Bruin offense.
"Larry had a good game after the
first quarter," Dettamanti said.
"He really settled down and made
some key saves for us."
Someone else who did a great
job on defense was senior Rick
McNair. McNair is usually the
Cardinal's main offensive threat,
but against UCLA, he was given
the challenge of defending
UCLA's German superstar Stefan
Pollman. Pollman asserted him
self in the early going, scoring
four of his team's first five goals,
but after that, McNair and his
teammates completely shut him
down.
"I was just able to do the job on
him today," McNair said. "He's
killed me in the past, but today we
just played really physically and
wore him down."
The same can be said of the
entire UCLA team, as the Cardi
nal was clearly the fresher and
quicker team at the end of the
game. As Dettamanti said, "It
looked like they got a little tired,
and we had enough energy left to
pull it out. I guess all those extra
workouts we've had finally paid
ofT."
Indeed, in the sudden-death

periods, Stanford was so much
stronger than UCLA that the visi
tors could barely even get any
shots off as the Cardinal defense
stole ball after ball from its weary
opponents.
It was hardly an easy feat for
the Cardinal to get into overtime,
however. After the first quarter,
the teams traded goals and with
four minutes until halftime, the
Cardinal was still down 5-3. But
then, Keely scored on an outside
shot and Stanford's defense tight
ened up, stopping the Bruins on
two straight 6-on-5 advantages.
Stanford finally evened the score
at 5 with 35 seconds left in the
half on a great skip shot by J.T.
Matarangas as the shot clock was
running down.
UCLA came right back to score
before halftime, so Stanford was
behind once again. After the half
time break, Bercutt and his coun
terpart for the Bruins, Dan Hack
ett, would not let anything past
them, and neither team scored
until UCLA's Oliver Will con
verted on a 4-meter penalty shot
to make the score 7-5. Stanford
then capitalized on a two-man
advantage as Mark Waliin took a
Keely pass and scored to bring the
Cardinal back within one goal.
That was all the scoring in the
third quarter, so going into the
final regulation period, the score
was 7-6, UCLA.
Both teams were now playing
great defense, and it wasn't until
three minutes were left in the
game that Keely showed off his
speed and stamina by breaking
away from everyone and scoring
on the counterattack to tie up the
game.
Keely wasn't done, however.
After a UCLA goal with two min
utes left, Stanford had a 6-on-5
advantage and Keely once again
tied up the score as his shot into
the upper right hand corner beat
Hackett and set the crowd into a
frenzy.
But even this didn't seem to be

enough for the Cardinal. With 18
seconds left, UCLA had a 6-on-5,
but Stanford incredibly would not
give in, and Bercutt stopped a
hard Bruin shot as time ran out.
Then came the overtimes.
After taking the lead on a Greg
Olson goal, Stanford seemed to
have the game won until UCLA's
Philip Hadfield scored with only
nine ticks left on the clock.
So, the two teams had to
regroup and get set for sudden
death. Time after time, it seemed
like someone was going to score,

but neither team could manage to
end the game.
That is, until two minutes were
left in the third sudden-death
period.
The winning goal started when
Chip Blankenhorn stole the ball
from his opponent on the defen
sive end. Before anyone could
even think, Keely was off sprint
ing towards the Bruin goal and
was way ahead of the tired UCLA
players. Blankenhorn did not see
him, however, and passed the ball

back to Bercutt. Bercutt didn't see
Keely at first either, but Keely was
so open that when the ball finally
arrived to him, he still had enough
time to get the ball and take it in
for the win.
As an ecstatic yet physically
drained Keely said, "There was no
way I was going to swim back
down the pool again, so I figured I
better score."
And score he did for the No. 3,
and soon to be No. 2, Cardinal.

In the biggest win of the season, the Cardinal water polo team topped UCLA in overtime No. 5
Friday. The loss should drop the second-ranked Bruins, who had the nation's best record at 19-1
coming Into the contest, and allow No. 3 Stanford to move up a notch in the polls.
It was only right.
After regulation was over and
five grueling overtimes, including
three sudden-death periods, had
been played, the Stanford water
polo team finally emerged a 10-9
victor over a No. 2-ranked UCLA
team that just wouldn't give in.

Bruins 9, OT

And it was only right that
senior Colin Keely was the one to
put an end to this epic battle. With
a little over two minutes to play in
the third sudden death, a wide
open Keely took a pass from goalie
Larry Bercutt, swam in with the
ball toward the UCLA goal, and
then with the mightiest of shots,
fired the ball into the net to give
the Cardinal the thrilling victory.
The goal was the final play of
one of the greatest Stanford water
polo games ever, and it also cli
maxed an incredible individual
performance by Keely. The goal
was his fifth of the game, but
what is even more remarkable is
that Keely never came out of the
marathon game.
Yet he still had enough
strength to win all seven sprints
he was in at the beginning of each
period and had enough speed left
to blow past everyone and get
himself completely alone for the
winning goal.
"To win all seven sprints is an
amazing feat," an excited coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "That
takes a lot of energy, and then to
come back and win the game for
us, well that's just an unreal per
formance. Colin is really gutsy."
The beginning of the game did
not give any impressions of the
happy times that were to follow,
however, as UCLA took advantage

of Stanford mistakes and jumped
out to a 4-2 advantage. At this
point, Dettamanti had a bad feel
ing that the game was looking
very similar to an earlier 12-6 loss
to the Bruins that was Stanford's
worst defeat since 1983.
