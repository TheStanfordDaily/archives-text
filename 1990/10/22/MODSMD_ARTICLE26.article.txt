# Cardinal bests Duke, N.C. State

Glasnost is bunk. The Iron Curtain
hasn't really been dismantled, it's only
been moved. And it seems to be getting
stronger.
Stanford asserted its new title as a
women's soccer superpower this week
end, utilizing a Brezhnev-stubborn
defense to silence No. 12 Duke, 1-0 in
overtime, and No. 7 North Carolina
State, 2-0.

Cardinal 1, Blue Devils 0, OT [
Cardinal 2, Wolfpack 0

The twin road wins virtually assure
Stanford (14-2-1) its first-ever NCAA
tournament bid. Stanford was ranked
No. 9 last week before sweeping No. 8
William and Mary, Duke and N.C. State
without allowing a goal. Stanford has
only one more game before bids to the
12-team tournament are announced
Oct. 29.
"We have accomplished more than I
thought we would. We feel we have
earned a spot in the playoffs," said Stan
ford coach Berhane Ajideberhan, who
has constructed the new Stanford soccer
empire in only four years at the helm.
Sophomore Julie Foudy scored one
minute into the second overtime to
defeat Duke, and seniors Jen Bloomer
and Jennifer Rowland tallied scores to
trap the Wolfpack.
N.C. State, which lost 4-0 to No. 17
Southern Methodist Saturday, ending a
13-game unbeaten streak, fell to 13-5-1.
Duke, which lost to SMU Sunday by a 2-

1 margin, dropped its season mark to
11-7.
Duke and N.C. State may have felt
like they were up against a KGB-backed
defense, but actually it was a Stanford
defensive unit that has continued to
improve. Senior goalie Elise Edwards
recorded her seventh and eighth
shutouts of the year, while junior
sweeper Heather Mclntyre marshalled
the fullbacks.
Junior Michele Sullivan, still recover
ing from a back problem, started both
games at fullback to give the defense a
lift, while Kerryy Stivaletti, Glynnis
Roberts, Denise Denney and Leni
Nonoshita quietly did the defensive
dirty work.
"The defense is really playing well,"
said Andeberhan. "Heather was just out
of her mind."
But the two-game trip to North Car
olina was no idealistic rampage for the
Cardinal. The effort left heavy casual
ties in the lineup, and Stanford will have
to rest and regroup before the playoffs
begin in two weeks.
Junior forward Elizabeth Joneschild
broke her leg against Duke, both Row
land and Bloomer bruised their knees at
N.C. State, and freshman forward Sarah
Rafanelli twisted her knee and was
elbowed in the face against N.C. State.
In fact, in the second half against the
Wolfpack, Stanford had no more field
position players to bring into the game
had there been another injury. Down 2-
0, the Wolfpack shifted to a physical
attack, and Rafanelli and Bloomer were
both injured away from the ball.
"I'm just glad the game finally
ended," said Andeberhan after the N.C.
State game. "These were not accidental
things, these were blatant dirty plays."

With Stanford's offense slowed by
injuries, Rafanelli took center stage, set
ting up scores in each game. The fresh
man forward was the most highly
sought recruit in the nation, and leads
the team with five assists.
"She played her best games of the
year," said Andeberhan. "She creates so
much havoc on offense."
Against the Wolfpack Sunday,
Bloomer scored her first goal of the year
on an assist from freshman Nieole
Tremain. Tremain recovered the ball
after a deflected shot from Foudy, then
volleyed it to Bloomer for the first-half
score.
In the second half, Rafanelli took a
lead pass from Denney and split the
defense before laying the ball off to
Rowland. Rowland went one-on-one
with goalie Lindsay Brecher, who slowed
the ball but couldn't keep it out of-the
net. •>
Against Duke, Stanford's incessant
second-half hammering finally paid off
when Foudy slammed home the winning
goal just one minute into the second
overtime period.
Duke kicked off to open the second
overtime, and Stanford quickly took
control at midfield. After working the
ball laterally, Rafanelli found the open
crease in the Blue Devil defense with a
criss-cross pass to a slicing Foudy. Foudy
one-touched the ball past the sweeper
and from 16 yards blasted the go-ahead
goal past goalie Gretchen Young.
"She just rifled it," said Anderber
han. "There was no way anybody could
stop that shot unless it was right at
them and it hit them." !


Tracy Allen — Dally
Freshman Sarah Rafanelll played a key role In both of the Cardinal's big wins this
weekend. She assisted on the game-winner against No. 12 Duke Saturday and tallied
another assist in a 2-0 victory over No. 8 North Carolina State yesterday.
"For the last 25 to 30 minutes of
regulation and in overtime we
were just all over them," said
Andeberhan, whose team out
shot Duke 20-9. "After not play
ing that well in the first half we
just really poured it on."
Stanford's first-half enthusi
asm was dampened by the season
ending iryury to Joneschild 15
minutes into the game.
Joneschild broke both the tibia
and fibula in her leg on a free ball
in front of the Blue Devil goal.
She and a Duke player swung for
the ball and their shins collided
on follow-through.
Joneschild,who is fourth on
the team in scoring with five
goals, was treated immediately
and placed in a three-quarter leg
cast. Her father, a physician, was
at the game and helped on the
scene. Andeberhan reported that
she was well cared for, back with
the team, and in good spirits,
although on crutches.
"It really dampened our spir
its," said Andeberhan. "We
became real vulnerable. We were

standing around waiting to get
beat."
"It's really a damper to the
trip," he continued. "We were
unlucky."
Joneschild, who brought expe
rience and even-tempered inten
sity to the Stanford attack, was
replaced by freshman Nicole
Tremain, who has been playing
more of late and scored her first
collegiate goal Oct. 7 against
George Mason.
If she is healthy, Rowland, who
had been shifting between for
ward and attack midfielder, will
start at forward with Rafanelli,
while Tremain will rotate in from
the bench.
"The injury hurts us a lot,"
said Andeberhan. "But I have a
lot of confidence in the ones we
have. Nicole is coming on really
strong."
But Rowland, who has been
playing without a knee brace for
only two weeks, may have aggra
vated her injury against N.C.
State, and Andeberhan is worried
about the status of the team's
offensive sparkplug.
Stanford's tentative first-half
play gave the Blue Devils their
best scoring chances of the game,
while Stanford was held to just

two shots in the first 45 minutes.
"We were being nice and clean
and pure and soft and they were
taking a piece of us," said Ande
berhan.
But in the second half,
Rafanelli and Foudy turned up
the heat on offense, joined by the
surging Tremain.
"They just started to battle. It
was all-out guts," said Andeber
han, who also credited senior
midfielder Denney with firing the
team up. "They had no chance.
The whole tempo of the game
changed."
Stanford narrowly missed on
three nerve-racking opportunities
in the second half. Rafanelli
scored one goal but was called off
side on a controversial decision.
Later, both Foudy and
Rafanelli had shots that went
past the goalie but were knocked
away at the goal-line by sliding
defenders. Tremain added a near
post header for good measure.
But the barrage finally found
its mark with Foudy's goal in the
second overtime and Duke did not
threaten to retaliate.
Stanford plays its last regular
season game Saturday at 2 p.m.
against the University of San
Francisco at Maloney Field.
