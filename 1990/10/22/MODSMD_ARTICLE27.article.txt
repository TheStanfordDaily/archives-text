# Runners dominate in tuneup
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
If only they all could be this
easy.
Despite the fact that the Cardi
nal cross countiy team did not
start its four best runners, the
Stanford harriers dominated the
field in their final tune-up before
the championship races begin
next weekend.
Junior Alex Accetta led the way
as he won the individual title with
a time of 27:13 for the 8,000-
meter course. "It was a good race
for me," he said. "It gives me a lot
of confidence going into Pac-lOs
next week." Stanford will host the
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships on Saturday at the Stan
ford Golf Course.
Right on Accetta's heels were
redshirt freshman Brett Allsop,
who took second overall in 27:27,
and the third-place finisher, junior
Dave Strang, in 27:48. The three
will join Fred Carter, Jason Mar
tin, Dave Scudamore, and Gary
Stolz as the seven Stanford com
petitors in the conference meet.
Coach Scott Chisam was
pleased with the results. "The
times were very good," he said,
"there were a lot of steep hills on

the course, and the whole team
did a great job."
The team has done a great job
all season. Despite losing a lot of
talent to graduation, the squad is
in an excellent position to capture
a spot at the NCAA Champi
onships, to be held in Knoxville,
Tenn., on Nov. 19. To qualify for
the meet, Stanford needs to finish
in the top three at the District-8
meet Nov. 10.
"It's been our goal all season,"
Accetta said of making nationals.
"The whole season has built up to
the next three meets. Hopefully,
I'll be able to be our number
three, four, or five guy and help us
get there."
Although the upcoming Pac-10
meet will have no bearing on
Stanford's chances at making
NCAAs, it is a critical meet for all
concerned.
"There's really no conference in
the country as talented as the Pac
-10," Chisam said. "And there's
also no conference in the country
that attaches so much importance
to its championship race."
Expected to challenge Stanford
for the title are Arizona, Oregon
and Washington.
Even though Arizona boasts

the top two runners in the confer
ence, Chisam has given his team
every reason to believe that the
Wildcats can be beaten. "They've
got the top two runners in the
Pac-10," Chisam said, "but we
could get four or five guys in
before their third man, and that
would be more than enough to
beat them. All we have to do is
believe in ourselves."
Last weekend's meet should
turn the Cardinal into believers.
They crushed their opponents
despite a deliberately slow first
two miles.
"I didn't want to wear anyone
out," Chisam said of his strategy.
"If everyone runs all-out and then
has nothing left next weekend,
then what was the point of this
time-trial?"
An excellent choice of words.
The race really was little more
than a time-trial, as the most
fevered competition took place
among the Cardinal runners, who
were fighting it out for the final
varsity spots. Barring injury or an
extremely subpar performance
next weekend, the top seven will
remain the same for each of the
next three races.
