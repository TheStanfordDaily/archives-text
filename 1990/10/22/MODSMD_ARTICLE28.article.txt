# Sophomore wins golf tourney

### Noah Blake 
Friday evening, after having played 36 holes of
the 54-hole Stanford Cardinal Invitational, the
home team was tied for fifth place, 10 shots off
the pace set by California, the tournament lead
ers. Stanford coach Wally Goodwin, however,
wasn't worried. "This is a comeback team, and
the guys are a real bunch of fighters." How right
he was.
In only 18 holes on Saturday, the Stanford
linksters made up eight strokes to finish in sole
possession of third place, only two shots back of
the Golden Bears.
The Cardinal charge was lead by sophomore
Mike Milliken, who won the individual title by
seven strokes over second place Mark McGuire (a
golfer from Rice, not a slumping slugger for the
A's). Milliken finished at 209, four under par,
with a performance that simply, as he put it,
"kicked some butt."
The same could be said of the entire squad,
which shot a combined 288 Saturday, the low
round of the tournament. This score looks even
more impressive when you consider how the
course was set up on Saturday. In order to "allow
the better teams to step forward," Goodwin had
set pins in the back of many greens. "The greens
slope from back to front," says Milliken, "so if you
hit over one, it's really hard to stop the ball when
you chip back on."
Not that Milliken had to worry. "I hit so many
greens this weekend, I knew all I had to do was

avoid three-putting, and I would have a pretty
solid finish." Solid understates his final-round 68,
which was made up of three birdies and 15 pars.
Not surprisingly, Milliken has recently been
working extensively on his short game in an
attempt to hit more greens. "Coach told me not to
worry about the long game, because it comes and
goes, and concentrate on the short game. Obvi
ously, the time I put in really paid off."
Friday's first round, however, did in the Cardi
nal's hopes of winning the team title. Already
missing the services of Christian Cevaer, the team
failed to take advantage of their home course dur
ing the opening round, a round in which they
needed to turn their familiarity with the course
into fewer strokes. Most disappointing was the
performance of freshman Notah Begay, who,
after leading the team in its first tournament,
was, according to Goodwin, "way off his game."
But no one person was responsible for the Car
dinal's first-round problems. All five players were
over par after 18 holes, and they dug themselves
a hole from which it was too difficult to come
back. Despite improving significantly over each of
the last two rounds, it was too little, too late.
Goodwin was pleased with the team's perfor
mance, however, and he is looking forward to Nov.
5-7, when the team will attempt to defend the
title it won last year at UCLA's tournament. "I've
got some real players, and I can't wait to haul
them around the country and see what they can
do."
