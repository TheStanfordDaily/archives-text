# Deciding which votes to count
## Committee revamping rules for ASSU elections 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU Constitution/Bylaw
Reform Task Force has reached a
consensus on changing several
election rules in the ASSU
Bylaws, including how to count
write-in votes.
"We are comprehensively going
through the elections portion" of
the Bylaws, said Senate Chair
Solina Kwan, a junior, one of the
task force's three facilitators.
The ASSU Senate is expected
to vote on amending at least the
elections and financial portion of
the Bylaws in its first meeting of
winter quarter.
The task force is currently
examining proposals compiled by
former ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Steve Krauss. According to
Kwan, Krauss combined the rec-

ommendations of
last year's senate
Bylaw reform
task force with
his own ideas —
based on two
years' experience
as commissioner
— into a packet
of election pro
posals.

The task force has discussed
seven of the proposals from
Krauss' packet and agreed with all
of them.
The task force will recommend
to the senate that the Bylaws be
changed to clarify the following
points, as described in Krauss'
proposal:
• "Only legitimate slates
should be allowed to claim their
votes and win the election, (e.g.
Donatello and the rest of the

Teenage Mutant Nii\ja Turtles
could not actually win the elec
tion, even if they received a large
number of votes);
• "Groups of students should
not be allowed to claim COP
write-in votes for their own unless
they had previously registered a
slate name with the Elections
Commission or the write-in vote
specifically named them as mem
bers of the write-in slate;
• "Write-in votes for COP
should not be counted towards a
majority of votes cast unless
either the votes were registered
for a particular COP slate or the
votes named some four registered
Stanford students as a COP
slate."
The task force's recommenda
tions on write-in ballots are par


Kwan
ticularly significant in light of last
year's election controversy. Last
spring, Krauss invalidated several
votes for fictional candidates and
slates such as Bart Simpson and
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Tur
tles.
If the ballots had counted,
there would have been a runofT
between the victorious Four our
Future slate and the losing A
Clean Slate, and Bart Simpson
would have been elected an ASSU
senator.
Other changes already
approved by the task force include
a ban on posting campaign litera

ture in the inner Quad and a pro
posal to rotate the order of slate
names and Special-Fee requests
from ballot to ballot.
In its upcoming meetings, the
task force will discuss other elec
tion reforms, including incorpo
rating political parties into the
Bylaws and creating new penalties
for campaign violations.
Kwan said finance reform was
next on the task force's agenda.
Other areas of the bylaws will also
be considered next quarter if the
task force does not have time to
discuss them before the Nov. 29
senate meeting, she added.
The task force will present its
preliminary recommendations for
student input in dorm polls Nov.
7, and will submit its report to the
senate Nov. 29 for "previous
notice," a preliminary step in
amending the senate bylaws.
The task force, which was cre
ated Oct. 4 by the ASSU Senate,
meets every Wednesday at 7 p.m.
at the ASSU offices. Meetings are
open to the public, and any stu
dent may participate.
