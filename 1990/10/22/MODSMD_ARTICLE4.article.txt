# Ethnic theme houses struggle to be both home and classroom
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
When Ujamaa, the black theme
house, was founded 20 years ago, only
30 percent of its residents were black.
Today, that figure is closer to 60 percent.
In many ways, the growth of the
black theme house reflects the growth of
the entire ethnic theme house system at
Stanford, which today also includes
Casa Zapata, the Chicano and Mexican-
American theme house; Muwekma-tah
ruk, the Native American theme house;
and Okada, the Asian-American theme
house.
But the growth of the system is not
necessarily indicative of a growing con
sensus on the merits of theme houses.
the houses strive for commu
nity and inclusion of all students, some
former residents claim the issue of race
can divide a dorm community.
Ethnic theme houses originated

Last in a five-part series on Stanford's
ethnic theme houses.

because there were few students of color
at Stanford and "there was a need for
[these studentsl to come home to an
environment that was comfortable and
supportive," Acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson said.
This goal remains a mission of ethnic
theme houses today, although tne num

ber of students of color at Stanford has
increased.
Minority students "have needs that
are different," said Jack Chin, resident
fellow at Okada and acting director of
the Row. "We want places where these
students can have their needs
addressed."
Besides being a physical home for the
students who live in the theme houses,
the dormitories also serve as "psycho
logical homes" for other non-resident
members of that ethnic group, Robinson
said. "Just knowing the houses exist is a
comfort," he said.
But theme houses today also serve a
second, equally important, purpose:
cross-cultural outreach. Theme houses
aim to "celebrate the culture within the
entire campus community" as well as
"offer an environment for minority stu
dents where they can feel somewhat

more in the majority," said Greg
Rides, multicultural educator for
the Office of Residential Educa
tion.
When you have only two or
three students of a certain ethnic
ity in a dorm, "you can't expect
them to teach the rest of the
dorm," Chin said. For this reason,
it is important for ethnic theme
houses to educate the entire cam
pus, he said.
This challenge of serving these
two purposes is particularly acute
for members of the residence staff,
who have to work in a community
"where the notions of minority
and majority don't mean what
we've been taught they mean,"
said Ujamaa RF Rachel Bagby.
In addition to resident assis
tants and RFs, ethnic theme
houses also have theme associ
ates, who apply for their jobs in a
similar fashion to that of RAs.
They are in charge of dorm pro
gramming "to present the theme
and educate and stimulate folks

living in the house about the
house," said Mary Haynes, resi
dence dean for West Campus.
Drawing into the houses
Theme houses are included
among most other campus resi
dences in the annual undergradu
ate housing draw. But unlike
other residences, there are some
special rules for placing residents
in theme houses.
Students who are of the theme
house's designated ethnicity
receive an automatic ethnic prior
ity. Although there is no minimum
or maximum requirement for eth
nicity in a dorm, 50 percent of the
house's spaces are set aside for
people with the house's ethnic pri
ority, according to Barb Kline-
Schoder, undergraduate housing
supervisor at the Housing Center.
The remaining spaces are filled
by students, regardless of ethnic
ity, who have received the regular
dorm priority from the house, she
said.
If there are still openings, stu
dents without priorities are
assigned. Those of the designated
ethnicity are taken first, Kline-
Schoder added.

In past years, it was difficult to
fill the reserved half of the house
with students of the designated
ethnicities, Kline-Schoder said,
but recently this has become less
of a problem.
While the 50 percent goal is not
a requirement, this year all four
ethnic theme houses are very close
to that target. Out of 30 residents
in Muwekma-tah-ruk, 16 are
Native Americans, compared to 13
last year and 11 the year before,
said Muwekma-tah-ruk RF Jim
Larimore, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs and director of the
Native American Cultural Center.
Sixty percent of Ujamaa's resi
dents are black and the percentage
of black students "has hovered
around that figure" for the past
severed years, Bagby said. Simi
larly, in Okada, 60 percent of the
residents are Asian-American,
Chin said.
And in Zapata the residents are
split about evenly between Chi
cano/Latino students and non-
Chicano/Latinos, said RF Tony
Burciaga. However, according to
Zapata theme associate Marty
Grimes, a senior, the small size of
the Chicano/Latino community at

Stanford sometimes makes it diffi
cult to reach this 50 percent goal.
Challenging environment
Living in a theme dorm can
provide a challenging learning
experience for residents. "Lots of
people don't make the effort to
understand racial issues, but
when you live there and it's right
in front of you and you're forced
to deal with it, I think it's some
thing that stretches you," said
senior Joe Cha, who lived in Uja
maa as a freshman.
"I don't think all the buz
zwords that people use like 'multi
culturalism' and 'racial under
standing' would mean as much to
me [if I had not lived in a theme
house]," Cha said.
Senior Anita DeLucio, an RAin
Zapata, noted a theme house is
"the most comfortable setting to
experience another culture,"
because getting to meet people
one-on-one helps to break down
stereotypes.
Sophomore Anna Olson, who is
white, drew into Ujamaa as her
first choice this year. As a fresh
man, "I felt kind of disturbed at
the atmosphere between black

and white students," said Olson,
who went to a mostly black high
school and "was used to being in
the minority."
Olson said she drew into Uja
maa because she thought it would
be "an interesting, low-key way to
find out more about what was
going on, where the divisions
come from."
Students often learn about
more than just the house's desig
nated ethnicity. At Okada, the eth
nic theme is "a springboard to dis
cussing concepts and issues facing
everybody," said RA Steve Kim, a
senior.
Sense of community
Ultimately, this challenge and
learning process leads residents to
a better understanding of the cul
ture they are studying and a feel
ing of community which many
theme house residents say is
stronger than in other non-theme
dorms.
"Zapata has more of a sense of
community than any other dorm
I've seen at Stanford," Zapata
theme associate Grimes said,
adding that he thinks the stress
on family in Chicano,'Latino cul

ture is a source of this unity.
Although he is not a Chicano,
Grimes requested to live in Zapata
freshman year, and now, "I almost
feel a part of the Chicano commu
nity at Stanford," he said.
Many people said they thought
the theme added to a sense of corm
munity in the dorm. "Because
Okada is a theme dorm, that gives
it an extra sense of focus and com*-
munity, a purpose and a mission
to you being there," said senior
Brian Clark, an Ujamaa resident
who lived in Okada his freshman
year.
Theme houses also strive to
offer a home to all residents, not
only the members of a particular
ethnic community. "Zapata is a
home first for everybody," Burcir
aga said. "When we choose out*
staff, we choose a staff that's
diverse and form a team to make
sure everybody is welcome."
Residence staffs in theme
houses may also face the addi
tional challenge of making stu
dents who are not of the house's
focus ethnicity feel at home.
Bagby said "It's not difficult for
me to welcome them, but whether
or not everyone feels welcome is
more a function of their back
ground and their experiences in
the house."
At Zapata, Burciaga said, the
staff used to see a few residents
who refused to get involved. "We
couldn't bring them out so we left
them alone," he said, adding that
this hasn't been a problem in the
past few years.
Yet, some past residents say
they occasionally felt the theme of
the house detracted from the com
munity. "It was a community of
black people and not a community
of everybody," according to 1990
graduate Josh Zander, who lived
in Ujamaa as a sophomore.
Cha, who was house president
of Ujamaa in his freshman year,
said he occasionally felt intimi
dated by RAs who thought that
"ethnic programming was more
important than other successful
dorm programming."
Junior Dave Scudamore, who
lived in Ujamaa as a freshman,
concurred. "There weren't many
times where we came together just
for the sake of being a dorm and
not for the mission of the dorm,"
he said.
Both Burciaga and Chin
emphasized their houses offer a
wide variety of programming. "We
don't want to overkill with too
much Chicano programming,"
Burciaga said.
Sense of alienation
Nevertheless, an emphasis on
one particular culture can be
alienating for students who are
not of that culture. Senior Jeff
Faucette said all of the program
ming was on racism during the
first quarter of his freshman year
in Okada. He and many other non-
Asian students "felt alienated"
and many expressed resentment
at the programming, he said.
The first program senior Millie
Gong attended in Ujamaa as a
freshman was a big group meeting
about black and white issues,
which was "really shocking" to
her, she said. Gong, who is Asian,
said "at times I was really con
fused because I wasn't black and I
wasn't white."
Sophomore Joe Matal, who
lived in Ujamaa last year, said he
felt "the dorm wasn't prepared to
deal with non-black freshmen."
Matal said he and his friends,
"basically the non-black fresh
men," sometimes felt as if they
weren't included in the dorm. "We

sort of existed outside of the
theme," he said.
Senior Gabe Kahn, who lived in
Ujamaa as a freshman, said he
definitely felt like he didn't belong
some times, and"in a lot of ways I
didn't." When he lived there, "the
emphasis was for the black resi
dents of the house to have a place
to feel comfortable," he said. "I
have no problem with that, but it
was a little awkward sometimes."
Scudamore said although there
were some people who felt as if
they didn't belong, the RAs made
"a huge effort" to make everyone
feel at home.
At Zapata, the staff took steps
to help make the dorm more inclu
sive for all students and also for
the entire Chicano/Latino com
munity, Burciaga said.
Since he and his wife, Cecilia,
became the Zapata RFs six years
ago, they have tried to "de-empha
size the Chicano nationalism and
political atmosphere that had
been so uncomfortable for peo
ple," Burciaga said. "People want
to live where they can feel com
fortable and not have to pull out
their political credentials."
Issues of separatism
Despite the striving for unity,
some students still feel the theme
dorm community is divided at
times. Faucette said his dorm was
"very divided" between freshmen
and upperclassmen who wanted to
live there and "freshmen who
were stuck there or upperclass
men who drew badly and were
stuck there."
Ujamaa resident Clark also
said he noticed this division in the
two theme dorms he has lived in.
But he said he feels it is a positive
aspect of theme houses because
minority students often have sim
ilar experiences in a non-ethnic
theme dorm.
Theme dorms also are often

charged that they are separatist
communities, isolating them
selves from the rest of campus.
Many residents argued that ethnic
theme dorms are no more sepa
ratist than other communities
which come together for a specific
purpose.
"Is choosing a major based on
your intellectual interests sepa
ratist or divisive?" Ujamaa RF
Bagby asked. "I think the same
principle holds."
Stanford has a unique system
of residences that "tries to meet
the needs of all students" and
offers many different choices,
Robinson said. "I don't view mak
ing choices as the same thing as
self-separation," he said.
Okada RF Chin noted a theme
house is just "a group of people
who choose to live together like
people choosing to live in Adams
(the Human Biology focus house)
because they're interested in Hum
Bio or a fraternity because they're
interested in that sense of broth
erhood."
Ricks said he thinks theme
houses "are no more divisive than
any other house."
Senior Irene Lin, an RA who is
living in Okada for her third year,
said she thinks the charge of sepa
ratism is "more a reflection of the
thought that mainstream white
society is the right society" than of
the reality of the dorms.
Future of theme houses
Robinson said the one disad
vantage he sees to theme houses
"relates specifically to the fact
that the numbers of students of
color is limited. Since large num
bers are living in theme houses,
fewer are in the other houses."
But as the population of stu
dents of color increases at Stan
ford, this problem may diminish.
The fact that this year's freshman
class is 42 percent minority takes

a certain strain off the theme
houses, which in the past had to
present programs in their own
houses and send them to other
dorms that requested them, Bur
ciaga said. Now, with more minor
ity students in other dorms, resi
dents can put on their own pro
gramming, he said.
As more students of color come
to Stanford, Robinson said he
hopes "other houses would take
on the qualities of theme houses
and provide supportive environ
ments" for these students.
Olson said she views theme
houses as an "intermediate step."
She said she "would like to think
that someday people will be com
fortable enough with each other
that there won't be such a need
for support in the minority com
munities. They won't need a place
to go so they can feel safe."
Whether or not they will be
necessary in the future, theme
houses have "been enjoying good
health" in the past several years,
Robinson said. "Theme houses
have their ups and downs like all
houses. At the moment we're in
an up."
