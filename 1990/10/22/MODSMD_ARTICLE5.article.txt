### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
For incoming freshmen, living in an
ethnic theme dorm presents an addi
tional set of challenges beyond those of
the usual freshman experience.
Freshmen live in all the ethnic theme
houses, except for Muwekma-tah-ruk,
the Native American theme house,
which is located on the Row and is some

housing.
The process of assigning freshmen to
ethnic theme houses works in a fashion

similar to the Draw, as 60 percent of the
freshman slots are reserved for students
of the designated ethnicities, Asst.
Housing Center Director Bill Georges
said.
Ethnic theme houses are the only
dorms in which any incoming freshman
can specifically request to live, and

increase in requests in the last few

There was a "significant increase" in
the number of requests for Casa Zapata,
