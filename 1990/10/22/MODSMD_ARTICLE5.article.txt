# Apprehension, rewards greet new students in theme dorms
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
For incoming freshmen, living in an
ethnic theme dorm presents an addi
tional set of challenges beyond those of
the usual freshman experience.
Freshmen live in all the ethnic theme
houses, except for Muwekma-tah-ruk,
the Native American theme house,
which is located on the Row and is some
what isolated from other freshman
housing.
The process of assigning freshmen to
ethnic theme houses works in a fashion

similar to the Draw, as 60 percent of the
freshman slots are reserved for students
of the designated ethnicities, Asst.
Housing Center Director Bill Georges
said.
Ethnic theme houses are the only
dorms in which any incoming freshman
can specifically request to live, and
Georges said his office has seen an
increase in requests in the last few
years.
There was a "significant increase" in
the number of requests for Casa Zapata,
the Chicano and Mexican-Ameri
can theme house, this year with
55 requests compared to 33 last
year. Requests for Okada, the
Asian-American theme house,
rose from 26 last year to 31 this
year, and requests for Ujamaa, the
black theme house, remained
about the same, 33 this year com
pared to 34 last year.
Georges attributed the slight
drop in requests for Ujamaa to the
smaller number of black students
in this year's entering freshman
class.
Although the Housing Center
is usually able to honor most
requests, it is not always possible.
This year there were so many
requests for Zapata that the cen
ter had to assign some of the
freshmen to other houses in Stern
Hall near Zapata.
Senior Anita DeLucio, a resi
dent assistant in Zapatr said the
house's Project Motivation pro
gram during Prospective Fresh
man Week has contributed to this
rise. "Ever since it was initiated
(four years ago) a lot of people
have requested to live in Zapata,"
she said.
But among the freshmen
requesting to live in an ethnic
theme dorm, there is "usually not
a large number" not of that

house's ethnicity, Georges said. Of
the 55 freshmen who requested to
live in Zapata this year, only 10
were not Chicano/Latinos.
There is disagreement among
present and future residents of
theme houses as to whether fresh
men who do not request to live in
a theme dorm should be randomly
placed there. And each year, the
Housing Center gets requests
from students who have been
placed in an ethnic theme dorm
and want to move.
"We don't get very many"
requests to move, but there are
usually one or two every year,
Georges said. The office tries to
explain to the students about
theme houses and allows them to
speak to former residents, resi
dent fellows and the Office of Res
idential Education. "Usually by
that point students are more com
fortable with the theme houses,"
he said.
If a student still wants to move,
he or she "would be treated like
any other student requesting
reassignment," Georges said,
adding that very few students are
ever moved.
Often a student who is reluc
tant to live in a theme house may
change his or her mind after arriv
ing at Stanford. Senior Steve Kim,
now an RAin Okada, was ran
domly placed in Okada his fresh
man year.
"The fact that it was an ethnic
theme house, even though I'm

Asian-American, made me a bit
apprehensive at first," he said.
But during freshman year, "all my
apprehensions were allayed," Kim
said. "In a way I've come full cir
cle, from a freshman who had no
desire to live there to a senior
RA."
Many other present and former
theme house residents said they
were disappointed to hear they
had been placed in a theme dorm,
and some said they requested to
move.
Senior Joe Cha said his parents
wanted him to move when they
found out he had been placed in
Ujamaa as a freshman. "More
inclined to listen to my parents
than to be indifferent," Cha called
the Housing Center, but he said he
was told that "unless you have
serious qualms there's nothing
you can do."
But Cha added he does know of
two people in his freshman class
whose requests to move from Uja
maa were granted.
But while many originally
wanted to move, the mtyority of
these students also noted that,
looking back on their freshman
experiences, they are glad they
remained in the theme houses.
"Some of the best life experi
ences people have just sort of hap
pen bv chance." Muwekma-tah
ruk RF Jim Larimore said. "Eth
nic theme houses may seem a lit
tle threatening, but the best thing
that can happen to folks in that

situation is to be exposed to it."
Betty Ng, a sophomore who
requested to live in Okada last
year and drew back into the dorm
this year, said she thinks being
randomly placed in a theme house
can be a valuable learning experi
ence for a freshman. And "when
they get out of college, chances are
they'll have to interact with us
(minorities) anyway," she added.
"If someone really has a prob
lem with it, then they probably
need to be there," said Dave Scud
amore, a junior who was randomly
placed in Ujamaa his freshman
year.
Greg Ricks, multicultural edu
cator for Res Ed, agreed the expe
rience can teach a non-minority
student a great deal. "Msyority
students don't really understand
what it's like to be in a minority
situation most of the time," he
said.
He added he doesn't think peo
ple who are opposed to randomly
placing freshmen in a theme
house are opposed to the system.
"What they're saying is that white
students shouldn't have to be in a
minority situation, but non-white
students have no choice about
that," he said.
"If being in a theme dorm is a
personal crisis to them, then they
should have the option to move,"
said Ujamaa resident Brian Clark,
a senior who lived in Okada his
freshman year. "But if you're a
minority student and you're

placed in a 'normal' dorm, you're
basically being placed in a white
theme dorm."
Kim stressed his theme dorm,
like others, "is a home first and
the theme house is something
extra. Freshmen are being placed
into a warm community based on
trust."
Nevertheless, living in a theme
dorm where difficult issues are
sometimes more visible can be a
stressful experience for a student
just entering Stanford. "Some
times it may be the best thing that
ever happened to [students]. But
adjusting to college is tough
enough and if you're put in a tense
situation, it can be even tougher,"
said 1990 graduate Josh Zander,

who lived in Ujamaa his sopho
more year.
Senior Paula Gani was placed
in Zapata her freshman year.
Thinking that living in the house
would "narrow [her] experience"
she requested to move, but her
request was denied. "Entering
Stanford as a freshman is hard
enough," she said. "I don't think
it's fair that Res Ed decides you
should have an experience you
may not want to have."
Burciaga agreed. "I don't think
any student who doesn't want to
be here should be here." But he
added that the experience can be
worthwhile for anyone. "You don't
necessarily like [the theme], but
you learn to understand it and
appreciate it,"he said.
