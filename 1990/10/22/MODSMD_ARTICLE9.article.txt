Higher taxes are on the way
WASHINGTON (AP) — Budget negotiators swapped offers on
taxing the wealthy yesterday as congressional leaders narrowed
differences over a $250 billion deficit-reduction bill that would
reach into the wallets of virtually all Americans.
Bush administration officials pushed a plan, first floated late
Saturday, to boost the income-tax rate on the richest taxpayers
from 28 percent to 31 percent.
Democrats rejected the proposal and responded with a coun
teroffer of their own. With Republicans fearful that Democrats
are claiming responsibility for the tax-the-rich battle cry barely
two weeks from Election Day, White House aides said higher
levies on the rich were on the way.
South creates literacy forum
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Officials from 13 Southern states and
Puerto Rico labeled their region yesterday as the least educated in

Forum to combat the problem.
"There are thousands of individual literacy programs out
there. A lot of good is going on, but it's like dipping the Mississippi
River dry with a teaspoon," former Mississippi Gov. William F.
Winter wrote in a report released at a news conference.
"A center will help us coordinate, on a regional basis, what has
to be one of the most important projects that anybody can be
involved in,"he wrote.

Thursday because of food and other shortages in Puerto Cabezas,
450 miles northeast of Managua, and that several people were
killed.
