# USW rep files felony charge
## O&M's practice of taping calls violates state law, she says 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
A field representative of the United
Stanford Workers has filed a felony
charge against the University, claiming
that a branch of Operations and Mainte
nance violated state law for four years
by recording incoming and outgoing
telephone calls without the knowledge
of the party at the other end of the line.
Work control, the division in ques
tion, is a centralized O&M operation
staffed by four dispatchers who handle
calls ranging from "fix-it" orders to per
sonal messages left by family members.
Linda Crouse, a temporary USW field
representative, maintained that moni
toring phone calls without notifying the
end party is a violation of the state penal
code under the "Eavesdropping on or
Recording Confidential Communica
tions" provision.
The code reads, "Every person who,
intentionally and without the consent of
all parties to a confidential communica
tion . .. eavesdrops upon or records the

confidential communication" is liable to
punishment by a fine or imprisonment
in the county jail or state prison.
John Schwartz, University vice pres
ident and general counsel, countered
Crouse's charges by citing the state
penal code's definition of "confidential
communication."
The code defines confidential com
munication as including "any communi
cation carried on in circumstances as
may reasonably indicate that any party
to the communication desires it to be
confined to the parties thereto."
Schwartz said work orders and per
sonal messages are not intended to be
confidential. For example, if a caller
with an overflowing toilet expects the
message to be confidential, the dispatch
ers will not be allowed to relay the work
order to the plumber.
According to Bill Witscher, acting
director of O&M, phone calls are
recorded for legal reasons. If someone
files a suit against the department
regarding a specific work order, the
tapes can be used to verify if such an

order has been placed.
The recording is kept for a maximum
of 30 days, and the tapes are then
reused unless there is a specific request
to keep them, Witscher said. There is
"no listening to the tapes whatsoever,"
he said.
The practice of recording phone calls
has been ongoing for more than 15
years, Witscher said. Before the depart
ment moved to its current location
between Bonair Siding and Serra Street
about four years ago, the phones used to
have beeps warning callers that conver
sations were being monitored.
With the University phone system,
however, the practice has been discon
tinued. "I don't know the reason," said
Witscher, who replaced former O&M
Director Ralph Buchanan this fall.
The work control station has four
business lines and one personal line for
the dispatchers' use. One dispatcher
expressed surprise when she learned
from her colleagues that even the per-
