ANC proposes meeting between
Mandela and Buthelezi
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) —
The African National Congress recommended
yesterday that Nelson Mandela meet rival
black leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a break
through that could help ease the violence in
black townships.
The ANC proposed a meeting between itself
and Buthelezi's conservative Inkatha Freedom
Party "in the near future," but did not specify
a date. The ANC statement said both Mandela
and Buthelezi should attend.
Buthelezi said he welcomed the offer and
was ready to consider a suitable time and place
for the talks. Mandela is in Australia and will
be traveling throughout Asia until early
November.
The ANC was conciliatory in its statement
yesterday.
The group said it welcomed "the steps being
taken jointly by the ANC and the Inkatha
Freedom Party" to stop the violence.
The two sides have been holding periodic
peace talks, but neither Mandela nor Buthelezi
has attended.
About 5,000 blacks have died in the ANC-
Inkatha power struggle since 1986 in Natal
Province. The fighting spread to the Johannes
burg area in August and has claimed 800 lives.
Male contraceptive beats the pill
GENEVA (AP) — The World Health Organiza
tion said yesterday that tests on four conti
nents show weekly hormone injections for men
could be a more effective birth control method
than the pill.
The agency said the technique used a hor
mone preparation, testosterone enanthate,
that is already in use for other purposes. It
halts sperm production.
The WHO said the research involved 271
men, of whom 157 received weekly injections of
the hormone. Their partners stopped using
any other form of contraception for a year.
"There was only one pregnancy during
1,486 months of exposure, an extremely high
contraceptive efficacy, comparable to that of
female ii\jectable contraceptives, better than
that of oral contraceptives and intrauterine
devices, and substantially better than that of
condoms," the WHO said.
Feinstein defends own record,
blames Wilson for crime
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dianne Feinstein
attacked Pete Wilson's record yesterday, blam
ing her Republican gubernatorial opponent for
raw sewage in San Diego Bay and rampant
crime in California's cities.
With election day only two weeks away,
Feinstein defended her own record as San
Francisco's mayor. She said Wilson and Repub
lican Gov. George Deukmejian looked the other
way as California became America's drug traf
ficking capital.
Wilson remained in Washington yesterday,
where he is trapped by federal budget battles.
But an aide called Feinstein's allegations
half truths. There is no raw sewage in San
Diego Bay, and Feinstein's crime statistics are
distorted, said James Lee, Wilson's deputy
press secretary.
Wilson and Feinstein have been trying in
recent weeks to persuade voters that major dif
ferences separate their candidacies.
Over the weekend, Wilson launched a new
radio commercial in which he claims a better
record on taxes and spending than Feinstein,
and asserts he would be tougher on crime.
