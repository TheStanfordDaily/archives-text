WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush vetoed a major civil rights bill
yesterday and seemed assured of win
ning a battle in Congress to override
him. "I deeply regret having to take
this action," Bush said.
The president called on lawmakers
to enact his version of the measure
before they quit for the year, probably
later this week. However, that
appeared unlikely, as Bush's critics
scoffed at his proposal.
The administration argued that the
bill, as passed by Congress, would force
businesses to adopt quotas in hiring
and promotion. Supporters of the mea
sure rejected the White House argu
ment and portrayed Bush's stand as a

measure of his commitment on human
rights.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
the chief Senate sponsor, called the
veto "tragic and disgraceful."
"When the chips are down, the
White House is against civil rights,"
Kennedy said. He urged Congress to
override the president.
Ralph G. Neas, executive director of
the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, said Bush's veto "will victim
ize his presidency forever. He joins
Andrew Johnson and Ronald Reagan
as the only presidents to veto a civil
rights bill."
The bill was passed by the Senate
62-34 and by the House 273-154 —

strong majorities, but not reaching the
two-thirds required to override a veto.
Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif.,
the prime House sponsor, said he
would not even ask for an override vote
without the two-thirds needed by sup
porters. "I'm just not going to waste
any more time," Hawkins said, adding
that civil rights forces might even lose
support in an override fight.
In his veto message, Bush said,
"The temptation to support a bill —
any bill — simply because its title
includes the words 'civil rights' is very
strong.
"But when our efforts, however
well-intentioned, result in quotas,
equal opportunity is not advanced but

thwarted," he said. "The very commit
ment to justice and equality that is
offered as the reason why this bill
should be signed requires me to veto
it."
He said, "I deeply regret having to
take this action with a bill bearing
such a title, especially since it contains
certain provisions that I strongly
endorse."
The measure would nullify six
Supreme Court decisions that have
made it more difficult for women and
minorities to prove and win job dis
crimination suits. It would ban racial
harassment in the workplace and allow
punitive damages in the most serious
discrimination cases.
