# Iraq will free some hostages
## Meanwhile, oil prices free fall

Saddam Hussein will free some sick and elderly
Americans from among the hundreds of U.S. citizens
detained by Baghdad since its Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the leader of an Iraqi-American £roup said
yesterday.
It was not immediately clear when the releases
might come, or how many Americans would be
affected.
"We don't want to talk about figures or names at
the moment, but I'm happy to announce that some
good news will come up," said Salim Mansour, leader
of the Maryland-based Iraqi-American Foundation.
There was also good news for the U.S. economy.
Oil prices plunged $5.41 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, closing at $29.60 — the
biggest one-day drop in exchange history. In London,
North Sea Brent Blend oil plunged $5.65 a barrel to
close at $26.75.
The prices dropped following reported remarks by
Saudi Arabia's defense minister Sunday that Arab
nations were willing to grant Iraq "all its rights."
The market interpreted that as a sign Saudi Arabia
was prepared to agree to territorial concessions by
Kuwait.
The same day, however, Prince Sultan reiterated
that "any solution must provide for an uncondi
tional Iraqi pullout from Kuwait and the return of
the rule of the al-Sabah family,"
Another factor was said to be reports of a dream
Saddam supposedly had. The Kuwaiti newspaper Al-
Seyassah said Saddam dreamed the prophet
Mohammed appeared before him and told Saddam
Iraq's missiles "were pointed in the wrong direc
tion." The missiles are pointed south toward Saudi

Arabia, where hundreds of thousands of Western
forces have massed since the invasion.
Al-Seyassah said Iraqi intelligence was spreading
the story around Baghdad in an apparent attempt to
prepare Iraqis psychologically for a pullout.
The report could not be independently confirmed.
Al-Seyassah is an arm of the ousted government of
Kuwait, and has been trying to discredit Saddam.
Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, oil prices
have fluctuated wildly on world markets, passing

$40 a barrel at times compared with pre-crisis levels
of $22 a barrel.
In other developments:
—The State Department said yesterday that Iraqi
military forces captured most of Kuwait's arsenal of
U.S. Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and evidently are
trying to learn how to use the weapons.
— Britain said that Iraqi troops in Kuwait
rounded up seven more British citizens and were to
transfer them to Iraq.
