# Congress passes sweeping pollution-control bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - House and
Senate negotiators approved a clean
air bill yesterday that is expected to
eventually cost the economy $22 bil
lion a year and affect most of American
society by toughening pollution con
trols on automobiles, factories and
power plants.
The bargainers worked out the final
details before dawn, ending more than
a year of bargaining between the two
chambers. Late yesterday afternoon,
the conference committee gave the
measure formal endorsement, with
only Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-
Calif., opposing it.

Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, called the legisla
tion "historic in its significance" and
said he expected both the Senate and
House to endorse it and President
Bush to sign it into law. Final approval
from both chambers is expected by
week's end.
Bush, meanwhile, noted that
tougher clean-air legislation "has been
13 years in coming" and said that "no
American should have to wait another
day for clean air."
Republican members of the clean
air conference, including Rep. Norman
Lent of New York and Sen. John

Chafee of Rhode Island, predicted that
Bush would sign the bill.
Late yesterday, White House offi
cials indicated that the president
would likely look favorably on the bill,
including the compromise job-assis
tance program.
Under the legislation, there would
be drastic reductions in emissions of
acid rain pollutants and toxic indus
trial chemicals.
The new requirements would be
expensive, although cost estimates
vary widely.
The White House estimates the leg
islation would cost the economy $11

billion a year by 1995 and $22 billion
to $25 billion annually by 2005, when
the bill's provisions would take full
effect. Industry estimates have put the
cost in the $30 billion to $50 billion
range toward the end of the decade.
While conceding that the controls
would cost in the tens of billions of dol
lars, environmentalists have argued
that much of the cost can be expected
to be made up from savings in health
costs. The American Lung Association
estimates that perhaps $50 billion a
year could be saved in reduced health
expenses from cleaner air.
