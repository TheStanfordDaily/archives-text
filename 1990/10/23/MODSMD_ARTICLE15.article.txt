# Judge gives full custody to genetic parents
## 
### 
SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - A
test-tube baby boy belongs with
his genetic parents rather than
with the surrogate mother who
carried him, a judge ruled yester
day, saying shared custody would
"split the child emotionally."
"This is a glorious day," Mark
Calvert, 34, said outside the cus
tody hearing after the ruling giv
ing sole parental rights to him and
his wife, Crispina, 36.
Calvert gently kissed his wife
as Orange County Superior Court
Judge Richard Parslow rejected
surrogate mother Anna Johnson's
effort to be recognized as a third
parent of the 5-week-old boy.
The judge in the custody hear
ing said "a three-parent, two nat
ural-mom situation is ripe for
crazy-making. I decline to split
this child emotionally ... A sur
rogate carrying a genetic child for
a couple does not acquire parental
rights."
Parslow upheld the contract
under which the Tustin couple
agreed to pay Ms. Johnson
$10,000 to carry an embryo con
ceived during test-tube, or invitro,
fertilization using the Calverts'
sperm and egg. So far, she has
been paid $5,000.
Mrs. Calvert can't carry a baby
because she had a hysterectomy.
Attorneys had said the dispute
could break new legal ground
because a genetically unrelated
surrogate never has sought cus
tody. The famous Baby M case in
New Jersey involved a surrogate
mother who was also the baby's
genetic mother.
"In this case we have a family
unit, all genetically related," the
judge said of the Calverts and the
batw.
Christopher Michael Calvert

will be the name entered on the
child's birth certificate, which was
held up by the dispute, the father
said.
Ms. Johnson, 29, of Mission
Viejo, was not in court. Later, at a
news conference, she was asked
her reaction to the ruling.
"To sum it up in one word:
heartbroken," she said. "I'm in a
deep state of mourning for my
son. He's going to be very con
fused. He's going to be looking for
me.
She said she would appeal all
the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court if necessary, and tearfully
recalled her last visit with the
baby.

"I just held him close to me, let
him nuzzle up into my shoulder
and whispered in his ear that
mommy's trying her hardest to
get him back," she said.
Parslow predicted the "hung
er" of childless couples for their
own children would spur more
people to pursue similar surrogate
arrangements.
"In my view, surrogacy con
tracts in in-vitro fertilization
cases are not void or in violation
or public policy," he said.
The judge said Johnson
appears to be articulate and intel
ligent, so "I don't think the
Calverts conned Anna into this
agreement."

Parslow also urged California's
Legislature to regulate such con
tracts.
The judge had earlier granted
the Calverts temporary custody.
During a six-day hearing,
Johnson's attorneys argued she
and the baby developed an unex
pected, deep emotional attach
ment during pregnancy.
"The only bonding Anna John
son has is with your television
camera," Calvert told reporters
after the ruling.
Parslow said Johnson made a
"substantial contribution" to the
child. But he questioned the sin
cerity of her attachment to the
baby.
The Calverts said they would
consider the judge's suggestion
that they keep Ms. Johnson
informed of the child's progress
by letter.
The American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California
denounced the decision. It had
filed a brief urging Parslow to rule
all three adults were legitimate
parents.
"We are entering into very dan
gerous times if we allow the cre
ation of a breeder class of women
whose parental rights can be
signed away in a business deal,"
the group's executive director,
Ramona Ripston, said in Los
Angeles.
The ruling is a "radical depar
ture from the pre-existing law,"
said Susan M. Wolf, an associate
for law at the Hastings Center, a
nonprofit ethics research institute
in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
"The judge is saying gestation
doesn't count, it counts for noth
ing, and I think that is a very dis
turbing outcome," Wolf added.

Mark and Crlaplna Calvert show their Joy In court yesterday after a
Superior Court judge ruled that the Calverts, as the genetic parents,
will be given full custody of a test tube baby.
SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - A
test-tube baby boy belongs with
his genetic parents rather than
with the surrogate mother who
carried him, a judge ruled yester
day, saying shared custody would
"split the child emotionally."
"This is a glorious day," Mark
Calvert, 34, said outside the cus
tody hearing after the ruling giv
ing sole parental rights to him and
his wife, Crispina, 36.
Calvert gently kissed his wife
as Orange County Superior Court
Judge Richard Parslow rejected
surrogate mother Anna Johnson's
effort to be recognized as a third
parent of the 5-week-old boy.
The judge in the custody hear
ing said "a three-parent, two nat
ural-mom situation is ripe for
crazy-making. I decline to split
this child emotionally ... A sur
rogate carrying a genetic child for
a couple does not acquire parental
rights."
Parslow upheld the contract
under which the Tustin couple
agreed to pay Ms. Johnson
$10,000 to carry an embryo con
ceived during test-tube, or invitro,
fertilization using the Calverts'
sperm and egg. So far, she has
been paid $5,000.
Mrs. Calvert can't carry a baby
because she had a hysterectomy.
Attorneys had said the dispute
could break new legal ground
because a genetically unrelated
surrogate never has sought cus
tody. The famous Baby M case in
New Jersey involved a surrogate
mother who was also the baby's
genetic mother.
"In this case we have a family
unit, all genetically related," the
judge said of the Calverts and the
batw.
Christopher Michael Calvert

will be the name entered on the
child's birth certificate, which was
held up by the dispute, the father
said.
Ms. Johnson, 29, of Mission
Viejo, was not in court. Later, at a
news conference, she was asked
her reaction to the ruling.
"To sum it up in one word:
heartbroken," she said. "I'm in a
deep state of mourning for my
son. He's going to be very con
fused. He's going to be looking for
me.
She said she would appeal all
the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court if necessary, and tearfully
recalled her last visit with the
baby.

"I just held him close to me, let
him nuzzle up into my shoulder
and whispered in his ear that
mommy's trying her hardest to
get him back," she said.
Parslow predicted the "hung
er" of childless couples for their
own children would spur more
people to pursue similar surrogate
arrangements.
"In my view, surrogacy con
tracts in in-vitro fertilization
cases are not void or in violation
or public policy," he said.
The judge said Johnson
appears to be articulate and intel
ligent, so "I don't think the
Calverts conned Anna into this
agreement."

Parslow also urged California's
Legislature to regulate such con
tracts.
The judge had earlier granted
the Calverts temporary custody.
During a six-day hearing,
Johnson's attorneys argued she
and the baby developed an unex
pected, deep emotional attach
ment during pregnancy.
"The only bonding Anna John
son has is with your television
camera," Calvert told reporters
after the ruling.
Parslow said Johnson made a
"substantial contribution" to the
child. But he questioned the sin
cerity of her attachment to the
baby.
The Calverts said they would
consider the judge's suggestion
that they keep Ms. Johnson
informed of the child's progress
by letter.
The American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California
denounced the decision. It had
filed a brief urging Parslow to rule
all three adults were legitimate
parents.
