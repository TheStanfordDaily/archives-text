Recent problems and
changes within the Soviet
Union have been so dramatic
that the political economy on
which the country was founded
will certainly change further.

, economy must
change dramat
ically for the
economy of the
. Soviet Union to

recover from its desperate
problems. Capitalism and a
free-market economy is immi
nent.
Political Science Prof.
Philippe Schmitter said,
"There is no plausible alterna
tive [to capitalism! at this
moment. All of the courses of
action that are discussed
involve simply different speeds
of transformation rather than
the existence of a viable alter
native."
The change will not be easy.
Soviet intellectuals do not
believe the Soviet Union can
make a non-revolutionary
change to the free-market
economy which will inevitably
occur, said Schmitter. "The
consensus of Soviet intellectu
als seems to be that things
have to get much worse before
tat# can get much better."
The existence of damaging
special-interest groups justi
fies this pessimistic view of the

Soviet Union's problems.
According to many Soviet
intellectuals, only a
widespread collapse of the
entire economy can displace
entrenched interests, Schmit
ter said.
Within the framework of
the collapse of the current
Soviet system, the departure of
the Baltic states is inevitable.
In the collapse of the regional
economies the seeds of capital
ism and the system of barter
could emerge, said Schmitter,
echoing Soviet academic
thought.
The future of Mikhail Gor
bachev in this dismal reality is
questionable. Will he be able to
survive?
Such a question is best left
to Kremlinologists, who have
never been very accurate any
way, said Schmitter. He added,
however, that his suspicion is
that Gorbachev will survive
because he will become
increasingly impotent.
"Most of the policy
decisions will devolve to the
republican level," said Schmit
ter. "He will be left with an
important role in international
relations, but a largely sym
bolic one."
For the West, the toppling of
the Berlin wall is a sign of the
end of the Cold War. For Gor
bachev and the Soviet Union, it
is the beginning of a change
which will be much harder to
complete than the dismantling
of a wall.
