## A 						research victory 
### 
IN A MONTH IN WHICH Stan
ford beat Notre Dame in foot
ball, celebrated its Centennial
and vaulted to second place in U.S.
News and World Report's rankings
of the nation's top universities,
Prof. William Sharpe at the Busi
ness School and Physics Prof.
Richard Taylor have each won one
of the world's greatest accolades
for work they did at the University.
Sharpe received the Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Sci
ence for his research on risk
assessment models in financial eco
nomics. Sharpe's work has been
credited with literally revolutioniz
ing the investment world.
Taylor, along with several col
leagues, was awarded the Nobel
Prize for research in analyzing the
fundamental structures that make
up matter. His work sheds light on
some of the most perplexing ques
tions facing physicists today.
Because teaching at Stanford is
currently being reemphasized and

many are criticizing the priority
placed on research, it is important
to remember the role that research
plays.
The process of discovery con
stantly going on at Stanford has
attracted some of the world's
greatest minds in nearly every
field.
And it has brought some of the
world's most fascinating leaders,
speakers and students to observe,
influence and participate in that
process.
Teaching and research are not
opposite ends of the spectrum of
academic purpose, but equally
worthwhile goals whose competi
tion for University resources some
times causes us to pit one against
the other, and to lose sight of the
contributions that research makes
to the Stanford experience.
Cheers to Sharpe and Taylor for
exemplifying the accomplishments
of the University in the broadening
of human understanding.
