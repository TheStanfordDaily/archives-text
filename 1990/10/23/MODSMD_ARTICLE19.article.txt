# Ending styrofoam
## 
### 
After years of talk and
planning, Tresidder Food
Service is finally making con
crete movements to eliminate some
of its less environmentally con
scious practices.
Specifically, Tresidder Food Ser
vice manager Richard Calbow has
made it clear that Tresidder is now
willing to curb its use of styrofoam
and plastic products, pending effec
tive student support.
While we may all agree that
these actions are a great start, we
must remember that they are just
that. A start.
We still need to decide what will
replace the harmful styrofoam
cups. Waxed paper cups may not be
releasing styrofoam's ozone-deteri
orating chlorofluorocarbons, but
it's a far cry from solving our

garbage problems.
Some of the most feasible plans
for replacing styrofoam cups would
require that patrons bring in and
use their own mugs, at a discount.
It is admirable that Tresidder is
willing to take the first step for
ward. But, we should realize now
that the Stanford community is
responsible for helping with the
next several steps.
As a community, we need to pick
up the flag and take our own initia
tive. We need to start taking our
own mugs and cups to Tresidder,
even if there isn't a discount.
We should avoid use of dispos
able products, even if they are still
in abundance at Tresidder. We
need to show that we, too, are seri
ous about saving our environment.
