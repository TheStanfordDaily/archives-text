## Facing structural arrogance 
### 
T IBERTY AND ORDER ... the
devotion of our parents and
teachers." This was written by
a New York Times columnist to describe
the virtues of our society.
Makes one wonder what kind of Oz
like time-warp he lives in. Obviously, he
hasn't visited the inner heart of a few of
our bigger cities, nor does he know any of
the many families in which either the par
ent or both parents have to work and can
not "devote" too terribly much time to
their children, nor has he paid attention
to the malaise secondary education has
been suffering for the last one or two
decades.
Even more interesting — in their coin
cidence of attitude — are the words writ
ten by another columnist on the same
page: "Most people think of themselves as
closer to being rich than to being poor."
Yeah, sure buddy. Say that to one of the
many lower and lower-middle and middle
class folks around. You'd be rich in deri
sive laughter, if not in fractured teeth.
To say that these two Bills (Buckley
and Safire, respectively) are slightly out
of touch with American reality would be
kind.
Heck, let's not be kind.
Let's say that they haven't a clue of
what life is like outside the elitist, mon
eyed, hyper-intellectual strata in which
they travel, that they have a blind spot in
their vision so wide it's a wonder they can
get their blue and red striped school ties
on in the morning and, to get to the point
of all this mild ranting, that what they
have to say is wholly untrue for many of
us.

But this isn't just another squawk
about non-representation. It's an illustra
tion of structural arrogance. I don't use
the term "ignorance" because both of
these men are certainly not ignorant; I
don't use the term "racism" because it
goes beyond the problems of racism to cut
vertically into questions of classism and
power distribution.
Arrogance is an attitude, one that says,
"I don't care about you, and what's more,
I'm in such a good position that I don't
have to care about you. Your problems
aren't my problems; they're not worth
my consideration."
In the cases of which I'm speaking,
this attitude is structural because its
vehicle of expression is The New York
Times, one of the more prominent of
those institutions in this country which
shape public opinion — and public policy.
When words printed on its pages general
ize about the opinions and beliefs of
Americans, such generalizations carry a
lot of weight.
Unfortunately, the two Bills haven't
yet realized that it's getting more and
more difficult to generalize in this society
and still speak some truth. And, even
more unfortunately, the structural arro
gance which leads them to make such
claims is shared by others.
They all have one thing in common: an
outdated image of America as a land of
unbridled opportunity, with an enlight
ened, equitable governing system, popu
lated with a people all of whom are par
taking in and beneficiaries of the Ameri
can dream.
It doesn't bother them that some are

getting a hell of a lot more of that dream
than others, nor does such a thought fig
ure into how they formulate the direc
tions the government should take us.
Their reflexive reply to such a criticism
— that one just has to look around the
world to see that we, as a whole, have got
it better than everyone else — doesn't
address the fact that, as good as we've got
it, it could be better.
Now that we don't have the Commu
nist block to look down on anymore, we
should turn our noses inward and smell
the rot in our own back yard. Having
traveled a bit, I'll agree that — as a whole
— life is better here than just about any
place else, but, if you take a hard look
around, you'll realize that all that means
is that things are really screwed up else
where.
And, finally, listen up: I'm not saying
they are guilty of doing this just because
they are white, upper-class males. I don't
care who birthed them, or whether they
drink Perrier or tap-water.
None of that prevents them from open
ing their eyes a little and seeing that the
comfortable niche from which they speak
has grown to be very narrow indeed.

Jason Lewis thinks this party sucks.
Nevertheless, his column appears every
Tuesday in The Daily.
