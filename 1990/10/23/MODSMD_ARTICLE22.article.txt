## New fee refund system saves money, will soon save time 
### 
Much controversy and
confusion has surfaced over the
past few days in response to the
changes in the administration of the spe
cial ASSU Fee Refund system. The pur
pose of this letter is to provide some gen
eral information about the system, its
history and my projections for its future.
Before the special fee system, the
majority of student group activities were
subsidized by the University. However,
as student organizations continued to
proliferate and funding demands
increased, the University administration
phased out the bulk of this support.
Originally, the entire system was very
simple. There were about five or six
groups that received special fees and
each student was charged $1 for each
student organization.
Fee refunds were administered from a
cash box and the numbers of those
requesting refunds were quite small
(most refund requests were a function of

conscientious objection to the activities/
mission of a particular organization).
Because of the system's simplicity, the
ASSU absorbed the costs of its adminis
tration.
As time passed and more student
groups were awarded special fees
through the spring election process, the
role of adhering to University guidelines
by administering refunds became much
more difficult.
A complicated collection and distribu
tion schedule had to be devised by the
Financial Manager to charge each stu
dent the appropriate fee per organization
per quarter since the nice round $1 fig
ure evaporated as some groups requested
more or less than that amount.
The ASSU could no longer absorb the
higher costs of administration, and stu
dents, in addition to the fees for student
groups, were charged for the administra
tion of the system (the non-refundable
surcharge).

In response to the havoc wreaked in
the Business Office and the continually
escalating costs of its administration, I
devised this new system to get rid of the
cash, the unnecessary liability and what
I perceived as low quality service.
A lot of comments have deemed the
system crude and cumbersome (not to
mention terming me a paternalistic
slime!). It is — this quarter.
A new system of tnis magnitude takes
time to implement — this is why you
have to wait this quarter until November
to get your check — and will have many
problems initially (our ever-present Mur
phy's Law).
Next quarter's checks should be avail
able earlier, and soon you will not have
to request that your refund be mailed. It
will be done automatically and you will
only have to make one trip.
Furthermore, this new system is sav
ing you money that you don't realize you
are spending and that you can't get

refunded (recall the non-refundable sur
charge)! It also makes the lives of the
members of the Business Office staff a
lot easier.
I would also like to emphasize that
the fee refund system is an element of a
large-scale three-year plan I have initi
ated to boost the overall efficiency of the
ASSU's financial operation. We are
investigating a system where you would
be able to request refunds on-line from
your dorm or your own room.
The intention of the new system is to
ultimately save you time and money and
to increase our internal efficiency.
However, this goal of efficiency cannot
take place overnight. Please be patient
and bear with us as we continue to work
out Btn immensely complicated system
that will ultimately benefit us all. And,
please, submit constructive comments
and suggestions.
