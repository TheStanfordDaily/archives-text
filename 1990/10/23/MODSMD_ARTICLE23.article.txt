# Valid partnerships can exist without marriage licenses
## 
### 
What's so special about a marriage
license?
In response to criticism of the new
policy on domestic partners in the Oct.
16 Daily, I pose the question: to what
benefits are married people entitled that
other loving, committed couples are not?
Certainly, married couples who are
"recognized by the State of California"
may get different tax or health insurance
benefits. But, frankly, why should a mar
riage license be the measure of how com
mitted two people are to each other?
The University should try to compen
sate for the state and federal govern-

valid emotional partnership between two
individuals. The University should offer
what benefits it can to couples who fall
outside the sharply delineated category
of married couples.
And shared housing is one of the most
critical benefits the University can pro
vide. What better indication of commit
ment than when two individuals consent
to sacrifice their privacy to each other on
a long-term, ongoing basis?
By their own admission, married cou
ples are "entitled" to more benefits in
the real world. Thus, it seems surprising
that they would deny other couples these
benefits at Stanford, especially since it
seems that those with a marriage license
would probably have an easier time
securing benefits off campus than those
without.
