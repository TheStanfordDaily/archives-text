# Student's views of theme house goals were misconstrued
## 
### 
I am writing to clarify my views on
the future of Stanford's ethnic theme
houses.
The statement attributed to me in
Monday's article, through some combi
nation of misquotation and lack of
context, says that I view theme houses
as an "intermediate step" and suggests
that I believe the primary role of theme
houses is giving minority students "a
place to go so that they can feel safe."
The only sense in which the quote
represents my views lies in my hope that
the Stanford community is committed to
moving towards true inclusiveness and

multiculhirelism so that people of all
backgrounds will feel included and com
fortable in all campus residences and
activities.
That vision in no way diminishes the
importance of theme houses as gathering
places for minority communities, as
places in which the Stanford community
as a whole can learn about and celebrate
Stanford's diversity or as places for con
cerned students to express and discuss
their views on issues of race and ethnic
ity.
As far as the future is concerned, I
hope the theme houses will continue to
reexamine their role with the above goals
in mind, and also that more Stanford
students of all ethnicities will take the
opportunity to see what theme houses
have to offer.
