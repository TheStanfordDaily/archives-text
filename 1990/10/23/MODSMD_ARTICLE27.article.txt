"For both us and thp Kreen-
Akore, this winking screen of for
est acted like a porous mirror. In
it you never knew whether your
gaze would literally or metaphor
ically penetrate — to reveal the
man you sought on the other side
— mirroring the eyes and, there
fore, the motives of the seeker."
— Adrian Cowell, "The Decade
Of Destruction "
In his third book, prize winning
environmentalist filmmaker and
author Adrian Cowell reflects
upon the "pointless holocaust"
that destroyed nearly a third of
the Amazon rain forest during the
1980s.

A companion volume to his doc
umentary series by the same
name, the book is the product of a
career devoted to the study and
filming of the rain forest and its
people.
Yet, unlike many recent addi
tions to the evergrowing mass of
environmental literature, "The
Decade of Destruction" is not
merely a eulogy on the annihila
tion of Amazonia and its indige
nous peoples. Rather, Cowell
offers us a sense of hope, promot
ing the thesis that the natives of
the rain forest are the ones who
ultimately will provide a solution
to the current deforestation in
Brazil.
A personal and journalistic
account of a decade-long project
that began in 1980, the book
records many of the author's
encounters with the dramatis per

sonae of the development of east
central Brazil.
Cowell provides a chronological
history of the "civilizado," the
Indian term for white man, and
his attempt to "liberate" the
tribes of the Amazon from their
ancient culture.
But like the many explorers
before him, Cowell notes the "civ
ilizado's" knowledge of the rain
forest is insufficient, evidenced by
the many failed projects that are
"scattered around the jungles
very much like tourist litter."
Starting from 1957, the author
recounts his several journeys to
the heart of the Amazon during
crucial stages of its development.
Beginning with memoirs includ
ing the infamous Boas brothers,
the pioneers of Brazilian develop
ment, Cowell traces the cumula
tive effect of urbanization

through valuable interviews and
vivid stories.
The author likens the gradual
invasion by land speculators, min
ers, ranchers and homeless poor
to a lemming migration, one in
which visions of the forest were
distorted by false hopes of eco
nomic prosperity.
Ironically, it was the Brazilian
government that allocated park
lands for development in order to
stimulate the national economy.
However, Cowell captures the
reader with his absorbing mem
oirs about the persons resisting
the development. Despite ancient
differences, Indians and rubber
tappers unite in the defense of
their cultures, resources and vital
ity.
Perhaps the highlight of the
book is the triumph of Chico
Mendes in making the world
aware of the Amazon's destruc
tion. Especially touching for the
author, who knew Chico for the 10
years before his tragic death, the
story of the rubber-tapper's life is
told with humility, absent of emo
tional bias.
On another level, the book is a
personal odyssey of self-discovery
and exploration. "I am astonished
how often [the] pattern of roman
tic enthusiasm, sudden disaster
and sorrowing meditation has
repeated itself — both for myself
and everyone else who approaches
Amazonia."
For Cowell, the journey into
the rain forest is an individual
one, one in which nature reflects
man and his motives. It is for this
reason that Cowell believes the
Amazon native, with his personal
understanding of the forest, will
provide an answer for the ruins of
failed development in the 19905,
the "Decade of the Environment."
Over the course of 30 years,
Cowell has made several forays
into the heart of Amazonia;
however, his most recent expedi
tion seems to have proven his
most touching one.

For Cowell, the journey into
the rain forest is an individual
one, one in which nature reflects
man and his motives. It is for this
reason that Cowell believes the
Amazon native, with his personal
understanding of the forest, will
provide an answer for the ruins of
failed development in the 19905,
the "Decade of the Environment."
Over the course of 30 years,
Cowell has made several forays
into the heart of Amazonia;
however, his most recent expedi
tion seems to have proven his
most touching one.
