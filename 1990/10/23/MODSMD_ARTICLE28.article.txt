50 Simple Things You Can Do
To Save The Earth
By The Earth Works Group
Earth Works Press, $4.95, 96
pages
The handbook begins by
describing the current environ
mental situation. The greenhouse
effect, acid rain, vanishing wildlife
and ground-water pollution are
among some of the problems that
are outlined.
The authors suggest there are
three levels an individual could
choose to act on, depending on the
commitment he or she is willing to
make.
For each of the actions sug
gested, the before and after sce
narios are also described, showing
the difference a person's actions
can make. Many of these actions
also tend to be economical, as they
are aimed at conserving re
sources.
The basic level is titled "Simple
Things." The majority of the 50
steps Eire included in this section.
It is composed of fairly easy proce
dures that take little extra effort.
There are ideas on how to reduce
the amount of junk mail you
receive, make the best use of your
tire and cut CFC use to help the
ozone layer.
The second level is "It takes an
effort". The steps described here
include recycling paper and glass,
planting a tree, recycling at the
office, helping to protect the rain
forest and insulating your home.
The highest of the levels is "For
the Committed." These routines
take up more time and require
greater discipline. The ideas here
include driving less and eating low

on the food chain.
Although most Stanford stu
dents have a high level of aware
ness about the problems facing
the environment, this is a valu
able source of ideas and actions
that can both help the environ
ment and prove cost-effective to
whoever implements it.
Crazy Wisdom
By Wes "Scoop"Nisker
Ten Speed, $12.95, 210 pages
Wes Nisker is a broadcast jour
nalist who has worked for Bay
Area radio stations, including
KSAN and KFOG. He is a practi
tioner of crazy wisdom, having
taught classes and workshops in
it.
"Crazy Wisdom" is the result of
the conglomeration of ideas and
philosophies that are as diverse as
the times and cultures that pro
duced them.
"Crazy Wisdom is the wisdom
of the saint, the Zen master, the
poet, the mad scientist and the
fool. Crazy wisdom sees that we
live in a world of many illusions,
that the emperor has no clothes
and that much of human belief is
ritualized nonsense."
There are hints of an approach
similar to that of "The Dancing
Wu-Li Masters" by Gary Zukav.
Nisker sees the direction of uncer
tainty science is headed towards
as an indication of the nature of
reality.
He looks at the many personal
ities that exemplify his wisdom —
Buddha, Woody Allen, Nietzsche,
Kerouac and Charlie Chaplin, to
name a few. And throughout the
book, he maintains his belief in
the insignificance of humans in an
infinite universe.
