Gary Snyder's new book, "The Practice
of the Wild," is a pleasant intellectual
amble through both the meaning of the
word "wild" and the author's own life expe
riences.
This collection of essays loosely connects
ideas of conservation, nature, Far Eastern
religion, political activism and Native
American history.
While all these topics are themselves
interesting, the problem with this book is
that the author is trying to explore too
many topics in too short a time. His
attempt might have been more successful
had he chosen a longer format in which to
express himself.
The essay form is simply too short to
support the wide range of categories which
he discusses. The author philosophizes
about ancient Greek history on one page
and then rather abruptly and unexpectedly
switches to anecdotes from his travels to
Anchorage, Alaska.
However, although the disorganization
of "The Practice of the Wild" makes the
book difficult to read, Gary Snyder's power
ful writing style forces the reader to stick it
out until the end. As a poet, Snyder has
proven himself to be a master of creative
images and he uses this talent to draw the
reader into his essays.
In fact, he is most successful when he
simply stops philosophizing and trying to
educate, and simply writes of his own expe
riences. His images, expressed in beautiful

sentence poetry save this book from utter
confusion.
One of the most successful essays, "The
Woman Who Married A Bear," is a simple
Native American folk story. However, this
instance is one of the few in which the
author stays relatively focused.
But all the essays, even those which
seem to have no binding organizational
glue, contain at least several wonderfully
expressive sentences or a short piece of
poetry which make the book worth reading.
This book is not for everyone. Political
conservatives and real estate developers
probably are not going to love the philoso
phies which Snyder advocates. His personal
ideology comes through in each essay and
the book becomes almost a New Age hand
book for living.
The author seems to be trying not only
to create an artistic and political message,
but also to provide a guideline for experi
encing all aspects of the "wild."
Snyder writes, "To be truly free one
must take on the basic conditions as they
are — painful, impermanent, open, imper
fect — and then be grateful for imperma
nence and the freedom it grants us. For in a
fixed universe there would be no freedom."
This sentence is meant for deep three
hour conversations over coffee and late
night philosophy arguments. These types of
thoughts which Snyder expresses so elo
quently and easily are the bread and butter
of the book.
However, regardless of the purpose of
the author in writing this collection of
essays, if you have the patience to struggle
through some disorganized ideas, "The
Practice of the Wild" can be worth the
effort.
