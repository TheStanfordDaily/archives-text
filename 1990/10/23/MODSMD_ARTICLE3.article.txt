# ASSU investment fund down $53,000
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU long-term investment
fund has lost $53,000 since July, due to
the national economic slowdown and a
mtyor adjustment in its stock portfolio.
About $26,000 of the portfolio was
lost because of fluctuations in the stock
market in the wake of the Persian Gulf
crisis and an international economic
slowdown.
The rest of the loss comes from a
decision spring quarter by ASSU Finan
cial Manager Torrence Boone and his
office to transfer the ASSU's $1.5 mil
lion endowment, which had been largely
invested in the Calvert Social Invest
ment Fund. They reinvested the endow
ment into what is now called the "Man
aged Investment Account."
Boone emphasized that the endow
ment was a long-term investment, and
that the $53,000 low* is temporary and
not unusual. "There are going to be
dips, but there will be steady growth."

Boone emphasized that
the endowment was a
long-term investment,
and that the $53,000 loss
is temporary and not
unusual.

ASSU, which represents approximately
$115 for every Stanford student,
"doesn't do anything," Boone said. "But
it allows [the ASSU] to do many things.
.. .It means financial flexibility in the
long run,"he added.
For example, he said, if the ASSU
decided on a "huge capital investment"
such as a new boathouse, they could use
those financial resources as collateral.
Or, if the ASSU had a shortfall in its
budget, it could take money from the
endowment.
Boone likened the ASSU endowment

to the University's $2.2 billion endow
ment. "The University doesn't spend its
endowment and we don't want to spend
ours either."
Currently, the interest from the
endowment is reinvested. The money
was accumulated over a number of
years from excessive cash from ASSU
business and interest from the funds of
student organizations that bank with
the ASSU. The ASSU, however, no
longer keeps the interest from student
organization funds.
At an ASSU Senate meeting last
week, Boone presented a report that
showed how approximately half of the
loss can be attributed to the switch in
portfolios and half can be attributed to
fluctuations in the economy.
The overall financial consultant for
the Managed Investment Account,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., invested
the ASSU's endowment into two compa
nies: A«hfiald & Company and Davis
Skaggs Investment Management. Each
was put in charge of managing
approximately $750,000 of the
ASSU's money
Boone called the new invest
ment structure "much more
aggressive" than the pre-July
structure. He called the Calvert
Fund "very safe, very stable, but
non-dynamic."
The Calvert Fund was
acclaimed by investors when it
was first formed, Boone said, but
"its performance has been wan
ing." He called it a "socially
responsible investment portfo
lio," which means that it screens
portfolios for controversial or
objectionable investments such as
those in South Africa, defense
contractors or environmentally
unsound projects.
Of the two new investment
companies, Boone called Ashfield
the "more aggressive," but Ash
field has done worse than Davis
Skaggs since the switch was
made.
He emphasized that the
$53,000 loss was not unusual in
this time of oil crisis and eco
nomic uncertainty.
"Everyone's going through
this," he said. "Some accounts are
just trashed."
