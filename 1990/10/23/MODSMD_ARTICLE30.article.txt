With the 100 th anniversary of
Yosemite National Park this month,
Alfred Runte's book, "Yosemite: The
Embattled Wilderness," calls atten
tion to an important question facing
all who have admired the impressive
beauty of the park — namely, "Where
to draw the line between preservation
and use".
Carefully tracing major policy
changes since the recognition of the
valley as a park in 1864, Runte
unhesitatingly documents how both
the Park Service and concessionaires
compromised the future of wildlife
and vegetation on the valley floor in
their quests to attract the maximum
number of visitors and increase their
own profits.
Accurately demonstrating how
"easily preferences among visitors
could evolve from luxuries into
needs," the author follows early devel
opments of golf courses, bear feeding
shows and the infamous Yosemite Zoo
of the late 1920s to modern day
"needs" for a 23-bed jail and a court
house which processes over 1,000
cases annually.
This past summer I was an
employee of the Yosemite Park and

Curry Company, the sole concession
aire of the park since 1925. Having
lived in the park for two months, its
overdevelopment and the disregard
for the ecological implications of over
four million visitors annually was
especially clear to me.
Visitors to the park were constantly
reminded of their proximity to various
bars, pizza places and ice cream
stands, while biological and historical
facts could only be learned by taking
the costly Valley Floor Tour.
Many tourists spent more time tak
ing pictures of the accommodations
they hoped to reserve for the coming
years than taking advantage of the
well-maintained trails or breathtaking
views.
As a seasonal employee, I was con
stantly reminded that the comfort of
the guest was my sole concern, even
when those guests were illegally feed
ing squirrels and deer and picking
native plants to take home as sou
venirs.
Runte carefully points out that
development and materialism are not
simply modern day additions to park
policy, but rather longstanding tradi
tions which are nearly impossible to
change. He also illustrates other diffi
culties facing preservationists.
As ecological awareness became a
topic for the park beginning in
the mid-19305, biologists like Berkeley
scientists Joseph Grinell and George
Wright tried in vain to change public
opinion toward a greater appreciation

of the park as an educational resource
and as a "vignette of primitive Amer
• _ w
ica.
Unfortunately, park managers and
concessionaires continue today to hold
a different view. Ironically, Stanford's
own Donald Tresidder, a former head
of the Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany, pushed aggressively for greater
development in the valley and even
recommended holding the Winter
Olympics of 1932 within the park.
Undoubtedly, the governing opin
ions of the park have swayed toward
profit instead of preservation from its
very inauguration.
Although Runte spends too little
time elaborating on the immediate
problems of management in the park,
he does speculate that change is not
easily forthcoming if the current con
cessionaire is able to renew its con
tract with the government in 1994.
His well-documented history of the
park's mismanagement, however, is a
disturbing and inspiring portrait of
what he calls "more than a natural
wonder ... an icon of American cul
ture."
For any who have visited Yosemite
or even seen the famous prints of its
scenery, this book sheds light on many
controversial aspects of its history and
provides an invitation to actively cam
paign for a better future.
