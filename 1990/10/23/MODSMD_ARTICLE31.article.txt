## Booters drop one, tie one on weekend tourney's turf 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
If a Stanford graduate invented
astroturf, he had better hide. The
Cardinal's men soccer squad is
ready to kill him after losing 3-1 to
Washington and tying a weak Ore
gon State team 1-1 at the Husky
Classic in Seattle.
The Cardinal, which plays all
its home games on natural turf,
had a hard time adjusting to the
artificial surface. "I think that we
wanted to play really well this
weekend, but we were too worried
about the turf," explained All-
American midfielder Rhett Harty.
"Everyone was nervous because
we've been playing on grass all
year and these were our first
games on the turf."
The weather conditions didn't
seem to help the Cardinal either.
The field was wet for the first
game, and it poured down rain for
Stanford's second contest.
"You couldn't control the ball,"
said forward Jim Talluto. "It was
out of bounds half the time. It was
real pathetic."
Talluto, however, was able to
control the ball long enough to
pick up a goal Saturday against
the Huskies. It came at the 12-
minute mark of the first period.
The Cardinal had a free kick 20
yards from the Husky net. Talluto
bent the shot around Washing
ton's defensive wall and into the
corner of the net to pick up his
team-leading tenth goal.
The celebration didn't last long
though. Washington quickly retal
iated with its own goal just min
utes later. At the 16-minute mark,
the Huskies hit a shot past Stan
ford keeper Kyle Krpata to tie the

score.
Stanford had chances to score
in the second period, but failed.
Fullback Brandon Parley placed
several throw-ins in front of the
Washington net, but no one could
capitalize. "We had some great
opportunities with Brandon, but
we couldn't get one in the net,"
said Talluto. "The throw-ins
would be right in front of the net,
and our players would fall down or
barely miss the ball."
The top-ranked Huskies didn't
make the same mistakes. They
capitalized on two situations and
came out of the second period
with two more goals and a victory.
Sunday's game against Oregon
State didn't prove to be any better
for the Cardinal. Stanford was
heavily favored in the match, but
it only came away with a tie. Not
only that, but Harty, the team's
captain, was ejected from the
game and has to sit out next week
end's match with Sacramento
State.
With the game only several
minutes old, Harty received a red
card for fighting. "I'm still very
confused about it,"the All-Ameri
can explained. "I was shielding
him and the ball. It went out of
bounds, and he threw me over his
back. So, I gave him a knee to the
stomach."
"In the rule book," said Harty,
"retaliation is an automatic red
card. Being the team captain, I
should have been under control
more. I feel like I let my team
down."
Whether or not he did, Harty
did leave the squad a man short.
And the Ducks capitalized on it in
the second period. With 20 min
utes to play, Oregon beat Krpata

and left Stanford in shock. "I
thought, 'I can't believe we are
losing to Oregon,'" said Talluto.
That thought filled Talluto's
head for the next 18 minutes until
the Cardinal got a corner kick.
Talluto hit the ball to the far post
where Farley headed it back over

the middle. Sweeper Randy Mann
crashed in and headed the ball
into the net to send the game into
overtime. The match ended in a
tie after neither team could score
in either of the two overtime peri
ods.
To make matters worse, the

Cardinal didn't even receive a con
solation prize for its efforts at the
tournament. "They call it the
Husky Classic, but they don't
even give you a free t-shirt. All
tournaments give out free shirts,"
balked Talluto.
Stanford, which moved to 7-5-

6, couldn't get on track in the
Pacific Northwest where they play
soccer a little differently — in the
rain, on astroturf, and without
free shirts.
Talluto explained, "Good teams
adjust, and we just didn't adjust
well enough."

head for the next 18 minutes until
the Cardinal got a corner kick.
Talluto hit the ball to the far post
where Farley headed it back over

the middle. Sweeper Randy Mann
crashed in and headed the ball
into the net to send the game into
overtime. The match ended in a
tie after neither team could score
in either of the two overtime peri
ods.
To make matters worse, the

Cardinal didn't even receive a con
solation prize for its efforts at the
tournament. "They call it the
Husky Classic, but they don't
even give you a free t-shirt. All
tournaments give out free shirts,"
balked Talluto.
Stanford, which moved to 7-5-

6, couldn't get on track in the
Pacific Northwest where they play
soccer a little differently — in the
rain, on astroturf, and without
free shirts.
Talluto explained, "Good teams
adjust, and we just didn't adjust
well enough."

Stanford's men's soccer team Is having some difficulty finding game-to-game consistency this season. Following success a week ago, this
weekend the Cardinal found Itself slipping on the artificial turf of the Husky Classic In Seattle.
If a Stanford graduate invented
astroturf, he had better hide. The
Cardinal's men soccer squad is
ready to kill him after losing 3-1 to
Washington and tying a weak Ore
gon State team 1-1 at the Husky
Classic in Seattle.
The Cardinal, which plays all
its home games on natural turf,
had a hard time adjusting to the
artificial surface. "I think that we
wanted to play really well this
weekend, but we were too worried
about the turf," explained All-
American midfielder Rhett Harty.
"Everyone was nervous because
we've been playing on grass all
year and these were our first
games on the turf."
The weather conditions didn't
seem to help the Cardinal either.
The field was wet for the first
game, and it poured down rain for
Stanford's second contest.
"You couldn't control the ball,"
said forward Jim Talluto. "It was
out of bounds half the time. It was
real pathetic."
Talluto, however, was able to
control the ball long enough to
pick up a goal Saturday against
the Huskies. It came at the 12-
minute mark of the first period.
The Cardinal had a free kick 20
yards from the Husky net. Talluto
bent the shot around Washing
ton's defensive wall and into the
corner of the net to pick up his
team-leading tenth goal.
The celebration didn't last long
though. Washington quickly retal
iated with its own goal just min
utes later. At the 16-minute mark,
the Huskies hit a shot past Stan
ford keeper Kyle Krpata to tie the

score.
Stanford had chances to score
in the second period, but failed.
Fullback Brandon Parley placed
several throw-ins in front of the
Washington net, but no one could
capitalize. "We had some great
opportunities with Brandon, but
we couldn't get one in the net,"
said Talluto. "The throw-ins
would be right in front of the net,
and our players would fall down or
barely miss the ball."
The top-ranked Huskies didn't
make the same mistakes. They
capitalized on two situations and
came out of the second period
with two more goals and a victory.
Sunday's game against Oregon
State didn't prove to be any better
for the Cardinal. Stanford was
heavily favored in the match, but
it only came away with a tie. Not
only that, but Harty, the team's
captain, was ejected from the
game and has to sit out next week
end's match with Sacramento
State.
With the game only several
minutes old, Harty received a red
card for fighting. "I'm still very
confused about it,"the All-Ameri
can explained. "I was shielding
him and the ball. It went out of
bounds, and he threw me over his
back. So, I gave him a knee to the
stomach."
"In the rule book," said Harty,
"retaliation is an automatic red
card. Being the team captain, I
should have been under control
more. I feel like I let my team
down."
Whether or not he did, Harty
did leave the squad a man short.
And the Ducks capitalized on it in
the second period. With 20 min
utes to play, Oregon beat Krpata

and left Stanford in shock. "I
thought, 'I can't believe we are
losing to Oregon,'" said Talluto.
That thought filled Talluto's
head for the next 18 minutes until
the Cardinal got a corner kick.
Talluto hit the ball to the far post
where Farley headed it back over

the middle. Sweeper Randy Mann
crashed in and headed the ball
into the net to send the game into
overtime. The match ended in a
tie after neither team could score
in either of the two overtime peri
ods.
To make matters worse, the

Cardinal didn't even receive a con
solation prize for its efforts at the
tournament. "They call it the
Husky Classic, but they don't
even give you a free t-shirt. All
