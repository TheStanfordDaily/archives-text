# Cardinal luck falls by the wayside down Interstate 5
## 
### 
In case you hadn't noticed,
there seems to be something
missing from the 1990 Stan
ford football season.
It's got nothing to do with
what's happening on the field,
because (unfortunately) the story
there is pretty much normal: A
couple close losses, one heart
stopping win (remember Oregon
last year), a Stanford blowout,
Stanford getting mauled, and so
on.
No, the team seems to be play
ing exactly the way it has for the
last three seasons. When it shows
up for a game, the Cardinal is a
great team.
Now all it has to do is work on
showing up.
The missing element, however,
won't be showing up anytime
soon, and we can thank the Nobel
Laureates who came up with this
year's Pacific 10 Conference foot
ball schedule for that.
I'm talking, of course, about
the annual Los Angeles road trip.
You remember the road trip,
don't you? Back when the football
season actually started after
school began, every time Stanford
played at one of the LA. schools
several thousand students would
pile into cars, motor homes,
dogsleds and whatever else to get
down there for the weekend. A
quick jaunt down Interstate 5 (the
world's most 112f —ing boring road!)
and the party began.

That was in the old days, back
when the schedule-makers had a
brain. This year the conference
outdid itself, scheduling the Stan
ford-UCLA game two weeks
before classes started at either
school. Way to go, guys! At least
we finally know that college foot
ball isn't being played for the stu
dents.
There's not much anyone can
do about it, either, because the
Pac-10 schedule is already set
through 2004. (No, I don't know
why. I don't think anyone does.)
So, whenever a decent game is
scheduled long before classes start
— like the USC game at home two
years ago — students who live
beyond a certain radius (say, 1000
miles) will just have to watch on
the tube.
Since the schedule ain't too
likely to change anytime soon,
then, I've come up with just about
the only solution, the only way to
guarantee that future generations
of students won't be denied their
fundamental right of wasting
three days in the smog just before

that huge midterm:
It's time to can the quarter sys
tem.
C'mon, it makes perfect sense!
The collegiate world revolves
around athletics anyway, so it's
time Stanford stopped pretending
to be academically-oriented. With
a semester system, students
would be able to watch more ath
letic events (Hey! More money for
the Athletic Department!) and
they'd never miss a road trip.
What better reason could there be
for completely restructuring our
academic calendar?
Well, all right, maybe it's not
gonna happen. And maybe that's
not such a disaster, because
there'B just one minor drawback
to the whole concept of the L.A.
road trip.
The Cardinal tends to lose a lot.
I'm not just talking about the
football team, either. It seems
every time my friends and I
head down 1-5 to the home of the
depraved, something lousy hap
pens. And that, of course, leads
me to the only possible conclu
sion:
It's my fault.
No, really. I thought it was just
bad luck for awhile, but I've seen
too many freaky events in L.A. not
to think that it might be because I
keep going down to watch.
Oh, you think I'm just being
negative, huh? Check this out:
Road Trip No. 1: November

-1987. The football team goes
down to face USC, forgets how to
play pass defense (some things
don't change) and loses 39-24.
Rodney Peete completes 17 of 20
for 273 yards and a school-record
five TDs.
Road Trip No. 2: November
1988. Playing sixth-ranked UCLA
in the Rose Bowl, the Cardinal

I thought it was just bad luck for awhile,
but I've seen too many freaky events in
L.A. not to think that it might be
because I keep going down to watch.

leads 17-13 late in the game. Fac
ing third-and-nine on his own 25,
Stanford's Brian Johnson drops
back to pass, raises his arm to
throw .. . and UCLA defensive
tackle Mike Lodish tips the ball,
catches it and runs 17 yards for
the decisive touchdown. Bruins
27-17.
Road Trip No. 3: April 1989.
The men's tennis team plays No. 1
UCLA and USC. The Cardinal
loses 5-1 to UCLA, but the Bruins
need help: One Stanford player,
up a break in the third set, blows a
4-3 lead and loses; and another,
receiving serve at three points
each, 4-5 in the third, calls a let on

a serve, is overruled by the umpire
(who was clearly on drugs) and
loses.
The next day at USC, the teams
split the six singles matches, the
Cardinal takes one-set leads in all
three doubles matches ... and
loses, 5-4. Two doubles teams lose
6-1 in the final set.
Is anyone else noticing a pat-

tern here?
Road Trip No. 4: February
1990. The baseball team takes two
of three(!) from UCLA, but lousy
weather delays Friday's game
until Sunday night and forces the
team to play a doubleheader Mon
day. Leaving right after splitting
the doubleheader, the team drives
home, has to face St. Mary's 12
hours after getting back to Stan
ford, and loses. The Cardinal lost
exactly one other game to an
unranked team last season.
Road Trip No. 5: Three days
later. Baseball at USC. To spice up
the trip, I send 25 postcards to a
friend back at Stanford. It doesn't
help: The Trojans take two out of
three, winning the final game 3-1
by picking off a runner with the
fake-to-third pickoff move that
never — well, almost never —
works.
Road Trip No. 6: Last month.
Football against UCLA. The foot
ball team's first road win since
1987 is in the bag, we figure. The
Cardinal goes up 21-7. Hey, mail it
in, we think. No problem.
Stanford decides to mail it in,
shifting to a prevent-yourself
from-winning defense, surrender
ing 150 passing yards over the
space of two minutes and losing
32-31 on the last play of the game.
But at least the margin of victory
came on a botched extra-point
attempt that went something like
this:
The Bruins score to make it 28-
27 Stanford, and the teams line up
for the extra point.
Stanford blocks the kick.
The UCLA holder picks up the
ball and lets it fly just as he's
crushed by three Cardinal defend
ers.
A UCLA receiver, after blowing
his blocking assignment, races to
the back of the end zone, stands
all alone, and catches the ball. 29-
28 UCLA.
That was enough excitement
for the day but, just to make sure
we all knew what was supposed to
happen in L.A., the Bruins got the
ball back with 1:14 left, down 31-
29, and cruised down to our two
yard line in exactly 69 seconds.
Chip shot.

Six road trips. Five thousand
miles of driving.
A 3-8 record.
I'd had enough. I needed a road
trip to go well. Checking the calen
dar, I saw my next (and probably
only) chance would come in Jan
uary, when the men's basketball
team traveled to face the Bruins
and Trojans. Problem No. 1: The
Cardinal is 1-523 (or something
like that) in Pauley Pavilion.
Problem No. 2: USC is improving,
and beat us down there last sea
son.
It didn't look very promising.
Getting desperate, I looked at
other Stanford teams' schedules,
and could find only one opportu
nity.
Women's volleyball. At No. 1
UCLA.
Hey, no problem!
And so we took off. Okay,
maybe this was stretching it
just a little, but I had a feel
ing. The team was on a roll. They
crushed Nebraska. They were
due. And UCLA, with a 45-match
conference winning streak, was
ripe.
After the usual hellish journey
(if your car doesn't have a tape
player, you're gonna be stuck with
a lot of country music on 1-5) we
arrived at the Wooden Center. The
teams were warming up, and I
took a seat with the other 20 or so
Stanford fans. (I'm pretty sure
they were all relatives of the play
ers, 'cuz no one else would have
been stupid enough to drive the
whole way down.)
Two hours later we were going
crazy. Stanford up two games to
one, 12-4 in the fourth. This was
it, I thought. After six horrid
trips, I was finally going to leave
L.A. in a good mood.
Not.
All of a sudden — you'd think
I'd be used to this by now — the
score was 13-12, UCLA. No, I'm
not sure how. The Cardinal scored
twice to get to match point —
maybe, just maybe ... — and then
UCLA's Natalie Williams
smashed the ball deep to the far
end of the court.
I saw it hit out. The players
saw it hit out. The UCLA fans I
overheard after the match saw it
hit out.
The linesman called it in. As if
there were any question.
Three points later it was two
games each. And an hour after
that, well, I'll just let you guess.
Seven road trips. Five thou
sand eight hundred and fifty
miles.
As we left the gym — still not
believing what happened — my
friend and I had one consoling
thought:
At least we'd be able to listen to
the Stanford-Washington football
game during the drive home.

Cameron Macky will be roadtrip
ping to L.A. yet again in January
to cover the men'« basketball team.
The Daily would like to apologize
in advance.
