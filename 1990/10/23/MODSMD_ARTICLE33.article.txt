# Athletes of the Week

### 
The weather of Palo Alto has been described
as a number of thingß. Some call it a drought
Some say it has gone beyond "drought" and
has simply become the new normal. Some just
say it's better than Harvard's.
Be that as it may, the Daily's two Athletes
of the Week accomplished their impressive
feats in the wet: Colin Keely of the Stanford
water polo team; and Audrey Wooding of the
Cardinal women's golf team.

In a critical Pacific-10 Conference
matchup against the No. 2 UCLA Bruins,
Keely, a 6-foot-1, 180-pound senior fielder
from Orinda, Calif., scored five goals to lead
the No. 3 Cardinal to a hard-earned 10-9 vic
tory.
The contest went into five overtimes,
including three sudden death overtimes,
before Keely pounded in the game winner.
The win not only gives Stanford a boost in
the rankings, but also keeps the Cardinal
within sight of the Pac-10 Championship.
The main three teams vying for that title
include Stanford, UCLA, and California.
In the final seconds of the Bruin game,
Keely, despite having played the entire game,
sprinted ahead of the weary UCLA defenders
and tried to get his teammates' attention. He
finally did, and goalie Larry Bercutt passed it
to him. Keely ended the game with his shot.
"There was no way I was going to swim
back down the pool again, so I figured I bet
ter score," he said.

Wooding, a junior, defied inclement
weather to take home the tournament indi
vidual title and lead the No. 3 Cardinal to vic
tory at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational in
Seattle, Wash., not too far from her home in
Tacoma.
The Washington native played consistent
ly well through all three rainy days of the
tournament. She shot rounds of 73, 76 and

77 for the winning total of 226.
Before the fincu day she said, "I just need
to keep my head on straight and play smart."
Her plan payed off.
Stanford edged Oklahoma 928-932 to win
the tournament against a competitive field
which included preseason No. 4 USC.
Including Wooding, three of the Cardinal
placed in the top four.
