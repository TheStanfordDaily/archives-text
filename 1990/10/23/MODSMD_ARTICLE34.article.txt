Beck's best non-alcoholic beer
Haake Beck, from the makers of Beck's Beer,
won the contest for the best non-alcoholic beer in
White Plaza last week as part of the National Col
legiate Alcohol Awareness Week.
Tasters rated the beers on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5
(excellent). The beers were scored on taste, consis
tency, effervescence and color.
Haake Beck received the highest overall rating.
Beck's also won the consistency and taste cate
gories.
Second to the Haake Beck was Wartech, while
O'Doul's, by Anheuser-Busch, swept the color cat
egory. Other beers tasted were Moussy, Kaliber,
Clausthaler, Sharp's and Hamm's NA.
While regular beers are 4 percent alcohol, these
beers contain .5 percent alcohol, which is less than
orange juice.
Profs, named to endowed chairs
Seven Stanford professors were appointed to
endowed chairs recently. Endowed chairs are pro
fessorial positions funded by donations to the Uni
versity.
• Applied Physics Prof. Malcom Beasley has
been appointed the Theodore and Sydney Rosen
berg Professor of Applied Physics. Beasley, a Stan
ford faculty member since 1974, served as chair of

the Applied Physics Department from 1984 to
1989.
Beasley was awarded the Dean's Award for Dis
tinguished Teaching in the School of Humanities
and Sciences in 1983. His course on "Principles of
Applied Superconductivity" was one of the earliest
such courses taught anywhere regularly.
• Steven Chu, chair of the Physics Department,
has been named the first Theodore and Frances
Gaballe Professor of Humanities and Sciences.
Appointment to this chair is enhanced by an
endowed fund to support the research and scholar
ship of the chair holder.
Chu's research has included measurement of
the small parity-violation effect in the spectrum of
thallium.
Chu recently succeeded in using radiation pres
sure of a laser to cool sodium atoms to tempera
tures less than a thousandth of a degree Kelvin. He
has also done considerable work on spectroscopy.
Chu was awarded the Borida Prize of the American
Physical Society for 1987.
• Stephen Kline has been named the Clarence
and Patricia Woodward Professor of Mechanical
Engineering. Kline has been a member of Stan
ford's mechanical engineering faculty since 1952
and served as director of the Thermosciences Divi
sion from its founding in 1961 until 1973.
Kline is a founding member of Stanford's Val

ues, Technology, Science and Society Program,
where he teaches "The Nature of Technology in
Modern Society."
He has been awarded the Melville Medal by the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers for a
paper on the nature of flow separation, the Fluids
Engineering Award by ASME, the ASME Centen
nial Award and the George Stephenson Medal by
the British Institute of Mechanical Engineers for a
paper on turbulence production in boundary lay
ers.
• Albert Macovski, professor of electrical engi
neering and diagnostic radiology, has been named
the Canon USA Professor of Engineering. Since
1985, Macovski has directed the Magnetic Reso
nance Systems research laboratory.
Macovski has about 150 U.S. patents and
another 150 publications in the field of optics, elec
tronics, television, imaging, radiology, ultrasonics
and magnetic resonance.
• Marjorie Perloff, professor of English and an
authority on modernism, contemporary poetry and
comparative literature, has been appointed the
Sadie Dernham Patek Professor of Humanities.
Perloff is the author of a three-volume analysis
of modernism, a work considered to be of great sig
nificance in modernist studies. PerlofT, who joined
the Stanford faculty in 1986, is also a professor, by
courtesy, of comparative literature.

• Chemistry Prof. Barry 'Frost, an internation
ally recognized chemist, is the first recipient of the
Job and Gertrud Tamaki Professorship in Human
ities and Sciences.
Trost, who joined the Stanford faculty in 1987,
is the recipient of three awards in chemistry,
has been elected to the National Academy of Sci
ences and is a fellow of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences.
• John Wirth, professor of history and vice
provost for academic planning and development,
has been named the Gildred Professor of Latin
American Studies, effective Feb. 1, 1991.
Prof, gets $1 million in awards
Stuart Wesley Young, an associate professor of
radiology, has received $1,064,000 in three awards
for contrast media research.
"Alcohol Toxicity Measured by MRI Contrast
Agents" is a three-year award with a total budget
over $700,000.
Cook Imaging Corporation gave Young a con
tract award of $290,000 to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of non-ionic radiographic contrast media,
while a clinical trial involving 24 patients spon
sored by Sterling Research Group of Eastman
Kodak awarded Young $74,000.
