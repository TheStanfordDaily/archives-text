# AIDS threatens women, children
## U.N. expert delivers speech on overlooked victims 
### Mary Rajkumar 
"Like in chemistry, AIDS is a piece of litmus
paper — it reveals a lot about the social hypocrisies
that exist," according to United Nations AIDS
expert Jacques Du Guerny.
In a speech on "Women and AIDS" yesterday, Du
Guerny, the deputy chief for the formulation of
AIDS policy at the U.N.'s Vienna office, talked about
the increasing threat AIDS poses to women and chil
dren in developing countries.
Women are often overlooked as victims of AIDS, a
disease more often associated with male homosexu
als and drug takers, Du Guerny said.
The World Health Organization, the U.N. medi
cal branch, projects that 4 million women will die of
AIDS in 1992, compared to 2.5 million last year. The
organization also predicts that by the year 2000,
AIDS could be the biggest killer of children.
"Heterosexuality will then be the predominant
mode of transmission in most countries," added Du
Guerny.
"Our basic premise is that inequality between
men and women implies a different risk of infection
with different consequences," he said.
One example of such inequality, Du Guerny said,
is poor women's health care in many developing
countries. Low health standards often result in a
need for blood transfusion at birth, raising the risk
of contracting AIDS.
In some cases, social attitudes leave women
unable to protect themselves. Prostitution is on the
rise in many developing countries, Du Guerny said,
spreading infection to both customers and their
wives.
"But even if [women] know their husbands are
infected, they just have to take the risk," he
explained.
Infected women, however, are often expelled from
their families. They might be forced to turn to pros
titution for support, creating a vicious cycle of/JDS.
Female circumcision in developing countries is
another practice linked to AIDS, Du Guerny contin
ued. Circumcision often damages tissues, which

"dramatically increases the risk of infection," he
said. It can also make vaginal sex so painful that
women resort to anal sex, which makes them more
likely to contract AIDS.
And poor health practices mean that the same
instruments are used to circumcise an entire group
of girls, rapidly spreading the infection.
But attempts to abolish this practice, said Du
Guerny, were viewed as an imposition of "Western
morals and values."
The increase of AIDS in women is quietly but
severely affecting society in developing nations. Five
percent of children now face orphanhood before they
turn five.
And, according to Du Guerny, the extended family
system is collapsing. The common practice of inter
marriage between family members has spread AIDS
through entire families.
Women also pass on the disease to children they
bear. An infected mother has a 25 to 50 percent
chance of giving birth to a child with AIDS, Du
Guerny said. And even if children escape direct
infection, they are sickly and unable to resist dis
ease.
The U.N. is introducing diverse measures to
improve the situation, Du Guerny said. The health
organization has a "Global Program on AIDS,"
designed to train medical staff and increase govern
ment awareness.
The U.N. is also experimenting with new methods
of teaching a largely illiterate population about safer
sex. For example, popular folk singers in Zaire now
compose songs about the risk of AIDS, and native
puppet theater in Indonesia acts out family plan
ning.
But these programs have a limited impact in prac
tice, Du Guerny said. "No matter what people know,
condoms are difficult to get, and too expensive."
And leaders of some African countries them
selves oppose measures against AIDS because of a
perceived stigma about the origin of AIDS.
Said Du Guerny, "It is an epidemic which requires
a lot of resources for prevention — at a time when
nothing much is visible."
