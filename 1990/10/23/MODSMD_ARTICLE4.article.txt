# Sigma Chi on probation through winter
## 
### Allison Shue Staff writer 
The Sigma Chi fraternity will remain on proba
tion until the end of winter quarter in compliance
with a ruling yesterday by the Interfraternity
Council Judicial Board.
The board's decision, approved by the IFC
Executive Committee, follows an investigation of
three alcohol-related incidents two weeks ago involv
ing several fraternity pledges and active members.
During its probation, the fraternity must submit
written steps "to ensure responsible alcohol manage
ment and the curtailment of 'high risk' situations"
to the IFC Executive Committee prior to holding
functions involving alcohol,
according to the board's report.
The board, consisting of repre
sentatives from several fraterni
ties who investigate disciplinary
matters and make recommenda
tions, also ordered the Sigma Chis
to apologize to those involved in
the incidents.
In addition, the fraternity
must sponsor a campus-wide
"Safe Alcohol Management Pro
gram" at the end of winter quar
ter. The program would empha
size controlling the risks involved
with serving and drinking alco
hol.
"I think it's a really fair pun
ishment for what happened," said
Sigma Chi president Wes Ehlers,
a senior. "We can turn it into

The fraternity was
found collectively
responsible of not
taking preventive
measures

something positive, both for our
house and for the IFC," he added.
Two of the incidents involved
members allegedly disturbing
some residents of Florence Moore
and Branner Halls late at night
on Oct. 9.
Another allegation charged
two pledges with causing a dis
ruption while waiting overnight
in line near Flo Mo residents at
the Oct. 12 USC-Stanford football
game.
The IFC Judicial Board found
alcohol to be a factor in all of the
events.

According to Chair Keith
Rabois, a senior, the University is
working with the IFC this year to
implement a new policy that
would leave disciplinary matters
such as the recent incidents
under the jurisdiction of the
board.
"I hope that they'll be willing
to trust our judgment based on
serious research," Rabois said.
He added that allegations con
cerning violations of the Funda
mental Standard would still be
handled by the University.
The report maintained that
none of the alleged incidents were
house approved activities and
that only a few of the members
were involved.
The decision of the board,
according to the report, was based
on the idea that "the fraternity as
a collectively responsible institu
tion is responsible for not taking
preventive action" in the event of
an alcohol-related situation.
