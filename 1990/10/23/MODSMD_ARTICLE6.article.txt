# Stanford-in-Beijing?
## Several seek new Overseas program 
### Mike Laris 
As Stanford begins to focus
on the culture and economics
of the Pacific Rim, University
administrators are trying to
plan an Overseas Studies pro
gram in Beying, the capital of
Stanford's largest neighbor.
Recent faculty initiatives,
student interest and support
among top University officials
have given momentum to the
idea of undergraduate study in
the People's Republic of China.
"[We] are definitely going to
move in that direction," said
John Cash, associate dean for
development. "I don't think
there is any question of this.
There's just too much interest
on the part of the students to
be there," he said.
"Between [Overseas Studies
Director] Tom Heller and
[Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences] Ewart Thomas . . .
you've got some very thought
ful people involved in this, peo
ple who really want to move
ahead, and [who] don't want to
deprive our students of the
experience," Cash said.
Cash emphasized that his
discussion of possible programs
was not intended to preempt
normal faculty decision making
processes. "The faculty,
through its decision making
bodies, are going to decide if
the University has a campus in
Beying," he said.

According to Cash, there
are two visions of a Beijing pro
gram circulating. One is an
outline, including a budget,
written by John Wang, profes
sor of Asian languages.
Wang advocates a pilot pro
gram of eight to 12 students
that could begin as early as
autumn 1991. Support for
Wang's program would come
from gifts and a portion of the
Overseas budget that is not
being affected by recent budget
cutbacks.
Students would be affiliated
with Beying University, the
most prestigious university in
China.
The curriculum would
include both language training
and seminars taught by a Stan
ford faculty member and schol
ars from Beijing University.
The other current version of
a China program would create
an independent Stanford entity
in Beijing that "would be inde
pendent from any specific uni
versity in Beijing," according to
Cash.
A pilot program with Beying
University, which has already
been confirmed by Chinese
authorities, could be arranged
more quickly.
But Cash said the creation
of an independent entity, which
he said administrators prefer,
could also be timely.
"I don't think Tom Heller fore
sees this plan, this three track,
multi-layered plan as something
that would take years and years
to put together. That's not the
way he runs things. He just plows
on ahead."
According to Chinese graduate
student Yu Bin, Stanford should
move ahead on a program quickly.
"China is on the verge of mfyor
changes," he said. It may con
tinue its reform policy, or may
undergo a revision of its
reform policy, he said. "The
important thing is to learn these
things first hand. I don't think
Stanford would want to miss
that."
But Political Science Prof.
Nina Halpern, who is an expert
on China, warns that initiating a
program in such a volatile period
in Chinese history could put
Stanford students, as well as Chi
nese scholars in danger.
"I don't think that we set up
overseas programs in order to
allow students to be in politically
exciting places," she said. "More
over, when succession happens, it
might be very violent, and we
might certainly not wish our stu
dents to be there."
Halpern also said she is con
cerned the academic quality of a
program in Beying might not be
sufficient because of the lack of
academic freedom given Chinese

scholars by the government.
Thomas, Halpern and Deputy
Director of Overseas Studies Corb
Smith share the concern that the
University would be perceived as
legitimizing the repressive Chi
nese government that crushed
democratic movements at Tien
anmen Square in June of 1989.
"What signal does it convey, or
does it not convey, to the govern
ment of China?" asked Smith.
But Sophia Shing, a junior
who has been working with Wang
and Heller to develop a Stanford
program, argues the University
can avoid this pitfall.
"When the Chinese govern
ment tries to use Stanford as an
image builder, there is a limit
because Stanford will obviously
try to block their attempts," she
said. "There is no limit to the
amount of interaction that the
Chinese and American students
will have," she said, adding that
the possible benefits for both
sides are worth the risk.
Debate will increase regarding
the role of language study in the
possible program.
Wang's outline would require
one to two years of Chinese lan
guage preparation.
But History Prof. Harold Kahn
argues that three years of college
language preparation is necessary
to learn the most from intellec
tual life in China's capital.
"Without that," he added, "it
would be little more than a sec
ond-rate sort of operation, unless
the people who are lecturing in
English can give people what they
can't get here.

Beying," he said.

According to Cash, there
are two visions of a Beijing pro
gram circulating. One is an
outline, including a budget,
written by John Wang, profes
sor of Asian languages.
Wang advocates a pilot pro
gram of eight to 12 students
that could begin as early as
autumn 1991. Support for
Wang's program would come
from gifts and a portion of the
Overseas budget that is not
being affected by recent budget
cutbacks.
Students would be affiliated
with Beying University, the
most prestigious university in
China.
The curriculum would
include both language training
and seminars taught by a Stan
ford faculty member and schol
ars from Beijing University.
The other current version of
a China program would create
an independent Stanford entity
in Beijing that "would be inde
pendent from any specific uni
versity in Beijing," according to
Cash.
A pilot program with Beying
University, which has already
been confirmed by Chinese
authorities, could be arranged
more quickly.
But Cash said the creation
of an independent entity, which
he said administrators prefer,
could also be timely.
"I don't think Tom Heller fore
sees this plan, this three track,
multi-layered plan as something
that would take years and years
to put together. That's not the
way he runs things. He just plows
on ahead."
According to Chinese graduate
student Yu Bin, Stanford should
move ahead on a program quickly.
"China is on the verge of mfyor
changes," he said. It may con
tinue its reform policy, or may
undergo a revision of its
reform policy, he said. "The
important thing is to learn these
things first hand. I don't think
Stanford would want to miss
that."
But Political Science Prof.
Nina Halpern, who is an expert
on China, warns that initiating a
program in such a volatile period
in Chinese history could put
Stanford students, as well as Chi
nese scholars in danger.
"I don't think that we set up
overseas programs in order to
allow students to be in politically
exciting places," she said. "More
over, when succession happens, it
might be very violent, and we
might certainly not wish our stu
dents to be there."
Halpern also said she is con
cerned the academic quality of a
program in Beying might not be
sufficient because of the lack of
academic freedom given Chinese

scholars by the government.
Thomas, Halpern and Deputy
Director of Overseas Studies Corb
Smith share the concern that the
University would be perceived as
legitimizing the repressive Chi
nese government that crushed
democratic movements at Tien
anmen Square in June of 1989.
"What signal does it convey, or
does it not convey, to the govern
ment of China?" asked Smith.
But Sophia Shing, a junior
who has been working with Wang
and Heller to develop a Stanford
program, argues the University
can avoid this pitfall.
"When the Chinese govern
ment tries to use Stanford as an
image builder, there is a limit
because Stanford will obviously
try to block their attempts," she
said. "There is no limit to the
amount of interaction that the
Chinese and American students
will have," she said, adding that
the possible benefits for both
sides are worth the risk.
Debate will increase regarding
the role of language study in the
possible program.
Wang's outline would require
one to two years of Chinese lan
guage preparation.
But History Prof. Harold Kahn
argues that three years of college
language preparation is necessary
to learn the most from intellec
tual life in China's capital.
"Without that," he added, "it
would be little more than a sec
ond-rate sort of operation, unless
the people who are lecturing in
English can give people what they
can't get here.
As Stanford begins to focus
on the culture and economics
of the Pacific Rim, University
administrators are trying to
plan an Overseas Studies pro
gram in Beying, the capital of
Stanford's largest neighbor.
Recent faculty initiatives,
student interest and support
among top University officials
have given momentum to the
idea of undergraduate study in
the People's Republic of China.
"[We] are definitely going to
move in that direction," said
John Cash, associate dean for
development. "I don't think
there is any question of this.
There's just too much interest
on the part of the students to
be there," he said.
"Between [Overseas Studies
Director] Tom Heller and
[Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences] Ewart Thomas . . .
you've got some very thought
ful people involved in this, peo
ple who really want to move
ahead, and [who] don't want to
deprive our students of the
experience," Cash said.
Cash emphasized that his
discussion of possible programs
was not intended to preempt
normal faculty decision making
processes. "The faculty,
through its decision making
bodies, are going to decide if
the University has a campus in
Beying," he said.
