# Stanford-in-Beijing?
## Several seek new Overseas program 
### Mike Laris 
As Stanford begins to focus
on the culture and economics
of the Pacific Rim, University
administrators are trying to
plan an Overseas Studies pro
gram in Beying, the capital of
Stanford's largest neighbor.
Recent faculty initiatives,
student interest and support
among top University officials
have given momentum to the
idea of undergraduate study in
the People's Republic of China.
"[We] are definitely going to
move in that direction," said
John Cash, associate dean for
development. "I don't think
there is any question of this.
There's just too much interest
on the part of the students to
be there," he said.
"Between [Overseas Studies
Director] Tom Heller and
[Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences] Ewart Thomas . . .
you've got some very thought
ful people involved in this, peo
ple who really want to move
ahead, and [who] don't want to
deprive our students of the
experience," Cash said.
Cash emphasized that his
discussion of possible programs
was not intended to preempt
normal faculty decision making
processes. "The faculty,
through its decision making
bodies, are going to decide if
the University has a campus in
Beying," he said.

According to Cash, there
are two visions of a Beijing pro
gram circulating. One is an
outline, including a budget,
written by John Wang, profes
sor of Asian languages.
Wang advocates a pilot pro
gram of eight to 12 students
that could begin as early as
autumn 1991. Support for
Wang's program would come
from gifts and a portion of the
Overseas budget that is not
being affected by recent budget
cutbacks.
Students would be affiliated
with Beying University, the
most prestigious university in
China.
The curriculum would
include both language training
and seminars taught by a Stan
ford faculty member and schol
ars from Beijing University.
The other current version of
a China program would create
an independent Stanford entity
in Beijing that "would be inde
pendent from any specific uni
versity in Beijing," according to
Cash.
A pilot program with Beying
University, which has already
been confirmed by Chinese
authorities, could be arranged
more quickly.
But Cash said the creation
of an independent entity, which
he said administrators prefer,
could also be timely.
