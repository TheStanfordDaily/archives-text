# Bill pending in Congress would make universities publish crime rates
## 
### Nicholas Hass 
A bill currently under consideration by
Congress would require universities and
colleges to publish campus crime rates
and graduation rates for athletes.
According to the bill, which many
expect Congress to pass before adjourn
ing, crime statistics would have to be
available upon request to students, appli
cants, their parents, faculty and staff
members.
In addition, colleges would have to give
information to any potential athlete on
the graduation rates of players on schol
arship.
Crime statistics would tabulate crimes
such as murder, rape, aggravated assault,
robbery, car theft and burglaiy. Arrests

for illegal possession of weapons and alco
hol and drug law violations would be
included.
Yearly reports would also contain
information on campus crime prevention
policies.
The Stanford Police Special Services
Unit already publishes a yearly almanac
compiling crime statistics for Stanford.
However, last year's almanac has not yet
been published because of a lack of funds.
"I think we should be open and honest
about [crime rates]," said Freshman
Admissions Director John Bunnell. How
ever, he added, "I can't see any college...
wanting to talk about crime on their cam
pus."
Bunnell said the Admissions Office has
given little thought to the new legislation

because few people have requested Stan
ford crime statistics.
He said there was no need to publish
such reports in admissions information
since it is already available on request.
"Why flog ourselves?" he asked.
The bill represents a compromise
between many schools that are not anx
ious to publicize their crime figures and
advocates of increased campus security
who want to see universities open up
their police logs.
If approved, the new law would require
colleges and universities to start compil
ing crime statistics by Sept. 1, 1991. The
first report would be due Sept. 2, 1992.
The athletics report would include a
breakdown of graduation rates of stu
dents in different sports.

The basketball and football sections of
the report would have to include break
down by race, and other sports would also
be required to show a breakdown by gen
der.
Stanford currently completes an
NCAA Academic Standing Report, said
Barbara Sue Lemmon, assistant to the
athletic director. By completing the
NCAA report, the Athletic Department
already fulfills many of the requirements
specified in the federal legislation.
"This is something we've already had
available to everyone," Lemmon added.
Colleges and universities would be
required to report statistics for crimes in
any part of their campuses. They would
also have to include crimes in areas off
campus used for educational purposes

and in buildings owned by college-recog
nized student groups.
Proponents of the legislation stress the
importance of students' understanding
the issues of campus safety. Advocates of
increased campus security also believe
the compilation of crime statistics will
reduce campus crime by making universi
ties more fully responsible for safety.
Kathleen Curry Santora of the
National Association of Independent Col
leges and Universities said the law will
"make colleges more aware of public con
cern about public safety."
But she added the reports are "not the
most effective way to reduce crime on
campus." The reports would not neces
sarily show an "accurate picture" of the
safety level on a particular campus.
