A LITTLE LIGHT READING IN THE MORNING
... takes a lot of work the day before. Dozens of people are
involved in putting out each and every issue of The Daily.
If you'd like to be one of those people, come by our office in the Storke
Publications Building (across from Terman Pond). We'll get you started
as a writer, photographer, graphic artist or page designer.
Or, for more information, call 723-4632.
