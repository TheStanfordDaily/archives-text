We're looking for people who
look at this glass and say:
"There's gotta be other
glasses of water."
&
We need people capable of going
beyond half-full or half-empty
thinking. People who see subtleties.
Who are quite frankly bored by easy
answers and off the-shelf solutions.
People who are constantly
challenging their own thinking and
are thirsty for new ideas and
knowledge.
You'll have a degree from a top
school. Getting a job won't really be
an issue. The question is: which job?
Which industry?
You don't want to get locked
into one area and then discover
three to five years from now that you
don't like it. By then you've invested
too much.
