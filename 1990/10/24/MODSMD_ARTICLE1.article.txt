# Stanford's new alcohol policy:
## Students express concern over law 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
After several weeks of uncer
tainty about the meaning of Stan
ford's new alcohol policy, students
had their first opportunity yester
day to express their concerns and
suggestions to University offi-
About 50 house officers, ASSU
representatives, student group
leaders and other concerned stu
dents met with acting Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson
to discuss how to enforce Stan
ford's new alcohol policy, which
prohibits* underage drinking on
campus.
Implemented Oct. 1, the policy
was mandated by a federal law
stipulating that all universities
receiving federal funds must pro
hibit unlawful use or possession of
drugs and alcohol.
Robinson stressed to the audi
ence the importance of finding
"reasonable steps ... to imple
ment this policy," adding that
eradicating all underage drinking
on campus is neither possible nor
the University's intention.
Student suggestions ranged
from adding no new enforcement
mechanisms to creating a campus
task force to monitor underage
drinking.
"The unpopularity of the [pol
icy] makes it impossible to self

regulate," said senior Michael
Mazzeo, a Schiff House resident.
"The only way to come up with a
policy that would work ... would
be to come up with some policing
and enforcement personnel
within the University, ne said.
But many students disagreed,
saying strict enforcement mecha
nisms would be too neat a depar
ture from the old policy.
Arroyo president Dana Rabois,
a sophomore, said, "To have a spe
cial task force of enforcers would
be ridiculous. All [the federal gov
ernment] asked for was a law, not
people to enforce that law."
Some students suggested that
alcohol policy violations be treated
like any other Fundamental Stan
dard infraction, without a specific
set of rules and punishments.
This would mark only a small
change from the old policy, leaving
underage students responsible for
the decision to drink and its con
sequences.
"I think using the Fundamen
tal Standard and putting a sign
above the bar (warning that
underage drinking is against state
law) is the best enforcement we're
going to get," ASSU Senator Beth
Morgan argued.
Others recommended that only
the Stanford Police Department
enforce the policy so tnat resi-
