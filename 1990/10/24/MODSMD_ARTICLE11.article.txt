Court awards 'sex slave'
millions from Penthouse
NEW YORK (AP) — A judge yesterday
ordered Penthouse magazine and its publisher
Robert Guccione to pay $4.06 million to a for
mer Pet of the Year who charged that he used
her as a virtual sex slave.
State Judge Elliott Wilk ruled that Guccione
made sexual demands on Maijorie Thoreson as
a condition of employment at Penthouse,
where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
"Sexual slavery was not part of her job
description," Wilk said.
She testified during the March 1989 trial
that Guccione forced her to perform hard-core
sex acts in a pornographic movie and used her
sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a
hotel-casino he owned in Atlantic City.
Thoreson sued Guccione after he fired her in
1980 because she refused to accompany him on
a trip to the Far East. She said she feared he
would pass her around to the businessmen he
was meeting.
