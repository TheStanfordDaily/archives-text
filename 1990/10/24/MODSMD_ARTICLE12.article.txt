TEL AVIV Israel (AP) â€” Defense Minister Moshe
Arens yesterday barred Palestinians in the occupied
territories from traveling to Israel following a series
of revenge attacks by Jews and Arabs.
Under Arens' order, the 1.7 million Palestinian
residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
will be banned from entering Israel beginning this
morning, the military command said. Those staying
in Israel, where many work, were ordered to return
home.
Israel television said the travel ban will remain in
effect for "several days" until tensions are reduced.
The army usually erects barriers on main roads
leading to the territories to enforce such orders.
The last closure of the occupied areas in response
to violence was after the May 20 slaying of seven
Arabs by a Jewish civilian near Tel Aviv. The territo
ries also have been blocked in recent years during
the Jewish Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement,
holiday.
Arens' order was issued hours after Israeli civil
ians fired on an Arab car in the southern Negev
desert, killing one Palestinian laborer and wounding
his three cousins.
Doctors at Nasser Hospital in the Gaza Strip
town of Khan Yunis identified the victim as Maher
A 1 Shaher, 30. One of the wounded was in serious
condition with a gunshot to the back, they said.
Palestinian reporters said the four were return
ing from work in Israel when they came under fire
from a red Jeep in the area of Mivtahim, near Gaza.
The army confirmed the Palestinians were appar
ently shot by Jewish civilians and said the attack
was being investigated.
Earlier yesterday, a West Bank Palestinian knifed
two unarmed women soldiers and another Arab
bludgeoned two Israelis with a hammer.
The knife-wielding Arab was chased and captured
by soldiers and civilians, police said. There were
reports he was beaten, and hospital officials said he
was in critical condition with head injuries.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the recent
wave of attacks on Israelis, which began Sunday
with three stabbing deaths in Jerusalem, resulted
from "unusual hysterical incitement" of Arabs.
Tension has risen since Oct. 8, when police fired
on stone-throwing Palestinians at Jerusalem's hal
lowed Temple Mount, killing at least 19 Arabs.
Clandestine leaflets have urged Arabs to step up
attacks on Jews, and the violence since Sunday's
killings raised fears that the 34-month Palestinian
uprising may be entering a more dangerous phase.
Shamir said security was being increased "in all
parts of the country," but he insisted the violence
would die down in a matter of days.
