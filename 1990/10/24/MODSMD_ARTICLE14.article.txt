### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole will
resign to head the American Red
Cross, making her the first of
President Bush's Cabinet secre
taries to depart, administration
sources said yesterday.
Dole, 54, is credited by orga
nized labor with easing hostilities
with Republicans during her
nearly two years at the Labor
Department. She worked to
strengthen job safety programs
and toughen enforcement of child
labor laws, and was praised for
her efforts to settle the bitter
Pittston coal strike. Others criti
cized her "low profile" within the
administration.
President Bush appeared to
confirm her departure. Asked at a
fund-raiser in Connecticut if Dole
had resigned, he replied only,
"Tomorrow."

Her departure from the Labor
Department had been rumored
for months. Late yesterday, aides
had not nailed down a time for the
official announcement.
Labor Department officials did
not immediately return phone
calls, but administration sources
said an announcement was immi
nent. Several sources on Capitol
Hill also confirmed Dole's resigna
tion. All asked for anonymity.
There was no explanation for
her reported decision.
Dole, wife of Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole, won praise from
union leaders who had been ren
dered outcasts in the Reagan
administration.
"It's a genuine loss to the Bush
administration and to working
people across the country," Janice
Lacharice, a spokeswoman for the
American Federation of Govern*

ment Employees, said of Dole's
impending resignation."It will be
very, very difficult to replace her."
"She was very committed to
her open-door policy" toward
organized labor, Lachance said.
John Peterpaul, vice president
of the Machinists union, offered a
different view. "I don't think
she'll be missed by the workers of
America,"he said. "She's been so
low-profile."
He expressed bitterness about
Dole's handling of the Eastern
Airlines strike that started in
March 1989, when the adminis
tration refused to appoint a presi
dential emergency board to inter
vene in the crisis.
An American Red Cross offi
cial, Barbara Lohman, would not
comment on the report that Dole
would head the organization.
