# Democrats split on budget; Bush demands support
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — White House and con
gressional negotiators wearily resumed their hunt
for a budget accord yesterday after House Demo
cratic leaders failed to drum up enough support for a
compromise on taxing the rich.
At a private caucus of the House's majority
Democrats, only half the lawmakers indicated sup
port for the plan that also would raise the gasoline
tax by a nickel or more a gallon and impose higher
costs on Medicare recipients.
President Bush, campaigning for Republican can
didates in New England, yesterday defended his sup
port for unpopular higher taxes and spending cuts.
He said the days of "damn the deficit must come to
an end."
"We're hanging tough for a good agreement,"
Bush said, speaking in one of the most economically
hard-pressed regions of the country. He said he
hoped a budget package he can support would be
crafted by congressional negotiators by today's mid
night deadline.
"We've got a sluggish economy out there nation
ally," Bush said, claiming that a $500-billion, five
year deficit-reduction plan could help the economy
by driving down interest rates.
He called on Republicans, many of whom oppose
his budget stand, to put "self interest" aside and
stand with him in support of a budget plan.
With most House Republicans ready to oppose
higher taxes, the lack of Democratic support left
leaders well short of the votes needed to pass the
deficit-reduction plan and end the government's
long's budget impasse.
The long-running budget struggle held center
stage as the 101st Congress labored to complete its
work.
But in the final few days before national elections,
there were other politically-charged issues nearing a
final vote, as well:
— The Senate delayed an attempt to override the
president's veto of a civil rights bill. The president
claims the bill's anti-job discrimination provisions
would lead to hiring quotas.
— A toughening of the nation's clean air laws was
expected to go to a final vote on Wednesday or Thurs
day.
— A new spending bill was needed to keep the
government in funds after midnight Wednesday.
Bush, campaigning in New England, wouldn't say
whether he would sign such a bill but put the blame
for the situation on the Democratic-controlled
Congress. He said he was "so frustrated by
Congress' inability to do anything ... I don't know
what I'm going to do."
He described the House Democrats' meeting as "a
raucous caucus (that) couldn't agree on anything."
"We asked for a show of hands on support for the
package and it was right down the middle — 50-50,"
said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-111., chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee. "That's not good, not
good at all."
Senate Democrats greeted the would-be budget
compromise much more warmly. After meeting with
them, Senate Mtyority Leader George Mitchell, D-
Maine, said he expected a majority would support
the proposal.
As the House Democrats were delivering their bad
news to their leaders, Bush called on Republicans to
support a compromise plan, and White House offi
cials came to the Capitol to resume negotiations.

The emerging $250-billion deficit-cutting package
would raise the gasoline tax by about a nickel per gal
lon, cut Medicare and other benefit programs, and
increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans. It would
also boost taxes on alcohol, tobacco, airline tickets
and luxury items such as yachts.
The two sides have agreed to raise the tax rate on
the richest people to 31 percent from its current 28
percent. The final impediment has proven to be a
sharp partisan dispute over how to take an addi
tional tax bite from the wealthy — a touchy issue
with Election Day just two weeks off.
Democrats prefer a surtax on millionaires of
about 7.5 percent, which they say is fair and easy for
voters to understand.
But Bush and many Republicans prefer instead to
limit tho income-tax deductions the rich can take.
That would allow them to avoid Democratic claims
that Bush backtracked so far on campaign pledges
that he actually raised tax rates.
The proposed compromise Democratic leaders
brought their members yesterday contained no sur
tax. Instead, it limited deductions for people earning
$100,000 by about 3 percent, and limited them even
further — by about 5 percent — for people earning
$1 million yearly
But just days after the House approved a budget
that would put heavy new taxes on the rich, many of
the chamber's Democrats felt the new plan didn't go
far enough.
"More than half the people felt the tentative out
line was too great a retraction from what the House

adopted, that the strong favor of progressivity would
be heavily diluted," said Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis.
"The answer coming out of there is clearly no,"
said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.
Others seemed ready to compromise.
"Of all the alternatives on the table right now,
none are worse than nothing," said Rep. Jim Slat
tery, D-Kan.
Democrats said the meeting proved that two
paths were now needed. Either more Republican
votes had to be rounded up, or the plan would have
to be changed to Democrats' liking.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
late yesterday that Republicans had offered to sup
port an alternative: phasing out the personal exemp
tion for the well-to-do. Currently, all but the wealth
iest taxpayers are entitled to the $2,050 exemption.
Dole said another option was to simply drop the
idea of limiting deductions and forego the revenues
that the proposal would raise. Depending on how
tightly deductions are limited, dropping the idea
completely could cost about $30 billion over five
years.
"Then we could blame the Democrats for not get
ting the savings," Dole said.
But the immediate reaction couldn't have been
encouraging. Rep. Peter Smith, the congressman for
whom Bush was campaigning in Burlington, Vt.,
used the occasion to cite "specific disagreements" he
had with the president on issues including deficit
reduction.

deficit-reduction plan and end the government's
long's budget impasse.
The long-running budget struggle held center
stage as the 101st Congress labored to complete its
work.
But in the final few days before national elections,
there were other politically-charged issues nearing a
final vote, as well:
— The Senate delayed an attempt to override the
president's veto of a civil rights bill. The president
claims the bill's anti-job discrimination provisions
would lead to hiring quotas.
— A toughening of the nation's clean air laws was
expected to go to a final vote on Wednesday or Thurs
day.
— A new spending bill was needed to keep the
government in funds after midnight Wednesday.
Bush, campaigning in New England, wouldn't say
whether he would sign such a bill but put the blame
for the situation on the Democratic-controlled
Congress. He said he was "so frustrated by
Congress' inability to do anything ... I don't know
what I'm going to do."
He described the House Democrats' meeting as "a
raucous caucus (that) couldn't agree on anything."
"We asked for a show of hands on support for the
package and it was right down the middle — 50-50,"
said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-111., chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee. "That's not good, not
good at all."
Senate Democrats greeted the would-be budget
compromise much more warmly. After meeting with
them, Senate Mtyority Leader George Mitchell, D-
Maine, said he expected a majority would support
the proposal.
As the House Democrats were delivering their bad
news to their leaders, Bush called on Republicans to
support a compromise plan, and White House offi
cials came to the Capitol to resume negotiations.

The emerging $250-billion deficit-cutting package
would raise the gasoline tax by about a nickel per gal
lon, cut Medicare and other benefit programs, and
increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans. It would
also boost taxes on alcohol, tobacco, airline tickets
and luxury items such as yachts.
The two sides have agreed to raise the tax rate on
the richest people to 31 percent from its current 28
percent. The final impediment has proven to be a
sharp partisan dispute over how to take an addi
tional tax bite from the wealthy — a touchy issue
with Election Day just two weeks off.
Democrats prefer a surtax on millionaires of
about 7.5 percent, which they say is fair and easy for
voters to understand.
But Bush and many Republicans prefer instead to
limit tho income-tax deductions the rich can take.
That would allow them to avoid Democratic claims
that Bush backtracked so far on campaign pledges
that he actually raised tax rates.
The proposed compromise Democratic leaders
brought their members yesterday contained no sur
tax. Instead, it limited deductions for people earning
$100,000 by about 3 percent, and limited them even
further — by about 5 percent — for people earning
$1 million yearly
But just days after the House approved a budget
that would put heavy new taxes on the rich, many of
the chamber's Democrats felt the new plan didn't go
far enough.
"More than half the people felt the tentative out
line was too great a retraction from what the House

adopted, that the strong favor of progressivity would
be heavily diluted," said Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis.
"The answer coming out of there is clearly no,"
said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.
Others seemed ready to compromise.
"Of all the alternatives on the table right now,
none are worse than nothing," said Rep. Jim Slat
tery, D-Kan.
Democrats said the meeting proved that two
paths were now needed. Either more Republican
votes had to be rounded up, or the plan would have
to be changed to Democrats' liking.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
late yesterday that Republicans had offered to sup
port an alternative: phasing out the personal exemp
tion for the well-to-do. Currently, all but the wealth
iest taxpayers are entitled to the $2,050 exemption.
Dole said another option was to simply drop the
idea of limiting deductions and forego the revenues
that the proposal would raise. Depending on how
tightly deductions are limited, dropping the idea
completely could cost about $30 billion over five
years.
"Then we could blame the Democrats for not get
ting the savings," Dole said.
But the immediate reaction couldn't have been
encouraging. Rep. Peter Smith, the congressman for
whom Bush was campaigning in Burlington, Vt.,
used the occasion to cite "specific disagreements" he
had with the president on issues including deficit
reduction.

WASHINGTON (AP) — White House and con
gressional negotiators wearily resumed their hunt
for a budget accord yesterday after House Demo
cratic leaders failed to drum up enough support for a
compromise on taxing the rich.
At a private caucus of the House's majority
Democrats, only half the lawmakers indicated sup
port for the plan that also would raise the gasoline
tax by a nickel or more a gallon and impose higher
costs on Medicare recipients.
President Bush, campaigning for Republican can
didates in New England, yesterday defended his sup
port for unpopular higher taxes and spending cuts.
He said the days of "damn the deficit must come to
an end."
"We're hanging tough for a good agreement,"
Bush said, speaking in one of the most economically
hard-pressed regions of the country. He said he
hoped a budget package he can support would be
crafted by congressional negotiators by today's mid
night deadline.
"We've got a sluggish economy out there nation
ally," Bush said, claiming that a $500-billion, five
year deficit-reduction plan could help the economy
by driving down interest rates.
He called on Republicans, many of whom oppose
his budget stand, to put "self interest" aside and
stand with him in support of a budget plan.
With most House Republicans ready to oppose
higher taxes, the lack of Democratic support left
leaders well short of the votes needed to pass the
deficit-reduction plan and end the government's
long's budget impasse.
