# Death squad killings surge in El Salvador
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) â€” Amnesty International
today reported a significant upsurge in the
number of killings by army-supported death
squads this year in EI Salvador.
The London-based human rights group
reported more people were killed in the first
seven months of 1990 than in all of last year.
Between January and early August, 45 people
had reportedly been killed by death squads.
Forty were reportedly killed by death squads in
1989, it said.
Amnesty said killings, torture and "disap
pearances" have continued despite a U.N.
Agreement on Human Rights signed July 26
by the government of President Alfredo Cris
tiani and the guerrilla group Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front (FMLN).
"Bodies of victims have been found muti
lated, some with their faces completely
destroyed and others with signs of having been
brutally tortured. Victims have been shot dead
on the streets or in their homes," the Amnesty
report said.
The Nobel Peace Prize-winning group
detailed several killings, including an agricul
tural cooperative member slain Aug. 1 at work,
and a union member who was taken from his
home by two men in civilian clothes July 23.
His body was found the following day.
Amnesty said its information on the death
squad killings came from former members of
the security forces, among other sources.
Amnesty said its sources and other informa
tion "including testimonies by former mem
bers of the military, suggests that those
responsible for these actions (death squad
killings) are linked to the armed forces."
It said four apparent death squad killings
that occurred in the days following the U.N.
accord "suggest that those responsible are con
tinuing to operate with the confidence that
they will not be punished."
Amnesty said Cristiani's government had
acknowledged reforms were needed and that
the security forces sometimes committed
"excesses." But the government has denied
involvement.
"However, the extent and nature of the
abuses and the fact that human rights viola
tions have been committed with almost total
impunity under this and previous government
has left little doubt of official complicity,"
Amnesty said.
The rights organization said it was also con
cerned about reports of rights abuses linked to
the FMLN.
The report on El Salvador is based on find
ings by Amnesty delegates who visited the
country in April.
The report contains 34 recommendations,
including making full investigations into viola
tions; strengthening the office of the Attorney
General and ensuring its independence, and
protection forjudges and witnesses involved in
human rights cases.
The two sides began cease-fire talks in May
and are scheduled to meet Nov. 4 in Mexico.
