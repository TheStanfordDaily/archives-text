## We're still confused 
### 
The administration can
enforce the law and
still honor students

A LOT OF CONFUSION, two
slow weekends and a parly in
the bathroom at Cedro are
about all that have resulted from
Stanford's current "interim posi
tion" on alcohol consumption.
Until a final decision is reached,
students need a clear and immedi
ate statement on the status of the
alcohol policy.
The ambiguity of the Univer
sity's current stand is creating
problems for those eager to comply
with University policy but unsure
of exactly what that policy is.
A straightforward policy would
clarify students' rights and respon
sibilities. It would also serve as a
litmus test for any new restrictions
the University is considering
imposing.
As to those restrictions, it is
clear that the administration can
not completely ignore the legisla
tion of the federal government.
And it has not.
The University has already com
plied with the letter of the law by
officially prohibiting the consump
tion of alcohol by minors.
However, if the University insti
gates severe punishments for
teenage drinking, there could be
detrimental effects on many
aspects of campus life.
For instance, Stanford's incredi
bly popular residential system
would be threatened. Stanford's
resident assistants are almost
unanimously liked.
Giving the RAs an enforcement
role in the alcohol policy would
threaten this relationship and
cause students to drink in their
rooms with the doors closed, away

from the eyes of now-unwelcome
residence staff.
It is obvious that student drink
ing behind closed doors is inher
ently more dangerous than the
public, open, social drinking that
has characterized University social
life.
Another measure discussed by
the administration is the prohibi
tion of dorm funds for buying alco
hol. This would promote exclusion
and the division of residential
social groups along lines of
drinkers and non-drinkers.
This, in turn, would "privatize"
drinking life in Stanford resi
dences; students would pool their
money for alcohol and buy it on
their own.
Traditionally the University has
respected the residences as
autonomous communities that use
their own space and decide how to
spend their own funds. Hopefully,
the University will affirm that the
alcohol policy is not a residential
issue.
The administration could con
form to the requirements of the
law, without compromising Stan
ford's traditional social environ
ment by dispensing mild punish
ments — letters of reprimand, rec
ommendations to counseling for
repeated offenses — to those who
are cited by police and convicted of
alcohol-related misdemeanors.
However, the University should
resist taking the role of the police
upon itself, and limit enforcement
to punishment of those convicted
of breaking state laws.
The University will have a lot of
latitude in interpreting, imple
menting and enforcing the federal
legislation.
And the administration must
use all that latitude to preserve, as
much as possible, the openness and
popularity of University social and
residential life.
Students will accept nothing
less.
