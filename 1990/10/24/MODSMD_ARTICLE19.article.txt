Stanford filled with
resentful whiners and
cowering facultg
Did you see that black master
sergeant in charge of servicing fighter
planes in the Gulf on MacNeil-Lehrer?
He was being interviewed by Charlene
Hunter-Gault.
He was a Vietnam veteran, a straight
shooter, and the kind of guy that makes
you feel good about America. Watching a
plane take off he said, "That's the sound
of freedom." His words almost had the
force of the Gettysburg Address.
Was I the only one to weep tears of
pride and nostalgia for my own lost
youth (I soldiered in World War II) and a
better America? All the Gl's who
appeared on that program made me feel
much the same way. And how unreal, by
comparison, most of the people you meet
on campuses seem these days.
Where do you find the authenticity
that goes with facing the Heideggerian
Angst or Being-unto-death? I mean also
inwardly, in the soul, not just in some
external, physical way.
Instead, all we find is whining resent
ment, lobbying for this or that selfish
interest, like in our disgusting Congress.
That master sergeant would be ostra
cized here as an Uncle Tom, no doubt.
Just as every other gritty and beautiful
soul in the Western tradition is ostra
cized for not spouting the party-line of
the vengeful herd, as in the case of
Pasternak, Sakharov, Mandelstam and
Solzhenitsyn in the miserable and failed
Soviet Union.
We seem to have learned nothing from
that example. On the contrary, the
authoritarian torch has passed to Stan
ford.
In the Chronicle of Higher Education,
we learned that the following is planned
for our brave new undergraduate pro-

gram: classes will be visited, paper grad
ing monitored, letters of recommenda
tion inspected.
And the cowering faculty who voted to
mutilate the course on Western Culture
will probably go along.

Ad Hoc Committee
does not select the
new athletic director
While I appreciate the Daily's cover
age of the Ad Hoc Committee on
Athletics at Stanford (Daily, Oct. 23), as
chairman I'd like to correct one point: we
are not the search committee for a new
director of athletics. Indeed, the search
process has not been defined or started
by President Kennedy.
In President Kennedy's charge to the
committee, he makes clear that we are to
examine the entire athletic program —
physical education, recreation and inter
collegiate sports — and then make rec
ommendations that will help shape the
role of athletics in the Stanford commu
nity.
Our task will include advising the
President on methods of selection for a
new athletic director and the necessary
qualifications for a successful candidate,
but will not include the search or selec
tion process for the position.

Nom Com editorial
should be forgotten
The Oct. 18 editorial entitled "End
Nom Com Now" has no redeeming fea
ture whatsoever.
Granted, the results of ASSU's pro
cess of nomination of students for com-

mittees has not always worked well —
last year comes immediately to mind —
but to conclude that the structure is
faulty when those who operate it don't
produce perfect results is a simplistic and
unjustified — not to mention unin
formed — copout.
As someone who works closely with
ASSU in this matter, I assure you that
the recently concluded cycle of nomina
tions shows that students can manage
the process carefully and effectively, that
last year's poor results were just last
year's, and that, for the time being at
least, there is not reason to change the
structure for nominating students to
serve on the many groups included in the
process.
It is incredible that The Daily's edito
rial board seriously advocates that "each
committee should be independently
responsible for publicizing and filling any
and all of its student positions."
The chaos and egregiously duplicative
efforts that would result if each commit
tee were to conduct its own search and
appointments are too terrifying to con
template, especially in a time when both
the University and the ASSU are focus
ing on increased efficiency and decreased
expenditures.
Rather than write more, I want to
associate myself with the excellent letter
from the ASSU Nominations
Commission (October 22) and suggest
that your editorial be filed under F for
"forget."

Article on National
Coming Out Day
ignored 'out queers'
Are there no "out" queers on this
campus? This certainly seems to be the
underlying message of the Daily article
on National Coming Out Day.
This article consisted mostly of quotes
from and descriptions of students who

were identified with names in quotation
marks, "the not my real name" style
found in confessional letters to Ann
Landers.
There are many pressures that keep
people in the closet, but the point of
National Coming Out Day is to provide
people with the strength to resist and
overcome these pressures. That The
Daily didn't find a single out student for
an article on coming out was ironic, at
best.
At worst, it implies that being lesbian
or gay involves accepting a stigmatized
identity, having a secret and/or living a
double life.
Next time you write an article about
lesbians and/or gay men, why not focus
on lesbian and gay people who reject the
stigma? For an article on National
Coming Out Day that would certainly be
more to the point.
We, the undersigned, are all out
queers. We're sure we're not the only
ones.
