## Night people — unite! 
### 
JANGLED OUT OF A DEEP slumber
by the phone's insistent ring, I reluc
tantly unravel myself from my
cocoon of sheets and pillows.
It feels like 6 a.m., but the clock shows
9:30. On the line it's my friend, a banker,
who's already been at his office for two
hours. My grogginess tips him off.
"Oh, Dan, I didn't wake you up did I?"
Hmmm. How to answer? If I tell him
the truth — that yes, dammit, he did
wake me up — he might feel bad and,
worse yet, I'll needlessly fuel his suspi
cion that I am lazy and only in graduate
school to avoid the rigors of the 8-5 work
schedule.
But if I lie and tell him I was already
awake, he'll feel free to call at the same
hour in the future, God forbid.
The tribulations of being a night per
son in a morning person's world extend
beyond the work week and into the week
end, when sleeping late is supposed to be
socially acceptable.
More than once, I have met a friend for
Sunday brunch, only to be subjected to
their proud list of morning accomplish
ments: body invigorated by sunrise jog,
laundry washed and folded, bills and cor
respondence mailed, groceries procured,
lawn mowed, house painted and rewired,
etc.
By that point in the day, I can only
counter with: gone potty and brushed
teeth.
Recently I decided to do something to
raise awareness of the legitimate
grievances of night people. I knew that
others shared my out-of-sync sleep sched
ule and that since we crossed all racial,

religious, socio-economic and ideological
lines, probably no organizations already
existed to advance our cause.
The discrimination we face ranges
from jobs which require an 8 a.m. start to
the derisive everyday comments of morn
ing people who feel free to smirk with
superiority at the "underachievers" who
routinely get up later than they do.
I realized that the difficulty of my
organizational task would be com
pounded by the ideological hegemony of
morning people, which is so total that we
night people have come to believe that we
really are a lazy, unworthy lot.
To overcome such conditioning, I
would need scientific backing for my the
ory that biological destiny, not laziness,
was at the root of our sleep patterns.
So I headed off to the Stanford Sleep
Disorders Clinic. Like any unscrupulous
social scientist, I already knew what my
conclusions were and was selectively
searching for evidence to render them
more persuasive to others.
Sure enough, the doctor said that I was
suffering from Delayed Sleep Phase Syn
drome (DSPS): my body was physiologi
cally programmed to run on a 2 a.m.-10
a.m. sleep pattern rather than the more
customary 11 p.m.-7 a.m.
People with DSPS typically misdiag
nose themselves as insomniacs. If we
retire at 11 p.m., it may take us three
hours to get to sleep. And when we try to
wake up at 7 a.m. for a job or social com
mitment, it is, according to our
biorhythm, the equivalent of 4 a.m.
Light therapy is being used to help us
realign our schedules to conform to soci

ety's expectations. But I say we should
stand our ground — we don't have a "syn
drome," and we're not lazy, we just work
better late at night than early in the
morning. And in an age of electrification,
it's not as if we need to follow the dictates
of the sun like cave people.
So, my plan of action is as follows:
• Reject the DSPS label and rename
ourselves, simply, Night People (NP).
• Lobby the Stanford Faculty Senate to
mandate that for every 9 a.m. class, at
least one will start at 1 a.m.
• Lobby Palo Alto's City Council to
wait until later than 10 p.m. before acti
vating the blinding array of flashing red
and yellow traffic lights on University
Ave.
• Persuade my congressman to intro
duce affirmative action legislation to cor
rect for centuries of anti-NP discrimina
tion.
• Organize a boycott against all corpo
rations that do not offer a flex-time
option to employees.
• And lastly, I am going to start calling
my "morning" friends at 3 a.m. to ask
them what they've accomplished since 10
p.m.

Daniel Abbasi is desperately searching
for an all-night coffee shop. If you know
of one, please drop a note in his box at The
Daily.
