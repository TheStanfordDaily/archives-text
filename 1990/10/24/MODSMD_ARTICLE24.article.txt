## Greg Cumberford Stanford graduate deals with confronting the faceless enemy 
### 
I AM USUALLY DEAD ASLEEP when
my clock radio goes off at 5:30 each
morning, and I hear Bob Edwards'
sonorous voice deliver National Public
Radio's daily quip.
Lately, often within the last dream of
the night that has been interrupted, I
expect NPR's one-liner to be followed by
Carl Castle announcing dispassionately
that, due to Israel's pre-emptive strike
against Iraqi missile sites (or some other
hair-triggered scenario), America is now
at war with Iraq.
Then I imagine Castle beginning to
report the first of many estimates of
American and Iraqi dead, of young men
and women my age caught between the
economic aspirations of their leaders.
I expect that at first I will feel a deep
sense of despair at the aimless hatred we
are allowing ourselves as nations to pro
ject on each other's peoples — a hatred
rising not from a coherent and long
standing disgust for Iraqi injustice but,
for most of us, through ignorance over
how much this crisis has its roots in an
expedient American foreign policy of sup
plying arms to the enemies of our (cur
rent) enemies in order to keep our oil
dependent economy flush with its under
priced life blood.
Before my terrible dream is confirmed
in the news, I need to share some more
abiding thoughts contained within that
initial screaming wave of despair that will
run through me.
I am college-age, competent, idealistic,
proud to be a American — everything a
good soldier should be — and yet inca
pable of feeling that a war with Iraq can

be justified.
My father served in the Navy during
the early years (1962-66) of the Vietnam
War, but he does feel a great sadness
inside over how different his intentions as
a young cadet were from the confusing
results he felt after his tour of duty.
I think of how many thousands of men
and women who served in Vietnam share
that loss of their youth and ideals to a
gaping — and equally faceless — bureau
cratic black hole.
Ten, twenty years down the road, I
face the prospect of explaining to my chil
dren why I resisted the war with Iraq and
how I chose to handle the conflicts arising
from that choice.
My mind is running through those
thoughts now, not knowing or caring
whether this conflict will devolve into a
clear-cut and "popular" war or whether
we in the West simply have nc idea how
deep the rage of 200 million Arabs runs

against over five decades of division and
conquest by the victors of World War I. I
believe the latter scenario.
I will tell my children that I did not
believe America's economic survival nor
Saudi Arabia's sovereignty was threat
ened by Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
I will tell them that in the absence of
Cold War power struggles, Kuwait's occu
pation squarely and rightly challenged
the United Nations to act forcefully on
behalf of a member nation and to provide
for that nation's defense.
I will tell them that whatever damage
our economy could have sustained by the
loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil we actually
took upon ourselves through the eco
nomic embargo. (The real damage came
from letting our nation's social infras
tructure fail under a huge federal deficit
while also trying to fight a gritty, distant
and clearly expensive war over cheap oil.)
I could not tell my children that the
war was to defend fellow democracies,
because Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are
monarchies. I will not hide from my chil
dren that the true long-term beneficiaries
of the war were our oil companies, who
realized huge windfall profits once oil
prices jumped to over $60 per barrel, and
our defense industries, who benefited
first from all the weaponry we sold to Iraq
and then from all the gear we sold to the
Saudis, Egyptians and Israelis.
I will tell my children that, out of the
lucid priorities I felt once the war started,
I acted in support of values and ideals
which I believe supported America's eco
nomic vitality and, therefore, its security.
First, I took advantage of Rep. Tom

Campbell's responsiveness, exhorting
him to carry the message to Congress
that I only supported United Nations
backed efforts to restore Kuwait as a
nation and that I vehemently opposed
unilateral efforts by the U.S. to right a
wrong with two more wrongs: killing tens
of thousands in order to remove one man
from power and settling down in Saudi
Arabia to regulate the flow of cheap oil
from the Persian Gulf for the next 40
years.
I also told Campbell that I thought any
offers of support for a restored govern
ment in Kuwait should insist on basic
reforms in women's rights and demo
cratic political freedoms.
I worked to show that cheap oil is a
luxury of the past and that more strin
gent federal fuel conservation standards
in our homes and automobile fleets, once
implemented by clear-eyed senators and
congresspersons, would effectively offset
our need to import oil from the Persian
Gulf.
I did this work by proving to myself
that I could consume at least half the oil
and gasoline that I "needed" in 1990 by:
driving gas-powered vehicles far less
(walking, biking, busing, car-pooling
instead); thoroughly insulating my home
and work spaces using my utility's conve
nient guidelines; eating foods grown and

served in Vietnam share that loss of their youth.

produced most locally so that I wasn't
subsidizing needless trucking and ship
ping; refusing plastic bagging and packag
ing at every opportunity, and calling for
legislation that progressively eliminated
non-recyclable plastics from the market;
and encouraging my friends to do the
same.
I worked at a manageable personal
scale to eliminate my contribution to a
lifestyle that the Bush Administration
claimed the war was defending. At the
same time I helped to increase America's
economic security and innovation in
energy-efficient technologies.
Should I ever in truth end up explain
ing my decisions to my children, those
decisions, sadly, will have put me at odds
with the mainstream. It will mean that
many people bought the "logic" of a war
with Iraq.
They bought it because it allowed them
to focus their aimless hatred on a distant,
oppressed people and their oppressor,
rather than see a national substance
addiction (to oil) for what it is and decide
to never again place our livelihoods — lit
erally — over a barrel.

Should I ever in truth end up explain
ing my decisions to my children, those
decisions, sadly, will have put me at odds
with the mainstream. It will mean that
many people bought the "logic" of a war
with Iraq.
They bought it because it allowed them
to focus their aimless hatred on a distant,
oppressed people and their oppressor,
rather than see a national substance
addiction (to oil) for what it is and decide
to never again place our livelihoods — lit
erally — over a barrel.

I AM USUALLY DEAD ASLEEP when
my clock radio goes off at 5:30 each
morning, and I hear Bob Edwards'
sonorous voice deliver National Public
Radio's daily quip.
Lately, often within the last dream of
the night that has been interrupted, I
expect NPR's one-liner to be followed by
Carl Castle announcing dispassionately
that, due to Israel's pre-emptive strike
against Iraqi missile sites (or some other
hair-triggered scenario), America is now
at war with Iraq.
Then I imagine Castle beginning to
report the first of many estimates of
American and Iraqi dead, of young men
and women my age caught between the
economic aspirations of their leaders.
I expect that at first I will feel a deep
sense of despair at the aimless hatred we
are allowing ourselves as nations to pro
ject on each other's peoples — a hatred
rising not from a coherent and long
standing disgust for Iraqi injustice but,
for most of us, through ignorance over
how much this crisis has its roots in an
expedient American foreign policy of sup
plying arms to the enemies of our (cur
rent) enemies in order to keep our oil
dependent economy flush with its under
priced life blood.
Before my terrible dream is confirmed
in the news, I need to share some more
abiding thoughts contained within that
initial screaming wave of despair that will
run through me.
I am college-age, competent, idealistic,
proud to be a American — everything a
good soldier should be — and yet inca
pable of feeling that a war with Iraq can

be justified.
My father served in the Navy during
the early years (1962-66) of the Vietnam
War, but he does feel a great sadness
inside over how different his intentions as
a young cadet were from the confusing
results he felt after his tour of duty.
I think of how many thousands of men
and women who served in Vietnam share
that loss of their youth and ideals to a
gaping — and equally faceless — bureau
cratic black hole.
Ten, twenty years down the road, I
face the prospect of explaining to my chil
dren why I resisted the war with Iraq and
how I chose to handle the conflicts arising
from that choice.
My mind is running through those
thoughts now, not knowing or caring
whether this conflict will devolve into a
clear-cut and "popular" war or whether
we in the West simply have nc idea how
deep the rage of 200 million Arabs runs

against over five decades of division and
conquest by the victors of World War I. I
believe the latter scenario.
I will tell my children that I did not
believe America's economic survival nor
Saudi Arabia's sovereignty was threat
ened by Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
I will tell them that in the absence of
Cold War power struggles, Kuwait's occu
pation squarely and rightly challenged
the United Nations to act forcefully on
behalf of a member nation and to provide
for that nation's defense.
I will tell them that whatever damage
our economy could have sustained by the
loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil we actually
took upon ourselves through the eco
nomic embargo. (The real damage came
from letting our nation's social infras
tructure fail under a huge federal deficit
while also trying to fight a gritty, distant
and clearly expensive war over cheap oil.)
I could not tell my children that the
war was to defend fellow democracies,
because Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are
monarchies. I will not hide from my chil
dren that the true long-term beneficiaries
of the war were our oil companies, who
realized huge windfall profits once oil
prices jumped to over $60 per barrel, and
our defense industries, who benefited
first from all the weaponry we sold to Iraq
and then from all the gear we sold to the
Saudis, Egyptians and Israelis.
I will tell my children that, out of the
lucid priorities I felt once the war started,
I acted in support of values and ideals
which I believe supported America's eco
nomic vitality and, therefore, its security.
First, I took advantage of Rep. Tom

Campbell's responsiveness, exhorting
him to carry the message to Congress
that I only supported United Nations
backed efforts to restore Kuwait as a
nation and that I vehemently opposed
unilateral efforts by the U.S. to right a
wrong with two more wrongs: killing tens
of thousands in order to remove one man
from power and settling down in Saudi
Arabia to regulate the flow of cheap oil
from the Persian Gulf for the next 40
years.
I also told Campbell that I thought any
offers of support for a restored govern
ment in Kuwait should insist on basic
reforms in women's rights and demo
cratic political freedoms.
I worked to show that cheap oil is a
luxury of the past and that more strin
gent federal fuel conservation standards
in our homes and automobile fleets, once
implemented by clear-eyed senators and
congresspersons, would effectively offset
our need to import oil from the Persian
Gulf.
I did this work by proving to myself
that I could consume at least half the oil
and gasoline that I "needed" in 1990 by:
driving gas-powered vehicles far less
(walking, biking, busing, car-pooling
instead); thoroughly insulating my home
and work spaces using my utility's conve
nient guidelines; eating foods grown and

I think of how many thousands of men and women who
served in Vietnam share that loss of their youth.

produced most locally so that I wasn't
subsidizing needless trucking and ship
ping; refusing plastic bagging and packag
ing at every opportunity, and calling for
legislation that progressively eliminated
non-recyclable plastics from the market;
and encouraging my friends to do the
same.
I worked at a manageable personal
scale to eliminate my contribution to a
lifestyle that the Bush Administration
claimed the war was defending. At the
same time I helped to increase America's
economic security and innovation in
energy-efficient technologies.
Should I ever in truth end up explain
ing my decisions to my children, those
decisions, sadly, will have put me at odds
with the mainstream. It will mean that
