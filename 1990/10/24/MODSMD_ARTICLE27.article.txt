## Bug descrambles cable TV mystery 
### Brian White Kurt Gish 
. My brother taped a movie
»for me from cable. When
I watched it, the picture bright
ness had an annoying oscilla
tion of bright to dim. Why ? By
the way, how does the cable
descrambler box work?
A .First of all, you should
• have FBI Special Agent
Dale Cooper arrest your
brother for illegal video copy
ing, which carries penalties up
to $10,000 and 5 years in
prison.
The varying picture bright
ness means that he actually
copied the movie from a video
tape that was encoded with a
copy-deterring system known
as Macrovision.
Although he was sly enough
not to copy the FBI warning at
the beginning of the tape, this
oscillation gives him away as a
felon.
A Macrovision-encoded tape
contains extra video signals
which are barely noticeable
when played directly (and
legally).
However, when such a tape
is copied with a second VCR,
the extra signals cause
increased video distortion on
the copied tape. This extra dis
tortion is quite noticeable in
the picture brightness when
played from a pirated copy.
Scrambled cable signals
have a much more effective
form of deterrence.
American and Japanese TV
sets receive the video and audio
signals in a format known as
NTSC, which contains all of
the information on how to
reconstruct a picture and
soundtrack. Present in this for
mat are synchronizing pulses
which keep the picture steady
The cable company alters
these "sync" pulses so that
unauthorized reception results
in a rather confused television
set. Cable companies rent out
descrambler boxes to their sub
scribers which are able to deci
pher the scrambled video sig
nal.
Q.Can eating candy cause
• diabetes ?
A.Here at Science Bug
• Research Park, we
decided to do the experiment
ourselves with the method

used to test saccharin. We went
to the Price Club, bought a case
of candy bars and ordered our
experimental subjects to eat
them all in one day.
Unfortunately, they turned
green and mutinied after only a
few hours — they just couldn't
handle the rigors of scientific
research.
We then abandoned the
experimental approach and
called Dr. Frederic Kraemer of
Palo Alto, who told us that you
need not fear Snickers any
more.
The short answer is that
candy bars alone will not give
you diabetes.
The long answer is that the
mtyority of diabetics have type
II or non-insulin-dependent
diabetes. This is thought to be
caused by a combination of
genetic predisposition and diet
and exercise habits.
So if you have a family his
tory of type II diabetes, and
you have a high caloric intake
with little exercise, you are
more likely to develop the dis
ease.
Although diabetes results in
dangerously fluctuating blood
sugar levels, it is not sugar
alone which influences diabetic
tendencies.
So eating two grease-soaked
Tresidder burritos every day
and taking tanning instead of
aerobics can be far more haz
ardous than the four candy
bars you ate while cramming
for midterms last night.
