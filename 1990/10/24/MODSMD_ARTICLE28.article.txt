# Jasper Ridge: antidote for civilization?
## 
### Monica Uddin 
If you're looking for an escape
from the hectic pace of midterms,
papers and problem sets, a trip to
Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve may be just what you
need.
Located just a short 20 minute
bike ride from campus, the pre
serve is the perfect spot to get
back to nature before confronting
the harsher realities of academic
life.
Nestled near the base of a gen
tly rolling hill, the main gate wel
comes you into an open-air labora
tory of gigantic proportions: over
1200 acres of natural landscape
are enclosed for protection and
preservation.
One of the mqjor attractions of
Jasper Ridge is Searsville Lake.
This century-old, man-made lake
served as a popular watering hole
for the surrounding area until
Stanford bought out its lease in
1975.
On one end of the lake lies a
dam which is "built like a jigsaw,"
according to Monica Bjorkman,
the program director for the pre
serve. The concrete was poured on
site and this accounts for its inter
locking appearance.
On the other end, under the
dark, murky water, lies the San
Andreas Fault. Interestingly,
though, the dam suffered minimal
damage in both the 1906 and 1989
earthquakes.
Although Jasper Ridge is com
mitted to preserving the environ
ment without relying on outside
resources, Searsville Lake is the
one exception to this rule.
For many years now, the algae
like plant myriophyllium has been
covering the lake with a carpet of
green. The spread of the plant,
which originates in Brazil, was
probably the result of an aquar
ium emptied into the pond. The
California climate proved perfect
for its growth.
"It would cover the whole lake
in a year if we didn't do anything,"
said Bjorkman. As a result, care
takers have been forced to con
duct a twice-yearly, "floating har
vest" of the plant, the remains of
which are composted on the pre

serve.
From the little-known Western
Bluebird to the more familiar Cal
ifornian Redwood, the preserve
contains a wide variety of animals
and plants, and features most of
the terrain typical of the Santa
Cruz area.
This diversity makes Jasper
Ridge an ideal site for biological
and environmental research,
judging from the nearly 100 doc
toral theses inspired by the area
since 1897.
But biology is not the only con
cern at Jasper Ridge. The area has
proven to be a valuable resource
in anthropological studies as well.
Because Native Americans used to
travel along San Francisquito
Creek, researchers have found
Indian village sites and burial
areas on the preserve.
Geologists have also found
material of interest in the natu
rally-occurring sandstone caves of

the preserve's rocky area.
Jasper Ridge has not always
been such a natural Utopia. There
was "an enormous commitment
[in] setting it aside," said Bjork
man. Up until 1973, when Jasper
Ridge was designated an actual
preserve, the area's increasing
popularity with local residents
threatened to destroy its potential
as a research resource.
In addition, attempts had been
made in the early '60s to intro
duce a dam into San Francisquito
Creek that would have perma
nently destroyed the preserve's
redwood population.
This attempt was thwarted by
Donald Kennedy (then chairman
of the Department of Biological
Sciences), who in 1968 led a suc
cessful effort to secure direct aca
demic control over Jasper Ridge
and the adjacent Searsville Lake.
Five years later, trustees for
malized the preserve's status, and

Stanford is now the only Ameri
can university that enjoys such a
resource.
Apart from the academic world
of research, Jasper Ridge has sev
eral close, but relatively
unknown, ties to the Stanford
community. The preserve is
patrolled by Stanford students,
who serve as rangers to prevent
trespassing.
A greater number of students
also work as docents, or tour
guides, after being trained under
Bjorkman for two consecutive
quarters for academic credit.
Free tours for members of the
Stanford community are con
ducted each Saturday morning at
10 a.m., but dorms and other
large groups can call to arrange an
alternate time if necessary.
These tours are designed to
acquaint interested parties with
one of Stanford's best-kept
secrets.

Searsvllle Lake, which used to be a popular local swimming-hole, Is now Incorporated Into Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. The preserve's 1,200 acres of landscape are set aside for environmental preserva
tion and biological research, and are allowed to evolve without outside Intervention.
