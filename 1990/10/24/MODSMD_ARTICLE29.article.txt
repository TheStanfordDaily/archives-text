# Apple 'Macsimizes' market: introduces cheaper computers
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Once upon a time, the Macintosh was unique.
With its mouse and graphical interface, Apple pos
sessed an ease-of-use advantage that eventually
became the envy of all its competitors. That advan
tage allowed the Cupertino-based firm to charge a
premium price for its computers.
As the years passed, the gap between what the
Mac could do and what its DOS-based competition
was capable of began to narrow. While Macintosh
users knew their machines were still superior, other
key players — computer purchasers and software
developers — were not as sure.
Relative to other computers, orders for the Mac
intosh began to slip.
A product which once claimed a 15 percent share
of the PC market, now held just nine. Adobe, Aldus,
Farallon, et al., companies who made their fortunes
writing software for the Mac, began to rewrite their
programs to run on IBM PC-compatibles — the most
common office computers.
Apple figured that in order to survive in the long
run, it needed to make the Macintosh more übiqui
tous. To do that, the company would have to either
cut the prices of existing machines or introduce new,
lower-cost computers.
That kind of strategy runs directly counter to
Apple's traditional approach of exacting a premium
price and making a significant profit on each com
puter sold.
Nevertheless, it is exactly what Chairman John
Sculley and Chief Operating Officer Michael
Spindler decided to do. On Oct. 15, Apple introduced
the Macintosh Classic, LC and Ilsi with the inten
tion of selling a lot of them over the next couple of

years.
That's all well and
good for Apple. For the
user, however, the most
important question
remains: "Which one
should you buy?" As
always, the answer
depends on what you'll
be using your computer
for.

If you're the typical undergraduate — working
under a tight budget, wanting the computer to write
papers — Apple is courting you with the Classic.
When the original Macintosh came out with 128K
of memory and no hard drive available, many of you
snapped it up by the truckload. And you paid over
$2,000 for it — three times the price of entry-level
classic, which comes in at a cool $747.
For just $373 more, Apple will throw in a second
megabyte of memory and a 40 meg hard disk. The
so-called Classic HD4O/2 costs just a dollar more
than an SE equipped with half the memory and half
the hard disk space.
The performance of the Classic is identical to that
of the SE. In other words, it can bog down at times,
but for basic operations it's all the typical student
needs. If you get the extra memory, you'll be ready to
run System 7 — Apple's next generation of the oper
ating system — when it becomes available next year.
Those in the market for high performance, and
possessing somewhat fatter wallets, should take a
close look at the Ilsi. For under $2,500, the machine
sports a faster processor than the Ilex — which like
the SE is no longer being manufactured — and the
ability to drive most Apple monitors without a video
card. That's important because the Ilsi has only one

internal slot instead of the three available in the Ilex
or Ilsi.
As a technical aside, the 68030 chip in the Ilsi
runs at 20 megahertz, halfway between the 16 MHz
speed of the SE/30 and the 25 MHz of the lid. But,
in certain applications, the Ilsi will not even perform
as well as the SE/30. The reason is that all of Apple's
previous 68030 machines included a math coproces
sor chip which speeds up calculations many times.
While spreadsheets are the most obvious benefi
ciary of the math chip's abilities, Postscript graphics
software like Adobe's Illustrator and Type Manager
and Aldus' Freehand also get a big boost from its
number-crunching prowess.
Fortunately, you can add the math coprocessor for
just $171. In so doing, though, you must make a
choice. You see, the math chip comes on one of
Apple's slot adapters — devices that go inside your
Ilsi and determine which kind of card you'll be able
to use.
Your adapter can let you use a card designed for
the Mac ll's Nubus slots or for the SE/30's processor
direct slot. There are a lot more Nubus cards out
there, but more SE/30 compatible products are
becoming available all the time.
Incidentally, with either adapter, you'll have a
screamer of a machine that will satisfy all but the

most power hungry of users.
Meanwhile, if the only thing you ever want to
plug in to the Ilsi is an Apple monitor with a diago
nal of less than 15 inches, you won't need any cards
at all. Like the Ilci, the Ilsi has a port in the back
that allows the display to be plugged in directly.
You can get a bare bones black and white monitor
for $189. Apple's new low-cost, 12-inch color display
is just twice that at $378. While that may seem like
a great deal, be forewarned. Though the new display
is physically larger than the 9-inch one built into the
compact Macs, it displayed barely any more infor
mation.
The reason is that the pixels, the individual ele
ments that make up the picture, are much larger
than they other on Apple's other displays. The 12-
inch monitor has just 12 percent more pixels than
the 9-inch one. If you're considering a purchase,
take a long hard look at the new monitor — or better
yet, buy your computer soon.
Through the end of the year, when you purchase
a new Ilsi, you can pick up the 13-inch high resolu
tion color display, a truly sensational product, for
$379. (Note that one-dollar differential again.) The
larger monitor displays about a third more informa
tion and has magnificent color fidelity.
All in all, the Ilsi represents superior value for the
price. It brings near-llci performance to a much
wider audience.
The introduction causing the most furor, though,
is that of the LC. Many feel it's the key to Apple's
strategy, others feel it's a stillborn dog. Most impor
tantly, it won't be available until the beginning of
1991.
A closer look at the LC and what the new low-cost
Macs mean for Apple's future will appear in next
week's column.
