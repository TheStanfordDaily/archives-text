# Associate Prof. Bird finds adventure in Arctic Circle

For nine months each year, Dennis
Bird stands in front of crowded class
rooms and just lectures about the
earth's wonders.
But in the summer, the 41-year-old
bespectacled teacher trades his pedagog
ical ways for a parka and a shotgun and
traipses off to the frozen reaches of
Greenland to unearth rocks, gold and
adventure.
"There is nothing quite like going
North," the pony-tailed Bird said. "Once
you have gone, you have to go back
because it is such an amazing experi
ence."
Since 1981, Bird, an associate profes
sor of geology, has returned to Green
land nine times to study the phe
nomenon of rifling — the breakup of
continents and the creation of ocean

basins — and the role of ground water in
this process.
By studying the minerals and frac
tures in Greenland'b rocks, Bird can
determine how underground water
transports heat and minerals during the
formation of land masses.
Among other applications, this
knowledge can help miners target poten
tial areas for extracting ores, said Bird,
who on several occasions has acted as a
consultant for a Canadian mining com
pany in Greenland.
Surveying rocks 300 miles north of
the Arctic Circle may seem daunting to
the heartiest of researchers. But Bird is
quick to point out that it is more than
just a job.
"I ei\joy going to places where people
have not been before or where few peo
ple have ever been,"he said.
