# Associate Prof. Bird finds adventure in Arctic Circle
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
For nine months each year, Dennis
Bird stands in front of crowded class
rooms and just lectures about the
earth's wonders.
But in the summer, the 41-year-old
bespectacled teacher trades his pedagog
ical ways for a parka and a shotgun and
traipses off to the frozen reaches of
Greenland to unearth rocks, gold and
adventure.
"There is nothing quite like going
North," the pony-tailed Bird said. "Once
you have gone, you have to go back
because it is such an amazing experi
ence."
Since 1981, Bird, an associate profes
sor of geology, has returned to Green
land nine times to study the phe
nomenon of rifling — the breakup of
continents and the creation of ocean

basins — and the role of ground water in
this process.
By studying the minerals and frac
tures in Greenland'b rocks, Bird can
determine how underground water
transports heat and minerals during the
formation of land masses.
Among other applications, this
knowledge can help miners target poten
tial areas for extracting ores, said Bird,
who on several occasions has acted as a
consultant for a Canadian mining com
pany in Greenland.
Surveying rocks 300 miles north of
the Arctic Circle may seem daunting to
the heartiest of researchers. But Bird is
quick to point out that it is more than
just a job.
"I ei\joy going to places where people
have not been before or where few peo
ple have ever been,"he said.
When he's not chipping away at
rocks, Bird the professor becomes
Bird the prospector, searching
glacial drifts and alpine woods for
precious metal ores. He has yet to
uncover a trove of gold deposits.
But other episodes on the tun
dra have kept Stanford's wayfar
ing geologist busy.
During an expedition to Green
land several years ago, Bird and
his colleagues were forced to tra
verse an unstable summit ridge
one meter wide and more than a
kilometer long.
"At one point I was so scared I
decided to get down and straddle
over the edge," Bird recalled from
the safer environment of his office
in the School of Earth Sciences.
"We did it without rope, which
probably wasn't the wisest thing
to do."
In another Greenland adven
ture four years ago, a polar bear
and its cub ambled into the camp
site of Bird's research group.
After holing up in tents for 14
hours, Bird and the expedition
evacuated the grounds.
"It was real frightening. Any
time there is a bear near [a site],
that is a hungry bear and any
thing that moves is food," Bird
explained matter-of-factly.
"I have had my share of polar
bears," he added.
Whether it's crossing unpre
dictable snow bridges or hauling
sleds over frozen sea ice, Bird has
tackled the formidable challenges
of the hinterland.
But nothing could prepare him
for the calamity he faced in the
summer of 1989.
Bird had set down alone on the
island of Patulcy'ivit, a rock ridge
jutting out of the ocean 100 miles
from his base camp.
What was supposed to be a
four-day trip to examine Gabbros,
a type of rock found on the island,
turned into a 19-day ordeal as a
series of snow storms made it

impossible for a helicopter to pick
him up.
Bird was forced to ration his
dwindling food and fuel supplies.
"By the 12th day I was crumbling
granola into a bowl of powdered
milk and adding hot water," he
said.
Bird communicated with the
base camp by radio and to pass
time he dictated messages to his
daughters and field notes into a
micro-cassette recorder.
In one taped entry, his voice,
competing with the sounds of
howling winds and pelting rain on
the tent, crackled, "The wind is
really beginning to pick up again.
It must be 30 to 40 knots out
there. I'm sitting with my back
against a barricade pushing the
walls of the tent, trying to keep
them up. Things are looking

pretty serious."
The following day the weather
cleared and Bird was rescued.
Reflecting on that incident more
than a year later, Bird said he
never felt concerned for his life.
"You don't have the option of
panicking," he said. "It doesn't
get you anywhere. I just had to
stay calm, relaxed and take it in
stride."
Life has taught Bird to take
many other challenges in stride.
While he was an undergradu
ate at UC-Riverside, Bird scaled
the face of El Capitan in Yosemite.
After three days and nights of
scaling, he made the nearly mile
high ascent. "Climbing that verti
cal desert was a lot of fun," he
said, grinning.
Later, during a field trip to
Nevada to map out rock forma

tions, he encountered a mountain
lion.
"The lion looked at me. Then it
pounced. I just saw two paws com
ing at my head," Bird said. Both
Bird and the lion went tumbling
down a 20-foot embankment. He
was saved when a friend chased
the lion away by throwing rocks at
it. Although bloodied, Bird suf
fered no permanent injuries.
After teaching more classes
this year, he plans to return to
Greenland in the spring for a sled
ding expedition.
"All my life I wanted to go out
and climb mountains and have
adventures," he said.
"I'm studying and teaching
about the earth and getting paid
for it. That's great. My adven
tures just add spice to an already
very interesting science," he said.

Assoc. Geology Prof. Dennis Bird, on one of his many adventurous trips to the Arctic Circle, endured 19
freezing days, 15 more than he had planned, on the island of Patulajivit after a series of snow storms
made It impossible for a helicopter to pick him up.
