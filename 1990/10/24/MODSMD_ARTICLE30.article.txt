## Green not just a head coach 
### 
A 8 I walked from my car to Stanford Sta
dium for a Cardinal football game early
this season, I was thinking offhand
about how cool it is that our team is coached by
Dennis Green, a black man.
I know that doesn't sound too profound or
anything, but it's true. It shouldn't be taken
the wrong way, as statements at this school
sometimes are. It's just that I'm proud of this
school and its athletic department because I
think Green's position shows that, in a sense,
we practice what we preach.
You might remember last year, when there
was a lot of publicity over the new head coach
of the Los Angeles Raiders, Art Shell. This
extra attention was due solely to the fact that
Shell is black, the first black head coach in the
modern era of the NFL (i.e., since the Super
bowl began). While Shell's hiring was a positive
thing, it was also a sad commentary on the his
torical racism of big-time sports.
Turn on any NBA game these days and you
are liable to see 10 black players out on the
floor. To many this seems quite ordinary, but as
little as 25 years ago it would have been a
downright impossibility. Not only were there
fewer black players in the league, but there
were also unwritten rules that limited the
number of blacks that could play at one time.

It was a similar unwritten rule that Branch
Rickey violated by signing Jackie Robinson to a
major league baseball contract in the late
19305. Robinson is famous for breaking the
"color barrier" that had consigned great play
ers such as Josh Gibson and Satchell Page to
the obscurity of the Negro Leagues.
Today such rules seem ridiculous, and cur
rent rosters in the big sports bear this out.
Black athletes are finally being recognized for
their remarkable abilities and are being signed
to contracts reflecting these skills. But, as A 1
Campania* racist comments of a few years ago
showed, the ranks of managers and executives
are quite a different story.
There are only two black managers in major
league baseball. The same situation is true in
basketball, and it may be a number of years
before Shell has a black brother in the frater
nity of NFL head coaches. The front office pic
ture is pretty much the same. While it is impos
sible to ignore the great athletic talents that
black athletes possess, apparently it is much
easier to dismiss those black people when more
subjective qualities are being measured.
While all the examples I have given above
are from pro sports, I believe that the situation
is not much different in college sports on the
whole. Especially at the bigger programs, the
number of blacks in head coaching jobs is very
low. Green is currently the only black head
football coach in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Yet, despite all this, when Green was named
head coach at Stanford after the 1988 season,
there wasn't a lot of hype. It was as if everyone
was afraid of noting that Green is black, and
therefore unique. True, Green had been at
Stanford as an assistant twice before. The fir
ing of Jack Elway, a surprise to many, also pre
occupied much of the media.
But I think it is important to take a belated
moment and notice, and to celebrate, just how
significant Dennis Green is. Not just to the
Cardinal team, but to Stanford as a whole, and
for Black Americans everywhere.
First, it should be noted that Green was not
hired because he is black. This was no affirma
tive-action type choice. Green was hired
because of his previous work at Stanford, his
experience coaching at a big-time program
with top-notch academics (Northwestern, 1981
to 1985), and his overall qualifications as an
excellent football coach (which includes stints
as a pro assistant). The fact that Green is black
is more properly viewed as a bonus.
Why a bonus? Because Stanford is a school
that prides itself on its diversity, and Green is a
concrete example of this attitude. What's
more, he is a highly visible symbol. When
Green appears on television three or four Sat
urdays each fall, Cardinal baseball cap on his
head, it sends a direct message to millions of
people tuning in.
The message is this: Stanford really is a dif
ferent place, where equality and fair treatment
are valued. For many who view this place as a
bastion for rich white people, this image alone
might cause them to change their perception.
It certainly doesn't hurt the school's image,
anyways.
For the Cardinal football team, Green
brings an even more palpable contribution. His
hiring had an almost immediate impact, as
Stanford pulled off several recruiting coups
and ended up with one of the top 15 recruiting
classes in the country. Green's energy and "can
do" attitude that can convince even the most
doubtful blue chip prospect that he can play
football on New Year's Day wearing a Cardinal
jersey.
The fact that Green is black no doubt has a
positive impact on recruiting. Many of the top
nigh school players are black, and it cannot but
be positive to find someone with a similar
racial background on the other end of the
recruiting process. It is general knowledge that
Stanford's pre-season All America tackle,
sophomore Bob Whitfield, was not that inter
ested in Stanford until Green was hired. He
signed shortly thereafter, and brought with
him other quality players.
Green is a great example to young black
