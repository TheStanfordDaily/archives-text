# Gridders need to stop Musgrave, start run
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
If you beliove previous actions
are omens, then Stanford is in for
an upset this weekend.
For only the second time this
season, the squad watched game
film of its previous year's contest
Sunday, not the past game as
usual. Instead of reviewing the
debacle at Stanford stadium, the
Cardinal watched itself overcome
a 17 point deficit to upset the
Ducks 18-17 last October.
The other time this ocurred?
Before Notre Dame.
The result?
A 36-31 Stanford victory.
"There was no need to watch
the game film against Washing
ton; there's nothing we can gain,"
said running back Glyn Milburn.
"It was important to watch [last
year's game against] Oregon bea
cause it showed a lot of character
to come back."
"We know we can move the ball
against them because they have
the same style, the same defensive
personnel."
The best thing Stanford can do
is totally forget about last Satur
day's humiliation. And start
thinking about how it upset Notre
Dame.
There was definitley something
missing from the team that
defeated the No. 1 Fighting Irish,
that came within 12 seconds of
upsetting Colorado. The Cardinal
needs to get it back. And fast. Ore
gon, while only 1-2 and tied for
seventh in the Pacific 10 confer
ence, is 5-2 overall. It upset BYU.
It's the conference leader in total
offense.
"We hit a bus last weekend and
played our worst half of football,"
said coach Denny Green. "[But] I
think the atmosphere is going to
be conducive to playing a good
game. We've responded well
before in these type of situations.
We are disappointed in the way
we've played, and we understand
what to do about it."
"We need to take what we

gained from Notre Dame and try
and block out what happened the
past two weeks," Milburn said.
"We want to go to Eugene and
show the world what Stanford is
all about."
Now Stanford just needs to get
it done.
Oregon is by no means a given.
For the seventh time in eight
weeks, the 2-5 Cardinal is the
underdog. And for good reason.
Oregon is hot on track to get a
second-consecutive bowl bid for
the first time ever. Behind the
steady arm of Bill Musgrave, the
Ducks are compiling yard after
yard, touchdown after touch
down. Oregon is first in the Pac
-10 in passing offense, first in total
offense with a 420-yard per game
average, and first in scoring
offense. Not many teams have
been able to stop the Heisman
Trophy candidate.
He's broken every Oregon
record there is in passing and total
offense, and is second in the Pac
-10 books only to John Elway in
touchdown passes.
Stanford is last in pass
defense.
"Musgrave is the best quarter
back in the Pac-10. We have to
stop the pass," cornerback Kevin
Scott said. "It's going to be a chal
lenge. We (the secondary) need to
finally have a game where every
thing comes together."
The whole squad needs a game
where everything comes together.
Not only do the Ducks have the
most potent signal caller the Car
dinal has faced this season, it has
a remarkably balanced offense.
Oregon is actually averaging over
160 yards a game on the ground.
But wait. There's more.
The Ducks are also highly com
pentent defensively. They can
shut down the run. And break up
the pass.
Stanford is defintley going to
have to be with it come Saturday.
"With all the talk of them
throwing the ball, they have a

very good rush defense," Green
said. "They put a lot of pressure
on people and force them to throw.
They also have the best nickel
pass defense in the conference.

The key, therefore, is the run.
Everyone knows Jason
Palumbis can throw, but if that's
the only offensive production
Stanford can get, its going to be a
long afternoon for the third week
in a row.
"They're aggressive but we can
run the ball on them if we execute
what we have to do."
