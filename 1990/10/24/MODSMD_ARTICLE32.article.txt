# Freshman Bercutt has battled for starting spot
## 
### David Schwartz Staff writer 
"Save by Larry Bercutt." That sen
tence has become a familiar one at
deGuerre Pool. Freshman Larry
Bercutt has laid claim to the starting
goalie position on Stanford's water
polo team. It is very rare for a fresh
man to be starting in goal for one of
the top teams in the nation, but this is
no ordinary freshman. This is Larry
Bercutt.
A native of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
Bercutt was considered to be the
nation's top goalie in high school water
polo last year. He attended the presti
gious Harvard School in North Holly
wood, Calif. He was a member of Har
vard's varsity water polo team for all
four years of high school. Bercutt
started for the team beginning in his
sophomore year. He led the Saracens
to a CIF 2A championship his junior
season and was named CIF 2A Player
of the Year. He also played goalie for
the U.S. Junior National Team.

Needless to say, he had an
extremely accomplished high school
career, and as a result was recruited by
the best programs in the nation. But
Bercutt was also the epitome of a
scholar-athlete in high school, ranking
one-tenth of a point away from being
valedictorian at Harvard. For Bercutt,
the choice was simple: a top Division I
water polo program that plays against
stiff Pacific 10 Conference competition
plus world-class academics equals
Stanford. Decision final.
But even though he was highly
recruited, Bercutt knew that winning
the starting goalie spot as a freshman
wouldn't be easy. Two obstacles stood
in his way: one, a junior returnee at
goalie, and two, the huge adjustment
that must be made in order to play on
the college level.
As a freshman, Bercutt knew that it
would be difficult to beat out the
upperclassman, Jim Cairns. But Coach
Dante Dettamanti gave him an equal
chance at the job, and Bercutt took
advantage of that. Dettamanti stated,
"I wanted to give both goalies an equal

chance, [and] I wanted [theml to earn
[the position], The first part of the sea
son I played them both equally, either
half-and-half each game or one goalie
would play one game and the other the
next game. I recruited Larry to play,
and I was hoping that he would
become our starter, but I wasn't going
to just hand it to him.
"I also felt obligated to Jim. This is
his third year, and he's played behind
(June graduate) Todd Kemp for two
years. Jim played for us all last spring
and all summer, and I told [him] that it
was his job to lose. Jim is a good goalie,
but Larry just beat him out. I gave
them equal chances, and Larry just
kept getting better and better and Jim
stayed about the same."
Bercutt recognizes the hard work
that he has had to undergo to crack the
starting line-up. He says,"I think I've
come a long way and I still have a long
way to go. Part of the amount I've
learned is how to play with this team
and how to play as a team, because in
college you have to play as a team. Cer
tain things are expected of you, and

other things you just have to forget
about and expect the team to take
away for you.
"Its not like high school, where you
take care of the goal, wait for the
defense to screw up, and you solve
their problems. The defense has got to
do their job in college, and you just
have a more specific role. You can't
screw up. I think that I'm learning
that, I still have to learn that, but I
think Dante, Ben and the other
coaches have really come a long way in
helping me on that."
A main difference that Bercutt sees
between the high school and college
levels of water polo is the talent pool.
He said, "I think [a big! a4justment for
me was having to play against teams
with six good players at once. In high
school, there are usually a few players
who don't know what they are doing,
but at the college level, all the players
in the water are very talented."
Bercutt is beginning to show the
signs of brilliance that made him such
a dominating force in high school and
is elevating his skills to play against
NCAA competition. Bercutt is an
excellent passer out of the goal, and he
has a total of 91 saves for the season,
including 18 against No. 2 ranked
UCLA last Friday. Bercutt's play, espe
cially in the fourth quarter and the five
overtime periods, greatly contributed
to the Cardinal's 10-9 sudden-death
victory over the Bruins. The game
didn't get off to a great start for
Bercutt, as UCLA scored almost half
their goals in the first quarter, leading
4-2 at the end of that period.
After the game, Bercutt said, "This
game was very mentally stressing,
because I didn't come out to a very
good start, and then I had to put the
first quarter behind me and go ahead
and try and rebound from that."
Dettamanti analyzed his goal
keeper's game as follows: "Larry had
freshman jitters in the first quarter,
and he was definitely struggling. He
allowed four goals to go in in the first
quarter. Partly it was his fault and
partly the defense. Then he really set
tled down, the team settled down, and
Larry had a great game after that. He
had 17-18 saves, and that's a lot. Last
time we played UCLA, he had four
saves, maybe five, and the other goalie
had 17 or 18 saves.
"Our defense was the key in this
game. Larry played great in 6-on-5
defense and front-court offense. He
made a lot of blocks. If you look at the
stats, he had one save in the first quar
ter, four in the second, three in the
third, and eight in the fourth and over
time periods, so all of his saves except
for one were after the first period. He
really did settle down and 1 was very
pleased with the way he played. That's
why we recruited him, and that's why
we gave him a scholarship. He's really
come through for us."

Recruited at the top high school goalie In the nation last year, Larry Bercutt has ad|usted to Pac-10 play and won the
starting position for the Cardinal. Bercutt figures to be a key factor In Stanford's pursuit of a seventh national title.
When asked if Friday's game
was one of his biggest, Bercutt
responded, "This game was defi
nitely one of the more important
games I've played in. It really put
a lot of pressure on me, and the
team really demanded a lot from
me in this game, especially in the
overtime periods."
As evidenced by his perfor
mances in big games, Larry
Bercutt has risen to the challenge
of adjusting to college water polo
and has an extremely bright
future. The next time you hear
"Save by Larry Bercutt," don't be
surprised — expect it, for until
1994, Stanford's goal belongs to
him.

kept getting better and better and Jim
stayed about the same."
Bercutt recognizes the hard work
that he has had to undergo to crack the
starting line-up. He says,"I think I've
come a long way and I still have a long
way to go. Part of the amount I've
learned is how to play with this team
and how to play as a team, because in
college you have to play as a team. Cer
tain things are expected of you, and

other things you just have to forget
about and expect the team to take
away for you.
"Its not like high school, where you
take care of the goal, wait for the
defense to screw up, and you solve
their problems. The defense has got to
do their job in college, and you just
have a more specific role. You can't
screw up. I think that I'm learning
that, I still have to learn that, but I
think Dante, Ben and the other
coaches have really come a long way in
helping me on that."
A main difference that Bercutt sees
between the high school and college
levels of water polo is the talent pool.
He said, "I think [a big! a4justment for
me was having to play against teams
with six good players at once. In high
school, there are usually a few players
who don't know what they are doing,
but at the college level, all the players
in the water are very talented."
Bercutt is beginning to show the
signs of brilliance that made him such
a dominating force in high school and
is elevating his skills to play against
NCAA competition. Bercutt is an
excellent passer out of the goal, and he
has a total of 91 saves for the season,
including 18 against No. 2 ranked
UCLA last Friday. Bercutt's play, espe
cially in the fourth quarter and the five
overtime periods, greatly contributed
to the Cardinal's 10-9 sudden-death
victory over the Bruins. The game
didn't get off to a great start for
Bercutt, as UCLA scored almost half
their goals in the first quarter, leading
4-2 at the end of that period.
After the game, Bercutt said, "This
game was very mentally stressing,
because I didn't come out to a very
good start, and then I had to put the
first quarter behind me and go ahead
and try and rebound from that."
Dettamanti analyzed his goal
keeper's game as follows: "Larry had
freshman jitters in the first quarter,
and he was definitely struggling. He
allowed four goals to go in in the first
quarter. Partly it was his fault and
partly the defense. Then he really set
tled down, the team settled down, and
Larry had a great game after that. He
had 17-18 saves, and that's a lot. Last
time we played UCLA, he had four
saves, maybe five, and the other goalie
had 17 or 18 saves.
"Our defense was the key in this
game. Larry played great in 6-on-5
defense and front-court offense. He
made a lot of blocks. If you look at the
stats, he had one save in the first quar
ter, four in the second, three in the
third, and eight in the fourth and over
time periods, so all of his saves except
for one were after the first period. He
really did settle down and 1 was very
pleased with the way he played. That's
why we recruited him, and that's why
we gave him a scholarship. He's really
come through for us."

Recruited at the top high school goalie In the nation last year, Larry Bercutt has ad|usted to Pac-10 play and won the
starting position for the Cardinal. Bercutt figures to be a key factor In Stanford's pursuit of a seventh national title.
When asked if Friday's game
was one of his biggest, Bercutt
responded, "This game was defi
nitely one of the more important
games I've played in. It really put
a lot of pressure on me, and the
team really demanded a lot from
me in this game, especially in the
overtime periods."
As evidenced by his perfor
mances in big games, Larry
Bercutt has risen to the challenge
of adjusting to college water polo
and has an extremely bright
future. The next time you hear
"Save by Larry Bercutt," don't be
surprised — expect it, for until
1994, Stanford's goal belongs to
him.
"Save by Larry Bercutt." That sen
tence has become a familiar one at
deGuerre Pool. Freshman Larry
Bercutt has laid claim to the starting
goalie position on Stanford's water
polo team. It is very rare for a fresh
man to be starting in goal for one of
the top teams in the nation, but this is
no ordinary freshman. This is Larry
Bercutt.
A native of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
Bercutt was considered to be the
nation's top goalie in high school water
polo last year. He attended the presti
gious Harvard School in North Holly
wood, Calif. He was a member of Har
vard's varsity water polo team for all
four years of high school. Bercutt
started for the team beginning in his
sophomore year. He led the Saracens
to a CIF 2A championship his junior
season and was named CIF 2A Player
of the Year. He also played goalie for
the U.S. Junior National Team.

Needless to say, he had an
extremely accomplished high school
career, and as a result was recruited by
the best programs in the nation. But
Bercutt was also the epitome of a
scholar-athlete in high school, ranking
one-tenth of a point away from being
valedictorian at Harvard. For Bercutt,
the choice was simple: a top Division I
water polo program that plays against
stiff Pacific 10 Conference competition
plus world-class academics equals
Stanford. Decision final.
But even though he was highly
recruited, Bercutt knew that winning
the starting goalie spot as a freshman
wouldn't be easy. Two obstacles stood
in his way: one, a junior returnee at
goalie, and two, the huge adjustment
that must be made in order to play on
the college level.
As a freshman, Bercutt knew that it
would be difficult to beat out the
upperclassman, Jim Cairns. But Coach
Dante Dettamanti gave him an equal
chance at the job, and Bercutt took
advantage of that. Dettamanti stated,
"I wanted to give both goalies an equal

chance, [and] I wanted [theml to earn
[the position], The first part of the sea
son I played them both equally, either
half-and-half each game or one goalie
would play one game and the other the
next game. I recruited Larry to play,
and I was hoping that he would
become our starter, but I wasn't going
to just hand it to him.
"I also felt obligated to Jim. This is
his third year, and he's played behind
(June graduate) Todd Kemp for two
years. Jim played for us all last spring
and all summer, and I told [him] that it
was his job to lose. Jim is a good goalie,
but Larry just beat him out. I gave
them equal chances, and Larry just
kept getting better and better and Jim
stayed about the same."
