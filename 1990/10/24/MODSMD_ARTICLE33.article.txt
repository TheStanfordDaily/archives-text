# Sailing dominates regatta
## 
### Deborah Claymon 
If you were wondering what the future brings,
the Stanford Sailing Team saw its future secured
by the team's overwhelming command of this
weekend's Frosh/Soph regatta. Despite extremely
light winds at Redwood City, Stanford dominated
on home waters, taking first through fourth in
the fleet.
The top of the fleet this weekend was undeni
ably Cardinal red. sophomore Brady Sih and
senior co-captain Matt Dunbar blew past the rest,
garnering an impressive seven bullets out of the
twelve races. Sih and Dunbar clearly had control
of the regatta from the outset.
Into the second day, Dunbar commented that
"despite the disappointing lack of wind, we are
able to maintain great boat speed." Sih, involved
in an Olympic campaign for 1992 in 470's, defi
nitely ranks among Stanford's top skippers, and
may lead the team competitively for the next
three seasons.
Freshman Jeremy Mclntyre and sophomore
Geoff Mac Donald rivaled Sih/Dunbar for the top
position, finishing second. Sophomore Rusty Lha

mon and freshman Kristin Sidell moved up from
fifth on Saturday to take third. Merely three
points behind, freshman Scott Sellers and junior
Andi Guerrero battled with the top of the fleet to
a close fourth and finish out the impressive
Stanford lead.
In addition, Haley King and Marina Kimball,
and Leo Sommaripa and Holly Miller sailed
strongly, taking seventh and eighth respectively.
King and Kimball narrowly missed sixth by a one
point difference, and Sommaripa and Miller fol
lowed suit, one point from King.
"Light air kept the top of the fleet competitive
and tightly packed. Being able to make the small
changes and read minor wind shifts made all the
difference on the water," said Lhamon.
This sweeping victory emphasizes the Stan
ford Bailing squad's depth this season and for the
future. The Frosh/Soph regatta is especially
important to allow a competitive fleet among
those new to college sailing. Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton enthusiastically said, "There is
no doubt that this team will be top-ranked [they
are currently No. 11] and continue to take control
on the water."
