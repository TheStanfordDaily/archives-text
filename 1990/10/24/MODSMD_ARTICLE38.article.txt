Electrical Engineering Prof.
Emeritus Hugh Skilling died yes
terday at the age of 8& at his cam
pus home after a long bout with
cancer.
Skilling taught electrical engi
neering for more than 40 years
and was head of the Department
of Electrical Engineering from
1944 to 1964. He also wrote sev
eral influential textbooks which
were used around the world.
According to his longtime col
league, Electrical Engineering
Prof. Emeritus Ralph Smith,
Skilling was skillful at explaining
complex ideas in a simple way and
was meticulous in his use of
words." Skilling hired Smith in
1957.
Although he taught mostly
graduate courses in his early
years, Skilling began to teach
more undergraduate courses in
his later years, Smith said.
Skilling retired in 1971.
Skilling had a important influ
ence on the field of engineering
education, Smith noted. As a
result, a large number of Stanford
graduates in electrical engineer
ing are on the engineering faculty
of other Universities around the
country, he added.
Skilling was an expert on high
voltage power transmission, elec
trical machinery and the funda
mentals of circuits and electro
magnetic fields.
Three of his former students —
Profs. Emeritus William Rambo,
O.G. Villard and William Ayer —
donated funds to build the Hugh
Skilling building in his honor in
1969. The facility is used primar
ily for a cooperative industry-uni

versity instructional television
program.
By the time he retired, Stan
ford's Electrical Engineering
Department had granted more
doctorates than any other school
in the country. During his tenure,
the department grew in size from
a faculty of six with only a few
graduate students to a faculty of
45 with 560 graduate students.
Skilling was born Sept. 2, 1905
in San Diego. He graduated from
Stanford in 1926 and received the
degree of engineer in 1927. He
earned a master's degree in from
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1930. Skilling
returned to Stanford and obtained
his doctorate in 1931.
During World War 11, Skilling
directed electrical-engineering
war research on campus.
He is survived by Hazel, his
wife of 58 years, his daughter and
two grandsons.
