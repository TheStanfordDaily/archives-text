# Domestic Partners policy hotly debated
## 
### Marci Shore 
Two weeks after Stanford
approved its domestic partners
policy, heated discussion of the
issue broke out at Monday
night's forum entitled "Gay, Les
bian, Straight and Bi: All Part of
the Stanford Mix."
Although only a handful of
homosexual couples have
applied for married housing
under the new policy, contro
versy over the recently passed
proposal has been intense and
emotional.
Held in Escondido Village, the
meeting was designed to encour
age dialogue about the new
Domestic Partners policy. Stan
ford is one of the first universi
ties to allow unmarried hetero
sexual and homosexual couples
to apply for what was tradition
ally considered married-student
housing.
The two-hour discussion was
led by Tom Henning, an officer
of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, and Rev.
Herb Schmidt, a Lutheran cam
pus pastor.
Audience members expressed
a wide spectrum of emotions.
Some said they feared the
new University policy denigrates
the institution of marriage.
David Kruger, a married resi
dent and the father of two young

children, said he is vehemently
opposed to the change. He
accused Schmidt, a supporter of
the new policy, of tiying to "pass
himself off as a minister."
Kruger told the group, *1
have a family raised by the word
of Ood. Homosexuality is not
acceptable to me and my family,
and it is something I don't want
my children to be influenced by."
Joel Roberts, one of the
founders of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, replied, "Some people believe
the Koran is the word of God and
they can't tolerate you being a
Christian."
Several participants who, like
Kruger, identified themselves as
conservatives, expressed con
cern that homosexuality may be
contagious, particularly to their
children.
One homosexual man in the
audience countered by saying
that one of every 10 children will
grow up to be gay. Observing
homosexual couples in commit
ted relationships could provide
positive role models for those
children, he noted.
In an interview after the
meeting, one graduate student's
wife, who wished to remain
anonymous, attributed opposi
tion to Domestic Partners
largely to hysteria created by
fundamentalist Christians.

As a mother, she said she
believes it is unfair for parents
to expect that their children will
remain sheltered from homosex
uality. "If you can't [be open] in
a university, how can you expect
to do that in a community?" she
asked. "If you start on one group
of people, who's next? No one is
safe."
A panel of three homosexual
and bisexual Stanford students
answered questions. Stephen
Kasapi, a graduate student in
physics, ana Amy Margolin and
Paul Schmidtberger, both law
students, remained calm and
open amid a crossfire of emotion
from members of the audience.
Some asked how commitment
is defined in a gay relationship;
others questioned why homosex
uality cannot be repressed. One
father likened homosexual feel
ings to the desire to use cocaine,
a temptation which can be com
bated. Henning, in an interview
after the discussion, called the
analogy "incomprehensible and
inhuman."
The integration of homosex
ual couples into heterosexual
housing is having the same
effect as the integration of pubic
schools during the 1950s and
'60s, noted one audience mem
ber.
Henning said the meeting
was a strong step toward bridg

ing the gap between people with
diametrically opposed view
points. He said he hopes the fol
lowing two meetings, "Sexuality,
Religion, and Ethnicity" and
"Domestic Partners, will
become "a little less like putting
people on trial. This is not the
freak show on Donahue."
Jean Kim, Director of Gradu
ate Residences and an original
supporter of the Domestic Part
ners policy, was also optimistic
about the forum. Aware that this
is a highly charged issued, Kim
asserted the need for feelings to
be exposed.
With many incensed and oth
ers bewildered, there exists a
strong need for continued dia
logue, Henning explained.
"There are new neighbors on the
block. [Many are confused
about] who they are, where they
came from."
An international student
from India likened the attitude
of those on the religious right to
that of the Nazis. Some funda
mentalist Christians want to kill
all gays, the student told the
group. "Can gay couples live
next door to people who want to
kill them?" he asked.
Kim encouraged all Stanford
students and residents to attend
the next two parts of the series,
scheduled for Oct. 29 and Nov. 5
at 7:30 p.m.

housing is having the same
effect as the integration of pubic

Henning said the meeting
was a strong step toward bridg

ing the gap between people with
diametrically opposed view
points. He said he hopes the fol
lowing two meetings, "Sexuality,
Religion, and Ethnicity" and
"Domestic Partners, will
become "a little less like putting
people on trial. This is not the
freak show on Donahue."
Jean Kim, Director of Gradu
ate Residences and an original
supporter of the Domestic Part
ners policy, was also optimistic
about the forum. Aware that this
is a highly charged issued, Kim
asserted the need for feelings to
be exposed.
With many incensed and oth
ers bewildered, there exists a
strong need for continued dia
logue, Henning explained.

Two weeks after Stanford
approved its domestic partners
policy, heated discussion of the
issue broke out at Monday
night's forum entitled "Gay, Les
bian, Straight and Bi: All Part of
the Stanford Mix."
Although only a handful of
homosexual couples have
applied for married housing
under the new policy, contro
versy over the recently passed
proposal has been intense and
emotional.
Held in Escondido Village, the
meeting was designed to encour
age dialogue about the new
Domestic Partners policy. Stan
ford is one of the first universi
ties to allow unmarried hetero
sexual and homosexual couples
to apply for what was tradition
ally considered married-student
housing.
The two-hour discussion was
led by Tom Henning, an officer
of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, and Rev.
Herb Schmidt, a Lutheran cam
pus pastor.
Audience members expressed
a wide spectrum of emotions.
Some said they feared the
new University policy denigrates
the institution of marriage.
David Kruger, a married resi
dent and the father of two young

children, said he is vehemently
opposed to the change. He
accused Schmidt, a supporter of
the new policy, of tiying to "pass
himself off as a minister."
Kruger told the group, *1
have a family raised by the word
of Ood. Homosexuality is not
acceptable to me and my family,
and it is something I don't want
my children to be influenced by."
Joel Roberts, one of the
founders of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, replied, "Some people believe
the Koran is the word of God and
they can't tolerate you being a
Christian."
Several participants who, like
Kruger, identified themselves as
conservatives, expressed con
cern that homosexuality may be
contagious, particularly to their
children.
One homosexual man in the
audience countered by saying
that one of every 10 children will
grow up to be gay. Observing
homosexual couples in commit
ted relationships could provide
positive role models for those
children, he noted.
In an interview after the
meeting, one graduate student's
wife, who wished to remain
anonymous, attributed opposi
tion to Domestic Partners
largely to hysteria created by
fundamentalist Christians.

As a mother, she said she
believes it is unfair for parents
to expect that their children will
remain sheltered from homosex
uality. "If you can't [be open] in
a university, how can you expect
to do that in a community?" she
asked. "If you start on one group
of people, who's next? No one is
safe."
A panel of three homosexual
and bisexual Stanford students
answered questions. Stephen
Kasapi, a graduate student in
physics, ana Amy Margolin and
Paul Schmidtberger, both law
students, remained calm and
open amid a crossfire of emotion
from members of the audience.
Some asked how commitment
is defined in a gay relationship;
others questioned why homosex
uality cannot be repressed. One
father likened homosexual feel
ings to the desire to use cocaine,
a temptation which can be com
bated. Henning, in an interview
after the discussion, called the
analogy "incomprehensible and
inhuman."
