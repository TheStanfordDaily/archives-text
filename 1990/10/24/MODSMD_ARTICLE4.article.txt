# Campus leaders to meet at summit
## ASSU hopes diverse communities will unite and learn to work together 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Leadership, multiculturalism and
public service will headline the agenda
of the first-ever ASSU Leadership Sum
mit next month.
Student leaders will meet to discuss
these three issues and the identities and
goals of their individual communities,
as well as to brainstorm ideas on how to
work together in the future.
The summit will be held at Hoover
House, the home of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, the weekend of
Nov. 2. It will bring together about 80
representatives from 17 different cam
pus communities. Up to 20 of them will
be "at large" delegates not representing
a particular community.
"We are recognizing that we are all
part of something larger" than individ
ual groups, said Council of Presidents
member Goodwin Liu, who spearheaded
the ASSU's efforts to get the Leadership
Summit off the ground.

Liu said he hoped one result of the
summit would be shared resources
among different organizations in such
areas as publicity and fund raising. He
said he sees a lack of collaboration on
the campus, because student leaders do
not try to know each other and allow
campus politics to interfere with their
projects.
That problem became apparent to
Liu as a coordinator for last year's You
Can Make a Difference Conference on
education. While planning it, Liu said he
encountered resistance from the ethnic
centers, despite the fact that many of
the conference sessions focused on mul
ticultural issues. "I want to know why,"
he said.
Greg Ricks, multicultural educator
for the Office of Residential Education,
said he is excited about the summit,
which he helped plan. He praised it as
an opportunity for students to "set their
own agenda," rather than feel that mul
ticulturalism was being "run down their
throats," as some students have com

plained in the past.
Ricks said a major goal of the summit
is to encourage students to come up
with agendas for each of what he called
the three major strands in the event â€”
multicultural awareness, the role of
public service in students' lives and stu
dent leadership.
Because there will be a separate, con
current workshop on eacn of these
themes, summit planners invited each
community to send at least three repre
sentatives, Liu said. Because the sizes of
the communities differ, some groups,
such as the Greek community and the
Asian-American community, were allot
ted four or more representatives.
Liu noted summit participants may
represent more than one constituency.
"Many people will wear multiple hats,
which will enhance the richness of the
summit," he said.
The 65 representatives from the des
ignated communities will be appointed
by the communities themselves,
which will submit names to the
COP by Thursday.
Liu also said students who feel
their communities will not be rep
resented can request invitations
from the COP to be at-large rep
resentatives. "We just want to
make sure that we're not forget
ting anybody in the process," he
said. Such students would have to
"demonstrate that they have
something to contribute to the
summit and something to learn
from it as well."
Although the summit partici
pants will represent their commu
nities, they will also be encour
aged to express their individual
viewpoints.
Several of the summit plan
ners expressed hope that the
summit will be the beginning of a
continued effort to bring together
student leaders from diverse com
munities.
Liu said he wishes for "a per
manent mechanism for communi
cation among students on cam
pus." He also said he hopes stu
dents will take the results of the
summit back to their communi
ties.

adviser in the Office of Student

One goal of the sum
mit is 'a permanent
mechanism for com
munication among
students.'

Activities, called the summit "the
first step" in improving commu
nication among various student
leaders. She also mentioned a pro
posal to institutionalize the sum
mit, perhaps before classes start.
Such a program would be "paral
lel to RA training," she said.
Ricks lauded the administra
tion for allowing students to use
the summit to make their voices
heard. "We as older adults need to
spend more time trying to listen
to students," he said.
He also said he hopes partici
pants in the summit will "agree to
disagree, and still be cordial and
be committed to struggling to try
to find some common ground....
Hopefully, [students] will begin to
become more respectful and sen
sitive to other people's experi
ences."
Liu said he thinks the summit
will also affect individual stu
dents. "For individuals, the sum
mit is going to be fun, is going to
be empowering and in some ways,
a person will feel special for hav
ing attended."
