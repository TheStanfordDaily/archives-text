# Secretary Sullivan addresses growing costs of health care
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services Louis Sullivan delivered a policy
address yesterday morning at the Stanford
Medical Center enumerating some of the
problems of mounting health care costs in
the United States.
But while he mentioned a few specific
suggestions, Sullivan offered few overall
policies to help solve the problems he so
thoroughly described.
The speech, entitled "Health Care Costs
and Financing Access to Care," was the
first stop in a Bay Area lecture series about
the increasing difficulty of providing afford
able health care and meeting the needs for
affordable medical insurance and access to
adequate care for all Americans.
Sullivan scud he has begun M a dialogue
with the American people," meeting with
health care providers, insurance represen
tatives and public health and other govern
ment officials to reach a consensus on how
best to solve the problems created by rising
health costs.
Currently, these costs amount to about
$650 billion per year, or 12 percent of the
gross national product. By comparison, the
figure was 9 percent of the gross national

product in 1980 and 5.3 percent in 1960.
While Sullivan said these costs were not
"empirically too high," he noted, "the
$2,600 that we will spend in 1990 on aver
age for each and every man, woman and
child in the country ought to be enough."
He noted three main causes for the
unprecedented growth in health care costs:
• Insurance practices which shelter the
public from seeing the "immediate effects"
of health care costs;
• The lack of attention health care
providers pay to the actual costs of the care
they administer; and
• Personal behavior which compromises
health and safety, such as not wearing seat
belts or smoking.
Nearly 33 million people have no health
insurance protection, he added. For those
with low incomes, access to adequate care
may be unavailable or unafTordable, Sulli
van said. Even people who are insured and
can afford care may not be getting the ser
vices they really need.
The secretary described several plans to
improve access to medical care in poor
areas, such as student loan forgiveness for
medical students who open practices in low
income neighborhoods and bonus payments
of up to 10 percent for doctors
who work in underserved regions.
Also in the works, he said, are
a program allowing medical stu
dents to serve part of their resi
dency in public housing projects
and a program to reestablish a
national health corps to serve
urban areas.
Yet, despite the critical lack of
care for the poor and uninsured,
Sullivan categorically rejected the
idea of a national health care plan
as inconsistent with the Ameri
can free-enterprise system.
Warning against overlooking
"the strengths of our system,"
Sullivan said his goal is "to build
on the private-public system so
that we will continue to have the
creativity of our private sector" in
the health care field.
One way to address the needs
of the underserved, many of
whom are minorities, would be to
encourage minority students to
enter the medical profession, he
said.
Though Sullivan stressed that
minority doctors should by no
means serve only minority
patients, often such relationships
can enhance patient-doctor com
munication and improve treat
ment by making it more personal,
he explained.
Addressing the issue of rising
doctors' fees, Sullivan suggested
fees for specialized services such
as ophthalmology and anesthesi
ology should be restrained while
increasing the pay that general
practitioners and family doctors
receive.
Although doctors' wages would
still increase, he said, reducing
the gap between general and spe

cialized fees would perhaps make
general practice more appealing
to new doctors.
Another mqjor theme in Sulli
van's speech was the need for
educating the public about the
nature and extent of the problem.
People could contribute to the
effort to cut health care costs sim
ply by taking better care of them
selves, he said.
The top 10 causes of death in
the United States are signifi
cantly related to personal behav
ior, Sullivan said. Making changes
in diet, exercise and other habits
could drastically reduce the num
ber of health problems which
need to be treated, he added.
To that end, the Department of
Health and Human Services has
published "Healthy People 2000,"
which lists over 200 ways to be
healthier.
Other steps include promoting
prenatal care for pregnant women
and more complete education in
schools about general hygiene,
sex, AIDS and drugs, particularly
tobacco. Sullivan said it is impor
tant that people receive informa
tion from sources they consider
credible.
He also said a variety of offi
cials need to help to achieve these
goals.
But these programs are not yet
government policy. Sullivan said
before concrete programs could
be developed, there needs to be a
broad national consensus as to
the best strategies for attacking
the problems.
Moreover, the implications of
any policy would touch many
areas of government, not just
health care, Sullivan explained.
In developing a solution to these
problems, Sullivan said the gov
ernment must examine "the
entire range of needs of our citi
zens" to devise effective plans.
