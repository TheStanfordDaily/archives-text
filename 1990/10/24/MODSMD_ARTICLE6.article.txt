### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services Louis Sullivan delivered a policy
address yesterday morning at the Stanford
Medical Center enumerating some of the
problems of mounting health care costs in
the United States.
But while he mentioned a few specific
suggestions, Sullivan offered few overall
policies to help solve the problems he so
thoroughly described.
The speech, entitled "Health Care Costs
and Financing Access to Care," was the
first stop in a Bay Area lecture series about
the increasing difficulty of providing afford
able health care and meeting the needs for
affordable medical insurance and access to
adequate care for all Americans.
Sullivan scud he has begun M a dialogue
with the American people," meeting with
health care providers, insurance represen
tatives and public health and other govern
ment officials to reach a consensus on how
best to solve the problems created by rising
health costs.
Currently, these costs amount to about
$650 billion per year, or 12 percent of the
gross national product. By comparison, the
figure was 9 percent of the gross national

product in 1980 and 5.3 percent in 1960.
While Sullivan said these costs were not
"empirically too high," he noted, "the
$2,600 that we will spend in 1990 on aver
age for each and every man, woman and
child in the country ought to be enough."
He noted three main causes for the
unprecedented growth in health care costs:
• Insurance practices which shelter the
public from seeing the "immediate effects"
of health care costs;
• The lack of attention health care
providers pay to the actual costs of the care
they administer; and
• Personal behavior which compromises
health and safety, such as not wearing seat
belts or smoking.
Nearly 33 million people have no health
insurance protection, he added. For those
with low incomes, access to adequate care
may be unavailable or unafTordable, Sulli
van said. Even people who are insured and
can afford care may not be getting the ser
vices they really need.
The secretary described several plans to
improve access to medical care in poor
areas, such as student loan forgiveness for
medical students who open practices in low
income neighborhoods and bonus payments
