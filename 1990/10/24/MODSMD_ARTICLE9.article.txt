Intended as an assessment of Presi
dent Bush's performance during the last
two years, last night's Okada House
debate turned into a study in ideological
differences between the Democratic and
Republican parties.
Entitled "George Bush: Wimp or Win
ner," the debate between Stanford Repub
lican Keith Rabois and Stanford

Democrats Scott Christofferson and
Brian Rigonan began by analyzing
Bush's performance.
In his five minute introduction, Rigo
nan gave Bush rather high marks. He
noted Bush's achievements in foreign pol
icy, arms control and holding open press
conferences.
Rigonan's only strong criticisms of
Bush concerned his dealing with the
media during the Panama invasion and

his attitude toward the environment. Rig
onan said these two aspects of the presi
dency make it appear somewhat "para
doxical" because Bush insisted he would
be open with the press and also be "the
environmental president."
Christofferson was more critical of the
president. He attacked Bush for being
"reactive" rather than "pro-active." He
said we rarely see the president "coming
to the forefront of an issue and leading

the nation; rather, he waits until a crisis
develops."
He also said it is clear the president is
only looking out for the interests of big
business and the wealthy.
Rabois began his introduction with a
graphic description of the downfall of
1988 Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis.
He then praised Bush's drug policy as
being the first to reduce the drug problem

significantly. Raboia also praised Bush s
foreign policy, saying the president was
successful in Nicaragua, Panama and
Eastern Europe.
Rabois was quick to note that Bush's
success was most visible in foreign policy
because "in foreign policy, Democrats
can't obstruct what Bush was elected to
do." He cited Congress' rejection of the
capital gains cut as an example of Demo
cratic interference.
