Union says new
contractor won't
give equal hours

Former Tresidder Union
custodian Ray Henson is filing
a grievance against the Univer
sity because he was not offered
the 20 hours per week he asked
for this fall, something he
thinks he deserved.
Henson and seven other
workers were laid off this sum
mer because Tresidder decided
to contract out its custodial
service to American Building
Maintenance, a San Mateo
based company.
The custodial crew belonged
to the United Stanford Work
ers, whose 1988 agreement
with Stanford guarantees that
in the event of layoffs resulting
from contracting out, the Uni
versity has to ensure by con
tract that the company offer
employment at "substantially
equivalent wages" to the laid
off workers.
Henson used to work 20
hours per week before his lay
off, but this fall he was only
offered 14 hours. Based on the
above provision, he said the
contract has been breached.
Henson has since quit his
job at Tresidder. "[The mainte
nance company] didn't give me
the hours it is supposed to," he
said.
The San Mateo branch man
ager of the company could not
be reached for comment.
Henry Battle, the only cus
todian of the original eight who
is working for the maintenance
company, said he has seen eight
to nine people cleaning up
Tresidder together on more
than one occasion. Henson said
he has seen as many as 15 cus-

eight Janitors laid off during the summer, he is the only one now working for the
new Janitorial contractor.
