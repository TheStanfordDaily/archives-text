Union says new
contractor won't
give equal hours

Former Tresidder Union
custodian Ray Henson is filing
a grievance against the Univer
sity because he was not offered
the 20 hours per week he asked
for this fall, something he
thinks he deserved.
Henson and seven other
workers were laid off this sum
mer because Tresidder decided
to contract out its custodial
service to American Building
Maintenance, a San Mateo
based company.
The custodial crew belonged
to the United Stanford Work
ers, whose 1988 agreement
with Stanford guarantees that
in the event of layoffs resulting
from contracting out, the Uni
versity has to ensure by con
tract that the company offer
employment at "substantially
equivalent wages" to the laid
off workers.
Henson used to work 20
hours per week before his lay
off, but this fall he was only
offered 14 hours. Based on the
above provision, he said the
contract has been breached.
Henson has since quit his
job at Tresidder. "[The mainte
nance company] didn't give me
the hours it is supposed to," he
said.
The San Mateo branch man
ager of the company could not
be reached for comment.
Henry Battle, the only cus
todian of the original eight who
is working for the maintenance
company, said he has seen eight
to nine people cleaning up
Tresidder together on more
than one occasion. Henson said
he has seen as many as 15 cus-

todians working at the same time.
Linda Crouse, a temporary
USW representative who is one of
the laid-off custodians, main
tained that although the company
is free to determine the custodial
staffing level, it should not deny
Henson's request for more hours
and at the same time bring in
more workers to do the job.
The USW has questioned
whether Tresidder can actually be
saving money if more workers are
doing the same job as before.
However, Jeanette Smith-
Laws, building service manager at
Tresidder, said the maintenance
company would never bring in
that many people unless she
requested extra workers for spe
cial events.
For example, Smith-Laws said
she arranged for many workers to
clean up Tresidder, the Old Union
Club House and the Plack House
on Sept. 1 because the buildings
were not properly maintained
during the summer. That was the
only occasion when a larger crew
was working, she said.
Smith-Laws refused to com
ment on Henson's case because a
grievance has been filed at
Employee Relations.
Richard Ramirez, an organizer
at Local 1877 of the Service
Employees Union which repre

sents the maintenance company's
workers, said his union is "totally
against union members losing
their jobs," regardless of their
union membership.
Henson filed his Oct. 1
grievance through the USW and
not through the Service Employ
ees Union because the "equiva
lent wages" clause appears in the
USW-Stanford contract.
"We intend to take this to arbi
tration," Crouse said.
Michael Vartain, a senior Uni
versity counsel, said the Univer
sity has already complied with the
USW agreement by including in
its contract with the new mainte
nance company a provision which
requires it to honor the precondi
tions for hiring laid-off custodi
ans.
"[The company] is contractu
ally obligated (to provide substan
tially equivalent wages). The Uni
versity is not in any violation," he
said.
Crouse, however, said workers
have heard Smith-Laws tell main
tenance company managers who
to hire and how many hours to
offer. The USW demanded to see
the exact wording of Stanford's
contract with the company, but
this request has not been hon
ored, Crouse said.
She added that, without seeing
the contract, the union cannot
confirm its suspicions or intelli
gently present its case during
arbitration.

Tresidder, which faced a 20-
percent reduction in its operating
budget this fall, announced its
plans to contract out its custodial
service in June.
Bobbi Braden, director of
Tresidder, told The Daily during
the summer that Tresidder
expects to save $112,000 per year.
She said savings will come from
reduced staffing, benefit pay
ments and supplies cost.
However, Crouse said she
thinks the maintenance company
is still using University cleaning
supplies, and questioned whether
Tresidder is really saving money.
"[The custodians] use the same
supplies (as before)," Battle said.
"They (Tresidder) ain't saving
nothing."
Braden said the company is
"going to be" providing supples,
which is an option and not a spe
cific term in the contract. The
contract is only about custodial
service, Braden said.
Smith-Laws, in an apparent
contradiction, stressed the com
pany is now providing the clean
ing supplies "as part of the origi
nal contract."
Crouse said she once asked
Smith-Laws whether Bon
Appetit, the caterer at Tresidder,
was using University supplies.
She got a negative answer, she
said.

budget this fall, announced its
plans to contract out its custodial
service in June.
Bobbi Braden, director of
Tresidder, told The Daily during
the summer that Tresidder
expects to save $112,000 per year.
She said savings will come from
reduced staffing, benefit pay
ments and supplies cost.
However, Crouse said she
thinks the maintenance company
is still using University cleaning
supplies, and questioned whether
Tresidder is really saving money.
"[The custodians] use the same
supplies (as before)," Battle said.
"They (Tresidder) ain't saving
nothing."
Braden said the company is
"going to be" providing supples,
which is an option and not a spe
cific term in the contract. The
contract is only about custodial
service, Braden said.
Smith-Laws, in an apparent
contradiction, stressed the com
pany is now providing the clean
ing supplies "as part of the origi
nal contract."
Crouse said she once asked
Smith-Laws whether Bon
Appetit, the caterer at Tresidder,
was using University supplies.
She got a negative answer, she
said.
Union says new
contractor won't
give equal hours

Former Tresidder Union
custodian Ray Henson is filing
a grievance against the Univer
sity because he was not offered
the 20 hours per week he asked
for this fall, something he
thinks he deserved.
Henson and seven other
workers were laid off this sum
mer because Tresidder decided
to contract out its custodial
service to American Building
Maintenance, a San Mateo
based company.
The custodial crew belonged
to the United Stanford Work
ers, whose 1988 agreement
with Stanford guarantees that
in the event of layoffs resulting
from contracting out, the Uni
versity has to ensure by con
tract that the company offer
employment at "substantially
equivalent wages" to the laid
off workers.
Henson used to work 20
hours per week before his lay
off, but this fall he was only
offered 14 hours. Based on the
above provision, he said the
contract has been breached.
Henson has since quit his
job at Tresidder. "[The mainte
nance company] didn't give me
the hours it is supposed to," he
said.
The San Mateo branch man
ager of the company could not
be reached for comment.
Henry Battle, the only cus
todian of the original eight who
is working for the maintenance
company, said he has seen eight
to nine people cleaning up
Tresidder together on more
than one occasion. Henson said
he has seen as many as 15 cus-

new Janitorial contractor.
todians working at the same time.
Linda Crouse, a temporary
USW representative who is one of
the laid-off custodians, main
tained that although the company
is free to determine the custodial
staffing level, it should not deny
Henson's request for more hours
and at the same time bring in
more workers to do the job.
The USW has questioned
whether Tresidder can actually be
saving money if more workers are
doing the same job as before.
However, Jeanette Smith-
Laws, building service manager at
Tresidder, said the maintenance
company would never bring in
that many people unless she
requested extra workers for spe
cial events.
For example, Smith-Laws said
she arranged for many workers to
clean up Tresidder, the Old Union
Club House and the Plack House
on Sept. 1 because the buildings
were not properly maintained
during the summer. That was the
only occasion when a larger crew
was working, she said.
Smith-Laws refused to com
ment on Henson's case because a
grievance has been filed at
Employee Relations.
Richard Ramirez, an organizer
at Local 1877 of the Service
Employees Union which repre

sents the maintenance company's
workers, said his union is "totally
against union members losing
their jobs," regardless of their
union membership.
Henson filed his Oct. 1
grievance through the USW and
not through the Service Employ
ees Union because the "equiva
lent wages" clause appears in the
USW-Stanford contract.
"We intend to take this to arbi
tration," Crouse said.
Michael Vartain, a senior Uni
versity counsel, said the Univer
sity has already complied with the
USW agreement by including in
its contract with the new mainte
nance company a provision which
requires it to honor the precondi
tions for hiring laid-off custodi
ans.
"[The company] is contractu
ally obligated (to provide substan
tially equivalent wages). The Uni
versity is not in any violation," he
said.
Crouse, however, said workers
have heard Smith-Laws tell main
tenance company managers who
to hire and how many hours to
offer. The USW demanded to see
the exact wording of Stanford's
contract with the company, but
this request has not been hon
ored, Crouse said.
She added that, without seeing
the contract, the union cannot
confirm its suspicions or intelli
gently present its case during
arbitration.
