ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -
Benazir Bhutto's party suffered a
stunning defeat at the hands of
her right-wing foes in parliamen
tary elections yesterday, unofficial
returns indicated. The electoral
rout was widely seen as a verdict
on her dismissal as prime minis
ter.
She refused to concede defeat
late last night, and accused Presi
dent Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the
army-backed caretaker govern
ment of large-scale vote-rigging in
what most analysts and opinion
polls predicted would be a close
contest.

"This election is a fraud,"
Bhutto said, fighting back tears.
Her opponents dismissed rig
ging charges.
"She's a sore loser," said Hus
sein Haqqani, a spokesman for the
caretaker government. "She's
finding it hard to accept that she's
no longer on the pedestal and that
she is no longer the heroine of
democracy. After a few days she'll
have to accept it."
Bhutto herself ran for two
seats. She overwhelmingly won
re-election in Larkana in southern
Sind Province but suffered a
humiliating defeat in the north

ern city of Peshawar, losing by
nearly 12,000 votes.
She faces trials before special
tribunals on corruption charges
and could be denied her seat and
banished from politics for seven
years if convicted.
A spokesman for a 40-member
group of international poll watch
ers refused comment on the elec
tion until the group assembled.
Election officials said turnout
among the estimated 50 million
eligible voters was unusually light
— in many places less than 10 per
cent.
