DONESTSK, U.S.S.R. CAP) - The
national trade union organization
voted to dissolve itself yesterday, as
coal miners gathered in the Ukraine at
the same time and announced plans to
create the first mass independent
union in Soviet history.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
attended the meeting in Moscow of the
government-sponsored National
Congress of Trade Unions, whose
2,500 delegates voted to reconstitute
the 70-year-old organization as a vol

untary association of unions.
Gorbachev told the meeting that he
favored "strong and independent"
unions, the state news agency Tass
reported.
A meeting of the umbrella group,
representing about 140 million work
ers, was called for this week, two years
ahead of schedule. The dissolution of
the organization appeared to be an
effort to defuse the emergence of the
radical miners' union.
The miners, holding their congress

in the Donetsk Coal Basin, 600 miles
south of Moscow, have been threaten
ing a repeat of the nationwide strikes
that threatened to cripple the nation in
July 1989.
Miner delegates from Western
Siberia, Kazakhstan and the far north
said they would not call a strike pend
ing consideration of their complaints
by the legislature of the Russian
republic, now in session in Moscow.
But they said they would create an
independent union.

"We will adopt a draft, and we will
go from here as the first members of an
independent trade union," said
Alexander Adanidi, a member of
Kuznetsk Basin Workers' Committee,
which started the 1989 strike.
Adanidi and other Siberian miners
complained that Coal Minister Mikhail
Shchadov, whose agency owns all
mines and associated industries across
the country, had tried to undermine
the legitimacy of the congress by con
tributing nearly $70,000 to it.
