## Theme house life 
### 
Freshmen should not
be randomly assigned
to theme houses

OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS,
the University's ethnic
theme houses have become
an integral, valuable part of the
Stanford community.
They provide a comfortable
home and a much needed source of
support for students of color at an
institution with a mtyority of white
people.
They provide an incomparable
opportunity for students who are
not members of the theme houses'
ethnicities to learn about different
cultures — by living them.
They provide cross-cultural out
reach that would probably other
wise be lacking at Stanford. The
myriad of all-campus events —
including speakers, programs and
performances — coordinated by
theme associates truly enriches the
educational atmosphere of this
University.
Students do not need to live in
ethnic theme houses to benefit
from their presence on campus.
Thus, freshmen and incoming stu
dents should not be forced to live in
them (through random housing
assignments) if they don't want to.
Although many students who
are initially apprehensive about
living in ethnic theme houses
quickly realize what a wonderful
experience it can be, others remain
uncomfortable the entire year.
Some residents who are not

members of a theme house's eth
nicity become more alienated and
isolated as a result.
Enough freshmen request
assignments to ethnic theme
houses that quotas for classes can
be filled without randomly assign
ing anyone there.
In the case of Casa Zapata, the
Chicano and Mexican-American
theme house, the 55 incoming
freshmen who requested to live
there this year is more than half
the size of the entire dormitory.
In the cases of Okada, the Asian-
American theme house, and Uja
maa, the African-American theme
house, the numbers of such
requests equal about a quarter of
the size of each dormitory — just
about the right percentage of
freshmen for a four-class dorm.
Of course, most of these
requests come from students who
are members of the theme house's
ethnicity. The University has set a
maximum percentage of students
of color in the dorm.
But it should disregard these
quotas and not force unwilling stu
dents to live ethnic theme houses.
That goes for freshmen who
want to live in Muwekma-tah-ruk,
the Native American theme house.
Because it is on the Row, no fresh
man can be assigned to it. The Uni
versity should allow freshmen to
live there if they request to.
Even if the tiny house of 30
occupants is not currently orga
nized to accommodate some of the
ordinary needs of freshmen, it
would do better than many all
freshman dorms in accommodat
ing the needs of Native American
freshmen.
