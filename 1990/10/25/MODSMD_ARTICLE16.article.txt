## A 						letter to a dear friend 
### 
Though it is hard to write
these words, I know it is impor
tant to say them. You see, there is
nothing quite so frightening as question
ing yourself and your beliefs. But not long
ago, after speaking with a high school
friend, I did just that.
As I questioned myself, I learned that
although I was committed to liberal and
open attitudes, my commitment meant
little in practical terms. Once the political
became personal, I closed down and
started to see with a narrower, and more
judgmental view.
Maybe you have gone through this too.
Maybe this will be a letter you will need to
write some day.
Dear ,
The news didn't really shock me. I had
sort of guessed it before. But even when I
finally heard the words — when you
finally told me, it was still hard to handle.
I mean, it just didn't make sense to me.
You're my friend — you couldn't be gay.
But then I suppressed that thought.
How could I think of myself when it was
so obvious you were the one who needed
support just then?
With tears streaming down your face,
you seemed so scared. Afraid of judgment
— afraid of what I would say next —
afraid because by coming out you could
have been risking a friendship.
So I stopped thinking about my own
feelings, and concentrated on yours. I
wanted to be there for you. You needed
support. You needed to hear that I
thought you were still OK in my eyes and
I wanted you to know that you were.

See, knowing you're gay doesn't
change my opinion of you. I don't think
anything is "wrong" with you.
You are the same kind, giving and ded
icated person you have always been —
nothing could change that.
So at the end of our talk that night, I
walked away with a tremendous sense of
relief. I was glad we could be open with
each other again.
Honesty had always been so important
between us. With everything out in the
open we were able to be honest again.
But later, as the news sunk in, those
initial feelings of denial and misunder
standing crept back into my thoughts. It
wasn't that I had only pretended to be
supportive of you when we talked, but I
just hadn't acknowledged the full range
of my thoughts and feelings.
Once I stopped censoring my thoughts,
I realized that though I claimed to be "lib
eral," I had suppressed negative feelings
about homosexuality.
See, I have always thought I held an
enlightened "understanding" about gay
people. It was OK for "them" to do what
ever they wanted to do. Homosexuality
didn't bother me. The reality of it was
outside of my personal sphere.
But suddenly you were a "them." I
realized then that "understanding"
wasn't really understanding at all - I
couldn't understand why you were gay.
My "understanding" turned out to be
simply tolerance.
Instead of simply "tolerating" your
lifestyle, I want to accept this part of your
identity that you have finally accepted.
But I am at a loss.

I don't know how to re-train my mind.
How do I begin to think differently? How
do I begin to think of homosexuality as an
issue that is not outside of my personal
life but within it?
Besides that, I don't see you as gay.
Though I would have denied it before, I
guess I really do have some image of who
or what a gay person is. Somehow you
don't fit that image.
Because you don't fit my stereotype,
I'm learning that I have to give up this
preconception. But it is hard to face prej
udices — prejudices I never suspected I
had
Now I am learning.
I'm learning: gay people look different
ways, and act different ways. They do all
kinds of things in life. They are every
where.
I'm accepting: you are gay and you are
my friend and there is nothing strange
about that.
Most of all I'm praying that these
words of mine show that I still care about
you. You are still my friend. You will
always be my friend. Nothing can change
that.
Always,
——
