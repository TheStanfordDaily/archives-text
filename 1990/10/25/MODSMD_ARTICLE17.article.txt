## Article on AIDS research gave unrealistic hope of cure 
### 
AS A BELIEVER IN THE impor
tance of good science journalism, I
was very disturbed to read the arti
cle "New hope for AIDS: DNA break
through could result in cure" on the.
front page of the Oct. 19 Daily.
While the work cited undoubtedly rep
resents a significant step forward in
basic biomedical research which may
prove relevant to human disease, anyone
with modest training in the biological
sciences and a critical eye knows it is a
wild overstatement to portray it as
"paving the way for cancer and AIDS
cures."
A cure of any disease based on this
work is highly speculative, to say the
least; even if such speculation were cor

rect, the cure is many, many years away.
Only in the eighth paragraph do we
read the understated disclaimer that Dr.
Romberg's research "has no direct or
immediate application to the treatment
of a specific disease," and even this is
stated only as an aside.
The secondary message of the article
seems to be that "Romberg... lamented
... that money needed for basic research
is being siphoned away by crusades that
promise quick cures for cancer and other
diseases."
Unfortunately for both science jour
nalists and researchers, neither the
research nor the lament in question is
front-page news, unless one also can
report the prospect of a cure for a mtyor

disease.
Ironically, by turning it into front
page news, you put Dr. Romberg in the
position of seeming to promise "cures for
cancer and other diseases," albeit not
quick ones.
This sort of journalism is irresponsi
ble for many reasons. First, it engenders
unrealistic hope and inevitable disap
pointment in people afflicted with these
diseases.
Second, it may give the unafflicted a
sense that "a cure is just around the cor
ner, so maybe I don't need to stop smok
ing, use condoms, etc."
• Third — and possibly most disturbing
— it distorts information that is vital to

sound social policy for funding of basic
and clinical research.
There is no doubt that we need both
sorts of research. But to suggest, as your
article seems to, that we should support
basic research over disease-specific
research because basic research is more
likely to deliver a cure is either naive or
cynical, and bound to lead to backlash
when inflated claims are not met.
In any case, science reporting needs
the same objectivity and discrimination
as any other sort of journalism, because
these issues are crucial to all of us both
as individuals and as a society.
