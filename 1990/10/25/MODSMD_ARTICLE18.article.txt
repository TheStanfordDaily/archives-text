# Fraternity has been singled out, given unfair punishment
## 
### 
Fraternities at Stanford have a bad
reputation. Here's why:
Let's suppose seven Roble residents
got really drunk one night at a dorm
party. Suppose, in their drunken revelry,
they thought it would be funny to enter
another dormitory and make a lot of
noise â€” even knock on the doors of a few
peaceful sleepers.
What would happen to these hooli
gans if they were caught? Would they be
charged with a Fundamental Standard
violation? Doubtful. Would they be
arrested? Hardly.
Would all of Roble be put on probation
because of the dorm's "collective respon
sibility" for its members' actions? Umm,
maybe not.
Would anyone think twice about what
these women had done? No. In fact, I
think that about an hour after they had

their fun, no one on campus would
remember a thing about it.
Now, what if the same thing hap
pened, except the perpetrators belonged
to a fraternity?
It did, and under the guidance of the
University, the Interfraternity Council
put the Sigma Chi fraternity on proba
tion until spring quarter. And then
everyone heard about it because The
Daily wrote an article. And then the rep
utation of fraternities grew worse.
My question is, why does the Univer
sity want to punish a whole fraternity
for the behavior of a few of its members
acting on their own? Whole dorms are
never punished when several residents
transgress. And the administration is
apparently not held responsible for the
crimes committed by its members.
Furthermore, why hold fraternity
members to higher standards of conduct
(i.e. no drunken noise-making) than the
rest of the campus? Doesn't the Univer
sity realize that by placing abnormally
stringent rules on one group of students
they guarantee that those students will
get in trouble more often?
Stanford owns most of the fraternity

houses on campus; if they want to elimi
nate fraternities, they can do so quite
easily. If not, why harass them?
