# Reusable mugs save resources, should be dorm-promoted
## 
### 
We applaud The Daily's endorsement
of reusable mugs and cups at Tresidder,
but we cannot forget that there are other
sources of unnecessary solid waste on
campus.
Stanford students throw away untold
numbers of plastic, paper (wax-coated
and not) and styrofoam cups from study
breaks, parties and eating facilities.
These cups are rarely reused, are not
recyclable and end up in our overflowing
landfills.
We can stop that waste and, in fact,
we have to. California state law man
dates that we must reduce our waste 25

percent by the year 1995 and 50 percent
by the year 2000. Cups are an easy tar
get.
Residences should establish a bring
your-own-cup policy for parties and
study breaks — it saves natural
resources, money and clean-up time.
The Enchanted Broccoli Forest co
operative has implemented the policy
with success, and found that selling
mugs from Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford prevented and any
unhappiness among forgetful partygoers.
A final note — we heartily support
flier reduction on campus. The American
Studies House has circulated a sample
flier to be affixed to residence entrances
declaring the residence a flier-reduced
zone and directing students to place a
single flier on a centrally located bulletin
board.
