# Tours closure met with regret
## Students, faculty question why program was cut 
### Alan Gutman 
TOURS, France — Students and faculty at the
Stanford Center in Tours reacted negatively to the
news that the center would be closed because of bud
get cuts at the Center for Overseas Studies.
The campus received a fax last week announcing
the decision by Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas to close the center in favor of a two
tier program in Paris. The move will save the Uni
versity an estimated $120,000 annually, some of
which would be used to strengthen the programs in
Berlin and Kyoto, according to Thomas.
"The choice to close Tours and to open a second
level of the program in Paris is a choice that is a
made in the larger context of decisions about where
Stanford should be sending students to study, and on
what kind of programs," Thomas wrote in the fax.
Junior David Brown, a student in Tours, said he
doesn't understand "the reason for closing a success
ful and established program which fits well with the
community and is very welcome here."
Junior Stephen Hooker, strumming on the cen
ter's guitar, said, "It's a shame to close a program
this cool."
Florence Biscaras, a French student from the
Institut de Torraine who visits the center frequently,

said the Stanford program in Tours is different from
other university's programs because "it is like a fam
ily and provides a place to meet."
Biscaras said she doesn't know what she will do
next year when the center closes. "Maybe the United
States will have one more French immigrant next
year," she said in an unusual switch from French to
English.
Many students and stafT members questioned
why the Tours campus was the only one cut. Tours
has received better marks in the quality of professors
and courses than Berlin, Florence or Oxford, accord
ing to course evaluations given to all overseas stu
dents last year.
Anne Durand, an assistant director of the center,
said it was questionable whether the University
would save any money by shifting the program to
Paris, where families charge double the rent that
families in Tours do. Durand also said Tours was the
least costly campus of its kind.
The city of Tours and the Council of the Indre et
Loire, in an attempt to convince Stanford keep its
Tours center, last week authorized the purchase of
the building that houses the center so that rent
could be kept at a minimum.

Oeirdra O'Reilly, a Junior at the time, studies last year in the library of the Overseas Studies center In
Tours, France. Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas announced last week that the center will
close at the end of the school year.
The building, a three-story, 150
year-old structure that houses the
residences for the students, three
classrooms and a library, was pre
viously owned by a Tours commu
nity member.
Paul LeMoal, who has been the
director of the center since its
inception in 1960, said he was
concerned about the commitment
of the Overseas Studies office to
the program in Tours. He said the
closing was the result of the false
impression that the provinces of
France did not have as much to
offer as Paris. He called this "aca
demic snobbery."
LeMoal also said Thomas
Heller, director of Overseas Stud
ies, had visited the Tours campus
only twice in the last five years.
Each of these visits was for two
hours only, and in one visit, he
spent an hour-and-a-half at a local
restaurant, LeMoal said.
Heller was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
The University has been con
sidering closing the Tours campus

since last May, but Thomas post
poned a decision until he could get
more information.
The format of the new Paris
program will reduce the number
of students that can attend a pro
gram in France from 140 to 100
per year. In addition, class sizes
will most likely be affected by the
move. In Tours, the classes vary
from between 3 and 11 students,
whereas the classes in Paris are
significantly larger.
The Paris program will focus
on the study of the French lan
guage, while the Tours program
currently focuses on French liter
ature and culture.
"They're going to chuck all
that in the trash for a little cash,"
said Jason Moore, a junior in
product design. Moore said he
chose the one-quarter program in
Tours over the Paris center, which
requires a two-quarter commit
ment, because product design "is
a big and I can't go (to
Paris) unless I pay for another
year at Stanford."
Ralph Hester, the coordinator
of the French Language Program
in Tours, said Stanford is sacrific
ing an atmosphere conducive to
the acquisition of a second lan

guage in favor of the international
atmosphere of Paris, which is not
uniquely French like Tours.
Hester said Stanford is disre
garding its commitment to pro
viding a liberal arts education by
making the acquisition of a lan
guage a secondary goal.
Thomas said last Friday he
believes the cultural richness of
Paris will allow students to expe
rience a broader cross-section of
the world.
"It is a choice which arises fun
damentally out of our strong
belief that Overseas Studies
should seek continually to provide
the most stimulating, challenging
and culturally enriching academic
experiences overseas that it possi
bly can," Thomas said in the fax
sent to Tours.
The Tours program is gener
ally viewed by students there as
combining the advantages of a
city without the inconveniences of
a large city like Paris. Paris is now
only an hour away from Tours
due to the recent completion of
the fastest train in the world,
which links the two cities.
Junior Mary Schlarb likened
the move of the Tours campus to
Paris to moving the Stanford cam

pus to San Francisco or New York.
The future of the center's
French staff of language instruc
tors and office personnel is uncer
tain. Their fate will depend on
whether Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity, which will take over the cen
ter next year, decides to retain
them.
Claude Doubinsky, an assistant
director of the center, said he will
meet with representatives of
Carnegie-Mellon to decide
whether or not the staff will stay.
As the University closes its
campus in Tours, some Stanford
officials are already discussing the
possibility of opening up a new
campus in Beijing, China. The
funds for a new China campus
will be raised primarily through
donations, and the program is not
expected to present a significant
cost to the University.
In addition to students from
Stanford, the city of Tours is also
host to students from George
town, Bucknell and Rutgers Uni
versities.

combining the advantages of a
city without the inconveniences of
a large city like Paris. Paris is now
only an hour away from Tours
due to the recent completion of
the fastest train in the world,
which links the two cities.
Junior Mary Schlarb likened
the move of the Tours campus to
Paris to moving the Stanford cam

pus to San Francisco or New York.
The future of the center's
French staff of language instruc
tors and office personnel is uncer
tain. Their fate will depend on
whether Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity, which will take over the cen
ter next year, decides to retain
them.
Claude Doubinsky, an assistant
director of the center, said he will
meet with representatives of
Carnegie-Mellon to decide
whether or not the staff will stay.
As the University closes its
campus in Tours, some Stanford
officials are already discussing the
possibility of opening up a new
campus in Beijing, China. The
funds for a new China campus
will be raised primarily through
donations, and the program is not
expected to present a significant
cost to the University.
In addition to students from
Stanford, the city of Tours is also
host to students from George
town, Bucknell and Rutgers Uni
versities.
TOURS, France — Students and faculty at the
Stanford Center in Tours reacted negatively to the
news that the center would be closed because of bud
get cuts at the Center for Overseas Studies.
The campus received a fax last week announcing
the decision by Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas to close the center in favor of a two
tier program in Paris. The move will save the Uni
versity an estimated $120,000 annually, some of
which would be used to strengthen the programs in
Berlin and Kyoto, according to Thomas.
"The choice to close Tours and to open a second
level of the program in Paris is a choice that is a
made in the larger context of decisions about where
Stanford should be sending students to study, and on
what kind of programs," Thomas wrote in the fax.
Junior David Brown, a student in Tours, said he
doesn't understand "the reason for closing a success
ful and established program which fits well with the
community and is very welcome here."
Junior Stephen Hooker, strumming on the cen
ter's guitar, said, "It's a shame to close a program
this cool."
Florence Biscaras, a French student from the
Institut de Torraine who visits the center frequently,

said the Stanford program in Tours is different from
other university's programs because "it is like a fam
ily and provides a place to meet."
Biscaras said she doesn't know what she will do
next year when the center closes. "Maybe the United
States will have one more French immigrant next
year," she said in an unusual switch from French to
English.
Many students and stafT members questioned
why the Tours campus was the only one cut. Tours
has received better marks in the quality of professors
and courses than Berlin, Florence or Oxford, accord
ing to course evaluations given to all overseas stu
dents last year.
Anne Durand, an assistant director of the center,
said it was questionable whether the University
would save any money by shifting the program to
Paris, where families charge double the rent that
families in Tours do. Durand also said Tours was the
least costly campus of its kind.
The city of Tours and the Council of the Indre et
Loire, in an attempt to convince Stanford keep its
Tours center, last week authorized the purchase of
the building that houses the center so that rent
could be kept at a minimum.

Oeirdra O'Reilly, a Junior at the time, studies last year in the library of the Overseas Studies center In
Tours, France. Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas announced last week that the center will
close at the end of the school year.
The building, a three-story, 150
year-old structure that houses the
residences for the students, three
classrooms and a library, was pre
viously owned by a Tours commu
nity member.
Paul LeMoal, who has been the
director of the center since its
inception in 1960, said he was
concerned about the commitment
of the Overseas Studies office to
the program in Tours. He said the
closing was the result of the false
impression that the provinces of
France did not have as much to
offer as Paris. He called this "aca
demic snobbery."
LeMoal also said Thomas
Heller, director of Overseas Stud
ies, had visited the Tours campus
only twice in the last five years.
Each of these visits was for two
hours only, and in one visit, he
spent an hour-and-a-half at a local
restaurant, LeMoal said.
Heller was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
The University has been con
sidering closing the Tours campus

since last May, but Thomas post
poned a decision until he could get
more information.
The format of the new Paris
program will reduce the number
of students that can attend a pro
gram in France from 140 to 100
per year. In addition, class sizes
will most likely be affected by the
move. In Tours, the classes vary
from between 3 and 11 students,
whereas the classes in Paris are
significantly larger.
The Paris program will focus
on the study of the French lan
guage, while the Tours program
currently focuses on French liter
ature and culture.
"They're going to chuck all
that in the trash for a little cash,"
said Jason Moore, a junior in
product design. Moore said he
chose the one-quarter program in
Tours over the Paris center, which
requires a two-quarter commit
ment, because product design "is
a big and I can't go (to
Paris) unless I pay for another
year at Stanford."
Ralph Hester, the coordinator
of the French Language Program
in Tours, said Stanford is sacrific
ing an atmosphere conducive to
the acquisition of a second lan

guage in favor of the international
atmosphere of Paris, which is not
uniquely French like Tours.
Hester said Stanford is disre
garding its commitment to pro
viding a liberal arts education by
making the acquisition of a lan
guage a secondary goal.
Thomas said last Friday he
believes the cultural richness of
Paris will allow students to expe
rience a broader cross-section of
the world.
"It is a choice which arises fun
damentally out of our strong
belief that Overseas Studies
should seek continually to provide
the most stimulating, challenging
and culturally enriching academic
experiences overseas that it possi
bly can," Thomas said in the fax
sent to Tours.
