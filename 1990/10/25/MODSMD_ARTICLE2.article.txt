# Tours closure met with regret
## Students, faculty question why program was cut 
### Alan Gutman 
TOURS, France â€” Students and faculty at the
Stanford Center in Tours reacted negatively to the
news that the center would be closed because of bud
get cuts at the Center for Overseas Studies.
The campus received a fax last week announcing
the decision by Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas to close the center in favor of a two
tier program in Paris. The move will save the Uni
versity an estimated $120,000 annually, some of
which would be used to strengthen the programs in
Berlin and Kyoto, according to Thomas.
"The choice to close Tours and to open a second
level of the program in Paris is a choice that is a
made in the larger context of decisions about where
Stanford should be sending students to study, and on
what kind of programs," Thomas wrote in the fax.
Junior David Brown, a student in Tours, said he
doesn't understand "the reason for closing a success
ful and established program which fits well with the
community and is very welcome here."
Junior Stephen Hooker, strumming on the cen
ter's guitar, said, "It's a shame to close a program
this cool."
Florence Biscaras, a French student from the
Institut de Torraine who visits the center frequently,

said the Stanford program in Tours is different from
other university's programs because "it is like a fam
ily and provides a place to meet."
Biscaras said she doesn't know what she will do
next year when the center closes. "Maybe the United
States will have one more French immigrant next
year," she said in an unusual switch from French to
English.
Many students and stafT members questioned
why the Tours campus was the only one cut. Tours
has received better marks in the quality of professors
and courses than Berlin, Florence or Oxford, accord
ing to course evaluations given to all overseas stu
dents last year.
Anne Durand, an assistant director of the center,
said it was questionable whether the University
would save any money by shifting the program to
Paris, where families charge double the rent that
families in Tours do. Durand also said Tours was the
least costly campus of its kind.
The city of Tours and the Council of the Indre et
Loire, in an attempt to convince Stanford keep its
Tours center, last week authorized the purchase of
the building that houses the center so that rent
could be kept at a minimum.
