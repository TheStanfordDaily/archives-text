### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf team is
back in town and ready to win at the 27th
Annual Stanford Intercollegiate. Coming
off of a big victory in Seattle last weekend,
the women golfers are hoping to build
their winning record to two.
The Cardinal is led by Audrey Wood
ing, who placed first at the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational in Seattle. Jodi
Figley, voted a preseason first-team Ail-
American, is also a strong contender in
t-hiw tournament. Adele Moore, Stephanie
Davis and Melinda Daniels should add
strength to the team as well.
Playing at home has advantages and
disadvantages for the women. "We know

the course and its little ins and outs," said
Wooding, "but being at school makes it
harder to forget about problem sets and
homework.
"I need to keep concentrating. I've
been very busy with school and haven't
practiced enough lately, so I'll need to rely
on the shots that I've built up over time.
The win at Seattle will also give me a good
boost of confidence."
Davis has mixed feelings about being
back home after a few road trips. "We're
stressed out academically, but once we get
out on the course we'll be fine."
"I played well today, and 1 really want
three consistent rounds," Davis said yes
terday,"I need to put together a solid
tournament as a whole, and playing at
home should be comfortable."

"I want to start off well and stay at
that level," Davis continued. "Improving
every day is also one of my goals, a top-10
individual performance would be great.
"You build up confidence practicing
out there. The weather favors lower
scores and it is more wide open than Seat
tle. We played well as a team in Seattle. If
we put ourselves in a position to win early
on we'll have the confidence from Seattle
to finish with a strong third round. We're
aiming for the team title â€” it would do
wonders for the rest of the season to beat
some of the teams here."
That means defeating No. 1-ranked
Arizona, No. 2 San Jose State and 15
other teams from across the nation.
"There is definitely a stronger field here,
keener competition [than in Seattle],"

said Wooding.
Several of the talented women vying
for an individual victory were named pre
season first-team All-American. Arizona
is led by standout sophomore Debbie
Park. "Debbie is a good player," said
Wooding.
U.S. Amateur champion Pat Hurst will
tee off for San Jose State along with
teammate Tracy Hanson. So far this sea
son, Hanson has won the Lady Buckeye
Tournament at Ohio State and the Shi
seido Cup in Japan.
Kelly Bobbins from Tulsa is "one of
the top amateurs in the world," according
to coach Tim Baldwin.
Jane Eagan from New Mexico State
was also named a first-team Ail-Ameri
can.

Stiff competition should also come
from SMU's Barbara Blackwell who won
the New Mexico Intercollegiate Tourna
ment. UCLA may be a strong contender
as well with Liz Bowman and Debbie Koy
oma at one and two.
"We have outstanding teams and out
standing individuals, said Baldwin,
"Stanford has one of the best courses in
the nation. We've got all the ingredients
for a great tournament."
Play begins today at 8:30 a.m. on the
par-73 course. Stanford will be teeing off
at 10. Other rounds will be Friday and
Saturday. Each team will have the cus
tomary five players, with the best four
out of five scores tallied up.
Seventeen other teams from across the
country have come to Stanford to chal
lenge the No. 3 ranked Cardinal.
