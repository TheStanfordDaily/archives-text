# Women netters open at All-Americas

More of the same.
That is what Stanford's
women's tennis coach Frank
Brennan expects from his players
Oct. 25-28 at the Riviera All-
America Championships, the first
leg of the ITCA Grand Slam. In
1988 the women netters racked
up a 16-1 record against non-team
opponents and in 1989 the Cardi
nal swept the tournament, win
ning both the singles and doubles
championships. To match these
results the netters must turn in
stellar performances this week
end.
The Cardinal has the players
who can dominate the tourna
ment. Five team members quali
fied for the 32-person draw. No. 1
seed Debbie Graham and No. 2
seed Sandra Birch give Stanford a
tremendous 1-2 punch. Birch, the
defending champion, anticipates a
very competitive field facing the
Stanford quintet.
Birch said, "College tennis in
general has a lot of depth."
Birch has altered her game
since winning the tournament
last year. "I added a new shot to
my game," she said. "I'm coming
over my backhand more. I'll use it
in the tournament for better or
worse."
Joining Birch and Graham in
the singles draw are Teri
Whitlinger, Heather Willens and
Laxmi Poruri. Of the Stanford
five Whitlinger has the toughest
first-round match. Whitlinger is
scheduled to play No. 3 seed
Trisha Laux from USC. According
to Brennan, Laux is a dangerous
player, especially now.
"She is a tough kid. She's
tougher in the beginning of the
season," said Brennan.
Willens' and Poruri's first
round opponents are not
pushovers, either. Willens plays
Danielle Scott of Arizona and
Poruri plays UCLA's Iwalani
McCalla. Willens and Poruri,
unlike Graham, Birch and
Whitlinger, qualified for the tour
nament by means other than
being Ail-Americans.
Willens is the home club entry
from Riviera Country Club.
"It's about two minutes from
my house," said Willens. She will
try as use her familiarity with the
area to help her in the national
rankings.
"If I win against a seeded
player I could jump into the rank
ings right away," said Willens, "I'd
be happy if I won two rounds."
Another Cardinal whose ranking
may change as a result of the tour

nament is Poruri.
This year the tournament
offered a freshman wildcard,
which Poruri received because she
is the top-ranked freshman in the
country. According to Brennan
the tournament offered the wild
card to encourage freshman to
stay in college tennis and not turn
professional after one year.
Brennan expects a lot from
Poruri and the rest of the Cardi
nal contingent. According to him
the team is progressing rapidly

"I'm surprised we're playing
this well this early," said Brennan.
If the tournament seeds had been
determined by preseason rankings
Brennan claims, "We could possi
bly be seeded one, two, five and
10."
The netters are also favored in
the doubles draw. Graham and
Birch are the No. 1 seed. Birch
expects the doubles competition to
be tough but believes experience
will give the pair an edge over
newer tandems.

"We've played a lot together,
since Debbie's freshman year ...
and we played together in the
juniors," said Birch. The team of
Graham and Birch is joined in the
doubles draw by another Stanford
duo, No. 4 seed Whitlinger and
Poruri. The Cardinal pairs face
tough competition from the No. 2
seed, Indiana's Stephanie Reece
and Deborah Edelman, and the
No. 3 seed, Jackie Booth and
Monika Waniek from Oklahoma
State.
