They may not have all their
players and they may not have
all their coaches, but the Car
dinal men's volleyball team is
ready to go. The squad, which
should be ranked in the top
five in the preseason poll, will
have a scrimmage tomorrow
afternoon at 3:30 in Burnham
Pavilion. The scrimmage is
open to the public.
Two years ago the Cardinal
men reached the final four for
the first time ever, losing to
UCLA in the championship
match. Last year they were
ranked No. 1 at one point and
finished the season ranked
fourth.
Stanford coach Fred Sturm
has been named the coach of
the U.S. men's National Team,
but will continue to guide the
team until Dec. 1.
Three players off the Cardi

nal squad will not be partici
pating tomorrow, but both
teams will be loaded with tal
ent. Juniors Adam Keefe and
Paul Garrett are currently
practicing with the basketball
team while sophomore Jimmy
Klein is a starting
safety/linebacker for the foot
ball team.
The top players for the Car
dinal this winter will likely be
junior outside hitters Duncan
Blackman and Dsvs Ooss.
Blackman was an honorable
mention Ail-American last
year while Ooss led the team in
In the middle both of the
Cardinal's starters from last
year graduated, but returnees
John Bezmalinovic, John
Hribar and Doug Walquist will
contend for starting spots.
The competition will be
even more intense at setter,
where Parker Blackman grad
