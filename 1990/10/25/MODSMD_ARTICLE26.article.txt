# Closed doors lead to closed minds

Two weeks ago, the Penn
State football team
defeated Syracuse at
home, in itself a result that is
hardly remarkable. After the
game, a reporter from The
Daily Collegian, Penn State's
student newspaper, was denied
access to the Syracuse locker
room because the reporter hap
pened to be a woman. Sadly,
the fact that Suzanne Yohan
nan was the object of such bla
tant discrimination is also
hardly noteworthy today.
Indeed, such incidents have
been so frequent this fall that

Yohannan's story only received
a brief mention in The
National writer Mike Lupica's
column on Sunday, a full week
after the incident. To his
credit, Lupica acidicly con
demned the Syracuse Univer
sity officials for allowing such
an incident to occur.
However, the fact that it did
occur, in light of the Lisa Olson
incident in Boston, makes it all
the more baffling, and disturb
ing, that such discrimination
persists.
Olson, who covers the New
England Patriots for the
Boston Globe, was accosted by
several of the Patriot players
after a game several weeks ago.
Patriot tight end Zeke Mowatt
and several other unnamed
players surrounded Olson in
the locker room as she was
working, taunted her with lewd
gestures and prevented her
from walking away. Patriots
owner Victor Kiam exacerbated
the situation by first support
ing his players and then by
referring to Olson as a "classic
bitch."
As if Mowatt's and Kiam's
behavior were insufficient
proof of the gender discrimina
tion that exists in sports media,
Cincinnati Bengals coach Sam
Wyche, who is always fearful of
missing the asinine band
wagon, barred female reporters
from his team's locker room
shortly after the New England
incident. After the league front
office ordered him to open the
door to all reporters, he did â€”
but cordoned off half of the
locker room with a temporary
curtain, behind which male
reporters could seek interviews
but female reporters couldn't.
Wyche's solution to the
problem of the player's privacy,
which the guilty parties would
liVp you to believe is the central
issue, was still discriminatory.
Had Wyche disallowed all
reporters from going behind
the curtain, then it would not
have been improper. But by
proverbially drawing a line
across which only women
reporters could not step in pur
suit of their stories, he commit
ted another act of gender dis
crimination.
To say that it is an issue of
personal privacy is a gross per
version of the issue. If the play
ers wanted privacy, then no
reporters, men or women,
should be allowed into the
dressing rooms. When the play
ers and coaches allow men into
the locker rooms, then they are
sharing their privacy with men
to the exclusion of women. But
they are certainly not dressing

in private.
The absurdity of the argu
ments in favor of preventing
women reporters from enter
ing locker rooms fortunately
has not been lost on responsi
ble authorities in the NFL.
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
established a commission
headed by a former Watergate
prosecutor to investigate the
Olson incident, but his lack of
response to Kiam's remarks is
disappointing. In response to
Wyche's behavior, Tagliabue
docked a 17th of the oft-fined
Wyche's salary, which report
edly tallies to about $30,000.
Though these stories have
received a responsible amount
of national attention, Suzanne
Yohannan's plight has tragi
cally received almost none even
though it is in my mind the
most disturbing and dangerous
of them all.
To understand why, let me
describe the full incident.
When Yohannan was denied
access to the Syracuse locker
room, she was told that if she
pressed the issue then all of the
sportswriters would be banned
from the locker room. Facing
such a distasteful dilemma,
Yohannan decided to allow her
colleagues to go into the locker
room, a gesture which should
not be lost on them.
The most disturbing part is
that afterward Syracuse Ath
letic Director Jake
Crouthamel, the man with the
authority to prevent such sex
ual harrassment, claimed that
he was just upholding the play
ers' decision.
That, in my mind, is a de
facto approval of gender
discrimination. And given
Crouthamel's authority and
position within Syracuse Uni
versity, approving gender dis
crimination is institutionaliz
ing it.

Cincinnati Bengals
coach Sam Wyche,
who is always fear
ful of missing the
asinine bandwagon,
barred female
reporters from his
team's locker room.

A university, unlike a pro
fessional football team, is not
an organization with the pur
pose of producing a winning
football team. By pandering to
the intolerant attitudes of the
school's football players,
Crouthamel's actions suggests
to me that at Syracuse Univer
sity the priorities are different
than what they should be.
A university by definition
cultivates understanding and,
hopefully, tolerance. By failing
to take a stand against the dis
crimination against Yohannan,
Syracuse University has failed
to fulfill its mission to educate
and eradicate intolerance.
That's the distressing part
about the Suzanne Yohannan
story. The institutionalization
of intolerance, especially by a
university, not only condones it
but propagates it
But as all of these incidents
demonstrate, gender discrimi
nation is rooted deeper in our
society than in just the world of
sports. It can still be found in
our institutions which are
designed to fight it
