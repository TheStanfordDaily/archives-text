# Freshman Redell looking to improve himself, Cardinal
## 
### Kevin Manning 
The last time Stanford football
had a winning season was when
this year's seniors were waiting
for their notices of admission.
Since then improvement has been
subtle if not imperceptible.
According to coach Denny Green,
one area requiring the most
improvement is the pass defense.
Going into Saturday's game at
Oregon, Stanford ranks last in the
Pacific 10 Conference in pass
defense. The Cardinal pass
defense has been conspicuously
deficient on third downs. While
defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
attributes much of this deficiency
to an inadequate pass rush, he
also notes the youth and resultant
inexperience in the pass defense.
For the pass defense to improve,
the younger defensive backs must
individually desire improvement.
Sophomore free safety Ron
Redell is one defensive back
expressing this desire. Although
not yet a starter, he has played in
all of the Cardinal's games this

year as well as five games last sea*
son.
Redell typically enters games
as a nickel back and plays roughly
20 downs per game. He also plays
in some special teams situations.
This season Redell has totaled
seven tackles, one of which was
unassisted. On a third down situ
ation two weeks ago against USC,
he deflected his first pass of the
season. Redell returned an inter
ception 23 yards in his best Cardi
ntd performance to date in this
year's game with Oregon State.
Unsatisfied with his own colle
giate performance, Redell is deter
mined to fulfill the potential that
led such football powers as Notre
Dame and USC to recruit him.
Redell's choice of Stanford over
Notre Dame was largely based on
the fact that he grew up in South
ern California. Redell enjoyed liv
ing in the West and dreamt of win
ning the Rose Bowl. He also devel
oped an interest in the Pac-10,
which he now believes to be the
most competitive collegiate con
ference. Finally, Redell was

impressed with Stanford's new
coaching staff.
Since USC also offered life in
the West, membership in the Pac
-10, and the possibility of a Rose
Bowl victory, Redell was forced to
consider other factors. The Stan

ford coaching staff was again a
factor, as were the experiences of
Redell's youth.
"I saw John Elway play when I
was young and I always dreamed
about being the next John Elway
at Stanford," explains Redell.
Academics were also an impor
tant consideration. While affirm
ing the academic strengths of both
Notre Dame and USC, Redell
judged Stanford academics supe
rior.
"Stanford's academic reputa
tion is the best in the country," he
says.
Redell came to Stanford with
the hope that he would be a quar
terback. Upon his arrival, how
ever, he promptly switched to
defensive back.
"They recruited me as an ath
lete — quarterback and defensive
back," he states. "I wasn't sure
what role I was going to play on
the team."
With numerous injuries among
the Cardinal defensive backs, the
coaching staff presented Redell
with the option of being one of

many backup quarterbacks or of
seeing playing time in the defen
sive secondary. The potential for
playing time was the deciding fac
tor.
The new focus on a defensive
role, combined with the general
adjustment to college ball faced by
every freshman, caused Redell's
confidence to sink, which in turn
resulted in tentative play.
After the interception against
Oregon State this year, however,
Redell's confidence has risen.
Now, Redell looks toward further
improvement, including the
assumption of a leadership role.
"Leaders are the ones who win
the ball games," maintains Redell.
Green echoes this attitude.
"We must have outstanding
leadership," the coach said before
the season. "And that does not
have to come from the older play
ers.
To command respect, any
leader must be at the top of his
game. Accordingly, Redell concen
trates on specific goals that will
make him a better player.

"The whole thing about foot
ball is staying focused during the
game," says Redell. "Stay focused
and don't make any mistakes."
Redell also concentrates on
making big plays and playing
sound football. Specifically, he is a
believer in the coaching staffs
motto of "alignment, assignment
and adjustment." In this frame
work, the first step is to assess the
offensive formation and align
accordingly. The second stage
entails knowledge of one's individ
ual assignment within the appli
cable defensive strategy. Finally,
in the adjustment stage, the
player reacts to offensive changes
that occur at the line of scrim
mage.
After the execution of these
three stages, Redell moves into
one of his own design — aggres
siveness. He believes that aggres
siveness both stops the offense
and initiates big plays. Ideally this
will lead to winning, the ultimate
goal of Redell and his teammates.

Since USC also offered life in
the West, membership in the Pac
-10, and the possibility of a Rose
Bowl victory, Redell was forced to
consider other factors. The Stan

ford coaching staff was again a
factor, as were the experiences of
Redell's youth.
"I saw John Elway play when I
was young and I always dreamed
about being the next John Elway
at Stanford," explains Redell.
Academics were also an impor
tant consideration. While affirm
ing the academic strengths of both
Notre Dame and USC, Redell
judged Stanford academics supe
rior.
"Stanford's academic reputa
tion is the best in the country," he
says.
Redell came to Stanford with
the hope that he would be a quar
terback. Upon his arrival, how
ever, he promptly switched to
defensive back.
"They recruited me as an ath
lete — quarterback and defensive
back," he states. "I wasn't sure
what role I was going to play on
the team."
With numerous injuries among
the Cardinal defensive backs, the
coaching staff presented Redell
with the option of being one of

many backup quarterbacks or of
seeing playing time in the defen
sive secondary. The potential for
playing time was the deciding fac
tor.
The new focus on a defensive
role, combined with the general
adjustment to college ball faced by
every freshman, caused Redell's
confidence to sink, which in turn
resulted in tentative play.
After the interception against
Oregon State this year, however,
Redell's confidence has risen.
Now, Redell looks toward further
improvement, including the
assumption of a leadership role.
"Leaders are the ones who win
the ball games," maintains Redell.
Green echoes this attitude.
"We must have outstanding
leadership," the coach said before
the season. "And that does not
have to come from the older play
ers.
To command respect, any
leader must be at the top of his
game. Accordingly, Redell concen
trates on specific goals that will
make him a better player.

"The whole thing about foot
ball is staying focused during the
game," says Redell. "Stay focused
and don't make any mistakes."
Redell also concentrates on
making big plays and playing
sound football. Specifically, he is a
believer in the coaching staffs
motto of "alignment, assignment
and adjustment." In this frame
work, the first step is to assess the
offensive formation and align
accordingly. The second stage
entails knowledge of one's individ
ual assignment within the appli
cable defensive strategy. Finally,
in the adjustment stage, the
player reacts to offensive changes
that occur at the line of scrim
mage.
After the execution of these
three stages, Redell moves into
one of his own design — aggres
siveness. He believes that aggres
siveness both stops the offense
and initiates big plays. Ideally this
will lead to winning, the ultimate
goal of Redell and his teammates.

The last time Stanford football
had a winning season was when
this year's seniors were waiting
for their notices of admission.
Since then improvement has been
subtle if not imperceptible.
According to coach Denny Green,
one area requiring the most
improvement is the pass defense.
Going into Saturday's game at
Oregon, Stanford ranks last in the
Pacific 10 Conference in pass
defense. The Cardinal pass
defense has been conspicuously
deficient on third downs. While
defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
attributes much of this deficiency
to an inadequate pass rush, he
also notes the youth and resultant
inexperience in the pass defense.
For the pass defense to improve,
the younger defensive backs must
individually desire improvement.
Sophomore free safety Ron
Redell is one defensive back
expressing this desire. Although
not yet a starter, he has played in
all of the Cardinal's games this

year as well as five games last sea*
son.
Redell typically enters games
as a nickel back and plays roughly
20 downs per game. He also plays
in some special teams situations.
This season Redell has totaled
seven tackles, one of which was
unassisted. On a third down situ
ation two weeks ago against USC,
he deflected his first pass of the
season. Redell returned an inter
ception 23 yards in his best Cardi
ntd performance to date in this
year's game with Oregon State.
Unsatisfied with his own colle
giate performance, Redell is deter
mined to fulfill the potential that
led such football powers as Notre
Dame and USC to recruit him.
Redell's choice of Stanford over
Notre Dame was largely based on
the fact that he grew up in South
ern California. Redell enjoyed liv
ing in the West and dreamt of win
ning the Rose Bowl. He also devel
oped an interest in the Pac-10,
which he now believes to be the
most competitive collegiate con
ference. Finally, Redell was

impressed with Stanford's new
coaching staff.
