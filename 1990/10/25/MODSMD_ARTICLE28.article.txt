## THE

In 1968, Louis Abolafia ran for pres
ident as the "nudist party" candidate.
Today, Abolafia is still involved /
with the nudist party. Only this /
party is in San Francisco — and f /
it's called the Exotic Erotic Ball. I f
lb dub the Abolafia-produced I I
event a "nudist" party isn't exactly \ \
accurate, however Real nudists are \ \
generally too respectable to traipse V
around in the body paint, vegetables \
and chiffon that is typical Ball wean V
Ball spokespeople deny the event is \
"sleazy," though. The point of the cha
rade is, of course, to titillate, to shock
and to amuse. Yet "It's a shame that
people call it" a parade of /
_ pimps and prostitutes /
{/*> in their street garb, /
f *1 spokesperson Jeffrey / /
Nead says. / \
"It's just people having a\ V
laugh, a bit o' fun," Nead contin- \
ues in his clipped British accent. V
"It's not an orgy."
And as co-producer Perry Mann
quips, it's "a place where ... people can
really let their inhibitions go and
become someone else for one night."
Tbxas televangelist Larry Lea received
an invitation to "be someone else" at
the ball after he publicized plans
to muster his "troops" in
the Bay Area for an
all out assault
against the x
"forces of r
evil."

Buck Naked
and the Bare
Bottom Boys,
X and Ecstasy in

/ Motion, a Las Vegas
style burlesque act, are two Exotic Erot
ic performing groups that may have met
their match in "General" Lea.
Lea seems the more likely candidate
to meet his Gettysburg, however if
the sin-and-conviction rate of tele
n. vangelists indicates anything.
\ But for most Ball-goers, it will
\ be a chance at a night in the
l \ spotlight, even if they have to
V share it with 9,000 others.
\ j "Everybody's a star," Nead
j/ explains. "That's the concept."
/ Those who can't relate to this
/ late '70s Discotheque philosophy of
universal stardom, however; might find
Scream and Sugar a little more hip.
"It attracts a very fashionable crowd,"
says spokesperson Jeff Diamond. Par
y tygoers "wear things you
X. and I wouldn't even
X\ think of," he
• \ explains.
\ X "They
\ dress to
\ the

nines, they shop at exclusive boutiques,
they live a fast life."
Scream and Sugar is co-produced by
Glas-Haus and Do Not Sit (on the furni
ture), popular underground party orga
nizers.
As "underground" clubs, Glas-Haus
and Do Not Sit parties "float around"
from warehouses to penthouses and
beyond, instead of taking place at the
same location every time.
Mobility, it seems, keeps Glas-Haus
and Do Not Sit in vogue with the 1000
or so regular guests, who are used to —
and demand — a spectacle.
"It's a dance party that specializes in
theatrics," Diamond says."The [guests)
are interested in art ana culture."
The art and culture that will
appear this Saturday
include a 25-foot
high dancing
puppet, and
the Ethel Mer
man Memori
al Choir
singing a
medley of her
showtunes.
These
acts, Diamond
says, are "some
thing on stage"
„ that doesn't inter
fere with the
evening's primary
foci — fashion, and
~ dancing to music pro
grammed by Live 105
D.J. Steve Masters.
Another Live 105 D.J.,
Rob Francis, will be fea
tured at The Cutting
Edge Dance Party in
Santa Clara. For
those who

are "saving it"for 'W
Stanford's Exotic
Erotic Ball, or anyone
who doesn't want to
dress to impress, this
party should be a com
fortable alternative.

A two-person camera crew will rove
throughout Grand Ballroom of the Santa
Clara Marriott projecting larger-than
life images of dancers on a pair of video
screens. Clearly, American Bandstand
has entered the video era.
In another room a psychedelic haunt
ed acid house can be found, as well as
linen-covered tables laden with roast
turkey and meat, vegetables and
cheeses. Six cash-only bars with theme
drinks will also be scattered about, and
discount hotel rooms — $65 a night for
up to four guests — are available for
drinking guests.
Guests are "going to be more or less
college students," promoter Bill McKay

adds, "and
[will] make
McKay, a student lj

University, takes pride IJ
in his company, MINT V J
Promotions, for its abil- V
ity to create this sort of Vj
custom event, especially V
outside of San Francisco 1
where night life is often 1
lacking.
Says McKay, "There's
nothing in comparison."
