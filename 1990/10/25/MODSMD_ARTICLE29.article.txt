Night of the Living Dead
Tony Dodd, Patricia Towlman
Grade: B+
Not since Sam Raimi's "The
Evil Dead" has a horror film been
so relentlessly and intelligently
terrifying as Tom Savini's remake
of "Night of the Living Dead."
George Romero made the orig
inal zombie film in 1969, which
has since achieved "classic" sta
tus, according to some critics.
It was a black and white pic
ture that horrified audiences
because it was so unpredictable
and energetic. Lack of a budget
forced the makers to rely on their
own creativity rather than the
genre's established cliches.
Returning 20 years later with
much more money (but the same
screenplay and enthusiasm) is
Tom Savini, who was the make
up artist in the original.
Although a remake at this
point seems a bit premature,

Savini retells the story faithfully.
The result, in color and drenched
in the latest gore technology is
more than frightening.
The story is simple — seven
people lock themselves in an
abandoned house after narrowly
escaping a troupe of the living
dead. The corpses have emerged
from the graveyards of rural
America for no apparent reason, i
And while they are slow, lethargic J
and dazed, their sheer numbers I
make them virtually inescapable. I
The seven survivors must thinkS
of a way to avoid the
dead and flee the town.
Most of the story takes placed
in one house on one night,
the danger of a film like this
that it can become boring andfl
pedestrian in a matter of
utes.
But Romero's screenplay iH
clever, witty and fast-paced. Thfl
film plunges into a frightful
sequence before the sun goes down
and the opening credits roll. From
there it weaves through its plot
smoothly, using every moment to
build suspense.
The make-up effects are first
rate, and paired with innovative
cinematography, they come across
as even more realistic. The
"undead" themselves are easily
"killed" with one bullet to the
brain. However their sheer num
bers make them unstoppable.
The scenario of seven people
trapped in a house and a bad situa
tion is milked for all its dramatic
tension — these characters are not
horror movie bozos, but smart,
desperate people who use ideas to
survive, not just weapons. They
argue and fight as they decide how
to escape, and their disagreements
seem genuine to the plot.
Most horror films would dis
miss dialogue and focus on gore.
"Night of the Living Dead" is intel
ligent enough to give equal atten
tion to both — and the result is a
very potent mixture of horror and
humor.
