# Anticipating the Big One:
## New University report urges quake planning 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Without warning, the San Andreas fault
line slips 10 miles northwest of Stanford.
After frantic moments of violent shaking,
several University buildings suffer thou
sands of dollars in damage and a number of
people on campus are killed.
The University is suddenly not able to
communicate with the rest of the Bay Area,
thrown into confusion following an earth
quake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter
scale.
While this scenario is probably not what
many survivors of last year's Loma Prieta
earthquake want to contemplate, a group of
Stanford disaster planners has already
envisioned this scene in a recently released
report. The planners highlight what they
say are the University's most pressing
tasks in preparing for the "Big One."
The final report represents one of the
many ways University administrators have
tried to prompt people at Stanford to con
sider what can happen during another
mqjor quake and to prepare for such a dis
aster.
The 12-page report, prepared by the
Earthquake Risk Management Commis
sion, is scheduled to be presented next week
to University President Donald Kennedy
and other campus administrators for their
final approval.
The commission, chaired by Police Chief
Marvin Herrington, Asst. Provost for Plan
ning and Management John Hughes and
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh Shah, high
lights two main tasks that face University
deans and vice presidents as they prepare
for the next big earthquake — a quake
which disaster planners said would "change
the context in which (the University) oper
ates."
First, administrators should prepare
their departments with local emergency
plans. Second, they should secure poten
tially hazardous objects, such as bookcases
and chemicals, from falling.
These two main recommendations
should be completed by August 1991 and
will prepare the campus for another earth
quake as well as help the University get

back on its feet, according
to the report's editors.
Planners say they hope,
with the aid of their recom
mendations, that the Uni
versity could resume rea
sonably normal procedures
within one week of another
meyor earthquake.
The emergency plans that
individual departments

devise should not be "anything terribly
complicated," Hughes said. He said the
plans should include such basics as where
to meet after an earthquake and who will
be responsible for rescue duties.
The disaster planners said departments
will not have to pay for these preparations.
Falling contents in buildings can pose a
greater risk than falling buildings them
selves, according to the report. Eliminating
the threat of falling books, computer equip
ment or dangerous chemicals "is the most
cost effective way to reduce risk to the com
munity," the report states.
The University has set up a fund of
about $500,000 to help department heads
ensure that shelving and lofting is secure,
said Tom Mcßride, director of Environmen
tal Health and Safety. Some department
heads say they are willing to begin work on
securing items in buildings, but complain
that the University is not providing enough
money.
The report also recommends that:
• The Public Safety department should
complete revision of the University Emer
gency Operations Plan by January 1991;
• Deans and vice presidents should see
that copies of important documents or
records are made, and
• Facilities Project Management should
continue the program of strengthening or
replacing all buildings that pose a safety
risk.
While the commission has finished its
work and expects strong backing from
Kennedy, members say they wonder if
department heads will follow the report's
recommendations.
Herrington said convincing people to


Hughes
prepare for another earthquake is
"probably like going to a safety
lecture: it's good for you, but bor
ing as heck."
As if to assure department
heads that preparing for another
earthquake is not an empty exer
cise, a section of the report reads:
"The inevitability of a substan
tially damaging earthquake is a
reality in the Bay Area."
In a report released in July,
geologists at the United States
Geological Survey in Menlo Park
said there is a 67 percent chance
in the next 30 years of another
earthquake in the Bay Area of
equal or greater in magnitude
than Loma Prieta, and probably
with its epicenter closer to Stan
ford.
One section of the University's
report details the short-term
effects of such a quake.
For example, in order to
accommodate the reduction in
available room space, the class
room schedule would be extended
from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday
through Saturday.
Most private homes would suf
fer five to 15 percent damage.
Several mcyor research buildings
would be closed. And stress would
be evident throughout the com
munity.
