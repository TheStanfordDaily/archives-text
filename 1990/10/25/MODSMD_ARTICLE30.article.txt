# Humoring us: Bennett's Cavalcade assembles top line-up of stand-ups
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
For Bay Area radio personality Alex Ben
nett, the third time really is a charm.
After three years hosting a morning enter
tainment show at KITS, popularly known as
Live 105, Bennett was fired from the station,
moved to a station in Miami, "parted ways"
with the Florida station after three months
and returned to re-negotiate an arrangement
with Live 105.
Now that he's back on his home station,
he has assembled his "Third Almost
Annual" Cavalcade of Comedy show — a
four-hour firing line of comedians that will
entertain an outdoor crowd Saturday at
Stanford's own Frost Amphitheater.
Despite the year off, Bennett has assem
bled what he called "pound for pound" his
best show yet. "These performers all have
pretty seasoned talent. There are no 'up and
coming' comedians," Bennett said in an
interview Monday.

Headlining the show is no-holds-barred
comedian Bobby Slayton, who Bennett
described as the "best stand-up in America"
and"the most risk-taking comedian today."
Without using gimmicks or imitations, Slay
ton just delivers line after line. "He just
stands up there and makes you laugh," Ben
nett said.
The heavily Bay Area-represented lineup
also features Kevin Pollak, Will Durst, War
ren Thomas, Sue Murphy, Tbm Kenny,
David Feldman and Matt Weinhold.
Many of the comedians have been fea
tured on Bennett's morning show, and some
are close personal friends. "They are comedi
ans that I like, not only as comedians but as
friends," Bennett said.
The strength of the Cavalcade show rests
in the traditionally strong comedy pool in
San Francisco, which Bennett said rivaled
Boston as the biggest producer of talent in
the 1980s. As a "Dig developer of talent," San
Francisco's industry benefits from everybody
"working together and feeding off each

other."
Recent trends, though, such as the elimi
nation of open mike nights at most clubs,
worry Bennett about the ability to maintain
that talent pool.
On his radio show, Bennett offers his own
forum for the Bay Area's comedic talent.
Insisting that the show is not a "talk show,"
Bennett described it as "intensive on-the-air
original humor." Whereas other morning
shows focus on the hosts and "rent comedy
bits from a service," Bennett always has sev
eral guests — comedians and otherwise.
"We really put on a show. We do it the
hard way," Bennett said.
In the early 1980s, Bennett had a show on
FM 99.7, "The Quake," which featured
"early morning obits" and surprise appear
ances by Robin Williams and the minds
behind Monty Python. Despite such memo
rable mornings, Bennett said his current
show is better — with as many memorable
mornings and several fewer lackluster
shows.

"We've nailed down a way of doing it,"he
explained.
Bennett occasionally gets into trouble by
making light of subjects too sensitive for
most, but he insisted that he doesn't get into
trouble often. "When I do get in trouble, it's
because (people) don't realize it's entertain
ment."
Bennett also said he realizes that comedy
necessarily means being offensive on occa
sion. "Comedy's only politically correct
when it's not comedy," Bennett said. "Com
edy's basically a nice way of saying 'F— you.'
But that's obviously not tne purpose of
Saturday's event. As Bennett explained, "We
want to provide people with the best after
noon of comedy possible. We want to let peo
ple laugh and let them have a good after
noon. If we do that, I'm happy."

Tickets for the Cavalcade of Comedy,
which also includes music by John Firman
and the Johnny Nocturne Band, are avail
able at the Tresidder Ticket Office.
