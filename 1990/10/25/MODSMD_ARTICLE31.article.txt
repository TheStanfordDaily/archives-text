Catch the Trick - Cheap
Some bands are just meant to be seen live. Cheap Trick, despite
having several strong albums, is one of those bands. Where else
could you witness Rick Nielsen's expansive designer guitar collec
tion? From the five-necked monstrosity to the brightly colored
instrument made in Nielsen's own image, the flamboyant gui
tarist's collection teams with his stage antics to provide a most
enjoyable show. All that, and an opening performance by the
Riverdogs, can be yours for only $6 plus separate park admission at
Great America in Santa Clara at 7 p.m. Sunday. It's also the last day
the theme park is open, so make it an all-day affair.
Jumpin' Jazz news flash
For the next 11 days, sax will be easy to come by. The Eighth
Annual San Francisco Jazz Festival begins tonight with a tribute to
Count Basie aboard Hornblower Yachts' stately "City of San
Francisco." Featuring several accomplished jazz musicians, the fes
tival will bring its beat to the City through Sunday, Nov. 4. For more
information, call 864-5449.
