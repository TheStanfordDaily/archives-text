## Elliots' 'Get a Life' pure fun, silliness 
### 
"The Guy from Under the Seats" is back —
and this time he even brought his dad.
Also known as "The Fugitive Guy," "The
Panicky Guy" and Marlon Brando on "Late
Night with David Letterman," Chris Elliot and
his father Bob, of the famous comedy team of
Bob and Ray, return to TV this fall in their very
own show — Fox's "Get a Life" (Sundays at
8:30).
For Elliot afficianados like myself, "Get a
Life" is a dream come true. Filling a gap between
hit Fox comedies "In Living Colo?' and "Married
... with Children," "Life" is a half hour of
Elliot's ridiculous situational humor, facial
expressions and general silliness.
Admittedly, the show is stupid. But think
back a couple of years. If you are one of the mil
lions who laughed at Elliot as an obese Marlon
Brando dancing around a pile of bananas on Late
Night, there may be something in "Life" for you.
Elliot plays Chris Peterson, an overgrown
teenager who has merely traded acne for a spare
tire and love handles. Chris lives with his par
ents — the source of a number of witty father
son exchanges between the Elliots — and holds
a job in the lucrative field of newspaper delivery.
Among other wacky situations, Chris has
been stuck upside-down on a roller coaster for
eight hours and has attempted to set the record
for having, the most weight piled on him, as was
the case last Sunday.
Trying to raise money to save the public park
he played in as a "kid," Chris agrees to let people
from the town stack things on him in exchange
for a donation to the cause.
Trust me when I say I can't do the situation
justice, but Elliot's groans and facial expressions
are Emmy material.
The humor is admittedly inane — with gobs
of canned laughter coming for a redneck who
throws a 300 lb. tractor tire on the "pile of
death" and a Tom Jones rip-off who does a
lounge act from atop the precipice — but this
isn't Masterpiece Theater.
Although I am admittedly biased (I am prob
ably the only person you'll ever meet who owns
a Chris Elliot t-shirt), believe me when I say
Elliot's own unique brand of "comedy" makes
"Get a Life" worth watching.
