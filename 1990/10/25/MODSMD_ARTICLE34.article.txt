# Sex, pageantry and the college ratings war

"REMEMBER, FOLKS, second place
is important. In the event that the win
ner appears in Penthouse, the first run
ner-up will take over And the winner is
... Harvard University!"
As we're all aware, the U.S. News
and World Report Annual Collegiate
Beauty Pageant was just held. Ana our
performance this time was noticeably
Detter than last year's feeble finish.
For the past two years, we have hung
our heads in shame, casting furtive
glances at other schools, hoping no one
would recognize us in our defeat. It was
frustrating. It was humiliating. It was
damaging to our job chances after grad
uation.
Worse, it seemed to be a vicious cir
cle. We hit rock bottom at last year's
celebratory Post-Pageant Ball. We were
wallflowers slumping at the sidelines as
high school seniors fought over the five
schools clearly more Deautiful than
ours. Yale was radiant that evening and
never stopped dancing.
But we can remember a time when
the Pageant was different from the way
it is now. Back in '87, contestants were
judged on one criterion and one alone.
It's the same one that really matters
today, but back then they weren't afraid
to say it: raw sex appeal.
And we won. Hands down. Three
years in a row. Our tanned and glisten

ing school showed plenty of skin, even
in winter We were vibrant and youth
ful, not even 100 years old.
And we didn't have the annoying dis
traction of living in an exciting college
town like Cambridge or Berkeley (or . ..
New Haven?).
But these days, the Pageant organiz
ers are putting on airs. They're adding
so-called "objective criteria" to legit
imize this carnal contest. The public is
confused by this new stance. Many
wonder if they're actually supposed to
take the Pageant seriously now
In the new and improved Pageant,
there are five categories, and each con
testant is now required to do more than
just smile prettily.
Considering the added strain, Stan
ford does pretty well in most of these
categories. We've made heaps of
progress since 1989. Those of us who
were here through the Dark Years can
easily recognize the vast differences that
distinguish a sixth-ranked university
from a Number TWo. But, with all the
progress, why aren't we No. 1 ?
Our rating in the "financial
resources" category is exemplary, but
that should not be surprising. Our cup
runneth over with the nectar of indirect
costs. (Incidentally, an internal audit
found no shadiness in our financial
dealings with the feds. Now, there's a

surprise. We kind of expected a full con
fession.)
Where Stanford really loses is in the
"student satisfaction" department,
where we finished 11th.
That means, if you were lined up in
order with one student from every other
university, you would be only the 11 th
happiest one there.
Could be worse, though. At least you
could see the Dartmouth representative
at the head of the line (Wait. Dart
mouth?) If you were a Berkeley Golden
Bear, you might be able to crane your
neck and see Jane Smith of the Univer
sity of Rochester (18 places ahead of
you) from your position at number
(ahem) 52.
Still, if we could just bump that sat
isfaction index up a little bit, it could
push us over the top.
Hramra . .. let's see. What could we
do? How about dating? Nah. Let's try
and keep this realistic.
A simple solution would be to cut
away all the fat, axing anything that
makes students unhappy. Maybe we
should get rid of classes. Oh, it really
doesn't matter what we do, as long as
we get happy in time for next year's
contest.
Because we'll win in 1991. Damn it,
we only need one-tenth of a point to
catch Harvard, anyway. How hard can it

be? By '87 rules, we would have won
already. That's because we're back on
top in the original category, the one
important category: "academic reputa
tion" (a.k.a. "sex appeal").
We think the '89 earthquake
clinched this one for us. What other
university can boast of a population of
highly motivated pre-professionals who
willingly risk their lives each day in the
pursuit of finer automobiles?
Stanford will truly be a formidable
contender in the 1991 Pageant. Then
again, in some sense, we shouldn't be
stumbling over something this minor
Maybe next year we shouldn't even
bother entering.

ford does pretty well in most of these
categories. We've made heaps of
progress since 1989. Those of us who
were here through the Dark Years can
easily recognize the vast differences that
distinguish a sixth-ranked university
from a Number TWo. But, with all the
progress, why aren't we No. 1 ?
Our rating in the "financial
resources" category is exemplary, but
that should not be surprising. Our cup
runneth over with the nectar of indirect
costs. (Incidentally, an internal audit
found no shadiness in our financial
dealings with the feds. Now, there's a

surprise. We kind of expected a full con
fession.)
Where Stanford really loses is in the
"student satisfaction" department,
where we finished 11th.
That means, if you were lined up in
order with one student from every other
university, you would be only the 11 th
happiest one there.
Could be worse, though. At least you
could see the Dartmouth representative
at the head of the line (Wait. Dart
mouth?) If you were a Berkeley Golden
Bear, you might be able to crane your
neck and see Jane Smith of the Univer
sity of Rochester (18 places ahead of
you) from your position at number
(ahem) 52.
Still, if we could just bump that sat
isfaction index up a little bit, it could
push us over the top.
Hramra . .. let's see. What could we
do? How about dating? Nah. Let's try
and keep this realistic.
A simple solution would be to cut
away all the fat, axing anything that
makes students unhappy. Maybe we
should get rid of classes. Oh, it really
doesn't matter what we do, as long as
we get happy in time for next year's
contest.
Because we'll win in 1991. Damn it,
we only need one-tenth of a point to
catch Harvard, anyway. How hard can it

be? By '87 rules, we would have won
already. That's because we're back on
top in the original category, the one
important category: "academic reputa
tion" (a.k.a. "sex appeal").
We think the '89 earthquake
clinched this one for us. What other
university can boast of a population of
highly motivated pre-professionals who
willingly risk their lives each day in the
pursuit of finer automobiles?
Stanford will truly be a formidable
contender in the 1991 Pageant. Then
again, in some sense, we shouldn't be
stumbling over something this minor
Maybe next year we shouldn't even
bother entering.

"REMEMBER, FOLKS, second place
is important. In the event that the win
ner appears in Penthouse, the first run
ner-up will take over And the winner is
... Harvard University!"
As we're all aware, the U.S. News
and World Report Annual Collegiate
Beauty Pageant was just held. Ana our
performance this time was noticeably
Detter than last year's feeble finish.
For the past two years, we have hung
our heads in shame, casting furtive
glances at other schools, hoping no one
would recognize us in our defeat. It was
frustrating. It was humiliating. It was
damaging to our job chances after grad
uation.
Worse, it seemed to be a vicious cir
cle. We hit rock bottom at last year's
celebratory Post-Pageant Ball. We were
wallflowers slumping at the sidelines as
high school seniors fought over the five
schools clearly more Deautiful than
ours. Yale was radiant that evening and
never stopped dancing.
But we can remember a time when
the Pageant was different from the way
it is now. Back in '87, contestants were
judged on one criterion and one alone.
It's the same one that really matters
today, but back then they weren't afraid
to say it: raw sex appeal.
And we won. Hands down. Three
years in a row. Our tanned and glisten

ing school showed plenty of skin, even
in winter We were vibrant and youth
ful, not even 100 years old.
And we didn't have the annoying dis
traction of living in an exciting college
town like Cambridge or Berkeley (or . ..
New Haven?).
But these days, the Pageant organiz
ers are putting on airs. They're adding
so-called "objective criteria" to legit
imize this carnal contest. The public is
confused by this new stance. Many
wonder if they're actually supposed to
take the Pageant seriously now
In the new and improved Pageant,
there are five categories, and each con
testant is now required to do more than
just smile prettily.
Considering the added strain, Stan
ford does pretty well in most of these
categories. We've made heaps of
progress since 1989. Those of us who
