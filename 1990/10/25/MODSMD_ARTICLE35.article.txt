# Graduate scores Peninsula Ballet's production
## 
### Margaret Fitzpatrick 
The world premiere of "Maxfield Par
rish — A Love Story" will open the 19th
season of the Peninsula Ballet Theatre
this weekend.
Stanford alumna Susan Mazer and
her husband Dallas Smith composed
the score for this work, which is based
on die romance between the American
artist Parrish and his model, Sue Lewin.
Parrish produced most of his vision
ary creations early in this century. He
was fascinated by fairy tales and
expressed this through such paintings
as "Pied Piper," and "Old King Cole."

His work is widely accessible, inspiring
in many a childlike delight.
Alma Gilbert, world-renowned
authority on Parrish and author of the
newly-released book "The Make Believe
World of Maxfield Parrish and Sue
Lewin," is serving as consultant for the
ballet. Stanford alumna Anne Rosen
berg portrays the artist's wife Lydia.
Parrish is offered tribute through an
unusual fusion of dance, music and
visual arts. Slides of his original works
are projected onto a scrim representing
the artist's studio.
Inspiration for Rosine Bena's chore
ography seems to flow directly from Par

rish's creations as the images of the
paintings fade while the company of 30
dancers brings them to lite. They
metamorphose themselves from
tableaux vivants of the paintings into
dynamic new interpretations of them.
The musicians, visible to the audi
ence, accompany these transformations
with what composer Mazer describes as
"a blend of pure acoustics and fantasy."
The score, featuring electro-acoustic
harp, electric wind instruments, and
percussion, "stretches the genre, giving
us access to an audience that might not
expect to like our music," Mazer said.

Coming from a strictly classical
background at Stanford, Mazer feels
that this composition gives entrance to
a technology that might not otherwise
gain acceptance in the world of ballet.

The album is being released this week
end and will be available at the perfor
mances. The theater is located at 600
North Delaware, San Mateo. Show
times are 8 p.m. on Saturday and 2:30
p.m. on Sunday. Tickets are available
at the Peninsula or CAPA Box Offices,
333 South B Street, San Mateo. For
