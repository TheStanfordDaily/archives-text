Elektra Records (various artists)
Grade: B
Performing a cover version of an old
song is dangerous for any band. Attempts
to mimic the original style inevitably fall
short; in contrast, "creative" deviations
(often called "reinterpretations") are often
destined for failure.
But Elektra Records has always been
one of rock music's most adventuresome
labels. "Rubdiyat," a two-disc compila
tion of tracks in celebration of the label's
40th anniversary, is no exception. 39 cur
rent Elektra artists reinterpret the label's
old hits, creating over 150 minutes of
strictly cover versions.
"Rubdiydt" may be lacking in creativ
ity, but its tracks are definitely interest
ing, and some songs actually sound good.
As expected, the better tracks are usually
done by the more experienced artists.
The Cure opens the work with The
Doors' "Hello I Love You," but solid
musical backgrounds fail to overcome
Robert Smith's quivering vocals. TYacy
Chapman does a surprisingly peppy ver
sion of Glenn Yarbrough's "House of the
Rising Sun." Jackson Browne does a mel
low acoustic version of "First Girl I
Loved" right before Natalie Merchant and

10,000 Maniacs does Browne's "These
Days."
Anita Baker's smooth voice comple
ments Carly Simon's "You Belong to Me."
and Howard Jones piano and vocals
shines on David Ackles' "Road lb Cairo."
Some of Elektra's newer artists do good
jobs, as well. The Black Velvet Band, Pix
ies, Happy Mondays, Sara Hickman, The
Beautiful South and They Might Be
Giants contribute solid tracks.
But when "Rubdiydt" is bad, it's very,
very bad. Tfeddv Pendergrass and Linda
Ronstadt should know better than to
cover their contributions with sappy
vocals. The Sugarcubes whine througn
"Motorcycle Mama," and Big F, Metallica
an<s the Havalinas all contribute raucous
tracks with ridiculous, screaming vocals.
And the Eagles, one of the finest bands
of their decade, are snubbed twice;
Howard Hewett sounds like a wispy
Michael Jackson on "I Can't Tfell You
Why," and Gypsy Kings turns "Hotel Cal
ifornia" into a pathetic mariachi farce,
singing the whole song in Spanish. No
wonder why the Eagles are reforming.
As an anniversary present, "Rubdiydt"
is like an old appliance? sometimes it
works, sometimes it doesn't. Behind all of
the packaging lies just another sampler.
