8.8. King
Live at San Quentin
Grade: A-
Most likely, you missed 8.8. King's
most recent Bay Area appearance. After
performing at the Circle Star Center last
spring, King went up to Marin County
and performed two free concerts for the
inmates of San Quentin Prison.
But don't worry, King fansj the two
concerts were recorded and released as
King's most recent album.
"Live from San Quentin" continues
the tradition of King's live recordings
from penal institutions, which began
with the 1970 "8.8. King Live in Cook
County Jail."
Of the 13 tracks, all but two are King
standards from previous albums that the
performer uses to please crowds all over
the world. Tracks such as "Everyday I
Sing the Blues," "The Thrill is Gone" and
"Nobody Loves Me But My Mother" pro
vide a thorough showcase for King's
vocals and guitar talents.
King's vocals are as clear and strong as
blues fans have come to expect, and the
guitar work comes through nicely,
though the tone of his guitar Lucille
seems harsher than it has been on previ
ous works.
This album differs considerably from
King's previous "King of the Blues," as the

energy level is considerably higher and
only one song was written for the album.
The back-up band does a good job
keeping up with King, and Walter King
ana Eugene Carrier get some quality
solos in themselves, although some
tracks seemed to be pushed too fast.
King's dialogue with the all-male prison
crowd also provides some humorous
moments.
Although it would have been nice to
see some more new material, the purpose
of this album is to entertain — and it suc
ceeds.
Dedicated King fans can look forward
to a box set being assembled for 1991
release by MCA, which will feature "rare,
unreleased tracks, along with classic
favorites."

Step" had just earned him a Grammy for
best contemporary blues recording, left
many musicians and fans mourning his
demise.
"Family Style" is a collaboration of
Stevie Ray and his brother limmie
Vaughan (the former guitarist of the
Fabulous Thunderbirds). The two wrote
most of the tracks and recorded them last
spring in a Dallas studio.
Although both brothers play distinc
tive Texas blues, their prior works have
different styles and the tracks on this disc
alternate between the two, and a few are
"fun" tracks of the brothers just jamming
and talking.
Stevie Ray's most distinctive offerings
are "Hard to Be" and "Long Way from
Home," which are cut in the same mold
as his best previous work. Jimmie's
tracks aren't similar to his Fabulous T-
Bird work, but "White Boots" features his
smoother vocals and more deliberate gui
tar style.
"Hillbillies from Outerspace" and
"Brothers" are tracks that only brothers
would try, and such works help make the
disc lena to the family feeling of the disc.
Nothing revolutionary, just two brothers
having a good time.
