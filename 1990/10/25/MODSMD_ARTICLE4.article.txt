# Proceeds from earthquake sale to fund geology expedition to Europe
## 
### Alex Hoye Staff writer 
Although Geology Corner was devas
tated in last year's earthquake, about 20
Earth Sciences graduate students will
find cause to celebrate next September —
in the Alps.
A student trip to the Alps — the "seat
of geology," according to organizer Peter
Fiske — will be primarily funded from
proceeds earned by the students from a
sale of items salvaged from their earth
quake-ravaged department.
The School of Earth Sciences is
already well known for its extensive stu
dent trips through California and west
ern Nevada, but this will be its first over

seas effort. Fiske, a geology graduate stu
dent, said that although California offers
a wealth of geological formations, the
Alpine trip will be very valuable in
"rounding out" the students' geological
education.
Formed by a combination of subo
ceanic sedimentary build-up, colliding
continental plates and glacial move
ments, the Alps provide geologists with
excellent opportunities for understand
ing land formation. The rock hounds are
further excited about going to the Alps
because the region is the classical birth
place of geology, Fiske said.
Alpine geology is especially important
because it offers many easily observable
geographical features. Cliffs and recent

road cuts, for example, make the stratifi
cation of the earth's layers very visible.
An old geology adage contends that
"binoculars are Swiss rock hammers,"
Fiske said.
The exact destinations are still "on
hold" while organizers attempt to coordi
nate their trip with local experts in the
Alps, Fiske said.
Looking for prehistoric reptile fossils
in German limestone fields is one activity
the students plan. A visit to recently
active volcanic fields and a meteor crater
are also in the works.
The Alpine trip was conceived by sev
eral graduate students last year. Fiske
said that many other universities, includ
ing his alma mater, Princeton, regularly

host overseas trips of this nature.
Although he admits the programs are
more the exception than the rule, he said
it is just a matter of having the "where
withal" to get out there and do it.
The "Sale of the Century," held last
spring, gave Stanford geologists their
chance. At the sale, Earth Sciences stu
dents sold old microscopes, skeletons,
rocks, books and other items that
emerged from the wreckage of the quake
damaged Geology Department.
The students had hoped to raise
$7,000 in the sale, but netted over
$16,000 instead. The proceeds from the
sale will be augmented by grants from
Stanford, the School of Earth Sciences
and applicable departments.

Organizers hope to cover air and
ground transportation and some lodging
for the 20-day excursion, but students
will still be responsible for many costs.
These costs and employment conflicts
have held interest in the trip to about 20
of the 80 students in the School of Earth
Sciences.
The trip planners hope it will lay the
groundwork for a regular biannual pro
gram which will send Stanford geologists
overseas.
Fiske said organizers are in the pro
cess of identifying potential donors who
could make this program possible. He
said oil companies will be especially tar
geted because of their dependency on
knowledgeable geologists.
