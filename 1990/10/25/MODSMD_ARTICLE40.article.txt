With so many film festivals these
days, it's hard to find a foreign movie
released in America that doesn't have a
page-long list of European awards.
While "Life and Nothing But," a
French drama from producer Bertrand
Tavernier, is no exception, the film is
well deserving of the praise it has gar
nered abroad.
Set in the French countryside during
the aftermath of World War I, the film
follows the story of three people strug

gling to pull their lives back together.
The central of these characters is
Major Dellaplane, chief of the War
Casualties Identification Bureau, who
has undertaken the insurmountable
task of identifying the one-third million
French MlA's.
In this capacity he encounters Irene
and Alice, two women trying to learn
the fate of the men they loved. The
three come together at the rural site of a
caved-in tunnel which has buried a
trainload of anonymous soldiers and
holds the final hopes of putting all of
their minds at rest.
Fortunately, Tavernier masterfully
handles a topic that could have other
wise been excessively dismal.

Tarvernier focuses on the individuals,
showing how each person attempts,
with varying degrees of success, to find
peace in a war-torn world.
Major Dellaplane blends outward
brashness with deep compassion in try
ing to repair the emotional damage the
war caused to the families of soldiers.
At the same time, Irene struggles with
the grief of her past in trying to realize a
better future. All the while, the two
begin to rediscover life and love in a
world long-devoid of both.
Even following such a tragedy as war,
there is still hope for the survivors who
must go on with their lives. In this set
ting the obstacles are great, ranging
from mass unemployment to live bomb

shells in the untilled soil. Greater still,
though, is the unquenchable human
resolve to overcome them.
This film, complete with outstand
ing acting, breathtaking scenery and an
intriguing plot, is well worth watching.
The beginning is somewhat confusing,
due in part to the combination of subti
tles and subtle dialogue, but once it
starts moving it quickly engages the
audience.
"Life and Nothing But" is hardly a
war epic, but it serves a higher purpose
of showing how adversity challenges the
ordinary person to find new existence
among the rubble of destroyed life.
