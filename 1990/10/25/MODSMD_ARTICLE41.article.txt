White Palace
James Spader, Susan Sarandon
Grade: D
Sex does not make a film> nor does
Susan Sarandon's plump derriere, or
James Spader playing yet another ver
sion of the scourge of Palo Alto. (No,
he's not a skate punk; he's a god-fore
saken yuppie.)
However, if you are in an antihis
tamine-induced stupor (considering
that alcohol is now supposedly verbot
ten), you might find yourself consider
ing seeing "White Palace." Don't.
A long time has passed since I
almost fell asleep in front of the big
screen, but I came really close in this
love feast.

Don't get me wrong; I enjoy a
romantic film now and then. I thought
"Always" was one of the best films of
the Christmas season, and both "Pretty
Woman" and "Ghost" received my
thumbs up. But, please, I can only take
so much.
The title, "White Palace," refers to a
crowded fast food joint that sells minia
ture hamburgers. For those fortunate
few from the Deep South, it's kind of
like a Krystle's.
Max (Spader) meets Nora (Saran
don), a cashier at Palace, when he
demands a refund for six faulty burgers.
The flesh does not get pounded until
Max and Nora get drunk together and
collapse in Nora's dump. And I do
mean dump. Her taste for squalor

serves as one of the many travails that
their relationship must endure.
This is quite a relationship, too. I bet
Geritol's marketing wizards really
thought they had a winner with this
one: a 42-year-old woman that leaves a
27-year-old celibate widower begging
for more.
But, before you think that this May-
December romance is on the cutting
edge of social change, consider that
Max is a rich ad executive who is hesi
tant to show off his proletariat-class
lover
I am sure you can almost imagine
the fireworks. Which is what I would
recommend, because they are not worth
paying to see.
After an hour and half of falling in

love with Nora and then having her
walk out on him, Max experiences per
sonal change, and decides to give up his
career and pursue her. This pivotal
moment in the film occurs when he
realizes that a female friend of his has
no dust in her Dust Buster
Both Spader and Sarandon seem to
take their material seriously, and it
shows in their acting. Which, depend
ing on what mood you are in, either
gives the film some redeeming aspects
or further cements its unbearably melo
dramatic nature.
An evening spent at McDonald's
dreaming about sex is more worthwhile
than $6.50 spent on "White Palace."
