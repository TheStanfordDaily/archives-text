Mr. Destiny

Grade: C-
After seeing a commercial for
"Ml Destiny," with a happy couple
emerging from the theater breath
lessly exclaiming, "We loved it! It's
a great date movie!" my girlfriend
turned to me and said matter-of
factly, "We're seeing this movie."
Her statement was not a sugges
tion, nor was it a request — it was
an authoritative declaration of fact.
I dared to entertain vague hopes
that I might get out of watching
this particular "feel-good" movie,
but I was horrified to discover that
her face was set in the same don't
even-bother-arguing-with-me
demeanor that I hadn't seen since
"Pretty Woman" came out.
So I soon found myself sitting in
a darkened theater, awaiting, with a
certain amount of dread, the begin
ning of "Mr. Destiny". Unfortu
nately, my worst fears were soon
realized.
The script, penned by James Orr
and Jim Cruickshank (the duo
behind "Three Men and a Baby") is
a standard, if somewhat listless,
version of "It's a Wonderful Life."
James Belushi plays Larry Bur
rows, an amiable average guy with

a loving wife, a faithful dog and a
steady job. Still, Smith isn't satis
fied: he's convinced that, had he
not struck out in a high school
championship baseball game 20
years earlier; his life would have
turned out much better.
Then, lo and behold, along
comes a mysterious stranger
named Mike (Michael Caine). It
turns out that Mike is Destiny
itself — not just any old destiny
but the one and only DESTINY
that guides all of our lives.
Mike offers Smith a chance of
seeing what his life would have
been like had he hit that baseball
— hit it out of the park, actually.
Smith accepts, and immediately
gets thrown into an alternate ver
sion of his life in which he is rich
and powerful.
But is this revised version of his
life really better? I'm not allowed to
tell, but suffice to say that, Larry
learns the familiar lessons about
what's really important in life via a
painfully predictable ending that
literally swats you across the face
with its insipid sentimentality.
In short, I recommend that you
stay as far away from "Mr. Des
tiny" as is humanly possible. And,
incidentally, so does my girlfriend.
