# 'Tall Guy' a bad fit
## 
### 
The Tall Guy
Jeff Goldblum, Emma Goldman
Grade: C+
With his gangly 6'6" frame and
darkly odd facial features; Jeff
Goldblum has been no stranger to
lending his body and himself to
monstrous roles, playing an exper
iment gone awry in"The Fly" and
a hairy extraterrestrial in "Earth
Girls are Easy."
But before his roles as muta
tions and aliens, Goldblum was
known for his deftness at playing
the nerd ("The Big Chill," "The
Right Stuff"), the awkward sup
porting character who at times
could fade into the backround and
at other times steal the scene.
In his new film "The Till Guy,"
Goldblum returns to his former
fort 6, reaching new heights in the
realm of nerddom. Unfortunately,
the result is Goldblum's frequent
fading into the backround, an bad
position for the main character of a
movie. Overall, it results in an
awkward little film.
Goldblum plays a shy and
pathetic creature known as Dexter
King, an American actor living in
London. For five years he nas

played the abused, straight man to
the popular and egomaniacal
comedian Ron Anderson, played by
real-life British comedian Rowan
Atkinson, in Anderson's one-man
show. Dexter is equally abused in
his personal life, playing straight
man to obnoxious women and
bizarre flower children.
Dexter's hapless personal life
takes a turn for the better when he
meets and falls in love with a
sharp-witted nurse, plaved by
Emma Thompson. Soon, his pro
fessional life is turned around
when his height and pathetic inex
pertise land him the lead in a musi
cal version of "The Elephant Man".
This brings us to by far the best
moments of the film, the hilarious
send up of Andrew Lloyd-Webber
productions. Called "Elephant,"
the musical contains all the glitz
and pretensiousness characteristic
of the British producer's works.
As a romantic comedy about
love's great transforming power,
"The Tall Guy" has a few nice
moments but mostly suffers from
the film's lack of self awareness,
being never quite sure of what it is
or what it wants to be: parody or
slapstick. — Chris McKenna
