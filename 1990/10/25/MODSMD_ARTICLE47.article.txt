# Though not brilliant, 'Traces' moves and intrigues
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
There's an unusual and moving pro
duction playing at Theatre Works newly
converted Stage II Theatre in Palo Alto's
Cubberley Center. "Brilliant Traces," by
Cindy Lou Johnson, begins with a delin
quent bride finding refuge at an eccentric
pipeline worker's remote Alaskan home.
The play starts off at a frantic pitch as
Rosannah Deluce arrives in her wedding
dress, frozen and frenzied, at Henry
Harry's cabin door. In an electrifying
entrance, Rosannah (Christianne Case)
tumbles through the door, breathless and
shivering.
But the petite and delicate Case is mis
cast in the difficult role of a woman who
runs from the altar in Arizona and drives
wildly 300 miles to Alaska.
Instead of experiencing this scene as a
woman on the verge of freezing to death,
Case appears to be thinking about her
next line and the troubles that lie ahead
for her character, making her panicked
state seems superficial. She's not believ
able as a woman who's just fought her
way through a snowstorm in her wedding
dress.
While it's obvious that Rosannah is
confused, it's impossible to understand
what underlies her erratic behavior. Case
is too self-conscious about her acting to

project what her character is feeling. But
she is endearing nevertheless, and has a
general understanding of the reason for
Rosannah's distraction.
As Henry Harry, Erik Slavin is a bit
more methodical in his approach. Little
by little, he draws us into his character's
dilemma, and his acting becomes pro
gressively convincing. Focused and con
centrated in his role, his emotional
speeches are well-executed.
The play 's message of finding strength
by connecting with others makes "Bril
liant Traces" mesmerizing yet disturbing
to watch.
The sensitive and insightful dialogue
touches a familiar chord about fear, lone
liness and personal responsibility —
examining the way our lives are affected
by the people we know, and how we pass
these feelings on in our subsequent
encounters.
Harry is not used to opening up to
people, but Rosannah reminds Harry of
feelings he's repressed for a long time and
that led to his hermit-like existence.
These recollections come out in a
story Harry tells about his daughter,
which parallels the relationship he is
developing with Rosannah. Johnson's
writing allows the play to end where it
begins, and this circular effect adds great
emphasis to the theme.
Yet instead of allowing the theme to

emerge naturally by working from
moment to moment, both actors often
want to force the point across. While they
do succeed in giving us a sense of being
trapped in a cabin during a snowstorm,
they don't use this facet of their environ
ment effectively. It's the snowstorm out
side and being noled up in the cabin that
forces them to discover one another.
Under improbable, yet logical circum
stances, and despite their inward exis
tence, Harry and Rosannah find safety
and peace together. Leslie Martinson's
direction gently helps the relationship
along by making good use of the cabin
space and the moments the characters
entwine. Their attraction and acceptance
of one another grows gradually.
The play's dynamic ending resolves
the issues both characters were trying to
avoid — Henry Harry's guilt at not being
there for his daughter when she needed
him, and Rosannah's pain of being left
alone by everyone who has "touched her
soul."
