Budget nears final agreement
WASHINGTON (AP) — Budget negotiator*
all but reached final agreement vesterday on a
long-sought plan to slash the federal deficit by
boosting taxes on the wealthy, raising levies on
gasoline and increasing oosts for Medicare
recipients.
'I think we have the strong basis for an
speement" that President Bush and enough
House Republicans would support for the mea
sure to pass, said Speaker Thomas Foley, D-
Waah., after a closed session of Democratic
members. Senate leaders expected little trou
ble in gaining approval in their chamber
Foley said the compromise could be wrapped
up in time to reach the floor for a vote today.
The plan would raise taxes on cigarettes and
luxunr items and force spending cuts for a vari
ety of federal But the Democrats no
longer are insisting on imposing a surtax on
the rich. Rather, Foley said, the new plan "fully
supplants the impact of the surtax."
City hands out cheap condoms
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The budget-con
scious city is handing out a cheaper brand of
condom that is too tight, too thin and breaks
too easily, health officials said yesterday.
"The only people who would like these con
doms are people who like pain," said David
Fair, former director of the AIDS Activities
Coordinating Office.
Jokes aside, Fair fears the product is being
used by poor people, drug users and others
likely to be exposed to AIDS and sexual dis
eases.
"The city has 600,000 of them on the street,
giving them out to people with higher levels of
sexual activity," he said.
The condoms in question, named Crown,
are made by Okamoto Industries Inc., based in
Tokyo. Hisayuki Naito, vice president for mar
keting of its American subsidiary, said the
Crown condom is roughly 1 millimeter smaller
in diameter than the average brand and "a lit
tle bit thin, but the same strength" as thicker
brands. He said a Stanford University study
rated the condoms good.
Candidates' debate in limbo
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Viewers' chances of
seeing a second televised confrontation
between gubernatorial candidates Dianne
Feinstein and Pete Wilson faded yesterday
when she rejected using a San Diego station to
host a second debate this evening.
Instead, Feinstein offered Wilson a choice of
three dates next week in San Francisco —
Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday — in a
broadcast originating from station KPIX,
which Wilson ruled out.
Meanwhile, Wilson and Feinstein both
reported receiving big, last-minute contribu
tions that would have exceeded the campaign
donation limits approved by California voters
in 1988. Wilson had criticized Feinstein for
exceeding the limits after a federal judge struck
them down.
