Rift between 'friends' widens
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Israel rejected an appeal
by President Bush to cooperate with a United
Nations investigation, setting the stage for another
U.S. vote against Israel in the U.N. Security Council,
U.S. officials and other sources said yesterday.
The vote is on a reeolution deploring Israel's
rejection of the inquiry into the slaying of 19 Pales
tinian Arabs on the Temple Mount. U.S. officials,
declining to be identified, said all other members of
the Security Council had been notified that the
United States would not veto the resolution.
It is sponsored primarily by Yemen and other non
aligned nations. A U.S. veto would have killed the
resolution.
The U.S. decision shows the growing rift between
two friendly governments.
The United States, through the years, mostly
stood by Israel in rebuffing attacks on its policies
and actions in the United Nations. But after 19
Palestinians were killed by Israeli police in a riot Oct.
8 the United States drafted a resolution condemning
Israel and calling for an investigation under the
supervision of Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
The Israeli Cabinet declined to cooperate.
Bush on Tuesday sent a letter to Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir appealing for cooperation
with the investigation, U.S. officials and other
sources said yesterday.
While the Israeli leader did not reply in writing, it
was made clear to American diplomats in Washing
ton and in Jerusalem that Israel's position had not
changed, the sources told The Associated Press.
Israel's initial decision to rebufF the U.N. inquiry
was based on two principles that still stand, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They were that the U.N. Security Council had
already reached its conclusions, condemning Israel
before making a factual judgment, and that the
inquiry conflicts with Israel's sovereignty, the
sources said.
This position was conveyed to U.S. Ambassador
William Brown, who delivered Bush's letter Tuesday
in Jerusalem, and by Zalman Shoval, the new Israeli
ambassador, in meetings in Washington.
The letter represented a last-ditch attempt by
Bush to persuade Israel to admit the investigators
lest it face sterner treatment from the U.N. Security
Council.
