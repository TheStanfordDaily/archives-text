# Med Center surgeons perform landmark lung transplant

In what is believed to be the first-ever
procedure of its kind, Stanford surgeons
replaced a young girl's diseased lung with
a portion of her living mother's lung yes
terday afternoon at Stanford Hospital.
During the five-hour transplant opera
tion, a team of three surgeons led by Dr.
Vaughn Starnes, head of Stanford's
Heart-Lung Transplant Program, insert
ed one-third of the 46-year-old mother's

right lung into the chest of her 12-year
old daughter.
The family asked that both patients
remain anonymous.
"I felt the operation went extremely
well," Starnes said. "Everything thus far
has gone smoothly. Both mother and
daughter are resting comfortably."
The girl suffered from a rare and often
fatal disease called bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, characterized by scarring and
high blood pressure in the lungs. Doctors
said without yesterday's surgery she

probably would have died within 12 to 18
months.
Although both of the girl's lungs were
damaged, replacing one diseased lung
with a healthy portion of another should
enable her to live a normal life, Starnes
said.
Both mother and daughter are expect
ed to resume normal activity within a few
months, he added.
While lung transplants have been rela
tively common since 1986, doctors consid
er yesterday's operation a landmark for

two reasons.
"This operation is very unique and his
torical because never before has the seg
ment of lung from one person been taken
and used as an entire lung for another
person," Starnes said.
"And it was a lung segment taken from
a living person," he added. "We had to
worry about the safety and well-being of
both donor and recipient."
Dr. David Latter, another member of
the surgical team, said lung transplants
are further complicated because they are

riskier than other types of transplants,
such as kidney and liver transplants.
Children undergoing lung transplants
experience rejection — the natural ten
dency of the body to attack foreign tissue
— of the organ nearly twice as frequently
as adults, Latter saicf.
Stames said a living donor was used in
the operation to "lessen the high rate of
life-threatening rejection children have
encountered in transplants involving the
