# Kazakh is latest republic to secede

MOSCOW (AP) - The Kazakh
republic declared sovereignty
from the Soviet government yes
terday and factional fighting
threatened to break out in Mol
davia, accelerating the country's
political fragmentation.
As its first act of defiance, the
Kazakh legislature banned
nuclear explosions anywhere in
the republic, including Semi
palatinsk, one of the Soviet
Union's main sites for testing
warheads.
Kazakhstan, a poor, grain
growing republic that stretches
from the Caspian Sea to the Chi
nese border, is the 14th of the 15
Soviet republics to declare
sovereignty from Moscow. Now,
only the neighboring Central
Asian republic of Kirgizia has yet
to take the step.
That could happen soon. The
Kirgizian parliament is debating
the issue, according to Chingiz
Aitmatov, a Kirgiz writer and
member of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's presidential
council.
The breaking away of the
republics has plunged the Soviet
government into a constitutional
crisis. The national legislature

passed legislation Wednesday say
ing its laws take precedence over
decisions by parliaments in each
republic. But the republics
showed no intention of complying.
Gorbachev has been trying to
persuade the republics to negoti
ate a new treaty that would rede
fine and preserve the union as a
confederation of sovereign states.
But few republic leaders appear
eager to participate in such talks.
Even as they push for auton
omy from Moscow, some of the
republics are trying to stop sepa
ratist movements within their
own borders.
In Moldavia, police and bus
loads of college-age volunteers
headed last night toward the
Gagauz region, a tiny corner of
the republic where an ethnic
minority has declared indepen
dence and begun holding elec
tions.
Konstantin Rabu, a member of
the Moldavian People's Front,
said in a telephone interview from
the Moldavian capital of Kishinev
that the volunteers were unarmed
and would try to end the Gagauz
independence drive peacefully.
"We want to talk them out of
this craziness," he said.
