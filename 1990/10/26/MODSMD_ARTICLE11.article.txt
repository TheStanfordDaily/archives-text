# Budget bill should be concluded today

WASHINGTON (AP) - Bar
gainers wrestled with lingering
disputes over tax breaks and cuts
in Medicare and other benefit pro
grams yesterday, but top lawmak
ers predicted passage for the
broad deficit-reduction bill sup
ported by President Bush.
None of the outstanding differ
ences was seen as a deal-killer for
the $250-billion collection of tax
increases and spending reduc
tions. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Bush liked
the emerging bill, and that
seemed to stamp out the possibil
ity of any last-minute setback.
"With the White House opti
mistic, one would guess it would
be hard to shipwreck the thing,"
said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Min
nesota, ranking Republican on the
House Budget Committee.
House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., said he expected the
House to approve the measure
today. And little trouble was
expected in the Senate later.
The package would boost the 9-
cent-per-gallon gasoline tax by
about a nickel and increase levies
on alcohol, tobacco and fancy cars.
It would raise, from 28 percent
to 31 percent, the income-tax rate
on the richest Americans, but
drop the rate paid by the upper
middle class from 33 percent to 31
percent. The measure also would
reduce the deductions available to
people earning more than
$100,000 yearly by 3 percent, and
phase out their $2,050 personal
exemptions.
The plan aims cuts at veterans,
farm aid and other benefit pro
grams. The details were subject to
change in late negotiations.
White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu and Richard Dar
man, Bush's budget chief, met for
more than two hours on Capitol
Hill with House GOP members,
answering questions and seeking
support.
Sununu said that assuming
final details were acceptable to
Bush, Republicans should support
the package because it contains
"real and credible" savings.
"I think we picked up votes

today," said No. 3 House Republi
can Jerry Lewis of California. "I
think the president will have sub
stantial Republican support for
the package."
A chief remaining disagree
ment involved the Medicare pro
gram for the elderly and handi
capped. The program's projected
growth over the next five years
was expected to be trimmed by
about $42 billion, with more than
one-fourth of that coming from
beneficiaries.
Bargainers had not agreed
whether the $75 annual
deductible that beneficiaries pay
for doctors' bills would be
increased to $100, $150 or some
where in between. Disputes also
remained over how cuts in reim
bursements to hospitals would be
split between urban and rural
hospitals.
Negotiators worked on other
disputes involving:
• Medicaid, which helps the
poor pay their medical bills.
Although the program will be cut,
liberals wanted to provide an addi
tional $2.9 billion for low-income
elderly people. The Bush adminis
tration was trying to reduce that
figure.
• Tax breaks for the oil and gas
industry, which total $3.5 billion
over five years. They are champi
oned by Senate Finance Commit
tee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-
Texas, but opposed by the House.
• Tax advantages for a wide
range of business activities and
individuals, including research
and educational benefits received
from employers. These items,
sought by the Senate, would cost
$5.6 billion.
"We're still working," said Sen
ate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
"There's nothing the president
has signed off on yet. It's not just
one issue. There must be two
dozen important issues that
haven't been resolved," Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-
Kan., said after an afternoon
White House meeting.
Still, the deal seemed solid.
