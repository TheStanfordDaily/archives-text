# 'Bubble' squabble
## What the Republicans say 
### J.T.S. Moore Editorial staff 
Cries of class warfare have echoed from Washington since early
this month. Led by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-111. and chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee, congressional
Democrats have framed the debate over changing the federal
income tax rates in terms of the middle class versus the upper
class.
Initially, the goal of House Democrats was the passage of a 33
percent marginal tax rate for high income earners, a surtax on
incomes over one million dollars and the suspension of inflation
indexing for all income brackets.
However, the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, favored more moderate propsals.
The surtax on the 60,000 Americans who earn over a million
dollars annually was generally accepted as symbolic rather than
economic, since it would bring little increase in revenue if it is
implemented.
But some congressmen charged that the proposal to suspend
for one year the indexing of income was actually a temporary,
backdoor increase on all taxpayers because inflation would not be
excluded in figuring taxable income.
While President Bush flipped back and forth on new income
taxes, House Republicans, led by House Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., adamantly opposed any rate increases.
According to Tom Blankley, Gingrich's press secretary, the
Republicans voted the way they did because with an impending
recession they did not want to raise taxes.
Congressional Democrats attempted to capitalize on the
Republican disarray by arguing for new tax increases on the basis
of fairness to the middle class, he said. Specifically, the Democrats
wanted to eliminate the so called "bubble" in the tax rates.
The "bubble" is the segment of the 28 percent bracket in which
middle income earners pay a 33 percent rate. This occurs because
deductions are phased out on income that falls approximately in
the range of $47,000 to $70,000 for single filers and $70,000 to
$170,000 for joint returns.
Blankley said that the bubble "was put in the 1986 tax reform
package by Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., to make it more progressive
while phasing out deductions."
Although Democrats have attempted to portray the
Republicans as biased against the plight of the middle class,
Blankley said the House Republicans disagree with these argu
ment because, "once you get into fairness in taxing it's a losing
argument. You start pointing up the ladder."
Currently, House Democrats and the Bush administration
have reached a compromise of a 31 percent rate for those taxpay
ers in the bubble and the bracket above it, no surtax on million
aires, and the acceptance of Sen. Bob Packwood's proposal to eli
mate personal deductions for high-income earners.
