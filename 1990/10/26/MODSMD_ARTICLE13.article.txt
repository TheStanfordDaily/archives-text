# Labor unrest plagues popular N.Y. paper

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Workers walked out of
a Daily News printing plant yesterday after a
dispute over an employee's right to work sit
ting down, and then attacked a bus carrying
replacement workers to the plant.
About 200 employees at the Brooklyn plant
attacked the bus with sticks, smashing its
windshield. Police cited two workers.
Following the attack, labor accused man
agement of a lockout and management
claimed drivers had gone on strike. Either way,
the conflict appeared to be escalating at the
financially troubled tabloid.
A coalition of the paper's 10 unions met yes
terday afternoon, then sent leaders to a meet
ing with management at the Daily News'
headquarters. Michael Alvino, president of the
drivers' union, said his members were not
striking and wanted to work.
With a weekday circulation of 1.18 million,
the Daily News is the nation's second largest
metropolitan daily. But during the past decade
it has lost about $115 million and seen daily
circulation slip by about 700,000.
The News' 3.500 employees have been

working without a contract for more than six
months and negotiations are stalemated.
The paper's managers said they need to end
labor abuses, have the ability to set staff sizes
and save $50 million to $70 million annually.
They have made plans to keep printing the
paper in case of a strike.
The unions said the paper is trying to break
them, and they have called for an advertisers'
boycott.
The workers walked out early yesterday
after their business agent, Seymour Goldstein,
was ejected from the plant by management,
according to George McDonald, president of
the Allied Printing Trades Council, a union
umbrella group.
"It's indeed unfortunate that the drivers
union has struck the Daily News when we are
in the process of collective bargaining and
fhasl. . . resorted to unruly and violent behav
ior," responded John Sloan, the News' vice
president for labor relations.
The paper sought to replace as many as pos
sible of the 200 union members who walked
out, Sloan said. Others could be suspended or

discharged after an investigation into damage
done to company property, he said.
Sloan said about 800,000 copies of yester
day's paper had been printed by late morning
and that they would be distributed through
the day.
The crisis apparently began when Goldstein
became involved in a dispute involving a
drivers' union member who was working while
sitting down.
McDonald said the man's job did not
involve driving, but required him to make sure
newspapers properly came off of a conveyor
belt. Many workers normally sit and read mag
azines while doing the job, he said.
When supervisors told the man to work
standing, he appealed to Goldstein. "I told him
to sit down. They gave me two choices: leave or
be escorted out. They escorted me out," Gold
stein said.
Sloan said Goldstein was expelled for
"countermanding a direct order from the
supervisor. As far as we are concerned,
(whether the employee is disabled) is not the
issue here." The employee was suspended.
