# More troops on Saudi soil does not spell 'attack'

• WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is laying
plans to send as many as 100,000 more troops to
Saudi Arabia, but the expanded buildup does not sig
nal a U.S. intent to attack Iraq, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said yesterday.
' CIA Director William Webster, meanwhile, sug
gested a growing U.S. reluctance to let Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein survive the current crisis
in power, even if he withdraws from Kuwait.
Webster said the Persian Gulf region will not be
secure unless Hussein is removed from power or
from his chemical weapons and
efforts to acquire nuclear arms.
On Capitol Hill, there was concern over the
administration's course and worry that once
leaves town, Bush might feel less con
strained to follow a peaceful path.
-I"I am not convinced that this administration will
do everything in its power to avoid war," said Sen.
Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., expressing the same senti
ments as many of his colleagues who have supported
_ihe gulf deployment.
-I Kerrey, a Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor
Winner, said, "If ever there was an avoidable war, it
is this one."
-I The Pentagon's disclosure earlier this week that it
Was considering adding troops to Operation Desert
Shield, beyond the 240,000 already there or en route,
raised questions about whether the deployment was
being tailored for an offensive.
* Cheney, speaking in a series of interviews with
the television networks ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN,
•aid the Bush administration had not set an upper
limit on troop deployments to Saudi Arabia. He said
Jie wanted to have enough forces there to deal with
any contingency."
The defense secretary said his orders from Bush
were to use American forces to deter Hussein from
invading Saudi Arabia, to prepare to defend the
Saudi kingdom in the event of an attack and to
•nforce the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.

"We want to have the capability for the president
to make the decision to use other options should that
become necessary in response to a provocation, for
example," Cheney said. He was referring to a possi
ble U.S. offensive action.
At another point, he said, "For a number of rea

sons I would expect a continuing flow of forces to the
gulf in the period ahead."
Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, later told
reporters that Cheney was not suggesting that a
decision had been made on how many extra troops to
deploy.
