## Unity for progress 
### 
The assu deserves to
be congratulated for its
efforts in coordinating the
upcoming Leadership Summit.
The summit has the potential
for launching significant strides
toward the amelioration of the
Stanford community as a whole.
Rarely, if ever, have we seen the
named student communities get
ting together to help one another.
In stark contrast to the free-for
all atmosphere which has tended to
characterize campus politics in the
past, the summit paves the way for
much-needed campus unity.
One of the summit's admirable
goals is an increase in the commit
ment of students to public service.
If the student leaders can agree to
join in their efforts to serve the
community, the results can only be
positive.
Similarly, a forum in which stu
dent leaders share their experi
ences should provide helpful infor
mation to the various student-run

organizations in their respective
attempts to provide meaningful
leadership.
Indeed, at its most basic level,
the summit offers a unique oppor
tunity for student leaders repre
senting a vast spectrum of con
cerns simply to get to know one
another.
Diversity cannot be achieved one
culture at a time. Although specific
interests may differ, the various
Stanford communities have to rec
ognize the need to unite their con
cerns. The upcoming summit gives
these communities a mechanism
for initiating efforts of coopera
tion.
Finally, in order to ensure cam
pus-wide representation, the
ASSU has allotted some 15 or 20
at-large invitations to individuals
who feel they can add to the
breadth of representation at the
summit. Such an opportunity is
one which students should seri
ously consider.
