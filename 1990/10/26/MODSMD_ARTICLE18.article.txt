# Rules for Greeks

### 
AS PROGRAM AND Frater
nal Affairs Adviser Michael
Ramsey-Perez put it, "This is
no way to start the school year."
Only one month into the aca
demic year, the Kappa Alpha fra
ternity is ending its social suspen
sion while the Sigma Chi fraternity
takes its place in the disciplinary
spotlight.
Already the Greek system is tar
nishing the reputation it has been
aiming to polish.
But the recent probation of the
Sigma Chis has raised several ques
tions regarding how much the sys
tem and individual fraternities and
sororities should be responsible,for
the actions of their members.
Should Sigma Chi be punished
because four or five drunk mem
bers acted stupidly? And is it fair

that the actions of such a minority
be construed as reflective of the
entire community?
Although some may think it
unfair, it is going to happen. Fra
ternities and sororities are promi
nent groups and are given special
privileges, particularly housed fra
ternities. In choosing to be mem
bers of the Greek system, people
also take on a collective responsibil
ity to the system and the campus
community as a whole.
One positive aspect of last week
end's incidents is that the Interfra
ternity Council had a chance to
enact its fledgling Judicial Board.
The board's first decision was
made in a timely manner, far faster
than many past University deci
sions, and reflected a push by the
IFC to self-regulate.
