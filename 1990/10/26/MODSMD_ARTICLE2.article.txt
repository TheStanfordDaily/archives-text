# Faculty debates proposed change to distribution requirements
## 
### John Wagner Senior stafF writer 
The Faculty Senate opened discus
sion yesterday on a measure that would
substantially alter the current distribu
tion requirements by placing a much
greater emphasis on the study of race,
gender and non-Western cultures.
Proponents hailed the proposed
changes as necessary to prepare a
diverse student body for living in an
increasingly global society. But several
faculty voiced concern that the
increased emphasis on the study of race
and gender would undercut the require
ments' goal of exposing students to a
wide variety of academic disciplines.
The senate is expected to vote on the
proposal at its Nov. 29 meeting. If
approved, the revamped requirements
would apply to next fall's entering fresh
men.
The proposal calls for several
changes:
• The number of required courses
would be increased from 10 to 11;
• Two new requirements would be
added — "World Cultures," which in
effect would replace the "asterisked"
status of the existing non-Western-cul
ture requirement, and "American Cul
tures," which would require completing
a course that "examines critically the
concept of race";
• Two existing social science require
ments, Area 4 (Human Development,

Behavior and Language) and Area 5
(Social Processes and Institutions),
would be collapsed into one require
ment; and
• An "asterisked" gender studies
requirement would be added.
The gender studies requirement
would function in the same way as the
current non-Western culture require
ment. Students could satisfy the
requirement by taking any certified
course (which would be denoted in the
Time Schedule by an asterisk) that "crit
ically examines interpretations of gen
der differences and the relations
between men and women," according to
the proposal.
The requirements would also be
regrouped into three core clusters — a
cultures core, a science core, and a
humanities and social science core — to
lend more order to the requirements.
The proposal was introduced by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
which approved the measure last May.
According to History Prof. Peter Duus,
chair of the committee, the proposal is
the result of nearly two years of deliber
ation and discussion. The measure was
discussed informally by the senate at its
June meeting, where it received mixed
reviews.

ofTicially offer to the senate Nov.
29. Abernethy's proposal calls for
changing the current asterisked
non-Western-culture requirement
to a "full-fledged" requirement,
but otherwise leaves the current
system intact.
Abernethy said while race and
gender are important issues, the
purpose of the distribution
requirements is to expose stu
dents to a "pluralism of subject
matter." The committee's pro
posal, he said, "overloads the DR
system [and] to overload the sys
tem is to weaken it."
Duus countered by explaining
that the requirements represent
"a compromise" between two
objectives — preparing students
to live in the world and encourag
ing students to engage in "a
breadth of study."
Duus said the committee's
proposal places more emphasis on
the first goal. He added he did not
think the proposal would offer
students narrower intellectual
experiences.
Some senate members raised
questions as to why the issues of
race and gender had been singled
out for increased attention, argu
ing that students will be faced
with other important issues in
the real world, including the envi
ronment and global commerce.
Duus said the committee con
sidered such issues, but decided
they were not as relevant as race
and gender. "The (issues) we've
singled out are more important
than the others," he said.

History Prof. Albert Camarillo,
who served as chair of the Univer
sity Committee on Minority
Issues, said a curriculum address
ing issues of race is "fundamental
to developing an understanding"
between students of different eth
nicities at Stanford. He said he
supported the changes proposed
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies.
Duus also tried to alleviate
concerns about the availability of
courses that would satisfy the
new requirements and about
whether the new requirements
were meant to "inculcate" stu
dents with a particular agenda.
Several faculty members said
they were worried the growing
number of requirements would
limit students' academic choices.
History Prof. Paul Seaver noted
"piling on" requirements limits
the opportunities for undergradu
ates to engage in research pro
jects. "It seems to me we have a
potential conflict that must at
some point be addressed," he said.
Others noted the increased
burden another requirement
would have on engineering
majors, who must already fulfill a
substantial number of require
ments for their mtyor. "We do
realize this will perhaps be more
of a burden to engineering stu
dents," Duus acknowledged.
In other business, the senate
voted to extend the American
Studies program for another five
years. Although several faculty
voiced concern that many of the
courses central to the megor were
taught by non-tenure-track pro
fessors, the extension passed
unanimously.
