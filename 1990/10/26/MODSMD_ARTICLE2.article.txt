# Faculty debates proposed change to distribution requirements

### John Wagner Senior stafF writer 
The Faculty Senate opened discus
sion yesterday on a measure that would
substantially alter the current distribu
tion requirements by placing a much
greater emphasis on the study of race,
gender and non-Western cultures.
Proponents hailed the proposed
changes as necessary to prepare a
diverse student body for living in an
increasingly global society. But several
faculty voiced concern that the
increased emphasis on the study of race
and gender would undercut the require
ments' goal of exposing students to a
wide variety of academic disciplines.
The senate is expected to vote on the
proposal at its Nov. 29 meeting. If
approved, the revamped requirements
would apply to next fall's entering fresh
men.
The proposal calls for several
changes:
• The number of required courses
would be increased from 10 to 11;
• Two new requirements would be
added — "World Cultures," which in
effect would replace the "asterisked"
status of the existing non-Western-cul
ture requirement, and "American Cul
tures," which would require completing
a course that "examines critically the
concept of race";
• Two existing social science require
ments, Area 4 (Human Development,

Behavior and Language) and Area 5
(Social Processes and Institutions),
would be collapsed into one require
ment; and
• An "asterisked" gender studies
requirement would be added.
The gender studies requirement
would function in the same way as the
current non-Western culture require
ment. Students could satisfy the
requirement by taking any certified
course (which would be denoted in the
Time Schedule by an asterisk) that "crit
ically examines interpretations of gen
der differences and the relations
between men and women," according to
the proposal.
The requirements would also be
regrouped into three core clusters — a
cultures core, a science core, and a
humanities and social science core — to
lend more order to the requirements.
The proposal was introduced by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
which approved the measure last May.
According to History Prof. Peter Duus,
chair of the committee, the proposal is
the result of nearly two years of deliber
ation and discussion. The measure was
discussed informally by the senate at its
June meeting, where it received mixed
reviews.
At yesterday's meeting, Political Sci
ence Prof. David Abernethy introduced
