## Holy cow — it's a Discourse!

SOME PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED
by the upset. Some were shocked by
Chris Sabo's physical appearance
(wasn't he in my EE class?). I was
shocked by the uniforms.
Turning on Game 1 of the World
Series, I saw that both teams were wear
ing new patches over their left breasts.
They were American flags.
I began to postulate wildly: "That
crazy, trendy 'Vince' " (as Commissioner
Fay Vincent prefers to be called), "he's
testing the strength of the First Amend
ment. When the players slide, the flags
will touch the ground. And instead of
burning the uniforms, he'll defiantly
order them to use Purex."
But my excitement was quickly inter
rupted by TV announcer Jim Kaat:
"Y'know Tim, the players are wearing
flags on their uniforms to show their sup
port for our soldiers stationed in the Mid
dle East."
Everyone in the booth agreed what a
good thing that was, and it was presumed
that the rest of America would admire the
players for making the sacrifice of adding
the weight of the patch to their uniforms.
So I started to think about sacrifices,
and what "I would do for my country." I
determined that for a couple hundred
thousand dollars a year, I would be willing
to wear an "I Love Sean Cassidy" patch.
But that didn't seem to answer the ques
tion.
I tried starting an impromptu dorm
discussion in the lounge, but they were all
more involved with the game than in my
philosophical quest. (Guys, if you're read
ing this — damn you.)
Without wasting any time, I developed

a thesis statement: What was so valuable
to me that I was willing to be shot at in
120-degree weather by a country that
uses a 'q' without a 'u' — while wearing
those awful sand-camouflage uniforms.
The best thing to do in such a situa
tion, I remembered from college applica
tion time, is to make a list. Realizing the
depth of my topic, I decided to make a
bunch of lists.
My first list, "Things That Are Super
Important", consisted of my family, my
friends and Hobee's coffee cake. My sec
ond list, "Things That Are Very Impor
tant," included things like personal
belongings, health, happiness and the
ability to correctly use the word 'amalga
mate.'
As I worked my way down to the
"Things That I Appreciate While Procras
tinating a Paper" I wound up with things
like the spectrum of colors in the J. Crew
catalog, the Peanuts Arbor Day Special,
the little plastic things on the end of your
shoelaces and movies starring Jack Ritter.
Now, wearing a patch is one thing, but
risking my life is another. If my family
and friends were actually attacked, I
would, without hesitation, run to get
them help.
But if some random Arab on the other
side of the world told me that my mom
wore combat boots, the odds of me strap
ping on a M-16 and hopping on the next
plane to the Sahara are about the same as
those of Jose Canseco leaving baseball for
a career in quantum physics.
Maybe I wasn't raised as a good Amer
ican; maybe I take it all for granted. I'm
sure if I were Yakov Smirnoff, I'd have
less apprehensions about sacrificing my

life for my country's pride. But then
again, if I were Yakov Smirnoff, I'd be
really, really annoying.
But hey, I've watched enough docu
mentaries on the '60s to know that being
a good American isn't about following
your country, right or wrong.
It's about tie-dying and learning to
play the acoustic guitar and harmonica
simultaneously. And its also about trying
to make this country the best you can.
I'm not saying whether going to Iraq is
right or wrong; Saddam Hussein is, and
has been, a dangerous, ruthless 'strong
man' (Forget the Kurds? No whey!).
What I am saying is that the decision
to risk one's life should be based on a per
sonal conviction as important to you as
Hobee's coffee cake is to me.
It shouldn't be made because someone
waved a flag in your face and asked you if
you're willing to let some little Ali Baba
say that your country dresses like Mr.
Furley. So unless we're willing to make
the supreme sacrifice ourselves, let's not
use symbols like Mom, Apple Pie and the
World Series to convince others to do our
dirty work.
Looouuuuuuuuu.

Joel Stein would appreciate if, out of
respect, he were referred to as 'Don.' His
column appears every Friday.
