## Summit has great potential to foster sense of community 
### 
WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD a few
comments to The Daily's Oct. 24
article about the 1990 Leader
ship Summit.
The summit is the brainchild of many
people thinking independently along the
same line.
Among them, Michael Jackson in the
Office of Student Affairs, Catherine Mil
ton in the Haas Center for Public Service
and Greg Ricks in Residential Education
have said that they see the need for stu
dents to define their own agenda on
issues of multicultural education, public
service and leadership.
Meanwhile, after a narrow elections
victory, the Council of Presidents last
spring saw the need to become better
informed about what is important to
Stanford students.
In addition, in light of the budget
cuts, we saw the need for student groups
to communicate more frequently and
effectively with one another, since scarce
resources magnify the importance of
cooperation.
This fall, the COP — in conjunction

with key administrators and students
from many constituencies — has given
reality to these ideas by coordinating an
unprecedented summit to take place Nov.
2-4 in Hoover House, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's home.
Our planning process is an example of
how, we hope, students will organize
their campus-wide projects this year. We
have sought consensus on purposes from
a diverse cross-section of students.
We have looked far and wide for funds
and volunteers. We have decentralized
our outreach effort. We have tried our
best to be inclusive and efficient.
And it has paid off.
The consistent student support for
the summit has been encouraging. Sev
enteen distinct communities were asked
to select a total of 66 representatives to
the summit, and they have taken the
responsibility seriously.
In the process, many groups have dis
cussed the very issues the Summit will
encompass — multiculturalism, public
service, and leadership. Moreover, sev-

eral students have helped plan summit
sessions.
Both students and administrators rec
ognize the immense potential of this
gathering. It is a chance for individuals
and groups to share their goals and build
trusting relationships. It is a chance to
find out how our organizations are per
ceived by our peers.
It is a chance to examine how we
define and pursue multiculturalism. It is
a chance to explore the different motiva
tions behind our many public service
efforts.
It is a chance to become better leaders
within the Stanford community, not just
within our separate organizations.
In sum, it is a chance for students to
reflect on past accomplishments and, col
lectively, to garner a sense of purpose
about our roles on this complex and
interdependent campus.
The gathering was dubbed the "ASSU
Leadership Summit" in The Daily. But
the summit is not just an ASSU project.
It belongs to all Stanford students, and it
portends positive campus-wide out-

comes.
To ensure the summit's inclusiveness,
we have set aside around 15 "at-large"
spaces for students who feel that their
communities may not be adequately rep
resented.
If you wish to attend, please send the
COP a letter of intent detailing who you
represent, what you can contribute, and
what you can learn, no later than noon,
Monday, Oct. 29. We will make final deci
sions on "at-large" applicants by
Wednesday, Oct. 31.
The summit is a historic beginning in
student efforts to foster a sense of com
munity that will enhance our ability to
coordinate successful programs, to
thoughtfully discuss issues of common
concern, and to pay attention to the "big
picture" in everything we do.
This is the start of something big.
