# Review article was biased in coverage of housing policy
## 
### 
The Stanford Review has, once again,
decided to move beyond the regions of
fair or balanced reporting in its Oct. 22
article ("Married Students Oppose
'Domestic Partners'").
First, I find it amazing that The
Review took it upon itself to interview
eveiy single married student on campus,
since it claims not that "some married
students" are in opposition, but that
"married students" in general felt this
way.

I'm also amazed that "homosexuals"
could all generically stand up and
describe the policy as a "step toward this
campus fully accepting that 'lifestyle.' "
Using generic terms in this way
makes it appear that both married stu
dents and gay people (I'm assuming
that's what The Review meant by
"homosexuals") are monolithic masses
(and, of course, bisexual people don't
exist at all).
Second, while quotes are useful for
indicating that someone other than the
author has said something, to put them
around nouns serves to trivialize the con
cept so treated. Thus, if I refer to The
Stanford Review staff as "journalists,"
it's different from calling them journal
ists.

The Review's use of quotes with sub
jects such as "domestic partners" and
"lifestyles" is a not-so-subtle way of
expressing disrespect towards gay people
which I find offensive.
Third, referring to my love for anoth
er man as a lifestyle at all (and to put it
in quotes as well) is both unfair and
demeaning. As Sonia Johnson once
wrote, "It's funny how heterosexuals
have lives and the rest of us have
'lifestyles.' "
If two men, two women or a man and
a woman love each other and want to live
together, then that is no more a lifestyle
than a marriage. The fact that my love
lacks legal backing has no relation to its
truth. It is an integral part of my life,
and it deserves to be recognized and

respected.
