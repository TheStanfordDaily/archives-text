# Legos and Tetris: key tools
## 
### Ken Wharton 
Procrastination, as most of you know, is an art.
For some people, it comes naturally; they can com
pletely blow off incredible amounts of work and do
absolutely nothing without thinking twice. Usually
without thinking once.
But the rest of us amateur procrastinators need
to have something else to do, in order to avoid the
waves of guilt that constantly bombard us when we
think about last year's midterm that we still haven't
taken yet.
Ideally, we should be doing something both fun
and useful, as opposed to our academic work, which
is usually neither.
There are probably a few ulcer-ridden fools out
there who may be wondering why anyone would
need to procrastinate, but they obviously haven't
experienced the twin joys of Legos and Tetris
When it comes to Legos, you have to love the sen
sation of having a final paper due in three hours as
you construct a Death Spaceship with folding laser
cannons. As anyone who has tried it knows, Legos
are the perfect procrastination device.
You all may be thinking back to the days of your
childhood, when Legos were just boring blocks that
you could use to build an incredible variety of
houses, buildings and square animals, which your
little sister would promptly step on.
But today, Legos are much more advanced, utiliz
ing moving pieces, streamlined wings and working
lasers which are capable of blasting your little sister
through several feet of reinforced concrete.
And then there's Tetris. I used to be a Tetris
junkie, in the sense that I'd allow myself "just one
game" after dinner, which would somehow change
into "just one more game" and eventually keep me
occupied until the wee hours of the morning.
And it wasn't just me; everyone was getting
addicted. When the long, straight, tiber-phallus piece
(as it came to be known on our floor) turned into the
dorm's virility mascot, I knew something was wrong.
But I didn't really start worrying until I began to
visualize the game when I wasn't playing it.
I'd be reading my morning cereal box at break
fast, and the patterns on the box would arrange
themselves into little Tetris pieces with eight impor

tant vitamins and minerals that stayed crunchy in
milk.
I knew something terrible was happening to my
brain, so I went to some meetings of Tetris Anony
mous and eventually was able to quit.
Then, a couple weeks later, I saw this Tetris com
mercial on T.V It showed these normal, healthy look
ing kids gazing at a mountain range, which then
resolved itself into Tetris pieces!
Here they were: addicted children, suffering from
the same psychotic Tetris delusions that I had expe
rienced, and they liked it!
Those geniuses on Madison Avenue were actually
advertising the single worst aspect of the game with
the catchy slogan "Have You Been Tetrisized?" If
this strategy actually works, we'll soon be seeing
smoking advertisements sporting the catchy slogan
"Have You Been Ostracized?" The mind boggles.
Now, if you start to notice that Legos look a lot
like Tetris pieces, don't worry about it. Worrying is
something you can always do tomorrow.
