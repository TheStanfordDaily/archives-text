# Mystery house on East Campus and Mayfield
## 
### Amy Gillett 
Dear Bug,
We were strolling down the Row one
day, when suddenly we noticed that
huge white house with pillars on the
corner of East Campus and Mayfield. It
wasn't listed in the campus housing
information, and we saw no bikes in
front, so we assumed that no students
live there.
Do people actually live there ? If so, do
they like being so close to so many stu
dents? Or is it used for some purpose
that we have never heard of?

Dear SeClu Sophs,
In honor of Halloween, I was going to
tell you how that house, while white on
the inside, has deep dark secrets within.
I was going to tell you about the spir
its which rest in its torture chamber
after a day of possessing Stanford stu
dents, causing them to postpone prob
lem sets indefinitely and to fail
midterms. And I really wanted to
describe the witch who, after several
hours at Wilbur Dining Hall, returns
home to whip up more cauldrons of slop
and perfect her Mixed-Wildlife soup
recipe.
Instead, I've decided to suppress my
holiday spirit and shed true light on the
Mayfield White Mystery House. In order
to do so, I had to pay a little house call. I
was thrilled with this convenient, on
campus mission. At 7:10 pm on Monday,
Oct. 22,1 approached the edifice in ques
tion.
Undaunted by the "Private Property
— No Parking" sign, I settled my two
wheels outside the pillared structure. I

looked up at the sky for an augury and,
seeing bright stars, I came to the conclu
sion that it was not a dark and stormy
night.
I lowered my head and caught sight
of four reckless morons on rollerblades.
Campus life as usual — everything
would be all right.

Standing at the door — debating
whether to knock, click, buzz or just let
myself into the house — I noticed a gold
nameplate engraved "Bacon." As an
ardent pig collector, I had a strong feel
ing that only goodness could await me in
this Bacon Abode.
I rang the buzzer and was greeted by
the very dapper Professor Bacon. He
cheerfully agreed to answer a few ques
tions, but pointed out that he was in the
middle of dinner.
The professor's lovely wife, Rosa
mond Bacon, came to the foyer and wel
comed me. The professor, who retired
from the Math Department in 1972, told
me that he's been living in the house for
60 years. His cousin built it in 1899.

The Bacons recalled
the days when the
Betas were still part of
the national Beta fra
ternity.

(Special Note to Stanford Centennial
Committee: When you're done with this
year's pomp, you can move on to plan
ning the White Mystery House Centen
nial Celebration. A great opportunity
for new postal cards, t-shirts, ceramic
plates and ceremonies!)
The congenial couple agreed that
they enjoy their location. While they
don't actually attend Beta frat parties or
Columbae tofu dinners, they do keep up
with their neighbors' activity. The
Bacons recalled the days when Colum
bae was the Kappa Alpha Phi Sorority
House and when the Betas were still
part of the national Beta fraternity.
BUG ME, BOTHER ME, STOKE
ME with your questions! Send me to the
ends of the earth — I will go anywhere.
I liked the question "WHY?" I received
in my Bug Box, but I though it a little
too vague for a written response.
Keep e-mailing me (b.bug@macbeth)
or slip notes into my box at the Daily.
Mother Bug has been slow in writing
this quarter, so how about putting some
mail (no junk mail please) into my
empty EO. Box 6597?! Terminating
until next Friday....
