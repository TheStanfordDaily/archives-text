# New earthquake study to begin
## Research focuses on magnetic radiation-temblor link

Electrical engineering senior
research associate Antony Fraser-Smith
will soon lead a group of students and
professors to the San Andreas fault to
study the correlation between magnetic
radiation and earthquakes.
The new study follows Fraser-
Smith's accidental discovery of
increases in magnetic radiation near
Loma Prieta just before the Earthquake
of 1989.
"By luck we were near the epicenter,"
said Fraser-Smith, who was doing low
level radiation tests and found a notable
surge of magnetic activity three hours
before the quake.
Fraser-Smith will take his team to
the Parkfield area in order to further
research the phenomenon. Located east
of Paso Robles on the San Andreas fault,
about halfway between San Francisco
and Los Angeles, Parkfield is noted for
seismic activity occurring in patterns of

about 20 years.
No exact date has been set for the
installation at Parkfield, but Fraser-
Smith hopes to make the move as soon
as the group's instruments are ready to
collect data. Fraser-Smith hopes his
group can move rapidly since the Park
field area is approaching a projected
period of seismic activity.
The instruments used last year were
designed by then-graduate student
Arm an Bernardi. They included a six
foot antenna — consisting of a large coil
of wire connected to a steel core —
which picks up signals from magnetic
fields in the earth.
The instruments have been refined
and are currently being tested for
increased sensitivity with artificial mag
netic fields near the Dish.
Fraser-Smith stressed that the group
is currently interested only in gathering
data. "Right now, I wouldn't even dare
make a prediction" of a quake because of
lack of data, he added. "We've only seen
that one big earthquake."

Parkfield, which Fraser-Smith
described as being "in the middle of
absolutely nowhere," tends to have
quakes of about magnitude 5.0, which
produce only small signals.
Fraser-Smith said data on magnetic
radiation before a quake of magnitude
6.5 or greater would produce more
informative results.
The study is being funded by the
Office of Naval Research, along with
$16,000 from the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park. The Geological Survey
will provide additional funding after
Jan. 1,1991.
But other national and Bay Area
organizations have shown little interest
in the study.
"It makes me feel that my measure
ments have not been taken very seri
ously," said Fraser-Smith.
The electrical engineering depart
ment is working with the School of
Earth Sciences to collect donations from
