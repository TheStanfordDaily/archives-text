The Daily Palo Alto
University President Ray Wilbur
announced today that Stanford will not
drop rugby in exchange for football. He
explained his reasoning in a letter to The
Daily.
"Football ... is the greatest menace
to intercollegiate athletics .. . because of
the extraneous coach and the by-prod
ucts that go with him, professionalism,
anything for victory, secret practice. .
Luckily for all of us, some courageous
students did stand up for the right to
play football and for the rest of us to see
games like Saturday's 52-16 loss to
Washington.

The annual freshman-sophomore
Mud Fight was canceled by the ASSU
due to lack of support. While admitting
"there wasn't anything indecent about
it,"the Mud Fight chairman agreed that
"the whole thing was a farce."
The Mud Fight, of course, was when a
few hundred members of each class tried
to throw as many of the others into a
huge mud pit.
Obviously what was needed was Mud
Fight yell leaders. If they had only half
the success of today's yell leaders, I can't
imagine how the Mud Fight would have
failed.
Interestingly enough, the Mud Fight
is still being held today. Make sure you
catch the next one this April between the

People's Platform and Students First.

Twenty masked students accosted
David Harris, student body president, as
he was about enter a house, and shaved
his head with electric clippers.
Harris sat quietly as they bound him
with tape, but was able to convince them

not to touch his beard. It was revealed
that the attacks were fraternity mem
bers, upset with recent actions by Harris
in the ASSU.
Now, I am not bringing this up to give
anybody on campus any ideas. I mean, if
you 're displeased with the actions of a
certain COP member, 1 certainly do not
think you should shave his or her head.
I would merely advocate stealing her
PAC number from the Stanford opera
tors and racking up huge long-distance
bills.
