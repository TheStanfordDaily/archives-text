## Opponents try not to throw to future pro's side 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The future does not make amends for
the present.
Not for Kevin Scott.
The outstanding Cardinal cornerback is
an almost sure pro prospect. He's an All-
American candidate. Been labeled the best
in the Pac-10. There're scouts following
him to every game.
Stanford's secondary, however, hasn't
been so successful this season.
No one points fingers, but when a team
completes six passes in just over a minute
to pull another victory out from under
Stanford's feet, the defensive backs aren't
performing as needed.
It's been a recurring theme this season.
And it weighs heavily on Scott.
"It's my secondary, too. I'm a part of it,"
he said. "It's frustrating to see big plays
happen to defensive backs. It's a DB's
nightmare to get beat for a touchdown or
have a big pass play against you, and I've
had a lot in my years."
The problem is, because Scott is so good,
opposing quarterbacks and receivers want
to avoid him. So the rest of the Cardinal
secondary is left to fend off the air attack
While Scott provides support.
But the rest of the secondary consists of
sophomores. And opponents have been
exploiting their youth.
"If any team takes a look at the [game]
film, they are most likely going to be throw
ing opposite him," said safety Jimmy Klein.
"Because we do play left-right corner,
another team can line up who they want."
And they have consistently been lining
their top receivers away from Scott, leaving
him to spout moral support and hope that
the action switches sides the next play.

And leaving the revolving lineup of right
corner, free safety and strong safety to deal
with the play the best they can.
"I knew the secondary would be young,
but I was hoping that as the year pro
gressed some of my style of play and the
way I play would rub off on the other guys,"
Scott said. "The secondary can play a lot
better than it is playing now."
Seeing your teammates struggle while
being forced to observe from the opposite
side of the field has got to be tough, but the
four-year starter is handling the situation
well.
Not one to complain, it's "help out when

Despite the somewhat lackluster performance this year by the Cardinal secondary, senior cornerback Kevin Scott hat NFL
scouts drooling. A four-year starter at Stanford, his presence on the field forces opposing quarterbacks to throw to the
otner corner.
