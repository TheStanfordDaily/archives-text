## Opponents try not to throw to future pro's side 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The future does not make amends for
the present.
Not for Kevin Scott.
The outstanding Cardinal cornerback is
an almost sure pro prospect. He's an All-
American candidate. Been labeled the best
in the Pac-10. There're scouts following
him to every game.
Stanford's secondary, however, hasn't
been so successful this season.
No one points fingers, but when a team
completes six passes in just over a minute
to pull another victory out from under
Stanford's feet, the defensive backs aren't
performing as needed.
It's been a recurring theme this season.
And it weighs heavily on Scott.
"It's my secondary, too. I'm a part of it,"
he said. "It's frustrating to see big plays
happen to defensive backs. It's a DB's
nightmare to get beat for a touchdown or
have a big pass play against you, and I've
had a lot in my years."
The problem is, because Scott is so good,
opposing quarterbacks and receivers want
to avoid him. So the rest of the Cardinal
secondary is left to fend off the air attack
While Scott provides support.
But the rest of the secondary consists of
sophomores. And opponents have been
exploiting their youth.
"If any team takes a look at the [game]
film, they are most likely going to be throw
ing opposite him," said safety Jimmy Klein.
"Because we do play left-right corner,
another team can line up who they want."
And they have consistently been lining
their top receivers away from Scott, leaving
him to spout moral support and hope that
the action switches sides the next play.

And leaving the revolving lineup of right
corner, free safety and strong safety to deal
with the play the best they can.
"I knew the secondary would be young,
but I was hoping that as the year pro
gressed some of my style of play and the
way I play would rub off on the other guys,"
Scott said. "The secondary can play a lot
better than it is playing now."
Seeing your teammates struggle while
being forced to observe from the opposite
side of the field has got to be tough, but the
four-year starter is handling the situation
well.
Not one to complain, it's "help out when

otner corner.
you can and wait for an opportu
nity to beat your man" for Scott.
"It's frustrating. I'd like to play
a bigger role in some of the action
out there, but when you try to do
things you shouldn't be doing is
when you hurt the defense," Scott
said. "The one time they do go to
my side I have to be there or I'm
going to get beat.
"It's a team sport. One individ
ual doesn't win games. But an
individual can lose a game on a big
play at my position by a lack of
concentration, a lack of focus. I
just have to always be ready."
While Scott may not have the
opportunity to constantly con
tribute through his actions, the
Cardinal is still reaping the bene
fits of his presence at all times.
Scott is the self-appointed

defensive leader, and a vocal one
at that.
If he can't break up a pass, at
least he can give the DB's, and the
linebackers and linemen, some
encouragement.
"He's been an inspiration for
the younger players," said defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw. "He
does it all as a leader and a senior.
He's really vocal, and he works on
keeping their spirits up."
"He leads by example — he
won't give you advice unless it's
blatantly obvious you need it or
you ask for it," Klein said. "[But]
he's pretty fired up. He really took
leadership responsibilites at the
beginning of this season and
really rallies the whole defense."
For Scott, it's just a part of the
game.
It's only natural to share his
experiences, good or bad, with his
backfield mates.
"Everybody gets burned, and

it's not a real good feeling," Scott
said. "It breaks some guys. You
have to be able to look at them
and say, 'look, don't worry about
it. You've got to bounce back, and
you've got to play hard the next
down.' There are players that can
fold tent after something like
that. If that starts happening the
secondary isn't going to be worth
a doodley-squat."
"I just try to keep everybody
together no matter how tough a
situation gets. Corner can be one
of the loneliest positions in the
world — if you give up a 40-yard
touchdown no one understands
the type of feelings you have. But
I can relate because I've had the
same experience. It's good for
them to hear from someone in the
same situation that it's okay,
you'll bounce back."
While Scott may have had his
troubles, the moments definitely
outshine the burns. He won a

starting job the third game of his
true freshman season and hasn't
left the field since. Whether it's
coverage, pass breakups or run
support, the senior has been a
force in the Stanford secondary
for four years.
Last season he teamed with
Alan Grant, now starting for the
Indianapolis Colts, to shut down
opponents' passing games. He had
two interceptions to go along with
15 deflected passes and 70 tackles.
The kickoff return specialist ran a
kickoff back 95 yards for a TD in
the Big Game, while grabbing one
interception and collecting 46
tackles his sophomore year.
This season has been more of
the same. Scott has intercepted
two passes and deflected another
four even though opponents try to
throw the other way. He has also
contributed 33 tackles to the oft
injured Stanford defense.
"For the most part he's been

playing very good football," Shaw
said. "He's been having a very
good season. He's a talented
young man."
But where is this talent going
to take him?
A bowl game looks out of the
question for the 2-5 Cardinal.
The NFL, however, appears to
be a distinct possibility for Scott.
The bowl representatives have
stopped attending Stanford con
tests, but the scouts are still
showing up, en masse. And there
aren't too many seniors on the
Cardinal's roster this season.
Of course all players can get
injured at any juncture of the sea
son, and there are many more
draftees than there are roster
spots, but at this point it looks
like Scott is on his way to the big
time. The fact that Grant not only
made the Colts' roster, but is
starting as a rookie, makes Scott

optimistic.
"I'd like to give the ol' pros a
shot. It's another challenge,"
Scott said. "There are a lot of
players that don't make it for a lot
of different reasons, and if it
doesn't work out I'll always have
my degree to fall back on. "[But]
Alan Grant is defintely an incen
tive. He's doing real well, and it's
making me think I can do the
same. We played together for
three years, we learned the same
technique. Seeing him be success
ful makes me think I can be as
successful."
The scouts seem to think the
same.
But the season's not over yet

he gets his chance real soon.

If you don't see Kevin Scott
bringing down the receivers this
weekend, he's the one congratu
lating his teammates and hoping
he gets his chance real soon.
The future does not make amends for
the present.
Not for Kevin Scott.
The outstanding Cardinal cornerback is
an almost sure pro prospect. He's an All-
American candidate. Been labeled the best
in the Pac-10. There're scouts following
him to every game.
Stanford's secondary, however, hasn't
been so successful this season.
No one points fingers, but when a team
completes six passes in just over a minute
to pull another victory out from under
Stanford's feet, the defensive backs aren't
performing as needed.
It's been a recurring theme this season.
And it weighs heavily on Scott.
"It's my secondary, too. I'm a part of it,"
he said. "It's frustrating to see big plays
happen to defensive backs. It's a DB's
nightmare to get beat for a touchdown or
have a big pass play against you, and I've
had a lot in my years."
The problem is, because Scott is so good,
opposing quarterbacks and receivers want
to avoid him. So the rest of the Cardinal
secondary is left to fend off the air attack
While Scott provides support.
But the rest of the secondary consists of
sophomores. And opponents have been
exploiting their youth.
"If any team takes a look at the [game]
film, they are most likely going to be throw
ing opposite him," said safety Jimmy Klein.
"Because we do play left-right corner,
another team can line up who they want."
And they have consistently been lining
their top receivers away from Scott, leaving
him to spout moral support and hope that
the action switches sides the next play.

And leaving the revolving lineup of right
corner, free safety and strong safety to deal
with the play the best they can.
"I knew the secondary would be young,
but I was hoping that as the year pro
gressed some of my style of play and the
way I play would rub off on the other guys,"
Scott said. "The secondary can play a lot
better than it is playing now."
Seeing your teammates struggle while
being forced to observe from the opposite
side of the field has got to be tough, but the
four-year starter is handling the situation

you can and wait for an opportu
nity to beat your man" for Scott.
"It's frustrating. I'd like to play
a bigger role in some of the action
out there, but when you try to do
things you shouldn't be doing is
when you hurt the defense," Scott
said. "The one time they do go to
my side I have to be there or I'm
going to get beat.
"It's a team sport. One individ
ual doesn't win games. But an
individual can lose a game on a big
play at my position by a lack of
concentration, a lack of focus. I
just have to always be ready."
While Scott may not have the
opportunity to constantly con
tribute through his actions, the
Cardinal is still reaping the bene
fits of his presence at all times.
Scott is the self-appointed

defensive leader, and a vocal one
at that.
If he can't break up a pass, at
least he can give the DB's, and the
linebackers and linemen, some
encouragement.
"He's been an inspiration for
the younger players," said defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw. "He
does it all as a leader and a senior.
He's really vocal, and he works on
keeping their spirits up."
"He leads by example — he
won't give you advice unless it's
blatantly obvious you need it or
you ask for it," Klein said. "[But]
he's pretty fired up. He really took
leadership responsibilites at the
beginning of this season and
really rallies the whole defense."
For Scott, it's just a part of the
game.
It's only natural to share his
experiences, good or bad, with his
backfield mates.
"Everybody gets burned, and

it's not a real good feeling," Scott
said. "It breaks some guys. You
have to be able to look at them
and say, 'look, don't worry about
it. You've got to bounce back, and
you've got to play hard the next
down.' There are players that can
fold tent after something like
that. If that starts happening the
secondary isn't going to be worth
a doodley-squat."
"I just try to keep everybody
together no matter how tough a
situation gets. Corner can be one
of the loneliest positions in the
world — if you give up a 40-yard
touchdown no one understands
the type of feelings you have. But
I can relate because I've had the
same experience. It's good for
them to hear from someone in the
same situation that it's okay,
you'll bounce back."
While Scott may have had his
troubles, the moments definitely
outshine the burns. He won a

starting job the third game of his
true freshman season and hasn't
left the field since. Whether it's
coverage, pass breakups or run
support, the senior has been a
force in the Stanford secondary
for four years.
Last season he teamed with
Alan Grant, now starting for the
Indianapolis Colts, to shut down
opponents' passing games. He had
two interceptions to go along with
15 deflected passes and 70 tackles.
The kickoff return specialist ran a
kickoff back 95 yards for a TD in
the Big Game, while grabbing one
interception and collecting 46
tackles his sophomore year.
This season has been more of
the same. Scott has intercepted
two passes and deflected another
four even though opponents try to
throw the other way. He has also
contributed 33 tackles to the oft
injured Stanford defense.
"For the most part he's been

playing very good football," Shaw
said. "He's been having a very
good season. He's a talented
young man."
But where is this talent going
to take him?
A bowl game looks out of the
question for the 2-5 Cardinal.
The NFL, however, appears to
be a distinct possibility for Scott.
The bowl representatives have
stopped attending Stanford con
tests, but the scouts are still
showing up, en masse. And there
aren't too many seniors on the
Cardinal's roster this season.
Of course all players can get
injured at any juncture of the sea
son, and there are many more
draftees than there are roster
spots, but at this point it looks
like Scott is on his way to the big
time. The fact that Grant not only
made the Colts' roster, but is
starting as a rookie, makes Scott

optimistic.
"I'd like to give the ol' pros a
shot. It's another challenge,"
Scott said. "There are a lot of
players that don't make it for a lot
of different reasons, and if it
doesn't work out I'll always have
my degree to fall back on. "[But]
Alan Grant is defintely an incen
tive. He's doing real well, and it's
making me think I can do the
