vilion.
RECORDS - Stanford (2-5, 1-3 and 9th In

MATCHUPS — Stanford is coming off a
humiliating loss to Washington at home,
and Oregon, although it did beat BYU, has
only one Pac-10 victory to its name. The
question is: Can Stanford bounce back?
Probably. But the Ducks are by no means
easy fodder. Musgrave is one of the top
quarterbacks In the nation, and Stanford's
secondary Stanford needs to have a
balanced attack, which means getting the
run going, and early — something It hasn't
done In three weeks. And of course, Stan
ford needs to shut down Musgrave as well
as watch out for the sneaky Duck's
balanced attack.
