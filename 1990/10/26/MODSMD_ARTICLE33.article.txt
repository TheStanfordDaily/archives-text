# The 						Pac-10 rules
## 
### 
Well, it's another Satur
day tomorrow, and
Stanford is facing yet
another top-caliber football
team. This time the Cardinal
plays Oregon, which is ranked
No. 25 in the country and has a
record of 5-2. The Ducks actu
ally seem like a break in the
schedule, after playing Notre
Dame, USC and Washington in
recent weeks.
You can blame it on schedul
ing, or you can blame it on
playing in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, which has been and
continues to be the best foot
ball conference in the nation.

Oregon, you see, knocked off
then No. 4-ranked Brigham
Young early in the year.
Crushed them, really. And
Stanford, which has been
tossed around in the Pac-10
this year, stuck one to then No.
1 Notre Dame four weeks ago.
These are two of the "sec
ond-rung" Pac-10 schools, yet
they were able to defeat two of
the nation's best teams.
The strength of the confer
ence lies in these middle layer
teams. Top to bottom, every
school in the Pac-10 has a
respectable program. (Okay,
maybe Oregon State is the
weak link, but did you notice
the Beavers just upset Arizona
up in Corvallis? They took
down the goal posts after
wards.)
Not that the Pac-10 doesn't
have its powerhouses. I'd take
the Washington Huskies
against anyone right now. The
Dawgs are just pulverizing peo
ple. Their only loss is to Col
orado in the first game of the
season, and my hunch is that
they would beat the Buffaloes
if they played again.
USC, of course, is always
right there, and 1 wouldn't be
surprised if the Trojans took it
to Notre Dame in two weeks.
(Somehow I doubt that if USC
quarterback Todd Marinovich
had been discovered skipping
classes next week he would
have been benched.)
Historically, UCLA has been
a top-notch program, and when
it comes to New Year's Day, the
Bruins always seem to be play
ing somewhere (they played in
eight straight bowl games
before 1989) and winning.
Arizona and Arizona State
seem to trade off years being
good, but neither team is an
easy matchup.
Washington State's program
has risen to prominence of late,
and has produced several good
NFL players (Tim Rosenbach,
Steve Broussard.)
That leaves Stanford and

California usually in the bot
tom bracket of the league, not
because of lack of talent on
their part, really, but just by
default to the other great
teams of the conference.
The Pac-10 has established
complete dominance over the
Big 10 Conference in the Rose
Bowl. This year, the Fiesta
Bowl, which traditionally hosts
two very highly-ranked teams
and has decided the national
championship in several recent
years, now wants to invite the
Pac-10 runner-up this year.
Annually, the Pac-10 proves
that it is better than the Big
-10, winning most of the regular
season matchups as well as
stomping Michigan or Michi
gan State in the Rose Bowl.
The Big Eight has three
high-profile teams in
Nebraska, Oklahoma and Col
orado, but then offers up Okla
homa State, Kansas, Kansas
State, Missouri and lowa State.
The conference which comes
closest to matching the Pac-10
is probably the Southeast Con
ference. This year, the SEC has
more teams in the top 20 than
the Pac-10 and consistently
does well in bowl season. But
although the SEC boasts
Auburn, Alabama, Florida,
Tennessee and Georgia, they
also have Kentucky and Missis
sippi pulling the conference
down.
Probably the two best teams
in the South, Miami and
Florida State, are indepen
dents. And as for the Associ
ated Press rankings, my feeling
is that the Pac-10 gets slighted
in the voting. Top Pac-10 teams
will often have a few losses, but
that is a direct reflection of the
competition within the confer
ence.
And anyway, the Pac-10 con
sistently places three or four
teams in the top 20 by season's
end. In fact, during the 1980s,
the Pac-10 placed the most
teams, 37, in the final AP top
20 of any conference. The Pac
-10 interconference record for
the '80s is also untouchable.
But the most convincing
argument to support the Pac
-10 is that year after year, the
great conference of the West
has the most players drafted
into the NFL. Currently, Pac
-10 players make up the highest
contingency of professional
football players.
Particularly with offensive
linemen and defensive backs,
the Pac-10 supplies the NFL
with its top performers. At the
safety position alone, one Pac
-10 school, USC, has produced
Ronnie Lott, Joey Browner,
and Mark Carrier.
USC also has the most play
ers in any position in the NFL
of any school in the country.
UCLA and Arizona State are
third and fourth, respectively.
The Cardinal has the per
sonnel to be competitive. It just
also happens to play in the
most intensely competitive
conference in the land.

20 of any conference. The Pac
-10 interconference record for
the '80s is also untouchable.
But the most convincing
argument to support the Pac
-10 is that year after year, the
great conference of the West
has the most players drafted
into the NFL. Currently, Pac
-10 players make up the highest
contingency of professional
football players.
Particularly with offensive
linemen and defensive backs,
the Pac-10 supplies the NFL
with its top performers. At the
safety position alone, one Pac
-10 school, USC, has produced
Ronnie Lott, Joey Browner,
and Mark Carrier.
USC also has the most play
ers in any position in the NFL
of any school in the country.
UCLA and Arizona State are
third and fourth, respectively.
The Cardinal has the per
sonnel to be competitive. It just
also happens to play in the
most intensely competitive
conference in the land.

Well, it's another Satur
day tomorrow, and
Stanford is facing yet
another top-caliber football
team. This time the Cardinal
plays Oregon, which is ranked
No. 25 in the country and has a
record of 5-2. The Ducks actu
ally seem like a break in the
schedule, after playing Notre
Dame, USC and Washington in
recent weeks.
You can blame it on schedul
ing, or you can blame it on
playing in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, which has been and
continues to be the best foot
ball conference in the nation.

Oregon, you see, knocked off
then No. 4-ranked Brigham
Young early in the year.
Crushed them, really. And
Stanford, which has been
tossed around in the Pac-10
this year, stuck one to then No.
1 Notre Dame four weeks ago.
These are two of the "sec
ond-rung" Pac-10 schools, yet
they were able to defeat two of
the nation's best teams.
The strength of the confer
ence lies in these middle layer
teams. Top to bottom, every
school in the Pac-10 has a
respectable program. (Okay,
maybe Oregon State is the
weak link, but did you notice
the Beavers just upset Arizona
up in Corvallis? They took
down the goal posts after
wards.)
Not that the Pac-10 doesn't
have its powerhouses. I'd take
the Washington Huskies
against anyone right now. The
Dawgs are just pulverizing peo
ple. Their only loss is to Col
orado in the first game of the
season, and my hunch is that
they would beat the Buffaloes
if they played again.
USC, of course, is always
right there, and 1 wouldn't be
surprised if the Trojans took it
to Notre Dame in two weeks.
(Somehow I doubt that if USC
quarterback Todd Marinovich
had been discovered skipping
classes next week he would
have been benched.)
Historically, UCLA has been
a top-notch program, and when
it comes to New Year's Day, the
Bruins always seem to be play
ing somewhere (they played in
eight straight bowl games
before 1989) and winning.
Arizona and Arizona State
seem to trade off years being
good, but neither team is an
easy matchup.
Washington State's program
has risen to prominence of late,
and has produced several good
NFL players (Tim Rosenbach,
Steve Broussard.)
That leaves Stanford and

California usually in the bot
tom bracket of the league, not
because of lack of talent on
their part, really, but just by
default to the other great
teams of the conference.
The Pac-10 has established
complete dominance over the
Big 10 Conference in the Rose
Bowl. This year, the Fiesta
Bowl, which traditionally hosts
two very highly-ranked teams
and has decided the national
championship in several recent
years, now wants to invite the
Pac-10 runner-up this year.
Annually, the Pac-10 proves
that it is better than the Big
-10, winning most of the regular
season matchups as well as
stomping Michigan or Michi
gan State in the Rose Bowl.
The Big Eight has three
high-profile teams in
Nebraska, Oklahoma and Col
orado, but then offers up Okla
homa State, Kansas, Kansas
State, Missouri and lowa State.
The conference which comes
closest to matching the Pac-10
is probably the Southeast Con
ference. This year, the SEC has
more teams in the top 20 than
the Pac-10 and consistently
does well in bowl season. But
although the SEC boasts
Auburn, Alabama, Florida,
Tennessee and Georgia, they
also have Kentucky and Missis
sippi pulling the conference
down.
Probably the two best teams
in the South, Miami and
Florida State, are indepen
dents. And as for the Associ
ated Press rankings, my feeling
is that the Pac-10 gets slighted
in the voting. Top Pac-10 teams
will often have a few losses, but
that is a direct reflection of the
competition within the confer
ence.
And anyway, the Pac-10 con
sistently places three or four
teams in the top 20 by season's
end. In fact, during the 1980s,
the Pac-10 placed the most
teams, 37, in the final AP top
20 of any conference. The Pac
-10 interconference record for
the '80s is also untouchable.
