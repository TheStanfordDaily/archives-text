# Klein howitzers opponents into dust
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Kristin Klein was six minutes
late to her first meeting as a mem
ber of the Cardinal volleyball
team.
Since then, the team has never
started without her.
Literally.
"For our preseason meeting
before her first year, Kristin was
maybe five minutes late," Coach
Don Shaw said. "I worked her
hard in practice. She has never
been late since."
That's kind of what Klein is all
about. One letdown is one too
many; one lesson is one too few.
"Kristin really helps us out,"
sophomore middle blocker Bev
Oden said. "You can always count
on her."
Which is exactly what No. 5
Stanford intends to do when the
squad engages Arizona State (13-
11) tonight at 7:30. While the tal
ented Cardinal features a daunt
ing array of players, it is Klein
who will lay the groundwork for
Stanford's attack.
Ever since that fateful day two
years ago, this has been the case.
Coming to the Farm as one of the
top recruits in the nation, Klein
immediately stepped into the Car
dinal lineup. She launched the
team to a 28-2 regular season
mark and a No. 2 national rank
ing.
Since then, Klein has been
named first and second team All-
American and has become the
prudential rock of a solid Stanford
team.
"She's a really good all-around
player in every phase of the
game," Oden said.
This much is a given. The 6-
foot outside hitter is one of the
most impressive in the country.
Five times this year Klein has tal
lied 20 kills or more in a match.
Against UCLA last weekend, she

recorded 27 kills, 28 digs and four
service aces.
Early in the year, she had hit
ting practice against Syracuse,
crushing 20 kills and hitting .500.
Currently, Klein has a .305 hitting
percentage and 262 kills.
Statistics like these aren't
much of a surprise, though. In her
freshman and sophomore years,
Klein set a kills pace that projects
her to be Stanford's all-time
career kills leader. If she can
maintain her current output, the
Pacific Palisades product will sur
pass Kim Oden's all-time mark
sometime next year.
Oden, who played for Stanford
during the years 1982-85, is now
the captain of the U.S. National
team and is widely considered the
all-time premier women's player.
Comparisons like this say a lot
about someone who as a seventh
grader was "tall, skinny and not
very good." But sitting on the
bench once was enough. The fol
lowing year Klein began to blos
som.
So much so that by her senior
year in high school, Klein was one
of the most sought-after preps in
the country. Andy Banachowski,
the head coach of No. 1 UCLA,
makes no secret of the matter.
"I thought she was potentially
one of the best players coming out
of high school," Banachowski
said. "She's developed very well as
I certainly would have expected.
We were obviously very disap

pointed when she elected not to go
to UCLA."
The common spectator may
imagine that right now Klein may
be, too. Despite the numerous
individual honors, Klein has never

played on a team that has beaten
UCLA. In the six times that Stan
ford has met the mighty Bruins
during Klein's career, the Cardi
nal has lost every time.

Outside hitter Kristin Klein has been devastating Stanford's ene
mies for three years. Her powerful spikes earned her the nickname
"Magnum" her freshman year, when she was dubbed first team All
America.
This fact takes on broader
implications. Because UCLA and
Stanford play in the same confer
ence, it is entirely possible that
Stanford may never go to the
Final Four during Klein's career.
But this ominous scenario is
the least of Klein's concerns. "I
love the volleyball here, I love the
team," Klein said. "I think we
have a really bright future."
So does everyone else, thanks
largely to Klein.
"Kristin gives us a lot in terms
of character and competitive
instinct," Shaw said. "We can
count on Kristin to give us every
thing she's got. That's what really
makes her stand out."
Casual observation of the fiery
hitter provides ample evidence of
this fact. Klein will scratch and
claw for any stray ball that hap
pens to wander into her hemi
sphere.
"She's such a fighter," fresh
man setter Piper Hahn said. "You
can always go to her in tight situ
ations. She's very trustworthy."
To Klein, feelings like this are
the ideal culmination of her
efforts. If there is anything she
enjoys better than personal suc
cess, it is her ability to inspire oth
ers to comparable levels of confi
dence.
"I'm a strong believer in this,"
Klein said. "I've always been
really determined. I think a lot of
things are contagious, so I just try
to pick everyone up."
Often, everyone includes her
self. Klein's career has been enor
mously successful, but almost
anyone will say she's just tapping
the surface of her talented
resources
"Kristin is still learning a lot of
things," Shaw said. "She keeps
getting a little better every day.
She can get frustrated at times,
but she keeps working on it. She
certainly can get better."
A fact that, in all honesty, is
quite scary. Ultimately, however,
she hopes to play for the U.S.
National team representing the
country at the Olympic Games.
Klein, a psychology major, would
also consider playing profession
ally if the opportunity ever pre
sented itself.
Adapting to the international
game of volleyball will prove a
menacing task. In Klein's case,
however, there is little room for
doubt. Learning new situations
for her is relatively easy. Think
about it. Two years ago, six min
utes made all the difference.

Coming to the Farm as one of the
top recruits in the nation, Klein
immediately stepped into the Car
dinal lineup. She launched the
team to a 28-2 regular season
mark and a No. 2 national rank
ing.
Since then, Klein has been
named first and second team All-
American and has become the
prudential rock of a solid Stanford
team.
"She's a really good all-around
player in every phase of the
game," Oden said.
This much is a given. The 6-
foot outside hitter is one of the
most impressive in the country.
Five times this year Klein has tal
lied 20 kills or more in a match.
Against UCLA last weekend, she

recorded 27 kills, 28 digs and four
service aces.
Early in the year, she had hit
ting practice against Syracuse,
crushing 20 kills and hitting .500.
Currently, Klein has a .305 hitting
percentage and 262 kills.
Statistics like these aren't
much of a surprise, though. In her
freshman and sophomore years,
Klein set a kills pace that projects
her to be Stanford's all-time
career kills leader. If she can
maintain her current output, the
Pacific Palisades product will sur
pass Kim Oden's all-time mark
sometime next year.
Oden, who played for Stanford
during the years 1982-85, is now
the captain of the U.S. National
team and is widely considered the
all-time premier women's player.
Comparisons like this say a lot
about someone who as a seventh
grader was "tall, skinny and not
very good." But sitting on the
bench once was enough. The fol
lowing year Klein began to blos
som.
So much so that by her senior
year in high school, Klein was one
of the most sought-after preps in
the country. Andy Banachowski,
the head coach of No. 1 UCLA,
makes no secret of the matter.
"I thought she was potentially
one of the best players coming out
of high school," Banachowski
said. "She's developed very well as
I certainly would have expected.
We were obviously very disap

pointed when she elected not to go
to UCLA."
The common spectator may
imagine that right now Klein may
be, too. Despite the numerous
individual honors, Klein has never

played on a team that has beaten
UCLA. In the six times that Stan
ford has met the mighty Bruins
during Klein's career, the Cardi
nal has lost every time.

Outside hitter Kristin Klein has been devastating Stanford's ene
mies for three years. Her powerful spikes earned her the nickname
"Magnum" her freshman year, when she was dubbed first team All
America.
This fact takes on broader
implications. Because UCLA and
Stanford play in the same confer
ence, it is entirely possible that
Stanford may never go to the
Final Four during Klein's career.
But this ominous scenario is
the least of Klein's concerns. "I
love the volleyball here, I love the
team," Klein said. "I think we
have a really bright future."
So does everyone else, thanks
largely to Klein.
"Kristin gives us a lot in terms
of character and competitive
instinct," Shaw said. "We can
count on Kristin to give us every
thing she's got. That's what really
makes her stand out."
Casual observation of the fiery
hitter provides ample evidence of
this fact. Klein will scratch and
claw for any stray ball that hap
pens to wander into her hemi
sphere.
"She's such a fighter," fresh
man setter Piper Hahn said. "You
can always go to her in tight situ
ations. She's very trustworthy."
To Klein, feelings like this are
the ideal culmination of her
efforts. If there is anything she
enjoys better than personal suc
cess, it is her ability to inspire oth
ers to comparable levels of confi
dence.
"I'm a strong believer in this,"
Klein said. "I've always been
really determined. I think a lot of
things are contagious, so I just try
to pick everyone up."
Often, everyone includes her
self. Klein's career has been enor
mously successful, but almost
anyone will say she's just tapping
the surface of her talented
resources
"Kristin is still learning a lot of
things," Shaw said. "She keeps
getting a little better every day.
She can get frustrated at times,
but she keeps working on it. She
certainly can get better."
A fact that, in all honesty, is
quite scary. Ultimately, however,
she hopes to play for the U.S.
National team representing the
country at the Olympic Games.
Klein, a psychology major, would
also consider playing profession
ally if the opportunity ever pre
sented itself.
Adapting to the international
game of volleyball will prove a
menacing task. In Klein's case,
however, there is little room for
doubt. Learning new situations
for her is relatively easy. Think
about it. Two years ago, six min
utes made all the difference.
Kristin Klein was six minutes
late to her first meeting as a mem
ber of the Cardinal volleyball
team.
Since then, the team has never
started without her.
Literally.
"For our preseason meeting
before her first year, Kristin was
maybe five minutes late," Coach
Don Shaw said. "I worked her
hard in practice. She has never
been late since."
That's kind of what Klein is all
about. One letdown is one too
many; one lesson is one too few.
"Kristin really helps us out,"
sophomore middle blocker Bev
Oden said. "You can always count
on her."
Which is exactly what No. 5
Stanford intends to do when the
squad engages Arizona State (13-
11) tonight at 7:30. While the tal
ented Cardinal features a daunt
ing array of players, it is Klein
who will lay the groundwork for
Stanford's attack.
