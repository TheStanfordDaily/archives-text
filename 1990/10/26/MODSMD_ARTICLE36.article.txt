# No. 7 Card women tune up for NCAA's
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
After playing four games in a row against
NCAA tournament-bound opponents, the
women's soccer team tomorrow finally gets to
play a team that it should beat.
But Stanford coach Berhane Andeberhan
hopes his team will play like an underdog,
even if the No. 7 Cardinal (14-2-1) aren't on
the road against a powerhouse enemy. The
Dons of the University of San Francisco (6-9-
2) visit Maloney Field at 2 p.m.
"It's something we're taking seriously,"
said Andeberhan, whose team won games at
No. 8 North Carolina State and No. 12 Duke
last weekend. "They have a few good players,
but I think we'll be ready to play."
Stanford, on the verge of b«ing invited to its
first-ever NCAA tournament, must first dance
past the Dons before the 12 golden NCAA
tournament invitations are extended Monday
morning. It is the final regular season game of
the season for Stanford, and most likely the
last home game.
Stanford could be excused for looking
ahead to the playoffs. The Cardinal will prob
ably be the third seed from the West and will
likely play a first-round game on the road next
weekend.
"We're in good shape," said Andeberhan,
who this week conferred with other national

coaches by phone. "I'd be surprised if we
didn't make it, but I've been surprised
before."
Santa Clara and UC-Santa Barbara — the
only two teams Stanford has lost to — are also
playofT-bound, and at least one will receive a
first-round bye. The top four seeds receive
passes to the second round.
If Santa Barbara does not receive a bye,
Stanford might expect to visit the Gauchos.
Andeberhan, who personally ranks Santa
Clara, Virginia, Santa Barbara and North Car
olina as the top teams, speculated his team
might also play Wisconsin or Colorado Col
lege, among others.
Stanford has played four games in a row
against ranked teams, recording three wins
and a tie, so the Dons will be a welcome respite
before the playoffs.
But the last time Stanford trailed in a game
was against another "beatable" team, UC-
Davis. Stanford slumbered in the first half,
but recovered for a 2-1 win over the Division II
Aggies.
Andeberhan will be on the lookout for com
placency tomorrow, but he's much more con
cerned about finding 11 healthy players. Stan
ford took a physical beating in North Carolina
and has not fully recovered. Junior Elizabeth
Joneschild is out for the year with a broken
leg, and seniors Jen Bloomer and Jennifer
Rowland are hampered by knee ii\juries.

And USF, which lost to California 1-0 at
home Wednesday, is not going to roll over dead
just because Stanford is playoff-bound. The
Dons battled Stanford last year in a 1-0 defeat,
and have played their most difficult schedule
ever in 1990.
