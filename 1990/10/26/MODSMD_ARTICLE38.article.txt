# Sophomore Krpata a veritable wall in the goal box
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
When a soccer player is a three
time member of the California
State team, a one-time participant
on the 1988-89 West Regional
squad, and the goalkeeper for the
under-20 U.S. National team in
the summer of 1989, it is hard to
believe that he could get much
better.
But, that is exactly what Stan
ford's sophomore keeper Kyle
Krpata has done, and he gives the
credit to the new coaching staff.
"Last year I played in about
half the games, but it wasn't con
sistent playing time," said Krpata.
"It would have been a little better
to let a freshman know in advance
when he was going to play. Some
times I would find out on the way
to the field that I was going to
start. It is a lot different this
year."
Indeed it is. Coach Colin Lin
dores penciled Krpata into the
starting lineup on opening day,
and he has stayed there ever since.
Assistant coach Greg Peterson
has helped Krpata find this year's
success. "Last season we didn't
have a goal keeper trainer, but we
do this year with Greg," said the
sophomore. "He told me what I
needed to do, and I've gotten bet
ter. Now I feel totally confident
out there, like no one can score on
me."
Stanford midfielder Tim Keyes
has recognized this improvement.
"This year he has been great and
has kept us in a lot of games that

an average keeper wouldn't have.
He dominates the box. He has got
ten more confident and a lot bet
ter."
Krpata played a practical joke
on his new coach, Peterson, when
the Cardinal was returning from a
Washington roadtrip by plane. He
had the stewardess announce over
the plane's PA. system that Peter
son's girlfriend had been pregnant
and delivered twins in San Jose
while the team had been in Wash
ington. Along with a red face,
Peterson received a large round of
applause from his fellow passen
gers.
Krpata feels that this atmo
sphere is a new and welcome addi
tion to the Cardinal squad. "Last
year nobody was very happy. We
were too uptight," the keeper said.
"This year, everywhere we go we
are laughing, and it is due to Colin
and Greg both."
But the Cardinal keeper isn't
all play and no work. He has
recorded four shutouts and has
had exceptional games against
nationally ranked teams. Take for
instance, the match against No. 1
Evansville where the keeper only
allowed one goal and helped the
Cardinal come away with a tie. Or
look at the game against the
nationally ranked Portland Pis
tons when he only allowed one of
the Pistons' eight shots to reach
the back of the net as the Cardinal

recorded an upset.
What is amazing is that there is
reason to believe that Krpata has
room to improve. "Krpata has
played some great games for us
and his confidence has increased,
but he can get better," said Lin*
dores. "He can become a great
Division I player, and we are going
to work with him to get him to
that point."

'He has kept us in
a lot of games that
an average keeper
wouldn't have.'
— Tim Keyes

Tim Keyes is frightened by
such an idea. "He has two years to
get even better, and that is kind of
a scary thought."
But what is really scary is the
fact that the whole squad could be
getting better. If the team is able
to win its remaining three games,
it will reach 10 wins, a feat the
players have accomplished only
once in the last four years. The
first team standing in their way ia
Sacramento State, who they play
at home tomorrow.
"Sacramento hasn't had a good;
season," said Lindores. "This is
the classic example of Stanford
facing a team that is below us.»
Will we play down at their level or
above them? Will we stub our
toes?"

is no question when he is going to start: every game. A top goalkeeper since high school, Krpata has

out there, like no one can score on
me."
Stanford midfielder Tim Keyes
has recognized this improvement.
"This year he has been great and
has kept us in a lot of games that

an average keeper wouldn't have.
He dominates the box. He has got
ten more confident and a lot bet
ter."
Krpata played a practical joke
on his new coach, Peterson, when
the Cardinal was returning from a
Washington roadtrip by plane. He
had the stewardess announce over
the plane's PA. system that Peter
son's girlfriend had been pregnant
and delivered twins in San Jose
while the team had been in Wash
ington. Along with a red face,
Peterson received a large round of
applause from his fellow passen
gers.
Krpata feels that this atmo
sphere is a new and welcome addi
tion to the Cardinal squad. "Last
year nobody was very happy. We
were too uptight," the keeper said.
"This year, everywhere we go we
are laughing, and it is due to Colin
and Greg both."
But the Cardinal keeper isn't
all play and no work. He has
recorded four shutouts and has
had exceptional games against
nationally ranked teams. Take for
instance, the match against No. 1
Evansville where the keeper only
allowed one goal and helped the
Cardinal come away with a tie. Or
look at the game against the
nationally ranked Portland Pis
tons when he only allowed one of
the Pistons' eight shots to reach
the back of the net as the Cardinal

recorded an upset.
What is amazing is that there is
reason to believe that Krpata has
room to improve. "Krpata has
played some great games for us
and his confidence has increased,
but he can get better," said Lin*
dores. "He can become a great
Division I player, and we are going
to work with him to get him to
that point."

'He has kept us in
a lot of games that
an average keeper
wouldn't have.'
— Tim Keyes

Tim Keyes is frightened by
such an idea. "He has two years to
get even better, and that is kind of
a scary thought."
But what is really scary is the
fact that the whole squad could be
getting better. If the team is able
to win its remaining three games,
it will reach 10 wins, a feat the
players have accomplished only
once in the last four years. The
first team standing in their way ia
Sacramento State, who they play
at home tomorrow.
"Sacramento hasn't had a good;
season," said Lindores. "This is
the classic example of Stanford
facing a team that is below us.»
Will we play down at their level or
above them? Will we stub our
toes?"

Sophomore goalie Kyle Krpata used to be told that he would start a game on the way there. Now there
is no question when he is going to start: every game. A top goalkeeper since high school, Krpata has
continued to improve. He hopes to lead the Cardinal to the NCAAs In future years.
