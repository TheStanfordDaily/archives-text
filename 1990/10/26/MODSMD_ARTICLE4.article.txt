# Libraries to go high tech by next fall

Like the Draw and ASSU fee refunds,
University libraries could join the trend
toward computerization by implement
ing automated checkout as soon as fall
quarter of 1991.
In addition to expediting checkout,
the new system will increase efficiency
and eliminate time spent on paperwork,
according to project manager Cath Tier
ney. The system, known as the North
western Technical Information System,
will work in coi\junction with Socrates,
the on-line card catalog.
The project has been divided into two
phases, the first of which is currently
being implemented, Tierney said. New
acquisitions can now be cataloged by
computer as soon as they are received.
As a result, they can be placed in circu
lation overnight, rather than after a few
weeks as with the old system.
In addition, requests for new acquisi
tions can be processed by computer so

that librarians can see whether an item
has been ordered or when it is expected
to arrive.
Planners are just beginning to for
mulate the second phase, which will
convert the libraries to automated circu
lation, Tierney said. Under the new sys
tem, patrons will have a card with a bar
code 1.D., similar to those on student
meal cards, which will contain the infor
mation they currently have to write on
checkout cards.
Many students feel the manual
checkout system is tedious and ineffi
cient. Library staff also said they find
the system inadequate, since they often
have to decipher illegible handwriting.
With the new system, both patrons and
staff will benefit, said Joan Krasner,
chief of access services at Green Library.
"Automated circulation has sort of
been on everybody's wish list for a long
time," she said.
When the new computer system is
linked to Socrates, users will be able to

determine from a terminal whether
needed books are in the library before
physically hunting for them.
Another time-saver will be increased
efficiency in processing overdue notices,
Krasner said. Patrons with overdue
books can be notified earlier, and hope
fully, materials will be returned to the
shelves sooner, she added.
Although library staff said they hope
automated circulation will be imple
mented as soon as possible, the target
date will not be set for another three or
four months, Tierney said.
"We are still very much in the process
of deciding what kind of time frame is
needed to have circulation running,"
she said.
Final decisions about when each
library will receive the system have not
yet been made, although acquisition will
most likely happen one library at a time,
Krasner said. The Lane Medical Library
already has automated circulation.
