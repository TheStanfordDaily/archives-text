# Third-ranked linksters in third place
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
. The preseason women's golf
rankings proved accurate as No. 1
Arizona, No. 2 San Jose State and
No. 3 Stanford finished in that
same order after the first round of
the Stanford Women's Intercolle

giate.
Arizona finished yesterday
with 293. "Arizona really played
as a team. They had a tremendous
round of golf," Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin said.
Freshman Annika Sorenstram
led the Wildcats with 67, six under
par. Sorenstram is the No. 1 ama

teur in Sweden and also plays on
the Swedish World Cup Team.
"She is truly one heck of a player,"
said Baldwin.
Finishing second behind Soren
stram was Stanford's Adele
Moore. Moore finished with 70.
She was two under par on the
front nine and one under par on

the back.
"I was happy. I played pretty
solid," said Moore. "I paired on
the first hole and decided it would
be a good day. I kept a mellow atti
tude after that, and it helped me
stay calm."
Moore had a little trouble on
the back nine, bogeying both the
10th and 11th holes. M I told
myself I could get it back," said
Moore. And she did. She birdied
the last two holes, putting her in
second place for the day.
Audrey Wooding and Jodi
Figley each finished the first
round with 76, Stephanie Davis
scored 78 and Melinda Daniels
ended yesterday with 90.
Overall, Baldwin was happy
with the day. Stanford finished
the round with 300, four points
behind San Jose State.
"Today the girls felt good, but
that they can do better. Audrey,
Jodi and Stephanie played well
but didn't putt well. Tomorrow
they'll score better; they're all
tough girls," Baldwin said.
Moore had similar feelings
about the team. "We stuck
together as a unit and pulled in a
good score. We can do better as the
week goes on."
All the scores have been gener
ally low so far. Moore attributes
this to the course and the weather.
"The course is in great shape, and
the weather is perfect; it's con
ducive to low scores."
The Stanford women have a
tough job ahead of them. They
are seven shots behind Arizona,
and they have Indiana and SMU
hot in pursuit with 301. But with
low scores and solid shots, the
Cardinal could pull a mtyor upset
victory this weekend.
