"I'm the geek at the tennis courts. Every
spare minute I've had, I've been studying,"
said No. 1 seed Debbie Graham.
"They are studying like crazy," confirmed
assistant women's tennis Coach Lele Forood.
The midterm crunch has hit the Stanford
netters hard, but it did not prevent them from
turning in some great performances yesterday
at the Riviera All-American Championships.
Graham took a few minutes off from studying
to demolish her first round opponent, Missis
sippi's Poloma Collantes, 6-0, 6-1.
"My serve was working well," said Graham.
"I was really working on serving and volley
ing. Sometimes I wait until I'm winning to
serve and volley instead of coming in at the
beginning. I was trying to be as aggressive as
possible." Graham will tiy to continue her
aggressive play today against Kimberly Po of
UCLA.
"I'm expecting a really tough match. I'm
not going to take it lightly at all," said Gra
ham.
Another Stanford netter who crushed her
first round opponent was Heather Willens.
The victim was Arizona's Daniella Scott.

"Heather had a great win," said Forood, of
the 6-0, 6-1 victory. "Heather ran everything
down and eventually wore her down." Willens'
opponent today is No. 4 seed Shannan
McCarthy of Georgia.
"Heather will do well because Shannan is
an aggressive serve and volley player," said
Forood. This will play into Willens' hands
because "one of her strengths is her return of
serve," Forood said.
Both Willens and Graham dominated their
singles matches, but a few other netters were
not as fortunate. Teri Whitlinger was one of
two Cardinal netters who were beaten in the
first round. Whitlinger had the misfortune to
play the No. 3 seed in the first round.
"Teri had the toughest draw," said Forood.
USC'B Trisha Laux beat Whitlinger 6-3, 6-2.
Forood cited Whitlinger's inconsistent shot
making and Laux's strong play as reasons for
the loss.
The other Stanford netter to share
Whitlinger's fate was freshman Laxmi Poruri.
UCLA's Iwalani McCalla defeated Poruri in a
close match, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-3.
"Laxmi really had her," said Forood.
"McCalla definitely raised the level of her
game."

The draw does not get any easier for
McCalla. Her next opponent is defending
champion Sandra Birch. The Cardinal netter
is coming off a convincing 6-3, 6-2 victory over
Pam Piorkowski of Boston College. Birch has
had trouble with McCalla in past tourna
ments. "McCalla beat her last year at Palm
Springs," said Forood.
Birch's singles match against McCalla is
not the last time in the tournament the two
will meet. Birch and Graham are facing
McCalla and Po in a second-round doubles
match. Birch and Graham got to this point by
defeating Georgia's Shannan and Shawn
McCarthy 6-4, 6-4.
The extra concentration paid off. "They
were very sharp when they had to be," said
Forood. "They had to battle back from down a
break in the second set ... then they won
three games in a row and won the match."
The other Cardinal tandem also fared well
in the first round. No. 4 seeds Whitlinger and
Poruri avenged their singles losses by domi
nating South Carolina's Michelle Duda and
Nathalie Rodriguez 6-4, 6-2. Next for the duo
is Janna Kovacevich and Noelle Porter of Pep
perdine.
