# Accetta races with Card into Pac-10's

What's going on in Col
orado?
Stanford has been dipping
into the Rocky Mountain
State's talented crop of run
ners with terrific success. In a
state known primarily for its
Super Bowl losers, it's a
refreshing change to find an
occasional winner there.
Junior Alex Accetta is one of
them.
The Durango native recently
won the individual title at the
NorCal Invitational to clinch a
spot on Stanford's Pacific 10
Conference Championship ros
ter. He will go to the starting
line at this weekend's event as
the team's number-five runner,
a role that was at first difficult
for Accetta to swallow.
"I came to Stanford hoping
to be number one on the team
and wound up putting too
much pressure on myself,"
Accetta said. "It's tough to
swallow your pride, but by set
ting my sights a little lower I'm
able to run better and help the
team more."
The fact that Accetta, along
with juniors Fred Carter and
Dave Scudamore, was made a
tri-captain at the start of the
year put an even greater bur
den on Accetta's shoulders.
"I felt that I had to lead by
example," he said. "I think I
managed to do that in practice,
but I felt that I wasn't doing it
in races because I was trying
too hard. Now, I know that if I
can run a good race and still
have three or four teammates
finish in front of me, then
that's great."
Accetta has helped several of
his teammates along by push
ing them along both in practice
and in races. "[At the NorCal
Invite], I started feeling really
good sifter a couple of miles
and, before I picked it up, I
shouted to Brett [Allsop],
'Come on, stay with me,' and
he did."
Allsop wound up taking sec
ond to Accetta in the race, and
will join him at the Pac-10's.
Accetta must not be used to
having to spur people on, as
throughout his high school
career there were very few peo
ple within shouting distance of
him when he got to the finish
line. An All-American in high
school, his only bitter memory
at Durango High was a mental
error that cost him the state
championship his senior year.
"I was winning the race, and

when I crossed the line I slowed
up," Accetta recounted.
Despite his disheartening
second-place finish, Accetta
was heavily recruited by
schools across the country.
When he finally made it to the
Farm, he began to realize the
strength of the competition he
was up against.
"College is so different from
high school," he said. "I came
to Stanford as this highly
touted prospect, and I just got
killed in my first few races."
The adjustment period was dif
ficult for Accetta.
Accetta has now begun to
meet the expectations that
accompanied his arrival at
Stanford. Despite the contribu
tions he has made to the squad
this year, Accetta remains dis
satisfied with his performance
this year.
"I still don't feel that I've
run a really good race yet this
year," Accetta said. Hopefully,
that race will come in Satur
day's Pac-10 meet, which will
be held at the Stanford Golf
Course at 4 p.m.
In addition to providing
bragging rights in the Pac-10,
this meet will serve as a spring
board for the upcoming Dis
trict 8 Championships and, if
all goes well, for Nationals.
"I really think we're going to
do it," Accetta said of going to
the NCAAs.
It will take a top-three finish
at District-B'B to give Stanford
a ticket to Nashville for the
NCAAs. According to Accetta,
the regional championship rep
resents the culmination of
months of pounding the pave
ment.
"Five and a half months of
training, races, ups and downs
come down to a half hour on
the cross-country course,"
Accetta said. "It takes some
thing special to get to Nation
als."
Hopefully, Accetta will pro
vide that something special.
