# No. 2 Cardinal dives into preview of NCAAs
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
It may not be the real thing, but this
weekend's 49er Water Polo Tournament is
as close to the actual NCAA championships
as you can possibly get.
First of all, the tournament is being held
at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach.
The same Belmont Plaza where the
national championship will be decided in
about a month.
And then there are the teams. Top
ranked California will be there. No. 3
ranked UCLA will be there. And of course,
the newly named No. 2 team in the country,
Stanford, will be there.
In fact, the top six teams in the country
will be at this tournament. These teams,
plus two teams from the East Coast who
have guaranteed berths in the NCAAs will
likely once again gather at this pool Novem
ber 23-25 to decide once and for all who the
national champion is.
But first things first. Before the Stan-

ford water polo team can think about win
ning the national championship, the team
will try to win this weekend's tournament.
"If we can beat the other top teams here,
we'll really be in a great position going into
the national tournament," coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "We just beat UCLA, and
if we can do this again and beat Cal also,
then those teams might start thinking that
they can't beat us."
Senior Greg Olson, who is tied for the
team scoring lead with classmate Rick
McNair, also feels this tournament is a good
indication of just how good a team Stanford
is. "If we don't win this tournament, it's
not the end of the world," Olson said. "But
if we do win it, it'll show us exactly where
we stand in relation to the other teams and
will show us how good we really are."
After last week's great win against
UCLA, the Cardinal is clearly going into
this tournament full of confidence. As Det
tamanti said, "We have a lot of confidence
now, but we have to win here or else some of
that confidence might slip away."

Indeed, the tournament represents a
crucial time for Stanford in its quest to win
the national title. "We've worked so hard to
get to where we are right now in the rank
ings that we can't afford to slack off," Det
tamanti said. "We need to build on the
UCLA win and can't just stay put, because
there is a lot of the season left."
The first game for the Cardinal will be
against UC-Riverside, which is ranked 21st
in the country. This game is on Saturday
morning and doesn't figure to be much of a
contest, as the Stanford "B" team beat
Riverside in a game last weekend.
The team's first real test will likely be
No. 6 USC. Stanford has already convinc
ingly defeated the Trojans this year, but
Dettamanti is wary of this opponent. "USC
is always really tough in tournaments, so
you've got to watch out. They have good
and bad days, and if we catch them on a
good day, it'll be a struggle to get past
them."
Assuming the Cardinal does win this

game, the team's likely opponent in the
semi-final round will be none other than
UCLA. As anyone who watched last week's
game can tell you, this game will certainly
be a challenge and will require a great per
formance from everyone on the Stanford
squad.
Finally, if the Cardinal manages to con
quer the Bruins once again, the team's
opponent in the championship match will
probably be No. 1 Cal. The Golden Bears
have handed Stanford two of its three
losses in the year.
However, don't be surprised if Stanford
meets Pepperdine in the final. Boosted by
the return of the leading scorer on the Aus
tralian Olympic team, JefT Clark, who had
been ii\jured, the Waves have moved up to
No. 4 in the rankings and recently upset
Cal at Berkeley to ruin the Bears' unbeaten
record.
On Friday, before the tournament starts,
Stanford will visit San Diego to play No. 16
UC-San Diego.
