# Jack Elway returns to the Farm as a Greek
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
It's been a while since someone
has asked for tips about Stanford
football from Jack Elway. In fact,
it's the first time anyone has every
asked him to predict the outcome
of the Cardinal's contest.
"Stanford is hurting, it's com
ing off a tough loss. And Oregon
does have Musgrave ..." But the
father of all-time Stanford great
John Elway went for the upset
anyway.
But that's not the real ques
tion. What everybody is dying to
know is, does he still follow the
Cardinal?
As a matter of fact, yes.
"Yes, I still root for Stanford.
There are a lot of players on the
team I'm still fond of . . . it's a
complicated explanation emotion
ally," Elway said. Yes, quarter
back Jason Palumbis was his
recruit as was cornerback Kevin
Scott and national receiving lead
er Ed McCaffrey. In fact, the Glyn
Milburn was also one of "his," but
Milburn decided to take a detour
on his way to the Farm.
And for all you Jack Elway fans
out there, he's fine thank you.
Doing some scouting for the New
York Jets, and waiting to see how
the new international branch of
the NFL pans out.
Best of luck, Jack.
