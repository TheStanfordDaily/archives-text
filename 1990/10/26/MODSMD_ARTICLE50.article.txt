# Spelman president questions feminine leadership in '90s

### Alison M. Russell 
With warmth, a sense of humor and a
forceful voice, Spelman College President
Johnnetta Cole opened the Women World
Leaders Lecture Series at Kresge Audito
rium last night with the question, "Is there
a feminine leadership?"
The series is sponsored by Stanford's
Haas Center for Public Service and the
Global Fund for Women, a Menlo Park
based organization which supports projects
on women's human rights.
Cole said many of the changes taking
place in the workplace of the 1990s are a
result of the increasing number of women
in it. Still, in the near future white men will
continue to be "at the top of the corporate
ladder," she said.
Any studies of leadership will continue
to focus on "lives of the political elites, who
are almost to the man, men," she said.

Despite these limitations, Cole advo
cated "womanist" values based on women's
experiences as "a more productive and
more just way to make decisions."
For example, "widely and sincerely con
sulting with others in the workplace"
would mean "more quality when individu
als are treated as whole human beings, not
machines that are assigned quotas," she
said.
Women taking leadership roles will need
to "ask white men if they are capable of
adapting to new options based on our expe
riences," Cole added. Both men and women
will be called upon to be "terribly honest
about who we are, how we came to be that
way and how we'll be in the future."
In 1987, Cole became the first black
woman president of Spelman, a liberal arts
college for black women in Atlanta.
"Spelman produces black women lead
ers because students are surrounded by

black women leaders who mentor them to
become the same," Cole said. In the
absence of racism and sexism, "they are
affirmed as individuals and are convinced
they are women who can do absolutely any
thing," she added.
Stanford could gain "a touch of Spel
man" by encouraging women and by con
tinuing to change the curriculum to reflect
the student body's ethnic diversity, she
said.
Cole also suggested more mixing of stu
dents on an individual level. "Let me raise
a sensitive question â€” students could also
sit at the same table in the dining hall," she
said.
Before her appointment at Spelman,
Cole was an anthropology professor at
Hunter College in New York and taught
graduate courses at the City University of
New York, where she also directed the

Latin American and Caribbean Studies
Program.
Cole serves on several boards of direc
tors, including the Feminist Press and the
Global Fund for Women. She has received
numerous awards and honors and is a
founding director of President Bush's
Points of Light Foundation.
One of few college presidents to combine
her administrative duties with teaching,
Cole said in an interview before the speech
that she felt "guilt up to here" on the flight
to California. "I should have been in the
classroom team-teaching my introduction
to women's studies course," she said.
Cole received a standing ovation.
"Her words have certainly pushed me
forward. I felt like a great source of energy
went through me," said graduate student
Nicole Greenidge. "It will carry me through
the next four years."
