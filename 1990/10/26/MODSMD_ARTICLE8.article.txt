# Fest features freebies
## 
### Arthur Marcum 
White Plaza was turned into
a tent city of freebies, food and
fun this week with the arrival of
Campus Fest 1990.
The tent dwellers were more
than a dozen corporations and
several student groups who
gathered on campus Wednesday
and Thursday to reach out to
students and showcase their
products.
Held at Stanford for the first
time, the event was put on by
Market Source, a national event
marketing corporation, and was
co-sponsored by the Stanford
Bookstore and the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
Fraternal Affairs and Pro
gram Adviser Michael Ramsey-
Perez, who coordinates Student
Activities, said the event gave
various student groups "an
opportunity to strut their stuff
alongside the corporations
strutting their stuff."
Several big-name companies
were on hand to do the strut
ting, including CBS, IBM,
Newsweek and Orion Pictures.
And with the chance to win
some valuable prizes, the stu
dents came in flocks.
CBS gave students the oppor
tunity to try for a walk-on role
in its soap opera, "The Young
and the Restless," and Orion
showed previews of upcoming
movies.
But the word on most stu
dents' lips was "free."

The attitude of the day was
best summed up by freshman
Marney Rush, who said the
event was "fun and interesting,
plus there are a lot of free things
that I can use."
Milling around from booth to
booth, students picked up such
things as cologne, candy, crack
ers and pizza. Add to this the
three drawings to win a new
Isuzu car, and the lips began to
read "free car." Drawings were
also held for a mountain bike
and a trip to Hollywood.
Behind the scenes, organizers
called the event a success. Event
coordinator Maryanne Barber,
who works for the Bookstore,
said she was pleased with the
turnout and student participa
tion. "I think the event really
fosters goodwill between Stan
ford students and the commu
nity," Barber said. "Campus
Fest could become an annual
event."
Campus Fest has been held
every fall for the last three years
on 50 campuses nationwide.
Market Source approached the
Bookstore to co-sponsor the
event, and Barber said she
thought it would be a "nice
perk" to give the students.
According to event manager
and Market Source employee
Kevin Simme, Campus Fest "is
designed to create a festive
atmosphere on campus in which
students can sample and play
around with different prod
ucts."
