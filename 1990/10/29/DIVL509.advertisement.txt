These 30 Syrian citizens
were seized and imprisoned by their
government, and are probably
being tortured.
And they're the lu<ky ones.

They're lucky because Amnesty
International knows who they are—
and can work for their release or a
fair trial. Thousands of other inno
cent Syrians have disappeared into
jails, but their names and where
abouts are unknown.
Why are these people imprisoned
and abused by their government?
Because of their beliefs. Their
opinions. Because they requested
freedom from oppression. The
30 individuals above are laborers,
students, schoolteachers and
other ordinary citizens. Yet brutal
torture—without trial or even for
mal charges—is standard practice
in Syrian prisons.

time of new worldwide hope for human
rights, it's more important than ever
to tell Syria the world is watching.
