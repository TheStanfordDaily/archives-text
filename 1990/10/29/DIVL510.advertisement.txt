icons, Amiga combines a full color
display, full stereo sound, graphics,
3-1) animation, video capability
and text as no other computer can.
It has the power to run soft
ware sophisticated enough to
manipulate vast amounts of data,
as well as the creative genius to
create the complete score for an
orchestral composition.
We deliver today, what
others promise tomorrow.
Amiga was designed to keep up
with you, from school work de
mands through career needs.
You'll find standard what other
people make optional. As well as
sophisticated technology that
doesn't exist on comparably
powered and priced computers.

students, faculty and administra
tors, offers a wide range of fully
loaded, specially bundled hardware
