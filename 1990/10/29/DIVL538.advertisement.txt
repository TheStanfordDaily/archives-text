the Fords
Have Always
Driven
Volkswagens
Ask Kimo Ford why he bought a
Volkswagen and get ready for some
family history.
"Everyone in my family has driven a
Volkswagen at one time or another.
My dad had a Microbus. My mom and
sister both drove Beetles. And my
brother, who's also a student, drives
an '83 Volkswagen Rabbit.
"So when I saved enough money to
buy a car there was only one logical
choice. A Volkswagen, if you ask me,
it's the perfect student's car. Good on
gas. Big enough to carry four friends.
And fun to drive."
Fun to drive? Sounds like
Fahrvergnugen. To experience it for
yourself, just follow the Fords to your
Volkswagen dealer.
