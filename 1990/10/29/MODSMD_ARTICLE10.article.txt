Vatican needs celibate heroes
VATICAN CITY (AP) — Bishops who opposed changing the
requirement that priests be celibate ended a meeting yesterday
admitting it will not be easy to attract candidates with the needed
"heroism" for the priesthood.
Pope John Paul II had summoned the bishops from around the
world for a month-long synod on how to bring in good, committed
priests to a church that has suffered defections from the priest
hood and seen a drop in seminary enrollments in affluent parts of
the world.
"It is clear that many young people find it hard to commit
themselves to life-long priesthood, to give up the possibility of
marriage and setting up a family, and to choose a life in the spirit
of.. . poverty, chastity and obedience," the bishops said in a state
ment read during a final mass yesterday.
Klansmen march through D.C.
WASHINGTON (AP) — About 30 Ku Klux Klan members
marched through the nation's capital under tight security yester
day and rallied briefly at the U.S. Capitol.
At the Capitol, a Klan leader exhorted the robed and hooded
crowd to remove from office senators and representatives who
voted to override President Bush's veto of the 1990 Civil Rights
Act.
"Thank God it was kept out of law," the unidentified
Klansman said during the 30-minute rally.
S&L letters are missing
WASHINGTON (AP) — Dozens of letters are missing from the
special file of correspondence from members of Congress to sav
ings and loan regulators, according to the Office of Thrift
Supervision.
Most of the letters were written by lawmakers on behalf of con
stituents who complained about problems in their dealings with
S&Ls, such as accounts that were transferred from one thrift to
another as the result of mergers.
