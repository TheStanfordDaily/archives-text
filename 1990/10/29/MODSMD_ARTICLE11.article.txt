# Saddam's son-in-law to head Oil Ministry

### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Iraq
fired its oil minister yesterday and
canceled a fuel rationing program,
saying it was imposed by mistake,
an official report said. The minis
ter was replaced by Saddam
Hussein's son-in-law.
It was not immediately clear
why the rationing, which began
Tuesday, was stopped. The report
by the official Iraqi News Agency
said the Oil Ministry had miscal
culated the amount of chemical
additives necessary to refine crude
oil into gasoline and other prod
ucts such as lubricants.
"It was evident that [the chem
icals] were enough for double the
period estimated by the Oil
Ministry," the agency said. It said
the ministry of industry "was
capable of manufacturing the
needed solutions."
The report did not specify the
amount of the needed chemicals
Iraq had.
A well-placed oil industry
source said there was indeed an
imminent shortage of the chemi
cals, which had been imported
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
U.N. trade sanctions apparent
ly have severely curtailed imports
of the chemicals, but Iraq may
have taken whatever supplies

were in Kuwait when it invaded.
The source said Hussein may
have fired the official, Issam
Chalabi, to blame him for the
imminent shortage of chemicals.
The Iraqi agency said "a repub
lican decree" relieved Chalabi of
his post. It said another decree
appointed Hussein Kamel, minis
ter of industry and military indus
trialization, as acting oil minister.
Chalabi has been oil minister
since 1986. Before that he had a
long career as an oil administra
tor, including a stint as head of
Iraq's national oil company.
Kamel is a son-in-law of
Hussein. In addition to his minis
terial duties, he reportedly runs
one of the five secret police organi
zations through which Hussein
keeps a tight rein on Iraq.
The well-informed oil industry
source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that for more
than a year there have been signs
that Kamel has been attempting
to expand his authority into oil
production.
The source said despite the can
cellation of rationing, recent trav
elers from Iraq have said that the
shortage is "really biting" and
that Iraqis are asking why they
have such shortages when there is
still plenty of crude oil.
