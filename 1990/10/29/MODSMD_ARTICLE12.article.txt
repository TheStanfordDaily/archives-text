TOKYO (AP) - Nelson
Mandela told more than 20,000
Japanese at a rally yesterday that
he would seek financial help from
their government for his anti
apartheid movement.
The black leader, who is to

meet Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu today, addressed the crowd
at a complex in the western city of
Osaka on the second day of his
visit to Japan.
Later in the afternoon, he
spoke before 2,000 people at a

fund-raiser in Tokyo.
Mandela, 72, deputy president
of the African National Congress,
said he will ask leaders what kind
of support the congress can expect
from Japan in efforts to abolish
Pretoria's apartheid policy.
"We are here not only because
you are a very rich country with a
great deal of skill in economic
affairs. We are here because we
regard you as our friends and as
our allies," he said.

'We are here because
we regard you as our
friends and as our
allies.'

"We do expect the Japanese
government and Japanese busi
nesses to get involved in helping
develop our economy after
apartheid has been scrapped," he
said.
He also said he would ask the
government and Japanese busi
ness enterprises in Japan to pro
vide funds both for anti-apartheid
activities and to help build a new
South Africa.
Mandela arrived in Japan
Saturday after visiting India,
Indonesia and Australia. He is to
visit Malaysia and Brunei before
returning home, Kanbayashi said.
Japan has banned direct pri
vate investment in South Africa
since the 1960s and does not sta
tion an ambassador in Pretoria,
although it maintains diplomatic
relations with South Africa.
Japan also bans imports of
South African iron and steel and
limits cultural, sports and tourism
exchanges.
Mandela was freed in February
after more than 27 years in South
African prisons.
