# Moslem shrine causes Hindu unrest

### 
AYODHYA, India (AP) â€” Police arrested
thousands of Hindu pilgrims yesterday,
including a member of a Hindu royal family, in
an attempt to avoid more bloodshed in a dis
pute over a Moslem shrine in this town.
The Hindu-Moslem conflict over the shrine
claimed at least 96 lives in rioting last week
and has jeopardized the prime minister's gov
ernment.
More than 60,000 people were arrested by
Saturday as troops sealed off Ayodhya and the
borders of Uttar Pradesh state from a swarm
of Hindu pilgrims.
Police gave no figure for the number of
arrests yesterday, but Press Trust of India and
United News of India said 15,000 were
detained at one southern border crossing.
Among them was Vyaya Scindia, vice presi
dent of the right-wing Hindu party Bharatiya
Janata. She was the maharani, or princess, of
Gwalior before India abolished princely states
20 years ago.
Scindia was arrested on charges of "violat
ing a prohibitory order," United News report
ed. The state government had banned the lead
ers of several Hindu fundamentalist groups

from the state.
The news agencies said 300 truckloads of
Hindu pilgrims accompanying Scindia were
driven to temporary jails in schools and public
areas around the state. Twelve members of
Parliament also were detained by police form
ing a security net around the shrine.
"It's like a war zone. Not even an ant can
get past us," said one police officer protecting
the shrine.
The controversy is centered on a 16th cen
tury mosque, the Babri Masjid, in this town of
40,000 people about 300 mijes southeast of
New Delhi.
Hindu fundamentalists say the mosque
stands on the birthplace of the god Rama.
They say they will replace the structure with a
temple and have set Wednesday for beginning
construction.
The government, saying it is obliged to
defend minority interests, has pledged not to
allow the mosque to be displaced until the
courts decide the issue.
The Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew sup
port from Prime Minister V. P. Singh's
National Front coalition Tuesday. Singh's

minority government depended on the Hindu
party and the Communist-led Left Front for
its survival.
A United News report quoted Singh as say
ing yesterday that the Hindu party was trying
to "usurp power, even at the cost of communal
conflagration and the country's unity."
Singh must face a vote of confidence in
Parliament on Nov. 7. The Bharatiya Janata
and the opposition Congress party said they
will vote against Singh, thus virtually assuring
his defeat.
Elections are likely to be held early next
year.
"The (political) matter is closed. It is with
the security forces now, and they will do their
duty," said the police official at a barricade on
the road to Aydohya. Heavily armed policemen
manned the barrier.
Though Moslems are only 12 percent of
India's 880 million people, they live in almost
every Indian state. Hindus constitute 82 per
cent of the population.
Religious tensions between Hindus and
Moslems erupt periodically, and dozens of peo
ple are killed in clashes every year.
