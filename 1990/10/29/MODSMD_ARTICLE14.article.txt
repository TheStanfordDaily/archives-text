# Gulf troops fear losing public support

### 
EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA
(AP) — Lance Cpl. Juan Bacca,
hunkered down in the belly of a
U.S. Marine assault vehicle lurch
ing across the night desert, asked
about the demonstrations back
home against Operation Desert
Shield.
"It ticks me off," said Bacca,
20, of Lubbock, Texas. "This isn't
Vietnam. This is a totally different
situation."
Vietnam was long ago and far
away, but the conflict is much on
the minds of young soldiers in
Saudi Arabia.
Word of anti-war demonstra
tions back home has trickled back
to the troops here, who are the tip
of the military spear pointed at
Saddam Hussein's forces.
They are mindful of the hostile
reception that greeted Vietnam
veterans a generation ago when
they came home from an unpopu
lar war.
They fear a loss of public sup
port for the deployment of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf region
could bring similar anger down on
their heads.
"I'd feel betrayed if people
turned against us," said Cpl. John
Vaughn, 23, of Bravo Company of
the 3rd Marine Regiment, based
in Hawaii. Vaughn, from Detroit,
is nicknamed "Lifer" — the mili
tary slang for a career military
man.
Vietnam was America's longest
war, the only war America lost, a
war marked by campus riots and
draft card burnings, bitterness
and shame. The scars are still
apparent.
"I would hope people would put
it aside and learn from it, but not
judge every conflict by what hap
pened in Vietnam," said Bacca.
"We'd like it a whole lot better if
people were patting us on the
back."

Several soldiers approached
reporters to ask about support on
the home front for the troops in
the gulf.
Public backing for the deploy
ment was initially high, but there
has been increasing criticism of
President Bush's actions as the
high cost of the operation sinks in,
and people face up to the prospect
of a shooting war in the region.
Some of the soldiers in Saudi
Arabia have firsthand memories
of Vietnam — and painful ones.
John Bates, 44, of Little
Rock, Ark., an executive officer
for a Marine battalion, was
wounded in the conflict. He was
shot in the lung.
From his standpoint, the
American people misdirected their
anger at the fighting men in
Southeast Asia, instead of target
ing the politicians who sent them
there.
"The military doesn't make
policy. We only enforce it," said
Bates, in a mess tent set up in the
sand. "People were pointing the
finger in the wrong direction."
Vietnam memories are still
strong for Ist Sgt. Chuck
Woodruff, 38, of Oroville, Calif. He
was on the second-to-last heli
copter that left the roof of the U.S.
Embassy when Saigon fell on
April 30, 1975.
"The question keeps coming up
because there's nothing to com
pare this to except Vietnam. This
is the biggest military operation
since then," said Woodruff, who
has the Marine Corps emblem
tatooed on his left arm. "I think it
will take generations and decades
before people forget."
Support from home means a lot
to troops huffing, puffing and
sweating it out under a relentless
Saudi sun, 7,000 miles from the
KOCf PoQct
Staff Sgt. Charles Woods, 31, of

North Glenn, Colo., said the
troops could deal with the condi
tions, "as long as they know the
American people are behind
them."
Another Vietnam veteran is
Col. Jim Gass, 48, of Carney,
Okla., an artillery unit comman

der in the Army's Ist Cavalry
Division.
"No soldier wants to go some
where away from home and have
the country not support him,"
Gass said. "Today's soldiers want
to know their causes are just."

From his standpoint, the
American people misdirected their
anger at the fighting men in
Southeast Asia, instead of target
ing the politicians who sent them
there.
"The military doesn't make
policy. We only enforce it," said
Bates, in a mess tent set up in the
sand. "People were pointing the
finger in the wrong direction."
Vietnam memories are still
strong for Ist Sgt. Chuck
Woodruff, 38, of Oroville, Calif. He
was on the second-to-last heli
copter that left the roof of the U.S.
Embassy when Saigon fell on
April 30, 1975.
"The question keeps coming up
because there's nothing to com
pare this to except Vietnam. This
is the biggest military operation
since then," said Woodruff, who
has the Marine Corps emblem
tatooed on his left arm. "I think it
will take generations and decades
before people forget."
Support from home means a lot
to troops huffing, puffing and
sweating it out under a relentless
Saudi sun, 7,000 miles from the
KOCf PoQct
Staff Sgt. Charles Woods, 31, of

North Glenn, Colo., said the
troops could deal with the condi
tions, "as long as they know the
American people are behind
them."
Another Vietnam veteran is
Col. Jim Gass, 48, of Carney,
Okla., an artillery unit comman

der in the Army's Ist Cavalry
Division.
"No soldier wants to go some
where away from home and have
the country not support him,"
Gass said. "Today's soldiers want
to know their causes are just."
