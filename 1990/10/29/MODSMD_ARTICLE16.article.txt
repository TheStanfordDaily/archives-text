TBILISI, U.S.S.R. (AP) — Voters in Georgia
flocked to the polls yesterday for parliamentary elec
tions expected to pave the way for the southern
Soviet republic's independence.
About 35 parties, most of them grouped into coali
tions, were taking part in the contest, the first true
multiparty elections in Soviet history. At stake were
250 seats in the republic's Supreme Soviet legisla
ture.
Maguli Latariya cast her ballot dressed from head
to toe in black mourning clothes. Her 16-year-old
daughter was one of 19 Georgians killed on April 19,
1989, when Soviet troops used sharpened shovels to
break up a peaceful nationalist demonstration.
The incident fired strong sentiment for indepen

dence from Moscow. Even the ruling Communist
Party of Georgia was forced to adopt independence as
part of its political platform.
Latariya wept as she cast her ballot, saying it was
"as if my daughter's voice was telling me what to
do."
She said she voted for the Round Table for a Free
Georgia, the largest non-Communist bloc.
The head of the Round Table, Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, standing near Latariya, nodded
with approval as she spoke to reporters in School No.
50 in Tbilisi's Mtatsminda district.
Gamsakhurdia predicted that his coalition of
seven political parties would win up to 70 percent of
the legislative seats if the elections are fair.
