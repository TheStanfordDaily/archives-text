## Seek student opinion

THE UPCOMING Leadership
Summit sponsored by the
ASSU will hopefully help
student organizations define com
mon goals, establish communica
tion links and discover what their
counterparts are thinking.
But even if the event next week
end is wildly successful, it will still
leave a great number of students
all but left out of the decision-mak
ing process in our student govern
ment.
With five weeks of the academic
year already gone by, it's time for
the ASSU to conduct a new series
of dorm polls, using the dorm rep
resentative system devised two
years ago to bring information to
the ASSU leaders from the student
body.
Issues such as the revised alco
hol policy, the decision on domestic

partners and the proposed changes
to the distribution requirements
have until now gone almost com
pletely unaddressed by the ASSU.
Input from the student body as a
whole has also gone unsolicited.
The involvement in dorm polling
needs to be all-inclusive. The pro
cess should include Row houses,
graduate student dorms, family
residences and the Manzanita trail
ers.
The same energy that went into
plastering the entire campus with
campaign fliers last spring should
go into finding out what students
want this fall and this year.
The Council of Presidents made
a promise in its spring campaign to
be more representative of the
entire student body.
It's not too early to start asking
for some action.
