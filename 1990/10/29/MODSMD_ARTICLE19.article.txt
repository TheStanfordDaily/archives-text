# Hit the books now
## 
### 
After years and years
and years of talk, the
University Libraries system
has finally taken the first step in
actually installing a computerized
library checkout system.
This system will eliminate the
need for filling out a card for each
book checked out and will enable
students to see if books have been
checked out before searching for
them.
In addition to saving students
time and money, the system will aid
library staff in speeding up the pro
cess of filing and keeping track of
books checked out.
In all, the move to put the sys
tem on-line by next fall is an
admirable one. It proves that amid
budget cuts, not only can impor
tant programs be sustained, they

can be improved as well.
But promises are just promises.
University Libraries needs to
announce a concrete timeline for
its plans to install the system.
Once students know more about
the system's details and the time
line for its installation, they will
surely help implement the system
quickly and without undue inter
ference in normal library use.
Finally, the switch to a comput
erized library system again sug
gests the possibility of a universal
ID card that would serve as a stu
dent identification card, meal card
and library checkout card.
It's another improvement that's
been talked about for years and
years â€” and implementation is
now within reach.
