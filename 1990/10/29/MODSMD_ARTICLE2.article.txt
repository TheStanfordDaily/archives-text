# Sand Hill project clears roadblock
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
State officials removed another
obstacle to the controversial plans
to extend Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real last week by allow
ing Stanford to take part in the
project's planning committee.
As a result, local officials can
now resume discussing plans for
the project, which were delayed
last spring after local residents
challenged Stanford representa
tives' right to be on the commit
tee.
Following an eight-month
investigation, the California Fair
Political Practices Commission
ruled that the Sand Hill Road
extension's Joint Policy Commit
tee was "advisory and not subject
to the conflict of interest provi
sions of the Political Reform Act."
But in a move to prevent future
procedural roadblocks to complet
ing the extension, Stanford repre
sentatives will withdraw from for
mal committee involvement,
according to Stanford community
relations director Andy Doty
Even though Stanford's repre
sentatives will no longer be a for
med part of the the committee,
they plan to keep a watchful eye
on the Sand Hill Road develop
ments.
"We are not entirely out of the

picture. We plan on giving opin
ions on the issues," Doty said. "No
matter the degree, this is a group
project. The cities and Stanford
are all in this together."
The committee has had two
Stanford representatives and two
city council members each from
Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Together, the six-member com
mittee has worked since 1987 to
facilitate the development of the
extension of Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real.
But critics last spring halted
plans on the extension, charging
the University's delegates with
creating a conflict of interest as
the only private-sector represen
tatives on an otherwise public-sec
tor committee.
Under the provisions of the
state commission's ruling, Stan
ford may now freely confer with
other committee members.
"The decision says, in effect,
that the expansion process can go
on uninhibited by this type of
bureaucratic hurdle," Doty said.
"Most of the groundwork has
already been made for the exten
sion to go through anyway. We
just want to take whatever steps
we can to make sure the project is
bulletproof so there are no more
delays," Doty explained.
A consultant will be hired to
draft an environmental impact
report on road configurations.
Specifically, the report will con
sider four different alternatives:
no extension, a three-lane exten
sion to El Camino only allowing
left turns onto the street, an
extension cutting through Alma
Street and a four-lane extension
to El Camino.
The cost of the report,
$500,000, will be shared by Stan
ford, Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
For more than 30 years various
discussions and proposals to
extend Sand Hill Road have been
considered. But none of the plans
has been successfully imple
mented.
The tree-lined road stretches
from Interstate 280 through the
cities of Menlo Park and Palo Alto,
before ending in the parking lot of
the Stanford Shopping Center.
Currently any motorist want
ing to reach El Camino from Sand
Hill Road must cut through the
shopping center's parking lot or
turn onto Arboretum Road. This
has increased congestion on roads
near the shopping center; more
than 6,000 cars pass Macy's and
Neiman Marcus daily.
Some of the traffic could be
thinned by extending Sand Hill
Road through a parcel of Stanford
land nestled between the shop
ping center and the San Fran
cisquito Creek, Doty said.
University officials said if suc
cessful, the Sand Hill Road exten
sion could be a boon by unclogging
campus roads. But some area res
idents argued the whole idea is a
bust.
Some northern Palo Alto resi
dents have voiced concerns that a
road reconfiguration could chan
nel unwanted traffic into their

quiet residential neighborhoods.
Others expressed fear the Uni
versity would exercise carte
blanche in developing the pastoral
lands surrounding the proposed
extension route which would
bring additional travelers from
other parts of the Peninsula.
Despite these concerns, Palo
Alto resident Tony Badger, leader
of Neighbors Against the Sand
Hill Extension, said the recent
restructuring of the committee
did settle some of his worries.
"It is important that the Joint
Policy Committee form as impar
tial a structure as possible
because Stanford has a lot to gain
from the project. It is a step in the
right direction," he said.
Badger expressed his disap
proval with the $500,000 environ
mental impact assessment. As it
stands, if the city of Palo Alto does

not agree with the consultant's
recommendations, it still must
pay half of the cost of the report,
most of which will be passed on to
the taxpayers, he said.
"That biases the entire deci
sion-making process. If Stanford
wants to do this extension, it
should proceed without the
hook," Badger said. "Residents of
Menlo Park and Palo Alto will get
hurt most by the additional traffic
and we will still have to pay the
money.
He added that the only bad
aspect for Stanford would be hav
ing to pay half the cost of the
report. "Stanford's traffic can
only improve," he continued.
Palo Alto City Manager Bill
Zaner disagreed, saying the exten
sion process aims to incorporate
all parties affected by the pro
posed expansion.
