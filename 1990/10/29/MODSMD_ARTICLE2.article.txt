# Sand Hill project clears roadblock
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
State officials removed another
obstacle to the controversial plans
to extend Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real last week by allow
ing Stanford to take part in the
project's planning committee.
As a result, local officials can
now resume discussing plans for
the project, which were delayed
last spring after local residents
challenged Stanford representa
tives' right to be on the commit
tee.
Following an eight-month
investigation, the California Fair
Political Practices Commission
ruled that the Sand Hill Road
extension's Joint Policy Commit
tee was "advisory and not subject
to the conflict of interest provi
sions of the Political Reform Act."
But in a move to prevent future
procedural roadblocks to complet
ing the extension, Stanford repre
sentatives will withdraw from for
mal committee involvement,
according to Stanford community
relations director Andy Doty
Even though Stanford's repre
sentatives will no longer be a for
med part of the the committee,
they plan to keep a watchful eye
on the Sand Hill Road develop
ments.
"We are not entirely out of the

picture. We plan on giving opin
ions on the issues," Doty said. "No
matter the degree, this is a group
project. The cities and Stanford
are all in this together."
The committee has had two
Stanford representatives and two
city council members each from
Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Together, the six-member com
mittee has worked since 1987 to
facilitate the development of the
extension of Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real.
But critics last spring halted
plans on the extension, charging
the University's delegates with
creating a conflict of interest as
the only private-sector represen
tatives on an otherwise public-sec
tor committee.
Under the provisions of the
state commission's ruling, Stan
ford may now freely confer with
other committee members.
"The decision says, in effect,
that the expansion process can go
on uninhibited by this type of
bureaucratic hurdle," Doty said.
"Most of the groundwork has
already been made for the exten
sion to go through anyway. We
just want to take whatever steps
we can to make sure the project is
bulletproof so there are no more
delays," Doty explained.
