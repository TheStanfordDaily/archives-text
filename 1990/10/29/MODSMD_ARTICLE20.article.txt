Theme house story was biased against Ujamaa

AFTER READING LAST Monday's
conclusion of a five-part series on
ethnic theme houses in The Daily,
I could no longer stomach the slight of
hand, off-color (if you will excuse the
pun), cowardly, yet indirect remarks
being made about Ujamaa.
I find it very interesting that the
writer of this story found all her sources
who did not have pleasant experiences in
theme houses to be former residents of
Ujamaa.
Furthermore, I did not appreciate the
insinuation that the Ujamaa staff does
not offer a wide variety of programming
like Casa Zapata and Okada House or
make an effort to reach out to non-black
members of the house in an effort to wel
„ come them. Is this an example of non
» biased reporting that The Daily stakes
' its reputation on? I think not!
As a former Ujamaa resident assistant

(1989-90), I want to set the record
straight, especially since one of the
sources used for this article was a frosh
in Ujamaa at the time I was an RA and
has spoken so strongly about how he did
not feel comfortable in Ujamaa, nor did
many of the non-black residents.
Last year during fall quarter, I
designed a special program for all non
black residents of Ujamaa to come voice
their concerns, ask questions and give
them the opportunity to let RAs know
how we could better serve them.
A number of measures were adopted
to ensure privacy and to make sure no
one would feel intimidated. Fliers
describing the program were only given
to non-black residents and were not
posted; the location for this meeting was
the Ujamaa library. Only two staff mem
bers were present at this meeting to also
ensure the comfort of the residents in

discussing these things.
However, after all this forethought
and care, guess what? Only two resi
dents, came, the previously stated source
not being one of them.
The two residents who came were
freshmen. They expressed no concern,
although one did say she was apprehen
sive at first because it was a new envi
ronment for her and she did not want to
live in a theme house her freshman year.
Nevertheless, she did say that she now
felt comfortable.
After the meeting, RAs asked non
black residents on their hall why they
were not at the meeting and if they had
any concerns that they wanted
addressed.
Guess what? I was told the non-black
residents were happy and felt comfort
able in the house.
Please tell me what more could we do

to get input from non-black residents? At
that point, the responsibility was on
those who felt uncomfortable to express
how they felt.
I find it interesting that after all this
time, a source who had the benefit of
such programming would come back and
accuse the staff of not making the house
welcome.
In closing, I would like to say to The
Daily that if you really feel Ujamaa is
doing an inferior job as a theme house
compared to all the other theme houses
on campus, have the courage to say so
directly, rather than insulting the read
ers' intelligence by making nasty insinu
ations and creating an air of competition
as you did with this article.
Using a larger variety of sources
would be a great start.

AFTER ONE YEAR AT Stanford, I
thought that nothing could shock
me anymore. I was a bit premature
in my assertion, however, for the infa
mous "shower scene" in the Oct. 18
Daily shocked me to my shoes.
I may be considered antediluvian, but
the picture of those males and females
showering together was not only shock
ing but disturbing.
I was disturbed by the fact that this
sort of thing actually existed at Stanford,
and I was shocked by the fact that The
Daily actually printed it.
If I want to get a gander at people au
naturel, I'll purchase the appropriate
magazine. The Daily does not fall under
the same category as Playboy or
Penthouse magazines, therefore its read
ers should not be subjected to the same
offensive material.

We are slowly becoming desensitized
to what was normally regarded as moral
and ethical. Thirty years ago, Stanford
had separate residences for men and
women. Today, they are showering
together.
Ten years from now, I would be
scarcely surprised if incoming freshmen
would have the option of rooming with
someone of the opposite sex.
I've no doubt that I will be lambasted
for my conservative views. Hark! I can
hear the masses now. Freedom of the
press! Freedom of speech! Get with the
program, girl! It's the 00's! Just do it!
Slowly but surely, our morals and
ethics are degenerating, and consequent
ly, the boding of our future is not very
optimistic.

Please tell me what more could we do

to get input from non-black residents? At
that point, the responsibility was on
those who felt uncomfortable to express
how they felt.
I find it interesting that after all this
time, a source who had the benefit of
such programming would come back and
accuse the staff of not making the house
welcome.
In closing, I would like to say to The
Daily that if you really feel Ujamaa is
doing an inferior job as a theme house
compared to all the other theme houses
on campus, have the courage to say so
directly, rather than insulting the read
ers' intelligence by making nasty insinu
ations and creating an air of competition
as you did with this article.
Using a larger variety of sources
would be a great start.

AFTER ONE YEAR AT Stanford, I
thought that nothing could shock
me anymore. I was a bit premature
in my assertion, however, for the infa
mous "shower scene" in the Oct. 18
Daily shocked me to my shoes.
I may be considered antediluvian, but
the picture of those males and females
showering together was not only shock
ing but disturbing.
I was disturbed by the fact that this
sort of thing actually existed at Stanford,
and I was shocked by the fact that The
Daily actually printed it.
If I want to get a gander at people au
naturel, I'll purchase the appropriate
magazine. The Daily does not fall under
the same category as Playboy or
Penthouse magazines, therefore its read
ers should not be subjected to the same
offensive material.

We are slowly becoming desensitized
to what was normally regarded as moral
and ethical. Thirty years ago, Stanford
had separate residences for men and
women. Today, they are showering
together.
Ten years from now, I would be
scarcely surprised if incoming freshmen
would have the option of rooming with
someone of the opposite sex.
I've no doubt that I will be lambasted
for my conservative views. Hark! I can
hear the masses now. Freedom of the
press! Freedom of speech! Get with the
program, girl! It's the 00's! Just do it!
Slowly but surely, our morals and
ethics are degenerating, and consequent
ly, the boding of our future is not very
optimistic.

Theme house story was biased against Ujamaa

AFTER READING LAST Monday's
conclusion of a five-part series on
ethnic theme houses in The Daily,
I could no longer stomach the slight of
hand, off-color (if you will excuse the
pun), cowardly, yet indirect remarks
being made about Ujamaa.
I find it very interesting that the
writer of this story found all her sources
who did not have pleasant experiences in
theme houses to be former residents of
Ujamaa.
Furthermore, I did not appreciate the
insinuation that the Ujamaa staff does
not offer a wide variety of programming
like Casa Zapata and Okada House or
make an effort to reach out to non-black
members of the house in an effort to wel
„ come them. Is this an example of non
» biased reporting that The Daily stakes
' its reputation on? I think not!
As a former Ujamaa resident assistant

(1989-90), I want to set the record
straight, especially since one of the
sources used for this article was a frosh
in Ujamaa at the time I was an RA and
has spoken so strongly about how he did
not feel comfortable in Ujamaa, nor did
many of the non-black residents.
Last year during fall quarter, I
designed a special program for all non
black residents of Ujamaa to come voice
their concerns, ask questions and give
them the opportunity to let RAs know
how we could better serve them.
A number of measures were adopted
to ensure privacy and to make sure no
one would feel intimidated. Fliers
describing the program were only given
to non-black residents and were not
posted; the location for this meeting was
the Ujamaa library. Only two staff mem
bers were present at this meeting to also
ensure the comfort of the residents in

discussing these things.
However, after all this forethought
and care, guess what? Only two resi
dents, came, the previously stated source
not being one of them.
The two residents who came were
freshmen. They expressed no concern,
although one did say she was apprehen
sive at first because it was a new envi
ronment for her and she did not want to
live in a theme house her freshman year.
Nevertheless, she did say that she now
felt comfortable.
After the meeting, RAs asked non
black residents on their hall why they
were not at the meeting and if they had
any concerns that they wanted
addressed.
Guess what? I was told the non-black
residents were happy and felt comfort
able in the house.
Please tell me what more could we do

to get input from non-black residents? At
that point, the responsibility was on
those who felt uncomfortable to express
how they felt.
I find it interesting that after all this
time, a source who had the benefit of
such programming would come back and
accuse the staff of not making the house
welcome.
In closing, I would like to say to The
Daily that if you really feel Ujamaa is
doing an inferior job as a theme house
compared to all the other theme houses
on campus, have the courage to say so
directly, rather than insulting the read
ers' intelligence by making nasty insinu
ations and creating an air of competition
