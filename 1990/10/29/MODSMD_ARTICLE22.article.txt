## Perpetuating stereotypes 
### 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN vehemently
opposed to the stereotypical idea of
the helpless, mechanically inept
female who needs a man around to fix
things for her.
I suppose that's why it was so disturb
ing when I found myself playing the part
yesterday afternoon.
In a false state of resourcefulness, I
offered to reassemble my friend's bicycle
that had just arrived from New York. All I
had to do was attach the handlebars,
front wheel, seat and pedals — nothing
really complicated, largely a matter of
just tightening a bolt here and a screw
there.
I was struggling with the bike, trying
to fit the stem into the head tube, when a
male mechanical engineering major and
resident bicycle expert from down the hall
happened by.
He offered to help, and since my friend
wasn't particularly anxious to wait an
indefinite amount of time for me to figure
out the problem of the handlebars — and
I would have figured it out eventually, I
might add — I handed over the tools for
the sake of expediency.
Although I knew that this future engi
neer possessed a vast knowledge of bicy
cles, I still couldn't help feeling a twinge
of resentment.
I felt like one of those women on TV
commercials and cartoons where the car
breaks down and instead of either at least
attempting to fix the car or walking to the
nearest gas station, the woman lifts up
her skirt, swings her leg out over the road
and entices some guy now enamored of
her to pull over and rescue her.

The situation with the bicycle wasn't
exactly the same, since the rescuer wasn't
patronizing or mocking or demeaning,
but genuinely helpful.
The fact that my dormmate was more
qualified to fix the bicycle by virtue of his
experience and knowledge rather than his
maleness is largely irrelevant.
The truth of the matter was that I
could not put the bike together properly,
efficiently and quickly, and I could see no
reason for that other than prior laziness
and apathy on my part.
I'm annoyed at myself for not having
paid more attention and for not taking
more of an interest when my brother
worked on his bike or when my dad made
any repairs.
Even more disturbing is that I don't
usually approach situations involving the
use of tools or having any mechanical
aspects with the same sort of confidence
that I've noticed a lot of males exude.
My brother is two years younger than I
am, and as far as I can tell, he is not any
more knowledgeable about or inclined
toward mechanical things than I am.
Yet he always looks like he knows what
he's doing when he's fixing or assembling
something. I, on the other hand, have
more of a tendency to second-guess
myself and wonder if I'm doing it right.
I probably could have picked up a few
pointers about using tools and fixing
things. Then I wouldn't have needed any
one to come along and help me pick up the
pieces.
I refuse to believe that there is some
inherent gender difference that makes
men more mechanically inclined than

women. It seems to me that unless I can
prove through my everyday actions that I,
a female, am capable of taking care of my
own problems without a man's help, I will
only be perpetuating the stereotype.
It disturbs me to no end that, for all
my feminist ideals and criticism of the
portrayal of women on television, in the
movies and in cartoons, I find myself
exhibiting some of the qualities of the
stereotypical woman.
For example, I still cannot reconcile
my squeamishness when it comes to bugs
and rodents. I cringe every time I have to
dispose of one.
It always reminds me of the hysterical
woman in the Tom and Jerry cartoons
who stands on top of a chair swatting
frantically at a mouse with a broom until
her husband, or cat, comes and either
kills it or scares it out of the kitchen.
I will no longer let myself fit into mold
of the helpless, delicate woman who needs
a man around to take care of her, protect
her and sometimes rescue her.
I'll just have to learn to be more self
reliant, and not just about mechanical
things — although I'm seriously consid
ering enrolling myself in some sort of
auto-shop class.

worked on his bike or when my dad made
any repairs.
Even more disturbing is that I don't
usually approach situations involving the
use of tools or having any mechanical
aspects with the same sort of confidence
that I've noticed a lot of males exude.
My brother is two years younger than I
am, and as far as I can tell, he is not any
more knowledgeable about or inclined
toward mechanical things than I am.
Yet he always looks like he knows what
he's doing when he's fixing or assembling
something. I, on the other hand, have
more of a tendency to second-guess
myself and wonder if I'm doing it right.
I probably could have picked up a few
pointers about using tools and fixing
things. Then I wouldn't have needed any
one to come along and help me pick up the
pieces.
I refuse to believe that there is some
inherent gender difference that makes
men more mechanically inclined than

women. It seems to me that unless I can
prove through my everyday actions that I,
a female, am capable of taking care of my
own problems without a man's help, I will
only be perpetuating the stereotype.
It disturbs me to no end that, for all
my feminist ideals and criticism of the
portrayal of women on television, in the
movies and in cartoons, I find myself
exhibiting some of the qualities of the
stereotypical woman.
For example, I still cannot reconcile
my squeamishness when it comes to bugs
and rodents. I cringe every time I have to
dispose of one.
It always reminds me of the hysterical
woman in the Tom and Jerry cartoons
who stands on top of a chair swatting
frantically at a mouse with a broom until
her husband, or cat, comes and either
kills it or scares it out of the kitchen.
I will no longer let myself fit into mold
of the helpless, delicate woman who needs
a man around to take care of her, protect
her and sometimes rescue her.
I'll just have to learn to be more self
reliant, and not just about mechanical
things — although I'm seriously consid
ering enrolling myself in some sort of
auto-shop class.
