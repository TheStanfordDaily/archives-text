## Elizabeth Howton Daily's coverage of coming out deserves credit 
### 
I AGREE WITH SOME OF the criti
cisms raised in the Wednesday letter
about the Oct. 11 Coming Out Day
story in The Daily and have respect for
those of the authors I know personally,
but I want to offer another viewpoint.
What the authors fail to see (and what
the article failed to make sufficiently
clear) is that the entire focus of the story,
as it was conceived and executed, was on
people taking their first steps out of the
closet.
It was not intended to be the definitive
word on all people in all stages of coming
out, which, as the article pointed out, is a
lifelong, never-ending process.
The reporter felt that most gay, lesbian
and bisexual people seen and quoted in
the mainstream media (including The
Daily) are necessarily very "out" and
therefore not representative of the whole
range of queer experience.
(I am using "queer" not as a derogative
but as a reclaimed, inclusive term that
encompasses all non-straight people, and
I believe the authors of the Oct. 24 letter
meant it in this way also.)
Through the story, the writer meant
not to reinforce the idea of homophobia as
an inexorable force, but rather to cele
brate the courage of people taking their
first tentative actions toward breaking
free of homophobia.
There were, in fact, four gays and les
bians quoted by their full names in the
story, so clearly the issue was not that

"The Daily didn't find a single out stu
dent."
However, it is unfair to stigmatize the
three people profiled because they chose
not to use their full names. The article
made it clear that all of them — two of
whom are freshmen — are taking steps to
come out.
One is even out to her entire all-fresh

man dorm (no easy feat, I can assure you,
speaking as one who's been in a similar
situation) and only withheld her name
because she has not yet told her parents.
The assumption that people are less
worthy of media attention because they
are not as "out" as the letter's authors
strikes me as arrogant and lacking in
compassion.

Have all of the letter's signers, from
the day they realized they were queer,
been so perfectly and completely "out"?
Did they experience no trauma, no pain in
their journey to where they are now? The
mtyority of the signers are graduate stu
dents; perhaps it was long enough ago
that they have forgotten how hard it can
be for some people to make that journey,
or perhaps they were lucky enough to
come from a place (physically, emotionally
or spiritually) that made it easier for
them.
In addition, as a Daily staff member
and an "out queer" myself, I believe this
representation of The Daily as a mono
lithic heterosexual institution ignores the
efforts of people like myself and the arti
cle's author who are endeavoring to
include bisexual, gay and lesbian people
(as well as others historically silenced and
disempowered) on The Daily's pages.
It also perpetuates the myth of The
Daily as a place where gay, lesbian and
bisexual staffers are unwelcome.
While it is important for the
bisexual/lesbian/gay community to keep a
critical eye on The Daily, and I am glad
the letter ran, it is also important to give
credit where it is due.
Surely the fact that more than 50 col
umn-inches (a very large amount by The
Daily's norms) were devoted to a positive

discussion of coming out deserves some
recognition, as does The Daily's promi
nent and, I think, excellent coverage of
the domestic partnership victory the
same week.
The gay/bisexual/lesbian community
— like several others — is targeted for
recruitment and outreach efforts by The
Daily's staff development department. I
encourage interested community mem
bers to contact me or Assoc. Director of
Staff Development Quan Phung about
further concerns or about joining The
Daily's staff.

Elizabeth Howton, a fifth-year senior in
American studies and feminist studies, is
a director of staff development for The
Daily. She has been active in the Stan
ford lesbian/bisexual I gay community for
more than three years.
