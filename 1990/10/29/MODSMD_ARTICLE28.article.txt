## Stanford sputters against Oregon in 31-0 setback 
### Debbie Spander Senior sports writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — Stanford
has two options.
With another debacle behind it,
the Cardinal can either succumb
to its poor play and inconsistency,
or finish off the season on a posi
tive note.
After beating Notre Dame, but
failing to show competence the
past two weeks, either is definitely
possible.
"There are two ways this team
can go — we can pack it in or we
can come back and play well," said
offensive lineman Chuck Gilling
ham. "We have three games left
and we have to come back and
play Washington State next
week."
"I don't think this team will
fold."
"Regardless of how we've

played we still have a hell of a
team. We have a lot of talent and
we should be winning a hell of a
lot more games than we're win
ning. Our expectatations should
still be high," Running back
Tommy Vardell added
For the third week in a row the
talented squad was apparent only
in potential.
Stanford folded against USC. It
had a bad week of practice before
Washington. The Cardinal is still
searching for explanations to
describe its latest day of under
production.
"Every time we lose we become
more disappointed, more discour
aged. We haven't played good foot
ball since the first quarter of USC
— on either side of the ball," said
coach Denny Green. "It's hard to
say why, but we allowed things to
happen."
And didn't make anything hap

pen on its side of the line of scrim
mage.
In its final chance to pull off a
winning season, the Cardinal put
up its undeniably worst offensive
production of the year, allowing
Oregon to record its seventh vic
tory. Stanford fell to 2-6, 1-4 in
conference play.
The Ducks are headed for a
bowl game. Stanford should be
headed for the shrink.
After defeating Notre Dame
three weeks ago, the squad has
been outscored 120 to 38. Some
thing is missing. Something is
wrong.
"I'm not sure how to change,"
said Vardell. "Some adjustments
can be made. I'm sure the coaches
will come up with something, but
as a player ... I don't know."
What is known, however, is
that Stanford had no offense Sat

tion or bad play calling, the Cardi
nal rarely put together a drive,
and never made it inside Oregon's
20.

It's only offensive threat was
John Hopkins' 51-yard field goal
attempt in the second quarter.
Wide right, of course.
Despite an offense loaded with
talent, any sort of threat missed
the plane to Eugene. Stanford
failed to convert a single first
down for its first five drives.
Punter Paul Stonehouse was on
the field longer than the entire
offensive squad during the first
quarter.
"You can't take anything away

from them, but we just didn't exe
cute," said backup quarterback
John Lynch. "We would have a
roll but it seemed like it just sput
tered. We put ourselves in bad sit
uations. You can't be playing
third-and-12 all day."
But Stanford was. When the
offense finally discovered what 10
yards was halfway through the
second quarter, it would get to sec
ond-and-five, second-and-six,
then run into a wall. Starting
quarterback Jason Palumbis or
Lynch would be sacked or hurried,
or the ball carrier would be
dragged for a loss. Stanford did no
better on third down, as its 5-of
-19 third down conversion ratio
attests.
Stanford's goal was to get its
running game going for the first
time in three weeks. It failed.
While it did actually gain 118
yards on the ground, runners
were ineffective when really
needed and holes were not there.
Outstanding running back Glyn
Milburn was held to 17 yards on
six carries. The most successful
ground gainer was Lynch, who
gained 37 yards while running for
his life.
The production, or lack
thereof, is even more incompre
hensible because this was sup
posed to be Palumbis' big day. The
Lake Oswego, Ore. native was
making his first start in his home
state since high school. The home
coming quickly became a night
mare. The quarterback had his
worst game of the season, com
pleting only 16 of 26 passes for a
paltry 104 yards, and throwing
two interceptions. In front of a
crowd of family and friends, the
junior was benched halfway
through the third quarter in favor
of backup Lynch. Lynch didn't do
too much better, tossing in a 5-for
-14-and-one-interception perfor
mance to Stanford's cause.
The killer came in the closing
minutes of the first half. Stanford
was down 14-0, but had put
together its first sustained drive
of the day, and was heading for an
apparent score. Fourteen to seven,
or even 14-3 at halftime wouldn't
have been unconquerable, and
Stanford would have had momen
tum heading into the third period.
On third-and-six from the Ore
gon 35, Palumbis went for wide
receiver Jon Pinckney on the right
sideline, for the third time in four
plays. A split-second before the
first-down completion, corner
back Devon Hosey stepped in for
the interception, and cruised for a
75-yard touchdown.
Oregon 21, Stanford 0.

"The interception return was
key," Lynch said. "If we could put
some points on the board we're
right back in the game. I think we
came out pumped out in the sec
ond half but a couple more breaks
went their way and that killed us
right there."
It didn't take breaks, or even a
spectacular performance, for Ore
gon to amass 31 points. With all
the talk of all-conference quarter
back Bill Musgrave and the
Duck's bullet threat, Oregon was
not overly impressive through the
air — and Stanford did a good job
of keeping it in check. Other than
a beautiful (and wide-open) 33-
yard pass to Ngalu Kelemeni in
the first quarter and a few other
key tosses, Musgrave was not all
that stellar.
The Stanford secondary was
actually a key factor in his subpar
performance. After weeks of get
ting burned for touchdowns and
long plays, the Cardinal's defen
sive backs, for the most part, did a
good job of covering receivers.
Free safety Seyon Albert picked
off a Musgrave pass in the open
ing minutes of the second quarter
— the first interception since the
Oregon State contest, and the sec
ondary's first pick off a competent
offense since the second quater of
its season-opener against Col
orado. Five other passes were bro
ken up.
In fact, the entire Cardinal
defense put in an admirable per
formance. Runners were stopped
for no gain — or losses. Oregon
was held on its fourth-and-two
first-down try. The Ducks were
held to l-of-12 in third down con
versions.
But two mistakes cost 14
points.
An out-of-position player on a
blitz resulted in a Sean Burwell
75-yard touchdown romp, and
there was no one within 10 yards
of Kelemeni on his TD reception.
"As a defense we gave up some
big plays, but on the whole we
played hard-nosed defense," said
linebacker Ron George. "We con
trolled the running and passing
game, but a few mistakes made
some big plays hurt us. One
missed assignment resulted in
some big plays."
Fortunately; it didn't matter.
Even if the defense had upheld its
goal to shut down the Ducks dur
ing the second half, the offense
gave it no support, and came
nowhere close to narrowing the
21-point gap. Instead, it posted
Stanford's first shutout of the

season, and worst since a 49-0
romp by UCLA in 1987.
"We're discouraged. We know
we're not this bad of a team — to
be blown out two weeks in a row,"
added Albert. "We just want to
play to our potential."
For the offense, and defense,
the best suggestion is to put their
mistakes behind and forge ahead.
Now it's wait and see.
Card notes
Stanford actually amassed 298
yards, as hard as that is to believe.
Other than a field goal block, spe
cial teams were very disappoining, giv
ing up a 60-yard punt return and only
amassing 12 yards on four punt
returns.
Linebacker Jono Tunney ended
his streak at 31 consecutive starts

while sitting out for low back pain.
But he was pressed into service when
Tom Williams went down, and ended
up recording the team high of nine
tackles. Cornerback Darrien Gor
don had six tackles and three pass
break-ups, and safety/rover Jimmy
Klein recorded seven tackles and one
deflection. Cornerback Kevin Scott
had a blocked field goal to go along
with his five tackles.
Milburn often lined up as a
receiver and had six receptions for 52
yards. Potent receiver Ed McCaffrey
was seldom thrown to — though often
open — and caught only five passes for
82 yards. He also dropped a TD pass.
The Compadres Players of the
Game were linebacker Vince
Otoupal and Albert.
The band, once again, was a dis
grace to Stanford, failing to support
the team during the game, making fun
of Oregon's sentimentally sensitive
spotted owl and getting booed off the
field at halftime.
