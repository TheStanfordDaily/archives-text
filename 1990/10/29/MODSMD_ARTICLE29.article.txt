# Volleyball handles Arizona State, Arizona with ease
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
"Ugly."
That's the one word that Arizona
State coach Patty Snyder mumbled as
she passed the sideline during intermis
sion of Friday night's volleyball match.
Presumably she was referring to the
manner in which her Sun Devils had
just managed to wheedle game three
away from Stanford.
But the Cardinal (16-3, 11-2 in
Pacific 10 Conference play) itself looked
far from picturesque while downing
ASU 15-7, 15-11, 14-16, 15-7. Intent to
make amends, Stanford rebounded Sat
urday at Burnham Pavilion, pounding
Arizona 15-3, 15-4, 15-9.
Against the Sun Devils, Stanford
looked all night like it would need one
serious jump start. "We were due for one
of these," Shaw said. "We had been play
ing real well. But tonight, we just strug
gled. I'm glad it's over with."
In the contest, Stanford recorded a
season-low hitting percentage of .196.
Neither sophomore Bev Oden nor co
captain Kristin Klein hit over .300, a
true volleyball rarity.
The Sun Devils outblocked Stanford
12-9 and actually recorded one fewer
attack error on the night. Considering
that ASU entered the match with only
eight players on their roster, their effort
against the mighty Cardinal was no
sm&ll fpflt
"We still have faith in our eight play
ers (who are healthy)," Sun Devil hitter
Mindy Gowell said. "We believed we
could win. Our attitude's been really
good."
\SU put that rejuvenated spirit to
work, jumping to a 3-0 game-one lead.
Klein contributed three consecutive
kills to get the Cardinal out of the start
ing blocks but the Sun Devils continued
to execute.
"We got off to a bad start," setter Car
rie Feldman said. "We were too relaxed.
We have no excuses."
Even so, hitting the panic button
would have been a little premature.
ASU had a 13-11 record and had lost six
players to season-ending injuries
throughout the year.
The Cardinal accordingly settled
down and shifted into cruise control.
After tying the game score at 7-7, Stan
ford outscored the Sun Devils 8-0 to

close out the game. Oden had a kill, a
solo block and a spectacular diving dig
during the run. Senior co-captain Jes
sica Benton impressed with a powerful
offensive display. She had two kills dur
ing the eight-point streak. Benton fin
ished the match with 10 kills, three
blocks and a .389 hitting percentage.
While Stanford appeared to be easing
into a rhythm, the Sun Devils continued
to fight. Three consecutive Cardinal hit
ting errors pushed ASU ahead 4-3 in the
second game.
Stanford recovered again, however
jumping ahead at 5-4. The teams traded
points until a Klein sideout kill at 14-11.
The junior delivered an ace to finish the
game.
Gowell and her teammates again
refused to concede. Instead they stuck
their heads down indignantly and
charged ahead in game three. ASU led 3-
1 before Stanford came back to tie the
score. Klein, who battled a cold all week
end, slammed three hard kills and
served two aces to give the Cardinal a
commanding 13-8 advantage.
But eight players with a lot of heart
proved to be troublesome. The Sun Dev
ils called time out, and then picked apart
the Stanford lead. ASU tied the score at
13 and 14 before jumping ahead to take
the game.
"It wasn't a sterling performance,"
Cardinal senior Cheryl Conly said. "We
didn't play together as a team."
While some of Stanford's big guns
had been silenced, junior Amy Cooper

was silently hitting .429. She smashed a
quick attack at 4-4 of the fourth game
and capped a five point run with an ace
at 8-4. The 5-foot-7 Piper Hahn got
involved in the offense with a kill at 10-
4 and a jump serve ace at 11-5. After six
failed match-point opportunities, Stan
ford sealed the game.
"The team as a whole wasn't very
good tonight," Shaw said. "But it's still
a win."
One win like that was enough. Stan
ford had no intention of stumbling over
another victory like that. Saturday
night, the team pummeled high-minded
Arizona. The Cardinal played more like
the No. 5 team in the country, hitting
.310 on the night and outblocking the
Wildcats 11-2. Four Stanford starters
hit over .300 for the match.
"Tonight was much more of a team
effort," Shaw said. "I think last night
helped us because it got us fired up."
Co-captains Klein and Benton
worked together to rock another Ari
zona school. Benton once again tied her
career-high of 10 kills and added a .400
hitting percentage to earn her own
coach's "Player-of-the-Weekend" award.
Klein recorded a match-high 11 kills
while hitting .333.
Klein and Benton went to work
immediately with early kills in the first
game. Stanford streaked to a 6-1 advan
tage forcing Wildcat coach Rosie
Wegrich to call timeout.
Her remarks proved minimally effec
tive as Stanford continued to control the
ball. The team made only three recep
tion errors on the night enabling Feld
man the full range of offensive options.
Outside hitter Jennifer Jackson con
tributed six first-game kills, sealing the
outcome.
Throughout the match, Aijzona suf
fered from erratic passing. The Wildcats
put several returns of serve over the net,
allowing Oden and Benton to tee off.
"That's the worst we've played this
year," Wegrich said. "We couldn't run an
offense tonight. This certainly is not any
representation of how well we can play."
The Wildcats had three hitters, includ
ing their best attacker, Terry Lauchner,
hit negatively during the affair.
Oden meanwhile menaced Arizona
defensively. She roofed six attacks and
dug nine balls throughout the match.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
Sophomore setter Carrie Feldmen runs the offense, helping the Cardinal best both
Arizona State and Arizona In Burnham Pavilion this weekend. Stanford has now won
seven consecutive matches at home and has dropped only one game over that span.
Both totals were match highs.
Cooper joined in on the melee
crushing six kills in can't-touch
this fashion. She hit one ball so
hard that it bounced directly into
the stands after landing in. The
All-Pac-10 middle blocker fin
ished with a .333 hitting percent
age and three blocks.
The evening was decided by
the middle of the second game.
Cooper and Feldman connected
on kills as Stanford scurried to a
9-3 advantage. After seizing the
game, the Cardinal went on a dev
astating 9-0 run during the final
set. Shaw felt he had seen
enough, giving both Klein and
Benton breathers near the end of

the contest.
"Sometimes Stanford doesn't
take us seriously," Wegrich said.
"But tonight is the best they've
played against us in two years."
With the weekend sweep, the
Cardinal essentially sealed mat
ters in the conference. UCLA,
which remains undefeated in Pac
-10 play, will likely claim the cham
pionship and host the NCAA
regionals in December. The Cardi
nal should finish second.
The team's next opponent is
No. 2 University of the Pacific
Tuesday. The Tigers handed
Stanford its worst defeat of the
season at Maples Pavilion Sept.

Sophomore setter Carrie Feldmen runs the offense, helping the Cardinal best both
Arizona State and Arizona In Burnham Pavilion this weekend. Stanford has now won
seven consecutive matches at home and has dropped only one game over that span.
Both totals were match highs.
Cooper joined in on the melee
crushing six kills in can't-touch
this fashion. She hit one ball so
hard that it bounced directly into
the stands after landing in. The
All-Pac-10 middle blocker fin

The evening was decided by
the middle of the second game.
Cooper and Feldman connected

"Sometimes Stanford doesn't
take us seriously," Wegrich said.
"But tonight is the best they've

With the weekend sweep, the
Cardinal essentially sealed mat

"Ugly."
That's the one word that Arizona
State coach Patty Snyder mumbled as
she passed the sideline during intermis

Presumably she was referring to the
manner in which her Sun Devils had
just managed to wheedle game three
away from Stanford.
But the Cardinal (16-3, 11-2 in
Pacific 10 Conference play) itself looked
far from picturesque while downing
ASU 15-7, 15-11, 14-16, 15-7. Intent to
make amends, Stanford rebounded Sat
urday at Burnham Pavilion, pounding
Arizona 15-3, 15-4, 15-9.
Against the Sun Devils, Stanford
looked all night like it would need one
serious jump start. "We were due for one
of these," Shaw said. "We had been play
ing real well. But tonight, we just strug
gled. I'm glad it's over with."
In the contest, Stanford recorded a
season-low hitting percentage of .196.
Neither sophomore Bev Oden nor co
captain Kristin Klein hit over .300, a
true volleyball rarity.
The Sun Devils outblocked Stanford
12-9 and actually recorded one fewer
attack error on the night. Considering
that ASU entered the match with only
eight players on their roster, their effort
against the mighty Cardinal was no

"We still have faith in our eight play

Even so, hitting the panic button

"It wasn't a sterling performance,"

close out the game. Oden had a kill, a
solo block and a spectacular diving dig
during the run. Senior co-captain Jes
sica Benton impressed with a powerful
offensive display. She had two kills dur
ing the eight-point streak. Benton fin
ished the match with 10 kills, three
blocks and a .389 hitting percentage.
While Stanford appeared to be easing
into a rhythm, the Sun Devils continued
to fight. Three consecutive Cardinal hit
ting errors pushed ASU ahead 4-3 in the
second game.
Stanford recovered again, however
jumping ahead at 5-4. The teams traded
points until a Klein sideout kill at 14-11.
The junior delivered an ace to finish the
game.
Gowell and her teammates again
refused to concede. Instead they stuck
their heads down indignantly and
charged ahead in game three. ASU led 3-
1 before Stanford came back to tie the
score. Klein, who battled a cold all week
end, slammed three hard kills and
served two aces to give the Cardinal a
commanding 13-8 advantage.
But eight players with a lot of heart
proved to be troublesome. The Sun Dev
ils called time out, and then picked apart
the Stanford lead. ASU tied the score at
13 and 14 before jumping ahead to take
the game.
"It wasn't a sterling performance,"
Cardinal senior Cheryl Conly said. "We
didn't play together as a team."
While some of Stanford's big guns
had been silenced, junior Amy Cooper

was silently hitting .429. She smashed a
quick attack at 4-4 of the fourth game
and capped a five point run with an ace
at 8-4. The 5-foot-7 Piper Hahn got
involved in the offense with a kill at 10-
4 and a jump serve ace at 11-5. After six
failed match-point opportunities, Stan
ford sealed the game.
"The team as a whole wasn't very
good tonight," Shaw said. "But it's still
a win."
One win like that was enough. Stan
ford had no intention of stumbling over
another victory like that. Saturday
night, the team pummeled high-minded
Arizona. The Cardinal played more like
the No. 5 team in the country, hitting
.310 on the night and outblocking the
Wildcats 11-2. Four Stanford starters
hit over .300 for the match.
"Tonight was much more of a team
effort," Shaw said. "I think last night
helped us because it got us fired up."
Co-captains Klein and Benton
worked together to rock another Ari
zona school. Benton once again tied her
career-high of 10 kills and added a .400
hitting percentage to earn her own
coach's "Player-of-the-Weekend" award.
Klein recorded a match-high 11 kills
while hitting .333.
Klein and Benton went to work
immediately with early kills in the first
game. Stanford streaked to a 6-1 advan
tage forcing Wildcat coach Rosie
Wegrich to call timeout.
Her remarks proved minimally effec
tive as Stanford continued to control the
ball. The team made only three recep
tion errors on the night enabling Feld
man the full range of offensive options.
Outside hitter Jennifer Jackson con
tributed six first-game kills, sealing the
outcome.
Throughout the match, Aijzona suf
fered from erratic passing. The Wildcats
put several returns of serve over the net,
allowing Oden and Benton to tee off.
"That's the worst we've played this
year," Wegrich said. "We couldn't run an
offense tonight. This certainly is not any
representation of how well we can play."
The Wildcats had three hitters, includ
ing their best attacker, Terry Lauchner,
hit negatively during the affair.
Oden meanwhile menaced Arizona
defensively. She roofed six attacks and
dug nine balls throughout the match.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
Sophomore setter Carrie Feldmen runs the offense, helping the Cardinal best both
Arizona State and Arizona In Burnham Pavilion this weekend. Stanford has now won
seven consecutive matches at home and has dropped only one game over that span.
Both totals were match highs.
Cooper joined in on the melee
crushing six kills in can't-touch
this fashion. She hit one ball so
hard that it bounced directly into
the stands after landing in. The
All-Pac-10 middle blocker fin
ished with a .333 hitting percent
age and three blocks.
The evening was decided by
the middle of the second game.
Cooper and Feldman connected
on kills as Stanford scurried to a
9-3 advantage. After seizing the
game, the Cardinal went on a dev
astating 9-0 run during the final
set. Shaw felt he had seen
enough, giving both Klein and
Benton breathers near the end of

the contest.
"Sometimes Stanford doesn't
take us seriously," Wegrich said.
"But tonight is the best they've
played against us in two years."
With the weekend sweep, the
Cardinal essentially sealed mat
ters in the conference. UCLA,
which remains undefeated in Pac
-10 play, will likely claim the cham
pionship and host the NCAA
regionals in December. The Cardi
nal should finish second.
The team's next opponent is
No. 2 University of the Pacific
Tuesday. The Tigers handed
Stanford its worst defeat of the
season at Maples Pavilion Sept.
25. Pacific had lost one game in its
last eight matches before suffer
ing an upset sweep at the hands of
defending NCAA champion Long
Beach State Friday.
