# Roth-Kappa Sig sleepover aims to break down gender barriers
## 
### Allison Shue Staff writer 
Anomalies on a campus replete with
coed residences, Stanford's single-sex
houses often come under scrutiny for
their lack of gender diversity.
But last week, two such houses
attempted to bridge the gap between
males and females living in single-sex res
idences.
Roth House, the only all-female resi
dence on campus, and the Kappa Sigma
fraternity jointly participated in a pro
gram that focused on gender issues.
The Kappa Sigs initiated the program
and invited Roth residents to the Kappa

Sig house for dinner. About 15 to 20
women accepted the invitation.
Following dinner, the group moved
into the family room for a talk led by
Jerry Talley on "misconceptions men and
women have about each other and about
how they relate and fail to relate in the
right ways," said Kappa Sig Doug
Boeschen, who suggested the idea for the
program.
Talley, a former Stanford professor,
frequently speaks at programs on gender
relations offered through the Office of
Residential Education, according to
Kappa Sig resident assistant Gared
Jones.

In an effort to close the gap between the sexes that
exists in single-sex houses, participants spent the night
revisiting coed dorm experiences.

After the talk, the men and women had
free time until an 11 p.m. study break and
further discussion of feelings and issues
brought up during Talley's talk. As part
of Kappa Sig's regular Tuesday night
flicks schedule, a movie was shown after
the break.
Many Roth residents departed after
the study break, but about seven women
stayed overnight at the house, participat

ing in late-night discussions with frater
nity members.
The participants stayed in several of
the house's two-room doubles, with
women in one of the two rooms and men
in the other.
Roth RA Alyson Giardini said the
women really liked the program. "It was a
good idea. I really appreciated the effort
[the Kappa Sigsl put into it."

"[The Kappa Sigs] were very con
cerned about us being uncomfortable
going, but there was no reason for them
to be," she added.
According to Boeschen and Jones, the
fraternity's reactions to the program
were also very positive.
Boeschen said the experience
"reminded Kappa Sigma what it was like
to live in a coed environment and discuss
these issues."
Jones said, "Everybody was very
enthusiastic." As an example of the coed
experience, he cited that the Kappa Sigs
"really enjoyed hanging out at night in
the kitchen" and talking with the Roth
residents.
