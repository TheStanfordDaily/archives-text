# Playoff pairings announced today
## Women stomp USF to end season 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
In a game that was supposed to
honor the graduating seniors, a
freshman stole the show.
Freshman forward Sarah
Rafanelli tallied three goals and
an assist in Stanford's final regu
lar-season game, leading the No. 7
Cardinal past the University of
San Francisco 5-0 Saturday at
Maloney Field.
While seniors Elise Edwards,
Denise Denney, Jen Bloomer and
Jennifer Rowland capped off their
Maloney Field careers in winning
style, Rafanelli flaunted the
championship future of Stanford
women's soccer.
Stanford ends the regular sea
son with a 15-2-1 record, the most
wins in the program's history. But
the season isn't actually at an end
for Stanford, only a brief pause.
NCAA tournament bids will be
announced this morning, and
Stanford is expected to receive its
first-ever invitation to the 12-
team gala.
Stanford outshot the under
powered Dons 26-6 on the way to
its fourth shutout win in a row.
USF (6-10-2) played without
offensive leader Heidi Galvez, who
missed the game because of disci
plinary reasons, and was little
match for the playoff-motivated
Cardinal.

tion yet, but we broke the pattern
that has dogged us, rising up
against good teams and then
thinking we have an edge when
we play teams that aren't as
tough," said Andeberhan. "I was
really pleased to see the discipline
to not worry about the score
board."
In its last match against a less
talented opponent, Stanford had
to come from behind to defeat the
pesky UC-Davis Aggies, 2-1. But
there was no doubt Saturday
which team was expecting to win.
Stanford dominated play from the
opening and didn't back down
after grabbing a 4-0 first-half
advantage.
Rafanelli, a 5-foot-3 destroyer
on the front line, dazzled the Dons
with an array of offensive maneu
vers.
"Sarah has continued to
improve," said Andeberhan. "She
had played her best game of the
year against North Carolina
State, but she was even better
today. If she and Foudy ever have
the chemistry of Rocket (Row
land) and (Julie) Foudy, it will be
frightening."
Eleven minutes into the game,

Rafanelli found Carolyn Einstein
streaking down the right sideline
and connected for her team-lead
ing sixth assist of the year. Ein
stein collected the pass and
deposited it in the upper-left cor
ner of the net.
Ten minutes later Rafanelli
added to the lead with a diving
head-ball on a looping cross from
Foudy. Sophomores Foudy and
Einstein set up the score with a
give-and-go on the flank, and
Foudy struck the ball to a cutting
Rafanelli.
Junior fullback Michele Sulli
van got in on the scoring action
just one minute later, jacking a 16-
yard shot into the top-left corner
after a penalty-shot pass from
Mclntyre. It was Sullivan's first
score of the season.
Rafanelli scored her second
goal by beating goalie Aileen
Blackburn in a one-on-one
assault. She completed her hat
trick in the second half on a boom
ing left-footer from 15 yards that
scooted off Blackburn's fingers.
The three goals moved
Rafanelli ahead of Foudy to claim
the season points title. Rafanelli
has totalled 11 goals and six
assists, while Foudy finished the
regular season with 12 goals and
three assists.

shutout win. Stanford allowed .55
goals per game during the regular
season.
"In any given game not every
one is at their best, but everyone
stayed focused," said Andeberhan.
"Heather (Mclntyre) cleans up a
lot of things and gives people a
chance to get back in the game."
Stanford not only won the
game, but survived another 90
minutes without a serious injury.
In last weekend's sweep of No. 8
N.C. State and No. 12 Duke, Stan
ford's lineup was ravaged. For
ward Elizabeth Joneschild went
down with a broken leg, and Row
land and Bloomer aggravated
knee injuries.
Rowland this week was diag
nosed with cartilage damage in
her knee, but was cleared to play
just minutes before the game.
Rowland said that although she is
in some pain, she will not cause
additional damage by playing.
She didn't practice this week
and was burdened with a massive
brace during the game, but
started and will stay with the
team for the playoffs. She expects
postseason surgery.
"It hurts the same when I run
and when I walk," said Rowland,
who reinjured her knee against
N.C. State.
"She will tolerate a whole lot of
pain," said Andeberhan. "We let
her play so long as she can't do
any more damage. Luckily she
was able to play."
Bloomer returned to the field
with a wrap on her knee, and was
joined by a third victim of the Jen
Curse, freshman midfielder Jen
Gardiner, who had injured her
knee in the spring. It was Gar
diner's first collegiate appearance
after a long rehabilitation.
If Stanford makes the playoffs
as expected, it will have two weeks
to heal its wounds and prepare for
the three-week tournament.
First-round games will be played
on campus sites on Nov. 10 and
11.

NCAA as to who they play and where they go to open the postseason.
In a game that was supposed to
honor the graduating seniors, a
freshman stole the show.
Freshman forward Sarah
Rafanelli tallied three goals and
an assist in Stanford's final regu
lar-season game, leading the No. 7
Cardinal past the University of
San Francisco 5-0 Saturday at
Maloney Field.
While seniors Elise Edwards,
Denise Denney, Jen Bloomer and
Jennifer Rowland capped off their
Maloney Field careers in winning
style, Rafanelli flaunted the
championship future of Stanford
women's soccer.
Stanford ends the regular sea
son with a 15-2-1 record, the most
wins in the program's history. But
the season isn't actually at an end
for Stanford, only a brief pause.
NCAA tournament bids will be
announced this morning, and
Stanford is expected to receive its
first-ever invitation to the 12-
team gala.
Stanford outshot the under
powered Dons 26-6 on the way to
its fourth shutout win in a row.
USF (6-10-2) played without
offensive leader Heidi Galvez, who
missed the game because of disci
plinary reasons, and was little
match for the playoff-motivated
Cardinal.

tion yet, but we broke the pattern
that has dogged us, rising up
against good teams and then
thinking we have an edge when
we play teams that aren't as
tough," said Andeberhan. "I was
really pleased to see the discipline
to not worry about the score
board."
In its last match against a less
talented opponent, Stanford had
to come from behind to defeat the
pesky UC-Davis Aggies, 2-1. But
there was no doubt Saturday
which team was expecting to win.
Stanford dominated play from the
opening and didn't back down
after grabbing a 4-0 first-half
advantage.
Rafanelli, a 5-foot-3 destroyer
on the front line, dazzled the Dons
with an array of offensive maneu
vers.
"Sarah has continued to
improve," said Andeberhan. "She
had played her best game of the
year against North Carolina
State, but she was even better
today. If she and Foudy ever have
the chemistry of Rocket (Row
land) and (Julie) Foudy, it will be
frightening."
Eleven minutes into the game,

Rafanelli found Carolyn Einstein
streaking down the right sideline
and connected for her team-lead
ing sixth assist of the year. Ein
stein collected the pass and
deposited it in the upper-left cor
ner of the net.
Ten minutes later Rafanelli
added to the lead with a diving
head-ball on a looping cross from
Foudy. Sophomores Foudy and
Einstein set up the score with a
give-and-go on the flank, and
Foudy struck the ball to a cutting
Rafanelli.
Junior fullback Michele Sulli
van got in on the scoring action
just one minute later, jacking a 16-
yard shot into the top-left corner
after a penalty-shot pass from
Mclntyre. It was Sullivan's first
score of the season.
Rafanelli scored her second
goal by beating goalie Aileen
Blackburn in a one-on-one
assault. She completed her hat
trick in the second half on a boom
ing left-footer from 15 yards that
scooted off Blackburn's fingers.
The three goals moved
Rafanelli ahead of Foudy to claim
the season points title. Rafanelli
has totalled 11 goals and six
assists, while Foudy finished the
regular season with 12 goals and
three assists.
Meanwhile the defense contin

shutout win. Stanford allowed .55
goals per game during the regular
season.
"In any given game not every
one is at their best, but everyone
stayed focused," said Andeberhan.
"Heather (Mclntyre) cleans up a
lot of things and gives people a
chance to get back in the game."
Stanford not only won the
game, but survived another 90
minutes without a serious injury.
In last weekend's sweep of No. 8
N.C. State and No. 12 Duke, Stan
ford's lineup was ravaged. For
ward Elizabeth Joneschild went
down with a broken leg, and Row
land and Bloomer aggravated
knee injuries.
Rowland this week was diag
nosed with cartilage damage in
her knee, but was cleared to play
just minutes before the game.
Rowland said that although she is
in some pain, she will not cause
additional damage by playing.
She didn't practice this week
and was burdened with a massive
brace during the game, but
started and will stay with the
team for the playoffs. She expects
postseason surgery.
"It hurts the same when I run
and when I walk," said Rowland,
who reinjured her knee against
N.C. State.
"She will tolerate a whole lot of
pain," said Andeberhan. "We let
her play so long as she can't do
any more damage. Luckily she
was able to play."
Bloomer returned to the field
with a wrap on her knee, and was
joined by a third victim of the Jen
Curse, freshman midfielder Jen
Gardiner, who had injured her
knee in the spring. It was Gar
diner's first collegiate appearance
after a long rehabilitation.
If Stanford makes the playoffs
as expected, it will have two weeks
to heal its wounds and prepare for
the three-week tournament.
First-round games will be played
on campus sites on Nov. 10 and
11.
