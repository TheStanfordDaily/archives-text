# Water polo falls to Cal in final
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Going into last weekend's
49er Water Polo Tournament,
the Stanford team knew it was
taking part in a preview to next
month's NCAA champi
onships.
And now that this tourna
ment is over, the Cardinal is
coming out hoping that the
NCAAs are exactly like this
weekend — except for the final
game.
Saturday and Sunday's first
three games looked great for
Stanford. As expected, the
Cardinal defeated UC-River
side and USC, and then the
team really came through with
a crucial win over No. 3 UCLA.
All that was left in the Car
dinal's way was top-ranked

Water Polo

Cardinal places second
in Long Beach Tourney

California, the same team that
had already defeated Stanford
two times this year.
The setting for the tourna
ment championship was the
Belmont Plaza Pool in Long
Beach, the same pool that the
national championship will be
decided at. But that's as far as
Stanford wants the similarities
to go.
You see, Cal remains the
only ranked team that the Car
dinal has yet to beat, as Stan
ford once again fell to the
Golden Bears 11-7.
The beginning of the game
didn't look that bad for the No. 2
Cardinal, as goals by Colin Keely
and Greg Morris tied the game at
two with a minute and a half left
in the first quarter.
But then, everything fell apart
for Stanford.
Cal scored six of the next seven
goals to pull away from the tired
Cardinal and end Stanford's
hopes of a tournament title and a
psychological boost before
NCAAs.
Chip Blankenhorn led Stan
ford with two goals. The Cardinal
will get another shot at Cal Nov.
17 at the Big Splash.

To make it to the champi
onship game, the Cardinal had to
get past No. 3-ranked UCLA, and
once again, Stanford had to go
into overtime to finally defeat the
Bruins, 8-7.
Knowing that it would have to
play another game later in the
day, Stanford wisely decided it
wasn't up for another five-over
time thriller against UCLA and
managed to pull out the win in the
first overtime. Chuck Maguy
scored the winning goal with 22
seconds left in the first period of
overtime.
The first half of this game was
quite low-scoring for these two
explosive offenses, as the defenses
dominated and limited the half
time score to a 3-2 Stanford
advantage. Freshman goalie
Larry Bercutt had an especially
good first half and entire game,

for that matter. He recorded 14
saves for the match.
After halftime, the Bruins
came out with all their weapons
firing and before Stanford could
recover, the Bruins had scored
three straight goals to take a com
manding 5-3 lead.
But then, with two minutes left
in the third quarter, Stanford's
four seniors woke up and changed
the course of the game. First,
Keely struck to make it a one-goal
game. Then, after Stanford got
the ball back, Maguy scored to tie
up the game. The Cardinal was
not done, however, as Greg Olson
joined in on the act and put the
team ahead 6-5 as the quarter
ended.
The fourth quarter started out
the same way the last quarter
ended, as Bruin goalie Dan Hack
ett could not withstand the offen

sive onslaught and watched a Rick
McNair shot sail past him for
Stanford's fourth straight goal by
a senior.
To UCLA's credit, they did not
give up and came back to tie the
game with two goals in the last
two and a half minutes of the
game.
So into overtime the two teams
went — once again. But this time,
there would be no sudden-death
periods, as Maguy's goal stood up
and sent the Cardinal into the
championship game.
Stanford's two earlier tourna
ment games were held on Satur
day and were not nearly as
thrilling as Sunday's games. In
the second round, Stanford faced
USC and proceeded to convinc
ingly defeat them for the second
time this year, this time by a score
of 14-8.

Behind two goals from Maguy
and one each from Blankenhorn
and Mark Wallin, the Cardinal
jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the
game. USC came back, however,
and cut the lead to 6-5 in the sec
ond quarter. J.T. Matarangas and
Blankenhorn, who had three
goals in the game, temporarily put
an end to the Trojan comeback
with consecutive goals, but USC
responded with two goals of its
own to make the score 8-7 with a
minute left in the third quarter.
But that was as close as USC
would get, as Stanford quickly put
a hole in the Trojans by scoring
three straight goals. Wallin and
McNair scored in the last minute
of the quarter to stretch out the
lead, and Keely pretty much put
the game away by scoring 23 sec
onds into the final quarter.
The Cardinal's opening game

against UC-Riverside did not pro
vide or even require any dramatic
or heroic efforts by the team, as
the Cardinal crushed its over
matched opponent by a score of
19-2. The 19 goals are the second
highest total for the team this
year.
Antonio Busquets, a freshman
from Puerto Rico, got a chance to
display his talents in the blowout
and scored four times to lead the
Cardinal in scoring for the first
time in his career. Wallin added
three goals.
On Friday, Stanford visited the
campus of UC-San Diego to take
on the No. 15 Tritons, and this
game wasn't much of a match
either. Behind three goals each
from Keely, McNair and Morris,
the Cardinal was too much for its
hosts and cruised to an 11-7 non
conference victory.
