# Golfers take third in Stanford Intercollegiate
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Consistency was the name of
the game this weekend for the
women's golf team. At the Stan
ford Women's Intercollegiate,
Stanford finished third, behind
Arizona and San Jose State — the
No. 1 and 2-ranked teams in the
nation.
Stanford finished the three-day
tournament with rounds of 300,
299 and 298. "Our team played
very consistently," said coach Tim
Baldwin. "In all three rounds the
team held together at the end.
That is really important in golf —
it characterizes a championship
team."
The second round yielded low
scores on the back nine for the
whole team. "The team turned
the front nine 13 over and played
the back nine in six under par. It
was a terrific comeback," said
Baldwin.
Golfer Audrey Wooding said,
"The team total is one of the low
est we have ever had." Low team
totals were not uncommon this
weekend. Both Arizona and San
Jose State broke the existing tour
nament record held by Stanford
since 1985. Arizona shot 885 to
break the record by four shots.
San Jose State finished the tour
nament with 886. Behind Stan
ford at 897 came Southern
Methodist University at 906 and
Indiana at 912.
Individually, Pat Hurst of San
Jose State claimed the title. The
U.S. Amateur Champion shot 74,
68 and 70 for a total of 212. In sec
ond place was Arizona's Annika
Sorenstam. She shot 67, 75 and
72 for a tournament total of 214.
Stanford's Adele Moore tied
third with a total of 219. In thiee
rounds she shot 70, 77 and 72.
"This was a great tournament for
Adele," said Baldwin. On the par
-73 course she shot even par for
the tournament.
Wooding ended the weekend
with a 224. "I played pretty well,"
said Wooding, "but it was one of
those could've, should've,
would've things. I need to put it in
the past and look forward to the
next tournament. I need to

improve my putting. My expecta
tions get higher ana I expect more
from myself every time."
Stephanie Davis finished this
tournament with a 226. She had
low scores on the back nine in
both the second and third rounds.
"Her last two rounds were terrific
comebacks," said Baldwin, "she
had great back nines."
Jodi Figley shot 76, 74 and 78
for a total of 228. Freshman
Melinda Daniels shot 263.
"It was a terrific tournament,"
said Baldwin,"three days of great
weather and excellent course con
ditions. It was exciting right down
to the last putt for Arizona's win."
Arizona seemed to show their
stuff this weekend. "This is the
first time Arizona has really
played well here," said Baldwin,"l
attribute it mainly to their new
freshman." Sorenstam, a native of
Sweden, is considered to be one of
the best players in Europe. "She
hits long and very strong," said
Baldwin, "She is a totally polished
player. Both Pat Hurst and
Annika could be playing on the
LPGA Tour with very little prob
lem at all."
Although the LPGA Tour may
be in the future for some, the
Stanford women are concentrat
ing on an upcoming tournament
in Palm Springs. "As a team we
need to play as consistently as we
did in this tournament," said
Wooding, "and we need to beat
Arizona and San Jose State."
The Cardinal has a strong
record going into the tournament,
to be played Nov. 5-7. The team
placed second in New Mexico, first
at Washington and third here.
"The team performance is much
better this year," said Baldwin,
"The top four players started off a
lot stronger this year than they
did last year with the same sched
ule. They are playing much bet
ter."

nation.
Stanford finished the three-day
tournament with rounds of 300,
299 and 298. "Our team played
very consistently," said coach Tim
Baldwin. "In all three rounds the
team held together at the end.
That is really important in golf —
it characterizes a championship
team."
The second round yielded low
scores on the back nine for the
whole team. "The team turned
the front nine 13 over and played
the back nine in six under par. It
was a terrific comeback," said
Baldwin.
Golfer Audrey Wooding said,
"The team total is one of the low
est we have ever had." Low team
totals were not uncommon this
weekend. Both Arizona and San
Jose State broke the existing tour
nament record held by Stanford
since 1985. Arizona shot 885 to
break the record by four shots.
San Jose State finished the tour
nament with 886. Behind Stan
ford at 897 came Southern
Methodist University at 906 and
Indiana at 912.
Individually, Pat Hurst of San
Jose State claimed the title. The
U.S. Amateur Champion shot 74,
68 and 70 for a total of 212. In sec
ond place was Arizona's Annika
Sorenstam. She shot 67, 75 and
72 for a tournament total of 214.
Stanford's Adele Moore tied
third with a total of 219. In thiee
rounds she shot 70, 77 and 72.
"This was a great tournament for
Adele," said Baldwin. On the par
-73 course she shot even par for
the tournament.
Wooding ended the weekend
with a 224. "I played pretty well,"
said Wooding, "but it was one of
those could've, should've,
would've things. I need to put it in
the past and look forward to the
next tournament. I need to

improve my putting. My expecta

from myself every time."
Stephanie Davis finished this
tournament with a 226. She had
low scores on the back nine in
both the second and third rounds.
"Her last two rounds were terrific
comebacks," said Baldwin, "she
had great back nines."
Jodi Figley shot 76, 74 and 78
for a total of 228. Freshman
Melinda Daniels shot 263.
"It was a terrific tournament,"
said Baldwin,"three days of great
weather and excellent course con
ditions. It was exciting right down
to the last putt for Arizona's win."
Arizona seemed to show their
stuff this weekend. "This is the
first time Arizona has really
played well here," said Baldwin,"l
attribute it mainly to their new
freshman." Sorenstam, a native of
Sweden, is considered to be one of
the best players in Europe. "She
hits long and very strong," said
Baldwin, "She is a totally polished
player. Both Pat Hurst and
Annika could be playing on the
LPGA Tour with very little prob
lem at all."
Although the LPGA Tour may
be in the future for some, the
Stanford women are concentrat
ing on an upcoming tournament
in Palm Springs. "As a team we
need to play as consistently as we
did in this tournament," said
Wooding, "and we need to beat
Arizona and San Jose State."
The Cardinal has a strong
record going into the tournament,
to be played Nov. 5-7. The team
placed second in New Mexico, first
at Washington and third here.
"The team performance is much
better this year," said Baldwin,
"The top four players started off a
lot stronger this year than they
did last year with the same sched
ule. They are playing much bet
ter."
