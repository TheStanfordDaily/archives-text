CHICAGO (AP) - UNLV basketball coach
Jerry Tarkanian offered to sit out the cham
pionship tournament, forfeit a personal stake
of as much as $100,000 in playoff revenue and
abstain from recruiting for a year if the NCAA
reverses a ruling blocking the Runnin' Rebels
from defending their national title.
The offer was one of four alternatives
Tarkanian and UNLV officials presented dur
ing a two-hour meeting Sunday with NCAA
Infractions Committee, which capped a 13-year
legal dogfight with UNLV in July by banishing
the Runnin' Rebels from the 1991 basketball
tournament.
The three other alternatives were:
• UNLV's basketball team will not be per
mitted to compete in the 1992 tournament.
• Tarkanian will sit out both the 1991 and
1992 tournaments.
• UNLV will make no network TV appear
ances during the 1991-92 season, reduce its
scholarships from 15 to 13, and reduce the
number of official recuiting visits from 18 to
nine in 1991-92; and allow no off-campus
recruiting by any member of the basketball
staff for a year.
Each of the four alternatives was presented
as mutually exclusive, in exchange for which
Tarkanian promised to pursue no further
litigation against the NCAA.
The Infractions Committee has wide
ranging powers in the matter. It could simply
let the original ruling stand, accept any one
of the four proposals, or repackage portions
of UNLV's four proposals.
Four of the committee's six members atten
ded Sunday's second hearing with UNLV of
ficials, but declined to comment on the matter.
Chairman D. Alan Williams said only that a
decision would be made "in a timely fashion"
before he stepped into an elevator on the way
to catch a flight.
Similarly, both Tarkanian and UNLV pres
ident Robert Maxson declined to comment di
rectly. However, the 60-year-old coach, whose
winning percentage is the highest among active
college coaches, said of the offer, "I hope this
will be sufficient."
And Maxson added, "We're hopeful we can
get this behind us so the coaches can return
to coaching and the president can refocus on
the other university business that's at hand."
While Sunday's formal presentation was the
first time sanctions were put forward by the
school itself, it had long been rumored UNLV
might be willing to make concessions in the
areas of recruiting and network TV appear
ances.
