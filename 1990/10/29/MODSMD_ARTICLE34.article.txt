# Men win ugly over Hornets
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
It definitely wasn't the most
beautiful match in the world, but
it was a win.
In one of their poorest games of
the season, the Stanford's men
soccer team squeaked out a 4-3
win over Sacramento State. The
win moved the Cardinal to 8-5-6
while it dropped Sacramento to 7-
11.
"Ugly, ugly, ugly," explained
asst. coach Greg Peterson. "We
should have been up three or four
to nothing, but we let them right
back in the game."
But the Cardinal wasn't the
only team playing ugly soccer.
Just five minutes into the game,
Sacramento carelessly played with
the ball in front of its own net and
gave up a goal. Fullback Chad
Guptill and goalkeeper Dave Ram
barg were passing back and forth
when Stanford's Lance Killian
raced in, stole the ball, and
deposited it in the open net.
"It was an opportunistic goal,"
said Killian. "It was sloppy. I
anticipated and played off their
mistake."
The Cardinal returned the
favor though. Just a minute later,

Sacramento's Mark Beena inter
cepted a stray pass near midfield.
He made a run down the sideline
and dropped a pass over the mid
dle to the far post. Forward Dean
Discher caught up to the ball and
hit it past Stanford's diving
keeper Kyle Krpata.
With 29 minutes left in the
first half, the Cardinal crawled
back on top.
Sophmore Jason Keyes
brought the ball down the center
of the field. As he reached the 18,
he lofted a pass to forward Jason
Vanacour who was standing at the
post. Vanacour shot it over the
middle to Killian, and he put it in
the net for his second goal of the
day and sixth of the season.
Stanford increased its lead
three minutes later on what
proved to be one of the more beau
tiful plays of the game. Fullback
Brandon Farley took a throw-in
down in the corner. He tossed it all
the way to the far post where full
back Randy Mann was waitng to
head it into the net.

But Stanford let Sacramento
back into the game. Beena took
the ball down the wing again. He
was trapped down in the corner,
but he backed it up and sent it to
the 18. Sharif!* Abdu picked up his
teammate's pass, but no one
picked up Abdu. He took the open
shot and defeated Krpata.
"We shouldn't have given up
those two goals in the first half,"
said the Stanford keeper. "We let
them back in it."
The second half turned the
match into a war. Four of the
game's five yellow cards were
issued in the second period, and
both second-half goals came off
free kicks issued for fouls.
Sacramento replaced their goal
keeper with Dennis Bushman,
who opened the second half by
fouling Stanford's forward Bill
"the Kidd" Boilengier. Bollengier
was going up for a header off a
corner kick and Bushman came
flying out of the box to deflect the
ball. The two collided, and the
Sacramento keeper drew the foul.
That set up a free penalty kick.
Bollengier took the luck and beat
Bushman with a shot in the lower
left-hand corner of the net.

Sophomore Jason Keyes contributed to one of the brighter moments of yesterday's 4-3 win over
Sacramento State by setting up Stanford's second goal. For most of the game, however, the Cardinal
played down to its opponent's level and the Hornets tried to keep up with Stanford any way they could.
