# Card men grab fourth, women eighth at Pac-10s
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
At the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship meet Saturday, the
Stanford Cardinal had reason
both to celebrate and worry.
The men's team, despite several
excellent individual efforts, fin
ished a distant fourth behind Ore
gon, Arizona, and Washington,
which between them featured 13
of the top 14 individual finishers,
while the women finished in sev
enth despite great races by several
of the team's members.
The men need to beat one of
their three chief Pac-10 rivals in
the District-8 Championships
Nov. 10 in order to qualify for the
national championship meet.
Stanford will have its work cut
out for itself, though, as each of
the top three teams had four run
ners enter the chute before the
Cardinal's number one finisher,
junior Dave Scudamore, who com
pleted the 8,000-meter course in
25 minutes and 21 seconds. The
overall champion was Arizona's
Marc Davis, who won in 23 min
utes and 44 seconds. Davis is the
course record-holder and also won
the race last year. Three seconds
behind him was Oregon's Colin
Dalton.
Following closely behind Scud
amore on the Stanford team were
Gary Stolz, Fred Carter, Jason
Martin, Brett Allsop, Alex Accetta
and Dave Strang, who all finished
less than a minute after Scud
amore.
Using the same top seven run
ners at the District-Bs, Stanford
hopes to repeat its performance
last year, in which it finished
fourth at Pac-lOs, losing to the
same three teams, but then sur
passed Arizona to take third in the
regional meet. Although third
place was not good enough to

back next year and return six. And then, we
won't be wondering "if."'

qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships last year, it is this year as
the West was given another NCAA
bid.
Men's coach Scott Chisam was
pleased with his team's perfor
mance. "Fourth place against that
competition was very good for us,"
he said. "Since we do not award
cross country scholarships, we
will never get the Marc Davises or
the Colin Daltons. We will get
runners out of high school who
are excellent students and willing
to work at running."
When asked about the men's
chances at Pac-lOs, Chisam
remained optimistic. "It's still
very possible," he said. "The dis
trict meet is a 10K course, and it
will definitely affect the runners.
Although the race is only 25 per
cent longer, it's much more diffi
cult."
Chisam also realizes that as
good as Stanford's chances may be
this year to make nationals, the
Cardinal squad will only get better
in the 1991 season.
"If we don't make it this year,
then we'll come back next year
and return six," said Chisam.
"And then, we won't be wondering
'if."' Stanford's lone senior, Mar
tin, was running in the number
one and two slots on the team
before slipping to fourth on Satur
day.
The women's team, despite a
seventh-place finish, showed a
number of bright spots. Although
hampered by a chronic back condi
tion that nearly kept her from rac-

ing, senior Melanie Bloch finished
sixth overall after leading for two
thirds of the race.
"I told Melanie before the race
that if she couldn't run with the
leaders and was just back in the
pack, we would pull her," Chisam
said. "Cross country is really hard
on her back, and we didn't want to
take any chances if her back was
affecting her running."
Sophomore standouts Ashley
Black and Jill Shenkel took sec
ond and third, respectively, on the
team with personal course-record
times of 18:10 and 18:14, respec
tively. Freshman Amy Ewing took
fourth on the team with a strong
18:44. Rounding out Stanford's
top seven were Amy McConnell,
Jodie Bilotta and Debbie Wells.
The overall champion, Liz Wilson
of Oregon, took her second Pac-10
individual title in three years. She
was followed almost immediately
by teammate Stephanie Wessell,
as Oregon completed its Pac-10
cross country sweep.
Even though the women
slipped a notch from last year,
Chisam was extremely pleased
with the way the Cardinal ran.
"Our goal is to get this team to the
point where they will be serious
contenders in the Pac-10 next
year," he said. "Although the
women finished seventh, they
were something like third at the
one-mile mark. That's the pace we
asked them to go out at and that's
the pace they'll be able to main
tain next year."
Look out for the Cardinal in
1991.

finish at the Pac-10 Championships, held Saturday on the Stanford
Golf Course. With a roster of Bloch, three sophomores and a bunch
of freshmen, the Cardinal can expect to be even stronger in the
future.
At the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship meet Saturday, the
Stanford Cardinal had reason
both to celebrate and worry.
The men's team, despite several
excellent individual efforts, fin
ished a distant fourth behind Ore
gon, Arizona, and Washington,
which between them featured 13
of the top 14 individual finishers,
while the women finished in sev
enth despite great races by several
of the team's members.
The men need to beat one of
their three chief Pac-10 rivals in
the District-8 Championships
Nov. 10 in order to qualify for the
national championship meet.
Stanford will have its work cut
out for itself, though, as each of
the top three teams had four run
ners enter the chute before the
Cardinal's number one finisher,
junior Dave Scudamore, who com
pleted the 8,000-meter course in
25 minutes and 21 seconds. The
overall champion was Arizona's
Marc Davis, who won in 23 min
utes and 44 seconds. Davis is the
course record-holder and also won
the race last year. Three seconds
behind him was Oregon's Colin
Dalton.
Following closely behind Scud
amore on the Stanford team were
Gary Stolz, Fred Carter, Jason
Martin, Brett Allsop, Alex Accetta
and Dave Strang, who all finished
less than a minute after Scud
amore.
Using the same top seven run
ners at the District-Bs, Stanford
hopes to repeat its performance
last year, in which it finished
fourth at Pac-lOs, losing to the
same three teams, but then sur
passed Arizona to take third in the
regional meet. Although third
place was not good enough to

back next year and return six. And then, we
won't be wondering "if."'

qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships last year, it is this year as
the West was given another NCAA
bid.
Men's coach Scott Chisam was
pleased with his team's perfor
mance. "Fourth place against that
competition was very good for us,"
he said. "Since we do not award
cross country scholarships, we
will never get the Marc Davises or
the Colin Daltons. We will get
runners out of high school who
are excellent students and willing
to work at running."
When asked about the men's
chances at Pac-lOs, Chisam
remained optimistic. "It's still
very possible," he said. "The dis
trict meet is a 10K course, and it
will definitely affect the runners.
Although the race is only 25 per
cent longer, it's much more diffi
cult."
Chisam also realizes that as
good as Stanford's chances may be
this year to make nationals, the
Cardinal squad will only get better
in the 1991 season.
"If we don't make it this year,
then we'll come back next year
and return six," said Chisam.
"And then, we won't be wondering
'if."' Stanford's lone senior, Mar
tin, was running in the number
one and two slots on the team
before slipping to fourth on Satur
day.
The women's team, despite a
seventh-place finish, showed a
number of bright spots. Although
hampered by a chronic back condi
tion that nearly kept her from rac-

ing, senior Melanie Bloch finished
sixth overall after leading for two
thirds of the race.
"I told Melanie before the race
that if she couldn't run with the
leaders and was just back in the
pack, we would pull her," Chisam
said. "Cross country is really hard
on her back, and we didn't want to
take any chances if her back was
affecting her running."
Sophomore standouts Ashley
Black and Jill Shenkel took sec
ond and third, respectively, on the
team with personal course-record
times of 18:10 and 18:14, respec
tively. Freshman Amy Ewing took
fourth on the team with a strong
18:44. Rounding out Stanford's
top seven were Amy McConnell,
Jodie Bilotta and Debbie Wells.
The overall champion, Liz Wilson
of Oregon, took her second Pac-10
individual title in three years. She
was followed almost immediately
by teammate Stephanie Wessell,
as Oregon completed its Pac-10
cross country sweep.
Even though the women
slipped a notch from last year,
Chisam was extremely pleased
with the way the Cardinal ran.
"Our goal is to get this team to the
point where they will be serious
contenders in the Pac-10 next
year," he said. "Although the
women finished seventh, they
were something like third at the
one-mile mark. That's the pace we
asked them to go out at and that's
the pace they'll be able to main
tain next year."
Look out for the Cardinal in
1991.
