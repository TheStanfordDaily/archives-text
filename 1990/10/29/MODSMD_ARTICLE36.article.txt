# Birch sweeps at All-American
## 
### Gretchen Atwood 
If the Stanford women's tennis
team were a professional football
team they would beat the San
Francisco 49ers. While it is diffi
cult to imagine Heather Willens
and Sandra Birch digging in
across the line of scrimmage from
Joe Montana and Roger Craig, or
Debbie Graham covering Jerry
Rice on a post pattern, it is true
that the Cardinal netters are even
more dominant in college tennis
than the 49ers are in the NFL.
San Francisco has won the last
two Super Bowls; the Cardinal
have won five NCAA champi
onships in a row. The 49ers mea
sure winning streaks in months;
Stanford's winning streak is in its
third year and, if the Riviera Ail-
American Championships was
any indication, it may be years
before any team comes close to
beating them.
"This is the third year in a row
of total domination of the tourna
ment," said asst. coach Lele
Forood. In this weekend's action
the Cardinal swept the singles and
doubles championships, advanced
three players to the semifinals
and had a finalist in the consola
tion draw.
The singles final, an all Stan
ford affair, pitted No. 1 seed Gra
ham against No. 2 seed Birch.
"I was really nervous," said
Graham, "When I get nervous I
tend to miss my serve. I throw my
serve way out in front of me."
Birch took advantage of Graham's

serving problems.
"I was aggressive," said Birch,
"I returned well." Birch used
Montana-like accuracy on her
groundstrokes to win the first set
6-2.
In the second set, however, the
edge went to Graham, 6-3. "I was
working on coming in and it
worked," said Graham. The
momentum change did not affect
Birch's composure.
"I tried to be patient," said
Birch.
Graham started the third set
quickly, serving with a 2-0 lead.
But Birch's patience paid off as
Graham had more problems on
her serve.
"I double-faulted 100 times on
my serve it seemed," said Gra
ham. Birch was able to get back
into the third set but still found
herself down 3-5 with Graham
serving for the match. Birch broke
Graham's serve twice, however,
won the next four games and the
championship.
Later Sunday Graham and
Birch played again, but this time
on the same side of the net, in the
doubles championship. Birch and
Graham had good reasons for jit
ters, having never won a collegiate
Grand Slam doubles title, despite
having reached the NCAA finals
twice. They, however, were not
nervous.
"We were just loose because we
were so exhausted," said Birch,
"We were both hobbling out
there."
The Cardinal duo may have

been tired but their play did not
reflect it. They beat the No. 2
seeds, Indiana's Deborah Edel
man and Stephanie Reece, 6-3, 6-
X.
"We were communicating
really well and we really enjoyed
playing," said Birch. According to
Graham tough matches in the
early rounds helped them prepare
for the finals. The UCLA tandem
of Iwalani McCalla and Kim Po
stretched the No. 1 seeds to three
sets in the quarterfinals. In the
semifinals Karen Bergan and Jen
nifer Rojohn, a team from Arizona
State that had never lost to Gra
ham and Birch, fell in a close two
setter, 6-3, 7-5.
The tightest matches of the
tournament, however, were
turned in by Heather Willens.
After an easy first round victory,
Willens had two marathon three
setters. The first one, against
Georgia's Shannan McCarthy,
lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes.
Willens lost the first set 6-4 and
was down 4-1 in the second set
tiebreak.
"I just put three good points
together to pull even," said Wil
lens. Down two match points a
few minutes later, Willens was
able to come from behind to win
the tiebreak and the set. She even
tually won the match, a comeback
the NFL champs could admire.
Her next match was not any
easier, a 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 victory
over San Diego's Sakolwan
Kacharoen. Willens finally suc
cumbed to Birch in the semifinals.
