# New gardens growing up across campus

Gardening at Stanford. It's a
tradition even the earthquake
couldn't stop.
Although the Earthquake of
1989 closed several co-operatives
that had been heavily involved in
gardening, such as Synergy, new
gardens are springing up around
campus.
At Theta Chi House, the inter
est in gardening is relatively
recent. Senior Jason Lewis, Theta
Chi's official "house gardener,"
said planting for a full-scale gar
den began this summer. "We had a
compost heap with no real appli
cation," he explained, "so we
started the garden."
Lewis said residents grow "only
a minor amount" of food in the
garden — mostly seasonings,
"which don't require a whole lot
of water." However, he does grow
certain vegetables, such as toma
toes and zucchini, because they
"taste so much better than the
vegetables that are sold commer
cially."
Theta Chi also has several dec
orative gardens that don't grow
any food but make the house
grounds more aesthetically pleas
ing. "[The grounds] were in really
bad shape last year," said resident
Mike Harville, a junior. "They
look a lot better now."
Despite being closed after the
earthquake, Columbae has had a
small garden every year, according
to graduate student Joel Truher,
who helped work on this year's
garden. "Planting a garden has
just been something we've tradi-

tionally done," Truher said.
Columbae's garden grows "a
paltiy amount of food," he said,
"but it's really just for fun. If you
think about it, 39 people could eat
the garden in one meal."
Truher said a wide variety of
food is grown, including peas,
oregano, dill pickles, spinach,
Romaine lettuce, sage and thyme.
"It can be a lot of work," he
said. "The hard part is getting
started." Luckily for Columbae,
most of the necessary preliminary
work on the garden was done ear
lier in the quarter, before class
work began piling up.
A garden at the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest is still "in the
planning stages," said "Gardening
Coordinator" Charles Cargill.
"We've broken ground," Cargill
said, "but that's only a prelimi
nary part of it."
Cargill said the house hasn't
decided on what the garden's
emphasis should be — vegetables
or spices and herbs. "Vegetables
are nice, but we can't feed our
whole house." he said.
And there is definitely a mone
tary factor. "If we grow spices and
herbs," Cargill said, "we could
save a lot of money by not having
to buy those things for the
house."

Junior Eric Shen tends the garden behind Columbae. Even though
last year's earthquake closed several co-operatives on campus, gar
dens are springing up at many houses this fall.
