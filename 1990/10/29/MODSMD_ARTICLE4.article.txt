# Inside international politics:
## Professor's writings shape struggles toward democracy

Sitting in a serene Stanford office with
his black and white dog Deli, Philippe
Schmitter doesn't look much like a trouble
maker.
But deposed dictators like General
Augusto Pinochet of Chile and Premier
Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland would proba
bly disagree.
Ever since the political science professor
wrote a book on how nations rid themselves
of authoritarian governments and move
toward democracy, Schmitter and his writ
ings have been in high demand. Pirate edi
tions of his book "Transitions From
Authoritarian Rule: Prospects for Democ
racy" have appeared in Polish, Hungarian,
Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Korean.
And his personal contacts with opposi
tion leaders, senators, government minis
ters and academics have influenced inter
nal politics in nations around the world.
During the next six months, Schmitter
plans to travel to Hungary, Chile, Mexico,
the Soviet Union and Spain for meetings,
workshops and conferences on democrati
zation.
Schmitter, an expert on Southern
Europe, and his co-author Guillermo
O'Donnell, a specialist on South America,
were the first to identify what Schmitter
calls the "universal . . . relationship
between liberalization and democratiza
tion."
Using evidence from case studies,
Schmitter and O'Donnell argue that if a
repressive government is forced to make
slight reforms to relieve mass discontent,
people will seize the opportunity to push
reform even further.
People will spontaneously self-organize

into a variety of groups, including neigh
borhood groups, political parties, labor
unions and business associations, according
to their book. The government will then
find it progressively more difficult to con
trol the population, resulting in moves
toward democratization.
Dozens of countries have followed this
pattern, Schmitter said.

Schmitter's contacts with
opposition leaders, sena
tors, government ministers
and academics have influ
enced Internal politics in
nations around the world.

Dissidents throughout the world have
used his analysis to prove that their circum
stances are not unique and that they can
force similar changes at home. Also, gov
ernments can be convinced from the inter
national examples that changes are
inevitable. "You create a kind of mood,"
Schmitter said.
Schimitter and O'Donnell's scientific
theory of political transition has been used
in countries they never expected.
"I think the most exciting thing is that
[political actors] read these articles and
books and they say, "Gee. That sounds like
what's going on here!' despite the fact that
I had no intention, whatsoever, of being
'relevant' to that public," Schmitter said.
For example, Schmitter was invited last
summer to be a keynote speaker at South
