# Inside international politics:
## Professor's writings shape struggles toward democracy 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
Sitting in a serene Stanford office with
his black and white dog Deli, Philippe
Schmitter doesn't look much like a trouble
maker.
But deposed dictators like General
Augusto Pinochet of Chile and Premier
Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland would proba
bly disagree.
Ever since the political science professor
wrote a book on how nations rid themselves
of authoritarian governments and move
toward democracy, Schmitter and his writ
ings have been in high demand. Pirate edi
tions of his book "Transitions From
Authoritarian Rule: Prospects for Democ
racy" have appeared in Polish, Hungarian,
Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Korean.
And his personal contacts with opposi
tion leaders, senators, government minis
ters and academics have influenced inter
nal politics in nations around the world.
During the next six months, Schmitter
plans to travel to Hungary, Chile, Mexico,
the Soviet Union and Spain for meetings,
workshops and conferences on democrati
zation.
Schmitter, an expert on Southern
Europe, and his co-author Guillermo
O'Donnell, a specialist on South America,
were the first to identify what Schmitter
calls the "universal . . . relationship
between liberalization and democratiza
tion."
Using evidence from case studies,
Schmitter and O'Donnell argue that if a
repressive government is forced to make
slight reforms to relieve mass discontent,
people will seize the opportunity to push
reform even further.
People will spontaneously self-organize

into a variety of groups, including neigh
borhood groups, political parties, labor
unions and business associations, according
to their book. The government will then
find it progressively more difficult to con
trol the population, resulting in moves
toward democratization.
Dozens of countries have followed this
pattern, Schmitter said.

Schmitter's contacts with
opposition leaders, sena
tors, government ministers
and academics have influ
enced Internal politics in
nations around the world.

Dissidents throughout the world have
used his analysis to prove that their circum
stances are not unique and that they can
force similar changes at home. Also, gov
ernments can be convinced from the inter
national examples that changes are
inevitable. "You create a kind of mood,"
Schmitter said.
Schimitter and O'Donnell's scientific
theory of political transition has been used
in countries they never expected.
"I think the most exciting thing is that
[political actors] read these articles and
books and they say, "Gee. That sounds like
what's going on here!' despite the fact that
I had no intention, whatsoever, of being
'relevant' to that public," Schmitter said.
For example, Schmitter was invited last
summer to be a keynote speaker at South
Africa's most influential pro
democratic think tank. Although
he had no expertise in South
African affairs, many scholars
and politicians there considered
his general conclusions about
transitions relevant, he said.
"South Africa was the biggest
surprise," he noted.
While in South Africa, Schmit
ter said he met with possible
future leaders and personally wit
nessed how his general conclu
sions were applicable to contem
porary politics there.
Schmitter met with Frederik
van Zyl Slabbert, an opposition
member of the South African par
liament who had previously
resigned his position but who has
since re-entered politics. Van Zyl
Slabbert had been applying
Schmitter's conclusions to the
South African situation.
"In any kind of coalition gov
ernment, he will probably play a
major role," Schmitter said.
Schmitter also witnessed his
torical shifts while he was in
South Africa that matched his
generalized theory. One editorial
in a pro-government newspaper
commented that the government
and Afrikaaners had bitten the
apple of liberalization, and that
there could be no turning back.
Schmitter said the editorial is
significant because it seems to
show "moderates in the regime
realize that... the costs of nego
tiating with the opposition are
lower than putting themselves
back in the hands of the hard-lin
ers. That's the key moment that
seems to be true in case after
case."
"I think I literally was in South
Africa at that [key] moment," he
said.
The opposition must also come
to the conclusion that negotia
tion, rather than revolution, is
more likely to lead to democracy,
he explained.
Schmitter said many South
African politicians approached
him to say they were relieved to
hear the changes underway in
their society were not unique and
that deliberate choices could be
made to increase the chances for a
successful transition to democ
racy.
Another South African news
paper, "The Daily Mail," reiter

ated this point in an analysis of
Schmitter's remarks. According
to an editorial, "What is happen
ing in South Africa is not
unusual. At least 29 countries
have gone through similar transi
tions from authoritarianism to a
greater or lesser degree of democ
racy since Portugal in 1974.
"Not all have succeeded," the
editorial continued. "But when
judged according to a new theory
that has been extrapolated from
case studies, the prognosis for
South Africa is not that discour
aging."
Schmitter said "outreach" like
traveling to South Africa is one of
his responsibilities as a scholar,
although his time for such activi
ties is limited.

Members of both the opposi
tion and the government tried to
recruit him to be a South Africa
scholar, and Chinese activists
have suggested he focus on tran
sition in China.
Although he would like to
focus on more individual coun
tries in his work, he just does not
have the time, he said. And such a
focus would endanger the "com
parative-mindedness" that gives
his work value, he added.
Schmitter often downplays his
role in politics. "I can't point to a
single political act and say, tri
umphantly, that act would not
have happened if it hadn't been
for something I wrote," said
Schmitter. But, he added, "I think
it's had an influence."

During the next six months, Schmitter
plans to travel to Hungary, Chile, Mexico,
the Soviet Union and Spain for meetings,
workshops and conferences on democrati
zation.
Schmitter, an expert on Southern
Europe, and his co-author Guillermo
O'Donnell, a specialist on South America,
were the first to identify what Schmitter
calls the "universal . . . relationship
between liberalization and democratiza
tion."
Using evidence from case studies,
Schmitter and O'Donnell argue that if a
repressive government is forced to make
slight reforms to relieve mass discontent,
people will seize the opportunity to push
reform even further.
People will spontaneously self-organize

into a variety of groups, including neigh
borhood groups, political parties, labor
unions and business associations, according
to their book. The government will then
find it progressively more difficult to con
trol the population, resulting in moves
toward democratization.
Dozens of countries have followed this
pattern, Schmitter said.

Schmitter's contacts with
opposition leaders, sena
tors, government ministers
and academics have influ
enced Internal politics in
nations around the world.

Dissidents throughout the world have
used his analysis to prove that their circum
stances are not unique and that they can
force similar changes at home. Also, gov
ernments can be convinced from the inter
national examples that changes are
inevitable. "You create a kind of mood,"
Schmitter said.
Schimitter and O'Donnell's scientific
theory of political transition has been used
in countries they never expected.
"I think the most exciting thing is that
[political actors] read these articles and
books and they say, "Gee. That sounds like
what's going on here!' despite the fact that
I had no intention, whatsoever, of being
'relevant' to that public," Schmitter said.
For example, Schmitter was invited last
summer to be a keynote speaker at South
Africa's most influential pro
democratic think tank. Although
he had no expertise in South
African affairs, many scholars
and politicians there considered
his general conclusions about
transitions relevant, he said.
"South Africa was the biggest
surprise," he noted.
While in South Africa, Schmit
ter said he met with possible
future leaders and personally wit
nessed how his general conclu
sions were applicable to contem
porary politics there.
Schmitter met with Frederik
van Zyl Slabbert, an opposition
member of the South African par
liament who had previously
resigned his position but who has
since re-entered politics. Van Zyl
Slabbert had been applying
Schmitter's conclusions to the
South African situation.
"In any kind of coalition gov
ernment, he will probably play a
major role," Schmitter said.
Schmitter also witnessed his
torical shifts while he was in
South Africa that matched his
generalized theory. One editorial
in a pro-government newspaper
commented that the government
and Afrikaaners had bitten the
apple of liberalization, and that
there could be no turning back.
Schmitter said the editorial is
significant because it seems to
show "moderates in the regime
realize that... the costs of nego
tiating with the opposition are
lower than putting themselves
back in the hands of the hard-lin
ers. That's the key moment that
seems to be true in case after
case."
"I think I literally was in South
Africa at that [key] moment," he
said.
The opposition must also come
to the conclusion that negotia
tion, rather than revolution, is
more likely to lead to democracy,
he explained.
Schmitter said many South
African politicians approached
him to say they were relieved to
hear the changes underway in
their society were not unique and
that deliberate choices could be
made to increase the chances for a
successful transition to democ
racy.
Another South African news
paper, "The Daily Mail," reiter

ated this point in an analysis of
Schmitter's remarks. According
to an editorial, "What is happen
ing in South Africa is not
unusual. At least 29 countries
have gone through similar transi
tions from authoritarianism to a
greater or lesser degree of democ
racy since Portugal in 1974.
"Not all have succeeded," the
editorial continued. "But when
judged according to a new theory
that has been extrapolated from
case studies, the prognosis for
South Africa is not that discour
aging."
Schmitter said "outreach" like
traveling to South Africa is one of
his responsibilities as a scholar,
although his time for such activi
ties is limited.

Members of both the opposi
tion and the government tried to
recruit him to be a South Africa
scholar, and Chinese activists
have suggested he focus on tran
sition in China.
Although he would like to
focus on more individual coun
tries in his work, he just does not
have the time, he said. And such a
focus would endanger the "com
parative-mindedness" that gives
his work value, he added.
Schmitter often downplays his
role in politics. "I can't point to a
single political act and say, tri
umphantly, that act would not
have happened if it hadn't been
for something I wrote," said
Schmitter. But, he added, "I think
it's had an influence."
