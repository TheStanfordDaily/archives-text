# Sorority splash nets $3,000 for blind

### Dan Stearns 
The Delta Gamma sorority held its annual
Anchor Splash fund raiser yesterday, and
members proclaimed it"the best ever" in the
event'B six-year history.
Anchor Splash, which puts a wacky twist on
Olympic swimming competition, raises money
to aid the blind.
But not all of the the 200 or so competitors
on fraternity, sorority and dormitory teams
left Sunday's happenings at deGuerre pool in a
positive mood.
"That was a suck-egg mule of a decision,"
lamented Peter "Elvis" Huyck of Delta Kappa
Epsilon after losing the coveted Mr. Anchor
Splash 1990 title. "I'm just disappointed. I
spent hours in preparation."
Mr. and Ms. Anchor Splash contestants are
judged on poise, originality, balanced body and
costume, according to Anchor Splash organiz
ers.
Phi Delta Theta member Alex Perkins
missed out on the "girls, glamour and money"
for which he said he entered the Mr. Anchor
Splash competition, as the title went to Toyon
Hall's "Pistol" Pete Kocher, a freshman. Linda
Garcia of Okada captured the Ms. Anchor
Splash title.
The other Anchor Splash events included a
sweatshirt relay, in which participants pass off
a sweatshirt instead of a baton; a pizza box
relay, in which swimmers carry pizza boxes
without getting them wet; a synchronized
swimming competition; a most beautiful eyes
contest and the yahoo raft relay, in which raft
paddlers must yell "yahoo" four times during
their length of the pool.
Along with Toyon and Okada, Naranja and
Roble Hall were the only dormitories which
participated in the team events. "We didn't do
too well," said Toyon team coach Erica Pan, a
junior, "but we had fun."
