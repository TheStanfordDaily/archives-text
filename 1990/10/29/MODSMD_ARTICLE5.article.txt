## 
### Dan Stearns 
The Delta Gamma sorority held its annual
Anchor Splash fund raiser yesterday, and
members proclaimed it"the best ever" in the
event'B six-year history.
Anchor Splash, which puts a wacky twist on
Olympic swimming competition, raises money
to aid the blind.
But not all of the the 200 or so competitors
on fraternity, sorority and dormitory teams
left Sunday's happenings at deGuerre pool in a
positive mood.
"That was a suck-egg mule of a decision,"
lamented Peter "Elvis" Huyck of Delta Kappa
Epsilon after losing the coveted Mr. Anchor
Splash 1990 title. "I'm just disappointed. I
spent hours in preparation."
Mr. and Ms. Anchor Splash contestants are
judged on poise, originality, balanced body and
costume, according to Anchor Splash organiz
ers.
Phi Delta Theta member Alex Perkins
missed out on the "girls, glamour and money"
for which he said he entered the Mr. Anchor
Splash competition, as the title went to Toyon
Hall's "Pistol" Pete Kocher, a freshman. Linda
Garcia of Okada captured the Ms. Anchor
Splash title.
The other Anchor Splash events included a
sweatshirt relay, in which participants pass off
a sweatshirt instead of a baton; a pizza box
relay, in which swimmers carry pizza boxes
without getting them wet; a synchronized
swimming competition; a most beautiful eyes
contest and the yahoo raft relay, in which raft
paddlers must yell "yahoo" four times during
their length of the pool.
Along with Toyon and Okada, Naranja and
Roble Hall were the only dormitories which
participated in the team events. "We didn't do
too well," said Toyon team coach Erica Pan, a
junior, "but we had fun."

squad, was ecstatic after the
team's second overall champi
onship in two years. "This is defi
nitely a dynasty," she said.
The Phi Delts dominated most
of the day's competition and
notched impressive victories in
the first three events: the sweat
shirt, raft and pizza box relays.
The Phi Delts also took first in
the "most beautiful eyes" event in
which admirers place money in
canisters bearing photographs of
contestants' eyes.
Kappa Alpha team-member
Trevor Lor was virtually speech
less after his team's victory in
synchronized swimming. "This is
an amazing triumph for Kappa
Alpha," he said.
Lor pointed out his team's
interesting choice of music for the
routine — "Swan Lake" followed
by "Brickhouse" by the Com
modores.
Perhaps the most unique team
competitors of the day were John
Hornbrook and Geoff Chase, both
engineering graduate students,
who formed their own two-man

relay squad in a number of
events.
Anchor Splash lived up to its
reputation of fun, sun and spir
ited competition, but DG mem
bers were just as excited about
the funds raised to send visually
impaired children to camp and to
support national Delta Gamma
programs to aid the blind.
Organizer Costanza Cocilovo
estimated that the event raised
$3,000, nearly twice as much as
last year.
Cocilovo, along with assistant
Christine Vargas and the rest of
the sorority, had been working on
the event since last spring.
"This is a chance for people to
have fun, but give to the commu
nity," said DG Mary-Jo Wien, a
junior.
"It was the biggest and best
ever," said senior DG Michelle
Ledgerwood.
Matt Hein, a sophomore from
Toyon, also proclaimed 1990
Anchor Splash "the best ever,"
although he has only participated
for two years.
And DG Anne Marie Krogh, a
former broadcaster for KZSU,
said being emcee for the event
was "a step up in her broadcast
