# Search for 'innovative undertakings' led junior to solar car project
## 
### Steve Mitzenmacher Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a weekly
series ofprofiles of people in the Stanford com
munity.
International student Stefan Heck is busy
enough as an advising assistant in Larkin and
a symbolic systems major. But the junior has
also undertaken an even more demanding role
as a driving force behind the on-guiiig Stan
ford Solar Car Project. Coordinator Heck and
the team are currently hard at work designing
a new car.
Being from a different country and
educational system in Austria, what is it
like to head up the project here at Stan
ford?
Having spent all my secondary education in
Europe under a very rigorous, pre-set, intense
curriculum, I had little flexibility in my educa
tion. In coming here, I wanted to try out differ
ent ideas and get involved in more innovative
undertakings. This is sort of the perfect exam
ple of just that — being able to go out as a stu
dent on your own and accomplish so much.
How many total hours were spent
building the first car, and how many
hours did you personally spend on the
project?
It took about 50,000 person-hours invested
in the car from start to finish. Last year, I per
sonally spent about 110 to 120 hours a week
on the solar car project. The spring quarter
was donated exclusively to the project.
I can't stop out because the Immigration
and Naturalization Service wouldn't let me
stay here. I took all incompletes for one quar
ter. I was still officially enrolled but essentially
doing no class work.
What has the car been used for since
the June 17 General Motors' "Sunrayce
USA"?
We did one race in Northern California, the
largest solar car competition on the West
coast, and won. Since then the car has been

QUESTIONS

officially retired, but we do use it as a test vehi
cle for the new design and publicity.
What is the new solar car design like?
The car project is continuing with about
half the old team and 30 new members. We are
now working on a new design based on things
we learned from the past race. We have had
some innovative ideas [for] things that have
never been done in solar vehicles before. It is a
real departure from the first vehicle which was
a conservative design based on a combination
of what had been done before.
What was the process that got the
solar car project started?
The project was started by a request for
proposals of designs for solar cars by General
Motors to different universities back in
December of 1988. A visiting scholar orga
nized the first meetings for anyone interested
in the project. Soon, the visiting scholar left,
and out of that original group emerged leader
ship among the students themselves.
The whole project always has and always
will be totally student-run. The group spent
three months performing research and pre
sented a 60-page paper to General Motors,
[which] rated [it] among the top 32 presented.
This earned us a spot in the "Sunrayce."
How long did it take to build the solar
car?
During the summer of 1989 we built the
first test vehicle. By fall of 1989 we had the
refined design for the final car and in January
began construction of the car. By mid-June the
car was finished, and the first actual race was
the "Sunrayce," from Orlando to Detroit. In
that race we placed seventh.

How much money was spent on the
project, and where did the money come
from?
The project was worth about $200,000.
About $150,000 of that were donations "in
kind," or donated parts, supplies and services
[from] corporations and alumni. About
$48,000 was in cash donations.
How did your budget compare with
other schools in the race, and what
affect might it have had on the race's
outcome?
The schools we raced against had much
larger budgets. The average budget was some
where between $600,000 and $700,000. Some
teams had as much as $2.5 million. [Our] lack
of funding definitely played a large role (in the
race's outcome).
What was the greatest problem or
challenge you encountered while build
ing the car?
One problem was that everything ever
shipped seemed to arrive late. The other prob
lem is that it took much longer to build the
solar car than anyone had expected. It fol
lowed that old rule that everything took about
four times as long as you think it would ever
take.
Aside from that, the single largest problem
in building a car is that eveiything had to fit
together. Each person would work on one part,
and getting them all to match up and work
together was much more difficult than one
would expect.
What sort of help did you receive from
persons other than students in designing
or building the car?
Actual construction of the car was done
totally by students except for one electrical
engineering professor who helped out with the
electrical wiring of the car. The design was
based on students' ... actual design work.
These designs were presented to outside advis
ers, including faculty in the Electrical Engi
neering Department, aeronautics and astro
nautics experts and mechanical engineers or
researchers at NASA.

solar car than anyone had expected. It fol
lowed that old rule that everything took about
four times as long as you think it would ever
take.
Aside from that, the single largest problem
in building a car is that eveiything had to fit
together. Each person would work on one part,
and getting them all to match up and work
together was much more difficult than one
would expect.
What sort of help did you receive from
persons other than students in designing
or building the car?
Actual construction of the car was done
totally by students except for one electrical
engineering professor who helped out with the
electrical wiring of the car. The design was
based on students' ... actual design work.
These designs were presented to outside advis
ers, including faculty in the Electrical Engi
neering Department, aeronautics and astro
nautics experts and mechanical engineers or
researchers at NASA.

Junior Stefan Heck spent 110 to 120 hours per week last spring
helping build a solar car at Stanford. The car eventually took sev
enth place In an Orlando-to-Detroit race between solar cars built by
teams at various universities.
Editor's note: This is the first in a weekly
series ofprofiles of people in the Stanford com
munity.
International student Stefan Heck is busy
enough as an advising assistant in Larkin and
a symbolic systems major. But the junior has
also undertaken an even more demanding role
as a driving force behind the on-guiiig Stan
ford Solar Car Project. Coordinator Heck and
the team are currently hard at work designing
a new car.
Being from a different country and
educational system in Austria, what is it
like to head up the project here at Stan
ford?
Having spent all my secondary education in
Europe under a very rigorous, pre-set, intense
curriculum, I had little flexibility in my educa
tion. In coming here, I wanted to try out differ
ent ideas and get involved in more innovative
undertakings. This is sort of the perfect exam
ple of just that — being able to go out as a stu
dent on your own and accomplish so much.
How many total hours were spent
building the first car, and how many
hours did you personally spend on the
project?
It took about 50,000 person-hours invested
in the car from start to finish. Last year, I per
sonally spent about 110 to 120 hours a week
on the solar car project. The spring quarter
was donated exclusively to the project.
I can't stop out because the Immigration
and Naturalization Service wouldn't let me
stay here. I took all incompletes for one quar
ter. I was still officially enrolled but essentially
doing no class work.
What has the car been used for since
the June 17 General Motors' "Sunrayce
USA"?
We did one race in Northern California, the
largest solar car competition on the West
coast, and won. Since then the car has been

officially retired, but we do use it as a test vehi
cle for the new design and publicity.
What is the new solar car design like?
The car project is continuing with about
half the old team and 30 new members. We are
now working on a new design based on things
we learned from the past race. We have had
some innovative ideas [for] things that have
never been done in solar vehicles before. It is a
real departure from the first vehicle which was
a conservative design based on a combination
of what had been done before.
What was the process that got the
solar car project started?
The project was started by a request for
proposals of designs for solar cars by General
Motors to different universities back in
December of 1988. A visiting scholar orga
nized the first meetings for anyone interested
in the project. Soon, the visiting scholar left,
and out of that original group emerged leader
ship among the students themselves.
The whole project always has and always
will be totally student-run. The group spent
three months performing research and pre
sented a 60-page paper to General Motors,
[which] rated [it] among the top 32 presented.
This earned us a spot in the "Sunrayce."
How long did it take to build the solar
car?
During the summer of 1989 we built the
first test vehicle. By fall of 1989 we had the
refined design for the final car and in January
began construction of the car. By mid-June the
car was finished, and the first actual race was
the "Sunrayce," from Orlando to Detroit. In
that race we placed seventh.

How much money was spent on the
project, and where did the money come
from?
The project was worth about $200,000.
About $150,000 of that were donations "in
kind," or donated parts, supplies and services
[from] corporations and alumni. About
$48,000 was in cash donations.
How did your budget compare with
other schools in the race, and what
affect might it have had on the race's
outcome?
The schools we raced against had much
larger budgets. The average budget was some
where between $600,000 and $700,000. Some
teams had as much as $2.5 million. [Our] lack
of funding definitely played a large role (in the
race's outcome).
What was the greatest problem or
challenge you encountered while build
ing the car?
One problem was that everything ever
shipped seemed to arrive late. The other prob
lem is that it took much longer to build the
solar car than anyone had expected. It fol
lowed that old rule that everything took about
four times as long as you think it would ever
take.
