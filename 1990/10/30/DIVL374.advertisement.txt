McKinsey & Company is an international consulting firm which specializes in problem
solving for a broad range of prestigious corporations and, to a much lesser extent,
non-military government institutions. Founded in 1926, McKinsey & Company now
has 42 offices in 21 countries.
The Cambridge Systems Center was founded in 1984 to provide McKinsey offices
around the world with the resources required to address complex technological issues.
Our work covers a broad spectrum of activities, from hands-on prototyping to creating
conceptual solutions to abstract problems in systems and networking technology. We
are not looking for people interested in general business consulting; rather, we seek
those who wish to apply their rigorous technical skills to real-world situations.
