# USW custodians angry over schedule change
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
While many Stanford students would
appreciate a chance for 30 minutes of extra
sleep, dormitory custodians are angry
about a new work schedule requiring them
to come in a half hour later, calling it a vio
lation of the United Stanford Workers con
tract.
Instead of the 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. sched
ule from past years, the dorm custodians
have been working an 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
shift since the third week of September.
According to the custodians — all of whom
are members of the USW — the schedule
change not only makes things difficult for
workers with children, it also violates the
University's contract with the USW.
When the University wants to change
workers' schedules, the contract states,
"The workers involved will be given the
schedule and allowed a reasonable opportu
nity to consult among themselves and with
the steward." Then the workers can either
agree to the schedule or submit a revised
schedule to the University.
According to acting USW field represen
tative Linda Crouse and to many of the cus
todians, the University did not consult the
workers about the change before it was
implemented. The managers told the work
ers that the new schedule was "the way it
was going to be," Crouse said.
"They [Housing Facilities] didn't ask us

anything," said Guillermo Mendoza, a cus
todian who has worked at Roble for three
years.
However, Lynn Glick, associate manager
of student housing facilities, said she met
individually with all the dorm custodial
crews on August 28 to talk with them about
the changes.
She said two or three workers had ques
tions about the new hours, but no one had
any complaints. "I thought the custodians
were really wonderful [during the meet
ings]," she said.
She said Suzanne Tamiesie, manager of
student housing, sent a memo covering the
schedule change to all custodians.
"If some of the custodians were not noti
fied, they were on vacation," she said, not
ing that four or five workers were vacation
ing during August.
Many workers said the University has
handled the situation poorly. One custo
dian, who wished to remain anonymous,
said the workers received Tamiesie's letter
only a week before the schedule change
went into effect. He said the workers had
not been consulted before the letter was
sent out.
The custodian said he and some col
leagues complained to their supervisor
after the schedule change. Glick then
decided to hold a meeting for custodians
from Florence Moore, Lagunita and Roble
Hall, he said.
At the meeting, the custodian
said, Glick mentioned the budget
cuts and said the workers needed
to come in at 8 a.m. so there
would be no layoffs. "That sur
prised us," the custodian said of
the layoff possibility.
But Glick told The Daily yes
terday the work schedule had
been changed to better accommo
date student needs and related
operational considerations, not to
prevent layoffs.
"Students should not have to
work around custodians' sched
ules," she explained. "Custodians
should work around students'
schedules."
The schedule change "is a big
problem for everybody. . . . Every
thing has changed," said custo
dian Sandro Vasquez, who has
worked at Toyon for a year. Traf
fic is much worse at the new
times, he said, adding that the
Toyon parking lot is usually full
when he arrives right before 8
a.m.
Vasquez, who lives 45 minutes
away in San Jose, said the sched
ule shift makes it harder to spend
time with his two young children.
He said the University told the
custodians the schedule change
would save money. "But it's only a

half-hour" difference, he said. He
added that students had not
talked to any of the workers about
wanting a schedule change.
Glick said the change was a
logical one and was made because
of operational considerations,
without input from students.
According to Glick, when cus
todians used to start working at
7:30 a.m., they could not attend
to "high-priority" jobs such as
cleaning the bathrooms because
students were still asleep or were
taking showers at that time.
For the first half hour, the
workers spent a "disproportion
ate" amount of time on lower-pri
ority tasks, such as cleaning the
patios or picking up trash in the
lounges or outside the dorm. With
the new schedule, she said, custo
dians can immediately begin with
the bathrooms.
However, many custodians say
the change doesn't make sense
and only hurts the workers. Some
have to juggle two jobs, and the
schedule change causes problems
for them, Crouse said.
In response to the schedule
change, the custodians dis
tributed a petition during house
meetings last week. The petition,
which the USW will present to
Director of Housing and Food
Service Keith Guy in a day or two,
tells students the custodians "had
no input and no voice" in the
change of working hours.
"While to you the half-hour

voice' in the change.

change may be small, for many of
us it is important," states the
petition, which was written by
USW representatives and some
custodians. According to the peti
tion, many workers live far from
campus and the schedule change
puts them home even later than
before.
"Many of our children get
home around 3:30 p.m. and now
that change makes us get home
later," the petition continues. "We
must spend more on child care or
let our children go unsupervised
that much longer."
• The petition concludes by stat
ing that although custodians have
no quarrel with changes that help
students, they "have a problem
with this change because neither
custodians nor students had
input into it, it seems beneficial to
no one and instead just hurts us."
According to Crouse, the Uni
versity told the custodians the
change was something the stu
dents wanted, but she said stu
dents had no input in the deci
sion. "The University shouldn't
use the students' names if they
weren't consulted," she said,
adding the change makes no
sense.
