# USW custodians angry over schedule change
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
While many Stanford students would
appreciate a chance for 30 minutes of extra
sleep, dormitory custodians are angry
about a new work schedule requiring them
to come in a half hour later, calling it a vio
lation of the United Stanford Workers con
tract.
Instead of the 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. sched
ule from past years, the dorm custodians
have been working an 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
shift since the third week of September.
According to the custodians — all of whom
are members of the USW — the schedule
change not only makes things difficult for
workers with children, it also violates the
University's contract with the USW.
When the University wants to change
workers' schedules, the contract states,
"The workers involved will be given the
schedule and allowed a reasonable opportu
nity to consult among themselves and with
the steward." Then the workers can either
agree to the schedule or submit a revised
schedule to the University.
According to acting USW field represen
tative Linda Crouse and to many of the cus
todians, the University did not consult the
workers about the change before it was
implemented. The managers told the work
ers that the new schedule was "the way it
was going to be," Crouse said.
"They [Housing Facilities] didn't ask us

anything," said Guillermo Mendoza, a cus
todian who has worked at Roble for three
years.
However, Lynn Glick, associate manager
of student housing facilities, said she met
individually with all the dorm custodial
crews on August 28 to talk with them about
the changes.
She said two or three workers had ques
tions about the new hours, but no one had
any complaints. "I thought the custodians
were really wonderful [during the meet
ings]," she said.
She said Suzanne Tamiesie, manager of
student housing, sent a memo covering the
schedule change to all custodians.
"If some of the custodians were not noti
fied, they were on vacation," she said, not
ing that four or five workers were vacation
ing during August.
Many workers said the University has
handled the situation poorly. One custo
dian, who wished to remain anonymous,
said the workers received Tamiesie's letter
only a week before the schedule change
went into effect. He said the workers had
not been consulted before the letter was
sent out.
The custodian said he and some col
leagues complained to their supervisor
after the schedule change. Glick then
decided to hold a meeting for custodians
from Florence Moore, Lagunita and Roble
