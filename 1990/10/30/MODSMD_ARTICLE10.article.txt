Soviet, French leaders
sign friendship pact
RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) — Presi
dents Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union
and Francois Mitterrand of France signed a
friendship pact yesterday providing for imme
diate consultations if either country feels
threatened by conflict.
The two leaders signed the Treaty of
Friendship and Cooperation after an overnight
visit to Paris by the Soviet leader.
"In the case of si tuations which, in the view
of one of the parties, create a threat to peace, a
breach of peace or provoke international ten
sion, the governments of France and the Soviet
Union will enter into contact without delay to
coordinate all aspects of such situations," the
treaty said.
The treaty was the first between the coun
tries since a friendship pact in 1944, and
France's first bilateral treaty in 27 years. It
was signed at the chateau of Rambouillet, 33
miles southwest of Paris.
The broad agreement calls for regular polit
ical consultations. It also provides for coopera
tion in energy, non-military nuclear science,
transportation, high-definition television and
telecommunications.
Arts endowment drops
non-obscenity pledge
WASHINGTON (AP) - The National
Endowment for the Arts has quietly dropped a
controversial requirement that grant recipi
ents sign a non-obscenity pledge, now that
Congress has voted to scrap explicit restric
tions on the kinds of art eligible for federal
subsidies.
The pledge, instituted by endowment chair
man John Frohnmayer late last year, has
spawned three federal lawsuits charging that it
violated the Constitution's free-speech guar
antees.
At last count, 16 artists and arts institu
tions refused to sign the pledge and forfeited
more than $318,000 in endowment grants last
year.
Last year, Frohnmayer ordered all grant
recipients to promise in writing they would not
violate a congressional ban against endowment
support for works that "may be considered
obscene," including depictions of homosexual
or sadomasochistic activities, sexual exploita
tion of children or "individuals engaged in sex
acts."
Snitches may get rich
WASHINGTON (AP) — Savings and loan
whistleblowers could get rich under legislation
passed by Congress that provides rewards for
information leading to fraud prosecutions and
the recovery of ill-gotten gains.
The provisions, enacted as part of the crime
bill passed over the weekend, offer rewards of
up to $50,000 for information leading to pros
ecution of S&L crooks.
Whistleblowers who help Justice Depart
ment investigators trace ill-gotten gains would
share a percentage of the seized money if the
attorney general declared the information was
crucial to its recovery.
A person who helps the government recover
S&L money would share 20 percent to 30 per
cent of the first $1 million, 10 percent to 20
percent of the next $4 million and 5 percent to
10 percent of the next $5 million, according to
the bill.
