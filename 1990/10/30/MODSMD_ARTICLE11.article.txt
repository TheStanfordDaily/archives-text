# French hostages freed
## White House and Shamir make hawkish remarks 
### 
(AP) â€” Hundreds of French citizens
arrived in Paris late yesterday after leaving
Baghdad on a flight to freedom following a
three-month ordeal in which they had been
held hostage in Iraq and occupied Kuwait
on the orders of Saddam Hussein.
President Bush and Secretaiy of State
James Baker 111 warned the United States
would be quick to attack Iraq if provoked.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Iraq would pay a "terrible price" if it were
to 'Uay a finger on Israel."
There was no indication whether the
unusually hawkish remarks, in separate
speeches yesterday, were made in coordina
tion or meant to respond to any specific
threat from Iraq.
The U.N. Security Council voted to hold
Iraq liable for damages caused by its
takeover of Kuwait. Later, officers from the
five permanent council members met to dis
cuss the sanctions in one of the highest
level military meetings at the United
Nations but the session ended without a
statement.
In Paris, throngs of family members and
journalists cheered as the chartered Iraqi
Airways Boeing 747 carrying 263 French
citizens and 19 other Westerners touched
down at Paris' Charles de Gaulle-Roissy
airport at midnight.
Among the Frenchmen were the last
seven diplomats who endured an arduous
siege of their embassy in Kuwait.
The Iraqi jetliner picked up more than
50 French evacuees in Kuwait City in the
afternoon before flying to Baghdad, where
hundreds of hostages celebrated with beer
and whiskey as the plane landed.
About 60 French citizens believed to
have been in Iraq and Kuwait did not leave.
A French spokesman said some opted to
stay behind and others may have managed
to leave on their own.
Isabelle Renoir, the Foreign Ministry
officer in charge of the hostage case, said
one French citizen of Italian origin was pre
vented from leaving Iraq. She did not pro
vide other details.
"I can say now that all French citizens
who wanted to go home have gone home,"

French charge d'affaires Andre Janier said.
Hundreds of Westerners remain in Iraq
and Kuwait, some detained at strategic
sites as part of Saddam's "human shield"
against attack by the U.S.-led multinational
force. Some of the French citizens freed
yesterday had been part of the shield.
"The Iraqis constantly move hostages
from one site to another," said freed
hostage Patrick Moniodde, a director of the
French perfume company Caron.
"There was no hygiene," he said. "Toi
lets were very dirty, but we always got med
ical care. Sure, Iraqis do not want to lose
any hostages. We are free today, but it was
terrible for others."
Moniodde said he met at least a dozen
American and British hostages and noted
they were "very depressed."
The Foreign Ministry confirmed France
will honor Iraq's demand to fill the jetliner
with medicine for the return flight.
Medicine is excluded from the U.N.
embargo of Iraq and Kuwait.
President Bush said the United States
would "have no hesitancy at all" to use mil
itary force if provoked by Iraq and indicated
he feels no obligation to get Congress'
approval.
But Bush said at a news conference in
San Francisco he was "not preparing any
body for anything. I'm as determined as
I've ever been that this aggression will not
stand." More than 200,000 U.S. troops
have been sent to the gulf.
Baker, in a speech released in Washing
ton, said Iraq would suffer "the most
severe consequences" if Saddam decides to
use chemical or biological weapons.
"Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a
possible use of force if Iraq continues to
occupy Kuwait," he said.
The U.N. resolution, the 10th since Iraq
overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, was approved by
13 nations. Cuba and Yemen abstained.
Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambas
sador to the United Nations, said the reso
lution "will make it possible for those who
advocate war, combat and aggression to
explicitly say that they have exhausted all
attempts to achieve peace."
