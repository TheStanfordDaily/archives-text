# Refusal to fund S&L bailout may cost billions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Congress'
refusal to provide more money for sav
ings and loan bailouts will delay the
closing of failed institutions for
months and add millions, or even bil
lions, of dollars to taxpayers' costs,
analysts said yesterday.
Legislators' election-year squeeze
left the Resolution Trust Corp., the
bailout agency created last year, with
out the funds needed to close more
than 300 insolvent or near-insolvent
thrift associations.
That means the institutions will
continue to run losses, funding them
selves with high-interest deposits.
That in turn weakens healthy competi
tors by forcing them to raise their
deposit rates, raising the specter of
additional failures.
"It's going to cost us additional
money. We're going to have to slow up
the resolution of failed thrifts," L.
William Seidman, chairman of the

trust corporation, said in a telephone
interview.
He estimated the cost of a three
month delay at $250 million to $300
million. The Congressional Budget
Office put it at $300 million to $400
million, while Bert Ely, a private ana
lyst in Alexandria, Va., estimated it at
$2 billion to $2.5 billion.
The added costs, although spread
over the life of the bailout program,
will make it even harder for the gov
ernment to meet the $500 billion
deficit-reduction goal in the five-year
program adopted over the weekend.
The trust corporation, which had
handled 287 failed thrifts through the
end of September, has enough money
left to pay acquirers to take over an
additional 65 to 75 small institutions
by the end of this year, according to
spokesman Steven Katsanos.
But that would still leave it with
more than 100 S&Ls to handle on top

of several hundred others judged to be
near failure.
Also, financing disruptions tend to
discourage potential bidders and make
it more difficult for the agency to hire
the outside experts it needs, he said.
"The private sector doesn't adapt
well to uncertainty about whether the
bill is going to be paid," he said.
The agency has already been forced
to delay seeking acquirers for 18 large
institutions until its funding is secure,
Katsanos said.
Congress' Sunday morning revolt
against further spending left Bush
administration officials and
Democrats blaming each other for the
expected consequences.
Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas.,
chairman of the House Banking Com
mittee, said Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady's refusal to testify in
support of the administration's
request "created an unfortunate

atmosphere" for approval of more
money.
"They've got to get out of that
bunker over there in the Treasury and
come over here and join the people,"
Gonzalez said in a telephone interview.
However, Desiree Tucker-Sorini,
deputy assistant secretary of the Trea
sury, said, "The need for action and
the consequences for failing to act
were spelled out in great detail over a
period of months by the (Treasury)
secretary and others."
Private analysts were unimpressed
by both sides' arguments and likened
the situation to 1988 and 1986 when
political wrangling left the RTC's pre
decessor, the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., short of money.
"It's a very sad comment on poli
tics. ... It's a very lame excuse," said
Ohio State University professor
Edward Kane.
