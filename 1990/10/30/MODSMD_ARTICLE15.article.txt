## Covering the issues

New requirements
should address
most vital issues

IN JUST UNDER A MONTE,
the Faculty Senate will vote on
a measure that would place sig
nificant new emphasis on the study
of race, gender and non-Western
cultures in Stanford's distribution
requirements.
The proposal, by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies, calls
for an increase in the number of
required classes from 10 to 11, the
addition of requirements in "World
Cultures" and "American Cul
tures," the collapse of the Area 4
and Area 5 requirements into one
and the addition of an "asterisked"
gender studies requirement.
With reservations, we support
the proposal.
It is clear that the creation of
Cultures, Ideas and Values did lit
tle more in most tracks than
replace a few traditional texts with
a smattering of books written from
a non-Western perspective or about
the non-Western world.
The course still does not require
students to study non-Western cul
ture or the interaction between the
Western and non-Western worlds
in a comprehensive, analytical
fashion.
Making "World Cultures" a full
fledged requirement should accom
plish that goal.
More controversial are the pro
posals to add requirements for the
study of race and gender.
The distribution requirements
should not be used to promote
narrow intellectual agendas nor
the study of "trendy" academic
fields. But they should address the
most vital issues that will face stu
dents living in an increasingly com

plex society; they should, in short,
prepare students to live in the
world.
Race relations and the concept
of race itself constitute one such
vital issue â€” perhaps the most
vital global issue to confront stu
dents in their daily lives.
Further, it would be inconsistent
for the University to proclaim its
dedication to achieving a pluralis
tic society through Residential
Education and other programs
while ignoring the study of race in
the curriculum to which it believes
all students should be exposed.
But the name of the require
ment is problematic. Naming a
requirement that focuses on the
study of race in the United States
"American Cultures" is mislead
ing; it leaves us asking the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies:
What are you trying to hide?
The name of the requirement
should reflect its focus in a
straightforward way.
It is appropriate to make the
study of gender differences and
male-female relations an aster
isked requirement. Such topics
have also moved to the forefront of
American social life; however, the
limited breadth of the field makes
any move to institute a full gender
studies requirement unwise at this
time.
Finally, with reluctance, we sup
port the creation of a "Social and
Behavioral Sciences" requirement
to replace the "Human Develop
ment, Behavior and Language"
and "Social Processes and Institu
tions" requirements.
It is unfortunate that two
requirements encompassing quite
different fields of study have to be
collapsed.
It is necessary, however, to stem
the increasing number of distribu
tion requirements that limit the
freedom of students to pursue
their majors and enroll in elective
classes.
