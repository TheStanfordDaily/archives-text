## A 						grip on Virtual Reality 
### 
WE'RE BEING MEDIATED out of
reality. Or, to please the skeptics
among us, out of the reality we've
been taking for granted for the last two
millennia.
The one that places low tables in front
of our shins, oil-slicks in our waters and
sweet kiwi fruit in our mouths, that
smells like wet rain and feels like a wet
blanket — and that is unpredictable and
ultimately uncontrollable.
What clued me into this was a bill
board on the side of 1-80, just north of
Emeryville. I normally try to ignore the
things, but as this one momentarily
blocked my view of San Francisco skyline,
I had no choice but to quickly scan its
message.
It was an ad for Channel 4 News; in
the middle was a remote control with, of
course, the 4 button marked in red. The
slogan above read: "Channel 4 News —
Your channel to reality."
Since I was busy avoiding a confused
truck-driver (80 or 880, that is the ques
tion) to my left, I didn't think much of it
at the moment. But by the time I reached
Palo Alto, it had begun to bother me.
I am well aware of the common criti
cism of television as projecting a distorted
and heavily filtered view of the world into
our living rooms. Corporate television has
always replied by saying that it primarily
programs entertainment — there's
always the news if you want the real stuff.
What this ad seemed to be saying is
that, hey, if you want to know what's
going on, the only real way to do it is
through watching our images on the
screen every day at 5 o'clock. Forget that

other stuff around you, like the life you're
living and the sights you're seeing, and
just watch us — we'll show you life.
Not only does that ignore the ability
(and tendency — can't have a slow news
day) of the media to create an event sim
ply by choosing to train the camera on
this or that, it ties existence to what's
happening on the tube.
And the next logical step is already
appearing on the horizon. A relatively
young off-shoot of the computer industry
is seeking to create comprehensive reali
ties at the tap of a key. The people who
work in this field call what they do "Vir
tual Reality," a wonderful oxymoron.
They're seeking to take the idea of
TV/video being our channel to reality to
the extreme by creating computer-gener
ated worlds into which people, clad in her
metic techno-suits, can step without
being able to tell that what they've
stepped into isn't anything more than
images on a screen.
With your eyes locked into stereo video
screens and your hands enveloped in sen
sitive gloves, Virtual Realists hope, you
can experience a full range of sensations.
You bump against a generated table
appearing before your eyes, and the suit
makes it feel as if you've actually bumped
into a table.
You raise your head and the generated
horizon slips down to turn into a blue sky.
You grab for a generated cup and a gener
ated hand, meant to be your hand, grabs
it and it feels solid.
If they actually ever fully implement
such a machine, the mediation of reality
provided by Channel 4's news becomes

the mediation provided by the computer
programmer; the channel has many more
bands, but it's still being programmed.
And the danger that lurks in television
being the primary determiner of what you
see and hear — that it's a predetermined,
infinitesimal slice of reality that charades
as the whole thing — grows exponentially.
Add to that events, such as earth
quakes, love at first sight and hamburg
ers dripping grease all over your new
shirt, which will not be random in these
'worlds'; they'll be programmed.
I don't know about you, but if there is
a force ordering the incomprehensible
happenings in this world, I'd much prefer
it be some omniscient, if a bit cranky, old
geezer than some young cyberpunk.
I don't mean to be alarmist. Or maybe
I do, I'm not sure. True Virtual Reality
(think about that phrase!) is a long ways
off. It's heading this way though, and the
anti-reality attitude that makes it a
frightening prospect is already in place.
We might want to start thinking about
its implications, before the tree of knowl
edge becomes a trunk of fiber-optic
cabling, bitstreaming our conscious exis
tence into a digitized elsewhere and inter
facing our sensuous experience of the
world into a video null-space.

Jason Lewis isn't. But his column is, and
it appears every Tuesday.
