## Theme house proposal would hurt diversity, segregate students 
### 
WE APPRECIATED THE Daily's
recent coverage of Stanford's
ethnic theme houses. We were
astonished, however, by the misguided
proposal in the Oct. 25 editorial that
suggested freshmen should not be ran
domly assigned to theme houses.
In addition to serving as supportive
places where freshman of color can cele
brate their own culture, ethnic theme
dorms also aim to provide a superior
atmosphere for cross-cultural learning.
Since The Daily's proposal would lead
to less diversity in the ethnic theme
dorms, this essential goal could not be
realized.
The Daily stated that "enough fresh
men request assignments to ethnic
theme houses that quotas for classes can
be filled without randomly assigning
anyone there."
That "most of these requests come

The proposal would create segregated dorms at
Stanford and the ethnic theme houses would
have no defense against charges of separatism.

from students who are members of the
theme house's ethnicity" doesn't seem to
affect the proposal.
The Daily seems ready to throw the
delicate ethnic balance in our theme
houses out the window. Were the
Housing Center to adopt the proposal,
virtually all the freshmen in the ethnic
theme houses could be of the house's
ethnicity.
Consider with us some of the obvious
implications:
• Fewer students not of the theme
house's ethnicity would choose the

house, intimidated by the house's ethnic
imbalance;
• Cross-cultural learning would be
greatly hindered for both students of
color and white students because of a
lack of diversity in the dorms;
• The proposal would create segre
gated dorms at Stanford and the ethnic
theme houses would have no defense
against charges of separatism;
• Those students who have a reward
ing and fulfilling year after being ran
domly placed in an ethnic theme house
would never get that chance.

In the last few years, the overwhelm
ing mtgority of randomly placed fresh
men at Casa Zapata have found it to be a
comfortable, supportive and lively dorm.
Year after year, our dorm is one of the
most popular on campus.
Before coming to Stanford, it never
occurred to many of them to choose Zap
ata, but after experiencing it, they were
glad they were placed here. Many come
back as returning residents, theme asso
ciates or resident assistants.
Perhaps it is the randomly assigned
people who can most benefit from the
ethnic theme house experience. Those of
us who were randomly assigned here
hope future students will have the same
opportunity.
