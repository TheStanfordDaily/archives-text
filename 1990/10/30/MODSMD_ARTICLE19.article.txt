# Stanford won't raise indirect cost rate to recover losses
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily should be com
mended for its thorough and responsible
coverage of the issue of indirect cost
recovery for government sponsored
research at Stanford.
However, statements attributed to me
in a Oct. 19 story ("Rosse: Stanford
won't collect money it says government
owes") may be open to misinterpreta
tion.
Here are the facts: An internal audit
review of the indirect cost rate negotia
tions concluded that the University gen
erally has under-recovered indirect costs
for the past 10 years, with a result that
approximately $13 million currently

remains unrecovered from the govern
ment.
Under the system of "fixed with
carry-forward" cost recovery, any over
or under-recovery in a given year is "car
ried forward" to a subsequent year for
reimbursement.
That is, in order to recover the $13
million under-recovery, the amount
would be added to a subsequent year,
pushing up the indirect cost rate for that
year.
However, we have pledged to hold the
rate for indirect costs to no more than 78
percent, even if our overhead rate is
actually higher. We took this action to
make Stanford more competitive with
other research institutions.
I should also note that although Stan
ford has proposed an indirect cost rate of
78 percent for the current fiscal year, we
are working under a provisional rate of
74 percent.
The point I want to make clear is that
Stanford would like to be reimbursed for
