# SAT may face revisions
## College Board set to decide fate of test 
### Sarah Truitt Staff writer 
The College Board will decide tomorrow
whether to introduce changes to the
Scholastic Aptitude Tests in response to
charges that the tests discriminate on the
basis of gender, race and socioeconomic dif
ferences.
The biggest changes proposed are the
inclusion of a student-written essay and
open-ended math questions, in which stuÂ«
dents would come up with their own
answers instead of answering multiple
choice questions. If approved, the changes
will be implemented in 1993.
The changes are intended to eliminate
biases and better measure skills, College
Board President Donald Stewart told the
New York Times.
However, certain officials at California
universities adamantly oppose the inclu
sion of an essay, due to the high rate of
immigration into the state, especially that
of Asians. They claim the test will discrimi
nate against non-native speakers.
Patrick Hayashi, a member of the test
revision committee and the associate vice
chancellor at UC-Berkeley, wrote in a confi
dential letter to another committee mem
ber, "I think the College Board has done an
abysmally poor job of examining the possi

ble effects on non-native speakers."
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter is opti
mistic about the addition of an essay to the
SATs, however. "To get the most out of a
Stanford education, you have to be able to
write well," she said. Also, she said the
essay is a chance to demonstrate a greater
degree of creativity than is possible on the
current exam.
Although many say the essay tips the
balance away from non-native English
speakers, Fetter emphasized that Stan
ford's application asks what language an
applicant speaks at home and considers this
carefully.
"The SAT is but one of many quantita
tive measures used in admissions," she
reassured. "Our process is very subjective.
We wouldn't do anything differently [if the
new revisions to the test were used], but I
think we would benefit" from them.
Education Prof. Edward Haertl, who
specializes in academic testing and mea
surement, said he likes the proposed
changes.
Haertl said current tests efficiently mea
sure aptitude, but added an essay would
make the exam seem more fair or politically
acceptable. He also said the exams could be
used to improve school curricula based on
