Culture not because of their content, but
simply because their authors were dead
white males. He terms what followed as
"censorship by accusation."

Charles Sykes' book "The Hollow

tics and corruption in higher education.
He follows the change of the American
university into a political entity through
out the last 30 years culminating in the
most recent academic attempts at 'diver
sity' which he claims has resulted in the
"decline of liberal arts."
Liberal arts, as described by Robert
Maynard Hutchins, supposedly frees peo
ple "from the prison-house of [their]
class, race, time, place, background, fam
ily, and even [their] nation" but has
become a battle ground for these very dis
tinctions. The threats of racism, sexism,
and elitism have converted the ideas of
liberal arts into mainstream ideologies.

Wesleyan, Vassar, Berkeley, Harvard and

only desirable because it fits the bill of a
work by a black Algerian author.
He does not seem to consider that
there is a definite importance attached to
any work that symbolizes any significant
movement or way of thought in the
world, even if it advocates violence. Sykes
does not consider what is realistic, but
only what is lofty.
Certainly Fanon should not replace the
works of Locke, as Sykes claims he will,
but room ought to be made for both. For
that is an ongoing clash between and
within all cultures — realism vs. idealism.
Sykes emphasizes the potential for a
student to graduate from any number of
institutes for higher learning without
having read the works of Dante, Galileo
or even Shakespeare. He does not take
into account, however, that this is not
always or even often the case, but merely

a possibility.
While his concerns and affronts are
very well founded and researched, he
should not be so quick to criticize the
availability of choices.
These same universities practice the
affirmative action programs which also
hold questionable values. Sykes asserts
that academia has made little progress
towards increasing black success in
higher education. "Universities have
shown a greater talent for recruiting
rather than graduating minorities," he
writes.
Sykes argues universities are so con
cerned about fulfilling quotas that often
minority students with clear potential for
academic success flounder upon arrival at
schools since they are accepted with fewer
qualifications than other students and
are thrust into an immediately advanced
environment and are neglected after

acceptance time.
Another result of the blind attachment
to mainstream ideologies is that attempts
at multiculturalism often have a sepa
ratist outcome. Sykes discusses Brown's
Third World Assimilation Program where
all minorities are given a separate orien
tation and are put more on the defensive
about Western prejudices, perhaps caus
ing more tensions.
He traces this tendency for institu
tions to bend at the slightest protest
through a long history of conflicts.
Sykes borrows T.S. Eliot's metaphor of
"Hollow Men" to explain that the ones
who suffer most are the students who are
taught according to "ideological confor
mity."
He shows that the inconsistent values
of trends and politics which blow in and
out of the classroom can produce a class
of "Hollow Men." But because his per
spective is one-sided, his assertions

Student Union.
Sykes argues the BSU objected to
many of the books studied in Western
Culture not because of their content, but
simply because their authors were dead
white males. He terms what followed as
"censorship by accusation."
After several editorials appeared in
The Daily supporting Western Culture,
the BSU lashed back with accusations of
racism. Sykes feels that the opposition
was intimidated to silence.
Former Education Secretary William
Bennett surmised, "For a moment a great
university was brought low by the very
forces which modern universities came to
be opposed: ignorance, irrationality, and
intimidation."
And so, the concepts and ideas of the
writings of Plato, Dante, Freud, the Bible,
Aristotle, Goethe and others which
express many of the complex depths of all
human experience were shifted to make
room for the ideology of multicultural
ism.
It should be noted, however, that Sykes

Charles Sykes' book "The Hollow
Men," sequel to "ProfScam," studies poli
tics and corruption in higher education.
He follows the change of the American
university into a political entity through
out the last 30 years culminating in the
most recent academic attempts at 'diver
sity' which he claims has resulted in the
"decline of liberal arts."
Liberal arts, as described by Robert
Maynard Hutchins, supposedly frees peo
ple "from the prison-house of [their]
class, race, time, place, background, fam
ily, and even [their] nation" but has
become a battle ground for these very dis
tinctions. The threats of racism, sexism,
and elitism have converted the ideas of
liberal arts into mainstream ideologies.
Examples from Brown, Dartmouth,
Wesleyan, Vassar, Berkeley, Harvard and
many others are cited and discussed, but
Stanford students should find Sykes'
study particularly interesting.

He does not seem to consider that
there is a definite importance attached to
any work that symbolizes any significant
movement or way of thought in the
world, even if it advocates violence. Sykes
does not consider what is realistic, but
only what is lofty.
Certainly Fanon should not replace the
works of Locke, as Sykes claims he will,
