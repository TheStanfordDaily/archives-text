Dear Melanie,
Forgive me for unloading all
my miseries on you.
I wish I could be free.
I wish

I want
I hope
to doeth better!
— Roberta
— A letter to the author from Bibi
Lee, "The Dead Girl" by Melanie
Thornstrom.
"The Dead Girl" is the true
story of Roberta (Bibi) Lee, a
young student at UC-Berkeley
who went out jogging one day and

simply disappeared. Her best
friend, Melanie Thernstrom,
unravels the tale of the search for
Bibi and her killer in this complex
and engrossing book.
Unlike most "real life" stories,
"The Dead Girl" is not simply a
gory recitation of details and facts,
designed to appeal to those wait
ing in line at the grocery store.
You won't find any melodrama
or vicious serial killers. Instead,
Melanie tells Bibi's story from the
perspective of a grieving friend.
The thing which makes this
book so special and so different
from so many others of its genre is
that it is not simply the story of a
girl's murder.
It's the story of a grieving fam
ily who try to move forward, but
are paralyzed by the past. It's the
story of Melanie's maturation and
her move toward independence
and self-reliance. It's the story of
Bibi, who could not find happiness
in life or peace in death.
In addition, this book confronts
fears of living in modern day soci
ety and the emotional scars which
crime leaves on its victims and
those who care about them. It
evaluates justice as we perceive it
in this country and the uncer
tainty of absolute right and
wrong.
This book is so powerful
because of the sensitivity of
Melanie Thernstrom. While "The
Dead Girl" is a nonfiction piece,
the book reads like a novel, largely
due to the author's writing ability.
A talented poet, Thernstrom
expresses her perceptions of the
entire experience beautifully.
She moves chronologically
from the time of Bibi's disappear

ance and accurately reveals the
details of the entire case while
interweaving her understanding
of the events.
She describes, "I have nine
photographs [of Bibi]. Nine — say
it a few more times and even the
number will seem significant. Ah,
the significance of retrospect,
invading, coloring, spoiling the
accidental. I was given the pho
tographs; I could have just as eas
ily been given ten. Or four."
Passages such as these use lan
guage to transform this book from
a factual narrative to a moving
experience.
The emotional impact of this
book may become too much for
some readers. Toward the middle,
the author becomes almost too
self-involved. The focus shifts
completely from Bibi onto
Melanie and the reader is
drowned in the minute by minute
anxieties of the writer.
While the feelings of the author
are an integral part of the story,
there are times when the author
slips into a litany of self-doubt and
insecurity.
Although these self-examina
tions become difficult to read after
a while because the same issues
are continually brought up again
and again, they are necessary for
the author to explore all her feel
ings in the book.
This experience wasn't always
tragically beautiful or beautifully
tragic, sometimes it was annoying
and frustrating, because Bibi's
death wasn't a dimestore novel, it
was reality.
