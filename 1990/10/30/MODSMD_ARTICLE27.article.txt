The Urban Adventure Hand
book
By Alan S. North
Ten Speed, $11.95, 148 pages
Alan North has now helped
resolve individuals to the environ
mental crisis that is upon them —
answering the call of the wild, but
in a concrete jungle.
North describes a variety of
bizarre escapades, ranging from
urban spelunking (exploring the
subterranean world) to riding on
the tops of elevators
Each section has information
about the medium, the technique,
safety and special risks, as well as
an indispensable part on Eti
quette. For spelunking, he
advises, "if you meet homeless
people living in the underworld,
treat them courteously and with
respect. You are passing through
their house."
The book provides an interest
ing way to spend an afternoon —
whether you choose to read the
book or act on it.
Chuck Amuck: The Life and
Times of an Animated Car
toonist
By Chuck Jones
Avon, $12.95, 294 pages

This meandering, anecdotal
autobiography is fun to go
through. Jones reveals the influ
ences on him that helped him cre
ate some of his unforgettable
characters.
He recalls how, at age 7, he dis
covered the strong bonds that
linked his physique and personal
ity to that of the coyote. The rest
is history.
The book is liberally sprinkled
with doodles and color graphics in
a reasonably random manner. But
perhaps the spirit of the book and
the author are best exemplified by
rule 8 for the Coyote-Road Run
ner series: "Whenever possible,
make gravity the coyote's greatest
enemy."
"It is easier and more believ
able to humanize animals than it
is to humanize humans," Jones
claims, and he has spent a lifetime
proving it. The book contains the
scripts to several classics involv
ing Pepe Le Pew, Bugs Bunny and
a host of other unforgettable char
acters.
