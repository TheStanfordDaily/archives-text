## Women travel to No. 2 Pacific 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
The last time Stanford and the Uni
versity of the Pacific played, the Cardi
nal probably felt like it was on the road
by the end of the match. The only fans
yelling at the conclusion of that compe
tition were orange-clad UOP alumni
who had traveled to Stanford for the
contest.
Tonght, Stanford will probably feel
like that no matter what the outcome is.
The streaking Cardinal will travel to
Stockton this evening to meet UOP and
its army of fans.
The Tigers came to Maples Pavilion a
month ago and issued Stanford its worst
loss of the season. While tonight's con
test holds no conference implications for
either team, the two sides are not taking
the match lightly.
"This will be a good chance to see
how much we've improved," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said. "They don't lose
very often at home, but we're not intim
idated by anyone."
But if there ever was a team to be
intimidated by, it is probably Pacific.
UOP is 20-2 overall, 9-2 in the Big West
Conference and ranked second nation
ally. The Tigers are an excellent serving
team and are often able to take oppo
nents completely out of their offenses.
At home, UOP has been daunting. The
team has swept its opponent in seven of
eight home matches this year.
Pacific is led by first-team All-Ameri
can Krissy Fifer. Fifer was injured dur
ing the team's previous meeting and
saw limited action. The 6-foot-3 hitter
has recovered nicely, however. She is
currently hitting an other-worldly .397.
Senior Cathey Scotlan is the team
leader in kills and blocks and has a .312
hitting percentage. Scotlan played with

Stanford's Bev Oden and Kristin Klein
during the summer on the U.S. National
B Team. Earlier this season, Scotlan
had 13 kills against the Cardinal.
Despite their enormous success,
Pacific has recently relaxed its dominant
pace. In the team's last three matches,
UOP has been pushed to five games by
unranked UC-Irvine, to four games by
San Jose State and has lost to Long
Beach State.
"This shows that they're not the
machine team that they were when they
played us last time," setter Carrie Feld
man said. Nonetheless, Stanford must
be in top form if the squad is to undo the
Tigers at home.
As has been the case all season, the
Cardinal offense will likely be a con
stant. Oden is hitting .343, middle
blocker Amy Cooper is attacking with a
.363 success rate, and Klein is at .297.
Senior middle blocker Jessica Benton
has surged recently. The intimidating
blocker had back-to-back 10-kill perfor
mances over the weekend. She hit over
.380 in both affairs.
But in Stanford's earlier loss to UOR
this offensive machinery was muffled by
a lethal Pacific serve and block. "They
really rely on their block," Feldman
said. "We have to hit smart and mix up
the offense."
If the Cardinal can do that, the team
just may make some commotion in the
national scene. Another Pacific loss
would likely drop them from their lofty
ranking, affording No. 3 Hawaii and No.
4 Nebraska room to move up.
For Stanford, that opportunity would
prove even more valuable. Because No.
1 UCLA also plays in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, the two squads will likely be
placed in the same regional at playoff
time. If this occurs, only one of the
teams will advance to the Final Four.

'This will be a good
chance to see how
much we've improved.'

The only way in which this scenario
could be avoided is if Stanford and
UCLA held the top two rankings at the
end of the season. The NCAA has
decided to place No.l and No. 2 teams in
different regionals to enable both the
chance to play in the Final Four.
"Now that we have second place in
the Pac-10, why not go after the
national rankings," Feldman said.
Whether the Cardinal moves up or
not, Shaw is confident in his team's abil
ity. Stanford is 16-3 overall and 11-2 in
the Pac-10. "We've been playing pretty
well," Shaw said. "We've been doing a
good job blocking and on defense. We'll
give them a lot of problems."
The Tigers probably know where
most of those problems will come from.
Oden has been impressive all season but
has been brilliant in big matches. In
Stanford's four matches with teams
ranked in the top three, Oden has hit
.395 and averaged 27.8 kills, 11.8 digs
and 5.8 blocks. She has broken her own
career high in kills three times this year.
She had 25 against No. 7 Illinois, and 29
and 41 in the two matches against
UCLA. The middle blocker is currently
the team leader in kills, kills average,
solo blocks, block assists, and block
average.
UOP will also be looking for Klein.
The high-flying junior power hitter cur
rently has 290 kills. She leads the team
in aces with 26, digs with 247, and digs
average.

the Pac-10. "We've been playing pretty
well," Shaw said. "We've been doing a
good job blocking and on defense. We'll
give them a lot of problems."
The Tigers probably know where
most of those problems will come from.
Oden has been impressive all season but
has been brilliant in big matches. In
Stanford's four matches with teams
ranked in the top three, Oden has hit
.395 and averaged 27.8 kills, 11.8 digs
and 5.8 blocks. She has broken her own
career high in kills three times this year.
She had 25 against No. 7 Illinois, and 29
and 41 in the two matches against
UCLA. The middle blocker is currently
the team leader in kills, kills average,
solo blocks, block assists, and block
average.
UOP will also be looking for Klein.
The high-flying junior power hitter cur
rently has 290 kills. She leads the team
in aces with 26, digs with 247, and digs
average.

Kristin Klein goes up and over the block In the Cardinal's victory Saturday night.
Klein will need to fly high tonight If the fifth-ranked Cardinal hopes to top No. 2
Pacific In Stockton.
The last time Stanford and the Uni
versity of the Pacific played, the Cardi
nal probably felt like it was on the road
by the end of the match. The only fans
yelling at the conclusion of that compe
tition were orange-clad UOP alumni
who had traveled to Stanford for the
contest.
Tonght, Stanford will probably feel
like that no matter what the outcome is.
The streaking Cardinal will travel to
Stockton this evening to meet UOP and
its army of fans.
The Tigers came to Maples Pavilion a
month ago and issued Stanford its worst
loss of the season. While tonight's con
test holds no conference implications for
either team, the two sides are not taking
the match lightly.
"This will be a good chance to see
how much we've improved," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said. "They don't lose
very often at home, but we're not intim
idated by anyone."
But if there ever was a team to be
intimidated by, it is probably Pacific.
UOP is 20-2 overall, 9-2 in the Big West
Conference and ranked second nation
ally. The Tigers are an excellent serving
team and are often able to take oppo
nents completely out of their offenses.
At home, UOP has been daunting. The
team has swept its opponent in seven of
eight home matches this year.
Pacific is led by first-team All-Ameri
can Krissy Fifer. Fifer was injured dur
ing the team's previous meeting and
saw limited action. The 6-foot-3 hitter
has recovered nicely, however. She is
currently hitting an other-worldly .397.
Senior Cathey Scotlan is the team
leader in kills and blocks and has a .312
hitting percentage. Scotlan played with

Stanford's Bev Oden and Kristin Klein
during the summer on the U.S. National
B Team. Earlier this season, Scotlan
had 13 kills against the Cardinal.
Despite their enormous success,
Pacific has recently relaxed its dominant
pace. In the team's last three matches,
UOP has been pushed to five games by
unranked UC-Irvine, to four games by
San Jose State and has lost to Long
Beach State.
"This shows that they're not the
machine team that they were when they
played us last time," setter Carrie Feld
man said. Nonetheless, Stanford must
be in top form if the squad is to undo the
Tigers at home.
As has been the case all season, the
Cardinal offense will likely be a con
stant. Oden is hitting .343, middle
blocker Amy Cooper is attacking with a
.363 success rate, and Klein is at .297.
Senior middle blocker Jessica Benton
has surged recently. The intimidating
blocker had back-to-back 10-kill perfor
mances over the weekend. She hit over
.380 in both affairs.
But in Stanford's earlier loss to UOR
this offensive machinery was muffled by
a lethal Pacific serve and block. "They
really rely on their block," Feldman
said. "We have to hit smart and mix up
the offense."
If the Cardinal can do that, the team
just may make some commotion in the
national scene. Another Pacific loss
would likely drop them from their lofty
ranking, affording No. 3 Hawaii and No.
4 Nebraska room to move up.
For Stanford, that opportunity would
prove even more valuable. Because No.
1 UCLA also plays in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, the two squads will likely be
placed in the same regional at playoff
time. If this occurs, only one of the
teams will advance to the Final Four.

'This will be a good
chance to see how
much we've improved.'

The only way in which this scenario
could be avoided is if Stanford and
UCLA held the top two rankings at the
end of the season. The NCAA has
decided to place No.l and No. 2 teams in
different regionals to enable both the
chance to play in the Final Four.
"Now that we have second place in
the Pac-10, why not go after the
national rankings," Feldman said.
Whether the Cardinal moves up or
not, Shaw is confident in his team's abil
ity. Stanford is 16-3 overall and 11-2 in
the Pac-10. "We've been playing pretty
well," Shaw said. "We've been doing a
good job blocking and on defense. We'll
give them a lot of problems."
