# Keyes is leader of Card defense
## 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
He isn't flashy. He isn't
loud. He isn't a goal-scoring
machine. He isn't an attention
seeker. He is going to be
missed.
He is senior midfielder Tim
Keyes of the Stanford men's
soccer squad. Today's 2:30 p.m.
game against the University of
San Francisco will be his last
match at home. A week later,
the final game at California
will bring an end to a long and
prosperous career on the Farm.
In 1987, Keyes was only one
of two freshman to start for the
Cardinal, and he quickly made
an impression. "It was some
thing like the third game of the
season," recalled the senior.
"The coach told me that I had
to mark Tab Ramos who was a
senior and a member of the
U.S. National Team. That was
the only time I have ever been
scared to death to play."
Although Keyes was fright
ened out of his wits, he took the
ball away from Ramos the first
two times he got possession.
Ramos turned around to him
and said, "If you do that one
more time you little freshman,
I'm going to beat the hell out of
you." Keyes has started ever
since.
Ramos wasn't the only pne
to see Keyes' talent. The senior
has also made an impression on
Stanford's goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata. "When I was a recruit,
I stayed with Keyes. He really
made me feel welcome. He is a
huge reason why I am here.
And now that I'm here, he has
helped me adjust to playing at
the college level."
First-year coach Colin Lin
dores sat up and took notice of
the senior as well. "He goes
about his job in a quiet fashion,
but he still plays very well and
consistent. We have plenty of
extroverts, and we need a cou
ple more introverts like Tim.
We are going to miss him next
year."
What the Cardinal will prob
ably miss the most is Keyes'
quiet defensive skills. "I don't
play like Rhett Harty (Stan
ford's Ail-American) for exam
ple. He plays with a lot of emo
tion and goes in hard,"
explained Keyes. "He is able to
wait for the offender to get the
ball and then takes it away
with a tackle."
"If I was to do that, the
offender would run right
around me because I'm slow,"
the senior continued. "So, I
have to be thinking if I'm going
to anticipate the pass and steal
it before the other player gets
it. I can't do this if I'm yelling
all the time."

This type of defensive play
has brought Keyes very little
gloiy, but he isn't upset about
it. In fact, he volunteered for
the position four years ago. He
had played midfield for his
three-time state championship
high school team, but soon
realized that he would have to
change positions upon arrival
at Stanford.
In 1987, the Cardinal had a
big pool of talent at the mid
fielder position, and the defen
sive line was weak. "The
coaches told me that if I
wanted to play, I would have to
play defense," explained Keyes.
"When you are a freshman, you
will play anywhere. You will do
anything to break into the
lineup."
The lack of attention is actu
ally a good thing as far as
Keyes is concered. "The way I
see it, if no one notices you or
the man you are guarding, then
you have done your job."
Ex-Stanford player Conrad
Vial remembers Keyes as a
player who kept a lot of offend
ers unnoticed. "He was a very
skilled and fundamental player,
especially on defense. He could
completely mark a player right
out of the game."
By becoming one of the pre
mier defenders in the college
ranks, Keyes has lost out on a
great deal of glamour he might
have encountered as an offen
sive-minded player. His team
mates appreciate that sacrifice
to the team.
"He doesn't play for himself;
he plays for the team," said
Krpata. "When we started
doing well earlier this year, I
wanted to make the playoffs for
Tim's sake because this is his
last year with us."
Stanford's forward Jason
Vanacour chimed in,"He gets
the least amount of credit on
the team, but plays the best.
Overall, he is the most consis
tent. He is the unsung hero of
the team."

sive-minded player. His team
mates appreciate that sacrifice
to the team.
"He doesn't play for himself;
he plays for the team," said
Krpata. "When we started
doing well earlier this year, I
wanted to make the playoffs for
Tim's sake because this is his
last year with us."
Stanford's forward Jason
Vanacour chimed in,"He gets
the least amount of credit on
the team, but plays the best.
Overall, he is the most consis
tent. He is the unsung hero of
the team."


Tim Keyes
He isn't flashy. He isn't
loud. He isn't a goal-scoring
machine. He isn't an attention
seeker. He is going to be
missed.
He is senior midfielder Tim
Keyes of the Stanford men's
soccer squad. Today's 2:30 p.m.
game against the University of
San Francisco will be his last
match at home. A week later,
the final game at California
will bring an end to a long and
prosperous career on the Farm.
In 1987, Keyes was only one
of two freshman to start for the
Cardinal, and he quickly made
an impression. "It was some
thing like the third game of the
season," recalled the senior.
"The coach told me that I had
to mark Tab Ramos who was a
senior and a member of the
U.S. National Team. That was
the only time I have ever been
scared to death to play."
Although Keyes was fright
ened out of his wits, he took the
ball away from Ramos the first
two times he got possession.
Ramos turned around to him
and said, "If you do that one
more time you little freshman,
I'm going to beat the hell out of
you." Keyes has started ever
since.
Ramos wasn't the only pne
to see Keyes' talent. The senior
has also made an impression on
Stanford's goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata. "When I was a recruit,
I stayed with Keyes. He really
made me feel welcome. He is a
huge reason why I am here.
And now that I'm here, he has
helped me adjust to playing at
the college level."
First-year coach Colin Lin
dores sat up and took notice of
the senior as well. "He goes
about his job in a quiet fashion,
but he still plays very well and
consistent. We have plenty of
extroverts, and we need a cou
ple more introverts like Tim.
We are going to miss him next
year."
What the Cardinal will prob
ably miss the most is Keyes'
quiet defensive skills. "I don't
play like Rhett Harty (Stan
ford's Ail-American) for exam
ple. He plays with a lot of emo
tion and goes in hard,"
explained Keyes. "He is able to
wait for the offender to get the
ball and then takes it away
with a tackle."
"If I was to do that, the
offender would run right
around me because I'm slow,"
the senior continued. "So, I
have to be thinking if I'm going
to anticipate the pass and steal
it before the other player gets
it. I can't do this if I'm yelling
all the time."

This type of defensive play
has brought Keyes very little
gloiy, but he isn't upset about
it. In fact, he volunteered for
the position four years ago. He
had played midfield for his
three-time state championship
high school team, but soon
realized that he would have to
change positions upon arrival
at Stanford.
In 1987, the Cardinal had a
big pool of talent at the mid
fielder position, and the defen
sive line was weak. "The
coaches told me that if I
wanted to play, I would have to
play defense," explained Keyes.
"When you are a freshman, you
will play anywhere. You will do
anything to break into the
lineup."
The lack of attention is actu
ally a good thing as far as
Keyes is concered. "The way I
see it, if no one notices you or
the man you are guarding, then
you have done your job."
Ex-Stanford player Conrad
Vial remembers Keyes as a
player who kept a lot of offend
ers unnoticed. "He was a very
skilled and fundamental player,
especially on defense. He could
completely mark a player right
out of the game."
By becoming one of the pre
mier defenders in the college
ranks, Keyes has lost out on a
great deal of glamour he might
have encountered as an offen
sive-minded player. His team
mates appreciate that sacrifice
to the team.
"He doesn't play for himself;
he plays for the team," said
Krpata. "When we started
doing well earlier this year, I
wanted to make the playoffs for
Tim's sake because this is his
last year with us."
Stanford's forward Jason
Vanacour chimed in,"He gets
the least amount of credit on
the team, but plays the best.
Overall, he is the most consis
tent. He is the unsung hero of
the team."
