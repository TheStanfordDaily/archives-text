# It's a kick
## Martial-arts classes coach mind and body

Twice a week, sophomore
Cheri Sugal takes a real study
break. She drives her scooter
over to Roble Gym and hits peo
ple.
But at least she is friendly
about it. "I've never seen any
body bleeding," she said, stress
ing that she makes only light,
controlled contact.
Sugal, 19, is a member of
Stanford's JKA Shotokan
Karate Club and a five-year stu
dent of martial arts. And she is
not alone. More than 200 Stan
ford students are currently
enrolled in martial arts classes,
according to Asst. Athletics
Director Shirley Schoof.
The Athletics Department
offers credit for seven different

martial disciplines. The pro
grams include a variety of styles,
ranging from rough, competitive
Tae Kwon Do to the gentle Tai
Chi.
The heads of the programs
develop their classes according
to their individual philosophies.
Master Woo Kon Kim, leader
of Tae Kwon Do, spoke in
clipped, accented sentences
about the value of competition
and diligence. Tae Kwon Do,
now a full Olympic sport, is "a
philosophy, a way of life" full of
concentration and control, he
said.
Kim has 40 to 50 students in
his program this quarter. He
added that 40 percent of regular
attendees participate in orga
nized competition — a strikingly

high figure compared to some
other programs.
Kim suggested that Tae Kwon
Do is popular with students
because it offers self-defense skills
coupled with enhanced ability to
concentrate.
An opposite approach to self
defense is Tai Chi, described by
program head John Chuck as "a
gentle martial art" that promotes
health by boosting coordination
and flexibility and releasing
stress.
Though Tai Chi is non-compet
itive and has no belt ranks, there
are three levels of classes for stu
dents of varying expertise. Chuck
said he shows a student how to
stretch, throw a punch and main
tain balance.
Tai Chi's soft style is well
suited to students who lack a mar
tial arts background or do not
want rigor, Chuck said. In all, Tai
Chi has about 50 students this
quarter.
Aikido, another relatively mild
martial art, focuses on "dissolving
offensive energies without harm
to either party," according to
Steve Volz, a program assistant
who works for Stanford Libraries.
Aikido's founder synthesized its
St,le at the end of World War II
from traditional sword-fighting
techniques.

An elegant sport popular with
women, Aikido is "very fluid,
almost dance-like," Volz said. He
contrasted this elegance with
judo, which has a lot of wrestling
like struggle on the floor. Aikido
has more than 45 students this
quarter.
In the middle of the martial
arts spectrum, Shotokan Karate
emphasizes basic techniques but
involves optional competition.
"We teach how to punch, how to
block, how to kick" said Shotokan
co-captain David Leit, a 21-year
old senior.
Shotokan participants tend to
be competitive, Leit said, giving as
an example students who were
active athletes in high school but
do not have time for varsity sports
in college. Although Stanford does
not host any self-defense tourna
ments, many Shotokan students
participate in outside events, Leit
said.
Shotokan has about 30 regular
students and 36 beginners. Leit
said the difficulty and time
demands of the program lead to a
high attrition rate. Shotokan has
four belt colors, and achieving
black belt status takes four years
of strong participation.
Although Stanford's martial
arts programs are very popular,
there are some students who have
not been satisfied with the

classes. Jenko Hwong, a junior,
participated in a Kenpo course a
year ago. "I felt a little lost,"
Hwong said. The class was too
large and lacked personal instruc
tion, he said.
Hwong now attends an off
campus school called Shoringi
Kenpo. He said he is pleased with
the school's more serious atmo
sphere and closer instruction.
But other experienced students
support the Stanford classes.
Sugal, who has studied karate
since eighth grade at home in New
York, likes having the opportunity
to continue while she is at school.
"The more I train, the more
disciplined I am in studying, the
more on top of things I am, and
the more organized I am about my
work," she said.
Though no instructor spoke
directly against another program,
a few comments hinted at rivalry
between the disciplines. Liet
emphasized that Shotokan repre
sented a traditional Japanese
style as opposed to Kenpo's
"American style." Representatives
from other programs noted that
Tae Kwon Do's fighting style was
80 percent kicking, while their
styles were more evenly weighted.
The other martial sports avail
able for credit are Kenpo Karate
and self-defense. Stanford also
has a judo team in the club sports
program.
