# USC: University of Skipping Classes?
## 
### 
I was casually reading the paper
one morning last week — yes,
some sports writers can actu
ally read — when I came across
one of the most earth-shattering
headlines of all time.
No, it wasn't "Humphrey the
Whale Swims Out of Mud" or
"Penthouse Pet Awarded $4 Mil
lion" or "Lingerie Takes To the
Streets" (I am not making these
up; they were all in one issue of
our favorite Bay Area paper).
Instead, it was down near the bot
tom of the first sports page (yes,
the page with "The Sensitive
Buster Douglas" screaming across
the top — who writes these
things, anyway?).
There it was, for all to see:
"Marinovich Misses Classes —
Suspended."
I was heartbroken.
In case you haven't heard of
him, "Marinovich" is USC sopho
more quarterback Todd Mari
novich, who's been a media super
star ever since every single foot
ball-playing college in the country
made fools out of themselves try
ing to recruit him.
Why all the fuss? Simple: He
was trained from birth to be a
quarterback. Yes, from birth.
Daddy Marinovich has spent the
last 21 years finding experts in
nearly every football-related field
— strength, flexibility, nutrition,
passing, running — to work with
Todd. This is the boy who hasn't
ever had a Big Mac. (Well, so he
says.)

Apparently all the work has
paid off for Marinovich, for last
year he was the UPI and Sporting
News Freshman of the Year after
completing 62.2 percent of his
passes for 2,578 yards and 16
TDs. Coaches raved. Sportswrit
ers praised. Fathers everywhere
told their sons to lose the Ding-
Dongs, Doritos and Coke.
But now — oh no! — appar
ently Marinovich has gotten him
self into a wee bit of academic
trouble. As USC coach Larry
Smith announced the suspension,
he related how he'd been told a
few weeks ago that Robo-QB had
missed a class or two. Horrified
(I'm sure) as he was, Smith imme
diately made a deal with Mari
novich and his parents that any
more missed classes would lead to
a suspension of at least one game.
The deal lasted a few weeks,
until last Monday, when Smith
found out Marinovich had
neglected to rouse himself for that
11 o'clock, (Damn cheap alarm
clock!) That was it: Freshman of
the Year or no Freshman of the
Year, Smith had to uphold the aca

demic integrity of his program!
The storied USC football team
had to be a leader in the classroom
as well, and Marinovich became a
victim of Smith's commitment to
academia.
Oh, thank goodness for Coach
Smith! In an era of low SATs,
GPAs and IQs he alone has had
the courage, the integrity, to stand
up and say "Enough! Something
must be done!" At great sacrifice
to himself and the team, Smith
gave up his star quarterback for
an entire game!
Ah, thank the stars for that
leader on the gridiron and the
classroom, that shining beacon of
academia: the University of
Southern California!
Pardon me whilst I puke.
Something smelled, and it
sure wasn't the Froot Loops
I'd gagged on.
I had a feeling that there was
something else going on here, and
as I frantically looked over the
story I started to figure it out. I
was worried because I thought
there might be a slight chance
other upstanding coaches might
follow Smith's lead and start sus
pending players for missing class.
After that? Other athletes would
be required to go to every single
minute of every single class.
And then? The natural pro
gression — uh-oh — would lead to
the same requirements for the
rest of the student body. You go to
class — always — or you're sus

pended.
I was in trouble.
But wait! Right there in the
story was what I needed: The one
game suspension meant Mari
novich would miss the Trojans'
crucial matchup against ... Ari
zona State. Oh no.
Let's try to guess what place
ASU is in in the Pac-10, shall we?
No, not first. A little further
down. Hmm ... They don't seem
to be in the middle of the pack
either....
There we go! Dead last.
Dropped four in a row before the
USC game. Off to their worst
start in 40 years. (Sorry, Stanford
doesn't get to play ASU this year.
When it rains ...)
Wow, what a sacrifice Smith is
making, huh? I tell ya, not every
coach would be willing to go with
out a star player against a power
house!
What's that? Oh, it's just a
coincidence? Marinovich just hap
pened to miss class the week
before playing ASU? He would've
been suspended no matter who
they were playing?
Right.
Let's be honest here: If the
classes in question were the first
Marinovich has ever bagged on,
I'll walk from here to Pittsburgh
during winter break. Naked. And
if you believe Smith hasn't known
for the last three years that Mari
novich is to academics what Sad
