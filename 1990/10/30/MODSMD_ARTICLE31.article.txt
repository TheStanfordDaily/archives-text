# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With all the fall sports, and midterms for
that matter, into full swing last week, Cardi
nal teams were competing all up and down
the West Coast. Thus, it seems only right
that The Daily 's Athletes of the Week should
be people playing by the sea.
After finding success in Pacific Palisades,
Calif., tennis player Sandra Birch is the
female winner while Chuck Maguy of the

water polo team is the male winner for his
performance in Long Beach, Calif.
Birch, a 5-foot-6 senior from Huntington
Bay, N.Y., had the pressure squarely on her
as the defending singles champion at the
Riviera All-American Tournament.
After cruising to the championship match
she ran up against, appropriately enough,
the top-ranked player in the nation, who just
happened to be Debbie Graham, her team
mate and doubles partner. Graham defeated
Birch in the NCAA singles semifinal last
year and looked ready to repeat her perfor
mance when she took a 5-3 lead in the third
set.
But Birch won 16 of the last 20 points in
the match to pull out the victory. A short
time later she and Graham took the court
for the doubles final.
The Stanford duo, the NCAA runners-up
in both 1989 and 1990, cruised to an easy
straight-set win.

Maguy, a 6-3 senior from Visalia, Calif.,
has been a force for the Cardinal water polo
team ever since arriving here.
Stanford opened the weekend with an
easy 11-7 win over No. 15 UC-San Diego.
Saturday Stanford opened the tournament
with a 19-2 thrashing of UC-Riverside.
Then, Saturday night, Maguy scored two
early goals to help the Cardinal open a 4-0
lead against No. 6 USC.
The Trojans twice narrowed it to one but
ended up falling 14-8 to the mighty Cardi

nal. Sunday morning Maguy was sick but
that wasn't going to stop him against No. 3
UCLA, a team Stanford had defeated in five
overtimes the week before. The Cardinal
trailed 5-3 in the early going but Maguy tied
it up at five with a goal.
The teams continued to battle on even
terms until Maguy scored near the end of
the first overtime period, giving the Cardi
nal its second OT victory over the Bruins.
