# Soccer seeded third in West
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Cinderella Stanford has finally
been invited to the ball, now all
she has to do is dance.
The seventh-ranked women's
soccer team received its first-ever
invitation to the 12-team NCAA
tournament yesterday. But Stan
ford's trip to the national champi
onship will be no easy waltz. The
Cardinal will be dancing a danger
ous polka every step of the way.
Fourth-ranked UC-Santa Bar
bara will be the first partner try
ing to trip Stanford up. The Gau
chos (13-1-1) host Stanford this
weekend in a first-round contest.
The game was originally sched
uled for Saturday night at 7:30,
but may be changed to Saturday
afternoon or Sunday. Stanford
was expecting to play Nov. 10, but
due to scheduling miscommunica
tion with the NCAA, now must
prepare for the Gauchos in four
days.
The winner will play at No. 1
Santa Clara (17-0-1) Nov. 10 or
11. The Broncos, along with Vir
ginia, North Carolina and Wiscon
sin, have a first-round bye.
"That's what we've worked for,
to make the playoffs and then
have a shot at the national cham
pionship. We have our chance,
now we have to make use of it,"
said fourth-year Stanford coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
"We are definitely the dark
horse," he continued. "We lost to
Santa Barbara and Santa Clara
and those are the only two losses
we have. If we are going to the
championships, we have to beat
some excellent teams."
Stanford, which had a record of
2-2-1 against other tournament
teams, lost its only games of the
year to its first two potential oppo
nents in the tournament. Stan

ford lost 1-0 to Santa Barbara
Sept. 15 in the third game of Stan
ford's longest road trip of the sea
son. Sept. 29 the Cardinal fell 2-1
at home to the top-ranked Bron
cos.
In the month of October Stan
ford has allowed only four goals
while racing to an 8-0-1 record
and its much-anticipated tourna
ment invitation. Stanford has
shut out its last four opponents
and is confident that November
will bring even better fortune.
"The team has a serious
chance," said Andeberhan. "We
are not cocky, but we have a very
serious and sober confidence. The
implication is we want to work for
it."
When Stanford last played at
Santa Barbara, classes hadn't
started at either school and Stan
ford was an untested 5-0. But now
the Cardinal has defeated three
top-20 teams in succession and
looked playoff-ready in a 5-0
thrashing of the University of San
Francisco.
"When we played them last
time I think people were really
tired," said sophomore midfielder
Julie Foudy. "It was the end of a
road trip and I know I was
fatigued. But this time we have no
excuses. We're going to be fired up
and we are going to go down there
and win. That's all we have to
worry about."
If Stanford manages to get by
Santa Barbara, the ride will be
shorter but no easier in the second
round. Santa Clara had to come
from behind to defeat Stanford at
Maloney Field and the Cardinal
would love another shot at its
peninsula rivals. The Broncos
haven't lost all year and defeated
Santa Barbara 1-0.
Stanford, the No. 3 seed in the
West, may have the toughest draw
in the tournament. Andeberhan

thought Santa Barbara deserved a
first-round bye as one of the top
four teams. But instead the other
three seedings went to North Car
olina, Virginia and Wisconsin,
which tied Santa Barbara 1-1
Sept. 29.
North Carolina, a perennial
final four participant, has the eas
iest path in the early rounds. The
Tar Heels host the winner of the
North Carolina State-William and
Mary game, two teams that Stan
ford defeated in the late-season.
William and Mary is the only team
from the weak Northeast region,
and N.C. State was crushed twice
at home in its final games of the
year.
Virginia, which was top-ranked
at one time before losing to North
Carolina, is the strongest club in
its bracket and plays the Hart
ford-Connecticut winner.
Wisconsin will host the winner
of a first-round Southern
Methodist-Colorado College
match. SMU was ranked No. 17
only two weeks ago, but snuck
into the playoffs by hammering
N.C. State 4-0 and beating Duke.
The four seeded teams will host
second-round games Nov. 10 and
11, while the final four location
has yet to be determined. The
national semifinals and champi
onship game will be played at one
of the participating schools, with
team strength, field condition,
weather, geography and drawing
power all considered.
»If Stanford is to advance in the
tournament, it will have to beat a
progressively better team in each
game and play its best soccer of
the season. But the team is confi
dent this will happen.
"We have continued to improve
as a team," said Andeberhan. "I
actually feel we haven't peaked
yet."

N.C. State 4-0 and beating Duke.
The four seeded teams will host
second-round games Nov. 10 and
11, while the final four location
has yet to be determined. The
national semifinals and champi
onship game will be played at one
of the participating schools, with
team strength, field condition,
weather, geography and drawing
power all considered.
»If Stanford is to advance in the
tournament, it will have to beat a
progressively better team in each
game and play its best soccer of
the season. But the team is confi
dent this will happen.
"We have continued to improve
as a team," said Andeberhan. "I
actually feel we haven't peaked
yet."
Cinderella Stanford has finally
been invited to the ball, now all
she has to do is dance.
The seventh-ranked women's
soccer team received its first-ever
invitation to the 12-team NCAA
tournament yesterday. But Stan
ford's trip to the national champi
onship will be no easy waltz. The
Cardinal will be dancing a danger
ous polka every step of the way.
Fourth-ranked UC-Santa Bar
bara will be the first partner try
ing to trip Stanford up. The Gau
chos (13-1-1) host Stanford this
weekend in a first-round contest.
The game was originally sched
uled for Saturday night at 7:30,
but may be changed to Saturday
afternoon or Sunday. Stanford
was expecting to play Nov. 10, but
due to scheduling miscommunica
tion with the NCAA, now must
prepare for the Gauchos in four
days.
The winner will play at No. 1
Santa Clara (17-0-1) Nov. 10 or
11. The Broncos, along with Vir
ginia, North Carolina and Wiscon
sin, have a first-round bye.
"That's what we've worked for,
to make the playoffs and then
have a shot at the national cham
pionship. We have our chance,
now we have to make use of it,"
said fourth-year Stanford coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
"We are definitely the dark
horse," he continued. "We lost to
Santa Barbara and Santa Clara
and those are the only two losses
we have. If we are going to the
championships, we have to beat
some excellent teams."
Stanford, which had a record of
2-2-1 against other tournament
teams, lost its only games of the
year to its first two potential oppo
nents in the tournament. Stan

ford lost 1-0 to Santa Barbara
Sept. 15 in the third game of Stan
ford's longest road trip of the sea
son. Sept. 29 the Cardinal fell 2-1
at home to the top-ranked Bron
cos.
In the month of October Stan
ford has allowed only four goals
while racing to an 8-0-1 record
and its much-anticipated tourna
ment invitation. Stanford has
shut out its last four opponents
and is confident that November
will bring even better fortune.
"The team has a serious
chance," said Andeberhan. "We
are not cocky, but we have a very
serious and sober confidence. The
implication is we want to work for
it."
When Stanford last played at
Santa Barbara, classes hadn't
started at either school and Stan
ford was an untested 5-0. But now
the Cardinal has defeated three
top-20 teams in succession and
looked playoff-ready in a 5-0
thrashing of the University of San
Francisco.
"When we played them last
time I think people were really
tired," said sophomore midfielder
Julie Foudy. "It was the end of a
road trip and I know I was
fatigued. But this time we have no
excuses. We're going to be fired up
and we are going to go down there
and win. That's all we have to
worry about."
If Stanford manages to get by
Santa Barbara, the ride will be
shorter but no easier in the second
round. Santa Clara had to come
from behind to defeat Stanford at
Maloney Field and the Cardinal
would love another shot at its
peninsula rivals. The Broncos
haven't lost all year and defeated
Santa Barbara 1-0.
Stanford, the No. 3 seed in the
West, may have the toughest draw
in the tournament. Andeberhan

thought Santa Barbara deserved a
first-round bye as one of the top
four teams. But instead the other
three seedings went to North Car
olina, Virginia and Wisconsin,
which tied Santa Barbara 1-1
Sept. 29.
North Carolina, a perennial
final four participant, has the eas
iest path in the early rounds. The
Tar Heels host the winner of the
North Carolina State-William and
Mary game, two teams that Stan
ford defeated in the late-season.
William and Mary is the only team
from the weak Northeast region,
and N.C. State was crushed twice
at home in its final games of the
year.
Virginia, which was top-ranked
at one time before losing to North
Carolina, is the strongest club in
its bracket and plays the Hart
ford-Connecticut winner.
Wisconsin will host the winner
of a first-round Southern
Methodist-Colorado College
match. SMU was ranked No. 17
only two weeks ago, but snuck
into the playoffs by hammering
N.C. State 4-0 and beating Duke.
