Big Game 1906: the rivalry
between Stanford and Califor
nia begins. But the setting isn't
what one would expect. There
isn't a football player in sight.
The two teams pitted against
one another are the Stanford
and Cal rugby teams.
Stanford rugby was estab
lished in 1896 and is the Univer
sity's longest-standing sport. In
the 1924 Olympic Games, the
United States won the gold
medal and all points scored for
the U.S. were scored by Stan
ford students. The Cardinal (or
Indian) has claimed more
national rugby championships
than any other American
school. Today the Stanford
team, of approximately 80 play
ers, has set its sights on adding
another championship to Stan
ford's record.
The team placed sixth in the

nation last year, and third in the
Pacific Coast Rugby Federation
Union. In the conference of
about 200 schools, Stanford lost
only to Cal and Long Beach
State.
"We should be an even better
team this year," club president
Simon Fleming-Wood said. "Our
goal is to win the Pacific Coast
Championship and to go on to
the Final Four from there."
Fleming-Wood is the only
returning 1989-1990 All-Con
ference player.
This past summer, Stanford
sent a team of 30 players to Aus
tralia for a tour against five
Aussie universities.
Most of the top players are
returning this year and the
team will travel to Tucson, Ariz,
this weekend for the pre-season
tournament opener at Arizona.
The team, coached by Franck
"Greenwood" Boivert, has been
practicing since the start of
school and anticipates an excit-

ing season.
Boivert is a world-renowned
rugby coach and began coaching
Stanford last year.
"We made a dramatic
improvement last year," Flem
ing-Wood said. "We are a much
better team. We are very lucky
to have Boivert as our coach."
Boivert came to this school to
help rugby become a part of
Stanford's excellent athletic
program.
"It's a great school with seri
ous rugby." Boivert said. "Our
task here is to build a rugby pro
gram at the level of excellence of
any other school. A national
championship is a reasonable
goal." Stevens agrees.
"We are a national champion
competitor this year." Stevens
said. "The team is looking fit
and things are looking well for
the season. We're really strong
and to win this year isn't just a
hope, it's a real thing."
