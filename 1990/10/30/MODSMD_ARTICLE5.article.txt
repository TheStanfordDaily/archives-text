If all goes as planned, the Kappa Alpha frater
nity's one-month probation will be lifted this week at
the latest, according to KA President Matt Hansen.
Hansen said he was supposed to hear the verdict
from Program and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Ramsey-Perez yesterday However, due to illness,
Ramsey-Perez was not available yesterday to relay
the University's decision on the matter.
Hansen said Ramsey-Perez told him last week
that, although the KAs were expected to be taken off
probation, an official decision would have to be

reached with Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson in order to officially confirm the fraternity's
removal from probation.
The University imposed the probation, which
began Sept. 26, for unruly behavior by fraternity
members last spring during a formal at Harrah's
Resort in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
Harrah's officials sent a letter to Stanford alleg
ing that the KAs had posed as alumni and pretended
to be over the legal drinking age. The letter also com
plained that members had destroyed tablecloths and
disrupted the resort.
student needs.
If the test were broadened with
an essay, he said, high schools
would have students practice
writing skills in preparation for
the test. In addition, stressing
open-ended math questions in
classrooms would emphasize the
use of reason.
According to Haertel, the main
reasons for the changes are to
emphasize things that are impor
tant to learn. "The SAT goes far
beyond darkening little circles,"
he said.

Modifications in the test will
be small and "carefully scruti
nized," according to Haertel.
The College Board is currently
developing achievement tests in
Chinese and Japanese along with
the language tests that are sched
uled to arrive in 1993, when a
newly formatted SAT might be
administered.
Foreign language tests could
be used to counteract disadvan
tages a non-English speaker
would face, according to the Col
lege Board.
The testing agency has admin
istered the current test for 64
years. It is now the most widely
used college entrance exam.
