If all goes as planned, the Kappa Alpha frater
nity's one-month probation will be lifted this week at
the latest, according to KA President Matt Hansen.
Hansen said he was supposed to hear the verdict
from Program and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Ramsey-Perez yesterday However, due to illness,
Ramsey-Perez was not available yesterday to relay
the University's decision on the matter.
Hansen said Ramsey-Perez told him last week
that, although the KAs were expected to be taken off
probation, an official decision would have to be

reached with Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson in order to officially confirm the fraternity's
removal from probation.
The University imposed the probation, which
began Sept. 26, for unruly behavior by fraternity
members last spring during a formal at Harrah's
Resort in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
Harrah's officials sent a letter to Stanford alleg
ing that the KAs had posed as alumni and pretended
to be over the legal drinking age. The letter also com
plained that members had destroyed tablecloths and
disrupted the resort.
