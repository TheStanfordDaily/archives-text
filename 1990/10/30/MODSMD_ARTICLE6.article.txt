# Another tense meeting:
## Roles of gays in religion debated 
### Kaarin Michaelsen Staff writer 
Heated discussion between rep
resentatives of several reli
gions and members of the gay, les
bian and bisexual community
broke out at last night's forum on
"Sexuality, Religion and Ethnic
ity," held in the Cottage Room in
Escondido Village.
Rev. Robert Gregg, dean of the
Chapel, moderated the event,

which featured a panel of speakers
representing Judaism, Christian
ity, Islam and Buddhism. The
speakers gave short summaries of
what they discerned to be the pre
vailing attitudes toward homosex
uality in their religions.
Gregg then opened the floor to
general discussion, with the warn
ing that he was going to "take a
hard-nosed view" toward his role
as moderator to prevent "what
happened last week from happen

ing again."
Last week's forum on "Gay,
Lesbian, Straight and Bi: All Part
of the Stanford Mix," the first pro
gram of a three-part series,
erupted into a shouting match
between members of the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community and
several audience members who
identified themselves as conserva
tives.
Last night's forum was more
restrained, however. Much of the
debate focused on audience reac
tion to the remarks of Aladdin
Nassar, a graduate student in civil
engineering, who lives in Escon
dido Village.
Nassar spoke on Islam's views
toward homosexuality, and
angered many audience members
by saying Islam holds that homo
sexuals should be "killed wher
ever we find them." He later
explained that he would not follow
through on this conviction while

in a non-Islamic country.
Nassar's remarks prompted
several students to mention that
they felt "endangered" and afraid
to be living in an environment
that includes individuals with
such a degree of intolerance for
same-sex couples.
Some audience members also
expressed their perception that
the homosexual community was
not adequately represented
among the panel members. Only
one of the five panelists, graduate
student Charles Goldman, is
openly gay.
Several other students
expressed a wish for more chances
to exchange views with their
neighbors about various lifestyles

found in the Escondido Village
community.
Jean Kim, director of graduate
residences and one of the propo
nents of the new domestic part
ners policy, said this would be
taken into consideration and new
forums would be planned.
The event was the second in a
three-part series entitled "Living
Differently â€” Living Together:
Domestic Styles in Escondido Vil
lage," and was co-sponsored by
Lutheran Campus Ministries,
Memorial Church, the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center and Escondido Village.
Next Monday's forum, the last of
the series, will focus on "Domestic
Partners."
