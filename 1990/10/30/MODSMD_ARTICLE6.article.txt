# Another tense meeting:
## Roles of gays in religion debated 
### Kaarin Michaelsen Staff writer 
Heated discussion between rep
resentatives of several reli
gions and members of the gay, les
bian and bisexual community
broke out at last night's forum on
"Sexuality, Religion and Ethnic
ity," held in the Cottage Room in
Escondido Village.
Rev. Robert Gregg, dean of the
Chapel, moderated the event,

which featured a panel of speakers
representing Judaism, Christian
ity, Islam and Buddhism. The
speakers gave short summaries of
what they discerned to be the pre
vailing attitudes toward homosex
uality in their religions.
Gregg then opened the floor to
general discussion, with the warn
ing that he was going to "take a
hard-nosed view" toward his role
as moderator to prevent "what
happened last week from happen

ing again."
Last week's forum on "Gay,
Lesbian, Straight and Bi: All Part
of the Stanford Mix," the first pro
gram of a three-part series,
erupted into a shouting match
between members of the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community and
several audience members who
identified themselves as conserva
tives.
