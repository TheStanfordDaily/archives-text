Berkeley violence overrated
Despite a rash of recent incidents including a
fraternity fire, bomb scare and hostage crisis, a
recent survey of U.S. colleges did not rank UC-
Berkeley as one of the nation's most violent cam
puses.
A USA Today report encompassing 87 percent
of the nation's four-year colleges ranked UC-
Berkeley 52nd on the list, with 215.5 students per
violent crime. University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff
topped the list with 51.7 students per violent
crime.
However, a separate study by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation found the number of vio
lent crimes at UC-Berkeley second only to that of
Michigan State University.
The study, which stated that 55 violent crimes
were committed at UC-Berkeley last year, only
surveyed 20 percent of the nation's four-year col
leges.
Ray Colvig, a UC-Berkeley spokesperson, said
the FBI statistics were biased because the figures
were self-reported by institutions.

Cheating increases at Rutgers
One-third of students in a Rutgers University
anthropology class admitted to "hard-core cheat
ing," meaning cheating in eight or more courses
in college.
Only about 20 percent of students said they
had never cheated, according to a study by
Michael Moffatt, associate professor of anthropol
ogy. Moffatt surveyed about 200 students and
asked them to write about cheating. All informa

tion was given anonymously.
While the study was confined to Rutgers, Mof
fatt argues that cheating is on the rise nation
wide. He has also written a book on the subject.
One of the students said other students cheat
to "get back" at the University for offering 600-
student classes taught by teaching assistants who
cannot speak English well.

Ex-Oregon pledge sues fraternity
A former Oregon State University student filed
a lawsuit against the Beta Theta Pi fraternity for
abusive and inhumane treatment during hazing
incidents in 1988.
The former student, Brian Mclrvin, claimed he
was knocked unconscious and suffered a convul
sive seizure after he and fellow pledges were
locked in a sleeping porch and forced to consume
a keg of beer.
Mclrvin said he and other pledges were also
had to wear gunny sacks soaked with urine,
ammonia and saliva during initiation, take baths
in ice water and engage in calisthenics while fra
ternity members threw eggs at them.
Bill Brennan, assistant dean of students and
adviser to the Interfraternity Council, said a let
ter Mclrvin wrote a year ago about the incidents
made no mention of hazing other than a scuffle.
The suit is for $1,399.12 to cover medical bills.
