# Band banned for Saturday
## One-game suspension imposed; Big Game fate uncertain 
### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
The Stanford Band was suspended
yesterday for at least one game because
of its half-time performance during the
Oct. 27 football game at the University
of Oregon.
The suspension by the Department of
Athletics will be in effect through Nov.
3, when Stanford plays its last home
game this season against Washington
State University. The reprimand was
prompted by a half-time show that Ore
gon fans booed and found offensive.
The band will be reinstated for the
football game at the University of Ari
zona on Nov. 10 and for Big Game
against UC-Berkeley on Nov. 17 if the
Athletics Department approves plans
for those performances.
The Band's half-time show parodied

the endangered spotted owl and "dis
played an insensitivity and disrespect to
the Oregon community," according to
Acting Athletics Director Alan Cum
mings.
The reaction of the crowd and the
complaints following the game led Cum
mings to his decision. "The Athletics
Department will not be embarrassed
again by the Band," he said.
Band members spelled out the names
"Owl" and "AWOLT in its satire of the
spotted owl controversy, which is at the
center of a highly-sensitive political bat
tle over timber cutting in the North
west. The crowd had been booing the
Band from the beginning of their rou
tine and was further incited by the par
ody.
At one point during the performance,
amid a chorus of disapproval from the
crowd, the band announcer said, "Mr.

Spotted Owl! Mr. Spotted Owl! Your
environment has been destroyed, your
home is now a roll of Brawny, and your
family has flown the coop. What are
[you] going to do? Me, I'm goin' to Dis
neyland."
Band manager LindaKay Brown
described the crowd as "offensive and
abusive."
"As soon as we entered the stadium
we had people yelling at us, 'Stanford go
home.' The fans were not welcoming us
with open arms," Brown said.
"We were surprised by the response
because our show was in line with our
other political satire," she added.
Cummings announced the decision
yesterday after a 90-minute meeting,
which included Brown and band advisor
and Music Prof. Arthur Barnes.
