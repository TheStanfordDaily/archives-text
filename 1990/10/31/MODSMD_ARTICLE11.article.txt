deer with eight-point antlers gored and tram
pled to death a man walking along a rural road,
authorities said.
It was the second buck attack in Texas in
four days.
Charlie Jackson Coleman, 61, was attacked
Monday by the buck, which was still standing
over the body hours later when alerted sher

shot the buck when it charged them.
"It was the most unbelievable thing I've
ever seen," Burleson County Chief Deputy
Tom Randall said. "It was more of a massacre
than an attack."
On Friday, a buck charged three surveyors
near Beaumont, pitching one of them 20 feet
into a creek. One of the men said he wrestled
the deer to the ground and his partner slit the
buck's throat with a machete.
