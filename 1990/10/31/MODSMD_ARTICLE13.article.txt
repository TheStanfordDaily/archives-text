REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) - Ramon Salcido
was convicted of seven counts of murder yesterday
for the string of bloody wine-country slayings that
claimed the lives of his wife, two young daughters,
three in-laws and his boss.
Salcido sat poker-faced, showing no expression as
the verdicts — six counts of first-degree murder and
one count of second-degree murder — were read.
"What this means for the families is perhaps one
chapter of this horrible nightmare will be laid to

rest," said Sonoma County prosecutor Peter
Bumerts after the verdicts were read.
"I can't say I was delighted by it, but I wasn't
shocked," said Salcido's attorney, Public Defender
Marteen Miller, who said that, to him, the crime still
"bespeaks madness"
The 29-year-old former winery worker could be
sentenced to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin
Prison when the jury of eight women and four men
return for the trial's penalty phase on Nov. 6.
