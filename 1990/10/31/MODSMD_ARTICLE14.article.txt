# Tunnel project comes together

CALAIS, France (AP) — Britain and France were
linked beneath the English Channel yesterday when
workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves
of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.
Management sources at TransManche Link, the
construction consortium building the "Chunnel" —
the Channel Tunnel — confirmed the historic linkup
occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent
the probe through to French colleagues.
"It is an example of what Europe is about,"
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in
London. "This is Europe in practice."
The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802,
who thought he could defeat the English by connect
ing Britain to Europe with a land passage. The
Chunnel is scheduled for completion in June 1993.
"This is a hugely historic moment because it
means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island,"
said a construction union official.
Six workers suffered injuries, two seriously, about
90 minutes later when a tractor towing supplies
rolled over on them in a service gallery, authorities in
nearby Sangatte reported.
The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to
enable passengers to travel between London and
Paris in about three hours. That time is comparable
to flying, if transport to and from airports is includ
ed, and is half the time of a car-ferry journey.
The cost of the project has soared from an initial
estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an
extra $1.97 billion for unforeseen cost overruns.
The threading of the probes through 100 yards of
chalk under the English Channel marks a major
turning point in three years of drilling on the world's
costliest tunnel.
French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned
their British counterparts and relayed the news to
TransManche officials. The first champagne corks
popped minutes later.
"It's an exciting moment. It's the first time we
have air passing between the two tunnels," said
Gordon Crighton, tunnel engineering manager.
