# GNP grew unexpectedly last quarter
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
U.S. economy grew at a faster
than-expected 1.8 percent rate in
the third quarter, the government
said yesterday, but the report
failed to dissuade many analysts
who believe the economy is enter
ing a recession.
The Commerce Department
report on the gross national prod
uct showed that consumers buy
ing cars and other items had con
tinued to drive the longest peace
time economic expansion in U.S.
history through September.
Whether the expansion reaches its
eighth anniversary in November
was a matter of debate.
"This release contradicts those
who believe we are in a recession
or are about to enter one," Com
merce Undersecretary Michael R.
Darby told reporters. His boss,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mos
bacher, added in San Antonio, "I
hope all the doom-sayers and nay
sayers and cluck-cluckers go back
in their holes for a while."
But economist Bruce Steinberg
of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
in New York said, "I believe we're
in a recession. I think that most of
the things showing strength in
the third quarter will be weak in
the fourth, particularly consumer
spending."

economist for the Northern Trust

Co. in Chicago, also believes the
economy is declining this quarter.
He contended that much of the
GNP strength "was concentrated
early in the quarter. It is by no
means certain that it was growing
1.8 when the quarter ended."
Indeed, Michael Boskin, chair
man of Bush's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers, said, "While this
is pleasant news about the third
quarter, we are concerned about a
sluggish fourth quarter and the
early part of 1991."
He added that he "was cer
tainly pleased" with the Federal
Reserve's action Monday in push
ing down a key short-term inter
est rate, a move that might be
expected to boost economic
growth.
The Commerce Department
had continued bad news about the
housing industry yesterday. It
reported that sales of new homes
slumped 6 percent in September,
the ninth decline in the past 12
months and the worst drop in half

a year.
Declining home sales suggest
continued contraction in the
industry since builders often put
off new projects when inventories
climb.
The gross national product
report will be revised twice in the
next two months as more infor
mation is received. The final revi
sion of the second-quarter GNP
showed the economy grew just 0.4
percent rather than the 1.2 per
cent first reported.
Consumer spending — two
thirds of the nation's economic
activity — jumped 3.6 percent in
the third quarter compared to a
0.2 percent gain in the second.
Much of the advance was due to a
$3.4 billion increase in automobile
sales, which had declined $6.1 bil
lion from April through June.
For all of 1990, the consensus
forecast of the Blue Chip
economists calls for growth of 1.0
percent, just above the adminis
tration forecast of 0.7 percent.
The economy grew 2.5 percent
last year, slowing from a 4.5 per
cent pace in 1988.
Total the broadest mea
sure of the nation's economic
activity, reached an annual rate of
$4.17 trillion in the third quarter
when adjusted for inflation. That
was a gain of $18.5 billion over the
second quarter.
