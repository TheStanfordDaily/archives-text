## We don't get it 
### 
Conflicting reports have
left us in the dark,
wondering,' Why Tours?'

ONE WOULD HOPE THAT
the decision to close the
Stanford Program in Tours,
France, is based on sound reason
ing.
After all, when students at the
various overseas campuses turned
in evaluations of their experiences,
Tours received the highest marks.
But the University has been less
than straightforward in its expla
nation of why the Tours program is
being scrapped in favor of a two
tiered program in Paris.
Consider the progress of Univer
sity statements since this past
April when the subject of closing
the program in Tours was first
debated.
On April 16 of this year, The
Daily reported that the Overseas
Studies Program recommended
the Tours campus be closed "in
response to University budget
cuts."
On May 3, The Daily reported
Overseas Studies had made three
suggestions for reducing its overall
budget, one of which was the clos
ing of the Tours program. In addi
tion, Thomas Heller, the director of
Overseas Studies, said eliminating
Tours would "free up money to bol
ster existing programs."
Already, the question should
have been asked, "Why Tours?"
Instead, the inevitable occurred.
Complaints from alumni of the
program notwithstanding, the
University officially decided to end
the Tours program earlier this
month.
Ewart Thomas, dean of Human
ities and Sciences, said "Closing
the Tours campus would free up

money to be allocated elsewhere."
In other words, so far as stu
dents here have been told, the deci
sion to close the program is a finan
cial one. Money is the issue.
But why free up money by clos
ing the most popular of the over
seas programs? Especially consid
ering that the University could
have saved $160,000 annually by
jointly operating the Tours center
with Carnegie Mellon University.
That just doesn't make sense.
Unless, of course, money is not the
issue.
The Daily reported just last
Thursday that in fact the people
currently at Tours have received a
different explanation than have
those of us here.
In a fax to the Tours campus,
Overseas Studies explained, "The
choice to close Tours ... is a choice
that is made in the larger context
of decisions about where Stanford
should be sending students to
study."
If you find yourself confused,
you're not alone.
The University needs to decide
where it stands and then clearly
and confidently explain its decision
to the Stanford community.
Is the decision financial or aca
demic? If it's academic, what are
the details of the "larger context?"
If it's financial, why is the closing
of a program the only means of
fund-raising?
What about the possibility of
ninning the Tours program in con
junction with Carnegie-Mellon?
Why is Paris better than Tours?
Does the closing of Tours suggest
an overall trend to mtgor urban
centers and away from small pock
ets of culture like Tours?
All these questions demand
answers. And until the University
confronts these issues, it is impos
sible for the Stanford community
to support the University's deci
sion.
