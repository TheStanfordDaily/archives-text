# Admissions vacancy creates anxiety
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
When Charlene Aguilar left her job as
assistant director of admissions to
accept a higher position in another
department, many in the Chicano/
Latino community felt they had lost
their strongest advocate in the Office of
Admissions, as Aguilar's position
focused on admitting Chicano and
Latino students.
More than 70 members of the com
munity expressed their concern over the
vacancy at a meeting last night with
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter in El Centro Chicano.
Fetter said she sympathized with the
community. "Nobody could be more dis
appointed than I am about how this
turned out," Fetter said.
After an extensive search which pro
duced three finalists, Fetter decided not
to hire any of them because she said she
didn't believe they were qualified
enough for the position.
Aguilar is now assistant director for
the Center for Chicano Research at
Stanford. She accepted her new position
in the first week of August. Her last day
in the Admissions Office was Sept. 14.

Responding to members of the audi
ence who expressed fears that Chi
cano/Latino admissions would drop,
Fetter stressed she had confidence in
the deans who have final say over who
gets accepted.
She emphasized that the high per
centage of Chicanos and Latinos "won't
go away overnight" and that the
vacancy will be temporary.
Almost 10 percent of this year's
freshman class is defined as Chicano/
Latino, according to Admissions Office
figures.
Fetter said each student application
is read by three people. Aguilar read
each Chicano/Latino application but did
not have the final word on them.
The third reader has the authority to
accept a student. The third readers
include Fetter, Asst. Dean Marie
Mookini and Assoc. Deans John Bunnell
and William Tingley in the Admissions
Office.
When Fetter learned of Aguilar's
promotion, she advertised the job
throughout the Bay Area for four
weeks. Fetter said she notified every
Mexican-American staff and faculty
member of the open position, and also
asked them for other nominations.

Applicants had to be bilingual.
Responding to a question from the
audience, Fetter said Mexican-Ameri
cans and not Latinos were sought for
the job because Stanford has a 21-year
old admissions policy targeting Mexi
can-American and Chicano applicants.
Fetter said she chose not to advertise
the position nationally because a nation
wide search can take as long as six
months. She added she thought there
would be a strong pool of applicants in
the area.
The Admissions Office received 50
applications, six of whom were Mexican-
Americans. Admissions officers inter
viewed these six and chose three as
finalists.
After students requested input in the
decision, Fetter allowed four students
and one staff member to form an advi
sory group. The group was coordinated
by senior Mike Canul, the administrator
of Project Motivation, an outreach pro
gram that targets Chicano/Latino high
school students and encourages them to
go to college.
Other group members included Pro
ject Motivation members Arcy Hernan-
