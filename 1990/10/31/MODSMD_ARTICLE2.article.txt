# Admissions vacancy creates anxiety
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
When Charlene Aguilar left her job as
assistant director of admissions to
accept a higher position in another
department, many in the Chicano/
Latino community felt they had lost
their strongest advocate in the Office of
Admissions, as Aguilar's position
focused on admitting Chicano and
Latino students.
More than 70 members of the com
munity expressed their concern over the
vacancy at a meeting last night with
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter in El Centro Chicano.
Fetter said she sympathized with the
community. "Nobody could be more dis
appointed than I am about how this
turned out," Fetter said.
After an extensive search which pro
duced three finalists, Fetter decided not
to hire any of them because she said she
didn't believe they were qualified
enough for the position.
Aguilar is now assistant director for
the Center for Chicano Research at
Stanford. She accepted her new position
in the first week of August. Her last day
in the Admissions Office was Sept. 14.

Responding to members of the audi
ence who expressed fears that Chi
cano/Latino admissions would drop,
Fetter stressed she had confidence in
the deans who have final say over who
gets accepted.
She emphasized that the high per
centage of Chicanos and Latinos "won't
go away overnight" and that the
vacancy will be temporary.
Almost 10 percent of this year's
freshman class is defined as Chicano/
Latino, according to Admissions Office
figures.
Fetter said each student application
is read by three people. Aguilar read
each Chicano/Latino application but did
not have the final word on them.
The third reader has the authority to
accept a student. The third readers
include Fetter, Asst. Dean Marie
Mookini and Assoc. Deans John Bunnell
and William Tingley in the Admissions
Office.
When Fetter learned of Aguilar's
promotion, she advertised the job
throughout the Bay Area for four
weeks. Fetter said she notified every
Mexican-American staff and faculty
member of the open position, and also
asked them for other nominations.

Applicants had to be bilingual.
Responding to a question from the
audience, Fetter said Mexican-Ameri
cans and not Latinos were sought for
the job because Stanford has a 21-year
old admissions policy targeting Mexi
can-American and Chicano applicants.
Fetter said she chose not to advertise
the position nationally because a nation
wide search can take as long as six
months. She added she thought there
would be a strong pool of applicants in
the area.
The Admissions Office received 50
applications, six of whom were Mexican-
Americans. Admissions officers inter
viewed these six and chose three as
finalists.
After students requested input in the
decision, Fetter allowed four students
and one staff member to form an advi
sory group. The group was coordinated
by senior Mike Canul, the administrator
of Project Motivation, an outreach pro
gram that targets Chicano/Latino high
school students and encourages them to
go to college.
Other group members included Pro
ject Motivation members Arcy Hernan-
dez and Miguel Canales, Casa
Zapata resident assistant Anita
De Lucio and Frances Morales,
director of El Centro Chicano.
The group met with each of the
finalists for an hour. De Lucio and
Hernandez then presented a
write-up of the group's opinions
to Fetter. De Lucio said the group
came to a consensus on one candi
date but said they did not want to
reveal who it was.
Morales said she liked the can
didates and thought they "had
sensitivity to the diversity of the
community."
But through a misunderstand
ing, Fetter received the group's

write-up after she made her deci
sion. Though she did consider the
group's input, she said her deci
sion wouldn't have been different
if she had received the letter ear
lier.
Even so, Hernandez con
tended, "I didn't feel we had a
say-so" in the decision.
Fetter said she has decided to
reopen the search on a national
level in April 1991, after accep
tance letters are mailed.
In the interim, Morales will
oversee Project Motivation's Chi
cano/Latino Prospective Fresh
man weekend and will coordinate
admissions-related community
activities â€” both of which were
previously handled by Aguilar.
Before the reading period
begins, the Admissions Office will
hire a part- or full-time reader to

cover Aguilar's reading duties.
However, many audience mem
bers said they were worried the
office could not reach out to the
community effectively without
Aguilar.
Fetter said much of the ethnic
recruiting has already been done.
Each year the office sends out
15,000 letters to minorities invit
ing them to apply, she said. She
emphasized that "affirmative
action responsibilities are shared
responsibilities" among the entire
office.
Audience members also said
they thought a temporary reader
would not be an advocate for the
Chicano/Latino community in the
manner that Aguilar was.
"Not having that one person
may affect the outreach and num
ber of people that may come" to

Stanford, Morales said.
Hernandez said the vacancy
might cause a decline in Chi
cano/Latino admissions. She said
she also fears that, of those
accepted, a greater percentage
than usual will be students from
upper class backgrounds.
"If a reader is not permanent,
he or she will have less power
(and) won't carry as much weight
as the others," she said.
According to Fetter, the advo
cacy role won't be hurt because
Aguilar didn't make final deci
sions. However, some audience
members said they thought
Aguilar did make a difference
because she often fought for
many of the applicants and
argued in their favor with the
other officers.
