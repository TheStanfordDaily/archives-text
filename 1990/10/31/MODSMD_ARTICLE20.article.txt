## Leadership, not pandership 
### 
Divine justice was served to
George Bush at the budget table
this week, and a reading of his
puckered lips suggests that even broccoli
would have tasted better.
After condemning opponent Ronald
Reagan for practicing "voodoo eco
nomics" in 1980 and then reversing him
self to embrace those very policies for
eight servile years, President Bush indeed
had almost no choice left but to call in a
witch doctor to undo the Republican fis
cal sorcery.
Speaking from a catamaran off the
coast of Hawaii on Sunday, Bush said that
from here on out, he was "absolutely
going to hold the line on taxes."
Now that he has been clinically diag
nosed as a pathological political panderer
— with acute secondary pledgeomania —
fewer voters should fall for this latest
promise.
But I don't want to kick the president
while he's down (about 30 points down,
that is). Intensive media scrutiny makes
nearly all presidents into caricatures of
themselves.
And, after all, we can learn a lot from
panderers, for they reflect and illuminate
the vices of those to whom they pander. In
Bush's case, that's us: the American peo
ple.
Leaving aside our vice of myopic greed,
which led a majority to fall for Bush's
original tax pledge, we should consider
our severe "entitlementia."
With defense expenditures protected
from the scalpel by the Hussein factor,
the most glaring omission from the bud
get debate was the unwillingness of all

involved (not just Bush) to even discuss
introducing need criteria into the admin
istration of non-poverty entitlement pro
grams, such as Social Security and Medi
care.
These sacrosanct programs are not
means-tested, meaning that they do not
target recipients based on financial need,
and they are indexed to inflation, which
puts them on autopilot for ongoing
growth.
Contrary to popular belief, their
elderly beneficiaries are not universally
needy, though of course many are. In fact,
the elderly constitute America's wealthi
est demographic group.
Nor are they simply receiving back
what they put in during their working
years: retirees today receive Social Secu
rity benefits that are two to five times
greater than the actuarial value of their
prior contributions. They are heavily sub
sidized by our payroll taxes, whereas our
generation will not break even when we
come due.
Grandma may be the nicest person in
the world, but the elderly as a group have
set a poor example for us in terms of dis
tributional fairness.
They have organized to get not just
what they need but what they can, and as
a result are not sharing the burden of
reducing the deficit.
The price tag for Social Security is
about $267 billion today. And the addi
tional Medicare bill ($lOO billion) alone
comprises more of the national budget
than the combination of all entitlement
programs that are directed to the poor,
including Medicaid, Food Stamps, Aid to

Families with Dependent Children and
Child Nutrition. And since they are not
indexed, the latter have failed to keep
pace with inflation.
Only about 15 percent of total entitle
ment spending goes to the poor. In Amer
ica, the highest infant mortality rate in
the industrialized world is hideously jux
taposed to an affluent portion of the
elderly receiving federal benefits they
don't need.
While the recent budget does include a
child-care tax credit and expansion of
Medicaid coverage for poor families, these
fall far short of providing the resources
needed to prevent the growing consolida
tion of a permanent American underclass.
Since poor infants don't have votes, let
alone a powerful lobby, it is only through
leadership rather than "pandership" that
their urgent interests will be addressed in
future budgets.
Bush cannot be blamed alone. But
since Republican policies have played a
large role in bringing us to our present
national insolvency, he had a special
responsibility to galvanize a divided
Congress to do its duty in reforming our
entitlement structure. In this, he failed.
