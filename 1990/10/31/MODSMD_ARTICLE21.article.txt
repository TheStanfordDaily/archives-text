Student shocked that
people at Stanford
shower in the nude
I agree totally with Debra Howard's
letter in Monday's paper.
When I came here as a freshman, I
was appalled to find that the men in
Stern Hall had to shower together. What
shocked me even more was the fact that
people around here shower in the nude!!!
Nudity is simply immoral, and I won't
have any part of it; I wear my bathing
suit in the shower, and when I have to go
to the bathroom, I try not to look down
at my thingy. As anyone who has been
raised properly knows, thingies are
immoral too.
Debra, I am so glad to find someone
with morals around here, and anytime
you'd like to engage in artificial insemi
nation, give me a call.

Nudity and sexuality,
two separate issues
When I first came to Stanford three
years ago, I spent one month in Theta
Chi while searching for permanent hous
ing. During that time, I confronted the
coed shower stall.
Coed bathrooms were not new to me,
but actually sharing a coed shower made
me, as well as many other residents of
both sexes, uncomfortable.
Fortunately, the system adhered to by
all worked in our favor. Upon entering
the shower one had to ask permission to
enter. If those already showering wished
not to share with a member of the oppo
site sex, the requester, with complete
understanding, waited.
No woman ever saw me naked, nor did
I see any woman who did not wish to be
seen so.
This whole coed shower thing upset

me, however. Not that I objected to
whatever sort of orgies might be going on
behind that frosted Plexiglas door.
As a flaming liberal I felt that whatev
er these consenting adults wanted to do
in there was their business, provided I
had my freedom to shower with males
only.
No, rather I was jealous of them.
Again, not because they were engaging in
showery sex sessions, but precisely
because they weren't. They were there
because they wanted to shower and, once
they had established trust and under
standing between each other, sex and
anatomy were not issues.
Unlike myself, these folks had the
ability to distinguish nudity from sexual
ity. I resented that I could not help but
make a big deal over this.
Our society's puritanical values, how
ever, lead to a much greater problem
than my personal hang-up. Equating
nudity with sexuality, particularly with
respect to females, contributes to the
popularity among men of such "girly"
magazines as Playboy and Penthouse.
For most men, this is the predominant
context in which they view the female
nude body.
Ironically, even conservatives such as
Debra Howard allow these magazines to
determine the standard to which we hold
the arguably discreet image of people
taking a shower.

Do Stanford cyclists have a death
wish?
This morning, as I drove across cam
pus, I counted 14 people on bicycles.
Only three were wearing helmets. Of the
six I observed turning, none made a sig
nal.
None of the 14 stopped at stop signs,
regardless of traffic. One rode up beside
me on the right and, without pausing,

turned left in front of the car ahead of
me, which had stopped at the stop sign
and was starting to accelerate.
One swung wide into the automobile
lane to go around a jogger, without sig
naling or looking behind him, and passed
right in front of a truck. Two pairs were
slowly pedaling side by side so that one
was in the auto lane, forcing cars to cross
the center line to pass them.
Maybe when The Daily runs a front
page story about a cyclist splattered all
over the road, others will change their
illegal and frighteningly dangerous
habits.

Closing Tours costs
more than it saves
Program cuts and more program cuts.
If they aren't currently in one depart
ment, they are in many others.
As Stanford tries to face up to eco
nomic "realities," it is indeed regrettable,
if not contemptible, that the Center for
Overseas Studies has chosen to eliminate
its program in Tours.
Accordingly to The Daily's account of
the situation ("Tours closure met with
regret," Oct. 25), the Center for Over
seas Studies will save an estimated
$120,000 annually by terminating the
program.
But what are the costs for students
pursuing study in France? A required
two-quarter commitment, which many
students cannot make for financial and
academic reasons.
Reduced opportunity for study in
France by 40 students per year directly
contradicts the increase in student inter
est in overseas study we have seen dur
ing our four years here.
Despite these costs, Ewart Thomas,
Dean of Humanities and Sciences, ulti
mately justifies the termination of the
program with the implication that Paris
will provide a more "stimulating, chal
lenging, and culturally enriching" experi

ence than Tours.
But what gives Thomas the right to
make this value judgment for the rest of
us? Can he honestly say that the pro
gram in Paris can take the place of the
experience in Tours? Perhaps going to
Stanford, a medium-sized, private insti
tution, is the same as going to Berkeley.
These seem to be the monetary "bene
fits" and cultural/academic costs of the
termination of the Tours Program. Is
this the kind of quasi-cost-benefit analy
sis that the Center for Overseas Study
went through?
It certainly seems to be. Yet, just as in
any such analyses, money today is easily
valued, while the long-term, uniquely
human benefits are undervalued.
If the charge of the Center for Over
seas Studies is to provide experientially
different opportunities for students,
then the Center has taken one step for
ward in its announcement of plans for
the Bering Campus but has taken two
steps back by terminating a well-liked,
well-established program. Perhaps the
Center for Overseas Studies should re
evaluate its mission for the student body.

What was that?
What is all this talk about pubic
schools?
It says right here in the Oct. 24 Daily
that . .integration of homosexual cou
ples into heterosexual housing is having
the same effect as the integration of
pubic schools..."
What's become of our educational sys
tem? I think it's a disgrace that we are
sending our children to such institutions.
What filth are they learning at these
pubic schools? 1...
What?... A typo? Oh.
Never mind.
