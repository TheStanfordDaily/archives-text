# Views of international students were ignored
## 
### 
I feel that, in announcing its new
domestic partner housing policy, Stan
ford (so proud of its diversity and multi
culturalism) has totally ignored the
views of international students living in
Escondido Village, where all the new
couples will be housed.
Perhaps this is because we are less
noisy and forthcoming than the propo
nents of the policy, though we are quite
probably as, or more, numerous.
Now the Escondido Village adminis
tration wishes to reconcile us to this pol
icy after the fact, through a series of
forums discussing the issues involved.
Quite possibly, they will think they
have succeeded, because I am certain
that most of us who are opposed to the
policy will not attend these sessions.
Some reasons why we will not come:
• The process of publicly airing differ
ences is repugnant to the Asian soul.
Most of us would rather mind our own
business and put up with the nonsense,
even if we are unhappy with it.
• Many of us are not practiced at
articulating our views in English on mat
ters such as these.
• We do not expect to get a fair hear
ing anyway. Consider the very title the
forums go by — "Living Differently, Liv
ing Together: Examining domestic styles
in Escondido Village."
Or the title of one session — "Gay,
Lesbian, Straight and Bi: All part of the
Stanford Mix." Unless you happen to
hold differing views, it is perhaps not
obvious how these, as well as a lot of the
other phrases bandied about, reek of
self-righteousness. ("You're a narrow
minded bigot if you refuse to accept our
enlightened, progressive views.")
If I went to these sessions, it would be
with a sense of foreboding (and it is with
a sense of foreboding that I write this
letter now).
I am opposed to the domestic partner
housing policy because, to put it mildly,
it devalues the sanctity of marriage and
of the family unit, both of which Asians
have traditionally taken very seriously.
But let me rather try to make a case
based on practical considerations.
If couples applying for housing do not
have to prove their commitment to each
other by showing a marriage certificate,
the inevitable result is that we will see in
Escondido Village more breakups, part
ner-swapping and other variations on

this theme, as units disintegrate and re
form. (How many couples of college age
who are not married to each other know
that they are committed to each other?)
Also, this more open policy is suscepti
ble to abuse by people seeking lower-cost
University housing, with all its fringe
benefits. All of this is bound to result in
an erosion of trust between neighbors
(this has already started to happen),
leading to a degradation of the quality of
community life in Escondido Village.
I know that I and many others (par
ticularly families) have felt that Escon
dido Village provides us a relatively safe
and stable haven in the midst of the rela
tional chaos that seems to pervade
America today. I would be very sorry to
see this thrown away.
Stanford has adopted this housing
policy without considering the views of a
large number of people who will be
affected by it.
I hope it is not too late to repair this
omission, and I hope that the University
will not turn a deaf ear to us now.
