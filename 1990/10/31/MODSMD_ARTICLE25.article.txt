# Those against policy should say something
## 
### 
I didn't attend the Oct. 22 forum on
the new domestic partners policy, so I
can't say if The Daily accurately reported
the range of opinions expressed there.
However, I am concerned that the
debate is being framed as one between
the "hysteria created by fundamentalist
Christians" and a few selfish married
couples on the one hand, and all the rest
of us fair-minded folk on the other.
The issue, it seems to me, goes beyond
this, and public debate and The Daily's
coverage should reflect the seriousness
of the new policy's implications.
One doesn't have to be a fundamen
talist Christian to recognize that "tradi
tional" marriage has a long history as a
social institution, and that there do exist
reasons for society's legal sanctioning of
it.
Communities have always structured
themselves to encourage and reward cer
tain social patterns in all areas of human
activity (and, understandably, those who
do not follow these patterns have always
seen injustice toward themselves rather
than benefits for others).
Those who enjoy relationships outside
of marriage should not suffer discrimina
tion, but should they eryoy the same
benefits that society bestows upon mar
ried couples?
Are we ready to say that our tradi
tional view of the benefits of marriage
and family is fundamentally flawed, and
that legal recognition should be extended
or shifted to other kinds of relation
ships? (Note that this issue is fundamen
tally different from merely observing and
admitting the fact that traditional mar

riage and family structures are often not
followed.)
Maybe, but if so, be prepared to open
whole new cans of worms: why discrimi
nate against, say, close relatives who
wish to marry? Should a group of con
senting adults engaging in polygamy all
be granted "spouse cards?"
I am convinced that there are a great
many at Stanford who share my reserva
tions about the domestic partners policy
for reasons other than "concern that
homosexuality may be contagious."
Although real debate over this polity
is inappropriately coming only after it
has already been adopted, I urge them to
make their voices heard and opposition
known.
