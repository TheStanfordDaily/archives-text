# Exchange of ideas is not always free
## 
### 
The new domestic partners policy is
certainly a deserved victory for the gay,
lesbian and bisexual communities at
Stanford. Still, while it demonstrates
that a minority voice can effect signifi
cant change, it also serves as a reminder
that the exchange of ideas is not always
as free as it should be.
This time The Stanford Review bore
the brunt of the attack.
The Oct. 22 issue of The Review fea
tured the story "Married Students
Oppose 'Domestic Partners.' " The cover
illustration depicted a woman covering
her daughter's eyes, presumably from
some display of homosexual "lifestyle."
In the story, a group of married stu
dents complained that homosexual cou
ples in married student housing would
disrupt the "family atmosphere." Some
parents suggested creating "a separate
section ... for homosexuals to live so
that their children would not be sub
jected to homosexual 'lifestyles.' "
Three days later I saw a flier depicting
the same mother shielding her daugh
ter's eyes, but this time she was saying
"I don't know if I want you to read The
Review and become all bigoted and hate
ful." The flier goes on to charge The
Review with implicitly advocating segre
gation of homosexual students; later it
links The Review to the Nazis.
The flier did not attack parental over
protection, ignorance, homophobia or
whatever really might have sparked the
disturbing comments in the story.
Instead, it attacked The Review for
daring to print the story in the first
place. As usual, the majority tries to
silence the minority, except this time it's
not coming from Jesse Helms.
The comments made by the students
in The Review article alarm me; but I am
not ready to say that, because I take
offense to their position, they should be
muzzled. The married student voice sel
dom reaches very far into campus, and if

it weren't for The Review, we might
never have heard their concerns and
fears.
Is someone out there saying that stu
dents with children should be seen but
not heard? That they are too main
stream for their concerns to be
addressed?
I hope no one would wish silence upon
any group, especially in the name of a
community which has had to remain
silent for so long as the gay, lesbian and
bisexual community.
Instead, let's take what victories we
can get and refuse to be narrow, even
toward the narrow.
