# Don't worry about your kids, they know love when they see it
## 
### 
At last Monday's program on same
sex couples in Escondido Village, the
question was repeatedly asked, "What
will I tell my children? They just won't
understand."
The best thing to do is to just tell
them what you really feel. Which for
some in the audience would go like this:

"Well, Pablo, those two women next door
are sick and perverted people."
Only then will your child become con
fused: "But Mommy, they always kiss
each other goodbye in the morning."
"But Daddy, Maria took care of
Angela when she got sick last week."
"But Daddy, they always wave and
smile at me on my way to school."
"But Mommy, they seem so nice and
happy together."
Children have an enormous capacity
to know love when they see it. You need
not worry about your children under
standing it at all unless they, like you,
have already been taught to hate.
The arrival of domestic partner cou
ples in Escondido Village is an opportuni
ty to teach your children, and to learn
yourself, that love knows no gender bar
riers. Love doesn't spring from a mar
riage license, a blood test and a wedding,
but from each person's heart and soul.
Welcome your new neighbors with
open arms, and your children will learn a
truly great lesson about love and respect
for difference.
