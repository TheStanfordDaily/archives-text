## Complications now predictable in diabetic patients 
### Julie Makinen 
A technique developed by
researchers at the Stanford
Children's Hospital may enable
doctors to identify patients at
risk of developing complica
tions from diabetes.
The researchers, John
Luetscher, professor of
medicine emeritus, and Darrell
Wilson, assistant professor of
pediatrics, found that high lev
els of a specific chemical in the
blood of diabetics are corre
lated with an increased risk of
incurring complications.
Prorenin, the chemical pre
dictor they identified, is
secreted by the kidneys into
the blood.
Levels of prorenin were
found to be significantly higher
in adolescents with diabetic
complications than in patients
without complications.
More significantly, an
increase in prorenin levels pre
ceded the onset of complica
tions by up to 36 months.
Wilson stressed that while a
general blood test for complica
tions based on prorenin levels
is "still a long way off, the out
look is very promising."
Luetscher and Wilson feel
that this discovery could lead
to the development of a clinical
blood test which identifies
patients who will develop
severe consequences of Type 1
diabetes mellitus.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is
an autoimmune disease in
which the body's own defense
system attacks the pancreas
and damages its insulin secret
ing ablity. This type accounts
for 10 to 15 percent of all dia
betes cases.
According to Wilson, the
development of a test would
allow physicians to "work more
aggressively on those patients

High levels of a
specific chemical in
the blood of diabet
ics are correlated
with an increased
risk of developing
complications.

at risk for complications.**
One complication correlated
with elevated levels of
prorenein is angiopathy, which
involves capillaries in the eyes
and kidneys, and can eventu
ally lead to blindness or kidney
failure.
If high-risk patients could
be identified prior to the onset
of angiopathy, specific treat
ments could be initiated to
combat the loss of vision or kid
ney failure.
Luetscher and Wilson con
ducted their study of 135 dia
betic children and adolescents
at the Children's Hospital.
The results of the study,
which spanned several years,
were recently published in The
New England Journal of
Medicine.
The research involved close
monitoring of the subjects'
prorenin levels and evaluation
of their conditions every six
months. This study was the
first to demonstrate that ele
vated prorenein levels precede
the appearance of complica
tions.
Luetscher had previously
found that prorenin was associ
ated with diabetic complica
tions in adults.
Whether prorenin itself is
actually involved in causing
angiopathic complications
remains a question, although
"it is a possibility," according to
Wilson. rrrfv\
