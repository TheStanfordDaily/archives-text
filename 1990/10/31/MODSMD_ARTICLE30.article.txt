# Foothills harbor intellectual haven

### Julie Makinen 
Nestled high in the Foothills
lies an oasis for distinguished
intellectuals, a sort of modern-day
Walden.
No, this is not a new theme
house for freshmen who scored
1600 on the SAT; it's the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behav
ioral Sciences.
The center was founded by the
Ford Foundation in 1952 as a five
year experiment seeking "knowl
edge of the principles which gov
ern human behavior."

Unlike many
research-oriented
programs, the cen
ter's primary goal
is to facilitate the
intellectual growth
of its fellows,
rather than to gen
erate experimental
data.

Now a permanent program, the
center fulfills a unique niche in
the world of post-doctorate study.
Unlike many research-oriented
programs, the center's primary
goal is to facilitate the intellectual
growth of its fellows, rather than
to generate experimental data.
Each year, there are thousands
of nominations for the 48 avail
able fellowships at the center. The
fellows are individuals from all
over the world with doctorates or
medical degrees who "show excep
tional promise or accomplishment
in their respective fields."
The fellows, usually on sabbat
ical from permanent positions at
universities, come to engage in
deep thought and eryoy the stimu
lating company of other leading
scientists.
Each year's recipients repre
sent a wide anray of disciplines,
from anthropology to computer

science to music.
Awardees are provided with a
modest one-room study (without
telephone), a stipend to supple
ment their sabbatical pay, and
access to the support staff of the
Center, who conduct such tasks as
library searches and secretarial
duties.
Fellows are purposely shielded
from the distractions of everyday
life — such as phone calls — so
that they may write books or
develop theories, read extensively
and talk to other fellows. All indi
viduals uses their year as they see
fit, and are not required to com
plete any set projects.
By inviting people of all back-
S rounds and fields, the center
opes to stimulate dialogue
between disciplines and broaden
the perspectives of some very
promising intellects.
"We hope that these people will
learn how others ask and answer
ouestions, how others study ...
that this experience will have a
life-long personal and career
effect," says Assoc. Director
Robert Scott.
In the past several years, many
Stanford faculty members have
been fellows at the center.
Anthropology Prof. Bill
Durham, who is well known to
Human Biology students, spent
last year up on the hill.
Durham, who coordinates the
Human Biology Core, described
the center as "heaven on earth"
and expressed a great sense of lib
eration at being given a year away
from all the responsibilities and
demands of university life.
During his fellowship, Durham
wrote a review paper entitled
"Advances in Evolutionary Cul
ture Theory," which is soon to be
published in the Annual Review of
Anthropology.
He also completed "Coevolu
tion: Genes, Culture and Human
Diversity," a book forthcoming
from Stanford University Press.
Chapters from this book have
already been incorporated into
this year's Human Biology Core
readings.
"The combination of freedom
and support was unparalleled (at
the center) and lead to an unusual
intensity," exclaimed Durham
with enthusiasm.

Other recent Stanford fellows
include Hans Weiler of the School
of Education, who spent time
reading, writing, talking, and
working on articles about the pol
itics of knowledge and Brian Wan
dell of the Psychology depart
ment.
Wandell finished a book called
"Visual Sensing by Humans and
Computers" — which is soon to be
published — during his stay at the
center.
All of these former fellows
expressed great enthusiasm for
the flexibility of the program and
the year in repose the center
granted them.
The center's approach is "an

tal," a "long-term developmental
approach," rather than a short
term project, according to Scott.
This approach seems to be
quite successful. While there is no
absolute measure by which to
gauge the center's contributions
to science and to society, there are
several impressive testaments to
its worth.

One such contribution is the
Ralph Tyler collection of "works
conceived, initiated or completed
by Fellows while at the Center."
The collection contains over 1,000
volumes, with topics ranging from
"Formal Theories on Mass Behav
ior" to "Managing the Dollar."
Several of these works have been
best-sellers.
The center has also played a
part in many scientific develop
ments and intellectual trends.
Some of the accomplishments
have been in the fields of experi
mental social psychology, behav
ioral genetics, primate behavior,
mathematics and behavioral sci
ences.
The center is currently

involved in introducing statistical
methods and computers to social
scientists lacking a technical back
ground. They even offer fellows
an introductory course on how to
use the Macintosh.
The center has been a model
for several other institutions
worldwide, one of which was
founded by a former fellow.
Although there is no official
connection between Stanford and
the center, there is a mutually
beneficial relationship between
the two institutions.
The fellows have the advan
tages of accessing University
resources, such as libraries, and
the opportunity to interact with
Stanford faculty.
The University, on the other
hand, is able to draw on the com
munity of fellows as a resource.
Fellows often lecture on campus,

and some later join the Stanford
faculty. Nobel laureates Milton
Friedman and Kenneth Arrow
both have ties to the center.
Life up in the hills is not all
personal cultivation and no play,
however. Like the undergrads
down on the Farm, fellows engage
in everything from volleyball
games to World Series pools. Lun
cheons and social hours complete
with hors d'oeuvres are also activ
ities of great interest.
Good food is one of the center's
most essential components, Scott
claimed. Equipped with its own
mini-cafeteria, the center heavily
subsidizes its kitchen and enlists
excellent chefs. According to
Scott, this facilitates scholarly
exchange in a casual, social atmo
sphere.
Maybe University Food service
could learn from this example.
