# Late-arriving LC may be life of the Macintosh party
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
WHEN APPLE THREW ITS big
party on Oct. 15 to introduce the
new Macintoshes, one of the
most important guests wasn't in atten
dance.
The new Macintosh LC, Apple's first
color computer "for the rest of us," will
not be available until early 1991. (The
Bookstore doesn't expect to have any
until March.)
It is unfortunate for both Apple and
customers that the computer is delayed,
because it's a most interesting machine.
Based on the Motorola 68020 micropro
cessor, the LC packs the same punch as
the original Mac 11.
Granted, by the standards of today's
high-powered Apples, a Mac II is no speed
demon.
Still, for the average user accustomed
to the sluggish Plus and SE, the LC's addi
tional power is a godsend. The other sig
nificant features of the computer are built-

in support for Apple's
small color monitors; a flat,
pizza-box shape that
makes it the shortest Mac
outside the Portable; and
an expansion slot.
Planning on selling the
LC heavily in the education
market, Apple figures
many will use the slot for a
card that emulates the ven-

erable Apple He. There are thousands of
programs targeted toward education that
run on the He — and now the Mac, thanks
totheLC.
As is often the case, however, Apple's
plans for the LC and the market's may
differ greatly.
Because the machine should be avail
able in retail channels for $3,000 (includ
ing two megabytes of memory, a 40-
megabyte hard disk and the 12-inch color
monitor), it promises to be popular with
businesses who shied away from bottom
of-the-line Macs because they had tiny
screens and were too slow.

The Bookstore figures
the machine will cost stu
dents and faculty about
$2,000 (the monitor is
$378).
One of the reasons for
the delay in shipping the
LC is that Apple made a
design change late in the
game. Originally, the
machine was slated to ship

with 4-bit color graphics — enough to
display just 16 colors. The Macintosh
standard since the original Mac II is 8-bit
color, or 256 colors.
Since a lot of the educational software
the machine was destined to run requires
256 colors, Apple wisely made the swap
before releasing the computer. In that
case, the forward thinkers on the LC team
prevailed.
However, by sticking to the 68020 chip
instead of the 68030 that's used in the
SE/30, Ilci, and Ilfx, Apple did take a step
backward. Many analysts say it was too
large a step, that the machine is crippled

and will be a commercial failure.
Somehow, I doubt it. While LC owners
will not be able to exploit all the features
of the much ballyhooed System 7 —
Apple's next-generation operating system
— they will be able to run it because the
LC includes the requisite two megabytes.
It would not be surprising if the LC
winds up as a very hot seller because it
appeals to so many different markets: edu
cation, entry-level business those looking
for second machines to use at home.
ALL TOLD, THE NEW Macintoshes
represent a significant departure
for the Cupertino computer giant.
Sacrificing short term profits for market
penetration may not please Wall Street
over the next 12 months, but it will go a
long way toward determining where
Apple stands two years from now.
If the strategy succeeds, Apple can be a
major player — behind MS-DOS giants
IBM and Compaq. If it fails, the Macin
tosh's parent firm will be relegated to a
niche player, a company whose computers

are only used for graphics and other spe
cial purposes.
Just because Apple has focused on the
low end this time around, don't think for
a second they've forgotten the cutting
edge. Sometime next year, a new Mac
based on the 68040 chip will be intro
duced. Preliminary reports suggest the
machine will be twice as fast as the Ilfx,
which is no slouch.
Further, Apple has promised to undo
the Portable fiasco in two stages. First,
they'll lighten up the package and include
a switchable backlight for the display. The
latter change will allow you to see the
screen without direct light.
Second, a portable based on the 68030
will join the lineup later in the year, giving
Mac users power on the go.
Finally, whenever System 7 finally
ships, it will again become clear the
world's best system software comes from
Apple. The first version should be excit
ing, but unlike with System 6, later ver
sions will include powerful new functions
as well.
