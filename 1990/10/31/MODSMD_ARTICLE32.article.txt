# Eye disease now easier to detect

Glaucoma — an eye disease
which can cause blindness — can
now be diagnosed in earlier stages
with the help of a recently pub
lished book by Dr. Louis Roloff of
the School of Medicine.
A disease that destroys the
nerve fibers lining the back of the
eye, glaucoma affects the periph
eral vision of more than two mil
lion people in the United States.
Traditionally, ophthalmolo
gists have had difficulty diagnos
ing glaucoma in its early stages.
Current tests, involving eye
pressure and visual fields, are use
ful in diagnosing glaucoma, but by
the time the problem is diagnosed,
patients may have already lost
partial vision.
Roloffs book, "Retinal Fiber
Layer Photography," contains
detailed photographs of the eye's
nerve fibers and contrasts pic-

tures of healthy eyes with those
afflicted by glaucoma in its early
stages.
Stanford photographers Ivan
Pieper and Jim Taskett used spe
cial film and filters to photograph
— in extraordinary detail — the
nerve fibers in the back of the eye
that are destroyed by glaucoma.
Roloff has spent years develop

ing the technique for interpreting
the pictures, which he says is "def
initely one of the best tests we
have."
Other eye doctors with less
experience interpreting detailed
images can use RolofFs book as a
guide for understanding their own
patients' photographs.
These photographs can help
ophthalmologists identify a 10 to
15 percent nerve fiber loss in
patients' eyes. Previously, up to
40 percent of nerve fibers were
destroyed before the disease could
be diagnosed.
The photographs work for
about 86 percent of people afflict
ed with glaucoma.
However, they are not effective
for patients whose pupils won't
dilate or for those with blond hair,
who consequently have no pig
ment in the backs of their eyes to
contrast with the nerve fibers.
