# Bug breathes underwater

### Brian White Kurt Gish 
A ,In the recent movie, "The
W , Abyss, * one of the char
acters (and a rat) is breathing
a special liquid, instead of air.
Is this for real?
A .It is a little-known fact
• that most of the futuris
tic details in science-fiction
movies (Klingons, warp drive,
Republicans, etc.) actually
exist in reality. This liquid
breathing is no exception.
In 1966, scientists used an
oxygenated perfluorocarbon
liquid to support the ventila
tion of mice, cats, and dogs.
This chemical (perfluo
rotripropylamine) can have a
dissolved oxygen content of 48
percent, whicn is closer to the
21 percent found in air than
the mere 3 percent found in
water.
The animals were able to
extract oxygen from the fluoro
carbon in a manner similar to
the way fish extract it from
water.
The scene from the movie
which showed a rat breathing
the liquid was indeed real, and
demonstrations like it have
been shown on TV programs
such as "Nova."
The earlier experimental
animals were able to breathe
the liquid for long periods with
no real adverse effects,
although some fluorocarbon
did remain in the lungs for at
least three years.
However, the actor in the
movie did not truly breathe the
liquid, nor does the U.S. Navy
have such equipment to date
(or none that Admiral Poindex
ter has admitted to).
In addition to undersea
applications, liquid ventilation
has potential medical benefits
for patients with severe respi
ratory problems.

The first human trials for
fluorocarbon liquid ventilation
were conducted earlier this
year on three premature
infants. Although all showed
some improvement in lung
function after returning to air
breathing, all three ultimately
died from their underlying dis
eases.
Volunteers for the second
human trials may submit their
applications to The Science
Bugs.
Q m My roommate and I got
minto a heated discussion
aoout electricity the other days
after he left his stereo on
overnight. So, how much
energy did he waste as com
pared to, say, the amount used
to power Third World countries
which really need it?
A, Electrical power is usu
• ally measures in kilo
watts (kW), while the energy
consumed (amount of fuel
burned) is measured in kilo
watt-hours (kWh).
Your roommate's stereo
drew about 0.1 kW for about 18
hours, consuming roughly 1.8
kWh. This number, however, is

meaningless without some
comparison, which we will gra
ciously provide.
Judging by the electric bill
for Science Bug Residential
Park, the average person con
sumes roughly 2,000-3,000
kWh every year. Your room
mate's waste —1.8 kWh — is
less than 0.1 percent of that.
Waste is waste and you
should avoid it, but it is the big
appliances in your room, like
your refrigerator (400-800
kWh per year), that make up
the bulk of your total consump
tion.
For some more perspective,
if you calculate your share of
the total electrical energy gen
erated in the United States in
one year (for example, 1988), it
comes out to about 12,000 kWh
(instead of 2,000).
Where does that extra 9,000
kWh get used? As far as we can
figure, it powers factories,
street lights and other useful
things, including the White
House Christmas tree.
Relative to other countries
with similar standards of liv
ing, we have a very high per
capita yearly energy consump
tion.
In Japan, it's about 6,000
kWh per person per year and in
western Europe, it's about
5,000. In the Third World, it is
much, much less. It is people
like your roommate who help
keep us number one.
Unfortunately, simply run
ning an extension cord from
Serra to Managua wouldn't
help distribute energy more
evenly. Besides their lack of
generating capacity, Third
World countries also lack the
distribution systems to get the
power to the people (in more
ways than one).
So, although you can't send
your wasted power to the Third
World, it would be prudent not
to waste it in the first place.
