## Card comeback tops Tigers 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
STOCKTON — As the fourth game
of last night's volleyball match was
being decided, UOP coach John Dun
ning leaned back in his chair and let out
one tremendous sigh. It's probably fair
to say it was more a sigh of resignation
than relief.
At Spanos Center in Stockton late
yesterday evening, the No. 5 Cardinal
defused the high-powered Pacific attack,
defeating the No. 4 Tigers 13-15, 9-15,
15-10, 15-8, 15-7. The comeback victory
may be the biggest of the season thus far
as Stanford continues to down teams
ranked ahead of it.
"Stanford has been playing really
well," Dunning said. "They may be the
hottest team in the country right now."
The squad, however, didn't play like
that in the first two games.
While 2,500 orange-clad UOP fans
streamed in, Pacific middle blocker
Cathey Scotlan and company went right
to work. After a quick side-out of Stan
ford's first service, the Tigers fed Scot
lan who converted the first of her 12
kills. Pacific streaked on a 5-1 run capi
talizing on erratic Cardinal ball control.
"In the beginning, we were totally
unorganized," Stanford coach Don
Shaw said. "But then we began to focus
on our jobs."
The Cardinal stuck back instantly.
Senior Jessica Benton, who had the best
night of her career, struck the first of
her 18 kills to spark Stanford on a five
point run. The teams traded points until
All-American Kristin Klein solo-blocked
a Pacific attack to propel the team
ahead, 10-9. Klein and Oden combined
on another block to move Stanford to a
13-10 first game advantage.
But the Tigers called time-out and
resorted to what they do best. They set
Krissy Fifer. The senior first-team All-
American converted a side-out kill and
then let Sharon Kasser serve Stanford
out of the game. Kasser forced a blown
pass and delivered two aces to cap a 5-0
game-ending run.
Frustration over their inability to
take care of matters early may have
affected Stanford's performance in

game two. Pacific tallied the first two
points and led 7-2 before the Cardinal
could find any sort of rhythm. UOP set
ter Melanie Beckenhauer kept the Car
dinal guessing, dumping the ball for a
kill during the run.
Benton delivered with machine-like
efficiency to keep Stanford close but
Pacific started to fine-tune its block as
well. The Tigers stuffed Stanford
attacks at 11-4, 13-9 and at game point.
Pacific outblocked Stanford 17-12 on
the night.
"We just were not in the right frame
of mind in the beginning," Shaw said.
"We really needed to snap out of it."
Thankfully, all that took was a nice,
brief intermission and some choice
words of inspiration from an assistant
coach. "The coaches just told us that it
was us against the entire crowd," Klein
said. "I think we came out with a really
good attitude."
Their mental revival led to instant
results. Klein and Benton pounded two
kills each to push the team ahead in the
third game, 3-0. Stanford began to flex
some of its own defensive muscle, roof
ing several Pacific attacks. After a stuff
by sophomore Bev Oden and Benton,
junior Amy Cooper came alive with
three consecutive kills and a block of her
own.
Dunning called timeout down 2-7,
but accomplished little as Oden and
Benton assisted each other for another
block. The Cardinal led 12-7 before a
rally that must have lasted 2-3 full min
utes resulted in a UOP sideout. In the
play, sophomore Laurie Sawin made a
diving dig to save a hopelessly down ball.
After surrendering three points to
Pacific, the Cardinal sealed its first
game with kills by Oden and Benton.
"We just were not real happy with how
we were playing," Shaw said. "We said
to ourselves 'let's go out there and be
the team that we can be.'"
That, indeed, they did. With solid

defensive contributions from Kathy
Jurgens, Danielle Everett, Cheryl Conly
and Sawin, Stanford seized command of
the match. Despite powerful hitting by
UOP's Fifer and Scotlan, Stanford man
aged to keep the points alive.
"Their defense was awesome," Dun
ning said. "We really hit some balls in
there but Stanford dug them all." The
Cardinal finished with 131 digs on the
night.
Klein and Oden, who each had 20
kills on the night, started things nicely
for the Cardinal in game four. Each had
kills in a 9-2 opening run. The Tigers
ran into some problems themselves
committing a number of attack errors
during the streak. After their initial
attempts had been muffled, Pacific's
players often fumbled the ball com
pletely.
"They were just not used to having a
lot of balls coming back at them," Shaw
said.
But while the offense slowed, Pacific
fought hard to commandeer the net
defensively. Scotlan recorded one of her
11 blocks to charge the team on a mini
rally. Stanford's Cooper returned the
favor with a solo block at 10-4. Setter
Carrie Feldman served an ace at 12-6 as
the Cardinal coasted in.
While there were 2,000 or so Pacific
fans scattered about the arena, the most
vocal section in the building was Stan
ford's own booster contingent. The
group did a lot of yelling as the teams
prepared for the decisive game. They —
like the others in Spanos Center —
could probably sense the shift in
momentum.
The Cardinal struck furiously for 9
unanswered points to begin the set. In
the run, Oden had 3 kills and proved
formidable at the net. She blocked five
balls throughout the night to go with
her 24 digs.
The Tigers picked and scratched at
the deficit but were held at bay by incon
sistent passing. "Our passing just did
not allow us to be deceptive."
"Right now, we're as good as any
other team in the country," Shaw said.
"We still have so much room for
improvement but we're going to savor
this one tonight."

favor with a solo block at 10-4. Setter
Carrie Feldman served an ace at 12-6 as
the Cardinal coasted in.
While there were 2,000 or so Pacific
fans scattered about the arena, the most
vocal section in the building was Stan
ford's own booster contingent. The
group did a lot of yelling as the teams
prepared for the decisive game. They —
like the others in Spanos Center —
could probably sense the shift in
momentum.
The Cardinal struck furiously for 9
unanswered points to begin the set. In
the run, Oden had 3 kills and proved
formidable at the net. She blocked five
balls throughout the night to go with
her 24 digs.
The Tigers picked and scratched at
the deficit but were held at bay by incon
sistent passing. "Our passing just did
not allow us to be deceptive."
"Right now, we're as good as any
other team in the country," Shaw said.
"We still have so much room for
improvement but we're going to savor
this one tonight."

Last night super sophomore Bev Oden and her teammates achieved a huge comeback
victory over No. 4 UOP after falling Into a 2-0 hole. The win was the Cardinal's second
over a top-five team this season.
STOCKTON — As the fourth game
of last night's volleyball match was
being decided, UOP coach John Dun
ning leaned back in his chair and let out
one tremendous sigh. It's probably fair
to say it was more a sigh of resignation
than relief.
At Spanos Center in Stockton late
yesterday evening, the No. 5 Cardinal
defused the high-powered Pacific attack,
defeating the No. 4 Tigers 13-15, 9-15,
15-10, 15-8, 15-7. The comeback victory
may be the biggest of the season thus far
as Stanford continues to down teams
ranked ahead of it.
"Stanford has been playing really
well," Dunning said. "They may be the
hottest team in the country right now."
The squad, however, didn't play like
that in the first two games.
While 2,500 orange-clad UOP fans
streamed in, Pacific middle blocker
Cathey Scotlan and company went right
to work. After a quick side-out of Stan
ford's first service, the Tigers fed Scot
lan who converted the first of her 12
kills. Pacific streaked on a 5-1 run capi
talizing on erratic Cardinal ball control.
"In the beginning, we were totally
unorganized," Stanford coach Don
Shaw said. "But then we began to focus
on our jobs."
The Cardinal stuck back instantly.
Senior Jessica Benton, who had the best
night of her career, struck the first of
her 18 kills to spark Stanford on a five
point run. The teams traded points until
All-American Kristin Klein solo-blocked
a Pacific attack to propel the team
ahead, 10-9. Klein and Oden combined
on another block to move Stanford to a
13-10 first game advantage.
But the Tigers called time-out and
resorted to what they do best. They set
Krissy Fifer. The senior first-team All-
American converted a side-out kill and
then let Sharon Kasser serve Stanford
out of the game. Kasser forced a blown
pass and delivered two aces to cap a 5-0
game-ending run.
Frustration over their inability to
take care of matters early may have
affected Stanford's performance in

game two. Pacific tallied the first two
points and led 7-2 before the Cardinal
could find any sort of rhythm. UOP set
ter Melanie Beckenhauer kept the Car
dinal guessing, dumping the ball for a
kill during the run.
Benton delivered with machine-like
efficiency to keep Stanford close but
Pacific started to fine-tune its block as
well. The Tigers stuffed Stanford
attacks at 11-4, 13-9 and at game point.
Pacific outblocked Stanford 17-12 on
the night.
"We just were not in the right frame
of mind in the beginning," Shaw said.
"We really needed to snap out of it."
Thankfully, all that took was a nice,
brief intermission and some choice
words of inspiration from an assistant
coach. "The coaches just told us that it
was us against the entire crowd," Klein
said. "I think we came out with a really
good attitude."
Their mental revival led to instant
results. Klein and Benton pounded two
kills each to push the team ahead in the
third game, 3-0. Stanford began to flex
some of its own defensive muscle, roof
ing several Pacific attacks. After a stuff
by sophomore Bev Oden and Benton,
junior Amy Cooper came alive with
three consecutive kills and a block of her
own.
Dunning called timeout down 2-7,
but accomplished little as Oden and
Benton assisted each other for another
block. The Cardinal led 12-7 before a
rally that must have lasted 2-3 full min
utes resulted in a UOP sideout. In the
play, sophomore Laurie Sawin made a
diving dig to save a hopelessly down ball.
After surrendering three points to
Pacific, the Cardinal sealed its first
game with kills by Oden and Benton.
"We just were not real happy with how
we were playing," Shaw said. "We said
to ourselves 'let's go out there and be
the team that we can be.'"
That, indeed, they did. With solid

defensive contributions from Kathy
Jurgens, Danielle Everett, Cheryl Conly
and Sawin, Stanford seized command of
the match. Despite powerful hitting by
UOP's Fifer and Scotlan, Stanford man
aged to keep the points alive.
"Their defense was awesome," Dun
ning said. "We really hit some balls in
there but Stanford dug them all." The
Cardinal finished with 131 digs on the
night.
Klein and Oden, who each had 20
kills on the night, started things nicely
for the Cardinal in game four. Each had
kills in a 9-2 opening run. The Tigers
ran into some problems themselves
committing a number of attack errors
during the streak. After their initial
attempts had been muffled, Pacific's
players often fumbled the ball com
pletely.
"They were just not used to having a
lot of balls coming back at them," Shaw
said.
But while the offense slowed, Pacific
fought hard to commandeer the net
defensively. Scotlan recorded one of her
11 blocks to charge the team on a mini
rally. Stanford's Cooper returned the
favor with a solo block at 10-4. Setter
Carrie Feldman served an ace at 12-6 as
the Cardinal coasted in.
