# Stanford scores on itself in fiasco
## Speedy Dons squash Card booters 
### Brad Cleveringa Staff writer 
Speed and defense. The Uni
versity of San Fransisco had the
two, and Stanford didn't.
It quickly became apparent at
yesterday's soccer game that the
Cardinal was matched up against
a faster and more defensive Dons
team as they lost 3-0 and dropped
to 8-6-6.
"We came out flat, and they
came out fast," explained senior
midfielder Tim Keyes.

Cardinal

With the game just six minutes
old, USF's forward Angelo Sablo
made a run through the back line
of the Stanford defense, and the
Cardinal's goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata came out to meet him. But
Krpata wasn't able to prevent the
goal, as Sablo faked a shot to the
keeper's right, dribbled left, and
hit a shot into the open net.
Stanford almost picked it up a
couple minutes later off a throw
in by fullback Brandon Farley, but
they couldn't catch a break. Farley
launched the ball toward the goal.
No one touched it, and the Dons'
keeper Andrew Gloskowski dove
backwards for it. He landed just
shy of the goal line, and the Cardi
nal missed a goal by inches.
At the 23:06 mark the Don's
succesfully took advantage of
their opportunity to increase their
lead. Fallback Kris Vipavetz hit a
lofting ball down into the Cardinal
corner, and Sablo outran Keyes
and sweeper Randy Mann. Sablo
took the ball, manuevered around
both Keyes and Mann, and hit a
pass to his teammate Marquis
White at the 18 yardline. White,
the WCC Player of the Week, shot
an unsavable ball into the right
Bide of the net as Krpata dove in
vain.
"They are a really quick team,"
said Krpata. "They were just mov
ing right on by us."
But this wasn't too difficult for
the Dons because the Cardinal
was doing a lot of standing
around. "We seemed a step slow
because we weren't anticipating
the plays," said Coach Colin Lin
dores. "We were only reacting to
the action. The whole dike was
full of holes."
This was particularly apparent
as the Cardinal moved in on the
Dons' goal. With 21 minutes left

in the first period, Farley
launched another one of his
patented throw-ins towards the
Dons' net. It rebounded off keeper
Gloskowski and directly in front
of the net. No one was there to hit
the ball, and the Cardinal missed
a golden opportunity.
"There were a couple times
that we should have
Farley's plays, but we couldn't,"
noted Lindores. "Their keeper
couldn't hold the ball, but we were
flatter than a board."
Even though Stanford was
trailing 2-0, Lindores was still
optimistic about the second
period. "I told the players that we
could catch them, but if we gave
up an early goal in the second
period we would be dead."
For some reason, the Cardinal
felt the need to commit suicide.

It was one of those
games you want to
forget. 1

Four and a half minutes into the
second period, Stanford scored a
goal on itself. Sablo made a run
down the sideline and again hit a
cross to White. White, who was
being marked by Keyes, had his
shot blocked. Keyes picked up the
loose ball and decided to hit it
back to Krpata. Keyes passed it to
Krpata's right, and Krpata went
left. The ball went into the net.
Assistant coach Greg Petersen
felt like he was having a night
mare. "I don't know what to say.

It was just one of those games you
dream about and want to forget."
Luckily for Petersen and the
rest of the Cardinal, Krpata kept
the game from getting any worse.
With 29:30 left in the match,
White looked as if he was going to
score another goal. He received a
pass about midfield but stopped
because he thought he was off
sides. The linesman didn't throw
up the flag, so White was off to the
races with All-American Rhett
Harty. Krpata saw that Harty had
litle chance to catch him, so he
charged White. The Dons' for
ward cut left, but Krpata dove and
stole the ball from the senior's
feet.
White, however, didn't let that
stymie his celebration. "This win
over Stanford has to be the best
win for us this year," he said.

taken for two goals. The third USP tally was actually an accidental score by Cardinal Tim Keyes, who

Dons' net. It rebounded off keeper
Gloskowski and directly in front
of the net. No one was there to hit
the ball, and the Cardinal missed
a golden opportunity.
"There were a couple times
that we should have
Farley's plays, but we couldn't,"
noted Lindores. "Their keeper
couldn't hold the ball, but we were
flatter than a board."
Even though Stanford was
trailing 2-0, Lindores was still
optimistic about the second
period. "I told the players that we
could catch them, but if we gave
up an early goal in the second
period we would be dead."
For some reason, the Cardinal
felt the need to commit suicide.

games you want to

Four and a half minutes into the
second period, Stanford scored a
goal on itself. Sablo made a run
down the sideline and again hit a
cross to White. White, who was
being marked by Keyes, had his
shot blocked. Keyes picked up the
loose ball and decided to hit it
back to Krpata. Keyes passed it to
Krpata's right, and Krpata went
left. The ball went into the net.
Assistant coach Greg Petersen
felt like he was having a night
mare. "I don't know what to say.

It was just one of those games you
dream about and want to forget."
Luckily for Petersen and the
rest of the Cardinal, Krpata kept
the game from getting any worse.
With 29:30 left in the match,
White looked as if he was going to
score another goal. He received a
pass about midfield but stopped
because he thought he was off
sides. The linesman didn't throw
up the flag, so White was off to the
races with All-American Rhett
Harty. Krpata saw that Harty had
litle chance to catch him, so he
charged White. The Dons' for
ward cut left, but Krpata dove and
stole the ball from the senior's
feet.
White, however, didn't let that
stymie his celebration. "This win
over Stanford has to be the best
win for us this year," he said.

In a nightmarish game against the USF Dons, Stanford's men's soccer team failed to score while being
taken for two goals. The third USP tally was actually an accidental score by Cardinal Tim Keyes, who
mlscommunlcated on a pass with goalie Kyle Krpata.
Speed and defense. The Uni
versity of San Fransisco had the
two, and Stanford didn't.
It quickly became apparent at
yesterday's soccer game that the
Cardinal was matched up against
a faster and more defensive Dons
team as they lost 3-0 and dropped
to 8-6-6.
"We came out flat, and they
came out fast," explained senior
midfielder Tim Keyes.

Cardinal

With the game just six minutes
old, USF's forward Angelo Sablo
made a run through the back line
of the Stanford defense, and the
Cardinal's goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata came out to meet him. But
Krpata wasn't able to prevent the
goal, as Sablo faked a shot to the
keeper's right, dribbled left, and
hit a shot into the open net.
Stanford almost picked it up a
couple minutes later off a throw
in by fullback Brandon Farley, but
they couldn't catch a break. Farley
launched the ball toward the goal.
No one touched it, and the Dons'
keeper Andrew Gloskowski dove
backwards for it. He landed just
shy of the goal line, and the Cardi
nal missed a goal by inches.
At the 23:06 mark the Don's
succesfully took advantage of
their opportunity to increase their
lead. Fallback Kris Vipavetz hit a
lofting ball down into the Cardinal
corner, and Sablo outran Keyes
and sweeper Randy Mann. Sablo
took the ball, manuevered around
both Keyes and Mann, and hit a
pass to his teammate Marquis
White at the 18 yardline. White,
the WCC Player of the Week, shot
an unsavable ball into the right
Bide of the net as Krpata dove in
vain.
"They are a really quick team,"
said Krpata. "They were just mov
ing right on by us."
But this wasn't too difficult for
the Dons because the Cardinal
was doing a lot of standing
around. "We seemed a step slow
because we weren't anticipating
the plays," said Coach Colin Lin
dores. "We were only reacting to
the action. The whole dike was
full of holes."
This was particularly apparent
as the Cardinal moved in on the
Dons' goal. With 21 minutes left

in the first period, Farley
launched another one of his
patented throw-ins towards the
Dons' net. It rebounded off keeper
Gloskowski and directly in front
of the net. No one was there to hit
the ball, and the Cardinal missed
a golden opportunity.
"There were a couple times
that we should have
Farley's plays, but we couldn't,"
noted Lindores. "Their keeper
couldn't hold the ball, but we were
flatter than a board."
Even though Stanford was
trailing 2-0, Lindores was still
optimistic about the second
period. "I told the players that we
could catch them, but if we gave
up an early goal in the second
period we would be dead."
