# An unemployed 1990 grad: Jennifer Azzi
## 
### 
Today being Halloween,
that singular date on the
calendar when it's okay
to talk about horrible and terri
fying things, I'm going to tell
you about every Stanford
senior's (including this one's)
worst nightmare â€” unemploy
ment.
Those of you with Class of
'91 key chains and liberal arts
degrees can stop cringing and
holding up your index fingers
in the shape of a crucifix now.
It's not even November yet.
Chill.

But sit down by the (Big
Game Bon) fire here and I'll
tell you a story about someone
from the Class of 1990 who is
currently struggling with life
after Stanford. It just might
make all of you seniors feel a
little bit better to know that
this kind of thing can happen
to the best and brightest. Then
again, it might make you feel
even worse.
You see, Jennifer Azzi can't
get a job.
Behind that simple fact is a
very complicated story about
the double-standard of college
athletics, money and power,
and missed opportunities. It is
a story that has been told
before, but contains a special
twist in that what has hap
pened to Azzi, in a way, could
happen to any of us.
Flashback to April, 1990.
Jennifer Azzi holds aloft the
NCAA Championship trophy
that she and her Stanford
teammates have just captured
with an 88-81 win over
Auburn. Fans from her home
state of Tennessee stand and
applaud as the best women's
college basketball player in the
country smiles in triumph. She
is on top of the world.
The scene suddenly switches
to late October, 1990. The
defending champion Cardinal
are back on the practice floor,
getting ready for their big sea
son-opening matchup with
Tennessee in Knoxville.
Dressed in sweats and watch
ing from the sidelines is Azzi,

looking for all the world as if
she is just waiting for someone
to ask her to play.
What's wrong with this pic
ture? Why is Azzi watching the
world, instead of the other way
around?
There are a lot of explana
tions. For starters, it is
because Azzi is a woman.
There are currently no profes
sional basketball leagues for
women in this country. While
the National Basketball Associ
ation (for men) booms, attract
ing sell-out crowds and big tele
vision dollars, no one has been
willing to gamble with a
women's league. Jennifer Azzi
was the best women's basket
ball player coming out of school
last year, and no one wanted
her.
If there was such a thing as
a professional draft for women,
it is more than likely that Azzi
would have been the top pick.
She had received every award
that was given for her sport.
She had guided her team to the
title.
But there is no draft. While
the newspaper last week car
ried details of the multi-million
dollar contract that the NBA's
top draft pick, Derrick Cole
man, had just signed, Azzi
stood on the sidelines. She
watched, and she waited.
Azzi is waiting for word on a
contract that her agent is nego
tiating with a team in the
women's pro league in Italy.
There have been some prob
lems. She has been waiting for
several months now, watching
the season start without her,
trying to stay in shape, to stay
ready. It seems that every time
she thinks she's finally going to
get a chance to play, there's
another delay.
"They've been stringing me
along," she said last Friday. "I
wasn't happy with my agent
the first time, but now I feel
like I have things worked out,
and I hope to be over there
within the next couple weeks."
This is the awkward time
for the just-graduated
seniors, when the leaves
turn color and school is back in
full swing. Many are still
around, working in the library,
going to football games, exist
ing in the limbo between school
and the real world.
