# An unemployed 1990 grad: Jennifer Azzi
## 
### 
Today being Halloween,
that singular date on the
calendar when it's okay
to talk about horrible and terri
fying things, I'm going to tell
you about every Stanford
senior's (including this one's)
worst nightmare — unemploy
ment.
Those of you with Class of
'91 key chains and liberal arts
degrees can stop cringing and
holding up your index fingers
in the shape of a crucifix now.
It's not even November yet.
Chill.

But sit down by the (Big
Game Bon) fire here and I'll
tell you a story about someone
from the Class of 1990 who is
currently struggling with life
after Stanford. It just might
make all of you seniors feel a
little bit better to know that
this kind of thing can happen
to the best and brightest. Then
again, it might make you feel
even worse.
You see, Jennifer Azzi can't
get a job.
Behind that simple fact is a
very complicated story about
the double-standard of college
athletics, money and power,
and missed opportunities. It is
a story that has been told
before, but contains a special
twist in that what has hap
pened to Azzi, in a way, could
happen to any of us.
Flashback to April, 1990.
Jennifer Azzi holds aloft the
NCAA Championship trophy
that she and her Stanford
teammates have just captured
with an 88-81 win over
Auburn. Fans from her home
state of Tennessee stand and
applaud as the best women's
college basketball player in the
country smiles in triumph. She
is on top of the world.
The scene suddenly switches
to late October, 1990. The
defending champion Cardinal
are back on the practice floor,
getting ready for their big sea
son-opening matchup with
Tennessee in Knoxville.
Dressed in sweats and watch
ing from the sidelines is Azzi,

looking for all the world as if
she is just waiting for someone
to ask her to play.
What's wrong with this pic
ture? Why is Azzi watching the
world, instead of the other way
around?
There are a lot of explana
tions. For starters, it is
because Azzi is a woman.
There are currently no profes
sional basketball leagues for
women in this country. While
the National Basketball Associ
ation (for men) booms, attract
ing sell-out crowds and big tele
vision dollars, no one has been
willing to gamble with a
women's league. Jennifer Azzi
was the best women's basket
ball player coming out of school
last year, and no one wanted
her.
If there was such a thing as
a professional draft for women,
it is more than likely that Azzi
would have been the top pick.
She had received every award
that was given for her sport.
She had guided her team to the
title.
But there is no draft. While
the newspaper last week car
ried details of the multi-million
dollar contract that the NBA's
top draft pick, Derrick Cole
man, had just signed, Azzi
stood on the sidelines. She
watched, and she waited.
Azzi is waiting for word on a
contract that her agent is nego
tiating with a team in the
women's pro league in Italy.
There have been some prob
lems. She has been waiting for
several months now, watching
the season start without her,
trying to stay in shape, to stay
ready. It seems that every time
she thinks she's finally going to
get a chance to play, there's
another delay.
"They've been stringing me
along," she said last Friday. "I
wasn't happy with my agent
the first time, but now I feel
like I have things worked out,
and I hope to be over there
within the next couple weeks."
This is the awkward time
for the just-graduated
seniors, when the leaves
turn color and school is back in
full swing. Many are still
around, working in the library,
going to football games, exist
ing in the limbo between school
and the real world.

Like many fresh graduates,
Azzi took advantage of the sum
mer to complete an exciting
internship, of sorts. While her
classmates took jobs at high-pow
ered law and computer firms, Azzi
was travelling the globe with the
U.S. National Team. She played

with and against the best in the
world, and the team won both the
World Championships and the
Goodwill Games.
But, like almost all good
internships, there was no offer of
long-term employment at the end
of the summer. "Get some more
experience," is the commonly
supplied reason. "Come back to us
in a few years."
As fall sets in, Azzi finds her

self at the mercy of a job market
that has so far been bare. She had
initially ruled out playing in
Japan, where national teammate
and former Louisiana Tech star
Venus Lacey chose to go. By the
time Azzi reconsidered, the dead
line to receive a working visa had
passed. So she has worked at a
camp in Idaho, spent time bounc
ing back and forth between her
home in Oak Ridge, Tennessee

and here in Palo Alto, and is now
considering her future.
"If I do stay (in the United
States), there's a chance of get
ting a job here and then doing
some broadcasting," Azzi said.
What she wants is the experi
ence that will get her hired back
by her summer employer, in time
for the 1992 Olympic Team. But
the sharp-shooting guard won't
get it here. "[The Olympics] is def
initely out there, but I have to be
playing during the year in order to
stay competitive."
One can't help wondering
what Azzi would give to be
out there on the Maples
Pavilion court, practicing with the
Cardinal. But the former All-
American has put college behind
her. "Obviously I miss the good
friends of mine on the team, but I
don't miss playing for Stanford.

That part of my career is over, and
I did what I wanted to do at Stan
ford. I'm really looking forward to
playing on the professional level."
Azzi is also looking forward to
Italy, after hearing the praise of
friends who studied there. But
with the contract foul-ups and
confusion in negotiating to com
pete in a foreign county, the lack
of an adequate league in the U.S.
has only been magnified.
"Every year you hear rumors
about [a U.S pro league], but until
I see some money or someone who
is really serious about it, I'm not
going to believe it."
But it's not really the money
that's at the bottom of this—Azzi
doesn't handle that part, and she
only knows that she won't be
making near \fie kind of money
that Derrick Coleman will be.
Heck, she's not even sure how to
spell the name of her prospective

team. She just knows that she
wants to play professional basket
ball, and to do that she must leave
the U.S. And so she waits.
If worse comes to worst, Azzi
has her economics degree to fall
back on, and there is the possibil
ity of a job with the athletic
department. Meanwhile, she will
continue to find pick-up games at
Stanford and work out, as she
waits for the magic word to come.
Azzi lives with the hope that she
could be on a plane to Italy tomor
row, or the next day.
But right now, Jennifer Azzi is
using the same hand she signs
autographs with to write "Occu
pation — none" on her forms.
Through no fault of her own, she
is unemployed.
Kind of scary, isn't it?
