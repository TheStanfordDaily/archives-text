# Stanford, WSU face like seasons
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
"I'm not at all happy with the
way things have gone this season.
Our goal was to go to a bowl game,
but we got knocked out of that
pretty early. Then it was to have a
winning season, but that's looking
dim.
"There are some encouraging
things but I'm definitely not satis
fied."
Stanford coach Denny Green?
Nope.
Sounding awfully like his Palo
Alto counterpart, Washington
State coach Mike Price is disap
pointed with the season his 3-5
Cougars are having. Lots of tal
ent, some good moments, but just
not getting it done. No consis
tency.
If you think you've heard this
all before, you have.
WSU and Stanford have had
amazingly similar seasons, and it
isn't because they've played better
than expected.
Not exploiting opportunities,
surrendering wins, failing to put
together an entire game of well
played, driven football. The list
goes on, for both.
When the squads square off at
Stanford Stadium Saturday, it's
going to be which half can finally
put it together — or get it more
together than the other side.
"Lately our offense has been
going in the right direction, but
we need to put it together for 60
minutes," Price said. "We haven't
done that yet this year."

Funny, neither has Stanford.
Though each squad has its own
causes, explanations and mishaps,
both have had the same results.
And both are looking to reverse
the trend this weekend.
Neither has played well in a
while. Stanford has lost its last
three and has had trouble
sustaining drives. WSU is coming
off a 42-34 defeat at Arizona, and
also had trouble keeping both
UCLA and USC out of the end
zone.
For Stanford, as well as for
WSU, a victory could help end the
season on a positive note, and give
the program a boost for next year.
Which means that both want
the victory pretty badly.
"It's really going to be a dog
fight — two programs scrapping
for respectability in a tough con
ference," Price said. "It's not on
national TY but for for these two
teams that meet on Saturday it's
damn important to them."
Stanford's nemesis the past
few weeks has been offense, or
lack of it. It has scored only 38
points over the past three games.
None last week.
"It's a combination of every
one," said offensive guard Brian
Cassidy. "You can't put your fin
ger on any one facet of the offense.
We just need to come together. We
need to get back the hard-hitting
style we played at the beginning of
the season."
Scoring isn't the problem for
the Cougars. They're doing just
fine offensively behind the arm of
true freshman Drew Bledsoe, a

three-week old substitution for
benched senior Brad Gossen.The
Cougars are third in the Pac-10 in
scoring offense.
No, WSU has it relatively
together when it has the ball. The
problem is when its opponent has
control. The Cougars are having
difficulty keeping their opponents
out of their endzone. They are
eighth in scoring defense. It
doesn't matter if the attack is on
the ground or in the air. Washing
ton State can't stop it. Opponents
have averaged 427 yards a game.
Which is a good sign for the
Cardinal, who once again is trying
to gets its talented running attack
going. For the first time in five
contests, Stanford is not going up
against a highly-ranked run
defense. Maybe Glyn Milburn,
Tommy Vardell and Jon Volpe will
actually have the opportunity to
power for the yards they've been
itching to gain all season.
If they do, they had better
make the most of it, because
according to Green, Stanford has
to get its ground game going if it
hopes to chalk up its third W of
the season.
"We have to be able to run the
ball," Green said. "Cal and USC
got the advantage by their ability
to run the ball [against Washing
ton State]. They play a pure four
man line, so we have to be able to
come out and get off the line of
scrimmage.
"We're heading into this game
with the intent of running the
ball."
