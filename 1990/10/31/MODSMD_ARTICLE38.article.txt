# Field hockey looks to NCAAs

Another successful regular season for Stanford
athletics drew to a close Sunday as the field
hockey team played its last game. With the regu
lar season behind them, the Cardinal now looks
forward to playing in the NCAA tournament.
One of only 12 teams nationwide to compete in
the tournament, Stanford gained its post-season
berth by compiling a 5-0-1 record in the Northern
Pacific Conference. While all twelve seeds have
not yet been announced, the Cardinal will not be
among the top four and will therefore not host
any of the upcoming contests. Rather, the team
will travel to the campus of one of the top four
seeds, which will probably be a site in the Mid-
West.
Indeed, many details of the tournament are
still uncertain. While some teams like Stanford
completed their regular season schedules last
weekend, others finish regular season play later
this week. Therefore, find decisions concerning
seeds and venues are not expected until next
week.
Some tentative dates have been announced.
The first round of regionals will start on either
November 7 or 8, with the second round following
on November 10 and 11. And one date is certain:
the Final Four will take place on November 17
and 18 at Rutgers.
While the Cardinal's season record is 9-3-1, the
team has not played against top-10 competition
this year. Coach Sheryl Johnson considers Provi
dence the best opponent that Stanford has faced.
Johnson places them in the lower half of the top
20. Stanford lost to Providence 5-0.
Although the score hints at domination, that
was hardly the case. And Cardinal players point
out that it is no reason to be intimidated going
into a tournament against the best teams in the
nation.

"They didn't dominate us," states senior right
midfielder Clare Stephens. "We definitely can
play with these [highly ranked] teams. We defi
nitely belong up there."
Senior centerback Trish McJennett shares the
attitude of her teammate and fellow tri-captain.
"We didn't have the fire and the spark we've
had in other games," she notes. "We've come a
long way since we played them. We know we can
play at that level."
Johnson is also confident in the Cardinal's
ability. She notes the marked improvement over
last year, and points to the presence of top scorers
Sarah Hallock and Michelle Beynet as a primary
explanation.
The emergence of a strong sense of teamwork
has been even more important to the Cardinal's
improvement.
"The team is playing well and really together,"
comments Johnson. She further maintains that
better teamwork is "definitely" the main factor
for the team's improved record.
Another factor has been the absence of injury.
Going into post-season competition, the team is
essentially at full strength. The only notable
injury is to McJennett, who is playing with ten
donitis in her left knee. While the iryury does not
effect her overall play, she does consider it a nui
sance.
"It's been kind of frustrating," she explains.
"It only gets better with rest."
Beyond the encouraging improvement, the
team is particularly pleased with their most
recent performance against Princeton. The 4-2
win was an auspicious transition to the post-sea
son. In the words of McJennett, the game was
"one of the highlights of our season."
"It's a good step toward the regionals," says
Coach Johnson.
And Stephens is even more enthusiastic.
"We're peaking," she says. "We had a great final
game. Everyone is excited."
