# ASSU Senate committee presents bill on new alcohol policy
## 
### Steve Mitzenmacher Staff writer 
In an attempt to influence Stanford's
alcohol policy, a student committee pre
sented a proposal last night intended to
preserve a spirit of student responsibility
toward drinking while fulfilling federal
requirements.
During an informal, open forum, the
ASSU Senate Student Affairs Committee
presented a bill outlining a tentative alco
hol policy proposal. The bill contains sev
eral specific recommendations, including:
• Dorm funds collected through the
University should not be used for pur

chasing alcohol;
• The role of resident assistants and
resident fellows should be as educators,
not police officers;
• It should be left up to the discretion
of faculty, staff and students to report
infractions;
• Freshmen and transfer students
should participate in a seminar on alcohol
awareness in the first two weeks of the
year; and
• Students should not make alcohol
the focus of all events.
Bill authors and committee co-chairs
Beth Morgan and Mike Curry presided
and said they would use student feedback

to revise the bill. Scheduled to be pre
sented to the ASSU Senate tomorrow, the
bill, if passed, will be sent to administra
tors by the end of the week as an official
recommendation.
The bill does not attempt to create a
"laundry list" of punishments for student
offenders, but leaves such decisions up to
RAs and RFs.
"The main purpose of this bill is to tar
get the alcohol misuser and abuser," Mor
gan said. ' The greatest difficulty will be
in enforcing the new policy."
"We wanted to give all students the
opportunity to help us in the creation of
this bill," Cuny said. "We hope that this

bill will provide the administration with a
guiding principle and philosophy in inter
preting and implementing the policy."
The bill responds to the controversy
created by Stanford's compliance with
the federal Drug-Free Schools and Com
munities Act. The act stipulates that uni
versities receiving federal funds expressly
prohibit illegal use of alcohol and drugs
on campus. But the act leaves specific
methods of enforcement up to universi
ties.
According to the bill, it presents gen
eral guidelines which will "hopefully
emphasize the importance of individual
student responsibility and decision mak

ing found in the Fundamental Standard."
Both Morgan and Curry said they were
disappointed at the small turnout at the
forum. "We have done our best to get as
much feedback as we could, but time con
straints limited us greatly," Morgan
explained.
Small turnouts have been a problem
throughout the policy debate. "We
shouldn't have been surprised after the
small turnout of responses when Diana
Conklin asked for student opinions on the
policy," Curry said.
Time constraints will also limit discus-
