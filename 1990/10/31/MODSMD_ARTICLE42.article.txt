Stanford Police arrested fresh
man Mark Freeland early Friday
morning for allegedly attempting
to enter a private residence on
campus.
Freeland, 19, was charged with
prowling and possession of false
identification.
He initially faced felony
charges of attempted burglary and
resisting arrest, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. Those charges were
later reduced to prowling, a misde
meanor.
Police officials said the charges
were reduced because there was
no evidence that Freeland had
intent to break in and steal.
"He was so inebriated that he
could not find his way home,"

Nieraeyer said. "[Freeland] did
not know where he was."
Police said they found Freeland
trying to enter the residence on
Alvarado Court about 4:80 a.m.
after responding to a call from the
resident. Alvarado Court is locat
ed in an area of faculty housing on
the south end of campus.
Freeland tried to escape but
was quickly caught, police said.
Niemeyer said police also dis
covered Freeland was carrying a
fake ID after arresting him.
Freeland was released on his
own recognizance pending a hear
ing at the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court. No date for the
hearing has been set.
The Office of Judicial Affairs
has no plans to become involved in
the case, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
