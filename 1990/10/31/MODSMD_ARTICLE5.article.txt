# Controversy centers on flier, article

### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
A controversy has developed around a recent
Stanford Review article on the University's new
domestic partners policy and the reaction to it
among members of the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community.
The Review's Oct. 22 cover story, titled "Married
Students Oppose 'Domestic Partners,'" also carried
artwork that some considered offensive.
Several individuals distributed fliers last week in
White Plaza and hung a large banner at Tresidder
Union in opposition to the story. None of the partici
pants have identified themselves.
The fliers and banner featured a picture of a
woman covering the eyes of a girl who was reading
the Oct. 22 issue of The Review. The woman was say
ing, "Child, I don't know if I want you to read The
Stanford Review and grow up all bigoted and hate
ful."
Both fliers and banner continued, "Child, I want
you to see public displays of affection — all kinds:
same-sex, inter-racial, different-sex, older couples —
so you can see, learn that love knows no bound
aries."
The flier also contained an additional paragraph
stating, "The Nazis gassed thousands of 'queers'
after rounding them up in concentration camps —
along with Jews, Blacks, gypsies. . .. Does The

Review want to do the same thing?"
According to Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center officer Debbie Jue, "The flier and banner
were created and distributed by members of [the gay
and lesbian communityl . .. acting as individuals."
"There was no support from the community cen
ter," Jue said. "Any actions taken are their own
actions."
In a move designed to smooth relations between
the two groups, members of the community center
and The Review staff held a closed meeting last
night.
Jue said the purpose of the meeting was to talk
about the allegations of The Review and the fliers.
Details of the meeting were not available last night.
Review editors said they stand behind the story. "I
was surprised [at the reactionl. I didn't think the
article was offensive," said Review Editor in Chief
Daryl Joseffer.
"People were waiting to attack us," he said.
Joseffer said 800 copies of The Review disap
peared from the distribution box in front of the post
office last Monday and Tuesday. "Copies were stolen
immediately," he said.
With regard to the fliers themselves, Joseffer said,
"I think being called Nazis and all this other garbage
violates the fighting words [amendment to the Fun
damental Standard]." Some Review editors may seek

to have those responsible for the
banner charged with a Funda
mental Standard violation, he
added.
Joseffer said he called Program
and Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Ramsey-Perez last
Wednesday to discuss the banner,
flier and stolen copies of the
newspaper.
Ramsey-Perez said, "They
wanted my judgment on 'Is it
moral and proper for people to do

that?' I said I'm not a lawyer, and
I'd look in on it."
Ramsey-Perez said he talked to
officers of the LGBCC, who said
none of its funds were used to
produce the banner or fliers. "It
was a political expression of an
individual, not an official function
of the LGBCC," Ramsey-Perez
said.
Joseffer said The Review arti
cle itself was written by author
Barb Romney "as it was
assigned."
"It was a campus reaction
piece, Romney said. "That means
I was getting the general reaction
of the campus."

Romney said she interviewed
about 30 to 40 people, mainly in
Escondido Village, a primarily
graduate student housing com
plex. Escondido will be one of the
housing areas affected by the new
domestic partners housing policy.
"I went all over Escondido Vil
lage and talked to singles, hetero
sexuals, lesbians, gays, married
families," Romney said. "Each
sector had a different view." She
added that she gave an accurate
representation of her responses in
her article.
But many in the gay, lesbian
and bisexual community disagree.
"The presentation was
slanted," Jue said. "There were
generalizations on both sides.
Jue also noted concern about
the article's cover drawing.
Echoing concerns of other

gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, Jue
said she felt the picture was
"obnoxious."
"The implication from the
drawing is that parents want to
shield their children," Jue said. "I
don't think that's very neutral.
The picture echoes only one opin
ion in the whole article. There are
quite a few other opinions there,
and the picture doesn't show
that."
Joseffer disagreed. "I felt it
was a neutral statement," he said.
Joseffer wrote a follow-up edi
torial in Monday's Review on
what he termed "homosexual
activists .. . protesting against a
balanced news article." He said,
"It's basically an attack on our
freedom of expression."
Jue disagreed, saying, "We do
not condone censorship."
