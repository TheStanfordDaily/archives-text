# Controversy centers on flier, article

### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
A controversy has developed around a recent
Stanford Review article on the University's new
domestic partners policy and the reaction to it
among members of the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community.
The Review's Oct. 22 cover story, titled "Married
Students Oppose 'Domestic Partners,'" also carried
artwork that some considered offensive.
Several individuals distributed fliers last week in
White Plaza and hung a large banner at Tresidder
Union in opposition to the story. None of the partici
pants have identified themselves.
The fliers and banner featured a picture of a
woman covering the eyes of a girl who was reading
the Oct. 22 issue of The Review. The woman was say
ing, "Child, I don't know if I want you to read The
Stanford Review and grow up all bigoted and hate
ful."
Both fliers and banner continued, "Child, I want
you to see public displays of affection — all kinds:
same-sex, inter-racial, different-sex, older couples —
so you can see, learn that love knows no bound
aries."
The flier also contained an additional paragraph
stating, "The Nazis gassed thousands of 'queers'
after rounding them up in concentration camps —
along with Jews, Blacks, gypsies. . .. Does The

Review want to do the same thing?"
According to Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center officer Debbie Jue, "The flier and banner
were created and distributed by members of [the gay
and lesbian communityl . .. acting as individuals."
"There was no support from the community cen
ter," Jue said. "Any actions taken are their own
actions."
In a move designed to smooth relations between
the two groups, members of the community center
and The Review staff held a closed meeting last
night.
Jue said the purpose of the meeting was to talk
about the allegations of The Review and the fliers.
Details of the meeting were not available last night.
Review editors said they stand behind the story. "I
was surprised [at the reactionl. I didn't think the
article was offensive," said Review Editor in Chief
Daryl Joseffer.
"People were waiting to attack us," he said.
Joseffer said 800 copies of The Review disap
peared from the distribution box in front of the post
office last Monday and Tuesday. "Copies were stolen
immediately," he said.
With regard to the fliers themselves, Joseffer said,
"I think being called Nazis and all this other garbage
violates the fighting words [amendment to the Fun
damental Standard]." Some Review editors may seek
