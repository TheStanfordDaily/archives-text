# Campbell tries to mesh conservatism, environmentalism
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
Environmentalist and Repub
lican are not words which always
go together, but for Rep. Tom
Campbell, "to be conservative in
economic issues is to be an envi
ronmentalist."
Speaking to a small crowd of
about 30 students in Kresge
Auditorium last night, the theme
of Campbell's talk was "How we
as Republicans can be more
involved environmentally."
Co-sponsored by the Stanford
College Republicans and the
Sierra Club, Campbell's speech
was directed primarily to those of
his own party, but his views
encompass a broad spectrum
intended to appeal to Democrats
as well.
Campbell, first elected to
office in 1988, is facing Demo
cratic challenger Robert Palmer
in the race to represent the 12th
Congressional District, which
includes Stanford.
A Stanford law professor,
Campbell described four crucial
elements of environmental policy
which he feels must be addressed
by Congress. His views are
endorsed by both the Sierra Club
and the League of Conservation
Voters.
The first is population control,
particularly in regard to foreign
aid packages. Limiting the size of

Campbell said he
supports federal
incentives to
develop alterna
tive energy
sources.

the population is vital to assist
ing developing nations with
scarce resources, Campbell said.
He said he favors retracting
the so-called Mexico City rule,
which prohibits U.S. aid to coun
tries that include abortion as an
option in their family planning
programs, a policy Campbell con
siders "shortsighted."
Campbell also discussed his
support for federal incentives to
develop alternative energy
sources. Currently, he said, gas
and oil prices are so low that
energy companies see no need to
explore options that are less
environmentally damaging, such
as natural gas or solar power.
Raising taxes on petroleum
products would induce compa
nies and consumers to gradually
switch to other fuels, he said.
Another environmental con
cern is clean water, particularly
in California, the state with the
most Superfund toxic waste

sites. Several such sites are on
Stanford property.
Campbell criticized the cur
rent policy, which does not reim
burse the party that has cleaned
a toxic waste site if a different
party is deemed responsible for
the damage. This policy leads
companies into court to deter
mine who is responsible, rather
than out into the field to clean up
the mess, he said.
Campbell also criticized water
use in California, saying 90 per
cent of water goes to irrigate
crops, many of which are unnec
essary and in the desert. This
creates a surplus of food which
must then be sent overseas at a
loss to the government. It also
contaminates potable water by
causing hard minerals from the
desert soil to seep into the water
table, he added.
In closing, Campbell said, "Air
is the greatest achievement of
the 101st Congress."
Measures need to be taken to
insure that those who pollute
also pay the costs of their
actions, he said, adding that
small industrial polluters should
not be exempt from this rule.
Government should also create
incentives for consumers to pur
chase and use less polluting cars
and fuels, either through tax
increases or mandated use of
alternative fuels.

After covering his environ
mental views, Campbell
answered questions from the
audience and described several
issues on which he differs from
President Bush and other con
servative Republicans. For exam

ple, he noted his support for the
recently-vetoed Civil Rights Bill,
gun-control legislation and his
strong pro-choice record.
Addressing the Republicans in
the audience, Campbell said the
party is at a crossroads, divided

into supporters of big-business
and those, like Campbell, who
are "willing to say 'You must pay
for what you do.'"
Campbell said it is important
to "work together, whatever our
political party."
