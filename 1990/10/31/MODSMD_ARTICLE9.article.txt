### Anita Presser 
Dr. Robert Alway, former dean of the
School of Medicine, died Friday at his home in
Oak Harbor, Washington. He was 77.
Alway served as dean from 1957 to 1964,
during which time the Medical School
achieved national prominence. In 1959 he
presided over the then-controversial reloca
tion of the school to the Stanford campus from
San Francisco, where it had been since 1908.
During his tenure, Alway also recruited an
array of new faculty, believing that the San
Francisco school had been weakened by exten
sive scholastic inbreeding. Most of the depart
ment heads resigned when he became dean.
The new faculty included two Nobel laure
ates: biochemist Arthur Kornberg and geneti
cist Joshua Lederberg. Through Alway's lead
ership, several innovations were added, such
as a new department of genetics and a five
year curriculum.
The Medical School administration build
ing was named in Alway's honor in 1988. At

the time, Dr. Avram Goldstein, professor
emertus of pharmacology, described Alway as
the dean who "transformed the Medical
School into a leader in biomedical research by
appointing outstanding people in key places."
"Excellence was the key," Goldstein added.
"The best person for every position."
After stepping down in 1964, Alway served
as acting chair of the department of pediatrics
and chief of staff of Stanford Hospital. He
retired in 1977.
Alway graduated from the University of
Minnesota Medical School. He first joined the
Stanford medical faculty in 1949 after spend
ing six years at the University of Utah Medical
School. In 1953 Alway became the head of
pediatrics at the University of Colorado.
Because of the contemplated relocation of
the medical school to campus, he returned to
Stanford to become the pediatrics department
head.
He is survived by his wife, Sophie, three
daughters and two sons.


Dr. Robert Alway
