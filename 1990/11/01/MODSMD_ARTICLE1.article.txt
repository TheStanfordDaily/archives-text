# Lung operation ends happily
## 
### Peter Cousins 
The recipient of the world's
first lung transplant from a liv
ing donor said she felt "good"
today, just a week after the oper
ation at Stanford Hospital in
which she received a third of
one of her mother's lungs.
Mazie Bond, 12, and her
mother, Versell Johnson, 45,
spoke at a press conference yes
terday afternoon about how
they felt before and after the
landmark surgery.

Before the operation, Bond
said she was "hoping [to] get
i better.
[The doctors] came in the
night before and asked me 'Do
you have any more questions?
Do you have any more ques
' tions?'" Bond said she had none.
But the next morning as she
was being prepared for surgery,
questions rushed into her head.
She wondered where she would
be when she woke up and
whether her mother would
come out of surgery before she

did. "I got real scared," Bond
said.
When asked how it felt to
have a piece of her mother
inside of her, she said, "It feels
weird — a good weird."
Johnson saw the transplant
as the only way she could aid
her daughter. "For the last 11
years I've been grasping at
straws to help Mazie," she said.
When the transplant became an
option. Johnson said she

decided "probably immediately."
When asked how she felt about
losing part of her lung to help her
dying daughter, she responded,
"I'd do it again tomorrow."
Bond suffered from a condition
connected to her premature birth.
Lung damage caused by a respira
tor used to sustain her early in
life resulted in high blood pres
sure in her lungs and related
symptoms.
Prior to the surgery she was
experiencing shortness of breath
and showed signs of heart failure.
"If she did not have the lung
transplant, it would have been 12
to 18 months before she died,"
said Stanford cardiovascular sur
geon Vaughn Starnes, who per
formed the operation.
Both Bond and her mother
expect big changes. "I want to
swim, roller skate and run with
my dog," said Bond. "I couldn't
run before the operation. Some
times I was tired, and I couldn't
walk around the mall (for) a long
time."
She said she could walk only a
block at her speed and "not even
half a block" at a normal child's
pace before running out of
breath.
Bond expects big changes at
school. She noted that she "never
took gym class in school" due to
her lung condition, but now she
might even try out to be a cheer
leader. Her mother thinks Bond
will continue to do well in school,

but will no longer be severely
restricted in her physical activity.
Starnes echoed those feelings.
"Both patients are unique indi
viduals," he remarked and added
of Bond that "we couldn't have
selected a better first patient."
Starnes went on in the press
conference to describe the opera
tion. The surgery entailed replac
ing Bond's entire right lung with
a portion of her mother's right
lung. Even though both of Bond's
lungs are damaged, the doctor
noted that the single new lung
should be sufficient for a healthy
life.
He observed that the proce
dure was "the first of its type"
and if proved to be viable should
be of "particular benefit to chil
dren." He estimated there are
between 1,000 and 2,000 children
born each year who are afflicted
with Bond's condition.
Starnes pointed out that "all
medical advances are based on
prior experiences." He said he
wants to make sure that the oper
ation can be performed not only
at Stanford but also at other med
ical centers.
But a great deal of review is
required before this becomes an
everyday procedure, Starnes said.
However, several potential
patients are being evaluated, a
process which takes three to four
months.
Still, Starnes said he "would
like to see five or six 'Mazies' in
the next year" so that the proce
dure could be reduced from a
"hyperexperimental" to an exper
imental operation.

A week after lung transplant surgery, Mazle Bond dresses up as a pumpkin for Halloween and sits

decided "probably immediately."
When asked how she felt about
losing part of her lung to help her
dying daughter, she responded,
"I'd do it again tomorrow."
Bond suffered from a condition
connected to her premature birth.
Lung damage caused by a respira
tor used to sustain her early in
life resulted in high blood pres
sure in her lungs and related
symptoms.
Prior to the surgery she was
experiencing shortness of breath
and showed signs of heart failure.
"If she did not have the lung
transplant, it would have been 12
to 18 months before she died,"
said Stanford cardiovascular sur
geon Vaughn Starnes, who per
formed the operation.
Both Bond and her mother
expect big changes. "I want to
swim, roller skate and run with
my dog," said Bond. "I couldn't
run before the operation. Some
times I was tired, and I couldn't
walk around the mall (for) a long
time."
She said she could walk only a
block at her speed and "not even
half a block" at a normal child's
pace before running out of
breath.
Bond expects big changes at
school. She noted that she "never
took gym class in school" due to
her lung condition, but now she
might even try out to be a cheer
leader. Her mother thinks Bond
will continue to do well in school,

but will no longer be severely
restricted in her physical activity.
Starnes echoed those feelings.
"Both patients are unique indi
viduals," he remarked and added
of Bond that "we couldn't have
selected a better first patient."
Starnes went on in the press
conference to describe the opera
tion. The surgery entailed replac
ing Bond's entire right lung with
a portion of her mother's right
lung. Even though both of Bond's
lungs are damaged, the doctor
noted that the single new lung
should be sufficient for a healthy
life.
He observed that the proce
dure was "the first of its type"
and if proved to be viable should
be of "particular benefit to chil
dren." He estimated there are
between 1,000 and 2,000 children
born each year who are afflicted
with Bond's condition.
Starnes pointed out that "all
medical advances are based on
prior experiences." He said he
wants to make sure that the oper
ation can be performed not only
at Stanford but also at other med
ical centers.
But a great deal of review is
required before this becomes an
everyday procedure, Starnes said.
However, several potential
patients are being evaluated, a
process which takes three to four
months.
Still, Starnes said he "would
like to see five or six 'Mazies' in
the next year" so that the proce
dure could be reduced from a
"hyperexperimental" to an exper
imental operation.
