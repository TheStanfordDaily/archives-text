More killed over shrine dispute
AYODHYA, India (AP) — Thousands of Hindu fundamental
ists failed in a new attempt yesterday to storm an ancient shrine
claimed by Moslems, and at least 24 more people died in violence
sparked by the dispute.
A government minister resigned to protest Prime Minister VP
Singh's attempts to block construction of a Hindu temple on the
disputed site, deepening the crisis in his beleaguered coalition.
Armed paramilitary troops blocked about 5,000 Hindus from
attempting to re-enter the mosque in Ayodhya, which has been
the center of a decades-old dispute between India's Hindu mtyor
ity and Moslem minority.
The dispute has killed at least 170 people in the past eight days
and pushed Singh's 11-month-old government to the verge of col
lapse. The Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party with
drew support from the governing coalition last month to protest
government policy on the temple project.
Colombia may talk with cartel
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The interior minister indicated
yesterday the government might be ready to hear the demands of
the Medellin cocaine cartel in hopes of freeing seven kidnapped
journalists.
Julio Cesar Sanchez said his government is prepared to "listen
to the complaints even of those who find themselves outside the
law."
The interior minister's statement, aired over the RCN radio
network, could signal a reversal in the government policy of not
negotiating with drug traffickers.
The cartel issued a statement Tuesday saying it kidnapped the
journalists and Marina Montoya, the sister of Colombia's ambas
sador to Canada. It 'hreatened to kill its hostages if the govern
ment launches a new offensive against drug traffickers.
National health care plan needed
WASHINGTON (AP) — An expected doubling of health care
costs in the next 10 years makes it more important than ever that
the government coordinate a national health care system, private
groups said yesterday.
"We've got to do something to get health care costs under con
trol or health care is going to be unaffordable for millions of
Americans," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA
Foundation.
The report, which lists state-by-state health care spending,
identified Massachusetts as the largest per-capita spender. There,
state and federal governments, residents, employers and other
private sources will pay an estimated $3,031 for every man,
woman and child in the state this year.
