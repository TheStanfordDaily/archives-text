# Bush is 'fed up' with hostage ordeal
## Iraq denies charges of mistreatment, says U.S. looking for excuse to attack 
### 
(AP) — President Bush said
yesterday he was fed up with Sad
dam Hussein's harsh treatment of
U.S. hostages. Iraq later said it
would allow American families to
visit the captives for the holidays.
Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and a British comman
der meanwhile warned the likeli
hood of war in the region was

increasing.
But Iraq's ambassador to the
United States, Mohamed al-
Mashat, said he sought to avoid
bloodshed and reiterated Iraq's
offer to negotiate — if other Mid
dle East conflicts were included on
the agenda. The United States has
rejected any such linkage.
Mubarak said the Persian Gulf

crisis has bec( me so dangerous it
"could explode at any time." And
he urged "our brothers in Iraq" to
realize the danger their Aug. 2
invasion of oil-rich Kuwait has
caused.
The commander of British
forces in the gulf warned that an
attack against Iraq is increasingly
' likely. Air Chief Marshal Sir

Paddy Hine said a joint team
culled from the Royal Air Force,
Royal Navy and Army is develop
ing plans for military strikes.
"Saddam Hussein seems reluc
tant at the moment to accept the
judgment of world opinion," he
said. "It is looking increasingly
unlikely that Saddam Hussein
will withdraw unconditionally
from Kuwait."
Bush said his patience was
wearing thin with Saddam over
the 1,000 American hostages in
Iraq and Kuwait.
"The embassy is being
starved," Bush said of the
besieged U.S. mission in occupied
Kuwait. "The people out there are
not being resupplied.
"Do you think I'm concerned
about it? You're darn right I am.
And what I'm going to do about it
— let's just wait and see, because
I have had it with that kind of
treatment of Americans," Bush
said.
The administration of former
President Reagan used the safety
of Americans as a justification to
invade Grenada in 1983. The
Bush administration also cited
the safety of Americans when he
sent troops to Panama in 1989.
In Baghdad, Information Min
istry Spokesman Latif Jassim said
the United States was spreading
"false reports" on the conditions
of "foreign guests" to seek an
excuse to attack Iraq.
Baghdad calls the hundreds of
Westerners held in Iraq and
Kuwait to deter attack by the
multinational force deployed in
Saudi Arabia "guests."
"I want to tell you that our
guests live in good conditions at
some places better than many
Iraqi families, but Bush perhaps
wants an excuse," Jassim said.
