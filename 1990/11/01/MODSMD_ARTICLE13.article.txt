SACRAMENTO (AP) - Pete
Wilson called for budget reforms
to abolish special protections for
schools and other state programs
yesterday, while Dianne Feinstein
promised to provide health care
insurance for every Californian.
Other campaign develop
ments yesterday involved
announcements of new television
commercials and new charges and
demonstrations triggered by some
commercials already being aired.
Wilson released a new commer
cial in the race for governor fea
turing Feinstein saying that as

mayor of San Francisco, "I did not
leave the city with a deficit. What
there was was a shortfall in rev
enues," while an announcer says
smirkingly "Makes you wonder."
And Feinstein chides Wilson
for attempting to force opponents
of the Proposition 138 logging
industry initiative to stop citing
his opposition to the initiative —
which he declared in an Oct. 7
televised debate — in their televi
sion commercials.
In their personal appearances,
Republican Wilson and Democrat
Feinstein repeated familiar

themes.
"The next governor of Califor
nia is going to have to deal with a
budget process that is thoroughly
distorted by what has been piece
meal efforts over a period of time
that really haven't been part of
any coherent strategy," Wilson
told the Sacramento Press Club.
The Republican senator
declined again to either rule out or
endorse a tax increase, but he said
if one is needed, he considers the
sales tax tD be fairer than raising
state income taxes.
Feinstein launched particularly

strong attacks at Wilson, portray
ing him as beholden to rich special
interests who have contributed to
his campaigns.
Feinstein also cited an incident
in 1985, featured in her television
commercials, in which Wilson was
wheeled into the Senate after an
appendectomy to cast the deciding
vote to freeze Social Security ben
efits.
Feinstein pledged to sign legis
lation within 100 days guarantee
ing health care insurance for
every Californian.
