# Soviet republic launches own economic plan

### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” The Russian parliament
voted yesterday to start a 500-day transition
to a market economy today, putting it on a col
lision course with President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev and the national legislature.
Gorbachev and the Supreme Soviet Legisla
ture agreed Oct. 19 on a compromise economic
rescue plan that is slower and less radical than
the 500-day plan.
Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet
republics, has declared sovereignty from the
central Soviet government. It claims the right
to put its own economic reform plan into effect
on its territory, which covers two-thirds of the
Soviet land mass.
It is unclear who will be obeyed if the Rus
sian government, led by Gorbachev's leading
political rival, Boris Yeltsin, gives economic

orders that contradict the national govern
ment.
Already, the central government has
warned bank officials they will be fired if they
carry out a new Russian republic law creating
independent banks, according to Deputy Rus
sian Premier Gennady Filshin.
The Russian parliament also challenged the
Kremlin by claiming control over the repub
lic's natural resources and other assets,
including state institutions and construction
projects, Tass reported.
It said the legislation was intended to "lay
the foundations for the republic's economic
sovereignty." The bill says the Russian gov
ernment has the right to accredit foreign firms
and control imports and exports from its terri
tory.

Ivan Silaev, the republic's prime minister,
told parliament that a series of proposed laws
would be drafted within the next three weeks.
"Really, all this means is they have started
the clock ticking and underlined their deter
mination to go ahead" with the 500-day plan,
said Shod Muladzhanov, a political commenta
tor for the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda.
"I spent the whole day here asking people
what concrete steps they planned to take, and
no one could give me an answer," he added,
gesturing from a balcony overlooking the par
liament's marble meeting hall.
Grigori Yavlinsky a deputy prime minister
of the Russian republic and one of the authors
of the 500-day plan, told reporters the parlia
ment should set up a committee of economic
advisers to suggest specific measures.
