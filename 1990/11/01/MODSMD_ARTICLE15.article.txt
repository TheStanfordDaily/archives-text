BOSTON (AP) - College
Board trustees announced yes
terday the most sweeping
changes ever in the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, adding some
math questions that aren't
multiple choice and introduc
ing optional essay questions.
Board officials rejected sug
gestions that charges of cul
tural bias prompted the revi
sions in the test used heavily in
deciding who gets into what
college.
The new Scholastic Aptitude
Test, called SAT-I, will be intro
duced in the spring 1994, said
College Board President Don
ald Stewart.
In the language section,
emphasis on reading compre
hension will be increased. Stu
dents will be allowed to use cal
culators in the math section.
The revisions are aimed in
part at reducing students'
reliance on test coaches, Stew
art 3aid.
Critics have long charged
that the SAT — the most
widely used college entrance
exam — was biased, particu
larly against women and
minorities.
"Nothing could be further
from the truth," Stewart said.
"The SAT has been in almost

continual evolution. It has
never been set in concrete.
"The new SAT will combine
the high, academically de
manding standards of the cur
rent tests with revisions that
increase their educational rele
vance and quality for all col
lege-bound students."
Bob SchaefTer, a spokesman
for the group Fair Test and co
author of the book "Standing
up to the SAT," said the
changes fail to solve the prob
lem of the test's bias.
Fair Test and other critics
have claimed that the SAT
tends to cover subjects that
white male and affluent test
takers are more likely to be
familiar with.
Oft-cited examples in the
test include the question "Div
idends are to stockholders as
..." with the answer being
"royalties are to writers," and
the use of words such as
"regatta" and "aria" in the
vocabulary section.
Whites as a group have out
performed minority students,
and males have fared better
than females.
The old SAT had 85 verbal
and 60 math questions. The
SAT-I will have 75-85 verbal
and 55-60 math questions.
