## The
						Big Bad... Band? 
### 
Athletics department
went too far in
suspending the Band

WITH THE SUSPENSION
OF the Band, now the
Department of Athletics
only has the existence of the yell
leaders and the performance of the
football team to be embarrassed
about.
Admittedly, the theme of their
Oregon show may not have been
the embodiment of brilliance.
But suspending the truly incom
parable Band for one to three
games is definitely going over
board.
Performing for an already hos
tile crowd, the Band probably
should have figured out that they
were unlikely to make any new
friends by centering a parody
.around the spotted owl.
To protect the owl from extinc
tion, the federal government is
considering proposals that would
curtail Oregon's timber industry.
Such a move would jeopardize the
economic well-being of many Ore
gonians.
The Band chose this topic as
their focus, mocking lumberjacks
and environmentalists alike. Even
though they took no favorites in
their satire, they were bound to be
hated (and outnumbered) by the
Oregon fans. The Band, after all,
was rooting for Stanford.
The Athletic department, how
ever, thought the Band showed
insensitivity to the home crowd
and placed them on suspension.
Which leaves us befuddled.
Here are some of the most "dis
respectful" lyrics from the Band's
show:
"Mr. Spotted Owl! Mr. Spotted
Owl! Your environment has been

destroyed; your home is now a roll
of Brawny and your family has
flown the coop."
Maybe we better airlift the staff
of Counseling and Psychological
Services to help the Oregonians
through severe emotional shock.
The Band is supposed to rally
Stanford students, and like it or
not, one of the most effective ways
it can accomplish that end is by
poking fun at the opposition. And
nothing the Band said or did
seemed inherently offensive.
OK, so it might have been tact
less. But then again, marching
bands aren't noted for their sub
tlety.
There's a big difference between
slightly tactless and blatantly
offensive.
If the Band were to be repri
manded every time its members
were mildly foolish, the group
would still be suspended for allow
ing Cal to win Big Game in 1982.
Suspension should only be con
sidered as an option when the
Band does something out and out
outrageous. Like the time when
Band members urinated on the
field and spelled out swear words,
or when they marched in"the Fly
ing Genitalia" formation.
The Athletics department's deci
sion will also affect attendance. To
many, a Big Game without the
Band just wouldn't be worth the
trip to Berkeley.
What the Athletics department
should do is lift the suspension
immediately and ask for the Band
to issue an apology to those
offended by its show.
Then it should set up a process
to review its plans for away shows
to prevent the Band from putting
on shows that are actually offen
sive.
Then perhaps the Athletics
department could concentrate on
ending some of its other embar
rassments.
