Students can find common ground to reach multiculturalism

IN LIGHT OF THE UPCOMING stu
dent summit, several members of the
ASSU Senate have drafted the follow
ing statement:
There are those who say that Stan
ford is a paradise, isolated from the "real
world." But we face the same questions
and problems that any diverse commu
nity faces.
In introducing Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev last spring, Donald
Kennedy said, "We are, like your great
nation, a complex and diverse society
trying our best to learn to cope better
with our own diversity."
Indeed, Stanford is a part of the real
world.
Students generally accept the reality
that Stanford is a diverse community,
which is underscored by the ethnic com
position of this year's new students.
As we begin a new year — and Stan
ford's next century — we hope that, col
lectively, we can renew our commitment
to understanding one another and to
building a community that respects all
groups and individuals.
Racial tensions in our society do influ

ence our serene campus. We have grap
pled with difficult incidents and ques
tions, and as a top-notch university
among many, Stanford has emerged as a
leader.
In 1988, we asked whether a Western
Culture program focusing only on Euro
pean male philosophers made sense, and
we decided it didn't.
Stanford made the change to Cul
tures, Ideas, and Values amid cries that
we were abandoning Western ideals —
but students, faculty and administration
showed courage in acknowledging the
diverse cultures that have made America
what it is today.
That same year, Stanford made a com
mitment to confront racial tensions in its
own community by establishing the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues.
Its 1989 landmark report spawned hun
dreds of similar studies across the coun
try.
Along the way, students have been
persistent in raising questions: How can
we speak freely about race without fear
ing the labels "racist" or "separatist?"
How can we gain strength from both

our human similarities and our ethnic
differences? How do we balance demands
for change with institutional inertia?
How do we deal with misunderstand
ings?
Questions like these have divided the
campus in past years. Many noticed a
backlash that led some students to ques
tion whether there was indeed an over
emphasis on multiculturalism that
didn't serve anyone's needs.
Last year ended on a painful note,
with The Daily charging that key leaders
of Stanford's progressive movement
were members of a secretive, Marxist-
Leninist organization.
In the end, many of us lost our focus.
In an atmosphere of suspicion and para
noia, it was difficult — if not impossible
— to deal honestly with the real ques
tions we face. Politics and distrust
diverted us from serving and educating
one another, and in June, we finished the
year unclear and unresolved.
The Stanford community is better
than that. There is common ground. As
an overarching goal, multiculturalism is
nearly universal on campus, although we

have yet to clearly define it. Thus, we
need to learn how to deal with differ
ences that naturally emerge when we
discuss the means toward our goal.
We will disagree — but we should rec
ognize that we don't have to agree on
everything, that personal grudges have
no place in thoughtful discourse, and
that ultimately, we are in this together.
Being on the cutting edge of change is
exciting, but it can be difficult as well,
for often we are the first to take risks in
dealing with diversity.
Sometimes we find it easier to dis
credit one another than to seek under
standing, but only the latter will bring
our community through its next 100
years.
