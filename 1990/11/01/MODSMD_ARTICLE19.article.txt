# Christians should not be attacked for simply speaking their minds
## 
### 
This letter is written in response to
inaccurate representations in an article
in the Oct. 24 Daily ("Domestic Partners
policy hotly debated").
The running theme throughout the
entire article was supposed to be cover
age on the forum at Escondido Village
named "Gay, Lesbian, Straight and Bi:
All Part of the Stanford Mix." Instead, it
was a blatant attack on fundamentalist
Christians.
The references to "hysteria" caused by

fundamentalist Christians and the sup
posed desire to "kill all gays" simply per
petuate the notion that Christians are
militant radicals.
Since when did speaking one's opinion
and debating policy in a forum created
just for that purpose constitute "hyste
ria?"
The definition of a fundamentalist is
one who goes back to the fundamentals,
back to the basics. For a Christian, this
is the Bible. The Bible specifically states:
"Do not judge, or you too will be judged"
(Matthew 7:10).
Also, the Apostle Paul writes, "What
business is it of mine to judge those out
side the church? Are you not to judge
those inside? God will judge those out
side. Expel the wicked man from among

you" (Ist Corinthians 5:12).
Fundamentalist Christians have no
scriptural basis for judging the domestic
partners policy or advocating the use of
violence, and any inferences to the con
trary are inaccuracies perpetuated by
someone who is ignorant of the funda
mentals of the Christian faith.
It seems like some people and the
writer of this article are under the illu
sion that Christians are the only ones on
the campus who question the domestic
partners policy. The Islamic Society
vehemently opposes the policy and plans
to send a letter to Don Kennedy.
There are also people on this campus
who question this policy on the basis of
their personal moral beliefs and question
the appropriateness of this policy for

married housing. Their voices should be
heard and accurately acknowledged too.
Too often, people forget that
Christians are just as free as anyone else
on this campus to express their opinions.
They should also be free from unsub
stantiated attacks.
