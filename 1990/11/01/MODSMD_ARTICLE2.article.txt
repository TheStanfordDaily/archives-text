# Police close Foothills rape cases
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Stanford Police officially closed five Foothills rape
cases Tuesday upon positive identification of the
rapist. Robert Michel Christy has been linked to four
attempted sexual assaults and one rape in the
Stanford Foothills between July 1989 and June
1990.
. "We have received 100 percent confirmation from
the June rape victim," said Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The victim, who is currently studying in Europe,
identified Christy from a photograph as the man who
robbed and raped her June 16.

Christy, 28, committed suicide in early August
after fatally shooting a teenage girl in Rocklin, a
small town in Northern California.
A U.S. Department of Justice crime analyst
informed the Stanford Police of a possible connection
after reading a report on the murder-suicide. Police
identified Christy as the Foothills rapist soon after
his death, matching him to a pair of eyeglasses and a
knife found at the scene of the November 1989
attempted assault.
The official identification of Christy as the
assailant confirmed the preliminary August
announcement.
Christy had actually been ques
tioned and photographed by the
Stanford Police in April of this
year after being spotted by a wit
ness of the July 1989 attempted
rape. However, he was not identi
fied by any of the assault victims
because he was wearing a beard.
Police believe that Christy shaved
off his beard before each assault.
Niemeyer said he is relieved
that Stanford's first reported rape
case since 1983 has been officially
closed.
"I am glad that (Christy) was
identified," Niemeyer said. "It did
not surprise me because of all of
the information we had discov
ered. His method, height, weight
and description all fit. It was a
serial pattern."
The victims' descriptions of the
assailant all matched the 175-
pound, 6-foot-1-inch Christy. He
attacked all of the victims from
behind, using a choke hold.
San Mateo County Police han
dled one of the attempted
assaults, but Stanford Police con
sidered all five cases as their own
because they all occurred in
Stanford's jurisdiction.
Despite the conclusion of these,
se, Stanford Police still recom
mend being cautious in the
Foothills.
