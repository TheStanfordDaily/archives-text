### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Stanford Police officially closed five Foothills rape
cases Tuesday upon positive identification of the
rapist. Robert Michel Christy has been linked to four
attempted sexual assaults and one rape in the
Stanford Foothills between July 1989 and June
1990.
. "We have received 100 percent confirmation from
the June rape victim," said Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The victim, who is currently studying in Europe,
identified Christy from a photograph as the man who
robbed and raped her June 16.

Christy, 28, committed suicide in early August
after fatally shooting a teenage girl in Rocklin, a
small town in Northern California.
A U.S. Department of Justice crime analyst
informed the Stanford Police of a possible connection
after reading a report on the murder-suicide. Police
identified Christy as the Foothills rapist soon after
his death, matching him to a pair of eyeglasses and a
knife found at the scene of the November 1989
attempted assault.
The official identification of Christy as the
assailant confirmed the preliminary August
announcement.
