• coulda, shoulda, woulda been a mighty
1 BLACK POWER ACTIVIST, if it
weren't for my hair.
this long, straightened stuff i've got
just doesn't fit the part of a radical, my
hair screams reserved, conservative, tie
me-up-in-a-bun-corporate-america-style.
obviously there's no hope, have you ever
seen a revolutionary with a bun?
looking like an activist is as important
as being one. so, even though i believe in
the struggle and the cause, as long as i
don't look like what i believe, people
won't take me seriously.
but that black activist look is pretty
hard for me to achieve, what i need are
some serious angela-davis-lookin' dreads,
now that's a woman with a politically-cor
rect do.
in fact, her matted mop defies oppres
sion. not comb nor brush nor afro-pik can
suppress the kink on her head, only a
sharp set of shears and super-charged
snippers are gonna mow down those
locks, talk about resistance!
ya see, it's all symbolic, her hair won't
bow down to the powers that be and nei
ther will she. patriarchy, sexism and
racism don't suppress this woman, no
sireeee! she's too mighty ... her hair's
too kinky.
so it doesn't look like i've got a chance
to release this hidden revolutionary in
me. not with my perfectly processed
perm, my tresses are too tamed for me to
be a radical.
sure, i know what i'm supposed to
believe, abolish apartheid! divest now!
free mandela! oops. ..
okay, so maybe i don't know exactly,

but even the little i do know about the
struggle my hair just can't articulate, and
as long as my hair isn't talking up the
cause with its mere presence, i'm an
unrecognized revolutionary.
but hey, maybe i could be a greenpeace,
soybean-eating recycler instead, most of
those folks have straight hair.
i think i could definitely be a part of
their crowd, my ideology seems to be
pretty much in line with theirs.
but wait, i don't have any tie-dye t
shirts or holey jeans, and lord help me if i
ever think of buying a pair of birken
stocks.
but if i'm going to hang with the folks,
i should at least try to look like what i
believe, i mean, it's pretty obvious that
the clothes make a point.
all those swirly, tie-dye colors symbol
ize a singular unification with the cos
mos. the holey jeans represent the bond
these middle-class dwellers share with
the impoverished folks who actually have
no choice but to wear ripped pants.
and the birkenstocks ... well, i'm not
sure they mean anything at all, but with
out them, the embodiment of the message
just isn't the same, it's definitely an open
toe sort of thang.
but. i don't think this is going to work
for me either, i don't look any more like
an earth-saving, nature person than i do a
black militant.
i guess i should just resign myself to a
conservative life that fits my conservative
look, i am definitely destined for a kind of
"leave it to beaver" existence.
and i guess i should abandon my dream
of leading the armed revolution of the

inner-cities, a jherri-curl-wearing leader
would probably be more credible.
but don't think that giving up these
dreams is easy, ya see, it's important for a
person's appearance to reflect what she
believes, and that applies to me too.
i mean, if people can't sum up my ide
ology with a quick glance at my attire,
then what? just think of the implications!
what if there are other people around
who are just like me? what if these folks
caught between a conservative look and
liberal leanings were allowed to dress as
they pleased whether or not it fit their
politics?
why the world would be a mess!
there'd be black panthers, on Wall Street,
disguised in power ties, there'd be folks
wearing Africa medallions who secretly
drove BMWs.
we couldn't have that! then we
wouldn't know just by looking at someone
whether she was a foe or a friend — which
of course means that we'd actually have
to talk to the person to discover her polit
ical stance.
i like it better the way it is now because
you really are what you wear, don't you
think?
