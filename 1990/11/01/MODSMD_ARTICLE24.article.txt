## Benjamin Myers Article gave false, opinionated account of Band's weekend performance 
### 
THE STANFORD BAND WISHES
to respond to the false allegations
brought against it in the article
reviewing this past weekend's football
game.
First, the Band questions the legiti
macy of printing editorial comments at
the end of an account of the game's statis
tics ("Card Notes").
Second, the article does not objectively
report the weekend's events. For exam
ple, The Daily claims that "The Band,
once again, was a disgrace to Stanford,"
implying that we consistently shame the
University in our performances.
If this unsupported assertion is true,
how does The Daily explain the Stanford
section's decision to give the Band a
standing ovation after half-time? Were
the alumni thanking us for disgracing
them?
While a minority of the Stanford sup
porters may have disliked our perfor
mances, most seemed proud enough to
loudly cheer our efforts at pre-game, half
time, and post-game.
Third, the article states that the Band
failed to support the football team.
This allegation is so ridiculous that it
hardly deserves a response. Anyone who
has seen the Band at sporting events
knows that we are among the most
dynamic groups supporting Stanford's

If anyone was seriously
offended by our perfor
mance, we apologize. We
hope that you were not too
severely traumatized.

athletes.
In fact, we returned to Stanford long
before the start of fall quarter in order to
attend two away games with the football
team at our own cost.
This past Saturday found the Band
cheering and ehouting with our usual
intensity — even though this is not our
"job." Rather, we are musicians: There
fore we played our music to the best of
our abilities, trying to motivate the team
with "All Right Now" and other songs (a
difficult task, to be sure, in a stadium
filled with over 40,000 rowdy Oregon
fans).
Fourth, in response to the claim that
we made fun of Oregon's sentimentally
sensitive spotted owl," we capitulate.
Yes, we made fun of the spotted owl.
Our half-time show presented 5 forma
tions satirizing the endangered bird,
much as we caricatured the Kuwait situa
tion with our "Crisis in the Mid-West"

show a few weeks ago.
Out of deference to the issue's sensitiv
ity, we tried to evenhandedly lampoon
both loggers and environmentalists, but
apparently changing our formation from
"OWL" to "AWOLT was too offensive.
Of course, it's true that some issues
are too controversial for the Band to par
ody — we'll never do an "Abortion Show,"
for example.
But based on its treatment in the
media (and also on the opinions of Ore
gon-born Band members), we believed
that the spotted owl debate was a worthy
target for our rapier wit.
Let's face it, forming a giant chainsaw
and playing Monty Python's "Lumber
jack Song" is not exactly a scathing indict
ment of the issue.
It was a joke, just like last year's "War
on Quack" show spoofing America's drug
crisis.
If anyone was seriously offended by
our performance, however, we apologize.
We hope that you were not too severely
traumatized.
Finally, the article's statement that we
got "booed off the field at half-time" is
incorrect. Despite the Oregon fans' boo
ing, the Band completed its half-time
show and returned to a cheering Stanford
section (as mentioned earlier).
The fact of the matter is that Oregon's

fans had been booing and shouting
obscenities at the Band from the time we
entered the stadium. They were predis
posed against us, and their booing proba
bly would have occurred regardless of our
show's subject.
Overall, then, The Daily gives an opin
ionated and false account of weekend's
events under the guise of an objective
sports article. The Daily's irresponsible

journalism is both surprising and disap
pointing.
We have outlined the situation's truth
in order to prevent her or other disgrun
tled individuals from turning us into a
scapegoat.

Director of the Band.
