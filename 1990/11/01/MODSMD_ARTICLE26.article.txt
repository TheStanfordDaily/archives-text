## Freshman Rafanelli fits in with Cardinal family 
### Tyson Vaughan Editorial staff 
You're an 8-year-old girl. You
want to play a sport, but all the
leagues are for boys only. What do
you do?
How about pulling a few

strings with dad, the local soccer
coach, and playing with the boys
anyway?
That's what Sarah Rafanelli
did.
The freshman forward's father
was one of three coaches on the
children's soccer team in Pied

mont, Calif., and since she wanted
to play something, she played on
the only team she could.
"It was your basic house
league," Rafanelli says.
Appropriately, the family con
nection that was so integral to the
launching of her career has con

tinued to be an important source
of support for her.
"I think my parents have
missed probably two games in my
life," she says.
But the commitment has gone
far beyond spectating for the
Rafanellis.
"When I was in training for one
team, I made my dad go out and
run sprints with me every other
day I'd make him play goalie and
have my mom fetch."
Rafanelli's sisters have also
influenced her. Her older sister
Stephanie was a soccer player, and
now her two younger sisters play
as well.
In fact, Sarah has followed
Stephanie's footsteps to some
degree. Stephanie played for Stan
ford her freshman and sophomore
years. She is currently a senior.
Still, Sarah's path has not been
exactly like her sister's. She was
the No. 1 recruit out of high
school, the third in as many years
to come to Stanford, which she
chose over perennial power Uni
versity of North Carolina.
"I never really wanted to go
there," she says, citing the aca
demic reputation of Stanford as
the main draw for her.
She doesn't necessarily see the
fact that Stanford does not offer
women's soccer scholarships as a
problem. "The financial aid pro
gram here is so good, it really
doesn't matter."
"Besides," she adds, "the cam
pus is so beautiful. I love it."
Once she got to the campus,
she made an immediate impact.
She scored three goals in her first
game wearing Cardinal and white
(a feat that she repeated in the
last game of the season, against
USF). She went on to start every

game but one. Other than a slight
mid-season drought, she contin
ued to proliferate offensively,
racking up a total of 28 points in
1990, tops on the team.
Rafanelli also won the assists
title with six. Her 11 goals are sec
ond on the team, next to mid
fielder Julie Foudy's 12. Foudy
was last year'B No. 1 recruit.
Rafanelli feels that she has
adjusted to collegiate soccer with
out too much trouble. *It's a little
more physical," she says. "You
have to play the game faster. . .
You have to be more tactically
aware.
"I haven't grown since about
eighth grade," continues the 5-
foot-3 scoring machine, "but I can
hang in there. I don't mind. For
wards get hacked a lot anyway."
Perhaps the biggest adjust
ment, she claims, has been simply
playing with different personnel
than she was used to. However,
even that difference has been min
imal, since Rafanelli plays on the
U.S. Youth National Team along
with several other Cardinal play
ers. That team also happens to be
coached by a certain Berhane
Andeberhan.
Nevertheless, she says, Stan
ford's team has been evolving so
much through the year that all
the players have had to constantly
adjust.
"We change systems every
game, every half," Rafanelli says.
It has worked, she says. With
the playoffs imminent (see Card
notes), the team's improvement is
right on track.
"Every game we're showing
that we're playing better and bet
ter together. I don't think we've
peaked yet. We're still improving
now. .. Our midfielders are con

necting bo much better with our
forwards. ..
"This year our big emphasis is
buckling down, because now
we've got the talent... We've got
to learn how to be intense at all
times and still have a good time."
That is a lesson which will be
crucial for Stanford's bid for the
national title. Rafanelli feels that
one of the Cardinal's two losses
this season, a 1-2 decision against
top-ranked Santa Clara, was due
to a lack of consistent intensity. In
that game, Stanford appeared
fatigued, especially in the second
half.
"I think that was more a case of
mental sluggishness than physical
sluggishness," she says.
But mental sluggishness has
not generally been a problem for
Rafanelli. "I'm very self-disci
plined. I like to work hard," she
says.
It took a lot of self-discipline for
her to endure a knee injury suf
fered last spring which kept her
from working hard for three
months.
"I told my dad, 'As soon as the
doctor releases me, I'm going out
and we're playing — tonight.'"
Appropriately, one of
Rafanelli's favorite aspects of the
Cardinal team may just give it the
mental and emotional edge it
needs in the playoffs.
"The cameraderie on this team
is incredible. . . It's very much a
family."
And that's something she's had
some experience with.
Card notes
The Cardinal's first playoff game is
at 7:30 p.m. at UC-Santa Barbara.
The Gauchos are the only team that
has shut out Stanford in 1990.

years. She is currently a senior.
Still, Sarah's path has not been
exactly like her sister's. She was
the No. 1 recruit out of high
school, the third in as many years
to come to Stanford, which she
chose over perennial power Uni
versity of North Carolina.
"I never really wanted to go
there," she says, citing the aca
demic reputation of Stanford as
the main draw for her.
She doesn't necessarily see the
fact that Stanford does not offer
women's soccer scholarships as a
problem. "The financial aid pro
gram here is so good, it really
doesn't matter."
"Besides," she adds, "the cam
pus is so beautiful. I love it."
Once she got to the campus,
she made an immediate impact.
She scored three goals in her first
game wearing Cardinal and white
(a feat that she repeated in the
last game of the season, against
USF). She went on to start every

game but one. Other than a slight
mid-season drought, she contin
ued to proliferate offensively,
racking up a total of 28 points in
1990, tops on the team.
Rafanelli also won the assists
title with six. Her 11 goals are sec
ond on the team, next to mid
fielder Julie Foudy's 12. Foudy
was last year'B No. 1 recruit.
Rafanelli feels that she has
adjusted to collegiate soccer with
out too much trouble. *It's a little
more physical," she says. "You
have to play the game faster. . .
You have to be more tactically
aware.
"I haven't grown since about
eighth grade," continues the 5-
foot-3 scoring machine, "but I can
hang in there. I don't mind. For
wards get hacked a lot anyway."
Perhaps the biggest adjust
ment, she claims, has been simply
playing with different personnel
than she was used to. However,
even that difference has been min
imal, since Rafanelli plays on the
U.S. Youth National Team along
with several other Cardinal play
ers. That team also happens to be
coached by a certain Berhane
Andeberhan.
Nevertheless, she says, Stan
ford's team has been evolving so
much through the year that all
the players have had to constantly
adjust.
"We change systems every
game, every half," Rafanelli says.
It has worked, she says. With
the playoffs imminent (see Card
notes), the team's improvement is
right on track.
"Every game we're showing
that we're playing better and bet
ter together. I don't think we've
peaked yet. We're still improving
now. .. Our midfielders are con

necting bo much better with our
forwards. ..
"This year our big emphasis is
buckling down, because now
we've got the talent... We've got
to learn how to be intense at all
times and still have a good time."
That is a lesson which will be
crucial for Stanford's bid for the
national title. Rafanelli feels that
one of the Cardinal's two losses
this season, a 1-2 decision against
top-ranked Santa Clara, was due
to a lack of consistent intensity. In
that game, Stanford appeared
fatigued, especially in the second
half.
"I think that was more a case of
mental sluggishness than physical
sluggishness," she says.
But mental sluggishness has
not generally been a problem for
Rafanelli. "I'm very self-disci
plined. I like to work hard," she
says.
It took a lot of self-discipline for
her to endure a knee injury suf
fered last spring which kept her
from working hard for three
months.
"I told my dad, 'As soon as the
doctor releases me, I'm going out
and we're playing — tonight.'"
Appropriately, one of
Rafanelli's favorite aspects of the
Cardinal team may just give it the
mental and emotional edge it
needs in the playoffs.
"The cameraderie on this team
is incredible. . . It's very much a
family."
And that's something she's had
some experience with.
Card notes
The Cardinal's first playoff game is
at 7:30 p.m. at UC-Santa Barbara.
The Gauchos are the only team that
has shut out Stanford in 1990.

Freshman Sarah Rafanelll (left) chats with her sister Stephanie, a senior. Stephanie played soccer for
the Cardinal her first two years on the Farm. Sarah's entire family has been a major Influence and source
of support for her through the years.
You're an 8-year-old girl. You
want to play a sport, but all the
leagues are for boys only. What do
you do?
How about pulling a few

strings with dad, the local soccer
coach, and playing with the boys
anyway?
That's what Sarah Rafanelli
did.
The freshman forward's father
was one of three coaches on the
children's soccer team in Pied

mont, Calif., and since she wanted
to play something, she played on
the only team she could.
"It was your basic house
league," Rafanelli says.
Appropriately, the family con
nection that was so integral to the
launching of her career has con

tinued to be an important source
of support for her.
"I think my parents have
missed probably two games in my
life," she says.
But the commitment has gone
far beyond spectating for the
Rafanellis.
"When I was in training for one
team, I made my dad go out and
run sprints with me every other
day I'd make him play goalie and
have my mom fetch."
Rafanelli's sisters have also
influenced her. Her older sister
Stephanie was a soccer player, and
now her two younger sisters play
as well.
In fact, Sarah has followed
Stephanie's footsteps to some
degree. Stephanie played for Stan
ford her freshman and sophomore
years. She is currently a senior.
