# Cardinal gridders perpetuate natural order of universe

### 
Call me a revisionist. Call me the
Barton Bernstein of recent sports
history.
All right. I'm exaggerating a little bit.
I'm sure what I'm going to say won't
come as that big of a surprise to you.
After all, hasn't everything been said
about Stanford's football upset of Notre
Dame four weeks ago?
Well, I've just got one thing that I need
to get off of my chest. It's been bugging
me the last couple of weeks, kind of in the
same way that opposing quarterbacks
have been bothering the Cardinal's
defense: frequently and relentlessly.
That October afternoon in South
Bend, the best team didn't win.
There. I feel better.
Stanford should never have beaten
Notre Dame. But for some unknown rea
son, a Harmonic Convergence of sorts
occured. The planets aligned themselves
just so and Irish quarterback Rick Mirer's
pass inexplicably slipped through the out
stretched fingertips of tight end Derek
Brown to finalize the upset. The crowd
was stunned, Touchdown Jesus seemed
baffled and the Cardinal had done the

impossible.
Such an upset, of course, would never
have occurred last season or two years
ago. The Irish had a perfect season in '88,
and in '89 they lost to the only other
"unbeatable" team, the Miami Hurri
canes.
But in 1990, anything is possible. After
all, this is the year which began with an
unknown contender from Columbus,
Ohio named James "Buster" Douglas
upsetting the undefeated heavyweight
champ, Mike Tyson.
This is the year in which a wimpy,
whiny group of National Leaguers named
the Cinncinnati Reds had the audacity to
dethrone a dynasty in the making, the

Oakland Athletics. Not only did the Reds
oust the A's, they swept and humiliated
them.
Yeah, anything is possible this year. I
guess that's why Stanford won.
But, just as Dave Stewart claimed after
the World Series that the A's were the
"best team in baseball," the best team
doesn't always win.
I know that's no big revelation to those
astute sports fans among you, espe
cially those who have often had to use
this argument in defense of their pre
ferred teams. But for dummies like me,
this argument takes a few minutes to
think through.
Stanford's record right now stands at
2-6 and is racing south for the border.
Notre Dame is a respectable 6-1 and
ranked second in the nation.
I suppose that's why college football
teams play a full schedule of 11 or 12
games each season — to determine which
teams are the best overall. Otherwise a
bunch of sports writers would have to sit
around and argue for a month about
which 1-0 team or 0-1 team is the best

and which is the worst. And if you've ever
heard sports writers argue, you know
that they'd have about as much chance of
finding an answer as Congress and Bush
have of finding a budget compromise.
Over the last several seasons, the Irish
have distinguished themselves as one of
the two best college football programs in
the country, and a considerably more
noble educational institution than that
other football factory, Miami.
Stanford, on the other hand, has spent
the last three seasons demonstrating how
an extremely talented and hard-working
football team can manage to lose too
many games in dismal fashion.
Notre Dame has a name that com
mands a de facto appearance in Sports
Illustrated's top five. Stanford has a
name that earns a de facto appearance in
the U.S. News and World Report top five.
Notre Dame has an offensive punch
that devastates opponents. Stanford has
an offensive punch that resembles Buster
Douglas's uppercut.
Yeah, beating Notre Dame was glori
ous — while it lasted. For a week we rev
elled in the possibility that this was the

critical juncture from which the Cardinal
would depart and leave behind its recent
woes. Then Stanford played USC, Wash
ington and Oregon and was outscored a
combined 120-38. Ouch.
Stanford has looked inept the last
three weeks. They've been unmotivated,
they've executed poorly and they look like
how we fans feel — confused. How could
this happen?
But the explanation is simple. Just as
surely as Buster Douglas stuck all 246
pounds of himself in the way of a speeding
Evander Holyfield right, the Stanford
Cardinal is just doing its part to reestab
lish the proper order of the universe.
Buster is quickly being forgotten in the
world of boxing, his reign having lasted a
short eight months. Stanford's reign
lasted even shorter, only a week.
For the pretenders to the throne, like
the Stanford football team, the glory will
always be shortlived.

doesn't always win.
I know that's no big revelation to those
astute sports fans among you, espe
cially those who have often had to use
this argument in defense of their pre
ferred teams. But for dummies like me,
this argument takes a few minutes to
think through.
Stanford's record right now stands at
2-6 and is racing south for the border.
Notre Dame is a respectable 6-1 and
ranked second in the nation.
I suppose that's why college football
teams play a full schedule of 11 or 12
games each season — to determine which
teams are the best overall. Otherwise a
bunch of sports writers would have to sit
around and argue for a month about
which 1-0 team or 0-1 team is the best

and which is the worst. And if you've ever
heard sports writers argue, you know
that they'd have about as much chance of
finding an answer as Congress and Bush
have of finding a budget compromise.
Over the last several seasons, the Irish
have distinguished themselves as one of
the two best college football programs in
the country, and a considerably more
noble educational institution than that
other football factory, Miami.
Stanford, on the other hand, has spent
the last three seasons demonstrating how
an extremely talented and hard-working
football team can manage to lose too
many games in dismal fashion.
Notre Dame has a name that com
mands a de facto appearance in Sports
Illustrated's top five. Stanford has a
name that earns a de facto appearance in
the U.S. News and World Report top five.
Notre Dame has an offensive punch
that devastates opponents. Stanford has
an offensive punch that resembles Buster
Douglas's uppercut.
Yeah, beating Notre Dame was glori
ous — while it lasted. For a week we rev
elled in the possibility that this was the

critical juncture from which the Cardinal
would depart and leave behind its recent
woes. Then Stanford played USC, Wash
ington and Oregon and was outscored a
combined 120-38. Ouch.
Stanford has looked inept the last
three weeks. They've been unmotivated,
they've executed poorly and they look like
how we fans feel — confused. How could
this happen?
But the explanation is simple. Just as
surely as Buster Douglas stuck all 246
pounds of himself in the way of a speeding
Evander Holyfield right, the Stanford
Cardinal is just doing its part to reestab
lish the proper order of the universe.
Buster is quickly being forgotten in the
world of boxing, his reign having lasted a
short eight months. Stanford's reign
lasted even shorter, only a week.
For the pretenders to the throne, like
the Stanford football team, the glory will
always be shortlived.

Call me a revisionist. Call me the
Barton Bernstein of recent sports
history.
All right. I'm exaggerating a little bit.
I'm sure what I'm going to say won't
come as that big of a surprise to you.
After all, hasn't everything been said
about Stanford's football upset of Notre
Dame four weeks ago?
Well, I've just got one thing that I need
to get off of my chest. It's been bugging
me the last couple of weeks, kind of in the
same way that opposing quarterbacks
have been bothering the Cardinal's
defense: frequently and relentlessly.
That October afternoon in South
Bend, the best team didn't win.
There. I feel better.
Stanford should never have beaten
Notre Dame. But for some unknown rea
son, a Harmonic Convergence of sorts
occured. The planets aligned themselves
just so and Irish quarterback Rick Mirer's
pass inexplicably slipped through the out
stretched fingertips of tight end Derek
Brown to finalize the upset. The crowd
was stunned, Touchdown Jesus seemed
baffled and the Cardinal had done the

impossible.
Such an upset, of course, would never
have occurred last season or two years
ago. The Irish had a perfect season in '88,
and in '89 they lost to the only other
"unbeatable" team, the Miami Hurri
canes.
But in 1990, anything is possible. After
all, this is the year which began with an
unknown contender from Columbus,
Ohio named James "Buster" Douglas
upsetting the undefeated heavyweight
champ, Mike Tyson.
This is the year in which a wimpy,
whiny group of National Leaguers named
the Cinncinnati Reds had the audacity to
dethrone a dynasty in the making, the

Oakland Athletics. Not only did the Reds
oust the A's, they swept and humiliated
them.
Yeah, anything is possible this year. I
guess that's why Stanford won.
But, just as Dave Stewart claimed after
the World Series that the A's were the
"best team in baseball," the best team
doesn't always win.
