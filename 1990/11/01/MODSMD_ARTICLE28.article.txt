# Sophomore rises to prominence
## From underachieving redshirt to high-placing Pac-10 runner 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Most Stanford students remember
their first exposure to the Farm as a
humbling experience. People who stood
out in high school become just another
member of the gifted Stanford commu
nity.
Gary Stolz is a perfect example.
The Palos Verdes, California, native
arrived at Stanford in 1989 as one of the
top high school runners in the state, but
sat out the season and did not race once.
"Last year, we redshirted Gary sim
ply because he wouldn't have raced
much anyway," men's cross-country
coach Scott Chisam said. "This year,
though, he's been a great surprise for
us."
Teammate Alex Accetta agrees with
Chisam's assessment. "We knew that we
had four strong runners going into this
season, and that we needed a fifth to
really do something this year," he said.
"He's come out and really helped us a
lot. If it wasn't for him, I'd be a little
more worried about our chances at
Nationals."
If Stanford is to make the NCAA
Championships, it will have to capture
either first, second, or third place in the
upcoming District-8 finals. The race will
be held in Fresno, Calif., on Saturday,
Nov. 10.
Stolz will play a critical role in deter
mining Stanford's success in the meet.
Judging from his performance fresh
man year, however, nobody would have
guessed that he would be such an inte
gral piece of the Cardinal puzzle.
"Last year, I just wasn't good enough
to make the team," Stolz said. "I didn't
really know what college running was
all about. In high school, you can race
into shape. In college, you have to start
the season in good shape, or you'll get

killed."
After a season of practicing on his
own, Stolz rejoined the team for the
track season, and while he ran well on
the track, he failed to raise the eyebrows
that he has this year. Stolz attributes his
success to his summer training.
"I really paid my dues this summer,"
Stolz said. "I did my mileage, and so far,
it's paid off." It has paid off so well, in
fact, that he was assured of a top seven
spot long before the championship
meets even began.
Stolz's career as a runner began in
eighth grade, when he ran a 10K road
race and took second place in his age
group. "I realized that I did pretty well,
and decided to stick with it,"he said.
He joined his high school team and
quickly emerged as the only running tal
ent at Miraleste High, yet another rea
son why the exposure to the vast
amounts of talent in collegiate running
caught Stolz by surprise.
He became captain his sophomore
year and ran the mile and the two-mile
in track, but cross country has always
been foremost in Stolz's heart. "Track is
just how fast you can go around an
oval," he said. "Cross country is better
for capturing the true feeling of run
ning."
Especially, the feeling of running
alone. Stolz had literally no competition
in his league, and would win races by so
much that he had time to get dressed,
cool down, stretch, and have a hot dog or
two before the second-place finisher
would cross the line. Well, almost.
"I used to win league meets by almost
a minute," Stolz said. "I was in a league
without much talent."
It was because of this lack of compe
tition in his league that Stolz really had
no idea of how good he was until the
state championship meet his senior
year. "I really had no goals for the meet,

Stolz is coming off his
'biggest race ever'
when he took second
on the team at Pac
10s.

because I didn't know how good the
other runners in the state were."
Stolz ran the ninth-fastest time in
the state, and pretty soon universities
began to beat a proverbial path to his
door. After a year spent in relative
anonymity, Stolz is finally paying off.
Hopefully, his most valuable contribu
tions will come over the next few weeks.
He is coming off what Chisam termed
his "biggest race ever" when he took
second on the team at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships with a time of 25:24 for the
8K course.
Stolz, along with the rest of the Car
dinal harriers, will be focusing on three
teams in particular at the District-8
meet. "Last year, Oregon took the five of
the top 10 places at Pac-10's," he said.
"Also, Arizona's got two awesome guys,
and Washington took fourth in the
nation last year."
Stanford will have to beat at least one
of those three teams to make the trip to
Nashville. Stolz, however, believes the
team can do even better than that.
"If we can finish five guys before Ari
zona's third man, we'll beat them,"
Stolz said. "Washington graduated a lot
of people, and Oregon. .. they always
seem to get these amazing guys out of
nowhere, but we'll see."
Yes we will. Hopefully, we'll see Stan
ford make its first NCAA appearance
since 1985.

team can do even better than that.
"If we can finish five guys before Ari
zona's third man, we'll beat them,"
Stolz said. "Washington graduated a lot
of people, and Oregon. .. they always
seem to get these amazing guys out of
nowhere, but we'll see."
Yes we will. Hopefully, we'll see Stan
ford make its first NCAA appearance
since 1985.

Gary Stolz went from the limelight running In high school to obscurity redshlrtlng his
freshman year. But this season he has come on strong.
Most Stanford students remember
their first exposure to the Farm as a
humbling experience. People who stood
out in high school become just another
member of the gifted Stanford commu
nity.
Gary Stolz is a perfect example.
The Palos Verdes, California, native
arrived at Stanford in 1989 as one of the
top high school runners in the state, but
sat out the season and did not race once.
"Last year, we redshirted Gary sim
ply because he wouldn't have raced
much anyway," men's cross-country
coach Scott Chisam said. "This year,
though, he's been a great surprise for
us."
Teammate Alex Accetta agrees with
Chisam's assessment. "We knew that we
had four strong runners going into this
season, and that we needed a fifth to
really do something this year," he said.
"He's come out and really helped us a
lot. If it wasn't for him, I'd be a little
more worried about our chances at
Nationals."
If Stanford is to make the NCAA
Championships, it will have to capture
either first, second, or third place in the
upcoming District-8 finals. The race will
be held in Fresno, Calif., on Saturday,
Nov. 10.
Stolz will play a critical role in deter
mining Stanford's success in the meet.
Judging from his performance fresh
man year, however, nobody would have
guessed that he would be such an inte
gral piece of the Cardinal puzzle.
"Last year, I just wasn't good enough
to make the team," Stolz said. "I didn't
really know what college running was
all about. In high school, you can race
into shape. In college, you have to start
the season in good shape, or you'll get

killed."
After a season of practicing on his
own, Stolz rejoined the team for the
track season, and while he ran well on
the track, he failed to raise the eyebrows
that he has this year. Stolz attributes his
success to his summer training.
"I really paid my dues this summer,"
Stolz said. "I did my mileage, and so far,
it's paid off." It has paid off so well, in
fact, that he was assured of a top seven
spot long before the championship
meets even began.
Stolz's career as a runner began in
eighth grade, when he ran a 10K road
race and took second place in his age
group. "I realized that I did pretty well,
and decided to stick with it,"he said.
He joined his high school team and
quickly emerged as the only running tal
ent at Miraleste High, yet another rea
son why the exposure to the vast
amounts of talent in collegiate running
caught Stolz by surprise.
He became captain his sophomore
year and ran the mile and the two-mile
in track, but cross country has always
been foremost in Stolz's heart. "Track is
just how fast you can go around an
oval," he said. "Cross country is better
for capturing the true feeling of run
ning."
Especially, the feeling of running
alone. Stolz had literally no competition
in his league, and would win races by so
much that he had time to get dressed,
cool down, stretch, and have a hot dog or
two before the second-place finisher
would cross the line. Well, almost.
"I used to win league meets by almost
a minute," Stolz said. "I was in a league
without much talent."
It was because of this lack of compe
tition in his league that Stolz really had
no idea of how good he was until the
state championship meet his senior
year. "I really had no goals for the meet,

Stolz is coming off his
'biggest race ever'
when he took second
on the team at Pac
10s.

because I didn't know how good the
other runners in the state were."
Stolz ran the ninth-fastest time in
the state, and pretty soon universities
began to beat a proverbial path to his
door. After a year spent in relative
anonymity, Stolz is finally paying off.
Hopefully, his most valuable contribu
tions will come over the next few weeks.
He is coming off what Chisam termed
his "biggest race ever" when he took
second on the team at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships with a time of 25:24 for the
8K course.
Stolz, along with the rest of the Car
dinal harriers, will be focusing on three
teams in particular at the District-8
meet. "Last year, Oregon took the five of
the top 10 places at Pac-10's," he said.
"Also, Arizona's got two awesome guys,
and Washington took fourth in the
nation last year."
Stanford will have to beat at least one
of those three teams to make the trip to
Nashville. Stolz, however, believes the
team can do even better than that.
"If we can finish five guys before Ari
zona's third man, we'll beat them,"
Stolz said. "Washington graduated a lot
