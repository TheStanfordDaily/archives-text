## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Rhymin' Simon finds the 'Rhythm’ New album, different formula, indescribable result 
### Dan Levitin Staff writer 
Question: Name the contemporary recording artist
who had a string of hits in the sixties, yet (a) refuses to
play oldies and (b) with each new record tries to dis
cover a new sound, refusing to repeat himself.
Answer: Paul Simon, of course.
It is really difficult to think of anyone else who tries
so sincerely to move forward, damning all of the com
mercial and financial risks.
It is precisely for this reason that 1986's "Grace
land" succeeded, and why 1990's "The Rhythm of the
Saints" is difficult to evaluate upon the first dozen or
so listenings.
And Simon's experimental excursions are all the
more compelling because they are truly intentional.
"I'm trying to recreate the sounds I remember hear
ing when I was a kid," Simon said of the new album in
a recent interview.
"When I was 12 years old, listening to rock and roll
for the first time, it sounded as exotic and emotional
and rhythmic as these songs sound to me now."
I have been listening to the new album solidly for
three weeks now to review it, and I haven't been able
to decide whether or not I like it. It sounds so new, and
so different, that it rejects any attempt to take it
lightly, to say instantly that it is likable or pleasantly
familiar.
Stanford English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino has said
of art in general, "It is the artists' responsibility to
change the form, to stretch boundaries. But in doing
so, he leaves behind old frames of reference."
If the artist is doing his job, in other words, his
product can't be immediately likable because it is too
startlingly new.
I find myself intrigued by the new album, inter
ested in listening to it, yet puzzled by my inability to
articulate a precise opinion about it.
By way of comparison, I felt this same way about
"Graceland," and about Dire Straits' "Brotners In
Arms" and even the first Police album I ever heard.
Developing "Rhythm"
How did Simon achieve these exotic sounds and
rhythms? Much of the album's percussion tracks were
recorded in Brazil, utilizing backdrops which are unfa
miliar to most American listeners.
"I recorded different grooves coming from mcumba
and condomble rhythms. These are African Catholic,
syncretized religions, like santeria in Cuba, or
voodoo," Simon explained. "When the slaves came,,
they weren't allowed to practice religion and the wor
ship of the Yoruba deities, so they syncretized the
deities to Catholic saints, then practiced our form of
Catholicism with drums. That they fooled the
slave masters and were able to keep their culture."
The songs were essentially written around the
drum tracks. An example is the album's lirst sin
gle, "The Obvious Child," an exotic and moving
composition with polytonal drums. It was
recorded live, outdoors in Salvador, capital of
the Brazilian province Bahia.
"We [Simon and Engineer Roy Haleej
saw this group Oludum • 10 bass
drummers and four snares. There
was no studio we could use, so we
recorded them live in the street
with an eight-track. The song
itself just sat there waiting to

be written, and it took two years to edit."
Other songs followed a similar path
"I'd come Dack with a drum track with anywhere
from six to 10 percussionists playing at once, then
edit the track bv taking out sloppy bars and tighten- '
ing it up until I had five minutes down very
tigntly — the basis for putting in -
"My way of writing was such
a song's structure and chord sequence
were composed, I'd start improving the
melody over it. This could take
months, but once the melody
started coming, ithe words starts*
coming." |
What marks Simon so clearly
and distinguishes him from his
'60s peers is his unceasing search
for new sounds and new musical
vehicles for his lyrics. Yet the pat
tern of this search is easy to see
for him.
The new album, he said, "is a
continuation of my investigation
of rhythm and lyrics, a combina
tion of ordinary, conversational
speech and enriched language
and imagery. It's what I did nat- j
urally in the early days without
thinking, and then*!ater "ton
became rnte rested in anjd
focused onit
"What if%els me to do this?
Essentially, wfiat I'nv4oing witft\
all this stuff is looking for sounds
that are real and emotion#!/ele
ments of the rock and roll I first
heard when I was 12 or 13. ..

tions with Brazilian

Qale (guitar). Most

tars were played by Ghanaian gui
tarist Kofi Electrik and Cameroo
nian guitarist Vincent Nguini. The
mixing of these different regional
and cultural musics is intriguing.
"I was basically looking to
familiarize myself with these
[Brazilian] rhythms, then bring
them back here and ask Kofi and
Vincent to play west African style
guitar over it/' Simon said.
"We were making patterns of
songs, using West African music
styles, Brazilian drums and my
song structures — which were
influenced by 'Graceland.' "
Simon's story
Simon began writing while still
in junior high school in Queens.
His first song, "The Girl For Me,"
was a hit at Parsons Jr. High School
when he was 13.
With classmate Art Garfunkel,
he recorded a demo of "Hey School
Girl" for $ 15 under the name Tbm
and Jerry. An independent label,
BIG records, bought the demo,
released it, and sold 150,000
copies in 1957 — reaching num
ber 46 in the national top 1,000
and number 10 in the New York
area.
After a stint writing and record
ing song demos with legendary
writer Carole King, he and Gar
funkel reunited and were signed to
Columbia Records in 1964,
recording their first album,
"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M."
In 1967, movie director Mike
Nichols sent them a script for
"The Graduate" after hearing
"Scarborough Fair" and"The
Sounds of Silence," hoping to per
suade them to write and perform
for the album's soundtrack. One of
the songs, "Mrs. Robinson," won a
Record of the Year Grammy in

1968.
Simon and Garfunkel in fact
had four of the top five albums in
1968: "Bookends," the soundtrack
from"The Graduate," "Parsley,
Sage, Rosemary And Thyme," and
"The Sounds of Silence."
1970's "Bridge Over Troubled
Water," recorded partially at CBS
Studios in San Francisco on Fol
som Street, sold over 10 million
copies and won five Grammies.
It was on this album that Paul
began his pursuit of Latin and
African rhythms. The Peruvian
folk song which Paul recorded, "El
Condor Pasa" featured authentic
folk instruments and Simon's
newly composed lyrics.
Other explorations with
rhvthm followed. His self-titled
solo album featured a reggae single
"Mother and Child Reunion" pro
duced in Jamaica. "There Goes
Rhymin' Simon" blended the Mus
cle Shoals Rhythm Section with
black gospel music from the Dixie
Hummingbirds and the Swan Sil
vertones on such songs as "Love
Me Like A Rock."
In 1984, Simon traveled to
Johannesburg to record local musi
cians for what would become his
hit album "Graceland."
"I never felt a burden after
'Graceland,'" Simon said, "or
intimidated by its success. . . .
There is a responsibility not to
repeat, not to be safe. You're
always trying to be as honest as
you can be about who you are,
without abandoning who you were
and what you went through."
"Rhythm of the Saints" suc
ceeds on many levels. Simon chal
lenges the listener's ideas about
popular music, forcing the listener
to wrestle with his or her own
musical and formal expectations.
And the very act of trying to
decode the music, to fit it in to our
musical consciousness, is of
course part of the fun, which
Simon most surely knows.
