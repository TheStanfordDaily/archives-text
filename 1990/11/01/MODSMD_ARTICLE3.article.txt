# Feds targeted in lawsuit
## Stanford sues to recover research contract 
### Andrea Hungerford Staff writer 
Stanford filed a lawsuit last
week against the federal govern
ment claiming that it violated the
First Amendment by demanding
the right to censor faculty
research publications.
The University is seeking an
injunction against the use of a
"Confidentiality of Information
Clause" that grants censorship
power to the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute. The
suit also asks that a $1.5 million
research contract be restored to
Stanford.
The suit, filed Oct. 24 in U.S.
District Court in Washington,
D.C., names the federal agency as
one of five defendants. The other
defendants are Claude Lenfant,
the director of the institute; the
Department of Health and
Human Services; Louis Sullivan,
director of the department; and an
agency of the National Institute of
Health.
The litigation stems from a
research contract awarded to
Stanford by the institute that was
withdrawn and awarded to St.
Louis University Medical Center
when Stanford refused to agree to
a contract that included the confi
dentiality clause.

The clause requires Stanford
researchers to submit
manuscripts that report research
results to the the institute for
agency approval prior to publica
tion. The manuscripts could not
be published if the agency submit
ted any written objections.
When two or more universities
are collaborating on a research
project, the clause goes into effect.
In this instance, the University of
Pittsburgh is a research partner
with Stanford.
The clause exists because of
concerns that data from one
research center will be published
prematurely, without waiting for
corroborating data from the other
research centers.
Premature publication could be
harmful to the public health by
exciting public opinion over a
health advance that may turn out
not to exist or to need further sub
stantiation. The clause also exists
to protect the privacy of patients
and proprietary data.
The confidentiality clause vio
lates Stanford's Policy Guidelines
on Secrecy in Research, in effect
since 1969. The policy states that
Stanford will not enter into any
research contract that requires
agency approval before research
results can be published.
It defends the "principle of

freedom of access by all interested
persons to the underlying data, to
the processes and to the final
results of research. n
The current conflict began in
August 1989 when the institute
requested a proposal on long-term
research in humans involving an
artificial heart device known as
the Left Ventricular Assist Sys
tem.
Philip Oyer, a leading
researcher in the design of artifi
cial heart devices who works at
the Stanford School of Medicine,
has been developing the system
for almost 20 years.
It is now used to temporarily
sustain patients in need of heart
transplants until a donor can be
found. Current research aims to
develop a lojpg-term assist device,
which may help heart patients for
whom a donor cannot be found.
Based on Oyer's work, Stan
ford submitted a proposal to the
institute on Oct. 9,1989. The ini
tial proposal objected to several
clauses in the request, including
the confidentiality clause.
Stanford later signed the final
grant proposal contract, under the
condition that the clause be
removed. In the past, Stanford
has been able to negotiate out this
