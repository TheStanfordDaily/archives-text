# Director's version of 'Dispute' grapples with issues of race and gender
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
James Loehlin, doctoral student
in drama and humanities, tries to
salvage a poorly-designed experi
ment, but creates a dispute
instead.
The experiment aims to settle
the classic "nature vs. nurture"
argument and the creation is "The
Dispute," the Department of
Drama's presentation of Mari
vaux's 18th century play.
Are men or women more likely
to be unfaithful in love? Obsessed
with this question, the sinister
Prince in the play decides to study
the meeting of two men and two
women who were raised separately
and in isolation from everyone but
their black servants.
Assuming that culture has no
play in their upbringings, the four
young people supposedly behave in
accordance with their nature. But
Loehlin, director of the production,
said the play actually portrays gen
der and racial stereotypes as natu
ral human social and sexual behav
ior
Loehlin said his production is
an attempt to take the play outside
its original historical context and
show that the characters' actions
are no less culturally-determined
than if they had been raised in the
Prince's court.
Loehlin said his interpretation
of the play is part of the prevalent
Stanford practice of stepping out
side cultures and questioning their
values. "People (here) are interested
in culture and the insidious way it
works on people."
The women in the play are pre-

occupicd with beauty, a trait that is
cultivated rather than innate,
Loehlin said. "No 20th century
person seeing the work will accept
that as normal."
With minor textual changes and
more "emotional and political sub
text," Loehlin aims to treat the
gender and racial issues more seri
ously than the light-hearted intent
of the original play.
Loehlin described two scenes in
the play when the actors meet each
other. As written by Marivaux, the
men are able to get along while the
women quickly become jealous of
each other — two stereotypical por
trayals, Loehlin said.
Under his direction, the actors'
approach suggests the possibility of
hostility and suspicion between
the young men and friendship
between the women.
lb make the play more "com
plex and problematic," the concept
of homosexuality is also intro
duced, Loehlin said.
For example, when the two male
characters first meet, one says/'l
like your face. Give me your hand.
We must love each other" Loehlin

said although the lines are meant
to show amiable friendship, his
actors are saying them in a more
suggestive manner to show the
"possibility of erotic attraction."
Another stereotype in the play
pertains to race relationships,
Leohlin said. "The characters par
ticipate in the power structure of
the white master and the black
slave," and although they are
brought up secluded from society,
their attitudes to race are also con
ditioned, he said.
To redeem the play, the black
servants are made the moral cen
ters instead, as "good characters
trapped in the situation," Loehlin
said.
Loehlin said the audience
should be able to conclude that the
Prince's experiment is ill-judged
and inhumane. "It seems like a
Nazi experiment in a concentra
tion camp sort of environment."
"All (the Prince] finds is what
sort of culture he is existing in"and
not true human nature, Loehlin
added.
Loehlin finds the task of reshap
ing a play challenging, but admit
ted the process may "disrupt the
internal balance of the play."
Despite that, he said responses
from the drama department are
positive and no one has trouble
understanding his approach.

"The Dispute " opened last night in
the Little Theater. Performances
are at 8 p.m. Wednesday through
Saturday for this week and next
week. Tickets are available at the
