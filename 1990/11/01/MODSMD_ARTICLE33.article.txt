## Burt trades Bandit for' 90s family man 
### 
Maria Shriver was right. Burt Reynolds is
"the Cosby of the nineties."
Yes, the same Burt Reynolds who starred in
such silver screen classics as "Smokey and the
Bandit," "Cannonball Run"and "Hooper" may
be one of the great TV comedic lead actors of the
new decade.
Granted the transition wasn't easy. Reynolds,
however, has put last year's abysmal ABC
action/mystery series "BJ Stryker" behind him,
and has joined forces with the creators of CBS's
hit "Designing Women" to develop this season's
best new situation comedy, "Evening Shade."
(Fridays at 8 p.m.)
The Bandit jacket and the 10-gallon hat have
been replaced by a poofy toupee and too-tight
polo shirts, but he's still the same Burt you
know and love. His deadpan delivery and side
long glances complement cleverly scripted dia
logue and witty situations.
Reynolds stars as Wood Newton, a former
NFL hero who returns to the small town of
Evening Shade, Arkansas to assume the unenvi
able task of coaching the hapless high school
football team — winless under his tutelage.
Despite his woes on the gridiron, Wood can
fall back on the support of his friends in the
rural community, played by his real life pals
Marilu Henner, Charles Durning and veteran
character actor Hal Holbrook. Jerry Reed, Dom
DeLuise and wife Loni Anderson can't be far
behind.
It is Reynolds' ability to mix one-liners with
semi-serious themes that makes "Shade" such a
fresh and likeable new show. Last week's show
dealt with teenage sex with just enough humor
to make its point without preaching.
Despite Burt's timely sighs, arched eyebrows
and pregnant pauses, Holbrook — who plays
Reynolds' father-in-law — steals almost every
show with the best lines and a flawless South
ern drawl. He's a wisened philosopher who's
not afraid to date the town's most renowned
stripper.
The 1970s premier sex symbol has traded car
chases for domestic comedy in the mold of
"Family Ties" and"The Cosby Show." The once
great playboy has become the ideal" '90s man."
In fact, Reynolds' transition to television dad
may reach its peak this Friday as Burt is
rumored to appear without his trademark
moustache for the first time in nearly two
decades. Somewhere, Sally Field is weeping.
