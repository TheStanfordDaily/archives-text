## Sorting through the punk, the funk and the junk 
### 
Do you often wonder if Aerosmith
will keep making "elevator" music? Are
you having trouble telling punk from
funk from junk? Have you ever caught
yourself thinking, "No no no, you silly
goose, we DIDN'T build this city on
rock n' roll"?
Then you're in luck. Welcome to the
"Chris Harris Non-Alphabetical Music
Dictionary [radio edit]," where you may
find answers to all your musical ques
tions only if you can find the right head
ing. So hurry up! and bring. . .your
juice! box! money! reLAX, have a cigar,
and don't walkaway walkaway, walka
way, walkaway — enjoy what follows.
THE GRAMMYS: The musical
equivalent of the Oscars, it used to be
quite a mystery how the award's nick
name originated. But after the past two
ceremonies, in which Jethro Hill was
classified as Heavy Metal and Bette
Midler won Best Song, the mystery is
solved: Clearly, it's somebody's
Grammy that's aoing the judging.
CLASSIC ROCK: The folks over at
KZSU get a kick out of calling this "vin
tage rock" ("Hmm, yees, 1969 ... a
fine year indeed.") Either way, this
obsession with classic rock is like that
with Coke Classic: people wouldn't
keep buying it, but it's a helluva lot bet
ter than that new stuff. "Get Back"
sums up their mentality.
CLASSICAL: All that CLASSIC is,

and AL ittle more. Except for those nag
ging Symphonies in A major ("Chris,
you've got to pick soon"), I can usually
enjoy this music. And so can many oth
ers. "Get Bach" sums up their mental
ity ...
POOP: Whoops, that should read
POP. Then again, never mind.
The sad state of pop music today can
be summed up by that latest "Swedish
super-group" to hit the charts, Roxette.
The success of their album "Look
Sharp! Who Cares How We Sound?"
suddenly makes import restrictions an
appealing idea. With the combined suc
cesses of Abba and Roxette, Sweden has
now surpassed its Swiss neighbor as
Europe's largest exporter of cheese.
LAMBADA: Yeah, right.
RAP: LL Cool J, DJ Jazzy Jeff, MC
Hammer, MC Donald. . . . Sounds like
a friggin' Alphabet Soup. For all the let
ters, though, many used to think that
rap was missing a big, fat "C" in front of
its name. Now the public is more
accommodating, especially as some of
rap's unique features have surfaced:
• Rappers just loooove their names,
sticking them into their own songs to
make sure no one forgets who they're
listening to: "Stop! HAMMERtime!"
That's why you'll never see a rapper
named Fred. The concept just doesn't
work: "My name is FRED/That's what I
SAID/Uh. . . I am not DEAD/Um,

hmm. . . . Stop! FREDtime!.."
• Although we middle-class white
folk, in a typically feeble attempt to
seem cool, nave suckled up to main
stream rap, much of the music is still
far outside any measure of public accep
tance.
Hence, 2 Live Crew is banned or
restricted nearly everywhere except Ore
gon, which found no reason for action
since "at least they preserved the sanc
tity of our Spotted Owls . . . unlike
those [insensitive clods] from Stan
ford." However, 2 Live Crew was forced
to plead guilty to obscenity charges for a
Florida concert: Stop! SLAMMERtime!
• As expected, countless pretenders
to rap have surfaced, from every
mother's-favorite-rebel Billy Joel, to the
latest incarnation of pure pointlessness,
Vanilla Ice: Stop! NEVERmind!
Untapped rapper with most poten
tial: Dr. Seuss. Just give him a beat box
and an ego, and watch him bust a move.
MTV: "Music Television," notable
for revolutionizing pop culture, and
knocking the average teen's attention
span from the 30-minute sitcom to the
3-minute video.
MTV is also the proud employer of
television's most annoying personality,
"Downtown Julie Brown." But perhaps
"personality" is too generous a word.
With her plastic smile, clothes to match

and an air-brained voice, Brown has sin
glehandedly put the "MT" back into
"MTV."
REGGAE: Has provided the greatest
boost of respect for the letter "J" since
Jehovah. Jah, Jamming, Jamaica, Jail.
Show me a Reggae song without a J
word in it, and I'll show you an instru
mental.
"DON'T LOSE THAT NUMBER"
MUSIC: Pioneered by Steely Dan
("Rikki Don't Lose that Number") in
the '70s, this endlessly exciting song
style has recently seen a revival of sorts.
Some cutting-edge artists:
Phil Collins ("[Billie] Don't Lose that
Number"): You may recognize Phil as
"that guy with facial closeups on all of
his album covers." What makes him so
vain? Must be that hip "natural
mohawk" he sports.


Chris
Harris
Milli Vanilli ("Baby, Don't For
get My Number"): Broke new
ground in the DLTN genre by yes,
ingeniously changing a few words.
They were rewarded for this daring
feat by becoming the first group to
simultaneously chart on the Bill
board Top 40 and Baskin Robbins
31. Think I'm being too harsh on
this dynamic duo? Blame it on
their name (yeah, yeah).
FOLK: Interesting name. Tty to
say it ten times fast. Without
swearing. Good folkin' luck.
Woody Guthrie said that true folk
music comes from the soul. Folk
in a soul. Now try to say that ten
times fast. Without swearing.
JAZZ: Great music; alas, it
does not lend itself well to humor.
TVo rejected attempts:
1) "Jazz is sort of like Lamaze. It
ends with a 'z'." This joke sounded
pretty funny; it wasn't until I tried
typing it out that I ran into a slight
snag.
2) I asked my dear friend
Chester if he could think of any
thing funny to say about jazz:
"Hmm. . . How about 'Miles
Davis looks like a frog?'"
"I'm not sure. The sheer wit
and brilliant subtlety of your
humor may be too much for the

reader."
"It might be too much for
YOUR readers."
DISCO: See "LAMBADA."
PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC: Gen
erally meaningless, monotonous
noise posing as something pro
found — sort of like a Virginia TCai
column.
All you Flicks groupies will wit
ness the highest example, so to
speak, of this art form when Pink
Floyd's "The Wall" is shown Satur
day night.
Listen carefully, for this film
asks the number-one most awe
inspiring, imponderable question
in the history of music: "How can
you have any pudding if you don't
eat your meat?" Of course, "Who's
Johnny?" by El Debarge runs a
close second.
And there you have it. Watch
for "The Chris Harris Non-Alpha
betical Music Dictionary
(extended dance mix]" coming
soon to a bookstore near you.
Until then, don't worry about
how I could attempt this satire on
music, and not even mention
"New Kids on the Block." They get
their own separate column next
month.

Chris Harris is a junior who is
majoring in sociology this week.
His column appears biweekly.
