# Maddalena's: a variety of marvelous, romantic meals
## 
### Alex Hoye Kristi Pado Staff writers 
Okay, we're not implying that it hap
pens all the time — and certainly not
often enough — but on occasion, a few
intrepid students seek a romantic inter
lude in a setting a bit more stimulating
than the dim lights of the Coffee House.
These would-be amorous adventur
ers are then faced with a harsh reality:
most of us are pretty ignorant about the
culinary world beyond trusty El
Camino standbys like Chili's, Jack in
the Box and Taco Bell.
As our token contribution to the
Stanford dating scene — or lack thereof
— we aim to provide these courageous
souls with a repertoire of romantic get
aways.
This week we visited Maddalena's, a
very classy Continental restaurant con
veniently located on Emerson Street,
three blocks from campus. This multi
roomed restaurant offers a variety of
atmospheres for diners to choose from:
elegant, jazzy or secluded.
In the main dining room, you will

DlN B&iate

find the traditional extravagance you
would expect from a high class restau
rant. The chandelier lights are low, and
conversation is soft at a small number
of tables arranged around a subtle
flambd grill.
The menu offers Italian and French
cuisine with descriptively titled starters
and entrees that promise excellence
with every syllable.
Your waiter will be more than helpful
with selections and never leave you
wanting for more ice in your water, a
refill of wine or the next course.
The starters are the best part of a
great meal. We recommend the Cap
pellini Basilica and the Poached Scal
lops in Puffy Pastry with Asparagus,
Buerre Blanc.
Maddalena works magic with fresh
seafood and exquisite sauces. If your
meal doesn't include a similar dish,
then vou've missed out.
Of the salads, the Maddalena Salad

is the best. It boasts an excellent blend
of spinach, butter lettuce, bay shrimp,
grated eggs, sliced mushrooms and
tomatoes, with Maddalena's special
vinaigrette dressing.
Entries include duckling, filet
mignon, New York steak, veal, fettuc
cine, tortellini, and linguini. The
Salmon Dijonaise was fresh and well
prepared. If you like sweet sauces, then
you'll love the Breast of Pheasant Grand
Marnier.
And don't let dessert pass you by; if
nothing on the list excites you, just ask
the waiter to create a custom-made sur
prise. Our waiter prepared a sumptuous
mocha-vanill a-ice-cream-almond
chocolate-sauce dish.
For a full meal, not including wine,
expect the bill to run about $80 dollars
for a couple. Fortunately, the damage is
mitigated somewhat by Maddalena's
20% student discount. If that's still too
steep for frequent visits, you need only
look in the next room.
The jazzy alternative might be much
less daunting for a first date. In the
piano bar, lights shine a little brighter
while a pianist croons ballads from the

20's and 30's which permeate the
upbeat chatter. And don't be surprised
when Mr. Maddalena drops some
friendly conversation while making his
rounds.
Cuisine in the appetizer bar is
strictly Italian: antipasta, salads, sand
wiches, pasta and pizza. A salad and
entree will run about $11 per person,
including the discount. Although the
atmosphere is lively it abounds with
Roaring Twenties romance.
And if you or your group desires
something a little more intimate, Mad
dalena's offers private dining rooms. For
$25 the restaurant provides rooms for
groups from "2 to 200." The smaller
rooms come furnished with a couch, a
bar and a signal to beckon your waiter
— or to ensure privacy. If you are inter
ested in the private rooms, keep in mind
that your student discount will not
apply and reserve a couple of weeks in
advance.
Maddalena's offers a range of prices,
superb cuisine, and a choice of atmo
spheres — all romantic. Good luck,
seekers d'amour.
