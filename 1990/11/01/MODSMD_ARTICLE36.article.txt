## League album 'Romantic/but doesn't 'Dare’ 
### 
Producers Jimmy Jam and Terry
Lewis have generally done good
work. In their efforts with Janet
Jackson, Bobby Brown and others,
the duo helped create distinctive
sounds that have worked well for
the artists.
But I wish they never met the
Human League.
Ever since Jam and Lewis joined
the League to produce "Crash,"
which featured the hit single
"Human," Phil Oakey and Co.
have been unable to return to their
early brilliance.
Trying to conform the League to
a Bobby Brown sound removed all
of the band's energetic originality
and left them with a smooth, yet
wholly incomparable sound.
Even without Jam and Lewis,
"Romantic?" finds the band caught
in a time warp between their origi
nal soul-synth style and their unin
spired R&B attempts. Most disap
pointing is the continued failure to
fully utilize the vocal talents of
Oakey and his supporting case of
Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann
Sulley.

Stuck in a slow-paced ballad for
mat, the trio's voices often tend to
be more sap than soul. But move
them into an up-tempo, up-beat
piece such as "Heart Like a Wheel,"
the first single, and the band shows
glimpses of the past.
"Soundtrack to a Generation"
finds the same formula, serving
witness to an entire generation try
ing to re-live past loves. But that
only reminds me of their mid-80s
brilliance with "Louise."
Looking back about eight years,
the band was in prime form with
its other big hit, "Don't You Want
Me?", off the album "Dare." Then
came two equally enjoyable
albums that satisfied League fans,
but didn't garner much commer
cial success.
Unfortunately, the League has
apparently opted for the latter
route. One can only hope they
return, a bit more enlightened.
