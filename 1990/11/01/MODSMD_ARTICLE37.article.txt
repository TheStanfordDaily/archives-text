# No big words for Wire Train

Wire Train
Grade: B-
According to the press release,
Wire Train's self-titled album can
be described in a plethora of large
words; the album is called
"promise and greatness, assimila
tion and mastery, plainspoken elo
quence."
The band clearly has musical
promise. But big words and Wire
Train just don't mix.
One would expect the lyrical
standards of an alternative band to
be above the level of Kylie Minogue
and Roxette.

Wire Train, however, appears
quite satisfied with one-syllable
words and banal cliches. On their
fourth album, one would think
that the band's evolution has pro
gressed farther than a fourth-grade
reading level.
The album's first release,
"Should She Cry," has an irre
sistible guitar riff and a catchy beat
to propel the song. "Moonlight
Dakota" also takes advantage of a
quick beat, using it to obscure the
shallow lyrics.
Slow tnings down, however, and
the lyrics stand out. Kevin Hunter
whines through "She" and "If You
See Her Go," which almost mock
the seriousness of unrequited love.
To Hunter's credit, however, it's
difficult to inject feeling into repet
itive choruses and lifeless verses
like "Oh me oh my oh me oh my/I
got some friends/All of them are
boys."
"Tin Jesus," the band's most
ambitious song, toys with lyrical
depth and musical emotion. But
most of "Wire Train" is just too
shallow to take seriously.
Wire Train has the musical tal
ent of a solid garage band. The next
step for the quartet is to get out of
the garage.
