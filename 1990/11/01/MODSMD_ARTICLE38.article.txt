The Carl Stalling Project
Warner Brothers
Grade: A
Carl Stalling is the man who
composed, orchestrated and con
ducted the music for nearly every
Warner Brothers cartoon made
prior to 1958.

This album is a collection of
some of his scores without any of
the dialogue. The performances
are the original takes, dug out of
the Warner Brothers archives.
The music is just what you
might expect it to be, but there are
some surprises.
The music stands remarkably
well on its own, sometimes repre
senting a delicate interplay and
synthesis of different classical
styles and compositions, some
times advancing into the out
landishly affective, vivid zaniness
which gave these cartoons their
power.
The best recommendation that
can be made for this record is that
you simply can't be unhappy, glum
or moody for more than a few min
utes after the music has begun.
The whimsical mixture of bas
soon and pizzicato strings, for
example, is sure to elicit the most
comic vision of Elmer J. Fudd, mil
lionaire, stalking our intrepid hero
Bugs, or of Wile E. Coyote tip-toe
ing behind a highway sign to catch
the Road Runner.
The music by itself never seems
childish or like "mere" cartoon
music. It is ballet music in the
truest sense, compositionally
sophisticated and visually evoca
tive.
There are pockets of 20th cen
tury classical musicians and
scholars who consider Stalling to
be one of the great originals of
American music, on the order of a
Copeland, for example.
This release may help to estab
lish Stalling as such and it is some
of the happiest, most joyful music
ever written.
