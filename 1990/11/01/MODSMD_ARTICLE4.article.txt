# Four dorms to pay with points
## Food Service conversion should save students money 
### Anna Rabinowicz 
Wilbur, Stern and Florence Moore Hall residents
will have one less thing to complain about next year
when University Food Service converts the resi
dences from the board plan to the point system.
Keith Guy, director of Housing and Food Services,
said the dorms will be converted in response to
University budget cuts. The new undergraduate
dorm Kimball Hall, now under construction, will also
use the point system, Guy said.
The new system will be modeled on the & la carte
food plan currently being used at Ricker Dining Hall
in Sterling Quad. This system assigns points to indi
vidual food items roughly corresponding to food cost.
Point costs are deducted from students' accounts.
Guy said he hopes to implement a system in which
students are eating precisely what they're paying for.
He said those who eat less are discriminated against
in the all-you-can-eat board system.
"In the board system, people who are light eaters
are subsidizing those who are heavy eaters," he said.
In dorms utilizing the board system, students
purchase either a 14- or 19-meal plan; in Sterling
Quad, students select the light or regular plan and
can buy additional points if necessary. The 4 la carte
plan is cost-effective, since the regular plan costs
almost the same amount as the 14-meal plan, accord
ing to Guy.
"Even if students run out of points, any addition

al points they spend would only just approach the
cost of the 19-meal plan," according to Sue Peletta,
manager of Ricker Dining Hall.
Improvement of food quality is another motiva
tion for the change. "If something is not prepared
well, it won't be purchased," Guy said, adding he
hopes to increase the flexibility and choice of food
service.
Ricker Dining Hall currently offers a larger selec
tion of entrees and desserts than do dorms using the
board plan, as well as frozen yogurt, freshly baked
cookies, candy bars, bottled juices and sparkling
sodas.
Guy said that Wilbur, Stern and Flo Mo were cho
sen for the transformation because it is less costly to
convert their dining rooms to self-contained serving
areas than it would be in dorms such as Roble and
Lagunita. Conversion will involve bringing all food,
including salad bars, into the serving area, where the
items can be priced at a cash register.
"This is the first phase of a possible conversion of
the entire campus to the point system," Guy said.
This year, University Food Service's budget-cut
ting goal was to save $130,000 through such meth
ods as consolidating part-time labor and manage
ment positions and eliminating the meal exchange
card program. "When [operating] costs us more, we
must pass those costs on to the students," Guy said.
