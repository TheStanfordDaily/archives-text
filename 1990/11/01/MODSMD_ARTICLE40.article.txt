# Hopper's 'Hot Spot' has heat, but no sizzle

The Hot Spot
Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen
Grade: 8-
The posters assert "Safe is never
sex. It's dangerous." The ads claim
"Film noir for the '905." The trail
ers call Dennis Hopper the most
controversial filmmaker in Amer
ica. The film delivers Virginia
Madsen shaving her legs and Don
Johnson contracting his dimpled
butt.
Now, I am not saying that see
ing Virginia shave her legs or Don
squeeze his cheeks is all there is to
"The Hot Spot." A lot of major
events and subplots fill out the
film. It's entertaining, but in a
benign sort of way. This is defi
nitely a film that aspires to be film
noir.
Adapted from Charles Williams
novel, "Hell Hath No Fury," the
film has the story and all the basic
elements it needs. A mysterious
drifter named Harry Maddox (Don
Johnson) appears one hot day in
Taylor, Tbxas. He lands a job sell
ing cars and soon meets his boss'
sexpot wife Dolly (Virginia Mad
sen).
She lures a reluctant Maddox
into a torrid affair. At the same
time, Maddox becomes intrigued
with the virginal Gloria Harper
(Jennifer Connelly). And to top it
off, she has a dark secret that she
tries to hide from the world.
One of the critical non-sexual
events, a bank robbery, takes place
during the first half instead of serv

ing as the climax. On paper, I am
sure this seemed to assure the rest
of the film had an overt tension,
but it does not play out that way —
a problem characteristic of the
whole film.
The central failure of Hopper's
direction is that he fails to give the
film an edge. There's plenty of sex,
but no sense of danger or suspense.
It moves lethargically, never shift
ing into high gear.
A lot of attention goes into
stressing that the characters and
the whole town are burdened by
the heat of the sun. Maddox
always sweats, the pavement per
petually shimmers from the heat,
and the thermometer continually
stays in the high '90s.
Perhaps Hopper's main prob
lem is that he so convinces his
actors that they are withering
under the heat that they lack the
energy to send this film over the
top.
The three lead actors are all per
fectly suited to play their respective
roles. Johnson capitalizes on his
Sonny Crockett past, but I wish he
had given his performance a little
more volatility. And as the
temptress Dolly, Madsen does not
break any ground, but she is defi
nitely watchable.
"The Hot Spot" feels like a sin
cere attempt to update film noir.
The problem is that more needs to
be done than just adding a lot of
steamy sex scenes.
