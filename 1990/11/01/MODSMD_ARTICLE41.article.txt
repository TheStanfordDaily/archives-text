Quigley Down Under
Tom Selleck, Laura San Gla
como
Grade: C
Tbm Selleck hasn't had much of
a movie career. Despite being voted
the sexiest man in America and
starring in several major motion
pictures, Selleck just never seems
to get a role in which I can picture
him as anything other than Mag
num, P.I.
In his latest endeavor, "Quigley
Down Under," Selleck's Matthew
Quigley is the consummate good
guy, an American who journeys to
Australia for some adventure and
to make some money. B-e 112 or e
he's on the continent for five min
utes, he helps an elderly couple
cross the street and protects a
young prostitute from the ravaging
hands of three horny ruffians.
From this enthralling beginning,
Quigley goes out to meet his
employer, who is no one else but
Hans, the bad guy who led the ter
rorist pack in "Die Hard."
In order to not give away the
amazing plot development and the

intricate and surprising twists of
the storyline, I'll only tell you that
Quigley refuses to murder aborig
ines as his employer would like —
the moral conflict of the movie.
The biggest problem with the
film is its overwhelming trans
parency. The foreshadowing and
the simple plot make the end of the
movie a lesser concern.
Despite the impressive scenery,
the well-done editing, and the ade
quate cinematography, the totally
predictable, television-like plot ren
ders the movie nothing more than
mediocre.
In addition, the acting, except
for Selleck's rather bland perfor
mance, is pretty bad. The villain
and his cronies are the typical
sadistic slobs, and Quigley is the
typical give-'em-every-chance good
guy.
Overall, "Quigley Down Under"
would have made a decent Monday
Night Movie for one of the net
works. It also would have been a
great "Magnum, P. 1." show; how
ever, as an expensive experience on
the big silver screen, it was lacking.
