# King's 'Graveyard' deserves to be buried

Graveyard Shift
David Andrews, Kelly Wolf
Grade: D
In the past 15 years, there have
been 16 films based on works by
that prolific master of horror,
Stephen King.
A few of these were well done,
like "Stand By Me" (1986) and the
horror classic "The Shining," and
even "Carrie" (1976) has been a
favorite among some.
But most of the movies are
black marks in the annuls of
Stephen King's life and of the genre
of horror films in general, having
generated more laughs than
screams.
There was the campy Emilio
Estevez flick "Maximum Over
drive" (1986), the abominable
"Creepshow 11/' last year's dopey
"Pet Sematary" — the list is far too
long and depressing for any of you
King fans out there to have to read.
Unfortunately, "Graveyard
Shift," the new film based on a
short story by the same name in
Stephen King's anthology Night
Shift, is in keeping with this long,
terrible tradition.
The plot of "Graveyard Shift" is
simple and rather typical of King's
stories.

It centers around the reopening
of an abandoned textile mill in
Maine. A group of workers is
assigned to clean out the building,
including the basement which is
infested with hordes of rats.
But soon they discover the rats
are the least of their problems —
an unimaginable horror is alive
and awaiting them beneath the
adjacent (of course) cemetery.
Aaaaaaaaaaagh! Yawn.
Well, at least there are those
deep and enigmatic characters so
common to "the master's" works,
right?
Not.
Some claim that the complexity
of the Stephen King's works makes
them almost impossible to trans
late to the screen. Yeah, that's what
I thought when I saw "Cujo."
No, rather, I think that produc
ers see green and equate the name
of the best-selling author with big
money. They grab any of his works,
change it around a bit, and, espe
cially if it's originally a short story,
stretch out a possibly interesting
idea into a 90-minute bore.
Such is the case with "Grave
yard Shift."
