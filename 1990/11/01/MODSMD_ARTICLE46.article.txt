## Couple share art, controversy together 
### Jill Antonides Staff writer 
Jesse Helms may not have gotten his way, as
his amendment to curb National Endowment
for the Arts funding for art deemed "porno
graphic," "homoerotic" or in other ways
"obscene" was defeated in both the House and
the Senate.
But his censorship efforts have created a rip
ple of discussion surrounding the threat to free
dom of expression, especially in the arts. Â»
This and other currently relevant social and
political topics will be the focus of a free lecture
and performance by Bay Area artists Ellen
Webb and Sandy Walker. The event takes place
tonight from 8 to 9:30 p.m. in Annenberg Audi
torium.
Webb, a dancer and choreographer, and
Walker, a painter, have been collaborating for
several years. They met in 1977 at the Ameri
can Dance Festival.
Webb, a Bay Area native, was dancing with
Douglas Dunn's company in New York at the
time, and Dunn had invited non-dancers to
perform in a workshop. Walker participated.
Their first collaboration was in 1979, a com
bination of dance and painting which explored

how the two media relate and interrelate. The
two married in 1981.
Currently, Webb has her own dance com
pany in Oakland and directs the Talking Dance
Project, a lecture series on current dance
related topics. Walker is represented in many
prominent art collections, including the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum
of Modern Art.
The artistic pair will perform excerpts from
three pieces created this year, all inextricably
connected to social concerns. The first is a
piece created in response to the Loma Prieta
earthquake and the collapse of the Cypress free
way in Oakland.
"It is both a memorial to those who died in
the collapse, and a celebration of the West Oak
land community's ability to bind together and
respond to the disaster," Walker explained.
Another piece responds to the crisis sur
rounding freedom of expression and the effect
of Helms' NEA discussions. Originally a six
hour "dance installation" performed at the Uni
versity Art Museum at UC-Berkeley's campus,
this piece is described by Walker as "dance in
the area between dance and sculpture."
Helms may have been shot down in
Congress, but Walker and Webb do not believe

the battle is over.
"In a sense, Helms is getting his way,
Walker explained. "In response to his pressure,
the NEA responds with a process to escape
exposure to political controversy. In the end,
controversial art of state-endorsed artists get
funded and established, while 'other' artists are
kept marginal. This has often been the case, but
the best of society's art as a whole should be
supported."
The third excerpt will be from another
"dance installation," which was part of a flag
show at the San Francisco Art Institute. This
piece is about the U.S. flag and another familiar
controversy involving freedom of expression.
In addition to showing some of their works,
Walker and Webb will talk about being artists
working in social and historical contexts.
Has the threat of censorship changed the
way Walker and Webb work? Walker believes so.
"I think these issues push artists out of com
fortable positions. In these three pieces, Ellen
and I have employed a different process and the
result is a different product."
Despite the negative effects, though, the
Helms specter has had a unifying influence on
artists.
