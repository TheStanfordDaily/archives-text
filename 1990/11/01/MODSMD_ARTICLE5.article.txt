## 
### Cynthia Benton Staff writer 
In an attempt to raise awareness in the
Stanford community about the issue of home
lessness, a student group is hosting a "sleep
out" tonight in White Plaza.
Junior Verna Kuo, chair of the Stanford
Homelessness Action Coalition, said by spend
ing a night outside, the group wants to "say
[homelessness] is an issue."
"We're not going to be out there pretending
we're homeless for a night — that would be
ridiculous," said junior Jeff Chen, a member of
SHAC. "We mainly want to raise awareness on
the Stanford campus."
The event begins at 10 p.m. with an array of
speakers that Kuo said are involved in differ
ent aspects of the problem of homelessness.
The speakers are Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stan
ford; Jim Burklo, director of Urban Ministries
of Palo Alto; Catherine Milton, director of the
Haas Center for Public Service; Navida Butler,
director of the Ecumenical Hunger Program;
and Todd Rubin, a Stanford student who has
stopped out for the year to work with the
homeless.
Some of the speakers are involved with
direct service to the homeless. According to
SHAC members, Burklo plans to bring with
him homeless people to speak. Milton has been
instrumental in "getting SHAC started and
keeping it going," according to Kuo.

A homeless man stops for lunch at St. Anthony's Church In Msnlo Park. Psopls eating at the church's soup
kitchen had mixed opinions about tonight's sleep-out In White Plaza.
During the speeches, students
will hold candles to show their
support. At about 1 a.m., the
sleep-out participants will fill
helium balloons to represent the
number of homeless people in San
Mateo County — estimated at
8,665 people. Then the students
will string the balloons from
White Plaza to the Quad.
"This will be a great visual rep
resentation ... that students will
see the next morning on their way
to class," Kuo said.
The sleep-out is free and open
to everyone to participate. "Warm
clothes and a sleeping bag" are
necessities to bring, according to
Kuo.
SHAC member Ryan Fitzpatrick,
a sophomore, also suggested peo
ple should bring "a good attitude
and maybe a guitar."
Homeless people from the soup
kitchens and shelters where
SHAC volunteers work have been
invited to attend the sleep-out.
"There could be anywhere from
50 to 500 homeless," according to
Kuo.
"We want to get our message
across but not cause a problem,"
said Fitzpatrick. "Ideally if there
is a problem, we hope that we will
be able to take care of it our
selves," he said. SHAC has noti-

Tied the Stanford police about
their sleep-out.
The main soup kitchen with
which SHAC is involved is the
Urban Ministry of Palo Alto,
where the students help out with
clean-up and serving four times a
week. They also work with St.
Anthony's Church in Menlo Park.
Fitzpatrick said the best thing
about working at the soup
kitchens is that "you can sit down
at a table with 10 or 12 homeless
people and have lunch with them.
They are no different from us."
Starting next week, SHAC will
also volunteer at the Bill Wilson
House, a shelter for homeless
youths in Santa Clara. Chen said
the group will go there three to
four times per week to help the
youths with their homework as
well as act as role models.
SHAC is also planning to spon
sor a hunger and homelessness
awareness week at the end of win
ter quarter, with panels and
speakers to help educate the
Stanford campus about these
issues, according to sophomore
member Becca Bracy.
Last fall, SHAC helped the
local Hunger and Homeless
Action Coalition complete a needs
assessment survey for the Bay
Area. "We interviewed homeless
people to find out their needs and
to find out whether they find cur
rent services helpful," Bracy said.
