In an attempt to raise awareness in the
Stanford community about the issue of home
lessness, a student group is hosting a "sleep
out" tonight in White Plaza.
Junior Verna Kuo, chair of the Stanford
Homelessness Action Coalition, said by spend
ing a night outside, the group wants to "say
[homelessness] is an issue."
"We're not going to be out there pretending
we're homeless for a night — that would be
ridiculous," said junior Jeff Chen, a member of
SHAC. "We mainly want to raise awareness on
the Stanford campus."
The event begins at 10 p.m. with an array of
speakers that Kuo said are involved in differ
ent aspects of the problem of homelessness.
The speakers are Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stan
ford; Jim Burklo, director of Urban Ministries
of Palo Alto; Catherine Milton, director of the
Haas Center for Public Service; Navida Butler,
director of the Ecumenical Hunger Program;
and Todd Rubin, a Stanford student who has
stopped out for the year to work with the
homeless.
Some of the speakers are involved with
direct service to the homeless. According to
SHAC members, Burklo plans to bring with
him homeless people to speak. Milton has been
instrumental in "getting SHAC started and
keeping it going," according to Kuo.
