# Local homeless are vocal, disillusioned

### Cynthia Benton Staff writer 
Most of the homeless people who frequent
the soup kitchen at St. Anthony's Church are
optimistic about tonight's "sleep-out," a Stan
ford event to call attention to their plight.
Although these people were willing to talk
about the issue of homelessness and the sleep
out, sponsored by the Stanford Homelessness
Action Coalition, none would give their names
to The Daily during interviews at lunch Satur
day.
The sleep-out, an all-night event consisting
of speakers and a candlelight vigil, is "a good
idea," according to one man. "Awareness of the
homeless problem should be increased," he
said.
A younger man, who said he is homeless by
choice, gave a different perspective on the
SHAC event. "I've been to many of them. It's
not really going to raise the consciousness.
Sleep-outs are not original. It's proven that
they don't work," he said.
"Sure I'm homeless, but to me its no big
deal," he said later. "This planet is my home."
He said he travels around the country getting
involved with different social
causes.
"I don't want to be a part of the
system. I feel like I'm working for
God," he said.
In general, the homeless
seemed to be very political aware

and highly disillusioned.
"We need to stop sending
money to other countries and
keep it at home," one middle-aged
man said. "If you had a family
and you had a dollar, and you
needed that dollar for your family,
you'd keep that dollar, right? Why
doesn't the government keep its
money for this country? Our
national debt is created by giving
it away.

In the middle of the room at St.
Anthony's are tables and chairs
reminiscent of a typical high
school cafeteria, and at the oppo
site end next to the door is a hot
food line.
Along with regular hot meals,
the soup kitchen provides loaves
of bread and other food piled high
on long tables against one wall,
which people can take with them
to eat later.
