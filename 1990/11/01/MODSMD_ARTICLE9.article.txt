# 'Bugs' plague Cowell phones
## Students say emergency calls went unanswered 
### Miranda Doyle 
A new voice mail telephone system and a change
in emergency staffing at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter have caused problems recently for several stu
dents trying to get medical care.
In the most serious case, a student was hospital
ized after her pneumonia went untreated because
she could not get through to Cowell to find out the
results of her tests.
Two other situations resulted from confusion
over how to get assistance in an emergency after 5
p.m., when only one Cowell staff member is on duty.
Because of budget cuts, nurses are only available
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. rather than all night as it was
last year. From 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., emergency calls
must be made to 723-4861 rather than to Cowell's
regular number, 723-4841.
This change was announced on the Cowell
answering machine only after a resident assistant
complained because she had difficulty getting help
through the regular number. The new number also
should be used in an emergency after 11 p.m., when
the calls are transferred to the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic.
According to John Dorman, Cowell's director of
public relations and outreach, the health center
switched to a voice mail system to improve service.
The new system asks callers to press numbers on
their touch-tone telephones that will route their
calls to the proper departments within Cowell.
This will save the main receptionist at Cowell
from answering every phone call. The voice mail sys
tem is also set up so that no one who calls gets a busy
signal.
But getting "the wrinkles and bugs out of (the
new system) is a mcgor concern for us," Dorman
said. "I think ultimately it will serve the students
better."
For sophomore Michaela Simpson, however, the
"wrinkles and bugs" turned out to be dangerous.
Simpson said she went to Cowell Oct. 18 for tests
because she "felt sick and had a 104 (degree) temper
ature." She said she was told to call back for the
results the next day between 2 and 5 p.m., but when
she tried to call, she could not get through.
Simpson said she listened to the recorded mes
sage, then pushed a button to talk to her doctor.
Greeted by a busy signal, she said she tried calling
four more times.

Hoping to talk to an operator, Simpson said she
stayed on the line after the message. She was then
put on hold and told by a recording that an operator
was not available.
Too sick to go to Cowell in person, Simpson
remained in her room over the weekend as her sick
ness grew worse. She did not find out she had pneu
monia until she was hospitalized last week. She
remained in the hospital for four days and is
presently recuperating at her home in Southern Cal
ifornia.
"I definitely think (the phone problem) can be
detrimental to someone's health," she said in a tele
phone interview. "I believe I was diagnosed a lot later
than I could have been."
Dorman said the system was repaired Sunday, the
latest in a series of attempts to correct the problem
of people pushing the numbers but not getting
through. "We think we have corrected it. We'll just
have to wait and see," he said.
Jennifer Mason, an RAin Otero, said she had dif
ficulties getting help in an emergency that occurred
toward the end of this year's Orientation. Mason
said a female student cut her hand and received
stitches at Cowell.
But the stitches came open at about 5:20 p.m.
Mason called the health center, was transferred to
the Palo Alto clinic and then transferred again to
Stanford Hospital.
"They had me on hold forever," she said. Finally,
an RF ran to Cowell and found a nurse there.
According to Dorman, the emergency number for
calling this nurse is now part of the answering
machine message.
Leonor Diaz, an RA at Soto, said she had an expe
rience similar to Mason's. She said she tried to call
Cowell to find out what to do about a student who
was feeling sick and dizzy at 3 a.m. She was con
nected to an emergency room nurse at the Hospital
who was too busy to listen to the symptoms and
decide if the student should be brought in, she said.
Diaz, who is a second-year RA, said she did not
realize that the 24-hour infirmary had been elimi
nated because of budget cuts. Last year "you would
call and a nurse would be there all the time," she
said.
It turned out that the student was all right, Diaz
said, but the situation "was weird because it was so
unclear. I didn't get connected to the right person."

nated because of budget cuts. Last year "you would
call and a nurse would be there all the time," she
said.
It turned out that the student was all right, Diaz
said, but the situation "was weird because it was so
unclear. I didn't get connected to the right person."
A new voice mail telephone system and a change
in emergency staffing at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter have caused problems recently for several stu
dents trying to get medical care.
In the most serious case, a student was hospital
ized after her pneumonia went untreated because
she could not get through to Cowell to find out the
results of her tests.
Two other situations resulted from confusion
over how to get assistance in an emergency after 5
p.m., when only one Cowell staff member is on duty.
Because of budget cuts, nurses are only available
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. rather than all night as it was
last year. From 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., emergency calls
must be made to 723-4861 rather than to Cowell's
regular number, 723-4841.
This change was announced on the Cowell
answering machine only after a resident assistant
complained because she had difficulty getting help
through the regular number. The new number also
should be used in an emergency after 11 p.m., when
the calls are transferred to the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic.
According to John Dorman, Cowell's director of
public relations and outreach, the health center
switched to a voice mail system to improve service.
The new system asks callers to press numbers on
their touch-tone telephones that will route their
calls to the proper departments within Cowell.
This will save the main receptionist at Cowell
from answering every phone call. The voice mail sys
tem is also set up so that no one who calls gets a busy
signal.
But getting "the wrinkles and bugs out of (the
new system) is a mcgor concern for us," Dorman
said. "I think ultimately it will serve the students
better."
For sophomore Michaela Simpson, however, the
"wrinkles and bugs" turned out to be dangerous.
Simpson said she went to Cowell Oct. 18 for tests
because she "felt sick and had a 104 (degree) temper
ature." She said she was told to call back for the
results the next day between 2 and 5 p.m., but when
she tried to call, she could not get through.
Simpson said she listened to the recorded mes
sage, then pushed a button to talk to her doctor.
Greeted by a busy signal, she said she tried calling
four more times.

Hoping to talk to an operator, Simpson said she
stayed on the line after the message. She was then
put on hold and told by a recording that an operator
was not available.
Too sick to go to Cowell in person, Simpson
remained in her room over the weekend as her sick
ness grew worse. She did not find out she had pneu
monia until she was hospitalized last week. She
remained in the hospital for four days and is
presently recuperating at her home in Southern Cal
ifornia.
"I definitely think (the phone problem) can be
detrimental to someone's health," she said in a tele
phone interview. "I believe I was diagnosed a lot later
than I could have been."
Dorman said the system was repaired Sunday, the
latest in a series of attempts to correct the problem
of people pushing the numbers but not getting
through. "We think we have corrected it. We'll just
have to wait and see," he said.
Jennifer Mason, an RAin Otero, said she had dif
ficulties getting help in an emergency that occurred
toward the end of this year's Orientation. Mason
said a female student cut her hand and received
stitches at Cowell.
But the stitches came open at about 5:20 p.m.
Mason called the health center, was transferred to
the Palo Alto clinic and then transferred again to
Stanford Hospital.
"They had me on hold forever," she said. Finally,
an RF ran to Cowell and found a nurse there.
According to Dorman, the emergency number for
calling this nurse is now part of the answering
machine message.
Leonor Diaz, an RA at Soto, said she had an expe
rience similar to Mason's. She said she tried to call
Cowell to find out what to do about a student who
was feeling sick and dizzy at 3 a.m. She was con
nected to an emergency room nurse at the Hospital
who was too busy to listen to the symptoms and
decide if the student should be brought in, she said.
Diaz, who is a second-year RA, said she did not
realize that the 24-hour infirmary had been elimi
nated because of budget cuts. Last year "you would
call and a nurse would be there all the time," she
said.
It turned out that the student was all right, Diaz
said, but the situation "was weird because it was so
unclear. I didn't get connected to the right person."
