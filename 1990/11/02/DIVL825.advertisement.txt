TRS
GETS YOUR RESUME
INTO THE RIGHT HANDS
Targeted Recruiting Services (TRS) matches students from the top schools
with recruiters from hundreds of leading employers.
HOW DOES TRS WORK?
Fill out the Student Profile questionnaire on the
opposite page and send it hack to us along with your
resume. We put your questionnaire and a digitized copy
of your resume onto a sophisticated computer system.
Employers from all industries —consulting, publishing,
retail, high-tech, banking, and many more — turn to
TRS for recruiting the best candidates from all fields of
study. We send your resume to the employers:
employers who are looking for someone with your
specific interests and qualifications.
On the back of the Student Profile Questionnaire, you
will find dozens of employers interested in hiring
students like yourself. When you find an employer that
you might like to work for, simply indicate your interest
on the hack of the questionnaire.
In addition to those employers, hundreds of other
companies will also be using TRS to find summer and
permanent employees. When they need students with
specific qualifications (major, willingness to relocate,
language ability, etc.), they call us and we send them
resumes fitting their needs. If you participate in TRS
and it you fit their criteria, your resume will
automatically be sent.
WHY SHOULD I USE TRS?
Employers can't hire you if they don't know about you.
I RS can help you find the job you want by getting your
resume into the hands of recruiters throughout the
nation.
Once you send us your resume and Student Profile
Questionnaire, we do all the work. Your resume is sent
out each and every time an employer requests
candidates with your qualifications. Since employers
receive your actual resume (not just a questionnaire
summary), they receive the most attractive and
comprehensive presentation of your skills and abilities.
There is never a placement fee for successful hires
through TRS. The only cost is the one-time $15
registration fee. This is tar less than it would cost you to
mail your resume to the hundreds of employers who use
I RS (not to mention the time and effort you avoid).
Moreover, employers who receive your resume through
TRS pay attenton to your resume because they
requested it; it is not one of the hundreds or even
thousands ot unsolicited resumes that they receive each
month.
To help you in your job search, every participant in
I RS receives a free copy ot the Industry Profile of his or
her choice. Each of these booklets provides a
comprehensive overview of an industry, describing
typical career paths, entry level positions, salary, skill
requirements, industry trends and more. There are ten
different industries to choose from.
TAKE THE FIRST STEP:
Send in the Student Profile questionnaire on the opposite page, or call I-800-TRS-JOBS
