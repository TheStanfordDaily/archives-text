Once in a Lifetime, You Get the Chance
To Do Something That Really Matters
Generations of brilliant Engineers,
Physicists and Scientists have
advanced our civilization's
technology to its theoretical limits.
The Superconducting Super
Collider (SSC) is a basic research
laboratory under development in
Dallas, Texas, designed to shatter
those limits.
The SSC Laboratory will be an
underground oval concrete tunnel
containing two rings of metal pipe
54 miles in circumference. Encased
in powerful electromagnets, under
high vacuum, at ultralow
temperature, narrow beams of
protons will whirl around the
tunnel in opposite directions at
nearly the speed of light, producing
an energy of twenty trillion
electron volts. Head-on collisions
will turn energy into a tiny fireball
and a shower of subnuclear
particles a hundred million times
every second as the beams are
made to intersect in experimental
halls around the ring.
As a major research and
development center, the SSC
Laboratory will support 2,000 staff
members, including an elite group
of innovators whose studies will
advance our understanding of the
structure of matter and impact
virtually every aspect of scientific
and technological developments
known to mankind for generations
yet to come.
Super Collider
Jusl as the SSC Laboratory will provide technological
advancements that will impact our future, so too will it
provide extraordinary career opportunities for
professional advancement. Several career and term
positions are available at various levels with die SSC
Laboratory. Additionally, the following professionals are
