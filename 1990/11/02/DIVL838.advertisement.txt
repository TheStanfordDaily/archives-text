The Bank of the '90s
for the Achiever of the '90s
In the '80s, we learned that a suceessful track record doesn't guarantee any company's future. Instead,
continuing success depends upon a combination of strategic thinking, strong management, and clear ob
jectives. Today, that philosophy is setting the direction for Bank of America nationwide. And the '90s
couldn't look better.
As the premier provider of retail and wholesale banking services in the Western U.S., we are over Sl(K) billion
strong as well as the second largest bank holding company in the U.S. And, in addition to continued growth
in new markets throughout the country, we have also continued to improve our foreign credit portfolio.
Right now, we're looking for students ready to tackle a decade full of possibilities and potential success. If
