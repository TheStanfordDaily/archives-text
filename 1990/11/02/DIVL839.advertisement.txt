If you're the best in your class,
your career should be one failure after another.
Engineers
Failure is our business. We are the largest and most
experienced engineering consulting firm in the
nation specializing in the analysis and prevention
of mechanical, structural, and materials failure.
Founded in 1967 by a group of Stanford engineers,
we've since analyzed thousands of failures - from
airplanecrashestobuilding collapses, from power
plant failures to supertanker sinkings. We've inves
tigated highly publicized disasters like the Decem
ber 1989 crane collapse in downtown San Fran
cisco. We've provided technical advice in areas as
different as NASA's space shuttle and children's
toys. We offer some of the most challenging and
fascinating engineering work available anywhere.
We're seeking December MS and PhD graduates
in Mechanical, Civil/Structural, Materials, and
Environmental Engineering. If you're an academic
standout and a hands-on problem solver, we invite
you to join us for an on-campus interview.
