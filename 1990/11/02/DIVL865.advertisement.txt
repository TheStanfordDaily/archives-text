The "real world" is approaching fast, so take advantage of your Stanford
student status and buy a Macintosh computer at a price that fits a"student"
budget. Then use your new Macintosh to transcibe your notes, crank
out that spreadsheet, polish off statistics and polish up that English
paper. What's more, once you've mastered one application you can
use them all, because every Macintosh software application works the
same way. And since every Macintosh runs the same powerful
software and is expandable, it can grow with you on into the "real
world".
There are many existing models to choose from plus three
brand new ones — all at prices which anyone can afford. Stop by the
Stanford bookstore and see for yourself. But hurry, you'll be off the "farm"
and into the "real world" sooner than you think.
