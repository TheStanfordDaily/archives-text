### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Eighty students representing a wide
spectrum of Stanford life will gather at the
Bechtel International Center this after
noon to kick off the COP-coordinated Lead
ership Summit.
The summit, which is the culmination of
months of preparation on the part of ASSU
leaders and University staff, will last
through Sunday. Participants say they
expect the summit to fulfill its goal of fos
tering communication among campus com
munities.
"I think it's going to be a great forum for
the different campus groups to compare
goals and hopefully help each other out in
accomplishing those goals," said sophomore
Beth Morgan, an ASSU senator who will
participate as a representative of the sen

ate's Student Affairs Committee.
Tomorrow, the participants will gather
at Hoover House, the residence of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, to compare
notes on the goals of their communities and
discuss the summit's three areas of focus:
leadership, multiculturalism and public
service.
Participants will reconvene Sunday at
the I-Center for a goal-setting session.
"I'm very optimistic," said COP member
and summit coordinator Goodwin Liu. He
said he was pleased with the breadth of par
ticipation from the various campus commu
nities.
By yesterday afternoon, 16 of 17 tar
geted communities had appointed their rep
resentatives.
