## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Eighty students representing a wide
spectrum of Stanford life will gather at the
Bechtel International Center this after
noon to kick off the COP-coordinated Lead
ership Summit.
The summit, which is the culmination of
months of preparation on the part of ASSU
leaders and University staff, will last
through Sunday. Participants say they
expect the summit to fulfill its goal of fos
tering communication among campus com
munities.
"I think it's going to be a great forum for
the different campus groups to compare
goals and hopefully help each other out in
accomplishing those goals," said sophomore
Beth Morgan, an ASSU senator who will
participate as a representative of the sen

ate's Student Affairs Committee.
Tomorrow, the participants will gather
at Hoover House, the residence of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, to compare
notes on the goals of their communities and
discuss the summit's three areas of focus:
leadership, multiculturalism and public
service.
Participants will reconvene Sunday at
the I-Center for a goal-setting session.
"I'm very optimistic," said COP member
and summit coordinator Goodwin Liu. He
said he was pleased with the breadth of par
ticipation from the various campus commu
nities.
By yesterday afternoon, 16 of 17 tar
geted communities had appointed their rep
resentatives.
Chris Hayes, an officer of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center said he was having trouble
finding people to represent his
community.
Also, two communities — the
I-Center and the press and media
— were one short of their targets
of three representatives. The
Daily declined to participate in
the summit.
Thirteen additional students
requested to attend as at-large
representatives and were all
appointed by the COR Liu said
these students were "mostly over
flow from the (invited) communi
ties" that had more interested
students than allotted represen
tatives.
Some categories, such as public
service, encompass more groups

than could be represented in the
originally allotted number. Liu
said the at-large system allowed
such student organizations to
attend.
Also, two of the at-large repre
sentatives are resident assistants
who were not included in the
eight appointed RAs.
Liu said the participants
include at least 41 women, 37 stu
dents of color, six Jews and four
international students.
Several communities are
preparing for the summit by
meeting and giving suggestions
and input to their representatives
on what to say and do this week
end.
Several summit participants
said they look forward to having
their voices heard this weekend.
"Our goal is to open up com
munication lines," according to
junior Vanessa Perry, who will
attend the summit as a represen
tative of the Intersorority Coun
cil.
"I think the Greek system has
been misunderstood in a lot ot
ways.

Perry said that in addition to
clearing up the stereotypes, she
hoped to find people from other
communities who could work
with the Greek system on its phi
lanthropic pursuits.
Darrell Armstrong, one of the
at-large representatives, said he
chose to apply because he wanted
to contribute to the discussion on
the three focuses of the summit.
Armstrong, a senior who is a
co-founder of the Black Church at
Stanford, said he expects "to gain
the perspectives of people who are
going to go out in the world and
make a difference."
Other students were less sure
of what the summit holds for
them. "Actually, I don't know
quite what to expect," said senior
Rebecca Clyde, a resident assis
tant in 558 Mayfield. Clyde was
invited to attend the summit by
Liu, a resident of her dorm.
Clyde said she likes the idea of
student representatives from dif
ferent communities gathering to
talk to one another. "The whole
concept behind it is fantastic,"
she said.
