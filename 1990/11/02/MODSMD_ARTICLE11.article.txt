# Males discuss gender issues
## Support group focuses on men's sexuality and spirituality 
### Sarah Truitt Staff writer 
Seven years ago, Doug Daher
was concerned that not much was
being done to help men examine
their masculinity.
Realizing that an extensive
amount of support was available
for women's investigation into
gender issues, he felt the time had
come for men to have this oppor
tunity too.
Daher, a clinical psychologist
on staff at Counseling and Psy
chological Services, took action
and started a unique all-male
group that focuses on sexuality
and spirituality.
The group began its seventh
year last Friday, but only three
men attended the first meeting
due to poor publicity, according to
Daher. Six to seven men are
needed to have the group, but in
the past there have been as many
as 12 to 15.
Society presents sexuality and
spirituality as "a crossroads,"
Daher said. "Men in their early

20s feel that they have to (choose
one) and abandon the other."
Because Daher believes themes
of spirituality and sexuality over
lap for many people, the group
focuses on comparing the two.
"We discover that our culture
doesn't allow people to talk about
their own spirit, and it is the most
personal" of all the topics dis
cussed, he said.
The group is divided up into
three different stages, one for
each academic quarter.
During fall quarter, Daher has
the men concentrate on what he
calls "intellectual" concerns
which are less personal and make
it easier for the men to get to
know each other.
These might include the differ
ences between masculinity and
femininity, how people relate to
men, or issues of competition.
For winter quarter, the men
discuss more personal things
about sexuality, such as father
son relationships, different per
ceptions of male and female bodies
or sexual behavior.

The spring quarter is very chal
lenging because, according to
Daher, the group must find com
mon ground as he encourages the
men to talk about how spirituality
and sexuality intersect.
In 1987-88, the men in the
group wanted to do more the next
year, but usually Daher only
wants people in the group for a
year. The men understood that
they could not repeat the experi
ence, but they met in the summer
and through the school year of
1988-89 to work on a men's jour
nal.
Published in May 1989, it was
titled "Sons Rising" and was
funded by the ASSU Publication
Board. It contained articles about
male concerns and short stories
and poetry by men.
The journal received positive
responses both locally and nation
ally, but the next year, only two of
the students of the group that
published the journal were left,
and the enthusiasm for the publi
cation did not continue.
