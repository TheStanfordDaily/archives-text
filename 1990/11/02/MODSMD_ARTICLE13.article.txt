Anti-imperial extremists plant bombs
as Japanese coronation draws near
TOKYO (AP) â€” Two bombs set by anti-imperial extremists
rocked a Tokyo police dormitory late yesterday, killing one officer
and injuring five others, police reported.
The Metropolitan Police Department also found explosives at a
second dormitory and at a public restroom in western Tokyo early
today.
The attack comes as Japan is mobilizing its largest security
operation to stave off violence by anti-imperial extremists who
have vowed to disrupt the enthronement ceremonies of Emperor
Akihito.
The Nov. 12 civil coronation is to be attended by representa
tives from more than 150 countries, including Vice President Dan
Quayle and Prince Charles of Britain.
A police official said the three incidents were being viewed as a
single campaign by the extremists.
Left-wing extremists are against the institution of the emper
or, which they view as the core of imperialist sentiments among
conservative Japanese.
