LONDON (AP) — Deputy Prime Minister
Sir Geoffrey Howe resigned from the govern
ment yesterday, following a rift with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher over Britain's
commitment to Europe.
His resignation came five days after Howe
suggested in a television interview that
Thatcher would eventually drop her adamant
opposition to a single European currency.
In his letter of resignation, Howe said, "I
am deeply anxious that the mood you have
struck .... will make it more difficult for
Britain to hold and retain a position of influ
ence in this vital debate."
"I do not believe that I can any longer serve
with honor as a member of your government."
Thatcher responded that she did not
believe their differences are as great as Howe
suggestted.
She said she accepted his resignation
"more in sorrow than in anger," according to
Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency.

"Mrs. Thatcher has been bitten by the man
she treated as a doormat — and she deserves
it," said Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition
Labor Party.
"This is a mortal blow to Mrs. Thatcher's
government," said Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the small, pro-European Liberal Democratic
party.
"The reason is Europe and the split in the
Conservative Party is now irreconcilable,"
Ashdown said in an interview with Channel 4
television news.
Howe was the last Cabinet minister to have
served continuously since Thatcher came to
power in 1979, but he had appeared to be out
of favor since he was replaced as foreign secre
tary last summer.
The resignation was announced two days
after Thatcher sidestepped a challenge from
Kinnock to declare her confidence in Howe.
"The deputy prime minister is too big a man
to need a little man like you to stand up for
him," Thatcher told Kinnock.

However, she said nothing about Howe s
disagreement with her European policy, which
had long been evident.
Tall, rotund and soft-spoken, Howe seemed
an unlikely participant in a controversy. Labor
Party lawmaker Denis Healey once remarked
that arguing with Howe was "like being sav
aged by a dead sheep."
Because of his position on Europe, Howe
had been removed as foreign minister last year
and shunted into the newly created post of
deputy prime minister. He also held the titles
of lord president of the council and leader of
the House of Commons.
His resignation as deputy prime minister
followed yet another row over Europe. Last
weekend, Thatcher found herself standing
alone against 11 other European Community
leaders on setting a timetable for adopting a
single currency.
In a television interview in London, Howe
suggested that Thatcher might eventually
change her mind.
