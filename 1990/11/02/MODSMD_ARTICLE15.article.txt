MOSCOW (AP) - Moldavian
nationalist leaders blasted the
Kremlin's deployment of security
forces in the embattled republic
yesterday and demanded U.N.
peacekeeping troops replace the
Soviet soldiers, news reports said.
The Moldavian Popular Front
asked the republic to "declare
immediate and unconditional
secession from the U.S.S.R. and
press for the withdrawal of all
Soviet troops from the territory of
the republic and suspension of the
activity of KGB bodies," accord
ing to a statement reported by the
official news agency Tass.
The statement said the legisla
ture must also "ask the United
Nations to introduce its troops
into Moldavia for a period deter
mined by the republic leader
ship," Tass reported.
The Front, a leading national
ist group, has been caught in the
middle of a secessionist battle
between the Gagauz minority and
the government of Moldavia, a
republic of 4.3 million bordering
Romania.
The Gagauz minority, a Chris
tian people numbering about
150,000 and living mostly in the
southern corner of the republic,
declared sovereignty last week
and began holding elections for its
own government. They claim Mol
davia has been discriminating
against minorities in the republic
during its own drive for indepen
dence.
Bands of Moldavian national
ists rushed to the area to oppose
the Gagauz, triggering the deploy
ment of two Interior Ministry reg
iments last weekend.
The first violence came

attacked the frontier with Roma
nia, threatening to kill guards and

withdraw, Tass reported.
The militants gave up and no
casualties were reported.
Similar separatists movements
have sprouted nationwide, ham
pering Gorbachev's efforts to
negotiate a union treaty that
would solidify ties among diver
gent peoples and regions.
Gagauz representatives have
been negotiating with a joint Mol
davian-Soviet committee in trying
to resolve the standoff in the
Gagauz districts. Both sides
agreed to pull back their defend
ers, mostly youths armed with
sticks and metal rods.
The Gagauz also have post
poned their elections for an inde
pendent government during the
negotiations.
The Popular Front's statement
also urged the parliament in
neighboring Romania, whose peo
ple share a common language and
culture with Moldavians, to
"immediately consider giving
assistance to Romanians who are
discriminated against by the
U.S.S.R," the independent Post
factum news agency reported.
