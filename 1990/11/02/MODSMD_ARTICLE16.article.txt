Over the past year, 14 of the
15 Soviet republics have
seceded from the Soviet Union.
Although Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev did not rec
ognized the republics' official
separation, he has granted
them an unprecedented degree
of independence.
According to John Harvey
from the Center for Interna-

News
analysis

tional Security
and Arms Con
trol, Gorbachev
is allowing the
republics mea-

sured independence to ease the
transition from a "command-
Communist" to a market econ
omy and to introduce democ
racy into the Soviet Union.
However, the central goven
ment is having difficulty hold
ing the Soviet Union together.
It is trying to develop a new
treaty that will redefine the
role of the republics within the
Soviet Union.
One of the government's
hardest tasks is to set the pro
visions, because all the
republics have "different agen
das," Harvey said.
James Goldgeier, another
Soviet specialist, said the
republics cannot come to a con
sensus on how much power
they are willing to cede to the
central government.
He said although all the
republics want sovereignty in

their internal affairs, it is
unclear whether they are seek
ing total independence in for
eign affairs or are willing to let
the central government coordi
nate such areas as defense and
currencies.
Many are already developing
their own foreign ties and have
established consulates abroad,
Goldgeier added.
The situation in the Soviet
Union is further clouded by the
ethnic rivalries and interre
gional hostilities that have
flared up within the republics
themselves. Some ethnic
groups, like the Gogauz in Mol
davia, have caused disruption
by starting their own move for
independence.
The Kremlin has been using
force to quell such ethnic vio
lence. For example, troops were
sent into Armenia and Azerbai
jan last winter .
Goldgeier said if no new
treaty is established in this
atmosphere of confusion, the
trend toward the crumbling of
the Soviet Union will continue.
However, he said it is uncertain
how many republics are even
willing to agree to a treaty.
Without the support of the
people, the central government
could possibly collapse. Harvey
said the lack of Gorbachev's
stabilizing influences would
mean uncertainty in who has
control over nuclear weapons.
This could pose serious
problems for the United States,
he said.
