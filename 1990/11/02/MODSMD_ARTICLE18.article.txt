# Former HUD chief misled investigators of corruption scandal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional
investigators concluded yesterday that
former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce
misled Congress about his involvement in
abuses at the Deparment of Housing and
Urban Development, including steering
money to political friends.
The report by a House committee left
unanswered whether Pierce broke any
federal laws or committed perjury in his
sole testimony under oath last year, say
ing that a special prosecutor would pur
sue those questions.
But it claimed there was evidence that

Pierce and other officials concealed the
full nature and extent of abuses at the
department, where Pierce was secretary
through the eight years of the Reagan
administration.
"At best, Secretary Pierce was less
than honest and misled the subcommittee
about his involvement in abuses and
favoritism in HUD funding decisions,"
the report said. "At worst, Secretary
Pierce knowingly lied and committed per
jury during his testimony."
Pierce's lawyer Paul Perito dismissed
the report as "the last gasp of a politically

oriented and motivated investigation."
"There is not one piece of evidence
that Mr. Pierce violated his oath by
receiving anything of value or in any way
defrauding the United States govern
ment," Perito said.
The report was released by the House
Government Operations Committee,
whose employment and housing subcom
mittee investigated the scandals at HUD.
Pierce appeared before the panel in
May 1989 and then invoked his sth
Amendment rights against self-incrimi
nation in refusing to appear for further

questioning. Court-appointed Indepen
dent Counsel Arlin Adams is investigat
ing whether Pierce or others at HUD
broke any laws.
Subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos,
D-Calif., said in an accompanying state
ment that Pierce "tried to distance him
self from the abuses and political
favoritism at HUD" when he appeared
before the panel.
He stated that he "never told these
people to fund anything," Lantos said.
"However, sworn testimony from other
witnesses and a paper trail of documents

suggest that he was directly and inti
mately involved in the abuses and
favoritism in HUD funding decisions."
The panel also pointed the finger at
Congress for continuing political influ
ence in federal housing programs.
In its recommendations, the report
said Congress should halt the practice of
earmarking funds for specific housing
projects it favors in appropriations bills.
Last year's supplemental appropriations
bill for HUD allotted $30 million for 40
housing projects.
