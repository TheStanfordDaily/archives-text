# Senate debate over hot issues has few results

The ASSU Senate spent considerable
time last night debating bills about the
alcohol policy and this weekend's leader
ship summit, but it did not make any radi
cal decisions.
Perhaps graduate senator David Brad
fute put it most graphically: "This is parlia
mentary masturbation at its finest."
His comment was in reference to an
unsuccessful bill that purported to "insure
the integrity of the 21st Senate."
The senate debated the Student Affairs
Committee's alcohol policy bill, which made
recommendations to the University on its
alcohol policy. Much of the controversy
focused on one provision of the bill that rec
ommended a ban on the use of dorm funds
to purchase alcohol.
When a motion to eliminate that provi

sion failed, the senate overwhelmingly
approved a compromise bill.
If the University does decide to limit the
use of dorm funds to purchase alcohol, the
bill states it should apply the rule only to
undergraduate dorms and "recognize that
dorms should develop responsible policies
concerning the use of their own funds in
accordance with ... the Fundamental Stan
dard."
Beth Morgan, one of the committee's co
chairs, was pleased with the 13-2-2 vote. "I
think it is a really good sign that people are
in support" of the bill's recommendations.
The senate also came close to rejecting a
bill that would help fund this weekend's
leadership summit, which will be held at
University President Donald Kennedy's
house.
Several graduate senators expressed
opposition to the summit, which
is being led by the Council of
Presidents, and strongly opposed
spending senate money on what
tney felt was an unworthy pro
ject.
"Graduate students are not
terribly interested in seeing the
COP throw a party at Kennedy's
house," said graduate senator
John Overdeck. "The COP
expected to just come in here and
have their agenda rubber
stamped by the senate.
Overdeck also questioned the
legitimacy of the COP itself,
pointing out that "in no election
has the (current) COP received a
mjgority of the votes cast."
But COP member Jay Tucker
vehemently defended the sum
mit, which starts today.

"I'm absolutely disgusted with
senators who voted" against
funding the summit, he said.
The bill itself stated that it
required a two-thirds mÂ£yority to
pass, but when it failed on a 10-7-
1 vote, Senate Chair Solina Kwan
ruled that only a mcyority was
necessary, and the senate voted to
uphold her ruling. The bill thus
passed, allotting $300 of the sen
ate's discretionary fund to the
summit.
According to COP member
Goodwin Liu, 10 senators will
attend the summit and were an
important part of the summit's
planning effort.
The senate also passed a bill
opposing the Athletic Depart
ment's suspension of the Stan
ford Band. One provision of this
bill suggested that if the ban was
not lifted by tomorrow's game
against Washington State, stu
dents should attend the game
wearing black armbands.
