# Bush says Saddam is worse than Hitler
## 
### 
Iraq promised yesterday to release
four more American hostages soon and
insisted it is treating foreign captives
well, while President Bush denounced
the hostage-holding and unleashed his
harshest rhetoric yet against Saddam
Hussein.
"They have committed outrageous
acts of barbarism," Bush said of Sad
dam's forces. "Brutality — I don't
believe that Adolf Hitler ever partici
pated in anything of that nature."
"I don't think the status quo can go
on forever," Bush said while campaign
ing for Republican candidates in
Orlando, Fla. But he added, "I don't
know how long is long enough" to
depend on U.N.-ordered sanctions alone
to force Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
Bush's comments about the Iraqi
president reflects an escalation in
rhetoric to match the United States'
growing military might in the Persian
Gulf region. Bush has said up to
100,000 troops will be dispatched to join
the 220,000-member force already
deployed.
"Today I am more determined than
ever; this aggression will not stand," the
president told an audience earlier yes
terday in Burlington, Mass. "The bru
tality against innocent citizens will not
be tolerated and will not stand."
Bush's remark comparing Saddam's
abuses to Hitler's raised some eyebrows
in the audience. He was asked at his

Florida news conference whether his
comparison might be overdrawn. "I
don't think I'm overstating it,"he
replied.
Bush said there is an "awful similar
ity" between Saddam and Hitler, whose
regime killed millions of Jews and other
civilians during World War 11.
The president said he believed that
"Hitler did not stake people out against
military targets, and he did indeed
respect the legitimacy of the
embassies."
Presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush was trying "to pre
pare the American people for any even
tuality" and added, "If we do have to
take dramatic action, we want them to
know why."
Iraq expressed renewed fears that the
United States will use reports of hostage
maltreatment as a pretext to launch a
military strike. Iraqi Information Minis
ter Latif Jassim, announcing plans to
free four sick and elderly Americans,
denied the captives were being treated
badly. About 1,000 Americans are
believed to be held in Iraq and Kuwait.
"All the Americans at sites have com
plete freedom. They can watch TV, read
books and read newspapers," he told
reporters in Baghdad. "They also enjoy
the friendship of Iraqi forces."
The official Iraqi News Agency iden
tifed the four to be freed as Randall Tri
nah, Abdul Karyi, Raymond Galles and

Michael Barnes. It did not give their
ages or hometowns or say when they
would be freed.
It said the pledge to release them was
in response to a petition from the Arab-
American Reconciliation Society, and
said a delegation from the group would
accompany them to the United States.
Despite Iraqi assurances about the
captives' welfare, letters smuggled from
two American hostages and released by
a U.S. official in Baghdad painted a pic
ture of fear.
One of the unidentified Americans
said he had been moved five times and
was receiving no mail or messages. He
said he had lost 35 pounds.
The other said he considered himself
a prisoner in the "Iraqi gulag" and
pleaded, "Please do not forget the guest
hostages." Iraq calls the detained for
eigners guests.
Thousands of foreigners were
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the inva
sion. Since then, Iraq has selectively
freed hundreds of them.
Western governments have
denounced what they say is Saddam's
use of the hostages to try to split the
multinational alliance opposing him.
The issue is proving divisive.
