## Toward a fairer SAT 
### 
Changes address
some problems
faced by students

AS ALMOST ANY COLLEGE
student can confirm, the
Scholastic Aptitude Test is
inherently flawed. It is virtually
impossible to administer a stan
dardized test across a nation with
such incredible cultural, economic
and racial diversity.
Critics of the SAT claim the
test's format discriminates against
individuals from poorer economic
backgrounds, that the questions
themselves benefit those with
greater cultural exposure and that
coaching programs like Princeton
Review or Stanley Kaplan can
boost the scores of those who can
afford them.
Although economic discrimina
tion may not yet be completely
eliminated, recent changes repre
sent steps in the right direction
toward creating a truly standard
ized SAT.
An increased emphasis on read
ing comprehension means less
emphasis on strict vocabulary
knowledge. Memorization of word
lists, a staple of SAT coaching
courses, demonstrates memory
skills more than verbal ability.
Open-ended math questions will
also diminish reliance upon a stu
dent's "guessing" skills.
And the addition of an essay sec
tion to replace the Test of Standard
Written English makes the SAT a
better measure of English skills.
Success in college and professional
life depends more on writing skills
than on simple word knowledge.
It seems only fitting that the
SAT measures one's ability to
express oneself in writing. Unlike a
college admissions essay, this essay

section would test the student in a
controlled environment, free from
parental, counselor or teacher
assistance.
The University of California sys
tem expressed initial concern
about the essay section, stating it
would discriminate against non
native speakers and recent immi
grants. By scoring the essay sec
tion separately, however, individu
als with less English fluency will
have a fairer chance because the
total SAT score will not be pulled
down.
Still, the SAT has a long way to
go in its quest to eliminate all
facets of its economic bias. One
new change allows the use of calcu
lators on the math sections. This
revision discriminates not only
against students who can't afford
basic calculators, but also against
those who can't afford expensive
programmable calculators.
Furthermore, the math sections
of the test concentrate on basic
arithmetic skills. The questions on
the SAT hardly require calculators
in the first place. Allowing the use
of calculators on the SAT is both
discriminatory and unnecessary.
The College Board should also
undergo greater self-evaluation of
the questions themselves. Vocabu
lary words used in the past, like
"regatta" and "aria," are clearly
biased against the economically
underprivileged. Allegations of eco
nomic, racial and gender discrimi
nation on the SAT should be specif
ically considered and publicly
addressed.
The concept of a college-evalua
tion examination is enough of a
nightmare for American high
school students. Although many of
these recent changes make the
SAT a better barometer of lan
guage and math skills, the College
Board should look into further
changes which would make the
SAT a truly standardized test for
everyone.
