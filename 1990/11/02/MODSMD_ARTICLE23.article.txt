Banning of the Band could set a dangerous precedent

Regarding the recent deci
sion by the Department of
Athletics to ban the half-time show
of the Stanford Band, I can only heartily
applaud.
It has long been my opinion that the
satirical nature of the Band, coupled
with their offensive portrayal of various
political interests, makes them unsuit
able for students' viewing purposes.
At the same time, it is time that we
set down some concrete rules for what
types of performances are to be allowed

at Stanford University.
Apparently, the reason the Band has
been banned is that they dared to show
two sides of the current debate regarding
the controversy of logging in the Pacific
Northwest. It is obvious they were offen
sive due to the amount of "booing" that
occurred at the game.
Since this appears to be our criteria, I
have a few suggestions of other groups
that should be banned from performing
at Stanford until they decide to sterilize
their performance.

The tendency of visiting bands at
Stanford to portray their varying styles
of military fascism has long received a
rather negative greeting here at the
Farm. Isn't it plainly obvious by the
"booing" that the Berkeley band is offen
sive to the Stanford crowds?
Furthermore, judging by recent
games, and also occurrences last year, it
is obvious that many students find the
yell leaders offensive. If we "boo" them,
why don't we ban them?
Both the editorial pages of The

Stanford Daily and The Stanford Review
have been "booed" at many a dormitory
meal, so shouldn't we ban those centers
of political commentary?
If we work long and hard at this, it is
possible that we can sterilize Stanford to
the point that there is nothing offensive
found at Stanford, that there will be
nothing left for us to "boo." At that
point, here at the Farm, all of us docile
little cows will just go "moo."
