# Students should question closing of Tours program
## 
### 
Just because Director of Overseas
Studies Thomas Heller has decided to
close the Stanford Program in Tours
doesn't mean that students have to be
complacent.
Although it seems to be too late to
save Tours for next year, it is not too late
to let Overseas Studies know that they
have made a damaging and apparently
capricious decision.
I am asking that all alumni of Tours,
students going next quarter, students
who would have like to go, students tak
ing French classes or anyone who cares
about the quality of a Stanford under
graduate education write a letter to
Thomas Heller or Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas to request
that the program in Tours be reinstated
as soon as possible.
You might want to ask why Tours was
closed to save $120,000 if operating it
jointly with Carnegie Mellon would have
saved $160,000.
Also, if the decision was made "in the
larger context of decisions about where

Stanford should be sending students to
study," as quoted in the official explana
tion to the center itself, then why didn't
Overseas Studies consider the fact that
Tours is the most popular and most
highly rated of the overseas programs?
Overseas Studies has made a bad deci
sion, and it is our duty to inform them.
