# Band's performance showed timely wit, was not offensive
## 
### 
I am furious at the Department of
Athletics' decision to ban the Stanford
Band because of Saturday's half-time
show. I feel particularly compelled to
vent my anger for a couple of reasons.
The first is that I was actually at the
game, and I wasn't at all shocked or
offended. In fact, my reaction to the
show was relief.
The band used to be admired — even
by its detractors — for its bold and often
witty stabs at timely and relevant issues.
I've been disappointed in the past few
years at tepid shows which shy away
from anything controversial. Saturday's

show was both relevant and fun, but not
at all cruel or offensive.
Secondly, I am an Oregonian, very
sensitive to the issues raised in the show.
I asked my father, a staunch supporter
of the timber industry, whether he was
offended by the show. He was amused
and took the show with the grain of salt
it deserved.
His harshest criticism was that the
band didn't fully realize their audience's
sensitivity to the topic. I think that the
Oregon crowd's childish boos and hisses
should be punishment enough for that
misjudgment.
The decision to ban the band for a
political show amounts to censorship,
clear and simple. In a time when free
speech in our museums, theaters and
libraries is under attack by the Donald
Wildmons and Jesse Helms of this coun
try, I would have hoped that Stanford
would set a better example.
I really wonder about the motives
behind this action. Is it just coincidence
that this non-issue has blown up in the
face of a humiliating defeat on the field?
Isn't it better for Denny Green that
we're talking about a silly half-time show
than a 2-6 record? Just a thought.
