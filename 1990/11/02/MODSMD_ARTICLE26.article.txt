# University could still improve upon shower situations
## 
### 
In response to The Daily's Oct. 18 and
29 photo depicting coed showers in the
Theta Chi house, I have several critical
observations.
I am "delighted" at the creative ways
the Stanford University Housing
Coordinator has found to break down
those sometimes impenetrable walls
which separate the sexes and thus pro
mote improved social intercourse.
I am concerned, however, that what
wasn't considered is the obvious ecologi
cal burden the situation promotes.
Wouldn't it have been even better if
there were only one solitary shower head
instead of four (as shown)?
With a modicum of expense,
University Housing could alter the exist
ing plumbing and thus save a lot of
water and get people together on an even
more intimate basis.
You've got to be kidding! Send an 8 by
10 glossy to dear old Mom!
