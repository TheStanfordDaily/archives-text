## Life proves to be a mystery 
### 
This had never happened to
me before. I was in my room,
switching the radio stations, when I
came across a Madonna song. And I liked
it. Now, I don't just mean in a campy kind
of way. I mean I really liked it.
This wasn't the first time I had heard
"Like a Prayer." But in the past, its effect
had always been grating, irritating and,
to be digestively graphic, borderline nau
seating.
This was different.
I didn't know what to do. At first, I
tried not to admit it to myself. I tried to
cover it up by running around the room,
grabbing my crotch, throwing my chest
forward and exposing my armpit hair.
Although enjoyable in its own right, it
proved to be a faulty remedy for my iden
tity crisis.
I panicked. I figured that I would start
buying Guess Jeans and those LA Gear
shoes with the multi-colored shoelaces.
(Then again, if they're good enough for
Joe. .. .)
I foresaw myself subscribing to Tiger
Beat magazine and replacing my Who
posters with cut-outs of Kirk Cameron
and Doogie Howser. Worst of all, I feared
begging the Bass ticket agent to tell me
when the New Kids were coming to town.
You see, I'm the guy in the dorm with
250 discs, 90 percent of which are of
songs written before I was old enough to
make the all-too-subtle distinction
between a schwa and an umlaut.
I tried to visualize it: Aerosmith, All
man Brothers, Louis Armstrong — Paula
Abdul. It made me shiver. (And which
sleek, pastel color of "Shut Up and Dance,

You Moron" would I get anyway?)
Then I realized my problem. I was not
following the Tao. Nor the Twin Peaks
storyline. I wasn't even following this
whole Diana Conklin thing. I immediately
punished myself by drinking Deer Park
instead of Evian.
I was the victim of an all-too-static
image of myself. Implicitly, I had devel
oped a surprisingly strict concept of who I
was. And it had as much to do with what
people expected of me as what I expected
of myself.
The more I thought about it the more
I realized how much I suffered from this
"Madonna Complex." It occurred every
time my image of myself conflicted with
how I was acting.
Like the time I wanted to go to R-r-r
-raceway Park (you know: Nitro-Burning
Funny Cars, Monster 4x4s, Big Foot. ... I
guess it's an East Coast thing). Or the
time I thought to myself, "Hey, Joel,
you're just not the Sammy Car-Bash kind
of guy."
Or when I wanted to laugh at that
"That's not my belly button/ That's not
my finger" joke. And the morning when I
really wanted to use the free sample of
"Jungle Scent" deodorant.
On each of these occasions, I cheated
myself of a new, exciting experience
because it didn't fit into some abstract
definition of what I considered myself to
be. I had to break out of this mold, or risk
a Karel-like existence.
I'm starting to get better. I'm trying to
be more spur-of-the-moment. More in
touch with where I am. The other day, I
wore boxers. Not just to bed, mind you,

but the whole day, under my shorts, as a
replacement for, not an accoutrement to,
Jockeys — just like Ricky Ricardo.
If I'm at Baskin Robbins, and out of
my 31 choices, I feel like a Bubble Gum
Ice Cream Milkshake, I don't rationalize
myself out of it. And I don't worry about
what other people will think. I just get a
really big straw. That's what separates
me from you.
Now, I'm not saying that I'm an
uncontrollable wild man whose choices of
ice cream and deodorant flavors are
totally unpredictable. You can usually
count on me for Mint Chip and Musk, or
some combination of the two.
But I'm not above breaking into pig
latin every so often (ikestray aay osepay),
or doing that thing where you wear your
sweatshirt inside out. (Is that supposed to
double your possible outfits, or what?)
I'm going to act like I feel and not be
limited by how "Joel Stein" is supposed to
act. If I feel like Vogueing, dammit, I'm
going to Vogue. And no one — no one — is
going to stop me from moving my body to
the music.
It's all blood-sugar.
