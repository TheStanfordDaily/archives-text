# The
						Band vows to march on

### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Despite the controversy and
commotion surrounding the
Band's performance at the Uni
versity of Oregon last weekend,
the Band faces no major penalties
beyond suspension for tomor
row's football game against Wash
ington State.
But the one-game ban — levied
in response to the Band's half
time show parodying Oregon's
spotted-owl debate — appears to
have severely strained relations
between the Band and the Depart
ment of Athletics, which
announced the suspension Tues
day
In an Oct. 31 press release
titled "Charged Unjustly, the
Stanford Band Speaks," the Band
expressed disappointment, suspi
cion and some anger against the
Athletics Department.
The Band called the suspension
"unreasonable, urgust and unde
served" in the three-page state
ment.
But Athletics Department offi
cials stressed that their relation
ship with the Band is positive.
Acting Athletic Director Andy
Cummings said he considered the
Band a neighbor both on campus
and on the playing field.
"I'm confident we're going to
work things out and have a great
Big Game," he said. Big Game will
be held Nov. 17 at UC-Berkeley.
Assoc. Athletic Director Cheryl
Levick said the department will
"work jointly with the Band to
come up with an effective script
for Big Game."
This represents a change from
the past, when the Band has sub
mitted its formations and script to
the Athletic Department for
approval for home games, but not
away games.

Junior Steve Cauffman will be playing the blues on his tenor sax instead of 'All
Right Now' this Saturday because the Athletic Department suspended the
Stanford Band for one game after its controversial routine during last week's
football game at University of Oregon.
