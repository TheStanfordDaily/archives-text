# The 						Band vows to march on
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Despite the controversy and
commotion surrounding the
Band's performance at the Uni
versity of Oregon last weekend,
the Band faces no major penalties
beyond suspension for tomor
row's football game against Wash
ington State.
But the one-game ban — levied
in response to the Band's half
time show parodying Oregon's
spotted-owl debate — appears to
have severely strained relations
between the Band and the Depart
ment of Athletics, which
announced the suspension Tues
day
In an Oct. 31 press release
titled "Charged Unjustly, the
Stanford Band Speaks," the Band
expressed disappointment, suspi
cion and some anger against the
Athletics Department.
The Band called the suspension
"unreasonable, urgust and unde
served" in the three-page state
ment.
But Athletics Department offi
cials stressed that their relation
ship with the Band is positive.
Acting Athletic Director Andy
Cummings said he considered the
Band a neighbor both on campus
and on the playing field.
"I'm confident we're going to
work things out and have a great
Big Game," he said. Big Game will
be held Nov. 17 at UC-Berkeley.
Assoc. Athletic Director Cheryl
Levick said the department will
"work jointly with the Band to
come up with an effective script
for Big Game."
This represents a change from
the past, when the Band has sub
mitted its formations and script to
the Athletic Department for
approval for home games, but not
away games.

Junior Steve Cauffman will be playing the blues on his tenor sax instead of 'All
Right Now' this Saturday because the Athletic Department suspended the
Stanford Band for one game after its controversial routine during last week's
football game at University of Oregon.
'Arbitrary and shortsighted'
In its press release, the Band
apologized three times for being
misunderstood and found offen
sive, but said, "the Athletic
Department's response seems
completely unbalanced: its true
motivations are unclear."
In defense of the show, the
Band argued that the parody rea
sonably spoofed both sides of the
spotted owl debate, that the satire
was in line with previous Athletics
Department-approved shows and
that Oregon fans would have
booed and cursed any half-time
show.
The Band also said its position
"among the most dynamic sup
porters of Stanford athletics" is
evidence that the suspension was
"arbitrary and shortsighted."
However, Levick said the
Band's Oregon show was
markedly different from normal
parodies.
Although the Band has often
performed controversial shows in
the past, the Athletics Depart
ment felt compelled to punish the
Band for the spotted owl perfor
mance because of "our reaction to
watching it," Levick said. "We
were embarrassed by it," she said.
Changing 'spot' to 'pot'
Levick added that her depart
ment received complaints about
the show from "fans, donors and
alumni." She specifically cited as
inappropriate the Band's on-field
formation of the word "POT!"
In the last formation of the
show, the Band spelled the word
"SPOT" and then dropped the "S"

to imply that Oregon's environ
mentalists were really only inter
ested in preserving their mari
juana fields.
In its press release, the Band
argued that since "marijuana
growth in Oregon has been well
documented by the national
media, the Band utterly rejects
the Athletic Department's con
tention that spelling 'POT' was
inappropriate or indecent."
The Oregon Athletic Depart
ment has also complained about

damage to Autzen Stadium. In a
Wednesday interview with The
Daily, Oregon Asst. Athletic Direc
tor Steve Hellyer said paint had
been spilled and the rim of the sta
dium wall had been defaced in the
section where the Band sat.
Hellyer said his department
was "more concerned about
spilling of paint and mischievous
attempts to deface the wall" than
the performance of the Band in
Autzen Stadium.
Cummings said yesterday that
he had not yet received a letter of

complaint from the Oregon Ath
letics Department and that he
would not comment until it
arrived.
Over the last week, both the
Band and the Athletic Depart
ment have been besieged by news
papers, radio and television sta
tions seeking comment about the
show and the suspension.
Band Manager LindaKay
Brown said she gave six press
interviews in one evening early in
the week. Private calls and com
ment have also been heavy.

The Stanford Band may have to take out this 'Banned-o-meter' again when Its one-game suspension
ends. This device made its debut during the 1986 Big Game, the Band's first appearance after It was
suspended when members allegedly urinated on the field during a game.
