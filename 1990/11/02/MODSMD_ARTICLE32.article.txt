The Daily Palo Alto
An ad taken out by The Palo
Alto Committee of Americans
urged voters to pass an anti-alien
land amendment that would pro
hibit Japanese people from own
ing land in California. The ad
stated, "We have every admiration
for the Japanese, their industry
and activity We are second to
none in admitting every other
good trait of that enterprising
race. We have absolutely no racial
hatred. ..."
The ad went on, though. "Cali
fornia is OUR country, not a
Japanese c010ny.... [So] if you
are an American, if you believe
this is a white man's country, if
you believe in a square deal... for
the white race of tomorrow....
Vote Yes."
The amendment passed the
next day.
David Duke was quoted after
reading the ad as saying,
"Remember the good old days,
when you could take out a full
page racist ad in the newspaper
and not have it taken the wrong
way?"
The next year California went
even further and prohibited every
one except white males with a
large red band around their necks
from buying property.
The amendment was repealed,
but Japan struck back half a cen
tury later when it banned the sale
of sushi to any Califomian. The
Great Yuppie Famine of '83 did
not end until red meat came back
into style.

Feinstein said her sex
hurt her chances
among women
because they 'distrust
their own sex and
succumb to emotions
of envy and jealousy.'

Alto men picked were 26 Stanford
students and professors. The
most prominent was "Jack
Kennedy, son of Joseph P
Kennedy, U.S. Ambassador to the
Court of St. James, a student at
the Stanford Business School.
Young Kennedy [was] the author
of a recent best-seller ... 'While
England Sleeps.'"

Rumor has it the other Jack
Kennedy's private memoirs were
entitled "While Jackie Slept" in
which he detailed how he also
drew names from a goldfish bowl
to determine which enemy lines
he'd penetrate that night.
The title of Kennedy's other
well-known book, "PT 109" was
inspired by DR 109, which
required students to take a class
in Plant Cultures. Students
would read works by authors rep
resenting each major phylum.
Oct. 28, 1971
The Stanford Daily
Dianne Feinstein, Class of '55,
was profiled during her race for
the mayoralty of San Francisco.
Running against the incumbent,
Joseph Alioto, she said she had
delayed entering the race
"because of scruples about a
promise made to Alioto, in which
she agreed not to oppose the
mayor in .. . the election."
She changed her mind, though,
when she realized that the elec
tion was "the last opportunity of
the '70s ... to change the destiny
of this city." She said she felt her
gender hurt her chances, espe
cially among women, because they
"still distrust their own sex and
succumb to emotions of envy and
jealousy."
And people wonder why Fein
stein broke her promise to Pete
Wilson to stop campaigning while
he was in D.C.? Obviously, she
changed her mind when she real
ized 1990 would be "the last
opportunity" of the '90s to change
the state's destiny, just as '71 was
the last chance of the '70s, not
counting '75 and '79.
