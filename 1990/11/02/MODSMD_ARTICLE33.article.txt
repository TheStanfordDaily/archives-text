# SHAC, SURE, STOP: Why do Stanford organizations have one-word nicknames?
## 
### Amy Gillett 
Dear Bug,
Why can't a group at Stanford exist
unless the initials of its name spell some
thing (e.g. SCAAN, START, STOP,
SURE, SHAC, SPOON?) Is this a law, a
rule or just some sort of dogma?
— Dale Cooper and Albert Rosenfeld, FBI
Dear Agents Rosenfeld and Cooper,
While there is a pattern to these group
names, there are no strict laws governing
the naming of Stanford organizations.
The ASSU probably would have created
some rule, but then they themselves
would have had to follow it.
If all the abbreviated names of organi
zations had to be real words too, the
ASSU would have to drop the "U" to
become the Associated Students of Stan
ford, or simply ASS. Somehow this just
doesn't sound as elegant as A-S-S-U. Test
it for yourself by comparing the following:
1) Are you running for ASSU Senate?
2) Are you running for ASS Senate?
Who would take part in the latter?
Then again, the ASSU as the ASS would

be much wealthier because everyone
would be too embarrassed to pick up ASS
refunds.
Many student groups, buying into the
Acronym/Name Myth have collapsed
under peer pressure to produce a real
word title.
Last year, the organization "Creative
Readers And Poets" felt the pressure to
produce an acronym for their name.
When they realized that their initials
would produce CRAPJ they briefly consid
ered changing their name to Bards And
Reading Fans. They soon disbanded alto
gether.
The founders of the Stanford Program
on Nutrition though it would be very cute
to call themselves SPOON, instead of
SPON. But where were they going to get
an extra O? They whipped out their Web
ster's and turned to the O Chapter: obese,
orgiastic, oversleep, oviduct, oxyacety
lene, 0z0ne....
No, none of these words quite fit their
image. Then they joyously discovered the
"O Appendage Clause," by which extra
O's that stand for nothing in particular
can be added to acronyms.

Now the organization considered get
ting greedy. Should they abuse the clause
and call themselves SPOONO? Obviously,
they decided against it, and thus today we
know them simply as SPOON.
When naming your organization, you
should not feel compelled to follow other
Stanford examples by making its initials a
word. Most organizations choose catchy
acronyms simply so that people will be
reminded of the services they provide.

The following exchange, not an atypi
cal Saturday night dialogue, that I over
heard last weekend between "Roxanne"
and "Beth" (not their real names), illus
trates this point:
Roxanne: I drank too much of that
Everclear. I can't remember whether I
drove, biked or flew here. Have you seen
my red dress around?
Beth: You're a gross mess! How are
you going to ever get home?
Roxanne: I'm not SURE.
At this point, Beth remembers the
SURE escort service. Within a few min
utes of her call, a little golf cart comes
and, utilizing its special snow plow
attachment, scoops up Beth.
"I've never Seen her like that before,"
comments their mutual friend John. "Did
you say Seas?" asks Beth, not known for
her hearing ability.
Now they engage in conversation
about Students for Environmental At
Stanford and are reminded to drink out of
their environmentally safe mugs.
In their subsequent conversation

about campus silverware, they bring up
SPOON. Then, as John makes an obscene
gesture with his SEAS mug, Beth tells
him that, if he STARTs SCAANing on her,
she'll call the CAPS (She means COPS,
but now she's in such a state of acronym
frenzy, she can't keep anything straight!)
So you see, everyday words as
acronyms for organizations, while not
mandatory, definitely have their advan
tages.

It's midterm time, and, while others are
too busy to deal with you and your stupid
questions, the BUG is still available! Did
your roommate tell you to "shut up " when
you asked him/her if refried beans are
really fried twice ?
Well, I'm not silencing anyone!
(Insulting people — yes! But no silenc
ing.) Send all food-related questions to
b.bug @macbeth, or feed them to my
ravenous BUG box at the Daily. Stay

ting Food and Its Relation to Offensive
