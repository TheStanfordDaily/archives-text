## As good as ever just isn't good enough for Volpe 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
It looks like the twilight of a
career. Talented running back
never regains pre-ii\jury form and
closes out his career on the side
lines.
It may only be forced retire
ment.
Jon Volpe is not through. Not if
he has any say in the matter.
"I still have it. My speed is def

initely where it was, I'm the
strongest I've ever been. Physi
cally I'm there," Volpe said.
He's just not carrying the ball.
Two seasons ago the 6-foot-7
fullback was the talk of Northern
California, the rising star of the
Pacific 10 Conference. The then
sophomore rushed for 1,027
yards, set a school record of 220
yards on 20 carries against Wash
ington, and caught 26 receptions.
He was first-team All Pac-10, the

future of the Cardinal ground
game.
Last year he made only two
games after separating first one,
then the other shoulder, and tear
ing up his left knee.
Now?
This season the explosive
player sits on the bench, blocks for
other runners, and gets his agres
sions out on special-teams play.
He opened the season as third
string, but has since advanced to

backup fullback. He's chalked up
36 carries in eight games for a
grand total of 125 yards.
Not exactly what Volpe had in
mind for his senior season.
"It's not what I anticipated.
During spring ball I felt the best
that I ever had and said 'this is
going to be my year again this
year,'" Volpe said. "I felt like I'd be
All-Pac-10 and thought I'd be car
rying the ball a good portion of the
time.
"I guess the coaches had differ
ent game plans, and I guess I
didn't fit in as much as I thought
I might before the season
started."
The situation is all the more
suprising to Volpe considering he
was the number one fullback all
the way through spring practice,
recovery and all.
Practice began with Volpe,
Miami transfer Ellery Roberts
and Tommy Vardell sharing equal
time. After one week, Volpe was
elevated to first string, and his
carries relected his position. A
week later, coach Denny Green
took him aside after a scrimmage
and told him how well he was
doing and explained how the team
was planning on utilizing the
short but powerful back in differ
ent situations.
Green and staff also suggested
that the still-recovering Volpe cut
down his repetitions so as not to
reinjure his knee, considering his
position was all but solidified.
Roberts and Vardell's scrim
mage time increased, but Volpe
remained at the top of the depth
chart.
Until the day before the Cardi
nal and White game.
Roberts had been elevated to
starter. Volpe was listed as second
string.
"During spring Jon was play
ing very well but Ellery was play

ing the best of the group," said
running backs coach Tyrone Will
ingham.
That's not what Volpe had been
told.
"I was completely shocked,
especially the way it happened. I
was still number one the whole
way through, and they purposely
limited my playing time," Volpe
said. "They didn't even tell me.
They just did it all of a sudden."
The shock continued into this
season. In fact, when training
camp opened in August, Volpe was
listed as third string. He had had
another knee surgery four weeks
before the start of camp, but he
ranked among the top three in
conditioning tests the first day of
training.
But he didn't move up. His rep
etitions were limited. At Colorado
he watched Roberts and Vardell
struggle against the Buffaloes'
massive line from the sidelines.
What happened to the poten
tial? The ability? The accolades?
"Coach Willingham plain out
told me that there are two guys
ahead of me who are playing
ahead of me," Volpe said. "Obvi
ously they were playing ahead of
me because they were playing and
I wasn't. They were getting all the
reps."
"During preseason there is not
a great deal of time to make
changes [in the lineup]" Willing
ham said. "We had a really short
camp before the first game."
But even after the first game,
and the second game, and even
the third game, Volpe continued to
be outside of the Cardinal's plans.
Roberts was demoted. Vardell
became the starter. Volpe
remained a special teams threat.
Why?
"There's no doubt that all of
our running backs are talented.
Everyone could start for a lot of

teams in the Pac-10. That's hard,"
Volpe said. "Tommy does certain
things he's good at — short
yardage. Ellery has his qualities,
and I have mine, too — the quick
traps and draw plays."
"It's all how you look at things
— you don't see a true starter. You
see Tommy in one series and Jon
in the next series," Willingham
explained. "We rotate. On paper
there's one starter for a ball game,
and that's Tommy, but in actual
ity all are like starters because
they're all good players."
Stanford may use a rotational
system, but Volpe contines to
touch the ball infrequently.
Whereas he averaged 20 caries a
game two seasons ago, the fifth
year player has maintained only


Al Green — Dally file
Senior Jon Volpe, a 1,000-yard rusher In 1988, has not had the same kind of success this year. He
feels he has fully recovered from the injuries that plagued him last year, but his playing time has
been greatly reduced and he has been contributing more with his blocking than with his running.
four runs per contest this season.
His high has been nine, last week
against Oregon.
One of the problems has been
Stanford's lack of a ground game.
The possessor of a fabulously tal
ented collection of running backs,
the Cardinal has failed to get its
running attack going. Added to
the fact that it has often fallen
behind early, Stanford has been
relying on the pass to keep the
squad compeitive.
If you don't run the ball, no one
gets carries.

"Unfortunately our offense has
not had the productivity that we'd
like to have so his numbers as far
as rushing the football have not
been there, but he's doing a good
job," Green said. "When he is get
ting the ball he's running hard
and he's been blocking. If we
could ever hold up defensively and
keep the games in that position
the first half I think the second
half, we could start running the
ball pretty well."
But despite the situation, Volpe
continues to keep his head up, and
tries to make the best of the
opportunies he's given. If he's
only given two or three runs,
they're going to be the same qual

ity as if they were one of 15 or 20.
He's going to surprise the linemen
when he's blocking, he's going to
give his all to special teams play.
Limited playing time does not
equal decreased quality. Or desire.
"I haven't let the depth chart
affect my play," Volpe said. "It's
discouraging, but the times when
I do get in I run the ball well and
block well. I've kept pounding
away all season."
But that doesn't mean it's easy
"It's hard. It's like a time bomb
ready to explode, but someone put
a lid on you, and you can't do any
thing about it," Volpe explained.
"The coaches are going to play
who they think is best, and you

have to sit and wait.
"Mentally it's hard. You have
the coaches doubting you and
some concern in your own mind.
But I can't believe it. Just given
the opportunity I know I can do
the things I did my sophomore
season."
"There's no doubt that its diffi
cult for Jon. He's a man, and he
knows that football's a tough
game," Green said. "It's been dis
appointing because he hasn't had
the kind of carries that he'd like to
have. But Jon is handling it well,
and he's continued to work hard.
There's nothing easy about
sports. Football's a really tough
game, its a gut check every single

day. You just have to go out and
play and try to put the best 11
players on the field."
Despite his lack of carries and
his lack of exposure, Volpe is still
aiming for the NFL. Even if his
current coaches don't utilize him,
Volpe knows he has what it takes.
If he doesn't get drafted, which is
likely since he hasn't had any
thing for scouts to see in two
years, the industrial engineering
is planning on trying out as
a free agent with a team that
needs a runner.
Neither his size, nor his mea
ger statistics dampen his outlook.
"Anybody who's proven himself
in the past, who can run in the

4.4'5, and who has strengh will
likely get a shot in the NFL,"
Volpe said. Steve Broussard
(another compact fullback) and I
were All Pac-10 together, and he's
starting for Atlanta, while I'm
third team for Stanford."
"I think there's a strong possi
bility Jon can make the pros,"
Willingham said. " He plays a lot
bigger than his size. He doesn't
play like he's 5-8. His quickness
and strength really are big. When
you factor in his mental tough
ness, his attitude and his abilty to
play to win, he has the qualities it
takes."
Stanford just doesn't think so
this season.
