# Today is like Christmas for the nation's NBA junkies
## 
### 
Tonight, amid great excitement and
anticipation (at least to this sports
writer) the National Basketball
Association kicks off its regular season in
arenas all around the country. The NBA
seems to have the shortest off-season of
the megor sports, what with the playoffs
stretching halfway into June, then the
college draft, and pretty soon the exhibi
tion season is upon us.
The NBA has been an incredible suc
cess story of late: the league has added
four expansion teams in the past two
years, and attendance is booming. It also
has billion-dollar contracts from NBC
and TNT (Turner Network).
This should be an exciting year for the
fans, as there is a phenomenal amount of
talent in the league these days, and,
despite the Detroit Pistons' winning the
title the last two years, the championship
race seems fairly open. Many teams have
improved themselves significantly
through the draft and through trades.
Here are some guesses at the division
winners for the 1990-1991 season.

Atlantic Division: Boston Celtics.
Yeah, yeah, big groans all around. But the
geriatric front line still seems to be opera
ble. Also, they have guard Brian Shaw
back, picked up point guard Dee Brown in
the draft, and Larry Bird has already reg
istered three triple-doubles in the presea
son. Bird can still play.
Central Division: Chicago Bulls.
Michael Jordan.
Midwest Division: Utah Jazz. Add
JefT Malone to a pretty good team that
already has Karl Malone and John Stock
ton, and you're going to win some games.
The Jazz won't go anywhere in the play
offs, though. San Antonio is still a few
maturity points away from taking the
title. Rod Strickland is sorry.
Pacific Division: Portland Trail
Blazers. This pick is entirely objec
tive, admittedly. But the returning West
ern Conference champions added Danny
Ainge and have as good of a shot as any
one at winning this, the toughest of NBA
divisions. The Phoenix Suns could take it
very foreseeably, but they didn't help

themselves at all during the off-season.
The Lakers, who had the best record in
the whole league last year, cannot be
counted out as long as they have Magic
Johnson. But as Chinua Achebe once
wrote, things fall apart.
The Lakers should meet the Blazers in
the Western Conference finals, with Port
land winning to set up a showdown with
Barkley and the 76ers, who will have
defeated the Pistons to win the East. The
Blazers take the seventh game, after a
huge fight that leads to the ejection of
Danny Ainge and Rick Mahorn.
Jordan gets his title in 1992, teaming
in the backcourt with Yugoslavia's 6-foot
-10, 190-pound point guarid Tony Kukoc.
Scoring title: Jordan, who wins his
fifth in a row. No one is really close. He
also gets 85 against Denver and performs
one dunk while stepping on the heads of
Michael Adams and Chris Jackson.
Rebounding Champ: Akeem
won. The Dream won the rebound title by
almost two per game last year. Roy Tarp-

ley of Dallas could challenge if he ever
played close to a full season.
Assists: Kevin Johnson. KJ takes the
passing title from John Stockton, who
gets confused over which Malone to pass
to.
Steals: Gary Payton, rookie at Seattle.
Payton had six steals against Michael Jor
dan in preseason, while holding him to 17
points and gaining the respect of his
jumphighness. Payton also takes Rookie
of the Year.
All-Rookie Team: Payton, Derrick
Coleman, Bo Kimble, Danny Ferry and
Lionel Simmons. Not Chris Jackson.

Blocked Shots: Patrick Ewing. It
helps to have a nine-foot wing span.
Field Goal Percentage: Barkley.
Barkley once again leads the legue in
dunks and coast-to-coast buckets.
Free Throws: Who cares. Probably
Bird.
Three-Pointers: Dale Ellis, who hit
47 percent in 1988-89. He could take it
again, unless it's Steve Kerrrrrr.
Biggest Gunner: Dominique Wilkins.
Wilkins can sky with the best of them,
and he does provide tons of highlight reel,
but he never shoots much better than 45
percent.
Slam dunk champion at the All-
Star game: Wilkins, with one of those
"bring it from between the legs, double
pump, reverse, take this back to yo'
momma" dunks.
