# Soccer makes NCAA debut in unfriendly Santa Barbara
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford has finally reached
the women's soccer spotlight, but
frankly the No. 7 Cardinal would
rather be playing in the daylight.
Stanford visits the No. 4 UC-
Santa Barbara Gauchos tomorrow
at 7:30 p.m. in the first round of
the NCAA tournament, and will
have to contend with unusual
field conditions, as well as a play
off-experienced Santa Barbara
team. It is Stanford's first visit
ever to the NCAA tournament.
The Gauchos (14-1-1) are one
of only two teams to beat Stanford
(15-2-1) this year, and they will
have a decided home field advan
tage. The game will be played in
Santa Barbara's football stadium
under less than blinding lights,
and red lines will be chalked onto
the field for the soccer game.
Aggressive, Duke-emulating fans
complete the home field edge for
the Gauchos.
Stanford coach Berhane Ande
berhan, whose team has not
played any games at night this
season, tried to re-schedule the
game for an afternoon start, but
was unsuccessful. Stanford leaves
for Santa Barbara today and is
scheduled for a short practice in
the stadium tonight.
"I don't appreciate their little
games," said Andeberhan. "But
we'll play at midnight in the
Sahara if we have to."
On Sept. 15, the Gauchos beat
Stanford 1-0 in Santa Barbara
and is the only team all year to
shut out the Cardinal, so the
offense will have a score to settle
with the Gauchos. In the second
half of that game, freshman for

ward Phronsie Franco scored on a
four-yarder following a corner
kick.
Stanford was missing senior
midfielder Denise Denney, who
sat out with an injury and was on
the final leg of its longest road trip
of the year. Denney will be back,
as will fiery freshman midfielder
Jen Gardiner, who played her first
game of the year Saturday after
missing 17 because of a knee
injury.
"There is nothing new in the
game plan; we are just a little
healthier," said Andeberhan.
"We're playing well right now, and
we are just going to keep doing
what we are doing."
If Stanford, the third seed in
the West, can beat second-seeded
Santa Barbara, they will visit top
seeded Santa Clara next Saturday
The Broncos, the only other team
to beat Stanford in 1990, have a
first-round bye, and the Cardinal
would love another shot at its
local rivals.
Santa Barbara lost last year in
the NCAA quarterfinals to Santa
Clara, 2-0, and dropped its only
game of 1990 to the Broncos as
well, losing 1-0 in overtime at
home.
"Our team feels we can beat
them, and indeed, we should have
beat them" Andeberhan said.
"This is not because they are weak
teams, but if we can put our act
together we can do it. We didn't
finish the job."
The Gauchos have a scoring
triumvirate on the attacking end.
Franco leads the team with 16
goals, while juniors Laurie Hill
(16 goals, 13 assists) and Trisha
Kimble (10 goals, seven assists)
are playoff-experienced leaders.

Junior goalie Jan Urich has
allowed only seven goals all season
and has recorded seven shutouts,
including a blanking of Stanford.
"We can score on Santa
Barbara. I think we can score on
anyone," said Andeberhan. "This
crazy group is not intimidated by
anyone."
Stanford, which sustained
injuries across the lineup in a cru
cial trip to North Carolina, has
had another five days to heal.
Seniors Jennifer Rowland (knee)
and Jen Bloomer (knee) played in
a 5-0 thrashing of the University
of San Francisco Saturday, but
might not be back in peak condi
tion. Junior fullback Michele Sul
livan continues to rehabilitate her
back and is expected to start.
Andeberhan said Stanford
would not do anything radical in
its approach for Santa Barbara.
"We have a very young team, and
we can't make so many changes.
We have to do our own stuff, and
believe it will work."
