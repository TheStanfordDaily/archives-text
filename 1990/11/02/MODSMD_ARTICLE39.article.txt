# Volleyball takes momentum north
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
There are several problems
with playing one of the most difi
cult schedules in the nation. The
Stanford women's volleyball team
encountered one of them when
they had to travel to Stockton to
face fourth-ranked University of
the Pacific Tuesday, a match the
Cardinal pulled out in five games.
They will encounter a related,
but quite different problem this
week when they meet Washington

and Washington State — getting
up for the also-rans after playing
the nation's best.
Stanford meets the Huskies
tonight in Seattle at 7:30 p.m. The
team faces the Cougars tomorrow
night at. the same time in Pull
man.
While Stanford is now ranked
fifth nationally with a 17-3 record,
neither of the team's opponents
this week has been ranked all
year. Stanford is second in the
Pacific 10 Conference with an 11-
2 mark while Washington and

WSU have won only seven Pac-10
matches between them. Still, the
matches must be played.
"(Our goals are) to keep playing
well — go up there and hammer
those two teams," coach Don
Shaw said. "We still need to stay
focused on what we're doing and
keep improving."
With a lot of talent on the ros
ter, focus has been the biggest
problem for the Cardinal this sea
son. Stanford was flat in early
season losses to No. 1 UCLA and
UOP and came out the same way
in the rematch with the Tigers
Tuesday. But after losing the first
two games, the team improved its
level of play, fighting back to take
the match.
"Our only problem is mental, if
anything," said junior middle
blocker Amy Cooper. "In the UOP
match it was a lack of desire or a
lack of focus the first two games.
Then we got it together, and we
were unstoppable."
This weekend's obviously out
matched opponents — Stanford
easily swept both squads at Burn
ham last month — will provide
the Cardinal two more chances to
improve their mental consistency.
But Shaw isn't really worried
about that problem too much.
"I think we've been playing
very well," he said. "People always
try to talk about the bad things
and forget about the good things.
But we've been doing a lot of
things right. We should be happy
with that. Of course, we want to
keep improving."
Indeed, despite coming out flat
against the Tigers, losing the first
two games and letting the 2,700
Pacific fans get involved in the
match, the team produced a lot to
be happy about. None of the final
three games was that close as the
Cardinal played probably its best
defensive match of the year.
"We didn't play all that well the
first two games but then we came
back and played well," Jessica
Benton said. "That's something
Stanford teams haven't always
done before."
The ability to struggle and still
beat the nation's best clearly
bodes well for the future. If the
team improves through home
matches against No. 6 Texas, No.

21 Oregon State and No. 9 San
Jose State, it will be in good posi
tion to bid for its first-ever NCAA
title in December. And improve
the team has.
The biggest improvement of
late has come from Benton. She
has stepped up as an potent
attacker in the past week, hitting
.380 and reaching a career-high in
kills in all three matches. She has
nicely complemented the Cardi
nal's two big guns — Bev Oden

and Kristin Klein — who have
more than 55 percent of the
team's kills.
"She's just improving," Shaw
said of his senior co-captain.
"Every day she gets better. She
didn't play much until last year...
. She's becoming more confident
and that's really helping us."
"Most of the blockers are basi
cally going with our big guns,"
Benton said. "You have to put two
blockers on Kris and 8ev.... The
second round (of Pac-10 play)
we're really going to have to
spread it around. That means
Amy, Jess, Jack (Jennifer Jack
son) and Danny (Danielle Everett)
are going to get set more. When
we do get set we generally have
one blocker up."
A rule of volleyball is that one
hitter should beat one blocker
most of the time, and Cooper and
Benton, especially, have certainly
done that. And as the offense
improves and diversifies, the Car
dinal starts beating teams ranked
ahead of it.
"The main thing is for us to
play well," Cooper said, "because
no one can beat us when we play
well consistently."


Al Green — Daity file
After redshirting last year as a walk-on fr«thman, Kathy Jurgens
has made a big contribution to the fifth-rinked team this season.
