# Political groups eagerly await results of gubernatorial race

### Peter Robison 
Stanford's Democratic and Republican
political organizations are both gearing
up their final election drives before Tues
day's California gubernatorial election.
The race, between Democrat Dianne
Feinstein, former mayor of San Francis
co, and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson (R-
Calif.) is considered one of the most
important in the nation.
If Feinstein wins, she will be Califor
nia's first female governor. If Wilson
wins, he can prevent the Democrats from

holding both the
governorship and
the legislature.
A poll conduct
ed by the San
Jose Mercury
News Thursday

listed Wilson with an eight-point percent
age lead over Feinstein. However, a Los
Angeles Times poll on Thursday gave Wil
son only a one-point lead.
The Stanford Democrats and the Stan
ford College Republicans have both been
active in promoting their respective can-

didates in what
could be a tight
race.
According to
junior Kevin
Hartz, co-chair of
the Stanford Dem-

ocrats, his group has been concentrating
on "voter education," which has meant
"distributing flyers that discuss Feinstein's
position on the issues."
The Stanford Democrats are also plan
ning to hold a rally Monday in White Plaza,
along with the Pro-Choice Alliance and

Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford. On Sunday, the group will dis
tribute slate cards outlining the Demo
cratic platform to all of the dormitories.
Members of the College Republicans
have also been distributing flyers, accord
ing to President John Abbott, a junior.
Members have been walking precincts
and working with the local Republican
headquarters in an effort to build voter
awareness. "We are planning a major
effort on election day," Abbott said.
"By Tuesday, 85 different Republicans
will have spent at least a full day working

on the campaign," according to senior
Keith Rabois, a writer for the Stanford
Review and former president of the Col
lege Republicans.
Both the Stanford Democrats and the
College Republicans agree that it will be a
close race, decided mainly by absentee
ballots and the 20 percent of voters who
are currently undecided.
Still, the College Republicans are con
fident of victory. "I'm 100 percent sure
that Wilson will win," Abbott said.
