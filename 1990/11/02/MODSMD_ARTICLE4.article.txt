# Political groups eagerly await results of gubernatorial race
## 
### Peter Robison 
Stanford's Democratic and Republican
political organizations are both gearing
up their final election drives before Tues
day's California gubernatorial election.
The race, between Democrat Dianne
Feinstein, former mayor of San Francis
co, and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson (R-
Calif.) is considered one of the most
important in the nation.
If Feinstein wins, she will be Califor
nia's first female governor. If Wilson
wins, he can prevent the Democrats from

holding both the
governorship and
the legislature.
A poll conduct
ed by the San
Jose Mercury
News Thursday

listed Wilson with an eight-point percent
age lead over Feinstein. However, a Los
Angeles Times poll on Thursday gave Wil
son only a one-point lead.
The Stanford Democrats and the Stan
ford College Republicans have both been
active in promoting their respective can-

didates in what
could be a tight
race.
According to
junior Kevin
Hartz, co-chair of
the Stanford Dem-

ocrats, his group has been concentrating
on "voter education," which has meant
"distributing flyers that discuss Feinstein's
position on the issues."
The Stanford Democrats are also plan
ning to hold a rally Monday in White Plaza,
along with the Pro-Choice Alliance and

Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford. On Sunday, the group will dis
tribute slate cards outlining the Demo
cratic platform to all of the dormitories.
Members of the College Republicans
have also been distributing flyers, accord
ing to President John Abbott, a junior.
Members have been walking precincts
and working with the local Republican
headquarters in an effort to build voter
awareness. "We are planning a major
effort on election day," Abbott said.
"By Tuesday, 85 different Republicans
will have spent at least a full day working

on the campaign," according to senior
Keith Rabois, a writer for the Stanford
Review and former president of the Col
lege Republicans.
Both the Stanford Democrats and the
College Republicans agree that it will be a
close race, decided mainly by absentee
ballots and the 20 percent of voters who
are currently undecided.
Still, the College Republicans are con
fident of victory. "I'm 100 percent sure
that Wilson will win," Abbott said.

Rabois predicted that Wilson
will win by about a four-point
margin, noting that Wilson holds
an 8 to 1 advantage in the absen
tee ballots that have been
returned.
The Democrats agreed that
Wilson's advantage in absentee
ballots will be difficult to over
come, but claimed Feinstein has
the edge in winning the undecided
votes.
"Most of the undecided voters
are women, and most women sup

port Feinstein because of her opin
ion on choice," said junior Scott
Christofferson, co-chair of the
Stanford Democrats. "Feinstein
should do very well with Republi
can women, too," he said.
Feinstein's campaign strategy
has "targeted women and minori
ties," Hartz said. In the last week,
she has campaigned in black
churches and largely Hispanic
East Los Angeles, in the hope that
the minority vote will be pivotal.
According to Abbott, Wilson
will win because of his strong posi
tions on fiscal issues and crime.
Abbott cited Wilson's record as
mayor of San Diego, where he
"balanced 11 consecutive budgets,

reduced property tax rates by 25
percent and total taxes by 10 per
cent."
Abbott said Feinstein "left San
Francisco with a $172 million
deficit and six consecutive unbal
anced budgets."
According to Rabois, "It's quite
clear that Wilson was a better
mayor of San Diego than Fein
stein was of San Francisco."
Rabois said Wilson's position
on taxes will appeal to voters.
According to Hartz, Feinstein
"will not raise taxes for the poor
and middle classes. If she raises
taxes, it will be for people in the
$200,000 income range."
