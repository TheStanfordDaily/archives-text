# Polo gets a break
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
After playing five games in
three days last weekend, the
Stanford water polo team will
finally get a chance to rest and
have some fun this weekend.
The Cardinal does have two
games to play — one at 3 p.m.
today against UC-Davis and
one Saturday at 11 a.m.
against an alumni team — but
after the schedule the team has
been playing, this has to be a
pleasant sight for some sore
Stanford eyes.
And the team better enjoy it
while it can.
After this weekend, the
schedule gets harder, harder
and even harder. Next week,
the team will have to travel
down south to take on No. 4
UCLA and No. 6 USC on back
to-back days, and then, after a
home game against Pacific, the
Cardinal will travel to Berkeley
for the much anticipated Big
Splash Nov. 17.
After going through all that,
Stanford will finally get to go to
the one place the team will be
happy to travel to — the NCAA
Championships in Long Beach.
But first things first. This
weekend's schedule couldn't
have come at a better time for
the team. As coach Dante Det
tamanti said, "This is a great
time for these two games We've
been playing so many tough
games in the last couple of
weeks that we really need a lit
tle break in the action."
And that is exactly what the
team is going to get. Detta
manti compared today's oppo
nent — Davis — to the Santa
Clara team that the Cardinal
defeated 20-3 earlier this year,
so needless to say, it should not
be much of a contest.
"We'll get a chance to play
everybody in the game," Detta
manti said, "And that will
really help us in the future."
On Saturday, the current
Stanford team will face a much
tougher — and older — oppo
nent in the alumni team.
Although none of the Cardinal
graduates who are currently on
the U.S. National Team will be
playing in the game, four for
mer olympians will be jumping

the schedule gets
harder, harder and
even harder.

back into deGuerre Pool.
Chris Dorst, an All-Ameri
can in 1975 and 1976 and a
member of the 1984 Olympic
Team, will be in goal for the
alumni and will try to stop this
year's high-scoring Cardinal
attack. Helping him out will be
three members of the silver
medal winning 1988 U.S.
Olympic Team — Jody Camp
bell, Alan Mouchawar and
James Bergeson. All three of
these players were four-time
All Americans and were mem
bers of the 1981 Cardinal team
that went 31-0 and won the
national championship. In fact,
Campbell, who was on the
1980, 1984, and 1988 Olympic
Teams, and Mouchawar won
three national titles in their
illustrious four years at Stan
ford.
With all of this talent assem
bled on one team, it is not sur
prising that in Dettamanti's 13
years at Stanford, his teams
have yet to win the annual
alumni game. "Experience just
makes all the difference in the
world," Dettamanti said.
And besides, who wins
doesn't really make a differ
ence. As Dettamanti said,
"This should be a fun game,
and we're treating it that way. I
just want the guys to play good
water polo."
The Cardinal has been play
ing quite well indeed, as its 21-
4 record shows, and deserves
this restful weekend. Speaking
for the entire team, senior
Chuck Maguy said, "We've
been working really hard lately,
and now we'll get a chance to
play and have some fun with
out worrying about anything."
On the individual level,
senior Rick McNair was
recently nominated for the
prestigious NCAA "Top Six"
Award, given to exemplary
scholar-athletes.
