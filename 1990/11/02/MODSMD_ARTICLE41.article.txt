# Big thrower Farley can use his feet as well
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
At long last, Idaho is now known on the
Stanford campus for not one but two things
— the best darn potatoes in this great
nation of ours and, after a brilliant junior
season, Brandon Farley.
The Boise native has been one of the
most improved Stanford athletes this year,
leading the team in assists and spearhead
ing the Cardinal resurgence in a sport that
in prior years has shown little but medi
ocrity.
"He's one of the most improved players
on the team this year, no doubt about it,"
asst. coach Greg Petersen said. "It's diffi
cult for us to have him out of the lineup,
especially with that throw-in of his."
Although he has excelled all season in
nearly every facet of the game, Farley has
gained fame for his ability to huck the ball
a mile. He has had four assists this season
on throw-ins alone, and every toss brings
forth a round of oohs, ahs and comments
from the crowd.
"One time, I threw a ball in, and some
guy shouted, 'Hey, that kid's on steroids!!'"
Farley said. "You can hear a lot of stuff
from the sidelines that you can't from the
field."
At the beginning of the year, it appeared
as though Farley would be spending most of
the season on the sidelines. He was not
slated to start for the 1990 squad until
injuries opened a hole for the junior full
back to fill.
"We didn't have him in a starting slot
early in the year," coach Colin Lindores
said. "But someone got hurt, and Brandon
took advantage of the situation."
Lindores hesitated to discuss Farley's
most obvious soccer talent. "Everyone
looks at Brandon and says, 'That's the guy
with a long throw,'" he said. "His ability to
throw the ball in overshadows his abilities
as a good soccer player.
"He realizes his limitations," Lindores
went on. "He's very good at playing within
them, and not everyone has that ability."
His limitations must be fading from sight
quickly, because nearly everyone used the
words "most improved" in describing the
play of Farley. He attributes this change in
large part to Lindores' coaching.
"I've learned a lot this year, and I've
become more of a student of the game
through Colin," Farley said. "He's taught
me a lot of stuff tactically that I didn't
know before.
"He's instilled confidence in me that I
didn't have last year," Farley continued. "I
feel much more comfortable on the field."
Farley's on-field comfort has translated
into an elevated level of play. "We've really
hit it off with him," Lindores said. "We're

on the same wavelength to the point where
we get along extremely well, and it's
reflected in his play all year."
Farley has scored the first goal of his
Stanford career and added seven assists in a
year in which he feels has seen him play his
"best soccer ever."
Which is saying a lot. Farley led his high
school team to the state championship in
each of his freshman, sophomore, and
junior years, and took the team to the state
finals his senior season before their dynasty
sputtered.
"In Idaho, we havq a lot of raw talent but
not much coaching," Farley said. In high
school, the goalkeeping was so bad, that on
throw-ins I would just try to throw the ball
into the net."
Farley almost accomplished the feat as a
Cardinal in a game against U.S. Interna
tional University earlier in the season. One
of his throw-ins apparently went off the
USIU keeper's hands and into the net, but
was disallowed by the officials, preventing
Stanford from tacking on another goal to
what became a 8-0 victory.
"Colin and I have been working on my
throwing the ball directly to someone on
the team," Farley said. "That time, though,
1 just decided to try and throw it in."
Farley believes that lopsided victories
like the USIU slaughter will occur much
more frequently in future years. "I wish I
could be playing here for four more years,"
he said. "We're really starting to emerge as
a powerhouse in the West."
California will try to get in the way of 8-
6-6 Stanford's ascent to national promi
nence this weekend when the two teams
square off at Cal's Memorial Stadium this
Sunday at 1 p.m. Lindores is none too
pleased with the gremlins in the scheduling
department who came up with that particu
lar time and date for the contest.
"Let's see, on a Sunday at one, in a sta
dium that seats 55,000 .. . there should be
50 there, at least," Lindores said, and then
added, "Hey, I'd rather be watching the
49ers."
Win or lose, Farley feels that the season
has been a good one for the Cardinal boot
ers. "This has been a great season for Stan
ford soccer," Farley said. Our expectations
for the playoffs were not met, but we got a
winning season and can only improve next
year." Stanford will lose only one starter,
Tim Keyes, to graduation this June.
"I think we were a much more mentally
prepared team this year," Farley continued.
"I feel sorry for the teams that we'll play
next year if we continue to improve."
It's a sense of compassion for opponents
like Farley's that makes Petersen remark,
"Brandon would make any mother proud."
