The cliche goes that the
criminal always returns to
the scene of the crime. The
Cardinal men's tennis team
must be guilty of perpetrat
ing hackneyed activities.
Stanford's top netters
have returned to Athens,
Ga., where the Cardinal has
won eight NCAA titles
through the years. This
time, however, they are
competing in the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate Champi
onships, the first leg of the
Collegiate Grand Slam.
Once again, they are win
ning. Three of Stanford's
four representatives in the
singles draw advanced yes
terday, as well as both dou
bles teams.
The Cardinal's lone loss
was dealt to freshman Chris
Cocotos. Eighth-seeded
Dave Dilucia, Notre Dame's
No. 1 player, took him out in
three sets, 6-1, 0-6, 6-3.
Stanford's only other
unseeded entrant fared
much better. Sophomore
Jared Palmer defeated Mark
Jeffrey of Mississippi State,
6-4, 6-1.
Senior Alex O'Brien also
handled his opponent with
out too much trouble, down
ing Georgia's Patricio
Arnold 6-4, 6-2, on Arnold's
home court.
The tournament's No. 1
seed, top-ranked Cardinal
sophomore Jonathan Stark,
faltered in the second set of
his match against North
Carolina's Bryan Jones, but
he rebounded in the third to
preserve the victory, 6-3, 3-
6, 6-2.
Stark teamed with
Palmer in doubles play to
beat Joey Deer and Brian
Nelson of Wisconsin, 6-3, 6-
4. O'Brien and Jason Yee
hammered a Kansas duo 6-
4, 6-1.
