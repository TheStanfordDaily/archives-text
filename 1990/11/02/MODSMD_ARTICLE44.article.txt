# John Elway follows in father's footsteps as Guest Greek
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
Like father, like son. Or some
thing like that.
Taking right up where his dad
left off, former Stanford great
John Elway is trying to prognosti
cate the Guest Greek into glory
this week.
And it shouldn't be too hard,
actually, considering The Daily's
own are severly floundering.
Guess football spreads are not in
this gangs' future.
Elway, one of the all-time
greatest quarterbacks to come out
of the former quarterback breed
ing grounds known as the Farm,
probably has a leg up, not to men
tion a great arm, on the poor
sports flunkies. The 1979-82 sig
nal caller is only the possessor of
almost every quarterback record
in the Stanford annals. Most
yards gained in a season, most
yards gained in a career, most
touchdown passes, most comple
tions, most attempts, most total
yards . . . the list goes on. Not to
be forgotten, however, is Only
Quarterback to have his Big Game
Victory taken away by The Band.
Speaking about bands, wonder
what Elway would think of this
weekend's suspension? He'd prob

ably increase the spread for Stan
ford.
But back to the blood lines.
John Elway is folowing in his
dad's footsteps in more ways than
being former Cardinals. Little
Elway is also picking his alma
mater to come up with its second
Pac-10 victory of the year. Elway
No. 1 was wrong. We'll just have
to wait and see about the latest
optimist. Actually, going with
Stanford isn't a shot in the dark
this week; the team's actually
favored, for the first time in six
games.
The Cardinal football followers
in the sports pit of the Daily are
excited. They might actually have
a chanoa to go 10-0 for once. In
one man's effort to do just that,
Cardinal Today editor Chip Hall
has elected to go the Guest Greek
route as well. He selected Jeremy
Mullen, just some random guy he
knows from his freshman dorm,
to make his picks this week.
Considering Hall forgot to
make his picks last wekk, had
them made for him, and went 2-8,
this might be a wise choice. Aside
from that, the dudes from off cam
pus, Mark Rogowsky and Chris
Crader, have surged into first and
second, respectively. Allegations
that their third roomate is a part
time bookie are unconfirmed.
