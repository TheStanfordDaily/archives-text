### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Vandals spray-painted racist
graffiti on a wall of the High
Energy Physics Laboratory over
the weekend.
The graffiti contained the word
"nigger" and and was signed
"Love, Honkeys," according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. The wall has already
been repainted.
"It looks like it could be by a
group of kids," said Niemeyer. "It

was a bunch of nonsensical stuff.
It will definitely go in the files as
vandalism with hate overtones."
"These incidents occur very,
very infrequently."
Stanford occasionally receives
fliers from racial hate groups such
as skinheads or neo-Nazis, accord
ing to Niemeyer. However,
"Stanford simply does not experi
ence very much graffiti," he said.
Police report having no clues
and believe that the graffiti was
not intended for any specific per
son.
