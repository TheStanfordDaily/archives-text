Six faculty members have been
selected to receive 1990 Dean's Awards
for Distinguished Teaching in the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
The winning teachers are Joel Beinin,
associate professor of history; Bias Cabr
era, associate professor of physics; Adri
enne Martin, assistant professor of Span
ish and Portuguese; Robert Sapolsky,
assistant professor of biological sciences;
Edward Solomon, professor of chemistry;
and Mary Wack, associate professor of
English.
The Dean's Awards were established in
1983 and have honored outstanding fac
ulty annually since then. The various

departments within the school are asked
to nominate scholars who have made
superior contributions to teaching in
their respective fields.
Nominations are reviewed by a faculty
screening committee of about three peo
ple. Committee members are appointed
by Humanities and Sciences Dean Ewart
Thomas, and are usually themselves past
recipients of the award.
Candidates were judged not only on
their ability to impart information clearly
and succinctly, but also on the interest
and care they demonstrate for Stanford
students.
A reception was held to celebrate the
event last week. During the ceremony,
recipients were each given a certificate of
commendation and a $1,000 cash prize.

Recipients also receive a $1,000 increase
in their base salary.
Beinin was praised for imparting many
skills to his students in his Middle East
ern history courses. He was commended
for always presenting opposing points of
view, as well as for the candianess with
which he discusses his own views.
Cabrera has taught both the honors
physics sequence for freshmen as well as
the introductory course for engineers. He
was cited by students for his accessibility.
He makes a point of being available after
class to talk to students and answer any
questions they may have.
Martin has been in education since
1979. She has taught Spanish literature
of the Medieval and Golden Age periods to
both undergraduates and graduates at

Stanford for the past three years and was
previously an instructor at Harvard.
Sapolsky has taught both an advanced
course in his area of expertise, human
behavioral biology and Biology 32 of the
biology core. In and out of the classroom,
Sapolsky has been cited by students for
exceptional teaching as well as his willing
ness to listen and help with personal deci
sions.
Solomon said he is also extremely
pleased with the award, which he
attributes to his efforts regarding Chem
istry 31, a course he taught for five years.
When he was at the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, Solomon taught
mainly graduate and advanced under
graduate courses. At Stanford, however,

he rotated into teaching a more general
course.
Solomon organized extensive demon
strations to improve students' under
standing of the lectures and concepts and
even visited the dorms to find out how
students were understanding the mate
rial.
Wack was recognized for her excep
tional teaching of both introductory lec
ture classes and advanced graduate semi
nars. Her classes are known to be intellec
tually demanding, exciting and sophisti
cated.
In addition, Wack has spent time help
ing students sort out tneir academic
careers, freely discusses the options stu
dents have available and sorting out
much confusion in the process.
