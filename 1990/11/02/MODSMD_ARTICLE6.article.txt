# Researcher probes psychological effects of traumatic earthquakes
## 
### Marie Bui 
A few days after a 7.1 earth
quake shook the Bay Area last
year, a Stanford graduate student
in psychology hopped aboard the
San Francisco-Oakland ferry to
ask people how they felt. They
told him, willingly.
Kent Harber's spontaneous
experiment has blossomed into a
study that included nearly 800
telephone interviews and more
than 250 questionnaires over the
past year. The study was funded
by the National Science Founda
tion.
Preliminary results released
this week showed that most peo
ple underwent three phases of
responses following last October's
quake.
During the first month after
the disaster, people talked often
about their anxiety and obsession.
Then they stopped talking as
much and tended to dream about
earthquakes. Finally, about two
months after the quake, most peo
ple got over their distress.
However, 10 to 20 percent of
the people surveyed still worry
about the quake one year later.
For the study, Harber collabo

rated with Southern Methodist
University Psychology Prof.
James Pennebaker, who special
izes in the psychological effect of
disasters or trauma on a commu
nity.
The two met when Pennebaker
visited Stanford to teach in 1988.
"His office was near mine," said
Harber. "I was enthusiastic about
Pennebaker's kind of research."
Although Pennebaker was not
at Stanford during the earth
quake, he and Harber came up
with the idea for a psychological
study simultaneously. Within two
days of the earthquake, when the
telephone lines were restored,
they discussed working together.
Eight times in the past year,
they phoned randomly selected
people in the San Francisco
metropolitan area and a compara
ble group in Dallas, Texas, as a
control.
Subjects were questioned about
their emotional and physical
state, as well as their tolerance to
speak about their earthquake
experiences and listen to the expe
riences of others.
Stanford students were not
included because the poll was lim
ited to San Francisco and because

the sample should not "be limited
to a particular age group," Harber
said.
The point of the survey was to
compare the responses of similar
communities to the earthquake.
When the replies of most San
Francisco residents matched
those of Dallas residents, people
were judged to have reached the
adaptation phase.
Dallas was selected as a control
group because it has "little seis
mic activity and not much of a his
tory of it," Harber said. In addi
tion, he said Dallas is similar
demographically to San Francisco
in terms of age, income and educa
tion levels of residents.
Most San Francisco residents
interviewed at the end of the
study said talking to other quake
survivors was the best way to
cope. Such confidantes often
became more important than rela
tives who did not experience the
earthquake, because there was
less to explain and "more under
standing," Harber said.
For example, a woman who
worked in San Francisco but lived
in the East Bay found solace in
talking to others in the city. She
discovered "these people looked as
lousy as I felt, and I figured, I'm
not crazy after all."
Merely filling out the question
naires or being interviewed was

helpful to some people. One man
agreed to be interviewed only if
Harber promised to talk to his
wife. "She wants a chance to tell
her story," he told Harber.
Another man asked for an
extra survey to photocopy and dis
tribute to co-workers.
Although Harber declined to
specify how the community could
help people cope with future
earthquakes, he said that the pub

lie should "be aware that the need
for counseling might extend
beyond the emergency phase."
He also said the information in
the completed study, which will
include an assessment of crime
rates following the quake, could
be valuable to those who handle
disasters.
The results of the study will be
submitted to psychology journals
within four to six weeks.
