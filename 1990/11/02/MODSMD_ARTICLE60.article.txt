# Presenting ... You!
## Interviews can make or break your job chances 
### Minal Hajratwala 
You've perfected your resume, down
to the last period. You've toiled
over the application and made the
follow-up calls. You've shopped for hours
and spent hundreds of dollars on the
right interview suit. You've even made
sure your breath is minty fresh.
And now, you're ready for the last
step in the lengthy process of finding a
gainful life after Stanford — the dreaded
interview.
Well, almost ready
Knowing what you want
Students who don't do well in inter
views, according to Virginia Mak, coun
selor at the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, should consider that their
biggest problem may be themselves.
"Some people don't know what they
want and why they think they're going
to be good at what they're applying for,"

Mak says. Psychological preparation
involves answering questions such at:
Who am I? What is important to me on
the job? What skills do I want to use?
Doing some research into the com
pany you're interviewing with and the
job you would be doing is essential, says
Mak.
A 1 Barela is program manager of
National College Recruiting Organiza
tion for IBM on the West Coast. Pie says
that students' knowledge about the com
pany is a clear indicator of how inter
ested they are in the job.
"I like to see them come prepared, and
that means do some homework. They
should know something about the com
pany, and also know their niche — where
they're going to fit in the company."
IBM, like most employers, wants to
know why you are interested in the job
and what plans you have for the future.
If you're reluctant to answer or don't
know, Barela says, that makes a poor

impression.
"We look for balanced motivation,
which shows emotional maturity," says
Wayne Blackwelder, San Francisco
recruitment contact for the U.S. Peace
Corps. "Some people say they just want
to serve, without any expectation of
learning anything. Others want only to
travel and have fun."
A little research about the job you're
seeking — perhaps talking to people who
have been in it — can go a long way
toward making sure your expectations
are realistic, and thus convincing a
recruiter that you are a serious appli
cant.
Knowing what you want can also
build confidence, which is essential to a
successful interview. A firm handshake
and looking the interviewer straight in
the eye may, in the final cut, be as impor
tant as your qualifications.
"The recruiter gets a first impression
as soon as a person walks in the door,"
Barela says."I look for assertiveness."
That also means taking the initiative
to ask a lot of questions. After all, the
interview is not just somebody deciding
if they want you — it's also your oppor
tunity to decide if you really want to
work for them.
Knowing what they want
Interviewers or recruiters ask a vari
ety of questions in interviews, but the

main thing is finding out who you are
and whether they can work with you,
according to Mak.
"I usually have your resume already,
so the interview is when I'm going to see
the person as an individual," Barela
says.
"We have a very lengthy bureaucratic
application, so the interview provides us
with a face-to-face opportunity to meet
the applicant," says Blackwelder. "We
are trying to judge suitability — for
example, whether the person is able to
live overseas."
The interview
A typical interview consists of an intro
duction (small talk), discussion of your
qualifications and background, an
opportunity for you to ask questions and
a closing, where the next steps in the
process are discussed.
Most interviews follow this basic for
mat. If you are interviewing for a gov
ernment or academic position, you may
encounter a panel interview, with two or
more individuals.
Occasionally, employers will put appli
cants through a "stress interview," with
particularly confrontational or difficult
questions to test your behavior under
stress. Staying calm and taking your
time to think through your answers is
important here.
Different types of questions are

designed to elicit different types of infor
mation.
First, says Mak, there's the ice
breaker, often the question everyone
hates: "Tell me about yourself."
Don't regurgitate your resume, Mak
advises. Instead, ask yourself, "What do
I want the employer to remember about
me?" Talking about a related work expe
rience that may deserve more than a
two-sentence resume explanation could
be appropriate.
Secondly, some questions will be
designed to figure out what specific
knowledge you have. These are usually
fairly straightforward, as long as you
know your subject. Interviewers might
ask what your favorite and least favorite
course was, and why.
Finally, prospective employers will
want to know how you think and ana
lyze. You could be asked to solve a hypo
thetical problem or situation, or describe
an actual experience.
"We ask for an example of them work
ing in a situation where everything has
not been mapped out for them and
they've had to blaze their own trail, so to
speak," Blackwelder says.
"We also ask how their family and
friends view them applying to the Peace
Corps. We'd like them to be dealing with
a possible negative response before they
actually go overseas."
Mak's formula for success in answer
ing questions is PAR — problem, applica
tion and result.
For example, in answering a question
about your strengths and weaknesses,
you might say something like this:
"I have a tendency to take on too
much at one time (problem). It happened
last spring, when I was doing X project
and taking X classes and participating in
X extracurricular activity, and I got
pretty burned out by the end
(application). So I learned that I need to
set priorities and not over-commit
myself (result or resolution)."
This helps both those who tend to
over-generalize ("Oh, I'm good with peo
ple") and those who go into too much
detail and bore the interviewer. In addi
tion, it shows that you've learned some
thing from the experience.
Speaking of which, even if an inter
view goes badly, you can always learn
from it and do better next time.
Deciding what to wear
Interviewers take the way you dress
as an indication of how serious you are
about the job. Although the general rule
is to dress as you would at work, this
doesn't always apply.
"People have come in wearing blue
jeans and sandals," Blackwelder says.
"The Peace Corps is an interesting situa
tion because it's not like you have to
wear a suit and tie to work. But in an
interview, dressing nicely speaks to pro
fessionalism and motivation."

Appropriate attire is important to
IBM, too. "Some recruiters get offended
if you look sloppy. They think, 'You don't
think enough of me and my company to
dress appropriately,' " Barela says.
At the same time, what you wear
should not distract the interviewer from
who you are. Advises Barela, "Your tie
shouldn't be talking louder than you
are."
When in doubt, Mak says, "dress con
servatively."
Getting help
Because of University-wide budget
cuts, the CPPC has made some changes
in the way it operates, although it still
offers several services for people who
want help with interview skills.
A handout, "Preparing for Inter
views," provides most of the basic infor
mation and some helpful tips. Group
workshops are also available, and tend to
be interactive. A workshop will be held
Oct. 31 at 2:15 p.m. in the CPPC Confer
ence Room.
Finally, individual counseling is also
available. Before you can make an
appointment, you must attend a "getting
started" workshop about various self
help resources at the center. Then, if you
don't find the resources you need, you
can get counseling.
One activity you can do in an individ
ual appointment is a mock interview,
which is videotaped and then replayed.

This is useful, Mak says, because "you
don't always know how you project to
others."
Just be yourself
But no amount of practice, training or
research can help with the most impor
tant thing: being yourself.
Being nervous is natural, especially if
you really care about the outcome of the
interview, but nervousness should not be
paralyzing. "Even the most confident
person feels nervous," Mak says. "But
nervous energy, if channeled in a positive
way, can really help you perform at your
best."
Tara Dorfman, a 1990 graduate of the
Stanford Teacher Education Project who
teaches U.S. History at a Hayward high
school, says she has much experience
with the interview process.
"I had interviewed people to be RAs at
ATO. It made me realize that it does
matter how you carry yourself, that you
seem confident and not take the issues
lightly. You can be funny, but don't joke
about the important things. I guess it
also made me worry less about the spe
cific content of my answers, since the
overall impression is more important."
As the lottery says, "Somebody's
going to win. Why not you?" And hope
fully, armed with a few simple tips and
some basic research, your odds of getting
hired will beat your odds of winning the
lottery.

Interviewers or recruiters ask a vari
ety of questions in interviews, but the

main thing is finding out who you are
and whether they can work with you,
according to Mak.
"I usually have your resume already,
so the interview is when I'm going to see
the person as an individual," Barela
says.
"We have a very lengthy bureaucratic
application, so the interview provides us
with a face-to-face opportunity to meet
the applicant," says Blackwelder. "We
are trying to judge suitability — for
example, whether the person is able to
live overseas."
The interview
A typical interview consists of an intro
duction (small talk), discussion of your
qualifications and background, an
opportunity for you to ask questions and
a closing, where the next steps in the
process are discussed.
Most interviews follow this basic for
mat. If you are interviewing for a gov
ernment or academic position, you may
encounter a panel interview, with two or
more individuals.
Occasionally, employers will put appli
cants through a "stress interview," with
particularly confrontational or difficult
questions to test your behavior under
stress. Staying calm and taking your
time to think through your answers is
important here.
Different types of questions are

designed to elicit different types of infor
mation.
First, says Mak, there's the ice
breaker, often the question everyone
hates: "Tell me about yourself."
Don't regurgitate your resume, Mak
advises. Instead, ask yourself, "What do
I want the employer to remember about
me?" Talking about a related work expe
rience that may deserve more than a
two-sentence resume explanation could
be appropriate.
Secondly, some questions will be
designed to figure out what specific
knowledge you have. These are usually
fairly straightforward, as long as you
know your subject. Interviewers might
ask what your favorite and least favorite
course was, and why.
Finally, prospective employers will
want to know how you think and ana
lyze. You could be asked to solve a hypo
thetical problem or situation, or describe
an actual experience.
"We ask for an example of them work
ing in a situation where everything has
not been mapped out for them and
they've had to blaze their own trail, so to
speak," Blackwelder says.
"We also ask how their family and
friends view them applying to the Peace
Corps. We'd like them to be dealing with
a possible negative response before they
actually go overseas."
Mak's formula for success in answer
ing questions is PAR — problem, applica
tion and result.
For example, in answering a question
about your strengths and weaknesses,
you might say something like this:
"I have a tendency to take on too
much at one time (problem). It happened
last spring, when I was doing X project
and taking X classes and participating in
X extracurricular activity, and I got
pretty burned out by the end
(application). So I learned that I need to
set priorities and not over-commit
myself (result or resolution)."
This helps both those who tend to
over-generalize ("Oh, I'm good with peo
ple") and those who go into too much
detail and bore the interviewer. In addi
tion, it shows that you've learned some
thing from the experience.
Speaking of which, even if an inter
view goes badly, you can always learn
from it and do better next time.
Deciding what to wear
Interviewers take the way you dress
as an indication of how serious you are
about the job. Although the general rule
is to dress as you would at work, this
doesn't always apply.
"People have come in wearing blue
jeans and sandals," Blackwelder says.
"The Peace Corps is an interesting situa
tion because it's not like you have to
wear a suit and tie to work. But in an
interview, dressing nicely speaks to pro
fessionalism and motivation."

Appropriate attire is important to
IBM, too. "Some recruiters get offended
if you look sloppy. They think, 'You don't
think enough of me and my company to
dress appropriately,' " Barela says.
At the same time, what you wear
should not distract the interviewer from
who you are. Advises Barela, "Your tie
shouldn't be talking louder than you
are."
When in doubt, Mak says, "dress con
servatively."
Getting help
Because of University-wide budget
cuts, the CPPC has made some changes
in the way it operates, although it still
offers several services for people who
want help with interview skills.
A handout, "Preparing for Inter
views," provides most of the basic infor
mation and some helpful tips. Group
workshops are also available, and tend to
be interactive. A workshop will be held
Oct. 31 at 2:15 p.m. in the CPPC Confer
ence Room.
Finally, individual counseling is also
available. Before you can make an
appointment, you must attend a "getting
started" workshop about various self
help resources at the center. Then, if you
don't find the resources you need, you
can get counseling.
One activity you can do in an individ
ual appointment is a mock interview,
which is videotaped and then replayed.

This is useful, Mak says, because "you
don't always know how you project to
others."
Just be yourself
But no amount of practice, training or
research can help with the most impor
tant thing: being yourself.
Being nervous is natural, especially if
you really care about the outcome of the
interview, but nervousness should not be
paralyzing. "Even the most confident
person feels nervous," Mak says. "But
nervous energy, if channeled in a positive
way, can really help you perform at your
best."
Tara Dorfman, a 1990 graduate of the
Stanford Teacher Education Project who
teaches U.S. History at a Hayward high
school, says she has much experience
with the interview process.
"I had interviewed people to be RAs at
ATO. It made me realize that it does
matter how you carry yourself, that you
seem confident and not take the issues
lightly. You can be funny, but don't joke
about the important things. I guess it
also made me worry less about the spe
cific content of my answers, since the
overall impression is more important."
As the lottery says, "Somebody's
going to win. Why not you?" And hope
fully, armed with a few simple tips and
some basic research, your odds of getting
hired will beat your odds of winning the
lottery.
You've perfected your resume, down
to the last period. You've toiled
over the application and made the
follow-up calls. You've shopped for hours
and spent hundreds of dollars on the
right interview suit. You've even made
sure your breath is minty fresh.
And now, you're ready for the last
step in the lengthy process of finding a
gainful life after Stanford — the dreaded
interview.
Well, almost ready
Knowing what you want
Students who don't do well in inter
views, according to Virginia Mak, coun
selor at the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, should consider that their
biggest problem may be themselves.
"Some people don't know what they
want and why they think they're going
to be good at what they're applying for,"

Mak says. Psychological preparation
involves answering questions such at:
Who am I? What is important to me on
the job? What skills do I want to use?
Doing some research into the com
pany you're interviewing with and the
job you would be doing is essential, says
Mak.
A 1 Barela is program manager of
National College Recruiting Organiza
tion for IBM on the West Coast. Pie says
that students' knowledge about the com
pany is a clear indicator of how inter
ested they are in the job.
"I like to see them come prepared, and
that means do some homework. They
should know something about the com
pany, and also know their niche — where
they're going to fit in the company."
IBM, like most employers, wants to
know why you are interested in the job
and what plans you have for the future.
If you're reluctant to answer or don't
know, Barela says, that makes a poor

impression.
"We look for balanced motivation,
which shows emotional maturity," says
Wayne Blackwelder, San Francisco
recruitment contact for the U.S. Peace
Corps. "Some people say they just want
to serve, without any expectation of
learning anything. Others want only to
travel and have fun."
A little research about the job you're
seeking — perhaps talking to people who
have been in it — can go a long way
toward making sure your expectations
are realistic, and thus convincing a
recruiter that you are a serious appli
cant.
Knowing what you want can also
build confidence, which is essential to a
successful interview. A firm handshake
and looking the interviewer straight in
the eye may, in the final cut, be as impor
tant as your qualifications.
"The recruiter gets a first impression
as soon as a person walks in the door,"
Barela says."I look for assertiveness."
That also means taking the initiative
to ask a lot of questions. After all, the
interview is not just somebody deciding
if they want you — it's also your oppor

tion, it shows that you've learned some
thing from the experience.
Speaking of which, even if an inter
view goes badly, you can always learn
from it and do better next time.
Deciding what to wear
Interviewers take the way you dress
as an indication of how serious you are
about the job. Although the general rule
is to dress as you would at work, this
doesn't always apply.
"People have come in wearing blue
jeans and sandals," Blackwelder says.
"The Peace Corps is an interesting situa
tion because it's not like you have to
wear a suit and tie to work. But in an
interview, dressing nicely speaks to pro
fessionalism and motivation."

Appropriate attire is important to
IBM, too. "Some recruiters get offended
if you look sloppy. They think, 'You don't
think enough of me and my company to
dress appropriately,' " Barela says.
At the same time, what you wear
should not distract the interviewer from
who you are. Advises Barela, "Your tie
shouldn't be talking louder than you
are."
When in doubt, Mak says, "dress con
servatively."
Getting help
Because of University-wide budget
cuts, the CPPC has made some changes
in the way it operates, although it still
offers several services for people who
want help with interview skills.
A handout, "Preparing for Inter
views," provides most of the basic infor
mation and some helpful tips. Group
workshops are also available, and tend to
be interactive. A workshop will be held
Oct. 31 at 2:15 p.m. in the CPPC Confer
ence Room.
Finally, individual counseling is also
available. Before you can make an
appointment, you must attend a "getting
started" workshop about various self
help resources at the center. Then, if you
don't find the resources you need, you
can get counseling.
One activity you can do in an individ
ual appointment is a mock interview,
which is videotaped and then replayed.

This is useful, Mak says, because "you
don't always know how you project to
others."
Just be yourself
But no amount of practice, training or
research can help with the most impor
tant thing: being yourself.
Being nervous is natural, especially if
you really care about the outcome of the
interview, but nervousness should not be
paralyzing. "Even the most confident
person feels nervous," Mak says. "But
nervous energy, if channeled in a positive
way, can really help you perform at your
best."
Tara Dorfman, a 1990 graduate of the
Stanford Teacher Education Project who
teaches U.S. History at a Hayward high
school, says she has much experience
with the interview process.
"I had interviewed people to be RAs at
ATO. It made me realize that it does
matter how you carry yourself, that you
seem confident and not take the issues
lightly. You can be funny, but don't joke
about the important things. I guess it
also made me worry less about the spe
cific content of my answers, since the
overall impression is more important."

You've perfected your resume, down

Knowing what you want
Students who don't do well in inter
views, according to Virginia Mak, coun
selor at the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, should consider that their
biggest problem may be themselves.
"Some people don't know what they
want and why they think they're going
to be good at what they're applying for,"

Mak says. Psychological preparation
involves answering questions such at:
Who am I? What is important to me on
the job? What skills do I want to use?
Doing some research into the com
pany you're interviewing with and the
job you would be doing is essential, says
Mak.
A 1 Barela is program manager of
National College Recruiting Organiza
tion for IBM on the West Coast. Pie says
that students' knowledge about the com
pany is a clear indicator of how inter
ested they are in the job.
"I like to see them come prepared, and
that means do some homework. They
should know something about the com
pany, and also know their niche — where
they're going to fit in the company."
IBM, like most employers, wants to
know why you are interested in the job
and what plans you have for the future.
If you're reluctant to answer or don't
know, Barela says, that makes a poor

impression.
"We look for balanced motivation,
which shows emotional maturity," says
Wayne Blackwelder, San Francisco
recruitment contact for the U.S. Peace
Corps. "Some people say they just want
to serve, without any expectation of
learning anything. Others want only to
travel and have fun."
A little research about the job you're
seeking — perhaps talking to people who
have been in it — can go a long way
toward making sure your expectations
are realistic, and thus convincing a
recruiter that you are a serious appli
cant.
Knowing what you want can also
build confidence, which is essential to a
successful interview. A firm handshake
and looking the interviewer straight in
the eye may, in the final cut, be as impor
tant as your qualifications.
"The recruiter gets a first impression
as soon as a person walks in the door,"
Barela says."I look for assertiveness."
That also means taking the initiative
to ask a lot of questions. After all, the
interview is not just somebody deciding
if they want you — it's also your oppor
tunity to decide if you really want to
work for them.
Knowing what they want
Interviewers or recruiters ask a vari
ety of questions in interviews, but the

main thing is finding out who you are
and whether they can work with you,
according to Mak.
"I usually have your resume already,
so the interview is when I'm going to see
the person as an individual," Barela
says.
"We have a very lengthy bureaucratic
application, so the interview provides us
with a face-to-face opportunity to meet
the applicant," says Blackwelder. "We
are trying to judge suitability — for
example, whether the person is able to
live overseas."
The interview
A typical interview consists of an intro
duction (small talk), discussion of your
qualifications and background, an
opportunity for you to ask questions and
a closing, where the next steps in the
process are discussed.
Most interviews follow this basic for
mat. If you are interviewing for a gov
ernment or academic position, you may
encounter a panel interview, with two or
more individuals.
Occasionally, employers will put appli
cants through a "stress interview," with
particularly confrontational or difficult
questions to test your behavior under
stress. Staying calm and taking your
time to think through your answers is
important here.
Different types of questions are

designed to elicit different types of infor
mation.
First, says Mak, there's the ice
breaker, often the question everyone
hates: "Tell me about yourself."
Don't regurgitate your resume, Mak
advises. Instead, ask yourself, "What do
I want the employer to remember about
me?" Talking about a related work expe
rience that may deserve more than a
two-sentence resume explanation could
be appropriate.
Secondly, some questions will be
designed to figure out what specific
knowledge you have. These are usually
fairly straightforward, as long as you
know your subject. Interviewers might
ask what your favorite and least favorite
course was, and why.
Finally, prospective employers will
want to know how you think and ana
lyze. You could be asked to solve a hypo
thetical problem or situation, or describe
an actual experience.
"We ask for an example of them work
ing in a situation where everything has
not been mapped out for them and
they've had to blaze their own trail, so to
speak," Blackwelder says.
"We also ask how their family and
friends view them applying to the Peace
Corps. We'd like them to be dealing with
a possible negative response before they
actually go overseas."
Mak's formula for success in answer
ing questions is PAR — problem, applica
tion and result.
For example, in answering a question
about your strengths and weaknesses,
you might say something like this:
"I have a tendency to take on too
much at one time (problem). It happened
last spring, when I was doing X project
and taking X classes and participating in
X extracurricular activity, and I got
pretty burned out by the end
(application). So I learned that I need to
set priorities and not over-commit
myself (result or resolution)."
This helps both those who tend to
over-generalize ("Oh, I'm good with peo
ple") and those who go into too much
detail and bore the interviewer. In addi
tion, it shows that you've learned some
thing from the experience.
Speaking of which, even if an inter
view goes badly, you can always learn
from it and do better next time.
