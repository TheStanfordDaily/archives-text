# Secrets of 'Success'
## Confessions of an unemployed 1990 Stanford graduate 
### Chris Adamson 
Usually overlooked in discussions
of Life After Stanford is the invig
orating, free-wheeling existence
of the unemployed recent Stanford grad.
It could happen to anyone. In this
case, it happened to me.
I graduated last June with dual
degrees in Symbolic Systems and
English, which makes just slightly more
sense than majoring in Toad Spit and
Billiards.

Two degrees, no job. Pretty lame,
you're probably thinking.
Oh sure, I've got excuses — I was
rejected from what I thought was a sure
fire job during my last finals week, the
country is headed into a recession and
companies aren't hiring, my biorhythms
are really bad from now until next July
— but this passing of the buck won't get
me out of the house any time soon.
Of course, not having to wake up for

classes or work might strike some as s
great way to live, but such a life is ulti
mately disappointing; you eventually
find yourself waking up for game shows
or "Alvin and the Chipmunks" anyway.
In my case, it was halfway through
the episode in which Alvin convinces
Simon and Theodore to dress up as a
heavy metal band that I decided it was
high time I got some money in the bank
before the rent came due. Accomplishing

this is a three-part process. . . .
STEP 1: Find employers who won't laugh at your resume.
What? No resume? We'll see to that!
The essential elements of good resume writing are 1) access
to a laser writer and 2) good fiction writing skills. Both of these
aim toward a higher goal: making yourself look better than you
actually are. However, there are practical limits on the use of
exaggeration in describing your experience. Referring to the
move-the-boxes-around-the-warehouse summer job as "inven
tory management" is perfectly acceptable. But listing "Orga
nizer and performer, Live Aid Global Concert" is perhaps an
error.
Once your resume is prepared, you need potential employers
to send it to. In my days at Stanford, I learned two big secrets.
The first is that watching Stanford football is painful enough
without yell-leaders.
The second is that responding to classified advertisements is
essentially a waste of time. This is because half of the ads are
formalities for companies who have already promoted from
within, and the others are just practical jokes. (Or so I was led
to believe when a potential employer responded to my resume
not with the usual form letter or postcard, but with a singing
telegram that read: "You're no good, you're no good, you're no
good; baby, you're no good.)
Ultimately, however, I did make contact with an employer
who seemed very interested in hiring me — and strangely
enough, I got its name and address from the Career Planning
and Placement Center. Imagine that! This leads to part two of
the moneymaking process. . . .

The essential elements of good
resume writing are 1) access to a
laser writer and 2) good fiction writ
ing skills.

STEP 2: Interview
In the Northern California job market, there is one crucial
question to ask yourself when interviewing for a job: what
should I wear? In all my interviews, I have always been the
most overdressed person in the room. Interview suits make you
seem exceedingly formal when talking to six middle-aged men
in T-shirts and shorts. But if you go in wearing a T-shirt your
self, the secretary at the front desk will probably point you
toward the loading dock.
I he interview is not meant to be an interchange of experi
ence and ideas; it is meant to see just how much you lied on
your cover letter and resume. To this end, Microsoft Corp.
started a major trend by having its job applicants write difficult
computer programs during interviews. This practice, which
effectively weeds out all the desperate Drama majors, is gain
ing widespread acceptance in the industry. Mechanical engi
neers interviewing at General Motors will be expected to
assemble an automatic transmission on the spot, and I hear
that Disney now makes their applicants sing show-tunes dur
ing the interview.
Another popular trick interviewers use is to ask for your
greatest assets and liabilities. If you're going to admit there is
anything wrong with you, make it something small, such as
having messy handwriting or liking country music. Don't men
tion the time you lost control of your uncle's RV and acciden
tally wiped out that troop of Girl Scouts.
When applying for a job, it is important to get as much infor
mation out of your interviewer as they get from you. For this
reason, I always ask about the goals and future of the company.
In my last interview, this didn't work out so well. (By the way,
this really happened):
"Where do you see E— in two years?" I asked.
"Well, I hope we're still here."
"You mean you really like Redwood City?"
"No, I mean I hope we're still in business."
"Huh?"
"I guess I should have told you at the beginning of the inter
view. We're in Chapter 11 reorganization at the moment. We
used to have 100 employees, and now we're down to 20. In fact,
we can't even consider you until the next fiscal quarter."
Great, I thought. I might as well be serving drinks on the
Exxon Valdez. I was particularly upset this exchange took place
after I was asked to write a full-featured word processor pro
gram in the first hour of the interview.
I left this interview thinking how great it would be to work
with this company for the last three or four months of its exis
tence. I went home, sat down in front of the TV, and suddenly
came across part three. . . .
STEP 3: Buy into a "get-rich-quick" scheme
Somewhere around channel 70 or 80 on the television, I
came across a program called "Secrets of Success." Essentially
a half-hour commercial, the show features a man named
Thomas Vu who usually appears on a yacht with four bikini
clad women behind him as he tells his Horatio Alger story of
transforming himself from an indigent immigrant into a beam
ing tycoon.
He hints that the "secret of success" is buying "distressed
properties" — such as houses that have to be sold as a result of
divorce, drug bust or bankruptcy — well below their actual
value and immediately reselling them for enormous profit.
That's right: the "secret" is "buy low, sell high." I could have
told you that.
If you stay up late enough, Vu tells you which local Holiday
Inn is hosting his seminar which will tell you how "you, too,
can be rich and happy like me."
Slowly realizing where Vu is making the real money, I con
sidered putting together my own "get-rich-quick" seminar, but
gave it up when I couldn't find yachts or bikini-clad extras for
rent.
Another intriguing scheme is to let civic governments give
you ridiculous amounts of cash just to consider moving your
professional football team to their towns. A 1 Davis made $10
million this year with this plan. Unfortunately, the city of Palo
Alto said I couldn't rezone my block of Embarcadero for use as
a new stadium.
As you've probably discovered, I have not made a ton of
money at this point in time. All the advice I've given in the pre
ceding paragraphs is of dubious benefit (at best) and no one
involved in the production of this article can be held liable if
you follow any of these suggestions.
Sorry I couldn't tell you either how to land a job or how to
master the art of post-graduation unemployment, but face it:
if I knew that, I wouldn 7 be writing a 1,500-word piece for The
Daily.
So, I've got to take off and make it on time for my voice
lessons — I'm interviewing at Disney tomorrow.

Chris Adamson is a source of continued embarrassment to
friends, family and even complete strangers. As an undergrad,
he did a whole bunch of nifty extracurriculars, while working
toward two degrees. Nowadays, he sits around the house, wait
ing for "Tiny Toons " to come on at 4:30. . . .
