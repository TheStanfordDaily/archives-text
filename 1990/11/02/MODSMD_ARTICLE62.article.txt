# Changing Careers
## The 						job you always wanted may not be right for you 
### Elaine M. Riggs 
Life is funny. Life is really funny when you graduate. Just
ask any one of the recent Stanford grads who got the job
they always wanted, only to find out it was totally wrong.
We all go through the same patterns — surprise, disillusion
ment, denial and then ... it gets tricky. How do we admit to
the world that we messed up? Do we quit? Do we tough it out?
I think — and this is a report from the front lines — that a
lot of us have taken a deep breath and made a switch.
I have some close friends who are still at Stanford, and they
tend look a bit nervous when I launch into my melodramatic
tale of That Ridiculous Year. ("Elaine, we've been watching you
to see what it's like out there. Is it really going to be that
awful?") Of course not. But if your first year out doesn't go like
you'd planned, you will get through it more easily if you know
to look out for a few warning signs along the way.

I thought I must have misheard Randy, my assignment edi
tor. I asked him to repeat what he said.
"So, what's your next career going to be?" he asked, smiling
jovially.
Come on. It was my first day of work at KING-5 News in
Seattle, Wash. I was just out of Stanford and I had made it.

Who was he kidding?
It took ten months before I declared I was in the wrong job,
the wrong career, the wrong city.
It all came down to a few minutes in the newsroom at 4:30
a.m., sitting in front of a terminal, and finally facing up to what
I was doing with my life. There weren't a lot of people around
at that hour, so I had a little conversation with myself.
"I'm pounding out a story on a sick and disgusting homi
cide."
Your favorite movie is "Field of Dreams." You're proud of
the fact that you haven't seen "The Shining." How can you
write that stuff?
"I'm working from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m."
You spent four years in the dorms — right along with every
one else's crazy schedules — and loved every minute of it. But
now you never see anyone. How can you stand it?
"I'm living in Seattle."
These people have a serious attitude against Californians.
You drive around with a 49ers' hat on display. Do you belong
here?
"I'm supposed to watch television news all the time."
You never watched TV news. You always preferred The San
Francisco Chronicle and KCBS. Why would that change now?
"I'm earning $6.18 an hour."
That's worth it if you know you 're on track to something you

know you want. But how do you feel
right now ?
Ready to get the heck out of there. I
mean, it was so clear that everything —
the TT news business with its manic
attention to every second and embar
rassing devotion to ratings; the bizarre
hours; the questionable pay; and my
own discovery that I couldn't stand
Seattle, with its high-and-mighty, Cali
fornians-get-out attitude. ... It all
added up to one big word beginning with
the letter "Q."
But that's tough. So I procrastinated
for a while — by getting bronchitis.
I coughed and hacked through two
weeks alone in my apartment, running
up a huge phone bill to Pat and John
back at Stanford — the kind of friends
you call when the world falls apart. Of
course, they couldn't quite understand
what was happening, but they were
amused and concerned enough to say all
the right things.
"Elaine, we love you no matter what
you do."
That helps — particularly because
it's not that hard to leave an unfortu
nate situation, but it can be difficult to
come back (or move on) and show every
one, including yourself, that you did the

right thing.
I quit and left for the Bay Area the
next day, returning with no job and little
savings. That didn't look terribly suc
cessful — but if you looked closely, you
could see I was happy for the first time
in 10 months.
I had learned enough to know exactly
what I wanted — and in three weeks I
joined Pearson Communications Group,
a high-tech marketing firm in Santa
Clara.
I still deal with the press, but I'm also
learning aspects of business and market
ing that will give me the opportunity to
have those things that matter to me —
things I wouldn't have admitted to dur
ing my senior year at Stanford because I
had never gone without them — like
basically normal hours, a salary that
reflects respect and a career track that
lets me stay in the Bay Area if I choose.
I also really enjoy working for a small
company. We're a tight group of nine and
we work hard and have fun.
I've been back for about five months
now, and I can finally look back on that
year and laugh. But I take it seriously,
too. I should have known myself better
— thought about who I am and what's
important to me personally, instead of

just my "careers goals" which sounded
so good when I said "television news
producer." If I had, that 4:30 a.m. con
versation wouldn't have been such a
surprise to me. It wouldn't have hap
pened at all.
There are a lot of talented, dedicated
and hard-working people at KING. Inci
dentally, being paid at all is a bonus
when you're just starting out in the TV
news business. I certainly don't blame
KING for that long year. That would
have been easy, but then I would have
just moved on to another station instead
of realizing that I didn't want to work in
TV news.
Your first year out of Stanford will
probably hold surprises, and in the end,
it's best to embrace them, learn from
them — and please, don't hold on to an
outdated vision of who you are. Tough it
out for a while, by all means. But if you
know you're on the wrong track and you
want a different career from the one you
had pictured — make a change.

currently living in Menlo Park with two

news business. I certainly don't blame
KING for that long year. That would
have been easy, but then I would have
just moved on to another station instead
of realizing that I didn't want to work in
TV news.
Your first year out of Stanford will
probably hold surprises, and in the end,
it's best to embrace them, learn from
them — and please, don't hold on to an
outdated vision of who you are. Tough it
out for a while, by all means. But if you
know you're on the wrong track and you
want a different career from the one you
had pictured — make a change.

Life is funny. Life is really funny when you graduate. Just
ask any one of the recent Stanford grads who got the job
they always wanted, only to find out it was totally wrong.
We all go through the same patterns — surprise, disillusion
ment, denial and then ... it gets tricky. How do we admit to
the world that we messed up? Do we quit? Do we tough it out?
I think — and this is a report from the front lines — that a
lot of us have taken a deep breath and made a switch.
I have some close friends who are still at Stanford, and they
tend look a bit nervous when I launch into my melodramatic
tale of That Ridiculous Year. ("Elaine, we've been watching you
to see what it's like out there. Is it really going to be that
awful?") Of course not. But if your first year out doesn't go like
you'd planned, you will get through it more easily if you know
to look out for a few warning signs along the way.

I thought I must have misheard Randy, my assignment edi
tor. I asked him to repeat what he said.
"So, what's your next career going to be?" he asked, smiling
jovially.
Come on. It was my first day of work at KING-5 News in
Seattle, Wash. I was just out of Stanford and I had made it.

Who was he kidding?
It took ten months before I declared I was in the wrong job,
the wrong career, the wrong city.
It all came down to a few minutes in the newsroom at 4:30
a.m., sitting in front of a terminal, and finally facing up to what
I was doing with my life. There weren't a lot of people around
at that hour, so I had a little conversation with myself.
"I'm pounding out a story on a sick and disgusting homi
cide."
Your favorite movie is "Field of Dreams." You're proud of
the fact that you haven't seen "The Shining." How can you
write that stuff?
"I'm working from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m."
You spent four years in the dorms — right along with every
one else's crazy schedules — and loved every minute of it. But
now you never see anyone. How can you stand it?
"I'm living in Seattle."
These people have a serious attitude against Californians.
You drive around with a 49ers' hat on display. Do you belong
here?
"I'm supposed to watch television news all the time."
You never watched TV news. You always preferred The San
Francisco Chronicle and KCBS. Why would that change now?
"I'm earning $6.18 an hour."
That's worth it if you know you 're on track to something you

know you want. But how do you feel
right now ?
Ready to get the heck out of there. I
mean, it was so clear that everything —
the TT news business with its manic
attention to every second and embar
rassing devotion to ratings; the bizarre
hours; the questionable pay; and my
own discovery that I couldn't stand
Seattle, with its high-and-mighty, Cali
fornians-get-out attitude. ... It all
added up to one big word beginning with
the letter "Q."
But that's tough. So I procrastinated
for a while — by getting bronchitis.
I coughed and hacked through two
weeks alone in my apartment, running
up a huge phone bill to Pat and John
back at Stanford — the kind of friends
you call when the world falls apart. Of
course, they couldn't quite understand
what was happening, but they were
amused and concerned enough to say all
the right things.
"Elaine, we love you no matter what
you do."
That helps — particularly because
it's not that hard to leave an unfortu
nate situation, but it can be difficult to
come back (or move on) and show every
one, including yourself, that you did the

right thing.
I quit and left for the Bay Area the
next day, returning with no job and little
savings. That didn't look terribly suc
cessful — but if you looked closely, you
could see I was happy for the first time
in 10 months.
I had learned enough to know exactly
what I wanted — and in three weeks I
joined Pearson Communications Group,
a high-tech marketing firm in Santa
Clara.
I still deal with the press, but I'm also
learning aspects of business and market
ing that will give me the opportunity to
have those things that matter to me —
things I wouldn't have admitted to dur
ing my senior year at Stanford because I
had never gone without them — like
basically normal hours, a salary that
reflects respect and a career track that
lets me stay in the Bay Area if I choose.
I also really enjoy working for a small
company. We're a tight group of nine and
we work hard and have fun.
I've been back for about five months
now, and I can finally look back on that
year and laugh. But I take it seriously,
too. I should have known myself better
— thought about who I am and what's
important to me personally, instead of

just my "careers goals" which sounded
so good when I said "television news
producer." If I had, that 4:30 a.m. con
versation wouldn't have been such a
surprise to me. It wouldn't have hap
pened at all.
There are a lot of talented, dedicated
and hard-working people at KING. Inci
