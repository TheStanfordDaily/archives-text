# Changing Careers
## The
						job you always wanted may not be right for you 
### Elaine M. Riggs 
Life is funny. Life is really funny when you graduate. Just
ask any one of the recent Stanford grads who got the job
they always wanted, only to find out it was totally wrong.
We all go through the same patterns — surprise, disillusion
ment, denial and then ... it gets tricky. How do we admit to
the world that we messed up? Do we quit? Do we tough it out?
I think — and this is a report from the front lines — that a
lot of us have taken a deep breath and made a switch.
I have some close friends who are still at Stanford, and they
tend look a bit nervous when I launch into my melodramatic
tale of That Ridiculous Year. ("Elaine, we've been watching you
to see what it's like out there. Is it really going to be that
awful?") Of course not. But if your first year out doesn't go like
you'd planned, you will get through it more easily if you know
to look out for a few warning signs along the way.

I thought I must have misheard Randy, my assignment edi
tor. I asked him to repeat what he said.
"So, what's your next career going to be?" he asked, smiling
jovially.
Come on. It was my first day of work at KING-5 News in
Seattle, Wash. I was just out of Stanford and I had made it.

Who was he kidding?
It took ten months before I declared I was in the wrong job,
the wrong career, the wrong city.
It all came down to a few minutes in the newsroom at 4:30
a.m., sitting in front of a terminal, and finally facing up to what
I was doing with my life. There weren't a lot of people around
at that hour, so I had a little conversation with myself.
"I'm pounding out a story on a sick and disgusting homi
cide."
Your favorite movie is "Field of Dreams." You're proud of
the fact that you haven't seen "The Shining." How can you
write that stuff?
"I'm working from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m."
You spent four years in the dorms — right along with every
one else's crazy schedules — and loved every minute of it. But
now you never see anyone. How can you stand it?
"I'm living in Seattle."
These people have a serious attitude against Californians.
You drive around with a 49ers' hat on display. Do you belong
here?
"I'm supposed to watch television news all the time."
You never watched TV news. You always preferred The San
Francisco Chronicle and KCBS. Why would that change now?
"I'm earning $6.18 an hour."
That's worth it if you know you 're on track to something you

for her. She now works at Pearson Communications group in Santa Clara.
