# JOB Hunt
## The 						companies are searching, too 
### John Louie 
Students on the verge of receiving degrees often have
ambivalent feelings; while half are elated and relieved to
be finishing school, the other half are scared about enter
ing "the real world." To many seniors, the words "job search"
are enough to want to remain in school — indefinitely.
But many Stanford students are unaware that the employ
ers are often the ones doing the searching. Recruitment direc
tors, representing more than 500 companies and organizations
from across the nation, visit campus during each school year.
By utilizing channels offered by the Career Planning and
Placement Center, students can access these employment
opportunities, which range from summer internships to per
manent positions.
The On-Campus Recruiting System, a program operated by
the CPPC, provides opportunities for students to interview
with recruiting agents during the school year. Although many
of the participating employers are large companies, the pro
gram offers positions in a wide variety of fields, including pub
lic service, consulting, investment banking, education, commu
nications, international affairs and summer camps.
Companies which hire many Stanford students each year
include Hewlett Packard, IBM and Bank of America.
According to Ruth Schneider, director of the CPPC, the
recruitment program is used by about 1,000 Stanford students
each year. "The [program] is primarily utilized by those about
to receive a degree at the bachelor and masters levels," Schnei
der said.
The recruiting program uses two systems for scheduling
interviews with recruitment officials. For opportunities involv
ing technical skills and selected public service positions, inter
views are scheduled using a "first-come, first-served" basis.
"The supply and demand for technical positions is fairly well
balanced," Schneider said. "Most students searching for a tech

nical spot will be able to find a place."
For liberal arts positions, however, scheduling interviews is
a much more competitive process. The program uses a bidding
system for employers interested in non-technical positions. In
the bidding system, students are allocated a specific amount of
points at the beginning of each quarter, and must "bid" for
interview opportunities by distributing his or her points.
"This causes students to make some choices," Schneider
said, "and to look into types of employment." Before converting
to this system, students would camp in White Plaza in order to
sign up for interviews with popular companies. Because of the
high demand and competition for these opportunities, Schnei
der believes that the bidding system "makes things more equi
table."
Although competition for specific opportunities may be dif
ficult now, the number of participating companies and organi
zations increases each year. "On-campus recruiting is a very
expensive program for a company," Schneider said. "But while
many companies are cutting back on their visits, Stanford is
always on their list, and our recruitment program continues to
flourish."
Schneider believes that many companies are attracted to


The Perfect Recruit
Stanford because of our academic reputation. "We are a tar
geted school full of accomplished students," she said.
However, according to some recruitment directors, the Stan
ford name alone is not enough to secure employment positions.
Rende Laßran, senior consultant for Monitor Company, a man
agement consulting firm in Los Angeles, said that because
standards are set on an absolute scale, the school itself "doesn't
matter."
"We always look at the student's grade point average as well
as the typical school GPA," Laßran said. "Stanford students
tend to have slightly higher GPAs. But in the end, there is no
difference on an absolute quality basis."
Schneider believes that although GPA is a determining fac
tor in the hiring process, other factors play more significant
roles. "It's really important that students articulate what they
want to do," Schneider said. "This shows the thought behind a
student's decision. A student really needs to know about the
company to articulate enthusiasm to the employer."

According to some recruitment direc
tors, the Stanford name alone is not
enough to secure a job. At one compa
ny, because standards are set on an
absolute scale, the school itself doesn't
matter. 'We always look at the student's
grade point average as well as the typi
cal school GPA. Stanford students tend
to have slightly higher GPAs. But in the
end, there is no difference on an abso
lute quality basis,' one consultant said.

Monitor statistics credit Stanford as one of the primary West
Coast sources for their college student employment program.
"We get about equal numbers from Stanford, Berkeley and
other Ivy League schools," Laßran said. "We hire about six to
10 college students each year, and usually hire from the top
schools."
Holly Johnson, director of recruiting for the San Francisco
based Andersen Consulting, a business system integrating
company, also said that Stanford is perennially a good source of
student employment. "We hire the most students from Stan
ford, Berkeley, California Polytechnic Institiute in San Luis
Obispo and Santa Clara University," Johnson said. "Many are
hired for our San Francisco office, but some are offered oppor
tunities at our branches around the world."
Andersen uses both CPPC sign-up systems in their recruit
ment process. "Fifty-five percent of our new hires are engineer
ing or computer science majors," Johnson said, "and forty-five
percent are business, science or liberal arts majors."
One reason why the CPPC offers fewer opportunities for
summer internships is that many companies are reluctant to
hire students for such a short time. "It's difficult to give a
meaningful experience to the student over the summer," John
son said. "We don't have enough time to get people up to
speed."
Although the success of Stanford's recruiting program is
impressive, Schneider expressed some regrets. "Students
always say that we'll be the first ones to know if they get a job,"
she said, "but once they get it, they usually don't come back
and tell us. They just move on."
