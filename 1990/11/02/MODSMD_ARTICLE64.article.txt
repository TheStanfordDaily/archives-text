# JOB Hunt
## The
						companies are searching, too 
### John Louie 
Students on the verge of receiving degrees often have
ambivalent feelings; while half are elated and relieved to
be finishing school, the other half are scared about enter
ing "the real world." To many seniors, the words "job search"
are enough to want to remain in school â€” indefinitely.
But many Stanford students are unaware that the employ
ers are often the ones doing the searching. Recruitment direc
tors, representing more than 500 companies and organizations
from across the nation, visit campus during each school year.
By utilizing channels offered by the Career Planning and
Placement Center, students can access these employment
opportunities, which range from summer internships to per
manent positions.
The On-Campus Recruiting System, a program operated by
the CPPC, provides opportunities for students to interview
with recruiting agents during the school year. Although many
of the participating employers are large companies, the pro
gram offers positions in a wide variety of fields, including pub
lic service, consulting, investment banking, education, commu
nications, international affairs and summer camps.
Companies which hire many Stanford students each year
include Hewlett Packard, IBM and Bank of America.
According to Ruth Schneider, director of the CPPC, the
recruitment program is used by about 1,000 Stanford students
each year. "The [program] is primarily utilized by those about
to receive a degree at the bachelor and masters levels," Schnei
der said.
The recruiting program uses two systems for scheduling
interviews with recruitment officials. For opportunities involv
ing technical skills and selected public service positions, inter
views are scheduled using a "first-come, first-served" basis.
"The supply and demand for technical positions is fairly well
balanced," Schneider said. "Most students searching for a tech

nical spot will be able to find a place."
For liberal arts positions, however, scheduling interviews is
a much more competitive process. The program uses a bidding
system for employers interested in non-technical positions. In
the bidding system, students are allocated a specific amount of
points at the beginning of each quarter, and must "bid" for
interview opportunities by distributing his or her points.
"This causes students to make some choices," Schneider
said, "and to look into types of employment." Before converting
to this system, students would camp in White Plaza in order to
sign up for interviews with popular companies. Because of the
high demand and competition for these opportunities, Schnei
der believes that the bidding system "makes things more equi
table."
Although competition for specific opportunities may be dif
ficult now, the number of participating companies and organi
zations increases each year. "On-campus recruiting is a very
expensive program for a company," Schneider said. "But while
many companies are cutting back on their visits, Stanford is
always on their list, and our recruitment program continues to
flourish."
