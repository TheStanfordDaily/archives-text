# Not ready for the REAL WORLD?
## Graduate school may be just the option you need 
### Tim Marklein 
For those first-quarter seniors who
are still brimming over their deci
sion to finally declare the previous
quarter, their joy should be restrained.
More important and more complex deci
sions lie ahead.
They include: get a job, go to graduate
school or just take a time out from life?
Which job, which graduate school, which
life? Where to live, how to live?
These decisions may take years to
answer for real, but one answer is sim
ple: Graduate school is an option for
those who want to continue the aca

demic studies or aren't quite convinced
that the job market is ready for them.
Once someone decides that graduate
school is in their immediate future,
though, there are still many questions to
answer. Law school, medical school,
business school or just plain graduate
school? Big college, small college, inex
pensive college? East coast, West coast or
somewhere in between?
These decisions also take time, but for
those seniors who haven't begun to deal
with real life yet, there is still time. The
testing and application process for most
schools (except medical schools) begins
in fall quarter of senior year, and even

later for those who want to take some
time off before going to graduate school.
The following overviews provide basic
information on the testing and applica
tion processes for the major school
groups.
Business school
Since business schools usually appre
ciate a combination of academic excel
lence and experience, most advisers sug
gest taking time off to work before
attending business school. The average
age of entering business school students
is 26, so testing out some jobs of interest
will help focus your intentions before
