# Not ready for the REAL WORLD?
## Graduate school may be just the option you need 
### Tim Marklein 
For those first-quarter seniors who
are still brimming over their deci
sion to finally declare the previous
quarter, their joy should be restrained.
More important and more complex deci
sions lie ahead.
They include: get a job, go to graduate
school or just take a time out from life?
Which job, which graduate school, which
life? Where to live, how to live?
These decisions may take years to
answer for real, but one answer is sim
ple: Graduate school is an option for
those who want to continue the aca

demic studies or aren't quite convinced
that the job market is ready for them.
Once someone decides that graduate
school is in their immediate future,
though, there are still many questions to
answer. Law school, medical school,
business school or just plain graduate
school? Big college, small college, inex
pensive college? East coast, West coast or
somewhere in between?
These decisions also take time, but for
those seniors who haven't begun to deal
with real life yet, there is still time. The
testing and application process for most
schools (except medical schools) begins
in fall quarter of senior year, and even

later for those who want to take some
time off before going to graduate school.
The following overviews provide basic
information on the testing and applica
tion processes for the major school
groups.
Business school
Since business schools usually appre
ciate a combination of academic excel
lence and experience, most advisers sug
gest taking time off to work before
attending business school. The average
age of entering business school students
is 26, so testing out some jobs of interest
will help focus your intentions before

attending business school.
Like most graduate schools, the appli
cation process should be completed
before winter break, including taking
the Graduate Management Admissions
Test (GMAT) — offered in October, Jan
uary, March and June. Other require
ments depend on the school.
Law school
According to the Undergraduate
Advising Center pamphlet "Is Law
School for Me," there are five good rea
sons for applying to law school:
• Someone you admire is a lawyer or
law school was important to their suc
cess;
• You have worked with a lawyer and
liked the work, intellectual challenge,
people and atmosphere;
• You have been involved with politics
or public service and think a law degree
would help you pursue careers in those
areas;
• You love school and want three more
years reading, researching and studying;
or
• People have always told you, "You'd
make a good lawyer."
Although some people enter law
school right after undergraduate com
mencement, the pamphlet's authors —
both Stanford Law School students —

choice. 'It's really

suggest taking time off before entering
law school.
"Right after you graduate from col
lege, you are probably the freest you'll
ever be," they note. "It's really depress
ing to see young people look longingly
out of the window, wishing they were
anywhere but law school."
The average age in first-year law
classes nationwide is 24, and most stu
dents have an easier time getting
accepted after gaining some experience
— law-related or otherwise.
The application process for law school
is a three-step process: take the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT), get fac
ulty and other recommendations, and
decide where to apply and get applica
tions in early. Personal statements are
also an important factor in the admis
sions process.
Most applicants take the LSAT in
early October, but other test dates
include June, December and February.
Unfortunately, the June date usually
falls near spring finals time, and the
February date comes too late to use for
the fall admissions date.
A final note about LSATs: The test
and scoring are slated for overhaul for
the 1991-92 testing dates, and the cur
rent test is rumored to be more favorable
for those who expect to score high.
Three recommendations are usually
adequate for most applications, which
are due at varying dates. However,
applying before Thanksgiving is an
excellent way to get a jump on other
applicants, before Christmas is average
and after Christmas is late.
Applying is made easier by a special
standardized application created by the
Law School Admission Service. The
application is accepted by many schools.
Mcdical school
Medical school applicants need the
biggest head start of any students, since
Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)
dates fall in April and September or
October. Also, medical schools have spe
cial course requirements that are fol
lowed more closely than for other gradu
ate schools.
Preparation for medical school
includes the following basic require
ments: two years inorganic and organic
chemistry with labwork; one year biol
ogy with labwork; one year physics with
labwork; one year English; and two or
three quarters calculus.
Since students are urged to take most
of the mentioned science requirements
before the MCAT, coursework must be
planned and finished early, unless stu
dents plan to take a year off between

undergraduate and graduate school.
Advising center brochures note that tak
ing time off is "often a healthy alterna
tive and allows student much more flex
ibility in scheduling their premedical
courses over their full four years at
Stanford."
Although the MCATs are offered fall
quarter senior year, the delay in schools
receiving scores may mean that their
entering class has already been filled
before your application can be consid
ered.
The MCAT tests specific science
knowledge and its application in prob
lem solving. Lasting a full day, the test is
divided into four sections: Science
Knowledge, Science Problems, Skills
Analysis: Reading and Skills Analysis:
Quantitative.
The first section has three indepen
dent subsections in biology, chemistry
and physics. The three subsections test
introductory level information in these
sciences, so studying advanced work or
courses will not be as useful as mastery
of introductory work.
As with law school, the application
process is simplified by the American
Medical College Application Service
(AMCAS) application packets, which
should be submitted mid-summer a year
before expected enrollment. The
AM CAS application is accepted by the
majority of U.S. medical schools.
Again, letters of recommendation and
personal statements are important, as
well as the interview at most medical
schools. Usually, you will meet with a
faculty member and student at the
school, and the interview will serve as a
good opportunity to ask remaining ques
tions and impress upon the school your
personal traits. With a two-to-one ratio
between applicants and spaces in medi
cal school, the interview can be very
important in proving your worth.
Other graduate schools
Application and testing procedures
vary greatly depending on what other
graduate school you are applying to, but
some general information should be
helpful.
Most reassuring, according to Harold
Doughty's "Guide to American Gradu
ate Schools," is that "most college grad
uates can gain admission to some gradu
ate school somewhere in the section of
the country they prefer." That may not
be true for some specialized fields or the
more elite universities, but general grad
uate school admission is less competitive
than that for business, law or medical
school.

One guide assures that
'most college gradu
ates can gain admis
sion to some graduate
school somewhere in
the section of the
country they prefer.'
The admission process
is generally less com
petitive than that for
professional schools.

The examinations most commonly
used for graduate admissions are the
Graduate Record Examination (GRE —
offered in October, December, February,
April and June), the Miller Analogies
Test (MAT), and the GMAT. Individual
departments or schools may require
additional or separate tests, but the GRE
tests both basic knowledge and specific
knowledge in one of 23 fields of graduate
study.
The application process usually
includes letters of recommendation and
applications, most of which are due in
early winter. However, students are
urged to inquire about admission and
financial aid at least one year in advance
of anticipated enrollment.
Once you have applied and tested for
the appropriate graduate schools, the
final selection remains: which one to
attend?
Many factors should enter into your
decision, but some general characteris
tics to consider include: cost, size, loca
tion, faculty, facilities, student body and
reputation.
As with most decisions, the prioritiza
tion of these and other factors will vary
with the individual.

undergraduate and graduate school.
Advising center brochures note that tak
ing time off is "often a healthy alterna
tive and allows student much more flex
ibility in scheduling their premedical
courses over their full four years at
Stanford."
Although the MCATs are offered fall
quarter senior year, the delay in schools
receiving scores may mean that their
entering class has already been filled
before your application can be consid
ered.
The MCAT tests specific science
knowledge and its application in prob
lem solving. Lasting a full day, the test is
divided into four sections: Science
Knowledge, Science Problems, Skills
Analysis: Reading and Skills Analysis:
Quantitative.
The first section has three indepen

and physics. The three subsections test
introductory level information in these
sciences, so studying advanced work or
courses will not be as useful as mastery
of introductory work.
As with law school, the application
process is simplified by the American
Medical College Application Service
(AMCAS) application packets, which
should be submitted mid-summer a year
before expected enrollment. The
AM CAS application is accepted by the
majority of U.S. medical schools.
Again, letters of recommendation and
personal statements are important, as
well as the interview at most medical
schools. Usually, you will meet with a
faculty member and student at the
school, and the interview will serve as a
good opportunity to ask remaining ques

personal traits. With a two-to-one ratio
between applicants and spaces in medi
cal school, the interview can be very
important in proving your worth.
Other graduate schools
Application and testing procedures
vary greatly depending on what other
graduate school you are applying to, but
some general information should be
helpful.
Most reassuring, according to Harold
Doughty's "Guide to American Gradu
ate Schools," is that "most college grad
uates can gain admission to some gradu
ate school somewhere in the section of
the country they prefer." That may not
be true for some specialized fields or the
more elite universities, but general grad
uate school admission is less competitive
than that for business, law or medical
school.

One guide assures that
'most college gradu
ates can gain admis
sion to some graduate
school somewhere in
the section of the
country they prefer.'
The admission process
is generally less com
petitive than that for
professional schools.

The examinations most commonly
used for graduate admissions are the
Graduate Record Examination (GRE —
offered in October, December, February,
April and June), the Miller Analogies
Test (MAT), and the GMAT. Individual
departments or schools may require
additional or separate tests, but the GRE
tests both basic knowledge and specific
knowledge in one of 23 fields of graduate
study.
The application process usually
includes letters of recommendation and
applications, most of which are due in
early winter. However, students are
urged to inquire about admission and
financial aid at least one year in advance
of anticipated enrollment.
Once you have applied and tested for
the appropriate graduate schools, the
final selection remains: which one to
attend?
Many factors should enter into your
decision, but some general characteris
tics to consider include: cost, size, loca
tion, faculty, facilities, student body and
reputation.
As with most decisions, the prioritiza
tion of these and other factors will vary
with the individual.

More important and more complex deci

They include: get a job, go to graduate
school or just take a time out from life?
Which job, which graduate school, which
life? Where to live, how to live?
These decisions may take years to
answer for real, but one answer is sim
ple: Graduate school is an option for
those who want to continue the aca

demic studies or aren't quite convinced
that the job market is ready for them.
Once someone decides that graduate
school is in their immediate future,
though, there are still many questions to
answer. Law school, medical school,
business school or just plain graduate
school? Big college, small college, inex
pensive college? East coast, West coast or
somewhere in between?
These decisions also take time, but for
those seniors who haven't begun to deal
with real life yet, there is still time. The
testing and application process for most
schools (except medical schools) begins
in fall quarter of senior year, and even

later for those who want to take some
time off before going to graduate school.
The following overviews provide basic
information on the testing and applica
tion processes for the major school
groups.
Business school
Since business schools usually appre
ciate a combination of academic excel
lence and experience, most advisers sug

attending business school. The average
age of entering business school students
is 26, so testing out some jobs of interest

Like most graduate schools, the appli

before winter break, including taking
the Graduate Management Admissions
Test (GMAT) — offered in October, Jan

Law school
According to the Undergraduate
Advising Center pamphlet "Is Law
School for Me," there are five good rea
sons for applying to law school:
• Someone you admire is a lawyer or
law school was important to their suc
cess;
• You have worked with a lawyer and
liked the work, intellectual challenge,
people and atmosphere;
• You have been involved with politics
or public service and think a law degree
would help you pursue careers in those
areas;
• You love school and want three more
years reading, researching and studying;
or
• People have always told you, "You'd
make a good lawyer."
Although some people enter law
school right after undergraduate com
mencement, the pamphlet's authors —
both Stanford Law School students —

"Right after you graduate from col
lege, you are probably the freest you'll
ever be," they note. "It's really depress
ing to see young people look longingly
out of the window, wishing they were
anywhere but law school."
The average age in first-year law
classes nationwide is 24, and most stu
dents have an easier time getting
accepted after gaining some experience
— law-related or otherwise.
The application process for law school
is a three-step process: take the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT), get fac
ulty and other recommendations, and
decide where to apply and get applica
tions in early. Personal statements are
also an important factor in the admis
sions process.
Most applicants take the LSAT in
early October, but other test dates
include June, December and February.
Unfortunately, the June date usually
falls near spring finals time, and the
February date comes too late to use for
the fall admissions date.
A final note about LSATs: The test
and scoring are slated for overhaul for
the 1991-92 testing dates, and the cur
rent test is rumored to be more favorable
for those who expect to score high.
Three recommendations are usually
adequate for most applications, which
are due at varying dates. However,
applying before Thanksgiving is an
excellent way to get a jump on other
applicants, before Christmas is average
and after Christmas is late.
Applying is made easier by a special
standardized application created by the
Law School Admission Service. The
application is accepted by many schools.

These decisions may take years to
answer for real, but one answer is sim
ple: Graduate school is an option for
those who want to continue the aca

demic studies or aren't quite convinced
that the job market is ready for them.
Once someone decides that graduate
school is in their immediate future,
though, there are still many questions to
answer. Law school, medical school,
business school or just plain graduate
school? Big college, small college, inex
pensive college? East coast, West coast or
somewhere in between?
These decisions also take time, but for
those seniors who haven't begun to deal
with real life yet, there is still time. The
testing and application process for most
schools (except medical schools) begins
in fall quarter of senior year, and even

later for those who want to take some
time off before going to graduate school.
The following overviews provide basic
information on the testing and applica
tion processes for the major school
groups.
Business school
Since business schools usually appre
ciate a combination of academic excel
lence and experience, most advisers sug
gest taking time off to work before
attending business school. The average
age of entering business school students

attending business school.
Like most graduate schools, the appli
cation process should be completed
before winter break, including taking
the Graduate Management Admissions
Test (GMAT) — offered in October, Jan
uary, March and June. Other require
ments depend on the school.
Law school
According to the Undergraduate
Advising Center pamphlet "Is Law
School for Me," there are five good rea
sons for applying to law school:
• Someone you admire is a lawyer or
law school was important to their suc
cess;
• You have worked with a lawyer and
liked the work, intellectual challenge,
people and atmosphere;
• You have been involved with politics
or public service and think a law degree
would help you pursue careers in those
areas;
• You love school and want three more
years reading, researching and studying;
or
• People have always told you, "You'd
make a good lawyer."
Although some people enter law
school right after undergraduate com
mencement, the pamphlet's authors —
both Stanford Law School students —

Taking time off before

choice. 'It's really

suggest taking time off before entering
law school.
"Right after you graduate from col
lege, you are probably the freest you'll
ever be," they note. "It's really depress
ing to see young people look longingly
out of the window, wishing they were
anywhere but law school."
The average age in first-year law
classes nationwide is 24, and most stu
dents have an easier time getting
accepted after gaining some experience
— law-related or otherwise.
The application process for law school
is a three-step process: take the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT), get fac
ulty and other recommendations, and
decide where to apply and get applica
tions in early. Personal statements are
also an important factor in the admis
sions process.
Most applicants take the LSAT in
early October, but other test dates
include June, December and February.
Unfortunately, the June date usually
falls near spring finals time, and the
February date comes too late to use for
the fall admissions date.
A final note about LSATs: The test
and scoring are slated for overhaul for
the 1991-92 testing dates, and the cur
rent test is rumored to be more favorable
for those who expect to score high.
Three recommendations are usually
adequate for most applications, which
are due at varying dates. However,
applying before Thanksgiving is an
excellent way to get a jump on other
applicants, before Christmas is average
and after Christmas is late.
Applying is made easier by a special
standardized application created by the
Law School Admission Service. The
application is accepted by many schools.
Mcdical school
Medical school applicants need the
biggest head start of any students, since

dates fall in April and September or
October. Also, medical schools have spe
cial course requirements that are fol
lowed more closely than for other gradu
ate schools.
Preparation for medical school
includes the following basic require
ments: two years inorganic and organic
chemistry with labwork; one year biol
ogy with labwork; one year physics with
labwork; one year English; and two or
three quarters calculus.
Since students are urged to take most
of the mentioned science requirements
before the MCAT, coursework must be
planned and finished early, unless stu
dents plan to take a year off between

undergraduate and graduate school.
Advising center brochures note that tak
ing time off is "often a healthy alterna
tive and allows student much more flex
ibility in scheduling their premedical
courses over their full four years at
Stanford."
Although the MCATs are offered fall
quarter senior year, the delay in schools
receiving scores may mean that their
entering class has already been filled
before your application can be consid
ered.
The MCAT tests specific science
knowledge and its application in prob
lem solving. Lasting a full day, the test is
divided into four sections: Science
Knowledge, Science Problems, Skills
Analysis: Reading and Skills Analysis:
Quantitative.
The first section has three indepen
dent subsections in biology, chemistry
and physics. The three subsections test
introductory level information in these
sciences, so studying advanced work or
courses will not be as useful as mastery
of introductory work.
As with law school, the application
process is simplified by the American
Medical College Application Service
(AMCAS) application packets, which
should be submitted mid-summer a year
before expected enrollment. The
AM CAS application is accepted by the
majority of U.S. medical schools.
Again, letters of recommendation and
personal statements are important, as
well as the interview at most medical
schools. Usually, you will meet with a
faculty member and student at the
school, and the interview will serve as a
good opportunity to ask remaining ques
tions and impress upon the school your
personal traits. With a two-to-one ratio
between applicants and spaces in medi
cal school, the interview can be very
important in proving your worth.
Other graduate schools
Application and testing procedures
vary greatly depending on what other
graduate school you are applying to, but
some general information should be
helpful.
Most reassuring, according to Harold
Doughty's "Guide to American Gradu
ate Schools," is that "most college grad
uates can gain admission to some gradu
ate school somewhere in the section of
the country they prefer." That may not
be true for some specialized fields or the
more elite universities, but general grad
uate school admission is less competitive
than that for business, law or medical
school.

One guide assures that
'most college gradu
ates can gain admis
sion to some graduate
school somewhere in
the section of the
country they prefer.'
The admission process
is generally less com
petitive than that for
professional schools.

The examinations most commonly
used for graduate admissions are the
Graduate Record Examination (GRE —
offered in October, December, February,
April and June), the Miller Analogies
Test (MAT), and the GMAT. Individual
departments or schools may require
additional or separate tests, but the GRE
tests both basic knowledge and specific
knowledge in one of 23 fields of graduate
study.
The application process usually
includes letters of recommendation and
applications, most of which are due in
early winter. However, students are
urged to inquire about admission and
financial aid at least one year in advance
of anticipated enrollment.
Once you have applied and tested for
the appropriate graduate schools, the
final selection remains: which one to
attend?
Many factors should enter into your
decision, but some general characteris
tics to consider include: cost, size, loca
tion, faculty, facilities, student body and
reputation.
As with most decisions, the prioritiza
tion of these and other factors will vary
with the individual.
