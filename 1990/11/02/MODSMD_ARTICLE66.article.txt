# Serve yourself, others
## Public service lets people do what they love 
### Jonathan Eisenberg 
Since 1985, University President
Donald Kennedy has been leading
an effort to encourage more under
graduates to pursue careers in public
service.
Currently, the University keeps no
data about the success of this effort —
the rate at which graduates choose
careers in the public sector.
However, Anne Greenblatt, the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter's public service careers specialist,
reports that each year the waiting list of
students requesting appointments with
her has grown.
To serve these students in their
search for "hidden" jobs, the CPPC
offers a variety of resources, including:
• Individual counseling sessions with
Greenblatt, which include several
dimensions of the career decision-mak
ing process, such as self-assessment,
researching opportunities, building net
works, interviewing, designing job
search strategies and creating resumes;
• Workshops on topics such as "Tar
geting the Hidden Job Market in Public
Service" and groups such as the "Job
Search Support Group;"
• The "Public Service Career Faire,"
held each spring, at which representa
tives from non-profit and public organi
zations meet and recruit students;
• Public service panels of three or four
people discussing their careers in areas
ranging from civil rights to health to the
government;
• A public service database of infor
mation about more than 1,000 organiza
tions world-wide;
• The "Rainbow File," which contains
brochures and publications of selected
organizations and fellowship programs,
color-coded by subject; and
• More than 150 public service career
advisers, who are Stanford alumni work
ing in public service, who provide advice
and contacts to undergraduates. Alumni
in the private sector are available to
advise students about the "social respon
sibility" of potential employers.

Greenblatt explains that public ser
vice jobs exist in abundance at small
organizations, but lack of resources
often prevents the organizations from
launching highly visible recruiting
efforts. Jobs thus remain "hidden"
unless students specifically search for
them.
One visible opportunity for graduat
ing seniors are the John Gardner Public
Service fellowships, administered by
Stanford's Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and UC-Berkeley. These fellowships
provide three graduates from each
school with $15,000 for 11-month
internships in public policy areas of their
choice.
Pete Sidebottom, a former assistant
director of government relations for
Stanford, earned a 1985-86 Gardner fel
lowship. He chose to spend the year as
an assistant to then-San Antonio Mayor
Henry Cisneros.
"You couldn't have dreamed of any
thing better," Sidebottom recalls. His
tasks varied from day to day and
included escorting a Japanese trade dele
gation, directing relief supplies to vic
tims of the Mexico City earthquake and
arranging the visits of Prince Charles of
Wales and then-Vice President Bush to
San Antonio.
Although he doesn't consider the fel
lowship to have been a stepping stone to
other jobs, Sidebottom values it because

he says it allowed him to assume respon
sibilities comparable to those of someone
with five to 10 years of experience in the
private sector work force.
Sidebottom now works as a manage
ment consultant.
Assoc. Director of the Haas Center for
Public Service Tim Stanton, who has
worked in both the public and private
sectors, asserts that job skills acquired in
one sector can be easily transferred to
the other. "The issues and politics are
more the same than different" between
the two sectors, he says.
But often, there is a great difference
in salary between public and private sec
tor jobs. The low pay characteristic of
public service work, exemplified by the

board at the Haas Public Service Center.
Gardner fellowships, didn't phase Side
bottom.
He argues that people can live rea
sonably comfortably on smaller salaries
than the average electrical engineering
major expects upon graduation — often
more than $30,000 per year.
Besides, "How many times in your life
is someone going to pay for you to work
with whomever you want to in the coun
try?" he asks.
Actually, the perks of the fellowship
helped bridged the gap between public
and private sector salaries. Sidebottom
received free dinners, travel and an
expense account.
Thus, in many cases, the financial dis
incentives to performing public service
simply represent "mental disincentives"
to Sidebottom. If people in public-sector
careers know the quality of their work
compares to that of people in private-sec
tor careers, it may depress them to real
ize they don't receive comparable com
pensation, he suggests.
Of course, Sidebottom recalls some
friends who passed up chances at Gard
ner fellowships because of financial con
straints .
When he went to graduate school
after the fellowship, Sidebottom had to
take out larger loans than other students
who had earned more money. Still, he
managed to pay for his education.
Sidebottom's path — graduating, per
forming public service for a few years
and then returning to for a graduate
degree — is a well-traveled one, accord
ing to Stanton.
At Haas, Stanton has noticed two
other paths: one of students involved in
service at Stanford who intend to stay in
the public sector for the rest of their lives
and another of students who plan to
enter the private sector upon gradua
tion.
Another trend in public service is a
higher participation rate by women than
by men. Campus Compact, a national
coalition of colleges dedicated to foster
ing community service, which Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy chairs,
found the ratio to be about three women
to two men in a survey of 176 colleges.
Stanton explains the skew in sociolog
ical terms: since women usually earn less
money than men anyway, the small com
pensation offered by public service
option seem less of a disincentive to
them.
As women struggle for equality
throughout the work force, the skew in
public service jobs may correspondingly
equalize, Stanton says.
Nevertheless, many people at Stan
ford and beyond hope more women and
men engage in public service, whether as
careers or volunteers. It often allows
them "to do something they love," says
Sidebottom.

Since 1985, University President
Donald Kennedy has been leading
an effort to encourage more under
graduates to pursue careers in public
service.
Currently, the University keeps no
data about the success of this effort —
the rate at which graduates choose
careers in the public sector.
However, Anne Greenblatt, the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter's public service careers specialist,
reports that each year the waiting list of
students requesting appointments with
her has grown.
To serve these students in their
search for "hidden" jobs, the CPPC
offers a variety of resources, including:
• Individual counseling sessions with
Greenblatt, which include several
dimensions of the career decision-mak
ing process, such as self-assessment,
researching opportunities, building net
works, interviewing, designing job
search strategies and creating resumes;
• Workshops on topics such as "Tar
geting the Hidden Job Market in Public
Service" and groups such as the "Job
Search Support Group;"
• The "Public Service Career Faire,"
held each spring, at which representa
tives from non-profit and public organi
zations meet and recruit students;
• Public service panels of three or four
people discussing their careers in areas
ranging from civil rights to health to the
government;
• A public service database of infor
mation about more than 1,000 organiza
tions world-wide;
• The "Rainbow File," which contains
brochures and publications of selected
organizations and fellowship programs,
color-coded by subject; and
• More than 150 public service career
advisers, who are Stanford alumni work
ing in public service, who provide advice
and contacts to undergraduates. Alumni
in the private sector are available to
advise students about the "social respon
sibility" of potential employers.

Greenblatt explains that public ser
vice jobs exist in abundance at small
organizations, but lack of resources
often prevents the organizations from
launching highly visible recruiting
efforts. Jobs thus remain "hidden"
unless students specifically search for
them.
One visible opportunity for graduat
ing seniors are the John Gardner Public
Service fellowships, administered by
Stanford's Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and UC-Berkeley. These fellowships
provide three graduates from each
school with $15,000 for 11-month
internships in public policy areas of their
choice.
Pete Sidebottom, a former assistant
director of government relations for
Stanford, earned a 1985-86 Gardner fel
lowship. He chose to spend the year as
an assistant to then-San Antonio Mayor
Henry Cisneros.
"You couldn't have dreamed of any
thing better," Sidebottom recalls. His
tasks varied from day to day and
included escorting a Japanese trade dele
gation, directing relief supplies to vic
tims of the Mexico City earthquake and
arranging the visits of Prince Charles of
Wales and then-Vice President Bush to
San Antonio.
Although he doesn't consider the fel
lowship to have been a stepping stone to
other jobs, Sidebottom values it because

he says it allowed him to assume respon
sibilities comparable to those of someone
with five to 10 years of experience in the
private sector work force.
Sidebottom now works as a manage
ment consultant.
Assoc. Director of the Haas Center for
Public Service Tim Stanton, who has
worked in both the public and private
sectors, asserts that job skills acquired in
one sector can be easily transferred to
the other. "The issues and politics are
more the same than different" between
the two sectors, he says.
But often, there is a great difference
in salary between public and private sec
tor jobs. The low pay characteristic of
public service work, exemplified by the

board at the Haas Public Service Center.
Gardner fellowships, didn't phase Side
bottom.
He argues that people can live rea
sonably comfortably on smaller salaries
than the average electrical engineering
major expects upon graduation — often
more than $30,000 per year.
Besides, "How many times in your life
is someone going to pay for you to work
with whomever you want to in the coun
try?" he asks.
Actually, the perks of the fellowship
helped bridged the gap between public
and private sector salaries. Sidebottom
received free dinners, travel and an
expense account.
Thus, in many cases, the financial dis
incentives to performing public service
simply represent "mental disincentives"
to Sidebottom. If people in public-sector
careers know the quality of their work
compares to that of people in private-sec
tor careers, it may depress them to real
ize they don't receive comparable com
pensation, he suggests.
Of course, Sidebottom recalls some
friends who passed up chances at Gard
ner fellowships because of financial con
straints .
When he went to graduate school
after the fellowship, Sidebottom had to
take out larger loans than other students
who had earned more money. Still, he
managed to pay for his education.
Sidebottom's path — graduating, per
forming public service for a few years
and then returning to for a graduate
degree — is a well-traveled one, accord
ing to Stanton.
At Haas, Stanton has noticed two
other paths: one of students involved in
service at Stanford who intend to stay in
the public sector for the rest of their lives
and another of students who plan to
enter the private sector upon gradua
tion.
Another trend in public service is a
higher participation rate by women than
by men. Campus Compact, a national
coalition of colleges dedicated to foster
ing community service, which Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy chairs,
found the ratio to be about three women
to two men in a survey of 176 colleges.
Stanton explains the skew in sociolog
ical terms: since women usually earn less
money than men anyway, the small com
pensation offered by public service
option seem less of a disincentive to
them.
As women struggle for equality
throughout the work force, the skew in
public service jobs may correspondingly
equalize, Stanton says.
Nevertheless, many people at Stan
ford and beyond hope more women and
men engage in public service, whether as
careers or volunteers. It often allows
them "to do something they love," says
Sidebottom.
