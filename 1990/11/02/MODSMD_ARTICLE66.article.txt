# Serve yourself, others
## Public service lets people do what they love 
### Jonathan Eisenberg 
Since 1985, University President
Donald Kennedy has been leading
an effort to encourage more under
graduates to pursue careers in public
service.
Currently, the University keeps no
data about the success of this effort —
the rate at which graduates choose
careers in the public sector.
However, Anne Greenblatt, the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter's public service careers specialist,
reports that each year the waiting list of
students requesting appointments with
her has grown.
To serve these students in their
search for "hidden" jobs, the CPPC
offers a variety of resources, including:
• Individual counseling sessions with
Greenblatt, which include several
dimensions of the career decision-mak
ing process, such as self-assessment,
researching opportunities, building net
works, interviewing, designing job
search strategies and creating resumes;
• Workshops on topics such as "Tar
geting the Hidden Job Market in Public
Service" and groups such as the "Job
Search Support Group;"
• The "Public Service Career Faire,"
held each spring, at which representa
tives from non-profit and public organi
zations meet and recruit students;
• Public service panels of three or four
people discussing their careers in areas
ranging from civil rights to health to the
government;
• A public service database of infor
mation about more than 1,000 organiza
tions world-wide;
• The "Rainbow File," which contains
brochures and publications of selected
organizations and fellowship programs,
color-coded by subject; and
• More than 150 public service career
advisers, who are Stanford alumni work
ing in public service, who provide advice
and contacts to undergraduates. Alumni
in the private sector are available to
advise students about the "social respon
sibility" of potential employers.

Greenblatt explains that public ser
vice jobs exist in abundance at small
organizations, but lack of resources
often prevents the organizations from
launching highly visible recruiting
efforts. Jobs thus remain "hidden"
unless students specifically search for
them.
One visible opportunity for graduat
ing seniors are the John Gardner Public
Service fellowships, administered by
Stanford's Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and UC-Berkeley. These fellowships
provide three graduates from each
school with $15,000 for 11-month
internships in public policy areas of their
choice.
Pete Sidebottom, a former assistant
director of government relations for
Stanford, earned a 1985-86 Gardner fel
lowship. He chose to spend the year as
an assistant to then-San Antonio Mayor
Henry Cisneros.
"You couldn't have dreamed of any
thing better," Sidebottom recalls. His
tasks varied from day to day and
included escorting a Japanese trade dele
gation, directing relief supplies to vic
tims of the Mexico City earthquake and
arranging the visits of Prince Charles of
Wales and then-Vice President Bush to
San Antonio.
Although he doesn't consider the fel
lowship to have been a stepping stone to
other jobs, Sidebottom values it because

he says it allowed him to assume respon
sibilities comparable to those of someone
with five to 10 years of experience in the
private sector work force.
Sidebottom now works as a manage
ment consultant.
Assoc. Director of the Haas Center for
Public Service Tim Stanton, who has
worked in both the public and private
sectors, asserts that job skills acquired in
one sector can be easily transferred to
the other. "The issues and politics are
more the same than different" between
the two sectors, he says.
But often, there is a great difference
in salary between public and private sec
tor jobs. The low pay characteristic of
public service work, exemplified by the
