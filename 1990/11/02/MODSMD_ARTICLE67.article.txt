# What to do when you don't know what to do
## 
### June Cohen 
You're going home for break again, but this time you're
prepared. Having spent several years floundering in the
sea of Stanford academia, dodging hate mail from the
Registrar's office and taking every introductory course offered
by the University, you've finally declared your major.
So now, when your parents proudly introduce you to their
friends as "our-daughter-who-goes-to-Stanford," you can fend
off the usual question quickly and confidently.
The moment of truth arrives. You stand poised while meet
ing your parents acquaintances. Then they ask the question:
"So, what do you want to do after graduation?"
Your jaw drops, your countenance falls and just when you
thought you had everything all figured out, you suddenly find
yourself responding, "I don't know," once again.
It seems like from the moment you enter college (and even
before), people expect you to have your entire life worked out.
An integral part of the college experience is spent dodging
questions like "What are you interested in?" and "What exactly

do you expect to do with a degree in anthropology?"
Although no one can be expected to know exactly what they
want to do for the rest of their life (since it probably isn't pos
sible anyway), sooner or later you're going to graduate and
you're going to have to confront these questions, ifyou're going
to find a career and lifestyle that makes you happy
The first step toward such self-realization is to "determine
who you are, what you want and what's important to you,"
says Virginia Mak of the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter. Unfortunately, these questions aren't always easy to
answer.
"Sometimes you know what you hate, but you don't know
what you like," says Mak, who is a career counselor at the cen
ter. "We can help you begin to articulate what you like and
what you are looking for.
"Some people feel they need to know all the answers before
they come in, but if that were the case, our jobs wouldn't exist.
. . . It's easy to feel intimidated by the center before you come
in, but we're here to reduce anxiety, not cause it," said Mak.
Certainly the idea of choosing a career is intimidating.

Growing up is scary. Being an adult is scary. And once you
choose a job, it all seems so final.
But it doesn't have to be that way. One of the greatest mis
conceptions students have is that the first job you get after col
lege is the job you'll keep for the rest of your life. Rarely is this
the case. Especially in today's dynamic and mobile society, peo
ple frequently change residences, jobs and even careers. Your
first decision isn't your final decision.
The direction you choose after school is only the beginning
of a lifelong process, according to Mak. People are constantly
reevaluating their lives and their happiness, and what seems
like an ideal situation now may no longer fit after a few years,
no matter how sure you are that it will.
And no one proves this better than Mak, who, after chang
ing jobs seven or eight times, is well qualified to advise others
with the wisdom she has gained in the process.
Although graduating seniors make up the bulk of those who
seek career counseling, Stanford students and alumni visit the
center at all stages of their academic and professional lives
searching for direction. The center schedules an average of

5,400 appointments each year with individuals ranging from
first year undergraduates to post-doctoral students to alumni.
Last year, the wait to see one of the center's 10 counselors
was three weeks. This year, however, budget cuts have forced
the center to reduce its number of counselors to nine, and
within a few months, eight. This cutback will put more pres
sure on the counselors, as each tries to compensate by seeing
more students. To ameliorate the situation, the center is now
offering group workshops to focus students on personal issues
before they come in for individual consultation.
Along with counseling, the center also offers a wide range of
employment resources, including binders filled with job
descriptions, openings for summer jobs and internships and
lists of career opportunities in different fields and with various
employers.
Once you have an idea of what you'd like to do, the center
can also help you find a job. Most people, according to Mak,
have erroneous ideas about how to seek employment; they
think that on-campus recruiting and want-ads are the primary
means of finding employment. In fact, only 20 percent of work-

ing people find their jobs this way.
The remaining 80 percent find
employment by word of mouth. Net
working is a very powerful means of con
tacting influential people and improving
your chances of getting a good job. And
the center can point you in the right
direction for making such connections.
The Alumni Contact List, a directory of
Stanford graduates, is located in the
center, and Mak recommends that stu
dents take advantage of it to talk to peo
ple pursuing careers in their field of
interest.
"Books can only tell you so much,"
says Mak. "They're flat and two-dimen
sional. But people in the field know the
culture of the workplace; they can tell
you what it's like . . . and who moves
up."
Other opportunities for networking
include speaking with professors,
friends and fraternity and sorority
alumni or getting involved with campus
groups such as Stanford-In-Govern
ment which have frequent contact with
professionals outside the University.
On-campus recruiting, however, is
another viable and convenient method
of career placement which is facilitated
by the center. A Career Faire is held each

fall, bringing more than a hundred
recruiters to Stanford.
Quite often, however, graduates
choose not to seek employment immedi
ately after college. Many stay on in
school, "entering graduate programs to
kill time and hopefully be enlightened,"
according to Mak. And although some
pursue advanced degrees to satisfy their

intellectual curiosity, many do so to buy
time and put off hard decisions, as the
recent surge in law school applicants
seems to indicate.
For those graduates who are not pre
pared to enter the working force straight
out of college, opportunities outside of
academia do exist and may provide a
refreshing break from heavy workloads.

Travel is a very attractive common
post-graduation activity, and a popular
one as well. It may be difficult, after
starting a job, to find the time for exten
sive vacationing, so a trip to Europe or
Africa after finishing college may be
ideal, if you have the financial means to
do so.
Volunteer work and short-term
employment — both in this country and
abroad — are also viable options for
those who are uncertain of their future
plans or need a year or two off before
pursuing them.
Although frequently associated with
flower children and the '60s, the Peace
Corps has been attracting increasing
numbers of individuals over the past few
years, and is an option which combines
elements of both travel and volunteer
work.
While this "time off" between college
and"the real world" can be constructive
if it helps you decide what you want to
do, it will not make the inevitable ques
tion disappear. If you are going to derive
satisfaction and happiness from your
career, you're eventually going to have
to think about what you really want to
do — now that you're grown up.
