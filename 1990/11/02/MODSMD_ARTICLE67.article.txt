# What to do when you don't know what to do
## 
### June Cohen 
You're going home for break again, but this time you're
prepared. Having spent several years floundering in the
sea of Stanford academia, dodging hate mail from the
Registrar's office and taking every introductory course offered
by the University, you've finally declared your major.
So now, when your parents proudly introduce you to their
friends as "our-daughter-who-goes-to-Stanford," you can fend
off the usual question quickly and confidently.
The moment of truth arrives. You stand poised while meet
ing your parents acquaintances. Then they ask the question:
"So, what do you want to do after graduation?"
Your jaw drops, your countenance falls and just when you
thought you had everything all figured out, you suddenly find
yourself responding, "I don't know," once again.
It seems like from the moment you enter college (and even
before), people expect you to have your entire life worked out.
An integral part of the college experience is spent dodging
questions like "What are you interested in?" and "What exactly

do you expect to do with a degree in anthropology?"
Although no one can be expected to know exactly what they
want to do for the rest of their life (since it probably isn't pos
sible anyway), sooner or later you're going to graduate and
you're going to have to confront these questions, ifyou're going
to find a career and lifestyle that makes you happy
The first step toward such self-realization is to "determine
who you are, what you want and what's important to you,"
says Virginia Mak of the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter. Unfortunately, these questions aren't always easy to
answer.
"Sometimes you know what you hate, but you don't know
what you like," says Mak, who is a career counselor at the cen
ter. "We can help you begin to articulate what you like and
what you are looking for.
"Some people feel they need to know all the answers before
they come in, but if that were the case, our jobs wouldn't exist.
. . . It's easy to feel intimidated by the center before you come
in, but we're here to reduce anxiety, not cause it," said Mak.
Certainly the idea of choosing a career is intimidating.

Growing up is scary. Being an adult is scary. And once you
choose a job, it all seems so final.
But it doesn't have to be that way. One of the greatest mis
conceptions students have is that the first job you get after col
lege is the job you'll keep for the rest of your life. Rarely is this
the case. Especially in today's dynamic and mobile society, peo
ple frequently change residences, jobs and even careers. Your
first decision isn't your final decision.
The direction you choose after school is only the beginning
of a lifelong process, according to Mak. People are constantly
reevaluating their lives and their happiness, and what seems
like an ideal situation now may no longer fit after a few years,
no matter how sure you are that it will.
And no one proves this better than Mak, who, after chang
ing jobs seven or eight times, is well qualified to advise others
with the wisdom she has gained in the process.
Although graduating seniors make up the bulk of those who
seek career counseling, Stanford students and alumni visit the
center at all stages of their academic and professional lives
searching for direction. The center schedules an average of

5,400 appointments each year with individuals ranging from
first year undergraduates to post-doctoral students to alumni.
Last year, the wait to see one of the center's 10 counselors
was three weeks. This year, however, budget cuts have forced
the center to reduce its number of counselors to nine, and
within a few months, eight. This cutback will put more pres
sure on the counselors, as each tries to compensate by seeing
more students. To ameliorate the situation, the center is now
offering group workshops to focus students on personal issues
before they come in for individual consultation.
Along with counseling, the center also offers a wide range of
employment resources, including binders filled with job
descriptions, openings for summer jobs and internships and
lists of career opportunities in different fields and with various
employers.
Once you have an idea of what you'd like to do, the center
can also help you find a job. Most people, according to Mak,
have erroneous ideas about how to seek employment; they
think that on-campus recruiting and want-ads are the primary
means of finding employment. In fact, only 20 percent of work-
