# Race dedicated to former Theta
## 
### Jon Gifford 
For the members of Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority, this week
end's Thetaßreakers road race
is a special one. This year, the
spirit of former Theta Tracy
Ann Brune seems to guide the
sixth annual charity run.
The races, scheduled to begin
Sunday morning, will benefit
the Make-A-Wish Foundation of
Hayward instead of the tradi
tional charity. The proceeds will
be donated in honor of Brune, a
member of the sorority who died
in early September from
leukemia. Brune would have
been a senior this year.
According to Thetaßreakers
co-chair Michelle Kramer, the
sorority voted unanimously to
have proceeds benefit the Make-
A-Wish Foundation, in honor of
Brune. In past years, funds have
gone to the Commurity Associ
ated for the Retarded of Palo
Alto.
"I think this [decision to
change charities] has made this
year's event special because we
are doing it for [Brune],"
Kramer said. "She's the driving
force behind the whole project."
Brune was an active member
of the sorority and served as a

counselor at the Sierra Camp
the summer before her junior
year.
Brune was diagnosed with
leukemia in the summer before
her senior year of high school.
She completed her freshman
year at Stanford but was forced
to remain at home in Tulsa,
Oklahoma for the first quarter
of her sophomore year.
Brune received a bone mar
row transplant in March of this
year and was reportedly doing
well, but the illness recurred
this summer.
The decision to benefit Make-
A-Wish Foundation, was largely
based on the sorority's desire
"to make something positive
come out of (Brune's) illness,"
said Kramer. "We knew we
couldn't do anything to stop her
disease, but that we could do
something she would have been
happy about," said Kramer.
Make-A-Wish Foundation,
which grants "wishes" to termi
nally ill children between the
ages of two and 18, is funded
totally by community contribu
tions. According to Barry Fru
tato, the sorority's liaison at the
Foundation, sponsoring a single
wish requires on average about
$3,000.

In the past, the number of
entrants has averaged about
350 runners, generating more
than $2,500 in funds for local
charities. This year, however,
Kramer hopes to raise closer to
$3,000.
Thetas are considering spon
soring a 2 1/2 year-old leukemia
patient currently at the Stan
ford University Medical Center
whose wish is to go to Disney
land.
"From working on
Thetaßreakers and with the
Make-A-Wish Foundation, I've
come to see the real purpose
behind the money raised from
the event," Kramer said. "I
think the whole sorority has
come to look at life a little differ
ently as a result of this project."
Two races, a 5K fun-run and
a 10K road race, will wind
through Galvez St., Campus
Drive, Serra Street and Pampas
Lane, looping back to the finish
line at Angell Field. Each race
has a running and walking cat
egory.
Kramer's mqjor aim for the
event is "for people to have a
good time, while understanding
the cause for which they are
running."
