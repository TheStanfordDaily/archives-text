# Tunney prepared to tackle last home game

### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Jono Tunney always pictured
himself playing football at Stan
ford.
It's just turned out a little differ
ently than he imagined.
The fifth-year linebacker is a
Stanford legacy, and grew up
watching Cardinal football. When
it came time to make a choice
about collegiate football, there
was only one option.
"I was always going to Stan

ford," Tunney said. "My dad went
to school here and we've been
coming to games ever since I've
been six.
"I always saw the guys coming out
and I wanted to be one of them."
While Tunney redshirted his
freshman year, the Cardinal
chalked up an 8-4 season and a
berth in the Gator Bowl. His
childhood dream of playing on a
Stanford football team equal to
those of the 1970's was coming
true.
But that was to be the Cardi

nal's last winning season of his
career. The next year Stanford
slipped to 5-6, and the Mill Valley
native thought the world was
over. His sophomore and junior
seasons however, the Cardinal
posted consecutive three win sea
sons, and with the squad cur
rently at 2-6, his final year on the
Farm doesn't look any brighter.
Goals have had to be realigned,
and perspectives readjusted, but
all-in-all the childhood decision
has been worthwhile. Especially
at the personal level.

"Even in the end we don't
have as many wins as I'd like to
have, but there are certain things
I got here that I couldn't have got
ten anywhere else," Tunney said.
While the team performance
has not been up to his ideals, Tun
ney's individual progress has
developed quite nicely. His quick
ness, strength and hard hitting
have helped him become one of
the best among Cardinal defend
ers.

The inside linebacker is on
course to lead the team in tackles
for the third year in a row. He is
currently tied for tops on the team
with free safety Seyon Albert at
59. His 102 last year and 155 in
1988 were good for the team high
as well.
While still at the forefront, his
numbers have dropped off sub
stantially, however, due to a posi
tion change. Actually, more of a
position addition. The lifelong
inside backer has now added out
side duties to his resume.

For the first time in his career,
Tunney is seeing time at the out
side, and trying to pick up new
skills such as rushing the passer.
And though the position is trying
at times, Tunney is enjoying his
new defensive responsibilities.
"I feel I can play out there, I'm
just a little hesitant, I guess,"
Tunney said. "It seems like every

week we completely change our
defense around, so its kind of
tough.
"[But] it's kind of fun, actually,
learning a new position. You kind
of have that wide-eyed feeling.
They have me rushing the passer
now, and the three-point stance,
the whole thing. At inside backer
you know when you've screwed
up, you know when you haven't.

When you're playing outside its
almost like you don't know when
you've done something right or
something wrong."
Linebacker coordinators Dave
Tipton and Mike Tolleson decided
the team could use a boost on its
outside play in some situations, so
now they have four-year starter
Tunney switch from inside to out
side when specific defensive for
mations are used.
"Sometimes we put him in as

an outside linebacker to cover the
tight end and do some man cover
age situations. Sometimes he's
the one linebacker in the middle
when we play a one linebacker
defense," explained coach Denny
Green. "It requires us trying to
put the best players in the posi
tions that we can find. He's a good
athlete and he can run."
The switch has been a little
more difficult than he first imag
ined, but Tunney is picking up on
the skills, as well as the outside
mentality.

"It's kind of hard switching
(from inside to outside and
backer). I've been playing inside
since I've been small. It's all I'd
ever played." Tunney said. "The
hardest part is right when the
ball's snapped, what do you do? As
an inside backer I don't have to
think about it any more, it's just
habit.

"I basically rely on my speed to
get around, maybe cut inside and
catch them leaning once in a
while. As far as pass rush moves
go, which is what you have to
have, I don't have any. Theoreti
cally I know how to do them but I
just haven't got the practice."
But whether or not he has the

outside moves down perfectly,
Tunney has been having another
above-par season. He has two
quarterback sacks, two pass
deflections and five tackles to go
along with his team-leading total
in tackles.
"He's been solid. I don't think
anybody has had an All-America
kind of year on our defense, but
his play has been solid.," Green
said. "His effort has been good,
and I think he's been in there
playing as hard as he can."
His performance has been so
solid that there are some non-Car
dinal fans watching his every
move. Scouts have descended
upon Stanford contests to check

out Tunney's ability and poten
tial, to see if he had what it takes
to make the Sunday league.
In fact, making the NFL is
Tunney's major goal at this point.
"I'd like to continue playing next
year if I can. I don't think it's
unrealistic. I think I'll definitely
get my chance. It's what I do from
there."
And its not just a shot in the
dark. Cardinal coaches also give
Tunney a realistic chance of mak
ing the pros. "He has a good shot
(at the NFL) because of his
strength and his speed," Green
said.
But if it doesn't pan out, Tun
ney's life won't be over. At the
very least, Stanford football has
given him a realistic outlook on
football, and on life.
The childhood dreams were
worth while after all.
