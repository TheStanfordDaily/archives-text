that hurt.

Should I even go to the WSU
game?

Even for the flippant, unfaith
ful Stanford fan, the rapid descent
from national recognition has
been painful. But pleasure and
pain are experienced on a relative
scale, and, although some similar
ities exist between the 1960 and
the 1990 teams, compared to 30
years ago, Cardinal fans have to
feel fairly comfortable.
Under the guidance of "Cac
tus" Jack Curtis, Stanford strug
gled through the 1960 season to
post a 0-10 record, and students
were willing to express rather can
didly their feelings about the
squad.
According to alumnus Carole
Gledhill, the students, with the
men in white shirts and the
women in red skirts, were united
and enthusiastic about the team

despite its record. Now, Gledhill
feels the crowd comes only to
cheer and associate with Stanford
victories.

"It's not just the students
(now); the 'old farts' section sits
on their hands as well," Gledhill
said. "It make me mad with all of
the athletes trying so hard. . .
everybody (in the stands) seems so
apathetic."
However, 1952 graduate Ray
Haite disagrees that the students
have lost spirit.
"Stanford students have never
followed yell leaders," said Haite,
who has not missed a Stanford
game since 1958. "You're never
going to get Stanford students to
act like USC students."
Instead, Haite remembers a
more distasteful bite in the 1960
crowd. The students had no shin
ing moments to recall for the
entire season.
"It was as bad down there as it
could possibly get," he said. "Stu
dents threw the cards (in the
cheering section) and left the
game early."
Led by standout quarterback
Dick Norman, who later that year
broke the school record for total
career passing yardage with 3,737
yards, the Indians entered the

season with less than spectacular
expectations. The team had lost
most of its receiving corps to grad
uation and hoped at best to post
three or four wins. In addition,
the coaches had had a difficult
time pulling high quality players
to the Farm.
"We knew we were not going to
the Rose Bowl," Norman said.
"We had mediocre recruiting years
back-to-back and got caught short
on material."
Instead of gauging their perfor
mance by close losses against the
national powers as the present
Cardinal squad has, the Indians
hoped to pull off just a few victo
ries in early season games against
weak teams.
"As bad as we were, early on we
played mediocre teams," Norman
said. "We had a few teams on the
hook and let them get away."
The Indians threatened to post
an opening victory against Wash
ington State but let it get away. In
Pullman, Stanford jumped to a
14-0 lead behind the strong run
ning of fullback John Bessey.
However, in a scenario that
sounds rather familiar to this
year's Cardinal fans, the team col
lapsed in the second half. In less
than two minutes, the Cougars

pulled down a couple touchdowns
and converted the deuce on one
extra point attempt to walk away
with a 15-14 victory.
In the ninth game of the sea
son, the Indians had a chance to
crawl into Big Game with one vic
tory under its belt. In front of
7,500 fans, Stanford made a late
game surge in an effort to defeat
Oregon State on a wet Saturday
afternoon.

Down by a score of 25-21, Stan
ford got the ball to star running
back Skip Face who scampered
four yards into the end zone to
supposedly put the Indians up 27-
25 with less than two minutes
remaining. Unfortunately for the
despairing Indian fans, Face's run
was called back with a clipping
penalty against Stanford, and the
Beavers took over and ran out the
clock.
"That was the closest sniff we
got to victory all season," Norman
said.

Against California the follow
ing week, the Indians had one
"last shot to get the monkey off of
our backs." Instead, Cal domi
nated, won the game 21-10, and

maintained control of the Axe.
Norman, who now lives in
Maiysville, Wash., still hears the
mocking chants of the monkey. He
has not forgotten the pain from
the 1960 season.

"Once it was over, I knew it was
as miserable and embarrassing
situation that I would have ever
been involved," he said. "I spent
the balance of my life trying never
to be surrounded by such circum
stances again ... If there was
something that I could cross out
in my life, it would be that sea
son," Norman said.
Thirty years later, Stanford
again faces high frustration and
disappointment. The Cardinal,
after starting out with such
promise, finds itself searching for
away to finish the season without
a long losing streak.
Three decades after his senior
campaign, Norman is still dealing
with the debacle of 1960.

This year's squad probably
hopes the same will not be said for
them. Hopefully in 30 years the
embarrassments at USC, Wash
ington, and Oregon will fade into
the shadows.

ington State but let it get away. In
Pullman, Stanford jumped to a
14-0 lead behind the strong run
ning of fullback John Bessey.
However, in a scenario that
sounds rather familiar to this
year's Cardinal fans, the team col
lapsed in the second half. In less
than two minutes, the Cougars

pulled down a couple touchdowns
and converted the deuce on one
extra point attempt to walk away
with a 15-14 victory.
In the ninth game of the sea
son, the Indians had a chance to
crawl into Big Game with one vic
tory under its belt. In front of
7,500 fans, Stanford made a late
game surge in an effort to defeat
Oregon State on a wet Saturday
afternoon.

Down by a score of 25-21, Stan
ford got the ball to star running
back Skip Face who scampered
four yards into the end zone to
supposedly put the Indians up 27-
25 with less than two minutes
remaining. Unfortunately for the
despairing Indian fans, Face's run
was called back with a clipping
penalty against Stanford, and the
Beavers took over and ran out the
clock.
"That was the closest sniff we
got to victory all season," Norman
said.

Against California the follow
ing week, the Indians had one
"last shot to get the monkey off of
our backs." Instead, Cal domi
nated, won the game 21-10, and

maintained control of the Axe.
Norman, who now lives in
Maiysville, Wash., still hears the
mocking chants of the monkey. He
has not forgotten the pain from
the 1960 season.

"Once it was over, I knew it was
as miserable and embarrassing
situation that I would have ever
been involved," he said. "I spent
the balance of my life trying never
to be surrounded by such circum
stances again ... If there was
something that I could cross out
in my life, it would be that sea
son," Norman said.
Thirty years later, Stanford
again faces high frustration and
disappointment. The Cardinal,
after starting out with such
promise, finds itself searching for
away to finish the season without
a long losing streak.
Three decades after his senior
campaign, Norman is still dealing
with the debacle of 1960.

This year's squad probably
hopes the same will not be said for
them. Hopefully in 30 years the
embarrassments at USC, Wash
ington, and Oregon will fade into
the shadows.
Stanford 36, Notre Dame 31:
Damn, we're good.
USC 37, Stanford 22: Ouch,
that hurt.
Washington 52, Stanford 16:
I'll leave at halftime.
Oregon 31, Stanford 0:
Should I even go to the WSU
game?

Even for the flippant, unfaith
ful Stanford fan, the rapid descent
from national recognition has
been painful. But pleasure and
pain are experienced on a relative
scale, and, although some similar
ities exist between the 1960 and
the 1990 teams, compared to 30
years ago, Cardinal fans have to
feel fairly comfortable.
Under the guidance of "Cac
tus" Jack Curtis, Stanford strug
gled through the 1960 season to
post a 0-10 record, and students
were willing to express rather can
didly their feelings about the
squad.
According to alumnus Carole
Gledhill, the students, with the
men in white shirts and the
women in red skirts, were united
and enthusiastic about the team

despite its record. Now, Gledhill
feels the crowd comes only to
cheer and associate with Stanford
victories.

"It's not just the students
(now); the 'old farts' section sits
on their hands as well," Gledhill
said. "It make me mad with all of
the athletes trying so hard. . .
everybody (in the stands) seems so
apathetic."
However, 1952 graduate Ray
Haite disagrees that the students
have lost spirit.
"Stanford students have never
followed yell leaders," said Haite,
who has not missed a Stanford
game since 1958. "You're never
going to get Stanford students to
act like USC students."
Instead, Haite remembers a
more distasteful bite in the 1960
crowd. The students had no shin
ing moments to recall for the
entire season.
"It was as bad down there as it
could possibly get," he said. "Stu
dents threw the cards (in the
cheering section) and left the
game early."
Led by standout quarterback
Dick Norman, who later that year
broke the school record for total
career passing yardage with 3,737
yards, the Indians entered the

season with less than spectacular
expectations. The team had lost
most of its receiving corps to grad
uation and hoped at best to post
three or four wins. In addition,
the coaches had had a difficult
time pulling high quality players
to the Farm.
"We knew we were not going to
the Rose Bowl," Norman said.
"We had mediocre recruiting years
back-to-back and got caught short
on material."
Instead of gauging their perfor
mance by close losses against the
national powers as the present
Cardinal squad has, the Indians
hoped to pull off just a few victo
ries in early season games against
weak teams.
"As bad as we were, early on we
played mediocre teams," Norman
said. "We had a few teams on the
hook and let them get away."
