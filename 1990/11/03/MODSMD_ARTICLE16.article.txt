# Motherly Edwards leads squad into NCAAs
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford senior goalie Elise
Edwards responds to numerous
nicknames, but she would prefer
to talk about titles.
When women's soccer coach
Berhane Andeberhan screams
"Coach" during a game, he's not
criticizing himself or trying to
remember his name. And when he
talks about "Mom" on the side
line, he's not calling home for
help.
Andeberhan is communicating
with the team's omnipresent field
leader and off-the-field organizer,
Edwards. But this weekend she is
less concerned with her many
names, and more interested in
adding a prestigious title next to
Stanford's: national champion.
Edwards tonight leads seventh
ranked Stanford into its first-ever
NCAA tournament. The Cardinal
plays at No. 4 UC-Santa Barbara
at 7:30 in the first round of the
12-team tournament.
"I'm confident about our
chances. We have to be. Our goal
was to make the playoffs, but our
goals changed as soon as we made
it," Edwards said. "Our goal can't
be anything less than winning the
whole thing. You can't think of
anything less than that."
Stanford, with a 15-2-1 record
and a current four-shutout win
streak, has already had the best
season in the program's history.
Edwards, a 5-foot-11, 170-
pound intimidator from Madison,
Wis., came to Stanford with then
first-year coach Andeberhan in
1987, and since then the mediocre
program has risen meteorically.
"She's basically one of the cor
nerstones of building this team
and getting it to where it is," said
Andeberhan, who has developed
the program without the benefit
of any athletic scholarships. "Her
value on the field is obvious, but
her value off the field is just as
great."
Edwards was team's most valu
able player in 1988 and set a Stan
ford record last year with 11
shutouts. This season she has
lowered her goals per game aver
age to .55. But despite her signifi
cant on-field contributions,

Edwards' team leadership on
and off the field has garnered
her the most praise.
"She is concerned about every
one's welfare academically and
socially. She's one of the most
unselfish people I've ever met,"
Andeberhan said.
"She takes care of teammates'
needs. She finds out who needs to
be picked up, who's feeling
stressed about studying, and she
is always arranging parties for the
team. She throws study parties
for CIV calculus she's a tutor,
she's everything. She's a great
cook too," Andeberhan said.
Edwards stops just short of
driving the team bus the Cardi
nal got a charter for the trip to
Santa Barbara but does just
about everything else to help out
her teammates. Her car has
turned into the team vehicle and
she is a frequent host for team
meals. She stumbled on the
"Mom" nickname in the presea
son and is called "Coach" by
Andeberhan because of her field
leadership.
"It wasn't really of my choos
ing, I was delegated," said
Edwards, who made the mistake
at the beginning of the year of
asking who would replace Chris
tine Martin as the team mom.
"But I really care about this team
and I enjoy doing it."
"She thinks of others before
herself," said junior fullback
Kerry Stivaletti. "It goes beyond
being 'Mom', she does every
thing."
"She doesn't speak out as
much as previous captains," con
tinued Stivaletti, who Edwards
designated as a co-Mom with
junior Michele Sullivan for next
year. "She's like a parent that
doesn't punish very much. But
when they do talk, everybody lis
tens."
Not that Edwards is a
pushover. When she puts her
game face on she is a determined
competitor and an intimidating
force in the box. Edwards is at her
best when she is clearing out
invading forwards to intercept a
crossing pass. And she's not afraid
of contact.
"She's really gentle and
unselfish. It's almost paradoxi

cal," said Andeberhan. "In the box
she has such intensity and aggres
siveness and she has single-hand
edly kept us in games for four
years."
Although intense and deter
mined, she epitomizes the team's
perspective on soccer that it
should always be enjoyed.
"Just because you're working
hard doesn't mean you can't have
fun," she said.
Edwards is acting president of
the not-so-elitist Keeper's Union,
a team club loosely affiliated with
the forward's club. Andeberhan
encourages the team to have fun,
and they try not to disappoint.

"Everybody knows the second
best forwards on the team are the
goalies, and the second best
goalies on the team are the for
wards, so we have to work
together," said Edwards, who may
have dreams about going coast-to
coast to score on the other end.
Edwards joined the national
team pool in the spring of her
sophomore year and is the
youngest of six goalies on the
squad. Although her primary
commitment is to Stanford, she
may stay with the national team
after graduating and shoot for the
1991 World Cup.
But she realizes that soccer

won't last forever, and her tenta
tive plans after graduation are
about as far away as you can get
from being a backup.
An international relations
major, Edwards spent last spring
in Tokyo studying Japanese busi
ness, and she may return there
after graduation.
"When I was away I realized I
could survive without soccer,"
Edwards said. "But I really
missed the team, the coaches and
my friends."
Stanford will miss Edwards
just as much. The Cardinal has

improved each of the last four
years and Edwards is one of only
four seniors on the team. But it
isn't easy replacing a Mom.
"Some people are irreplaceable.
But we want her to go on and be

great in whatever she does,"
Andeberhan said.
"I'm not afraid of replacing soc
cer ability, but these unique char
acters on the team we'll really
miss. We're optimistic we'll keep
on getting other unique people on
the team," he said.
Edwards is backed up by sopho
mores Chris Massell and Wendy

Kevan and freshman Leslie Gar
rard, who will have their chance
next year as the young Stanford
team continues to improve.
As Stanford plays in the NCAA
tournament, Edwards has clearly
started a women's soccer tradi
tion. But the tradition is not just
one of winning, but one of Moms,
caring and family fun.

nal got a charter for the trip to
Santa Barbara but does just
about everything else to help out
her teammates. Her car has
turned into the team vehicle and
she is a frequent host for team
meals. She stumbled on the
"Mom" nickname in the presea
son and is called "Coach" by
Andeberhan because of her field
leadership.
"It wasn't really of my choos
ing, I was delegated," said
Edwards, who made the mistake
at the beginning of the year of
asking who would replace Chris
tine Martin as the team mom.
"But I really care about this team
and I enjoy doing it."
"She thinks of others before
herself," said junior fullback
Kerry Stivaletti. "It goes beyond
being 'Mom', she does every
thing."
"She doesn't speak out as
much as previous captains," con
tinued Stivaletti, who Edwards
designated as a co-Mom with
junior Michele Sullivan for next
year. "She's like a parent that
doesn't punish very much. But
when they do talk, everybody lis
tens."
Not that Edwards is a
pushover. When she puts her
game face on she is a determined
competitor and an intimidating
force in the box. Edwards is at her
best when she is clearing out
invading forwards to intercept a
crossing pass. And she's not afraid
of contact.
"She's really gentle and
unselfish. It's almost paradoxi

cal," said Andeberhan. "In the box
she has such intensity and aggres
siveness and she has single-hand
edly kept us in games for four
years."
Although intense and deter
mined, she epitomizes the team's
perspective on soccer that it
should always be enjoyed.
"Just because you're working
hard doesn't mean you can't have
fun," she said.
Edwards is acting president of
the not-so-elitist Keeper's Union,
a team club loosely affiliated with
the forward's club. Andeberhan
encourages the team to have fun,
and they try not to disappoint.

"Everybody knows the second
best forwards on the team are the
goalies, and the second best
goalies on the team are the for
wards, so we have to work
together," said Edwards, who may
have dreams about going coast-to
coast to score on the other end.
Edwards joined the national
team pool in the spring of her
sophomore year and is the
youngest of six goalies on the
squad. Although her primary
commitment is to Stanford, she
may stay with the national team
after graduating and shoot for the
1991 World Cup.
But she realizes that soccer

won't last forever, and her tenta
tive plans after graduation are
about as far away as you can get
from being a backup.
An international relations
major, Edwards spent last spring
in Tokyo studying Japanese busi

after graduation.
"When I was away I realized I
could survive without soccer,"
Edwards said. "But I really
missed the team, the coaches and
my friends."
Stanford will miss Edwards
just as much. The Cardinal has

Under the moniker of "mom," Elise Edwards has been the team leader of this year's women's soccer

an impressive .55 goals-against average, Edwards has led her team to the NCAA play offs.
improved each of the last four
years and Edwards is one of only
four seniors on the team. But it
isn't easy replacing a Mom.
"Some people are irreplaceable.
But we want her to go on and be

great in whatever she does,"
Andeberhan said.
"I'm not afraid of replacing soc
cer ability, but these unique char
acters on the team we'll really
miss. We're optimistic we'll keep
on getting other unique people on
the team," he said.
Edwards is backed up by sopho
mores Chris Massell and Wendy

Kevan and freshman Leslie Gar
rard, who will have their chance
next year as the young Stanford
team continues to improve.
As Stanford plays in the NCAA
tournament, Edwards has clearly
started a women's soccer tradi
tion. But the tradition is not just
one of winning, but one of Moms,
caring and family fun.
Stanford senior goalie Elise
Edwards responds to numerous
nicknames, but she would prefer
to talk about titles.
When women's soccer coach
Berhane Andeberhan screams
"Coach" during a game, he's not
criticizing himself or trying to
remember his name. And when he
talks about "Mom" on the side
line, he's not calling home for
help.
Andeberhan is communicating
with the team's omnipresent field
leader and off-the-field organizer,
Edwards. But this weekend she is
less concerned with her many
names, and more interested in
adding a prestigious title next to
Stanford's: national champion.
Edwards tonight leads seventh
ranked Stanford into its first-ever
NCAA tournament. The Cardinal
plays at No. 4 UC-Santa Barbara
at 7:30 in the first round of the
12-team tournament.
"I'm confident about our
chances. We have to be. Our goal
was to make the playoffs, but our
goals changed as soon as we made
it," Edwards said. "Our goal can't
be anything less than winning the
whole thing. You can't think of
anything less than that."
Stanford, with a 15-2-1 record
and a current four-shutout win
streak, has already had the best
season in the program's history.
Edwards, a 5-foot-11, 170-
pound intimidator from Madison,
Wis., came to Stanford with then
first-year coach Andeberhan in
1987, and since then the mediocre
program has risen meteorically.
"She's basically one of the cor
nerstones of building this team
and getting it to where it is," said
Andeberhan, who has developed
the program without the benefit
of any athletic scholarships. "Her
value on the field is obvious, but
her value off the field is just as
great."
Edwards was team's most valu
able player in 1988 and set a Stan
ford record last year with 11
shutouts. This season she has
lowered her goals per game aver
age to .55. But despite her signifi
cant on-field contributions,

Edwards' team leadership on
and off the field has garnered
her the most praise.
"She is concerned about every
one's welfare academically and
socially. She's one of the most
unselfish people I've ever met,"
Andeberhan said.
"She takes care of teammates'
needs. She finds out who needs to
be picked up, who's feeling
stressed about studying, and she
is always arranging parties for the
team. She throws study parties
for CIV calculus she's a tutor,
she's everything. She's a great
cook too," Andeberhan said.
