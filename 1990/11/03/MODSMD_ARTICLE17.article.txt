# Walk-ons play with guts, not for money
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Some may say that a football
scholarship at Stanford is a fair
trade-off for a 30-hour-a-week
commitment. But ask any walk-on
and he'll tell you that a four-year
full ride plays second fiddle to the
chance to play Stanford football.
"If you like to play the game,
the time commitment doesn't
really matter," freshman walk-on
William Martin said.

Martin's story and the story of
any player that walks-on to the
Stanford football team is one of
optimism and dedication to foot
ball. While hopes for scholarships
and playing time constantly linger
in the back of their minds, these
players put forth their best efforts
to contribute in any way they can.
"I think I can make a great con
tribution to the team and I know
all the hard work will pay off in
the future," Martin said.
Martin was involved in Stan
ford's preliminary recruiting pro
cess but was dropped early on.
When told that he was no longer
being recruited, Martin inquired
into the prospect of walking-on.
"I sent in more films and once I

was accepted into the school, the
recruiting office called me," Mar
tin said. "They told me they
thought I had good athletic ability
and they asked me to come out for
early ball."
However, not all walk-ons are
invited to preseason.
Senior David Durkin began
practicing with the team during
the winter quarter of his fresh
man year.

"(Former coach Jack) Elway
wavered about letting me come to
early practices," Durkin said. "I
was deciding between Stanford
and Yale. I would have been able
to play right away at Yale but I
wanted to come here."

Following winter training,
Durkin was invited to play spring
ball. He performed well enough
during the spring to be asked onto
the team his sophomore year.
"We welcome any walk-on with
open arms if he has high school
experience, shows competency in
playing the game, and has the
ability to get through a workout,"
coach Denny Green said. "We cut
them only if we feel they could get
injured or would make no contri
bution to the team."
Sophomore walk-on Mike

Buckley was also recruited early
on by Stanford but was dropped at
one point in the recruiting pro
cess. Once he arrived at Stanford,
he was encouraged by the coach
ing staff to walk-on. Buckley saw
the opportunity as a chance to
earn a scholarship.
"Earning a scholarship was
definitely one of my goals coming
onto the team," Bucldey said.
Buckley was the only walk-on
in his class to go through fall
training. When asked if he felt out
of place on the team, he replied
that he expected to be treated a
little differently than the other
players, but he found himself
pleasantly surprised.

"The coaches treated me like
they did everyone else, and they
have all the way through," Buck
ley said. "Some of the guys on the
team didn't even know that I was
a walk-on until the spring."
Socially, there is virtually no
distinction on the team between
walk-ons and scholarship players.
"There's a certain kind of bond
among the walk-ons because we
know we're not alone in our situa
tion," Martin said. "But generally
there really isn't any difference
between us and the recruited play

ers.
"Once you're on the team,
everyone's in the same situation
and has the same responsibili
ties," Durkin said. "The walk-ons
are integrated into the team and
aren't regarded as being separate
from the rest."

There really is only one differ
ence: The walk-ons are paying
over $20,000 a year to play.
Though some walk-ons do eventu
ally earn scholarships, most do
not.

"We can only give out as many
scholarships as are available."
Green said. "We do have a history
of rewarding players that work
hard and have the talent to con
tribute. For someone to earn a
scholarship, he has to be one
damn good football player."
Buckley, who redshirted as
running-back last year, has been
offered a scholarship starting next
fall and is expected to see playing
time on special teams. Green
describes Buckley as a "good hard
working player who has been of
significant service to the team."
Martin is also expecting a
scholarship to come eventually.
"I think there's a good possibil
ity that I will get a scholarship as
long as I work hard, keep on
improving and getting stronger,"
Martin said. "I just take each day
at a time, doing my job and mak
ing myself known."
Martin feels that he is in a posi
tion in which he must prove to the
coaching staff that he deserves to
be on scholarship.
"When you get a scholarship at
a school, it is as if the school is
saying, 'You're good enough to
play for us,' " Martin said. "If you
don't get one, it's like the school is
saying that you're not good
enough. As a walk-on, you have to
go out there and prove that you
are."

Durkin, who plays place-kicker
behind school record holder John
Hopkins, has not been awarded a
scholarship. However, he did see
playing time in the home game

against Oregon State where he
booted a kickoff.
"I was definitely very excited to
finally step onto the field after
putting so much time in," Durkin
said. "I was glad to finally con
tribute in some way."
Although he has seen only very
limited playing time, Durkin isn't
unhappy.
"The program is turning
around and I'll be glad to look
back and say I was there," Durkin
said.

Playing behind Hopkins,
Durkin says that he'd like to think
that he's partly responsible for
Hopkins excelling the way he has.
Buckley agrees that every player
has a part in the team's improve
ment.

"Our program is on the
upswing and getting more walk
ons will only help," Buckley said.
"Everyone on the team has a role
to play."
So what happens if a walk-on
never gets playing time or a schol
arship? Green points out that on a
team of 100 players, only 11 get to
play at a time. Any player that
doesn't get to play is disappointed.
"You have to play football
because you love it," Green said.
"There has to be a personal satis
faction."

Durkin adds that as well as
self-satisfaction, self-confidence is
also important in being a walk-on.
"I play because I believe in
myself and I believe in the pro
gram," Durkin said.
Martin agrees.
"You gotta believe in yourself,"
Martin said. "It takes a lot of guts
to walk-on. You have to have the
desire to play."

Buckley says he had two goals
coming onto the Stanford football
team: The first was to earn a
scholarship and the second was to
play. Now that he has achieved his
first goal, he is moving on to the
next.

"I enjoy playing football,"
Buckley said. "I just want to play."

'You Gotta believe in yourself. It takes a
lot of guts to walk on. You have to have
the desire to play.'

For the walk-on, just being a part of the team is often the only reward. Though the over all objective is
playing time and a scholorship, most try to contribute in practice and not be just another face in the
crowd.
