# Pacific-10 enjoys success
## 
### Janet Feldstein Staff writer 
Now that November is here
and bowl games loom on the hori
zon, football seasons are drawing
to a close and Pacific 10 Confer
ence teams are playing their last
games of the 1990 season.
This year has been exceptional
for the teams of the Pac-10. In
addition to consistently high per
formances that could lead to bowl
games for as many as five teams,
wins such as Stanford's upset
over Notre Dame and Oregon's
defeat of Brigham Young
University gained the conference
national exposure.

Within the conference Wash
ington has emerged as by far the
No.l team. Undefeated within the
conference, Washington has lost
only to Colorado and has been vic
torious in seven of its eight games.
Its impressive record gained
Washington respect within the
conference and around the nation,
and has helped the Pac-10 remain
in the national spotlight.
"Washington is as good as any
body else in the nation," Pac-10
spokeperson Jim Muldoon said. "I
might not have said that three
weeks ago, but no other Pac-10
team has come within three
touchdowns of beating them."

Stanford coach Dennis Green
agreed.
"Washington will be the team
which carries the banner for [the
Pac-10]," Green said.
Matt Marson, Managing Editor
of "Football News" said, although
he predicted in a recent issue that

they would lose to Illinois at the
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day,
"Washington's the only team in
the Pac-10 this year to play with
any consistency."
Marson predicted two other
bowl games for Pac-10 teams; Ari
zona will dominate the Freedom
bowl and Oregon will take home
the Copper bowl trophy.
Another Pac-10 spokeperson
agreed that Oregon, a very excit
ing team, has a good shot at a 9-2
season, and therefore a chance of
a bowl game. And while the Pac
10's only guarantee is a spot at the
Rose Bowl, USC, California and
Oregon all look good for bowl
games. Stanford, however, is not a
likely bowl candidate he said.
Statistically the Pac-10 com
pares well to the other confer
ences. The Pac-10 is 18-12 out of
conference and Big Eight is 20-12-
11. The Big Ten is 16-13-1 and the
ACC has a 21-4 record.

Over the last ten years the Pac
-10 and the SEC have emerged as
the most competitive conferences,
according to Jim Muldoon. The
Pac-10, for example, has more
players in the NFL than any other
conference.

Because of the influx of many
new players this year, some antic
ipated recruits, and some sur
prises, the Pac-10 expects next
year's season to be even better.
Players throughout the Pac-10
like Russell White, Glyn Milburn,
Tommy Maddox, and Drew Bled
soe are promising stars who will
help maintain the Pac-10's status
as "a far superior [conference],"
according to Muldoon.

Like the rest of the Pac-10,
Stanford has had some great
games, but despite the shocking
Notre Dame victory and consider
able overall excellent perfor
mances from individual players,
Stanford's record shows only one
other win and six losses. Stan
ford's record, however, is deceiv
ing.
According to Washington State
coach Mike Price, the Cardinal's
schedule strength ranks second in
the nation. The Cardinal lost
three games by a total of ten
points, including last second
losses to Colorado and UCLA.
Stanford does, in fact, have many
talented players. The Cardinal
boasts players Ed McCaffery, Glyn
Milburn and Tommy Vardell who
rank nationally in six statistical
categories.
McCaffery, a senior who,
according to teammate quarter
back Jason Palumbis, is "the best
receiver in the country," leads the
Pac-10 both in receiving and in
receiving yardage, and nationally
ranks fourth in receiving and
eighth in receiving yardage.

Tailback Milburn is first and sec
ond in the Pac-10 in all purpose
yardage, with 191.6 yards, and
receiving, respectively. He also
ranks third in Pac-10 in receiving
yardage, kickoff returns and punt
returns. Nationally he is on top in
receiving, punt returns and all
purpose yards.
Milburn is considered one of
the nation's leaders in all-purpose
running, according to "Football
News."

receiving yardage, and nationally
ranks fourth in receiving and
eighth in receiving yardage.

Tailback Milburn is first and sec
ond in the Pac-10 in all purpose
yardage, with 191.6 yards, and
receiving, respectively. He also
ranks third in Pac-10 in receiving
yardage, kickoff returns and punt
returns. Nationally he is on top in
receiving, punt returns and all
purpose yards.
Milburn is considered one of
the nation's leaders in all-purpose
running, according to "Football

Now that November is here
and bowl games loom on the hori
zon, football seasons are drawing
to a close and Pacific 10 Confer
ence teams are playing their last
games of the 1990 season.
This year has been exceptional
for the teams of the Pac-10. In
addition to consistently high per
formances that could lead to bowl
games for as many as five teams,
wins such as Stanford's upset
over Notre Dame and Oregon's
defeat of Brigham Young
University gained the conference
national exposure.

Within the conference Wash
ington has emerged as by far the
No.l team. Undefeated within the
conference, Washington has lost
only to Colorado and has been vic
torious in seven of its eight games.
Its impressive record gained
Washington respect within the
conference and around the nation,
and has helped the Pac-10 remain
in the national spotlight.
"Washington is as good as any
body else in the nation," Pac-10
spokeperson Jim Muldoon said. "I
might not have said that three
weeks ago, but no other Pac-10
team has come within three
touchdowns of beating them."

Stanford coach Dennis Green
agreed.
"Washington will be the team
which carries the banner for [the
Pac-10]," Green said.
Matt Marson, Managing Editor
of "Football News" said, although
he predicted in a recent issue that

they would lose to Illinois at the
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day,
"Washington's the only team in
the Pac-10 this year to play with
any consistency."
Marson predicted two other
bowl games for Pac-10 teams; Ari
zona will dominate the Freedom
bowl and Oregon will take home
the Copper bowl trophy.
Another Pac-10 spokeperson
agreed that Oregon, a very excit
ing team, has a good shot at a 9-2
season, and therefore a chance of
a bowl game. And while the Pac
10's only guarantee is a spot at the
Rose Bowl, USC, California and
Oregon all look good for bowl
games. Stanford, however, is not a
likely bowl candidate he said.
Statistically the Pac-10 com
pares well to the other confer
ences. The Pac-10 is 18-12 out of
conference and Big Eight is 20-12-
11. The Big Ten is 16-13-1 and the
ACC has a 21-4 record.

Over the last ten years the Pac
-10 and the SEC have emerged as
the most competitive conferences,
according to Jim Muldoon. The
Pac-10, for example, has more
players in the NFL than any other
conference.

Because of the influx of many
new players this year, some antic
ipated recruits, and some sur
prises, the Pac-10 expects next
year's season to be even better.
Players throughout the Pac-10
like Russell White, Glyn Milburn,
Tommy Maddox, and Drew Bled
soe are promising stars who will
help maintain the Pac-10's status
as "a far superior [conference],"
according to Muldoon.

Like the rest of the Pac-10,
Stanford has had some great
games, but despite the shocking
Notre Dame victory and consider
able overall excellent perfor
mances from individual players,
Stanford's record shows only one
other win and six losses. Stan
ford's record, however, is deceiv
ing.
According to Washington State
coach Mike Price, the Cardinal's
schedule strength ranks second in
the nation. The Cardinal lost
three games by a total of ten
points, including last second
losses to Colorado and UCLA.
Stanford does, in fact, have many
talented players. The Cardinal
boasts players Ed McCaffery, Glyn
Milburn and Tommy Vardell who
rank nationally in six statistical
categories.
McCaffery, a senior who,
according to teammate quarter
back Jason Palumbis, is "the best
receiver in the country," leads the
Pac-10 both in receiving and in
receiving yardage, and nationally
ranks fourth in receiving and
eighth in receiving yardage.

Tailback Milburn is first and sec
ond in the Pac-10 in all purpose
yardage, with 191.6 yards, and
receiving, respectively. He also
ranks third in Pac-10 in receiving
yardage, kickoff returns and punt
returns. Nationally he is on top in
receiving, punt returns and all
purpose yards.
Milburn is considered one of
the nation's leaders in all-purpose
running, according to "Football
News."
