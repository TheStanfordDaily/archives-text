Like it or not, the Leland Stan
ford Junior (pause) University
Marching Band is not with us
today. The band was suspended
indefinitely due to its halftime
show last weekend at Oregon. The
campus and media have been
awash with different ideas and
viewpoints concerning the suspen
sion, but in an effort to further
clarify the issue, this space is
devoted to the band's own transla
tion of the matter.

On Tuesday, Oct. 30, the Stan
ford Athletic Department indefi
nitely suspended the Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching
Band from performing at Stan
ford football games.
This action resulted from the
Band's performance on Oct. 27 at
the Oregon, where it presented a
lampoon of the spotted owl con
troversy. y
The Band is extremely disap
pointed with the way the Athletic
Department handled the issue,
finding its action unreasonable,
unjust and undeserved.
In summary, these are the
salient facts:
• At halftime, the Band per
formed a parody of the spotted owl
debate that was directly in line
with previous politically-satirical
shows (e.g. "The Midwest Cri
sis"). Our halftime announce
ments did not contain any abusive
or obscene language.

• Out of concern for the issue's
sensitivity, the Band exhibited
extra consideration by soliciting
the opinions of band members
from Oregon before deciding to
perform the show. Neither they
nor our faculty liaison, Dr. Arthur
E Barnes, found anything objec
tionable about it. Moreover, based
on the Athletic Department's pre
vious acceptance of arguably
"more offensive" halftime mate
rial (in other shows this season),
the Band was not lead to believe
that the spotted owl was an
unpresentable topic.
To avoid Spotted Owl partisan
ship, the Band evenhandedly tried
to lampoon both loggers and envi
ronmentalists.

In order, the show presented
the following formations:
1) The Band formed a large owl
head.
2) The Band spelled the word
"OWL" which changed to
"AWOL."
3) The Band spelled the word
"HOOT" which then changed to
"MOOT."
4) The Band formed a chain
saw (playing a snippet of Monty
Python's famous "Lumberjack
Song").
5) The Band spelled the word
"SPOT" which changed to
"POT!"
Just as the chain saw-forma
tion poked fun at the logging
industry, the "SPOT -> POT!"
formation jokingly claimed that
environmentalists are really only
interested in preserving their
marijuana fields, not the spotted
owl.
• Oregon's fans had been boo
ing and shouting obscenities at
the Band from the time we first
entered Autzen Stadium. Despite
our performance of a pregame
show that the San Jose Mercury
News called our "finest hour this
season," the crowd obviously was
biased against us. They probably
would have booed our halftime
show regardless of its focus.

• The Band resents the Athletic
Department's implication that we
regularly embarrass our univer
sity and our football team. The
Band is among the most dynamic
supporters of Stanford athletics,
always playing our music to the
best of our abilities in order to
motivate our teams and their
fans. This past weekend was no
exception.

Overall, the Band regrets pre
senting material that was misun
derstood and subsequently con
sidered offensive. Based on the
situation's facts, however, we con
sider the suspension arbitrary and
improper. The Athletic Depart
ment's response seems completely
unbalanced: its true motivations
are unclear.

We are extremely disappointed
that the Athletic Department will
prevent us from supporting and
entertaining the Stanford com
munity during this season's last
home game.
