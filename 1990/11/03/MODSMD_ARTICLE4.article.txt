# Aerial powers attempt to climb out of cellar
## 
### Kevin Jeffery 
Anytime you hear a head coach
talk about "playing a game for
pride," you can be certain the
matchup has minimal impact on
anyone but the two combatants.
Unfortunately, that's exactly
the way Washington State coach
Mike Price described today's game
against the Cardinal, and few
observers outside of Palo Alto and
Pullman will pay much notice to
the outcome.
Still, Price is quick to describe
the significance of this game to his
Cougars (2-3, 3-5 overall).
"Our goal is to have a winning
season. We need to sweep our last
three games, and the first step to
that is to beat Stanford," he said.
Stanford stands at 1-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference and 2-6
overall after suffering their sec
ond blowout in as many weeks, a
31-0 flogging at the hands of Ore
gon. Coach Denny Green had little
explanation for the Cardinal's
recent lack of scoring punch.
"We're just out of sync right
now, plain and simple," he said.
"This week we're hoping to find
that missing link."
They're also hoping to stay out
of the Pac-10 cellar. Stanford
enters today's action in ninth
place and Washington State is sev
enth. A loss today could make
either school a serious contender
to wrestle the bottom spot from
Arizona State.
"These are two programs fight
ing for respectability in a tough
conference," Price said. "It's
going to be a dogfight."
Indeed, with the conference's
top two rated quarterbacks facing
off, today's game promises to be
an aerial battle.
Washington State enters the
game with a potent passing
attack, ranked first in the Pac-10
(259.9 yards per game) and 14th
in the nation. They will put Stan
ford's shaky secondary, ranked
last in conference pass-defense
efficiency, to a severe test.
The Cougars seem to be
attempting to replace Stanford as
the Pac-10's "Quarterback U." as
they add freshman sensation

Drew Bledsoe's name to a list of
stars which include current NFL
starters Mark Rypien (Redskins)
and Timm Rosenbach (Cardinals).
Price had nothing but praise
for the true freshman, though he
concedes the decision two weeks
ago to make him a starter was a
difficult one.
"I was hesitant to take out our
senior team captain Brad Gossen,
but when Drew stepped in things
just clicked," he said. "Drew has a
strong arm, quick release, avoids
the rush well and has the ability
to make the big play. He's playing
very well for a true freshman, as a
matter of fact, he's playing very
well for a senior."
And a mighty fine senior, at
that. Last week against Arizona,
the 6-foot-5 Bledsoe led a furious
comeback which saw the Cougars
score 24 second half points to fall
just short of victory, 42-34. He
threw for the third highest total in
Washington State history (385
yards) and scored two touch
downs, including one on a pass to
himself which bounced into his
arms off a lineman's helmet.
The Washington State passing
attack has also led the team to a
record 72-game scoring streak.
The Cougars have not been
blanked since a 44-0 loss to Ohio
State in 1984.
On the other side of the ball,
neither the skies nor the score
board have not been so friendly of
late.
Jason Palumbis will start for
Green at quarterback, although
he has been replaced in the second
half by John Lynch the past two
weeks.
Still, Palumbis has managed to
maintain his spot as the confer
ence's second-leading passer (224
yards per game) and will look
downfield to the Pac-10's top two
receivers, Ed McCaffrey and Glyn
Milburn.
But the running game (or lack
thereof) has hampered Stanford's
efficiency through the air in
recent games. A paltry average of
58.4 rushing yards per game over
the past five weeks has left the
offense completely one-dimen
sional.

Green knows things must
change.
"Other teams gained an advan
tage against Washington State by
running the ball; we need to be
able to run," he said. "We have an
explosive back in Milburn and we
need to get him into their sec
ondary."

If the Cardinal offense is look
ing for big yardage plays, they've
hooked up with the right team.
Last weekend, the Cougars gave
up a touchdown to Arizona after
just two plays from scrimmage,
and they currently rank ninth in
the conference in both total
defense (427 yards per game) and
opponents third down efficiency
(45.7 percent).
Green agrees that big plays
could be the key, and he has seen

his squad recently on the short
end of too many of them.
"We simply cannot give up big
plays on defense," he said. "It's
plagued us all year."

Another subtle key today could
be the kicking game and field posi
tion, something Stanford oppo
nents have enjoyed a significant
advantage in all year.
Things shouldn't improve
today as Washington State boasts
the nation's third-leading punter
in junior Jason Hanson. Hanson's
40.3-yard net average is nearly
seven yards better than that of
Stanford's Paul Stonehouse
(33.4).

Hanson is also the Cougars
placekicker, and already hold the
school's career scoring record
with 255 points. He has a legiti

mate chance to become just the
third Pac-10 kicker to be named
first team at both positions.
Ten Stanford players, includ
ing starters McCaffrey, Chuck
Gillingham, John Hopkins, Kevin
Scott and Jono Tunney will be
playing their last game in Stan
ford Stadium today. They would
undoubtedly like to close their
home careers with a victory.
And although Washington
State has downed the Cardinal in
their last two meetings, Price feels
that "it's going to be a very com
petitive game. Obviously, on any
given Saturday, they can beat any
team in the country."

McCaffrey and Co. are hoping
another long-awaited "given Sat
urday" will turn out to be today.

If Stanford is to break out of its recent scoring slump and produce a victory today, the team's running
attack has to find new life. Charlie Young (above) and the rest of his backfield mates are hoping to find
new life against the Couger's rushing defense, ranked sixth in the Pac-10.

defense (427 yards per game) and
opponents third down efficiency
(45.7 percent).
Green agrees that big plays
could be the key, and he has seen

his squad recently on the short
end of too many of them.
"We simply cannot give up big
plays on defense," he said. "It's
plagued us all year."

Another subtle key today could
be the kicking game and field posi
tion, something Stanford oppo
nents have enjoyed a significant
advantage in all year.
Things shouldn't improve
today as Washington State boasts
the nation's third-leading punter
in junior Jason Hanson. Hanson's
40.3-yard net average is nearly
seven yards better than that of
Stanford's Paul Stonehouse
(33.4).

Hanson is also the Cougars
placekicker, and already hold the
school's career scoring record
with 255 points. He has a legiti

mate chance to become just the
third Pac-10 kicker to be named
first team at both positions.
Ten Stanford players, includ
ing starters McCaffrey, Chuck
Gillingham, John Hopkins, Kevin
Scott and Jono Tunney will be
playing their last game in Stan
ford Stadium today. They would
undoubtedly like to close their
home careers with a victory.
And although Washington
State has downed the Cardinal in
their last two meetings, Price feels
that "it's going to be a very com
petitive game. Obviously, on any
given Saturday, they can beat any
team in the country."

McCaffrey and Co. are hoping
another long-awaited "given Sat
urday" will turn out to be today.

If Stanford is to break out of its recent scoring slump and produce a victory today, the team's running
attack has to find new life. Charlie Young (above) and the rest of his backfield mates are hoping to find
new life against the Couger's rushing defense, ranked sixth in the Pac-10.
Anytime you hear a head coach
talk about "playing a game for
pride," you can be certain the
matchup has minimal impact on
anyone but the two combatants.
Unfortunately, that's exactly
the way Washington State coach
Mike Price described today's game
against the Cardinal, and few
observers outside of Palo Alto and
Pullman will pay much notice to
the outcome.
Still, Price is quick to describe
the significance of this game to his
Cougars (2-3, 3-5 overall).
"Our goal is to have a winning
season. We need to sweep our last
three games, and the first step to
that is to beat Stanford," he said.
Stanford stands at 1-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference and 2-6
overall after suffering their sec
ond blowout in as many weeks, a
31-0 flogging at the hands of Ore
gon. Coach Denny Green had little
explanation for the Cardinal's
recent lack of scoring punch.
"We're just out of sync right
now, plain and simple," he said.
"This week we're hoping to find
that missing link."
They're also hoping to stay out
of the Pac-10 cellar. Stanford
enters today's action in ninth
place and Washington State is sev
enth. A loss today could make
either school a serious contender
to wrestle the bottom spot from
Arizona State.
"These are two programs fight
ing for respectability in a tough
conference," Price said. "It's
going to be a dogfight."
Indeed, with the conference's
top two rated quarterbacks facing
off, today's game promises to be
an aerial battle.
Washington State enters the
game with a potent passing
attack, ranked first in the Pac-10
(259.9 yards per game) and 14th
in the nation. They will put Stan
ford's shaky secondary, ranked
last in conference pass-defense
efficiency, to a severe test.
The Cougars seem to be
attempting to replace Stanford as
the Pac-10's "Quarterback U." as
they add freshman sensation

Drew Bledsoe's name to a list of
stars which include current NFL
starters Mark Rypien (Redskins)
and Timm Rosenbach (Cardinals).
Price had nothing but praise
for the true freshman, though he
concedes the decision two weeks
ago to make him a starter was a
difficult one.
"I was hesitant to take out our
senior team captain Brad Gossen,
but when Drew stepped in things
just clicked," he said. "Drew has a
strong arm, quick release, avoids
the rush well and has the ability
to make the big play. He's playing
very well for a true freshman, as a
matter of fact, he's playing very
well for a senior."
And a mighty fine senior, at
that. Last week against Arizona,
the 6-foot-5 Bledsoe led a furious
comeback which saw the Cougars
score 24 second half points to fall
just short of victory, 42-34. He
threw for the third highest total in
Washington State history (385
yards) and scored two touch
downs, including one on a pass to
himself which bounced into his
arms off a lineman's helmet.
The Washington State passing
attack has also led the team to a
record 72-game scoring streak.
The Cougars have not been
blanked since a 44-0 loss to Ohio
State in 1984.
On the other side of the ball,
neither the skies nor the score
board have not been so friendly of
late.
Jason Palumbis will start for
Green at quarterback, although
he has been replaced in the second
half by John Lynch the past two
weeks.
Still, Palumbis has managed to
maintain his spot as the confer
ence's second-leading passer (224
yards per game) and will look
downfield to the Pac-10's top two
receivers, Ed McCaffrey and Glyn
Milburn.
But the running game (or lack
thereof) has hampered Stanford's
efficiency through the air in
recent games. A paltry average of
58.4 rushing yards per game over
the past five weeks has left the
offense completely one-dimen
sional.

Green knows things must
change.
"Other teams gained an advan
tage against Washington State by
running the ball; we need to be
able to run," he said. "We have an
explosive back in Milburn and we
need to get him into their sec
ondary."

If the Cardinal offense is look
ing for big yardage plays, they've
hooked up with the right team.
Last weekend, the Cougars gave
up a touchdown to Arizona after
just two plays from scrimmage,
and they currently rank ninth in
the conference in both total
defense (427 yards per game) and
opponents third down efficiency
(45.7 percent).
Green agrees that big plays
could be the key, and he has seen

his squad recently on the short
end of too many of them.
"We simply cannot give up big
plays on defense," he said. "It's
plagued us all year."
