# Chalk Talk: Sweep around end
## 
### 
It is the same old story: Stanford must run the ball to win this game. Denny Green has been
relying on his all-purpose star Glyn Milburn all season long to get the Cardinal ground attack
going, and today should be no different. The play described above is a basic sweep that is
designed to utilize Milburn's speed, and hopefully get him in the open field where he is at his
most dangerous. Milburn takes the pitch from quarterback Jason Palumbis and runs left
behind the lead block of fullback Tommy Vardell. If all goes well, Milburn will beat the
linebackers to the corner of the line of scrimmage and be able to cut up-field and penetrate the
defensive secondary. Once Milburn gets in the open field, anything is possible.
