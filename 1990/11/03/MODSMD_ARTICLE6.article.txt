# Lynch looks for time on diamond and turf

"During football season, my head is in
football. During baseball season, my head is
in baseball. I don't know which sport I like
better. I honestly love them both."
No, Bo does not know Stanford. These
are the words of quarterback John Lynch,
the Cardinal's only current baseball-foot
ball double athlete.

Lynch, a sophomore out of Torrey Pines
High School in Solana Beach, Calif., was
one of the most highly recruited quarter
backs in the nation in 1988. His junior year,
he passed for 1,282 yards and 15 touch
downs, winning most valuable player hon
ors on his team.

A broken right fibula kept him out of
action for all but six quarters of his senior
year. Despite throwing only 62 passes all
season, Lynch was recruited by Notre
Dame, USC and Stanford, among countless
others.

The question which immediately sur
faces is this: Why would a football super
star choose Stanford over perennial power
houses like Notre Dame and USC?

"I didn't come here just for the educa
tion," Lynch said. "Denny Green had just
been named head coach, and I really felt
that he was going to shake things up, and
turn the program around."
While Lynch's statement may seem sur
prising, it signifies a new attitude in Cardi
nal football, an attitude which remains
upbeat despite the team's recent slump.
The quarterback tried to downplay the last
three blowouts.

"Sure, we're all trying to figure out what
has been going wrong," the true sophomore
said. "But we're still practicing well, and
everyone is looking forward to Washington
State."

Lynch himself has yet to receive a chance
to truly test himself on the collegiate level.
As a third-string freshman last year, he
played in three games, completing 7 of 14
passes for 45 yards.
Before the start of the current season,
Green made it clear that the job of starting
quarterback was wide open, and Lynch
responded by moving up on the Cardinal
depth chart. Coming out of spring practice,
Lynch was listed second behind Jason
Palumbis, the 1988 starting quarterback.
Backing them both up was Steve Smith, the

starter for much of 1989.
So far in 1990, this setup has not
changed. While Palumbis has started all 8
games, Lynch has seen considerable playing
time, coming off the bench to complete 10
of 25 passes for 184 yards and 2 intercep
tions.

Though he is considered the team's sec
ond-string quarterback, the fact that the
offense has scored only 26 points in the last
10 quarters makes anything possible.
"Lately, I've been getting more and more
time in on the field. I realize that anything
can happen, and I'm ready to play if Jason
is hurt, or if he isn't getting things going,"
Lynch said.
Green echoed those thoughts. "I won't
hesitate to use John in any game situa
tions," the second year coach said. "He's a
great athlete who just needs some experi
ence."

Despite the competitive nature of the
quarterback position, the sophomore
stressed that this was not an uncomfortable
situation.

"Obviously it's competitive; we all want
to play," Lynch said. "But I think that we
redly try to help each other out, in both
practice and in the games. We're all good
friends both on and off the field."

With redshirt freshmen Tommy Knecht
and Steve Stenstrom entering the picture,
the Cardinal could hypothetically carry five
quarterbacks on their roster next year.
Even this doesn't phase Lynch.
"Wherever you go in college football, you
expect there to be lots of competition at
quarterback. You can't spend all of your
time worrying about everyone around you,"
Lynch said. "I look forward to a winning
season next year more than anything else."
The two-sport athlete has also set team
and personal goals for the remainder of the
season.

"We need to win our last three games to
send the seniors off with something to
remember," Lynch said. "I'd personally like
to persuade the coaches to give me some
more field time."

He probably should not complain. Due to
the nature of his sports, Lynch gets to
spend plenty of time on the field.
As a baseball player in 1990, Lynch saw
action in five games for a team that finished
with a 59-12 record and placed third in the
College World Series. He was 1 for 5, his

only hit a home run against the University
of San Francisco of Jan. 31. Lynch, who can
play third base, designated hitter, outfield
or pitcher, skipped the majority of the base
ball season, concentrating on football dur
ing spring practice.
Lynch remains unsure what he will do
this March.
"Last year, the baseball team was so
stacked that it would have been hard for me

to break the lineup," Lynch said. "This
year, I think that I've got a good shot at
playing somewhere in baseball. I have yet to
decide which sport I will play this spring."
But overall, Lynch remains dedicated to
his scholarship sport.
"Right now, I'm thinking football.
Despite the last few games, I really think
that Stanford football has a great future."

After virtual obscuity last year, John Lynch has proven a solid back-up to starter
Jason Palumbis, and has come off the bench several times this year to take over the
Cardinal offense. After the football season is over, the true sophomore will hand off
his helmet for a glove and take to Sunken Diamond.
