# Freshman Bledsoe moves into top QB spot
## 
### Peter Blum Staff writer 
The controversy: Washington
State quarterback.
The players in question: (a)
senior Brad Gossen; (b) sopho
more Aaron Garcia; (c) freshman
Drew Bledsoe.

It all began in the sixth week of
the season with the then 2-3
Cougars were playing USC. Wash
ington State coach Mike Price
planned to use all three quarter
backs in particular situations
according to each athlete's
strengths Gossen, on the short
passing patterns; Garcia, on the
run; and Bledsoe, in long yardage
situations.

The 30-17 loss was not an unfa
miliar event for Washington
State, but the game gave Price an
opportunity to evaluate the pla
tooned efforts of his three quar
terbacks. And the performance of
Bledsoe did not slip his mind.
"The offense just wasn't click
ing with Brad [Gossen]. He had
numerous opportunities, but we
weren't scoring, winning, or mov
ing the ball like I wanted," Price
said.

"When Aaron [Garcia] came
into the game, the offense didn't
click either, but when Drew [Bled
soe] came into the game the
offense did click."

Taking control of the Cougar
offense in the fourth quarter, the
true freshman Bledsoe responded
by throwing for one touchdown
and running for another.
The decision was made.
Bledsoe would start against
Oregon State the following week.

"We needed to win and to beat
Oregon State, and I felt like Drew
would give us the best opportu
nity," Price said.
Price's decision to start Bled
soe ahead of the veterans Gossen
and Garcia was a heated one. Con
sider the facts: (1) Gossen, a
senior and the captain of the
team, was stripped of his starting
role despite having competent
statistics, good enough for a No. 5
rating in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence; and (2) Garcia was the
starter for the vast majority of
last year while being the top rated
passer in the Pac-10. One can see
that the quarterback bubble could
have easily burst in Price's face.
But it did not.

Starting his first collegiate
game, Bledsoe, the 6-foot-5, 220-
pound thrower from Walla Walla,
Wash., played like a gamer with
three touchdown passes and one
running score en route to a 53-22
dismantling of the Beavers.
With Bledsoe at the reins, the
tables appeared to be turning for
the Cougars as they entered last
Saturday's game against Arizona.
However, Washington State fell
behind in the early going and
appeared on the road to another
grisly loss, but Bledsoe woke up in
the second half. Despite the
Cougars ultimately losing 42-34,
Bledsoe led the Cougars to 24 sec
ond-half points with two touch
down passes and even a freak
touchdown catch.

Bledsoe fired his pass, watched
it bounce off of the line and alertly
caught the deflected pass at the 3-
yard line and ran it into the end
zone, ensuring that he would get

his time on national highlight
films.
By the end of the afternoon,
Bledsoe had lit up the skies for
385 yards.
Despite his team's loss and its
fall to 3-5 on the year, Price had

nothing but laudatory words for
his young quarterback.
"The biggest thing he showed
was his head and spirit," Price
commented. "He was rattled and
banged around in the first half
and he came out in the second half

taking control, being aggressive,
very competitive and making
things happen."
And now it seems that the con
troversy is settled.

How obscure is Drew Bledsoe? The WSU press guide does not even carry a photo of him, and actually,
the only picture his school has of the Couger starter is the rather unspectactular shot that runs on the
cover. This graphic may not tell you what Bledsoe looks like, but lately his game has been speaking for
himself.
On Thursday, Gossen under
went shoulder surgery and is out
for the remainder of the season.
All that now remains between
Bledsoe and an assured starting
role is Garcia.
Yet Garcia has not taken his
second-string role lightly.
"His personality reflects the
way he plays," Price said. "He's a
gambling, go-for-it guy and he's
not happy about not playing."
Bledsoe knows that Garcia is
hungry to play.
"Our game against Stanford
will be my third start, but I know
that if I play terrible Aaron will go
in and take over," he said.
Despite having Garcia gnawing
from behind, it is remarkable to
observe Bledsoe's trip from the
limelight to backstage to the lime
light again.
In one year he has gone from
setting the Washington state high
school record with 509 yards pass
ing in one game to starting his
third consecutive Pac-10 contest.
Not too bad for an athlete who
thought that he would redshirt

his freshman year.
"I went home last week to
watch my high school's football
game, and I still can't believe that
I am playing college ball today,"
Bledsoe said.
As the season progressed, Price
watched Bledsoe "get better and
better" and thought: "If he's this
good why waste a redshirt on him
so we can redshirt him for the
pros?"
The idea was that Bledsoe
would play in junior varsity games
gaining experience while backing
up Gossen and Garcia in order to
challenge the latter for the start
ing role next year.
But, as Price said, "That's not
the way it worked out. After the
season started, I thought, hey,
he's what we need right now."
"The biggest problem was that
the team didn't have confidence in
me as a freshman," Bledsoe said.
"But I am comfortable now. I
think that I've gained the accep
tance of the team and the
coaches."

Today, Bledsoe will have the
chance to expand his comfort zone
by firing through the Cardinal
secondary on the turf at Stanford
Stadium.
