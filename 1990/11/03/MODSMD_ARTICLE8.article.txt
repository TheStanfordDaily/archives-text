# WSU/Stanford Matchups
## 
### 
Jason Hanson is a kicking
machine. The All-America
punter/kicker holds the WSU
school scoring record with 255
points. Hanson also leads the Pac
-10, and is third nationally in punt
ing at 46.1 yards an attempt. In
his career, Hanson has had 12
punts of 50 yards or longer as well
as 12 field goals of 50 yards or
longer, so even bad field position
could still produce points for the
Cougars.

All season long the Cardinal
has had to stop the run to be suc
* cessful, and this week's enemy
back is Shaumbe Wright-Fair.
Along with his impressive name,
Wright-Fair also has impressive
stats. Currently the Pac-10's sev
enth ranked running back at 77.5
yards a game, the 6-foot-l, 213-
pound running back will test
Stanford's defense all day. Trying
to stop Wright-Fair will be
linebacker Jono Tunney, the Car
dinal's co-leader in tackles with 59
total stops. Tunney has had injury
problems, but the 6-2, 240-pound
defender should be strong enough
to help stop the Cougars.

Even though special teams play
has been known to win football
games, Glyn Milburn will have to
be more successful running the
ball behind the offensive line than
running it behind the punt or kick
return teams. Milburn is second
in the nation, and leads the Pac
-10, in all-purpose yardage at 191.6
yards a game. The problem is that
on the average only 42.3 of those
yards come from rushing the ball.
The Cardinal running game must
get untracked if the offense is to
score. Hoping to keep Stanford's
running attack mired in its cur
rent slump is middle linebacker
Curt Newton.

With Washington State quar
terback Drew Bledsoe currently
rated as the Pac-10's most effi
cient passer, it will be no surprise
that tight end Clarence Williams
will see some passes today.
Williams is tied for fourth in the
conference in receptions with 35
and is also leading the Cougars in
receiving yardage with 499 yards
to date. The best way to stifle
Bledsoe's game is to take out his
receivers, a job that safety Jimmy
Klein will be taking very seriously
today. The hard hitting Klein has
shown improvement in his pass
coverage and has, recorded two
interceptions so far this season.

Stanford has thrown the ball
more than they would like this
season, but the increased air
attack has only served to highlight
the talents of Ed McCaffrey. The
preseason Ail-American is looking
to make that title stick until the
end of the year as the fourth
ranked receiver in the land.
McCaffrey has hauled down 48
receptions for 677 yards and 14.1
yards a catch. Last week the
senior had a 52-yarder against
Oregon, but only wound up with
five catches for 87 yards. McCaf
frey must have a better game

Without a doubt, when most
American students think about
the premier college towns, these
two metropolises come immedi
ately to mind. Stanford students
have a tendency to complain
about Palo Alto night life, but
before they get too discouraged
consider the option of living in
Pullman, first established as a
Utopian community. An exciting
night in Pullman means a full sta
tion wagon journeying across the
border to Moscow, Idaho, to the
experience the party atmosphere
and the wildlife of the U of I.
