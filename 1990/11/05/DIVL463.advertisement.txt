Apple intrcxiuces the Macintosh Classic.
Trying to stretch dollars when you're
computer shopping doesn't mean you're willing
to make sacrifices.
That's why you should consider the new,
affordable Macintosh 30 Classic® computer.
It has everything you need —including a monitor, keyboard, mouse,
2 megabytes of RAM, and a 40-megabyte hard disk. Just plug everything in and
the Macintosh Classic is ready to run, because the system software is already
installed! And, thanks to the Macintosh computer's legendary ease of use, you'll
be up and running in no time.
Like every Macintosh, the Classic can run thousands of available applications
that all work in the same, consistent way—so once you've learned one program,
you're well on your way to learning them all. And this is one cheap roommate
that doesn't have trouble sharing. The Apple® Super Drive™ —standard
equipment with every Macintosh—reads from and writes to Macintosh,
