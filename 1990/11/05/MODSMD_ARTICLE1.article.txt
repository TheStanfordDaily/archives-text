In a weekend-long event that several participants
called "intense," the COP gathered 79 student lead
ers from across the Stanford community for its first
ever Leadership Summit.
Students at the summit said its most important
aspects were the participants' eagerness to listen to
each other and the formation of new contacts
between communities.
"I thought the conference was incredibly inspir
ing," said senior Sarah Fiarman, a resident assistant
in Roble Hall. "It was a rare opportunity to see so
many different members of different communities
coming together and making a sincere effort to listen
to each other and, most importantly, to learn from
one another."
Some possibilities for intergroup activities that
came out of the summit include joint Intersorority
Council-Women's Center programs and a coalition
between Stanford-in-Govemment and other student
groups to present programs on public policy issues.
"There's no question that the summit suc
ceeded," said Council of Presidents member Good
win Liu, who coordinated the event. Liu said he mar
veled at the stamina of participants, who spent at
least 18 hours at the summit over three days.
The summit began Friday afternoon at the Bech
tel International Center with icebreakers and a
game called "Constituency Pursuit" which chal
lenged participants to find other students who knew
answers to questions such as the meaning of the

Hawaiian word "Ho'oikaika" and the number of
campus RAs.
Saturday's sessions at Hoover House, the home of
University President Donald Kennedy, began with a
program about community goals.
Participants split up into 20 groups â€” one for
each community represented at the summit.
Each group wrote two lists on large pieces of
paper which were then taped to the wall. One list
identified community goals for the rest of the year,
and the other identified the obstacles to those goals.
Liu said the lists revealed the similarities among
the different communities. "It showed how interde
pendent we are. Image and perception appeared as
obstacles very frequently. We need each other."
Greg Ricks, multicultural programmer for Resi
dential Education, said he heard participants talk of
the "amazement of their similarities."
During the morning session, participants also dis
cussed division within their communities, according
to COP member Jamie Green. She also said several
students expressed "incredible frustration" with the
overabundance of programs available to students
with limited time.
After lunch, the summit broke up into three
groups, each of which discussed multiculturalism.
The groups read a seven-sentence definition of mul
ticulturalism and attempted to rewrite it.
Green said many participants "agreed with the
definition of multiculturalism but disagreed on its
implementation." She also said some discussion cen
tered on the issue of interaction with other groups as

House, discussing Issues ranging from multlcuituraiism to public service to leadership.
