# Summit forges new links

### David Bianco Editorial staff 
In a weekend-long event that several participants
called "intense," the COP gathered 79 student lead
ers from across the Stanford community for its first
ever Leadership Summit.
Students at the summit said its most important
aspects were the participants' eagerness to listen to
each other and the formation of new contacts
between communities.
"I thought the conference was incredibly inspir
ing," said senior Sarah Fiarman, a resident assistant
in Roble Hall. "It was a rare opportunity to see so
many different members of different communities
coming together and making a sincere effort to listen
to each other and, most importantly, to learn from
one another."
Some possibilities for intergroup activities that
came out of the summit include joint Intersorority
Council-Women's Center programs and a coalition
between Stanford-in-Govemment and other student
groups to present programs on public policy issues.
"There's no question that the summit suc
ceeded," said Council of Presidents member Good
win Liu, who coordinated the event. Liu said he mar
veled at the stamina of participants, who spent at
least 18 hours at the summit over three days.
The summit began Friday afternoon at the Bech
tel International Center with icebreakers and a
game called "Constituency Pursuit" which chal
lenged participants to find other students who knew
answers to questions such as the meaning of the

Hawaiian word "Ho'oikaika" and the number of
campus RAs.
Saturday's sessions at Hoover House, the home of
University President Donald Kennedy, began with a
program about community goals.
Participants split up into 20 groups — one for
each community represented at the summit.
Each group wrote two lists on large pieces of
paper which were then taped to the wall. One list
identified community goals for the rest of the year,
and the other identified the obstacles to those goals.
Liu said the lists revealed the similarities among
the different communities. "It showed how interde
pendent we are. Image and perception appeared as
obstacles very frequently. We need each other."
Greg Ricks, multicultural programmer for Resi
dential Education, said he heard participants talk of
the "amazement of their similarities."
During the morning session, participants also dis
cussed division within their communities, according
to COP member Jamie Green. She also said several
students expressed "incredible frustration" with the
overabundance of programs available to students
with limited time.
After lunch, the summit broke up into three
groups, each of which discussed multiculturalism.
The groups read a seven-sentence definition of mul
ticulturalism and attempted to rewrite it.
Green said many participants "agreed with the
definition of multiculturalism but disagreed on its
implementation." She also said some discussion cen
tered on the issue of interaction with other groups as

opposed to focusing on one's own
culture.
Liu said his group discussed
the emphasis of New Student Ori
entation on multicultural issues
and the need to "bring more peo
ple into the process" of planning
Orientation.
At one point during the sum
mit, Ricks asked members of the
group if they thought their grand
parents were fundamentally
racist. "Almost everyone put their
hand up," he said. "One (dis
abled) student put his leg up."
Ricks said, "If you live just [in
your own community], that's a
tragedy."
The next session focused on
public service, and students dis
cussed the kinds of service pro
jects their communities were
involved in.
"There was a real challenge to
the use of the word 'philanthropy'
by Greek organizations," Ricks
said. The word sounded to some
students like a gift and implied
that the donors would not get
anything back for their efforts, he
said.
For the final afternoon session,
observers recorded details of the
leadership dynamics exhibited in
an exercise in which the group
had to rank the order of steps to

start a business. Green said most
of the groups worked by consen
sus.
But the program many stu
dents found to be the most power
ful during the summit was the
"Talking Circle" Saturday night.
The Talking Circle is a Native
American tradition in which par
ticipants are encouraged to
express their inner thoughts in an
open way.
"It brought the day together,"
Ricks said. "People were being so
candid and taking the tradition
seriously and tried to live the tra
dition."
Green also had high praise for
the exercise. "It was multicultur
alism at its best," she said. "Peo
ple [gathered] together in a room •
as equals and everybody listened
intensely to everybody else, and
that's what it's all about."
The summit reconvened yes
terday at the I-Center for a goal
setting session. Although the ses
sion was optional, all but 12 of the
original participants returned to
end the summit.
Some of the concrete ideas that
came out of the session included
an intergroup newsletter, mail
boxes in the ASSU office for the
groups to use to contact each
other and a yearly summit.
In addition, several students
volunteered to prepare a report of
the results of the summit, which
will be available by the end of the
quarter, Liu said.

ing," said senior Sarah Fiarman, a resident assistant
in Roble Hall. "It was a rare opportunity to see so
many different members of different communities
coming together and making a sincere effort to listen
to each other and, most importantly, to learn from
one another."
Some possibilities for intergroup activities that
came out of the summit include joint Intersorority
Council-Women's Center programs and a coalition
between Stanford-in-Govemment and other student
groups to present programs on public policy issues.
"There's no question that the summit suc
ceeded," said Council of Presidents member Good
win Liu, who coordinated the event. Liu said he mar
veled at the stamina of participants, who spent at
least 18 hours at the summit over three days.
The summit began Friday afternoon at the Bech
tel International Center with icebreakers and a
game called "Constituency Pursuit" which chal
lenged participants to find other students who knew
answers to questions such as the meaning of the

Hawaiian word "Ho'oikaika" and the number of
campus RAs.
Saturday's sessions at Hoover House, the home of
University President Donald Kennedy, began with a
program about community goals.
Participants split up into 20 groups — one for
each community represented at the summit.
Each group wrote two lists on large pieces of
paper which were then taped to the wall. One list
identified community goals for the rest of the year,
and the other identified the obstacles to those goals.
Liu said the lists revealed the similarities among
the different communities. "It showed how interde
pendent we are. Image and perception appeared as
obstacles very frequently. We need each other."
Greg Ricks, multicultural programmer for Resi
dential Education, said he heard participants talk of
the "amazement of their similarities."
During the morning session, participants also dis
cussed division within their communities, according
to COP member Jamie Green. She also said several
students expressed "incredible frustration" with the
overabundance of programs available to students
with limited time.
After lunch, the summit broke up into three
groups, each of which discussed multiculturalism.
The groups read a seven-sentence definition of mul
ticulturalism and attempted to rewrite it.
Green said many participants "agreed with the
definition of multiculturalism but disagreed on its
implementation." She also said some discussion cen
tered on the issue of interaction with other groups as

opposed to focusing on one's own
culture.
Liu said his group discussed
the emphasis of New Student Ori
entation on multicultural issues
and the need to "bring more peo
ple into the process" of planning
Orientation.
At one point during the sum
mit, Ricks asked members of the
group if they thought their grand
parents were fundamentally
racist. "Almost everyone put their
hand up," he said. "One (dis
abled) student put his leg up."
Ricks said, "If you live just [in
your own community], that's a
tragedy."
The next session focused on
public service, and students dis
cussed the kinds of service pro
jects their communities were
involved in.
"There was a real challenge to
the use of the word 'philanthropy'
by Greek organizations," Ricks
said. The word sounded to some
students like a gift and implied
that the donors would not get
anything back for their efforts, he
said.
For the final afternoon session,
observers recorded details of the
leadership dynamics exhibited in
an exercise in which the group
had to rank the order of steps to

start a business. Green said most
of the groups worked by consen
sus.
But the program many stu
dents found to be the most power
ful during the summit was the
"Talking Circle" Saturday night.
The Talking Circle is a Native
American tradition in which par
ticipants are encouraged to
express their inner thoughts in an
open way.
"It brought the day together,"
Ricks said. "People were being so
candid and taking the tradition
seriously and tried to live the tra
dition."
Green also had high praise for
the exercise. "It was multicultur
alism at its best," she said. "Peo
ple [gathered] together in a room •
as equals and everybody listened
intensely to everybody else, and
that's what it's all about."
The summit reconvened yes
terday at the I-Center for a goal
setting session. Although the ses
sion was optional, all but 12 of the
original participants returned to
end the summit.
Some of the concrete ideas that
came out of the session included
an intergroup newsletter, mail
boxes in the ASSU office for the
groups to use to contact each
other and a yearly summit.
In addition, several students
volunteered to prepare a report of
the results of the summit, which
will be available by the end of the
quarter, Liu said.
In a weekend-long event that several participants
called "intense," the COP gathered 79 student lead
ers from across the Stanford community for its first
ever Leadership Summit.
Students at the summit said its most important
aspects were the participants' eagerness to listen to
each other and the formation of new contacts
between communities.
