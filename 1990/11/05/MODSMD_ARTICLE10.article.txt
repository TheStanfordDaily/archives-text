Peter Pan actress dies
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.
(AP) — Mary Martin, the
spunky actress who flew across
the Broadway stage and the
nation's television screens as
Peter Pan, has died of cancer.
She was 76.
Martin died Saturday at her
Rancho Mirage home, near
Palm Springs, publicist
Richard Grant said yesterday.

Grant repre
sents Martin's
son, Larry
Hagman.
Martin,
who captivat
ed audiences
with her ebul
lient personal
ity and joyous
singing in

such musicals as "South
Pacific," "The Sound of
Music," "I Do! I Do!" and "One
Touch of Venus," was one of
the New York theaters' leading
ladies for more than 30 years.
"I'm going to spend the rest
of my life missing her. There's
nobody like her. She's a great
lady and a great presence on
the stage," said actress Carol
Channing, who co-starred in
Martin's last play "Legends!"
Channing visited Martin hours
before her death.
Martin "was sensational all
her life — whether she was
Peter Pan, Nellie Forbush,
Annie Oakley or Maria Von
Trapp. I loved her dearly, and I
shall miss her," said Dorothy
Rodgers, widow of Richard
Rodgers, who wrote music for
"South Pacific" and"The
Sound of Music."
"The bright light and good
cheer that Mary brought to the
world will not fade merely

because of her absence," said
William Hammerstein, son of
Oscar Hammerstein 11, who
wrote the lyrics for "South
Pacific" and"The Sound of
Music."
Martin is perhaps best
remembered for her portrayal
on stage and television of Peter
Pan, the boy who never wanted
to grow up.
"All my life, I wanted to be
Peter Pan," Martin once said.
"My poor mother never knew
what I was going to do next. I
don't think anything ever sur
prised my parents. I was
always doing something
strange — like at 5, jumping off
the garage. I wanted to fly, and
all I did was break my collar
bone."
Martin, who was born Dec.
1, 1913, made her first stage
appearance singing at a fire
man's ball in her hometown of
Weatherford, Texas. Her father
was a lawyer and her mother a
violin teacher.
After a year at the Univer
sity of Texas, Martin married
Benjamin Hagman in 1930.
They divorced the following
year after the birth of her son
Larry, best known for his role
as J.R. Ewing on televisions'
"Dallas."
Marin made her profes
sional debut as a nightclub
vocalist in Hollywood. It was
there that she was discovered
by producer Charles Schwab,
who put her in Cole Porter's
"Leave It to Me."
The musical, which opened
on Broadway in 1938, made the
unknown performer a star.
Each night she stopped the
show by doing a coy striptease
while singing the musical's
best-known song, "My Heart
Belongs to Daddy."
