# Israeli troops wound dozens of Arabs

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Troops wounded
dozens of Palestinians Sunday and ordered
curfews across the Gaza Strip. Government
leaders dismissed as "one-sided" a U.N. call for
international protection of Arabs under Israeli
occupation.
Israel radio said 86 Palestinians were
injured in widespread clashes following the
death of a jailed Palestinian, while Arab
reports said 70 were hurt. The army put the
number at 27 and said it was checking the
other figures.
A Foreign Ministry statement castigated
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuel
lar for his report Thursday in which he sug
gested broadening the mandate of U.N. insti
tutions in Israel to safeguard the 1.7 million
Palestinians under occupation.
The report was produced as a recommenda
tion to the U.N. Security Council in response

to the killing Oct. 8 of 20 Palestinians on
Jerusalem's Temple Mount by Israeli authori
ties.
"The world community's continued preoc
cupation with this subject can only serve those
forces who are interested in creating a link
between the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Gulf
crisis," the statement said.
The statement assailed a proposal to con
vene the signatories of the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949, which sets out rules for
the treatment of civilians in wartime.
"Israel is disappointed at the one-sided
approach exhibited in the report," it said. "The
recommendations in the report are directed
only toward Israel and do not see fit to call for
a cessation of violence on the Palestinian side."
Israel has refused to accept a U.N. investi
gation into the Oct. 8 incident on Temple
Mount, a site holy to both Jews and Moslems.

Israel says the inquiry would undermine its
sovereignty in Jerusalem.
Israel had conducted its own investigation
and "extracted the necessary lessons," it said.
A government-appointed panel defended
the action by police, saying they faced a threat
to their lives.
Under the panel's recommendation, the
Cabinet set up a permanent seven-member
ministerial committee to oversee Temple
Mount affairs.
Police Minister Roni Milo upgraded
Jerusalem to a full police district Sunday, act
ing on the commission's recommendations.
MUo did not say if senior officers would be
transferred or fired.
About 350 officers will be added to
Jerusalem's 1,000-meter force and the public
will be encouraged to volunteer for the Civil
Guard.
