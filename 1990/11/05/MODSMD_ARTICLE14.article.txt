MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) â€”
Secretary of State James Baker
ventured into the desert of Saudi
Arabia yesterday to give a pep talk
to 4,200 U.S. troops who may be
ordered into combat against Iraq
if other pressure tactics do not
free Kuwait from Saddam Hus
sein's grasp.
The men and women who must
weather dust storms, searing heat
and boredom were mostly recep
tive to their distinguished visitor,
who was launching a fast-paced
survey of Arab, European and
Soviet sentiment for with
Iraq.
One soldier gave Baker a chew
of tobacco, another a package of
combat rations. Baker, a Texan
and ex-Marine, received both
offerings comfortably.
When Baker, who wore khakis
and worn cowboy boots, told
another soldier that the Saudi
desert was not much different
from Texas, the soldier politely
disagreed. "It's a little bit differ
ent," he said.
Baker arrived in Bahrain, the
financial hub of the Persian Gulf,
after a 15-hour flight from Wash
ington. He was whisked immedi
ately by helicopter across the bor
der to eastern Saudi Arabia, pass
ing over camels running wild in
the desert.

There, at a location censored by
Baker's staff, he addressed and
mingled with the soldiers from the
First Cavalry Division out of Fort
Hood, Texas. They are among
more than 110,000 defending the
Saudi oil fields and are equipped
with M-l tanks, Bradley fighting
vehicles, a multilaunch rocket sys
tem and shoulder-fired Stinger
missiles.
"This is a long way from
home," Baker told the troops.
"But I think that Americans are
home wherever our principles are.
And that'B really what this crisis
is all about."
As he stepped down from the
podium to mingle, a soldier took
the microphone and to the accom
paniment of the division band,
sang Lee Greenwood's song, "I'm
Proud to Be an American."
Afterward, Baker told
reporters traveling with him: "I
was pleased to see that the morale
is good. They all seemed to be
upbeat. The main question is
what the future holds. That is
something that cannot be
answered with any specificity."
Baker said as he flew here Sat
urday he was laying the founda
tion for stronger economic and
political measures against Iraq or
even military action.
