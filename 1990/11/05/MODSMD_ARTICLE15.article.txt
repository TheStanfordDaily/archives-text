# Texas gubernatorial candidates go to church

DALLAS (AP) â€” President Bush and
Democratic leaders lent their influence yester
day in the hotly contested race for Texas gov
ernor. The president accompanied Clayton
Williams to church and Democrat Ann
Richards courted minority voters with the
help of the nation's first elected black gover
nor.
Richards visited four black Baptist
churches here and later appeared at a rally
with former Congress woman Barbara Jordan
and Virginia Governor Doug Wilder.
"On Tuesday we are going to recapture cit
izen politics," Jordan told the crowd. "We are
black and white and red and all colors. We're
not going to be purchased by any millionaire
cowboy"
Rancher-oilman Williams and his family,

meanwhile, attended services with President
Bush at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in
Houston.
The president later made an appearance
before Republican campaign workers at a
phone bank.
The candidates continued to trade accusa
tions about income taxes. Richards attacked
Williams for not paying federal income tax in
1986 and Williams defended himself, adding
that he opposed a state income tax.
"The rich who can afford to pay taxes don't
and Clayton Williams is the epitome of that,"
Richards told a rally of about 1,000 supporters
at the Martin Luther King, Jr., Community
Center Gymnasium.
Williams, a millionaire with oil and ranch
ing interests, disclosed Friday that he paid no

federal income tax in 1986.
M I was fighting for my life in 1986. I didn't
pay any taxes because I didn't have any
income," he told reporters in Houston yester
day.
Richards said Williams had recovered
enough to bankroll his campaign.
"Four years later, he writes a personal
check for $8.5 million to buy the government,"
she said.
Williams said the real issue was whether
Richards would permit a state income tax.
Williams said he supported a constitutional
amendment prohibiting such a levy.
"I said I'd veto an income tax if it comes to
my desk," Williams said. Richards "won't say
if she will."
