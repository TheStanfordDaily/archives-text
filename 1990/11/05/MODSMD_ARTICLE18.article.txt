Tomorrow, Caiifomians
will cast their ballots for a
new governor, a host of state
officials and legislative representa
tives, and a full 28 statewide propo
sitions.
The issues are complex and
require individual study. From the
long list of races, The Daily's edito
rial board selected a few of the

Governor
& Dianne Feinstein

After months of mudslinging
and one of the most expensive cam
paigns in state history, Dianne
Feinstein and Pete Wilson have
battled nearly to a draw.
Both candidates are centrist,
somewhat indecisive and — hon
estly — boring.
They share many views. Both
are pro-choice. Both favor the
death penalty. Both oppose
offshore oil drilling. Both would
increase funding for the state cor
rections system.
Neither has addressed how his
or her administration would pay

Tom Campbell, the lower Penin

billion-dollar state budget deficit

In the end, the lukewarm
endorsement goes to Feinstein.
Some of her proposed social pro
grams are innovative, if not com
pletely flushed out. She is expected
to bring members of underrepre
sented groups into her administra
tion. And a Democrat in the gover
nor's seat will help clear up the
stalemate that has developed
between the governor and the
Democratic legislature in recent
years.

On gun-control legislation, abor
tion rights and the Civil Rights Act
of 1990, Campbell has proven to be
an independent thinker, not
merely a puppet of Republican
party bosses.
More than anything, though,
Campbell wins the endorsement
for lack of a better alternative. His
Democratic challenger, Robert
Palmer, has contributed to the dis
cussion of campaign issues only
through weak, unsubstantiated
attacks on Campbell, while offer
ing few ideas himself.

initiative, Prop. 128.
The proposition pretends to be
all things to all people, glibly
encompassing such diverse and
unrelated issues as pesticide use,
offshore oil drilling, chlorofluoro
carbon regulation and forests. Its
economic implications have been
widely questioned, and its success
ful implementation is doubtful.
Prop. 135 is political hot air
which presents a deliberately
impotent solution to the problem
of carcinogenic pesticides.
Prop. 130 bans clear-cutting of
forests in California. It allows
companies to cut timber only as
fast as the trees grow back, so
forests will last for generations.
Prop. 138, on the other hand, is
an attempt to kill Prop. 130. Sup
ported by the logging industry,
Prop. 138 pretends to be environ
mental legislation. It is a deceptive
proposition through which voters
will hopefully see.

Proposition 134 seeks to address
countless alcohol-related problems
by placing a significant tax —
roughly a nickel a beer — on alco
hol sales.
By contrast, alcohol manufac
turers support Prop. 126, a penny
a-beer tax whose revenue would go
to the state's general fund. This
weakened proposition goes against
the admirable goals of Prop. 134.

Propositions 131 and 140 are
poor attempts to curb the influence
of special-interest groups in state
government by limiting incumben
cy.
Although Californians might be
glad to lose a number of their "pro
fessional politicians," they would
also be losing good legislators and
officials.

On gun-control legislation, abor

initiative, Prop. 128.
The proposition pretends to be
all things to all people, glibly
encompassing such diverse and
unrelated issues as pesticide use,
offshore oil drilling, chlorofluoro
carbon regulation and forests. Its
economic implications have been
widely questioned, and its success
ful implementation is doubtful.
Prop. 135 is political hot air
which presents a deliberately
impotent solution to the problem
of carcinogenic pesticides.
Prop. 130 bans clear-cutting of
forests in California. It allows
companies to cut timber only as
fast as the trees grow back, so
forests will last for generations.
Prop. 138, on the other hand, is
an attempt to kill Prop. 130. Sup
ported by the logging industry,
Prop. 138 pretends to be environ
mental legislation. It is a deceptive
proposition through which voters
will hopefully see.

Proposition 134 seeks to address
countless alcohol-related problems
by placing a significant tax —
roughly a nickel a beer — on alco
hol sales.
By contrast, alcohol manufac
turers support Prop. 126, a penny
a-beer tax whose revenue would go
to the state's general fund. This
weakened proposition goes against
the admirable goals of Prop. 134.

Propositions 131 and 140 are
poor attempts to curb the influence
of special-interest groups in state
government by limiting incumben
cy.
Although Californians might be
glad to lose a number of their "pro
fessional politicians," they would
also be losing good legislators and
officials.

Governor
& Dianne Feinstein

After months of mudslinging
and one of the most expensive cam
paigns in state history, Dianne
Feinstein and Pete Wilson have
battled nearly to a draw.
Both candidates are centrist,
somewhat indecisive and — hon
estly — boring.
They share many views. Both
are pro-choice. Both favor the
death penalty. Both oppose
offshore oil drilling. Both would
increase funding for the state cor
rections system.
Neither has addressed how his

Tom Campbell, the lower Penin

for a second term in the House.
Perhaps the most notable
attribute of the Stanford law pro
