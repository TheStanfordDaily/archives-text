# Feinstein-Wilson contest hailed as 'most important race' in U.S.

### Janet Feldstein Staff writer 
Tuesday's gubernatorial election
between Democrat Dianne Feinstein and
Republican Pete Wilson will have a pro
found impact on the future of California
and perhaps the nation, according to
political experts.
This race has been closely watched by
Republicans and Democrats across the
entire country. According to Hoover
Institution senior fellow Martin Ander
son, "The California gubernatorial race is
without question the most important
race in the country. Whoever wins will be
a very viable candidate for president in

the 1996 elec
tion."
Current polls
show the candi
dates are almost
dead even in the
race. A recent

San Jose Mercury News poll gave U.S.
Senator Wilson an 8 percentage point
lead over Feinstein, a Stanford alumna,
but a Los Angeles Times poll said Wil
son's lead was only 1 percentage point.
Most experts say the election could go
either way. "The polls at this time can be
misleading," said Hoover senior fellow
Richard Burres. Burres said he believes
the deciding factor will be the voters who

Election

are still undecid
ed.
Recent polls
show 8 to 15 per
cent of voters are
currently unde
cided. According

to The San Francisco Chronicle, the
mtyority of these undecided voters are
Democrats and are likely to favor Fein
stein.
Anderson said he believes Wilson's
lead in the polls will translate into a vic
tory at the ballot box. "California voters
tend to lean toward the conservative
side," Anderson said. Because the candi
dates hold similar opinions on many

issues, the margin will be created by "ide
ological factors" which favor the more
conservative Wilson.
"There aren't any powerful issues that
divide [the candidates]Anderson said.
He argued there is little difference on the
candidates' positions on environment
and crime.
But not everyone agrees with Ander
son.
While Political Science Prof. John
Manley will not vote for either Feinstein
or Wilson, he said thinks Feinstein is a
superior candidate partially because she
supports Proposition 128 — "Big Green."
Feinstein has argued that her record
on civil rights and environmental policy is

better than the Republican senator's.
Manley said he cannot vote for a can
didate who supports the death penalty.
Instead, he is bypassing both gubernato
rial candidates and choosing the third
party "protest vote."
"I'm going to vote peace and freedom,"
said Manley. "I want no implication in the
death penalty."
On the issue of taxation, Anderson
said, "The odds are greater that taxes will
not be raised if Wilson is governor."
Although the candidates have been
busy trying to publicize their positions
and give themselves the victorious edge,
some people are afraid of the
impact of negative campaigning.
"The ads have been very dis
couraging," Burres said. "Right
now negative campaigning is hav
ing its day, but I think this is its
last hurrah.... People are getting
sick of it. At least I hope so."
"As long as [the campaign
advertisements] are truthful, it's
okay," said Anderson, adding that
today's idea of "rough campaign
ing" would have been considered
mild in earlier times. Anderson
also noted newspapers are keeping
tabs on the advertisements, help
ing to counter-balance misleading
advertising and limit possible neg
ative effects.
Manley is also not concerned by
negative campaigning. "Clean and
hard-hitting is better than namby
pamby and Sominex," he said.
