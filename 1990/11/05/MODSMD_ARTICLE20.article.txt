## Dull moon in the Quad 
### 
I AM NOW A TRUE Stanford woman,
at least according to that infamous
tradition known as Full Moon in the
Quad.
I confess. Against my better judgment
and sense of decorum, I trooped out to the
Quad in the freezing cold at around mid
night Friday wondering if my lips would
be graced by those of a male senior.
When I first heard about this rite of
initiation for freshmen into Stanfordom,
I imagined a romantic and tender
moment.
I, a typical freshman, would somehow
happen to be dating a senior. We would
happen to be strolling through the Quad
one night when the moon was full and
would happen to kiss at midnight just as
the clock tower began to chime.
What I found instead was a cold, collec
tive, methodical search for senior lips,
with the Stanford Band providing such
"mood music" as "Honky Tonk Woman."
While the Band blared away, I noticed
both seniors and freshmen on the prowl,
uttering queries of "Are you a senior?"
and "Are you a freshman?"
I did not actually observe anyone ask
ing to see proof of identification, though,
despite stories I had been told. Maybe
that's why there were people who I know
for sure were neither seniors nor fresh
men.
I considered exposing this sophomore
who lives down the hall from me. He said
that he missed Full Moon his freshman
year and thus felt obligated to make it up
this year.
Justice was served, however, because
he ended up not kissing anyone.

Like the other guys, he just strutted
around with his hands in his pockets,
cruising for prospective females. Mean
while, the women eyed the men in an
equally blatant manner.
The situation did not become any less
awkward when contact was finally estab
lished. The affair was conducted in a
brisk, businesslike manner. The two peo
ple looked at each other, nodded agree
ment, shrugged and touched lips.
In retrospect, the whole thing seems
rather silly and ludicrous, but it was still
amusing in a perverse sort of way. I had a
lot of fun just watching how people dealt
with the situation.
In fact, that's mostly why I went in the
first place: to observe. This is the truth; I
stand on my word as a true and honorable
Stanford woman.
I discovered that there are real tactics
to this all but indiscriminate kissing. To
begin with, my friends and I were careful
to separate ourselves from our non-kiss
able male freshman friends.
They went off in search of senior
women, who seemed to be in short supply.
Meanwhile, we scanned the crowd for
men who looked like they might be
seniors.
I was about to leave, being perfectly
content to be an artificial Stanford
woman.
Luckily, my friend spotted my advising
associate with a couple of her male senior
friends. Introductions were made, small
talk was exchanged, and then — smooch.
Both my friend and I got more than we
bargained for. Since there were two of
them, we both got kissed twice. I wonder

if that has any special significance. Does
that make us doubly real Stanford
women?
To be perfectly honest, I don't feel any
more real than I did before my encounter
with these senior men. The kisses were
brief and perfunctory — nothing earth
shattering.
I haven't figured out yet if I should be
ashamed at having subjected myself to
the Full Moon in the Quad experience. I
think it has to do with the idea of looking
at people as warm pairs of lips as opposed
to human beings with individual person
alities and emotions.
I, for example, have no distinct idea
who it was I kissed. I just know that they
were friends of my AA. I must admit,
however, that the anonymity, or near
anonymity, of the entire situation makes
it a lot easier to deal with.
I probably would not have kissed any
one I thought I might see again.
In any case, Full Moon was just part of
the Stanford experience: one complimen
tary kiss with purchase of $20,000.00 or
more.
Gee, I guess I really got my money's
worth, seeing how I got two kisses instead
of one.
