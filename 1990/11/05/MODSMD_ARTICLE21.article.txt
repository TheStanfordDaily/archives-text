Who is really served by *streamlining'?

WE WANT TO THANK The Daily
for its in-depth, investigative cov
erage of issues affecting workers
and the community.
We would like to raise the moral and
economic issues which were so important
that several of us committed civil disobe
dience in protest of the layoffs and were
arrested in August.
First, the many layers of highly paid
Tresidder directors, associate directors,
assistant directors and managers ran
Tresidder into the hole by creating a huge
deficit.
Their solution to the ensuing budget
squeeze was to preserve their positions
and pay raises and to eliminate members
of the United Stanford Workers who had
worked there from 10 to 28 years.
The practice of rewarding those who
make bad management decisions and of
punishing those who worked hard to keep
Tresidder physically running is both
uryust and shortsighted management.
Second, Tresidder's actions increase
the disparity between the "haves" and the
"have-nots" at Tresidder.
Third, when the management claimed
(we believe falsely) that they would save
more than $100,000 by eliminating eight
Stanford workers and replacing them
with other workers, we showed that
Tresidder could save the same amount by
consolidating and eliminating two man
agement positions. Management chose to
eliminate the workers.
In our opinion, Tresidder's layoff of
long-term workers was immoral and cost
ineffective. It was a self-serving move to
preserve positions and inflated salaries at
the expense of workers and ultimately of
students and community who bear the
cost.
Unfortunately, Tresidder is a micro
cosm of what is going on all over campus.
According to the San Jose Mercury
News, campus administrators who are
paid $100,000 to $200,000 per year gave
themselves hefty pay raises a year ago.

While some repositioning
has benefited the commu
nity, much of it has been
ill-conceived.

Shortly afterward, they declared auster
ity was needed because of a financial cri
sis they have never really explained.
They proceeded to cut the lowest-paid
non-exempt staff to the bone and increase
the work loads of remaining staff. The
result is an ever-growing disparity in pay
and working conditions between highly
paid administrators and managers on top,
and those on the bottom.
We support "streamlining" the Univer
sity and making it more efficient to keep
down tuition and indirect costs.
The question faculty and students
need to ask is: Does "repositioning"
achieve this? Is the elimination of lower
paid staff "streamlining," or is it the serv
ing of self-interest by those in high
administrative and managerial positions?
Donald Kennedy has said repositioning
has made the University "leaner." Does
cutting the workers or the muscle on the
bottom and keeping the fat on top make
the University "leaner" or does it make it
even less efficient, with greatly reduced
services to students and faculty, with
harm to workers and with little-reduced
costs?
The answer to us is only too clear. That
is why we are taking a stand against the
Tresidder layoffs and are fighting so hard
to prevent more injury to the community
at Stanford.
While some repositioning has bene
fited the community, much of it has been
ill-conceived, unjust and self-serving. The
Stanford community deserves much bet
ter!
