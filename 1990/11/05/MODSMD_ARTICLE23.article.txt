## Williamson Evers Why should the United States get out of the Gulf? Here are five reasons 
### 
• It'B unconstitutional.
Under the American Constitution,
unless there is a sudden attack on Ameri
can soil, Congress — and only Congress
— may authorize and begin acts of war.
The present U.S. military blockade of
Iraq is an act of war. An assault on Iraqi
held territory by U.S. troops would also be
an act of war. The Federalist Papers make
clear that the president's role as comman
der in chief gives him no power to initiate
hostilities abroad.
This is not mere quibbling about tech
nicalities and unimportant procedures.
The framers of the American Constitu
tion and the American statesmen of the
Revolutionary era knew from history that
heads of government tend to amass power
during foreign policy crises and in
wartime.
• If given free rein, politicians and
bureaucrats will use an occasion like the
Oulf crisis to consolidate their power and
expand the scope of their authority.
At the end of the Cold War, public offi
cials sought to shelter their national secu
rity programs and budgets under the
umbrella of the war on drugs. But the war
on drugs could not protect enough public
officials' turf.
How could national security policy
makers hang onto and expand the power,

influence, and money they wield without
a new post-Cold War foreign policy?
Nobody inside the Beltway cared about
Kuwait or thought a threat to Kuwait was
a threat to American national security
before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subse
quent annexation.
But once the Iraqi invasion occured,
those threatened by budget cuts and loss
of mtgor policy function saw their oppor
tunity.
Here was an incident where an Ameri
can response could define and crystallize
a major military role for the United
States in the post-Cold War world.
• It's not needed to keep oil flowing to
America at reasonable prices.
All the commentators in the news
media who think that current events
demonstrate that we need a powerful
energy czar and a "national energy pol
icy" are economic ignoramuses. They
should be sent to Bulgaria or Albania for
the rest of their lives to learn how well
such proposals work in practice.
President Bush's embargo and fear of
the effects of fighting have driven up the
price of oil well above any price that Iraq
sought before the Aug. 2 invasion or any
price that Iraq could conceivably com
mand if it seized not just Kuwait but the
oilfields of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf

states.
We have a capitalist market economy
that entices new sources into the market
when a supplier like Iraq tries to raise the
price of oil. Whoever controls oil supplies
(whether it is the Iraqi government, the
Kuwaiti government, the Saudi govern
ment or somebody else) has every incen
tive to sell that oil to meet the demand
from the industrial world and do so at
attractive prices.
• The "new world order," said to be at
hazard in the Gulf crisis, is a recipe for
endless foreign wars and foreign entan
glements.
The "new world order" means this:
U.S. forces would try to police the globe in
association with forces of like-minded
governments and those dependent on
U.S. foreign aid.
According to President Bush, now that
the Cold War is over, the United States
has a new global mission. That mission,
he says, is guarding against "instability
and unpredictability" in the world.
But such a boundless policy of global
meddling will be costly in American lives
and tax dollars and involve the United
States in many local and regional quar
rels around the world that pose no clear
and present danger to the American peo
ple.

• No vital national interest is at stake.
Iraq is not threatening to attack the
United States. The safety of those on
American soil is not in peril. Iraq is not
trying to seize American territory.
Wh&t exactly would American boys
and girls be dying for? For the sake of the
Saudi king? The Kuwaiti emir?
Is there a threat to the physical sur
vival of those under American jurisdici

ton, a threat to America's existence as an
independent country or a threat to the
liberties we er\joy under the American
Constitution?
Tell us — or bring the troops and ship
the planes home.

price that Iraq could conceivably com
mand if it seized not just Kuwait but the
oilfields of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf

states.
We have a capitalist market economy
that entices new sources into the market
when a supplier like Iraq tries to raise the
price of oil. Whoever controls oil supplies
(whether it is the Iraqi government, the
Kuwaiti government, the Saudi govern
ment or somebody else) has every incen
tive to sell that oil to meet the demand
from the industrial world and do so at
attractive prices.
• The "new world order," said to be at
hazard in the Gulf crisis, is a recipe for
endless foreign wars and foreign entan
glements.
The "new world order" means this:
U.S. forces would try to police the globe in
association with forces of like-minded
governments and those dependent on
U.S. foreign aid.
According to President Bush, now that
the Cold War is over, the United States
has a new global mission. That mission,
he says, is guarding against "instability
and unpredictability" in the world.
But such a boundless policy of global
meddling will be costly in American lives
and tax dollars and involve the United
States in many local and regional quar
rels around the world that pose no clear
and present danger to the American peo
ple.

• No vital national interest is at stake.
Iraq is not threatening to attack the
United States. The safety of those on
American soil is not in peril. Iraq is not
trying to seize American territory.
Wh&t exactly would American boys
and girls be dying for? For the sake of the
Saudi king? The Kuwaiti emir?
Is there a threat to the physical sur
vival of those under American jurisdici

ton, a threat to America's existence as an
independent country or a threat to the
liberties we er\joy under the American
Constitution?
Tell us — or bring the troops and ship
the planes home.
