## Cardinal vents its frustrations on Cougars, 31-13 McCaffrey burns WSU defense 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Stanford wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey had a career-best day
during Saturday's 31-13 Cardinal
victory over Washington State.
And for McCaffrey, a senior play
ing in his last home game for the
Cardinal, improving on his many
impressive games of the past is no
easy task.
But "Easy Ed," as Stanford
quarterback Jason Palumbis
refers to him, made it look effort
less while tallying three receiving
touchdowns and one rushing
touchdown. McCaffrey also had a
fourth receiving touchdown, his
most beautiful catch of the day,
disallowed when a referee incor
rectly called him out of bounds.
"The team came together, the
coaches had the confidence to go
to me, the line gave Jason protec
tion, the other receivers took the
pressure off me and it worked out
well," McCaffrey said. "Some
times it goes that way, some times
it doesn't."
On Saturday it was going
McCaffrey's way. Often.
Palumbis completed seven
passes to McCaffrey, who tallied
176 total receiving yards includ
ing touchdowns of 31, 34 and 69
yards. The Cardinal's entire
receiving corps enjoyed Washing
ton State's "bracketing," where
one receiver was left covered one
on-one so that others could be
double-covered.
"In different formations they'd
bracket either Pinck (receiver Jon
Pinckney) or Ed," Palumbis said
of the Cougars' defense. "When
they bracketed someone all I had
to do was find the receiver in man
coverage.
"I'm drooling when some
body's going to try to cover Ed
one-on-one. All I have to do is get
him the ball," Palumbis contin
ued. "You can't cover Ed McCaf
frey one-on-one. If you do you'll
get burned. He's the best receiver
in the country."
Though Palumbis and McCaf
frey didn't connect until under
three minutes remained in the
first quarter, the Cardinal quar
terback was busy dissecting Wash
ington State's bracketing defense.
When McCaffrey was double-cov

ered early on, Palumbis found
Pinckney deep for a 29-yard gain
on Stanford's first drive.
As Palumbis continued to find
the single-covered receiver, the
Cougars started shifting the dou
ble coverage to Pinckney and later
to wideout Chris Walsh, who in
the second half also came up with
two big receptions.
"I credit John and Chris."
McCaffrey said. "Early in the
game they were bracketing me
and Jason found the open man.
Then they shifted the bracket to
Pinckney or Chris and I got the
one-on-one."
And not a moment too soon.
After Washington State had
converted a Stanford turnover

into seven points to take a 10-0
lead, on the first Cardinal play
after the ensuing kickoff
Palumbis found McCaffrey
streaking down the left sideline.
As the Cougar defender stumbled
and fell, McCaffrey caught the
pass in stride and sprinted the
•rest of the 69 yards for the score.
"The big play whas when we
were down 10-0." Stanford.coach.
Denny Green said after the win.
"Ed made a great play down the
sideline. He came up with some
big plays all day."
That play started a Stanford
onslaught of 31 points that went
unanswered until late in the third
quarter. On Stanford's next drive,
McCaffrey scored a 2-yard rush

ing touchdown on an end around,
his first rushing touchdown since
high school.
His second-half touchdowns
were almost identical. Both were
on third-down plays, both in sin
gle coverage and both times
McCaffrey was wide open over the
middle behind the coverage.
McCaffrey was also denied a
spectacular second-quarter touch
down. On a Stanford first-and-10
play at the Cougars' 13-yard line,
Palumbis lofted a pass to the sin
gle-covered McCaffrey at the back
corner of the end zone. McCaffrey
leaped fully extended and caught
the ball with his fingers as he fell
backwards. The television replay
showed that he clearly landed

with one foot in the end zone, but
the official on the spot ruled that
McCaffrey caught the ball out of
bounds.
"I couldn't tell (if I was in
bounds or not)," McCaffrey said.
"I knew it was very close and my
left foot was on the ground. I
thought they'd give it to me but
the ref didn't agree. I don't know
if he was watching to see if I made
a clean catch but I guess he didn't
see my feet."
Palumbis, who threw for 353
yards on Saturday, couldn't say
enough about his favorite
receiver.

yards. The Cardinal's entire
receiving corps enjoyed Washing
ton State's "bracketing," where
one receiver was left covered one
on-one so that others could be
double-covered.
"In different formations they'd
bracket either Pinck (receiver Jon
Pinckney) or Ed," Palumbis said
of the Cougars' defense. "When
they bracketed someone all I had
to do was find the receiver in man
coverage.
"I'm drooling when some
body's going to try to cover Ed
one-on-one. All I have to do is get
him the ball," Palumbis contin
ued. "You can't cover Ed McCaf
frey one-on-one. If you do you'll
get burned. He's the best receiver
in the country."
Though Palumbis and McCaf
frey didn't connect until under
three minutes remained in the
first quarter, the Cardinal quar
terback was busy dissecting Wash
ington State's bracketing defense.
When McCaffrey was double-cov

ered early on, Palumbis found
Pinckney deep for a 29-yard gain
on Stanford's first drive.
As Palumbis continued to find
the single-covered receiver, the
Cougars started shifting the dou
ble coverage to Pinckney and later
to wideout Chris Walsh, who in
the second half also came up with
two big receptions.
"I credit John and Chris."
McCaffrey said. "Early in the
game they were bracketing me
and Jason found the open man.
Then they shifted the bracket to
Pinckney or Chris and I got the
one-on-one."
And not a moment too soon.
After Washington State had
converted a Stanford turnover

into seven points to take a 10-0
lead, on the first Cardinal play
after the ensuing kickoff
Palumbis found McCaffrey
streaking down the left sideline.
As the Cougar defender stumbled
and fell, McCaffrey caught the
pass in stride and sprinted the
•rest of the 69 yards for the score.
"The big play whas when we
were down 10-0." Stanford.coach.
Denny Green said after the win.
"Ed made a great play down the
sideline. He came up with some
big plays all day."
That play started a Stanford
onslaught of 31 points that went
unanswered until late in the third
quarter. On Stanford's next drive,
McCaffrey scored a 2-yard rush

ing touchdown on an end around,
his first rushing touchdown since
high school.
His second-half touchdowns
were almost identical. Both were
on third-down plays, both in sin
gle coverage and both times
McCaffrey was wide open over the
middle behind the coverage.
McCaffrey was also denied a
spectacular second-quarter touch
down. On a Stanford first-and-10
play at the Cougars' 13-yard line,
Palumbis lofted a pass to the sin
gle-covered McCaffrey at the back
corner of the end zone. McCaffrey
leaped fully extended and caught
the ball with his fingers as he fell
backwards. The television replay
showed that he clearly landed

with one foot in the end zone, but
the official on the spot ruled that
McCaffrey caught the ball out of
bounds.
"I couldn't tell (if I was in
bounds or not)," McCaffrey said.
"I knew it was very close and my
left foot was on the ground. I
thought they'd give it to me but
the ref didn't agree. I don't know
if he was watching to see if I made
a clean catch but I guess he didn't
see my feet."
Palumbis, who threw for 353
yards on Saturday, couldn't say
enough about his favorite
receiver.

Stanford wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey had a career-best day
during Saturday's 31-13 Cardinal
victory over Washington State.
And for McCaffrey, a senior play
ing in his last home game for the
Cardinal, improving on his many
impressive games of the past is no
easy task.
But "Easy Ed," as Stanford
quarterback Jason Palumbis
refers to him, made it look effort
less while tallying three receiving
touchdowns and one rushing
touchdown. McCaffrey also had a
fourth receiving touchdown, his
most beautiful catch of the day,
disallowed when a referee incor
rectly called him out of bounds.
"The team came together, the
coaches had the confidence to go
to me, the line gave Jason protec
tion, the other receivers took the
pressure off me and it worked out
well," McCaffrey said. "Some
times it goes that way, some times
it doesn't."
On Saturday it was going
McCaffrey's way. Often.
Palumbis completed seven
passes to McCaffrey, who tallied
176 total receiving yards includ
ing touchdowns of 31, 34 and 69
yards. The Cardinal's entire
receiving corps enjoyed Washing
ton State's "bracketing," where
one receiver was left covered one
