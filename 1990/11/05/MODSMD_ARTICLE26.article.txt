It wasn't pretty. But it was a
win.
And at this point of the season
Stanford can't be picky.
With only two games left, the
hard-luck Cardinal will take any
"W" it can get. Saturday's almost
complete game effort over the
luckless Cougars was good
enough.
"We had some breakdowns but
fortunately we were able to take
advantage of them in certain situ
ations which enabled us to score,"
said wide receiver Ed McCaffrey.
"We're defintely capable of play
ing better than we did today, but
we won the football game and
that's the important thing."

Football
There was some ugly football
on both sides of the ball. Fumbles,
missed fourth-down conversions,
a slew of penalties and even a
kickoff returner who forgot the
rules of kickoff returns.
But there was also McCaffrey.
In his final home game, the
senior gave Stanford the offensive
spark it has been lacking the past
three weeks. And left Washington
State's secondary grasping at air.
There wasn't a ball the 6-foot-6
target couldn't get. He scored all
four Stanford touchdowns. Out
hustled speedy defensive backs.
Ran the ball into the end zone.
And had the day of his Cardinal
career. One hundred seventy-six
yards on seven receptions, three
of which were TD snags. His 69-
yard catch for a score in the sec
ond quarter tied the team's
longest scoring play this season.
"You can't take Ed on one-on
one," said quarterback Jason
Palumbis. "You get it around him,
he's going to get it. I think every
one knows he's a heck of a player.
He's a big money man and if you
try to play man on Ed he's gone. If
they single cover him its my job to
get him the ball."
And Palumbis did just that.
With the aid of an offensive line
that usually gave him enough
time to find the single-covered
man, Palumbis spent much of the
il'ternoon lofting the long ball. No
more nickle and diming. It was
he day of the big play.
If it wasn't McCaffey coming
down with another 30-plus yard
touchdown snag, it was Jon
Pinkney hauling in a 29-yard
third-down toss. Or Chris Walsh
grabbing a 25-yarder over the
middle. Or Walter Batson coming
up with an amazing 13-yarder on
the right sideline.
"Jason's been doing a great job
all year, today especially," McCaf
frey said. "They played a lot of
bracketing on certain receivers
and left maybe one receiver one
on-one. He did a great job all day
of hitting the guy who was one-on
one.
Palumbis chalked up one of his
all-time best days on the Farm,
going 23 of 30 for 353 yards, three
touchdowns, and no intercep
tions.
But it wasn't only Air Cardinal
that got its act together Saturday.
For the first time in five weeks,
Stanford had a ground game. Six
Stanford running backs averaged
at least four yards a carry, three at
least five. •
Saturday the Cardinal's tal
ented backfield finally got the
room it needed. And ran up a total

of 197 net yards. There was no
one standout. Everyone con
tributed. Glyn Milburn for 53,
Tommy Vardell for 40. Jon Volpe
and Charlie Young for 20 apiece.
Even J.J. Lasley and Ellery
Roberts got chances to carry.
The talent has been there all
season. The holes have not.
The difference was the offen
sive line.
"Our offensive line just domi
nated Washington State's defen
sive line. They were giving a good
surge, driving guys off the ball
three, four yards," Volpe said.
"The running backs could choose
and pick the holes. That's the way
it should be. It was nice to get the
ball and not have someone on you
right away."
"We came off the ball a whole
lot better than we have in quite a
while," said right guard Chuck
Gillingham. "We got a pretty good
feel for what their scheme was
early on and we were able to come
off the ball. That was the empha
sis all week."
The line gave the backfield
some room, and Palumbis time,
for the most part. Palumbis was
sacked five times, but the Cougars
often ran an eight-man front,
gambling on getting the signal
caller versus leaving receivers
open.
Palumbis went down a few
times, but Washington State also
paid the price. Three TD passes.

Five hunbdred yards of total
offense.
It was a dominating win
despite mental lapses, but 15 min
utes into the game it looked like
Stanford might end up in the loss
column for the seventh time this
season. Although the Cardinal
controlled the ball most of the
quarter, it failed to score when
two sustained drives were aborted
— one by a failed fouth-down con
version on the Cougar 7, the next
by a Milburn fumble on the
Cougar 27. A 10-0 deficit six min
utes into the second quarter had
the fans groaning.
But a one-play drive — the 69-
yard TD catch/sprint by McCaf
frey — put Stanford on the board
quickly, and it never lost momen
tum. And the Cougars never
regained any.
On the ensuing kick off, WSU
returner Phillip Tuivai watched
the ball bounce to the Cougar 20,
apparently forgetting that a kick
off, unlike a punt, is a live ball.
Freshman defensive back Josh
Wright picked it up, and it was
first-and-10 Stanford.
Six plays later Vardell faked his
famous leap over the top, and it
was McCaffrey on the end around
for the score.
McCaffrey?
Stanford has actually been
practicing the play all season, but
it was the first time the decep
tively speedy receiver had a

chance to carry the ball.
"I could have scored on the one
before but I thought about Ed,
and it being his last home game
and everything, and decided to let
him [score] on the fake," Vardell
deadpanned.
Joking aside, Stanford knew
the game was its to lose at this
point. And it never gave WSU a
chance.
Two more long TD tosses to
McCaffrey, and the Cardinal had
the game wrapped up. In fact, it
actually should have been three
more McCaffrey scores. A third
down reception in the far corner
of the end zone was ruled incom
plete, but replays showed Big Ed
definitely had one foot in. Stan
ford settled for a field goal.
For the first time in five games
the Cardinal had room for its
errors, inlcuding three lost fum
bles and six penalties for 66 yards.
Stanford's pass rush and sec
ondary gave the squad space.
The Cardinal had a pass rush.
Its non-existent harassment solid
ified Saturday. Instead of Stan
ford's pass defense being the
laughingstock of the conference, it
was deadly.
Freshman quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, and replacement Aaron
Garcia, were ineffective all after
noon. The Cardinal "D" gave
them no chance. If the Cougar sig
nal callers wern't being hurried or
sacked, their passes were

deflected. Or intercepted. Bledsoe
and Garcia were a combined 12-of
-35 for 102 yards.
"It was awesome! We said
before the game the only way
we're going to stop Washington
State is our pass rush," said out
side linebacker Ron George. "No
matter how good our secondary is,
if the quarteback has enough time
he can find a receiver. Today we
really got to the quarterback and
our secondary really played sound
defense."
The secondary actually caught
fire last week, halting Bill Mus
grave and Co. in Eugene, but car
ried it one step farther. Corner
back Kevin Scott intercepted a
Bledsoe pass, and his fellow defen
sive backs accounted for nine pass
break-ups, a season high.
"The secondary showed a lot of
improvement last week and it def
initely carried over," Scott said.
"We were a lot more aggressive.
This is the type of secondary
we've wanted to establish and its
finally starting to come together."
The whole team finally came
together. After three weeks of
shaking heads, unanswered ques
tions and disappointment, the tal
ented Cardinal put together the
performance it's been looking for.

Or at least took the first step in
getting there.
"After Oregon and Washington,
this game really brings us back in
focus. It's really going to help us
get back the intensity we've lost
over the season," George said.
"For a while we felt maybe we
really didn't have it, maybe we
weren't as competitive as we
thought, but this game really
proves our belief that this is truly
a different Cardinal team. Stan
ford is on the road back to a victo
rious program."
Card notes
All seniors were honored in a pro
game ceremony. It was the final home
game for McCaffrey, Gillingham,
Scott, Volpe, Young, Batson,
linebacker Jono Tunney, placekick
ers John Hopkins and Dave
Durkin, and defensive tackle Scott
Palmbush.
Linebacker Dave Garnett led the
defense with seven tackles, one pass
break-up and a sack. Palmbush had a
pass break-up and a sack, and Albert
Richardson and Tuan Van Le each
had two deflections.
Pinckney had his best game of the
year, grabbing three passeß for 51
yards, and Walsh had two big recep
tions for 34 yards.

He's a big money man and if you
try to play man on Ed he's gone. If
they single cover him its my job to
get him the ball."
And Palumbis did just that.
With the aid of an offensive line
that usually gave him enough
time to find the single-covered
man, Palumbis spent much of the
il'ternoon lofting the long ball. No
more nickle and diming. It was
he day of the big play.
If it wasn't McCaffey coming
down with another 30-plus yard
touchdown snag, it was Jon
Pinkney hauling in a 29-yard
third-down toss. Or Chris Walsh
grabbing a 25-yarder over the
middle. Or Walter Batson coming
up with an amazing 13-yarder on
the right sideline.
"Jason's been doing a great job
all year, today especially," McCaf
frey said. "They played a lot of
bracketing on certain receivers
and left maybe one receiver one
on-one. He did a great job all day
of hitting the guy who was one-on
one.
Palumbis chalked up one of his
all-time best days on the Farm,
going 23 of 30 for 353 yards, three
touchdowns, and no intercep
tions.
But it wasn't only Air Cardinal
that got its act together Saturday.
For the first time in five weeks,
Stanford had a ground game. Six
Stanford running backs averaged
at least four yards a carry, three at
least five. •
Saturday the Cardinal's tal
ented backfield finally got the
room it needed. And ran up a total

of 197 net yards. There was no
one standout. Everyone con
tributed. Glyn Milburn for 53,
Tommy Vardell for 40. Jon Volpe
and Charlie Young for 20 apiece.
Even J.J. Lasley and Ellery
Roberts got chances to carry.
The talent has been there all
season. The holes have not.
The difference was the offen
sive line.
"Our offensive line just domi
nated Washington State's defen
sive line. They were giving a good
surge, driving guys off the ball
three, four yards," Volpe said.
"The running backs could choose
and pick the holes. That's the way
it should be. It was nice to get the
ball and not have someone on you
right away."
"We came off the ball a whole
lot better than we have in quite a
while," said right guard Chuck
Gillingham. "We got a pretty good
feel for what their scheme was
early on and we were able to come
off the ball. That was the empha
sis all week."
The line gave the backfield
some room, and Palumbis time,
for the most part. Palumbis was
sacked five times, but the Cougars
often ran an eight-man front,
gambling on getting the signal
caller versus leaving receivers
open.
Palumbis went down a few
times, but Washington State also
paid the price. Three TD passes.

Five hunbdred yards of total
offense.
It was a dominating win
despite mental lapses, but 15 min
utes into the game it looked like
Stanford might end up in the loss
column for the seventh time this
season. Although the Cardinal
controlled the ball most of the
quarter, it failed to score when
two sustained drives were aborted
— one by a failed fouth-down con
version on the Cougar 7, the next
by a Milburn fumble on the
Cougar 27. A 10-0 deficit six min
utes into the second quarter had
the fans groaning.
But a one-play drive — the 69-
yard TD catch/sprint by McCaf
frey — put Stanford on the board
quickly, and it never lost momen
tum. And the Cougars never
regained any.
On the ensuing kick off, WSU
returner Phillip Tuivai watched
the ball bounce to the Cougar 20,
apparently forgetting that a kick
off, unlike a punt, is a live ball.
Freshman defensive back Josh
Wright picked it up, and it was
first-and-10 Stanford.
Six plays later Vardell faked his
famous leap over the top, and it
was McCaffrey on the end around
for the score.
McCaffrey?
Stanford has actually been
practicing the play all season, but
it was the first time the decep
tively speedy receiver had a

chance to carry the ball.
"I could have scored on the one
before but I thought about Ed,
and it being his last home game
and everything, and decided to let
him [score] on the fake," Vardell
deadpanned.
Joking aside, Stanford knew
the game was its to lose at this
point. And it never gave WSU a
chance.
Two more long TD tosses to
McCaffrey, and the Cardinal had
the game wrapped up. In fact, it
actually should have been three
more McCaffrey scores. A third
down reception in the far corner
of the end zone was ruled incom
plete, but replays showed Big Ed
definitely had one foot in. Stan
ford settled for a field goal.
For the first time in five games
the Cardinal had room for its
errors, inlcuding three lost fum
bles and six penalties for 66 yards.
Stanford's pass rush and sec
ondary gave the squad space.
The Cardinal had a pass rush.
Its non-existent harassment solid
ified Saturday. Instead of Stan
ford's pass defense being the
laughingstock of the conference, it
was deadly.
Freshman quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, and replacement Aaron
Garcia, were ineffective all after
noon. The Cardinal "D" gave
them no chance. If the Cougar sig
nal callers wern't being hurried or
sacked, their passes were

deflected. Or intercepted. Bledsoe
and Garcia were a combined 12-of
-35 for 102 yards.
"It was awesome! We said
before the game the only way
we're going to stop Washington
State is our pass rush," said out
side linebacker Ron George. "No
matter how good our secondary is,
if the quarteback has enough time
he can find a receiver. Today we
really got to the quarterback and
our secondary really played sound
defense."
The secondary actually caught
fire last week, halting Bill Mus
grave and Co. in Eugene, but car
ried it one step farther. Corner
back Kevin Scott intercepted a
Bledsoe pass, and his fellow defen
sive backs accounted for nine pass
break-ups, a season high.
"The secondary showed a lot of
improvement last week and it def
initely carried over," Scott said.
"We were a lot more aggressive.
This is the type of secondary
we've wanted to establish and its
finally starting to come together."
The whole team finally came
together. After three weeks of
shaking heads, unanswered ques
tions and disappointment, the tal
ented Cardinal put together the
performance it's been looking for.

Or at least took the first step in
getting there.
"After Oregon and Washington,
this game really brings us back in
focus. It's really going to help us
get back the intensity we've lost
over the season," George said.
"For a while we felt maybe we
really didn't have it, maybe we
weren't as competitive as we
thought, but this game really
proves our belief that this is truly
a different Cardinal team. Stan
ford is on the road back to a victo
rious program."
Card notes
All seniors were honored in a pro
game ceremony. It was the final home
game for McCaffrey, Gillingham,
Scott, Volpe, Young, Batson,
linebacker Jono Tunney, placekick
ers John Hopkins and Dave
Durkin, and defensive tackle Scott
Palmbush.
Linebacker Dave Garnett led the
defense with seven tackles, one pass
break-up and a sack. Palmbush had a
pass break-up and a sack, and Albert
Richardson and Tuan Van Le each
had two deflections.
Pinckney had his best game of the
year, grabbing three passeß for 51
yards, and Walsh had two big recep
tions for 34 yards.
It wasn't pretty. But it was a
win.
And at this point of the season
Stanford can't be picky.
With only two games left, the
hard-luck Cardinal will take any
"W" it can get. Saturday's almost
complete game effort over the
luckless Cougars was good
enough.
"We had some breakdowns but
fortunately we were able to take
advantage of them in certain situ
ations which enabled us to score,"
said wide receiver Ed McCaffrey.
"We're defintely capable of play
ing better than we did today, but
we won the football game and
that's the important thing."

Football
There was some ugly football
on both sides of the ball. Fumbles,
missed fourth-down conversions,
a slew of penalties and even a
kickoff returner who forgot the
rules of kickoff returns.
But there was also McCaffrey.
In his final home game, the
senior gave Stanford the offensive
spark it has been lacking the past
three weeks. And left Washington
State's secondary grasping at air.
There wasn't a ball the 6-foot-6
target couldn't get. He scored all
four Stanford touchdowns. Out
hustled speedy defensive backs.
Ran the ball into the end zone.
And had the day of his Cardinal
career. One hundred seventy-six
yards on seven receptions, three
of which were TD snags. His 69-
yard catch for a score in the sec
ond quarter tied the team's
longest scoring play this season.
"You can't take Ed on one-on
one," said quarterback Jason
Palumbis. "You get it around him,
he's going to get it. I think every
one knows he's a heck of a player.
He's a big money man and if you
try to play man on Ed he's gone. If
they single cover him its my job to

one standout. Everyone con
tributed. Glyn Milburn for 53,
Tommy Vardell for 40. Jon Volpe
and Charlie Young for 20 apiece.
Even J.J. Lasley and Ellery
Roberts got chances to carry.
The talent has been there all
season. The holes have not.
The difference was the offen
sive line.
"Our offensive line just domi
nated Washington State's defen
sive line. They were giving a good
surge, driving guys off the ball
three, four yards," Volpe said.
"The running backs could choose
and pick the holes. That's the way
it should be. It was nice to get the
ball and not have someone on you
right away."
"We came off the ball a whole
lot better than we have in quite a
while," said right guard Chuck
Gillingham. "We got a pretty good
feel for what their scheme was
early on and we were able to come
off the ball. That was the empha
sis all week."
The line gave the backfield
some room, and Palumbis time,
for the most part. Palumbis was
sacked five times, but the Cougars
often ran an eight-man front,
gambling on getting the signal
caller versus leaving receivers
open.
Palumbis went down a few
times, but Washington State also
paid the price. Three TD passes.

Five hunbdred yards of total
offense.
It was a dominating win
despite mental lapses, but 15 min
utes into the game it looked like
Stanford might end up in the loss
column for the seventh time this
season. Although the Cardinal
controlled the ball most of the
quarter, it failed to score when
two sustained drives were aborted
— one by a failed fouth-down con
version on the Cougar 7, the next
by a Milburn fumble on the
Cougar 27. A 10-0 deficit six min
utes into the second quarter had
the fans groaning.
But a one-play drive — the 69-
yard TD catch/sprint by McCaf
frey — put Stanford on the board
quickly, and it never lost momen
tum. And the Cougars never
regained any.
On the ensuing kick off, WSU
returner Phillip Tuivai watched
the ball bounce to the Cougar 20,
apparently forgetting that a kick
off, unlike a punt, is a live ball.
Freshman defensive back Josh
Wright picked it up, and it was
first-and-10 Stanford.
Six plays later Vardell faked his
famous leap over the top, and it
was McCaffrey on the end around
for the score.
McCaffrey?
Stanford has actually been
practicing the play all season, but
it was the first time the decep
tively speedy receiver had a

chance to carry the ball.
"I could have scored on the one
before but I thought about Ed,
and it being his last home game
and everything, and decided to let
him [score] on the fake," Vardell
deadpanned.
Joking aside, Stanford knew
the game was its to lose at this
point. And it never gave WSU a
chance.
Two more long TD tosses to
McCaffrey, and the Cardinal had
the game wrapped up. In fact, it
actually should have been three
more McCaffrey scores. A third
down reception in the far corner
of the end zone was ruled incom
plete, but replays showed Big Ed
definitely had one foot in. Stan
ford settled for a field goal.
For the first time in five games
the Cardinal had room for its
errors, inlcuding three lost fum
bles and six penalties for 66 yards.
Stanford's pass rush and sec
ondary gave the squad space.
The Cardinal had a pass rush.
Its non-existent harassment solid
ified Saturday. Instead of Stan
ford's pass defense being the
laughingstock of the conference, it
was deadly.
Freshman quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, and replacement Aaron
Garcia, were ineffective all after
noon. The Cardinal "D" gave
them no chance. If the Cougar sig
nal callers wern't being hurried or
sacked, their passes were

deflected. Or intercepted. Bledsoe
and Garcia were a combined 12-of
-35 for 102 yards.
"It was awesome! We said
before the game the only way
we're going to stop Washington
State is our pass rush," said out
side linebacker Ron George. "No
matter how good our secondary is,
if the quarteback has enough time
he can find a receiver. Today we
really got to the quarterback and
our secondary really played sound
defense."
The secondary actually caught
fire last week, halting Bill Mus
grave and Co. in Eugene, but car
ried it one step farther. Corner
back Kevin Scott intercepted a
Bledsoe pass, and his fellow defen
sive backs accounted for nine pass
break-ups, a season high.
"The secondary showed a lot of
improvement last week and it def
initely carried over," Scott said.
"We were a lot more aggressive.
This is the type of secondary
we've wanted to establish and its
finally starting to come together."
The whole team finally came
together. After three weeks of
shaking heads, unanswered ques
tions and disappointment, the tal
ented Cardinal put together the
performance it's been looking for.

Or at least took the first step in
getting there.
"After Oregon and Washington,
this game really brings us back in
focus. It's really going to help us
get back the intensity we've lost
over the season," George said.
"For a while we felt maybe we
really didn't have it, maybe we
weren't as competitive as we
thought, but this game really
proves our belief that this is truly
a different Cardinal team. Stan
ford is on the road back to a victo
rious program."
Card notes
All seniors were honored in a pro
game ceremony. It was the final home
game for McCaffrey, Gillingham,
Scott, Volpe, Young, Batson,
linebacker Jono Tunney, placekick
ers John Hopkins and Dave
Durkin, and defensive tackle Scott
Palmbush.
Linebacker Dave Garnett led the
defense with seven tackles, one pass
break-up and a sack. Palmbush had a
pass break-up and a sack, and Albert
Richardson and Tuan Van Le each
had two deflections.
Pinckney had his best game of the
year, grabbing three passeß for 51
yards, and Walsh had two big recep
tions for 34 yards.
It wasn't pretty. But it was a
win.
And at this point of the season
Stanford can't be picky.
With only two games left, the
hard-luck Cardinal will take any
"W" it can get. Saturday's almost
complete game effort over the
luckless Cougars was good
enough.
"We had some breakdowns but
fortunately we were able to take
advantage of them in certain situ
ations which enabled us to score,"
said wide receiver Ed McCaffrey.
"We're defintely capable of play
ing better than we did today, but
we won the football game and
that's the important thing."

Football
There was some ugly football
on both sides of the ball. Fumbles,
missed fourth-down conversions,
a slew of penalties and even a
kickoff returner who forgot the
rules of kickoff returns.
But there was also McCaffrey.
In his final home game, the
senior gave Stanford the offensive
spark it has been lacking the past
three weeks. And left Washington
State's secondary grasping at air.
There wasn't a ball the 6-foot-6
target couldn't get. He scored all
four Stanford touchdowns. Out
hustled speedy defensive backs.
Ran the ball into the end zone.
And had the day of his Cardinal
career. One hundred seventy-six
yards on seven receptions, three
of which were TD snags. His 69-
yard catch for a score in the sec
ond quarter tied the team's
longest scoring play this season.
"You can't take Ed on one-on
one," said quarterback Jason
Palumbis. "You get it around him,
he's going to get it. I think every
one knows he's a heck of a player.
He's a big money man and if you
try to play man on Ed he's gone. If
they single cover him its my job to
get him the ball."
And Palumbis did just that.
With the aid of an offensive line
that usually gave him enough
time to find the single-covered
man, Palumbis spent much of the
il'ternoon lofting the long ball. No
more nickle and diming. It was
he day of the big play.
If it wasn't McCaffey coming
down with another 30-plus yard
touchdown snag, it was Jon
Pinkney hauling in a 29-yard
third-down toss. Or Chris Walsh
grabbing a 25-yarder over the
middle. Or Walter Batson coming
up with an amazing 13-yarder on
the right sideline.
"Jason's been doing a great job
all year, today especially," McCaf
frey said. "They played a lot of
bracketing on certain receivers
and left maybe one receiver one
on-one. He did a great job all day
of hitting the guy who was one-on
one.
Palumbis chalked up one of his
all-time best days on the Farm,
going 23 of 30 for 353 yards, three
touchdowns, and no intercep
tions.
But it wasn't only Air Cardinal
that got its act together Saturday.
For the first time in five weeks,
Stanford had a ground game. Six
Stanford running backs averaged
at least four yards a carry, three at
least five. •
Saturday the Cardinal's tal
ented backfield finally got the
room it needed. And ran up a total

of 197 net yards. There was no
one standout. Everyone con
tributed. Glyn Milburn for 53,
Tommy Vardell for 40. Jon Volpe
