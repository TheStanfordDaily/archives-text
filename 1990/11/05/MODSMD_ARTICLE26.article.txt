It wasn't pretty. But it was a
win.
And at this point of the season
Stanford can't be picky.
With only two games left, the
hard-luck Cardinal will take any

one knows he's a heck of a player.
He's a big money man and if you
try to play man on Ed he's gone. If
they single cover him its my job to
get him the ball."
And Palumbis did just that.
With the aid of an offensive line
that usually gave him enough
time to find the single-covered
