# Soccer team's dream season ends in Santa Barbara

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. - The
women's soccer team achieved its goal of
reaching the NCAA tournament, but its
dreams of a national championship were
shattered Saturday by UC-Santa Bar
bara, 1-0 in the first round of the tourna
ment.
Gaucho junior Trisha Kimble scored
24 minutes into the second half on an
unassisted burst around the left end, giv
ing No. 4 Santa Barbara the victory in an
evenly-fought game. Kimble beat fullback
Leni Nonoshita around the corner and
blasted a low shot inside the near post.
Senior goalie Elise Edwards was caught
leaning to the far post and allowed her
first goal in the last five games.
"I'm disappointed with the results — I

thought we deserved it, but I'm very, very
proud," said Stanford coach Berhane
Andeberhan, whose team returned home
Saturday night after a sudden end to a
record-setting year.
Stanford, which was playing in its first
NCAA tournament, ends the year with a
15-3-1 mark and a No. 7 national rank
ing, its most successful season ever.
The Gauchos (16-1-1) advance to the
second round against Santa Clara (17-0-
1), which had a bye in the first round.
Santa Clara and Santa Barbara will play
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium.
It was only the second time all year —
and the second time against Santa Bar
bara — that Stanford had been shut out.
On Sept. 15 in Harder Stadium, the Gau
chos blanked Stanford 1-0 with a second
half goal from Phronsie Franco. In fact,

Stanford has never beaten the Gauchos
— Santa Barbara has a 6-0-1 overall
record against the Cardinal.
But unlike the earlier defeat, when
Stanford was on the final leg of a three
game road trip and was playing without
senior Denise Denney, Stanford Saturday
was able to disrupt Santa Barbara's
quick-passing rhythm and assert itself on
the offensive end. Stanford out-shot
Santa Barbara 13-10 and played the Gau
chos evenly.
"We're very proud," scud Andeberhan.
"Last time they clearly out-played us, but
this time I think we may have even had
an advantage."
Stanford was never intimidated
against the playoff-experienced Gauchos,
who have played in three of the last four
NCAA tournaments and lost last year in
the quarterfinals to Santa Clara. The
Cardinal tried to work the ball to sopho
more midfielder Julie Foudy in the middle
of the field and the strategy worked, as
several times the dazzling Foudy was able
to race within scoring range.
"I think they were more nervous than
we were," said Andeberhan. "We knew
they were a great passing team and we
tried to disrupt their rhythm, but they
are a good team and they were able to
score."
Seemingly the only difference between
the two teams was that Santa Barbara
was able to convert one of its chances,
while Stanford bounced its shots off the
goal post and Gaucho goalie Jan Urich's
fingertips. Edwards only had two saves,
but it was the one that got away and the
five that almost went in the other way
that Stanford will have a hard time for
getting in the off-season.
"We played the best we could and I
think we out-played them. They only had
two opportunities, but they are a great
team and they put one of them in. That's
what we needed to do," said Foudy, who
ran the Gaucho defenders ragged but was
unable to score.
Stanford had its first golden opportu
nity 41 minutes into the first half. Fresh
man forward Sarah Rafanelli, Stanford's
points leader for the year, flipped a pass to
senior Jennifer Rowland behind the last
defender. But Urich charged Rowland as
she took possession and was able to snuff
her shot before it could rise above her.
As the second half began, Rafanelli
took a pass from Rowland at 20 yards and
banged it off the top post, bringing the
Stanford bench to its feet.
Ten minutes into the half, Foudy
started with the ball at midfield and drib
bled unmolested until she got near the

penalty box, where she was mugged by a
triumvirate of Gaucho defenders. Foudy
was tackled as she made her move and
was knocked out of the game momentar
ily with a bruised hip.
On the ensuing free kick, Rafanelli
radar-guided her kick to the far-post cor
ner, but Urich was able to deflect the ball
off the top post. Urich's net antics pre
served her 10th shutout of the season and
her fourth in a row
Foudy returned to the game one
minute later and almost gave Stanford
the lead with a tomahawk right-footer
from 14 yards out on a powerful crossing
pass from Rafanelli. But once again, the
shot bounced squarely off the top post,

and Stanford was not able to follow it in.
But despite Stanford's persistent
assault on the crossbar, Santa Barbara's
speedy midfielder Kimble changed the
game with a great individual move and
shot.
Kimble, a 5-foot-2 junior, caused prob
lems because of her quickness during
both halves. Junior fullback Michele Sul
livan started and was matched up on the
outside with Kimble, but the veteran had
to leave the game at half-time due to a a
painful back injury that has limited her
playing time in the late-season.
Andeberhan replaced Sullivan with the

Senior midfielder Denise Denney's collegiate career came to a close Saturday
In the first round of the NCAA tournament. When Oenney and Coach Berhane
Andeberhan came to the Farm four years ago the Cardinal was coming off a
three-win season, but this year the team finished 15-3-1.
