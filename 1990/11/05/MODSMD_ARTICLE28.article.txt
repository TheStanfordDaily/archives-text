# Band backs other 'football' team

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. - The
Leland Stanford Junior (pause) Uni
versity Marching Band was banned
from playing at Saturday's football
game.
But no one — not even the Stanford
Athletic Department — could prevent
the Stanford Band from showing its
support for the athletes on the
women's soccer team in Santa Bar
bara.
The rally band arrived at the first
round match just before game time to
the delight and surprise of most of the
Stanford athletes and the fans.
"I love hearing the band," fan Grace
Rhodes said. "I'm glad they couldn't
f>lay (at the football game) today. Their
088 is our gain."
The Band provided a pleasant anti
dote to the raucous UC-Santa Barbara
student section.
The rally band's unconventional
cheering redirected the attention of
the Gaucho fans, changing their per
sonal verbal attacks directed at the
Stanford players into a few rather
humorous exchanges between the two
student sections. Instead of watching
the Gaucho fans taunt the Cardinal
athletes, the Band began to take the
brunt of their shouts.
At one point, the Band brought food

into the stadium, subsequently
received the mocking "we hate dough
nuts" chant from the Santa Barbara
faithful, and then graciously offered
some refreshments to the Southern
Californian students.
But distracting the Gaucho rowdies
was not the only role the musicians
played.
"We were psyched to hear the Band
and see all of the fan support when we
stepped onto the field," sophomore
goalie Wendy Kevan said.
Prior to the opening whistle and
after the game, the rally band played a
selection of songs, and, during the
match, the group shouted its support
for the Cardinal women.
"The Band was a tremendous boost
for everyone at the game," fan Max
Schluter said. "If they hadn't been
there at halftime, I don't know if we
would have made it through (due to
the cold temperatures)."
"We refuse to allow the Athletic
department to get in our way of sup
porting students," drum Greg
Louden said.
The 30 band members played at the
tailgaters for the football game at
Stanford Stadium, jumped in their
cars about 12:30 p.m., and headed
down for the evening showdown.
The musicians had to find their own
rides to the game and had to finance
the trip out of their own pockets.
