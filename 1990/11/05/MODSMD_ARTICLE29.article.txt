# Polo hammers Davis; loses to alumni team
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
After a seemingly endless
string of hard-fought and men
tally straining games, the
Stanford water polo team
finally had a couple of relaxing,
worry-free games over the
weekend at deGuerre Pool.

Water Polo
On Saturday, Stanford
played an exhibition in the
annual alumni game, and the
Cardinal of old defeated this
year's team in a "thriller," 13-
12. The day before, Stanford
took on coach Dante Detta
manti's alma mater team, UC-
Davis, and had no problems
defeating the overmatched
Aggies by a score of 12-6.
These games were of such
little concern to the Cardinal,
whose record is now 22-4, that
after the two games were
played, barely anyone on the
team even remembered the
scores of the games.
Nevertheless, the team did
get what it wanted out of this
weekend. As freshman Larry
Bercutt said, "We knew we
weren't going to get much
accomplished this weekend as
far as playing is concerned, but
we got some training in and
had a good time." By the way,
Bercutt did remember the
scores.
Indeed, as the toughest
stretch of the Cardinal's sea
son begins with games next
weekend on the road against
UCLA and USC, the team
really needed a chance to rest
and relax. "This was our last
chance to have a weekend off
before the end of the year,"
junior Greg Morris said, "And

it really came at a good time."
Bercutt added, "It's a good
break for us, because in the
next couple of weeks our sea
son is really going to be
decided, and we won't be able
to take any breaks then."
In Dettamanti's 13 years as
coach of the Cardinal, his
teams have yet to beat the
alumni team, and this year was
no different. Despite the fact
that the alumni team did not
have any of the current
national team members on its
roster Saturday, the former
Stanford stars had enough
firepower to pull out the win â€”
and drink a few beers in the
process.
The game is designed for
everyone to have a good time,
and despite the loss, it appears
that the Cardinal did just that.
As Bercutt said, "It was a lot of
fun, and it was also pretty
exciting to play against some
former Olympic athletes."
In addition, some of the
Cardinal veterans were
reunited with their teammates
from the past couple of years.
"Everybody had a lot of fun,"
Morris said, "And it was espe
cially nice because we got to
play with some of the guys
from last year and see how
everyone was doing."
The game against Davis was
literally nothing more than a
chance for everyone on the
Stanford team to play, as the
Cardinal had little trouble
defeating its opponent by the
score of 12-6. As has been the
case all year long, Stanford
jumped out to a quick lead and
then held on to win the game.
The halftime score in the game
was 6-1, Stanford.
The Cardinal, which is still
ranked No. 2 in the country
behind California, will return
to real action next weekend
against No. 3 UCLA and No. 6
USC.
