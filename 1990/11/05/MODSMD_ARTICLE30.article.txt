# Volleyball sweeps through Washington
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
The Stanford volleyball team is
on a mission right now.
They're trying to get ahead in
their homework.
After thumping Washington
and Washington State this week
end, the team clinched a tie for
second place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference this year. In the process,
Stanford essentially assured itself
of a date at the NCAA regionals
during Dead Week a month from
now.
"Right now, we're thinking
about our academic schedule,"
outside hitter Jennifer Jackson
said.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal has
a right to be. Stanford (19-3, 13-2
in Pac-10 play) pummelled Wash
ington 15-5,15-6, 6-15, 15-11 Fri
day and then trounced Washing
ton State 15-3, 15-8, 15-3 Satur
day. The Cardinal has won five
consecutive matches and 13 of its
last 14.
Judging from the size of Wash
ington's crowd, all of Seattle prob
ably knew what was coming. Stan
ford was rolling straight off an
upset win over No. 4 University of

Women's Volleyball
the Pacific and had little intention
of being slowed.
The vaunted Cardinal offense
came out firing. Senior Jessica
Benton trashed any doubts that
she couldn't hit with the best,
recording a match-high .350 hit
ting percentage and 10 kills. Ben
ton had six digs and four blocks to
round out the affair.
Benton has hit .350 or better in
each of her last five matches and
is now hitting .305 in the Pac-10
this season. "Jess has been doing
really great," Jackson said.
"Every day I see her getting that
much better."
Junior middle blocker Amy
Cooper smashed 12 kills of her
own to go with two blocks and five
digs. Junior co-captain Kristin
Klein tallied 15 kills and 16 digs.
"I think we played pretty well
in the first two games," Jackson
said. "It wasn't that much of a
challenge."
The challenge may have been

staying alert. The Huskies lulled
Stanford to sleep and then
stunned the dormant Cardinal in
game three. Washington sped
ahead of Stanford, exploiting a let
down in ball control.
"I think our problem was men
tal," sophomore Kathy Jurgens
said. "We had a passing break
down." '
Dawn Austin buoyed Washing
ton with 16 kills and a .351 hitting
percentage. She also had nine digs
and six blocks. "We have to give
them credit," Jurgens said. "We
weren't really on our toes. They
came out really strong in the third
game."
Thankfully, it wasn't anything
a little reality check couldn't
solve.
Stanford stormed back in game
four, refocusing on the job at
hand. Middle blocker Bev Oden
had team highs of 17 kills, 16 digs
and five blocks to charge the Car
dinal.
"We came out and we knew we
should have done it in three,"
Jackson said. "We learned our les
son."
Washington State found that
out the hard way the next night.

Stanford methodically squashed
Washington State at Bohler Gym
before 988 fans. The match took
all of one hour and three minutes,
a true rarity in the game.
For the most part, the Cougars
got to watch the nation's most
powerful offense go through its
routines. On the night, the Cardi
nal hit .489, had six players hit
over .330, smashed 52 kills and
committed only seven total errors.
Stanford blocked seven attacks
and allowed only 14 cumulative
points throughout the match.
"I think this showed that we
could play our game no matter
who's on the other side of the
net," Jurgens said.
The Cardinal had no difficulty
getting motivated for this oppo
nent, dominating every phase of
the contest. Klein spurred Stan
ford with match-highs of 18 kills
and six digs while hitting .586.
In the process, Klein recorded
her I,oooth career dig and inched
closer to Kim Oden's all-time kills
record as well. Klein now has
1,286 total kills which places her
third all-time after two and a half
seasons at Stanford.
Benton continued her torrid
hitting, posting a .538 percentage
against Washington State. Cooper
struck for a .700 mark and three
digs. Oden smashed 12 kills, hit
.385 and recorded a match-high
three blocks.
With the Washington sweep,
Stanford propped itself into a
commanding position. Currently
the Cardinal is ranked No. 5 in the
Tachikara/AVCA Coaches' Poll.

at home on Tuesday.
The other two squads ranked
ahead of the Cardinal are No. 3
Nebraska and UCLA. Stanford
embarrassed the Cornhuskers at
Maples Pavilion earlier in the sea
son and had match point against
the Bruins before falling two
weeks ago.
"I really like the position we're
in," Jurgens said. "The whole
team has the national champi
onship in the back of their
minds."

Stanford still has some control
over its fate. If the squad can con
tinue to win and beat No. 6 Texas
this Saturday at Maples Pavilion,
the Cardinal will have a chance at
a No. 2 national ranking. Should
that occur, the Cardinal would be
sent to another region during the
NCAA torunament to avoid hav
ing the two top-ranked teams in
the country play in the same
regional.
"The national championship is
all that's on our minds," Jackson
said. "We know where we want to
go. We need to keep on getting bet
ter."
That just may be happening
already. The Cardinal currently
has four of its five starting attack

ers hitting over .300 in Pac-lC
play. Sophomore Carrie Feldman
has alreadCy accumulated the sec
ond most assists of any setter in
Stanford history. She currently
has 1,858 in her career. The
team's ball control has steadily
imporved throughout the year
because of backrow help from
sophomore Laurie Sawin, Jurgens
and seniors Cheryl Conly and
Tracy Hughes.
Stanford will travel to Califor
nia Wednesday to face the strug
gling Golden Bears. Cal is last in
the Pac-10 with a 2-13 mark. The
team, which is exceptionally
young, lost in straight games to

team, which is exceptionally

the Cardinal at Maples Pavilion
earlier in the season.
The Stanford volleyball team is
on a mission right now.
They're trying to get ahead in
their homework.
After thumping Washington
and Washington State this week
end, the team clinched a tie for
second place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference this year. In the process,
Stanford essentially assured itself
of a date at the NCAA regionals
during Dead Week a month from
now.
"Right now, we're thinking
about our academic schedule,"
outside hitter Jennifer Jackson
said.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal has
a right to be. Stanford (19-3, 13-2
in Pac-10 play) pummelled Wash
ington 15-5,15-6, 6-15, 15-11 Fri
day and then trounced Washing
ton State 15-3, 15-8, 15-3 Satur
day. The Cardinal has won five
consecutive matches and 13 of its
last 14.
Judging from the size of Wash
ington's crowd, all of Seattle prob
ably knew what was coming. Stan
ford was rolling straight off an
upset win over No. 4 University of

Women's Volleyball
the Pacific and had little intention
of being slowed.
The vaunted Cardinal offense
came out firing. Senior Jessica
Benton trashed any doubts that
she couldn't hit with the best,
recording a match-high .350 hit
ting percentage and 10 kills. Ben
ton had six digs and four blocks to
round out the affair.
Benton has hit .350 or better in
each of her last five matches and
is now hitting .305 in the Pac-10
this season. "Jess has been doing
really great," Jackson said.
"Every day I see her getting that
much better."
Junior middle blocker Amy
Cooper smashed 12 kills of her
own to go with two blocks and five
digs. Junior co-captain Kristin
Klein tallied 15 kills and 16 digs.
"I think we played pretty well
in the first two games," Jackson
said. "It wasn't that much of a
challenge."
The challenge may have been

staying alert. The Huskies lulled
Stanford to sleep and then
stunned the dormant Cardinal in
game three. Washington sped
ahead of Stanford, exploiting a let
down in ball control.
"I think our problem was men
tal," sophomore Kathy Jurgens
said. "We had a passing break
down." '
Dawn Austin buoyed Washing
ton with 16 kills and a .351 hitting
percentage. She also had nine digs
and six blocks. "We have to give
them credit," Jurgens said. "We
weren't really on our toes. They
came out really strong in the third
game."
Thankfully, it wasn't anything
a little reality check couldn't
solve.
Stanford stormed back in game
four, refocusing on the job at
hand. Middle blocker Bev Oden
had team highs of 17 kills, 16 digs
and five blocks to charge the Car
dinal.
"We came out and we knew we
should have done it in three,"
Jackson said. "We learned our les
son."
Washington State found that
out the hard way the next night.

Stanford methodically squashed
Washington State at Bohler Gym
before 988 fans. The match took
all of one hour and three minutes,
a true rarity in the game.
For the most part, the Cougars
got to watch the nation's most
powerful offense go through its
routines. On the night, the Cardi
nal hit .489, had six players hit
over .330, smashed 52 kills and
committed only seven total errors.
Stanford blocked seven attacks
and allowed only 14 cumulative
points throughout the match.
"I think this showed that we

The Cardinal had no difficulty
getting motivated for this oppo

the contest. Klein spurred Stan
ford with match-highs of 18 kills
and six digs while hitting .586.
In the process, Klein recorded
her I,oooth career dig and inched
closer to Kim Oden's all-time kills
record as well. Klein now has
1,286 total kills which places her
third all-time after two and a half
seasons at Stanford.
Benton continued her torrid
hitting, posting a .538 percentage
against Washington State. Cooper
struck for a .700 mark and three
digs. Oden smashed 12 kills, hit
.385 and recorded a match-high
three blocks.
