# Golf heads for warmer climes

As the days at Stanford get shorter and
colder, one's mind tends to wander from the
books piled high before it to a time when the
sun was bright and the days stretched on
indefinitely, waiting to be filled with outdoor
recreation. Apparently acting on these
instincts, the men's golf team has packed up
and headed south to Palm Springs for the sec
ond Annual UCLA Desert Classic. The Cardi
nal is the defending champion of the 54-hole
tournament, which will take place today
through Wednesday.
Stanford will defend its title against a large
field of competition, including the California
team that won the Stanford Invitational two
weeks ago. Other top contenders will include
UCLA, USC, UC-Santa Barbara, Pepperdine,
and Hawaii.
The Cardinal team making the trip this year
is quite different from the one that made it
last. The only returning player is junior Chris
tian Cevaer, who will top the team's roster.
Having just returned from New Zealand,
where he helped the French national team to a
fourth place finish in the World Amateur Team
Championships, he should be up to the task.
Following Cevaer will be sophomore Mike Mil
liken, who shot a brilliant 209 at the Stanford
Invitational to take the individual title. Round
ing out the team will be sophomores David
Rutkowski and Greg Raleigh as well as fresh
man Notah Begay. Begay recently garnered
first team All-American honors from the
American Junior Golf Association.
According to coach Wally Goodwin, "We
have a really young team. They
have a lot of experience playing
golf, but not college tourna
ments." What they lack in experi
ence, however, they more than
compensate for in raw determina
tion. "I know that every time we
play, I have guys who will bust
their tails as hard as they can. It's
always hard to say what will hap
pen with golf, but I know this
team will really fight to play bet
ter each day."
"Since the team is so different,
we don't really have an advantage
from winning the tournament
last year," Milliken explained.
"But I'm excited about this tour
nament. The course is in good
condition, and we will definitely
be competitive."

A unique feature of the Desert
Classic is the fact that both men's
and women's teams compete in
the tournament. According to
Goodwin, Stanford and UCLA are
the only schools with representa
tives of both teams competing.
It's a fun tournament because
the women and men play
together," Cevaer said. "It's also a
great course, with lots of water.
Since the conditions are so good,
we should shoot pretty low A top
three finish would be great."
Since Stanford has finished
third in its first two tournaments,
this would seem to be a manage
able goal. In fact, life as a member
of the golf team would seem to be
close to ideal right now. But even
the warm air of Palm Springs can
not completely free one's mind of
its worries. "I have a lot of work
to do," Cevaer said. "I brought my
books."
Feel better now?
