# Men's soccer closes its season with a win
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
A little over four months ago,
there were a lot of questions being
asked about the men's soccer pro
gram at Stanford. For starters,
there was no coach for the team.
Additionally, for the first time
in five years, the team had to
begin a season without Mark
Semioli, who graduated as proba
bly the greatest player in school
history. Third, a lot of people were
concerned as to how a team with
seven sophomores and three
freshmen would do against a very
brutal schedule.
Now, the day after the season
ended, all those questions have
been answered, and most for the
better. The Cardinal capped a 9-6-
6 campaign with a 2-1 victory over
California yesterday in Berkeley.
Yesterday, on the Astroturf at
Memorial Stadium, Stanford ran
up against a Cal team that not
only wanted badly to beat its tra
ditional rival, but also saw a
chance at finishing above .500 for
the year. The Golden Bears
appeared to be on their way to
accomplishing both of those goals
when they took a 1-0 lead midway
through the first half.
Defender Scott Potter hit a cen
tering pass to senior Peter
Woodring on a breakaway 28 min
utes into the game. Stanford goal
keeper Kyle Krpata came out to
challenge Woodring, but the Bear
player chipped the ball over
Krpata's head into the net.
Stanford fought back, however,
and 11 minutes later Cal's goal-

keeper, Matt Simi, was whistled
for tripping Stanford sweeper
Randy Mann in the penalty box.
Mann took the resultant penalty
kick and beat Simi to even things
up before the half. The goal was
the fifth for Mann this season and
his third in the past four games.
The teams continued to play
back and forth in the midfield, as
the two teams combined for a
total of only eight shots on the day
(five for Cal, three for Stanford).
But 30 minutes into the second
half, Stanford's Brandon Farley
stepped up to take a throw-in. The
man known for being able to toss
the ball 40 or 50 yards in the air
did just that, sending it past Simi
and just inside the far post.
Despite protestations by Cal, the
goal was counted by the officials
and Stanford led 2-1.
A throw-in is considered like an
indirect free kick in soccer, mean
ing that it has to be touched by
another player before the ball is in
play. The Bears contended that
the throw-in went directly into
the goal, and thus should not have
been allowed.
The officials, on the other
hand, ruled that the ball glanced
off the foot of Cal defender Stuart
Holloway, and allowed the goal to

Forward Jim Talluto and his Cardinal teammates capped a successful season with
a 2-1 victory at California yesterday afternoon. Despite graduation losses, a coaching
change and several key Injuries, the Cardinal concluded 1990 with a 9-6-6 record.
