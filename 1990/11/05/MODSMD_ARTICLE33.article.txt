# Stark-Palmer wins tourney
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Editorial staff 
The last time Stanford sophomore Jonathan
Stark played in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Champ
ionships in Athens, Ga., he lost in the finals to A 1
Parker. Yesterday he had his chance to avenge that
loss. \
But he couldn't come through.
Fourth-seeded Parker, who attends host school
Georgia, defended his title against top-seeded Stark,
6-1, 6-4.
However, Stark was determined to bring home at
least one championship, so he teamed with fellow
sophomore Jared Palmer to capture the doubles
title. The duo, seeded and ranked No. 1, were not
threatened as they defeated Arizona State Sun Dev
ils Brian Gyetko and David Lomicky (seeded No. 5-
8), 6-4, 6-2.
Saturday Stark removed eighth seed Dave Dilucia
from the court, 6-3, 6-2 to advance to yesterday's
final. He was the second Cardinal player that Dilucia
faced in the tournament. Notre Dame's No. 1 player
had beaten freshman Chris Cocotus in the first
round.
Also on Saturday, both of Stanford's doubles
teams went into three sets. But the outcomes were
different.
Stark and Palmer set up their championship
match by eeking out a three-set win over unseeded
Skidmore-Yancey of Kentucky, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
The other Cardinal pair had less luck. Junior Alex
O'Brien and senior Jason Yee, seeded No. 2 in the
tournament and ranked No. 2 in the nation, lost
their bid to challenge their teammates by dropping a
3-6, 6-2, 6-3 decision to Gyetko and Lomicky.
Although Stark lost his chance at a Collegiate
Grand Slam singles title, he will have another soon.
The second leg of the circuit will be the DuPont
National Clay Court Championships on Nov. 16-18
at the Marriott Bay Point Resort in Florida.

Sophomore Jonathan Stark experienced a bit of deja vu yesterday as he lost to
Georgia's Al Parker in the finals of the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Championship for
the second consecutive year. He and classmate Jared Palmer, who also lost in the
double final last year, broke the bonds of fate, however, by defeating a duo from
Arizona State for the championship.
