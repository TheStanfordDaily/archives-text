# Campbell's votes not bound by party ties
## 
### Susan Jackson 
Two years ago, Tom Campbell was
elected to his congressional seat by a
margin of less than 5 percent.
This time, however, the Republican
candidate and Stanford law professor
faces much better odds of re-election.
"The campaign is fine," Campbell
said at the Stanford Homelessness
Action Coalition sleep-out Thursday.
"I'm not here to campaign."
Campbell's confidence may stem
from two years of virtually continual
campaigning. The regular fusillade of
mailings to his constituents has made
Campbell a household name.
He attributes his popularity to
attending almost "128 town meetings,"
as publicized by the übiquitous flyers.
Campbell is also heir to a strong Repub
lican legacy in this district.
In his first term of office, Campbell
has remained extremely visible among
his constituents, as shown by two
speeches at Stanford last week alone.
Campbell's roster of supporters,
including the Sierra Club, the League of
Conservation Voters and the Abortion
Rights Action League, reflects his lib
eral Republican values. His top priority
for next term is "to work out a compro
mise on the Civil Rights bill recently
vetoed by President Bush," Campbell
said.
Pro-environment and pro-choice
positions, as well as a concern for a bal-

tradition, the moder
ate-progressive
Republican party.'

anced budget, have appealed to a voting
population almost evenly divided
between registered Democrats and
Republicans.
Campbell said his appeal to crossover
Democrats is largely for economic rea
sons. "I'm in line with them," he said.
"These are Palo Alto Democrats,"
commented Timothy Taylor, Economics
lecturer and managing editor of the
Journal of Economic Perspectives.
"[They'rel not third-worlders or poor
people."
Robert Minott, a senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institution, said, "I'm
a long-time Democrat — I worked in the
Carter administration [as ambassador
to Sweden] — and I'm voting for Tom
Campbell."
Campbell had been viewed as fairly
conservative before his first term, "but
his voting record showed a more moder
ate position [with] more flexibility," Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg said.

Minott said he believes Campbell
"represents a special Republican tradi
tion, the moderate-progressive Republi
can party." This district's seat has been
held for the past 30 years by such liberal
Republicans as Pete McCloskey and Ed
Zschau. "It's this legacy which [Camp
bell] has been able to build on," Minott
said.
"Anyone running against an incum
bent has a hard time," Taylor said,
adding that only something "really
stupid" would hurt a candidate's re
election campaign. "There's more
turnover in the House of Lords than
there is in the House of Representa
tives," Taylor said, "and a Lord has to
die before a new one comes in."
Some say Campbell's appeal to
Democrats is bolstered by Republican
voting patterns. "The way politics has
worked for the last 50 years, a 50-50 dis
trict is a Republican district," Weisberg
said.
Weisberg also said "Republicans are
more loyal" than Democrats. "They
tend to vote in larger numbers and have
a great ideological unity," he added.
Hoover senior fellow Martin Ander
son said he believes Campbell's political
positions will ensure his re-election.
"It's always portrayed in the media that
voting is personality based," Anderaon
said, "but that's not the case. Policies
determine votes. The mayor reason
[Campbell is] so popular is that he's
been voting the way the voters like."
