# Palmer: pro-environment, pro-children, pro-choice

### John Louie Editorial staff 
Robert Palmer is a household name.
Ironically, that's exactly what troubles
this politician.
"Someone told me I was 'simply irre
sistible,'" said Palmer, concerned that
the popular rock singer with the same
name would obscure his race for a con
gressional seat. "I just hope that I can do
as well as a congressman as Robert
Palmer has done as a singer."
Palmer, the Democratic nominee for
the 12th Congressional District, chal
lenges Republican incumbent Tom
Campbell in Tuesday's election. Like
Campbell, Palmer shares educational
ties to Stanford, having receiving a
Ph.D. in Civil Engineering here.
But many differences exist between
the two candidates. Palmer, a devoted
environmentalist, cited his support of
Proposition 128 as one fundamental dis
tinction. Nicknamed "Big Green,"
Proposition 128 would institute sweep
ing reforms of pesticides, marine protec
tion, redwoods preservation, air pollu
tion and other state environmental
statutes.
"Campbell isn't willing to take a

stand on [Proposition 128]," Palmer
said. "He would rather see kids die.
Someone has to get moving on it."
Critics of Proposition 128 claim the
state*B agricultural industry would suf
fer from a prohibition of all pesticides
with carcinogenic substances. Because
these chemicals are ingested in such
small doses, opponents assert, the can
cerous effects are negligent and a total
ban would be too drastic.
But Palmer supports the complete
prohibition of carcinogenic pesticides.
"These carcinogenic chemicals have
been identified by the Environmental
Protection Agency," Palmer said.
"What's the use of ingesting it at all?
This initiative will phase out these pesti
cides within the next six years."
Palmer also supports Proposition
130, another environmental initiative
that would prohibit clear-cutting of
forests.
"Campbell won't take a stand on envi
ronmental issues," Palmer said. "He
always claims that he's studying them.
This demonstrates a complete lack of
leadership in the environmental area,"
Palmer said.
