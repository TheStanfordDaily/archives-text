# More inclusive multiculturalism demanded
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
During one of the sessions at this week
end's Leadership Summit, a Jewish student
declared, "If this is multiculturalism, I'm all
for it."
His sentiments were echoed by several
summit participants who see the weekend
long program as a model for a new, more
inclusive definition of multiculturalism.
"The multiculturalism issue has really
been expanded to include every single person
here," said Greg Ricks, the multicultural
educator for Residential Education.
Before the summit, one participant
responded to a survey question about the
definition of multiculturalism in this way:
"Learning about and trying to understand
the four ethnic groups (Blacks, Hispanics,
Asian-Americans and Native Americans)
who have been the most oppressed. Of
course, other ethnic groups are important,
too, but these are the groups that should be
stressed the most."
But according to sophomore David
Aufhauser, who represented the Jewish com
munity at the summit, students who hold
such a narrow view of multiculturalism were
definitely in the minority at the summit.
Aufhauser said that during the summit, a
student suggested a "Rock Against Racism"
program. He said a disabled woman raised
her hand with a simple question: "Why can't
it be against all 'isms?' "
The mood of the summit was definitely

closer to the disabled woman's thinking,
Aufhauser said.
But senior Lyzette Settle, a resident assis
tant in Mirrielees Apartments, said people of
color, including Jewish students, "share a lot
of commonalities in how we have been
oppressed and stereotyped."
Settle, who is black, said that disabled and
gay, lesbian and bisexual people also experi
ence discrimination, but that those kinds of
bias are different than those against stu
dents of color.
Many students from non-ethnically
defined student communities — such as
graduate students, students from religious
groups, disabled students and gay students
— said they felt their invitation to the sum
mit brought them into the multicultural pic
ture.
David Schmid, an ASSU graduate sena
tor, called the division between graduate and
undergraduate students "the biggest lack of
understanding on campus." He said the
summit allowed him "to explain my position
on what makes graduate students tick."
Junior Jane Lim, a leader in the Intervar
sity Christian Fellowship, said her inclusion
in the summit was fairly unusual for Stan
ford. "I don't think that the religious com
munity, and particularly the Christian com
munity, is usually recognized as an agent of
change on campus. I feel like I was able to
participate fully (in the summit)."
But Lim still questioned whether the
inclusion of the religious communities at the
summit would translate into a change in

attitudes on the campus as a whole.
Allison May, a senior whose cerebral
palsy impairs her mobility, said, "My long
term goal for things like this is for people to
recognize that the disabled community
[faces] a lot of the same issues as people in
the ethnic communities."
Another disabled student, Janette Samp
son, said questions of accessibility came up
frequently during the summit, serving to
sensitize non-disabled students. Sampson
described herself as a "partial" — someone
who is visually impaired but not completely
"blind.
For example, many of the summit pro
grams involved reading, which she could not
do. Sampson also said some of the locations
for the summit activities were not accessible
to mobility-impaired people.
Chris Hayes, the only representative of
the gay, lesbian and bisexual cortimunity at
the summit, said, "I really felt that people
were respecting my issues in a very genuine
way that I don't usually hear among stu
dents in general."
Now that the summit is over, Hayes and
other students are hoping the expanded mul
ticulturalism Ricks spoke of will translate
into a greater awareness within their own
communities and on the campus as a whole.
Hayes said he hopes his community will
become more aware of multicultural issues
and that other groups will "appreciate that
our issues are as much a part of multicultur
alism as issues of women, disabled students
or other non-ethnic groups."
