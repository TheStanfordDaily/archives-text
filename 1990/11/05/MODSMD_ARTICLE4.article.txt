# Environmental initiatives questioned
## VOTING LOCATIONS 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
Despite its promise of direct democracy, the
California initiative process has led to much con
fusion and debate among voters, particularly
about the environmental propositions on Tues
day's ballot.
While voters are being asked to perform the
Herculean task of balancing the environment and
the economic quality of life in the state, various
advocates are littering the debate with buzz
words like "Big Green" and "Big Con."
The debate has led some experts to question
the validity of the initiative process.
Propositions 128 and 130 are the two central
environmental initiatives on the ballot.
Proposition 128 — "Big Green" — would ban
pesticides thought to cause cancer, mandate wide
scale reductions in emissions of "greenhouse"
gases and gases which damage the ozone layer,
permanently ban new leases for coastal oil
drilling, purchase $200 million worth of old
growth redwood forest for preservation and cre
ate an elected "environmental advocate" that
would oversee the enforcement of California's
environmental laws.
Proposition 130 would restrict timber harvest
ing and preserve redwood trees. It would ban
almost all clear-cutting in California. It would
also sell $710 million worth of bonds to purchase
old-growth forests and require loggers to have a
state-approved plan insuring they are foresting at
sustainable levels.
There are also two counterproposals on the
ballot that complicate the debate. Proposition 135
is supported by the chemical industry and would

block the proposed pesticide regu
lations of Proposition 128. Propo
sition 138, supported by the tim
ber industry, counters the pro
posed forestry regulations.
Timothy Taylor, Economics
lecturer and managing editor of
the Journal of Economic Perspec
tives, said Propositions 135 and
138 are only attempts by the
chemical and timber industries to
defeat 128 and 130.
Taylor, who is also critical of
the two environmentalist-spon
sored initiatives, said the best
way to register disapproval is to
vote "No" on Propositions 128
and 130 rather than "Yes" on the
industry-initiated counterpropos
als.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, an expert on electoral poli
tics, said he felt frustrated at the
initiative process and the result
ing environmental propositions.
"If you believe government has
a role to play, then we damn well
better let government do its job,"

Brody said, adding thst sufficient
study, debate and compromise are
sacrificed by initiatives.
He projects that only slightly
more than one-third of eligible
voters will vote on Tuesday. Thus,
only one-sixth of the electorate —
half of those voting — can bind all
Californians to the measures.
Brody, a long-time Sierra Club
member, said Proposition 128
leaves him torn because of its
breadth. "The more you read it,
the more stuck you seem to be,"
he said. "They seem to throw
everything in there but teenage
pregnancy."
But Susan Jordan, vice presi
dent of the Stanford Environ
mental Law Society, argued that
many of the provisions in Propo
sition 128 have gone through rig
orous debate and compromise.
"Various provisions have been
through extensive legislative
review and rewriting already,"
she said.
Jordan also said repeated
attempts by Stanford Law Prof,
and California assemblyman
Byron Sher to protect redwood
trees have failed because of oppo

sition by legislators who receive
funding from timber industry lob
byists. Preservationists are left
with no recourse but the initiative
process, she said.
Stanford experts disagree on
the costs and benefits of Proposi
tions 128 and 130. For example,
Stanford Medical School Prof.
Wallace Sampson wrote the
rebuttal to Proposition 128 in the
ballot pamphlet. However, seven
of Sampson's Medical School col
leagues endorsed the proposition
in a full-page advertisement in
Friday's New York Times.
Taylor is one of the most out
spoken representatives of an eco
nomic perspective toward the
propositions. He said consumers
face no danger from pesticide
residues on produce. The pro
posal to ban various pesticides is
based on political opportunism
and fear, he added.
Stanford Medical School Prof.
Lorrin Koran disagrees. Koran
said he supports Proposition 128
because it is an effort to reverse
the process of overusing specific
harmful chemicals that "degrade
ecosystems."
