# SHAC sleepout promotes understanding
## 
### Cindy Harmon 
Despite the cold weather, the Stan
ford Homelessness Action Coalition's
sleep-out in White plaza Thursday night
attracted more than 50 people, includ
ing a few who were actually homeless.
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford,
started the evening with a speech on the
legislative side of the homeless problem.
"We need to make it acceptable to build
low-income housing," he said.

May Peterson, who was homeless for
more than two years, talked about the
harsh reality of the streets. She has
worked with the homeless, especially
children, for eight years.
Peterson doesn't have an office; she
walks the streets, helping people as she
goes.
She explained the homeless never sit
down because — as sleep-out partici
pants discovered — the ground is very
cold. The homeless will move around,

drink or do anything they can to keep
warm, Peterson said.
Those who sit Eire too tired or sick to
move, and they usually die, she added.
While Peterson was speaking, a
homeless man showed up to ask for help
for himself, his sick girlfriend and her
child. There was also a young married
homeless couple at the sleep-out. Two
students gave their sleeping bags to the
couple after Peterson requested
it.
A homeless man who did not
give his name took the stage next.
He spoke of life on the streets of
San Jose and of being dirty, cold
and hungry. He also told how the
homeless stick together.
From the little they own, they
will give you what you need to
survive, he said.
He introduced Daniel and
Leann, the young couple given
the sleeping bags. Daniel said
they came here from Wyoming,
lured by stories of available jobs
and the warm California sun.
They are now jobless and out of
money, which they need to buy
medicine for Leann's epilepsy, he
said.
Leann ran out of medicine a

while ago, and has had several
life-threatening seizures, Daniel
said. But recently they made
friends with Scott, a student from
San Jose State who works with
the homeless. Scott obtained
medicine for Leann and is helping
the couple get back to Wyoming.
Scott spoke about how society
deals with the homeless problem,
saying it is important not to "pre
suppose everything the homeless
individual is" to try and solve the
problem.
Every homeless person is not
an alcoholic, lazy or mentally ill,
Scott added. "We can't truly
empathize with them because we
haven't been where they are," he
said.
Catherine Milton, director of
the Haas Center Public Service
Center, summed up the general
feeling of the night. "We each
have a talent to give to the prob
lem, we just need the personal
conviction to get started," she
said.
