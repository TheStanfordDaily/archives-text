# Not his job to legislate morality, says Student Affairs dean
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff 
As acting dean of Student
Affairs, Norm Robinson's deci
sions on issues such as the alcohol
policy and domestic partners' ben
efits have broadly affected the
Stanford community. He has held
the position since the retirement
of Jim Lyons in June. Robinson
had been associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs since 1976 and has
been at Stanford as both a student
and a staff member since 1970.
You've been at Stanford for
two decades. How do you
think student life, and what's
important to students, has
changed over this time
period?
It seems to me that ... stu
dents tend to be more serious
about their academic work. I
think maybe they're focused more
on the future than they used to
be. I think people's world view has
broadened.
In terms of students' social

lives, has there been a change
in the influence of alcohol or
the time for leisure?
I actually think there has been
a growing acceptance of the fact
that one doesn't necessarily need
to drink alcohol to participate in
social life on campus, to attend
parties in the residences and else
where — parties that are run by
students.
I think something like the
[non-alcoholic beverage] policy
has really taken hold in that non
drinkers or moderate drinkers
have felt more empowered than in
the past. But I think it may be as
much related to the fact that stu
dents in general seem to be health
and fitness conscious out here.
Reflect back on your years
at Student Affairs. What have
been some of the most impor
tant decisions you've had to
make and some of the most
important incidents you've
dealt with?
I think there have been deci
sions having to do with the nature
of the residential education pro

gram and the growth of it. There
have been decisions about
[whether to build] residences, for
example, Governor's Corner, the
Rains Houses, the Robert Moore
Houses (the Italian and American
Studies Houses). All those are
things that I think have had sig
nificant impact on student life at
Stanford.
The alcohol policy that was just
replaced captured the essence of
the relationship between Stanford
and its students. It demonstrated
great faith in the ability of Stan
ford students to take responsibil
ity for their lives.
Do you plan to be the per
manent dean of student

affairs, and if not, what are
your other future career
goals?
[In light of the budget cuts,] I
don't even know what this posi
tion is going to be. So, to answer
that question from that point of
view is essentially impossible. But
I really haven't thought about
what I'm going to do after this. I
mean, I haven't been planning on
being the dean of Student Affairs.
And in terms of my future goals,
that's a good question — and it's
one I'm just starting to think
about. Again, I don't have an
answer, and it will probably take a
considerable amount of thinking
beyond what I've done so far
before I have one.
At the beginning of the
school year, you said that bud
get cuts had not affected stu
dent life. Halfway through the
first quarter, do you think
this is still true?
So far this year, I don't think
student life has been affected by
the budget cuts in any noticeable
way. But remember, we've only
done one part of the budget cut.
There are other cuts that will be
implemented by September 1991.
And at that time ... I think they'll
have some impact. But by and
large, I think the effect of the cuts
is hitting the staff more directly
than it's hitting students.
Last year, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy swore
to The Daily that there would
be four years of guaranteed
housing soon. Are you opti
mistic about this possibility,
especially in light of the plans
for the new dormitories?
Since I would not be one to
make a liar out of the president, I
think that his statement was very
accurate. And as soon at Man

zanita Park Phase II housing is
finished — and that should be in
the fall of '92 — we will be able to
guarantee four years of housing to
all undergraduates who are will
ing to accept any place on campus.
The Daily recently ran a
series of stories on ethnic
theme houses and also ran an
editorial that said the Univer
sity shouldn't randomly
assign freshmen to ethnic
theme houses. How do you
feel about this issue?
There was a letter to The Daily
(on Oct. 30) ... that was written
by [Marty Grimes, a theme associ
ate] in Casa Zapata, and I found
that the arguments in that were
probably the ones I would make
now. We want freshmen to have an
experience that is inclusive of the
broad range of other students who
make up the freshmen class. So, I
think it's important for all stu
dents to be exposed to a mix of
backgrounds and lifestyles.
Now, that doesn't mean that
every student is going to live in a
dorm with another student that
represents every possible varia
tion, but that there should be a
critical mass of freshmen within
each house. Within that critical
mass, there should be some vari
ety of ethnicity, academic interest,
geographic background or gender
— things like that.
And the fact that the theme
houses have a particular focus
does not make them any less of a
valuable living experience for
freshmen. It offers what other
houses offer and then some. I
think assigning freshmen there,
the way we assign them to any
other four-class house, is not an
unreasonable thing.
In light of the decisions
you've made regarding the
alcohol policy and domestic
partners' benefits and even
your statements in support of
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Diana Conklin, do you
ever feel like you're "legislat
ing morality" for the Stanford
community; if so, how does
your personal morality come
into play?
I don't think I'm legislating

'By and large, I
think the effect of
the cuts is hitting
the staff more
directly than it's
hitting students.'
— Norm Robinson

morality. What I'm trying to do is
make decisions that are consistent
with the University's values. And
I think it just so happens that I
believe in those values. And so,
while the decisions are difficult,
I'm not uncomfortable with the
final outcome.
What would you do if your
values were radically differ
ent from the University's —
would you not have this job
and/or would you not want
this job?
Probably both. I mean, if my
values were radically different
from the University's, I doubt the
University would want me and I
probably wouldn't want the Uni
versity.
Do you ever feel like you're
implementing the federal gov
ernment's morality and that
it might be something with
which you disagree? It seems
you might have preferred us
to stick with the old alcohol
policy that we finally settled
on last year, in place of the
Drug-Free Schools and Com
munities Act.
Well, I think that's true. I spent
a lot of time developing the former
alcohol policy, and it's something
that I believed in greatly. But the
fact that we now have a new policy
is something we'll learn to live
with. I may be an optimist, but
I'm also a realist. There are some
things one can change and there
are some things one cannot. And
the things that one cannot
change, we figure out how we're
going to live with them.
