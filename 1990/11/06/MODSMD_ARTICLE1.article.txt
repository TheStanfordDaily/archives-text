# Domestic Partners:
## After final forum, differences remain 
### Marci Shore 
A series of forums designed to
open communication about Stan
ford's new domestic partners pol
icy ended as it began, with confu
sion and hostility last night in
Escondido Village.
Drastic differences of opinion
characterizing the series on the
issue of domestic partners and
larger questions about the accept
ability of homosexuality remained
largely unresolved.
Director of Graduate Resi
dences Jean Kim, acting Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson
and Housing Center Director
Roger Whitney opened last night's
discussion, planning to address
questions on the new policy.
Under the policy, approved Oct.
9, heterosexual and gay and les
bian couples in long-term rela
tionships "with a commitment

similar to that of marriage" can
receive the same privileges as
married couples. This includes
access to family and couples hous
ing in Escondido Village.
Robinson explained there
would be no segregation between
married and domestic partners
housing, in response to a resident
who asked if he would be able to
select his neighbors.
Whitney assured married resi
dents the supply of housing could
be shifted to meet the demand if
housing shortages arose.
But Abdullah Massada, presi
dent of the Stanford Islamic Soci
ety, and another Escondido Village
resident set the tone of the forum
when they pointed out that
domestic partners has already
been implemented, and those in
opposition have little recourse.
Robinson explained the policy
was enacted so students would not
be forced to choose between their
domestic commitments and their
education at Stanford.
One lesbian woman argued,
"We have a non-discrimination
policy that includes sexual orien
tation. .. [Domestic partners] is a
natural application." The woman
and her lover moved out of Escon
dido Village last year after experi
encing a hostile environment
there.
Donna Coker, a mother and
married resident of Escondido Vil
lage, disputed the assumption
that the majority of married cou
ples oppose the domestic partners
policy. "I find it to be a moral good
for my children to be in an envi
ronment where they learn that
people are different," she told the
audience.
One African student said he
feels the University should
acknowledge it made a mistake in
not consulting students and resi
dents more extensively. Explain
ing he has three wives in Africa,
the man said people from differ
ent cultures and backgrounds

may find the new policy too dras
tic to accept at once.
"It is not [only] an American
thing," responded a bisexual
international student wearing a T
shirt with a pink triangle. He
expressed genuine fear of people
subscribing to religions which
condemn homosexuals to death.
Massada answered that the
Islamic viewpoint has been taken
out of context. While the Koran
may decree that homosexuality is
punishable by death, Moslems in
America have no intention of
enforcing this policy in a secular
country, he said.
One man questioned, "If people
start having sex with animals, are
we going to allow animals in
Escondido Village?"
Some residents said they feel
their religious beliefs are being
threatened by the new policy. "You
are making a moral, religious
judgment... You're making the
judgment that all relationships
are morally equal," one student
told Kim.
A parent expressed concern
that gay and lesbian neighbors
would threaten family values.
Supporters of the policy lashed
out, calling the man a bigot.
