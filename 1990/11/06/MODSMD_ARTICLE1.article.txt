# Domestic Partners:
## After final forum, differences remain 
### Marci Shore 
A series of forums designed to
open communication about Stan
ford's new domestic partners pol
icy ended as it began, with confu
sion and hostility last night in
Escondido Village.
Drastic differences of opinion
characterizing the series on the
issue of domestic partners and
larger questions about the accept
ability of homosexuality remained
largely unresolved.
Director of Graduate Resi
dences Jean Kim, acting Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson
and Housing Center Director
Roger Whitney opened last night's
discussion, planning to address
questions on the new policy.
Under the policy, approved Oct.
9, heterosexual and gay and les
bian couples in long-term rela
tionships "with a commitment

similar to that of marriage" can
receive the same privileges as
married couples. This includes
access to family and couples hous
ing in Escondido Village.
Robinson explained there
would be no segregation between
married and domestic partners
housing, in response to a resident
who asked if he would be able to
select his neighbors.
Whitney assured married resi
dents the supply of housing could
be shifted to meet the demand if
housing shortages arose.
But Abdullah Massada, presi
dent of the Stanford Islamic Soci
ety, and another Escondido Village
resident set the tone of the forum
when they pointed out that
domestic partners has already
been implemented, and those in
opposition have little recourse.
