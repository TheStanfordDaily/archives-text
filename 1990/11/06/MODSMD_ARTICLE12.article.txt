# Gunman assassinates Kahane

NEW YORK (AP) - Rabbi Meir
Kahane, who campaigned to drive Arabs
from Israel and urged American Jews to
arm themselves against anti-Semitism,
was shot to death last night after a
speech at a Manhattan hotel.
Police identified the assailant as El
Sayyid Al-Nosair, 35, of New Jersey. He
was wounded by a postal police officer as
they exchanged gunfire outside the Hal
loran House, said police spokesman
Officer Scott Bloch.
The postal officer and a bystander in
the hotel were also wounded, police said.
Kahane, 58, a Brooklyn-born Israeli
extremist who once served in the Israeli
parliament, was pronounced dead at
Bellevue Hospital, said hospital
spokesman Peter Schectman. Kahane
had been shot in the neck, he said.
Mayor David Dinkins said the shoot
ing was "an international tragedy that
shocks all of us."
Kahane was head of the anti-Arab
Kach party in Israel. The party advo
cates the ouster of all Arabs from
Israeli-held territory and a ban on Jew
ish-Arab marriages. The movement's
symbol is a clenched fist inside a Star of
David.

Kahane founded the militant Jewish
Defense League in the United States in
1968 to mount armed responses to anti-
Semitic acts. The group organized
classes in karate and weapons training
and held patrols in high-crime neighbor
hoods.
Seymour Reich, chairman of the Con
ference of Presidents of Mtgor Ameri
can-Jewish Organizations, called
Kahane "a highly controversial figure
who had strong supporters and oppo
nents."
"Whatever one thought about his
political program, his shocking assassi
nation will be deplored by friends and
foes alike," he said.
Witnesses said Kahane had given a
speech to about 60 people at a meeting
of the Zionist Emergency Evacuation
Rescue Organization. Shortly after 9
p.m., as Kahane mingled with guests, a
gunman came into the conference room
and fired at least two shots at Kahane.
The assailant ran from the room,
bumping into a man, whom he shot in
the leg, said Capt. Steve Davis, a police
spokesman.
The gunman fled outside and tried to
hijack a taxi, Davis said. An on-duty

postal officer outside a nearby post
office intervened. They exchanged gun
shots and both were wounded.
The officer was shot in the arm and
the gunman was hit in the chin.
All were taken to Bellevue where the
gunman was taken to surgery, said hos
pital spokeswoman Karen Crowe. He
was expected to survive. The officer's
wound was superficial, she said. All
were listed in stable condition.
The hotel on Lexington Avenue is
also called the New York Marriott East
Side.
Kahane served as a member of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament, for four
years but was barred from running for
re-election in 1988 after legislators
passed a law banning parties that have a
racist platform.
In September, Kahane went on trial
in Jerusalem on charges of disturbing
public order for leading an anti-Arab
rally after the stabbing deaths of two
Israelis last year. Kahane was also
charged with sedition for calling Arabs
"cancer spreading in our midsts" dur
ing a separate incident. Another hearing
in the trial was scheduled for December.
