Seven in 10 expect war
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Almost seven in 10
Americans responding to a survey expect the
United States to become involved in a war with
Iraq, and most respondents say America
should attack if Iraq mistreats U.S. hostages.
The poll, conducted by ABC News and
released yesterday, also said 65 percent of
those surveyed approve of President Bush's
handling of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. That
figure is about the same as a poll last month.
Bush's approval rate overall was 59 percent,
up from 51 percent last week when the presi
dent's ratings dropped apparently because of
criticism of his approach to budget negotia
tions with Congress.
About 61 percent disapproved of Bush's
handling of the nation's economy, the same
number that disapproved of the way the
Democrats are dealing with economic matters.
The telephone poll was conducted Nov. 2-4
among a random sampling of 1,093 voters. It
has a error rate of plus or minus 3.5 percent
age points.
NASA soon will launch Atlantis
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - NASA
expects to send space shuttle Atlantis into
orbit with a spy satellite next week.
Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy
Space Center, said yesterday"the best guess"
is Atlantis will lift ofT on its secret military mis
sion around Nov. 16.
Liftoff had been scheduled for Nov. 9 but
was delayed because of undisclosed problems
with the satellite, which reportedly will spy on
Iraq.
