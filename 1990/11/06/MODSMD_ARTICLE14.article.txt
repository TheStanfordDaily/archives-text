# Candidates nervously watching turnout
## 
### 
Nervous politicians put aside opin
ion polls and campaign strategies and
watched voter turnout across the
nation today for signs of winners and
losers in the first midterm election of
the 19905.
Republicans, admitting that a low
turnout would be bad news for their
candidates in most states, exhorted
their partisans to go to the polls.
Democrats counted on uneasiness over
the economy to induce their followers
to vote.
Voters were choosing 36 governors,
34 senators and the entire 435-mem
ber U.S. House as well as more than
6,000 state legislators. Normally
obscure legislative races have gotten
national attention from party officials
battling for control of the once-in-a
decade redrawing of political boundary
lines to conform to new census figures.

The stakes are highest in races for
governor in the nation's fastest-grow
ing states — California, Florida and
Texas. When House seats are redis
tributed to follow population shifts to
the Sun Belt, those three states will
pick up a total of 14.
Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the
House Republican campaign commit
tee, said the recent debate over the fed
eral budget "created a lot of disarray
among Republicans and, obviously, if
we don't do well, it'll be because
Republicans don't participate in the
process. Hopefully, they'll get angry at
Democrats and turn out."
Curtis Gans, director of the Com
mittee for the Study of the American
Electorate, predicted that about 36
percent of eligible Americans would go
to the polls, about the same as in 1986
when turnout was the lowest in more

than 40 years.
But Gans said participation would
be higher in states with hot races.
In Florida, where Democrats were
hopeful that former Sen. Lawton
Chiles will unseat Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez, election officials forecast a
high turnout.
In California, Republicans were
confident Sen. Pete Wilson would out
poll Democrat Dianne Feinstein in the
race to succeed Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian.
After weeks of barnstorming on
behalf of GOP candidates from Maine
to Hawaii, President Bush concen
trated on helping the faltering cam
paign of Clayton Williams for governor
of Texas. Once far ahead in the polls,
oilman Williams was struggling to out
last Democratic state Treasurer Ann
Richards.

"I urge all Texans ... to get out
there and vote and do not take democ
racy for granted. You have a chance to
make a difference," Bush said Monday,
campaigning with Williams at his side.
Harvey Gantt, the black former
mayor of Charlotte, N.C., predicted
he'd pull the upset of the year and top
ple Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
"We're going to win," Gantt told
supporters. "That's right. How sweet
that's going to be."
"It has been a spirited debate, albeit
a vicious one," Helms told reporters.
He accused Gantt of running a nega
tive campaign and said, "I regret his
tone. We had hoped we could run a pos
itive campaign, but from the beginning
they came in with slashing commer
cials."
